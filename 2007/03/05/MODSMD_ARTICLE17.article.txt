## Perfect pursuit Baseball collects 2,500th program win 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Short of setting it at the College World Se
ries in Omaha, a Hollywood screenwriter
would he hard-pressed to come up with a
more fitting end to Stanford's pursuit of 2500
wins.
This weekend's sweep of rival California
had all the dramatic elements — a freshman
outdueling one of the West's premier arms,
with his pitching shutting down transfer
David Cooper (who entered the series bat
ting over .400) and two come-from-behind
wins — as Stanford won 1-0,5-4 and 9-7, re
spectively. But the most satisfying thing about
Stanford baseball's (10-5) wins was reaching
the magic 2500-win milestone against the
Bears (7-10).
"I don't think it could have worked out
any other way." sophomore Sean Ratliff
said. "I think it's pretty much written down
that we had to beat Cal to get to 2500. It's big
for us to get the sweep and keep our mo
mentum going into the rest of the season."
Stanford becomes the fifth school in
NCAA Division-I history to reach the 2500
mark, after Fordham. Texas, Southern Cali
fornia and Michigan. The Cardinal also ex
tended its home record to 9-0 this season
and its overall winning streak to eight
games.
Jeff Inman became Stanford's first fresh
man to start a Friday-night game since 1995.
Facing arguably one of the West Coast's best
pitchers. Cal's Tyson Ross, Inman (2-1)
threw 7.2 innings of shutout baseball with
nine strikeouts. Relying heavily on his off
speed pitches for outs, Inman allowed only
three hits against the Bears, who entered the
game hitting .316 as a team.
"I came out feeling a little different
today," Inman said."l've always thought my
changeup was my best pitch. And I just had
a lot of opportunities to throw it with two
strikes and get a few hitters out in front."
Ross (1 -4) was as dominant as advertised,
but he once again ended up a bit short. The
sophomore righty threw eight innings and
gave up only one run with eight strikeouts,
but a third-inning RBI groundout by sopho
more Joey August would be enough. Stan
ford reliever junior David Stringer notched
his sixth save of the season with 1.1 perfect
innings to preserve the 1-0 win.

six-run third inning. Junior Brendan Do
maracki (2-5. 2 RBI) scored junior Adam
Sorgi and Ratliff (3-4.4 R) with a single that
chopped over the head of first baseman
Mike Van Winden. Domaracki showed bunt
to draw the infield in before getting the
RBI-single, knocking out starter Alex Rollin
(3-1).
Sophomore Cord Phelps smashed a two-
RBI triple with two outs that Cal's Jeff
Kobernus almost caught. ITie centerfielder
appeared to have run down with an excel
lent jump, but the ball popped out of his
glove as he hit the ground after diving. The
six-run outburst put the Cardinal up 7-4.
"I thought we swung the bats well today,"
head coach Mark Marquess said. "We got 13
hits and we got some big ones."
Sophomore Austin Yount (2-0) took over

for Gallagher and pitched three innings for
the win. Lefties Blake Hancock and Tom
Stilson pitched the Cardinal out of hack-to
