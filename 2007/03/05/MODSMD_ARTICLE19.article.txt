## Divers qualify for NCAAs 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford's women's diving team
is sending two divers to the upcoming
NCA A championships: One is a senior,
five-time All-American and respected
international competitor, the other is a
freshman in her first season of NCAA
competition.
After their performances at this
weekend's NCAA Zone-E Diving

Championships, senior Cassidy Krug
and freshman Shana Karp qualified to
compcte at the NCAA championships,
which will take place in Minneapolis,
Mar. 8-10.
According to Stanford head diving
coach Rick Schavone. it is not unusual
to have such a distinct pair of divers
going to the national championships.
"Because of our recruiting system,
we usually have one class that has a per
son going to NCAAs and then one two

to three classes later," Schavone said.
"Hopefully in two to three years. Shana
will he a national-level competitor.
When we recruited Cassidy she wasn't
a big name. It's the way I've done it
throughout 30 years â€” get someone
who shows potential and increase ex
pectations."

season with wins in the three-meter and
