# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Divers qualify for NCAAs 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford's women's diving team
is sending two divers to the upcoming
NCA A championships: One is a senior,
five-time All-American and respected
international competitor, the other is a
freshman in her first season of NCAA
competition.
After their performances at this
weekend's NCAA Zone-E Diving

Championships, senior Cassidy Krug
and freshman Shana Karp qualified to
compcte at the NCAA championships,
which will take place in Minneapolis,
Mar. 8-10.
According to Stanford head diving
coach Rick Schavone. it is not unusual
to have such a distinct pair of divers
going to the national championships.
"Because of our recruiting system,
we usually have one class that has a per
son going to NCAAs and then one two

to three classes later," Schavone said.
"Hopefully in two to three years. Shana
will he a national-level competitor.
When we recruited Cassidy she wasn't
a big name. It's the way I've done it
throughout 30 years — get someone
who shows potential and increase ex
pectations."
krug continued her unbeaten post
season with wins in the three-meter and

I'he problem, Giannangeli said, is
a lack of awareness among under
graduates nationwide.
"Undergraduate students hear
about law schools and medical
schools." she said. "Unfortunately,
college students don't always hear
about Master of Business Adminis
tration [MBA] programs."
She added that the business
school curriculum is often mistaken
as inflexible by potential women ap
plicants.
'Tor women in particular who
may be planning on one day having a

uate program is key." Giannangeli
said. "And it is important that we ed
ucate undergraduate students and
counselors about the MBA opportu
nities and flexibility afforded with
the degree."
In the past several years, the GSB
has sent representatives to more than
80 colleges and universities world

program and participates in collegiate
or professional forums on women's is

TAI.KINCi ABOUT GENDER
While the GSB Admissions Of
fice continues to seek increased
numbers of women applicants, a
number of current students have
pointed out that a gender gap also
exists in student dialogue.
Women at the GSB said they
were uncomfortable discussing gen
der issues with their male classmates
for fear of being misinterpreted.
"It is pretty taboo to bring it up,"
Struck said."because I don't want to
be labeled as a feminist."
Moreno called it a "( atch-22."
"Both men and women have an in
centive not to talk about this issue,"
she said. "I don't want to attract spe
cial attention just because Fm a
woman, and for men. they are already
in a more comfortable situation."
Kenji Gjovig. a male student at
the (iSB. said that women some

times need to he more open about
what is offensive.
"To he honest," he said, "percep
tion is really key in gender issues."
Gjovig said that men sometimes
mistake women's silence for ap
proval.
"The problem is that it is not evi
dent to a lot of men."he said. "Unfor
tunately, men are not wired to know
that the things they do and say might
be affecting women in unintended
ways. In this case, silence is acquies
cence and men assume that unless
they receive feedback, they must be
doing great."
Yet Gjovig also recognized the
sensitive and awkward nature he
said women must face in voicing
their opinions about gender issues.
"1 can't even imagine how hard it
must be to stand up in public and tell
someone that their comments are in
appropriate," he said.
In an attempt to promote discus
sion. the GSB has a weekly Women
in Management program whose goal
is to provide first-year female stu
dents with a forum to discuss gender
issues.
Moreno and five other women —
who have continued these meetings
into their second year at the GSB —
recently invited a male colleague to
their meeting for an informal discus
sion across gender lines. Education
Prof. Myra Strober facilitated the
meeting.

"After the discussion, students
said they often didn't realize how
other students felt about sensitive in
cidents," Stroher said. "Some men
students recognize that they could
be more proactive in speaking out
when other men are insensitive to
sexism. Some women realize that
there are more men who are sensi
tive to gender bias than they had re
alized."
Moreno blamed the lack of gen
der issues discussions on the formal
atmosphere of the GSB.
"The issue is that it has to be a
more open environment all around
at the GSB," she said. "The biggest
issue right now is to overcome the
thought that it is taboo."

Struck said she believes her expe
rience with gender issues at the GSB
has prepared her well for the busi
ness world.
"Meeting fellow women here at
the GSB who are so talented has
given me more confidence,"she said.
Reflecting on her previous job
and on her time at the GSB. Moreno
echoed Struck's comments.
"I've never seen these disadvan
tages as a deterrent," Moreno said.
"It's the reality,and it's unfortunate,
but it's not going to dissuade me."
Giannangeli pointed to a strong
support system and a tight network
of female colleagues as essential to

women's success in the business
world.
"No man is an island." she said.
"No woman should be either.
Women need to connect and unite
with others."
Yet Giannangeli also said that
change especially when it comes
to flexible family support for work
ing women — must come from the
institutional level.
"It is a work-balance issue that
collectively we need to address," she
said. "I applaud many of the profes
sional services firms that are offering
their employees on maternity leave
the chance to stay connected
through flexible work options."
"It's not just a woman's issue,"
Struck added."lt's a family issue. It's
about helping families to function
easier."
Struck said she remains opti
mistic about the future of women in
business as long as efforts to boost
awareness about opportunities for
women continue to be made. Change
will be slow,she said,but it will come.
"We are all responsible for mak
ing this work." Giannangeli said.
"But I do believe that it is possible to
balance a rewarding professional life
with an enriching personal life.There
are infinite combinations to make
that possible."

I'he problem, Giannangeli said, is
a lack of awareness among under
graduates nationwide.
"Undergraduate students hear
about law schools and medical
schools." she said. "Unfortunately,
college students don't always hear
about Master of Business Adminis
tration [MBA] programs."
She added that the business
school curriculum is often mistaken
as inflexible by potential women ap
plicants.

TAI.KINCi ABOUT GENDER
While the GSB Admissions Of
fice continues to seek increased
numbers of women applicants, a
number of current students have
pointed out that a gender gap also
exists in student dialogue.
Women at the GSB said they
were uncomfortable discussing gen
der issues with their male classmates
for fear of being misinterpreted.
"It is pretty taboo to bring it up,"
Struck said."because I don't want to
be labeled as a feminist."
Moreno called it a "( atch-22."
"Both men and women have an in
centive not to talk about this issue,"
she said. "I don't want to attract spe
cial attention just because Fm a
woman, and for men. they are already
in a more comfortable situation."
Kenji Gjovig. a male student at
the (iSB. said that women some

times need to he more open about
what is offensive.
"To he honest," he said, "percep
tion is really key in gender issues."
Gjovig said that men sometimes
mistake women's silence for ap
proval.
"The problem is that it is not evi
dent to a lot of men."he said. "Unfor
tunately, men are not wired to know
that the things they do and say might
be affecting women in unintended
ways. In this case, silence is acquies
cence and men assume that unless
they receive feedback, they must be
doing great."
Yet Gjovig also recognized the
sensitive and awkward nature he
said women must face in voicing
their opinions about gender issues.
"1 can't even imagine how hard it
must be to stand up in public and tell
someone that their comments are in
appropriate," he said.
In an attempt to promote discus
sion. the GSB has a weekly Women
in Management program whose goal
is to provide first-year female stu
dents with a forum to discuss gender
issues.
Moreno and five other women —
who have continued these meetings
into their second year at the GSB —
recently invited a male colleague to
their meeting for an informal discus
sion across gender lines. Education
Prof. Myra Strober facilitated the
meeting.

"After the discussion, students
said they often didn't realize how
other students felt about sensitive in
cidents," Stroher said. "Some men
students recognize that they could
be more proactive in speaking out
when other men are insensitive to
sexism. Some women realize that
there are more men who are sensi
tive to gender bias than they had re
alized."
Moreno blamed the lack of gen
der issues discussions on the formal
atmosphere of the GSB.
"The issue is that it has to be a
more open environment all around
at the GSB," she said. "The biggest
issue right now is to overcome the
thought that it is taboo."

Struck said she believes her expe
rience with gender issues at the GSB
has prepared her well for the busi
ness world.
"Meeting fellow women here at
the GSB who are so talented has
given me more confidence,"she said.
Reflecting on her previous job
and on her time at the GSB. Moreno
echoed Struck's comments.
"I've never seen these disadvan
tages as a deterrent," Moreno said.
"It's the reality,and it's unfortunate,
but it's not going to dissuade me."
Giannangeli pointed to a strong
support system and a tight network
of female colleagues as essential to

women's success in the business
world.
"No man is an island." she said.
"No woman should be either.
Women need to connect and unite
with others."
Yet Giannangeli also said that
change especially when it comes
to flexible family support for work
ing women — must come from the
institutional level.
"It is a work-balance issue that
collectively we need to address," she
said. "I applaud many of the profes
sional services firms that are offering
their employees on maternity leave
the chance to stay connected
through flexible work options."
"It's not just a woman's issue,"
Struck added."lt's a family issue. It's
about helping families to function
easier."
Struck said she remains opti
mistic about the future of women in
business as long as efforts to boost
awareness about opportunities for
women continue to be made. Change
will be slow,she said,but it will come.
"We are all responsible for mak
ing this work." Giannangeli said.
"But I do believe that it is possible to
balance a rewarding professional life
with an enriching personal life.There
are infinite combinations to make
that possible."

The Stanford's women's diving team
is sending two divers to the upcoming
NCA A championships: One is a senior,
five-time All-American and respected
international competitor, the other is a
freshman in her first season of NCAA
competition.
After their performances at this
weekend's NCAA Zone-E Diving

Championships, senior Cassidy Krug
and freshman Shana Karp qualified to
compcte at the NCAA championships,
which will take place in Minneapolis,
Mar. 8-10.
According to Stanford head diving
coach Rick Schavone. it is not unusual
to have such a distinct pair of divers
going to the national championships.
"Because of our recruiting system,
we usually have one class that has a per
son going to NCAAs and then one two

to three classes later," Schavone said.
"Hopefully in two to three years. Shana
will he a national-level competitor.
When we recruited Cassidy she wasn't
a big name. It's the way I've done it
throughout 30 years — get someone
who shows potential and increase ex
pectations."
