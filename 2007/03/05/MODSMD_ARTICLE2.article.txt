dez. And now. Ivan Radenovic.
Radenovic added his name to
Maples Pavilion lore with a per
formance as dominating as any
that the building has witnessed in
recent years.
His 37 points made Stanford
rallies from 18-3 and 41-21 deficits

irrelevant, as the Wildcats claimed
an 85-80 overtime victory in a
game in which they never trailed.
Walk-on redshirt sophomore
Kenny Brown scored a career
high 22, freshman center Brook
Lopez added 21 —topping 20 for
the fourth time in his last five
games — and sophomore forward
1 .awrence I lill chipped in 20 in the
loss.
But Stanford had no answer for
Radenovic, the 6-foot 10.240-pound
senior post from Serbia.
"We had to take advantage of the
mismatch with Ivan." Arizona Coach
1 ute Olson said. "It was a tough
guard for all of their big guys."
Radenovic often camped out on
the three point line, forcing Brook
and Robin Lopez to guard him 20 feet
away from the hoop.Then he put it on
the court and blew past the bulkier,
slower twins.
"I know that 1 ean take the
Lopezes oft the dribble," Radenovic
said. "Whenever they put them on
me. I'd dribble, and whenever some
one helped, dish to the open man for
the shot. Iben when they put Finger
on me. I was dishing to Lopez's man
for the shot."
I lie plan worked. I le finished with
12-of-l8 shooting, including 2-for-2
on three pointers. 11-of-11 on free

sive), two steals, seven assists and no
turnovers.
"Ivan had probably as good a
game as we've had out of anyone —
forever," said Olson, in his 24th year
as Arizona's head coach.
Behind Radenovic, the Wildcats
started hot. while Stanford came out
lethargic — perhaps still shaking off
the food poisoning that weakened
forwards junior Taj Finger and senior
Fred Washington and forced sopho
more guard Mitch Johnson to the
bench for the second half.
Ihe Wildcats hit their first five
shots, used a 15-0 run to build an 18-3
lead five minutes in. and pushed the
margin to 41-22 at halftime.
"In the first half, we probably
played as well as have all year long,"
Olson said.
But Brown saved Stanford's day
(and reputation, in a nationally-tele
vised game) in the second. I le didn't
merely fill in for the injured sopho
more Anthony Goods (latest diagno
sis: probable for Thursday); he chan
neled him. with big shot after big shot
when his team needed him most.
Brown finished 9-of-13, 4-of-9 deep,
with three steals and a feisty defense.

It was his jumper that started the
rally, cutting the deficit to 45-28 two
minutes into the second. And it was his
three with a man in his face and seven
seconds to go in regulation that capped
a furious rally for the Cardinal.
"Kenny Brown was unbelievable."
Radenovic said. "Every one of those
shots, he had a great deal of pressure
on him. Once he got going it seemed
like he would make it no matter
what."
Stanford didn't come back in a
spurt — instead scoring no more than
six in a row the entire game — but
they were persistent. The defense
(save for when they were up against
Radenovic) improved in the second
half, and Stanford slowly but surely
whittled the lead down to three, be
fore Brown's miracle shot.
Radenovic was less charitable.
"We didn't play defense in the sec
ond half." he said. "If you don't play
defense against this team, it's hard to
keep a 20-point lead."
Despite the Herculean comeback,
Stanford's NCAA Tournament
hopes are up in the air.The RPI ranks
them 57th. a problem considering
that taking away the 31 conference
champs leaves only 34 at-large teams
in the 65-team field. But high-profile
wins in-conference (Stanford has
beat every Pac-10 team, save for Ari
zona) and out-of-conference (at
ACC-leading Virginia, versus Texas
Tech and at Fresno State). as well as a
generally weak field this year are rea
sons to believe the Cardinal can
restart its 11-year March Madness
streak after last year's hiatus.
Stanford Coach Trent Johnson
must be a little nervous, because he
rallied for Stanford's inclusion
postgame, citing the Virginia win and
five victories over ranked opponents.
"When you look at the lull body of
work, why wouldn't this group of
young men be in the NCAA Tourna
ment?" Johnson said.
Bottom line: Stanford would be in
if the Big Dance started today, and
probably will make the cut no matter
how they fare in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment this weekend. But with a loss to
hometown USC at 6:50 pm on Thurs
day, the next 72 hours will involve a
lot of hand-wringing and fingernail
biting.
"When you take a look at who
Stanford has played and who they
have beaten. I'm biased, but I think
they should be in." said Olson, who
had gone out of his way to praise Stan
ford throughout the years. "The Pac
10's the best that it's been in the time
I've been at Arizona. 24 years. I've
never seen it so strong, top to bottom."

sive), two steals, seven assists and no
turnovers.
"Ivan had probably as good a
game as we've had out of anyone —
forever," said Olson, in his 24th year
as Arizona's head coach.
Behind Radenovic, the Wildcats
started hot. while Stanford came out
lethargic — perhaps still shaking off
the food poisoning that weakened
forwards junior Taj Finger and senior
Fred Washington and forced sopho
more guard Mitch Johnson to the
bench for the second half.
Ihe Wildcats hit their first five
shots, used a 15-0 run to build an 18-3
lead five minutes in. and pushed the
margin to 41-22 at halftime.
"In the first half, we probably
played as well as have all year long,"
Olson said.
But Brown saved Stanford's day
(and reputation, in a nationally-tele
vised game) in the second. I le didn't
merely fill in for the injured sopho
more Anthony Goods (latest diagno
sis: probable for Thursday); he chan
neled him. with big shot after big shot
when his team needed him most.
Brown finished 9-of-13, 4-of-9 deep,
with three steals and a feisty defense.

It was his jumper that started the
rally, cutting the deficit to 45-28 two
minutes into the second. And it was his
three with a man in his face and seven
seconds to go in regulation that capped
a furious rally for the Cardinal.
"Kenny Brown was unbelievable."
Radenovic said. "Every one of those
shots, he had a great deal of pressure
on him. Once he got going it seemed
like he would make it no matter
what."
Stanford didn't come back in a
spurt — instead scoring no more than
six in a row the entire game — but
they were persistent. The defense
(save for when they were up against
Radenovic) improved in the second
half, and Stanford slowly but surely
whittled the lead down to three, be
fore Brown's miracle shot.
Radenovic was less charitable.
"We didn't play defense in the sec
ond half." he said. "If you don't play
defense against this team, it's hard to
keep a 20-point lead."
Despite the Herculean comeback,
Stanford's NCAA Tournament
hopes are up in the air.The RPI ranks
them 57th. a problem considering
that taking away the 31 conference
champs leaves only 34 at-large teams
in the 65-team field. But high-profile
wins in-conference (Stanford has
beat every Pac-10 team, save for Ari
zona) and out-of-conference (at
ACC-leading Virginia, versus Texas
Tech and at Fresno State). as well as a
generally weak field this year are rea
sons to believe the Cardinal can
restart its 11-year March Madness
streak after last year's hiatus.
Stanford Coach Trent Johnson
must be a little nervous, because he
rallied for Stanford's inclusion
postgame, citing the Virginia win and
five victories over ranked opponents.
"When you look at the lull body of
work, why wouldn't this group of
young men be in the NCAA Tourna
ment?" Johnson said.
Bottom line: Stanford would be in
if the Big Dance started today, and
probably will make the cut no matter
how they fare in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment this weekend. But with a loss to
hometown USC at 6:50 pm on Thurs
day, the next 72 hours will involve a
lot of hand-wringing and fingernail
biting.
"When you take a look at who
Stanford has played and who they
have beaten. I'm biased, but I think
they should be in." said Olson, who
had gone out of his way to praise Stan
ford throughout the years. "The Pac
10's the best that it's been in the time
I've been at Arizona. 24 years. I've
never seen it so strong, top to bottom."
