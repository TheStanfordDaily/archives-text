Casey Jacobson. Josh Chil
dress. Ike Diogu. Chris Hernan
dez. And now. Ivan Radenovic.
Radenovic added his name to
Maples Pavilion lore with a per
formance as dominating as any
that the building has witnessed in
recent years.
His 37 points made Stanford
rallies from 18-3 and 41-21 deficits

irrelevant, as the Wildcats claimed
an 85-80 overtime victory in a
game in which they never trailed.
Walk-on redshirt sophomore
Kenny Brown scored a career
high 22, freshman center Brook
Lopez added 21 —topping 20 for
the fourth time in his last five
games — and sophomore forward
1 .awrence I lill chipped in 20 in the
loss.
