## Stanford keeps rolling 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Simply put, senior driver Katie
Hansen was unstoppable this weekend.
rhe Stanford co-captain put on a
spectacular scoring clinic, finding the
back of the cage an incredible 14 times
before her team returned home from its
three-game road trip through Arizona
and Southern California.
Hansen got the weekend started
with a bang, tallying six goals to pace the
top-ranked Cardinal in its 12-7 victory
over No. II Arizona State. Her offen
sive production then dropped to a more
modest four goals per game as Stanford
(14-1,6-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) went on to defeat No. 9 San
Diego State, 14-8. and No. 17 UC-San
Diego, 13-3.
Hansen was the Cardinal's leading
scorer in all three games, and her 14
goals on the weekend brought her to
within two of the team-scoring lead.
Additionally, her double hat-trick on
Thursday evening against the Sun Dev
ils was the second time in her career
that Hansen had recorded six goals in a
game. (She also achieved the feat on
March 28 of last year against Hawaii.)
Yet in spite of her gaudy weekend
statistics. Hansen was typically unas
suming in her evaluation of her per
formance.
"It was just one of those things
where I got more looks [than usual],"
she said. "We also scored a lot as a
team."

The Cardinal's high-powered attack
more than made up for what Hansen
described as a sub-par defensive effort.
"Defense has always been where
we've excelled, but this weekend we
didn't play the way we're capable [of
playing]," she said.
That may have been partially due to
the fact that Stanford was without sen
ior two-meter defender Alison Gregor

warts. Gregorka departed last Wednes

In its Thursday-evening weekend
opener, the Cardinal was also forced to
deal with an unusual Arizona State de
fensive game-plan. The Sun Devils at
tempted to shut down the Stanford
counterattack by consistently leaving
one player in their defensive end.
As a result, the Cardinal — one of the

fastest teams in the nation — was unable
to generate as many scoring opportuni
ties off the fast-break as usual. But after
being held to just one goal in the first pe
riod. the Stanford women exploded for
five in the second to take a 6-3 lead into
the half. Before the game was through,
the Cardinal had doubled that total on
the strength of Hansen's six goals and
sophomore Lolo Silver's three. Fresh
man driver Kelsey Molshouser netted a
pair of goals in the final period to put the
game out of reach.

Stanford completed its perfect
weekend on Saturday afternoon by
posting a dominant 13-3 victory over
UCSD. In addition to Hansen, Silver
and Steffens also notched multiple
goals on the day. The Cardinal defense
posted its most effective effort of the
weekend, limiting the Tritons to a single
goal in the first half of play.
