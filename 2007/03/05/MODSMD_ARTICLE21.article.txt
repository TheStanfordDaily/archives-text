going to have days like that.'
The Northwestern loss was most
surprising. No. 9 Stanford (16-5)
hadn't been mercy-ruled this sea
son. but the Wildcats did the trick
with three runs in the sixth.
Junior infielder Michelle Smith
gave Stanford the early lead with a
two-run homer in the first, but
Northwestern finished with 17 hits
on the day, roughing up Cardinal
junior pitcher Becky McCullough.
The Wildcats scored seven runs in
the first two innings, and struck out
just once on the afternoon.
"We jumped out on Northwest
ern. but couldn't hold them off,"
Rittman said. "They're a very good
hitting team. It was the kind of game
where it just snowballed on us."
Stanford's most exciting win
came the game before, with Smith
beating Texas Tech with a solo walk
off homer in the seventh.The Cardi
nal jumped to a 1 -0 lead when Smith
singled to left, scoring sophomore
infielder Maddy Coon in the fourth.
Texas Tech scratched out a tying run
in the sixth with two singles sand
wiching a steal.
Sophomore Missy Penna went
the distance on the mound, yielding
just four hits and one run. while
striking out 12.
But the hero was Smith, who led
Stanford with five hits, three homers
and seven RBI on the weekend.
"She's been in a lot of big games
and come through in a lot of big
games." Rittman said. "It's good to
see her getting hot."
Stanford's other win came yes
terday. as the Cardinal scored five in
the first and notched a weekend
high 12 hits to easily dispatch of
Minnesota.The Gophers scored two
in the first against the starting
Penna, and one in the fifth against
McCullough. who replaced Penna
just one out into the game and went
the remaining six and two-thirds.
Stanford's first eight batters
reached base and every non-pitcher
in the lineup recorded a hit in the
victory.
The Cardinal could desperately
have used that offense against Cal
State-Fullerton on Friday. Titan
pitcher Candice Baker no-hit and
shut out the Cardinal — only five
walks separated her from perfection
— wasting a fine effort from McCul
lough.
The tournament started on a sour
note, as Cal Poly upset the Cardinal,
who had won their last 12. with three
homers. Smith and freshman infield
er Shannon Koplitz each hit solo
home runs for Stanford in the loss.
For the Mustangs, Lisa Modglin
homered on the game's first pitch,
while Sarah Iwata belted a two-run
blast and Melissa Pura hit a solo shot
in the fifth. Pura's two-RBI double
down the leftfield line in the seventh
provided the final margin.
Penna struck out eight in the
complete-game loss.
The Cardinal hosts the Stanford
Classic next, starting this Friday.
