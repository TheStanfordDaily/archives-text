Wiggins agreed that it was a lucky night
for her shooting.
"I've never shot like this," she said. "It
was one of those games where you just feel
like you're in rhythm. I was just really trying
to open things up since they were in a zone.
Last [week] 1 was able to watch USC and
could see how we really needed perimeter
shooting."
Wiggins was not, however, the Card's
only shining star. Senior forward Kristen
Newlin tied the tournament's single-game
record with five blocked shots. Newlin also
led the team with 10 rebounds and followed
only Wiggins in scoring with 10 points.
"I just wanted to provide a defensive
spark for the team," Newlin said. "1 don't
know if it was my best game or not. but it
was just a super-big win."
VanDerveer complimented the post
players for running the floor well and open
ing up opportunities.
"I encouraged our team to run the floor,
and try to get their 'bigs' tired." VanDerveer
said."] I thought Brooke Smith and Newlin]
ran really well, and 1 think that maybe that
just got [USC] a little tired. 1 could see that
they didn't have the same spring at the end
of the game that they had at the beginning."
That tiredness must have come early for
the Trojans. After leading for the first five
minutes of the game, USC allowed an 11-0
run by Stanford to put the Cardinal up 19-3,
and the Women of Troy were never able to
recover. By halftime, Stanford led by 33-24.
thanks mostly to Wiggins' 18 points and the
frontcourt's 14 defensive rebounds.
Seniors Shay Murphy (16 points, seven
rebounds) and Chloe Kerr (14 points, seven
boards) led USC. The Women of Troy were
able to out-rebound the Cardinal. 41-39,
though this may have been partially due to
the minimal appearance by Stanford's
freshman center Jayne Appel. who fouled
out in only nine minutes of play. Given
Appel's foul trouble. Smith and freshman
forward Michelle Harrison both helped to
establish post presence, notching eight
points each.
Stanford's largest lead of 25 came with
8:26 remaining in the second half. Though
the Cardinal did not score for the last 4:22,
the Trojans' nine points during the period
were not enough to close the gap.
Stanford will now meet second-seeded
No. 9 Arizona State in Monday's tourna
ment final, 7:30 p.m. in San Jose. The team
knows that the Sun Devils' staunch defense
will likely not allow for the scoring opportu
nities seen against USC.
"They're going to climb all over us. and
they're looking forward to it," VanDerveer
said. "We've taken them twice, and this is a
third one, they're going to be super aggres

sive, and they're going to work to beat up all
over us the whole game. Whoever has the
ball, they will be defending it as aggressive
ly as they can "
After an overtime loss to UCLA in last
year's tournament championship, Stanford
will come hungry to reclaim the title.
"1 think this is the benefit of the [Pac-10]
Tournament: It gets us ready for the
NCAA's." VanDerveer said. "[Only] one
team is going to walk out Pac-10 Tourna
ment Champions. We experienced this last
year when we were in |the championship]
game, and it's upsetting to us that we didn't
get it. We're going to work really hard to get
it tomorrow."
Wiggins returns in 65-55 win over Arizona
After two weeks on the bench. Wiggins
was set free on ninth-seeded Arizona on
Saturday night, opening up the Cardinal of
fense in its first game at HP Pavilion. Stan
ford sent the Wildcats home in a 65-55 quar
terfinal win.
Wiggins sat out for the last two regular
season games.and with VanDerveer's warn
ings that she wouldn't see action this week
end unless necessary, it was a surprise when
the junior guard came off the bench for the
starting lineup.
Hands in the air, Wiggins was embraced
by the loudest cheers yet from the Stanford
crowd.
"Anyone who's been injured for a long
time knows that when you get back on the
court it's really exciting," she said, "and you
just have a new appreciation for the game."
Although a slow-tempo game, one
which VanDerveer called "not that strenu
ous," Wiggins made her presence felt, scor
ing four three-pointers — two in each half
— that keyed major Cardinal runs. She had
16 points on the night.
"With Candice out there," said Jillian
Harmon,"there's less to worry about."
The sophomore guard also helped Stan
ford bring back its perimeter offense after
two weeks of relying on shots in the paint,
scoring 11 points (including two threes),
along with five assists.
The Wildcats took the first lead of the
game on a three-pointer from Joy
I lollingsworth (14points,six rebounds).but
Wiggins soon made her first layup in two
weeks, and with a three-pointer from Har
mon at 16:45 in the half, the Cardinal
claimed its lead for the rest of the game.
The lead-taking three began a three
minute span in which Stanford held Ari
zona scoreless. In that time, Wiggins pow
ered an 8-0 run on two of her signature
three-point shots, giving the Cardinal a 13-5
lead. And in the next four minutes, the Wild
cats could only muster four points as 1 lar

mon went on her own run with two layups
and a three.
"We wanted to open things up offensive
ly," VanDerveer said. "It was great to see Jill
had that perimeter shot, and obviously. Can
dice is a fabulous perimeter shooter for us."
Going to the outside was important for
the Cardinal, which saw its top post players
struggle in the paint during the first half.
Appel was a major target for the Wildcats'
defense, and was swarmed when in posses
sion at one point early in the game. Appel
then passed to Harmon for her second
three of the night, as the Cardinal extended
its lead. 18-7.
From there, the teams traded shots back
and forth, but in the last four minutes Ari
zona went on a surprising 9-0 run, catching
up with Stanford and closing the half down
by just two. 30-28.
At the start of the second period, the
Wildcats tied on a layup from
Hollingsworth. but Smith countered with
her signature hook shot to pull the Cardinal
ahead. By 15:49 in the half. Stanford had a
regained a five-point lead, and though Ari
zona junior Ashley Whisonant (who had a

team-high 18 points) was able to bring it
back within three soon after. Wiggins
knocked down two straight three-pointers
to regain the Cardinal momentum.
From there, though, much of the Stan
ford offense moved inside as the Arizona
defense could no longer handle Appel and
Smith. Ihe duo had 13 points and five
points, respectively, in the half, as the Cardi
nal left the Wildcats behind on a 12-4 run.
never coming within less than seven points
for the rest of the night.
Appel had 18 total points and 13 re
bounds for her first postseason double-dou
ble. Although Appel was modest about her
performance, saying she "could do a little
better." the Wildcats understood why she
was recently named Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year.
"Second half, their size took over, and
Appel was amazing." Arizona head coach
Joan Bonvicini said. "She finishes, she dom
inates."
