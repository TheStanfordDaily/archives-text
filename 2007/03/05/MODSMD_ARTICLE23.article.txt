## Editorial Board Kudos to alumni for giving 
### 
On Feb. 23. ITie Daily reported that
Stanford raised a total of $911.2 mil
lion in 2006 ("Record donations re
ceived "]. While we commend the efforts to
raise such an enormous sum. The Daily
would like to focus on more than just the
amount of mone\ raised, reportedly more
than 50 percent more than the nearest annu
al total and more than $300 million more
than last year's fundraising.
In many ways, more important than the
record-breaking total raised was the record
breaking number of donors who con
tributed. In particular.The Daily would like
to recognize the many alumni who con
tributed to the capital campaign. The Uni
versity's financial gains are a testament to
their success and to their devotion to Stan
ford.
It is praiseworthy that Stanford's total
came from more than 72.000 unique individ
uals. This figure illustrates that the Universi
ty's supporters are not merely a small cabal
of the ultra-elite. Instead, many donors
come from a somewhat larger segment of
the population. While John Arrillaga and
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation

are examples of two mega-donors who con
tribute substantially to Stanford, the role of
the scores of smaller-scale donations — on
the order of a few hundred dollars — should
never be overlooked.
Most notably, according to the Universi
ty. 40 percent of alumni donated to Stanford
last year. By donating, they not only sent
their money, but also their tacit message of
support for their alma mater. Stanford's
alumni giving is not as high as, say. Prince
ton's, often the gold-standard of alumni par
ticipation, where as of 2003, over 75 percent
of undergraduate alums gave money to the
school. It is nonetheless admirable that
Stanford's graduates turned out in the num
bers they did.
The University's finances undeniably
affect everything from tuition hikes to
worker payments to professors hired and
research done. The gifts received this past
year help every one of those sectors. We ac
knowledge the donors, and the alumni in
particular, who donated the University in
2006.
Thank you, and we hope to hear from
you in 2007.
