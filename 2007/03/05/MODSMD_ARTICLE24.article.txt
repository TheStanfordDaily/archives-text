# Say No to CoHo
## 
### 
As you might imagine, I love reading
the opinions page. When I see cam
pus heroes like Darren Franich pro
duce such vituperative masterworks as his
latest invective against Nanci I lowe, 1 he
come thrilled, for these attacks at people in
high places confirm for me that below its
placid surface, "stuff" really happens at
Stanford University.
And I often feel like ranting myself, giv
ing the proverbial Man a piece of my mind.
You couldn 't imagine how many of my idiot
friends feel the same way, egging me on to
turn this column into a serious forum for di
atribe. I've got one option, they say: Start
more controversy. Make people mad. Hit
em with damning diatribes and harrowing
harangues and force them to admit their
own misguided thinking, whether on issues
of social, cultural, political or even Univer
sity policy.
But the fact of the matter is. 1 don't have
much to say in the sphere of ranting about
the Administration's oppressive policies.
This school is. of course, a large bureaucra
cy whose inner-workings are largely foreign
to me.
As a young undergrad. I'm but a small
cog in the large machine that is Stanford,
and a rather innocuous cog at that. Part of
the reason is my place of residence. Seeing
as I live off-campus (also known as Gover
nor's Corner), I'm not clued in to much of
the drama and intrigue that occurs over
there,on that Row. where I hear they throw
parties. Ma ha.
Really, though, it's just part of my lethar
gic nature to go with the flow, even when
fighting for social justice is the right thing to
do. Not that I am at all equipped with
enough substantive knowledge to launch
anything resembling a criticism against the
administration — 1 didn't even know what
the acronym OSA stood for until last week.
Still. I'm not totally without a taste for
ranting. If it's the "sweeping, unjustified,
generalizations" game we're playing, I'm
always ready to fire away. But alas, the last
thing 1 want to do with my >S()0 words of
weekly wisdom is turn it into a venue for in
appropriate and out of-line libel that I can't
back up. if only out of concern for my. uh.
reputation?
Today might be an exception to that
rule. Franich. in all of his unholy ire. has in
spired me to let it all out. this pent up fury.
Inside this apathetic,politically disinterest
ed shell seethes a loathing more fiery than
the eternal flames of I lell. I am going to hit
you with all the bigotry 1 can muster.
I hate the Collo.
Contrary to what appears to be the
unanimous belief of the entire Stanford
community, the C 'oho is not a good thing. In
fact, it's a very bad. bad thing — a down
right evil institution.
Why. ask you latte-loving socialites.
Maybe because it tries to exude a sense of
hip. indie urbaneness when it's trapped in a
location whose very essence is yuppie sub
urbia. It's the Stanford Coffee House. It's
not. and can never be. edgy.
Then again, this isn't quite fair. It's so
easy for me to attack the Col lo on superfi
cial grounds: for playing whatever lame al
ternative rock music the kids are into these

days, for having lots of comfy chairs on
which to recline and sip said lattes, or for
having enough power outlets to supply
electrical juice to the entire population of
Macbook-toting entrepreneurs in Silicon
Valley. I can't judge a place on its furniture
and ambient music selection alone. My
frustrations are more deeply rooted than
that.
Let me explain.
One of my best friends is a creative
writer, and a very good one at that. On
those lazy Sunday mornings when I'm
ready to hit up the second floor cubicles at
Green. I sometimes ask her if she wants to
come with. Invariably, I get responses like
this: "But I can't go to the library...that
place depresses me. 1 need to go to Collo,
you know. That place is alive with people
and energy and it's everything I need to
write creatively. 1 feed off the people there
its a comforting environment. Green, on
the other hand, is isolating and cold and de
pressing and..." — Ok. I GET IT. I'll just go
and be antisocial in the library because I'm
actually trying to do REAL work, and you
can "go to Col lo" and have a party. "Go to
Col lo." What is that?
Its the fact that many people actually do
work at Col lo that bothers me the most —
more so than its function as gossip central:
college version. I can't comprehend how
people actually manage to be productive in
an environment as chaotic and, frankly,
loud as the Co Ho. The amazing fact of the
matter is that some people actually do more
than yap about last night's Sigma Nu party
and even, like my friend the writer, thrive in
such environments.
My basic inability to do anything even
resembling work with throngs of caffeine
junkies chit-chattering around me is frus
trating: out of jealousy or not,the CoHo has
me seething with a furor irrational enough
to put down in an English 90 piece.
What's the point of this column, then?
I'm not exactly tackling social issues or
campaigning for human rights. At best, it's a
call to solidarity for us Green library sol
diers, who scoff at the idea of nibbling on
crepes and listening to (insert indie band
here) while doing homework. Yes. we are
strong. You are weak.
In the end I'm reallyjust expressing exas
peration, and not-so-subtly masking it as a
"rant." I'm not fooling anyone here — this
was no harangue. Everyone I know is pro-
Col lo but me. It's a Stanford institution that
I will never understand. I bet all of you read
ing this column like the CoHo.Typical.
Please let me in on the secret, I'm all
alone.

In Pursuit of the Epic
As you might imagine, I love reading
the opinions page. When I see cam
pus heroes like Darren Franich pro
duce such vituperative masterworks as his
latest invective against Nanci I lowe, 1 he
come thrilled, for these attacks at people in
high places confirm for me that below its
placid surface, "stuff" really happens at
Stanford University.
And I often feel like ranting myself, giv
ing the proverbial Man a piece of my mind.
You couldn 't imagine how many of my idiot
friends feel the same way, egging me on to
turn this column into a serious forum for di
atribe. I've got one option, they say: Start
more controversy. Make people mad. Hit
em with damning diatribes and harrowing
harangues and force them to admit their
own misguided thinking, whether on issues
of social, cultural, political or even Univer
sity policy.
But the fact of the matter is. 1 don't have
much to say in the sphere of ranting about
the Administration's oppressive policies.
This school is. of course, a large bureaucra
cy whose inner-workings are largely foreign
to me.
As a young undergrad. I'm but a small
cog in the large machine that is Stanford,
and a rather innocuous cog at that. Part of
the reason is my place of residence. Seeing
as I live off-campus (also known as Gover
nor's Corner), I'm not clued in to much of
the drama and intrigue that occurs over
there,on that Row. where I hear they throw
parties. Ma ha.
Really, though, it's just part of my lethar
gic nature to go with the flow, even when
fighting for social justice is the right thing to
do. Not that I am at all equipped with
enough substantive knowledge to launch
anything resembling a criticism against the
administration — 1 didn't even know what
the acronym OSA stood for until last week.
Still. I'm not totally without a taste for
ranting. If it's the "sweeping, unjustified,
generalizations" game we're playing, I'm
always ready to fire away. But alas, the last
thing 1 want to do with my >S()0 words of
weekly wisdom is turn it into a venue for in
appropriate and out of-line libel that I can't
back up. if only out of concern for my. uh.
reputation?
Today might be an exception to that
rule. Franich. in all of his unholy ire. has in
spired me to let it all out. this pent up fury.
Inside this apathetic,politically disinterest
ed shell seethes a loathing more fiery than
the eternal flames of I lell. I am going to hit
you with all the bigotry 1 can muster.
I hate the Collo.
Contrary to what appears to be the
unanimous belief of the entire Stanford
community, the C 'oho is not a good thing. In
fact, it's a very bad. bad thing — a down
right evil institution.
Why. ask you latte-loving socialites.
Maybe because it tries to exude a sense of
hip. indie urbaneness when it's trapped in a
location whose very essence is yuppie sub
urbia. It's the Stanford Coffee House. It's
not. and can never be. edgy.
Then again, this isn't quite fair. It's so
easy for me to attack the Col lo on superfi
cial grounds: for playing whatever lame al
ternative rock music the kids are into these

days, for having lots of comfy chairs on
which to recline and sip said lattes, or for
having enough power outlets to supply
electrical juice to the entire population of
Macbook-toting entrepreneurs in Silicon
Valley. I can't judge a place on its furniture
and ambient music selection alone. My
frustrations are more deeply rooted than
that.
Let me explain.
One of my best friends is a creative
writer, and a very good one at that. On
those lazy Sunday mornings when I'm
ready to hit up the second floor cubicles at
Green. I sometimes ask her if she wants to
come with. Invariably, I get responses like
this: "But I can't go to the library...that
place depresses me. 1 need to go to Collo,
you know. That place is alive with people
and energy and it's everything I need to
write creatively. 1 feed off the people there
its a comforting environment. Green, on
the other hand, is isolating and cold and de
pressing and..." — Ok. I GET IT. I'll just go
and be antisocial in the library because I'm
actually trying to do REAL work, and you
can "go to Col lo" and have a party. "Go to
Col lo." What is that?
Its the fact that many people actually do
work at Col lo that bothers me the most —
more so than its function as gossip central:
college version. I can't comprehend how
people actually manage to be productive in
an environment as chaotic and, frankly,
loud as the Co Ho. The amazing fact of the
matter is that some people actually do more
than yap about last night's Sigma Nu party
and even, like my friend the writer, thrive in
such environments.
My basic inability to do anything even
resembling work with throngs of caffeine
junkies chit-chattering around me is frus
trating: out of jealousy or not,the CoHo has
me seething with a furor irrational enough
to put down in an English 90 piece.
What's the point of this column, then?
I'm not exactly tackling social issues or
campaigning for human rights. At best, it's a
call to solidarity for us Green library sol
diers, who scoff at the idea of nibbling on
crepes and listening to (insert indie band
here) while doing homework. Yes. we are
strong. You are weak.
In the end I'm reallyjust expressing exas
peration, and not-so-subtly masking it as a
"rant." I'm not fooling anyone here — this
was no harangue. Everyone I know is pro-
Col lo but me. It's a Stanford institution that
I will never understand. I bet all of you read
ing this column like the CoHo.Typical.
Please let me in on the secret, I'm all
alone.
