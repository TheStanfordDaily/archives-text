# Avoiding the evil eye
## 
### 
Ihad a midterm last week. I did the read
ing, looked over my notes, got a good
night's rest and even woke up early
enough to catch a quick, but nevertheless
nourishing, breakfast. Ihen I got to the room
and had a nervous breakdown. I had forgot
ten my lucky bracelet. I was doomed.
It was a Catch-22 situation. If I took my
chances without the bracelet, 1 would spend
the entire test fretting over its absence and
my resulting lack of luck, ultimately failing
miserably because of my strained nerves. If I
rushed home to retrieve the bracelet, not
only would I be terribly late, but I would add
another layer of bad luek to the situation.
Nothing brings calamity quite like returning
home for forgotten items. Of course. I could
combat the forces of fate by looking into a
mirror before leaving the dorm again. But
looking into mirrors only diminishes the
severity of the bad luck; it doesn't entirely
eliminate it.
After a few frantic moments of delibera
tion. I realized I was completely mad.
Being a perfectly rational, well-educated
Stanford student, you'd think I would scoff at
the very idea of a "lucky" bracelet. But noth
ing could be further from the truth. I can't
function unless I complete an intricate and
complex set of luck-ensuring rituals for each
facet of my daily life.
Before any test. I have to sleep with the
relevant books under my pillow, don my
lucky bracelet and safety pin and have at
least one person tell me "No fluff, no feath
ers," to which I must reply "Go to hell." (It's
the Russian version of "good luck.") Before
anyone leaves for a long journey, I make
everyone in the room sit down quietly for at
least 10 seconds. I then refrain from any kind

of cleaning activities (vacuuming, clearing
the clutter from the desk, taking out the
trash) until the traveler has safely reached his
destination. After accidentally making some
statement that may tempt fate. I not only
knock on wood but also make a spitting ges
ture three times over my left shoulder to
knock off the symbolic devil that resides
there.
One time freshman year. I found myself
sitting at the corner of a table and almost
started to cry when I realized the dreadful
mistake I had made. Any girl who sits at the
corner of a table won't get married for at
least seven years; sometimes longer (or
never), depending on the frequency with
which she sits at such unlucky spots.
I blame Russia for this neurosis.
Russian culture is steeped in weird super
stition and mysticism. Every word has some
hidden meaning, every gesture is a predic
tion, every event an omen. And all of this was
readily adopted by my mother, who prompt
ly transferred it to me.
As soon as my cognitive abilities began to
form, she ingrained within me the various
methods to avoid "the evil eye" — don't cel
ebrate birthdays before the actual day of
your birth, make sure no birds fly into your
windows and of course never cross the path
of a black cat. In case I do accidentally incur

the wrath of the eye, she recommends that I
take off my jacket starting with the right arm
and promptly put it back on starting with the
left. A surefire way to avoid hostility.
And just to make sure 1 could properly
understand the world around me, she taught
me the symbolism behind all seemingly acci
dental happenings. Dropping a knife, for ex
ample, is a clear sign that you will soon re
ceive a male visitor. A fork or spoon, on the
other hand, signifies that a woman is ap
proaching. If a cat washes its face, you'll cer
tainly receive some guests soon, but their
genders can't be predicted.
It wasn't until I started sharing some of
this knowledge with my friends that I real
ized it wasn't all universally accepted as fact.
But by that time, it was too late. Harboring
superstitions had become a habit I couldn't
break.
Being the irreligious, generally skeptical
person that I am. I now know that none of
these things actually make any kind of differ
ence in the metaphysical nature of the world,
but I can t help but abide by these mystical
rules. ITiere's something so comforting in the
rituals and habits that accompany supersti
tion. It's kind of like the comfort that comes
from being a "regular" at some coffee shop
or diner — coming in at the same time each
day. ordering the same drink and bagel and
exchanging the same mundane conversation
about the weather and the latest sale at
Nordstrom's with the waitress. Only instead
of eating bagels and talking about weather. I
wear lucky jewelry and spit on devils. It's a
Russian thing.
