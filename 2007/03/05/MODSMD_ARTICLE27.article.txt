## On 'Apartionalism': Nationalist Apartheid 
### EUGENE GU 
Apartheid is a strong word that should
never he used lightly. Racism and discrimina
tion rear their ugly heads in many countries
hut these crimes rarely, if ever, constitute
apartheid. However, the situation in the Is
raeli-occupied territories has become so ap
palling, the problem so dire, and global censure
so unanimous that it constitutes one of those
rare occasions where the use of such a strong
word is not only justified but also a matter of
truth and accuracy. It is our moral responsibil
ity to use such a word because understating the
situation and not calling it what it is for fear of

rebuttal does a great disservice to the Palestin
ian men, women, and children who must en
dure constant intimidation and assaults on
their basic dignity.
Many of Israel's violations in the Occupied
Territories fit the 'old school' definition of
apartheid.The use of military checkpoints, for
example, stifles the normal lives of Palestini
ans. Like the South African oppressors who
beat blacks for not carrying their work permits
and identifications, the Israeli military uses
checkpoints to hinder the ability of Palestini
ans to travel to work, visit family, or receive
emergency medical care. Although conducted
under the guise of national security, these

checkpoints are more than mere inconven
iences for the Palestinian people.They have lit
erally separated families, caused unnecessary
loss of life, and made a nation destitute. There
are even Jewish-only roads that bypass these
checkpoints and reinforce a two-tier system of
"separate but vastly unequal" â€” a system
which has long been the hallmark of South
African apartheid from 1948 to 1994.
Other violations include the "separation
barrier" that cuts through Palestinian territory,
the bulldozers that raze Palestinian homeland
a codified system of law that gives certain priv-
ileged groups more rights than others
to buy land and obtain citizenship.
As the International Court of Jus
tice declared in an advisory opinion,
the separation barrier foreshadows
Israel's intention to unilaterally de
fine its border in violation of Article 2.
paragraph 4. of the United Nations
Charter, which cites the illegality of
territorial acquisition through the use
of force. The wall and occupation in
frastructure has produced Palestinian
"bantustans" that are isolated from
each other, hold no true power, and
exist solely to appease the interna
tional community. Likewise, the bull
dozing of Palestinian homes in viola
tion of Article 53 of the Fourth Gene
va Convention and Article 50 of the
Hague Regulations parallels the way
the South African police raided and
destroyed black shantytowns. To
make matters worse. Israel actively
builds illegal settlements within Pales
tinian territory in contravention of
UN Resolution 242.
'ITie unequal system of codified
law, including the Law of Return and
the policies of the Israel Land Admin
istration (ILA), is reminiscent of the
laws in South Africa that gave more
rights to whites than blacks. More
specifically, the Law of Return allows
a Jew of any nationality to immediate
ly become an Israeli citizen upon set
ting foot in Israel.This policy is exac
erbated by the fact that Israel simulta
neously refuses to recognize the Right
of Return, known formally as UN
General Assembly Resolution 194,
which establishes the right of Pales
tinians, Jews and refugees of any race
to go back to the neighborhoods from
which they were forced to flee in the
1948 war. Israel may be hesitant to
comply with the UN resolution be
cause the millions of displaced Pales
tinians currently living in refugee
camps would shift the country's de
mographics. Perhaps that's why a Jew
from Brooklyn can step off a plane
and become an Israeli citizen but a
Palestinian mother of three cannot re
turn to the same neighborhood she
grew up in. If a state has to establish a
system of unequal laws, unequal
rights, and disproportionate military
force to preserve an ethno-religious
majority, it is practicing apartionalism:
nationalist apartheid.
I will concede, however, that there
are some fundamental differences be

tween the Israeli-occupied territories
and South Africa. One important dif
ference is that the Israeli treatment of
Palestinians is based upon a national
istic desire to secure more land and
maintain a Jewish majority than it is
based upon pure racism. Another dif
ference is that unlike the near univer
sal condemnation of South Africa by
the international community (Israel
was one of its only supporters), Amer
ica stands as an ardent supporter ol Is
rael on the international stage. Finally,
perhaps the most important differ
ence is that South Africa was blessed
with Nelson Mandela, a man who
used peaceful civil disobedience to at
tract world attention to his cause. Ihe
Middle East has not been so fortunate
and there have been morally repre
hensible suicide bombings in Israel
that have shocked the world commu
nity and engendered mistrust against
the Palestinians.
Not surprisingly, people appreci
ate Martin Luther King more than
Malcolm X and Frederick Douglass
more than John Brown. People tend
to give more credence to movements
empowered by non-violence. I low
ever, should we have supported the
genocide of Native Americans sim
ply because a minority of tribes mas
sacred and scalped innocent people
or written off the abolitionist move
ment because John Brown was vio
lent? I denounce the murder of inno
cent Israeli civilians by Palestinian
terrorists. But 1 refuse to ignore a
grave injustice simply because there
are bad individuals who commit
heinous crimes. Condemn the
crimes, yes. but don't prejudice
against the ordinary Palestinian. De
nounce the Palestinian suicide
bombers and radicals who refuse to
recognize Israel's right to exist. But
don't let those crimes justify
apartionalism in the occupied terri
tories.
Prominent voices like Jimmy
Carter, Desmond Tutu and Noam
Chomsky have condemned national
ist apartheid in Palestine. But you
don't have to take their word for it. If
you have the time, go to Google or
Green Library and research the mat
ter for yourself. Read impartial argu
ments from well-respected sources
like the Red Cross, the United Na
tions and Amnesty International.
Then decide what word is appropriate
to describe the situation in Occupied
Palestine.
