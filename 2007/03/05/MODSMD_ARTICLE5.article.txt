## Lokey gives $33 mil. to stem cells New building, resources planned for Institute for Stem Cell Research 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Lorry I. Lokey '49 is a multimil
lionaire who owns no fancy yachts or
private jets. So, instead of using the
$500 million he generated hist year
from selling Businesswire the San
Francisco-based company he found
ed in 1%1 —to purchase luxuries for
himself, l.okey has donated gener
ously in recent years to support edu
cation and scientific research.
His latest donation came last
week with a $33 million gift to the
Stanford Medical School, which will
help build a larger home for the Insti
tute for Stem Cell Research. Lokey
expressed hope that the new com
plex would allow Stanford re
searchers to capitalize on the stem
cell grants made possible by Prop. 71.
"Stem cell research is not taking
lives." Lokey said. "The most impor
tant factor about stem cell research is
that it will save lives."
While acknowledging that stem
cell research would probably not
produce any medical miracles in the
immediate future. Lokey, who was
editor of The Daily in 1949, ex
pressed hope that stem cell research
would extend the lives of his chil
dren.
"'lbis is the beginning of serious
stem cell research by Stanford."
Lokey said. "It's something that's
hardly begun, compared to what
we'll see ten years from now. You and
I were a lot younger when high-tech
got going and that's ten or twenty
years ago. We're going into an era of
biotech."
"All over the country there are
laboratories on stem cell research,"
he added. "It's something that Stan
ford has just got to get into."
Medical School administrators
called Lokey's gilt important for
stem cell research at Stanford.
"The wonderful gift by Lorry
Lokey will enable us to move for
ward with our plans for the Stanford
Institute of Medicine I building
which will he dedicated to stem cell
research and regenerative medi
cine." Medical School Dean Philip
Pi/zo said in an email to The Daily.
"We have been fortunate in re
cruiting a number of outstanding
new investigators in stem cell biolo
gy to join [...] the Medical School,"
he added. "[The donation] will en
able us to continue developing our
basic research programs and attract
ing other leading investigators to
Stanford."
According to Irving Weissman,
the director of the Med School's In
stitute for Stem Cell Research, the
Institute has begun to pursue four
avenues of research — adult tissue
stem cells, cancer stem cells, human
embryonic stem cells and nuclear
transfer stem cells.
Nuclear transfer stem cells. Weiss
man said, are at the cutting-edge of
biotechnology. Created when the nu
cleus of a normal skin cell is inserted
into an eee. nuclear transfer cells

have not yet been developed in hu
mans, but the technique has worked
on mice.
"It is impossible today to repro
gram a skin cell from someone with
Lou Gehrig's disease but it can be
done with mice," Weissman said. "If
we want to be able to get embryonic
like stem cells and use it to study dis
ease, we have to make those cells
trom people who have certain dis
eases."
In the future, these cells might
help scientists to better understand
diseases like Lou Gehrig's, diabetes
and even leukemia if funding were
made available, Weissman said.
On Aug. 9, 2001, President
George W. Bush restricted the use of
lederal funds in stem cell research to
lines of cells which had already been
created, effectively preventing work
on nuclear transfer and human em
bryonic stem cells. In 2004. Califor
nia's Prop. 71 made state funding
available for stem cell research, but
the proposition was quickly held up
in the courts.
In the latest move. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger made an advance

loan of $150 million so that the first
research grants could be awarded in
the next year. Coupled with private
donations, this funding could poten
tially produce groundbreaking stem
cell research over the next decade.
Lokey's donation also marks the
beginning of an effort to fund a new
building complex in the Medical
School, which Pizzo outlined in a
Dec. 4 announcement.
Lokey said that he also plans to
donate toother academic institutions
in the near future — including the
University of Oregon, Mills College,
theTechnion-lsrael Institute of Tech
nology and Santa Clara University.
As far as his alma mater goes, Lokey
has also pledged money to help build
a new building for The Daily.
Lokey said that all of the educa
tional institutions he has supported
had exciting programs that simply
needed money to get off the ground.
"It's great to move in and be a
lead donor," Lokey said. "It's more
exciting than owning a jet plane."
