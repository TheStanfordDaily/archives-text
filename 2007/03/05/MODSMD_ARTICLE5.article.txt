## Lokey gives $33 mil. to stem cells New building, resources planned for Institute for Stem Cell Research 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Lorry I. Lokey '49 is a multimil
lionaire who owns no fancy yachts or
private jets. So, instead of using the
$500 million he generated hist year
from selling Businesswire the San
Francisco-based company he found
ed in 1%1 â€”to purchase luxuries for
himself, l.okey has donated gener
ously in recent years to support edu
cation and scientific research.
His latest donation came last
week with a $33 million gift to the
Stanford Medical School, which will
help build a larger home for the Insti
tute for Stem Cell Research. Lokey
expressed hope that the new com
plex would allow Stanford re
searchers to capitalize on the stem
cell grants made possible by Prop. 71.
"Stem cell research is not taking
lives." Lokey said. "The most impor
tant factor about stem cell research is
that it will save lives."
While acknowledging that stem
cell research would probably not
produce any medical miracles in the
immediate future. Lokey, who was
editor of The Daily in 1949, ex
pressed hope that stem cell research
would extend the lives of his chil
dren.
"'lbis is the beginning of serious
stem cell research by Stanford."
Lokey said. "It's something that's
hardly begun, compared to what
we'll see ten years from now. You and
I were a lot younger when high-tech
got going and that's ten or twenty
years ago. We're going into an era of
biotech."
"All over the country there are
laboratories on stem cell research,"
he added. "It's something that Stan
ford has just got to get into."
Medical School administrators
called Lokey's gilt important for
stem cell research at Stanford.
"The wonderful gift by Lorry
Lokey will enable us to move for

Institute of Medicine I building
which will he dedicated to stem cell
research and regenerative medi
