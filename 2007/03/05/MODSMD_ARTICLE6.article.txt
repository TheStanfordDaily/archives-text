## Gender gap spurs questions 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Haydee Moreno — an aspiring
young businesswoman in New
York City — was not always into
fantasy football. March Madness
or loose-mouthed cursing. But four
years into an investment banking
career, Moreno found herself
changing. Not only had she begun
to dress more conservatively, she
had become more aggressive and
competitive and had stopped shar
ing personal stories with cowork
ers; they would not have under
stood her anyway — most of them
were men.
Now a second-year student at
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB), Moreno says that, while it
was never a conscious decision, she

took on a new personality as a re
sult of her career.
"Looking back. I definitely did
not feel comfortable," she said. "I
was trying to be more like them
and less like me."
THE GENDER GAP
Moreno's story is not an uncom
mon one among professional
women working in male-dominat
ed business industries. While
women have made great strides in
many disciplines, individuals asso
ciated with the (iSB suggested that
they have lagged in business.
Women comprise only 15.6 per
cent of corporate officers at I or
tune 500 companies, according to
Catalyst, a gender think-tank.
At Stanford, women represent
32 percent of GSB students — a
number significantly lower than
the 47 percent female student bod
ies of the Law and Medical
Schools. Women make up 4K per
cent of the Stanford undergradu

ate population; nationwide, sft per
cent of college students are
women, according to the I J.S. Cen
sus Bureau.
The dearth of women at the
GSB and other business schools
across the country can he attrib
uted to several determinants, ac
cording to Assistant Director of
GSB Admissions Lisa Giannan
geli. ranging from the lack of fe
male role models in business to low
numbers of female business school
applicants.
"According to some of the most
recent GMAT data, women ac
count for approximately 38 per
cent of the [entrance] tests taken."
(iiannangeli said.
Lauren Struck, a second-year
student at the GSB. noted that the
similarity between this number
and the 32 percent female GSB in
dicates thiit women who strive to
go to business school can succeed.
