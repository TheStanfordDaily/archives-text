# Friedman confronts green challenge
## 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three-time Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author and journalist Thomas
Friedman called for a new way of
thinking about energy policy on Fri
day, underscoring the growing envi
ronmental. economic and political
consequences of America's reliance
on fossil fuels.
"We don't have an energy policy
in this country" the New York Times
columnist and self-described "geo
green" told a packed Memorial Au
ditorium crowd. "We have energy
politics in this country."
Friedman's speech was the
keynote address of Stanford's inau
gural tnergy Crossroads, a three
day student-run conference intend
ed to foster interdisciplinary collabo
ration on clean energy I lis address
generally mirrored the tone of the
conference and reflected many fa
miliar themes from his columns and

books.
"Green Ikis to be green," he said.
"It has to be profitable. It also has to
be seen as strategic. That's why I say
green is the new red, white and blue.
It isn't just some little boutique thing.
It's central to our economy's ability
to grow and our ability to defend
ourselves globally."
Friedman, whose biweekly for
eign policy columns for The Times
are syndicated to 7(H) newspapers
worldwide, postulated that "a perfect
storm called l >/11.1 lurricane katrina
and the Internet revolution"brought
the environment into the national
consciousness and suggested that
"green has gone Main Street" thanks
to growing unease about national se
curity. natural disasters and global
economic competitiveness.
A former Middle Fast correspon
dent. Friedman said the United
States' reliance on imported fossil
fuels has funded both sides of the
war on terror, because it hasempow

ered the region's oil-rich autocrats.
Based on what he called "the First
Law of Petropolitics," Friedman said
that rising oil prices have allowed
Middle Eastern leaders to rule with
out accountability and to erode dem
ocratic institutions.
Although he said he considers
himself an optimist, Friedman
stressed that the challenge of curbing
carbon dioxide emissions was bigger
than most Americans believed. Pre
venting the doubling of carbon diox
ide in the atmosphere — and the po
tentially perilous climate change that
would ensue — "will require the
biggest industrial project mankind
has ever undertaken."
"I'm not talking about buying a
I'rius." he deadpanned.
To spur this undertaking, Fried
man noted, business leaders will
need the right incentives to make
clean energy a priority.

In the keynote address for the student-run Energy Crossroads, three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Thomas
Friedman discussed the economic incentives needed to promote global environmentalism in the 21st century.
"You can only get green down
Main Street if you can leverage Wall
Street," he s;uii"l don't think we have
to radically change our lifestyle, but
we have to radically change the way
we do business around energy."
Ihese changes would first need to
stem from government regulations,
Friedman said, praising Germany's
efforts to stimulate solar energy in
vestment as well as California's abili
ty to grow economically without in
creasing its carbon output.
"God bless California," he said.
"What California is doing should be
federal legislation."
But inventing and implementing
clean energy solutions in the United
States alone is not the complete an
swer, according to Friedman, who said
that making green energy feasible to
the rapidly growing economies of
India and China is a must.
"We could have all the rules in this
country t< > have clean air, no CQ2, but
if there's no rules in ( liina. and China
is the second largest CO2 emitter in
I lie world, on its way to being number
one, what have we done?" he said.
"Our challenge is to get green down
to the China price."
Friedman expressed skepticism
about ethanol as a viable solution, de
spite the growing number of promi
nent politicians singing its praises.
"How do we get industry at scale?
We don't do it by farming ethanol in
lowa." he said. "It absolutely makes
zero economic sense."
But Friedman did not single out
the federal government as the sole
culprit for the United States' slow re
sponse to the threat posed by climate
change.
"Where's the million person
march for a green America?" he
asked.
For their part, the students behind
the Energy Crossroads conference
said that Stanford should play a signif
icant role in the push for green ener
gy. Fnergy Crossroads, they said, was
to be the first shot in an ongoing bat
tle against America's dependence on
fossil fuels.
"We really want Stanford to be a

leader." said Tyler I iuebner, a gradu
ate student in civil and environmenta
engineering. "This is a call from stu
dents to the University."
The conference's organizers ex
pressed optimism that Fnergy ( toss
roads will become an annual meeting
of the world's best minds on global
energy issues.
"We think this is the future," said
Management Science and I ngineer
ing Prof. John Weyant, direetoi ol
Stanford's Fnergy Modeling Forum,
who moderated a Friday panel on the
economics of energy efficiency.

I he File rg\ ( rossroads promoters
can take solace,then, in having friends
in high places. President John Hen
nessN gave the introductory remarks
loi Friedman's address, and said that
climate change posed "a formidable
challenge."
Hie challenge of global warm
ing. he said, "could not only destroy
our world but also destroy the envi
ronment of all known to live here."
