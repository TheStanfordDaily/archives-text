# Friedman confronts green challenge
## 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three-time Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author and journalist Thomas
Friedman called for a new way of
thinking about energy policy on Fri
day, underscoring the growing envi
ronmental. economic and political
consequences of America's reliance
on fossil fuels.
"We don't have an energy policy
in this country" the New York Times
columnist and self-described "geo
green" told a packed Memorial Au
ditorium crowd. "We have energy
politics in this country."
Friedman's speech was the
keynote address of Stanford's inau
gural tnergy Crossroads, a three
day student-run conference intend
ed to foster interdisciplinary collabo
ration on clean energy I lis address
generally mirrored the tone of the
conference and reflected many fa
miliar themes from his columns and

books.
"Green Ikis to be green," he said.
"It has to be profitable. It also has to
be seen as strategic. That's why I say
green is the new red, white and blue.
It isn't just some little boutique thing.
It's central to our economy's ability
to grow and our ability to defend
ourselves globally."
Friedman, whose biweekly for
eign policy columns for The Times
are syndicated to 7(H) newspapers
worldwide, postulated that "a perfect
storm called l >/11.1 lurricane katrina
and the Internet revolution"brought
the environment into the national
consciousness and suggested that
"green has gone Main Street" thanks
to growing unease about national se
curity. natural disasters and global
economic competitiveness.
A former Middle Fast correspon
dent. Friedman said the United
States' reliance on imported fossil
fuels has funded both sides of the
war on terror, because it hasempow

ered the region's oil-rich autocrats.
Based on what he called "the First
Law of Petropolitics," Friedman said
that rising oil prices have allowed
Middle Eastern leaders to rule with
out accountability and to erode dem
ocratic institutions.
Although he said he considers
himself an optimist, Friedman
stressed that the challenge of curbing
carbon dioxide emissions was bigger
than most Americans believed. Pre
venting the doubling of carbon diox
ide in the atmosphere — and the po
tentially perilous climate change that
would ensue — "will require the
biggest industrial project mankind
has ever undertaken."
"I'm not talking about buying a
I'rius." he deadpanned.
To spur this undertaking, Fried
man noted, business leaders will
need the right incentives to make
clean energy a priority.
