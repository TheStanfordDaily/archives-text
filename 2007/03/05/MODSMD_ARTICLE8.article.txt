## Bernanke returns to Stanford

PALO ALTO,Calif. — Evoking a fa
miliar theme. Federal Reserve Chair

man Ben Bernanke
said Friday the United
States will face a
major crisis unless the
federal government
eases the looming
economic strain of
paying Social Security
and other benefits to
aging baby boomers.
As things currcntlv

stand. Social Security. Medicare and
Medicaid obligations will devour 15
percent of the gross domestic product in
2030. up from about 8.5 percent this

year, Bernanke told an economic
summit held at Stanford University.
"II we don't do something about
this, we will have to eliminate the
armed forces and everything the
government does. It clearly is not
sustainable." Bernanke said in re
sponse to a question.
Now in his second year running
the Fed. Bernanke already has urged
Congress to tackle the thorny issue
of how to cover Social Security ben
efits for the millions of baby
boomers who will be retiring during
the next 20 years. Taking care of
those retirees will likely require
steep tax increases or dramatic ben
efit decreases to avoid plunging the
nation even deeper into debt.
Bernanke made his appearance
just a few hours after the United

States stock market suffered its
worst week in more than four years
amid intensifying concerns that the
economies in both the United States
and China are weakening simultane
ously. He did not address the turmoil
in his prepared remarks, and was not
asked about it when he took several
questions after his speech.
In an appearance before Con
gress earlier in the week, Bernanke
helped allay investor fears by saying
he expected moderate growth for
the remainder of this year.
Returning to a campus where he
taught economics early in his career,
Bernanke on Friday devoted most of
his talk explaining why globalization
hasn't hobbled the Federal Re
serve's ability to influence economic
activity at home by lowering or rais
ing interest rates.

The Fed had steadily boosted
rates for two years to fend off infla
tion. With economic growth slowing
and some signs that inflation is im
proving, the Fed has left rates alone
since August. Many economists
think the Fed will leave rates where
they are for much of this year. Wall
Street investors predict the Fed's
next move will be a rate cut — per
haps later this year.
One of the Fed's main jobs is to
make sure that inflation doesn't get
out of hand.
"There seems to be little basis for
concluding that globalization overall
has significantly reduced inflation in
the United States in recent years,"
Bernanke said. "Indeed, the oppo
site may be true."
As the Fed seeks to keep inflation
and the economy on an even keel,
globalization has meant the Fed
must spend more time analyzing fi
nancial developments around the
world —as well as in the United
States.
