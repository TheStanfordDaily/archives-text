Mar. 4,1929:
On the inauguration of Herbert
Hoover '95 (1895, that is), former
University president David Starr
Jordan described him thus:
"'Every move in President
I ioover's administration will be wise
and fully thought out. There is not a
streak of selfishness or recklessness
in I loover. He is not partisan and he
would not do anything crooked to
save any party from defeat. Hoover is
like Lincoln in that he never enters
any situation without clear recogni
tion and estimation of all of its diffi
culties.'"
ITiis clear-eyed, visionary prog
nosis regarding the Farm's only
President was followed by an even I
more accurate prophecy:
'"The eighteenth amendment
can never be reversed,' declared Dr.
Jordan."
I lindsight.we suppose,is 20/20...
