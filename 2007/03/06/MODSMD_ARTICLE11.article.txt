## Rhodes scholar discusses life-changing work in Africa, favorite curse word 
### JESSICA RICHMAN 
Julie Veroff'o7 was announced in late No
vember 2006 as a Rhodes Scholar, along with
Ciinger Turner *05 and Jacob Lemieux "07. and
will be attending Oxford next fall.
Why did you tome to Stanford? I was really
conflicted about choosing a college, but in the
end, Stanford won out over UC Berkeley be
cause something about Stanford made me feel
like I could achieve great things, not just get a
great education. I think this is rooted in the in
dividual attention, plethora of opportunities
and encouragement to create new ones for my
self if the ones I want don't currently exist.
Hon did you choose your major? I had
done a lot of speech and debate and Model
United Nations in high school and was really
interested in international issues, and so I came
into Stanford thinking 1 would be an 1R or
PoliSci major. Then during freshman year I
bounced back and forth between history and
feminist studies, and at the end of the year, de
cided to go back to 1R and. within the context
of a course load that was international in scope,
pursue the issues like women's rights that 1 had
gotten so interested in within the other disci
plines.
What activities were/are you involved in? 1
tried out many things at Stanford, but the activ

ities 1 have learned the most from are:
FORGE, Camp Kesem, Hillel at Stanford. Al
ternative Spring Break in Nicaragua, working
at the State Department while at Stanford in
Washington and tutoring at an elementary
school in DC. [Other] activities I have enjoyed
a lot: playing the flute, taking the time to have
those late-night conversations that challenge
your world view and add to who you are.
What do you do over the summer last year,
and why? Last summer. I went to Zambia with
FORGE to work in Mwange Refugee Camp
and establish and facilitate a women's leader
ship and empowerment initiative. My under
standing of my own motivations, needs, and per
sonal growth are much more complex now that
1 have returned, and my sense of how to make
change in the world is fundamentally different.
My original motivations for going were proba
bly to return to Africa (1 had been in Ghana the
summer before), have an adventure, challenge
myself to do something 1 never thought 1 could
do. and work in partnership with a marginalized
community through a program that 1 could put
my own passions into but that responded di
rectly to their self-identified needs.
()f the honors you have earned, which ones
mean the most to you? While at Stanford, the
biggest honor that 1 have received is a Rhodes
Scholarship. I'm thrilled and excited and over

whelmed. It's funny, though - while I'm hon
ored to have received the award, it is not some
thing that defines me. 1 usually try to avoid
telling people about it. I'd much rather talk to
people about the activities I've been involved
in and the beliefs and passions I've developed,
and also hear about what drives them so we can
grow and learn together.
What are you most proud of? My cousin El
liott is 10 and he had to do a report for school
on his role model and he chose me. 1 cried and
then tried to pretend I wasn't because other
people were in the room and I get really em
barrassed about that kind of thing. But it was
incredibly touching and I think about it every
time I have a bad day.
What <lo you love (or hate) about Stanford?
I love the deep desire for knowledge and learn
ing that thrives here. I love being in classes
where professors call their students to action. 1
love that it is beautiful outside, and that we
have enough space to actually be outside and
not cooped up in a high-rise.
What is your favorite novel? East of Eden
by John Steinback. But there are lots that all tie
for second place.
What is your favorite curse word? I tend to
add "face" to every possible insult: jerkface,
buttface, stupidface, etc. It's kind of immature.
But it makes me happy.
