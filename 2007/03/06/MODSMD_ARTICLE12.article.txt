## Editorial Board Framing the debate 
### 
t I ihere are a surprisingly large number
ofASSU Executive slates petitioning
JL for a spot on the ballot this year: five,
up from last year's three.The increased elec
toral competition comes as the ASSU is fac
ing. to a large degree, a crisis of credibility:
students have complained about a variety of
student life issues, including party policies,
the practices of the ()ffice of Student Activ
ities (OSA), and the controversy surround
ing the long-term probation of the Band.
Even worse, many students feel distanced
from the ASSU and do not understand what
it does and what it does not do — an igno
rance reflected by the increase in slates with
an anti-ASSI I message this year.
Election season does not begin until next
quarter, but four slates — Brett and Laksh
mi. Avula/Jones, the Warm Weather Party,
and Submit — have already begun to artic
ulate their visions for the ASSI) next year, a
development which we welcome. ITie elec
tion season, when it begins in the spring,
should be marked by a focus on substantive
issues, rather than on mobilizing constituen
cies and interest groups.
We would like to see candidates address
the following issues, which are of prime im
portance to the University and the student
body.
-The ASSU's credibility gap. Skepticism
about the power and effectiveness of the
ASSU to address student concerns is wide
spread. and the executive slates need to
present how they will be more effective ad
vocates for students.
-Old Union. The remodeling of the building

has been controversial, and current Presi
dent Elizabeth Heng addressed it in her
midyear "State of the ASSU" speech. Stu
dent input during construction appears to
have been cosmetic at best, but we hold out
hope that next year's executives will be able
to provide student input on the building's
usage.
-The OSA. Under the guidance of Nanci
Howe, the OSA has inspired a considerable
amount of controversy among the student
body. At least one executive slate has for
warded harsh criticisms of the office. I"he
ASSU has not recognized student discon
tent on this issue, and future executives will
need to work with the administration to
make the OSA more responsive. Fraterni
ties especially are upset, as the OSA has
been more restrictive on party-naming con
ventions and party-planning rules.
-Divestment. Hie Senate will be voting
today on a resolution advocating divest
ment from Israel, and even if the resolution
fails, the issue will not go away. The ASSU
Senate is charged with representing stu
dents, and it will face similar Israeli-Pales
tinian issues again next year. The President
and Vice President, however, are the chief
advocates of the student interest and are
also the main shapers of overall ASSU poli
cy.
An issue-driven campaign will go a long
way toward improving the ASSU and align
ing it closer to the needs of students. We call
upon all the executive slates to address the
issues during the upcoming campaign sea
son.
