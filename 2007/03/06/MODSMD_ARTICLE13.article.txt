# God, I love it when you violate me

### 
Hello there, beloved citizenry! I m the
Fundamental Standard, everyone's
favorite abstract concept, vaguely
codifying the laws of Stanford University
since 18%. Back then, the worst offenses 1
had to deal with were fraternity gadflies in
haling raw ether and naughty co-eds skip
ping curfew to gallivant through the gin
dens of ()ld Palo Alto. Nowadays, every two
minutes there's another little rascal trying
to violate me like I'm some two-dollar har
lot. I assumed it was because college stu
dents today are worse than ever, a caravan
full of loutish drunks and stuck-up brats
who think they're too good to abide by me.
At least, that's what my good friend John al
ways said.
But a few months ago, I started experi
encing severe pangs of depression and
self-doubt. I couldn't figure out what was
bothering me. Everything was going great.
I was keeping students safe from them
selves. Usually, the start of the year is filled
with dorm reunions and underground par
ties and all sorts of unregistered fun, but
this year was blessedly quiet. Even Full
Moon on the Quad didn't violate me very
much. Which was kind of disappointing, I
guess. Sometimes it felt good to be violat
ed.
I think it really started when the Judicial
Board made another troublesome freshman
sign a contract saying that he wouldn't touch
a drop of alcohol until he turned 21.1 asked
John. "Doesn't that seem a little bit unlike
ly? After all, isn't drinking one of the central
tenets of college culture?"
"It's just a liability thing," John ex
plained. "It's easier for us to avoid litigation
if we outlaw anything that's potentially dan
gerous. We wouldn't want to lose any money
in a lawsuit. Whoops!" he said, spilling stock
options all over the table.
"But aren't most fun things potentially
dangerous?" 1 asked "I mean,you might get
injured playing basketball, but that doesn't
mean basketball's not fun."
John's brow furrowed."! hadn't thought
of that. Basketball is a clear violation of you.
We'll have to start regulating all pick-up
games on campus." I le lit a Cuban cigar with
a thousand dollar bill. "We'll require stu
dents to fill out several dozen binding legal
forms. That should discourage most of
them."
"John." I said. "What am I? What is the
Fundamental Standard?"
"Don't be silly. Ihe Fundamental Stan
dard is the Fundamental Standard."
"No, but 1 mean what am I, exactly? Am
I in writing? Or am I one of those things that
people just make up as they go along, like
the English Constitution?'
John shrugged."! don't know. I 'm just the
president."
So I looked myself up online and. what
do you know. I am in writing! My first sen
tence is real good, too: "Students at Stanford
are expected to show both within and with
out the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of

others as is demanded of good citizens."
Nothing to argue with there. Morality is
cool.
Then 1 got to my second sentence: "Fail
ure to do this will be sufficient cause for re
moval from the University."
According to me, if a Stanford student
doesn't live an upstanding life of perfect
moral decency, they can get kicked out of
school."Golly Moses." 1 said,"l'm kind of an
asshole!"
John chuckled. "'lTiat's just a formality.
We only kick out the bad ones."
"But how can you tell which ones are the
bad ones?"
"We look at them on a case-by-case basis.
That's what you're for. We hold you over our
students to protect them from the rain, and
then we stab them in the back with you if
they get wet. You're like an umbrella with a
bayonet."
"If you handle everything on a case-bv
case basis, then why even have a Fundamen
tal Standard?"
"It's a liability thing. You're kind of a sec
ular religion, and like any good religion,
you're general enough to apply to every
thing and vague enough to apply to any
thing we want. II a fight breaks out. you're
there. If an upperclassman gives a freshman
a beer, you're there. If the Band does any
thing, you're there."
"That doesn't sound very democratic." I
said. "Maybe instead of one generic, one
size-fits-all Standard, we should create an
ongoing, ever-evolving dialectic system, stu
dents and administrators together! A Fun
damental Dialogue!"
John patted me on the head and said "1
value your input."Then he went to play golf
in Dubai.
