It is needless to say that Jacques was the
envy of every frenchman as he strolled
through Paris along the Champs d'Klysee
toward his apartment. It was impossible, for
example, for passersby not to envy his gentle
man's handbag, which was woven with sustain
ably-grown hemp, and which rivaled even the
supplest of Prada leather man-purses. It was
also impossible not to appreciate Jacques'
enormous baguette, which was clearly deli
cious and made entirely of organic ingredients.
Jacques took the familiar route home, his
entirely leather-free shoes sounding authori
tative footsteps that rang along the cobbles
and reverberated through the streets, practi
cally shouting to the world. "Here comes a
man who does not own a car! I lere comes a
man who transports himself entirely on foot
and by bicycle! Here comes a man commit
ted to a sustainable future for our Earth!"
Jacques grinned a happy grin. I le thought
of the gorgeous Jeanette. waiting in their pent
house apartment, which was tastefully fur
nished according to a calculated postmodern
aesthetic and had windows that were just big
enough to provide a devastatingly gorgeous
view of the 7th Arrondissement. and just small
enough to make the building energy-efficient.
Rounding the corner of his street, Jacques
looked up to the porch of his penthouse apart
ment to see ...was it? Yes.it could Ix.- no one else.
No one else could possibly be 5 feet and 5 inch
es of perfect heaven. It was Jeanette. Ah. how
her hair sparkled as she stood there in their or
ganic home herb garden.
"How did your hair become so shiny and
sleek, mon cher?" cried Jacques to Jeanette.
Brushing pesticide-free leaves away from her
face, Jeanette leaned over the balcony and
called to Jacques in a voice that was no more
than a guttural whisper, but which neverthe

less arrived quite audibly in Jacques' ear canal,
saying. "It must be my new organic shampoo
which is not tested on animals!"
"Ah!" thought Jacques to himself, tunning
his lingers through his own impeccable mane
of chestnut brown hair." 11 all makes le sense."
he whispered, foi he too used organic sham
poo which was not tested on animals.
It was not possible foi a man to run taster
than Jacques did as he scaled the seven sets of
stairs leading to his penthouse apartment,
eager beyond all eagerness to see Jeanette
once again. He arrived panting at the door,
which Jeanette threw open before he could
even knock.
"You are panting," Jeanette said, while
furtively eyeing the firm ligidity of Jacques"
baguette.
"Oui, mon amour,' confessed Jacques.
"And what's more. I jlist ran up seven flights of
stairs."
"You did not take ze elevator?" whispered
Jeanette.
"Ah non.mon cheiie."said Jacques.sweep
ing through the dootway. hemp-bag in hand." I
take risks in love,and I take tisks in the world
of corporate finance, but I would never take
risks with energy use."
Jeanette swooned a delighted swoon.
"What is it you have in youi bag. mon
cher?" asked Jeanette. for Jacques' sack was
bulging impressively.
"It is only a few things I have picked up at
ze market," he replied, pulling an I nergy Star
light bulb out of his man-purse.
"It's so powerful." Jeanette gasped, as she
glanced at the wattage of Jacques'compact flu
orescent light bulb.
"I know. And over ze bulb's lifetime, it will
save us over 30 euros." murmured Jacques as

seemed to.lacquestobe the best smell in all the
world.
"We had bettei scicw it in soon," said
Jeanette. giasping the bulb ti<>hll\ Jacques
nodded his consent.
Reaching into his man puise once again,
Jacques pulled out an envelope.
"Is II ..7 asl,ed Jeanette, haidly daring to
believe.
"Yes." answered Jacques,"it is an envelope
made ol KM) pel cent post consumer recycled
paper. Hut look inside. I here's more.
Jeanette toie open the envelope and pulled
out a single sheet of paper.
"Double sided," Jeanette whispered.
"Bien sui." answered Jacques.
Aiul indeed the double sided sheet of
paper, which Jacques had piintcd at his office
using a caitiidgc that he latei iccycled. was a
love lettei a love letter to Jeanette. She was
overcome with joy. Once she had lead both
sides ol the papet and collected herself,
Jeanette could only think to whispei. "You
know what thc\ s.in Small carbon footprint,
big..."

answered Jacques.
It was in a cloud ol lustlul bliss that Jacques
and Jeanette settled down to their organically
grown dinnei inadeentiielv with locally grown
produce. Ihe conveisation was so smooth and
the organic lood so delicious that dinner
passed in what seemed like an instant. As
Jacques imsed and recycled the plastic con
tainers that their salad mix had been sold in,he
bioke the news to Jeanette that he had turned
off the heat.
"But 111011 cliei!" she cried,"lt is ze dead of

like ze poor heroine in I a Boheme!"

Jacques grinned. It was onl\ appiopriatc that a
carbon conscious man such as himselt should
be involved with an incredibly intelligent
feinine.
"I have done it s<> as to save le energy,"
Jacques announced bravely, even though the
solt I'aiisian night had begun to tall and he was
staiting to shiver.
"Ah, oui?" said Jeanette. ' I hen we shall
have to keep warm somehow."
She winked a subtle wink.
"It is also only fail to let you know that we
will no longer have Ic hot vvatei.' Jacques said.
" I his is also to save energy.
"Jacques, you have gone Hut her than most

continued Jeanette, adjusting her sup

be needing plenty of cold show ers."
C Kercome, Jacques threw aside his
sport coat, which smelled all the
sweeter for having been cleaned In a
dry cleaner that didn't use per
chlou(ethylene, and threw his arms
iround Jeanette.
"We had best turn out the lights to
save energy." Jeanette whispered.
"Oui." answered Jacques, flicking
the light switch. And yet a glow re
mained somewhere in the room,
lacques glanced around furiously
until he found its source.
"I.ike a fool. I have left my phone
plugged into ze wall!" he cried.
"You would do such a thing?"
gasped Jeanette.springing away." You
know full well that once your phone is
charged, keeping it plugged in only
wastes le energy!"

A solitary tear slid down her ini
maculate cheek. She stuck out her
tongue to one side.caught the droplet,
and swallowed it. so as not to waste
water. Jeanette was perhaps even
more ecologically sensitive than her
estimable lover.
"I must have been ... distracted,"
Jacques purred, as he pulled the
phone charger from its socket and
tossed it lightly over his shoulder.
Complete darkness soon fell on
the penthouse apartment, and
Jacques and Jeanette soon fell on the
penthouse floor, quickly smoothing
over their amorous discord.
"Where do you get all your energy,
Jacques?" Jeanette breathed, huskily.
And as he was an honest man. Jacques
answered honestly.
"From my enormous wind tur
