Defense of Howe ignores issues
I expect more from the Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs. Darren Franich's Iliesday col
umn ("Howe Could It Come to This?" Feb.
26) was a criticism of both Nanci Howe and
the Office of Student Activities, despite
whatever rhetorical issues one may have
with it. Franich raised valid and strong cri
tiques of the OSA. its policies and its servic
es. Cireg Boardman's response addressed

none of these critiques.
Perhaps Ihe Daily does demean itselt by
printing such diatribes. A university admin
istration. however, demeans itself much
more severely by implicitly judging it un
necessary to respond to informed student
critiques of its offices. It is not truly impor
tant to anyone (perhaps save Nanci Howe)
whether or not I ranieh's article was rude or
mean-spirited. It is important to everyone
that the ()SA actually benefits the students

whom it was created to serve. I his, as
Franich so eloquently argued, is currently
not the case. I do not care to heai didactic
press releases on manners and journalism.
I do want to hear why. in thoroughly con
vincing and reasonable i hetoric. the admin
istration has not yet taken I ranich's advice
and dissolved the OSA without finther de
bate.
