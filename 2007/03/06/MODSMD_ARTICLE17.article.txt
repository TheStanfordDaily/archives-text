more Jeff Zeller also fell in their first

Knupfer and Tobias Scheil. Knupfer
and Scheil comprise No. 25 Rice's (8-

Zeller then posted a two-set win in
the consolation draw before narrow

"[This weekend was] a really
good way for us to work on doubles
and focus on that since [doubles is]
such a big point." Hodge said. "We
certainly felt good coming out of
there. A lot of our younger guys got
[to play some] really good tennis,
practiced their combinations,
worked with their partners and
found a few things to work on. "
No. 27 Stanford (3-6) hits the
court tomorrow at 5 p.m. in a night
match against No. 10 Florida State
(7-3). Although the Seminoles are a
top 10 team, they dropped two close
4-3 losses to No. 31 Clemson and No.
52 Georgia Tech.
"They have had a couple losses,
but they're very solid up and down
the lineup," Whitlinger said. "I don't
see a lot of weak spots in their team
right now. It's going to be a tough one
for us, but we're looking forward to
the challenge."
