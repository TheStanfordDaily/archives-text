# Turning the tide?

As a Stanford athletics fan. I
haven't exactly enjoyed the
sch(x)l year.
Men's basketball provides me with
more of a nerve-racking experience
than dealing with the OSA, and Cardi
nal football was more of a joke than new
31-year-old Oakland Raiders head
coach Lane Kiffin.
At the start of baseball season on the
Farm, it looked like the year wouldn't
get much easier.The Cardinal was swept
by Cal State-Fullerton before dropping
two of three to Texas two weeks later.
Stanford entered the season ranked
23rd and 24th nationally by Collegiate
Baseball and NCBWA, respectively. 1
figured the rankings were quite gener
ous. considering the Cardinal lost most
of its big names from 2(X)6 — most no
tably staff ace Greg Reynolds, who was
picked second overall by the Colorado
Rockies in the MLB First Year Player
Draft.
But Stanford returned a young ros
ter that had seen significant playing time
in 2006. Baseball America named
power-hitting junior Michael Taylor to
its pre-season All-American team after
the outfielder had already been named
to the 2(X)6 Wallace Award Watch List,
and junior infielder Adam Sorgi was
also set to return to the lineup after miss
ing the entire 2006 season due to injur}'.
Since dropping the early games,
however. Stanford has rolled through
series against Kansas and California to

build its current winning streak of eight.
The reason for the recent surge? The
Cardinal just seems to he doing every
thing right.
After blowing huge late-inning op
portunities at both Fullerton and
Austin, Stanford's hitters have begun to
drive in runs when it matters. On Satur
day. the Cardinal erased a 1-0 deficit
against California with two crucial runs
in the seventh before collecting some
insurance runs en route to the 5-4 win.
And Stanford's clutch hitting has ex
tended to its explosiveness, creating
many multiple-run innings in close
games against Kansas.Texas and Cali
fornia.
I lead coach Mark Marquess said
the biggest question mark heading into
the season would be the Cardinal's
pitching, So far. the concern has proved
unwarranted.
I reshman righty Jeff Inman became
the first Stanford hurler since 1995 to
stall a three-game set last Friday allow
ing just three hits and striking out nine
in 7.2 innings. And in the process, the
Bakersfield. Calif, native is setting him
self apart as a potential future ace for
the Cardinal staff.
Junior closer David Stringer mean
while has also continued to be lights
out.collecting six saves in six opportuni
ties this season to go along with a 2.45
FRA.
The pitching question could be
come a bigger issue come Pacific-10
Conference play, as every conference
squad lost big arms over the offseason.
Stanford is picked to finish third in the
Pac-10, behind Arizona State and de
fending national champion Oregon
State. It seems as though every team in
the Pac-10 thinks it has arms, yet few of
these pitchers have actually proven
their worth on the mound.
The toughest bats faced by Stringer
and Inman have come courtesy of Cal
ifornia and Kansas.so I guess we'll have
to wait and see how they fare against
what is sure to be a tough, wide-open
conference. But since Marquess began
stressing keeping the ball low after the
losses to Fullerton, the entire staff has
n't shown much vulnerability.
And one last interesting note: Stan
ford swept the opening series against
Fullerton in 2004 and 2(XX> — both
years in which the Titans reached the
College World Series. With Fullerton
sweeping the Cardinal this season,
could the trend reverse'?
