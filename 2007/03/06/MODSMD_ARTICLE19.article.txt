# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Stanford rolls over cross-Bay rivals 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Senior Anne Yelsey was able to communi
cate the results of this past weekend's matches
against No. IX Pepperdine and No. 7 California
in rather simple terms.
"1 thought it was complete domination."
she said.
Yelsey wasn't too far off in that assessment,
seeing as the women's tennis team had little
trouble defeating both the Waves and Bears.

The Stanford women won both matches by
convincing scores of 6-1. and if it weren't for a
default loss when sophomore Jessica Nguyen
had to pull out of her match due to injury, the
Cardinal likely would have "skunked" Pepper
dine. 7-0.
Friday's match against the Waves turned
out to be a good warm-up for Saturday's
grudge match against Cal. Although the Cardi
nal was tested last year against Pepperdine, no
such scenario arose this time, as freshman
Lindsay Burdette described.

"We didn't know what to expect, but we
went out and took care of business," she said.
"We played so well in doubles. It's one of the
first times this year where we really clicked. 1
think it was our solid play that caused them to
break down, especially in doubles. We came
out and made them play."
Yelsey agreed with Burdette that this
weekend's match was a distinct change from
last year.
"l felt great," she said."Pepperdine
was our closest match last year. We re
alls wanted revenge. We wanted to go
nut and dominate, since we felt like we
should have done it last year. 1 was re
ally happy with |the result]."
Alter the match on Friday. Stanford
was charged with another tough task in
lacing the rival Bears. Although the
Cardinal had beaten C'al bv a score ol

6-1 at the National Team Indoors in
February, head coach Lele Forood un
derstood that the match would Ix.' dif
ferent this time around — at least in
that it would be played outdoors.
And indeed, that turned out to be
the only real difference fr< mi the ('ardi
nal's February thrashing of C'al. Stan
ford came out fired up and had little
trouble with the Bears, winning handi
ly by a score of 6-l.'lTie sole Stanford
loss came at the No. 3 spot, where Cal's
Nina Henkel defeated junior Celia
Durkin 3-6,6-1,6-2.
Aside from that one slip-up. it was
nothing but smooth sailing for the C ar

dinal.
"Our goal was to stay up and get a
good start against Cal. and we did."
Burdette said. "It was awesome. We
dominated the doubles.and everybody
got a pretty good start in singles. We
won a lot of first sets and I think that
helped us out a lot."
Yelsey echoed Burdette's senti
ments. also citing the dynamics that the
rivalry match brought to the table.
"We were excited," the senior said.
"We were having some issues with cer
tain injuries, but the attitudes were
amazing. Everyone was pumped up
and ready to go. And it was Cal — it

doesn't take much to get up for a match
against Cal."
Although it may not have been the
closest match, there was still an intense
atmosphere at theTaube Family Tennis
Stadium on Saturday.
"We were at home, and we had all
our fans cheering for us," Yelsey said.
"Whenever we won a point there was
excitement and noise."
The pressure came not only from
the Stanford side, as Burdette noted
that the Cal squad brought at least 4()
spectators who were cheering for the
(iolden Bears.
But in every regard.it was a success

ful weekend swing for top-ranked
Stanford. As Forood explained, the
weekend marked the end of a grueling
three-week stretch that the team had to
endure. A wealth of in juries among the
Cardinal hampered Stanford over the
stretch,but the women were still able to
come out undefeated.
The two weekend victories push the
Cardinal's overall record to 9-1, with
the only loss coming in early February
against Georgia Tech at the National
Indoors. More importantly, the Cardi
nal has established its stranglehold on
the first-place spot in the Pac-10 with a
record of 5-0.

Still. No. 1 Stanford women's team
is just starting to find its groove.
"We came out of the weekend with
all the confidence in the world." Yelsey
said."We consider both the matches to
have been complete blowouts. We had
some injured people on the team, and
they kind of sacrificed and just played.
I think that it really sends a statement
to all the other Pac-10 teams."
"We always peak later in the sea
son." she added. "We're on our way
there ritiht now."
