# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Stanford rolls over cross-Bay rivals 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Senior Anne Yelsey was able to communi
cate the results of this past weekend's matches
against No. IX Pepperdine and No. 7 California
in rather simple terms.
"1 thought it was complete domination."
she said.
Yelsey wasn't too far off in that assessment,
seeing as the women's tennis team had little
trouble defeating both the Waves and Bears.

The Stanford women won both matches by
convincing scores of 6-1. and if it weren't for a
default loss when sophomore Jessica Nguyen
had to pull out of her match due to injury, the
Cardinal likely would have "skunked" Pepper
dine. 7-0.
Friday's match against the Waves turned
out to be a good warm-up for Saturday's
grudge match against Cal. Although the Cardi
nal was tested last year against Pepperdine, no
such scenario arose this time, as freshman
Lindsay Burdette described.

"We didn't know what to expect, but we
went out and took care of business," she said.
"We played so well in doubles. It's one of the
first times this year where we really clicked. 1
think it was our solid play that caused them to
break down, especially in doubles. We came
out and made them play."
Yelsey agreed with Burdette that this
weekend's match was a distinct change from
last year.
