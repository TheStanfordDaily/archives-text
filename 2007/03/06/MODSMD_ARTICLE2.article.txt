### ANDREW VALENCIA 
Tyler I tester '06 studied abroad at
Oxford during his junior year and fell
in love with Cambridge. England and
its history.
Now Hester, two other current
Stanford students and an alum will go
to Cambridge, where the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation will pay
for up to four more years of school
ing.
"To study at a top-notch universi
ty like Cambridge with brilliant
scholars and all of traditions will
be a great experience." said Hester,
who will research education reform
for students with limited English pro
ficiency.
The four Stanford-affiliated fel
lows are among 4N Americans select
ed for this years' Gates Cambridge
Scholarships.
Shamsher Samra '08. Albert
Chiou "07. Elizabeth Dzeng '02 and
Hester — also a current graduate
student in modern thought and liter
ature — were selected after consid
eration of their commitment to aca
demies. leadership and community
service.
With four winners in 2007. Stan
ford has now had 12 Gates Scholars
since the program was established in
2000.
Katie Route, student affairs offi-
cer at the Bechtel International Center, said she was happy
with four recipients but hinted that the University has a ways
to go before it challenges some of its peer institutions.
"It's not bad," she said in an email to The Daily. "Harvard
and Yale had more, but Stanford has never had more than
two [in one year] in past years."
At Cambridge, Chiou will pursue a master of philosophy
in chemistry, furthering his work in the field of molecular
chemistry.
Samra plans to pursue a degree in epidemiology in order
to learn how to better treat heart disease and diabetes in
India.
Dzeng's studies will focus on social anthropology in rela
tion to public health.
The multi-round Gates Scholars' selection process culmi
nated in early February with interviews in Annapolis, Md.
"It was definitely an unbelievable moment when I found
out I had been selected." Chiou said. "There were so many
amazing people with such great accomplishments down in
Annapolis, so I figured I'd probably need a lot of luck to get
through that last round."
The scholarship winners from Stanford all participate ex
tensively in the community.
Chiou sits on the steering committee of a free clinic in San
Jose, while Hester works with organizations to help teach
English to non-native speakers. Samra serves as president of
the South Asian Preventive Health Outreach Program and
Dzeng works with the Johns Hopkins Center for Disasters
and Refugee Response.
At Cambridge, they will have the opportunity to synthe
size their studies with their extracurricular activities.
"While I am at Cambridge, 1 11 be trying to use these novel
technologies to study how medically-important systems
such as telomerase protein complexes and viruses function
at the molecular level." Chiou said. "Like any scientist, I'm
hoping that I will be able to make a meaningful contribution
to our body of knowledge in those fields."
