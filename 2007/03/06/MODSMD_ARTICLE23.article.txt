# Card bounces back
## Men fall to Michigan, beat Nebraska on road 
### DANNY BELCH 
The No. 5 Stanford men's gym
nastics team earned a weekend
split, falling to No. 1 Michigan on
Friday but rallying to defeat No. 10
Nebraska on Sunday. Entering the
weekend undermanned due to in
juries (junior co-captain David
Sender was also absent due to per
sonal circumstances), the Cardinal
could not upend Michigan.
The Wolverines executed
strong routines, and with the Car
dinal being undermanned by as
many as two athletes in various
events, they could not make up the
needed points. Michigan won
212.35-208.1. Less than two days
later in Lincoln, Neb., Stanford
fared much better, winning by a
score of 216.85-206.30.
On Friday, the Cardinal put to
gether some good exercises, with
sophomore Greg Ter-Zakhariants
and senior co-captain Dylan Car
ney posting scores of 9.05 and 9.00,
respectively, on the floor exercise.
Stanford was able to enter the
maximum six gymnasts in the floor
exercise and as a result led after
the first rotation. 35.35-33.60.
Michigan took the lead on the next
rotation, though, as the Cardinal
switched to pommel horse while
Michigan tallied its highest score
of the night (37.70) on the floor ex
ercise.
"We are obviously disappoint
ed," Carney said. "We were a little
off on our landings compared to
usual. We did not do badly, but we
could have done better."
The short-handed Cardinal
squad continued to face difficulty
with only four gymnasts to Michi
gan's five in the still rings. Stanford
was down 71.3 to 69 entering the

GAME NOTES After falling to top-ranked
Michigan on Friday evening, the Cardinal
rebounded to pick up a decisive win on the

Senior Alex Schorsch earned a 9.5
and sophomore Bryant Hadden a
9.6. but the high scores were not
enough to gain a lead over Michi

allowed Stanford to pull within
two points, 141.40-139.70.
Lack of depth would plague the
Cardinal from there on. highlight
ed by Stanford's four gymnasts in
the high bar to Michigan's six.
Michigan did well enough to
counter solid Stanford perform
ances and the Cardinal suffered a
tough defeat. The slim four-point
margin of victory for the Wolver
ines was hard to swallow for the
Cardinal, but the team knew it had
another meet with which to redeem
itself.
Stanford rebounded nicely to
down Nebraska in its first trip away
from the West Coast this season.
Pushed by a Huskers squad that
scored its highest point total of the
season (206.30), Stanford had five
first-place finishers out of six events,
including sweeps of the top five spots
in the floor exercise and top three
spots in the still rings.
"I was impressed by how well we

did," Carney said."We were a lot bet
ter, and we didn't make as many mis
takes as we did [versus Michigan).
We were not perfect, but knowing we
can improve on good performances
is something to be happy about."
Sender, who missed Friday's meet
due to undisclosed circumstances,
was back in the lineup for Sunday,
llie co-captain had no trouble get
ting back into the mix, as he won the
all-around competition with a score
of 54.05.
Other notable highlights includ
ed career bests for juniors Chris
Harper and Flli Alcaraz. Harper
recorded a score of 9.15 on the paral
lel bars, toppling his previous best of
9.00. Alcaraz's previous best on the

floor exercise was 8.75 until Sunday,
when he turned in a 9.00. Carney tied
his career best with a 9.70 in the high
bar, good for a first-place finish.
Carney commented on how well
I larper did on Sunday. The junior is
one of the top gymnasts in the nation
in both the parallel bars and the
pommel horse. The senior was im
pressed with 1 larper's execution and
overall performance.
Harper finished first on the pom
mel horse with a 9.40 and second in
the parallel bars with the 9.15. He is
establishing himself among the elite
in the nation, as his routines are be
coming more and more polished and
relaxed.
"1 definitely redeemed myself
from Friday," said Harper, who did
not score above a 9.0 versus Michi
gan. but turned it around two days
later. "The parallel bars are becom
ing nearly automatic for me. My
body pretty much knows what to do
now. It's a credit to the training pro
gram."
Harper does not think there will
be much pressure on him or the
team heading into the more crucial
part of the season.
"There really is no pressure," he
said. "We just have to go out there
and perform. With all the training we
have done, the solid routines will un
fold themselves."

Around title with a score of 54.05. With the
victory, the Stanford men regained mo
mentum in preparation for their upcoming

State, the No. 2 ranked team in the nation.

event, hoping to make up points
while Michigan was on the vault.
Senior Alex Schorsch earned a 9.5
and sophomore Bryant Hadden a
9.6. but the high scores were not
enough to gain a lead over Michi
gan. as the Wolverines' depth only
allowed Stanford to pull within
two points, 141.40-139.70.
Lack of depth would plague the
Cardinal from there on. highlight
ed by Stanford's four gymnasts in
the high bar to Michigan's six.
Michigan did well enough to
counter solid Stanford perform
ances and the Cardinal suffered a
tough defeat. The slim four-point
margin of victory for the Wolver
ines was hard to swallow for the
Cardinal, but the team knew it had
another meet with which to redeem
itself.
Stanford rebounded nicely to
down Nebraska in its first trip away
from the West Coast this season.
Pushed by a Huskers squad that
scored its highest point total of the
season (206.30), Stanford had five
first-place finishers out of six events,
including sweeps of the top five spots
in the floor exercise and top three
spots in the still rings.
"I was impressed by how well we

did," Carney said."We were a lot bet
ter, and we didn't make as many mis
takes as we did [versus Michigan).
We were not perfect, but knowing we
can improve on good performances
is something to be happy about."
Sender, who missed Friday's meet
due to undisclosed circumstances,
was back in the lineup for Sunday,
llie co-captain had no trouble get
ting back into the mix, as he won the
all-around competition with a score
of 54.05.
Other notable highlights includ
ed career bests for juniors Chris
Harper and Flli Alcaraz. Harper
recorded a score of 9.15 on the paral
lel bars, toppling his previous best of
9.00. Alcaraz's previous best on the

floor exercise was 8.75 until Sunday,
when he turned in a 9.00. Carney tied
his career best with a 9.70 in the high
bar, good for a first-place finish.
Carney commented on how well
I larper did on Sunday. The junior is
one of the top gymnasts in the nation
in both the parallel bars and the
pommel horse. The senior was im
pressed with 1 larper's execution and
overall performance.
Harper finished first on the pom
mel horse with a 9.40 and second in
the parallel bars with the 9.15. He is
establishing himself among the elite
in the nation, as his routines are be
coming more and more polished and
relaxed.
"1 definitely redeemed myself
from Friday," said Harper, who did
not score above a 9.0 versus Michi
gan. but turned it around two days
later. "The parallel bars are becom
ing nearly automatic for me. My
body pretty much knows what to do
now. It's a credit to the training pro
gram."
Harper does not think there will
be much pressure on him or the
team heading into the more crucial
part of the season.
"There really is no pressure," he
said. "We just have to go out there
and perform. With all the training we
have done, the solid routines will un
fold themselves."
