# Dining halls go local
## Eat Local Week brings sustainable food to campus 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Dining and Residential A: Dining En
terprises kicked off the first ever I at I oca I ( elebra
tion on Sunday in an effort to raise awareness about
sustainable food. The week-long awareness cam

with local and sustainable food production at a dif
ferent dining hall each night.
Wallaby Yogurt Company. Pacific Harvest
Seafoods and the environmental nonprofit group
Oceana were represented at Lakeside Dining last
night.
John Koeppen, a local salmon fisherman who
brought photographs of his boat 1 ulu and a rare 50-
pound catch, said he fishes for wild salmon between
May and September. Eighty percent of what he
catches ultimately comes from the Sacramento
River basin, he said, adding that he trolls for fish
meaning that I ulu drags barbless hooks behind her
as she moves slowly through the watei. II he catches

any threatened species, Koeppen said he releases
them while they are still alive.
"There's no point in releasing dead by catch," he
deadpanned.
As a local fisherman. Koeppen is part of the $10
million local salmon industry. As a sustainable fisher
man. Koeppen catches fewer fish than he would if he
used nets, like his less environmentally friendly col
leagues.
According to Rhonda Simon, a sales manager at
Pacific I larvest Seafoods which distributes Koep
pen s fish the profit lost by a smaller volume is oft
set by the higher quality of the trolling-caught fish.
" Ibe massive quantities of the fish caught in nets
means that they get bruised easily," she said. "People
will pay more money for fish that isn't bruised."
Stanford Dining Quality Assurance Chef Jeff
Rosen said that the I Jniversity began providing sole
ly sustainable and locally fished salmon last Septem

while ecologically beneficial — has presented a fis

costs come with increased quality."
Geoff Schester. a fourth-year

laborations for Ocean Research
and Education group (SCORE) as
well as Oceana, an international
nonprofit dedicated to ocean pro
tection. Equipped with a SCORE
poster board about aquaculture as
well as Oceana brochures, Schester
said that the Eat Local Celebration
is an example of a market-based ap
proach to environmental advocacy.
"Educated consumers who know
where their food comes from create
market pressure," he said. "This gives
fishermen an incentive to adopt more
sustainable techniques."
According to Rosen. Stanford
Dining aims to support these sustain

LOCAL AM) ORGANIC:

INGREDIENTS FOR
SUSTAINABIUTY

In January, the University received
an A grade for Food and Recycling in
the first ever college sustainability re
port card, which classified two to five
percent of the Stanford dining hall
fc>< >d as organic. According to Stanford
Dining Executive Director Rafi
Taherian, however, that percentage
has grown: today, 22 percent of food
served — including meat, milk and
seasonal produce — is organic, and 40
percent is purchased from local farm
ers.
"Our goal is to provide students
with the best value for their food dol
lars in wholesome, nutritious food in a
fiscally and environmentally responsi
ble way," he said. "Organic and sustain
able food does both. Organic products
are fundamentally different from con
ventionally grown products in taste,
texture and density, for example."
However, Taherian emphasized
that organic food should be consid
ered in context of other costs and ben
efits. As an example,he pointed to UC-
Berkeley, which in early 2(XHi opened
what was trumpeted as the first-ever
certified organic kitchen on a college
campus in the U.S.
"We're not sure that organic is the
right thing all the timc,"Taherian said.
"Sometimes organic food isn't sustain
able. If we're purchasing organic
grapes from Chile because they're not
in season in California, a significant

amount of energy' is being consumed
in transportation costs."
Sustainable Foods Coordinator Em
mett Hopkins added in an email toThe
Daily that even buying in-season food
from local farmers is subject to the
same concerns.
"Never have blind faith in any sus
tainable food mantra," he warned, "in
cluding'eat local.'"

"Emmett acts as a kind of liaison
between the students and Stanford
Dining." she said. "Getting a full-time
coordinator dedicated to sustainable
food was a big accomplishment. What
we need to do now is better coordinate
purchasing, awareness and educa
tion."
This includeshostingand promoting
eventssuchastheEatLocalCelebration.
"I would like to see Stanford buy
more food directly from producers,
eliminating intermediary transactions
and giving more of our ftxxl dollars di
rectly to the people who grow our
food," I lopkins said. "Those who come
to the Eat Local Celebration will have
a chance to meet some of the local pro
ducers with whom we do already have

a direct relationship."
Ibis week's events follow in the
footsteps of other long-term projects
such as the student-run Community
Farm, which was inaugurated last fall at
its location on West Campus, near
Stock Farm Road. Ibe one-acre plot
joins the six herb-and-vegetable-grow
ing community gardens outside the
major dining halls in supplying pro
duce to the dining halls.
Hopkins said he would like to see a
comprehensive sustainable food edu
cation program at Stanford.
"While Stanford has an increasing
ly strong focus on sustainability, we are
still thin on resources for teaching and
research in topics related to ecological
ly sound agriculture and sustainable
food systems." he said."To address this
need, a team of stakeholders has been
working to develop the beginnings of
an academic program on sustainable
ftxxJ. which would likely be housed
within the School of Farth Sciences."
So far. according to Gaines, Stan
ford Dining has been receptive to stu
dent ideas and requests.
"They already do a lot of what we're
advocating, and we want to make these
initiatives more visible," she said. 'And.
of course, we really want to increase the
total percentage of sustainable food on
campus."
STANK )KI) "PC)(>IHES"
According toTaherian. however, in
creasing sustainable ftxxls at Stanford
depends largely on student taste buds.

"People are used to eating food that
isn t in season,' he said. "Tomatoes, for
example, are always in demand.
Turnips aren't, regardless of whether or
not they're in season. What we have to
do is educate customers about how to
eat sustainable food. Ibere's a tech
nique for this called being 'stealth
healthy' — we offer healthier, equally
attractive options in strategic locations,
and try to make unhealthy food more
difficult to get. If you want unhealthy
food, you've got to ask for it."
Rosen is confident that students will
appreciate the taste of sustainable food.
"Stanford students are foodies," he
said."Theyknowwhonsomcthing'scov
ered in sauce to hide something wrong."
In fact,Rosen said, students seem to
have noticed the gradual changes in
dining halls. The number of student
complaints has dropped dramatically
in the last four years.
"It's the best way students can re
spond," he said. "Hut they're reason
able people. They want to get good
food."

depends largely on student taste buds.

"People are used to eating food that
isn t in season,' he said. "Tomatoes, for
example, are always in demand.
Turnips aren't, regardless of whether or
not they're in season. What we have to
do is educate customers about how to
eat sustainable food. Ibere's a tech
nique for this called being 'stealth
healthy' — we offer healthier, equally
attractive options in strategic locations,
and try to make unhealthy food more
difficult to get. If you want unhealthy
food, you've got to ask for it."
Rosen is confident that students will
appreciate the taste of sustainable food.
"Stanford students are foodies," he
said."Theyknowwhonsomcthing'scov

In fact,Rosen said, students seem to
have noticed the gradual changes in
dining halls. The number of student

in the last four years.

Stanford Dining and Residential A: Dining En
terprises kicked off the first ever I at I oca I ( elebra
tion on Sunday in an effort to raise awareness about
sustainable food. The week-long awareness cam
paign, which ends I'riday. features speakers involved
with local and sustainable food production at a dif
ferent dining hall each night.
Wallaby Yogurt Company. Pacific Harvest
Seafoods and the environmental nonprofit group
Oceana were represented at Lakeside Dining last
night.
John Koeppen, a local salmon fisherman who
brought photographs of his boat 1 ulu and a rare 50-
pound catch, said he fishes for wild salmon between
May and September. Eighty percent of what he
catches ultimately comes from the Sacramento
River basin, he said, adding that he trolls for fish
meaning that I ulu drags barbless hooks behind her
as she moves slowly through the watei. II he catches

any threatened species, Koeppen said he releases
them while they are still alive.
"There's no point in releasing dead by catch," he
deadpanned.
As a local fisherman. Koeppen is part of the $10
million local salmon industry. As a sustainable fisher
man. Koeppen catches fewer fish than he would if he
used nets, like his less environmentally friendly col
leagues.
According to Rhonda Simon, a sales manager at
Pacific I larvest Seafoods which distributes Koep
pen s fish the profit lost by a smaller volume is oft
set by the higher quality of the trolling-caught fish.
" Ibe massive quantities of the fish caught in nets
means that they get bruised easily," she said. "People
will pay more money for fish that isn't bruised."
Stanford Dining Quality Assurance Chef Jeff
Rosen said that the I Jniversity began providing sole
ly sustainable and locally fished salmon last Septem
ber, after two years of deliberation. Ibe transition —
while ecologically beneficial — has presented a fis
cal challenge.
"The salmon industry hasn't had a good year,"
Rosen said. "But we made a commitment, and we're

going to stick to it. And the increased
costs come with increased quality."
Geoff Schester. a fourth-year
doctoral student in the interdiscipli
nary program in environment and
resources at the Hopkins Marine
Station, represented Student Col
laborations for Ocean Research
and Education group (SCORE) as
well as Oceana, an international
nonprofit dedicated to ocean pro
tection. Equipped with a SCORE
poster board about aquaculture as
well as Oceana brochures, Schester
said that the Eat Local Celebration
is an example of a market-based ap
proach to environmental advocacy.
"Educated consumers who know
where their food comes from create
market pressure," he said. "This gives
fishermen an incentive to adopt more
sustainable techniques."
According to Rosen. Stanford
Dining aims to support these sustain
able producers.
"A lot of food service depart
ments are huge consumers," he said.
"We have an obligation to be green
wherever we can, and we're going to
do as much to minimize our ecologi
cal footprint as possible."
LOCAL AM) ORGANIC:

INGREDIENTS FOR
SUSTAINABIUTY

In January, the University received
an A grade for Food and Recycling in
the first ever college sustainability re
port card, which classified two to five
percent of the Stanford dining hall
fc>< >d as organic. According to Stanford
Dining Executive Director Rafi
Taherian, however, that percentage
has grown: today, 22 percent of food
served — including meat, milk and
seasonal produce — is organic, and 40
percent is purchased from local farm
ers.
"Our goal is to provide students
with the best value for their food dol
lars in wholesome, nutritious food in a
fiscally and environmentally responsi
ble way," he said. "Organic and sustain
able food does both. Organic products
are fundamentally different from con
ventionally grown products in taste,
texture and density, for example."
However, Taherian emphasized
that organic food should be consid
ered in context of other costs and ben
efits. As an example,he pointed to UC-
Berkeley, which in early 2(XHi opened
what was trumpeted as the first-ever
certified organic kitchen on a college
campus in the U.S.
"We're not sure that organic is the
right thing all the timc,"Taherian said.
"Sometimes organic food isn't sustain
able. If we're purchasing organic
grapes from Chile because they're not
in season in California, a significant

amount of energy' is being consumed
in transportation costs."
Sustainable Foods Coordinator Em
mett Hopkins added in an email toThe
Daily that even buying in-season food
from local farmers is subject to the
same concerns.
"Never have blind faith in any sus
tainable food mantra," he warned, "in
cluding'eat local.'"
