members of the greater community.
Professional photographer Brigitte

Carnochan teaches Tobin's class. Carnochan
was formerly .. distant provost, associate direc
tor of the international studies program and
English lecturer at the University.
Carnochan, who spoke highly of I riday's
exposition, said her class is not a how-to-take
pictures seminar, but teaches students how to
prepare a portfolio, an artist statement or
even business cards.
"All those things that a gallery would take
for granted." she said. "The opening was a
tremendous success. Each year — this was the
third year — the students have had many of
their friends and family come to celebrate
their achievement. Those fans in addition to

the regular gallery fans have made the
opening a shoulder-to-shoulder event."
Mark Pinsukanjana and Bryan Yedinak,
co-owners of Modernbook Gallery, assist
Carnochan with the class. While the gallery
owners host mainly professional artists,
they make an exception for the Continuing
Studies students.
"It's a great way for us to find new and
fresh talent within the community," Pin
sukanjana said. "[Continuing Studies] is a
wonderful program where [the students]
get to pursue their dreams."
ForTobin. who is also a technology inte
gration specialist at the School of Medicine,
participating in the Continuing Studies pro
gram has helped him progress to a new level
of professionalism in his photography.
"Our goal," he said."is to sell photos and
become a little bit more successful."
Ihe students in the class were selected from
a group of 50 applicants, all of whom sub
mitted portfolios of their work. Among
Tobin's classmates is Education Prof. Con
nie Juel.
"You're thrilled if you get accepted [ into
the class)," she said. "It equips you to try to
start getting into galleries."
.Kiel's photo collection included a close
up shot of penguins.
"I'm standing in water up to here." she
said to an onlooker, pointing to her mid
thigh. Ihe photograph showed a group of
penguins only feet away, diving into icy
turquoise water.
Aside from learning the business as
pects of photography. Juel said, class mem
bers are very supportive of one another.
Echoing the sentiments of Pinsukanjana

and Carnochan, Juel said she expects the
group will keep in touch even after the
show closes on Apr. 4.
Until then, the aspiring artists hope their
show will be a success. The photographers
will take turns spending time in the gallery
so visitors will have an opportunity to speak
with them about their work.
Prints of the photographs are also avail

able, ranging in price from $200 - $350. At
press time, 28 prints had been sold.
