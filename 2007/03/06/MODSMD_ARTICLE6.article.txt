the Cardinal lead to three at 20-17.

Junior Candice Wiggins and her teamn cites celebrate their fourth Pac-1 0 Tournament title in five
years. Wiggins had 20 points and made two huge defensive plays in the final minute to seal the win.

half.
Five of those offensive rebounds
led directly to Stanford baskets.
"1 knew 1 couldn't afford to foul
out." Appel said. "I just told myself I'd
get no fouls in the first half."
After trading baskets for much of
the second half, Stanford blitzed its op
ponents for the last seven minutes of
the first half after an ASU jumper cut

the Cardinal lead to three at 20-17.
Wiggins scored four points sand
wiched between a quartet of Appel
lay-ups as Stanford closed out the first
half on a 14-2 run, while the Sun Dev
ils missed their last nine shots of the
period. ASU ended up shooting only
8-for-29 (27.6 percent) from the field
in the first half.
Stanford cruised along, more or
less maintaining that 17-point halftime
lead for most of the second half until
Arizona State began its late run.
"It was exactly what we thought it
was going to be," VanDerveer said. "A
battle."

ten Newlin knocked away a number of
passes to Westerberg and sealed her
off from the basket whenever she
managed to get the ball.
ITie Cardinal also used its signifi
cant size advantage to out-rebound
the Sun Devils by a remarkable 13
boards. VanDerveer played her big
lineup with Appel, Smith and Newlin
all on the floor for long segments of the

game, and ASH coach Charli Turner
ITiorne identified their contribution
on the glass as the tipping point of the
game.
"Rebounding wins championships,
and we didn't rebound well enough,"
Thorne said.
Newlin contributed nine rebounds
for the Cardinal.
The size advantage played out in
another way as well. As often happens
in the postseason, the referees at I IP
Pavilion put away their whistles for
large parts of the game, and the ('ardi
nal's size helped it withstand the more
physical play that ensued.
"They stop calling as much (at this
time of year]," Smith said. "You just
have to battle and play through it."
This is Stanford's fourth Pac-10
tournament championship in the last
five years. The Cardinal was upset by
UCLA in the 2(M)6 edition, and Smith
said that the team was eager to go into
the NCAA Tournament on a more
positive note this time around.
"We wanted to build momentum
going into NCAAs." Smith said. "This
is the most important time to be play
ing well."
