## Lab studies future of cell phones 
### VICTOR CRUZ 
"Mobile persuasion" is the study of
how handheld devices such as cell
phones and personal data assistants
can be used to influence people's
choices, actions and desires. As cell
phones become more and more like
little computers, they enable users to
receive information specific to their
personal needs and desires.
With some students addicted to
Web sites such as You lube and F ace
book, an industry has formed around
how lo tie technology and people to
gether even more than now.
M .I. Fogg, director of the Stanford
Persuasive technology Lab (SPTL)
organized a Mobile Persuasion Con
ference Friday to talk about the rela
tionship between technology, informa
tion and people in the future.
"|ll| I'm walking downtown, close
to dinner time, my phone should be
able to tell me there's a bakery near,"
he said, "or what groceries 1 need to
buy."
This weekend's conference
brought together leading experts in
the field. Ilie meeting, according to
Fogg, "helped put Stanford in the cen
ter of the world when it comes to mo
bile persuasion."
SPTF is a subset of the Center for
the Study of Language Information
(CSLI). Keith Devlin.executive direc
tor of the CSLI, highlighted SPTL's
contributions to the center.
"(It is) one of the jewels of the
CSI .Ihe said." H. J. and his colleagues
are pushing our understanding of mo
bile technologies and persuasion."
Thomas Wasow. director of the
CSLI. noted current problems in the
field of mobile persuasion.
"Part of the problem," he said,"[is
that | there is a history of people mak
ing extravagant claims of their tech
nology."
F ogg is working to solidify the field
in the future.
"112 Rom the academic perspective,
we want to improve research methods
for studying mobile persuasion," he
said "We are making observations.
That's what science is all about."
