Mar. 7,1957:
Legislature Moves In: Ihiib Stall"
Moves Out: I. ASSU hikes Power to
Approve of I 'ditor
"'lhe editorial staff of the Stanford
Daily walked out for an indefinite pe
riod last night following Legislature's
12 to 4 approval of a by-law change to
approve the Daily's editor.
Legislature acted in spite of some
1200 student signatures on petitions
disapproving the amendment or any
'legislation that would exercise con
trol over the Daily editor or the
Daily editorial policy.'
After routine matters were set
tled. Legislature brought up John
Cardoza's proposal for 'Legisla
ture's approval of the Daily editor
and recall of this editor by a three
fourths vote on a petition of five per
cent of the student body.
Speaking for his proposal, Car
doza said.'l don't think an editor will
be recalled or disapproved in the
next 10 years: but it will keep him on
his toes.'
After the Daily stated its reasons
against the by-law change a hassle
o\ er technicalities arose.'All you are
doing.' ASSU President Robert
I reelen said.'is babbling.""
Ihe Daily wrote a front-page edi
torial against the Legislature's action.
"We're leaving.
The Daily is in a unique position:
we don't want to lose that position. If
the Legislature wants a bulletin
board, they can have it.There will be
no feeling of freedom for an associ
ate editor if he feels his election must
be approved by Legislature.
Basically, we are completely dis
gusted by Legislature's attitude.
ITiey had done nothing all year â€”
until they decided that The Daily
wasn't making every organization
on campus happy and it was time to
knock it down a couple of notches.
We are walking out for an ideal
an ideal of a free, enlightened,
critical Stanford Daih with no leg
islative shackles on it."
