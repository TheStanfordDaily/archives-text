# The 						beginning of something
## Entrepreneurship Week features networking, fierce Post-it competition 
### BY LINUS LIANG 
Nine thousand l J ost-it notes fluttered about campus last weekend, a side
product of an llntrepreneurship Week in full swing.
Ilie series of events, which drew over one thousand students, industry pro
fessionals. and professors, included an entrepreneur mixer, a technology
showcase, and even a venture capitalist speed dating session. It culminated
with the Saturday judging of a competition called the Innovation Challenge.
Ninety teams had to take an everyday object — here, a pad of one hundred
y bv 3" Post-it notes — and attempt to create as much "value" as possible.
The catch? Teams only had four days — and no funding.
Ilie competition was aimed at testing entrepreneurial qualities like inno
vation, creativity, and presentation skills. One team, called "Pigs Might Fly,"
created a collaborative musical work by having people around campus write
a sequence of musical notes on a Post-it. and then combining these composi
tions into a computer program. Anothergroup,"ldealicious,"won the 1 lealth
Award for using pink colored Post-its to promote a healthy heart campaign.
Group members handed out best-practice information about cardiac care,
and gave Post-its to passers-by who signed an agreement to take care of their
heart. The recipients would then wear their post-its on their chest like an
AIDS ribbon.
Hut the grand pri/e went to the students who came up with some cash on
the fly.Team "(iumball Capital" used their Post-its to solicit donations for a
micro-lending organization called Kiva. Canvassing the campus with their
Post-it notes, they were able to raise over three-thousand dollars.
Organizers were thrilled at how the week worked out.
"it was unbelievable," said Management Science and Engineering Prof.

Tina Seelig, the events coor
dinator. "It blew my socks
off. Participation was amaz
ing. energy level was amaz
ing, everyone was so cre
ative."
The event was held in con
junction with Entrepreneurship
Week USA. an initiative created hy the
Kaulfman Foundation and sponsored hy compa
nies such as the New York Times and the business
magazine Inc. The organization's goal is to "to ig
nite the nation's consciousness around the importance
of being entrepreneurial," according to its website. A
Hollywood lilm crew was at hand on campus shooting
footage for a planned feature-length documentary on the ini
tiative, which should be released later this year.
Since the organization is brand-new, last week marked the
first time that Stanford has played host to Entrepreneur
ship Week. Though Seelig says the campus activities
were a success, she is planning many improve
ments.
What will they be?
"You'll just have to wait to next year to see."
laughed Seelig.
