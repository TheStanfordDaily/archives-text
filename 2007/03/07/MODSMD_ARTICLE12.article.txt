## Guantanamo docudrama stirs Film on torture sparks discussion, action 
### PETER WILLIAMS 
More than 50 people crowded
into Pigott Hall last night to watch
Amnesty International's screening
of "The Road to Guantanamo" a
docudrama about Guantanamo Bay
detainment camp prisoners that
elicited strong reactions from the au
dience.
The film chronicles the detention
of Ruhal Amhed. Asif Iqbal and
Shafiq Rasul — three men suspected
by the U.S. government of being in
volved with Al-Qaeda — who were
detained at Guantanamo's Camp X-
Ray and Camp Delta from 2001 until
their 2004 release.
Amnesty International hoped the
film would spark campus-wide dis
cussion and awareness about the use
of torture and other human rights vi
olations.
"Such abuses are not accidents
but the predictable results of our
policy decisions," said Galen Panger
'07, the group's campaign coordina
tor.
In particular, Panger pointed to
the Military Commissions Act of
2006, which allows the U.S. to hold
detainees classified as enemy com
batants indefinitely without charging
them with a crime.
The film's graphic depiction of

torture by Americans and British
military personnel prompted
groans and shudders from the audi
ence.
Colby France '08 said the film was
emotionally moving.
"Although 1 had heard about the
Guantanamo Bay scandal," he said.
"I never knew how terrible the abus
es were."
After the film. Amnesty Interna
tional organizers urged students

concerned with the U.S.'s detention
policy to participate in what they
called "urgent action " a letter-writ
ing campaign aimed at putting pres
sure on American government offi
cials to reform detainment protocols
and techniques. About 20 students
signed these letters after the screen
ing.
