## Road woes Mound rotations stretch loss to nearly four hours 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At home this year, Stanford pitching has
been like I)r. Jekyll. But when the Cardinal staff
leaves Sunken Diamond, it has turned into Mr.
Hyde.
On the season, the Cardinal (10-6) has given
up five more runs on the road (8.2) than it has
at home (3.1). Despite being only a couple
miles down Highway 101. Tuesday's game at
Santa ( lara (11-10) featured more of the same
struggles on the mound. Stanford arms gave up
10 walks and hit three batters en route to the 13-
5 loss to the Broncos.
"We just gave them too much," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "If you give up 10 walks
and three hit batsmen, it's hard to beat anyone.
When they had people on. they got them in."
Matt Long(2-4.2 RBI) and Carl Bacon (2-5,
3 RBI) led the Broncos, who had only 11 hits as
a club, but 12 RBI Santa Clara stepped up on
the base paths with a season-high six stolen
bases.
With the loss. Stanford ends its season-high
winning streak at eight games. The Cardinal is
now 9-0 at home this season, and 1-6 on the
road.
Santa Clara spotted the Cardinal a two-run
advantage in the first inning.but they would re
bound quickly, taking advantage of every free
base runner Stanford (10-6) gave them.
Freshman starter Brandt Walker (0-1) was
wild out of the gate, walking the bases loaded in
the first inning. Despite his control issues, it
looked like Stanford might get out of the inning
unscathed, until a ( ai l Bacon chopper to soph
omore second baseman Austin Yount took an
unexpected high bounce over his glove to tie
the game at 2-2.
Yount would throw wide of sophomore first
baseman Brent Millevilie on the following play,
one of two Stanford errors on the game. The
Broncos scored another run in the inning to go
up for good, 3-2.
Walker was pulled after 1.1 innings, opening
the revolving door to Stanford's bullpen —
junior Erik Davis, freshman Andrew Clauson,
sophomores Tom Stilson. Max Fearnow. Blake
Hancock and Yount and seldom-used junior
Rex Petrill all took the mound for the Cardinal.
The sidearm-throwing Petrill's only other ca
reer appearance came against Cal State-Fuller
ton where he threw one pitch.
