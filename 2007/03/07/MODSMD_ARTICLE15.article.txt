# Offseason dealings
## 
### 
Free agency. It's like Christmas
for some teams and like pulling
teeth for others. In the sporting
world, the attention given to the sign
ing periods of the three major sports
(Let's he honest, people couldn't care
less which stars the NHL's Phoenix
Coyotes sign this offseason.) reflects
the modern fan's need for entertain
ment year round. Sure, the casual fan
is happy with just watching the occa
sional game and sharing the excite
ment of a playoff race, hut for the
diehards,the season never really ends.
I, of course, consider myself one
such diehard, and 1 always thought the
offseason was an underrated form of
entertainment. Seeing an exciting star
changing teams to become the face of
a new franchise was just as much fun
as watching an established veteran
slug his way to a batting title, or lead
his team in rushing or put up 30 points
in a late-season triple-double to lead
his team to a key win over a rival.
But now, 1 have to wonder ... Is it
really all it's cracked up to be?
As a fan of the NFL's San Francis
co 49ers, this was an exciting week for
me. For the first time in my memory as
a fan. it was the team I followed that
was dishing out the big money for
proven players who could come in and
make an impact right away, maybe
even helping the once proud Niners
regain a spot in the playoffs.
But somewhere between last Fri
day's record $80-million signing for a
defensive player, Nate Clements, and
yesterday's signing of the consider
ably less exciting Fully Banta-Cain, I
realized something: 1 really have no
idea who any of these guys are.
I mean, sure, I've heard the hype
and I've read the player bios. For
some, I've even gone so far as to read
the local Philadelphia, Buffalo or
Boston papers to see what they've had
to say about the most recent additions
to my favorite team.

Mut I haven't watched them play. I
don't know it they play better under
pressure or when the spotlight isn't on
them: 1 wonder whether they are lock
:r room pranksters or leaders: and 1
have no idea how much better they
will make San Francisco next year.
In short, I've got no history as a fan
of them, and so. no love or loyalty, at
least not yet. And as the case of Gary
Matthews. Jr. — newly of the Los An
geles Angels of Anaheim — shows,
that n probably for the best.
Until a few short days ago.
Matthews was one of the most pri/ed
offseason acquisitions in MLB, and
was expected to play a key role on an
Angels squad that had a shot at the
playoffs. Now. though, all that may
have fallen to pieces before the season
even began, as accusations are living
about Matthews purchasing illegal
performance-enhancing drugs over
the Internet. And so. before he's even

taken his first at-bat with his new
team, which spent plenty of money to
land him this offseason, Matthews is
already the "bad guy" in LA.
Suddenly, Angels owner Arte
Moreno is disappointed that
Matthews has yet to make a statement
regarding the allegations hovering
over his head. Angels fans have to be
wondering,"l low did it all happen?"
Because this isn't a guy they've
identified with for years. They didn't
see 11is meteoric rise in offensive pro
duction last season that propelled him
to a big payday a few months back. In
the frenzy of offseason spending, no
one thought to be suspicious of a play
er who hit .313 in his contract year,but
had never before done better than
.27(i. A player who also notched ca
reer highs in home runs. RBI and slug
ging percentage was branded a one
year wonder, not a possible cheater.
But I'm not here to say that, if the
allegations of illegal drug use are true.
Matthews cheated his new team, the
tradition of baseball or his family
name. Because the ones who were
truly cheated in all this were the An
gels fans, who suddenly have to hear

ahout a scandal surrounding a player
they don't even really know.
And that's the danger of free
agency. Mv father grew up in San
Francisco in the same neighborhood
as Giants Hall of Famer Willie Mc-
Covey. who played roughly 15 of his
20 Major League seasons with San
Francisco. McCovey, who was indict
ed for and pled guilty to tax evasion in
1995, wasn't completely free from
scandal. But at least when all the local
papers wrote about it. there was a feel
ing that the bad press was offset by the
years of services rendered — seasons
of home runs, clutch hits and good,
and heartbreaking, memories, that
made it all seem worth it nevertheless.
In the era of free agency, as players
in all the major sports switch teams
more frequently than ever before, that
kind of history is becoming rare. And
so I can't help feeling that it's not
Matthews who cheated the Angels, it's
free agency that has cheated the fans.
But,hey, the 49ers just signed a Pro
Bowl corner. So maybe it's worth it.

as Giants Hall of Famer Willie Mc-
Covey. who played roughly 15 of his
20 Major League seasons with San
Francisco. McCovey, who was indict
ed for and pled guilty to tax evasion in
1995, wasn't completely free from
scandal. But at least when all the local
papers wrote about it. there was a feel
ing that the bad press was offset by the
years of services rendered — seasons
of home runs, clutch hits and good,
and heartbreaking, memories, that
made it all seem worth it nevertheless.
In the era of free agency, as players
in all the major sports switch teams
more frequently than ever before, that
kind of history is becoming rare. And
so I can't help feeling that it's not
Matthews who cheated the Angels, it's
free agency that has cheated the fans.
But,hey, the 49ers just signed a Pro
Bowl corner. So maybe it's worth it.
