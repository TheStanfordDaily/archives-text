# Offseason dealings
## 
### 
Free agency. It's like Christmas
for some teams and like pulling
teeth for others. In the sporting
world, the attention given to the sign
ing periods of the three major sports
(Let's he honest, people couldn't care
less which stars the NHL's Phoenix
Coyotes sign this offseason.) reflects
the modern fan's need for entertain
ment year round. Sure, the casual fan
is happy with just watching the occa
sional game and sharing the excite
ment of a playoff race, hut for the
diehards,the season never really ends.
I, of course, consider myself one
such diehard, and 1 always thought the
offseason was an underrated form of
entertainment. Seeing an exciting star
changing teams to become the face of
a new franchise was just as much fun
as watching an established veteran
slug his way to a batting title, or lead
his team in rushing or put up 30 points
in a late-season triple-double to lead
his team to a key win over a rival.
But now, 1 have to wonder ... Is it
really all it's cracked up to be?
As a fan of the NFL's San Francis
co 49ers, this was an exciting week for
me. For the first time in my memory as
a fan. it was the team I followed that
was dishing out the big money for
proven players who could come in and
make an impact right away, maybe
even helping the once proud Niners
regain a spot in the playoffs.
But somewhere between last Fri
day's record $80-million signing for a
defensive player, Nate Clements, and
yesterday's signing of the consider
ably less exciting Fully Banta-Cain, I
realized something: 1 really have no
idea who any of these guys are.
I mean, sure, I've heard the hype
and I've read the player bios. For
some, I've even gone so far as to read
the local Philadelphia, Buffalo or
Boston papers to see what they've had
to say about the most recent additions
to my favorite team.
