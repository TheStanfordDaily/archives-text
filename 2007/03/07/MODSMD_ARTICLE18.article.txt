pull this one out. We felt really good
about how things happened today.
ITiis tournament was definitely a

the fact that this golf course is diffi
cult and tricky, but I'm happy with
the end result."

today, helping him individually as
well as the team. He is very consis
tent and doesn 't make a lot of mental
mistakes. It is neat to see him contin
ue to be successful, lie works hard
on finishing as high as he can. I le is
also mentally mature for his age. He
plays like a senior even though he is
a freshman."
Just three strokes behind Bram
lett were junior RobGrube and sen
