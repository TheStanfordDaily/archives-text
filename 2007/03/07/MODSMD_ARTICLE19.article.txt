## Editorial Board Goodbye to psych legend Zimbardo 
### 
From Albert Bandura and his work on so
cial modeling to Phillip Zimbardo with
his widely known Stanford Prison Ex
periment. Stanford's Jordan Hall has housed
quite literally the "a"-to-"z"s of psychology's
superstar public intellectuals for the last four
decades. Stanford's well deserved reputation
as America's premier site for studying psy
chology has been cultivated in no small way
by the continuing energy and brilliance of
Professor Emeritus Phillip Zimbardo. At his
final lecture in an official University capacity
today from 11-12:15 in Room 40 of Jordan
Hall, Zimbardo will close the book on a re
markable tenure here at Stanford.
In his controversial experiment on total in
stitutions in 1971, Zimbardo put Stanford into
the minds of every high school psychology
student and armchair social scientist. In a tes
tament to the continuing relevance of the les
sons learned from the Stanford Prison Exper
iment, Zimbardo displayed slides from that
experiment in his presentation for a confer
ence last quarter on "Thinking Humanity
after Abu Ghraib." His argument that we
should think of the guards at Abu Ghraib not
as "bad apples" who are aberrations from the

norm, but as regular apples who were in a
faulty barrel, are shaping contemporary dis
course on prison abuse.
While most of us could hardly imagine
having a textbook with as many printings as
freshmen have years, Zimbardo's Psychology
and Life is now in its 18th edition. Not content
with the acclaim he has won as a researcher
and teacher. Zimbardo has applied psycho
logical findings to issues of morality and poli
cy as well.These will be reflected as he speaks
on "The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How
Good People Turn Evil" today.
Although Stanford will greatly miss the
presence of this household name and world
class thinker, one can imagine no better end
to his career than a continuation of the cru
sade that was started at Stanford decades ago
to take a closer look at the psychological ef
fects of prisons. With half a century of teach
ing under his belt, the stamina to continue
producing new knowledge in his experiments
and the courage to level that knowledge
against dehumanizing social institutions,Zim
bardo embodies the fundamental standard
and entrepreneurial spirit that Stanford seeks
to instill in all its affiliates.
