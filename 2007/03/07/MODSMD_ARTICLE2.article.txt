## NEW COACH ON CAMPUS Harbaugh enthusiastic, optimistic, realistic 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
New football head coach Jim
I iarbaugh took the reins in Decem
ber pledging "an enthusiasm un
known to mankind." Three months
into his tenure, the program has an
all-new coaching staff and he has an
nounced the 2007 recruiting class.
With spring practice beginning in a
month. Harbaugh sat down with the
Daily to discuss how he has settled
into his new digs, how to pump up the
student body and who on the team is
ready for a breakout season.
Stanford Daily: What was the time
line of the hiring process?
Jim Harhaugh: 1 saw the job was
available, then 1 was contacted by
Bill Walsh first — it might have been
December 5 or 6 — then 1 heard
from Bob [Bowlsby] later that week.
Bill called and he just said that he'd
like me to apply for the job, then I
heard from Bob who set up the San
Diego interview. 1 remember the job
came open on a Monday, and then I
heard from Bob on Thursday or Fri
day. My first reaction was just, from
the time I heard the job was available
to the time I interviewed for the job
to the time I accepted the job, that I
really had a vision and a plan for
what Stanford could be. And as far as

when I was offered the job, 1 went
through two interviews and was just
thrilled. I le offered me the job and it
was like (snaps]. And Bob said' Don't
you want to talk about the contract
or anything?' Nope, too late I accept
the job.' In the span of twelve days.
SI): I low are you adapting to a Divi
sion l-A football office?
.///: Well, first, I've always said the
best thing about taking this job is that
the hardest things are easier. Iliere
was already a great tradition of foot
ball here; there was already tremen
dous support from alumni and from
the athletic department. The hardest
things are already there, and it's so
much easier coming into this type of
situation. It's just about firing up the
energy and getting it going in the
right direction.
SD: At the (Division I-AA| Univer
sity of San Diego, you only had four
full-time assistants.
.///: We have the staff in place now, so
that was big. Getting the recruiting
class done, those things were going
on simultaneously. Hiring more
coaches, it's great. 1 love having more
full-time coaches and the staff we
have is a combination of young guys
