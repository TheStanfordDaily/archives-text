## NEW COACH ON CAMPUS Harbaugh enthusiastic, optimistic, realistic 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
New football head coach Jim
I iarbaugh took the reins in Decem
ber pledging "an enthusiasm un
known to mankind." Three months
into his tenure, the program has an
all-new coaching staff and he has an
nounced the 2007 recruiting class.
With spring practice beginning in a
month. Harbaugh sat down with the
Daily to discuss how he has settled
into his new digs, how to pump up the
student body and who on the team is
ready for a breakout season.
Stanford Daily: What was the time
line of the hiring process?
Jim Harhaugh: 1 saw the job was
available, then 1 was contacted by
Bill Walsh first — it might have been
December 5 or 6 — then 1 heard
from Bob [Bowlsby] later that week.
Bill called and he just said that he'd
like me to apply for the job, then I
heard from Bob who set up the San
Diego interview. 1 remember the job
came open on a Monday, and then I
heard from Bob on Thursday or Fri
day. My first reaction was just, from
the time I heard the job was available
to the time I interviewed for the job
to the time I accepted the job, that I
really had a vision and a plan for
what Stanford could be. And as far as

when I was offered the job, 1 went
through two interviews and was just
thrilled. I le offered me the job and it
was like (snaps]. And Bob said' Don't
you want to talk about the contract
or anything?' Nope, too late I accept
the job.' In the span of twelve days.
SI): I low are you adapting to a Divi
sion l-A football office?
.///: Well, first, I've always said the
best thing about taking this job is that
the hardest things are easier. Iliere
was already a great tradition of foot
ball here; there was already tremen
dous support from alumni and from
the athletic department. The hardest
things are already there, and it's so
much easier coming into this type of
situation. It's just about firing up the
energy and getting it going in the
right direction.
SD: At the (Division I-AA| Univer
sity of San Diego, you only had four
full-time assistants.
.///: We have the staff in place now, so
that was big. Getting the recruiting
class done, those things were going
on simultaneously. Hiring more
coaches, it's great. 1 love having more
full-time coaches and the staff we
have is a combination of young guys

and experienced coaches who are ex
cellent teachers and really care about
the players as not just a means to an
end. blit actually [think about| the
next sixty years of their life. In my esti
mation, they're guys of excellent char
acter. and we're really proud of the
staff we've put together.
SI): You've said you are a hands-on
coach. What is your plan for delegat
ing to the staff?
.Ill: ITiere's a whole system in place
for delegating — coaching positions,
off-the-field liaisons to different de
partments.
I hope you don't get the impression
that this [is] going to turn around just
because I got hired. It's going to be a
team effort with everybody — the

athletic department, which is the best;
Boh Bovvlsby and his staff, unbeliev
able; the strength coaches in place; it's
coaches; it's players; it's the Stanford
football community. You don't just
change a Hat tire by sw itching the driv
er. A lot of things go into it.
SI): Your father and your brother are
both coaches. What will their involve
ment be in your program?
.Ill: They're my mentors in the game
as well as the guys here on the staff.
My dad I know is going to be out here
a lot. just as a parent wanting to watch
and lend his experience and expertise
to different questions. It's just a great
resource.
SI): Being a good player doesn't nec

essarilv translate to becoming a good
coach — what in your playing experi
ence do you think helps your coaching
ability?
JH: Probably two things: I think, one.
probably all coaches draw off of their
playing experience and their coaching
experience — who they've worked
with or worked for. 1 think for every
body. in a sense, our playing experi
ence comes into play. I think that.and
there's some credibility there. When I
talk to recruits and players about
making Stanford a conduit to the Na
tional Football League. I think I know
how to do that and there's credibility
there,and I think they'll listen to me.
And the staff too, there's guys who
know how to do that and we want that.

We want the Stanford football pro
gram to be a conduit to the National
Football League.
SI): You've played under a lot of big
name coaches. Is there anything con
crete you use as a coach that comes
from them?
.Ill: So many things. My dad and
Coach Schembechler, I'm kind of a
combination of those two. I don't

think you try and copy them, or try to
be like them. It's almost like they will
their DNA on you. You're not taking
notes to be like them. And then there
was Mike Ditka and Lindy Infante,
and now Bill Walsh. He's right across
the hall, and he's another resource.
I've asked him a number of different
questions and just the dialogue and
the resource is tremendous. 1 don't
know if ninny people have had the luck
I've had my dad whs one of the best
coaches to evei coach the game, I've
played for living legends like Mo
Schembechlcr and Mike Ditka and
now I'm working across the hall from
Bill Walsh.
Sl>: I'wo classes ol students have
passed through Stanford without see
ing i winning season in football. Mow
do you market the program to the stu
denls.and why should they c(>me out to
see this team?
JH: I think we've got to get to them.
We've really got to seek 'hem out —
find the dormitories fin I the fraterni
ties and go to them and get them in
terested get them excited about using
their ticket. And we're not going to
wait until the I all to do that. We've ai
re adv begun to do that, inviting people
to our workouts and spring practice,
making it open. I hey'll see the excite
ment in Spring ball. They'll be excited

about using their ticket, but I think we
need togotothem so they'll be excited.
But I think it's a tremendous student
body. I mean, you go to the basketball
games and it's so obvious that the stu
dents here really care about sports. But
you've got to win: that's the big one.
America doesn't like a loser.
SI): Who on the team now jumps out at
you as someone who has really been
contributing or showing ability?
.///: I think Allen Smith is a tremen
dous left tackle. Wopamo Osaisai is an
All I'ac-K) guy. so guys that are just
Pac-10 guys can help us win a champi
onship. I Tie two receivers — Mark
Bradford, who didn't play last year,
but I assume lie's going to be an excel
lent football player for us (same as
Kvan Moore).and then Richard Sher
man. In those three I think we've got
the best receiving corps in the Pac-10.
I'oby (ierhart 's a real football player.
Anthony Kimble. I think once he gets
to the point where he can run between
the tackles — he's a little bit more of
the type of an outside runner, but
we're training him to run up between
the tackles — I think he can be an all
purpose back. The centers. Mattran

and Alex Fletcher— I'm looking for
ward to getting him back, he's a real
football player. 1 like the tight end
quite a bit.
Defensively, I like the two inside
guys, Sione Fua and Ekom Udofia — 1
think he's an excellent football player.
I think Pannel Egboh has a chance to
be a great player. I le's a good player
right now and he's got too much talent
just to be a good player. The safeties,
that's a big position for us in terms of
evaluation in the spring. I think that Bo
McNally could be an excellent safety
or strong safety. I really like Clinton
Snyder a lot; 1 think he'll be a very good
football player. 1 think some other guys
were playing out of position and that
will all be part of the spring evaluation.
There's a couple of defensive guys who
could be playing offense, and vice
versa.
There's going to be a lot of excite
ment this spring, finding the best eleven
guys on offense and the best eleven on
defense and the right backups and spe
cialty players, That's what our staff is re
ally focused on right now: evaluating
every player on the team.
