# I'm sorry, taste buds

### 
I love ice cream. I could eat ice cream for
every meal without hesitation — any
brand, any flavor, any time of day. I actu
ally worked at an ice cream parlor during
high school. While this job would cause most
people to become sick of the dairy delight,
my love only grew stronger. It is my favorite
food, always and forever.
The only food 1 might love as much as ice
cream is meat. Grilled, fried, baked — it real
ly doesn't matter. There is nothing like a big
piece of cooked carcass. If someone invented
a meat-flavored ice cream I would buy it in
heartbeat. In case you're wondering, I did try
to create such a thing: it ended in vomit and a
waste of perfectly good vanilla ice cream.
When Fat Tuesday rolled around. I decid
ed I needed to curb my gluttony by giving up
one of my loves. Since Wednesday happens to
be the ice cream delivery day for my eating
club, my decision was made for me. For the
next forty days and forty nights I would be
vegetarian: no succulent chicken, no juicy
beef and no disgusting fish. (Note: Due to a
traumatic childhood experience I have not
eaten anything that comes from the ocean
since I was seven years old.)
Before coming to college, I thought peo
ple were only vegetarian if they had some
sort of disease — the worst kind, of course,
being a "vegan." Poor vegans, I thought.
Modern science will find a cure for them
someday. I also assumed "tofu" was another
kooky Stanford acronym I didn't under
stand, hopefully short for some kind of meat.
Perhaps it was a product of being in Cali
fornia for too long, or having too many hippy
friends, but my ignorance slowly disap
peared.
I learned there are many justifications for
such absurd eating behavior, beginning with
the health benefits. Sure, meat is packed with
fat and bare of most vitamins and minerals,
but it will always have one thing: flavor. Study

after study showing the health benefits of
vegetarian diets were not enough for me to
sacrifice my favorite food group. Also, the re
cent scare of E. coli wasn't making greens
look any more appealing. Maybe if they
called it "Mad Spinach Disease," Popeye's fa
vorite food would be pork.
If the impending heart attack isn't enough
to scare you away, there are the added im
moral actions of the meat industry. Twinkies,
though more unhealthy than meat, are not
jacked up with sickly growth hormones,
aren't raised to be brutally slaughtered and
don't cause an environmental toll that is both
grossly underestimated and completely un
sustainable. No. that's not a flower in my hair;
I've simply driven down 1-5. For most vege
tarians this is icing on the cake. For myself. I
was still lukewarm to the idea. Maybe if there
was a slaughterhouse next door I would be
shocked into abstaining, but to be honest I
am just too separated from the atrocities.
When a delicious filet niignon is already rest
ing on my plate my taste buds always over
power my moral intuition.
Since health and morals wouldn't do it, 1
realized I needed an extra push to fall off the
carnivorous cliff. That's where the Big Guy
in the sky comes into the picture. My Lenten
sacrifice may seem silly but. assuming God
knows the deliciousness of a teriyaki chick
en bowl, my steadfast renunciation of meat
