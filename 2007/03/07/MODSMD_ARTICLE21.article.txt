"Aportionalism" overlooks realities
of conflict
What Israel is doing in the context of this
terror war being waged daily against its
civilians is not apartheid. It is restrained
self-defense. Before this war. none of the re
strictive measures used by Israel were in
place. ITiese measures would disappear
were the war to stop.
There is neither truth nor accuracy to Mr.
Gu's assertions. In fact, quite the opposite,
the assertion of Israeli "apartheid" obfus
cates the reality of Arab terror war and ends
up blaming the victim.
He claims a moral responsibility to use
the word 'apartheid' but he apparently has
tailed to read the dozens of articles written
by Muslim and Jewish and Christian schol
ars, and published even in such anti-Israel
periodicals as the IJK Guardian, all declar
ing that the term 'apartheid' cannot and
should not be applied to Israel s defensive
measures against Palestinian terrorism. It is
an intentional mis-use of the term, a propa
ganda trick todemonize Israel.
And this misuse of the term is a disserv
ice to Palestinians because it encourages the
reader to ignore, or worse, to hide, the truth
about the Arab intentions and actions
against Israel.
Israel is defending itself against a terror
war that has already launched more than
28.000 attacks, killing more than 1,7()0 Is

raelis (Jewish. Muslim, and Christian) and
wounding almost 7,(KX). The very best way
to show support for the Palestinian people,
and to alleviate their suffering, is to pressure
our government to pressure Hamas to stop
its war against Israel.
Mr. Gu decries the check-points and
road blocks as an example of "old school"
apartheid. Me seems not to know that be
fore the terror war. there were no check
points. For 27 years from 1%7 to 1994 there
were almost no checkpoints anywhere in the
West Bank or Gaza Strip. The checkpoints
came in to being only when Israel had to de
fend itself against terrorist invasions, and to
stop the entry of innocent looking Palestin
ian men and women who had 20 lbs of TNT
strapped to their underwear. And when the
terror war stops, the check-points can stop.
Unlike the mistreatment of blacks in
South Africa, the checkpoints were not cre
ated to beat and oppress and humiliate and
delay and inconvenience the Palestinians.
They were created to stop terrorism. End
the terror threat, make peace, and then Is
rael can remove the checkpoints. There is
no country in the world that would do any
differently than Israel is doing now, and
many have done far, far worse.
Mr. Gu mentions "bantustans" and UN
Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 242.
and in doing so completely decontextualizes
