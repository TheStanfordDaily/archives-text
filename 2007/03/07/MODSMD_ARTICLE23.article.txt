Russia does everything better.Their liter
ature is the most brilliant, their ice
skaters are the most attractive and their
former leaders are ... the most embalmed. Re
ally, if you look past the slight miscalculation of
communism and that whole, y'know. massive
genocide of their own people under Stalin, the
administration is pretty faultless. And one of
the best things it's given us is one of my favorite
holidays of all time: International Women's
Day.
Granted,back in the good ol' USSR. Inter
national Women's Day (celebrated March
Bth — mark your calendars!) was largely a
propagandistic affair, run with the perhaps
overly optimistic hope that if men put down
their shot glasses and picked up a present for
the little lady then Soviet women might some
how be inspired to pop out fourteen or fifteen
more kids. As it remains in the present day,
though. International Women's Day is kind of
like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day rolled
up into one. Except instead of stocking up on
candy hearts or making hideous jewelry out
of macaroni (seriously, please restrain your
self), men simply take a moment to write out
a card or make a little gesture to appreciate
the women in their lives.
Some belligerent opponents of the holiday
object: "How come if there's a Women's Day
there's no Men's Day,huh?" Honestly, I'm not
stubbly-pitted feminist enough to say that in

Soviet Russia every day was men's day; this
holiday isn't about celebrating women to the
exclusion of men: It's about celebrating
women. Period. Take a look at the women in
your life. Really reflect on how much they in
spire you, encourage you, support you. Surely
this merits at least one cheesy e-card.
Personally, there are scores of women I
know to whom I am deeply grateful. My moth
er, my high school English teacher, my advisor
in the Slavic Lit department, the manager at
Tresidder Express, my freshman RA. Among
all of these incredible women, though, there is
one about whom I wish to speak: a woman
who touches my life every day and who has
completely changed my perspective on the
very nature of femininity.
On July 31. 1986. Victoria Alexandrovna
Degtyareva was born in the heart of the for
mer USSR, a squalling, red, dampish lump.
Over the past twenty years, little has changed.
Her father is, by profession, a mathematician

— a vital career in a regime which time and
time again had to prove to its populace that
one apartment divided by 49 people equals vi
able living situation. J ier mother was a student
in "Economical Engineering" or, translated
from Russian, Rhetoric of Justified Paranoia.
In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Vicky pried apart the Iron Curtain, finger by
finger,entering the United States as a political
refugee (in Russia, this means anyone whose
grandparents eat knishes). After alighting
upon the fair burgh of Riverside, California.
Vicky quickly joined an ESL playground
gang, where she gained her street credibility
and questionable lexicon of fractured Ameri
can slang. However, at the end of the second
grade, the gang was broken up when its mem
bers returned to their respective countries,
and Vicky was left with nothing but her
dashed dreams and a tendency to confuse The
Fonz with Rosie the Riveter.
High school was smoother sailing for
Vicky, who was renowned among her peers as
a fashion plate (stripes with a tropical print: al
ways in vogue) and a rabid boy band fan. To
this very day, the faintest strains of "Bye Bye
Bye" cause her to "roll wit' it like a Bolshe
vik." She spent her few 98-Degrees-free hours
dedicated to Mock Trial, leading her school's
team to an unrivaled three-peat as state cham-
