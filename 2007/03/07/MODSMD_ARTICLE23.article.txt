Russia does everything better.Their liter
ature is the most brilliant, their ice
skaters are the most attractive and their
former leaders are ... the most embalmed. Re
ally, if you look past the slight miscalculation of
communism and that whole, y'know. massive
genocide of their own people under Stalin, the
administration is pretty faultless. And one of
the best things it's given us is one of my favorite
holidays of all time: International Women's
Day.
Granted,back in the good ol' USSR. Inter
national Women's Day (celebrated March
Bth — mark your calendars!) was largely a
propagandistic affair, run with the perhaps
overly optimistic hope that if men put down
their shot glasses and picked up a present for
the little lady then Soviet women might some
how be inspired to pop out fourteen or fifteen
more kids. As it remains in the present day,
though. International Women's Day is kind of
like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day rolled
up into one. Except instead of stocking up on
candy hearts or making hideous jewelry out
of macaroni (seriously, please restrain your
self), men simply take a moment to write out
a card or make a little gesture to appreciate
the women in their lives.
Some belligerent opponents of the holiday
object: "How come if there's a Women's Day
there's no Men's Day,huh?" Honestly, I'm not
stubbly-pitted feminist enough to say that in

Soviet Russia every day was men's day; this
holiday isn't about celebrating women to the
exclusion of men: It's about celebrating
women. Period. Take a look at the women in
your life. Really reflect on how much they in
spire you, encourage you, support you. Surely
this merits at least one cheesy e-card.
Personally, there are scores of women I
know to whom I am deeply grateful. My moth
er, my high school English teacher, my advisor
in the Slavic Lit department, the manager at
Tresidder Express, my freshman RA. Among
all of these incredible women, though, there is
one about whom I wish to speak: a woman
who touches my life every day and who has
completely changed my perspective on the
very nature of femininity.
On July 31. 1986. Victoria Alexandrovna
Degtyareva was born in the heart of the for
mer USSR, a squalling, red, dampish lump.
Over the past twenty years, little has changed.
Her father is, by profession, a mathematician

— a vital career in a regime which time and
time again had to prove to its populace that
one apartment divided by 49 people equals vi
able living situation. J ier mother was a student
in "Economical Engineering" or, translated
from Russian, Rhetoric of Justified Paranoia.
In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Vicky pried apart the Iron Curtain, finger by
finger,entering the United States as a political
refugee (in Russia, this means anyone whose
grandparents eat knishes). After alighting
upon the fair burgh of Riverside, California.
Vicky quickly joined an ESL playground
gang, where she gained her street credibility
and questionable lexicon of fractured Ameri
can slang. However, at the end of the second
grade, the gang was broken up when its mem
bers returned to their respective countries,
and Vicky was left with nothing but her
dashed dreams and a tendency to confuse The
Fonz with Rosie the Riveter.
High school was smoother sailing for
Vicky, who was renowned among her peers as
a fashion plate (stripes with a tropical print: al
ways in vogue) and a rabid boy band fan. To
this very day, the faintest strains of "Bye Bye
Bye" cause her to "roll wit' it like a Bolshe
vik." She spent her few 98-Degrees-free hours
dedicated to Mock Trial, leading her school's
team to an unrivaled three-peat as state cham-


the party of Coulter


Kat
Lewin
Atomic Nectarine
pions. Contrary to popular opinion,
the "trials of Degtyareva" refer in fact
to her interest in property law,and not
the inordinate amount of time it takes
her to choose an outfit in the morn
ing.
Currently Vicky attends Stanford
University, where she has been hailed
the crown jewel of the Lantana social
scene, and studies philosophy When a
professor asks her to name a philoso
pher who came up with a non-cate
gorical imperative, she never re
sponds: "I. Kant." She also writes a
brilliant column with an unpro
nounceable name that runs in The
Daily every Monday and almost
never includes lame puns.
In the future history of Vicky, by
the year 2035 she will h;ive stood on
the balcony of a palace in a South
American country and dramatically
raised her arms to quell the hysterical
cheering of a crowd. In 2047 she will
have been entered in Bartleby's quo
tations and philosophy textbooks

worldwide for her groundbreaking
treatise: "1 never lose at Tetris, 1 just
get tired of winning." A statue of her
astride a glorious steed will have been
erected in Paris in 2063. Nicole Kid
man will play Vicky in the movie ver
sion of her life; Yul Brynner plays her
as a child.
Amid all of these great (admittedly
somewhat fictitious) achievements,
there is one that could easily get lost in
the flow:somewhere between the Sovi
et apartments and the slinky ball
gowns, she also managed to change my
life. The first day of freshman year
when 1 complimented her "Barbie
Ciirl" ring tone and she shot me a dis
dainful smirk, I knew we would never
be friends. After three years of sponta
neous badminton games in the Quad,
random emails sent while we are in the
same room, explaining crazy American
slang, six-hour long-distance phone
calls and watching more Germa WWII
movies than Joseph Goebbels. 1 appre
ciate how completely wrong 1 was.
Vicky is one of the most wonderful
women 1 have ever met: She is a bril
liant intellectual, always willing to en
gage in a philosophical discussion or a
spontaneous Saturday morning close
reading of Proust. She is macetul and

elegant, takes pride in her appearance
and strives to present her best possible
face to the world. She is impulsive and
adventurous, up for any crazy adven
ture — even it it will make us look
ridiculous — and the best at making
me see the light when life seems sense
less and bleak. She is independent and
reliable, strong and supportive — in
short, everything that not only a
woman, but a person should be.
And we all have people like this in
our lives, people who it is important to
stop and thank, even if it is just a
cheesy Russian holiday that prompts
you to do so. It is incredible to have
someone in your life about whom you
can say."l love you.and loving you has
made me a better person." Don't take
it for granted. And if you possibly can,
celebrate it with something a step up
from a macaroni necklace.
Vicky, you are the Harper Lee to
my Truman Capote, the Woodward to
my Bernstein, the Marx to my Eingels.
1 love you, buddv.

yareva or have any amusing stories
about her inability to master American
slang, drop Kat a line at klewmi" Stan

treatise: "1 never lose at Tetris, 1 just

as a child.
Amid all of these great (admittedly
somewhat fictitious) achievements,
there is one that could easily get lost in
the flow:somewhere between the Sovi

gowns, she also managed to change my
life. The first day of freshman year
when 1 complimented her "Barbie
Ciirl" ring tone and she shot me a dis
dainful smirk, I knew we would never
be friends. After three years of sponta
neous badminton games in the Quad,
random emails sent while we are in the
same room, explaining crazy American
slang, six-hour long-distance phone
calls and watching more Germa WWII
movies than Joseph Goebbels. 1 appre
ciate how completely wrong 1 was.
Vicky is one of the most wonderful
women 1 have ever met: She is a bril
liant intellectual, always willing to en
gage in a philosophical discussion or a
spontaneous Saturday morning close
reading of Proust. She is macetul and

elegant, takes pride in her appearance
and strives to present her best possible
face to the world. She is impulsive and
adventurous, up for any crazy adven
ture — even it it will make us look
ridiculous — and the best at making
me see the light when life seems sense
less and bleak. She is independent and
reliable, strong and supportive — in
short, everything that not only a
woman, but a person should be.
And we all have people like this in
our lives, people who it is important to
stop and thank, even if it is just a
cheesy Russian holiday that prompts
you to do so. It is incredible to have
someone in your life about whom you
can say."l love you.and loving you has
made me a better person." Don't take
it for granted. And if you possibly can,
celebrate it with something a step up
from a macaroni necklace.
Vicky, you are the Harper Lee to
my Truman Capote, the Woodward to
my Bernstein, the Marx to my Eingels.
1 love you, buddv.

Russia does everything better.Their liter
ature is the most brilliant, their ice
skaters are the most attractive and their
former leaders are ... the most embalmed. Re
ally, if you look past the slight miscalculation of
communism and that whole, y'know. massive
genocide of their own people under Stalin, the
administration is pretty faultless. And one of
the best things it's given us is one of my favorite
holidays of all time: International Women's
Day.
Granted,back in the good ol' USSR. Inter
national Women's Day (celebrated March
Bth — mark your calendars!) was largely a
propagandistic affair, run with the perhaps
overly optimistic hope that if men put down
their shot glasses and picked up a present for
the little lady then Soviet women might some
how be inspired to pop out fourteen or fifteen
more kids. As it remains in the present day,
though. International Women's Day is kind of
like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day rolled
up into one. Except instead of stocking up on
candy hearts or making hideous jewelry out
of macaroni (seriously, please restrain your
self), men simply take a moment to write out
a card or make a little gesture to appreciate
the women in their lives.
Some belligerent opponents of the holiday
object: "How come if there's a Women's Day
there's no Men's Day,huh?" Honestly, I'm not
stubbly-pitted feminist enough to say that in

Soviet Russia every day was men's day; this
holiday isn't about celebrating women to the
exclusion of men: It's about celebrating
women. Period. Take a look at the women in
your life. Really reflect on how much they in
spire you, encourage you, support you. Surely
this merits at least one cheesy e-card.
Personally, there are scores of women I
know to whom I am deeply grateful. My moth
er, my high school English teacher, my advisor
in the Slavic Lit department, the manager at
Tresidder Express, my freshman RA. Among
all of these incredible women, though, there is
one about whom I wish to speak: a woman
who touches my life every day and who has
completely changed my perspective on the
very nature of femininity.
On July 31. 1986. Victoria Alexandrovna
Degtyareva was born in the heart of the for
mer USSR, a squalling, red, dampish lump.
