Iwill not be the first to say that I love Face
hook groups. I am usually very much in
favor of the idea of mindlessly copying the
ideas of "clever" people at other colleges and
creating a "Stanford Chapter," or of overzeal
ously supporting my political candidate so
that strangers can classify me in terms of
broadly defined stereotypes. But there is a
new movement cropping up.and it is a clear vi
olation of the sanctity of the Facebook group
feature: sophomore president election slates.
No doubt you. the reader, have received an in
vitation to one or more these groups yourself,
and marveled at the creativity of our class
mates â€” or dire, dire, lack thereof.
While I could easily write a scathing anti
student government tract, instead. I have de
cided to hand out awards to these aspiring
candidates. After all. the time commitment in
volved in devising such clever groups, and in
inviting the entirety of the Facebook-fre
quenting population at Stanford, really must
be impressive.
Without further ado. let us proceed with
the show.
We should begin with the category of best
name. This was definitely a tough decision.

Perhaps I should note first off that we have
nothing to compare to the great "2008 De
grees," a play on the boy band 1,910 numbers
removed from its group title. In the end. how
ever, the award goes to...(building suspense)...
"Soph Serve."
A reference to the phrase "soft serve," used
to describe frozen yogurt-style ice cream, the
group conjures images of Stanford's favorite
after-dinner snack. But at the same time, it
sneaks in a witty pun. For you see, there is no
"t" at the end of the word "Soph," and it is mis
spelled. It just so happens that "sophomore"
begins with this same syllable, a fact which
group has very keenly picked up on. This cre
ates an aura of unmistakable whimsy.
The group continues with this whimsical

approach in naming of their officers. Featuring
Liz "Berry" Burstein (Because it's allitera
tive), Phil "VaniH" Hon (because it rhymes
with his first name), Julian "Brownie" Kelly
(because, well ... he's Black), and Deawodi
"Delish" Ladzekpo (Because there are few
actual ice cream flavors that begin with "d" or
"1"), Soph Serve takes the metaphor of ice
cream and runs with it. scoring a touchdown in
our hearts and minds. Bravo, Soph Serve. 1
guess you could say I give you two spoons up!
Our next award is for Best Logic. This
clearly goes to "The Giving Tree." Its descrip
tion is as follows: "If you liked (or cried over)
the tree in the book, you'll 10ve... what The
Giving Tree believes our class should stand
for: Giving." Not sure what the crying has to
do with any of this, but so far, seems pretty rea
sonable.
In the body paragraph, the author really
shows off his/her logical exactitude: "We be
lieve we have a duty to stand as a class for so
cial causes at home and abroad.That said, this
year Stanford raised close to one billion dol
lars. almost double that of the second-leading


Nat
Hillard
Not-ural Philosophy
university."
A powerful statistic, indeed, cer
tainly properly placed and meaning
ful in this context. This statistic has
everything to do with this group's
commitment to social causes. The
tact that this is double the amount of
the second-leading university is a
well-phrased and relevant fact to in
clude here.
If you loved The Giving Tree the
book, when you were five years old
and weren t able to make logical con
nections between two ideas, you'll re
ally like The Giving Tree slate, dedi
cated to employing the same kind of
logic 14 years later. Way to go. The
Giving Tree. I guess you could say I
give you two limbs up! I iaha!
ITie last award is reserved for the
best: Best Overall. Hie clear winner
here is the great "Slate in a Box,"
whose picture features Hoover tower
with a gift box appropriately placed

over the "hell end" of its undeniably
phallic body. Declaring themselves,
"the total package," they share their
love tor "the zestiest hatch to ever
rock the Stanford campus."
They offer three simple steps to
ward petitioning their names to ap
pear on the ballet:
"1: Click on http://petitions.stanford.

2: Select Slate in a Box
3: Petition Slate in a Box!
We're your Slate in a Box!"
Slate in a Box. you have received
my wholehearted endorsement. 1
have no idea what you stand for. or
actually, who any of you are, but I
feel that in the issue-oriented world
of class elections, you are the clear
leaders. While your admittedly
vague and noncommittal stance on.
well, everything, is slightly troubling,
I couldn't help but sing along with
your catchy song. The syllables are
right on! (Just try it. readers). And
your commitment to badass-itude is
readily apparent.
In the campaign for Senate.it must
be remarked. I note a startling lack of
any kind of unnecessary and inten

tionally misspelled acronymic titles.
In fact, there is an almost horrifying
attachment to the antiquated idea of
"credentials".These guys should seri
ously lighten up. They need to take a
page from the book of the glorious
Slate in a Box. and post pictures of
themselves dressed like pirates and
holding 19th century revolvers. Shy
away from the "issues." and focus in
stead on creating an appropriately
mindless surface-level metaphor.
In deciding who is going to have
the best material with which to fill
their resume several years from now
(because we all know that class elec
tions are ultimately meaningless and
student government is a pointless,
floppy dong). it is important to keep
our priorities straight. Keep in mind
these awards as you click the decline
button, and seriously consider issues
that we really have no power to
change.
