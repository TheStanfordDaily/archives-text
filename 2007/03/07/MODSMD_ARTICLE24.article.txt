Iwill not be the first to say that I love Face
hook groups. I am usually very much in
favor of the idea of mindlessly copying the
ideas of "clever" people at other colleges and
creating a "Stanford Chapter," or of overzeal
ously supporting my political candidate so
that strangers can classify me in terms of
broadly defined stereotypes. But there is a
new movement cropping up.and it is a clear vi
olation of the sanctity of the Facebook group
feature: sophomore president election slates.
No doubt you. the reader, have received an in
vitation to one or more these groups yourself,
and marveled at the creativity of our class
mates â€” or dire, dire, lack thereof.
While I could easily write a scathing anti
student government tract, instead. I have de
cided to hand out awards to these aspiring
candidates. After all. the time commitment in
volved in devising such clever groups, and in
inviting the entirety of the Facebook-fre
quenting population at Stanford, really must
be impressive.
Without further ado. let us proceed with
the show.
We should begin with the category of best
name. This was definitely a tough decision.

Perhaps I should note first off that we have
nothing to compare to the great "2008 De
grees," a play on the boy band 1,910 numbers
removed from its group title. In the end. how
ever, the award goes to...(building suspense)...
"Soph Serve."
A reference to the phrase "soft serve," used
to describe frozen yogurt-style ice cream, the
group conjures images of Stanford's favorite
after-dinner snack. But at the same time, it
sneaks in a witty pun. For you see, there is no
"t" at the end of the word "Soph," and it is mis
spelled. It just so happens that "sophomore"
begins with this same syllable, a fact which
group has very keenly picked up on. This cre
ates an aura of unmistakable whimsy.
The group continues with this whimsical

approach in naming of their officers. Featuring
Liz "Berry" Burstein (Because it's allitera
tive), Phil "VaniH" Hon (because it rhymes
with his first name), Julian "Brownie" Kelly
(because, well ... he's Black), and Deawodi
"Delish" Ladzekpo (Because there are few
actual ice cream flavors that begin with "d" or
"1"), Soph Serve takes the metaphor of ice
cream and runs with it. scoring a touchdown in
our hearts and minds. Bravo, Soph Serve. 1
guess you could say I give you two spoons up!
Our next award is for Best Logic. This
clearly goes to "The Giving Tree." Its descrip
tion is as follows: "If you liked (or cried over)
the tree in the book, you'll 10ve... what The
Giving Tree believes our class should stand
for: Giving." Not sure what the crying has to
do with any of this, but so far, seems pretty rea
sonable.
In the body paragraph, the author really
shows off his/her logical exactitude: "We be
lieve we have a duty to stand as a class for so
cial causes at home and abroad.That said, this
year Stanford raised close to one billion dol
lars. almost double that of the second-leading
