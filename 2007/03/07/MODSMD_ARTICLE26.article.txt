# Missy Penna Softball
## Softball's ace in the circle 
### 
Entering the 21X)7 season. Stanford soft hall was pro
jected to he a team that would score in hunches.
With two offensive standouts — sophomore
Muddy ('oon and senior Jackie Rinehart — listed
on the Top-50 Watch-List for the USA Softball
National ( ollegiate Plaverol the Year Award, the Cardinal
was expected to score early and often this season. For the
most part, coach John Rittman's squad has done just that,
scoi ing six or more runs in ten games this season.
But it's still nice tor the No. 8 Cardinal (16-5) to know
that when the offense isn't running on ail cylinders.sopho
more pitcher Mis-a Penna most likely has the situation cov
ered.
Stanford's recent road trip to the FIU/Adidas Invita
tional was a homecoming of sorts for Penna, who grew up
in Mi tmi. Ha.'The Cardinal starter made every moment of
tin tournament memorable,as Stanford used Henna's four
spectacular performances to sweep the competition for the
tournament title.
For the stellar sophomore, the trip was enjoyable be
cause her family and friends could see just how far she had
come as a player.
It was nice to see m\ family and to perform well where
they could see." I'enna said. "I Jsually they don't get to see
me play that much.so I think they really enjoyed it — it was
a lot of fun."
It must have been considerably less fun for her oppo
nents. Penna started f< »ur games and went 4-0 at the tourna
ment, earning three shutouts. With Penna in the circle.Stan
ford downed Florida International. Purdue.Texas State and
Marist. She finished the weekend with 38 strikeouts and no
runs allowed. Perhaps most impressive of all. the Stanford
hurler allowed only six hits and three walks in 23.1 innings
pitched.
Still. Penna believes she can always better her game.
I ver> day I'm learning something new," she said."lt's
not .i had thing to learn from our mistakes.and I think I try
to do that Ihere are always improvements you can make
nothing's ever going to be perfect."
"Some days are good, some days are bad," she contin
ued II there's one thing I'd like to focus on, it's the ability
to work through it when things aren't going so well, to make
m\ weaknesses into more of a strength. My job is to pitch.
1 vcryone has a job on the team, and if we all do our jobs.

we can't ask for more than that."
For her fantastic efforts at the FIU/Adidas Invitational.
Penna was named the Pacific-10 Conference Pitcher of the
Week for Feb. 20-26. If she keeps performing at her current
level.it won't be the last honor she earns this season. Penna
leads the conference with a .123 opposing batting average,
is second in the Pac-10 with a 0.82 ERA and is tied for third
with 99 strikeouts.
Stanford rode a 14-game winning streak into the Worth
Classic last weekend, where the Cardinal cooled some
what, going 2-3 at the tournament in Fullerton, Calif. Prior
to that remarkable run. however. Rittman saw his starter's
game coming together on Feb. 18. After a 4-1 victory over
Missouri gave the Cardinal the Stanford Invitational
('hampionship. he said that the sophomore was "becoming
a complete pitcher."
Stanford softball will need that maturation process to
continue this season if the squad hopes to succeed in a
tough conference — all eight of the teams in the Pac-10
were ranked in the preseason top 25. Despite a solid record,
the Cardinal still finds itself fifth in the Pac-10. trailing No.
3 Arizona State (21-2), No. 25 Oregon (20-2), No. 15 Wash
ington (15-2) and No. 4 Arizona (14-3). And, heading into
the Worth Classic, Penna expected that the competition
would only become fiercer in the coming weeks.
"It's going to be tough." Penna said. "It's definitely going
to get harder as we go ahead into these tournaments com
ing up. but that's going to prepare us for the end of the sea
son We have a lot of talent, and 1 think that once we all
come together (which we're doing) as a team. I feel like we
can be pretty successful. If we give it our all, we won't be dis
appointed."
