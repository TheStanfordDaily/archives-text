# Online petitions transform efforts
## Web-only special fees option changes strategy, tactics 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
By now, everyone on campus has likely
received multiple emails from various stu
dent groups petitioning to get on the
spring special fees ballot. Due to changes
made to the special fees signature process,
student groups requesting funding have
had to shelve their clipboards and paper
lists in favor of a flurry of mass emails.
The new electronic signature process
requires all groups to gather signatures
through an online petition. To "sign," a
student must enter a valid last name, stu
dent 11) and SUNet ID, a process that has
drawn mixed reactions from the thirteen
student groups — nine undergraduate,
three joint and one graduate — petition
ing for special fees this year.
While the new policy has proven sur
mountable for some, a number of both
large and small student groups consider
the new procedure a serious impediment
to their efforts to collect enough signatures.
"We're very frustrated at the mo
ment," said Samuel Wertheimer '07, fi
nancial officer for Volunteers in Latin
America, an undergraduate group that
sends 12 students to Latin America
each summer in an effort to combat
poverty. "We used to be able to go to
White Plaza with sign-up sheets, but it's
lots more difficult to take laptops and
convince people to sign up via the on
line system."

Wertheimer and other members of
Volunteers in Latin America brought
their laptops to Tresidder Union at
lunchtime yesterday to try to convince
students to sign their petition.
In an email to The Daily, Wertheimer
noted students' misperceptions about the
signing process. I le said that some incor
rectly believed signing the petition was tan
tamount to spending one's special fees
money,that they would receive spam it they
signed and that signing would preclude
them from signing other groups' petitions
The new signature process has affect
ed larger groups as well. Jeremy Barton,
the business manager for The Stanford
Daily, said that collecting enough signa
tures to appear on the spring ballot has
been harder this year than in the past.
Barton said he was "optimistic hut
concerned" about The Daily's ability to
obtain the approximately 500 signatures
it still needs to surpass its threshold by
Friday at noon.
"We're asking for the same amount,
to the dollar, as we did last year," said
Barton,"and last year, we passed with an
overwhelming majority."
Barton's perspective on the special
fees process as a whole was mixed.
"I definitely see where the ASSU is
coming from — a lot of people vote
without really knowing how much
groups are asking for and whether or not
it's a justified figure," he said. "I think the
ASSU tries to provide a checkpoint in
this process, but that checkpoint is a has
sle in many ways."
While many groups spoke negatively
about the new process,representatives
from other organizations cited some
positive aspects of the online system.
"I think it's been very helpful for
me personally," said Cammie Lee
'07. financial officer of Alternative
Spring Break.
Lee said the online procedure
allows her to verify whether or not
someone has signed the petition by
searching for his or her last name.
"It allows me to be more deliber
ate about the kinds of groups 1
should be talking to," she said,"since
1 can see what kinds of groups are
signing the petition and. based on
that, figure out which groups 1
should send emails to."
Other groups still struggling to
collect enough signatures by Friday
night included the undergraduate
group Stanford Students in Enter
tainment and the first graduate-only
special fees group, the Stanford
Comedy Club.

The Stanford Comedy Club
would use special fees money to
bring professional comedians to
campus, according to founder Avi
Tuschman, a graduate student in an
thropological science.
Douglas Blumeyer '07. financial
officer for Stanford Students in En
tertainment, explained that his
group would use the money to help
fund its annual spring break trip to
Hollywood, during which students
network with Stanford alumni to hunt
for jobs in the entertainment industry.
At press time. Queer/Straight
Alliance was the only group to have
gathered enough signatures to
make the spring ballot, according
to Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08. Stanford Film
Society, Stanford Mock Trial and
the Jewish Student Association are
on the cusp of the signature cutoff,
according to representatives from
the groups.
