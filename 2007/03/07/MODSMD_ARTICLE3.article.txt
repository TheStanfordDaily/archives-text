# Online petitions transform efforts
## Web-only special fees option changes strategy, tactics 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
By now, everyone on campus has likely
received multiple emails from various stu
dent groups petitioning to get on the
spring special fees ballot. Due to changes
made to the special fees signature process,
student groups requesting funding have
had to shelve their clipboards and paper
lists in favor of a flurry of mass emails.
The new electronic signature process
requires all groups to gather signatures
through an online petition. To "sign," a
student must enter a valid last name, stu
dent 11) and SUNet ID, a process that has
drawn mixed reactions from the thirteen
student groups — nine undergraduate,
three joint and one graduate — petition
ing for special fees this year.
While the new policy has proven sur
mountable for some, a number of both
large and small student groups consider
the new procedure a serious impediment
to their efforts to collect enough signatures.
"We're very frustrated at the mo
ment," said Samuel Wertheimer '07, fi
nancial officer for Volunteers in Latin
America, an undergraduate group that
sends 12 students to Latin America
each summer in an effort to combat
poverty. "We used to be able to go to
White Plaza with sign-up sheets, but it's
lots more difficult to take laptops and
convince people to sign up via the on
line system."

Wertheimer and other members of
Volunteers in Latin America brought
their laptops to Tresidder Union at
lunchtime yesterday to try to convince
students to sign their petition.
In an email to The Daily, Wertheimer
noted students' misperceptions about the
signing process. I le said that some incor
rectly believed signing the petition was tan
tamount to spending one's special fees
money,that they would receive spam it they
signed and that signing would preclude
them from signing other groups' petitions
The new signature process has affect
ed larger groups as well. Jeremy Barton,
the business manager for The Stanford
Daily, said that collecting enough signa
tures to appear on the spring ballot has
been harder this year than in the past.
Barton said he was "optimistic hut
concerned" about The Daily's ability to
obtain the approximately 500 signatures
it still needs to surpass its threshold by
Friday at noon.
"We're asking for the same amount,
to the dollar, as we did last year," said
Barton,"and last year, we passed with an
overwhelming majority."
Barton's perspective on the special
fees process as a whole was mixed.
"I definitely see where the ASSU is
coming from — a lot of people vote
without really knowing how much
groups are asking for and whether or not
it's a justified figure," he said. "I think the
ASSU tries to provide a checkpoint in
this process, but that checkpoint is a has
sle in many ways."
