## Teaching decisions Seniors weigh Teach for America, other offers 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
As seniors contemplate their
post-graduation plans, some will
consider participating in Teach for
America (TFA) — an increasingly
popular program, which offers col
lege graduates full-time, two-year
teaching positions in poor or rural
public schools, with the goal of pro
viding underprivileged students a
quality education.
While TFA s fourth and final ad
missions deadline passed on Feb.
18, students who applied by the

third deadline learned their place
ments last week and have until Mar.
I 1 ) to accept or decline the position.
Deepa Alagesan 07 has been
offered a position teaching science
in a New York City secondary
school. She has yet to decide if she
will accept the position and is also
considering jobs at non-profit or
ganizations and in the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
"I have always had an interest in
education and working with kids,
not necessarily in a formal school
setting,but through summer intern
ships and extracurricular activities
at Stanford,"she said.'Tm planning
to go to law school in a year or two
but want to do something meaning
ful. something that 1 would be pas
sionate about in my time off."
Bayley Jo Lopez '07 will be

teaching on a Navajo reservation in
New Mexico starting in August.
"1 want to he a teacher so 111 was
looking for an avenue that would
facilitate that," she said, adding that
she was drawn to the TFA because
it offered the opportunity to work
on a Native American reservation
— important to Lopez because of
her Native American heritage.

enth grade social studies and Eng
lish in Philadelphia. She also assists
with recruitment for the program,
telling potential applicants what her
experience is like.
"Teaching is not an easy job." she
said. "It's been like a roller coaster:
the challenges are constant."
Brown said that underprivileged
students often face a number of is
sues — including poor reading
skills, anger management difficulties
or unstable home environments —
all of which make teaching a greater
challenge.
TFA has seen a rise in popularity
and increasing numbers of applica
tions since its first year in 1990 —
last year, the program received more
than 19,000 applications, according
to the TFA Web site. Nonetheless,
some professors at the School of Ed
ucation have openly criticized the
program for producing poorly expe
rienced teachers.
"1 can definitely see that there
are problems with Teach for Ameri
ca," Lopez said. "I think it's prob
lematic that people get thrown in for
two years, especially considering
that they have demonstrated that
more experience makes you a better
teacher."
Alagesan also said she has some
reservations about the program.
"I think most people who do the
program are somewhat wary," she
said. "It seems like a good way for
students who might otherwise not
be exposed to teaching to get that
experience and to engage with a
community."
To fully appreciate the experi
ence, Brown said that prospective
TFA teachers should start out with a
clear vision of what they hope to
learn and get out of the program.
"Some people use it as a filler be
fore graduate school, but I don't
think that is a compelling enough
reason," she said."You have to be in
terested in the mission of the pro
gram: it is a demanding job and re
quires passion. You don't have to
stay in teaching long term but you
have to be mindful that it is a job that
requires your attention and dedica
tion."
