Members of the Undergraduate Senate raise their hands to vote on one of
several measures that they considered on Tuesday night.
to discuss possible revisions to the di
vestment resolution. The larger Stan
ford community will have the oppor
tunity to debate divestment and other
related topics at a spring quarter town
hall meeting on Middle Eastern issues.
A case against the Elections
Commission brought by last year's
vice presidential candidate Chris
Nguyen '07 over rules governing
campaigning prompted election re
form bills. Nguyen wanted to change
"certain parts of the constitution
that infringed on candidates' free
dom of speech," according to Sena
tor Danny Arbeiter '08, Administra
tion & Rules Committee co-Chair.
Last night's bills were designed to
fix these issues; they will appear on
the spi ing ballot if they are approved
by the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) tonight.
The bill recommending a constitu
tional ballot placement proposed var
ious "updates to accommodate the
21st century" and to "improve flexi
bility and convenience for the ASSU,"
Arbeiter said.This bill will also be on

the docket for tonight's GSC meeting.
ITie most significant proposed
change to the constitution was the
addition of a procedure for impeach
ing the group's executive. Under the
new rule, the ASSU president can be
impeached if four-fifths of the Sen
ate and GSC support such a move.
This change must be approved by
the GSC and a majority of students
in the April election.
The bill also proposed smaller
changes to reflect updated technolo
gy. If the bill passes. Senate members
will be able to post their agendas via
email, for example.
A second significant aspect of the
bill was the separation of joint special
fees. A group seeking joint special fees
must now obtain a minimum level of
support from both the graduate and
undergraduate student bodies.
"At most, this change would af
fect one group per year," Arbeiter
said. "If the new policy were to go
into effect, we believe groups would
adjust their programming to appeal
to both undergraduate and graduate
populations, which is in the best in
terests of grads. undergrads and the
groups themselves."
