## 'Free' laundry shapes habits Three-year-old policy provokes more student use, not overuse 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Entering the Wilbur laundry room
for the first time is one of the more
surreal moments of the Stanford ex
perience. Equipped with 21 washers
and 22 dryers, the room is an awe-in
spiring, wall-to-wall demonstration

of laundering prowess. And it's all
free.
Well, sort of. In Sept. 2(H)4, Stan
ford inaugurated the "Just Like
I lome" program, adopted from a sim
ilar effort at Princeton University.
Students are charged up-front for
laundry through a flat annual rate
tacked on to room-and-board bills,
letting them enjoy laundry privileges
free of coins and cards. In launching
the new laundry program, the Univer
sity replaced all washers and dryers
with low-flow, energy-efficient ma
chines. These consume 50 percent less
water than the old machines. accord

inn to Student 1 lousing Associate l)i
rector Imogen I linds.
"The goals of the program were to
increase student satisfaction with
laundry service, increase energy effi
ciency and water conservation, and
reduce maintenance. All three goals
have been achieved," Hinds wrote in
;in email to'lhe Daily. "All measures
indicate that the".lust Like Home"
laundry program has been very suc
cessful, and both students and Student
Housing staff have expressed strong
satisfaction with the program."
Praise for the change is not new. Since its in
ception. the program has been the subject of
three Daily articles emphasizing student satis
faction. Roughly three-fourths of the under
graduate population arrived on campus after
the switch, so for most, coin-free laundry is an
expected convenience rather than an excep
tional amenity.
Three freshmen, congregated in a West La
gunita mini-double on Sunday night for a col
laborative bout with a physics problem set. il
lustrated this point when posed with the hypo
thetical scenario ot coin-operated laundry ma
chines.
"Where would we get quarters from?" won
dered Asmita Kumar '10. "What il the [card
reading] machine broke down?"
"I would just never do my laundry." said
Yuhong Wang'lo.
"If we did have to pay," said Kumar."we'd
probably get everyone's laundry together."
"Yeah. Cram it all in. We're resourceful,"
agreed Jennifer Wang'lo. "We're Stanford stu
dents."
A veteran of the "old" era said the laundry
machines ol yore were not held in contempt.
Nor. he said, did they prompt communal laun
dering. During his freshman year. Ly C'hheng
'07 deposited quarters into laundry machines.
He survived to tell the tale.
"When the machines were coin-based, I'd
do laundry every other week." said C'hheng. as
he lugged a blue laundry basket downstairs to
the Adelfa-Eucalipto joint laundry room.
"Now I end up doing laundry more often, in
smaller loads. 1 probably do a load of laundry a
week. I pretty much just wash everything that's
dirty that week, instead of waiting for a full
load."
Did the new system change his attitude to-

ward laundry?
"I guess I feel
belter about doing ,
it."he said."'since I
don't have to
worry about coins
or the card readers
malfunctioning."
Back in the mini
double, the freshmen
were decidedly less am
bivalent about their laun
dry privileges.
"I came to Stanford for
the free laundry." said
Kumar. The other two
freshmen eyed her sus
piciously. "I'm serious!
When I went to FloMo
for Admit Weekend
and found out that
people were doing j

laundry for free. I
jumped for joy."
"II I h a d to
pay." Kumar con
fessed. ' I'd prohahlv
do fewer loads of laun
dry." She separates her laundry into three
piles that she washes every other week, feel
ing free to do so many loads because there is
no direct cost.
Kumar is an exceptionally high-frequency
launderer, exceeding the national average for
college students — five loads per month, ac
cording to WEB Laundry. And she does almost
double the laundry of the average Stanford stu
dent — about 3 or 4 loads per month, accord
ing to Hinds.
Hinds said that "usage of machines has in

creased" since
the program's
implementation
but was quick to
add that the program's net impact has been to
reduce costs and water consumption through
the switch to environmentally-friendly ma
chines. Hinds also attributed some of the
usage increase to additional machines in
stalled.
As a result of the new program. Stanford
Housing saves 3 million gallons of water annu
ally, according to Assistant Director of Student
1 lousing for Housing Planned and Sustainabil
ity Projects Alicia Restrepo.
Hinds said previous washing patterns —
students washing their laundry less frequently
but in larger loads — had adverse effects.

"Less overloading reduces water consump
tion and drying time per load, reduces the risk
of water spillage,and reduces machine mainte
nance and downtime." she said.
Among the more creative uses for Stan
ford's laundry system is as a method to bridge
the Stanford-Cal divide.
"My friend's boyfriend from Cal does his
laundry here." Kumar volunteered. ''They
don't have free laundry there."
And. unsurprisingly, the old campus hy
giene-bv-necessity mentality remains preva
lent.
"Even though it's free. I still do my laundry
when I run out of clothes." said Wang. "I'm a
college student."
