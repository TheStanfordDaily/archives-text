## 'Free' laundry shapes habits Three-year-old policy provokes more student use, not overuse 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Entering the Wilbur laundry room
for the first time is one of the more
surreal moments of the Stanford ex
perience. Equipped with 21 washers
and 22 dryers, the room is an awe-in
spiring, wall-to-wall demonstration

of laundering prowess. And it's all
free.
Well, sort of. In Sept. 2(H)4, Stan
ford inaugurated the "Just Like
I lome" program, adopted from a sim
ilar effort at Princeton University.
Students are charged up-front for
laundry through a flat annual rate
tacked on to room-and-board bills,
letting them enjoy laundry privileges
free of coins and cards. In launching
the new laundry program, the Univer
sity replaced all washers and dryers
with low-flow, energy-efficient ma
chines. These consume 50 percent less
water than the old machines. accord

"The goals of the program were to
increase student satisfaction with
laundry service, increase energy effi
ciency and water conservation, and
reduce maintenance. All three goals
have been achieved," Hinds wrote in
;in email to'lhe Daily. "All measures
indicate that the".lust Like Home"
laundry program has been very suc
cessful, and both students and Student
Housing staff have expressed strong
satisfaction with the program."
