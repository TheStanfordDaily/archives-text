## High-tech equipment stolen Amid construction, bandits take physics tools 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tens of thousands of dollars worth
of specialized electronics equipment
lias been stolen from three physics
buildings located in the Hewlett and
Packard Quadrangle. Workers at the
Astrophysics Building, Varian Physics
Lab and the Hansen Experimental
Physics Lab (lILPL) began to notice
that items were missing at the start of
the quarter.
Over winter break, three oscillo
scopes. valued between $3,500 and
$7.(HK). two $4(M) to $S(X) voltmeters
and a $39,000 spectrum analyzer were
stolen from lILPL.but the crime was
not reported until Feb. 8, according to
the Stanford Department of Public
Safety's crime log. Various objects, in
eluding a hand-flute meter and
walkie-talkie radios were also stolen
from the Astrophysics building, and a

spectrum analyzer was reported miss
ing on Feb. 13 by a worker at Varian,
who said the theft may have occurred
as early as Jan. 10.
In what may be a related case, an
iPod. an external hard-drive and sev
eral CDs containing research data
were reported stolen from the nearby
Gilbert Biological Sciences building
on Jan. 23.
The items stolen from 111 - PI were
taken from end stations, formerly part
of a linear accelerator that was
housed in the lab.The end stations are
four stories underground, surrounded
by eight-foot thick walls and ceilings,
in a building that is locked 24 hours a
day.
"We have some construction
going on in end stations two and
three" said Michael Killian. facilities
manager for HEPL. "And all these
buildings are connected by a tunnel
four stories underground. If someone
got in while there was construction,
they would have access to the entire
tunnel. With the construction, doors
are open, contractors are in and out.
It's an opportune time for someone

hold to hike something."
Citing an ongoing investigation,
the Department of Public Safety has
declined to comment on the spate of
thefts. A police spokesman declined
to comment on whether the thefts are
connected or whether authorities
have any leads.
Students have noticed an in
crcased police presence in the area,
hut police also could confirm rumors
that an officer has heen posted to
guard the Varian facility overnight.
Many of the stolen items have a
broad range of applications.
"Anybody who does any type of
electronic work in their garage and
their kitchen table can use one of
these," Killian said of the oscillo
scopes. "It's a very versatile piece of
equipment."
Doreen Ross, facilities coordina
tor for the Astrophysics building, said
the items stolen from that facility
were used "for testing electronic cir
cuitry."
