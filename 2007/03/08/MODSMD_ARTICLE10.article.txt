### SARA LANNIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's lacrosse
fell to Connecticut on Sunday in
an offense-filled 16-10 game. De
spite three goals apiece Irom
freshman midfielder Lauren
Schmidt and junior attacker
Daphne Patterson, the C ardinal
could not keep up with the
Huskies' Shannon Burke, whose
deadly scoring streak in the sec
ond half helped her team clinch
the win.
The beginning of the game
looked promising for Stanford as
junior midfielder/attacker
Megan McClain scored the first
goal only four minutes into the
half.
The undaunted Huskies only
used this as a source of motiva
tion, however, and 30 seconds
later the score was tied at 1-1.
The Cardinal (1-4) and the
Huskies (2-1) traded goals back
and forth for the remainder of
the half, with key goals coming
from Patterson and sophomore
midfielder Maris Perlman.
As both teams took a break
for halftime.the Cardinal was be
hind but not beaten, with the
Huskies leading 8-5.
Stanford again initiated the
scoring in the second half as Pat
terson notched her third and
final goal of the game. UConn re
sponded when Burke, one of the
Huskies' best players, helped
give her team a commanding
lead by initiating a four-goal
scoring streak that extended the
lead to 12-6.
Stanford freshman midfielder
Julie Christy retaliated with two
quick goals, but the real blow fell
when Burke scored three goals
within five minutes, bringing her
total points for the day to 10, with
six goals and four assists. A last
goal by Schmidt, who had al
ready notched two goals earlier
in the game, was not enough to
save her team.
The Cardinal has two chances

to improve its record this week
end as the team plays host to
James Madison and Colgate.
Schmidt, who currently leads the
Cardinal in points, said the visits
by top East Coast teams are in
dicative of Stanford's develop
ment as a lacrosse program.
"1 think its great that compet
itive teams come from the East
Coast to play us, and that it real
ly says something about the pro
gram the coaches have put to
gether over the past couple
years," Schmidt said. "Without a
competitive schedule, we would
n't have the chance to make any
kind of a difference."
And despite the Cardinal's
current 1-4 record, much to the
fault of those strong East Coast
teams, Schmidt remains opti
mistic.
"Our team has been building
and learning pretty valuable les
sons [even though] they have
come as losses." she said.
Next for the Cardinal is No. 9
James Madison,which, like Stan
ford. is looking to make up for an
earlier overtime loss against
Notre Dame. The Dukes have
