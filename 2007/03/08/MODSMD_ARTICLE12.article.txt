Call her old-fashioned, but Judith Pond "OS
much prefers phone conversations to wall
posts.
"I just didn't feel a reason to get [a Face
book profile]," explained Pond. "Nothing ever
compelled me."
Pond's story might be hard to believe. For 18
million Facebook users, wall-posting, photo
tagging and shamelessly poking mild acquain
tances has become not only standard, but wild
ly entertaining. First launched in February
2004. the Palo Alto-based social networking
Website isself-reportedly"the sixth-most traf
ficked site in the United States and the number
one photo-sharing site." According to a Face
book press release, half of its users "come back
daily and, according to com Score, spend an av
erage of lb minutes per day sharing and gath
ering information."
A number of students on Stanford's cam
pus, however, would happily spend those pre
cious 16 minutes elsewhere.
For Pond, the rare decision to resist the
Facebook phenomenon is not a crusade against
the site and its users, but a reflection of her be
lief that website profiles are not a necessary
part of life.

"When people find out that I'm not on it.
they think it implies some sort of judgment
about it — and it doesn't necessarily," assured
Pond. Quite simply,"it's just something I've de
cided not to participate in. I've never run into a
problem where I wanted to contact someone
but wasn't able to."
A Facebook-less senior who wished to re
main anonymous likewise questioned the ne
cessity of an online social network, as she has
her hands full already with her phone and
email.
In addition.she said."we are people; we are
more than profiles.The exercise of putting one
self into a profile is awful, and I've written
enough applications to know that."
The biggest turnoff for Pond is that "people
seem to use it as a gauge of social status. "While
she admitted that "there is nothing wrong with
having acquaintances," in her eyes, the idea o!
accumulating hundreds of Facebook friends
"kind of devalues the term 'friend.'"
"I definitely see how it could grow into
something more than looking at people's pho
tos and seeing what they did last Friday." Pond
continued. "People use Facebook to find out
information about people they actually don't
know at all."
Joining both students in a world devoid of

Facebook is Douglas Stanford '09, who once
kept an active profile, but recently decided to
stop using the site.
"As much as I would like to be perceived as
some kind of heroic Facebook resister, I am re
ally not,"claimed Stanford."! am not moral!)
opposed to Facebook. I just got bored of re
ceiving messages saying people had written on
my wall. And I didn't like having to log in to
check for messages."
As a secondary explanation for his "leave of
absence" from Facebook, Stanford's decision
was simply a matter of efficiency. I le referred
to a hierarchy of communication forms.
"There are varying levels of realism and ef
ficiency in different forms of communication.
The best, of course, is talking face to face. Next
is the telephone, then letters, then email, and at
the bottom is the Facebook message or wall
post. I just didn't like having to interact with
people in such an inefficient, inauthentic way."
A year ago, Theresa /.hen '09 might have
agreed with Stanford's philosophy, citing the
existence of healthier, more efficient ways to
spend one's time.
"I decided to hold back on Facebook be
cause it seemed to negatively impact college
students' lives without their being fully con
scious of the many hours and emotional invest

ment put into it. Put simply, it seemed to be a
costly distraction."
Given time, though, /hen soon found her
self unable to resist the site that had quickly
gained popularity among her peers.
As /.hen recalled, much of the decision to
conform came from "pressure — pressure to
keep in touch with friends from back home,
pressure to remember the names of all of the
people you were meeting and pressure to keep
up with the Facebook-crazy culture here. It's so
easy — and so fun — to fall into the trap!"
Just a year after her turnaround, /hen ad
mitted. "I'm on it so much that 1 can't imagine
a life without it!"
Some Stanford students hope to actually
live out that vision — or at least see what it's
like for 40 days. The Christian custom of sacri
ficing something for Lent, the holy period last
ing from Ash Wednesday to Faster Sunday, has
proven itself applicable to the Facebook-free
aspirations of Christians and non-Christians
alike.
"Last year, me and my buddy Jai Krishnan
gave up Russell Peters because we quoted him
too much." said Vijay Rajasekhar '08. "This
year, we decided to give up another thing we
spent too much lime on."
Will he and Krishnan be cured
from Face book, once and loi all'
Apart from generating perhaps a bit
more self-control, both expect the
sacrifice to have only temporary re
suits.
"After my final logout, within 10
minutes, 1 gol a whole bunch of wall
posts, a friend request and two group
invites," recalled Rajasekhar. "I m
going to have so much fun once all
this is over."
Admitted Krishnan. with a laugh,
"I'll just waste my time with other
things, like You' Tube
'ITie tendency to revert back to
old Facebook ways is not at all un
common among others who. like Ra
jasekhar and Krishnan. consciously
attempt to stay off the site for a peri
od of time. For many students, it is
just too difficult to ignore the

method of communication tiiat
unites such a large number of their
old and new friends.
Artur Szczepanek '1)9 shut down
his Facebook account lasi year "due
to an epiphany that it was pointless
and superficial." Over the next few
months, though."l fell myself grow
ing distant from a few older friends,
and actually forgot someone's birth
day because I didn't have Facebook
during the time. I paid dearly for that
mistake."
It wasn't long before Szczepanek
"decided to re-register after [realiz
ing) everyone was using it."
"Hveryone," however, doesn't in
clude the few students like Pond,
who simply do not perceive a need
for down-to-the-second status up
dates on their friends' lives.
Despite a growing world of
tagged photos. Newsleed reels and
friend requests. Pond still said she
feels she isn't missing out on any
thing! at all.

Call her old-fashioned, but Judith Pond "OS
much prefers phone conversations to wall
posts.
"I just didn't feel a reason to get [a Face
book profile]," explained Pond. "Nothing ever
compelled me."
Pond's story might be hard to believe. For 18
million Facebook users, wall-posting, photo
tagging and shamelessly poking mild acquain
tances has become not only standard, but wild
ly entertaining. First launched in February
2004. the Palo Alto-based social networking
Website isself-reportedly"the sixth-most traf
ficked site in the United States and the number
one photo-sharing site." According to a Face
book press release, half of its users "come back
daily and, according to com Score, spend an av
erage of lb minutes per day sharing and gath
ering information."
A number of students on Stanford's cam
pus, however, would happily spend those pre
cious 16 minutes elsewhere.
For Pond, the rare decision to resist the
Facebook phenomenon is not a crusade against
the site and its users, but a reflection of her be
lief that website profiles are not a necessary
part of life.

"When people find out that I'm not on it.
they think it implies some sort of judgment
about it — and it doesn't necessarily," assured
Pond. Quite simply,"it's just something I've de
cided not to participate in. I've never run into a
problem where I wanted to contact someone
but wasn't able to."
A Facebook-less senior who wished to re
main anonymous likewise questioned the ne
cessity of an online social network, as she has
her hands full already with her phone and
email.
In addition.she said."we are people; we are
more than profiles.The exercise of putting one
self into a profile is awful, and I've written
enough applications to know that."
The biggest turnoff for Pond is that "people
seem to use it as a gauge of social status. "While
she admitted that "there is nothing wrong with
having acquaintances," in her eyes, the idea o!
accumulating hundreds of Facebook friends
"kind of devalues the term 'friend.'"
"I definitely see how it could grow into
something more than looking at people's pho
tos and seeing what they did last Friday." Pond
continued. "People use Facebook to find out
information about people they actually don't
know at all."
Joining both students in a world devoid of

Facebook is Douglas Stanford '09, who once
kept an active profile, but recently decided to
stop using the site.
"As much as I would like to be perceived as
some kind of heroic Facebook resister, I am re
ally not,"claimed Stanford."! am not moral!)
opposed to Facebook. I just got bored of re
ceiving messages saying people had written on
my wall. And I didn't like having to log in to
check for messages."
As a secondary explanation for his "leave of
absence" from Facebook, Stanford's decision
was simply a matter of efficiency. I le referred
to a hierarchy of communication forms.
"There are varying levels of realism and ef
ficiency in different forms of communication.
The best, of course, is talking face to face. Next
is the telephone, then letters, then email, and at
the bottom is the Facebook message or wall
post. I just didn't like having to interact with
people in such an inefficient, inauthentic way."
A year ago, Theresa /.hen '09 might have
agreed with Stanford's philosophy, citing the
existence of healthier, more efficient ways to
spend one's time.
"I decided to hold back on Facebook be
cause it seemed to negatively impact college
students' lives without their being fully con
scious of the many hours and emotional invest

ment put into it. Put simply, it seemed to be a
costly distraction."
Given time, though, /hen soon found her
self unable to resist the site that had quickly
gained popularity among her peers.
As /.hen recalled, much of the decision to
conform came from "pressure — pressure to
keep in touch with friends from back home,
pressure to remember the names of all of the
people you were meeting and pressure to keep
up with the Facebook-crazy culture here. It's so
easy — and so fun — to fall into the trap!"
Just a year after her turnaround, /hen ad
mitted. "I'm on it so much that 1 can't imagine
a life without it!"
Some Stanford students hope to actually
live out that vision — or at least see what it's
like for 40 days. The Christian custom of sacri
ficing something for Lent, the holy period last
ing from Ash Wednesday to Faster Sunday, has
proven itself applicable to the Facebook-free
aspirations of Christians and non-Christians
alike.
