## March 8,1935: Roughs read light fiction 
### 
"The deep-browed Stanford male
who talks in academic conundrums
hasn't nearly the literary taste of his
'flightier' female contemporary, ac
cording to James R. Broughton. who
dishes out literary relaxation to stu
dents from his circulating library in
the Union Cellar.
"Men go almost exclusively for
light fiction, murder mysteries most
ly. while women read William
Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway
when they want to take their minds
off examinations and classes.
"'They read heavier stuff to im
prove their table talk,' Broughton
believes. 'For some reason, they
think that the more intellectual they
are the better hit they make. If male
book selections are any indication.
Stanford men are anything but
brainy.'
"As for reading speed, Stanford
students have it all over their profes
sors. Broughton revealed. The aver
age rough or coed finishes a book in
about half the time it takes his in
structor."
