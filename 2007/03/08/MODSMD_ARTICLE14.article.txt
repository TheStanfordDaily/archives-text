Spiders are kinky creatures. Ger
man scientists recently discov
ered that when spiders copulate,
the male often leaves a bit of his
equipment behind. The male spider
starts the foreplay by shaking the fe
male's web. but then he only has a
few seconds to mate before the
much-larger female devours him. In
his haste to get it on and still get
away, the male often leaves the tip of
his sex organ lodged inside the fe
male's reproductive tract. His sev
ered member acts as a sort of chasti
ty belt that keeps other male's sperm
from making it inside his mate.
Makes foot fetishism look tame,
doesn't it?
Screwing in the animal kingdom
is extremely diverse and extremely
weird. In her book "Dr.Tatiana's Sex
Advice to All Creation." Olivia Jud
son'9l points out that spiders are not
the only animals to plug up'their
mates. The honeybee male also
leaves his genitals behind, but he rips
them off so violently that he dies
from his wounds.The honeybee is the
exception, though, as most animals
opt for gluing their lover shut, rather
than sacrificing their manhood. For
example, a house mouse leaves a
sperm plug so tough that removing it
means tearing the female's womb.
Another animal that tries to seal his
mate shut is the fox squirrel. But the
female squirrel is undeterred — she
just yanks out her lover's sperm plug

and makes a snack of it.
Eating your man's sperm plug is
far from the weirdest thing out there.
The leopard slug, for instance, has sex
while dangling in mid-air, tethered to
a tree by a mucus rope. The slugs
spend up to an hour nestled together
on a tree branch, oozing mucus all
over each other. I folding each other
tightly, they then take the plunge off
the tree. Next, the hermaphroditic an
imals unfurl their phalluses from the
sides of their heads, and wrap them
together to exchange sperm. (Search
"slug sex" on You Tube for a truly
amazing video.) For a cousin of the
leopard slug, this phallus is almost
three feet long — imagine that dan
gling in your front yard!
Animals can also be downright
slutty. Chastity belts like the spiders'
belie the myth of female fidelity. II
females were chaste, males wouldn't
need to go through the trouble of ce
menting shut their lover's reproduc
tive tracts!
I lusband and wife biologists David
Barash and Judith Lipton co-authored
a book called "The Mvth of

Monogamy." In surveying the animal
kingdom, the only animal they found
that was completely monogamous
was a bizarre flatworm that parasitizes
fish intestines. Males and females of
the species meet when they are young,
and their bodies actually fuse into
marital Siamese twins. So "in sickness
and health" is not really a choice.
Judson points to another animal
as a paragon of family values. Again,
virtue doesn't really play into the
equation. One type of mantis shrimp
lurks in sandy burrows and waits for
fish to swim by. Husband and wife
meet as adolescents and build ;i home
together out of mucus and sand. Soft,
squishy bodies make the shrimp ex
tremely vulnerable should they leave
the love nest. And. since they lose the
ability to make the burrow-stabiliz
ing mucus in adulthood, making a
new home is out of the question.
I lence. permanent domestic bliss.
There are a few more document
ed cases of animal monogamy. Rut
Judson isn't confident these animals'

virtuousness will stand up in court.
After all. at one point, almost all bird
species were considered to be
monogamous. Mating pairs nest to
gether. preen each other and cooper
ate to raise their brood. An idyllic vi
sion, until paternity tests showed that
many parents were raising bastard
chicks. Infidelity was rife.
Just as many animals do not find
themselves held to one sexual part
ner. many also do not limit them
selves to the opposite sex. I lomosex
uality has been documented in over
300 species of vertebrates. The most
famous LGBT animal isthebonobo,
close cousin to the chimpanzee.
Dubbed the "make love, not war"
primate, bonobos take any excuse to
have sex, in any and all combinations.
Males hang from tree limbs and rub
genitalia in an activity called penis
fencing. Females hug tightly and
massage their genital swellings to
gether. The apes even French kiss!

Hut bonobos aren't the only ones
having queer sex. Penguins form
same-sex relationships, and gay cou
ples will even raise an egg together.
Male bottlenose dolphins insert
their penises into one another's gen
ital slits, nasal apertures, or anuses.
Female red squirrels are sometimes
lesbian co-parents. Iliey take turns
mounting each other, and both fe

males nurse their young.
People who decry homosexuality
(or almost any other sexual behav
ior). sniffing that it's "unnatural."
should maybe think again. Nature it
self seems hell-bent on making near
ly everything natural. If we must look
to bioiogy for models of sexual be
havior. bisexual polyamorists can
point to the bonobo, while my old
youth pastor can take inspiration
from the mantis shrimp. I just hope
no one looks to the spider.
