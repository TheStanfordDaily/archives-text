## Zimbardo delivers farewell lecture on evil Lauded psych prof, explains "The Lucifer Effect" 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
There was not a single empty seat
in the psychology lecture hall yester
day morning as Philip Zimbardo,
professor emeritus of psychology,
delivered his final Psychology 1 lec
ture. "The Lucifer Effect" — an
event that marked the end of his 50-
year teaching career.
Yesterday's lecture by the "God
father" of Psychology I—an allu
sion to Zimbardo's Bronx upbring
ing — focused on the psychology of
evil.
Internationally recognized for
his 1971 Stanford Prison Experi
ment. Zimbardo recently served as
the president of the American Psy
chological Association and is the
author of the best-selling introduc
tory psychology textbook. "Psy
chology and Life," now in its 18th
edition. I le is also the director of the
new Center for Interdisciplinary
Policy Education and Research on
Terrorism.
But it is the renowned professor's
teaching that has earned him the re
spect of students and faculty alike
throughout his long tenure.
"There has never been a braver
lecturer than Phil," said Psychology
Prof. Lee Ross, who came to Stan
ford on Zimbardo's recommenda
tion. "He goes the extra mile that a
lot of us would be embarrassed to
go"
Zimbardo, who has been at the
University since 1%8. has made a
habit of inviting controversial guest
lecturers to his classes, including
Malcolm X, ex-convicts and porn

stars.
According to Ross, Zimbardo —
despite his eccentricities — has al
ways taken his profession very seri
ously.
"He is always willing to connect
his own story to the story of psychol
ogy." Ross said.
Zimbardo has described his lega
cy at the University as three-fold,
seeing himself first as an educator,
"making the teaching of psychology
fascinating and engrossing," second
as a model for how to spearhead se
rious scientific research on social is
sues like torture and third as a writer
for the general public.
In yesterday's lecture. Zimbardo
embodied all three roles, exploring
what he calls the "Lucifer Effect,"
the title of his new book anc'< a theo
ry of how good people turn evil. The
volume is Zimbardo's most compre
hensive account of the controversial
Stanford Prison Experiment, and it
applies the famous experiment's
findings to present-day United
States military crimes in the prisons
of Abu (ihraib and Guantanamo
Bay.
"The book is a day-by-day ac
count of the infamous six days of the
prison experiment," said Kieran O'-
Connor, a psychology coterminal
student who helped Zimbardo edit
his work. "But it reads like an inves
tigative report ofAbu Ghraib."
Zimbardo coined the term the
"Lucifer Effect" "because it is really
an analysis of transformation." he
said. "Lucifer is the arch of the most
unimaginable transformation from
good to evil."
lie said that "dehumanization"

and "anonymity" are responsible for
the transformation from good to
evil. These impulses compel individ
uals to drastically change themselves
and act against their own norms and
values, Zimbardo said. Additional
situational pressures by which the
"good" are corrupted by a "bad bar
rel" also contribute to situations like
the Abu Ghraib abuses, according to
Zimbardo.
"Good American soldiers were
corrupted by the bad barrel in which
they too were imprisoned," he said.
Zimbardo testified on behalf of
Sgt. Ivan "Chip" Frederick, one of
the soldiers charged in the Abu
Ghraib scandal, arguing that "it was
the situation that corrupted [Freder
ick]."
Now that his undergraduate
teaching duties are over, Zimbardo
plans to shift his research to a lighter
subject.
"I'm never going to study evil
again," he said."l want to refocus on
understanding heroes."
"How can we understand what
makes ordinary people do good
and become a hero?" he asked.
"Literature gives us the false mes
sage that heroes are extraordinary
people [...] but most people do
good just once."
The professor wants to develop a
school curriculum that supports the
ordinary hero model, which will
teach each student "to think of him
self as a hero in the wings," and will
encourage students to act coura
geously when the situation arises.
