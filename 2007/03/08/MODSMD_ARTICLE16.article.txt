## Study bloats egos of students "Generation Me," most narcissistic on record 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
In Greek mythology. Narcissus
was a young man who fell in love
with the reflection of his own image
and. as the story goes, spent so long
looking at himself that he starved to
death. New research indicates that
our generation is following in Nar
cissus' very footsteps.
Jean Twenge. associate professor
of psychology at San Diego State
University, along with researchers
from the University of Georgia, the
University of Michigan and the Uni
versity of South Alabama, examined
the results of 1.3 million personality
surveys taken by college students
over the last 25 years and came to the
conclusion that the current genera
tion is the most self-centered in his
tory.
Narcissism — which
Dictionary.com defines as "inordi
nate fascination with oneself — has
a long history, and Sigmund Freud
believed that a reasonable amount
of vnnity is an essential part of matu
ration. But now. according to
Twenge, we may be experiencing a
generational epidemic.
In her book "Generation Me:
Why Today's Young Americans are
More Confident, Assertive. Entitled
- and More Miserable Than Rver
Before." Twenge examines genera
tional differences in self-esteem, in
dividualism. anxiety and sexuality.
She started writing the book as an
undergraduate at the University of
Chicago when she realized that
many of her friends had registered
scores on personality tests that were
different than those predicted by
1970s test manuals.
According to Twenge. "Genera
tion Me" (anyone born between
1970 and 1999) has grown up believ
ing that the individual should come
first. Ibis is in direct contrast to the
post-World War II "Baby Boomer"
