## Study bloats egos of students "Generation Me," most narcissistic on record 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
In Greek mythology. Narcissus
was a young man who fell in love
with the reflection of his own image
and. as the story goes, spent so long
looking at himself that he starved to
death. New research indicates that
our generation is following in Nar
cissus' very footsteps.
Jean Twenge. associate professor
of psychology at San Diego State
University, along with researchers
from the University of Georgia, the
University of Michigan and the Uni
versity of South Alabama, examined
the results of 1.3 million personality
surveys taken by college students
over the last 25 years and came to the
conclusion that the current genera
tion is the most self-centered in his
tory.
Narcissism — which
Dictionary.com defines as "inordi
nate fascination with oneself — has
a long history, and Sigmund Freud
believed that a reasonable amount
of vnnity is an essential part of matu
ration. But now. according to
Twenge, we may be experiencing a
generational epidemic.
In her book "Generation Me:
Why Today's Young Americans are
More Confident, Assertive. Entitled
- and More Miserable Than Rver
Before." Twenge examines genera
tional differences in self-esteem, in
dividualism. anxiety and sexuality.
She started writing the book as an
undergraduate at the University of
Chicago when she realized that
many of her friends had registered
scores on personality tests that were
different than those predicted by
1970s test manuals.
According to Twenge. "Genera
tion Me" (anyone born between
1970 and 1999) has grown up believ
ing that the individual should come
first. Ibis is in direct contrast to the
post-World War II "Baby Boomer"
generation lhat was much more
group-centric.
The trend towards narcissism is
both a positive and a negative one,
according to Twenge, who said this
generation is more accepting of per
sonal freedoms, more tolerant and
more opportunistic. Iliis new. self
centered mentality leads to higher
self-esteem but also can result in
higher levels of anxiety, cynicism and
loneliness.Twenge said.
"Generation Me" is characterized
by high expectations. I'wenge said,
and these feelings can sometimes
lead to harmful conflicts between ex
pectations and reality. Members of
this conflicted generation are often
disappointed by adulthood, she h;is
observed.
"Now expectations are so much
higher while reality is so much
tougher as far as economics andcom
petition,"Twenge said."Narcissism is
also correlated with savoring short
term relationships, which might ex
plain the rise of'hook lips' on college
campuses as opposed to boyfriend
girlfriend relationships."'
Twenge said the rise of narcissism
is responsible for an increasing de
sire for fame, a trend that explains
the recent societal infatuation with
fads like "American Idol." reality I V
and You Tube.
"W illi this generation.self-esteem
is higher, narcissism is higher, people
are more likely to go against social
rules, sexual morality is a lot looser
than it used to be. all because people
are doing what is right for 'me,'" she

said.
ITie study lias prompted psycholo
gists to urge caution before drawing
broad conclusions, however. Stanford
professor of psychology Bcnoit
Monin was somewhat ambivalent re
garding Twenge's findings.
"One shouldn't make too much
about the actual numbers given by
the scale in the sense that they tell
you of an absolute level of narcis
sism" he said in an email to Hie
Daily. "The change is extremely in
teresting, should be reported and
should prompt further research into
its causes and consequences but
[...] the change is relative, and it is
slightly misleading to reflect it as a
qualitative change from 'not narcis
sistic' to'narcissistic.'"
According to Monin, the fact that
the study centers on the narcissism ol
students fits with common attitudes
towards younger generations.
"It fits with (older) readers'
stereotypes and prejudice about
young people being arrogant and
self-absorbed," Monin said. "Saying
this was observed in students doesn't
mean it would not have been ob
served in other groups as well [had
they been surveyed]. This is the com
mon oversight of lacking a control
group. | | Because the study sur
veyed students, the media thinks that
it proves what we knew all along
about students."
"Anytime a finding makes the
headlines you have to wonder why
people are picking it up. and 1 think
in this case it's because older readers
can feel confirmed in their suspicion
that students feel too entitled and ar
rogant," he added.
