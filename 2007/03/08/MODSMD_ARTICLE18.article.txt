# STUDEN LIFE
## Mental health panel takes on taboo Student relates her personal struggles 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Until very recently, talking about
depression and suicide at Stanford
was taboo, a panel of staff and stu
dents who are members of the mental
health community said last night at an
open discussion in the Eucalipto
Lounge. The lack of dialogue made
Stanford a difficult place to live for
those suffering from mental health
disorders, the panelists said.
Mental illness became ;in open
topic of discussion on campus follow
ing the death of graduate student
Mengyao "May" Zhou earlier this
quarter. Although her death is still
under investigation, initial reports in
dicated that Zhou may have taken her
own life.
"I'm a little hit pissed off that it
took [the recent death] to get us to
talk about it." Cady Mine '09 told the
audience. Mine is one of the leaders of
Stanford Peace of Mind, a student
group that seeks to expand awareness
about mental health issues at Stan
ford. Mine was recently diagnosed
with bipolar disorder and spent part of
last year at Stanford I lospital after she
and psychiatrists at Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) at
Vaden decided she was suicidal.
Mine's mother committed suicide
last summer, and when the sopho
more returned to the University in
September, she said she felt isolated
and that there was a lot of pressure to
seem superficially happy.
"People don't know how to react
and their response is to run away," she
told the audience. "You say. I'm de
pressed' and people will say, 'Your
classes are hard?' But. no, that's not
it."
Rona Hu, director of the Acute In
patient Unit at Stanford I lospital.said
that mental health conditions are
under-acknowledged among the Uni
versity population. She cited suicide
and depression, but also said that eat
ing disorders and substance abuse
problems are key issues for university
students.
"One thing I think a lot of students
don't know is that at any uiven time.

one, two or three out of the 16 beds we
have are Stanford students," she said.
Additional panelists included Ale
jandro Martinez, director of CAPS:
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann, act
ing Dean for Religious Life; Alejan
dro de los Angeles "07 of Stanford
Peace of Mind; and Kyle Evaldez W.
a live-in counselor at the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center.
Martinez and Karlin-Neumann
said that the overriding factor affect
ing mental health at the University is
the "Stanford duck syndrome," a
metaphor for a student who is calm on
the surface but frantically paddling
underneath just to stay afloat.
"What is clear is that the most re
peated description of the Stanford
student is the classic duck-swan." Kar
lin-Neumann said, in reference to the
duck metaphor. Both Karlin-Neu
mann and Martinez said their primary
concern is that many students at the
University feel isolated and believe
they cannot speak openly with their
peers.
Iline said she thought the duck
metaphor was accurate but incom
plete. She said that even after opening
up to friends about her mental health
issues and her mother's death, she felt
alone.
"1 struggled a lot with feeling iso
lated.' she said."There was this notion
that il this girl comes from such a
background there must be something
wrong with her."
"My roommate [...] didn't know
how to deal with it," she added.
The event was hosted by Flo Chan
07. a Peer I lealth Educator (PI IE) in
Adelfa. Approximately 20 people at
tended.
"I have found myself caring about
this a lot ever since they raised aware
ness about this." said Andy Trotter '08.
Perfectionism and anxiety disorders
do not mix. They need to convince
people to talk to your R A."
leresa Dicolcn '08. attended be
cause she is the PHE in Florence
Moore East.
I came out of curiosity and as a side
program." she said. "It was nice to
hear an open dialogue about some
thing that was hidden and that should
n t be hidden."
