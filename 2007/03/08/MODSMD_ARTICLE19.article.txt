## GSC debates cost of GO-Pass program CSC decides to vote next week on initiative, implementation 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With several of next year's candidates in atten
dance, the Graduate Student Council (GSC) held
a crash course on the GO-Pass program last night,
unveiling the special fees ballot it plans to put in
front of graduate students in order to continue
funding the subsidized GO-Pass program.
Hie ballot proposal from the Graduate Student
Transportation Board (GSTB) sets out a compli
cated structure to permanently finance the
$500,000 program, which offers off-campus gradu
ate students a heavily subsidized rate for the un
limited-ride CalTrain pass.
According to the proposal, most of the funds
for the program will be generated from a $ 17 quar
terly special fee charged to each off-campus grad
uate student and from donations by the Provost
and other external sources.
Because not all off-campus students who
would be paying the special fee would want a GO-

Pass, however, the GSTB proposal also offers
other types of compensation.
"The problem is that the GO-Pass program is
really expensive," said GSTB member Martin
Mueller."To get more people interested in passing
the ballot, we are including benefits for students
who commute to campus but are not eligible for
the GO-Pass."
Under the current proposal, benefits for stu
dents who pay to subsidize the program but do not
buy a pass include vouchers for the Super Shuttle
airport service or discounted bike tune-ups at the
Campus Bike Shop.
GSC members also discussed the possibility of
having a large number of students request a spe
cial fees refund. While the funding structure pro
posed by the ballot could theoretically accommo
date a refund rate of up to 30 percent, it was un
clear whether the program would be able to con
tinue if too many students ask for a refund.
"What happens if there's a 40 percent refund
rate and we budget for 30?" asked Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises CEO Matt McDonald '05.
McDonald added that the ASSU Constitution
allows for a maximum 25 percent refund rate for
any program funded by special fees, after which
the group's future is up in the air.

Much of the debate hinged on estimates the
GSTB had made for the number of students ex
pected to buy passes.
"These are the numbers we can reasonably ex
pect." Mueller said. "But the numbers are fairly
uncertain."
While the special fee and the GO-Pass program
would only affect those living off-campus, all grad
uate students will vote on the issue because some
students living on-campus could move off-campus
and become eligible for the program.
"I"he GSC decided to postpone a vote on the
proposal until next Wednesday, which is the
deadline for adding ballot items for the spring
election. In last year's election, a hastily prepared
ballot measure that also tried to establish a per
manent special fee structure for the GO-Pass
program failed to get enough votes to receive
funding.
The GSC also unanimously approved a wide
ranging amendment to the ASSU Constitution for
the spring ballot at its meeting last night.The pro
posed amendment, which would institute a slew of
changes, was passed by the Undergraduate Senate
on Tuesday and will be on the April ballot.
