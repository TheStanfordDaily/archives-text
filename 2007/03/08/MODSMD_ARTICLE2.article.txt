# PAC-10 PRESSURES
## Anthony Goods returns tonight after being set back with ankle injury, food poisoning 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Walking to class on Friday, sophomore guard
Anthony Goods tried to convince himself that the
rumbling in his stomach was all in his mind.
"I had heard that guys were sick," Goods said of
his teammates, some of whom had begun to feel
the effects of some bad chicken in Thursday's pre
game meal. "I wasn't feeling great, but I just
thought to myself, 'Tough it out, suck it up.' I
walked into the building, and a minute later I was
on the ground on the second floor with a trash
can."
Food poisoning was just the latest setback for
Goods, who sprained his ankle in a game at Wash
ington on Feb. 11. But after two IV drips on Satur
day and a hard workout on Sunday — "I almost
died," Goods said — he should be ready to go
tonight. His comeback comes at an opportune
time, as the sixth-seeded Cardinal (18-11.10-8 Pa
cific-l() Conference) take on third-seeded South
ern California (21-10,11-7) in the first round of the
Pac-10 Tournament.
Stanford, which may need one more win to get
its name on the dance card for the NCAA Tourna
ment. will take as much of Goods as it can get.
"He will stretch the defense with his shot, and
he gives us another defender," head coach Trent
Johnson said."But 1 don't want to put expectations
on the young man after all the time he's missed."
Goods practiced with the team on Monday for
the first time since his injury, though he was limit
ed to no-contact drills.
The Cardinal could use his help on the defen
sive side of the ball against a Trojan team that fea
tures three explosive scorers in juniors Nick Young
and Gabe Pruitt, and senior Lodrick Stewart. The
trio combined for 55 of the Trojans' 69 points in the
teams' last meeting in Los Angeles, a USC win.
Stanford won the first match-up at Maples Pavil
ion. 65-50.

blocked a school-record 1 "J shots and
held USC to 28 percent shooting.
"In the second game, we learned
that it won't happen without our ac
tive effort." I till continued."The first
thing we'll talk about as a team [in
preparation for tonight's game] is de
fense, especially me on Nick Young."
heshman forward Brook Lopez
agreed that the Cardinal lacked a
certain "killer instinct" the last time
it played the Trojans. And Johnson
agreed with Hill's assessment of the
defense, saying that he let Young feel
too comfortable early on.
" ITiose are three guys you can't
let get into a rhythm," Johnson said.
If you let them get easy, uncontest

ed shots early, you're going to have
problems."
Johnson said that the Cardinal
has lacked energy in the last four
games on defense and on the glass —
usually the strengths of Stanford's
game. Those areas will be especially
crucial tonight, against the best
shooting team in the league.
"I haven't been pleased with our
lack of aggressiveness to start games,
even against Arizona State," Johnson
said, referring to the game in which
the Cardinal jumped out to a 12-2 ad
vantage early on but let the Sun Dev
ils creep back in. "We have been re
sponding to teams as opposed to
being proactive."
Stanford will have to first concen
trate on simply staying healthy,
something that has proved surpris

ingly problematic in the last week.
While Goods and the five other play
ers afflicted with food poisoning re
covered over the weekend, two other
members of the Cardinal — starting
freshman center Robin Lopez and
senior guard Carlton Weatherby —
were laid low by stomach tlu and
held out of practice on Monday.
Hut the main medical concern still
lies with Goods. 1 le has spent the last
two weeks trying to get back into
shape, but work on stationary bikes
and underwater treadmills doesn't
necessarily equate to game condi
tioning, especially in a high-pressure
postseason environment. Goods said
that his ankle has felt sore after team
drills, and it's not clear for how long
or how well he'll be able to play.
Sophomore guard Kenny Brown

broke out for 22 points against Ari
zona on Saturday — statistical fig
ures that will get him a significant
chunk of minutes in upcoming
games.
Defense will pose the biggest
challenge for Goods, requiring quick
lateral movement that puts strain on
his tender ankle.The offensive game
should come easier for him, due to
his strength as a spot-up shooter.
Nearly two-thirds of his shots this
year have come from behind the arc.
and his extended range just might ex
tend the Cardinal's season.
The game will tip off at 6 p.m.
tonight in Los Angeles and will be
televised on Fox Sports Net.
