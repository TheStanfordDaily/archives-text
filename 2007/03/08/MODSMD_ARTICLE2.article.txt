# PAC-10 PRESSURES
## Anthony Goods returns tonight after being set back with ankle injury, food poisoning

Walking to class on Friday, sophomore guard
Anthony Goods tried to convince himself that the
rumbling in his stomach was all in his mind.
"I had heard that guys were sick," Goods said of
his teammates, some of whom had begun to feel
the effects of some bad chicken in Thursday's pre
game meal. "I wasn't feeling great, but I just
thought to myself, 'Tough it out, suck it up.' I
walked into the building, and a minute later I was
on the ground on the second floor with a trash
can."
Food poisoning was just the latest setback for
Goods, who sprained his ankle in a game at Wash
ington on Feb. 11. But after two IV drips on Satur
day and a hard workout on Sunday — "I almost
died," Goods said — he should be ready to go
tonight. His comeback comes at an opportune
time, as the sixth-seeded Cardinal (18-11.10-8 Pa
cific-l() Conference) take on third-seeded South
ern California (21-10,11-7) in the first round of the
Pac-10 Tournament.
Stanford, which may need one more win to get
its name on the dance card for the NCAA Tourna
ment. will take as much of Goods as it can get.
"He will stretch the defense with his shot, and
he gives us another defender," head coach Trent
Johnson said."But 1 don't want to put expectations
on the young man after all the time he's missed."
Goods practiced with the team on Monday for
the first time since his injury, though he was limit
ed to no-contact drills.
The Cardinal could use his help on the defen
sive side of the ball against a Trojan team that fea
tures three explosive scorers in juniors Nick Young
and Gabe Pruitt, and senior Lodrick Stewart. The
trio combined for 55 of the Trojans' 69 points in the
teams' last meeting in Los Angeles, a USC win.
Stanford won the first match-up at Maples Pavil
ion. 65-50.

Sophomore guard Anthony Goods returns to Los Angeles and could return to the
court tonight against USC. Goods scored 10 points in the Card's 65-50 win over
the Trojans in January, but he did not play in a 69-65 Stanford loss to USC.
