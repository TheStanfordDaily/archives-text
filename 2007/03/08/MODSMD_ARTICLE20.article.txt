Lawrence Mathers '66, professor
of pediatrics and surgery at the Med
ical School, was found dead in his
San Carlos home on Feb. 21 He was
62. Hie cause of death remains un
certain.
Acting as both the associate di
rector of the intensive care unit at
the Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital and chief of the Med School's
anatomy division, Mathers demon
strated expert leadership and expe
rience in both his clinical and teach
ing roles.
I lis colleagues attribute his unwa
vering popularity with medical stu
dents — evidenced bv the dozen or

so teaching awards he garnered in his
30 years as an instructor at the Uni
versity— to the practical, occupa
tional insights he gained through his
clinical work.
Mathers was also a skilled pianist
and often performed casually for stu
dents and co-workers in the Stanford
I lospital Atrium. In remembrance of
his love for vocal and acoustic musi
cal performance, the Med School
hosted ii concert featuring the work
of George Gershwin on Feb. 22.
A San Francisco local. Mathers
received most of his medical training
at Stanford. I lis wife of 30 years. Mil.

survived by three stepchildren.
Doug, Mark and Beth Jones.
