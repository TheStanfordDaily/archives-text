## Editorial Board Wikipedia with Caution 
### 
It is difficult not to love Wikipedia, the
tree online encyclopedia to which any
one can contribute
(www.wikipedia.org). With 1.674,086 arti
cles in I nglish alone, it provides anyone
with Internet access the ability to ge'. fast,
free information on anything from thu* New
Orleans Mint (operational until 1909), to
the biography ot Weird A 1 Yankovic (he
started accordion lessons at age seven).
In February, the Department of History
at Middlebury College forbade students
from citing Wikipedia as a source in history
papers and tests, also giving notice that stu
dents would not be given any breaks for mis
taken knowledge they derived from the site.
The department's decision received na
tional attention, including a February 21 ar
ticle in The New York Times, and much of
the response has been negative. One op-ed
printed in the Middlebury Campus, the
school newspaper, likened the move to
"censorship" and condemned the profes
sors who advocated the ban.
We have a hard time understanding what
all of the fuss is about. Middlebury's new
rule is hardly censorship. Students are not
prohibited from viewing, discussing or dis
seminating anything from Wikipedia.
Rather, history students have simply been
officially told what should already be obvi
ous: Wikipedia. however useful, is not some
thing that should be cited in a serious aca
demic context, and if it is used, it could re
flect poorly on students' work.
Most university-level students should be
able to discern between Wikipedia and
more reliable online sources like govern
ment databases and online periodicals. To
be fair, some of Wikipedia's entries are spe
cific enough to be extremely valuable in
studying or researching, but others are shal
low, short, and occasionally completely inac
curate. There are many Web sites that can
provide credible resources, but Wikipedia is

not one of them, nor does it purport to he.
Jimmy Wales, one of the founders of
Wikipedia, told The Times that he does not
even consider Middlebury's action "a nega
tive thing."
Naturally, because it is a user-generated
Web site, the articles are not always perfect,
and should not be relied on as much as actu
al class materials. Wikipedia has even intro
duced a citation function where contribu
tors can direct readers to other more well
established sources.
Yet even as we point out that college stu
dents ought to know better than to rely com
pletely on Wikipedia, Middlebury's ban
seems a bit overzealous. Students are also
supposed to use proper grammar and
spelling in assignments, but rather than hav
ing an official policy against poor writing,
most schools simply tell students what the
standards are ahead of time.
It is the role of teachers to advise stu
dents what is acceptable; for some assign
ments it is conceivable that referencing
Wikipedia as an example, rather than an au
thoritative source, might be useful. Instead
of totally banning Wikipedia as an informa
tion source departmentally, history profes
sors at Middlebury should have stressed or
continued to stress that using it could hurt
an individual's performance in the class.
Much like spelling and grammar, if students
already know what is expected in terms of
citations, any deviation from expectations
will make grading easier for professors.
There was a point in time where all Inter
net sources were suspect for most academic
uses. Thankfully, that is no longer the case.
Research has certainly become easier and
more accessible with online help, but some
sites, like some books, are better than others.
We still love Wikipedia and admit that it can
be great for a quick definition or fact, but we
won't be citing it in any papers anytime
soon.
