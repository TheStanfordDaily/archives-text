# The 						OSA should totally hire me
## 
### 
Dear ()ffice of Student Activities:
You guys should totally hire me to work
for you. I'm graduating soon and looking for
employment. Since Vice Provost Greg
Boardman is responding to satire. I assume
you've fired your entire public relations
staff. While your image has been hurt with
the student population. I'm here to humbly
submit my credentials to you.
First, you have an image problem. I'm
great with that. I 'm working on my resume
nowadays for my future career and I've got
ten really creative. I use really zany fonts
and have lots of action photos of me doing
things that seem like work. I'm good at de
picting the entire nothing I do in a very pos
itive light: "Columnist" becomes "Regular
Contributor." for example. "Employee of
the Stanford Daily" becomes"blogger." I'm
also really good at turning my failures into
positives. I mention that I taught kids how to
play tennis, but don't reveal that they would
aim their serves at me when 1 wasn't look
ing. Luckily. I hadn't taught them very well,
so their aim was terrible.
I can do the whole shadowy organiza
tion thing easily.The OSA is renowned for
being faceless, and well, I'm a face people
try to forget. I often wear a trench coat,
and I haven't shaved in months. The only
thing you can count on me for is to have a
creepy voice and to look like I may be car
rying a weapon. While working for the
OSA, I will not discuss the details of my
position, and will have no idea what I'm
supposed to be doing—a sentiment shared
by the student population. Like Hoard
man suggests. I look forward to being
above criticism. Next time someone
makes fun of me in the Daily. I'll have the
stuffed suits to silence them. Hey Board
man. there was a kid in my fourth grade
who stole my lunch one day—can I get you
to beat him up for me?
Also, like the OSA. I have a great sense
of irony. I wear plaid jackets and people
aren't sure if 1 lack style or really think ska is
cool. The whole "are you serious?" motif
runs through your Website —and I love it!
The way you tell people that a party can't
have alcohol be its focus or have alcohol in
its name is. frankly, hilarious. Not only are
the names "Bar Night" and "Happy Hour"
too risque—it would be hilarious if you
started arbitrarily outlawing consonants
from party fliers. It's college, every party's
real name is "drunken people yelling bad
things." I don't drink at parties, and chang
ing the party name to "unicorn cake frolic"
doesn't make me feel more welcomed.

The OSA is into the whole liability thing.
Well, do I have a surprise for you! My entire
family is comprised of lawyers. My first
words were "reckless endangerment." I was
n't allowed to ride a bike for fear that I d sue
my own parents for gross neglect—l was
very accident prone. So I can totally help
you with the whole liability thing.
Your website is designed to prevent even
the most creative of students from generat
ing lawsuits. Despite all of the check boxes
and fill-ins, it is far from fool-proof—which
is why you need me. Imagine if a student list
ed their EANABs as Sudafed and organic
produce. Sounds benign, right? In reality,
they may be serving meth and shrooms —
and you're going to sign off on it! Or. even
worse, they filled out their 1-200, B-28 and
CR forms, got the authorized signatures, but
didn't give six notarized copies or get the
one Ring of Power before attending the
"safety" meetings.
You don't just want to make party plan
ning difficult, you need to make them jump
through so many flaming hoops that they
stumble, catch on fire, and run around
screaming like some kind of escapee of the
fiery furnace while the audience looks on in
stunned silence.
Finally, I hate the student population.
Truly, I despise them. They stumble around
like they run the place.They drink in excess.
ITiey make poor decisions.They throw their
bodily fluids all over this well-gardened
campus. A single drink and they try to dance
on tables in the middle of traffic. But most of
all. I don't respect the students because if
they ever all decided to not register parties
en masse, like have one weekend where all
of the social managers boycotted the OSA.
they could enact immediate and terrifying
change. I fear them because a government
only works if the populace is willing to be
governed. So I don't respect them—yet.
So I want to help you micromanage
them further. If you need someone to can
cel a party at the last minute. I'm your man.
You need a meaningless and ironic rule in-

Holt's Harangue
stituted? 1 can come up with one of
the wordiest, most redundant, and
verbose statements ever. I'm an ex
pert at mandating groups to come
for pointless meetings and start
committees that may at some soon
er date reach a decision, only to
have that decision overturned.
I also want to learn from you. My
tears are still made of mostly water,
but I'm curious how you get yours to
be molten lava. I also still feel emo
tions like sympathy and regret, and
I 'm looking forward to learning how

to properly cleanse myself of these
superfluities in your training regime.
I've heard it includes trust falls. Fun!
I'm not merciless, but hopefully, in
time, 1 can be.
I thank you for your time and 1
look forward to your response. I
don't work weekends and 1 will be
unreachable by phone, but then
again, so are you. I'll admit I'm not
the hardest worker, but I've certain
ly got the right attitude.
With steel eyebrows and malice,
Chris

Cliris wonders what would happen to
tlu- bureaucrats if the students just
stopped listening to them. Send com
