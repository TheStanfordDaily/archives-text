# Upperclassmanship
## 
### 
Just the other day someone asked me for
directions to Maples Pavilion, and so
shocked was I at this utterly obvious
question that it took me a few seconds to and
tell them it was further down Campus and on
the right. But then 1 remember my dazed and
confused freshman self frantically searching
for"The I listory Corner"on the back page of
the Time Schedule, irate that a professor
would list a class location that doesn't corre
spond to its name on the map.
My recent run-ins with a few Donde
McWheres have caused me contemplate my
frosh days of locational perplexity, until 1 re
alized that over the years, I have ever-so
slowly morphed into That Senior, the one
who doesn't even recognize she exhibits all
the standard signs of Upperclassmanship. It
is like when an adult is so far removed from
being a child that they are astonished when
five year olds are scared of the dark, struggle
with sarcasm or can't find the Red Barn.
Many a thing has changed since my youthful
days of fountain-hopping, plunking down my
tray next to strangers in the dining hall, and
allotting myself 20 minutes to find my classes.
Upon greater reflection, I realized my as
sumed universal and intimate knowledge of

Stanford's campus was just one of the many
Upperclassmanshippy mindsets that had
slowly seeped into and ultimately infiltrated
my innocent frosh mind of four years prior.
For example, now not only am 1 surprised,
bordering on incredulous, when a student
doesn't know how to get to a building on
Stanford's campus, but I have admittedly
started to get a little cocky in my description
giving. 1 tend to add a flourish here, a poten
tially helpful but unsolicited detail there. It's
as if 1 can't help but subconsciously show
those newbies just how much they don't
know. "Oh Cantor? Yeah it's past the Old
Chem building and on the corner of Campus.
Make sure you see the Goldsworthy out
side."
Additionally, instead of viewing Stanford

as the expansive Farmland I once thought it
was, 1 now see it as the most modest-sized of
bubbles. I ran into my awkwardly-ended old
flame at the Bookstore. 1 saw my smelly
freshman year roommate in the CoHo.And.
unfortunately, I have section with my
roomie's longtime-pined-for, ultimately un
requited love. Since when did Stanford
shrink itself down to a "Dawson's Creek
episode?
As the years have passed, 1 have also be
come more selective in where and how I
spend my weekends. While as a frosh 1 was
gung-ho for whatever frat ho-down was hap
pening. there are only so many overcrowded,
too-loud, grinding moshes a girl can with
stand. I've bid au revoir to the transformed
lounges whose dew point exceeds that ot
most Venezuelan rainforests and the intense,
spawning-fish-like effort needed to move
from the dance floor to the patio. Instead, I
now hang out at smaller room shingdigs. and
silver-sticker my way to local Paly bars dur
ing Senior Night — it is amazing the conver
sations that naturally arise when five speak
ers aren't blowing out your right ear drum.

Perhaps one of Ihe most signifi
cant changes that has taken place is
my outlook on my own social life.
While freshman year I wanted every
and anyone to be my new bestie. as
an upperclassman, I've stopped try
ing to make friends, and have started
simply trying to maintain the ones
I've got. 1 no longer pop into my
neighbor's room for a chat on the
way to the bathroom or religiously
attend house meetings. Rather, 1 am
desperately trying to keep in some
sort of touch with my friends from
abroad, from working at Sierra
Camp or from freshman year. I don't
see even my drawmates enough, and
it seems I have to frantically sched
ule dinner and lunches to even have
the vaguest idea of my friends' go
ings-on. These days 1 bee-line it to
the lieu and am at the library at 10
p.m. on Wednesdays—l'm sorry
i'roshes. but I just don't have the
time.
The greatest indication of Up
perclassmanship, however, is the
way in which upperclassmen reflect
upon their freshman year. While
freshman and often sophomores
think back on their current and pre

vious year as an adjustment, a mo
ment of personal exploration and
identity-finding, I view freshman
year just as 1 do Bth grade — soooo
long ago, a supply of endlessly em
barrassing subject matter, and fash
ion faux pas after bad haircut after
abysmal boyfriend. Senior Katie is
not sure she knows Freshman Katie,
although she looks stunningly simi
lar and seems to be acquainted with
a lot of the same friends.
Granted, that's what happens in
college. You grow up. you change,
and then bwammo, you look
through your freshman year jour
nal and find out you are just the
non-hall-meeting-attending, unin
terested senior you had malicious
ly condemned four years earlier.
Luckily, a large part of Upper
classmanship is condemning the
condemnations of your earlier self.
And perhaps that is what growing
up is about, critiquing your old
self, making better choices than
before, having a fuller understand
ing of what you want. That, and
knowing where the Treehouse is.
You know they take Cardinal Dol
lars, not Points.

Partly due to the uncannily pleasant
weather, a particularly had strain of
Upperclassnumship has been going
around. Email Katie at kttaylor@ if you
too have recently come down with it.
