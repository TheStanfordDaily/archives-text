Zimbardo will be missed
Three and a half years ago 1 wrote an op
ed for the Daily on the subject of Phil Zim
bardo's retirement ("Zimbardo is the real
Dr.Phil,"Nov. 19,2003).5ince I wrotethatar
ticle, I have gone back to teaching high school
psychology and Stanford students have con
tinued to benefit from Phil's teaching in his
emeritus capacity I read with regret in the
Daily that Phil would be giving his last lec
ture Wednesday.
While Phil has certainly earned his retire
ment. I am once again saddened to think of
the void he will leave. What Zimbardo "gets,"
which so few psychologists apparently do. is
the necessity for broadcasting findings about
human behavior to the public.
Some of Phil's Stanford psychology col
leagues do get it. Professor Carol Dweck's re
cent book suggesting that intelligence can be
grown and is not largely fixed is a good exam
ple of taking psychology public. Professor Al
bert Bandura's findings about modeling have
been incorporated in third-world country
soap opera television to encourage the use of
birth control.

During his Presidential Address to the
American Psychological Association (APA)
in 2003 in Toronto, Phil urged his colleagues
to get their message out to the public by
doing things like writing op-eds for local
newspapers. I lis exhortation echoed a call to
psychologists in l%9by then-APA President
George Miller to "give psychology away"
Miller suggested that practitioners needed to
share their findings with the public in ways
that could apply to individuals' daily lives.
While educating legions of Stanford stu
dents, Phil Zimbardo has simultaneously
managed to get his messages out to much
larger audiences. We must now hope that
Phil's model is followed by his successors.

We should all Teach for America
I was thrilled to see Allison Dedrick's ar
ticle on Teach for America in the March 7
issue of the Daily ("Teaching Decisions"),
and hope it gives rise to more thought about
this program at Stanford. As my class ap

proaches the inexorable end of our time
here, I am struck and saddened by how few
students I know who even considered this
program or others like it.
Teach for America (TFA) represents the
sort of commitment I wish more Stanford
students would make after graduation. So
many of these talented and driven people get
sucked straight into grad school, consulting,
and the truly noxious "i-banking." 1 have al
ways felt that those endeavors fail to harness
the imaginations of our phenomenal gradu
ates. and when they do, harness them for all
the wrong reasons.
According to the New York Times, in 2(K)5
the applicant pool for TFA consisted of 12%
of Yale's graduating class, 11% of Dart
mouth s.andB% of Harvard and Princeton's.
I do not doubt that these numbers have in
creased; in the 2(K)h process over 19,(XX) peo
ple applied for 2.4(H) positions. Note Stan
ford's absence in this list.
Stanford is a place with astoundingly bril
liant students. Some I've known in my four
years at Stanford could work wonders in any
