## Last hangout at home Five seniors honored in their final home meet, face No.2 Penn State and No. 9 lowa 
### DANNY BELCH 
For the No. 5 Stanford men's gymnastics
team, this Saturday's tri-meet versus No. 2
Penn State and No. 8 lowa is important for at
least five reasons: It is the last home meet of
the season, making it the last home meet for
five seniors.
ITieir last home meet marks the team's an
nual senior night, when the five seniors
(Dylan Carney, Peter Derman, Alex
Schorsch, Brice Rolston and Josh Goldman)
will be honored for their contributions and

commitment to the team over the past four
vears. All five athletes should see plenty of ac
tion during their last home meet in a Stanford
uniform.They will he taking the meet very se
riously. as they do not want a repeat of what
happened around this time last year in Uni
versity Park. Pa.
The Cardinal had seemingly wrapped up
what appeared to he a hard-fought victory
over a very good opponent in Penn State. But
home-team advantage kicked in for the ap
parently defeated Nittany Lions. At the end
of the competition, Penn State appealed

three scores from earlier in the meet, after
what already seemed to the Cardinal like bi
ased judging throughout the day.The Nittany
Lions won their appeals, gained a few tenths
of a point here and there, and shockingly
earned enough to barely squeak by the Car
dinal, 216.800-216.750. That half of a tenth of
a point is the reason that Saturday's meet is so
important for the Cardinal squad.
"We really want to beat them this year,"
co-captain Carney said. "After what hap
pened last year at their place, beating them in
our house would be really awesome."
But 2006's tight loss is something that
coach Thorn Glielmi does not want the team
to mull over.
"I'd rather not talk about it," Glielmi said.
"It was last year — it's over. We have our eyes
on new things right now. We have a different
team this year, and so do they."
lowa and Penn State will not be easy victo
ries for the Cardinal. Glielmi,in his sixth year
as head coach, points out that among the
challenges from both opponents are their
gymnasts from outside the United States.
"Usually, if guys are from the United
States.it is easier to track them and know how
they perform because they probably have
competed in some sort of [United States Na
tional Team program]," Glielmi said.
But take teams like lowa and Penn State,
which feature gymnasts from Puerto Rico.
Canada and Europe, and the scouting gets a
bit more difficult.
"With guys from outside the U.S., you
never know what they have in store for that
night," Glielmi said. "You don't know what
they are going to bring. But we have our own
things to focus on. We have our eye on April."
April brings the NCAA Championships,
which Glielmi is optimistic for if the Cardinal
can put it all together at once. After several
disheartening injuries, the team has put a
solid lineup together that will carry the Car
dinal into the big meets. The Stanford team
believes that whoever goes out and competes
will be able to get the job done, no matter
what.
"Another big thing for us is that we are not
dependent on emotion to be able to hit."
Glielmi said. "Other teams have to get their
guys up. yelling and screaming, in order to hit.
We don't rely on that, which will really work
in our favor come championship time."
Glielmi is also not hesitant to rest some
athletes as the season comes to a close. Der
man, a team co-captain, did not compete last
weekend and standout sophomore Bryant
Hadden will only compete in a few events this
weekend. This move is to ensure the best and
healthiest possible lineup for the champi
onship season.
"We have the potential to post a [total
score above 220]." Glielmi said. "That is a
very competitive score at the NCAAs. If we
have all our guys healthy and at their best,
then we just might be the team to beat."
Saturday's meet begins at 7 p.m. at Burn
ham Pavilion.
