### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
After successfully hosting in-state foes. Stan
ford women's tennis now welcomes out-of-state
opponents. Coming off of dominating performanc
es against Pepperdine and California, the No. 4

Cardinal looks to continue its six-match winning
streak when the team faces No. 26 Oregon and No.
30 Texas.
Although the two teams are not as highly
ranked as some of the opponents the Cardinal (li
-1) has recently beaten, the matches shouldn't be
"gimmes" by any means.
Freshman Lindsay Burdette gave her opinion
on Pacific-10 Conference foe Oregon, recognizing
the Ducks' foreign players and stating that "their
top couple players are very good."
