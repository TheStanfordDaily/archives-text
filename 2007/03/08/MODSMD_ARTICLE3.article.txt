# No "gimmes" for Card
## Women's tennis hosts Oregon and Texas, overcomes injuries 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
After successfully hosting in-state foes. Stan
ford women's tennis now welcomes out-of-state
opponents. Coming off of dominating performanc
es against Pepperdine and California, the No. 4

Cardinal looks to continue its six-match winning
streak when the team faces No. 26 Oregon and No.
30 Texas.
Although the two teams are not as highly
ranked as some of the opponents the Cardinal (li
-1) has recently beaten, the matches shouldn't be
"gimmes" by any means.
Freshman Lindsay Burdette gave her opinion
on Pacific-10 Conference foe Oregon, recognizing
the Ducks' foreign players and stating that "their
top couple players are very good."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women face the Lady Long
horns on Sunday, one day after their match against
Oregon. Texas is 1 -3 in its last four games with all three
losses coming against top-10 opponents. Texas faces
another top-10 team in Stanford, who dropped from
No. 1 to No. 4 since last week.
In particular, Stanford may see stiff
competition from the Ducks' No. 1 play
er. Dominika Dieskova.The Oregon sen
ior is second all-time on Oregon's career
win list and reached the NCAA Champi
onships as a freshman in the 2003-04 sea
son.
"I think it'll be a really good match
against Oregon." senior Anne Yelsey
said. "They have a couple of really tough
players. It's not going to be easy — we're
going to have to play well."
The Longhorns shouldn't be a
walkover, either. As Yelsey mentioned,
Stanford faced Texas in the NCAA
Championships two years ago. so the Car
dinal knows that the Longhorns will
come prepared.
Burdette spoke highly of the possibly
overlooked Longhorns team.
"They are grossly underrated," she
said.' They are ranked in the mid 30s right
now. but they have a lot of good players
and they're a dangerous team. And. their
coach is a really good coach."
Ironically enough, the Longhorns'
coach. Patty Fendick-McCain. is a Stan
ford alumnus ('B7) and former member
of the tennis team where she won the
NCAA singles championship and was
named national player of the year. Bur
dette said this adds a little twist to the
match, and even more motivation for the
Cardinal to go out and get the victory.
Despite the Cardinal's continued suc
cess. Stanford's previous No. 1 ranking
has dropped due to the emergence of
teams such as Florida and Notre Dame.
Nonetheless, Stan ford's current's outlook
on the season is rather optimistic. After
all.it just got through the roughest stretch
of its season, plagued with injuries and
tough opponents,and came out undefeat
ed.
"Last weekend was a big confidence
booster." Yelsey said. "It was a good
weekend: it was a tough weekend. We had
to fight physically. Everyone's taken a few
days easy, and we're getting back to
work."
Severely testing Stanford's team char
acter. the injury bug has run rampant
within the team. Against Pepperdine,
sophomore Jessica Nguyen had to effec

tively forfeit her singles match due to a
foot injury. Other nicks, bruises and bouts
of sickness have plagued members of the
team. too.
In spile of all the damage,the Cardinal
has not flinched.
"There are going to be injuries on
every team." Yelsey said."We just have to
take care of business."
"It's definitely been frustrating at
times and adding an element that usually

They have a couple of
really tough players.
It's not going to be
easy.
isn't a factor," Burdettc said of the in
juries. "We've all stepped up to the plate
and definitely risen to the occasion and
done what we had to do."
As a whole, things are looking up for
the Cardinal as it nears the stretch-run
before the NCAA Championships in
May.
Yelsey, a senior with three national
championships and a world of experience
under her belt, compared this year's
squad to those of the past.
"1 think the team this year is so much
different than any team we've had in the
last few years." she said. "We got to a slow
start and it was kind of difficult to get our
momentum back, but I think we're right
where we want to be (at this point in the
season]."
Both Saturday's match against Ore
gon and Sunday's contest with Texas will
lie played at the Taubc Family Tennis
Center at noon.
