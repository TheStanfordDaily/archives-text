## Panel judges Band vandals 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nine students charged with Fundamental Stan
dard violations stemming from the vandalism of
the Band Shak last July have been held "not re
sponsible" by the Office of Judicial Affairs, the
Band said yesterday.
The Judicial Affairs panel decided that eight of
the nine students appearing before it had damaged
property, according to Band members involved, but
that none had violated the Fundamental Standard.
The latest development comes after almost
eight months of uncertainty for Band members.
