## Panel judges Band vandals 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nine students charged with Fundamental Stan
dard violations stemming from the vandalism of
the Band Shak last July have been held "not re
sponsible" by the Office of Judicial Affairs, the
Band said yesterday.
The Judicial Affairs panel decided that eight of
the nine students appearing before it had damaged
property, according to Band members involved, but
that none had violated the Fundamental Standard.
The latest development comes after almost
eight months of uncertainty for Band members.

In July 2006, vandals damaged the Band Shak (pictured above). Eight students, who ap
peared before a Judicial Affairs panel, claimed that the University had planned to eventually
demolish the Band Shak. The members remain suspended from the Band for now.
Complex was vandalized the night of
July 17.2()()h. During the ensuing po
lice investigation, nine students were
identified and implicated in the inci
dent. On Sept. 14, the University
placed the Band on indefinite provi
sional status as a student organiza
tion. named Associate Dean Chris
Griffith as its interim director and
assigned her the task of approving
performances. In November, the
Santa Clara County district attor
ney's office decided not to press
criminal charges.
Hie Daily contacted several ad
ministrators — including represen
tatives of the Athletic Department,
Student Affairs and University
Communications — seeking com
ment on the ajudication hut they
were unable to speak about the
issue, citing the Judicial Charter's
ban on discussion of any proceed
ings.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman could not comment
specifically on the case because of
the confidentiality requirements, but
he cited his previous experience as
the Dean of Students, in which he
was responsible for signing off on ju
dicial cases.
"In some cases students were
found 'not responsible.' however, it
wasn't always the case that students
were exonerated for their behavior."
Boardman said in an email to The
Daily.
Although initial damage esti

mates offered by the University
ranged from $30,000 to $50,000. the
Band says that the actual damage
was around $8,000. As far as the stu
dents involved were aware, they
said the old Band Shak modular
was going to be destroyed by the
University after the Band moved
out its decorations, equipment and
files into its new Band Shak near
the former DeGuerre Squash
Courts.
"Prior to the incident, the band
was not given the indication that the
facility would be preserved after we
moved out," said Band Manager
Adam Cohen '07, in a release sent
yesterday as a response to inquiries
by The Daily. "The vandalism was
absolutely a mistake, hut these are
still fundamentally good people
we're talking about, and I'm glad
that the panel chose to consider the
context of their actions."
Boardman said that he has "been in
formed that the band was assessed
approximatley $8K in repair costs.
Due to the fact that much of the re
pair work was conducted pro bono
by a benefactor," he said yesterday,
"I do not know the actual repair
costs."
One of the students whose case
was adjudicated last Friday agreed
to speak candidly about the incident
proceedings in exchange for
anonymity.
"[As the Band was moving out of
the Band Shak modular], there were
Band members that were occasion
ally damaging the building, inadver
tently and intentionally, with little
regard to the fact that the building
would he used again," the suspended
Band member said. "We had little

reason not to [damage the Band
Shak |. Once one person started
doing something, the others fol
lowed suit. It did not get far out of
hand."
The Band announced yesterday
that the nine students will "remain
suspended from the Band pending
review by Griffith, who, keeping
with the strict confidentiality of the
case, is unable to comment."
"The Band at large hopes that the
individuals will soon be able to re
turn to the organization," the press
release stated.
Griffith told The Daily late Wednes
day that "discussions are on-going
about the possible return of individ
ual students who were suspended."
The Band remains on indefinite sus
pension, but a Band Reinstatement
Committee has been examining the
issue and is expected to announce its
conclusions soon.
"I'm hesitant to identify a specif
ic time from that, if not met. would
lead folks to believe we're behind
schedule," Griffith said in an email to
The Daily. "In fact, we've made good
progress and expect to forward our
final recommendations to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs in
April."
Members of the Band were opti
mistic about the recent ruling. The
suspended member described the
Judicial Affairs process as "long and
drawn out."
"I am looking forward to this
chapter closing," he said. The end of
the Judicial Affairs case "will be the
punctuation mark."
