# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1 • Goods to Go?
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods won't be at
full strength, but some sharp outside shooting
could stretch Southern California's defense and
take some pressure off Stanford's post players. If
not, the Cardinal will look to redshirt sophomore
guard Kenny Brown for relief.
2. Second Chances
Stanford has out-rebounded its Pac-10 oppo
nents by a margin of 6.1 boards per game (in
cluding an average of plus-13.5 in two games
against the Trojans), but the Cardinal looked
lackluster in that department last weekend. The
Card will need to pound the offensive glass for
put-backs tonight; the Trojans are holding oppo
nents to 38.6 percent shooting from the field
the best in the Pac-10.
3. Blocking Out
Stanford recorded the fifth-highest number of
blocks in a single game in NCAA history during
the teams' first meeting this season. The Cardinal
rejected 19 shots by the Trojans en route to a 65-
50 victory. The second time around, Stanford sent
back only four shots. Interior defense is a must
tonight against a team that leads the conference
in shooting percentage.
4. Selection by Committee
The coach and players brush off suggestions that
they are thinking about the NCAA Tournament,
but a turgid Thursday might leave the Cardinal at
home come Selection Sunday.
5. Playing on empty
stomachs
Eight Stanford players have become intimate with
the inside of a trash can or toilet bowl in the last
week, including three starters and the injured
Goods. For the players' own sake, butterflies had
better be the only thing the Cardinal men feel in
their guts tonight.
