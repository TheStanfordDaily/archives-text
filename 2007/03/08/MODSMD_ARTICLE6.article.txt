# Women earn six top seeds
## Top-ranked swimming and diving team looks for first national title since 1998 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming and diving team looks to
cap off its season with a national title
at this weekend's NCAA Champi
onships in Minneapolis. Sixteen swim
mers and two divers will compete in a
total of 42 individual events and five
relays at the three-day meet.
Although the Cardinal has consis
tently been a top finisher at the cham
pionship meet, it has finished fifth the

past three years and has not earned a
national title since 1998.
"To say we are in the hunt for a na
tional title is an exciting position to he
in," Stanford head coach Lea Maurer
said. "You can tell by everyone's de
meanor around the pool that we are
contenders and a force to he reckoned
with."
For a Stanford (10-0,6-0 Pacific-10
Conference) squad that has empha-
sized team success over individual
performance throughout the season,
it is especially significant to have
such a large number of swimmers
competing in the championship
meet.
"Having a big group is exciting
and a tribute to the group." Maurer
said."ln order for us to do well at the
meet, every swimmer who has made
it has to do her part."
Cardinal swimmers hold the top
seed in six of the meet's 18 events.
Freshman Julia Smit leads the team
with the top seed in three individual
events (the 2(X)-yard backstroke and
2(H)- and 400-yard individual med
leys). Smit holds an especially domi
nant position in the 4(H) IM. with a
seed time 5.25 seconds faster than
that of the next-fastest competitor.
Smit's classmate Elaine Breeden
is top-seeded in the 2(H) butterfly
and junior Caroline Bruce holds the
top position in the 2(X) breaststroke.
Stanford's 2(H) medley relay team of
Bruce. Breeden,junior Brooke Bish
op and another swimmer yet to be
announced is also top-ranked.
"Bruce and Bishop are definitely
going to be important leaders for the
team this weekend, but it is great to
have freshmen Breeden and Smit as

top contenders," Maurer said. "The
beauty of them is that they are excit
ed and have no idea what to expect.
They just love to race and don't have
programmed expectations for the
meet."
Breeden and Smit have already
proven they have what it takes to
succeed in championship-level com
petition. At the Pac-10 Champi
onships last month, Smit won the
200 backstroke and 200 and 400 IM
events, breaking a 15-year-old
school record in the 200 IM. Bree
den took the 200 fly at the meet and
broke a five-year-old school record.
In addition to the six top seeds,
Stanford holds second seeds in
three events and third-seeds in two
events. Breeden has the second
fastest entry time in the 100 fly. and
the 400 medley relay team of Smit.
Bruce, Breeden and Bishop is also
slated to come in second. Breeden
holds the third position in the 200
IM. while Bruce has it in the 100
breast. The team of Smit, Breeden.
Bishop and a fourth swimmer (to be
announced) holds third in the 200
free relay.
With such impressive seeding, the
Cardinal is in good position to claim
the national title, but the team ac

knowledges that it will be going up
against tough competition.
"If everything goes our way.
there's a good chance we can win."
Maurer said. "But we can't predict
how the other teams are going to
swim, so our task is to focus on what
we can control and make sure we
have our peak performances."
Stanford's main competition for
the title include Auburn, California,
Arizona and Texas A & M. who are
ranked second through fifth, respec
tively Hie Cardinal beat the Tigers,
Golden Bears (10-1,5-1 Pac-10)and
Wildcats (8-2. 4-2 Pac-10) in dual
meet competition earlier this sea
son. but came in second to Arizona
at December's Texas Invitational
Meet and the Pac-10 Champi
onships. Despite the strong competi
tion. Stanford's squad is confident as
it heads into the meet.
"We're really excited to finally
have the championship meet upon
us," Maurer said. "We feel really
good about our preparation, and we
feel like we are in good position and
are ready to be a presence on the na
tional scene."
