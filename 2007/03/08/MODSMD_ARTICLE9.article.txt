# UP AND DOWN THE PAC-10
## 
### 
Often overlooked during championship week, the Pacific-10 Conference finds itself in the spotlight this year after a roller-coaster season. While
UCLA has emerged as a clear favorite, unpredictability abounds and lower-than-usual seeds like Arizona and Washington will look to make a
splash. The jury is out on whether tonight's game against Southern California is a must-win for Stanford to make the NCAA tournament, but it's
safe to say a win would have the Cardinal faithful resting easy on selection day.
10 ZONA STATE (2-16)
y yIL-4 Lost five of its last seven games of the regular season, but was coming off a momentum-gaining 42-41 win over California going
into last night's match-up with Washington. The 10th-seeded Sun Devils have been playing close to teams all season, playing eight
conference games decided by five points or less. So, it wasn't that much of a surprise when ASU gained a 45-41 upper hand in the
middle of last night's second half. The Huskies rallied to close out the game, outscoring the Sun Devils 18-6 to clinch the win. As the
old adage suggests, winning is everything, especially in the Pac-10.
ign* 9 OREGON STATE
Oregon State, in the ninth seed, had the best chance of the two bottom dwellers to get an upset in yesterday's play-in game. It didn't
happen, though, as the Beavers were pounded, 70-51 by California. Oregon State (3-15) was the only team without a single All-Pac
-10 selection or honorable mention, and failed to rebound from last week's 49-70 trouncing at the hands of cross-state rival Oregon.
S? £ 8 CALIFORNIA (6-12)
Eighth-seeded Cal (6-12) appeared in the tournament's championship game last season, only to be handed a 71-52 beating by
UCLA. Without Leon Powe this year, it'll be difficult to get that far again. But with last night's play-in win, the Bears snapped a four
game losing streak. Cal went on a 34-2 run, with eight three-pointers, to take the lead in the first half and eventually finish off the
Beavers. The Bears' last win in the regular season, coincidentally enough, also came against Oregon State.
u_,|_7 WASHINGTON (810)
HtsQM Winning the Pac-10 Tournament is a must for disappointing Washington (8-10) to make the NCAAs. Winners of two straight, against
USC and UCLA no less, the seventh-seeded Huskies seem primed for the spoiler role. Their lone road victory, a 66-61 win at Ari
zona State, may point otherwise, but Washington at least redeemed itself with a 59-51 win over the Sun Devils last night. Whether
the Huskies can win over any other team at Staples is yet to be seen.
A 6 STANFORD (10-8)
Head coach Trent Johnson says Stanford should make the NCAA tournament "win or lose," but the sixth-seeded Cardinal (10-8)
may need one more just to be sure. While Johnson cautioned against expecting too much, sophomore guard Anthony Goods
\JL should play in tonight's game against USC. Along with AII-Pac-10 honors for Lawrence Hill, and All-Freshmen honors for Brook
Lopez, Goods' return could be the boost Stanford needs.
ES ARIZONA (11-7)
This year's fifth seed represents the lowest ever for Arizona (11-7) in the tournament's 10 years. The Wildcats are essentially a lock
for the Big Dance and could make a splash in the Pac-1 Os as well. Chase Budinger got the nod for Pac-10 Freshman of the Year,
but experienced hands like AII-Pac-10 forward Marcus Williams and reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week Ivan Radenovic know what
it takes to win in the postseason.
\ 4 OREGON (11-7)
I Fourth-seeded Oregon (11-7) upset Washington in last season's tournament before losing to Cal in a double-overtime semifinal
thriller. All Pac-10 guard Aaron Brooks leads the team and the Pac-10 in scoring with 18 points per game. The Ducks had a solid
season, including quality wins over UCLA, Washington State and Arizona, but get a first-round match up against the Wildcats as a
reward.
S3 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (11 6)
A first-round loss to Stanford could put USC's NCAA Tournament credentials in question, but the team is more or less a lock. Third
is the highest seed for the Trojans (11-6) in the Pac-10s, and the squad will have a friendly crowd at Los Angeles' Staples Center.
Head coach Tim Floyd said the Pac-10 Tournament is wide open, and prevailing opinion agrees.
i7 2 WASHINGTON STATE (13-5)
Washington State, picked to finish last in the preseason media poll, now finds itself a two seed in the Pac-10 Tournament after its
best regular season in 60 years. First-year coach Tony Bennett took Pac-10 Coach of the Year honors, and Derrek Low and Kyle
Weaver were each named AII-Pac-10. The Cougars (13-5) don't play a pretty brand of basketball, but they've been getting the wins.
Tonight's match up against rival Washington is must-see TV.
MtAt 1 UCLA (15-3)
A likely No. 1 seed for the Big Dance, UCLA (15-3) will look to repeat for the tournament crown before making a deep run in the
NCAAs. Pac-10 Player of the Year Aaron Afflalo leads a deep and talented squad that is thinking about a national championship.
Darren Collison has capable filled in for Jordan Farmar at point guard, and the consensus is that the Bruins are better than last year
— a scary thought.

A first-round loss to Stanford could put USC's NCAA Tournament credentials in question, but the team is more or less a lock. Third
is the highest seed for the Trojans (11-6) in the Pac-10s, and the squad will have a friendly crowd at Los Angeles' Staples Center.
Head coach Tim Floyd said the Pac-10 Tournament is wide open, and prevailing opinion agrees.
i7 2 WASHINGTON STATE (13-5)
Washington State, picked to finish last in the preseason media poll, now finds itself a two seed in the Pac-10 Tournament after its
best regular season in 60 years. First-year coach Tony Bennett took Pac-10 Coach of the Year honors, and Derrek Low and Kyle
Weaver were each named AII-Pac-10. The Cougars (13-5) don't play a pretty brand of basketball, but they've been getting the wins.
Tonight's match up against rival Washington is must-see TV.
MtAt 1 UCLA (15-3)
A likely No. 1 seed for the Big Dance, UCLA (15-3) will look to repeat for the tournament crown before making a deep run in the
NCAAs. Pac-10 Player of the Year Aaron Afflalo leads a deep and talented squad that is thinking about a national championship.
Darren Collison has capable filled in for Jordan Farmar at point guard, and the consensus is that the Bruins are better than last year
— a scary thought.
