112 )/ ' In the United States each year, nearly 1 million
\ ystr J •I / people die from heart disease, while 60 mil
/ ill I I \ lion Americans live with some form of cardiac
u \ J disease. Moreover, heart disease is the leading
' i t fi~■
I cause of death in women ot all ages. With a
pioneering history of "firsts," including the first
heart transplant in the US, the first heart/lung transplant in the world, and one of the first
left ventricular assist device procedure in the world, cardiovascular surgery and research
at Stanford continues to be a major focus of the School of Medicine.
Drs. Robert C. Robbins, Mark A. Hlatky and Thomas Robinson, three leading Stan
ford researchers, will ask how it has happened that heart disease has become the num
ber-one killer in the US, and what is being done about it. They will examine the percep
tions and realities of heart disease in America, the outlook for our children, as well as
the personal and societal costs of heart disease. They will also cover new and emerging
treatments that are being developed at Stanford and elsewhere.
