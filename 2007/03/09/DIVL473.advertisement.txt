campus between noon and 5:00 p.m. Staff duties will continue through September 21. on campus between noon and 5:00 p.m.
• Sophomore College Assistants (SCAs): Each faculty member is assisted by two upper-class sophomore college assistants (SCAs). SCAs have a combination of three roles: academic advisor, residence staff, and teaching assistant. They will
live in residence with student participants, report to and collaborate with the faculty teaching the course, and collaborate and coordinate structured residential activities with the Assistant Directors. Any student who will be a junior or senior
in 2007-2008 and is in good academic standing is eligible to apply. (In some instances, one of the SCAs may be a graduate student.) Undergraduate SCAs will receive room, board, and a stipend of $800 ($1,175 for graduate SCAs) for full
time work during the course of the program, and for potential planning meetings with faculty at the end of this spring quarter. Important Note: You may not participate in both Honors College and SOCO. Because training for OV, KA, RCC, and
HPAC positions conflict with Sophomore College, if you are selected for both positions, you must choose between them. We will coordinate with Peer Mentor training, so this position will not conflict. Students who have applied to be CTL sub
ject tutors. FAs, liTAs, or other dorm staff positions should consult about possible conflicts before accepting that position or Sophomore College spots.
• Residential Computer Coordinators (RCCs) and Oral Communication Tutors (OCTs): RCCs and OCTs will also live in residence and will receive room and board as part of their compensation. Only RCC applicants that have already com
pleted RCC training can be considered. The stipend for RCCs will be in an amount of $500 and the OCTs will be paid an hourly wage commensurate with level of training.
