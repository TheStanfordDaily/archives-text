I tend to listen to a small set of
songs over and over until I grow
tired of them, then move onto the
next batch. Any type of music has
a fair shot of getting pulled into the
rotation. In choosing songs for the
playlist, I usually listen more for the
melody and beat of a song than the
actual message of the lyrics. Here's
a sampling of what I'm listening to
now:
- 'Southern Sun," Paul Oakenfold
I can listen to this track at any time
of day or night, whether I'm head
ing out or returning home. It's also
the current ringtone on my cell
phone.
- "Hird," Keep You Hird
Listening to this tune (or any of the

- "Flow Natural," Tito el Bambino,
featuring Beenie Man
Genre-wise, I think I'm most
partial to Latin music, house and
hip-hop, though I'm not a music
snob, so I have guilty pleasures that
lie in the pop/top-40 range. I think
I've come upon those based on my
history and my work, but I think the
biggest thing for me is the actual
beats behind the music. If I think it's
danceable, fresh and fun, then I
usually like it. So this means I don't
have a favorite artist but I do have
favorite producers, like Rick Rock,
Just Blaze, Traxxamillion and The
Neptunes.

remixes) makes me feel hip and
trendy. On a side note, I've learned
that nobody really uses terms like
"hip" and "trendy" anymore.
- "Dry Land," Tara Mac Lean
I've seen reviews that compare Tara
Mac Lean's voice to that of Sarah
McLachlan. This track, a slower
song that isn't sleepy, is one of my
favorites.
- Beethoven Violin Concerto
Pure and elegant. If I could own
only one piece of classical music,
this would be it.

I have a large music collection, currently with
14,262 tracks on my iPod. I enjoy music of many gen
res, and so right now you could find much of the Great
American Songbook standards (sung by Frank Sinatra,
Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nat King Cole, Sarah
Vaughn, Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Nancy Wil
son, plus more modern interpreters such as Tierney Sut
ton, Stacey Kent, Peter Cincotti and Michael Buble),
and a huge collection of classic jazz, by all the greats
(such as Cannonball Adderley, Charles Mingus, Char
lie Parker, Dave Brubeck, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Elling
ton, Louis Armstrong, Oscar Peterson, Vince Guaraldi
and others).
My symphonic music collection includes most of the
works of many of the best-known composers, often with

several different versions available. So if Beethoven,
Mozart, Handel, Haydn, Mahler, Bac, or Tchaikovsky
wrote it, I likely have it. I also have a large collection of
sacred music in the Western tradition, mostly 12th to
16th century Latin settings.
On the more modern side, from my youth forward,
I have the complete U2, Beatles, Ray Charles, Huey
Lewis and Chicago sets, to name a few. At the risk of
making my sons cringe, I will admit to having Celine
Dion, too, and the complete music of Madonna. From
the contemporary period, I am a big fan of John Mayer,
Dave Matthews Band, Bright Eyes and a whole bunch
of electronica/techno/trance (why do they bother to
name those songs?).
Lastly, I have many discs of music from Stanford's
choral and vocal groups. I just added a disc from Talis
man. And, of course, our version of "All Right Now—
the one that the USC Band, uh, copied.
