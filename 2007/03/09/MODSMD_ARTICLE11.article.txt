Senior American and North Ko
rean diplomats met in New York this
week to discuss normalizing rela
tions between the two countries for
the first time in history.
The talks between the Bush admin
istration and the regime of dictator
Kim Jong 11. which President Bush as
signed to the "axis of evil" in his first
term, represent a major shift in U.S. pol
icy - and come less than a month after a
tentative resolution to the nuclear pro
liferation crisis in the Asian Pacific.
As a result of the recent agree
ment. North Korea agreed to abandon
its nuclear weapons program but re
ceived guarantees from the West that
the government in Pyongyang would
be provided with energy subsidies and
that a series of bilateral talks between
the North and its main international
opponents would begin shortly.
ITiis week's meeting in New York,
which took place over two days, sig
nals the new approach in American
policy that has developed over the
course of the nuclear confrontation
â€” a policy of cautious engagement is
gaining ground over stonewalling
Kim. the previous tactic.
The top U.S. negotiator for the
North Korean issue, Christopher
Hill, described the talks on Tuesday
as "very good, very businesslike, very
comprehensive."
Apart from Pyongyang's nuclear
weapons program, the diplomats also
discussed taking North Korea off the
list of state sponsors of terror as well as
lifting some economic sanctions im
posed by the American government.
In contrast to the optimistic atti
tude with which the New York talks
concluded, the first bilateral meeting
between North Korea and Japan
ended in a bitter stalemate on Thurs
day. Japanese and North Korean offi
cials walked away from the negotiat
ing table in the Vietnamese capital of
Hanoi after a mere 45 minutes.
At issue was Japan's unresolved
fury over a series of kidnappings be
ginning in the 19705, in which North
Korean agents allegedly abducted

Japanese citizens from Japan and
brought them to North Korea.
Although efforts of former Japan
ese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
drew some concessions from the Kim
regime on the issue, it remains unre
solved and has only grown in contro
versy since the election of Koizumi's
conservative successor, Shinzo Abe.
Abe insisted that his government
would provide no aid whatsoever to
North Korea until Pyongyang satis
fied his conditions for settling the his
tory of the abductions once and for all.
The conservative government of
Abe recently provoked international
anger and outrage when the prime
minister endorsed a group of right
wing politicians who maintain that
imperial Japan did not conscript hun
dreds of thousands of women as sex
slaves during World War 11. Self-iden
tified victims of this policy from
China, Korea.Taiwan.the Philippines,
Indonesia and even the Netherlands
decried Abe's pledge to support the
right-wingers' drive to revise the his
tory of Japanese wartime atrocities.
North Korean diplomats also met
with officials from the South Korean

government in the first high-level bi
lateral talks since the Kim regime
tested a nuclear weapon last October.
The talks, which took place in the
North Korean capital, provided for
the resumption of several coopera
tive activities that were suspended in
the aftermath of the October test.
The two nations agreed to contin
ue allowing family reunions for Ko
reans living in separate states after
the catastrophic war of 1950 to 1953.
They also planned to move for
ward with proposals to build railway
lines to cross the border, linking the
two countries, and South Korea re
jected the North's requests for a full
restoration of aid.
In China this week. Parliament is
debating an unprecedented piece of
legislation that would ensure the
protection of private property under
the law. The measure would legalize
all individual property and assets:
nothing of its kind has ever been pro
posed in Communist China.
The law, originally proposed in


BECKY WRIGHT/The Stanford Daily
2(X)2, has been altered significantly
from its original form in response to
intense opposition.
Supporters of the law say that pro

viding a legal basis for property rights
will encourage entrepreneurial spirit,
bolstering the commercial success
that has been driving the manic
grow th of the Chinese economy.
If the law passes, however. Western
observers do not expect it to change
Beijing's policy of appropriating rural
lands for industrial or commercial pur
poses, which is one of the factors in

China's rural-to-urban flight and one
of the principal motivators of political
discontent among the Chinese people.
Also this week, the ruling Com
munist Party has taken an opportuni
ty to criticize the United States'
record on human rights, in a reversal
of traditional roles.
The U.S. government, which re
leased a report on human rights on

Tuesday, has long frustrated the Chi
nese leadership by highlighting Bei
jing's poor human rights record on
the international stage.
The new report by the Chinese
government, released on Thursday,
states, "as in previous years, the State
Department points the finger at
human rights conditions in more than
190 countries and regions, including
China, but avoided touching on the
human rights situation in the United
States." The document criticizes the
United States for violence in Iraq, for
the November 2005 massacre in 1 la
ditha and for prisoner abuses in Iraq
and Afghanistan. It also discusses vio
lent crime within the United States.
