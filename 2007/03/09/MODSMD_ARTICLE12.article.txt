## Editorial Board Energy Crossroads shows how it's done 
### 
Few issues are more insidious than the
ticking time-bomb that is America's
energy policy. The student organizers
of last week's Energy Crossroads confer
ence have done a great service by highlight
ing the need for a concerted interdiscipli
nary approach in devising a strategy to deal
with the energy problem. This refreshing
symposium was a strong indicator that some
students at Stanford, at least, really do get it.
Energy Crossroads was the brainchild of
Lyuba Wolf, a Stanford senior studying in
ternational relations who returned from a
quarter in Washington. D.C., irritated that
energy policy wasn't receiving the interdis
ciplinary focus it deserved. Wolf envisioned
a conference that would bring together top
leaders from across disciplines to confront
the challenges of providing a clean, prosper
ous and secure energy future. In under six
months. Wolf and a team of fellow Stanford
students turned that vision into a reality
The student-run, three-day symposium
was a smashing success. Participants from
industry, government and academia flocked
to campus last week to hear big-name
speakers like New York limes columnist
Thomas Friedman and Nobel Laureate

Steve Chu.The conference was profession
al. well-planned and well-attended. More
over. it provided ample opportunity for the
critical cross-pollination of ideas across sec
tors and disciplines.
The manner and rate at which we con
sume energy has far-reaching implications
for our security, economy and the health of
our entire planet. Reducing our dependence
on fossil fuels and eliminating greenhouse
gas emissions are perhaps the most pressing
challenges facing our generation. The conse
quences of failure — in the form of climate
change and otherwise — are too dire to
leave for future generations.
We commend Lyuba Wolf and the Ener
gy Crossroads organizing committee for tak
ing crucial first steps in making clean and se
cure energy a national priority. We also tip
our hats to Stanford University and the
many student groups and NGOs that provid
ed support and sponsorship to the Energy
Crossroads team and encourage the admin
istration and student groups to collaborate
on similar endeavors in the future. The
Crossroads organizers are a shining example
of what students can accomplish. They raise
the bar for student leadership at Stanford.
