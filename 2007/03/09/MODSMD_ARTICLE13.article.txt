# Controversy loves company
## 
### 
As any great white rapper knows,
where there's a little controversy,
there's a lot of money to be made —
and plenty of fame, if not infamy, to be
gained.
I'll be honest: I am more than a little jeal
ous of the online debate inspired by Darren
Franich's howling critique of the OSA (see
last week's "Ire and Vice" for full coverage
of the carnage — the bulk of which occurs
in the text following Darren's witty identifi
er). Most of my readers (my mom. my little
brother's friends, and. when I tell them
there's a direct reference to them, my
friends) rarely have the time or the inclina
tion to comment on my columns, and. even
when I manage to attract a few strangers,
none of my columns has instigated the type
of voluminous, heated feedback Darren
regularly receives.
Yes, I've gotten several memorable
emails and one adorable Facebook mes
sage/date request (which, given that it was
in response to "Smart, cute, and unavail
able," suddenly clarified how Carrie Brad
shaw gets so many men — if you write
about sex and/or dating, you're essentially
publishing one long personal ad).
But I'm not talking about valentines,
notes of appreciation, or marriage propos
als, though I'm sure Darren. Eminem and
their fellow controversy-lovers have gotten
a few of those. I'm talking about honest-to
goodness, incendiary, fist-pounding intellec
tual argument.The kind that starts riots and
sit-ins and hunger strikes, if not world wars
and policy changes.
However, this is not Berkeley and the
year is not 1969. No. we Stanford students of
the 21st century prefer the low-impact war
fare of anonymous online commentary, de
livered from behind the safety of the screen
and the pseudonym.
I am not excluding myself from this cri
tique. There's a reason why my columns gen
erally go down quietly; my skin is far too thin
to tolerate personal attacks, and my person
includes my writing,style and content.
Which is precisely why I'm tip-toeing in
to this week's column about the lack of sex
magazines on this campus.
That's right. Sex. Magazines. As in maga
zines that contain graphic depictions of
scantily-clad bodies and various not-so-sub
tle versions of the non-verbal intercourse
that occurs all over our 8180 acres. As in the
sticky-paged Playboys and Maxims lying in
most Row house bathrooms. Except, in this
case. I'm interested in the versions created
of the students, by the students and. obvi
ously. for the students.
If you prefer the aforementioned publi
cations to The New York Times, you proba
bly missed last Sunday's long, in-depth arti
cle on "Campus Exposure," in which the
high-brow periodical took an intellectual
walk on the scandalous side by investigating
university-produced porn. But unlike most
of The Times' collegiate "education" arti
cles, in which Stanford is mentioned along
side its Eastern counterparts, the Farm was
conspicuously absent.
Over the past decade or so, while we du
tifully attended classes and carefully select
ed our single piece of clothing for Exotic
Erotic, the provacateurs of Harvard's H-
Bomb and Columbia's Outlet, as well as
Yale's SWAY UChicago's Vita Excolatur.
and BlJ's unofficial Boink, shed their polo

shirts to get down and dirty with digital cam
eras. A few of the lucky (and entirely PCi)
ones even made it into The Times.
But we have Roxy Sass, you say. No. no,
the article said, there is a difference be
tween these magazines and the "common
sex columns — usually written by women
and often explicitly confessional — that
have popped up like little red-light districts
within the respectable black-and-white con
fines of established school newspapers."
That would be Roxy to a T (although, ever
cautious, we keep it anonymous here at The
Daily).
So what's the deal? If 23-year-old Alecia
Oleyourryk. a 2005 BU grad and the
founder of Boink. is correct, then sex is
"everywhere, and it's always been every
where for this generation. A body is a body
is a body, and I'm proud of my body, and
why not show my body? It's not going to
keep me from having a job... It's not. like.
The Scarlet Letter' anymore. It's a little
badge of honor."
Does this mean that we're a campus full
of Hester Prynnes and Arthur Dimmes
da!e: Yes we have a tradition wherein the
men vAim team runs across campus in
the:r Speedos and sneakers, and a handful
of brave souls have been known to bare all
under the year's first Full Moon. But 1 think
it's safe to say that, save for the bikini-clad
Clav, bathers and their tan-seeking friends,
we tend to keep our t-shirts on and our
OSA-funded activities squeaky-clean. If
we're too disruptive to study in the Law Li
brary. it's hard to imagine the powers that be
would agree to let us drop our drawers — in
indelible colored ink, no less — with a Uni
versity stamp of approval.
I"he next obvious question, given my
controversy aversion, is just how far I'm
willing to take this argument. Would I
"read" such a publication? Probably. Would
I write or pose for it? Hell, no. My parents
live in the Faculty Ghetto, within walking
distance of any conceivable distribution
point, and I don't want to know what my lit
tle brother's roommates would think. In
cluding those with whom I share DNA,
there are very few people on this campus
who have seen me thus exposed, and I in
tend to keep it that way. Unlike Alecia, I be
lieve in the powerful combination of future
employers and Internet search engines.
Old-fashioned as it may seem, I feel
rather exposed right now — and this is just
my writing. But at least I'm not alone. If Car
rie Bradshaw proved anything over the
course of her seven seasons, it's that the
power of the press extends into the bed
room. Particularly in light of my prior col
umn-as-personal-ad comment. I think I'll
stop here.
Talk amongst yourselves.
