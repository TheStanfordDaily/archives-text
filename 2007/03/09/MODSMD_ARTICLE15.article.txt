# Soft copy's not so hard
## 
### 
Recently, as I was driving down the
Row, I spotted one of my freshman
year dormmates sprinting past Sigma
Chi, clutching a crumpled stack of papers. His
hipster glasses were completely fogged from
the exertion, and, as 1 yelled out to ask him if
he needed a ride somewhere, he barely
looked back as he wheezed,
"Runnings...faster...Must...turn in...problem
set..."
I watched him disappear beyond the arch
es of Braun Music Center and pondered a
great injustice of the Stanford world: At a
school that flaunts its technological pedigree,
why in the hell are we still required to turn in
hard copies of assignments?
Most of us have been there. It's 9:47 a.m.
You have class in 13 minutes. Suddenly, your
printer announces that it is out of ink. You
rush through your dorm, trying to find some
one with a printer. When that inevitably fails,
you email yourself the assignment and go to
the computer cluster, praying that there is
money on your account to print.There isn't.
Ultimately,you bike to the LAlR,discov
er that the money-loading machine is bro
ken, bike to Meyer, load money on your ac
count, and finally print your assignment. At
10:12 a.m. you burst into your lecture class,
only to discover that papers will be collected

at the end. You spend the next 38 minutes
drawing angry, jagged doodles in your notes
and muttering that you could have slept an
extra 20 minutes if only you hadn't been
forced to turn in a hard copy of your paper.
But, it doesn't have to be this way! Dear
est professors and TAs, why are electronic
copies not the default mode of delivery? If
you are going to post our reading on Course
work. it seems only fair that you be willing to
receive as well as give.
I know some TAs claim that they "like to
write comments on papers, so a hard-copy is
essential." Aside from the bald lie that TAs
enjoy commenting on papers, a soft copy
does not prevent such a thing from occurring.
In Word, one can easily insert comments
electronically.
Could it be that technological ineptitude

is stopping Stanford from moving on to an
era of reason and convenience? In that case,
graders, take note:To insert a comment into a
document in Word, click on Insert. Go to
Comment. Click on it. Now you may com
ment on a paper. You can deduct points from
problem sets, share your insights, etc.
Electronic copies are win-win: Students
save paper, and professors could copy and
paste comments from other papers to save
time grading and get back to researching the
things that actually interest them. The only
downside that I see to this option is that com
ments cannot be disguised behind illegible
pencil scrapings, so graders would actually
have to type logical comments.
Some might call my argument one of lazi
ness. I think of it more as an argument of ef
ficiency. Electronic copies are more time effi
cient. as well as more energy efficient.
Think of all of the paper we would save if
standard protocol were to submit assign
ments electronically
Let's say,conservatively, that every under
grad at Stanford submits at least 20 pages of
material in a quarter. This figure includes
problem sets, research papers, I HUM essays,
etc. 7.(XX) multiplied by 20 is 140.0(H) sheets of

Bernstein
Sick Sad World
paper. That is equivalent to 6.720
pounds of trees, which is roughly the
same as clearing out the entire Papa
New Guinea garden during fall
quarter and decimating the redwood
grove by the Graduate School of
Business during winter quarter.
Let's not even start with ink and
toner, which can be harmful environ
mental hazards.
Some classes try to be environ
mentally progressive by asking for
students to submit papers printed on
both sides. My Introduction to I .n th
Systems class was one such offender.
Double-sided printing is its progres
sive as a doctor curing melancholia
by bloodletting one pint instead of
two. As a further annoyance, if a stu
dent chooses to print his paper dou
ble-sided in a cluster or library, he is

charged for the number of sides with
text, not for the number of pages
printed. So. an honors thesis will cost
five dollars, any way you slice it. ITiis
starts to add up when you are like my
friend who already has gone through
fourteen drafts.
It is almost embarrassing that I
have to write a column about soft
copies versus electronic copies.
Electronic copies are so clearly ad
vantageous over hard copies, that 1
really do not understand who still
needs convincing.They are more ef
ficient. They use fewer resources.
And they enable students to sleep in
an extra 20 minutes. Students of
Stanford, demand your right to an
extra 20 minutes of sleep. Demand
electronic submissions in your class
es.
