# Watch out for Hanuman
## 
### 
It is my understanding that my last column
caused quite the uproar within the under
graduate community Mayhem reigned in
White Plaza: A man was strung up on a bulls
eye and shot at by passersby, a Golden Bear
was slaughtered and, at least for a day, we
were all walking on eggshells (BTW, I found
the $100, but all 1 really wanted was some
junky plastic trinkets!).
For the all the ruckus I caused, I apologize.
I just didn't realize that the 78 percent of you
undergrads who were planning on eventual
ly attending law school would, after sipping
from my fount of knowledge, abandon the
endeavor en masse. It just didn't occur to me
that so many of you take my word as the
Gospel, that you see me as the next
Google/YouTlibe/e Bay/Hotornot.com (FYI,
I'm a 9.3). Well, I stand corrected.
But not to worry young'uns! There are
plenty of other amazingly awesome, aberrant
things you can do after graduation. Two op
tions off the top of my head:
1: Peace Corps.
All partial satire aside, serving in the
Peace Corps was the greatest thing I have
done with my life to date. I genuinely feel it is
an amazing thing to do for the world, Ameri
ca and yourself.
I'm willing to submit that global poverty
gives pause to each and every one of us at
least once in a while, our wondrous neo-clas
sical economic ideals notwithstanding.
Somehow the glories of free markets have
left large swathes of Asia, Africa and Latin
America in their dust, and the development
policies of institutions such as USAID and

the Worldßank have resulted in few of their
hoped-for benefits. I'm not saying that the
one thing that the developing world needs to
start on the right path is you, but a) extreme
global poverty is something that it would be
hoove us all to become engaged with, and b)
maybe, just maybe, the missing ingredients in
development efforts up until now have been
your glowing smile, unerring charisma and
boyish (and/or girlish) good looks.
As a Peace Corps volunteer, you'll also be
serving the good ol' U.S. of A. by engaging in
cultural exchange. Probably the best way to
dispel myths about life in America and
Americans themselves is through example.
The people in my village in El Salvador
found it harder to despise America and all
that it stood for after acknowledging that,
over the years, many courageous Americans
invested time and effort to help them live
better lives.
On the point of personal growth. I'd be
lying if I said that the Peace Corps was easy,
fun or always rewarding. PC's motto used to
be "The toughest job you'll ever love," but.
apparently, people were turned away by the
thought of doing anything "tough" (the cur

rent motto is "Life is Calling. How far will
you go?"). As much as I think the experience
is worthwhile and incredible, if you are
turned off by the idea of being challenged in
unexpected and daunting ways, then you
should probably focus on option 2 — the
Vishnu Internship Program (VIP) Pro
gramme, described below.
2: rhe Vishnu Internship Program (VIP)
Programme.
Interested in doing ill-defined and largely
inscrutable tasks at the beck and call of a to
talitarian. autocratic despot? Delighted by
the thought of waking up each morning un
sure of why exactly it is that you are wearing
a Hanuman costume in impromptu recre
ations of scenes from the Ramayana? Have
the blood of an aging ork warrior coursing
through your veins?
rhen the VIP Programme may be for you!
Just send me a three-to-12 word essay on one
(or fewer) of the following topics:
A. If you could get a pedicure from any
president,dead or alive,which would it be? (I
prefer alive, but feel free to choose other
wise.)
B. If an integer n is greater than 2, then
a A n + b A n =c A n has no solutions in non-zero
integers a, b, and c. Discuss.
C. How can we keep undergrads from bik
ing through the walkways near the Law
School?
