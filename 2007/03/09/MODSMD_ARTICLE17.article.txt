he few tidbits of wisdom (or just
-lain bad advice) that I have to give.
The 12-5 Theorem
The 12-5 Theorem is more than
ist a theorem: it is fact. Since the in
eption of the 64-team tournament in
985, a lowly 12 seed has managed to
lefeat a five seed every single year. In
act, this happened twice last year as
2 seeds Montana and Texas A&M
nth upset their respective five seed
natchups in the first round. It's
ather impossible to pick which 12
•ed is going to beat which five seed,
'lit 1 always find ;in upset in these
natch-ups to pick. Whatever you do

Diversify Your Portfolio
If you pick all the higher-ranked
eeds for each match-up, you'll find
ourself out of bracket contention in

iournament is just like creating a
lock portfolio: You need diversifica

iriderdogs and big horses to ride to
'racket immortality.
It's also important not to put all
