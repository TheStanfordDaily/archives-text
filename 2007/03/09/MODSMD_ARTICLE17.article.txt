The 12-5 Theorem
The 12-5 Theorem is more than
ist a theorem: it is fact. Since the in
eption of the 64-team tournament in
985, a lowly 12 seed has managed to
lefeat a five seed every single year. In
act, this happened twice last year as
2 seeds Montana and Texas A&M
nth upset their respective five seed
natchups in the first round. It's
ather impossible to pick which 12
•ed is going to beat which five seed,
'lit 1 always find ;in upset in these
natch-ups to pick. Whatever you do
ii picking your brackets, don't ignore
lie 12-5 Theorem. Trust me on this
me.
Diversify Your Portfolio
If you pick all the higher-ranked
eeds for each match-up, you'll find
ourself out of bracket contention in
0 time.You see,choosing an NCAA
iournament is just like creating a
lock portfolio: You need diversifica
ion. Don't choose all underdogs or
II favorites;rather.find a good mix of
iriderdogs and big horses to ride to
'racket immortality.
It's also important not to put all
<>ur eggs in one basket. In the brack

them. You don't have to look any far
ther than last season to see the truth
of my opening statement: Not a sin
gle one seed actually made the Final
Four.

Final l our was UCLA, a team lucky
to get a two seed at the time. If your
Final l our includes Ohio State.

rently predicted one seeds, according
to"bracketologist"Joe Lunardi).you

may want to change it up a hit. It's
probably not going to happen.
I"he Slipper Always Fits
The real trouble is finding out who
that Cinderella is. Every year, some
school you've never heard of makes
headlines with a run to the Sweet Six
teen or the Elite Eight. And every
once in a while, the slipper fits so well
that they make it all the way to the
Final Four (1 iello. George Mason!).
Cinderellas often come from the
mid-major conferences (the WCC,
MAC or MVC) with names like no
longer-Cinderella Gonzaga. Wichita
State and Creighton coming to mind.
Even then, though, there's always a
team from one of the bottom-rung
conferences who makes some noise.

Watch out for Winthropof the South
ern Conference this year to make a
magical run.
Go with Your Gut
When it comes down to it. pick the
teams who give you that certain
"feeling." I'm sure plenty of gurus
"knew" that Florida was bound to
take the national title — after the
Gators actually won. of course.
Sure, the "feeling" you get is prob
ably just bogus and a figment of your
imagination, but it's always cool to
tell all your friends that you have
extra-sensory perception in the
realm of sports after your gut predic
tion rings true. As for me, I have
prophetic sports dreams.
It Never I lurts to Be Lucky

In the end, it's going to take a lot
of luck to win any pool with a signifi
cant number of participants. It often
seems as though the winner of the of
fice pool knows the least about bas
ketball; he either picked the team
based on whether or not he liked the
mascot or on some method involving
horoscopes. In any case, luck plays a
significant role.
Bracketology 101 has concluded
for today. Your only assignment is to
sit back and enjoy the Madness.

first tenured prpfessor in "bracketol
