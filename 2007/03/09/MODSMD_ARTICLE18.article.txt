Stranding baserunners was a big problem for the
Cardinal against Santa Clara on Tuesday, as Stanford
left a season-high 14 on the basepaths. The Cardinal
also had a rough night defensively with two errors re
sulting in two unearned runs for the Broncos while
Stanford's pitching walked 10 and hit three. As head
coach Mark Marquess explained, the Broncos beat
the Cardinal at its own game by making the most of
their opportunities.
"If you play like we played [ Tuesday] night, there
won't be anybody on our schedule that we'll beat."
the 29-year Stanford coach said."You can't just walk
10 and hit three and leave 14 guys on base — you're
not going to beat many people if you do that. Now,
Santa Clara did what we've been doing. They had

GAME NOTES: Stanford's eight-game winning
streak ended Tuesday night against Santa Clara in
a rout, as the Cardinal stranded 14 runners on the
basepaths, walked 10 and hit three Santa Clara
batters. USC comes into the non-conference se

four in a row and six of their last seven before the
Trojans were unable to muster any offense against
UC-Riverside in a 4-1 loss.

Cardinal will look to bounce back against USC after falling 13-5 against Santa Clara on Tuesday.
