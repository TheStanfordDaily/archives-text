## Men's swimming and diving coach admits removing former athletes' records from media guides, athletic director promises' appropriate corrective and punitive steps' 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mens swimming head coach Skip Ken
ney intentionally removed the times of five
swimmers from the team's media-guide
record books, the University confirmed yes
terday, following an investigation by The
Daily. Several of the swimmers expressed in
interviews their belief that the omissions
were purposeful and vindictive — an effort
to get back at swimmers who left the pro
gram on bad terms.
In an interview with The Daily yesterday
morning, Kenney denied any bad blood
with former swimmers and maintained that

the omission was an honest mistake. By the
afternoon, however, the coach had changed
his tone,and the University released a state
ment by Kenney in which the coach apolo
gized for "a serious mistake in judgment on
[his] part."
"To exclude these five student-athletes
from our media guide was an error, and it
will he corrected immediately," Kenney stat
ed. "I apologize for my actions in this mat
ter."
Athletic Director Boh Bowlsby told The
Daily he had first spoken with Kenney
about the issue Wednesday night.
"I think it's just a mix-up somehow,"
Kenney said by phone the next morning. "1

don't want to guess as to why."
"I don't believe they were accidental or a
mix-up," Bowlsby later said. "It was a very
had piece of judgment."
"It is a matter of maintaining the integri
ty of the University's record," he added.
"That's something that all of us have respon
sibility for."
Bowlsby also released an official state
ment yesterday, in whieh the athletic direc
tor denounced the omissions as "unaccept
able" and said the University "will immedi
ately restore our records to accurately re
flect the history of our men's swimming pro
gram."
"We will follow up with Coach
Kenney," he said, "and take appropri
ate corrective and punitive steps after
the NCAA Championship meet."
A PATTERN
A careful examination of the
records shows that the missing times
were not randomly omitted. Each
swimmer whose name was missing
from the guide had his times removed
from several different events, meets
and years.
The times of Jason Plummer '92.
Rickey Eddy '06. Michael McLean
*06, Tobias Oriwol "06 and Peter
Carothers '08 disappeared from the
2007 media guide's list of Stanford's
all-time top-15 performances. While
the times all appeared in the 2(X)6 edi
tion of the media guide, they were also
stricken from the top times list on the
official Stanford Athletics Web site
(http://www.gostanford.com).
Two of McLean's times were also
omitted from the 2007 guide's Pacific
-10 Conference and NCAA Champi
onship results from 2006. but remain
in athletic department press releases
of the results from last spring. Finally,
the names of McLean and Carothers
do not appear in a graphic featuring
the 12 other Stanford swimmers who
received 2005-2006 Pac-10 All-Acad
emic honors, despite text on the fol
lowing page that states "14 were hon
ored."
The Pac-10 confirmed that
McLean and Carothers continue to
hold their All-Academic records.
THE HISTORY
In terms of results, Kenney's
record is hard to dispute. Last month,
the men's swimming and diving team
took home its 26th straight Pac-10
conference title, and 19 swimmers will
represent the second-ranked Cardinal
at the NCAA Championships, which
start on Thursday.
Outside the pool, however, some
former swimmers discussed a string of

mistreatments, culminating, they said,
in the removal of their times from the
media guide. McLean filed an
NCAA violation in August 2(K)5 when
Kenney left him off a preseason trip
after McLean took a summer intern
ship instead of training with the team
daily in the offseason. Since then, he
said, the once cordial relationship be
tween coach and player soured.
"We had a discussion in front of the
team," McLean said. "It fell apart after
that."
Carothers and another swimmer
were let go from the team last year
after the two were found drinking dur
ing the season. Carothers protested,
and was not allowed to return. ITie
other swimmer did not protest, how
ever. and was eventually reinstated.
Plummer — who graduated more
than a decade ago — is an outlier of
the group. Speaking by phone from
Brisbane, Australia, he told The Daily
that he first noticed his times disap
pearing from the record books in the
mid-19905.
" I thought it was a typo, but it never
seemed to be fixed." he said. "I always
assumed it was because Skip didn't
like me."
Plummer said the animosity be
tween himself and Kenney began
after he suffered a shoulder injury
during his junior season in 1991.
"He basically just threw me off the
team," he said.
Kenney has coached the Stanford
men's swimming team since 1979. a
run that has included seven NCAA ti
tles as well as the conference-record
26 Pac-10 championships. 1 le coached
the United States men's Olympic
swimming team at the 1996 Atlanta
games, in which American male swim
mers won 15 gold medals.
Also in 1996, Kenney was named
in a sexual harassment suit by a for
mer temporary employee of the Uni
versity. iiie lawsuit, in which the plan
tiff asked for damages of more than
$25.(MX). was settled out of court.
The coach's aggressive style, inher
ited from his time as a sniper for the
U.S. Marine Corps in the Vietnam
War, is marketed to recruits as a pow
erful and successful motivational tool.
Many swimmers on the team revere
Kenney, who has recently received

positive press from The San Francisco
Chronicle and the Stanford Magazine.
Saying that his current and former
swimmers would "lie down in traffic
for him," Adam Messner '01 told the
Stanford Magazine for its
January/February issue that "no one
can read his athletes like Skip can."
But the same style comes across as
abrasive to some of his swimmers.
"You either loved Skip or you
hated Skip; there was really no middle
ground," Plummer said. "He's a real
polarizing force."
Kenney was also known to hold a
grudge, and the swimmers whose
names were removed said in inter
views that they were not surprised to
find their names scratched from the
record books.
"This was obviously vindictive,"
said one former swimmer, who asked
to remain anonymous because he still
has ties to the University.
McLean, now an investment
banker based in San Francisco, said he
found the omission "disappointing."
"The records are something you
assume only change when they get
broken," McLean said. "Stanford's all
about tradition, building off of the
past."
In his interview yesterday morning,
Kenney appeared to echo McLean's
comments.
"Tradition is extremely important,
it's like a family," he said. "It's not
about me anyway. It's about the team.

It's never a personal thing."
TRUST THE GUIDE
Media guides are more than just
the purview of journalists. They are
handed out to swimmers' families,
alumni and recruits,according to Gary
Migdol, senior assistant athletic direc
tor for media relations.This year, how
ever. sources close to the swim team
said that Kenney wanted to distribute
the guides only to current swimmers,
media and select alumni.
But the University maintains the
guides as the public face of the pro
gram and said there is no reason to dis
seminate incorrect information.
"We're in the business of providing
accurate data on our teams," Migdol
said.
Before leaving Stanford earlier
this year to take a similar post at Cal
State-Northridge, Bob Vasquez
served as media relations director for
men's swimming and diving. In an in
terview with The Daily last week,
Vasquez said changes to the media
guide are made solely at the coach's
discretion.
"Those are the times that he [Ken
ney] wanted in the media guide this
year," Vasquez said."l'm not one to re
ally ask him why."
Vasquez said his former depart
ment usually approved changes to the
guides made by coaches, for financial
reasons. The media guides are funded
through the budget of each respective

sport, not from the sports information
office.
"Whatever they want in the media
guide we sort of approve," Vasquez
said. "We offer our feedback, hut the
bottom line is that the buck stops with
the coach."
While Vasquez initially said he did
not remember changing specific
times, Bowlsby was quick to condemn
his former employee for perpetuating
the "intentional omissions" at Ken
ney's direction.
"Both are equally responsible for a
tremendous mistake in judgment,"
Bowlsby said in his statement.
FOR THE RECORD
According to Bowlsby, the Univer
sity's media relations office will com
plete a thorough review of swimming
records and past media guides. The
missing times, he said, will return to
their rightful places.
The corrective and punitive steps
made against the coach, he added,
would likely be kept confidential.
A few of the swimmers expressed
happiness upon hearing that their
records would return to the books, but
they worried that nothing will change.
Plummer, for his part, took the
high road.
"The guy's never liked me," he
said. "That's fine. 1 hold no grudge."
