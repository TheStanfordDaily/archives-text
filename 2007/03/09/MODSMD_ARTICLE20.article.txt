# Fencing ready for Regionals
## 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford fencing is gearing up to
take part in the Western Regionals
this Sunday in La Jolla, Calif., in a
crucial event that will showcase
fencers en route to the NCAA
Championships in Madison. New
Jersey. With a number of talented
fencers hoping to earn All-American
honors, the Cardinal has an excellent
chance to be well-represented at the
Championships starting on Mar. 22.
First, though, the Cardinal needs
to tackle the competition at the
Western Regionals, including Cal
State-Fullerton, CIT, UC-San Diego
and Air Force. Stanford got a good
look it the competition on Feb. 3 at
tho Western Invitational.as Stanford
easily dispatched CIT and Cal State-
Fullerton. But UC-San Diego and
Air Force proved more than compe
tent adversaries, as the Cardinal de
feated the two schools by just a sin
gle point in each match.
Although Stanford is looking to
dispatch the competition and claim
the team title at Regionals, the event
is more important on an individual
level. Stanford co-head coach Lisa
Milgram pointed out the daunting
odds facing every one of her athletes.
"Between all those schools, only
12 people can qualify to NCAA
Championships," Milgram said.
"This makes it very hard to qualify
out of approximately 90 people."
Sophomore standout sabreist
Eva Jellinson echoed her coach's
sentiments.
" Ibe format of Western Region
als is entirely individual, so 1 think
right now most of us are wondering
how we are going to handle our own
teammates, as well as the talented
fencers from other schools."

With fabulous freshmen Phil
Arredondo. Sarah Parker and Jessi
ca Wacker complementing the expe
rienced leadership of senior I leather
Backman and junior Richard Ful
ton, the team is brimming with confi
dence.
Ihe Cardinal core consists of an
outstanding sophomore class, many
of whom fenced brilliantly as fresh
men last year and have made strides
this season as well. Sophomores
Brittany Leader, Dan Tucker. Clay
ton Kenney and Teddy Levit. along
with Jellinson, will all have a shot at
competing in the NCAA Champi
onships.
"I'm optimistic for the team, hop
ing we can get at least a squad of six."
Jellinson said. "Anyone can win on
any given day."
Coach Milgram acknowledges
that the competition has stiffened this
year but still has plenty of conviction
in her team's sky-high potential.
"We have a young team and the
region has become stronger this
year," Milgram said. "But I think if
everyone fences their best, we will
win the Western Regionals,as well as
qualify many who have a shot to be
All-Americans."
