GAME NOTES; Stanford is set to host their sec
ond home tournament this season as the Stan
ford Classic opens today, and first up for the
Cardinal is a matchup with UCSB. The Gau
chos boast a stellar trio of pitchers in Jennifer
Davis (0.78 ERA), Lindsey Correa (4 1, 1.70
ERA) and Melinda Matsumoto, who is a per
fect 6-0 on the season. Stanford's offense,
though, is not short on weapons, with six regu
lar starters batting above .300, led by Jackie
Rinehart's and Alissa Haber's identical .362
average
sistent in all throe of those areas. ITiis
week's competition is going to he

we'll he ready to go."

9). San Diego State (11-8) and Loy
ola Chicago (1-5) at the Classic, and
while the Cardinal would appear to
be the clear-cut favorite on paper,
the Gauchos, boasting an impressive
trio of pitchers, have proved to be a
handful in the past, upsetting No. 4
Arizona State 8-7 last Friday.
The Cardinal's staff ace, sopho
more Missy Penna, boasts some im
pressive numbers of her own, lead
ing the Pacific-10 Conference with
11 wins, 82.1 innings pitched and a
.114 opposing batting average.
Given how often Stanford has relied
on Penna's arm this season, her per
formance will play a large role in dic
tating the outcome of the tourna
ment. Penna struggled in Fullerton,
going 1-1 with a 3.90 LRA over 14.1
innings.
"I think Missy is developing nice
ly." Rittman said. "You're going to
have bad games over the course of a
long season, but she's been real con
sistent for us this year, and I look for
her to bounce back this weekend
and have a good tournament."
Despite the difficulties her team

mates encountered in l ullerton.jun
ior corner infielder Michelle Smith
thrived at the Worth Classic, belting
three home runs in the first four
games of the tournament, including
one walk-off shot against Texas
Tech.
"Michelle's always had power,
she's always hit for average and she's
one of the hardest workers on the
team," Rittman said. "So yeah, we
expect a lot from Michelle and it was
nice to see her get hot last weekend."
Rittman is looking for an all
around effort from his team at home
this weekend.
"I think the biggest thing for us is
our pitching has to keep us in
games," Rittman said. "Defensively,
we can't afford to give away outs and
offensively we have to do a better
job of being consistent and putting
our hits together."
The Cardinal is 16-4 all time in
the Stanford Classic and swept the
competition last year. This week
end's action will begin for Stanford
against IJCSB at 2 p.m. on Friday,
followed by a 4 p.m. matchup against
Sacramento State. All games will be
played at the Boyd & Jill Smith Fam
ilv Stadium.
