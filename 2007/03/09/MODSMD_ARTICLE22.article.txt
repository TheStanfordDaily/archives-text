GAMf NOTES: The No. 36 Cardinal fell behind
early against the Seminoles as Stanford lost in
doubles for the first time in five matches. Stan
ford's No. 66 Richard Wire was the only Cardi
nal athlete to win his first set in singles competi
tion, as Stanford fell even farther behind the
Seminoles. The loss marked the Cardinal's third
shutout defeat of the season, after not losing a
single match by shutout in 2006.

senior Eric McKean and sophomore Jeff Zeller dropped an 8-5 de
cision at the third doubles position.
Hie initial point of the match came down to No. 2 doubles, where
freshmen Paul Morrisscy and Richard Wire were caught in a tight
contest against FSI J s Sam Chang and Jonathas Sucupira. Wire had
the opportunity to serve out the match at 7-6, but the Seminoles ral
lied back and ultimately claimed the set,9-7.and the doubles point.
"They weren't going to go down easily, and they sure didn't."
head coach John Whitlinger said. "They made us work verv hard.
and we just didn't come up with the
points and shots when we needed to.
Everybody knows how important the
doubles point is, and they stepped up."
With momentum in their favor, the
Seminoles wasted no time getting off
to a dominant start in singles. FSU
quickly picked up five of the six first
sets, and in three of those sets, the
Seminoles only allowed their Cardi
nal counterparts one game apiece.
No. 66 Wire was the lone Stanford
player to earn a first set. Despite being
down 2-4 in the opening set. Wire
picked up a break and then held to
even the score at 4—all. On Ytai

Abougzir's serve, the Stanford fresh
man had a triple break point, but only
needed one of those opportunities to
go up 5-4. Wire then served out the set
as the only Cardinal player to earn a
first set.
"If you look at the board, besides
Rich, we got beat up pretty good in the
lirst sets of singles." Whitlinger said.
"It's a big boost when you win the
doubles point on the road. 1 think [the
first point| would have helped us as
well, with a little momentum going
into singles. But I've got to give it to
Florida State, they did a great job.
They got [the first point], and they ran
with it."
Stanford began to get into a
rhythm and started to play tighter sec
ond sets. But by then. Florida State
was already off and running. Boosted
by a small yet raucous fan base, the

Seminoles promptly scored matches
at the bottom of the lineup to secure
the win.

Never one to go down without a
fight.captain Mckean battled back to
stretch his opponent to a third set at
No. 3 singles. Because the match out
come had already been determined
by the start of the third set, a super

tiebreaker was played in lieu of a final
set. Mckean never quite found his
rhythm and lost the breaker 10-3.
Down 0-6, Stanford looked to
Wire to put one win on the board.
After winning the first set. the fresh
man dropped the second, but led 5-2
in the final set Wire couldn't quite
close it out, and Abougzir won five
consecutive games to seal FSU's per
fect sweep.
"| Wire led| 5-2. and after that had
happened, Abougzii played very
solid tennis." Whitlinger said. "1 don't
think he made many unforced errors
from that point on. and he was going
to make Rich beat him. 1 have to give
[Abougzir] credit for really settling
down I le didn't have anything to play
for at that time. [FSU had) won the
match — he could have packed it in
very easily, but he didn't. He really

stepped it up. made a lot of shots and
made Rieh play."
