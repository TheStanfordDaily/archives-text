nal meets No. 12 Long Beach State and unranked
UC'-San Diego for a second time this season.
Both opponents will bring young teams to the
court, with 10 freshmen for UCSD and three non
redshirt freshmen for Long Beach compared to
Stanford's total of five first-year players.
" ITie team enjoyed the win against Quincy,"
head coach John Kosty said. "They will take that
feeling and walk into gym this weekend with
more confidence. We are excited about the
matches this weekend because we have the op
portunity to compete and hopefully beat two
great teams."
Last week, the Cardinal (2-17.1-13 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) went down fighting in
a three-game sweep against No. 9 Pacific (30-23,

with 23 digs and 10 block assists. The non-conference
match left Stanford 2-1 7 overall, 1 -13 in the MPSF. Despite
the challenge of No. 12 Long Beach, the Cardinal has an
other opportunity for a conference win over UC-San Diego,
against whom they previously won 30-26, 30-27, 19-30,
26-30, 15-11 on Feb. 3.

Simon Chen-Byerley also chimed in on the stat
sheet, hitting .583.
Last Saturday.the Cardinal attacked its way to
a three-game sweep of Quincy (30-22.30-23,30-
22). Stanford dominated the court with an overall
hitting percentage of .326 to. 135. Freshman Evan
Romero led the team with 17 kills while Shoji
scored 10. Groppi helped direct the Cardinal with
37 assists, and senior Brian Lindherg led the team
defensively with 11 digs. Stanford had its steadiest
and most consistent play of the season, doing well
in both offense and defense throughout the night.
Long Beach State (7-9.4-N MPSF) endured a
long weekend last week, battling to five games at
home in both of its matches against UCLA and
UC-Irvine. The 49ers fought right up to the last
minute against the Bruins with a game five hitting
percentage of .611 to finally overcome a brutal
UCLA defense. The 49ers' Dean Bittner led the
team offensively with 21 kills at .432 for the night.

In a five-game struggle against Irvine, the 4 l )ers
lost and simply could not close out the match
against the Anteaters. On the positive side, the
49ers had 17 aces in the match, one short of an all
time MPSF record.
The last time the Cardinal met the 49ers was
early in the season on Feb. 2.; the 49ers swept the
Cardinal in three games due to poor offense.
Some key players to look for from Long Beach
State are sophomore Dustin Watten, who ranks
second in digs (2.4 1 ) per game) in the MPSF. and
junior Paul Lotman, who ranks third in aces and
fourth in kills (4.40 kpg).
"Long Beach is a good team who brings great
defense to the court," kosty said. "However, they
do have some young players like we do. We need
to take care of our side of the net and good things

will happen."
UC-San Diego (5-12,2-10 MPSF)
was on the road last week, enduring
play from two tough schools and
falling in three to both UC-lrvine
and UCLA. The Tritons have been
encountering trouble on the offen
sive side, struggling to compete with
some of the top schools in southern
California last week. In their match
versus Irvine, the Tritons could only
muster a .027 hitting average versus
an Anteater .43') UCSD had the
same offensive struggles in its match
against UCLA and was out-hit and
out-dug. In Wednesday's match
against Lewis, the Tritons fell just
short of victory, pushing the match
with Lewis to five games. The Triton
freshmen performed well, getting a
cumulative 63 kills: 22 from Jason
Spangler, 21 from Frank Fritsch and
20 from Will Ehrman on the night.
In the Cardinal's last meeting
with the Tritons. Stanford battled
UCSD down to the wire, earning its
first victorv of the season.The Cardi

nal won the fir it two games early, but
the Tritons responded by winning
the next two games, heightening the
tension going into the final game.
Stanford finally closed out the last
game for the win (30-26,30-27,19-30,
26-30,15-11). Many Stanford volley
ball players had their best nights of
the season, with junior Matt Ceran
earning 21 kills (.340), Williams
notching 18 kills (.500) and Romero
racking up 14 kills. Shoji had a sea
son-high 61 assists. One player to
watch in the match against UCSD
will be the Tritons' sophomore Eric
Leserman, No. 1 in the MPSF for
digs, averaging 3.07 per game.
"The match against UCSD will
be a battle between two youngest
teams in the league," Kosty said.
"They played tough last time we
met, but we were able to beat them
in five. Since a few months have
passed since last time we played
them, they are a better team and we
are a better team, which will make
this weekend's match even more
competitive. I look forward to both
matches and look for good things
out of my team."
