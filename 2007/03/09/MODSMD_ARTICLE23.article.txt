matches this weekend because we have the op
portunity to compete and hopefully beat two
great teams."

GAME NOTES; Stanford won its second game of the season
against Quincy, 30-22, 30-23, 30-22. The team hit .326,
with 23 digs and 10 block assists. The non-conference
match left Stanford 2-1 7 overall, 1 -13 in the MPSF. Despite
the challenge of No. 12 Long Beach, the Cardinal has an
other opportunity for a conference win over UC-San Diego,
against whom they previously won 30-26, 30-27, 19-30,
26-30, 15-11 on Feb. 3.

Simon Chen-Byerley also chimed in on the stat
sheet, hitting .583.
Last Saturday.the Cardinal attacked its way to
a three-game sweep of Quincy (30-22.30-23,30-
22). Stanford dominated the court with an overall
hitting percentage of .326 to. 135. Freshman Evan
Romero led the team with 17 kills while Shoji
scored 10. Groppi helped direct the Cardinal with
37 assists, and senior Brian Lindherg led the team
defensively with 11 digs. Stanford had its steadiest
and most consistent play of the season, doing well
in both offense and defense throughout the night.
Long Beach State (7-9.4-N MPSF) endured a
long weekend last week, battling to five games at
home in both of its matches against UCLA and
UC-Irvine. The 49ers fought right up to the last
minute against the Bruins with a game five hitting
percentage of .611 to finally overcome a brutal
UCLA defense. The 49ers' Dean Bittner led the
team offensively with 21 kills at .432 for the night.

In a five-game struggle against Irvine, the 4 l )ers
lost and simply could not close out the match
against the Anteaters. On the positive side, the
49ers had 17 aces in the match, one short of an all
time MPSF record.
The last time the Cardinal met the 49ers was
early in the season on Feb. 2.; the 49ers swept the
Cardinal in three games due to poor offense.
Some key players to look for from Long Beach
State are sophomore Dustin Watten, who ranks
second in digs (2.4 1 ) per game) in the MPSF. and
junior Paul Lotman, who ranks third in aces and
fourth in kills (4.40 kpg).
"Long Beach is a good team who brings great
defense to the court," kosty said. "However, they
do have some young players like we do. We need
to take care of our side of the net and good things
