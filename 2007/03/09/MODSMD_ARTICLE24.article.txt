# Sooners, Card, set to tumble
## 
### JENNIFER O'NEIL 
The No. 3 Stanford women's gymnastics team will
be tumbling back into action at Burnham Pavilion this
Friday at 7:30 p.m. against No.Oklahoma as it looks
to bounce back from a rare loss at Nebraska on Feb.
25.
The Cardinal women have ranked in the top three
during the last four weeks of competition and are un
defeated in the Pacific-10 Conference. Stanford com
petes in just four home competitions all season, mak
ing this the last opportunity for many Stanford stu
dents to witness the team in action â€” the Cardinal
will host its final home meet of the season during
spring break.

According to head coach Kristen Smyth, the key to
Friday's meet will be to maintain the consistency that
has been Stanford's hallmark all season.
"We came out really strong at the beginning with
Georgia and have stayed relatively steady through the
bulk of the season," Smyth said. "On Friday, we are
looking to regain that competitive fire and love-to
compete attitude."
The Sooners have had their best season since 2(K)():
Oklahoma brings an 11-1 record into the meet. But
the Cardinal is looking forward to a challenge. For
junior Stephanie Gentry, the event also offers an op
portunity to compete against former teammates.
