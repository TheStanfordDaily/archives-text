# Sooners, Card, set to tumble
## 
### JENNIFER O'NEIL 
The No. 3 Stanford women's gymnastics team will
be tumbling back into action at Burnham Pavilion this
Friday at 7:30 p.m. against No.Oklahoma as it looks
to bounce back from a rare loss at Nebraska on Feb.
25.
The Cardinal women have ranked in the top three
during the last four weeks of competition and are un
defeated in the Pacific-10 Conference. Stanford com
petes in just four home competitions all season, mak
ing this the last opportunity for many Stanford stu
dents to witness the team in action â€” the Cardinal
will host its final home meet of the season during
spring break.

According to head coach Kristen Smyth, the key to
Friday's meet will be to maintain the consistency that
has been Stanford's hallmark all season.
"We came out really strong at the beginning with
Georgia and have stayed relatively steady through the
bulk of the season," Smyth said. "On Friday, we are
looking to regain that competitive fire and love-to
compete attitude."
The Sooners have had their best season since 2(K)():
Oklahoma brings an 11-1 record into the meet. But
the Cardinal is looking forward to a challenge. For
junior Stephanie Gentry, the event also offers an op
portunity to compete against former teammates.

GAME NOTESi The No. 3 Cardinal looks to bounce
back after dropping their last meet at Nebraska. In
individual events, the Cardinal ranks No. 11 on
vault, No. 3 on beam, No. 3 on bars and No. 5
on floor. Individually, freshman Carly Janiga is
ranked No. 3 on bars and No. 4 in the Ail-Around.
"1 trained with some of the girls
for seven years," she said. "So it will
he great to see their progress and
catch up."
Stanford's theme for this meet is
"Take what is ours!" as the Cardinal
looks to bounce back from its disap
pointing beam rotation against the
Cornhuskers two weeks ago.
"The girls did a great job fighting,
but we need to start believing and
having more confidence in our abili
ties." Smyth said.
The gymnasts are planning to
come out strong to start the compe
tition on the balance beam and keep
the momentum going throughout
the meet. The beam lineup will he
identical to the one that competed in
Lincoln. Neb., with an exhibition
performance added in by freshman
Stephanie Carter.
Junior Lauren Elmore debuted
her floor routine at Nebraska and is
looking forward to having the op
portunity to perform in front of a
home crowd.
"She is a strong performer in
three events and gives the team con
fidence." Smyth said. "She is
really a leader on the team."
Juniors Tabitha Vim and LizTric
ase are team co-captains, hut leader
ship is something Smyth expects
every gymnast to bring to the table.
"You know you have a great team
when everyone, including all the
freshmen, step up and contribute,"
Smyth said.
One such freshman is ('arlv Jani

ga. who will compete this Friday
holding the third-place spot on bars
and the fourth position in the all
around national rankings. The Car
dinal has gained renown for its abili
ty as a team on the uneven parallel
bars.
" Bars is a pillar for the team this
year," Smyth said. "It is really our
time to shine."
The Cardinal women enjoy the
spotlight on bars but are really aim
ing at a goal that they set for them
selves each and every meet: to hit all
24 routines with six girls competing
in each event.
"Our fans at home really moti
vate us to achieve our goal," junior
Aimee Precourt said. "We especially
love the enthusiasm and dedication
that the 24 Club brings to the meet."
'Ihe C 'ardinal is also aiming to im
prove its Regional qualifying score
this weekend, which is currently at
197.275.
"We have off next weekend, so
we really need to secure our spot in
the rankings this Friday," Precourt
said.
Consistency and confidence in
hitting all 24 routines will certainl\
be the gymnast's focus on Friday,
and they expect it to be an exciting
meet in front of a home crowd.
"The intimate, friendly setting
of Burnham full of family and
friends cannot be compared." Yim
said. "We love the support and en
thusiasm that our fans at home
bring to the competition. We
haven't lost at home all year, and
we'd really love to get all the sup
port we can get."
