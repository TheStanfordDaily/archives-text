## Stolen Cal Nobel Prize is recovered 
### 
The axe is safe, but an even
more valuable object went missing
from a UC-Berkeley display case:
its first Nobel Prize.
Local media went into a frenzy
this week over the item, which is
valued at over $4,000. Wednesday,
the item was recovered â€” induc
ing a sigh of relief in those who
may have suspected the Stanford-
Cal rivalry played a role in the
theft.
Campus police arrested Cal
senior lan Michael Sanchez, who
told police he took the medal on "a
whim."
"We are thrilled, we are so re
lieved that it's back. It's so much a
part of our heritage." Linda
Schneider of Berkeley's Lawrence
Hall of Science told CBS News.
Physicist Ernest O. Lawrence
received the award in 1939 for his
invention of the cyclotron. The
Nobel was the first ever for a pub
lic university and was housed in a
case in the Lawrence Hall of Sci
ence.
