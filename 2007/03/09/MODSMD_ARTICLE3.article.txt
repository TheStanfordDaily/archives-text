## Journalist delves into Iraq debate New York Times' Shanker evaluates troop surge 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thom Shanker, Pentagon and foreign
policy;, correspondent for The New York
Times, spoke about the Iraq war and the fu
ture of the American military presence in
the Middle East during a speech in Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge last night.
As the violence in Iraq has continued to
grab the nation's attention, Shanker spoke
about perspectives within Washington on
the recent surge of troops.

"The idea behind the surge," he said, "is
just to buy time and space for the current
Iraqi government to get going and establish
its authority."
Shanker's talk — "The Wars on Three
Fronts: Iraq, the Pentagon and Main Street"
— was the Center for International Security
and Cooperation (CISAC) annual Drell lec
ture.
According to Shanker, senior advisors in
the armed forces are becoming increasingly
worried about the risks associated with the
surge.These advisors, Shanker said, are wor
ried that the politics, violence and civil un
rest in the region will force Ameri
can military forces to retreat before stability
is achieved.
"The military is optimistic about the

surge and the officers
have hope." he said.
"At the same time,
when 1 talk to the real
thinkers in the mili
tary, they are asking

the question of what will happen if the
American military and, therefore, American
policy is forced out."
Shanker said he emailed high-ranking
American military officials who have served
in Iraq. Reading from one response, he said:
"The American military cannot win the war
in Iraq. The American military cannot win
the war in Afghanistan. Not only can the
militaries not win the wars, they will not win
