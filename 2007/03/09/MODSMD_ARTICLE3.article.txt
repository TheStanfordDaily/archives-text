## Journalist delves into Iraq debate New York Times' Shanker evaluates troop surge 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thom Shanker, Pentagon and foreign
policy;, correspondent for The New York
Times, spoke about the Iraq war and the fu
ture of the American military presence in
the Middle East during a speech in Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge last night.
As the violence in Iraq has continued to
grab the nation's attention, Shanker spoke
about perspectives within Washington on
the recent surge of troops.

"The idea behind the surge," he said, "is
just to buy time and space for the current
Iraqi government to get going and establish
its authority."
Shanker's talk — "The Wars on Three
Fronts: Iraq, the Pentagon and Main Street"
— was the Center for International Security
and Cooperation (CISAC) annual Drell lec
ture.
According to Shanker, senior advisors in
the armed forces are becoming increasingly
worried about the risks associated with the
surge.These advisors, Shanker said, are wor
ried that the politics, violence and civil un
rest in the region will force Ameri
can military forces to retreat before stability
is achieved.
"The military is optimistic about the

surge and the officers
have hope." he said.
"At the same time,
when 1 talk to the real
thinkers in the mili
tary, they are asking

the question of what will happen if the
American military and, therefore, American
policy is forced out."
Shanker said he emailed high-ranking
American military officials who have served
in Iraq. Reading from one response, he said:
"The American military cannot win the war
in Iraq. The American military cannot win
the war in Afghanistan. Not only can the
militaries not win the wars, they will not win


Shanker
the wars."
He added that many Washington
policy makers attribute this pes
simistic attitude to poor decision
making and lost opportunities.
"An opportunity was squandered
after 9/11 to mobilize the American
public," Shanker said. "The [civilian
leadership in the] Pentagon acted
like they owned the place instead of
understanding that they were loaned
the national apparatus by the Amer
ican people who renew that lease
every four years. Now that idea is

changing."
Shanker also devoted some of
his talk to discussing the relation
ship between civilians and the mili
tary.
"The military has to be bold
enough to offer its best advice," he
said. "The civilians must not hide be
hind the military and the military
must not let them."
In a powerful conclusion,
Shanker called on audience mem
bers to become active and engaged
members of society.
"Courage is when you get up
everyday when you go to work, and
try to make a contribution to socie
ty," he said. "Courage is to question
those in authority and do what is
right even if you risk severe reper

cussions. Have the courage to listen
to your doubts." Tray I till, adminis
trative associate for CISAC said the
event was aimed at students.
"We want to inspire students to
think deeply about how to build a
safer world," she said in an email to
The Daily.
Julie Faller '09 was moved by
Shanker's call for student initiation
and action.
"I thought it was an inspiring
speech," she said. "1 agreed with his
point about the necessity of con
tributing to the community because
it is sometimes lost upon Stanford
students."
