# STUDENT LIFE
## HPV vaccine promoted Students encouraged to get new shot, prevent cancer 
### VICTOR CRUZ 
Stanford Students for Choice (SSFC),
Vaden Health Center and the Public Health
Initiative have combined forces to educate
the University community about the newly
approved vaccine for Human Papillomavirus
(HPV),culminating in this week's HPV Vac
cine Awareness Campaign.
The HPV vaccine was approved for fe
males aged 12-26 by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (PDA) on June 8.2006. Cer

tain strains of I IPV have been causally linked
to cervical cancer in women, and can be
spread through sexual contact. The new vac
cine — which protects against the four strains
of I IPV most commonly associated with cer
vical cancer — is 99.9 percent effective in
protecting against these four strains.
Kate Benham '09, vice president of public
ity for SSFC. said the campaign was initiated
to increase awareness about HPV and to com
bat the stigma associated with the disease.
"HPV has a stigma on campus." she said.
"The really interesting thing is how common
it is. So what we've been trying to do is inform
people and de-stigmatize the talk about hav
ing the virus."
