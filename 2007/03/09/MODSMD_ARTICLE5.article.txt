# STUDENT LIFE
## HPV vaccine promoted Students encouraged to get new shot, prevent cancer 
### VICTOR CRUZ 
Stanford Students for Choice (SSFC),
Vaden Health Center and the Public Health
Initiative have combined forces to educate
the University community about the newly
approved vaccine for Human Papillomavirus
(HPV),culminating in this week's HPV Vac
cine Awareness Campaign.
The HPV vaccine was approved for fe
males aged 12-26 by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (PDA) on June 8.2006. Cer

tain strains of I IPV have been causally linked
to cervical cancer in women, and can be
spread through sexual contact. The new vac
cine — which protects against the four strains
of I IPV most commonly associated with cer
vical cancer — is 99.9 percent effective in
protecting against these four strains.
Kate Benham '09, vice president of public
ity for SSFC. said the campaign was initiated
to increase awareness about HPV and to com
bat the stigma associated with the disease.
"HPV has a stigma on campus." she said.
"The really interesting thing is how common
it is. So what we've been trying to do is inform
people and de-stigmatize the talk about hav
ing the virus."

about the prevalence of HPV on
campus, but Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center (SHPRC) counselor
Maggie Chen *09 said the virus is one
of the most common sexually trans
mitted infections on campus.
Nancy Wang '07 expressed con
cern about the vaccine's safety, and

also cited its high cost — each shot
of the vaccine's three-part sequence
costs $135 —as a reason for not
being vaccinated against HPV.
"There's questions of how safe it
is, so 1 want to wait until more trials
and stuff have been run,"she said."lt
also costs a lot; that's the main rea
son I haven't gotten it."
Joel Palefsky, professor at the
UC-San Francisco School of Medi
cine. warned against waiting too long
to get the vaccine.
"If a woman is waiting for more
data," he said,"get vaccinated before

you're exposed — the sooner the
better."
Benham cautioned that a monog
amous relationship is not necessarily
a reason for avoiding the vaccine.
"There is still a high chance of en
countering the virus whenever you
have sex," she said, "or whoever you
have sex with."
