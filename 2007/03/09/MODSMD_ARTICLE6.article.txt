Championship of Collegiate a Cappella (ICCA),
which will take place tomorrow in San Rafael at the
Marin Center for Performing Arts.
Raagapella — an all-male 13-member group
that was founded in 2002 — specializes in the fusion
of South Asian and Western musical styles.
Music Director Vivek Agrawal '07 said Raa
gapella is the first South Asian a cappella group to
reach the ICCA semifinals.
"Since ICCA is the highest a cappella champi

a first-time participant," Agrawal said.
Founded in 19%. ICCA is held every year from

January to April in seven regions throughout the
United States and Western Europe. In the semifi

against eight groups. Financial Manager Nikhil

"In our semifinal performance, we plan to pres

The three songs are "Chan Chan," an instrumen
tal song from the Oscar-nominated movie "Water;"
"Without You." an original composition by Agraw

fusion of Sanskrit chants and a Bollywood song.
Group members are optimistic about their
chances in this weekend's tournament.
"Given the feedback from the show's coordina
tor and the judges on our quarterfinal performance.
we have a good chance of making it to
the final" Kamat said. "They were
pleased by our vocal clarity and
uniqueness of sound and were im
pressed by our choreography which
they referred to as being 'organic.'"
"Right now. we are working on is
sues with volume at times, and are try

ing to sharpen our choreography," he
added.
In addition to their berth in the
ICCA semifinals this weekend, the
group plans to tour the East Coast
during spring break and will develop a
full-length show for spring quarter.
While five other Stanford groups
have advanced to the ICCA semifi
nals in the past, only one — Talisman
in 1997 — has won the championship.
