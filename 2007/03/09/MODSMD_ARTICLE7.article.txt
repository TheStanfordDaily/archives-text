## Energy group picks director Benson joins project, will work to reduce greenhouse gasses 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Sally Benson, former deputy director of opera
tions at the Lawrence Berkeley National Labora
tory, began her duties as executive director of
Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project
(GCEP) last Thursday.
GCEP is an interdisciplinary research effort to
discover and apply different technologies that
mitigate the release of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.
Project Director Franklin Orr. Jr. praised Ben
son's reputation as a researcher.
"She is an internationally recognized re
searcher and research leader in carbon capture
and storage," he said.

Benson, who has worked
extensively on carbon se
questration projects, said it
was her desire to interact
more with students in an ac
ademic environment that
prompted her move to
GCEP.
"I have always been very
attracted to working in a
University environment
with a bigger opportunity to
work with students," she
said.

Benson also spoke enthusiastically about her
role as a researcher at GCF.P.
"I am most looking forward to finding solu
tions to really what I think is the challenge of the
century: Finding energy systems that don't emit
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere," she added.


Benson
"It is a fantastic opportunity to work
at the premier organization and to
conduct research in this field."
Another of Benson's responsibil
ities will be to "build a group of tal
ented senior faculty who will help us
expand our range' of technical ex
pertise" according to Orr.

The new director will also collab
orate with universities in developing
countries like China and India that
emit large amounts of greenhouse
gases. She will also work with
GCEP's sponsors in an effort to bet
ter focus the project's research goals.
"GCEP does stuff that compa
nies and government-sponsored or
ganizations wouldn't do," Benson
said. "So, if we understand what in
dustry is doing, that will help us cast
our view into the future."
Orr said that Benson's appoint

ment coincides with GCEP's recent
expansion.
"We are thriving." he said. "We
were just awarded a hunch of new re
search projects in advanced batter
ies. We are looking now at proposals
on very high efficiency solar energy
conversions. We continue to add to
and build our portfolio of research,
and we are looking forward to hav
ing Sally help us."
