### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Sally Benson, former deputy director of opera
tions at the Lawrence Berkeley National Labora
tory, began her duties as executive director of
Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project
(GCEP) last Thursday.
GCEP is an interdisciplinary research effort to
discover and apply different technologies that
mitigate the release of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.
Project Director Franklin Orr. Jr. praised Ben
son's reputation as a researcher.
"She is an internationally recognized re
searcher and research leader in carbon capture
and storage," he said.

Benson, who has worked
extensively on carbon se
questration projects, said it
was her desire to interact
more with students in an ac
ademic environment that
prompted her move to
GCEP.
"I have always been very
attracted to working in a
University environment
with a bigger opportunity to
work with students," she
said.

Benson also spoke enthusiastically about her
role as a researcher at GCF.P.
"I am most looking forward to finding solu
tions to really what I think is the challenge of the
century: Finding energy systems that don't emit
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere," she added.
