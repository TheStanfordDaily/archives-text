"Golden Gate bridge com
muters were treated to a special
surprise last Friday afternoon when
a group of about 45 Branner Hall
freshmen streaked alongside of
them. Stanford may not be number
one in basketball or football, but
we're number one in streaking,'
said one of the streakers.
"The Branner Hall group, who
call themselves the Hay Are Run
ners Extraordinaire Association of
Stanford Streakers (BARE-ASS)
ran almost two-thirds of a mile
across the famous span. Clad only
in hats, shoes, and Stanford regalia,
the streakers pulled off one of the
most imaginative streaking stunts
of the evidently recently reopened
streaking season."
