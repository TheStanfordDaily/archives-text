"Its dangerously easy to type first and think
second.

Like many students across campus,
the residents of Freshman-Sopho
more College (FroSoCo) awoke with
a start on Valentine's Day morning as
sophomores and staff members rolled
the dorm's freshmen out of bed at 7
a.m. Students emerged from their
rooms, still rubbing the sleep from
their eyes, for breakfast and a small
celebration, a longstanding Stanford
tradition.
But this year, talk of the tradition
— cherished by some and cursed by
others — escalated beyond a few hall
way mutterings. Through the dorm's
listserv, students exchanged a series of
emails that became increasingly hos
tile.
"Maybe you enjoyed the hell out
of it, but does that justify what it does
to every one else? I'm finding it hard
to understand why your special little
experience requires that I get woken
up at 7:30," snapped one student.
His remarks immediately antago
nized other members of the dorm.
Thank you for the insults," one stu
dent wrote sarcastically."l'm also sure
the staff, the sophomores, the boys
(from last year) and everyone who has
ever done this in the past really appre
ciates it."
Students read on in amazement as
the fight escalated. Ultimately, dorm
administrators chose to moderate the
listserv in an effort to end the bicker
ing.
The email exchange started out po
litely, but it just got completely out of
hand," said Ming Jia'lo, a resident of
FroSoCo. "Sure, the original com
plaint was justified, but the subse
quent exchanges that took place were
just unnecessary and inappropriate. I
mean. I love all my dormmates — just
resolve this kind of stuff privately."
The technology boom of the last
two decades has given the Internet an
integral role in the Stanford commu
nity. Email is a primary medium
through which campus groups publi
cize upcoming events and students
converse with their peers and profes
sors. Undoubtedly, this technology has
revolutionized the way in which we
communicate, yet — as the story of

FroSoC'o's chatlist squabbles demon
strates— not all changes have been
for the best. Cyberspace, it seems, has
a tendency to elicit statements of ex
treme anger and harsh criticism —
what researchers call "flaming."
Psychologists attribute this phe
nomenon— the online disinhibition
effect — to two unique aspects of the
Internet: anonymity and invisibility.
The perception that one's identity is
hidden, beyond discovery, becomes
intoxicating; people can express how
they truly feei without worrying about
being held personally accountable for
what they say.
The Stanford Daily's Web site is
one online forum that struggles with
flaming as a result of anonymity. Any
visitor to the Web site can comment
on any story; though they must pro

vide an email address, their identities
remain anonymous.
Toward the end of October, arti
cles about an attempted Branner re
union sparked a number of flaming
online responses. Instances like these,
which frequently devolve into person
al attacks, have led 'I"he Daily editors
to enact various changes on its Web
site. Readers now have the option to
report comments as offensive and re
quest their removal. Additional
changes are being considered to filter
out online comments that would not
be allowed to run on the opinions
page of the newspaper.
Nonetheless, the forum is still an
outlet for unconstructive negativity.
Emma Trotter '10 has written over
20 articles for The Daily this year, but
because of the anonymous Web site

commenting feature, the experience
has not been all positive. An anony
mous poster once labeled her piece in
Intermission "the stupidest column
I've ever read, or at least tried to
read."
"1 don't sit there and dwell on it."
said Trotter, "but it hurts when some
one says.'that was really pointless' be
cause 1 did spend two hours on it."
Researchers believe flamers can
be motivated by a number of different
reasons.
"Flaming can be a way to reduce
anxiety, so that may be the case for
these students," said fifth-year gradu
ate student in psychology Michelle
Ciumbrecht, a specialist in the psy
chology of cyberspace, as she looked
over the Web site.
"For some people, it's to pass the

time," she said. "For others, it's enter
tainment, a kind of escapism."
Even without the security of an
anonymous post, invisibility alone,
like on a dorm listserv, can be enough
to generate flames. Facial expressions
— which are absent in online dialogue
— often serve as a reminder to repress
inappropriate behavior.
"it could just be the medium, the
fact that you're lacking these visual
cues, such as here we are in a face-to
face conversation.' Would it necessar
ily be different if we were doing this
through e-mail?" asked Gumbrecht.
The Internet, though, should not
be held responsible for all the anger it
generates.
"If you look at discussions that
have these religious and political
overtones — if you put that in any sort
of medium," she said." then those
things are going to come out anyway."
As one of Roble Hall's two RCCs.
Jeremy Hoffman '07 frequently wit
nesses the effects of online disinhibi
tion. Several weeks ago. he was forced
to temporarily censor the dorm's list
serv when a fight broke out over what
constituted an appropriate chatlist
message.
"The irony of anti-spamming
spam," Hoffman laughed.
The decision to suspend the
chatlist came when several students
began to use profanity.
"This sort of thing happens a few
times ever>' year." I loffman said."The
bigger the dorm, the worse it gets.
Roble is a unique combination of too
many freshmen with time on their
hands, and too many upperclassmen
who look down on freshmen."
"And with email chat lists," he
added, "it's dangerously easy to type
first and think second."
Psychologists claim that it is rarely
the entire community at fault — only
a certain subset of people.
"Text has that sense of permanen
cy. talking is more ephemeral — it's
public, especially with discussion lists,
and the exposure is longer,"said Gum
brecht."Some people really do want to
get a rise out of someone, and. well, this
is one of the best ways to do it."
Hoffman's experience has been
similar; in every dorm, there are al
ways a few "chatlist repeat offenders."
"Some people think their opinion*
or their clever witticisms are so radi
ant that they would be doing a disserv
ice to the community not to give it to
everyone who's willing to listen.'' hq
said, smiling wryly."l think I'm a littlq
bit more humble than that."

Researchers believe flamers can
be motivated by a number of different
reasons.

anxiety, so that may be the case for
these students," said fifth-year gradu

chology of cyberspace, as she looked
over the Web site.
"For some people, it's to pass the

time," she said. "For others, it's enter

anonymous post, invisibility alone,
like on a dorm listserv, can be enough
to generate flames. Facial expressions
— which are absent in online dialogue
— often serve as a reminder to repress
inappropriate behavior.

fact that you're lacking these visual
cues, such as here we are in a face-to

The Internet, though, should not
be held responsible for all the anger it
generates.

have these religious and political
overtones — if you put that in any sort
of medium," she said." then those

"Its dangerously easy to type first and think
second.

Like many students across campus,
the residents of Freshman-Sopho
more College (FroSoCo) awoke with
a start on Valentine's Day morning as
sophomores and staff members rolled
the dorm's freshmen out of bed at 7
a.m. Students emerged from their
rooms, still rubbing the sleep from
their eyes, for breakfast and a small
celebration, a longstanding Stanford
tradition.
But this year, talk of the tradition
— cherished by some and cursed by
others — escalated beyond a few hall
way mutterings. Through the dorm's
listserv, students exchanged a series of
emails that became increasingly hos
tile.
"Maybe you enjoyed the hell out
of it, but does that justify what it does
to every one else? I'm finding it hard
to understand why your special little
experience requires that I get woken
up at 7:30," snapped one student.
His remarks immediately antago
nized other members of the dorm.
Thank you for the insults," one stu
dent wrote sarcastically."l'm also sure
the staff, the sophomores, the boys
(from last year) and everyone who has
ever done this in the past really appre
ciates it."
Students read on in amazement as
the fight escalated. Ultimately, dorm
administrators chose to moderate the
listserv in an effort to end the bicker
ing.
The email exchange started out po
litely, but it just got completely out of
hand," said Ming Jia'lo, a resident of
FroSoCo. "Sure, the original com
plaint was justified, but the subse
quent exchanges that took place were
just unnecessary and inappropriate. I
mean. I love all my dormmates — just
resolve this kind of stuff privately."
The technology boom of the last
two decades has given the Internet an
integral role in the Stanford commu
nity. Email is a primary medium
through which campus groups publi
cize upcoming events and students
converse with their peers and profes
sors. Undoubtedly, this technology has
revolutionized the way in which we
communicate, yet — as the story of

FroSoC'o's chatlist squabbles demon
strates— not all changes have been
for the best. Cyberspace, it seems, has
a tendency to elicit statements of ex
treme anger and harsh criticism —
what researchers call "flaming."
Psychologists attribute this phe
nomenon— the online disinhibition
effect — to two unique aspects of the
Internet: anonymity and invisibility.
The perception that one's identity is
hidden, beyond discovery, becomes
intoxicating; people can express how
they truly feei without worrying about
being held personally accountable for
what they say.
The Stanford Daily's Web site is
one online forum that struggles with
flaming as a result of anonymity. Any
visitor to the Web site can comment
on any story; though they must pro

vide an email address, their identities
remain anonymous.
Toward the end of October, arti
cles about an attempted Branner re
union sparked a number of flaming
online responses. Instances like these,
which frequently devolve into person
al attacks, have led 'I"he Daily editors
to enact various changes on its Web
site. Readers now have the option to
report comments as offensive and re
quest their removal. Additional
changes are being considered to filter
out online comments that would not
be allowed to run on the opinions
page of the newspaper.
Nonetheless, the forum is still an
outlet for unconstructive negativity.
Emma Trotter '10 has written over
20 articles for The Daily this year, but
because of the anonymous Web site

commenting feature, the experience
has not been all positive. An anony
mous poster once labeled her piece in
Intermission "the stupidest column
I've ever read, or at least tried to
read."
"1 don't sit there and dwell on it."
said Trotter, "but it hurts when some
one says.'that was really pointless' be
cause 1 did spend two hours on it."
