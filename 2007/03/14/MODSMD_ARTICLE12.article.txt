## New study-aid program tries to digitalize textbooks, faces challenges 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
Monday marked the official launch of Cafe Scribe, a study aid described by co-founder
Bryce Johnson as an "iTunes for written material."
Cafe Scribe's ambitious goals include cutting into the $7 billion textbook market while
helping students sharto digitalize content, relieving students of heavy backpacks and saving
them money. While the pilot version of the program, rolled out two years ago at institutions
including Stanford's Law School, drew praise from administrators for its technological fea
tures, they cited its limited popularity in questioning whether the program would catch on.
Law Prof. Alan Morrison, who gave Johnson permission to demonstrate the product
to a class in the fall of 2005, said that he thought the program's main benefit for his class
would be to enable easier cross-referencing, especially for statutes.
"I prefer for students to look at the rules than to not look at them," Morrison said.
Catherine Glaze. Associate Dean of Student Affairs for the Law School, said that she
saw the appeal of the program, recalling her own experience lugging textbooks around.
"If you've ever seen the size of law books they're enormous." Glaze said. "My first
week of law school, my backpack broke because the casebooks were so heavy."
Still. Glaze and Morrison expressed skepticism regarding the program's popularity.
"Nobody really picked up on it." Glaze said, noting that Morrison was the only Law
School professor to use it. And out of a total of 25 students in Morrison's class that John
son demonstrated the program to. Morrison recalled only three adopting it.
But Johnson was confident that the program would catch on,citing the abundance of lap-

pany to make textbooks
available to students at
wholesale prices, which
he says is a 20 to 30 per
cent savings. He notes ex
amples of students who

have gone all-out in using
Cafe Scribe's features, includ-

ing one Stanford student who
created 25 different colors of

digital highlighter, and stresses
the potential of the program to facili
tate note-sharing and group work.

"In the 90s. this wouldn't have
worked," Johnson said. "But now, Cafe-
Scribe is becoming more of a must-have
than a nice-to-have."
Glaze was more pessimistic.

"It was a bit too high-tech for me â€” I like the paper "she said."lt was an intriguing
thing, hut the time, I don't think, has come yet."
