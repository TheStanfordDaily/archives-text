CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - A $45 million
per-year plan for full-day kindergarten in all
Nevada elementary schools — a plan that GOP
Gov. Jim Gibbons opposes —was endorsed
Monday on a party-line vote in a Democrat-con
trolled state Assembly committee.
A 8157 proponents included Senate Mi
nority Leader Dina Titus. D-Las Vegas, who
said she can't believe there is any debate on
the issue. Titus added other states have
moved on to discussing whether to provide
preschool.
"Most people think the value of kinder
garten is like a truism, kind of like eating an
apple a day. not playing with matches and
washing your hands. It's just common sense
that all-day kindergarten would work." Titus
said.
