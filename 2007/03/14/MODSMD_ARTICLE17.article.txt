## A
						closer look at "Dick in a Box" 
### JULIA MELTZER INTERMISSION SOCIAL CRITIC 
Can you even imagine a time before
"Dick in a Box"? I"he Saturday Night
Live digital short is so commonly
watched, so commonly loved and so
pervasive that life without it seems like
another era. Everyone loves "Dick in a
Box". Now. 1 know there's nothing like
critical analysis to really kill a joke, but
the satire of "Dick in a Box" is so dead
on that it's worth looking at.
I really hate to mix my Freud and my
Andy Samberg. but when it's this bla
tant I can't help it: "Dick in a Box" is a
penis envy story. The psychoanalysis of
the date portrayed in the video would
be as follows: two-year-old Maya
Rudolph is shocked and disappointed
to learn that she does not. in fact, have a
penis. She desires a penis (most readily
her father's), but displaces her desire
for her father's penis onto Andy Sam
berg's penis. He presents it to her (and
in a box. no less!). Problem solved.
The humor in the video comes from
the women reacting to their gifts in a to
tally unrealistic way — no woman actu
ally wants a "Dick in a Box" (Gentle
men. if this is news. I 'm sorry).The video
conveys how silly this is, and critiques a
society that is somehow still hung up on
penis envy as a way of explaining gen
der relations.
I really don't like penis envy as a
concept. Feminist critics of Freud con
tend that penis envy is seriously prob
lematic because it presents women as
lacking, and obsessed by their lack of,
something that men have. At best, it's
Freud's misguided assessment of a sex
ist, patriarchal society: and at worst, it's
a justification used to enforce that soci
ety.

To show the women in the video as
thrilled and grateful for their gift of a
penis is to reinforce the idea that they
felt that they were lacking one all
along. Would the video have been ma
terially less funny if it had shown dis
gusted women rejecting the gift of the
penis?
Well...yes, because women who are
not happy with a penis that is presented
to them are sexually harassed women. I
really hate to do this, because 1 like
funny things, and rape just makes any
thing less funny, but "Dick in a Box"
certainly has a subtle rape narrative.
Luckily, Maya and Kristen Wiig, cued
by Freud, are thrilled by their gift, so
they express consent after the fact. But
really, the sexual exchange in "Dick in a
Box" is scarily one-sided.
The assumption that a woman wants
to engage with your penis, or that she
should engage with your penis regard
less of whether or not she wants to, is the
premise on which rape is based. The
reason the video can't show the women
rejecting the gift (and Freud), as good
feminists would, is that it would paint a
picture too close to rape for SNL to
handle. In all the lyrical musings on why
and how they are giving their girlfriends
dicks in boxes, there is never any discus
sion of whether the women want or will
enjoy this gift. Step three, after all. is
make her open the box. Why not leave
her some sexual autonomy and let her
open the box?
Perhaps this part of the video sati
rizes men's control, or perceived con
trol. of heterosexual encounters. But I
find it hard to imagine that SNL con
sciously chose to deal with rape in a dig
ital short. I think that, in joking about
the worst possible gift a man could give
a woman, they stumbled upon the prob

lem of rape lurking in their narrative,
and they don't address its presence at
all. because they don't know how to.
And that makes for a problematic
satire.
I don't think "Dick in a Box", or its
popularity, is a bad thing, by any means
we should have creative discourse on
gender relations and sexuality. We don't
even need to have "discourse," because
that's pretentious — we can have funny
YouTUbe videos about penises.
When we laugh about "Dick in a
Box," when we accept it into our culture
so completely and pervasively, we ac
cept an incomplete satire that portrays
male control of sex without addressing
it. Perhaps we should be more critical of
how it treats, and fails to treat, sex.
