## Battle of the Bands 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION EARLY BIRD 
Much to my friend's chagrin, we arrived at the
Phi Kappa Psi's "Battle of the Bands" embarrass
ing early — which is to say we were there at the
advertised start time of 9 p.m. Other than a few
lounging hand members and darting Phi Psi
brothers, we were the first arrivals. Even the 21-
and-over wrist bracelet distribution hadn't yet
begun, and the four beefy security guards stood
around with their hands in their pockets.
We used the awkward situation to our advan
tage by locating a bench along the right side of
the room. Ten minutes later, when Battle of the
Bands officially kicked off with its opening act —
Thunderball, a Molly 1 latchet cover band — we
celebrated the good fortune of our vantage point.
1 could even see the sweat on the brow of lead
singer Doc Edge, who sang as though constantly
on the brink of laughter.
The less conventional but equally quirky gui
tarist Joseph Larkin. to Edge's left, had an aes
thetic value independent of his backdrop: from
his power headband to his unusual facial hair, he
looked more like an extra from Napoleon Dyna
mite than Dave 1 Ilubeck.The crowd, though still
small, responded emphatically. I think 1 even
spotted a couple of audience members having
standing seizures in the front row.
Last year's champion, Occam's Razor, took
the stage second. The opening song, "Ransom,"
included early accordion action and a beautiful
violin melody by guest performer Chrysanthe
Tan.
Behind his keyboard, Pra Chandrasoma took
literal center stage, pounding the keys with fin
gers crooked like an extra for "Thriller" and call
ing to the audience: "Come closer! We're all
friends and lovers here!" While a fair misread of
the eclectic audience, Chandrasoma nonetheless
overwhelmed with charisma, and Occam's clos
ing song — a cover of "Hotel California" with a
"let's rock the fuck out" twist — had surprising
musical quality despite the shouting.
When Vice took the stage at ten. little standing
room remained in the Phi Psi lounge. Of all the
Stanford bands. Vice is distinguished by the
unique personal histories of its band members.
Guitarist Grahame Lesh is the son of the Grate
ful Dead's Phil Lesh, and lead singer Brodie
Jenkins had a short-lived country music career
with her mom and older sister prior to coming to
Stanford. Iliis country background couldn't be
more obvious in Vice's music. No matter how
gritty Jenkins takes her voice, you still can't help
but liken her tone to that of Le Ann Rimes.
After opening with a band original, "Forgive
me. Father," I lost the ability to distinguish be
tween individual numbers. Jenkin's throaty,
melodic yells were semi-drowned out bv her in

strumental accompaniment, and the stage
looked uncomfortably congested with the five of
them crowded onto the small platform.
After a short intermission performance by Phi
Psi Ari Officer. K.Flay began setting up. The
crowd crackled with energy, as presumably a fair
faction had come for her alone. I'll be honest: I
did. K.Flay is the first musical talent indigenous
to Stanford that I witnessed as a freshman, and
perhaps this alone would make her distinctive in
my mind. From her onstage demeanor to her
frank lyrics. K.Flay's uncomplicated presenta
tion before an audience suggests a unique sincer
ity. At Saturday's performance, DJ Hot Rod
backed her singing with deft scratching and plen
ty of bounce. Judging by the look on his face.he's
her biggest fan.
Crooked Mile followed as a stark contrast to
K.Flay's style. I should preface my recount of
their set with a disclaimer: I am not a fan of heavy
metal music, and from Sachin Premasuthan's
Iron Maiden T-shirt to the half-naked Andrew
Blaser on drums, Crooked Mile is all about heavy
metal. Should any doubt remain, as soon as Pre
masuthan took the stage, a banshee scream to
open the first song clarified his intentions.
I"he singing itself was beautiful — particular
ly for the Iron Maiden cover — but the cacopho
ny enveloping it distracted me. The audience re
sponded in drunken glee, chanting, "one more
song!" when Crooked Mile finished the set. and
an impromptu encore began.
The last band of the night was Junior Sales As
sociates, led by singer/guitarist Christian Gar
nett. As a closer. JSA disappointed. Their songs
seemed arbitrarily chosen and the entirety of
their audience interaction focused on the throng
of admirers positioned adjacent to the stage.
When Phi Psi asked JSA to finish their set in the
interest of time. Garnet t's open defiance and sub
sequent audience appeal (a whiny/'They want us
to leave guys. What do you think about that? )
was surprising in its tactlessness. What's more,
when Phi Psi conceded. JSA squeezed two songs
into one by simply keeping the drums steady in
the pause in between songs.
For a free event. Phi Psi's Battle of the Bands
represented a fresh departure from the tradition
al Saturday night frat party.The eclectic nature of
the lineup meant that at least one band appealed
to each Stanford listener, and the Gordon Bier
sch sponsorship added an unexpected dimension
of professionalism.
In a twist.at the evening's close, the 2007 Stan
lord Dollies took the stage in their first public ap
pearance to announce the winners: 3rd place:
Occam s Razor, 2nd place: Crooked Mile, and Ist
place: Vice. The champions took the stage for a
final encore, but after one round of the country
rock fusion and three hours in a low-oxygen cor
ner, 1 was ready for some fresh air.

K.Flay's style. I should preface my recount of
their set with a disclaimer: I am not a fan of heavy
metal music, and from Sachin Premasuthan's
Iron Maiden T-shirt to the half-naked Andrew
Blaser on drums, Crooked Mile is all about heavy
metal. Should any doubt remain, as soon as Pre
masuthan took the stage, a banshee scream to
open the first song clarified his intentions.
I"he singing itself was beautiful — particular
ly for the Iron Maiden cover — but the cacopho
ny enveloping it distracted me. The audience re
sponded in drunken glee, chanting, "one more
song!" when Crooked Mile finished the set. and
an impromptu encore began.
The last band of the night was Junior Sales As
sociates, led by singer/guitarist Christian Gar
nett. As a closer. JSA disappointed. Their songs
seemed arbitrarily chosen and the entirety of
their audience interaction focused on the throng
of admirers positioned adjacent to the stage.
When Phi Psi asked JSA to finish their set in the
interest of time. Garnet t's open defiance and sub
sequent audience appeal (a whiny/'They want us
to leave guys. What do you think about that? )
was surprising in its tactlessness. What's more,
when Phi Psi conceded. JSA squeezed two songs
into one by simply keeping the drums steady in
the pause in between songs.
For a free event. Phi Psi's Battle of the Bands
represented a fresh departure from the tradition
al Saturday night frat party.The eclectic nature of
the lineup meant that at least one band appealed
to each Stanford listener, and the Gordon Bier
sch sponsorship added an unexpected dimension
of professionalism.
In a twist.at the evening's close, the 2007 Stan
lord Dollies took the stage in their first public ap
pearance to announce the winners: 3rd place:
Occam s Razor, 2nd place: Crooked Mile, and Ist
place: Vice. The champions took the stage for a
final encore, but after one round of the country
rock fusion and three hours in a low-oxygen cor
ner, 1 was ready for some fresh air.
