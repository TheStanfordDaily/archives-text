# IT'S CARD VS. CARD
## 11-seed men tackle six-seed Louisville in Kentucky first round

Stanford's dancing — by the skin of its teeth!
The Cardinal, an 11-seed in the NCAA Tourna
ment. will play six-seed Louisville tomorrow in
Lexington. Ky. With a victory, Stanford would face
the winner of the game between three-seed Texas
A&M and 14-seed Pennsylvania on Saturday for a
chance to make its first Sweet 16 since 2001.
The Cardinal men found out the news the same
way as their fans, privately watching CBS' Selec
tion Show in their locker room. And the squad was
just as excited as the faithful when it got the word.
"It was pandemonium," head coach Trent John
son said. "A couple of them said. "My goodness.
Coach. I've never seen you like this." I think it was
Brook [Lopez] that knocked me over."
The first three announced regions of 16 — the
Midwest. West and East — included fellow bubble
teams Indiana, Illinois, Old Dominion, Purdue,
Arkansas, Gonzaga and Texas Tech. but no Stan
ford. Still, the Cardinal held out hope for a spot in
the South region.
And at 3:36 p.m.. the magic word appeared on
television sets around the country. Sixty-four teams
had already been announced — Stanford was lit
erally the last team into the tournament.
"Me and Brook were carrying Coach J," said
sophomore guard Anthony Goods of the post-an
nouncement celebration. It was kind of like a dou
ble hug, and then we ended up picking him up be
cause Brook is seven feet. We just ended up carry
ing Coach J around the locker room while every
body was screaming."
Johnson was confident about Stanford's
chances heading into the Pacific-10 Conference
Tournament, but admitted growing nervous in the
days after Stanford's Thursday-night overtime loss
to Southern California.
Goods missed two late, crucial free throws in
the contest, his first action since suffering an ankle
sprain at Washington nearly a month ago. Johnson
said his star shooter felt guilty about his role in
Stanford's finish, so the announcement lifted a
major weight from his chest.

Lawrence Hill takes a shot from the outside
against Arizona. The sophomore forward had a
hip contusion against USC in the Pac-10 quarter
final, but returns to face Louisville tomorrow.
"If anybody would have seen him
the last two days, you would have
thought he was on his deathbed," said
Johnson after the announcement. "I
just told him. Don't worry about it. 1
wouldn't want anybody else in that sit
uation. shooting free throws, but
you."'
At first glance. Goods and compa
ny look to have a good shot against
Louisville.The No. 16 Cardinals (23-9.
12-4 Big East) won seven of their last
eight to tie for second in their 16-team
conference, but beat only two NCAA
teams (Pittsburgh and Marquette) on
the season.
Louisville does sport a stingy de
fense that has allowed 75 points just
twice the entire season. Offensively
though, they prefer to bang inside
rather than light up the arc, shooting
just 33 percent deep and 66 percent on
free throws, which plays right into
Stanford's hands.
"The good thing about it is that
Louisville plays with bigs," Johnson
said. "The bigger the team, the more 1
like our chances. Smaller teams who
can bring our posts away from the bas
ket and attack them off the dribble
have given us problems."
Still. Louisville enters the contest
as the six-point favorite, and for good
reason. Their top six — 6-foot-11 jun
ior center David Padgett, forwards
Juan Palacios, Derrick Caracter and
Terrence Williams, and guards Edgar
Sosa and Jerry Smith — average at
least eight points per game.
The team's rebounding and ball

handling numbers are similarly strong
under head coach Rick Pitino.The for
mer coach of the Boston Celtics and
college powerhouse Kentucky is re
garded as one of the best in the busi
ness.
Two additional factors conspire
against Stanford.
First, the contest is just 60 miles
away from Louisville and Cardinals
fans quickly scooped up unsold tickets
at Kentucky's Rupp Arena. Plus, after
flying across the country yesterday.
Stanford will need to be up for a 9:40
a.m. PST (12:40 p.m. local) start.
Johnson admitted the locale would
represent a challenge, but refused to
make excuses.
"We could play them in Jamaica for
all 1 care," he said.
The top seeds in Stanford's region
are No. 1 Ohio State. No. 2 Memphis.
No. 3Texas A&M and No. 4 Virginia,
while Florida, North Carolina and
Kansas hold the other one-seeds.
The Pac-10 had a banner day, plac
ing six teams (No. 2 UCLA, No. 3
Washington State, No. 3 Oregon, No. S
USC, No. 8 Arizona and Stanford)
into the dance. Major snubs included
Drexel, Air Force and Syracuse.
Stanford had made 11 straight
NCAA Tournaments before missing
the Big Dance and accepting an Nil
bid last season. In that stretch unde
Mike Montgomery, the Cardinal
made just one Final Four, in 1998.
