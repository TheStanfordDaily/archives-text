# IT'S CARD VS. CARD
## 11-seed men tackle six-seed Louisville in Kentucky first round

Stanford's dancing — by the skin of its teeth!
The Cardinal, an 11-seed in the NCAA Tourna
ment. will play six-seed Louisville tomorrow in
Lexington. Ky. With a victory, Stanford would face
the winner of the game between three-seed Texas
A&M and 14-seed Pennsylvania on Saturday for a
chance to make its first Sweet 16 since 2001.
The Cardinal men found out the news the same
way as their fans, privately watching CBS' Selec
tion Show in their locker room. And the squad was
just as excited as the faithful when it got the word.
"It was pandemonium," head coach Trent John
son said. "A couple of them said. "My goodness.
Coach. I've never seen you like this." I think it was
Brook [Lopez] that knocked me over."
The first three announced regions of 16 — the
Midwest. West and East — included fellow bubble
teams Indiana, Illinois, Old Dominion, Purdue,
Arkansas, Gonzaga and Texas Tech. but no Stan
ford. Still, the Cardinal held out hope for a spot in
the South region.
And at 3:36 p.m.. the magic word appeared on
television sets around the country. Sixty-four teams
had already been announced — Stanford was lit
erally the last team into the tournament.
"Me and Brook were carrying Coach J," said
sophomore guard Anthony Goods of the post-an
nouncement celebration. It was kind of like a dou
ble hug, and then we ended up picking him up be
cause Brook is seven feet. We just ended up carry
ing Coach J around the locker room while every
body was screaming."
Johnson was confident about Stanford's
chances heading into the Pacific-10 Conference
Tournament, but admitted growing nervous in the
days after Stanford's Thursday-night overtime loss
to Southern California.
Goods missed two late, crucial free throws in
the contest, his first action since suffering an ankle
sprain at Washington nearly a month ago. Johnson
said his star shooter felt guilty about his role in
Stanford's finish, so the announcement lifted a
major weight from his chest.

Lawrence Hill takes a shot from the outside
against Arizona. The sophomore forward had a
hip contusion against USC in the Pac-10 quarter
final, but returns to face Louisville tomorrow.
