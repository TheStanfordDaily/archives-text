# Hidden Stanford Eateries
## Alumni Cafe: Good but far from gourmet (and from the rest of campus) 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION FUTURE ALUMNA 
Location: Arrillaga Alumni Center

Sat & Sun: Closed
The Cafe: California Bistro and
Wine Bar. located in the Arrillaga
Alumni Center, describes itself as a
"gathering point for alumni, stu
dents, faculty and staff — whether
for espresso in the morning, a quick
bite for lunch, a mid-afternoon
snack or a glass of beer or wine in
the evening." 1 very rarely see a
restaurant depict itself so accurate
ly-
The Cafe doesn't put on gourmet
airs or claim the best food on cam
pus— it serves quick, casual food
at reasonable prices, making it a
solid choice for anyone. If you're
looking for something more excit
ing, more exotic and perhaps more
risky, however, this is not the place
for vou.

Although the Cafe has a small
array of breakfast foods, ranging
from bagels and fresh fruit to muesli
with apples and berries, its lunch
menu is by far its strongest selection.
My friend and 1 were impressed with
its emphasis on fresh, seasonal and
healthy food choices — 1 honestly
could have opted for anything on the
menu.
Like Tresidder and Olive's. The
Cafe hosts a small grab-and-go re
frigerated aisle, with a variety of fa
miliar salads (Cobb, Caesar and
spinach) and cold sandwiches
("The Catalina," "The Santa Bar
bara," etc, all found at other campus
eateries).
The Grilled Combo Plates also
looked like a well-portioned option,
including a small main course, Cali
fornia rice blend, dinner roll and
fountain drink. Finally, the lunch
menu includes specials like the Hot
Sandwich of the Week and Salad of
the Season.
Mv friend, a vegetarian, opted for

the grab-and-go Woodside Egg
Sandwich, though she noted that
there were plenty of appetizing veg
etarian options to consider. She and 1
decided to split the Napa Valley
Spinach Salad, and I went with the
Wrap of the Week, Chicken Tikka
Masala. and picked up a lemon bar
and a brownie at the cash register.
We were surprised to see that all of
this food came to less than twenty
dollars — much less expensive than
a comparable amount of food in Palo
Alto.
'lTie Cafe has both inside and out
side seating, which is perfect lor the
somewhat unpredictable weather
Stanford has been having recently.
My friend and I loved the Napa Val
ley Salad, with its fresh spinach, ap
ples, goat cheese and raspberry vinai
grette dressing, and found the size
perfect to split between the two of us.
The salad, though, was the highest
point of the meal — everything else
was fine, but nothing to write home
about.

My friend noted that the egg salad
was,"ehh ... kind of plain." and I did
n't recognize how my wrap was sup
posed to resemble any sort of Indian
food. It was bland, unlike any chick
en tikka masala I've ever eaten, but
not necessarily bad. Needless to say.
both entrees lacked the zest we had
anticipated.
We both enjoyed the brownie,
which would have gone wonderfully
with a milkshake or cup of coffee
(also offered at The Cafe), but the
lemon bar was far too sweet and not
lemon-y enough (just like all of Stan
ford Dining's lemon bars! Adminis
trators, take note).
Overall, our experience was a
pleasant one — ITie Cafe has a clean,
friendly atmosphere with nice seating
and an appetizing selection.
It would be a wonderful place to
take a non-adventurous eater, or sim
ply to get away from the rest of Stan
ford Dining for lunch.
The food is nothing thrilling or
even mildly striking, thouuh, and I

think I really liked the idea of the
eatery more than the eatery itself.
If 1 were above the legal drinking
age. 1 might be enticed to go back for

the wine bar and beer on tap. Since
I'm not. I don't see myself returning
to The Cafe unless it is the most con
venient option.
