## The
						next thought-provoking blend of fact and fiction 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION PLEASURE READER 
It's a testament to the timeliness of
Michael Crichton's latest novel,"Next"
— concerned with the strange and terri
fying advances in genetics for which
much of the world is entirely unpre
pared — that mere moments after I fin
ished it. a friend came barging into my
room to tell me about a flier seeking test
subjects for a genetics study. My vehe
ment "No!" stands as evidence of the
power of Crichton's book to create dis
comfort, disgust and horror.
Hie storyline of the novel claims to mix
fact with fiction,creating a world in the ex
tremely near future, if not the present, in
which scientists breed human-chimp hv
brids, entire families have to go into hiding
to avoid being harvested for valuable cells,
and genes are a commercial prospect.
The story hops between multiple plot

lines and points of view. Sometimes they
are connected, much like those strange
coincidences that occur in flashbacks on
"Lost," and sometimes they are not. In
one. we might find Alex Burnet, a lawyer
whose father is in court fighting for pos
session of his own cells: in another. Josh
Winkler, whose druggie brother inhales a
genetic test virus that seems to cure ad
diction; and in yet another. Henry
Kendall, who must live with his "hu
manzee" son, the result of a genetic lab
experiment gone awry.
Some storylines are consistent, ful
filling. packed with justice, failure, or at
least irony. Others don't even bother to
arc before they peter out into pointless
ness.The only real constant is that, with
one exception, all lawyers are terrible
human beings. As are most CEOs. And
financial investors. And most of the
legal system is either unethical or a
booby trap of red tape. In fact, Crich

ton's novel is most definitely not in
tended to give a positive view of human
nature or civilization in general.
The great success of Crichton's book,
though.does not concern human person
ality. but human issues, especially genet
ics. The novel is, as 1 said, timely. Crichton
takes a field full of difficult concepts and
manages to make it at once terrifying and
completely readable for the layperson
(which would be me,an English major).
At the same time, the relevance and
accuracy of his book would be more pro
nounced if the "facts" that he chose were
less fantastical. Crichton's work is un
doubtedly one of fiction, but he bills it as
including real information. To his credit,
the end of his work includes both a bibli
ography and an explanation of what he
thinks about the issues presented, which
lets us know exactly what is real.
Reading this, we can see what he's talk
ing about — patenting genes does seem

ridiculous, as does attempting universal
bans on certain areas of research, for ex
ample. Hut this information might be more
helpful at the beginning of the novel: oth
erwise. people like me, who are not up to
speed on current genetic issues, may con
sider the book's situations a little too crazy
to be even remotely based in reality. To
those not in the know.it reads like the next
"1984" a catastrophic prediction of
events that will probably never occur.
Perhaps, though, that is Crichton's
real point —to show us uninformed
masses how wrong we are. We live in a
world of science that is quickly changing,
one in which politics, law, and economics
cannot keep up. By understanding the is
sues at hand, perhaps we can bring our
selves to terms with them. In helping us
stay abreast, Crichton seeks to make the
world a better place for those of us
shocked to find out more about the
realms in which we reside.
