## Indie music in the post-O.C. era 
### ADRIAN BISCHOFF KZSU CONTRIBUTING ARTICLE 
"The 0.C." is done, over and off the air — at least
until the syndicated reruns begin, that is. It apparently
ended with a whimper, hut I didn't notice. 1 wasn't aware
of what happened to the characters (according to reli
able sources, things did happen) or if there was even a
plot to begin with (again, reliable sources tell me there
was).
Think back with me to the pre-O.C. era, the dark ages
of television, way back to 2003. Volkswagen was bringing
us Nick Drake's "Pink Moon," Trio's infectious "bah
dah dah"song and "Mr. Blue Sky" by Electric Light Or
chestra. And once a week, "Friends" was telling us "I'll
be there for you."There wasn't much else.
In those pre-O.C. days, the olden days, so to speak,
indie rock was only heard in a few places — in smoky
(pre-smoking ban) backroom clubs filled with hipsters
sporting tight jeans, ironic thrift store shirts, and pur
posely unkempt hair or on the college radio airwaves
with overly knowledgeable, awkward DJs.
Then there was a cultural behemoth. No. not Oprah.
It was "The 0.C." From the time "The 0.C." started air
ing. 1 haven't been able to turn on the TV without hear
ing the Magnetic Fields on a soap commercial or being
informed of Pretty Girls Make Graves' imminent
breakup on Gilmore Girls.
Josh Schwartz and the creative types behind "The
0.C." brought this music to the forefront, with music by
Joseph Arthur, among others, appearing in the first
episode. (You may wonder why I didn't mention the
theme song,"California" by Phantom Planet. I'm trying
to stay away from the indie-as-a-musical-style or indie
as-a-description-of-independence-from-m ajor-labels
argument, and Phantom Planet released its music on
Epic, a major label. Incidentally, at the time they were
recording "California," Phantom Planet's drummer was
the actor Jason Schwartzman. 1 bet you didn't know that
piece of useless music trivia.)
Not only did small-time bands grace "The 0.C."
soundtrack, which was still fairly revolutionary in itself,
but many of the characters were keen on the indie
scene — especially the character of Seth Cohen, whose
bedroom walls were practically a Pitchfork advertise
ment.
I'd be remiss if I didn't credit at least one other source
for indie rock's increased exposure: "Garden State.
Who didn't want to believe Natalie Portman's character
as she emphatically swore that ITie Shins "New Slang
could save someone's life? Ibe soundtrack didn t hurt,
either.
However, it's not just the media. When indie rock
used to tread into popular culture, the attempts had al
ways been met with cries of "sellout, but these objec
tions have slowly diminished. Indie bands are more will
ing to license their music to TV shows, commercials and
movies, realizing that the exposure will allow them to
make a living making music. Fans seem willing to accept
this as part of music in the download era. Still, bands like
Bright Eyes. who. despite being mentioned on ITie

0.C.," never appeared at the show's fictitious club, the
Bait Shop, apparently refuse the commercialization.
lt d be a mistake to say that post-0.C., TV utilizes
mainly indie music, but the situation is looking good, at
least on a handful of shows. "Scrubs" has featured indie
bands in addition to mainstream ones, with Spoon grac
ing the soundtrack and the Polyphonic Spree appearing
live on the show (their gowns being oddly appropriate).
Every week, the "Friday Night Lights" soundtrack is an
chored by Explosions in the Sky; Beulah and Iron &
Wine have also been featured. And characters on
"Gilmore Girls" casually mention bands like My Morn
ing Jacket — there was even an episode where Sonic
Youth and Yo La Tengo were busking on the streets of
Stars I follow. Even more seemingly uptight and serious
shows like "CSI: Miami" occasionally throw in bands
like Mogwai between mainstream selections of U2. De
peche Mode and Nine Inch Nails. When TV episodes
break for commercial, the indie music can still be heard
in the advertisements. Aqueduct plays in the back
ground of Jaguar commercials, Iron & Wine tries to sell
us M&Ms and Cat Power's recently written a song for
Cingular.
These days, many movie soundtracks also feature a
handful of indie bands. The "Thumbsucker" soundtrack
consisted entirely of Elliot Smith and the Polyphonic
Spree; "Wedding Crashers" had the Weakerthans and
the Long Winters. It seems even video games have got
ten into the act;"Stubbs the Zombie" had the cream of
the indie crop (Rogue Wave. Death Cab for Cutie, Clem
Snide) doing covers of 50's songs for its game sound
track.
Clearly, indie rock has endured and flourished in its
various forms. It's yet to be seen if this heightened expo
sure is just a fad that will fade away along with "The
0.C." or if it will persist due to the combined efforts of
Adam Brody and Josh Schwartz.

Adrian Hischoff is one of the aforementioned overly
knowledgeable but awkward college radio DJs. Yon can
hear his show, "I Once was Canadian, Wednesdays from 10
p.m. to midnight on KZSU, 9().l FM or contact him at
