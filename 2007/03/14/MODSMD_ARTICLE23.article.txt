## Choose Your Own Adventure Quest to Spring Break 
### 
Remember those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books you used to
love as a child? Do you miss the thrill of turning pages, wondering what
zany adventures your decision to explore the mysterious cave on Uncle
Howard's ranch will bring? Long to prove once again that your sense of ad
venture and impeccable logic skills never fail? Well, now you can relive the
CYOA experience, only in column form!
That's right, The Daily brings you a special Dead Week treat, sure to pro
vide a nice break in between study sessions. Each of the seven columns
below is separated into three to four sections. The sections are followed by
two options, leading to sections in other columns. Follow the directions and,
depending on the decisions you make, you'll either be handsomely reward
ed or meet a grisly end.
To begin your adventure, go to LISA 1.
