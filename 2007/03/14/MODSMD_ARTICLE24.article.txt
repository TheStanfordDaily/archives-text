## Tragedy of the Listserv commons 
### 
It is hard to imagine Stanford without
email. From Course Work-directed emails
penned by professors to Facebook.com wall
posting alerts. Stanford students rely heavily
— perhaps more heavily than students at other
schools — on their .edu email accounts.
'ITiis reliance has led to an abuse of our
ITSS-controlled Listserv system now known
as Mailman. Because many students are on
scores of such lists, the amount of spam a stu
dent receives — that is. the number of unso
licited and redundant emails — is appalling.
Because there may be a "chat" list as well as
an "announce" list from staff members from
each dorm, students are on a handful of lists
right off the bat as freshmen. In addition, nu
merous clubs and groups maintain their own
specialized lists. Thus, any given student
and particularly one active in extracurricular
affairs — may be on as many as three or four
dozen lists. (Students can see the number they
are on by going to mailman.stanford.edu).
While announcements made for a specific
purpose on a certain list are relevant and in
deed the purpose of the Listservs. the system
is often exploited for mass postings of flyers
or requests on lists with hundreds of members
such as Service4All. the Diaspora, Hollos,
etc. These unrelated emails are an abuse of
the system the list was meant to serve.
Few event organizers or promoters miss
out on the spamming opportunities afforded
by the Listserv system. Service4All, for exam

pic. was created for the posting of service-re
lated information. While the number of stu
dents on that list is a testament to the good in
tentions of Stanford students seeking such op
portunities, the actual number of those events
listed is limited. Instead, the Service4All is
often used to promote speakers, events or
causes which, though important or worthy in
their own right, are not pertinent to the list's
stated purpose.
Every once in a while a student will angri
ly reply to the list after a particularly egre
gious email and the situation will settle down.
Hut the impertinent mass correspondence in
evitably returns.
The Daily as an institution is not exempt.
Last week, our editor sent out an email to the
service list requesting support for special fees
petitions. I le did. at least, explain the mes
sage's relevance to the list by pointing out the
service Ihe Daily provides to the University
community, but this exception proves the
rule. Few other posters attempt such justifica
tions.
The abuse of the Listserv system comes
from students who blindly post their events or
their messages to the lists as advertisements.
While we acknowledge that email via Listserv
may be one of the most effective ways to
reach student inboxes.The Daily strongly dis
courages the use of mailing lists to distribute
messages which do not pertain to the forums'
stated goals.
