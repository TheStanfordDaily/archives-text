LISA I
As you awaken from another night of
deep, peaceful sleep in your luxurious
eggshell-padded twin extra-long,you rub your
blood-shot eyes, stretch your pale arms and
vaguely remember that there is something
you are supposed to do today By "some
thing." you know you mean a responsibility
that cannot be ignored, slept through, or pro
crastinated. Something you cannot simply
choose to avoid. Something you've been deny
ing for at least two weeks now.
And then, roughly ten minutes into your
scalding hot shower.it dawns on you: it's Dead
Week. Maybe it's all of the Monday holidays,
maybe it's the extra-heavy course load, or
maybe it's because February is about a week
short ot a month, but the end of Winter quar
ter always arrives unexpectedly early.
Before you reach the promised land of wet
t-shirts, dry sand, and ocean-damp beach hair,
you have a serious, bollard-filled gauntlet to
run — or. if your current energy level resem
bles mine, to crawl. No matter how you choose
to travel, all roads lead to next Friday and the
Spring Break that follows, and. like Meyer Li
brary. none of them have seen Capital Im
provement since the early sixties.
To study or not to study, that is the ques
tion. The choice, of course, is yours.
•C rack the books like it good Stanford duck
ling (go to KATIE I).
•Procrastinate at the C'ollo like a salmon
swimming downstream (go to A LEX I).
LISA 2
It takes you 30 minutes to find Building
569, Room 1050 (why didn't you think to look
this up before you left your dorm room? Oh
right,you were still trying to finish Chapter 34
— of 60).
Vou take the only remaining seat, be
tween Suzy Student, who has three pencil
cases, two calculators, and an OJ-filled Nal
gene spread in front of her. and Showerless
Sam. who. true to his namesake, seems to
have gone all quarter without washing his
body or his clothes.
You search your bag and come up with one
red pen. two mostly-empty mechanical pen
cils. and the ID card you paid to replace last
week. Suzv Student graciously lends vou an

unused black ballpoint.
The professor distributes his 50 page mas
terpiece. reminds you of the time limit, and
leaves a stack of bluebooks on the table, be
cause he's "sure that many of you will need
more space in order to provide adequate re
sponses to the questions."
I le winks at Suzy on the way out and you
waste five minutes considering the possibility
that their rumored relationship may be true. In
the midst of weighing the evidence, you sud
denly remember the test in front of you. hastily
pledge your honesty on the dotted line, open
the packet, and recognize the first question —
from the first page of ( hapter 35. What now?
•Spend the rest of the time recalling superficial
evidence of the affair, then blackmail your pro
fessor to get your A (go to A LEX 3).
•Ace that test (go to NAV 4).
LISA 3
You haven't felt this ill since the week after
Full Moon on the Quad.
You drag yourself to Vaden, all the while
kicking yourself for last night's decision. Some
things are better left untouched, especially
when you've pushed your body's immune sys
tem to its sleep-deprivation limit.
As you enter the waiting area, a coughing,
sneezing girl beckons you to an empty seat
next to her. while another generously holds
out a sticky magazine. Everyone else appears
much more contagious than you. If you were
not sick before you arrived, you will certainly
be by the time you leave.
After a five minute examination, during
which time you provide a quick synopsis of
your medical history, list your symptoms in
order of excruciating pain, and try not to touch
anything in the room, the nurse informs you
that your hunch was right.
•Its nothing serious As vou skip out the door,
stop to pick up condoms from the SHPRC (go
to NAV3).
•()lt no, vou have only five days to live! (go to
DARREN 4).
