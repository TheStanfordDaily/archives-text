VICKY 1
As you wander up and down the halls of
Green, you hear a crash in a nearby room.
Being the inquisitive student that you are,you
sneak up to the door and see a dark, human
like form standing amidst a haphazard pile of
books.
"The answer has to be here, the formula is
almost complete..." he weeps hopelessly, tear
ing out what's left of his hair. The creature lets
out a loathsome cry and throws himself to the
floor. 1 le begins leafing madly through one of
the fallen books, then another, and another,
mumbling something angrily under his
breath.
Unable to understand his mad ravings,you
tiptoe toward the figure. Still, the only thing
you can make out is something about an im
perative, some metaphysics and a critique of
something pure and reasonable. You try to
get closer, but accidentally trip over a book
lying a few feet away from the beast. An ex
pletive escapes your lips before you can clasp
your hand over your mouth.
The figure spins around and jumps to his
feet. He towers over you. with patches of
greenish skin falling away from his limbs to
reveal rotting muscles. His face is scarred
and his bloodshot eyes pierce through you
like shish kebab skewers. He begins mov
ing forward, reaching out his decaying arm.
You gasp as you realize that before you
stands the zombie of Immanuel Kant.
•Fight Zombie Kant (go to KA TIE 2).
• Try to convince Zombie Kant to help you es
cape (go to NAV I).
VICKY 2
You take Zombie Kant to the CoHo. As
you enter the establishment,you fear that the
presence of a zombie may provoke a commo
tion — perhaps with pitchforks and a stake.
But the coffee-goers remain glued to their
laptops, oblivious to the decaying corpse.
You order two medium coffees and a
Strawberry-Nutella crepe and find an empty
table in the corner. Trying to put the recent
unpleasantness behind you. you ask Kant
about an inconsistency you have recently un
covered in his "Groundwork for the Meta
physics of Morals." but the zombie seems dis

tracted.
"I'm sorry," he tells you, taking a bite of the
crepe. "I can't concentrate on philosophy
right now, there's something 1 need to get off
my chest." Zombie Kant confesses to you that
he's spent the last 20 years living in Green,
hiding in the stacks during the day and roam
ing the hallways at night. He's seen many
things during his nocturnal rounds: silly
pranks, secret meetings, saucy rendezvous.
But nothing can compare to the night of Jan
uary 22,2007:
"I was walking past the Bender Room
when 1 heard laughter coming from inside. 1
assumed it was just another pair of star
crossed lovers, basking in the refuge of the li
brary to keep their shameful lust a secret. But
as I got closer to the door, I realized this was
n't your average rendezvous. I cautiously ap
proached the slightly ajar door and that's
when 1 saw it: Members of SLAC (Stanford
Labor Action Coalition) sat around an oak
table,decked out in pinstriped suits and fedo
ras, smoking Cuban cigars and drinking gin.
'Let Hennessy tremble at a Communist rev
olution,' one yelled.'We have nothing to lose
but our chains.' 'But we have a University to
win!' another chimed in. The uprising is
planned for the last day of Dead Week."
Zombie Kant takes another bite of the
crepe and waits for you to respond.
•Report the zombie's shocking revelation to
The Daily (go to KATIE 3).
•Form a Facebook group in protest of the up
rising (go to KA TIE 4).
VICKY 3
Satisfied with your performance, you pat
yourself on the back, confident that every
thing will turn out fine. You saunter back to
your dorm, humming the tune of Right Said
Fred's "I'm Too Sexy."
When you reach the dorm.you see a figure
clad in black lurking about the premises. You
think nothing of it, at first. But as you ap
proach your room, you notice that the door is
cracked open. You begin to become suspi
cious. You cautiously look inside and scream
as you see the red paint splashed across the
walls. Your furniture is broken, your clothes
have been thrown out the window and
burned, and "Harlot" is written in capital let
ters above your bed. Someone is out to get
you.
•Take your rage out on President Hennessy's

car (go to DARKEN 3).
•Look up potential suspects of the vandalism
on Facebook (go to KATIE 4).
VICKY 4
You decide to take your chances — after
all, you're stronger than an old woman: you
can totally take her on. Armed with your
handy-dandy 50-pound econ textbook and a
love of private property, you attack the
babushka. You rip out passages of Adam
Smith's "The Wealth of Nations," fold them
into ninja stars and cast them at the beast.
But just as the stars are inches away from
the woman, Arrillaga himself bursts into the
CoHo. 1 le pushes the woman out of the way,
putting himself in the line of your attack.
The stars pierce his striking exterior, and he
falls to the ground. You begin to cheer, sure
that you have vanquished your opponent.
Unfortunately, he's wearing a 24-carat
gold breast plate under his suit, rendering
your stars nonfatal. He gets up and brushes
the dust off his Armani jacket. You need a dif
ferent approach.
You try to reason with him. But in the mid
dle of your brilliant oratory, Arrillaga begins
reaching for something in the inside pocket of
his jacket. You duck under a table. As you
timidly look out from your makeshift fort,
you see that, instead of pulling out a gun, Ar
rillaga is holding a large wad of $100 dollar
bills. He approaches you with the money and
a wry grin.

end, we're all after the same thing. I'm sure
we can work out some kind of deal." He of

starting salary, and the respect of every man.

you stand for. but by God. that new Ferrari

coffee. You realize you've just sold your soul.

As you wander up and down the halls of
Green, you hear a crash in a nearby room.
Being the inquisitive student that you are,you
sneak up to the door and see a dark, human
like form standing amidst a haphazard pile of
books.
"The answer has to be here, the formula is
almost complete..." he weeps hopelessly, tear
ing out what's left of his hair. The creature lets
out a loathsome cry and throws himself to the
floor. 1 le begins leafing madly through one of
the fallen books, then another, and another,
mumbling something angrily under his
breath.
Unable to understand his mad ravings,you
tiptoe toward the figure. Still, the only thing
you can make out is something about an im
perative, some metaphysics and a critique of
something pure and reasonable. You try to
get closer, but accidentally trip over a book
lying a few feet away from the beast. An ex
pletive escapes your lips before you can clasp
your hand over your mouth.
The figure spins around and jumps to his
feet. He towers over you. with patches of
greenish skin falling away from his limbs to
reveal rotting muscles. His face is scarred
and his bloodshot eyes pierce through you
like shish kebab skewers. He begins mov
ing forward, reaching out his decaying arm.
You gasp as you realize that before you
stands the zombie of Immanuel Kant.
•Fight Zombie Kant (go to KA TIE 2).
• Try to convince Zombie Kant to help you es
cape (go to NAV I).
VICKY 2
You take Zombie Kant to the CoHo. As
you enter the establishment,you fear that the
presence of a zombie may provoke a commo
tion — perhaps with pitchforks and a stake.
But the coffee-goers remain glued to their
laptops, oblivious to the decaying corpse.
You order two medium coffees and a
Strawberry-Nutella crepe and find an empty
table in the corner. Trying to put the recent
unpleasantness behind you. you ask Kant
about an inconsistency you have recently un
covered in his "Groundwork for the Meta
physics of Morals." but the zombie seems dis

tracted.
"I'm sorry," he tells you, taking a bite of the
crepe. "I can't concentrate on philosophy
right now, there's something 1 need to get off
my chest." Zombie Kant confesses to you that
he's spent the last 20 years living in Green,
hiding in the stacks during the day and roam
ing the hallways at night. He's seen many
things during his nocturnal rounds: silly
pranks, secret meetings, saucy rendezvous.
But nothing can compare to the night of Jan
uary 22,2007:
"I was walking past the Bender Room
when 1 heard laughter coming from inside. 1
assumed it was just another pair of star
crossed lovers, basking in the refuge of the li
brary to keep their shameful lust a secret. But
as I got closer to the door, I realized this was
n't your average rendezvous. I cautiously ap
proached the slightly ajar door and that's
when 1 saw it: Members of SLAC (Stanford
Labor Action Coalition) sat around an oak
table,decked out in pinstriped suits and fedo
ras, smoking Cuban cigars and drinking gin.
'Let Hennessy tremble at a Communist rev
olution,' one yelled.'We have nothing to lose
but our chains.' 'But we have a University to
win!' another chimed in. The uprising is
planned for the last day of Dead Week."
Zombie Kant takes another bite of the
crepe and waits for you to respond.

The Daily (go to KATIE 3).

Satisfied with your performance, you pat
yourself on the back, confident that every
thing will turn out fine. You saunter back to
your dorm, humming the tune of Right Said
Fred's "I'm Too Sexy."
When you reach the dorm.you see a figure
clad in black lurking about the premises. You
think nothing of it, at first. But as you ap
proach your room, you notice that the door is
cracked open. You begin to become suspi
cious. You cautiously look inside and scream
as you see the red paint splashed across the
walls. Your furniture is broken, your clothes
have been thrown out the window and
burned, and "Harlot" is written in capital let
ters above your bed. Someone is out to get
you.
•Take your rage out on President Hennessy's

car (go to DARKEN 3).
•Look up potential suspects of the vandalism
on Facebook (go to KATIE 4).
VICKY 4
You decide to take your chances — after
all, you're stronger than an old woman: you
can totally take her on. Armed with your
handy-dandy 50-pound econ textbook and a
love of private property, you attack the
babushka. You rip out passages of Adam
Smith's "The Wealth of Nations," fold them
into ninja stars and cast them at the beast.
But just as the stars are inches away from
the woman, Arrillaga himself bursts into the
CoHo. 1 le pushes the woman out of the way,
putting himself in the line of your attack.
The stars pierce his striking exterior, and he
falls to the ground. You begin to cheer, sure
that you have vanquished your opponent.
