Unburdened by the looming specter of fi
nals. you gallivant along White Plazas sterile,
concrete expanse towards CoHo. thoughts set
on a creamy latte prepared especially for you
by that hot male barista.
All of a sudden, your self-absorption is in
terrupted by a maniacal fit of laughter emanat
ing from the vicinity of Subway, Jamba Juice,
and Peet's Coffee. Long experience on The
I arm alerts you immediately to the source of
such cacophonous cachinnation. Uh oh — it's
every avid CoHo junkie's mortal enemy: the
evil minion of capitalism, the CORPORATE
WHORE!
The first thing that comes to mind is that the
Corporate Whore, for whatever twisted reason,
looks strangely like our university's most lovable
benefactor: John Arrillaga. The monster stands
hunchbacked and monocled,brandishing a gild
ed cane in your face, bills flowing out his every
orifice. With an obnoxious sneer, he rounds on
your diminutive person and bellows, "Robber
barons, I lO!" And. directing his billion-dollar
cane at your face, he blasts a jet stream of Texas
gold all over your poor hipster self.
But before the monster has a chance to im
prison you in the shackles of his capitalist
greed, something — a realization, maybe —
begins to dawn on you. I lead spinning, you
suddenly remember what brand of coffee the
Col lo brews; you think of all the overpriced vi
tamin-rich juices they stock; you remember
puking up a slice of their god awful pizza last
Wednesday (granted, it was after dropping by
EBI ). Wait a minute, this can't be — your
beloved CoHo is nothing but a capitalist
stronghold masked under a facade of yupster
ism.
The CoHo? More like...the Corporate
wHOre!! You've been duped all along, you
naive little s(xialite. Don't you feel sixteen
again? Now what?
• Face your inner demons and battle the Corpo
rate wHOre, capitalist greed incarnate! (Go to
KATIf.
•Mortified. confused, and ashamed, von hide in

a straggly nearby bush (go to DA RRENI).

Scanning the room, you make a quick check
of the building's structural integrity — stress
es, strains, and other rather fascinating tensor
quantities. You ascertain, by some MacGyver
like insight of engineering prowess (this is
Stanford, after all), that the north wall is vul
nerable to certain highly specific chemical re
actions of, how shall we say, an explosive na
ture. But this is no weapons lab, it's a study
room, and you need to make a friggin' bomb!
You scrounge around in your pockets and
pull out a wad of chewed gum. toothpaste,
dental floss, and a blue Durex wrapper — oh,
what magical luck! Working rapidly, you toss
the wrapper into the rubbish basket, take gum
and toothpaste in hand, mix in a little bodily
fluid here and there and stuff it all into your
shoe. Voila! You've got yourself a handy little
bomb, whose production process cannot be
detailed in full, for fear that, if publicized, py
romaniacal delinquents across the globe
would get baked and start detonating their
parents' minivans at will.
Setting the shoe-bomb down by the north
wall, you make another quick scan, and then,
without a moment's hesitation, you reach up
and tear down a bundle of pulsing high-voltage
wires running conspicuously across the ceiling.
With an assured sweep of the wrist, you unite
wire to bomb, detonating the infernal device.
A loud noise ensues, and the wall crumbles
to the ground. You are MacGyver.so you come
out unscathed.excepting an endearing residue
of soot that settles on your snout.
Triumphant, you step through the gaping
hole where wall once stood and into The Bub
ble outside. Surveying the lush Stanford
streetscape, you ruminate on your newfound
freedom. It's finals week, so you have deci
sions to make — decisions*.
•Screw finals — hotwire a 5-Sure and drive the
heck away (go to DARREN2).
•Get a move on! Rush off to your next final (go
to LISA 2).

You bust open the office door with a well

I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUM

No response.
"Oh. is that so?" 1 lis eyes are glued to the
Facebook, and he doesn't look up. "You know
about my field work in Siberia, do you?"
D'oh.Try again.
"No. professor." you reply.composing your
self. "You know very well why I'm here. You
know exactly who I am. I've come to blackmail
you." Righteous, dude.
ITie weasel snorts and swivels on his chair
to face you. Wiping sweat from his glistening
brow, he takes a long, hard look at your face.
You feel yourself turning to stone.
"You reprobate," he sneers. "So it's you.
huh. I know everything you know, and guess
what? I don't give two shits worth a dime. And
you know why?" His stubby middle finger
shoves a thick wire frame up the bridge of his
nose, inadvertently Hipping you the bird. "Be
cause I m a tenured motherbleeping professor.
Whatcha' gonna do,sonny boy?" And he starts
outright ROFLing in his chair!
But you came prepared,give or take an ini
tial blunder or two."Look,buddy. I'll take this
to University PD, and let me tell you: Those
goons don't mess around. I know you've got
I lennessy and Brav-dawg all wrapped up. but
these guys...well...let 's just say they're a little bit
restless. Ever since we undergrads started buy
ing bike lights, they've been chomping at the
bit looking for new crimes to fight. I've got dirt
on you. buddy,and the SI JPD is gonna jump on
it like white on rice."
The lout throws his hands up and concedes:
Don't bring the charges upwith the SUPD.and
he 11 see to it that you get 'A's for life. You got
what you came for. but then again, this black
mail thing is kinda fun!
•Settle for that 4.0, hahy (go to NAV4).
•Tush your advantage and play hardhal! with

Unburdened by the looming specter of fi
nals. you gallivant along White Plazas sterile,
concrete expanse towards CoHo. thoughts set
on a creamy latte prepared especially for you
by that hot male barista.
All of a sudden, your self-absorption is in
terrupted by a maniacal fit of laughter emanat
ing from the vicinity of Subway, Jamba Juice,
and Peet's Coffee. Long experience on The
I arm alerts you immediately to the source of
such cacophonous cachinnation. Uh oh — it's
every avid CoHo junkie's mortal enemy: the
evil minion of capitalism, the CORPORATE
WHORE!
The first thing that comes to mind is that the
Corporate Whore, for whatever twisted reason,
looks strangely like our university's most lovable
benefactor: John Arrillaga. The monster stands
hunchbacked and monocled,brandishing a gild
ed cane in your face, bills flowing out his every
orifice. With an obnoxious sneer, he rounds on
your diminutive person and bellows, "Robber
barons, I lO!" And. directing his billion-dollar
cane at your face, he blasts a jet stream of Texas
gold all over your poor hipster self.
But before the monster has a chance to im
prison you in the shackles of his capitalist
greed, something — a realization, maybe —
begins to dawn on you. I lead spinning, you
suddenly remember what brand of coffee the
Col lo brews; you think of all the overpriced vi
tamin-rich juices they stock; you remember
puking up a slice of their god awful pizza last
Wednesday (granted, it was after dropping by
EBI ). Wait a minute, this can't be — your
beloved CoHo is nothing but a capitalist
stronghold masked under a facade of yupster
ism.
The CoHo? More like...the Corporate
wHOre!! You've been duped all along, you
naive little s(xialite. Don't you feel sixteen
again? Now what?
• Face your inner demons and battle the Corpo
rate wHOre, capitalist greed incarnate! (Go to
KATIf.
•Mortified. confused, and ashamed, von hide in

a straggly nearby bush (go to DA RRENI).

Scanning the room, you make a quick check
of the building's structural integrity — stress
es, strains, and other rather fascinating tensor
quantities. You ascertain, by some MacGyver
like insight of engineering prowess (this is
Stanford, after all), that the north wall is vul
nerable to certain highly specific chemical re
actions of, how shall we say, an explosive na
ture. But this is no weapons lab, it's a study
room, and you need to make a friggin' bomb!
You scrounge around in your pockets and
pull out a wad of chewed gum. toothpaste,
dental floss, and a blue Durex wrapper — oh,
what magical luck! Working rapidly, you toss
the wrapper into the rubbish basket, take gum
and toothpaste in hand, mix in a little bodily
fluid here and there and stuff it all into your
shoe. Voila! You've got yourself a handy little
bomb, whose production process cannot be
detailed in full, for fear that, if publicized, py
romaniacal delinquents across the globe
would get baked and start detonating their
parents' minivans at will.
Setting the shoe-bomb down by the north
wall, you make another quick scan, and then,
without a moment's hesitation, you reach up
and tear down a bundle of pulsing high-voltage
wires running conspicuously across the ceiling.
With an assured sweep of the wrist, you unite
wire to bomb, detonating the infernal device.
A loud noise ensues, and the wall crumbles
to the ground. You are MacGyver.so you come
out unscathed.excepting an endearing residue
of soot that settles on your snout.
Triumphant, you step through the gaping
hole where wall once stood and into The Bub
ble outside. Surveying the lush Stanford
streetscape, you ruminate on your newfound
freedom. It's finals week, so you have deci
sions to make — decisions*.
•Screw finals — hotwire a 5-Sure and drive the
heck away (go to DARREN2).
•Get a move on! Rush off to your next final (go
to LISA 2).

You bust open the office door with a well
placed right foot and shriek wildly,"Professor
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUM

MER!"
No response.
"Oh. is that so?" 1 lis eyes are glued to the
Facebook, and he doesn't look up. "You know
about my field work in Siberia, do you?"
D'oh.Try again.
"No. professor." you reply.composing your
self. "You know very well why I'm here. You
know exactly who I am. I've come to blackmail
you." Righteous, dude.
ITie weasel snorts and swivels on his chair
to face you. Wiping sweat from his glistening
brow, he takes a long, hard look at your face.
You feel yourself turning to stone.
"You reprobate," he sneers. "So it's you.
huh. I know everything you know, and guess
what? I don't give two shits worth a dime. And
you know why?" His stubby middle finger
shoves a thick wire frame up the bridge of his
nose, inadvertently Hipping you the bird. "Be
cause I m a tenured motherbleeping professor.
Whatcha' gonna do,sonny boy?" And he starts
outright ROFLing in his chair!
But you came prepared,give or take an ini
tial blunder or two."Look,buddy. I'll take this
to University PD, and let me tell you: Those
goons don't mess around. I know you've got
I lennessy and Brav-dawg all wrapped up. but
these guys...well...let 's just say they're a little bit

on you. buddy,and the SI JPD is gonna jump on
