You stumble through the bushes
and emerge on a horrifying sight. On
the steps of the Mausoleum, you rec
ognize several prominent school ad
ministrators — including recently
excommunicated Housing Viceroy
Jane Camarillo and Tsarina Howe —
dressed in black robes and chanting
satanic incantations. One man opens
his robe to reveal a suit of armor
enameled in 100-carat gold, with
Wyrd symbols and dead languages
etched in his shield. You can't see his
face, but the torches reflect flames off
his glasses and bald pate.
"We worship you, oh cruel, holy.
Opulent One," he says. "We lay a
thankful financial sacrifice at your
awe-full doorstep." A couple of un
derpaid cafeteria workers push a
wheelbarrow filled with million-dol
lar bills towards the giant doorway of
the Mausoleum.
A horrific screeching moan erupts
from the ground as the doorway
swings open and a gigantic zombie
hand-thing emerges in a puff of zom
bie smog. "EN DOW MENT!!!" it
gurgles, devouring the wheelbarrow
and the underpaid workers whole.
"Golly, what symbolism!" you
think.
•Report the ritual to The Daily (go to
KATIE 3).
•Blackmail the faculty involved with
the help of your trusty camera phone
(goto ALEX 3).

Suddenly, you find yourself sur
rounded by five police cars and a bike
cop. The bike cop, a compensating
boot camp washout named Bobby
"Bogart" McGruder, screams,
"Lower your weapons, maggot!"
"1 haven't got any weapons," you
say. "I'm a pacifist. And a coward,
too!"
"Law-breaking scum," mumbles
"Bogart" McGruder. who visited the
750 Pub earlier for some undercover
work. He rummages through your
pockets and pulls out your i Pod Nano.
"1 knew it! This guy's wired!"
"SI IAME!" yell the other police
men.
"But I wasn't even listening to it,"
you say.
"Technically, it's illegal to even
think about iPods." shrugs "Bogart"

McGruder. "We don't create the laws,
we just enforce the meaningless ones."
"You guys gave my parents a park
ing ticket when they were visiting for
Alumni Weekend! And you still
haven't found my stolen laptop! The
Stanford police are useless!"
"Ssshhhh! You'll hurt their feel
ings!" whispers "Bogart" McGruder.
but it's too late. The other policemen
have already emerged from their po
lice cars into adolescent crying fits.
"How come nobody likes us?" they
cry. In the ensuing confusion, you opt
t0...
•Call your trusty sidekick (go to NAV
3).
•Pay outstanding parking tickets as a
plea bargain (go to KAT 3).

You've had one hell of a time,cow
boy. Since coming to Stanford, you've
broken every law of god, man and
tree. You've covered your wall with
stolen palm fronds, stocked your re
frigerator with leftovers pinched
from Row house kitchens, jogged
around Campus Loop wearing noth
ing but a torn sock and a pair of 40s.
crashed a stolen golf cart into a wed
ding party, engaged in a heated de
bate with the Hoover Institution over
the role of elitist douchebags in mod
ern politics (fisticuffs ensued) and led
an unsuccessful and highly farcical
coup d'etat of the ASSU. You've bro
ken hearts and opened minds.
Unfortunately, after starting out as
a lovable rebel figure, you've become
all preachy and self-important. The
University cannot allow you to live.
Vice-Premier Boardman brings you
into the Fundamental Standard Re
view Board over trumped-up library
charges — you rented "The Trans
formers:The Movie" from Media Mi
crotext three years ago and forgot to
return it. The trial is swift, the justice
questionable: You're summarily ex
pelled from Stanford and forbidden
from attending any future reunions,
though your verdict comes with a free
Alumni Association membership and
a return envelope which reads
"Thank You for Your Donation!"
next to a happy face emoticon.
Overwhelmed, you decide to
enjoy Spring Break and go to the hap
piest place on earth: Rosarito, where
the tequila flows like watered-down
water and the last thing you remem
ber is waking up. 'Ihere, you meet a
wealthy heir/heiress to a billion-dol
lar industrial fortune, who seduces

you with science and takes you to
his/her tiny island in the middle of the
Pacific, where the monkey butlers
serve you fresh mint julep, the satel
lite TV cuts out all non-beer-related
commercials, and you discover a
brand new hobby hunting the most
dangerous game of all: man.
YOU WIN!

It's finally time to throw that party
you've been planning for years: the
Flapper/Dandy Fop Roaring Twen
ties Lost Generation Cocktail Box
Social, where gents dress like Scott,
ladies dress like Zelda, kooky best
friends drink like Ernest and every
body ends up dead or in the mental
hospital.
"But we want to make the girls
dress slutty and drink till we're hot,"
say all your male friends.
"But we want to dress slutty and
drink till our boyfriends are hot." say
all your female friends.
Blast the oafs of this uncultured
generation! You compromise by re
placing your Gershwin soundtrack
with a hyphy mix composed by your
hipster friend, who assures you hyphy
is totally stupid. The party's going
great until someone pulls the fire
alarm.
"It wasn't us!" insists a charmingly
self-deprecating frat boy wearing a
charmingly self-deprecating shirt ad
vertising the "Charmingly Self-Dep
recating Fraternity Party."
"I don't think it was us ..." mum
bles a beefy frat boy in a wifebeater.
stumbling over the beer can he just
crushed against his forehead.
"Where am I?" asks another frat
boy, wearing a kimono and a head
band with twelve self-applied sake
marks.
"At least 1 kept my dignity," you
say, straightening your monocle.
• You hear police sirens in the distance
(goto DARREN2).
•You see some freslunen and feel ex
tremely self-confident (go to NAV4).
