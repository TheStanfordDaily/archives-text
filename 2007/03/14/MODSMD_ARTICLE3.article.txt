# Women in home stretch
## Two-seed Card tackle 15-seed Idaho State at Maples Pavilion 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
After a 28-4 record. Pacific-10 Conference
regular-season title (17-1 record) and Pac-10
Tournament title, the No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team feels right at home as an
NCAA two-seed — and for good reason: The
Cardinal begins a long-awaited run to the elu
sive Final Four this Saturday in Maples Pavilion,
taking on 15-seed Idaho State.
After three straight years of losing in the
Elite Eight — last year in a 62-59 buzzer-beater
against Louisiana State — senior center
Brooke Smith certainly feels the "sense of ur
gency" for Stanford to prove that this is "the
year."
"1 think [going to the Final Four] is still the
goal of our team." she said. "Obviously, we know
that we can't really talk about Final Four be
cause we have games that lead up to that, so our
focus is definitely going to be on Idaho State
and winning that game on Saturday."
The Bengals are much of a mystery for the
Cardinal. Stanford head coach I'ara Van-
Derveer said she doesn't really know much
about the team, but saw them on tape in their
73-50 loss to Brigham Young (an 11 -seed in the
Greensboro region). (The Cougars defeated
Stanford during the preseason in a 55-52 WNIT
upset.)
Idaho State has proven a force in the Big Sky
Conference, finishing with a 17-13 record. The
Bengals recently wrapped up the conference
tournament title with an 84-78 win over North
ern Arizona.
"They were the No. 2 seed in their tourna
ment. but they won it, so we know they're com-

ing in on a high, and we know we've
just got to do our job." VanDerveer
said.
Idaho State was led in the title match
by Natalie Doma. who had 24 points
and 16 rebounds. It was the 24th dou
ble-double of the season for the junior,
who averages 21.8 points and 12.2 re
bounds per game — more than any
member of the Cardinal. Junior Andrea
Lightfoot and senior Jeni Boesel aver
age 17.6 and 13.6 points, respectively.
The stats may sound overwhelming,
but the Cardinal is confident in its own
play.
"I think that at this point in the sea
son you concentrate on what you do;
not to say that we don't do scouting —
we do scouting — but we're not going
to change up what we're doing," Van-
Derveer said. "Here's our team; here's
what we've got."
What the Cardinal has is C'andice
Wiggins. Returning after missing the
last two games of the regular season
due to a hamstring injury (which fol
lowed an earlier ankle injury), the jun
ior guard led Stanford throughout the
Pac-10 Tournament and was named
tourney MVP. In three straight games
she averaged 32.3 minutes and 21.7
points, including an amazing eight
three-pointers against Southern Cali

fornia in the semifinal match.
"1 always feel 100 percent," Wiggins
said when asked about her status after
a strenuous weekend. "I love playing,
and whenever I do, I forget about any
ankle or hamstring injury."
Still, off the court, Wiggins (and
probably VanDerveer even moreso) is
making sure she stays healthy. Wrap
ping and keeping her hamstring warm,
she said it "is feeling good," and be
lieves she's getting her strength back.
As for the ankle, the swelling and pain
have subsided.
"The feeling of winning the Pac-10
Tournament was so great [that my
body] was fine, I wasn't in pain," Wig
gins said. "I was tired because I had
been playing a lot — three games —
but 1 felt good."
Good news for VanDerveer, who
said that heading into Monday's selec
tion show, her top priority was having
everyone healthy. With sophomore
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and freshman
J J Hones out for the season, the 21-
year Stanford coach said she'll rely on
her "jumble lineup" of Wiggins, Smith
(13.4 points, 7.6 rebounds per game),
sophomore guard Jillian Harmon,
freshman center Jayne Appel (13.4
points, 7.4 rebounds) and senior center
Kristen Newlin (7.9 rebounds) — but

there's room for contributions all
around.
"We have a lot of versatility, and de
pending on who we play, depending on
what we need. I think people are just
going to come out and play really hard
and play really well," VanDerveer said.
"There are certain things you have to
do no matter who you play."
Although taking it one game at a
time, the Cardinal is somewhat looking
ahead to its second- and third-round
prospects. Should Stanford win on Sat
urday. it would face the winner of
seven-seed Old Dominion (a "great
tradition in women's basketball," ac
cording to VanDerveer; the Cardinal
lost to the Monarchs,B3-82 in overtime,
in its 1997 trip to the Final Four) and
10-seed Florida State.
Awaiting Stanford farther down the
bracket could be three-seed LSU — in
what would be a Sweet 16 rematch of
last year — and top-seed Connecticut
in the Regional Final in Fresno, Calif.
"It's a great bracket," VanDerveer
said. "What I'm excited about is that
we have great fans here at Stanford
and in the Bay Area, and our fans get to
see super basketball with these eight
teams coming in."
Describing how the team has been
building momentum after what some

may call a slow start — the Cardinal
was ranked fourth in the preseason
poll, dropped as low as 15th and has
climbed back to fifth — Smith said the
team has been "working hard, and
we're trying extend it every day that we
can" with further wins.
VanDerveer is confident that,
should all the pieces come together.
Stanford will return to the Elite Hight
in Fresno, and hopefully make a trip to
Cleveland soon after.
"We have our opportunity." she
said. "It's up to us to play really well,
and if the seed holds, we could be play
ing in Fresno. We're just going to have
to do our thing, play really hard and
play really well.
"It's all about how you play, and
teams being healthy and wanting to
win for each other," VanDerveer con
tinued. "It's about how hard Brooke is
going to play for Candice and how hard
Candice is going to play for Brooke at
this point, and for the rest of the team."
Stanford faces Idaho State at 1:30
p.m. (or half an hour after the previous
game) this Saturday in Maples Pavil
ion. a site for the NCAA first and sec
ond rounds.
