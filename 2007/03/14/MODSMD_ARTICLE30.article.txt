KATIE 1
Because you are hip to what library
is best, you grab a latte at Moonbeans
and hunker down for a night of inten
sive studying at Green. As you are
frantically re-reading chapters, mak
ing outlines and going over your notes,
the magical fish in the magical clocks
rotates away The crazy bearded man
comes on the loudspeaker, but so fo
cused are you, you don't hear his muf
fled, too-long message. The lights
flicker, but once again you are too con
centrated on the words in front of you
to notice.
When you get up to go to the bath
room — the latte has made it through
your system — you are surprised to
find no one is around and all the over
head lights are off. You check your
goldfishy friend: It's 2 a.m. You are
most definitely locked into Green.
Suddenly you imagine yourself as Ben
Stiller in "Night at the Museum," or
even maybe as Tom 1 lanks in the
opening of "The Da Vinci Code." As
feature-length Hollywood films in
volving large lonely buildings and their
lonely workers run through your
brain, you decide t0...
•Explore the building (go to VICK Y1).
•Bust the licck out, foo' (go to ALEX
2).

So the Immanuel Kant zombie leg
end was true! You had always thought
he was just a funky piece of Stanford
lore, like how you were told as a fresh
man that Stanford squirrels are black
because they escaped from an on
campus squirrel lab. Muttering some
thing about Hume and all his damn
followers, Kant starts to walk towards
you, backing you into a corner of the
Lane Reading Room.
Luckily, he is an old man zombie
and is advancing slowly You dart out
of the way and while he sluggishly real
izes you have moved, you frantically
rack your brain for ideas. You think
back to your philosophy 111UM fresh
man year and what you learned about
Kant, but all you can vaguely recall is
an awkward joke from your professor

about how you "Kant" understand
him. Of all the course material to actu
ally apply to your life, how could you
have known that eighteenth century
Enlightenment philosophers would
have mortal implications? Did he be
lieve in God? Something about free
dom, maybe?
You feel something wet on your
shoulder, and you realize he has put a
green hand on the nape of your neck. You
grab his fingers and twirl around, but as
you do. you unknowingly rip his arm off
As you stand, facing him, still holding his
dripping appendage, he grows another
limb right in front of you. Two-armed
once again, he saunters towards you, this
time a little faster than before. Panic
stricken, you decide t0...
•Slay the beast (go to KAT2)!
• Try to reason with it (go to NAV2).

You realize that there is only one
place where your voice will he heard,
one place where you will be able to tri
umphantly share your knowledge with
the rest of Stanford's student body —
you decide to write an editorial in The
Daily about this newsworthy gem. As
you race through your dorm lounge to
your room, you turn down both your
friends' pleas to partake in a Beirut
tournament and your crush's invitation
to watch a movie, alone, in his/her sin
gle room. You are more focused.direct
ed and passionate than you have ever
been before. You get a latte from the
new Boyds coffee latte maker down
stairs. race to your room and spend the
next six hours frantically typing away
through the night.
This is big news — blue whale-big
news. You want to be descriptive yet ac
curate. persuasive yet not inflammato
ry. You want to tell the people what you
know, but ultimately let them judge for
themselves. After three false starts, five
drafts, and hours of editing, you submit
the most perfect, mind-bogglingly in
triguing editorial that Ibe Daily has
ever received.
The next morning you proudly
check your article online, only to find
that 4(X) fellow undergrads have al
ready responded, some attacking
every possible angle,sentence and nu
ance of your piece, others praising you
as an editorial god. Who knew you
would become the eye of the mael

strom? You then...
•Leverage your newfound notoriety to
become campus celebrity (go to DAK
KEN 4).
•Write Hennessy (or other administra
tors) series of angry anonymous letters
(goto DARREN3).

As you're surfing Face hook for the
third time that day, the news feed in
forms you that one of your good friends
has just changed her profile pic. You
click on her and then peruse a new
photo album she posted. You see an ac
quaintance of yours in her pictures, so
next you click on her, then on her
boyfriend's, his roommate's and his fel
low band member's profiles. But then,
out of the blue, a flashing ad on the left
side of the page catches your eye. Sud
denly you realize that the ad has your
face on it. in fact your favorite picture of
yourself. Underneath your beautiful
smiling gaze are written the words,
"You are the hottest person on Face
book. 1 would know. Friends? — Mark
Zuckerberg." You are simultaneously
giddy at his high flattery and a little
sketched out.
Naturally, you immediately check
out his Facebook profile. But as you
are looking at his pictures, you realize
that maybe, with his Facebook pow
ers that be. he monitors his own site
and knows who visits his own page.
Does he know what pictures you
have already looked at? Is it creepy if
you look at them all? Or would he ex
pect that? After considering the pros
and cons, you decide that getting to
know a I larvard-whiz who thinks you
are the most good-looking person on
Facebook couldn't hurt. You decide
t0...
•Friend liim/confirm liis friend request

•Poke him. Poke the Zuck. (go to
KAT 5).
