Now insisting you call him K-Man.
the slightly rancid (and overly fond of
long Germanic titles) Kant, is now in
tent on dragging you to his zombie
family reunion. Said reunion is being
held amongst the statues in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden.This is strange.
(in fact, it's all so strange that I sug
gest you give up reading this ridiculous
"Choose Your Own Adventure" story
and go find a lonely dark corner to sit
in. whilst contemplating the miserable
failure that passes for your life.)
Upon meeting them, you discover
that the Kants are an unusual family
(not least because they. too,are the liv
ing dead). As soon as he sees you Papa
Kant immediately inquires as to what
your favorite Biblical passage is and
then offers to show you his hand-craft
ed riding saddle.
Somewhat confused by this juxta
position you turn to Mama Kant only
to find that she has squeezed her
(abundant) rotting flesh into a leather
cat suit and is holding a riding crop
which she is flicking nonchalantly
against "The Gates of Hell. 'Then. star
ing at your belly, she asks whether she's
going to be a Grandmother Kant.
Aghast, you turn to the K-Man to
demand an explanation. He suggests
coffee. You...

Pulling out your first edition of
"Critique of Pure Reason," you draw a

that time spent wearing black and
reading philosophy to good use. Deftly
weaving analytic and synthetic propo
sitions, you insist Kant has a Categori
cal Imperative to set you free. If only
your TA could hear you now.
Zombie Kant looks at you slightly
puzzled. He then explains that the
whole philosophy thing was just a joke
and most of it was written whilst jacked
up on heroin, in between wild Konigs
berg-nights out with the boys.
As you try and integrate this
groundbreaking insight into the true

nature of Enlightenment philosophy,
you notice Kant has started sweating
and is glancing around nervously. In
quiring as to what is ailing the intellec
tual giant you learn that he's in with
drawal and in desperate need of a hit.
Pointing out that EBF 1 lappy Hour

to go cold turkey. He is unhappy. Very

ing at your belly, she asks whether she's
going to be a Grandmother Kant.
Aghast, you turn to the K-Man to
demand an explanation. He suggests
coffee. You...
•Go yet coffee with Kant (go to VICKY

•Slay the beast! (go to KAT2).

Pulling out your first edition of
"Critique of Pure Reason," you draw a
deep breath and finally begin to put all
that time spent wearing black and
reading philosophy to good use. Deftly
weaving analytic and synthetic propo
sitions, you insist Kant has a Categori
cal Imperative to set you free. If only
your TA could hear you now.
Zombie Kant looks at you slightly
puzzled. He then explains that the
whole philosophy thing was just a joke
and most of it was written whilst jacked
up on heroin, in between wild Konigs
berg-nights out with the boys.
As you try and integrate this
groundbreaking insight into the true

nature of Enlightenment philosophy,
you notice Kant has started sweating
and is glancing around nervously. In
quiring as to what is ailing the intellec
tual giant you learn that he's in with
drawal and in desperate need of a hit.
Pointing out that EBF 1 lappy Hour
was yesterday you tell your flesh-drip
ping companion that he's going to have
to go cold turkey. He is unhappy. Very
unhappy. Very, very unhappy. Very, very,
very unhappy. Very, very, very, very un
happy. Very, very, very. very, very unhap

After a series of appropriate misad
ventures that account for any continu
ity errors, you finally find yourself
alone in a dimly lit Memorial Church
with a trusty sidekick and some recent
ly acquired condoms.
Slightly out of breath from your es
capades.skin gleaming in the flickering
candlelight, you gaze at each other,and
smile.
"You know, I've always felt you and
I could be more than sidekicker and
sidekickee." you say, edging closer.

Finally the hard work and the
"sketchily macking" on a freshman
pay off. You become a graduate stu
dent.
A world hitherto unknown to you,
grad school offers wonders that your
tiny, insignificant, worthless under
graduate mind can barely compre
hend. But don't worry, it'll grow on
you.
Soon the obsessive fixation with
free food seems less like a fixated ob
session. You realize that rather than
being a demonstration of the desper
ate poverty you have volunteered
yourself into, scurrying around for free
food is a demonstration of your superi
or hunter-gatherer qualities (which
will make you a better
husband/wife/sex slave).
Although you will never have sex
again (until you are forced to do so by
a transvestite humpbacked evil Russ
ian princess) you swiftly realize this is
not a problem, since you have sudden
ly become slightly unclean and com
pletely undesirable.
Superior intelligence and that
strange squint (which you developed
one night, after working late on a PWR
paper in Meyer library ) now allows
you to look menacingly at the young
'uns.
Of course, the considerably more
attractive, soon to be more successful
and much more socially adept young
uns aren't so much menaced as they
are amused. And sick of your constant
pathetic whining in your Daily column
about how your life sucks.
YOU LOSE.
