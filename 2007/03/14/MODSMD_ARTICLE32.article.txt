Dodging blasts of oil fired by the
irate multibillionaire, a stream of pe
troleum spews into your mouth. It
tastes familiar, you realize, like Friday
night pregames or that smell that
lingers on your uncle's breath — wait a
minute, this isn't oil, this is Popov
vodka home-distilled through a Brita
filter! The distinction in taste is hard to
grasp, but years of row house progres
sives have left you with a discerning
palette for alcoholic masochism.
You dive into the CoHo's door and
as you duck and weave between
greasy-haired film TAs and Teach for
America interviewees, a well-aimed
shot of the liquid gets in your eye. tem
porarily blinding you. As you wipe it
out. Arrillaga removes the lifelike
mask he was wearing, revealing a face
with more wrinkles than The Daily has
typos per page. It is not our beloved
Rich Uncle Pennybags at all,but an old
Russian peasant woman! With surpris
ing adroitness,she flings herself toward
you and begins pounding you over the
head.screaming,'"Long live the Gener
al Secretariat, long live Stalin!"
By god. the communists were be
hind capitalism the whole time! Wild
ly, you reflect back on that last Slav-
Dom party, when a drunken Theme
Assistant revealed that the last step in
the glorious communist revolution
was to support a capitalist system so
all-encompassing that popular cul
ture eventually consumes itself out of
greed and topples into blissful state
controlled economy. It seems so obvi
ous now.
Your first instinct is to update the
Wikipedia entry on Lenin, but there's
no time for that now — the old lady is
rapidly gaining on you.
You gesture wildly to the mass of
student onlookers and tell the evil
babushka that it is a bread line. From
sheer force of habit.she takes her place
in the crowd, shoving everyone in front
of her. You've bought yourself some
time, but not enough: once she elbows
her way through the angry throng
she'll realize there is no food there —
just like in real Russia.
You need to act decisively: Your
first reaction is to go directly to the
Slavic Languages building and de
mand an explanation, but you know
what they say about invading Russia in
winter. Your only other option is to
take on the angry Arrillaga imposter
with your own two hands. What'll it be?
•Head over to the Slavic Languages
and Literatures building — be sure to
bring a scarf (go to A L EX 3).
•Enact some poetic justice on the mon
ster's highlx-caffeinated Soviet ass (go
to VICKY 4).

Alone with Zombified Kant, you
dredge up your killer instinct and tell
him:"Hey.look.did your spleen just fall
out!?" While he peers around groggily,
you whip out the 15(X)-page copy of

"War and Peace" you've been lugging
around all quarter and bash him over
the head with it. Finally, it comes in
handy for once. After tentatively prod
ding Kant with your Nalgene.you con
firm that he is dead and gone for good.
Well.That was surprisingly easy.
You cram the rotting, gooey corpse
in your tote bag just in case, then de
cide to reward yourself with an over
priced latte from Moonbean's. You
wait 45 minutes in line, sucking down
the smoke-hazy aura of an impossibly
chic French Lit TA. When it's finally
your turn, you order, then open your
wallet. The only thing staring back at
you is a $5 Jamba Juice gift card from a
psych study freshman year. Shit.There
are two weeks left in the quarter and
you are flat broke — you need money,
and fast.
In a moment of inspiration, you
head to the bookstore and get in line.
"Hello, shug," says the woman at
the counter, accidentally brushing
your cheek with her three-foot-long
tinsel eyelashes.
"I've come here to return this." you
say. lugging Zombie Kant's reeking
corpse out of your bag. You pray she
will not notice he is not a book but in
fact a gooified human cadaver.
Strangely, she does not blink an eye
(good. — those tinsel lashes hurt), but
just asks for your receipt. You snatch a
piece of scrap paper out of your bag
and scrawl: "One extremely logical
dead guy. purchased less than seven
days ago. I swear."
She says she can't give you actual
money because the price of purchase
was not listed on the receipt, but you
have have your choice of either five
free meals at the dining hall of your
preference or an all-expense-paid va
cation to a mystery destination.
•Brave a dinner at Lakeside Dining (go
to LISA 3).
•Try your luck in a foreign country

You pack your bags, call a Super
Shuttle and jump on a plane at SFO —
unfortunately, you're so caught up in
the trashy romance novel you buy at
the airport gift store that you don't no
tice what your final destination is. But
if the 300 pound mustachioed Latvian
women you're sitting between are any
indication, it's somewhere where den
tal hygiene is not a key social concern.
When you get through customs,you
immediately see a man carrying a sign
with your name and the slogan "("lassy
Lady Traveling Agency" on it. You feel
reassured until you take another look
at the man and his posse: lie is an an
cient, wizened old bat with shifty eves,
wearing a crushed-velvet peasant's
cassock covered with a bear skin
parka. Between him and his homies.

you've never seen so many gold teeth
in your life — it's like a rap battle on a
pirate ship.
Is he...a pimp?
Before you can protest, he grabs
your elbow, throws you into a gypsy
cab and you ride for three hours until
you come to a squalid little apartment
building. Out in the snow there stands
a huge, greasy man covered with adult
acne and wearing a Limp Bizkit T
shirt. even though you're pretty sure
he's a member of the AARP Ugh.
"This — your — husband." says
the pimp. You gesture that you want to
be left alone with your new fiance and
the pimp leads you to a private corner
of his communal apartment . You make
a plan of action: You can punch out this
creepy loser, steal his wallet and book
it back to Stanford, stat. Or you can
give the paying customer the goods be
fore heading back. After all. he's kind
of cute, if you ignore that glistening
pus-filled globule on his lower lip.
•Run hack to Stanford immediately (go
to DARREN4).
•Engage in sexual intimacy with the
soon-to-he-unconscious man first (go

Creepy as it seemed at first, friend

such a bad idea: you get invites to all
the hot Silicon Valley parties, the guys
at Phi Psi revere you as a god and Zuck
uses his administrative power to delete
any regrettable drunken messages you
leave on your crush's wall.
Still, there are some downsides. On
day two of the Facebook friendship,
Zuck lists your profile as his favorite
book on his profile. Shortly thereafter,
people have the option of sending a
headshot of you as a Facebook gift. If
"in sexually gratifying relationship of
searing emotional intensity" gets
added to the relationship options,
you're quitting da book for good.
Then, checking your inbox. you see
an email from thezuckman@face
book.god with the message: "I see a
mutual friend in our network detagged
these photos. Thought you might like
to see them!"
You download all nine attached
pictures and stare in horror at the first
shot of two middle-aged men dressed
up for Exotic Erotic. Wait a second, the

with your name and the slogan "("lassy
Lady Traveling Agency" on it. You feel
reassured until you take another look
at the man and his posse: lie is an an
cient, wizened old bat with shifty eves,
wearing a crushed-velvet peasant's
cassock covered with a bear skin
parka. Between him and his homies.

you've never seen so many gold teeth
in your life — it's like a rap battle on a
pirate ship.
Is he...a pimp?
Before you can protest, he grabs
your elbow, throws you into a gypsy
cab and you ride for three hours until
you come to a squalid little apartment
building. Out in the snow there stands
a huge, greasy man covered with adult
acne and wearing a Limp Bizkit T
shirt. even though you're pretty sure
he's a member of the AARP Ugh.
"This — your — husband." says
the pimp. You gesture that you want to
be left alone with your new fiance and
the pimp leads you to a private corner
of his communal apartment . You make
a plan of action: You can punch out this
creepy loser, steal his wallet and book
it back to Stanford, stat. Or you can
give the paying customer the goods be
fore heading back. After all. he's kind
of cute, if you ignore that glistening
pus-filled globule on his lower lip.
•Run hack to Stanford immediately (go

Creepy as it seemed at first, friend

such a bad idea: you get invites to all
the hot Silicon Valley parties, the guys

uses his administrative power to delete
any regrettable drunken messages you
leave on your crush's wall.
Still, there are some downsides. On
day two of the Facebook friendship,
Zuck lists your profile as his favorite
book on his profile. Shortly thereafter,
people have the option of sending a
headshot of you as a Facebook gift. If
"in sexually gratifying relationship of
searing emotional intensity" gets
added to the relationship options,
you're quitting da book for good.
Then, checking your inbox. you see
an email from thezuckman@face

Dodging blasts of oil fired by the
irate multibillionaire, a stream of pe
troleum spews into your mouth. It
tastes familiar, you realize, like Friday
night pregames or that smell that
lingers on your uncle's breath — wait a
minute, this isn't oil, this is Popov
vodka home-distilled through a Brita
filter! The distinction in taste is hard to
grasp, but years of row house progres
sives have left you with a discerning
palette for alcoholic masochism.
You dive into the CoHo's door and
as you duck and weave between
greasy-haired film TAs and Teach for
America interviewees, a well-aimed
shot of the liquid gets in your eye. tem
porarily blinding you. As you wipe it
out. Arrillaga removes the lifelike
mask he was wearing, revealing a face
with more wrinkles than The Daily has
typos per page. It is not our beloved
Rich Uncle Pennybags at all,but an old
Russian peasant woman! With surpris
ing adroitness,she flings herself toward
you and begins pounding you over the
head.screaming,'"Long live the Gener
al Secretariat, long live Stalin!"
By god. the communists were be
hind capitalism the whole time! Wild
ly, you reflect back on that last Slav-
Dom party, when a drunken Theme
Assistant revealed that the last step in
the glorious communist revolution
was to support a capitalist system so
all-encompassing that popular cul
ture eventually consumes itself out of
greed and topples into blissful state
controlled economy. It seems so obvi
ous now.
Your first instinct is to update the
Wikipedia entry on Lenin, but there's
no time for that now — the old lady is
rapidly gaining on you.
You gesture wildly to the mass of
student onlookers and tell the evil
babushka that it is a bread line. From
sheer force of habit.she takes her place
in the crowd, shoving everyone in front
of her. You've bought yourself some
time, but not enough: once she elbows
her way through the angry throng
she'll realize there is no food there —
just like in real Russia.
You need to act decisively: Your
first reaction is to go directly to the
Slavic Languages building and de
mand an explanation, but you know
what they say about invading Russia in
winter. Your only other option is to
take on the angry Arrillaga imposter
with your own two hands. What'll it be?
•Head over to the Slavic Languages
and Literatures building — be sure to
bring a scarf (go to A L EX 3).
•Enact some poetic justice on the mon
ster's highlx-caffeinated Soviet ass (go

Alone with Zombified Kant, you
dredge up your killer instinct and tell
him:"Hey.look.did your spleen just fall
out!?" While he peers around groggily,
you whip out the 15(X)-page copy of

"War and Peace" you've been lugging
around all quarter and bash him over
the head with it. Finally, it comes in
handy for once. After tentatively prod
ding Kant with your Nalgene.you con
firm that he is dead and gone for good.
Well.That was surprisingly easy.
You cram the rotting, gooey corpse
in your tote bag just in case, then de
cide to reward yourself with an over
priced latte from Moonbean's. You
wait 45 minutes in line, sucking down
the smoke-hazy aura of an impossibly
chic French Lit TA. When it's finally
your turn, you order, then open your
wallet. The only thing staring back at
you is a $5 Jamba Juice gift card from a
psych study freshman year. Shit.There
are two weeks left in the quarter and
you are flat broke — you need money,
and fast.
In a moment of inspiration, you
head to the bookstore and get in line.
"Hello, shug," says the woman at
the counter, accidentally brushing
your cheek with her three-foot-long
tinsel eyelashes.
"I've come here to return this." you
say. lugging Zombie Kant's reeking
corpse out of your bag. You pray she
will not notice he is not a book but in
fact a gooified human cadaver.
Strangely, she does not blink an eye
(good. — those tinsel lashes hurt), but
just asks for your receipt. You snatch a
piece of scrap paper out of your bag
and scrawl: "One extremely logical
dead guy. purchased less than seven
days ago. I swear."
She says she can't give you actual
money because the price of purchase
was not listed on the receipt, but you
have have your choice of either five
free meals at the dining hall of your
preference or an all-expense-paid va
cation to a mystery destination.
