## Card slides past No. 20 Trojans 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After losing the first two of three to No. 20
Southern California, Stanford baseball need
ed a win last Sunday to avoid its first series
sweep at home since 1997. Trailing 8-4 head
ing into the bottom of the seventh inning, the
C ardinal's chances of salvaging a win against
the Trojans were looking bleak indeed as the
announcement went out over the PA system
that the men's basketball team had been se
lected to the NCAA Tournament.
It may be doubtful that news of the bas
ketball squad's success spurred Stanford on
to its 10 runs over the next two innings of
play. But even so, the next hour and a half
would prove memorable for fans at Sunken
Diamond as the Cardinal comeback downed
USC, 14-9.
With its next competition roughly two
weeks away, the win was especially important
for Stanford's (11-8) spirits going into the
break.
"It means a lot," junior right fielder
Michael Taylor said. "It's a momentum thing
going into two weeks of practice. You have
two weeks off, you're going into finals and
you really don't want to be thinking about
getting swept at home, especially by the Tro
jans. So it's huge to come out and play real
hard — and 1 think we played hard in the

first two games, just didn't get some breaks
and didn't finish in some important areas."
"Today obviously in the last two frames
we had some resolve and we came out and
did what we were capable of doing," he con
tinued. "So going into the break like that —
now everyone feels good, now everyone feels
ready to get going on those next two weeks of
practice and workouts."
Taylor played a big role in the Cardinal's
come-from-behind win Sunday, going 4-for-5
at the plate, scoring three runs and knocking
in a career-high five RBI. Moreover,Taylor's

hits always seemed to key rallies for the Car
dinal. as he batted in the squad's first runs in
every inning in which Stanford scored.
It was also an important day for the stand
out right fielder's consistency. Taylor leads
the team with 17 RBI and a .519 slugging per
centage, but his .286 batting average to start
the year is a far cry from his .325 mark last
season. With his four hits Sunday, Taylor

raised his season average by 36 points.
"I think if you look back over my first two
years on the Farm, and really over my whole
career, I've kind of been a slow starter,"Tay
lor said. "I don't really know why that is. I re
ally tried to focus hard to make sure that did
n't happen this year, but it did anyway. But if
you just keep working, the game evens out."
Also keying the Cardinal's rally against

USC (15-9) were sophomore center fielder
Sean Ratliff, who scored three runs on the
day.and sophomore left fielder Joey August
who drove in three.
