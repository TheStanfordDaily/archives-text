## Card slides past No. 20 Trojans 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After losing the first two of three to No. 20
Southern California, Stanford baseball need
ed a win last Sunday to avoid its first series
sweep at home since 1997. Trailing 8-4 head
ing into the bottom of the seventh inning, the
C ardinal's chances of salvaging a win against
the Trojans were looking bleak indeed as the
announcement went out over the PA system
that the men's basketball team had been se
lected to the NCAA Tournament.
It may be doubtful that news of the bas
ketball squad's success spurred Stanford on
to its 10 runs over the next two innings of
play. But even so, the next hour and a half
would prove memorable for fans at Sunken
Diamond as the Cardinal comeback downed
USC, 14-9.
With its next competition roughly two
weeks away, the win was especially important
for Stanford's (11-8) spirits going into the
break.
"It means a lot," junior right fielder
Michael Taylor said. "It's a momentum thing
going into two weeks of practice. You have
two weeks off, you're going into finals and
you really don't want to be thinking about
getting swept at home, especially by the Tro
jans. So it's huge to come out and play real
hard — and 1 think we played hard in the

first two games, just didn't get some breaks
and didn't finish in some important areas."
"Today obviously in the last two frames
we had some resolve and we came out and
did what we were capable of doing," he con
tinued. "So going into the break like that —
now everyone feels good, now everyone feels
ready to get going on those next two weeks of
practice and workouts."
Taylor played a big role in the Cardinal's
come-from-behind win Sunday, going 4-for-5
at the plate, scoring three runs and knocking
in a career-high five RBI. Moreover,Taylor's

hits always seemed to key rallies for the Car
dinal. as he batted in the squad's first runs in
every inning in which Stanford scored.
It was also an important day for the stand
out right fielder's consistency. Taylor leads
the team with 17 RBI and a .519 slugging per
centage, but his .286 batting average to start
the year is a far cry from his .325 mark last
season. With his four hits Sunday, Taylor

raised his season average by 36 points.
"I think if you look back over my first two
years on the Farm, and really over my whole
career, I've kind of been a slow starter,"Tay
lor said. "I don't really know why that is. I re
ally tried to focus hard to make sure that did
n't happen this year, but it did anyway. But if
you just keep working, the game evens out."
Also keying the Cardinal's rally against

USC (15-9) were sophomore center fielder
Sean Ratliff, who scored three runs on the
day.and sophomore left fielder Joey August
who drove in three.
Pitching was again a problem area for
Stanford, as junior Nolan Gallagher went
three innings and gave up four earned runs

Sophomore infielder Cord Phelps slides into home for a run in Sunday's fifth inning. The Cardinal was able to put together 10 runs in two in
nings to avoid a series sweep, slipping by No. 20 Southern California for a 14-9 win.
the Cardinal needed seven pitch
ers to get through the day. Right
handed sophomore Max Fearnow
eventually earned the win. going
two innings and allowing no runs to
finish the game for Stanford.
"We've got a lot of guys who can
pitch better than they are now. and
they will." head coach Mark Mar
quess said. "The good thing is that
we'll get a little time here and get a
little work, at least before finals, and
then also get a little time off. ITiat
won't hurt us in any phase."
Saturday's game was highlighted
by a strong effort from sophomore
southpaw Jeremy Bleich.who threw
8.2 solid innings, giving up both runs
in the ninth. Unfortunately, the Car
dinal could not muster any offense
to go along with Bleich's strong per
formance, losing 2-1.
"[Bleich's] last two outings have
been very good." Marquess said.
"He's done a great job his last two
starts. I lis fastball is very good and it
was great in the game yesterday. It's
just a shame he couldn't get the win
there, but he went 5.2 innings and
did a good job. so that's a good sign."
The series started in a similarly
heartbreaking fashion for Stanford
on Friday, as the Trojans rode a five
run eighth inning to an 11-8 victory.
Stanford will next face Sacra
mento State (5-13) in a home-and
home two-game set after taking less
than two weeks off for end-of quar
ter exams. Hie Cardinal will host the
I lornets on March 24 before travel
ing to Sacramento. Calif, on March
25.
