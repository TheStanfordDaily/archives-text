## Card bounces back after tight SDSU win to defeat UCSB 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Softball team barely
pulled together a 4-3 win over San Diego
State on Saturday, but the rest of the week
end was smooth sailing for the No. 12 Car
dinal in the Stanford Classic.
Stanford outscored its opponents 22-5,
and its pitching staff notched a pair of one
hitters as the Cardinal extended its win
ning streak to six and improved to 21-5 on
the season.
A 6-2 win over UC-Santa Barbara
opened the tournament, and the Cardinal
shut out Sacramento State 8-0 in five in
nings on Friday afternoon. After the tough
victory' over San Diego State, Stanford
recorded back-to-back 2-0 wins against
Loyola-Chicago and UCSB. Junior hurler
Becky McC'ullough threw a one-hitter
against the Ramblers, and sophomore
Missy Penna matched the feat in the cham
pionship win over the Gauchos.
Stanford scored four runs in the bottom
of the first on Friday, going up for good on
the Gauchos. Freshman catcher Rosey
Neill and Penna had back-to-back RBI
singles, with Penna scoring two. Freshman
designated player Shannon Koplitz scored
Penna for the 4-0 lead. Senior leftfielder
Jackie Rinehart notched an RBI in the sec
ond and Penna hit a solo homer in the third
for the Cardinal's final score. UCSB
scored twice in the sixth, but the Stanford
lead held.
Neill again put the Cardinal on the
board in the second game of the day with a
second-inning leadoff homer. Sophomore

third baseman Maddy Coon notched an
RBI double and Neill got her second RBI
of the game to put Stanford up 3-0 after
three innings. Senior shortstop Lindsay
Key, Koplitz and Neill each brought in a
run in the fourth; Key and freshman cen
terfielder Alissa Haber gave the Cardinal
its final margin in the fifth. With an eight
run lead after five innings, the Cardinal
won by the run rule.
Stanford had its closest call of the
weekend Saturday morning with the tena
cious Aztecs. Smith put Stanford ahead in
the first inning with a two-RBI double, but
SDSU cut the lead to one with a run on a
fielder's choice in the second. Stanford
scored again in the third on Coon's solo
homer, but the Aztecs tied the game at
three in the fifth inning. Smith put the Car
dinal up for good in the bottom of the in
ning, and Penna struck out three in a row
in the bottom of the seventh to preserve
the win.
The Cardinal could convert only two of
its nine hits into runs against Loyola, but
that was enough thanks to McCullough's
one-hitter in the circle. Junior rightfielder
Anna Beardman hit an RBI single in the
fourth, and Rinehart came home on a wild
pitch in the sixth for the final 2-0 score.
Stanford shut out the Gauchos in the
tournament championship game Sunday
afternoon with Penna throwing a one-hit
ter of her own. Smith hit a two-run homer
off the leftfield foul pole in the first inning
and neither team would score again, as the
Cardinal remained undefeated at home
