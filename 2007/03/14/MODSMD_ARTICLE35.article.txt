freshman Zack Giesen at 184 pounds all punched their tickets
to the national tournament in Detroit during the Pacific-10
Conference Championships which concluded on Feb. 25. Since
then, the entire Stanford team has been focused on preparing
its five NCAA-bound contenders for the competition at the
Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the NBAs Detroit Pistons.
"[Practices have] been going really well, guys have been
pushing hard," head coach Kerry McCoy said. "It worked real
well for guys — their legs seem like they're fresh, their bodies
are feeling good and their minds are where they should be, and
that's the most important thing. We've got five guys training,
and we've got 10 guys who are helping them train. So it's a com
bination of the guys who aren't going being focused on helping
those five, and the guys who are going not being worried about
what the other guys are doing but just focused on themselves. I
think we did a great job at that."
As the only member of the Cardinal squad returning to the
NCAA Championships for the second straight year, Pac-10
champion Gardner — who finished eighth at last year's
NCAA tourney — has had his sights set on a national champi
onship since well before the season opened in November. Now
that the time has come for Gardner to wrestle for his goals, the
junior eagerly awaits the opening of competition and is confi
dent in his abilities.
"I'm excited — some people would be a little nervous, but
I'm more excited than anything." he said. "It's a great opportu
nity to go out and show people what I can do. I've shown that
I'm competitive with those top guys,but 1 haven't beaten those
top two guys yet. so I'm just excited to go out there because I
know I'm going to beat them."
Gardner enters the tournament seeded third behind Troy
Nickerson of Cornell and Sam Hazewinkel of Oklahoma.
Gardner lost a 3-0 decision to Nickerson on Dec. 30.2006.
Gardner is the only seeded Cardinal wrestler entering the
tournament.in which Zupancicand Giesen will face seeded op
ponents to start the competition.They will open with No. 8 Seth
Martin of Lock Haven and N0.3 Mike Pucillo of Ohio State.re
spectively. McCoy chose to sec the strength of his wrestlers'
early tournament schedule as a positive.
"The thing is, if they get a win there,
we knock off one of the big dogs' early,
and that's how we try to look at it,"the
second-year Stanford coach said. "Ob
viously, you want to be in a situation
where you can go out and feel like you
have the advantage when you wrestle.
But ultimately, in order to win the tour
nament, you're going to have to beat a
few tough guys anyway. So whether you
beat them late, or whether you beat
them early, you've got to still beat
them."
Zupancic, at least, sounded unfazed
by the unfamiliarity of the competition
the Cardinal will be facing in a tourna
ment traditionally dominated by Big 10
Conference and East Coast powers.
"It doesn't really change anything,"
Zupancic said. "I've had a lot of experi
ence in a year, wrestling a lot of top
ranked wrestlers. I'm just going to have
to wrestle five good matches anyway."
Zupancic's comments reflect a con
fidence that McCoy has tried to instill in
his wrestlers throughout the season.
Armed with that and their training,
which Gardner described as the best in
the nation, Stanford's coach has a
strong belief in what his squad is capa
ble of
"I think that every one of them is
ready to do what it takes to be an All-
American," McCoy said. "And if they
go out there and wrestle the way
they've been trained, it's going to hap
pen."
