marked increase from the

freshman Zack Giesen at 184 pounds all punched their tickets
to the national tournament in Detroit during the Pacific-10
Conference Championships which concluded on Feb. 25. Since
then, the entire Stanford team has been focused on preparing
its five NCAA-bound contenders for the competition at the
Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the NBAs Detroit Pistons.
"[Practices have] been going really well, guys have been
pushing hard," head coach Kerry McCoy said. "It worked real
well for guys — their legs seem like they're fresh, their bodies
are feeling good and their minds are where they should be, and
that's the most important thing. We've got five guys training,
and we've got 10 guys who are helping them train. So it's a com
bination of the guys who aren't going being focused on helping
those five, and the guys who are going not being worried about
what the other guys are doing but just focused on themselves. I
think we did a great job at that."
As the only member of the Cardinal squad returning to the
NCAA Championships for the second straight year, Pac-10
champion Gardner — who finished eighth at last year's
NCAA tourney — has had his sights set on a national champi
onship since well before the season opened in November. Now
that the time has come for Gardner to wrestle for his goals, the
junior eagerly awaits the opening of competition and is confi
dent in his abilities.
"I'm excited — some people would be a little nervous, but
I'm more excited than anything." he said. "It's a great opportu
nity to go out and show people what I can do. I've shown that
I'm competitive with those top guys,but 1 haven't beaten those
top two guys yet. so I'm just excited to go out there because I
know I'm going to beat them."
Gardner enters the tournament seeded third behind Troy
Nickerson of Cornell and Sam Hazewinkel of Oklahoma.
Gardner lost a 3-0 decision to Nickerson on Dec. 30.2006.
