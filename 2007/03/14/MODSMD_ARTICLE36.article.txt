## Senior earns two titles, Card fourth 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite several first-place finishes
and record-breaking times, the Stanford
women's swimming and diving team
came up short at last weekend's NCAA
Championships, finishing in fourth be
hind California, Arizona and defending
champion Auburn.
The Cardinal's top performer was
senior diver Cassidy Krug, who ended
her collegiate career with victories in
both the 1-meter and 3-meter events.
On Saturday, Krug was named the
NCAA Diver of the Year, and head div
ing coach Dr. Rick Schavone was
awarded the title of Diving Coach of the
Year. Krug is the first 1-meter diving
champion in Stanford history and the
first women's diver from the Cardinal to
win a national title in any diving event
since 2001.
"It is unbelievable to be the NCAA
champion in both events." Krug said.
"This was the best meet of my life, and it

by 202 points, as Auburn earned the champi

points. Standout performances for the Cardinal
came from Elaine Breeden, who won her first
NCAA championship in the 200 fly, while Cas

Year honors.

is a wonderful way to finish off what has
been the best four years of my life."
With the NCAA victories, Krug is
now undefeated in postseason competi
tion this year, already having won both
events at both the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships and the NCAA
Zone E Meet.
"This was a dream come true for
her," Schavone said." We were never to

and wins, but this was sensational. She
really did it. Cassidy competed
against the best and was able to beat
them."
Stanford's other first-place finish
er was freshman Elaine Breeden, who
earned her first NCAA title in the
200-yard butterfly, finishing with a
record meet time of 1:53.02 on Satur

day. The time was just short of Bree
ders own school record of 1:52.29,
which she set at the Pac-1() Champi
onships last month.
"It was so exciting for me to win
and end the meet on a high note for
the team," Breeden said. "Our hard
work this season didn't show through
in all the ways we hoped it would, so it
was awesome to end with this great
achievement."
Breeden's win was especially re
markable given her relative youth as a
freshman, compared to the more ex
perienced opposition.

"Her opponents were big-time
swimmers that were veterans and
swimming well," head swimming
coach Lea Maurer said. "It was a
tough race, and she went out after it.
She fought hard and was impressive
with her savvy poise and tough
ness."
Breeden also came in second place
in the 100 fly and fifth in the 200 indi
vidual medley. Other top point-scor
ers for the Cardinal were freshman
Julia Smit and juniors Caroline Bruce
and Brooke Bishop.
Smit finished third in both the 200

and 400 IM and took second in the
200 backstroke. Her 1:53.39 swim in
the backstroke was a personal best
and just 0.27 seconds away from a
school record. Bruce came in third
place in the 200 breaststroke and 10th
in the 100 breaststroke. Bishop placed
fifth in the 50 freestyle, 10th in the 100
freestyle and tied for sixth in the 100
back.
"This was a huge night for the big
four," said Maurerof the performanc
es of Bishop, Breeden, Bruce and
Smit. "They worked really hard to
gether all year and had good friend

ships and lots of energy."
Several of Stanford's relay teams
also placed highly. On Thursday, the
4(X) medley relay team of Smit, Bruce,
Breeden and Bishop finished third
with a season-best time of 3:34.86.The
Cardinal squad took fifth in the 200
free relay with a team of Smit, Bree
den. Bishop and sophomore Fiona
O'Donnell-McCarthy. On Friday,
Stanford took fourth in the 200 med
ley relay and seventh in the 800 free
relay.The Cardinal won its final event
of the meet on Saturday in the conso
lation finals of the 400 free relay when

a team of Smit, Breeden. Bishop and
sophomore Madeline Rovira won
with a time of 3:16.44. which was
faster than four of the eight teams in
the championship finals.
"We were really excited with both
our individual performances and our
effort as a team." Maurer said. "We
fought hard at this meet to stay in it
just like we did all year. The fourth
place finish is our best in a while, and
our goal is to keep moving up."
