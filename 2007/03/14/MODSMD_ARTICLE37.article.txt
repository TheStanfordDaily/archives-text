"We have prepared all year for this
meet, and we have all the pieces we
need to win," Wildman Tobriner said.
"As is the case with all NCAA meets,
we need to he the team that shows up
ready to race fast."
That won't he too difficult with
Stanford swimmers ranking in the top
three in 13 of the 18 events, and sever
al more individuals among event lead
ers. Wildman-Tobriner ranks in the
top three for all three of his individual
events: I le is second in the 50 freestyle
with a time of 19.23. third in the KX)
butterfly (46.00) and second in the 100
free (4151).
Other notables include Kornfeld.
who is seeded second in the 100
breaststroke at 52.75; Sun. who is sec
ond in the 2(H) backstroke at 1:41.22
and third in the 200 butterfly at
1:43.91; Phillips, ranked third in the
S(H) freestyle at 4:16.31: and Cass, who
is the top qualifier in the 200 individ
ual medley at 1:45.92.
All five Stanford relay teams are
ranked in the top five as well.
Three individual swimmers carry
the momentum of six total Pacific-10
Conference titles into the final meet:
Wildman-Tobriner in the 50 and 100
free and 100 fly, Kornfeld in the 100
and 200 breast and Sun in the 200
back. Dumais was the conference
champion in the 1 -meter.
The Cardinal also won Pac-10 titles
in the 400 free relay.4oo medley relay.
200 free relay and 200 medley relay.
With a roster of talented swim
mers toting impressive resumes of ti
tles and times, not to mention yet an
other Pac-10 Championship title.
Stanford is one of the most formida
ble teams coming out of the West.
Add on the fact that the team has

been focusing and preparing for the
NCAAs through the season, and the
championship title that has eluded
the squad for eight years seems well
within reach.
"It would be very disappointing if
we didn't come back with a ring," Ko
rnfeld said. "We are such a tight-knit
group right now with a clear purpose,
and I am fully confident that we will
bring back a championship."
lite Cardinal's biggest competition
will be No. 3 Auburn, who has cap
tured the NCAA Championship title
every year since 2003. Texas currently
sits atop the national polls, but Korn

feld sees a greater challenge for Stan
ford within itself.
"Our biggest challenge is just get
ting everybody to step up and swim
faster," he said. "We need people to
move up and make finals and [we
need] the people that are supposed to
be there to be there. It sounds simple
because it is. Ilie big teams will be
there — Auburn. Texas and Arizona
— but our biggest challenge is just to
perform the way we should and then
we can win."
