# Women find smooth swing
## 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Despite injuries, a tough schedule and battling the ele
ments, the No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team just keeps
winning. The Cardinal improved its record to an impres
sive 11-1 this past weekend with smooth victories over
Oregon and Texas.
The three-time defending champions currently sit atop
the Pac-10 standings; they haven't lost a match since the
early February shocker against Georgia Tech.
The Cardinal opened the weekend with an easy 7-0 win
over No. 2b Oregon.
"We played really, really well." freshman 1 .indsay Bur
dette said."We absolutely killed them in doubles."
Stanford had three straight victories for the doubles
point. The No. 41 tandem of Burdette and senior Anne
Yelsey defeated Oregon's Dominika Dieskova and Ana
Olivos 8-5, with even more decisive 8-1 and 8-4 wins (by
juniorsCelia Durkin and Lejla I lodzic.andjunior Whitney
Deason and senior Theresa Logar, respectively) to follow.
Sophomore Jessica Nguyen was out on injury, while
Durkin and Yelsey were limited in competition, but Stan
ford pulled through in singles as well.
"We adjusted really well and we came on really strong."
Durkin said. "We took out Oregon very decisively."
Sunday's match against Texas was more of a test for the
Cardinal. Stanford won by a final score of 5-2, suffering
losses at the five and six slots of the singles portion of the
match.
Head Coach Lele I brood was still pleased with her
team's performance, though.
"1 think we played pretty well given the circumstances
of injuries, illness and everything else." she said.
With their healthier lineup, the Longhorns came on
strong from the start — but Stanford was ready for them.
"1 think that Texas came out with a little more fire,"
Durkin said. "But we came out with just as much fire and
had a lot of fun in taking them out. We all had pretty tough
matches at all points and everyone fought through them."
Adding an interesting dynamic to the Texas match,
Longhorns head coach Patty Fendick-McCain is a Stan
ford alumna ('B7) and was a former star tennis player for
the Cardinal.This gave the current Cardinal team an extra
incentive to defeat the Longhorns, according to Burdette.
"It was really interesting," she said. "Personally, 1 visit
ed [Texas] as a possible place to play tennis. It added an in
teresting dynamic and gave us something tangible to want
to beat Texas."
Durkin disagreed somewhat with Burdette's assess-

ment.
"It didn't affect the match too much because every
team comes out to Stanford," she said." But I think that she
[Fendick-McCain] definitely got her players ready."
The Oregon and Texas victories conclude a rough four
week stretch of eight matches for the Cardinal. Battling in
juries and their opponents, Stanford came out of the
stretch with its one-loss record intact.The Cardinal will get
a much-needed break during Dead Week and finals: The
squad won't play another match for nearly two weeks,
when it faces Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo) on March 25.
Many of the players welcome the much-needed rest,
both from practice and match play.
"It's good and it's bad," Durkin said. "We're kind of on
a roll now, but at the same time we've really had a tough
quarter.This last quarter was very strenuous and it will be
great to get a break. 1 think that's why we do so well at
NCAAs every year — besides having a very talented
team, we're very fresh."
"We all need time to get our schoolwork back in line
but to also recover, regroup and refresh mentally," Bur
dette added."l feel like this break came at the perfect time.
It will really be useful for us to regroup and go toward our
last push at the NCAA [Championships]."
After the last four weeks, the Cardinal players need a
break.
"We did an unbelievable job of pulling through injuries
and a lot of adversity in general — losing the winning
streak at Indoors — we've bounced back and fought
hard," Burdette said. "I think it says a lot about our team
this year and what we're capable of. To make it to this
break without losing after the Georgia Tech loss is huge,
and 1 think it's only going to get better for us from here on
out."
The break should play a role in preparing the Cardinal
for its run to the NCAA Championships in mid-May.

Lindsay Burdette returns the ball against Oregon's Anna Pawaska last Saturday. The freshman defeated Pawaska 6-3,
6-2 in the No. 4 Cardinal's 7-0 routing of the No. 26 Ducks.
Durkin. winner of two national team
titles in her career at Stanford, be
lieves that the team is right where it
wants to be heading into the final two
months of the season.
"I think were in a great position
right now "she said. "Our team is just
so close and it's really showing. We're
not all healthy but we still went and
dominated; it just goes to show that
when we are healthy, we'll be that
much scarier. We're an NCAA
Championship [caliber] team."
