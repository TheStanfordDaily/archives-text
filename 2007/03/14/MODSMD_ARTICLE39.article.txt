# Golden Bears sweep Card
## No. 36 men's tennis shut out, 7-0, after easy win last year 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Any spectators who had seen California play Stanford in
men's tennis last year would have wondered if it was, in fact,
the same two teams playing this year.
Ihe contrast was that stark on Saturday, as the No. 41
Golden Bears (7-4) notched a 7-0 shutout victory over the
No. 36 Cardinal (3-8). racking up more than twice their sea
son-long total from 2(X)6. when they won just three of a pos
sible 18 points against Stanford.
On Saturday, the eight different players that started for
the Bears included five who competed against the Cardinal
last year and two experienced transfers.
Stanford's singles lineup, on the other hand, included six
players who had not competed against Cal last year.
"I was really excited to have all of those guys out there,"
Stanford head coach John Whitlinger said. "It's difficult
when guys have to move up a spot and play a different posi
tion, but 1 really love the way we battled and fought. I knew
the guys that were out there were going to give 110 percent,
and they did. Cal was just better [on Saturday]."
In 2006, Stanford and Cal met twice in the regular season
and once in the NC'A AToumament. In February and April,
the Cardinal won 6-1 and 5-2 over the Bears before beating
Cal. 4-0. in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in
May.
On Saturday,however,Cal picked up the first point at the
I lellman Tennis Complex when it won the top and final dou
bles positions. With an overhead, Cal's Tyler Browne and
John Pettit punctuated their 8-6 win over sophomore Blake
Muller and freshman Kevin Kaiser. At the final doubles
spot, senior Eric McKean and sophomore Jeff Zeller fell 8-
4 to give the Bears the first point.
Stanford freshmen Paul Morrissey and Richard Wire led
7-4 in the middle doubles match and eventually closed out
an 8-6 win when Cal missed a return.
After doubles, Muller pulled out of the singles lineup,
and the Cardinal replaced him with its final remaining
healthy player on the roster.That made six faces that Cal did
not see in 2006 dual match action.
The Bears extended their win streak to four when they
dominated the Card at the bottom of the lineup. Senior
David Ryan. Morrissey and Zeller fell in straight sets at the
sixth, fourth and fifth spots, respectively, to give Stanford's
cross-bay rival the four points it needed to clinch the match.
Kaiser utilized aggressive serves and came into the net

frequently, hut was not quite able to close out points against
senior Daniel Sebescen. The Stanford freshman ultimately
lost 6-3.6-3.
McKean's match against senior Tyler Browne was a bit
reminiscent of his loss to Florida State last Wednesday. After
dropping the first set. the Stanford captain bounced back to
earn the second. 6-4, before ultimately losing in a super
tiebreaker for the third.
"Eric was fighting so hard, so it was a tough way to end."
Whitlinger said. "I think if he had a third set. it would have
been very different.Tylers a very good player, and he's done
very well at Cal every year he's played there."
At the top singles spot. Wire lost a hard-fought match to
N0.23 Pierre Mouillon.7-6,7-6.The freshman from England
led 6-5 in the second and had the opportunity to serve out
the set. but was not able to capitalize on the opportunity.
"Overall, we're pleased with [Richard]," Whitlinger said.
"The only concern is when he has the chance to serve sets
out or serve for matches and those games get by him. and he
gets into a dogfight. He puts himself in position to win —
we've just got to get that next step. 1 was proud of the way he
played though — he's just got to finish."
Stanford will now take a two week-long hiatus before re
turning to the courts on March 26 in a rare double-header.
Hie Card will take on No. 57 Brigham Young at 11 a.m. be
fore facing No. 59 Santa Clara at 5 p.m.
"They'll play at 11 o'clock and then turn right around and
play another match," Whitlinger said. "In my 21 years [of
coaching], we've never done it.and I 'm really going to be in
terested in how the guys respond. If we're not healthy and
we only have six guys, it's going to be a lot on them. But I
have faith in my team,and I'm looking forward to that day."
The double-header is part of a very intense spring break
for a team that will play five matches in six days. After the
matches on Monday, the Cardinal takes on Harvard on
Wednesday before traveling to play Arizona and Arizona
State on Friday and Saturday,respectively.Two of Stanford's
three wins this season came against the Arizona schools
when they traveled to the Bay Area in late February.

frequently, hut was not quite able to close out points against
senior Daniel Sebescen. The Stanford freshman ultimately
lost 6-3.6-3.
McKean's match against senior Tyler Browne was a bit
reminiscent of his loss to Florida State last Wednesday. After
dropping the first set. the Stanford captain bounced back to
earn the second. 6-4, before ultimately losing in a super
tiebreaker for the third.
"Eric was fighting so hard, so it was a tough way to end."
Whitlinger said. "I think if he had a third set. it would have
been very different.Tylers a very good player, and he's done
very well at Cal every year he's played there."
At the top singles spot. Wire lost a hard-fought match to
N0.23 Pierre Mouillon.7-6,7-6.The freshman from England
led 6-5 in the second and had the opportunity to serve out
the set. but was not able to capitalize on the opportunity.
"Overall, we're pleased with [Richard]," Whitlinger said.
"The only concern is when he has the chance to serve sets
out or serve for matches and those games get by him. and he
gets into a dogfight. He puts himself in position to win —
we've just got to get that next step. 1 was proud of the way he
played though — he's just got to finish."
Stanford will now take a two week-long hiatus before re
turning to the courts on March 26 in a rare double-header.

fore facing No. 59 Santa Clara at 5 p.m.
"They'll play at 11 o'clock and then turn right around and
play another match," Whitlinger said. "In my 21 years [of
coaching], we've never done it.and I 'm really going to be in
terested in how the guys respond. If we're not healthy and
we only have six guys, it's going to be a lot on them. But I
have faith in my team,and I'm looking forward to that day."
The double-header is part of a very intense spring break
for a team that will play five matches in six days. After the
matches on Monday, the Cardinal takes on Harvard on
Wednesday before traveling to play Arizona and Arizona
State on Friday and Saturday,respectively.Two of Stanford's
three wins this season came against the Arizona schools
