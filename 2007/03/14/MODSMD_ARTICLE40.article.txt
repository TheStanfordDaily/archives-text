meet all night, and we did fight enough
to win. hut we did not have our best
work."
The competition began with the
vault, in which three gymnasts scored
over a 9.85. Junior Tabitha Yim led the
Cardinal with a 9.9. Two significant con
tributors on the vault, sophomore

GAME NOTES: The No. 3 Cardinal re
bounded from a Feb. 25 loss to the
Cornhuskers in Lincoln, Neb. Friday,
pulling out a narrow victory over the
No. 9 Sooners. Stanford won the meet
thanks in part to strong performances
to start the competition on the beam,
which had been a troublesome event
for the Cardinal in Lincoln.
some great landings," sophomore Kelly
Fee said.
Bars c;ime next, in which Fee led off
the event for the Cardinal, posting a
score of 9.85. Junior Lauren Elmore and
sophomore Nicole Ourada kept the
momentum going by scoring 9.8 and
9.7. respectively. But Stanford experi
enced a minor setback when junior
Alex Pintchouk fell on her mount.
Freshman Carly Janiga followed up
with a 9.875 in the event, and Yim fin
ished bars strong for the Cardinal, hit
ting her routine and sticking her full-out
dismount to score a 9.9.
"1 think that the team, as a whole,re
ally pulled together and showed great
growth, especially after a rough bar ro
tation, which is something that we are
not used to," Carter said. "We didn't let
it get to us as we went into beam, and
that showed in our performances."
The competition remained close
after the opening pair of events, and the
Cardinal took a slight lead over the
Sooners. 98.325-98.25.
Since the beam had proved prob
lematic for Stanford in its meet at Ne
braska two weeks ago. the event was a
point of emphasis on Friday, and the
Cardinal pulled through.
"Beam is always the make-or-break
event, and Lauren Elmore started us off
with a very solid routine, which is key"
Fee said.
While Fee showed major improve
ment from two weeks ago, scoring a
9.825, Yim's third 9.9 of the night was the
high score for the Cardinal in the event.
"We fought the whole time out
there, but it wasn't near our best work,"
Janiga said. "Despite the tough judging,
we are capable of scoring a few tenths
higher here and there on certain events.
These meets are really teaching us that
it takes everyone's 100 percent effort.
We've seen that the judges aren't going
to give us anything, meaning we need to
work that much harder."
The Cardinal gymnasts finished the
competition on the floor, where Stan
ford has performed inconsistently.
Pintchouk started off strong with a
9.825 and freshman Blair Ryland. who
has proven to be a very competitive
gymnast on floor in her first season, fol
lowed up with a 9.8. Junior Stephanie
Gentry had been out of the floor lineup
for a few weeks and had one of her best
routines, including a final tumbling pass
off a double pike.
Fee had a clean routine, but had to

fight a tough landing in her final double
tuck dismount, while Janiga once again
was unfazed by Fee's setback and per
formed well, earning a 9.8.
After the floor excercise. the crowd
at Burnham Pavilion sat in suspense as
the scores were tallied. The cheering
began when Stanford was announced
the winner.
"Oklahoma was a great team." Yim
said. "It was a really good competition,
head to head in most of the events."
After the tight match, though, the
Cardinal women realized there are
many ways for them to improve.
"Tonight revealed that we have a lot
to do," Smyth said. "We had a lot of little
mistakes and we need a lot of fine tun
ing before our final regular-season
meet."
The Cardinal next faces arch-rival
UCLA on Mar. 25 at 2 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
"UCLA is a tough team, and it is
going to take everything this team has in
order to win and stay undefeated in the
[Pac-10]," Janiga said.'UCLA has a his
tory. and judges are going to give them
the benefit of the doubt."
The team is building into the post
season, as Yim pointed out, and UCLA
will prove a testing ground for Stanford
as it looks to demonstrate its full poten
tial.
"We want to prove that Stanford is
the team to beat," Fee said.
After facing the Bruins, the Cardinal
will travel to Arizona for the Pac-10
Championships, and will then go on to
the NCAA Regionals and Champi
onships.
