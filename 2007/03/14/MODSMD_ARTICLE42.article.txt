# Women stick it out over Colgate
## Lacrosse makes second-half comeback against Raiders for 10-9 win 
### SARA LANNIN 
Last weekend came with a happy
ending for the Stanford women's
lacrosse team. After barely losing. 10-
9. to No. 7 James Madison on Friday,
the women had accumulated a four
game losing streak. Sunday's exciting
game against Colgate also ended with
a 10-9 score, but this time the Cardi
nal came out on top.
Despite their loss, Stanford (2-5)
played a good game against the
James Madison Dukes (3-1). Al
though JMU initiated the scoring,
sophomore attacker Bis Fries scored
the first two goals for the Cardinal —
each just 38 seconds apart — a move
that motivated her teammates junior
Megan McClain and sophomore
Bess Siegfried to score goals of their
own.
ITie powerful Stanford defense
held the JMU attackers scoreless for
17 minutes during the four-goal
streak. Momentum shifted back in
favor of the Dukes, however, and the
half ended with Stanford behind by
two goals.

Despite additional goals in the
second half from McClain and Fries,
as well as sophomore Jamie Neshitt
and freshman Julie Christy, the Car
dinal could not regain the lead. Ulti
mately. Stanford was barely edged
out by the Dukes. Junior goalkeeper
Laura Shane stopped 11 shots during
the game.
Sunday's game against Colgate
ended quite differently.The Cardinal
started out strongly, with senior Liz
Piselli, Fries, Siegfried and Nesbitt all
scoring within the first 13 minutes.
The Raiders managed to find the net
three times before the end of the half,
but two more Stanford goals from
Piselli and McClain put the score at 6-
3 as the teams stopped for halftime.
After dominating in the first half,
the Cardinal had to fight against the
Raiders, who came out of the locker
room energized and hungry for goals.
By the time the clock read 18:55. the
Raiders had completed a five-goal
run and were ahead by two. Piselli
ended the Cardinal's scoring
drought, and after nine minutes of
goals, including one apiece from Mc-

Clain and freshman Dana Lindsay,
the score stood tied at 9-9. It was then
time for freshman Amanda Schwab,
whose only goal of the game at 5:31
clinched the win for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal edged the Raiders
thanks in part to its depth, with seven
different Stanford players scoring
over the course of the game. Goal
keeper Shane posted 15 saves, out
playing her counterpart Sara Drexler
who saved only 11. Stanford also
topped Colgate 13-11 on ground
balls, and won 15 out of 21 draws. Col
gate's loss marked the third time in
the Raiders' past five games that they
have lost by just one goal.
After a week off. the Stanford
women will kick off their three-game
spring break tour against Virginia
Tf.ch on March 25 in Blacksburg. Va.
The Hokies (4-3). led by top scorers
kady Mcßrearty and Lindsey Pieper,
have been on a three-game winning
streak that they will try to improve to
four before they face the Cardinal.
Following Virginia Tech. Stanford
will face a very tough adversary in
Maryland. The Terrapins are current-

scorer Margie Curran. they will be
