# Fencers first at Regional
## No. 9 men top field, women place second 
### ANDREW SHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a finish reminiscent of the
Olympics, with the winner decorated
with the most medals, the Stanford
fencing team emerged victorious and
decked in gold at the NCAA Western
Regional this weekend. By beating
out Cal State-Fullerton, Cal Tech,
UC-San Diego and Air Force, the
Cardinal fencers have put themselves
in position to he well-represented at
the NCAA Championships in Madi
son. N.J.. on March 22-25.
UC-San Diego did win two events
in its home facility.but the final results
had the ninth-ranked Cardinal men
the champion of the competition,
while the women took second place.
Highlighting Stanford's domi
nance were sophomore sabreist Eva
Jellinson and freshman foilist Jessica
Wacker, who each placed first in their
respective events. Earning second
place honors were sophomore Teddy
Levit in sabre, sophomores Clayton
Kenney and Brittany Leader in epee
and freshman Phil Arredondo in foil.
Rounding out the medal winners, jun
ior foilist Richard Fulton finished
third.
"I'm so proud of my teammates,"
Jellinson said after the competition.
In addition to those top
finishers,the Stanford coaching staff
will use its wildcard push for freshman
sabreist Sarah Parker to compete at
NCAAs.
While all of the finishes were im
pressive. Stanford did not know for
sure who will be headed to New Jer
sey until this morning. Last year, the
Cardinal had six athletes qualify and
Stanford co-head coach Lisa Milgram
has her fingers crossed that more will
compete this year.
"There is nothing official until
Wednesday morning, but the Western

FENCING

Regionals

NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
3/22-25 Madison, N.J.

NCAA Regional recommendation is
for us to qualify seven." she said.
Not surprisingly, it was the fresh
man and sophomore classes of this
young squad that carried the team. Of
the seven medal-winners, six were un
derclassmen, not including wild-card
candidate Parker.
The Cardinal predictably dominated
the field in the ring, but this Stanford
team has yet to be challenged by some
of the elite schools in the nation, in
cluding No. 2 Ohio State and No. 6
Notre Dame, against whom the Car
dinal struggled last season. These are
the types of schools that will be fea
tured on March 22 in Madison.
With seven likely representatives
from the Stanford squad, the Cardinal
has a good shot at competing for its
first-ever NCAA championship.
Wacker is excited about the prospects
of competing at the final meet and has
already had a dream season.
"As a freshman, fencing with the
team has definitely been the highlight
of my Stanford experience," she said.
"I also have to say that [sophomore]
Dan [Tucker] and [senior] Heather
[Backnian] did exemplary jobs as
team captains, and 1 couldn't ask for a
better fencing family."
