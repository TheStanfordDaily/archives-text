The stands might not have been
completely full, hut the energy in
Burnham Pavilion for the men's gym
nastics meet last Saturday night was
felt in each and every corner of the
room. The No. 5 Cardinal came from
behind in a tightly contested meet to
down No. 2 Penn State and No. 9
lowa in an emotional victory. The
Cardinal finished with a 216.70 total,
while Penn State was close behind
with 214.80 and lowa was in third
with 204.75.
Entering the parallel bars 1.5
points behind Penn State, and need
ing to be solid on the final two rota
tions, Stanford kicked it into gear.
Highlighted by junior Chris 1 larper's
9.1, the crowd was electrified
throughout the parallel bars, roaring
after each member of the Cardinal
dismounted and landed with ease.
With Penn State suffering a few falls
off the high bar. Stanford knew that
its high bar score would make or
break the meet.
In perhaps the finest rotation of
the night for the team, freshman An

routine and tallied an 8.8. Mclntyre s
performance got the crowd going,
and the Cardinal was high-flying
from there. Sophomore Bryant Had

Dylan Carney, scored an outstanding
9.7.

State's struggles on their final event
of the night, the vault.The final gym
nast for Stanford, junior David
Sender, sparked the loudest roar
from the audience, as he launched off
the high bar and perfectly stuck his
landing en route to a 9.25. I"he team
tallied a solid 37.05 on the event,
vaulting into the lead to claim the vic
tory.
Stanford outscored second-place
finisher Penn State 72.70-69.30 on the
final two events, and largely attrib
uted it to the energy that the team, as
well as the fans, had down the stretch.
'This is absolutely amazing,"
Sender, the all-around champion
(55.55),5aid. "This has been the most
fun meet of the year. 1 can't even de
scribe the feeling right now. It was a
little rough at the beginning, and we
really didn't even know how close [to

Penn State) we were."
Sender had a right to be excited.
When he hit the landing off the high
bar. he clenched his fists and smiled, a
signal that he most likely just per
formed the meet-clinching routine.
"This is one of the greatest feel
ings I have ever had," Sender contin
ued. "The team fought for every
thing. We knew [every tenth] mat
tered tonight.This is great."
Head coach Thom Glielmi agreed
with Sender that every point mat
tered.
"The team understood the impor
tance of each tenth," he said. "It was
tough all night, but we never gave up
and we got the job done."
The team's victory was even more
celebrated due to the fact that it came
on Senior Night and was the last
home meet of the season.
"To come out here on Senior
Night and do our jobs so well is amaz
ing." said I larper. who was one of the
emotional sparks for the team as the
meet progressed.
"These seniors are awesome," he
added. "We are all such good friends.

great."

performance. Ile stepped up when
needed and competed very well in his
four events: the floor exercise (8.4),
pommel horse (8.35). parallel bars
(8.55) and high bars (7.6).

"As a freshman. I haven't really
experienced a meet that was so high
energy." Hughes said. "It is so much
more intense to compete when
everybody in the crowd is so pumped
up. I was a little nervous, but I had so
much adrenaline from the crowd that
it kind of balanced out."

gives Stanford momentum as it heads
into the championship season. The
team has been working hard with its
training regimes and will continue to
do so as it looks to be one of the top
contenders for the NCAA title.

fun meet of the year. 1 can't even de
scribe the feeling right now. It was a
little rough at the beginning, and we
really didn't even know how close [to

Penn State) we were."
Sender had a right to be excited.
When he hit the landing off the high
bar. he clenched his fists and smiled, a
signal that he most likely just per

ings I have ever had," Sender contin
ued. "The team fought for every
thing. We knew [every tenth] mat
tered tonight.This is great."
Head coach Thom Glielmi agreed
with Sender that every point mat

To do it for them — on this stage — is

"As a freshman. I haven't really
experienced a meet that was so high
energy." Hughes said. "It is so much
more intense to compete when
everybody in the crowd is so pumped
up. I was a little nervous, but I had so
much adrenaline from the crowd that
it kind of balanced out."
