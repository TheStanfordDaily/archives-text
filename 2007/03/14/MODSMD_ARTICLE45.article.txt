Heath's 400-meter run was espe
cially impressive, bringing the Car
dinal up from 10th to fourth.

more, but I'm really happy with the
performance."

al championship in the winter quar
ter of my freshman year." Chandy
added. "It's just kind of crazy. I'm
lucky to be on a team with such
great guys.They're really good guys.
They're older than me. and they
helped me through the process. I'm
really happy to be on the team."

performance. Only two women

thing.

as the sixth-best team in the nation
and the men left with a fourth-place
