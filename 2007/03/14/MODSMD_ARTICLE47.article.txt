1. Elitists again?
The two-seed Cardinal will attempt to break its three-year streak of
Elite Eight losses, including last year's 62-59 heartbreaker against
Louisiana State. Stanford last reached the Final Four in 1997, when it
was defeated by Old Dominion (a possible second-round match for
the Cardinal), 83-82 in overtime.
2. Wiggins 7 Will
Candice Wiggins may have been out at the end of the regular season,
but she sure hasn't stopped. Having broken out again with dominating
performances at the Pac-10 Tournament (where she averaged 21.7
points per game and took home MVP honors), the junior guard is look
ing to make this "the year" in the NCAAs. Candice Wiggins may have

3. Senior Spurt
Brooke Smith, Kristen Newlin, Clare Bodensteinerand Markisha Coleman
all realize the pressure they face in keeping their years going. Smith (13.4

4. Home Cooking
Maples Pavilion has always been a Cardinal stronghold, and with seven

Fresno Stanford looks to serve up victories before going to Cleveland.
5. Familiar Faces...and New
LSU returns as a three-seed in the Fresno regional (albeit amid controver
sy over head coach Pokey Chatman's resignation and possible sex scan
dal), while the Connecticut Huskies are on the prowl as the one-seed.
