### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF- WRITER 
Men's head swimming coach Skip Ken
ney has been suspended with pay pending
an investigation into his decision to delete
the names of former athletes from record
books, Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby an
nounced Friday afternoon. The legendary
coach did not travel with the second
ranked Cardinal men yesterday, when the
team headed off to this week's NCAA
Championship meet in Minnesota.
"Coach Kenney readily admits he made
bad judgment." Bowlsby told 'Ihe Daily. "I
think there were punitive intentions. It was
an intentional act. 1 don't think it can be
taken anything but seriously."
lhe Daily reported Friday that Kenney
intentionally removed the times of five
swimmers from the team's media-guide
record books. Several of the swimmers ex
pressed in interviews their belief that the
omissions were purposeful and vindictive
an effort to get back at athletes who left
the program on bad terms.

The announcement came just days be
fore the most important meet of the season,
which begins at the University of Minneso
ta tomorrow. Associate head coach Ted
Knapp will coach the Card unassisted.
"Obviously it is a disruption for them at
a critical time of the year." Bowlsby said. "1
didn't have any control over the timing, and
neither did anyone else."
'ITie athletic director said he found out
about the expunged names Wednesday. On
Friday afternoon, he met with Knapp and a
few of the swimmers on the men's team.
"I certainly took into account the cham
pionship that our young men have trained
so hard for," Bowlsby said."l took action at
the time that the incident occurred. Cer
tainly the timing was less than ideal, but we
have to deal with it as it oceurs."
The athletic director, who began his
tenure last year, said that while an investi
gation will begin immediately, much of the
process will remain confidential.
"It certainly is not the sort of thing we
are going to want to play out in a public way
until the time we come to the conclusion of
the investigation process,"he said.citing the
sensitivity of the issue. "We'll try to bring it
to closure just as quickly as we can."

Skip Kenney watches his team practice in
2002. Kenney was suspended for
deleting the names of some former ath
letes from the 2007 media guide.
When asked if Kenney might leave
the University as a result of the inves
tigation. Bowlsby said he "won't spec
ulate on any outcome."
Hie revelation that one of the
I Jniversity's most prized and well
known coaches would conspire to ex
punge swimmers' names from the
record books took Bowlsby by sur
prise.
ITie times ot Jason Hummer '92,
Richard Eddy *06, Michael R.
McLean '06. Tobias Oriwol '06 and
Peter Carothers 'OS all disappeared
from the 2(X)7 media guide's list of
Stanford's all-time top-15 perform
ances. Fiach swimmer whose name
was missing from the guide had his
times removed from several different
events, meets and years.
While the times all appeared in the
2(X)h edition of the media guide, they
were also stricken from the top times
list on the official Stanford Athletics
Web site
(http://www.gostanford.com).
Kenney has coached the Stanford
men's swimming team since 1979, a
run that has included seven NCAA ti
tles as well as a conference-record 26
Pac-10 championships. He coached
the United States men's Olympic
swimming team at the 19% Atlanta
games, in which American male
swimmers won 15 gold medals.
In an interview with The Daily last
Thursday, Kenney initially claimed
that the omission had been an honest
mistake.
"I think it's just a mix-up some
how," he said. "I don't want toguessas
to why."
But by the afternoon, as other
media outlets began picking up on
the story, the University released a
statement from Kenney. in which the
coach apologized for a "serious mis
take in judgment."
"To exclude these five student
athletes from our media guide was an
error and it will be corrected immedi
ately." Kenney said. "I apologize for
my actions in this matter."
Bowlsby also released an official
statement Thursday, in which the ath
letic director denounced the omis
sions as "unacceptable" and said the
University "will immediately restore
our records to accurately reflect the
history of our men's swimming pro
gram."
