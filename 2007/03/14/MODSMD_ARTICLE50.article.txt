## Students, professors celebrate Pi Day's irrationalty, mathematically speaking 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1:59 p.m. might pass as an ordi
nary moment for many Stanford stu
dents this afternoon, but for Alison
Herson *07 and other pi fanatics, it
will he a cue to break out into song
the "Happy Pi Day" song.
Today is Pi Day. an unofficial hol
iday for math fans worldwide that is
chosen for the significance of the nu
merical date (3/14). At I:s9pm. the
approximation of the mathematical
constant pi will he drawn out to
3.14159 — the first few of a never
ending sequence of digits.
Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumfer
ence to its diameter in Euclidean
geometry, is an irrational number
whose calculation of digits has chal
lenged mathematicians for centuries.
In 2002, the Associated Press report
ed that University of Tokyo Profes
sor Yasumasa Kanada broke his own
world record for the calculation of
pi. With the aid of a supercomputer.
Kanada found pi to 1.24 trillion dec
imal places.
Herson, a symbolic systems major
who admits that she has "pi-fanati
cism," currently knows <S1 digits. She
said that her interest in pi first grew
out of circumstance.
"My senior year of high school, I
tutored math at a local community
college," Herson said in an email to
the Daily. "The tutoring room had a
banner wrapped along the ceiling
with the first 75 digits of pi. One day,
nobody showed up to be tutored. I
hadn't brought any work to do, so 1

thought. Hey. wouldn't it be neat to
memorize pi?' and started memoriz
ing the digits."
That was just the beginning. Her
son reported that her interest has
since grown, and she has received
books, t-shirts and even earrings
dedicated to pi — attire she'll be
wearing today, of course.
She has also inspired others to
join in on the pi bandwagon.
" Two summers ago,my boyfriend
at the time memorized 192 digits of
pi for me," Herson said.
At one point, Tina Lin *07, a math
major and member of the Facebook
group "3.14159265...," also knew
over 100 digits. Lin won't actively be

celebrating Pi Day this year, but
notes that she became interested in
the digits of pi as a challenge in her
high school calculus class.
" Two of my friends and 1 decided
to race to see who could memorize
the most digits," Lin recalled. "We'd
come into class and start reading
numbers to each other. Back then I
had more than 100 digits."
Stanford students aren't the only
ones who are pi aficionados. Electri
cal Engineering and Computer Sci
ence Professor Nick McKeown will
offer a freshman introductory semi
nar in the spring called 'ITie Magic
of Pi and Other Mathematical and
Physical Constants."

McKeown said he had a photo
graphic memory for numbers as a
child and used to learn square root
tables, logarithmic tables, and sec
tions of phone books for fun. As a
challenge, he also memorized digits
of pi.
Last year, at the Technology, Ed
ucation, Design conference in
Monterey, he gave a brief presenta
tion with A 1 (.lore seated in the
front row. But his talk wasn't about
his research instead, McKeown
juggled while reciting pi to 200
places.
Two hundred digits may seem like
a lot. but it still comes nowhere near
the world record. The Guinness
Book of World Records claims that
the sitting world record is 42.195 dig
its from 1995. but the Associated
Press has reported that Akira
llaraguchi of Japan recited 100,000
decimal places of pi in ()ctober 2006.
It took llaraguchi more than 16
hours to complete the feat.
Part of the difficulty and fun of
memorizing digits of pi is that there
is no noticeable pattern in the num
bers. l or pi fans, it is often interesting
to find personal connections to some
segment of the digits.
"There was one part [with] 510.
which was my hometown area code."
said Lin. "So I memorized those and
its subsequent digits like a phone
number."
Joachim De Lombaert '09, who
memorized 60 digits of pi for a con
test in the sixth grade, added, "My
birthday is located at digit
1,918,101." I le found this through an

online Web site.
I'or the curious, the official Pi Da\
website has published the first mil
lion digits of pi. along with a count
down to the big day.
Is knowing all these decimal
places of pi past the usual 3.14 a valu
able skill? McKeown is the first to
admit it is useless.
"It has no value whatsoever it
just clutters up your brain." he said.
"It's like juggling. It's just fun."

I'i seems to be a good excuse for
math fans to have a good time. The
Exploratorium in San Francisco is
hosting its annual Pi Day festivities
today, with pizza pies and fruit pies.
As an added bonus, the Explorato
rium's site notes that today would
also be Albert Kinstein's 128 th
birthday.
