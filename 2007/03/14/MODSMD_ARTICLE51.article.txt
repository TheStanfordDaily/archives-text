### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Steve Bing '87 has rescinded a

versity due to concerns surrounding
the public advertisement of Stan
ford's research partnership with
ExxonMobil.
Bing — a Hollywood movie pro
ducer and son of prominent donors
Helen and Peter Bing '55 — has also
said that he will not make any future
gifts to the University, The San Jose
Mercury News reported Sunday. His
previous donations to Stanford total
$22.5 million.
Bing reportedly became con
cerned after seeing television and
newspaper advertisements promot
ing the University's 2002 research
deal with ExxonMobil, the world's
largest private oil company.
"Exxon Mobil is trying to green
wash itself, and it's usini; Stanford as

its brush." Yusef Robb. who has
worked with Bing on climate issues,
told The Mercury News. "We think
that people who give to Stanford do
so because they want to help the fu
ture leaders of this nation, not be
cause they want to advance the agen
da of ExxonMobil."
Bing declined to make himself
available for public comment on the
matter and only made statements
through Robb. Calls to Robb from
Ihe Daily were not returned.
While University officials would
not comment on Bing's decision, cit
ing the confidentiality of private do
nations. they defended the partner
ship with ExxonMobil.
"(W]e can say that we are proud of
our work on seeking solutions to seri
ous energy and environmental prob
lems and our collaborations in these
areas with a variety of private and
non-profit organizations," said Elaine
Ray. a university spokeswoman, in an

email to Hie Daily.
Bing's parents have their names
attached to a number of the Universi
ty's buildings and programs — in
cluding the Bing Wing of Green Li
brary, the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram and Bing Nursery School. Peter
Bing has also been a chairman of
Stanford's Board of Trustees.
ITie partnership between the Uni
versity and ExxonMobil is expected
to net Stanford $100 million over 10
years to fund climate and energy re
search. The deal has been advertised
in such high-profile places as the front
page of The Wall Street Journal and
The New York limes. Many of the ad
vertisements stressed the potential
environmental and energy benefits of
the research.
Bing's decision has also had an ef
fect beyond the Stanford campus. On
Monday, the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights (FTCR),a Cal
ifornia consumer watchdog group.

called on UC-Berkeley to cancel a
$500 million research deal that is in
the works between the school and BP,
a global energy giant.
"ExxonMobil wrapped itself in the
mantle of one of California's leading
research institutionsandismilkingthat

son. an FTCR consumer advocate, in a
press release. "We cannot allow BP to
dothesamethingwithCalifornia'spre

Under Stanford's partnership with
ExxonMobil, the oil company re
serves five-year, exclusive rights to
any discoveries resulting from the re
search it funds. The money from the
deal goes to the University's Global
Climate and Energy Project (GCEP),
