## Campaign to preserve historic house fails 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
When Palo Alto city officials
voted last week to allow the de
struction of the Juana Briones
House, a handful of students in
History Prof. Albert Camarillo's
"Public History and Public Ser
vice" seminar realized that their
exhibition on the house and its his
tory' tomorrow afternoon would
be purely symbolic. They re
mained optimistic, however, that
their work would raise awareness
about cultural issues off campus.
Havingspent much of the quar
ter studying the Briones House —
which is located on Old Adobe
Road, near the intersection of
Arastradero Road and Interstate
280 — Camarillo and his class
joined in what proved to be a fruit
less effort to preserve the adobe
structure, which was built in the
1840s.
Born in 1802. Juana Briones
was a Latina businesswoman, hu
manitarian and landowner of Eu
ropean, Native American and
African roots whose parents
helped found the modern cities of
San Francisco and San Jose, ac
cording to the Web site
(http://www.brioneshouse.org) of
the Juana Briones Heritage Foun
dational group dedicated to saving
the house from destruction.
Camarillo's students said they
developed a respect for Briones as
they studied her.
Sarah Kleinman '08 described
her as "a female who made a name
for herself in a man's world."
According to Camarillo and
Edna Kimbro, an expert on his
toric adobe structures who is cited
on the Foundation's Web site, the
house highlights a rare construc
tion method, and only one other
similarly-constructed building re
mains in California today.
While the house stayed in the
Briones family for many years,
Jaim Nulman and Avelyn Welczer
purchased the home in 1997.They

filed for a demolition permit the
following year.
The community fought hack
immediately, and in 1998. neigh
borhood members formed the
Juana Briones Heritage Founda
tion to preserve the home.
The legal battle ended last
week, however, as officials ap
proved the demolition permit.
Palo Alto City Director of
Planning and Community Envi
ronment Steve Emslie said that
the decision to approve the permit
was not an easy one.
"We [the city of Palo Alto] lost
a long fight." Emslie said.
Camarillo. who works with the
Foundation, became interested in
the Briones House because of its
connection to his work with Mexi
can-American history. He decided
to teach a class centered around
the house because doing so would
allow students to have both hands
on experience as public historians
and the opportunity to contribute
to public service.
As part of tomorrow's exhibit,
each student will present a differ
ent aspect of the Briones House.
The class hopes the exhibition will
remind attendees of the impor
tance of preserving public history.
"I hope awareness spreads to
the rest of the student body about
the importance of fighting to save
important elements of history and
how easily they can be lost," Chris
tine Hironaka "09 said in an email
to The Daily.
None of the five students in Ca
marillo's seminar had heard of the
Briones House prior to taking the
class.
"1 think we have all become
personally invested," Joe Sexton
'07 said in an email to The Daily,
"in efforts to preserve the house
since the start of the course."
The exhibition will be held to
morrow from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. in
Building 200, room 307.
