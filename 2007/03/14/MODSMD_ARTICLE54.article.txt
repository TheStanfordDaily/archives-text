## New technology enables mouse-free Web surfing 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Imagine surfing the Internet using
only your eyes and a keyboard. With the
new Gaze-enhanced User Interface De
sign project (GIJIDe). computer users
can now navigate software using eye
tracking technology instead of a mouse.
Computer science doctoral student
Manu Kumar created the software that
enables every day computer users to use
eye-tracking technology. His applica
tions will allow users to navigate the In
ternet. scroll through text documents
and type passwords — all without the
use of a mouse or track pad.
Though seemingly novel, eye-track
ing technology is not new — it has been

used in the past for various reasons.
"Previous work on eye-tracking has
had two main directions," said Kumar's
adviser Terry Winograd, professor of
computer science. "One is for people
who can only use eyes, such as quadri
plegics. (...) The second is for studies in
which we want to understand where peo
ple are looking when they work on the
computer."
"Manu's innovation is in looking at
how direct use of eye-tracking can be
valuable even for people who are able to
also use the mouse, keyboard, etc.." he
added.
The interface of the computer has
built-in infrared lights that shine into the
user's eyes, Kumar explained. A camera
senses the reflection and the computer

uses that information to pinpoint where
the user is looking.
"Now you don't have to move the
mouse to click on it," Kumar said.
"You're already looking at it."
Kumar has developed approximately
10 different applications in his research
thus far.
One practical — and potentially
identity-theft preventing — application
of Kumar's software is the "password"
program. When a password is required, a
large keyboard appears on the screen.
The user then enters a password simply
by looking at the screen keyboard's let
ters.
"It's really easy to see what [ users) are
typing, but hard to tell where they are
looking." Kumar said."[ By using the eye

tracking software,] people can't do
shoulder surfing."
Kumar has concluded in initial testing
that users find the eye-tracking software
easy to learn and easy to use.
"It's remarkably natural — you get
used to it pretty fast," said Jeff Klingner,
a doctoral student in computer science.
"I'd say it's gotten a little hit easier [since
my initial use],but it was pretty easy from
the beginning."
Kumar expects the eye-tracking tech
nology and software will be available for
the public only when it becomes more af
fordable. The technology currently costs
$25,(XK).
