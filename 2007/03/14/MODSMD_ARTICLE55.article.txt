## Univ, contractor to reach settlement 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
llie University is 112 inalizing the terms of a settlement with
one of its contractors over the breakdown of a dehumidifica
tion unit at the Medical School, both parties told The Daily.
Citing the destruction of sensitive DNA technology in a
Medical School facility. Stanford sued contractor Rudolph &
Sletten at the end of January for negligence and breach of
contract.The University claimed that a dehumidification unit
provided by the contractor for the Stanford Functional Ge
nomics Facility (SFGF) caused the loss of the DNA technol
ogy.
"The temperature and humidity problems at the Func
tional Genomics Facility in the CCSR Basement prevented
[the Stanford facility] from operating at optimal capacity and
culminated in the destruction of over S(H) [DNA] Micro Ar
rays." the I Jniversity said in its Jan. 30 legal complaint.
As a result, the University claimed that in early 2004, the
temperature at the SFGF fell "drastically" and the humidity
level increased. The University said the environmental
changes prevented the facility from operating for two days
and eventually resulted in the microarrays' destruction.
Rudolph & Sletten President Martin Sisemore acknowl
edged this claim.
"It was a tailed component on a dehumidification system,
as was stated in the suit," he said."lt was repaired a few days
after that and has been working successfully ever since."
SFGF is a Core Facility in the School of Medicine. The
Core Facilities aim to provide Stanford researchers with ac
cess to the technology required for medical research. SFGF
provides custom DNA microarrays to researchers who are
members of the Stanford community.
Microarrays allow medical researchers to compare the
DNA from two different individuals and locate small genetic
differences.
"You can |use microarrays] to compare cancer cells with
normal tissue," said John Coller.a research and development
engineer at SFGF. "You can look at any biological sample
that has DNA in it. There are literally tons of things that you
can do."
According to ("oiler, the facility makes approximately
10.000 microarrays every year. He explained that humidity
and temperature are carefully managed in the facility in
order to optimize the working environment.
"If there are fluctuations," he said,"things are not as con
trollable."
Both sides of the suit acknowledged earlier this month
that an agreement was in the process of being finalized.
"That issue has been successfully resolved and we suspect
that the lawsuit will be withdrawn within a couple days," Sise
more said."lt was a relatively minor issue."
"It's my understanding that the case has been settled," Se
nior I Jniversity Counsel Patrick Dunkley agreed.
According to Coller, SFGF is currently fully operational.
