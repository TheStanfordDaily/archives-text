# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Green dorm project moves forward 
### ANNIE JIA 
Row houses are usually associated
with parties and good fix>d.not with en
vironmentally-friendly features like
solar panels, low-tlow shower heads and
a plug-in hybrid car station. The Green
Dorm — which is nearing its fundrais
ing goal and could be within two or
three years of completion, according to
students and faculty associated with the
project — aims to change all that.
The Green Dorm received a $75.0(X)
grant from the Environmental Protec
tion Agency last May, and the School of
Engineering and the Offices of Devel
opment plan to complete a $12 million
fundraising campaign for the sustain
able dorm sometime this summer or
fall. Once fundraising is complete, it will
take about one year to finalize the
building design and another year for
construction, according to officials.
The project's organizers not only plan
to incorporate the latest environmen
tally-friendly technologies into the
Green Dorm, but also want to create a
community in which residents will learn
about sustainability through immer
sion.
"The goal is to develop a building
and a place and a community that fos
ters that type of sustainable lifestyle for
the mainstream," said Civil and Envi
ronmental Engineering Lecturer Mike
Lin, who is involved in the Green Dorm
project.
While raising the money for the
dorm's construction is the first priority.
Green Dorm officials also want to es

tablish a University endowment for the
sustainable building.
"The endowment would allow us to
plug and play with new technologies
and devices," said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Richard
Luthy in an email to The Daily. "Many
of the special features of building will
evolve over time.This will maintain stu
dent and faculty involvement and help
create an exciting and fun place to both
live and study."
Luthy said the University has
showed its continued support of the
Green Dorm project by including it as
part of the Stanford Challenge, a $4.3
billion fundraising endeavor.
A number of research projects con
nected to disciplines ranging i p rom soci
ology to computer science, product de
sign to medicine will be incorporated
into the Green Dorm project
"It will be exciting to go into the next
phase of the project, and really start to
work with the design professionals and
transfer all that stuff we've gathered in
academia over to an actual project,"
said Jen Tobias '08, a student researcher
and course coordinator for Lin's class
on the Green Dorm.
Some of this research examines tra
ditional environmental issues such as
energy and water consumption, but an
increasing number of projects are tak
ing unconventional approaches to
studying what it means to be sustain
able.
According to Lin, one student is
studying the sociology of sustainable
communities. Green Dorrn project

leaders also hope to work with the
Graduate School of Business to deter
mine the economic, emotional and
physiological effects of living in a sus
tainable building.
"The goal of the research is not just
to design that plug in [a hybrid] solu
tion. but to design solutions that invoke
a mental and ultimately cultural shift
among the residents that will live in the
dorm," Lin said.
In addition to the eclectic student re
search it has prompted, the Green
Dorm project has also encouraged high
levels of collaboration among students,
faculty, administrators and contractors.
"Ihe broad-based participation by
students and faculty from a wide range
of disciplines speaks to the power of its
vision of sustainability," said Laura
Breyfogle, senior associate dean in the
School of Engineering.
Ultimately, the Green Dorm project
hopes to revolutionize the thinking be
hind sustainable architecture, and or
ganizers hope the new residence will
prove a model for future buildings.
"Hopefully we're going to have in
stilled in the project the DNA for how
you can go about thinking about the so
cial and environmental crisis in a com
pletely different way," Lin said. "And
with any hope,someday there will be no
more social and environmental crisis,
and the Green Dorm can just be a
dorm, and eventually hopefully every
dorm will be a green dorm."
