# STUDENT LIFE
## Task force eyes mental health issues 
### LIA HARDIN NIRAJ SHETH STAFF WRITERS 
Amid rising concern for mental
health on campus, a select group of fac
ulty, administrators and students have
been working behind the scenes to bet
ter understand and improve mental
health at Stanford.
The Student Mental Health and
WellbeingTask Force,as it is known, was
organized by Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman last fall and re
ports directly to his office.
"The task force was created in re
sponse to the recognition that the preva
lence and complexity of student mental
health issues has been growing both na
tionally and here at Stanford," Board
man said in an email to The Daily.
The task force is composed of two
separate committees. Hie first is the
Campus Climate Study Group, led by
Acting Dean for Religious Life Patricia
Karlin-Neumann and Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) Director
Alejandro Martinez. The second is the
Policy and Practice Review Committee,
headed by Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, and Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers.
While the groups are part of a single
task force and study the same issues, they
do so with different viewpoints.
"They're looking at it from the prac
tical perspective," Powers said, "and
we're looking at it from policy perspec
tive."
A third, smaller working group
charged with directly gathering informa
tion about campus climate is comprised
of eight individuals who also sit on the
Campus Climate Study Group.
"We got picked to do real legwork,
getting a frame in place for 'capturing
the fog' — what makes the Stanford cli
mate what it is,"said Denise Clark Pope,
a lecturer in the School of Education,
who sits on the small working group.
The Campus Climate group meets in
its entirety twice a quarter, but the small
working group meets on a weekly basis
to gather information on the mental
health climate at the I Jniversity and on
what Pope called a national mental
health crisis.
When students get into Stanford, she
said, they immediately have to begin to
deal with issues related to academic
stress, and some students do not have
the skills necessary to deal with the
pressure.
"One of the things that the group
has tried to do is to look both at un
derlying causes and manifestations of
stress, said Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Resource
Center (LGBT-CRC) Director Ben
Davidson, who sits on the working
group of the Campus Climate com
mittee. "Sometimes they are indistin
guishable."
The other part of the task force is
charged with reviewing existing Uni
versity policies and making recom
mendations for changes.
"We're still in the information
gathering stage," Powers said. "We
haven't gotten to the stage where we
say/Let's rewrite this.'"
She described a wide range of Uni
versity rules that the policy commit
tee has looked at, including medical
leave policies and emergency contact
information.
AFTER THE RECENT DEATHS
The task force's progress was
slowed earlier this quarter when it
shifted focus from information gath
ering to making resources available
to students, a transition following the
student deaths that occurred this win
ter. The apparent suicide of Mengyao
"May" Zhou in January increased
student and community conscious
ness about mental health issues.
"There have been four deaths in a
really small community," said Haas
Center Director Nicole Taylor, who is
also a Resident Fellow in Burbank.
"We needed to make sure to reach
out to the community and say,' These

resources are here."'
"Mental health is an important
issue tor our whole community," she
added. "Something needed to he
said."
Members of the Campus Climate
group emphasized that although the
response to the recent deaths has
been one of the group's most impor
tant functions thus far. the task force's
role is to evaluate the campus climate
as a whole, not to focus on the smaller
number of students suffering from
acute mental health disorders.
"It's not serving an ombuds kind of
tunction," Karlin-Neumann said. "1
don't see us being engaged in a suicide
prevention effort. We're involved in a
campus climate evaluation."
THE STANFORD DUCK SYNDROME
Many task force members said the
most important campus climate issue
discussed thus far is the so-called
'Stanford Duck Syndrome' — the
idea that Stanford students are calm
on the surface but frantically working
to stay afloat underneath.
"The Stanford Duck Syndrome
comes up in almost every situation,"
Karlin-Neumann said. Davidson,
Pope,Taylor and Martinez concurred.
But others did not place as much
emphasis on the analogy. Unlike her
colleagues on the Campus Climate
group, for example, Powers said that
the Stanford Duck Syndrome "has
not really been a part of our work."
Other people on the task force
also agreed, saying that too much at
tention to the metaphor could over
simplify mental health issues on cam
pus.
"Not everything about mental
health revolves around the Stanford
Duck Syndrome," said Alejandro De
Los Angeles '07, a student represen
tative on the Campus Climate Study
Group. "The mental health of Stan
ford students cannot be reduced to
one oversimplified metaphor. We're

just not that simple."
Friedman, who is also one of five
members of the task force's Steering
Committee, said that what the task
force ultimately recommends will de
pend on the work they will he doing in
the upcoming months. While the
Stanford Duck Syndrome figures to
be a significant focus for the task
force, it is too soon to tell what the re
sults will be, he said.
"We do not know if we will be
making specific recommendations
for [the Stanford Duck Syndrome],"
he said. "That is not the stage we are
at right now."
IN THE FUTURE
Because the task force is still in the
information-gathering stage, many
members declined to talk about pos
sible recommended changes to Uni
versity policies. A few people, howev
er, did offer preliminary suggestions.
"We could probably be doing a
better job making sure that the peo
ple that students come to are aware of
the resources," Davidson said. "Some
students are savvy. Some students
need help accessing resources."
"Some universities offer a course
for all incoming students," he added.
"My sense is that there is a great inter
est on looking at how we can develop
support systems."
The Task Force will be establishing
a method to gain student input on a
more consistent basis. The effort will
include focus groups and an online
feedback mechanism. Pope said.
Originally, the Task Force was sup
posed to deliver a set of policy recom
mendations to Provost John
Etchemendy by the end of the year, but
members have since indicated that the
timeline will be extended slightly due to
a shift in focus after the recent deaths.

on the surface but frantically working
to stay afloat underneath.
"The Stanford Duck Syndrome
comes up in almost every situation,"
Karlin-Neumann said. Davidson,
Pope,Taylor and Martinez concurred.
But others did not place as much
emphasis on the analogy. Unlike her
colleagues on the Campus Climate
group, for example, Powers said that
the Stanford Duck Syndrome "has
not really been a part of our work."
Other people on the task force
also agreed, saying that too much at
tention to the metaphor could over
simplify mental health issues on cam
pus.
"Not everything about mental
health revolves around the Stanford
Duck Syndrome," said Alejandro De
Los Angeles '07, a student represen
tative on the Campus Climate Study
Group. "The mental health of Stan
ford students cannot be reduced to
one oversimplified metaphor. We're

just not that simple."
Friedman, who is also one of five
members of the task force's Steering
Committee, said that what the task
force ultimately recommends will de
pend on the work they will he doing in
the upcoming months. While the
Stanford Duck Syndrome figures to
be a significant focus for the task
force, it is too soon to tell what the re
sults will be, he said.
"We do not know if we will be
making specific recommendations
for [the Stanford Duck Syndrome],"
he said. "That is not the stage we are
at right now."
IN THE FUTURE
Because the task force is still in the
information-gathering stage, many
members declined to talk about pos
sible recommended changes to Uni
versity policies. A few people, howev
er, did offer preliminary suggestions.
"We could probably be doing a
better job making sure that the peo
ple that students come to are aware of
the resources," Davidson said. "Some
students are savvy. Some students
need help accessing resources."
"Some universities offer a course
for all incoming students," he added.
"My sense is that there is a great inter
est on looking at how we can develop
support systems."
The Task Force will be establishing
a method to gain student input on a
more consistent basis. The effort will
include focus groups and an online
feedback mechanism. Pope said.
Originally, the Task Force was sup
posed to deliver a set of policy recom
mendations to Provost John
Etchemendy by the end of the year, but
members have since indicated that the
timeline will be extended slightly due to
a shift in focus after the recent deaths.

Amid rising concern for mental
health on campus, a select group of fac
ulty, administrators and students have
been working behind the scenes to bet
ter understand and improve mental
health at Stanford.
The Student Mental Health and
WellbeingTask Force,as it is known, was
organized by Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman last fall and re
ports directly to his office.
"The task force was created in re
sponse to the recognition that the preva
lence and complexity of student mental
health issues has been growing both na
tionally and here at Stanford," Board
man said in an email to The Daily.
The task force is composed of two
separate committees. Hie first is the
Campus Climate Study Group, led by
Acting Dean for Religious Life Patricia
Karlin-Neumann and Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) Director
Alejandro Martinez. The second is the
Policy and Practice Review Committee,
headed by Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, and Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers.
While the groups are part of a single
task force and study the same issues, they
do so with different viewpoints.
"They're looking at it from the prac
tical perspective," Powers said, "and
we're looking at it from policy perspec
tive."
A third, smaller working group
charged with directly gathering informa
tion about campus climate is comprised
of eight individuals who also sit on the
Campus Climate Study Group.
"We got picked to do real legwork,
getting a frame in place for 'capturing
the fog' — what makes the Stanford cli
mate what it is,"said Denise Clark Pope,
a lecturer in the School of Education,
who sits on the small working group.
The Campus Climate group meets in
its entirety twice a quarter, but the small
working group meets on a weekly basis
to gather information on the mental
health climate at the I Jniversity and on
what Pope called a national mental
health crisis.
When students get into Stanford, she
said, they immediately have to begin to
deal with issues related to academic
stress, and some students do not have
the skills necessary to deal with the
pressure.
"One of the things that the group
has tried to do is to look both at un
derlying causes and manifestations of
stress, said Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Resource
Center (LGBT-CRC) Director Ben
Davidson, who sits on the working
group of the Campus Climate com
mittee. "Sometimes they are indistin
guishable."
The other part of the task force is
charged with reviewing existing Uni
versity policies and making recom
mendations for changes.
"We're still in the information
gathering stage," Powers said. "We
haven't gotten to the stage where we
say/Let's rewrite this.'"
She described a wide range of Uni
versity rules that the policy commit
tee has looked at, including medical
leave policies and emergency contact
information.
AFTER THE RECENT DEATHS
The task force's progress was
slowed earlier this quarter when it
shifted focus from information gath
ering to making resources available
to students, a transition following the
student deaths that occurred this win
ter. The apparent suicide of Mengyao
"May" Zhou in January increased
student and community conscious
ness about mental health issues.
"There have been four deaths in a
really small community," said Haas
Center Director Nicole Taylor, who is
also a Resident Fellow in Burbank.
"We needed to make sure to reach
out to the community and say,' These

resources are here."'
"Mental health is an important
issue tor our whole community," she
added. "Something needed to he
said."
Members of the Campus Climate
group emphasized that although the
response to the recent deaths has
been one of the group's most impor
tant functions thus far. the task force's
role is to evaluate the campus climate
as a whole, not to focus on the smaller
number of students suffering from
acute mental health disorders.
"It's not serving an ombuds kind of
tunction," Karlin-Neumann said. "1
don't see us being engaged in a suicide
prevention effort. We're involved in a
campus climate evaluation."
THE STANFORD DUCK SYNDROME
Many task force members said the
most important campus climate issue
discussed thus far is the so-called
'Stanford Duck Syndrome' — the
idea that Stanford students are calm
on the surface but frantically working
to stay afloat underneath.
"The Stanford Duck Syndrome
comes up in almost every situation,"
Karlin-Neumann said. Davidson,
Pope,Taylor and Martinez concurred.
But others did not place as much
emphasis on the analogy. Unlike her
colleagues on the Campus Climate
group, for example, Powers said that
