# Networking effectively
## 
### Chaz Kyser 
Some people cringe when they hear the word "networking,"
especially those just starting out in their careers. Ilie idea of
"meeting and greeting" strangers intimidates them, and seek
ing out people who can possibly help them advance profession
ally brings out the fear of rejection. Yet, the old adage. "It's not
what you know, but who you know," could not be truer for
those just starting out in their careers.
Building up a network of people that will help you grow
and thrive is a task you'll be both consciously and uncon
sciously doing for the rest of your life. You have to always be
on the lookout for people in both high and low places that
can be added to your network. There are individuals out
there who can help you land your dream job. turn you on to
professions you never thought twice about, give you an idea
to bring in truckloads of dough, or simply change your life
just by being supportive—and you haven't even met them
yet. And you won't, if you don't make networking an ongo
ing task.
lliere are various ways you can build your network:
'llirough colleagues and business associates; through member
ships in professional and civic organizations; through your rel
atives, friends, and their peers; through religious involvement;
through social functions and community events; through vol
unteering; and through conferences for people in your profes
sion.
Most of the networking you'll do will take place informal
ly—with people you'll meet without even trying. But there will
likely be a host of events organized for the sole purpose of net
working that you will attend. Hie following are networking tips
for you to utilize during these events.
Before the l-'unctimi:
•Review your purpose for attending the function. Are you
coming to meet a specific person, get some contacts in your
profession, or just learn more about the hosts of the func
tion?
•Plan to arrive on time for the function. If you're attending
a meeting that offers networking before it starts, arrive

early enough to participate in the networking portion of the
meeting.
•Create a 20-30 second introduction about yourself.
Example: "III! I'm Shiloh Davis. I'll be graduating from
Langston I Jniversity in May with a degree in accounting.
Right now I'm searching for an entry-level position in the
accounting field, preferably on the West Coast."
•Brainstorm a couple of questions that could help you get a
conversation started. Have more than enough professional
looking business cards with you, and make sure you have
easy access to them.
•Make sure you are dressed appropriately. Professional
networking events normally call for business casual attire.
At the luiictioii:
•( ireet people you know so you can be introduced to others.
• Introduce yourself to the host of the event. Request
introductions to people whom the host recom
mends you meet.
•Take the initiative to introduce yourself to other people,
especially people who may have seen you once or twiee but
were never introduced to you.
•Introduce others to people you've just met.

"There are individuals out there who can help you land your dream job, turn you on
to professions you never thought twice about, give you an idea to bring in truckoads
of dough, or simply change your life by being supportive —and you haven't even met
them yet. And you won't, if you don't make networking an ongoing task."

•Exchange cards wilh the people you meet.
Al'ler (lie Function:
•Write a note to yourself on the back of the business cards
you're given—something that will help jog your memory
about people when you look at their cards again. Also
include the date and name of the function.
•Contact those individuals who interested you. seeing how
you may be able to help each other in some endeavor.
•Think about how you could have networked better. Did
you miss out on an opportunity to meet someone because
you were scared or didn't know how to break into a conver
sation? Did you neglect to tell people something important
about you and your line of work? You did bring enough
business cards, didn't you?
Becoming a networking pro may take a little time, but alter
enough of these events you'll be able to work a room of profes
sionals like you worked a room full of your college peers at the
parties you miss. Ihe only difference is that working the room
now could mean working your way up in your professional career.
