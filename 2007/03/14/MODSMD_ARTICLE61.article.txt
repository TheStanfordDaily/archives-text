Advertising
Most jobs in the advertising profession are
found in the more than ten thousand advertis
ing agencies that create and place advertising
of every type in thousands of media sources.
The remaining jobs are on the client side,
either working with the agencies, or in an in
house advertising capacity.
Agencies handle the marketing process
from even before the pitch until after the ad
has been placed. Everything from coming up
with a product concept to negotiating valuable
placement of ads. Because of the broad nature
of the business, there is a great deal of variety
as well as requirements. Though much of what
you will learn on the job is industry specific,
general understanding of business and a basic
ability to manage (projects as well as people)
are essential.
In all agencies the jobs usually fall into five
categories: account management, creative
department, media, market research and sup
port services. Entry level positions in the five
areas are as follows:
•Account Management Assistant Account
Executive
'Creative Department Junior Writer,
Assistant Copywriter or Copy Trainee, Asst.
•Art Director, Art Asst. or Web Designer
•Media Assistant Media Planner, Assistant
Media Buyer
• Market Research Research Assistant,
Research Trainee
•Support Services accounting, personnel, cler
ical and office services
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
The environment of a large advertising
agency is extremely demanding, hectic, fast
paced, and competitive. Twelve-hour days are
more the norm than the exception and week
end work is not uncommon. Advertising is
hierarchical, so expect to do grunt work as an
entry level anything, and to be the first volun
teered to stay late. Once you have paid your
dues, you can be an Account Executive or a
Copywriter, or a Media Buyer. If you are on
the creative side, you will be pressed for ideas
on what is popular with particular target mar
kets. Keeping in touch with the latest trends,
fads, etc. is a must. If you are on the account
side, your job is more to service the client -
make sure their needs are met, provide
research for potential pitches, perhaps study
prior campaign launches, etc. On the media
side, you will be contacting program directors
for radio and TV, arranging for air time. For
print campaigns, you'll negotiate placement in
magazines, newspapers and websites.
Although many cities have active advertis

ing communities. New York City is still the
hub of the advertising industry. Chicago, San
Francisco and Los Angeles also house adver
tising agencies.
Skills
To enjoy work in advertising, having LOTS
of energy, patience and creativity is a tremen
dous plus. You have to love the manic, the
highly fashionable, and the opinionated.
There is variety in this line of work because
each client is unique, and has to be serviced
differently.
Skills to have include on-the-spot creativi
ty, persistence, ability to follow orders well
and quickly, and to ask as few unnecessary
questions as possible. Web-based technical
skills are also important. Advertising is com
petitive and artistic, and there are lots of peo
ple who would do your job for half your mea
ger pay (while living with parents, of course),
so it is important to do your job well. There
are no excuses for a job poorly done because
you can be easily replaced. So pay close atten
tion to detail, follow through on all pending
projects, negotiate with clients (usually about
extending a deadline).
Education & Preparation
BA or BS, preferably in Communication,
English, Journalism, Business, Economics,
Advertising, or Graphic Art.
Internships: the only way to get ahead in
advertising right from the beginning is to
intern at advertising agencies in different
capacities. If you can get a couple summers
experience in, you will be much more desir
able as an entry-level candidate than someone
without that experience, since so much of the
work done is on-the-job training. Having that
exposure to procedure and lingo will definite
ly help you.

Public Relations
Public Relations is building, maintaining or
promoting the reputation or image of a com
pany, product, personality, organization or
cause that will impact and influence public
opinion, alter behavior, generate interest and
support or enhance a favorable image or rep
utation. The Public Relations (PR) profes
sional is responsible for creating and maintain
ing the image its client wishes to project. It is a
serious profession where dedication, experi
ence and education are essential. Today's PR
professional must be a strategic planner and
problem- solver with an ability to be creative,
perceptive and persuasive. People in this field
are above average communicators with strong
interpersonal skills and an ability to build
images. They are multi-taskers with emotional
intelligence, who can impact change behind
the scenes while maintaining a high degree of
team spirit.
The main components to Public Relations
(each not necessarily a part of all corporations,

organizations or public relations firms), are:
•Media Relations - perhaps the most domi
nant function of public relations.
•Speechwriters - focus is primarily to write
speeches for the CEO and other top execu
tives.
•Issues Management - deals with matters
affecting corporations in the present and
potential future.
•Employee Communications - prepare quar
terly and annual reports for the organization,
and employee publications.
•Corporate Contributions - oversees the poli
cy and contributions for the company.
•Community Relations - the key to the orga
nization's involvement in the local and nation
al community.
• Public Affairs - helps an organization under
stand and communicate with the government
and its agencies.
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
It does not matter if you are interested in
working at a large or small public relations
firm or in the public relations department of a
large corporation; the work environment is
fast-paced, demanding, and very competitive.
Those interested in the field should be mature,
creative, resistant to stress, highly motivated
and flexible, yet decisive and able to take
risks. It is a myth that public relations is glam
orous and that PR professionals "do lunch"
and "shmooze" all day. Exciting yes, but glam
orous it is not. They must attend client meet
ings that can begin at 7 am or as late as 7 pm,
or make major revisions of articles or speech
es with a short turn-around-time. In some
cases, PR professionals are required to travel
out of town several days a month. They must
always be prepared to meet with top execu
tives at unscheduled times.
Skills
Successful PR professionals possess several
of the following skills and abilities:
•Outstanding planning & organizational
skills to plan programs, recommend activities
or events. This involves analyzing problems,
creating opportunities, defining goals and
extreme flexibility.
•Research and evaluation abilities that
include gathering information and fact find
ing. This is done through interviewing, sur
veys, and working with firms specializing in
and conducting opinion research.
•Clear writing style is a must for preparing
reports, news releases, film scripts, articles,
executive speeches, product information and
employee publications.
•Knowledge of how the media works to
disseminate material to media sources. This
means getting to the right editor/producer
with the right publication/program and at the
right time.
•Interpersonal and oral communication
abilities. This includes addressing individuals
and groups and representing the corporation
at community and business functions.
•Knowledge of the techniques of art. lay
out. typography, photography and desktop
publishing.
Education & Preparation
It is recommended that the PR professional
have a BA or BS degree in
PR/Communications, Marketing, Advertising,
Economics, English Literature or Journalism.
However, there are increasing number of PR
professionals with Master's degrees in
Communications and Business Administration.
Familiarity with word processing, data base

applications and the Internet are important due
to high-tech, hot growth industries, and the
high demand for services. Internships in the
field are highly recommended.

Marketing
According to the American Marketing
Association (AMA), marketing is "the
process of planning and executing the concep
tion, pricing, promotion, and distribution of
ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges
that satisfy individual and organizational
goals."
The field of marketing can be broken down
into the areas of product development, prod
uct marketing, brand management, marketing
research, internet marketing, product support,
strategic planning, advertising, public rela
tions, promotions, corporate communication,
physical distribution, sales, and retailing. The
consumer goods, high-tech, and manufactur
ing industries hire marketing staff to serve in
many of these functional areas.
Consumer Products Marketing: This
department is involved with planning, intro
ducing, and managing one or more products
throughout the product's existence. Individual
jobs include product planners, product mar
keting specialists, product planning managers,
and product marketing engineers.
Product Development: Typically this takes
place at the corporate level, where strategic
planners and upper-level management assess
marketplace trends and business goals. Their
decisions are based on customer require
ments; designers' and service originators'
requirements; research and development
needs; sales staff requests.
Marketing Research: Marketing research
analysts study market trends and analyze data
to help marketing managers make decisions
about new and existing products and services.
Market researchers may work for the market
ing research department of a company, a mar
keting research firm or as an independent con
sultant.
Marketing Communications (marcom):
According to the AMA, the marketing com
munications staff "inform, persuade, and
remind various audiences about an organiza
tion's products or services." Advertising may
be conducted through brochures, direct mail,
trade journals, professional publications, mag
azines, and the internet. Sales promotion can
take place at trade shows and exhibits.
Internet Marketing: Internet marketing
topics include advertising on the World Wide
Web, Web business models, Web marketing
planning, legal aspects of electronic market
ing, and electronic commerce and security.
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
Marketing work is done in teams, with the
exception of market researchers who some
times work alone analyzing data. Marketing
communicators are required to interview staff
members and customers in order to promote a
product. In most marketing positions, individ
uals must work their way up in the organiza-
tion by starting in an entry-level
capacity as a marketing assistant.
Marketing staff typically have
regular work hours, although
depending on the industry, it is not
unusual to work late on reports
and meet with other team mem
bers. Marketing staff can be called
on to travel as part of their job.
People in marketing spend much
of the day contacting and meeting
others; therefore, those who enjoy
meeting new people of diverse
backgrounds should find the work
stimulating.
Skills
Consumer products marketers
use communication, interpersonal,
and sales skills; and must demon
strate interest in competition, ere

ativity, enthusiasm, strength of con
viction, empathy, and assertiveness.
Product developers use creative,
research, conceptual, and design
skills; and must demonstrate interest
in future trends, thinking globally,
and be a team player. Product mar
keters use management, leadership,
creative, forecasting, planning, and
communication skills; and must
demonstrate interest in future
trends and promotions, be product
oriented and able to deal with ambi
guity.
Marketing researchers use
research, analytic, writing, commu
nication, and quantitative skills; and
must demonstrate interest in con
ducting surveys and interviews,
gathering data, using statistical
applications, compiling summaries,
being a team player, working inde

pendently. and presenting results in
a concise manner. Marketing com
municators use communication,
writing, editing, design, organiza
tional, and interpersonal skills; and
must demonstrate interest in future
trends, being a team player, promot
ing ideas, and dealing with ambigui
ty*
Education & Preparation
Individuals with BA or BS
degrees work as marketing assis
tants, sales management trainees,
marketing specialists, marketing
coordinator, etc. Companies often
are seeking applicants for marketing
positions who have a combination of
interpersonal and analytical skills. A
liberal arts major balanced with
some quantitative coursework

(especially computer-related) is
often valued by employers.
For marketing research-type
positions, students may find course
work in psychology and statistics
helpful. Engineering students may
be interested in marketing posi
tions with high-tech engineering
firms. The position often chosen is
within the area of product or tech
nical support, which provides the
individual witli an opportunity to
interface with other engineers, sales
staff, and the customer. Industrial
engineers who have an interest in
marketing typically begin in manu
facturing operations positions
before moving into marketing. Iliis
enables them to learn about the
company and company's product in
depth before attempting to market
to customers.

An MBA and/or at least five
years experience is often required to
move into some areas of product
management. Some recent gradu
ates arc eligible for positions similar
to these if their work history and/or
academic projects include an intern-
in which they have displayed
the skills necessary to manage the
marketing of a product.

ty, persistence, ability to follow orders well
and quickly, and to ask as few unnecessary

pany, product, personality, organization or

sional is responsible for creating and maintain
ing the image its client wishes to project. It is a
serious profession where dedication, experi
ence and education are essential. Today's PR
professional must be a strategic planner and
problem- solver with an ability to be creative,
perceptive and persuasive. People in this field

veys, and working with firms specializing in
and conducting opinion research.

reports, news releases, film scripts, articles,
executive speeches, product information and
employee publications.
•Knowledge of how the media works to
disseminate material to media sources. This

abilities. This includes addressing individuals
and groups and representing the corporation
at community and business functions.
•Knowledge of the techniques of art. lay
out. typography, photography and desktop
publishing.

have a BA or BS degree in
PR/Communications, Marketing, Advertising,
Economics, English Literature or Journalism.
However, there are increasing number of PR
professionals with Master's degrees in
Communications and Business Administration.
Familiarity with word processing, data base

applications and the Internet are important due
to high-tech, hot growth industries, and the
high demand for services. Internships in the
field are highly recommended.

Marketing
According to the American Marketing
Association (AMA), marketing is "the
process of planning and executing the concep
tion, pricing, promotion, and distribution of
ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges
that satisfy individual and organizational
goals."
The field of marketing can be broken down
into the areas of product development, prod
uct marketing, brand management, marketing
research, internet marketing, product support,
strategic planning, advertising, public rela
tions, promotions, corporate communication,
physical distribution, sales, and retailing. The
consumer goods, high-tech, and manufactur
ing industries hire marketing staff to serve in
many of these functional areas.
Consumer Products Marketing: This
department is involved with planning, intro
ducing, and managing one or more products
throughout the product's existence. Individual
jobs include product planners, product mar
keting specialists, product planning managers,
and product marketing engineers.
Product Development: Typically this takes
place at the corporate level, where strategic
planners and upper-level management assess
marketplace trends and business goals. Their
decisions are based on customer require
ments; designers' and service originators'
requirements; research and development
needs; sales staff requests.
Marketing Research: Marketing research
analysts study market trends and analyze data
to help marketing managers make decisions
about new and existing products and services.
Market researchers may work for the market
ing research department of a company, a mar
keting research firm or as an independent con
sultant.
Marketing Communications (marcom):
According to the AMA, the marketing com
munications staff "inform, persuade, and
remind various audiences about an organiza
tion's products or services." Advertising may
be conducted through brochures, direct mail,
trade journals, professional publications, mag
azines, and the internet. Sales promotion can
take place at trade shows and exhibits.
Internet Marketing: Internet marketing
topics include advertising on the World Wide
Web, Web business models, Web marketing
planning, legal aspects of electronic market
ing, and electronic commerce and security.
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
Marketing work is done in teams, with the
exception of market researchers who some
times work alone analyzing data. Marketing
communicators are required to interview staff
members and customers in order to promote a
product. In most marketing positions, individ
uals must work their way up in the organiza-
tion by starting in an entry-level
capacity as a marketing assistant.
Marketing staff typically have
regular work hours, although
depending on the industry, it is not
unusual to work late on reports
and meet with other team mem
bers. Marketing staff can be called
on to travel as part of their job.
People in marketing spend much
of the day contacting and meeting
others; therefore, those who enjoy
meeting new people of diverse
backgrounds should find the work
stimulating.
Skills
Consumer products marketers
use communication, interpersonal,
and sales skills; and must demon
strate interest in competition, ere

ativity, enthusiasm, strength of con
viction, empathy, and assertiveness.
Product developers use creative,
research, conceptual, and design
skills; and must demonstrate interest
in future trends, thinking globally,
and be a team player. Product mar
keters use management, leadership,
creative, forecasting, planning, and
communication skills; and must
demonstrate interest in future
trends and promotions, be product
oriented and able to deal with ambi
guity.
Marketing researchers use
research, analytic, writing, commu
nication, and quantitative skills; and
must demonstrate interest in con
ducting surveys and interviews,
gathering data, using statistical
applications, compiling summaries,
being a team player, working inde

pendently. and presenting results in
a concise manner. Marketing com
municators use communication,
writing, editing, design, organiza
tional, and interpersonal skills; and
must demonstrate interest in future
trends, being a team player, promot
ing ideas, and dealing with ambigui
ty*
Education & Preparation
Individuals with BA or BS
degrees work as marketing assis
tants, sales management trainees,
marketing specialists, marketing
coordinator, etc. Companies often
are seeking applicants for marketing
positions who have a combination of
interpersonal and analytical skills. A
liberal arts major balanced with
some quantitative coursework

(especially computer-related) is
often valued by employers.
For marketing research-type
positions, students may find course
work in psychology and statistics
helpful. Engineering students may
be interested in marketing posi
tions with high-tech engineering
firms. The position often chosen is
within the area of product or tech
nical support, which provides the
individual witli an opportunity to
interface with other engineers, sales
staff, and the customer. Industrial
engineers who have an interest in
marketing typically begin in manu
facturing operations positions
before moving into marketing. Iliis
enables them to learn about the
company and company's product in
depth before attempting to market
to customers.

An MBA and/or at least five
years experience is often required to
move into some areas of product
management. Some recent gradu
ates arc eligible for positions similar
to these if their work history and/or
academic projects include an intern-
in which they have displayed
the skills necessary to manage the
marketing of a product.

Advertising
Most jobs in the advertising profession are
found in the more than ten thousand advertis
ing agencies that create and place advertising
of every type in thousands of media sources.
The remaining jobs are on the client side,
either working with the agencies, or in an in
house advertising capacity.
Agencies handle the marketing process
from even before the pitch until after the ad
has been placed. Everything from coming up
with a product concept to negotiating valuable
placement of ads. Because of the broad nature
of the business, there is a great deal of variety
as well as requirements. Though much of what
you will learn on the job is industry specific,
general understanding of business and a basic
ability to manage (projects as well as people)
are essential.
In all agencies the jobs usually fall into five
categories: account management, creative
department, media, market research and sup
port services. Entry level positions in the five
areas are as follows:
•Account Management Assistant Account
Executive
'Creative Department Junior Writer,
Assistant Copywriter or Copy Trainee, Asst.
•Art Director, Art Asst. or Web Designer
•Media Assistant Media Planner, Assistant
Media Buyer
• Market Research Research Assistant,
Research Trainee
•Support Services accounting, personnel, cler
ical and office services
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
The environment of a large advertising
agency is extremely demanding, hectic, fast
paced, and competitive. Twelve-hour days are
more the norm than the exception and week
end work is not uncommon. Advertising is
hierarchical, so expect to do grunt work as an
entry level anything, and to be the first volun
teered to stay late. Once you have paid your
dues, you can be an Account Executive or a
Copywriter, or a Media Buyer. If you are on
the creative side, you will be pressed for ideas
on what is popular with particular target mar
kets. Keeping in touch with the latest trends,
fads, etc. is a must. If you are on the account
side, your job is more to service the client -
make sure their needs are met, provide
research for potential pitches, perhaps study
prior campaign launches, etc. On the media
side, you will be contacting program directors
for radio and TV, arranging for air time. For
print campaigns, you'll negotiate placement in
magazines, newspapers and websites.
Although many cities have active advertis

ing communities. New York City is still the
hub of the advertising industry. Chicago, San
Francisco and Los Angeles also house adver
tising agencies.
Skills
To enjoy work in advertising, having LOTS
of energy, patience and creativity is a tremen

Marketing
According to the American Marketing
Association (AMA), marketing is "the
process of planning and executing the concep
tion, pricing, promotion, and distribution of
ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges
that satisfy individual and organizational
goals."
The field of marketing can be broken down
into the areas of product development, prod
uct marketing, brand management, marketing
research, internet marketing, product support,
strategic planning, advertising, public rela
tions, promotions, corporate communication,
physical distribution, sales, and retailing. The
consumer goods, high-tech, and manufactur
ing industries hire marketing staff to serve in
many of these functional areas.
Consumer Products Marketing: This
department is involved with planning, intro
ducing, and managing one or more products
throughout the product's existence. Individual
jobs include product planners, product mar
keting specialists, product planning managers,
and product marketing engineers.
Product Development: Typically this takes
place at the corporate level, where strategic
planners and upper-level management assess
marketplace trends and business goals. Their
decisions are based on customer require
ments; designers' and service originators'
requirements; research and development
needs; sales staff requests.
Marketing Research: Marketing research
analysts study market trends and analyze data
to help marketing managers make decisions
about new and existing products and services.
Market researchers may work for the market
ing research department of a company, a mar
keting research firm or as an independent con
sultant.
Marketing Communications (marcom):
According to the AMA, the marketing com
munications staff "inform, persuade, and
remind various audiences about an organiza
tion's products or services." Advertising may
be conducted through brochures, direct mail,
trade journals, professional publications, mag
azines, and the internet. Sales promotion can
take place at trade shows and exhibits.
Internet Marketing: Internet marketing
topics include advertising on the World Wide
Web, Web business models, Web marketing
planning, legal aspects of electronic market
ing, and electronic commerce and security.
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
Marketing work is done in teams, with the
exception of market researchers who some
times work alone analyzing data. Marketing
communicators are required to interview staff
members and customers in order to promote a
product. In most marketing positions, individ
uals must work their way up in the organiza-
tion by starting in an entry-level
capacity as a marketing assistant.
Marketing staff typically have
regular work hours, although
depending on the industry, it is not
unusual to work late on reports
and meet with other team mem
bers. Marketing staff can be called
on to travel as part of their job.
People in marketing spend much
of the day contacting and meeting
others; therefore, those who enjoy
meeting new people of diverse
backgrounds should find the work
stimulating.
Skills
Consumer products marketers
use communication, interpersonal,
and sales skills; and must demon
strate interest in competition, ere

ativity, enthusiasm, strength of con
viction, empathy, and assertiveness.
Product developers use creative,
research, conceptual, and design
skills; and must demonstrate interest
in future trends, thinking globally,
and be a team player. Product mar
keters use management, leadership,
creative, forecasting, planning, and
communication skills; and must
demonstrate interest in future
trends and promotions, be product
oriented and able to deal with ambi
guity.
Marketing researchers use
research, analytic, writing, commu
nication, and quantitative skills; and
must demonstrate interest in con
ducting surveys and interviews,
gathering data, using statistical
applications, compiling summaries,
being a team player, working inde

pendently. and presenting results in
a concise manner. Marketing com
municators use communication,
writing, editing, design, organiza
tional, and interpersonal skills; and
must demonstrate interest in future
trends, being a team player, promot
ing ideas, and dealing with ambigui
ty*
Education & Preparation
Individuals with BA or BS
degrees work as marketing assis
tants, sales management trainees,
marketing specialists, marketing
coordinator, etc. Companies often
are seeking applicants for marketing
positions who have a combination of
interpersonal and analytical skills. A
liberal arts major balanced with
some quantitative coursework

(especially computer-related) is
often valued by employers.
For marketing research-type
positions, students may find course
work in psychology and statistics
helpful. Engineering students may
be interested in marketing posi
tions with high-tech engineering
firms. The position often chosen is
within the area of product or tech
nical support, which provides the
individual witli an opportunity to
interface with other engineers, sales
staff, and the customer. Industrial
engineers who have an interest in
marketing typically begin in manu
facturing operations positions
before moving into marketing. Iliis
enables them to learn about the
company and company's product in
depth before attempting to market
to customers.

An MBA and/or at least five
years experience is often required to
move into some areas of product
management. Some recent gradu
ates arc eligible for positions similar
to these if their work history and/or
academic projects include an intern-
in which they have displayed
the skills necessary to manage the
marketing of a product.

Advertising
Most jobs in the advertising profession are
found in the more than ten thousand advertis
ing agencies that create and place advertising
of every type in thousands of media sources.
The remaining jobs are on the client side,
either working with the agencies, or in an in
house advertising capacity.
Agencies handle the marketing process
from even before the pitch until after the ad
has been placed. Everything from coming up
with a product concept to negotiating valuable
placement of ads. Because of the broad nature
of the business, there is a great deal of variety
as well as requirements. Though much of what
you will learn on the job is industry specific,
general understanding of business and a basic
ability to manage (projects as well as people)
are essential.
In all agencies the jobs usually fall into five
categories: account management, creative
department, media, market research and sup
port services. Entry level positions in the five
areas are as follows:
•Account Management Assistant Account
Executive
'Creative Department Junior Writer,
Assistant Copywriter or Copy Trainee, Asst.
•Art Director, Art Asst. or Web Designer
•Media Assistant Media Planner, Assistant
Media Buyer
• Market Research Research Assistant,
Research Trainee
•Support Services accounting, personnel, cler
ical and office services
Nature of Work & Lifestyle
The environment of a large advertising
agency is extremely demanding, hectic, fast
paced, and competitive. Twelve-hour days are
more the norm than the exception and week
end work is not uncommon. Advertising is
hierarchical, so expect to do grunt work as an
entry level anything, and to be the first volun
teered to stay late. Once you have paid your
dues, you can be an Account Executive or a
Copywriter, or a Media Buyer. If you are on
the creative side, you will be pressed for ideas
on what is popular with particular target mar
kets. Keeping in touch with the latest trends,
fads, etc. is a must. If you are on the account
side, your job is more to service the client -
make sure their needs are met, provide
research for potential pitches, perhaps study
prior campaign launches, etc. On the media
side, you will be contacting program directors
for radio and TV, arranging for air time. For
print campaigns, you'll negotiate placement in
magazines, newspapers and websites.
Although many cities have active advertis

ing communities. New York City is still the
hub of the advertising industry. Chicago, San
Francisco and Los Angeles also house adver
tising agencies.
Skills
To enjoy work in advertising, having LOTS
of energy, patience and creativity is a tremen
dous plus. You have to love the manic, the
highly fashionable, and the opinionated.
There is variety in this line of work because
each client is unique, and has to be serviced
differently.
Skills to have include on-the-spot creativi
ty, persistence, ability to follow orders well
and quickly, and to ask as few unnecessary
questions as possible. Web-based technical
skills are also important. Advertising is com
petitive and artistic, and there are lots of peo
ple who would do your job for half your mea
ger pay (while living with parents, of course),
so it is important to do your job well. There
are no excuses for a job poorly done because
you can be easily replaced. So pay close atten
tion to detail, follow through on all pending
projects, negotiate with clients (usually about
extending a deadline).
Education & Preparation
BA or BS, preferably in Communication,
English, Journalism, Business, Economics,
Advertising, or Graphic Art.
Internships: the only way to get ahead in
advertising right from the beginning is to
intern at advertising agencies in different
capacities. If you can get a couple summers
experience in, you will be much more desir
able as an entry-level candidate than someone
without that experience, since so much of the
work done is on-the-job training. Having that
exposure to procedure and lingo will definite
ly help you.
