# Building on the first job
## 
### Karen Martell 
Stanford is a fast paced, challenging envi
ronment that presents endless opportuni
ties. There's no reason your professional
environment should be any different. Now
that I've started my post-Stanford life, 1
have a perspective you might find useful.
I graduated in 2005 with BA in
International Relations and an MA in
Communications. During school, I worked
for a nonprofit, the government, and for an
NGO. I am now an Account Director for
SNP Communications. We provide Fortune
500 companies like Google, Microsoft,
Cisco. Oracle and Yahoo with consulting,
training, and executive communications ser
vices.
Exposure
When pursuing a career, the first thing

you should think about is exposure. College
is specific and tocused - major, minor, the
sis, etc. Your first job out of college should
n't be. I wouldn't recommend you be over
ly attached to a specific industry or position.
Instead, think of the exposure you will have
to leaders, organizations, and business mod
els. The more you're exposed to, the better
prepared you will be to narrow your focus in
the future.
Skills
Before pursuing any job, think of the
skills you would like to develop. Some of
the most valuable skills I would highlight
are:
• Oral and Written Communication Skills -
Everyone at Stanford thinks they can write.
But there's a difference between writing an
A+ research paper and delivering concise,

compelling content that motivates others to
action. To he able to tailor content to spe
cific audiences, use dialogue skills to uncov
er hidden motivators, and command a room
is essential.
• Leadership - At Stanford, you may have
led student body groups, now translate it to
business. Whether you're directing cross
functional teams, managing internal groups,
or building the trust of your customers, lead
ership matters. Being solution oriented and
acting with a sense of urgency will differen
tiate you from the crowd.
Learning Style
Lastly, think of your learning style. Are
you looking for hands on management and
formal training or do you prefer to learn
through observation and experimentation?
In college, I learned as much through

internships and exchange programs as I did
in tny classes. Now 1 learn from my peers
and thought leaders 1 work with every day.
Each project 1 tackle is like a new case study.
Each organization I work with presents
another model to analyze. It works for me,
not for others. Know what works for you.
Also think about whether you want a big
or a small company. In smaller companies,
you assume a variety of roles and responsi
bilities and quickly realize the importance of
accountability and ownership. At the same
time, big companies can present more
opportunity or resume recognition. But you
may risk getting lost or just plain frustrated
by corporate bureaucracies. I've found a
balance between the two. I work for a small
firm but serve Fortune 500 companies.
Again, it's what works for me.
Congratulations for making it through
Stanford. Enjoy this next step into the
world of work. You'll love it.
