# Working in corporate America: Sink or swim? Part 1
## 
### Chaz Kyser 
The term "corporate America"
means different things to different
people. To some individuals corpo
rate America creates thoughts of
multinational corporations housed in
sky-high buildings with more employ
ees than can be counted. Others
define corporate America by the
environment it often fosters: compet
itive, impersonal and mercenary.
Nevertheless, working for big
businesses can provide more money,

more prestige, and more opportuni
ties to have a greater effect in one's
chosen industry than working for
smaller and less recognized compa
nies. However, despite the positives,
there are still aspects of working in
corporate America that people find
disheartening. The following are
issues people tend to have while
working in a corporate environment.
Issue 1 —It's Too Competitive
Everyone is trying to climb the

corporate ladder at the same time,
and some people will pull you down
to beat you to the top. This can cre
ate excess stress among employees
who feel like they always have to be
ahead of the next person. It's diffi
cult to have camaraderie among
employees in an environment that's
so divisive.
Issue 2—lt Can Be Grueling
Don't expect to work 9-5 every
day in corporate America. You'll be

lucky if you don't take work home.
Projects come first, not drinks after
work, exercise or beauty rest. The
long hours can interfere with peo
ple's family and social lives.
Issue 3—lt's Unstable
Because corporate America is so
money driven, owners always do
what they must to cut costs or make
a profit. This can equate to thou
sands of layoffs at a time in large cor
porations. It's difficult to work well

and enjoy your work when everyone
knows you may not have a job unless
so much money is earned in a certain
quarter, or your company is about to
be bought out, again.
Issue 4 —It Doesn't Embrace
Cultural Differences
Because corporate America is
largely controlled by white males,
they often define what is acceptable
regarding everything from speech,
to dress, to hair styles. For African-
Americans and other minorities this
can be very frustrating, as they may
feel they have to "hide" a part of
themselves to fit into the dominant
white culture.

America: Sink or Swim?" will dis
cuss how to succeed in a corporate
environment.
