## Int'l student aid lags 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
With an admissions rate that dipped
below 11 percent for the first time ever last
year. Stanford ranked among the most
competitive schools in the country. Yet for
about 35 members of the Class of 2010, the
test for admission was even more rigorous;
according to University officials, the ad
missions rate for international students re
questing financial aid was three percent.
Hie low number of foreign students on
financial aid reflects the University's in
ability to extend its need-blind admissions
program — which all American appli
cants enjoy — to the international com
munity
The University recently announced ex
pansions to financial aid packages for mid

die-income domestic families. Similar
changes in the financial aid system for in
ternational students, however, have not
yet been made, nor are they planned for
the near future.
"The admissions pool for needy inter
national students is extremely competi
tive," said Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper. "Some of the students that we
deny in this pool are more talented than
some of those we accept who do not re
quest financial aid."
Because Stanford does not offer them
need-blind admissions, international stu
dents must declare in their application for
admission whether they are seeking aid.

rate admissions pool from internation
al students not requesting aid.
More than 1.000 international ap
plicants applied for aid last year, ac
cording to Cooper — 35 were admit
ted.
While more than six percent of the
undergraduate student body consists
of international students, only one
fourth of these students receive finan
cial aid. According to President John
1 lennessy. the inability to offer need
blind admissions to international stu
dents stems from a lack of funding.
"Much of the funding designated
for international students comes from
outside of the United States." Hen
nessy said."And that pool is a lot small
er in comparison to the alumni pool
domestically."
To offer need-blind admissions for
international students, 1 lennessy esti
mated. the University would have to
spend at least an additional $10 million
each year — an increase that would
require a $2(X) million bump in Stan
ford's endowment. Currently, Hen
nessy suggested, Stanford's endow

ment per student ratio is insufficient to
fund need-blind admissions, which
Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all
able to do.
"Our peer institutions are able to
offer need-blind financial aid because
of the total size of their endowment
compared to their student body." 1 len
nessy said. "Harvard has a student
body that's slightly larger than ours,
but it has an endowment roughly twice
ours. Princeton has an endowment five
percent smaller than us. but a student
population that is half in size. The en
dowment per student is significantly
lower at Stanford than at Harvard.
Yale and Princeton."
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Af
fairs John Bravman '79 attributed
Stanford's inability to offer need-blind
admissions to donors' general unwill
ingness to give large gifts to the pro
gram. While the University has re
ceived some substantial gilts for finan
cial aid — most recently, a $10 million
gift for Latin-American students in
honor of Alejandro and Lida Zaffa
roni in March 2006 — donors typically
do not designate their contributions to
financial aid for international students.
"It's going to be a real challenge to
get to need-blind admissions if people
are unwilling to make gifts designated
to that cause." Bravman said. "We're

about 40 percent endowed for finan
cial aid. We have to raise the rest of the
costs from the University's own budg
et."
And while international graduate
students are often able to apply for re
search grants or government fellow
ships to fund their educational expens
es if they are denied financial aid by
specific departments, undergraduates
lack such alternatives. Without work
visas, international students are pro
hibited from participating in work
study programs on campus, which re
quires that the University provide in
creased financial aid for each interna
tional student admitted.
Hennessy said that while American
students seeking financial aid ranged
across the socioeconomic spectrum,
many of the international students re
questing aid found Stanford's tuition
and room and board costs to be
greater than their family's annual in
come.
The president also told The Daily
that the costs for need-blind admis
sions may be far greater than the Uni
versity has calculated. It is possible, he
said, that more students needing aid
will apply to the University than cur
rently do if significant changes are
made to the financial aid program.
"In terms of being need-blind for

international students, we're still a
long way off." Hennessy said. "When 1
set that goal in 2005, we were on a 10-
year horizon. 1 was hoping we could
finish it sooner than that, but that's
going to depend a lot on fundraising."
Pakistani-born Fahad Mahmood
TO, who receives financial aid. de
scribed the application process as
"very competitive" and acknowledged
that many of his friends did not apply
to Stanford because they could not af
ford to do so.
"In my year. I noticed a few of my
friends went to Harvard and MIT over
Stanford because of those schools' fi
nancial aid packages," Mahmood said.
"I personally feel that if you choose
students on what their [financial] con
tribution can be. instead of choosing
on their merit, then you lose out on a
lot of talent."
Mahmood said that offering inter
national students financial aid would
diversify Stanford socioeconomically
and would enhance the University's
ability to fundraise in the future.
"1 personally will contribute to the
University 10 or 20 years from now."
he said, "because Stanford has
changed my life considerably."

for international students comes from
outside of the United States." Hen
nessy said."And that pool is a lot small
er in comparison to the alumni pool
domestically."
To offer need-blind admissions for
international students, 1 lennessy esti
mated. the University would have to
spend at least an additional $10 million
each year — an increase that would
require a $2(X) million bump in Stan
ford's endowment. Currently, Hen
nessy suggested, Stanford's endow

ment per student ratio is insufficient to
fund need-blind admissions, which
Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all
able to do.
"Our peer institutions are able to
offer need-blind financial aid because
of the total size of their endowment
compared to their student body." 1 len
nessy said. "Harvard has a student
body that's slightly larger than ours,
but it has an endowment roughly twice
ours. Princeton has an endowment five
percent smaller than us. but a student
population that is half in size. The en
dowment per student is significantly
lower at Stanford than at Harvard.
Yale and Princeton."
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Af
fairs John Bravman '79 attributed
Stanford's inability to offer need-blind
admissions to donors' general unwill
ingness to give large gifts to the pro
gram. While the University has re
ceived some substantial gilts for finan
cial aid — most recently, a $10 million
gift for Latin-American students in
honor of Alejandro and Lida Zaffa
roni in March 2006 — donors typically
do not designate their contributions to
financial aid for international students.
"It's going to be a real challenge to
get to need-blind admissions if people
are unwilling to make gifts designated
to that cause." Bravman said. "We're

about 40 percent endowed for finan
cial aid. We have to raise the rest of the
costs from the University's own budg
et."
And while international graduate
students are often able to apply for re
search grants or government fellow
ships to fund their educational expens
es if they are denied financial aid by
specific departments, undergraduates
lack such alternatives. Without work
visas, international students are pro
hibited from participating in work
study programs on campus, which re
quires that the University provide in
creased financial aid for each interna
tional student admitted.
Hennessy said that while American
students seeking financial aid ranged
across the socioeconomic spectrum,
many of the international students re
questing aid found Stanford's tuition
and room and board costs to be
greater than their family's annual in
come.
The president also told The Daily
that the costs for need-blind admis
sions may be far greater than the Uni
versity has calculated. It is possible, he
said, that more students needing aid
will apply to the University than cur
rently do if significant changes are
made to the financial aid program.
"In terms of being need-blind for

international students, we're still a
long way off." Hennessy said. "When 1
set that goal in 2005, we were on a 10-
year horizon. 1 was hoping we could
finish it sooner than that, but that's
going to depend a lot on fundraising."
Pakistani-born Fahad Mahmood
TO, who receives financial aid. de
scribed the application process as
"very competitive" and acknowledged
that many of his friends did not apply
to Stanford because they could not af
ford to do so.
"In my year. I noticed a few of my
friends went to Harvard and MIT over
Stanford because of those schools' fi
nancial aid packages," Mahmood said.
"I personally feel that if you choose
students on what their [financial] con
tribution can be. instead of choosing
on their merit, then you lose out on a
lot of talent."
Mahmood said that offering inter
national students financial aid would
diversify Stanford socioeconomically
and would enhance the University's
ability to fundraise in the future.
"1 personally will contribute to the
University 10 or 20 years from now."
he said, "because Stanford has
changed my life considerably."
