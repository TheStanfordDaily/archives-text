## Roosevelt localizes policy Think tank experiences growing pains, policy gains 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 3 a.m.on Election Night 2004, a de
jected Kai Stinclicombe fired off an
email to the Stanford Democrats mailing
list. In the message, Stinchcombe. then a
doctoral student in political science and
Stanford Democrats president, suggest
ed a new. bipartisan approach to molding
public policy in light of that night's Re
publican victory.
He proposed creating a student-run
think tank and. in a lighthearted jab at
the University's Hoover Institution, of
fered to name it after Hoover's progres
sive-minded successor.
More than two and a half years have

passed since that fateful email, and the
Roosevelt Institution is now a national
think-tank with over fifty chapters at
campuses across the country. But with
the center of attention shifting to nation
wide growth, interest in the flagship
Stanford chapter has waned, and the or
ganization has refocused its goals in an
effort to produce more tangible results.
"Unfortunately because of political
cycles you can't expect people to be pas
sionate all the time" said Hric Mitzen
macher '08, president of Roosevelt's
Stanford chapter. "Especially when it's
midterm season or finals."
At a February 2(M)5 rally called "A
Rendezvous with Destiny," over 4(X) stu
dents crammed into Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge for Roosevelt's official
kickoff — a celebration of the power of
student ideas, topped off with much Row-
erPoint and pizzazz.
The concept of a student-run
think tank, rescuing ideas from class
room discussions and delivering
them to the desks of legislators,
seemed to resonate among the cam
pus populace.
But Roosevelt was not immune to
the attrition that tolls on every stu
dent group, and when the organiza
tion quickly outgrew its initial frame
work. momentum stalled.
Some students, frustrated by a
lack of progress in policy making,
searched for another way to make a
difference. Others, inundated by the
constant demands of classes and so
cial obligations, simply did not have
enough time to conduct policy re
search.
Vilas Rao'o7. a former communi
cations director for the organization,
said he moved on after studying
overseas and admitted he wanted to
spend more time with friends. Oth
ers, like Devon Swezey '08. a former
director of the Center on Clean Poli
tics and Voting Rights,said it was dif
ficult to devote significant time to
the group when immediate results
failed to materialize.
"They have gotten a lot of stuff
done, but it's often been a verv slow
process and sometimes you wonder
what you are doing it for, and how it
is affecting anything," Swezey said." I
think that the major draw initially
was that it was more than a club on
campus. It was something where you
could actually effect chance with

your fellow students."
GROWING PAINS
Roosevelt s initial success caught
some ot its founders by surprise.
"We very deliberately did not
want to become a national chapter
organization." Stinehcombe said.
"We also didn't know if it was going
to work. What we decided was,
"We'll give it a try.'"
Nonetheless, the organization
soon found itsell bursting at the
seams. After co-launching at Yale
and Stanford, chapters sprang up
throughout the Ivy League and
many larger public schools like UC-
Davis and UC-Berkeley. Several of
the original organizers, including
Stinchcombe and current Roosevelt
President Ouinn Wilhelmi.a former
Stanford undergraduate student,
moved on to become national lead
ers of the group, leaving the Stan
ford chapter without some of its
strongest legs.
"Had we stayed here there
would have been more people
working on the Stanford effort."
Stinchcombe mused, before adding:
"I think the chapter is still very
strong."
As one of the founding chapters,
Stanford was the guinea pig for
Roosevelt's policy making efforts.
Combined with what Mitzenmacher
called the "experience drain" to
Roosevelt's national front, the
chapter reinvented itself several
times in its early months to experi
ment with different means for turn
ing ideas into policy.
"We really grew too quickly to
support ourselves," Mitzenmacher
said. "We're just ambitious, but
we've been very luckv. We've hit a

lot of roadblocks but are very
young."
The organization initially fo
cused its efforts on producing 20-
page policy papers for its journal.
Ilie Roosevelt Review, a hefty task
for any student already busy with
coursework and other extracurricu
lars.
Mitzenmacher admitted that the
process seemed "intimidating," and
said the organization has refash
ioned itself by taking "more incre
mental steps toward a solution."
"It's a lot easier for students to
get involved now." he said.
GOING LOCAL, NATIONALLY
Although it was founded without
national aspirations, the organiza
tion still had an eye on influencing
federal policy. But Roosevelt's lead
ers soon realized that the manpow
er and expertise of the Washington
heavyweights and professional
think tanks proved formidable.
"The saying is that 'all politics
are local,' and 1 think to a certain ex
tent that's true," said Spencer Sher
man. a Yale graduate and co-presi
dent of Roosevelt's chapter there.
Roosevelt's leaders are quick to
cite the Yale chapter as a shining ex
ample of the organization's re
tooled focus on state and local poli
tics. Last spring, the chapter pro
duced an economic analysis for the
New Haven city government on a
proposed change to the city's living
wage ordinance. And earlier this
month the group helped push a plan
to change Connecticut's Earned In
come lax Credit through two com
mittees in the state legislature.
Despite the much larger hurdles
in dealing with the California State

Legislature, Stinchcombe said he
considers the state's progressive
politics an easy match for Roosevelt
policy proposals. And while Wash
ington is filled with think tanks, an
alysts and consulting firms, Roo
sevelt can fill a need at the lower
levels of government.
"There's a hunger for that sort of
information at the state and local
level," he said. "1 would say proba
bly not at the federal level, but 1
would be happy if I was proven
wrong."
With chapters nationwide, how
ever. Roosevelt can coordinate
grass roots initiatives in multiple lo
cales, effectively fostering national
policy while still maintaining a local
focus.
"It's a national organization, but
really local in nature," said Kyle
Atwell, former head of the DC-
Davis chapter and current Western
regional chair. " Iliere's a huge gap
when it comes to local policies and
local issues. No one's really doing
the research there."
PROGRESSIVE PROGRESS
Along with its focus on local poli
cy, Roosevelt has also narrowed
down its energies to three primary
initiatives, dubbed the first annual
Roosevelt Challenges: clean energy,
access to higher education and work
ing families. The idea, organizers
said, was to aim for more incremen
tal. but tangible, results.
"It's really easy to want to take on
everything," Atwell said. "The fact of
the matter is Roosevelt went for a
year and a half with only a couple
major projects. But now every pro
gram is tailored to these issues, and 1
think that's what makes us able to

come up with concrete results."
Mitzenmacher said the Stanford
chapter would also likely pare down
its nine policy centers — the discus
sion groups that collaborate, analyze
and propose policy efforts.
"We really still want people who
want to write their dream policy," he
said of keeping as many policy cen
ters as possible,"but that's not a sus
tainable structure."
Roosevelt piggybacked on the re
cent Energy Crossroads conference,
hosting a policy conference tied in
with the institution's energy chal
lenge. A number of student presen
ters offered their policy proposals, a
sign that the narrow focus was pay
ing dividends for research and
progress.
Despite the institutional adjust
ments, the heart of the organization
— turning students' ideas into policy
has not changed.
"I would say that Stanford stu
dents spend too much time on poli
cy-relevant things not to make a dif
ference," Stinchcombe said. "The
point is not how well you know the
topic, the point is that you had a good
idea. If you have 6,000 college stu
dents, you can probably come up
with some relatively good ones."
And to that end, Roosevelt still
presents a unique opportunity for
college students looking to make a
difference.
"Last year 1 didn't know what my
major was." Sherman said."But 1 was
part of an organization that almost
got a multi-million dollar bill passed
through the state legislature. How
mam students can sav that?"
