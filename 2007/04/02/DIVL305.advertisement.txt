If so, you could be eligible to participate in a new research study investigating
how medications relieve chronic lower back pain.
The Stanford Neuroimaging and Pain Lab (SNAP!) is currently looking for men
with chronic low back pain to participate in a research study of the pain-relieving
medications. We are using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate how the
pain processing changes in response to 2 different medication conditions.
MRI is safe, non-invasive, and does not use X-rays or radiation.
Participants earn up to $500.
Participants must be:
• Men
• Age 18-60
• Currently have low back pain
