## Panda Bear's "Person Pitch:" warped joy 
### SCOTT COOMES KZSU CONTRIBUTING REVIEW 
John Vanderslice once said, "Distortion...
equals sex and violence, and if you don't have
sex and violence in rock n' roll, then you're to
tally done for." Panda Bear's (Noah Lennox of
Animal Collective) second full-length album.
"Person Pitch," is one of the most distorted pop
records to come out this year, with every vocal
line swollen with reverb, ominous whale song
noises roaring in the background and melodies
that you wish would never stop echoing.
However, the brand of hedonism that
Panda Bear sells with such sonic manipula
tions is, well, bereft of any sex or violence.
Like Animal Collective, the music offers a vis
ceral innocence of a sound somewhere be
tween the Beach Boys and heavily processed
campfire sing-alongs. Lennox, however,
abandons the raw and primitive trappings of
most of AC's catalogue, opting for a sound
closer to the sparkly "Bat. You'll Fly," rather
than the giddy warfare of "Hollinndagain."
The distortion of "Person Pitch" isn't an act of
violence against the listener or the songs:
rather, the warped sound forms the core of a
series of excellent pop songs that are fun to
hear without the risk of losing your soul.
These are not "clean" songs distorted for
the sake of experimentation (or "sex and vio
lence"). like those on the recent Clap Your
Hands Say Yeah release. The quiet and muf
fled chanting vocals in the mix of "Comfy in
Nautica" is not meant to intimate some sort of
distance between the listener and the
"essence" of the song; rather, the distance is as
much a part of the composition as the melody,
and any attempt to "cleanly" replicate this
song, or most others on "Person Pitch." would,
contrary to Mr. Vanderslice, commit violence
against the music.This album is an entirely dif
ferent beast than Panda Bear's debut, "Young
Prayer." and the minimalist campfire atmos
phere has largely been lost somewhere in its
reverb.
Handclaps and irregular strumming have
mostly been replaced by 10-fi world beats, ex
acting samples and distant vocal threads. At
the price of sacrificing the extreme intimacy
of his solo debut. Lennox has created a record
that smothers the listener with massive and
spacious noise. "Good Girl" exemplifies this
aesthetic chance, with the vocals smothered
beneath waves of their own echoes and elec-

Tronic samples, before transitioning into the
aggressive and off-balance rumble of the
piano loop in "Carrots."
This drastic departure actually shapes the
fundamental way that the album functions.
Rather than relying on the traditional ten
sion/release dynamics of most pop music,
Lennox crafts songs out of the mingling and
flow between uncertain and familiar textures.
At times, bits of '50s teenage pop and '60s psy
chedelia seem to arise like life preservers in the
experimental wash, creating a fresh nostalgia
that sweetly powers the whole affair. Although
the sound rarely strays from its pop sensibili
ties. the music perhaps would best be ap
proached more like ambient electronic music.
If you pay attention to stuff like the interaction
between instrumental layers, rather than wait
ing for songs to neatly develop and then polite
ly resolve themselves,"Person Pitch" becomes
a much more rewarding album.
lliis is not to say that the whole album is a
series of Panda Bear's experimental fancies
and random samples with a few crumbs of
melody thrown in to keep our attention. The
unapologetically happy "Bros" humbly towers
over the album as the centerpiece track, sur
viving at full speed for 12:30 without tiring.'sos
pop vocals, saturated in reverb, play freely on
top of a repetitive jangly instrumental bed for
most of the tune, just enough samples flutter
ing about to keep things interesting. The song
then gracefully shifts into an extended coda
reminiscent of Animal Collective's "Winter's
I .ove" with waves of liquid vocals riding on top
of the simple skeleton of two violently
strummed acoustic guitar chords. Samples of
hooting owls, crying babies, thunder and fire
works fill out the already burgeoning mix.
"Take Pills" unfolds in a similar, though
less epic. vein. Starting with pensive, albeit
sunny, harmonies that recall the Beach Boys,
the song then transforms into some sort of
poppy psychadelic parade march about not
taking anti-depressants."Good Girl/Carrots"
fulfills a similar sort of patter, as Lennox
morphs a furious bongo beat into a soulful
'50s teenage pop melody (with samples of
what sounds like someone munching carrots
forming part of the percussion).
The remainder of "Person Pitch" feels a bit
more subdued, with subtler transitions and
gentler sonic manipulations. ITie aforemen
tioned "Comfy in Nautica" starts the album
with slow handclaps and chanting, with

Lennox intoning some sort of anthem to inno
cent hedonism; requisite whale-song drones
join in the harmonies. "I'm Not." which was
originally released with "Comfy in Nautica "as
a single, locks into a slow.ethereal groove, with
a simple beat propelling the misty vocals.
The mysterious "Search For Delicious" re
sembles Animal Collective's "Must be a Tree
man" and the ambient "Baleen Sample." Elec
tronic seagull calls crackle underneath the
bizarrely manipulated vocals, perhaps serving
as an odd interlude between the smug, adoles
cent "Carrots" and the humble "Ponytail."
"Ponytail" brings the album to a sober and sat
isfied conclusion. While the unassuming final
track is a bit anticlimactic and disappointing
on its own. it fits as a neat final statement to
wrap up such a careening album.
Like much of "Person Pitch." "Ponytail"
and "I'm Not" might have trouble surviving
on their own as pop songs. These songs on
their own would risk getting lost in their own
distortion, and a few tracks, frankly, seem to
spread a little too thin after a few minutes;
within the context of the whole album, how
ever, every piece fits a somehow logical niche.
Listen to "Person Pitch" the whole way
through, preferably on headphones. Even if the
repetition and elusive level of the melodies
don't deliver instant gratification, the warm at
mosphere keeps the music pleasant enough for
repeated listens until the album makes sense.
This is a comfortable album to get immersed in,
and, if you don't find the bizarre samples and
distorted vocals alienating, an awesome sum
mer record at the same time. This is probably
the happiest "headphone record" you will find
anytime soon â€” music for withdrawing into
the deep, dark, sunny, smiling part of your psy
che that vou always feared vou had.
