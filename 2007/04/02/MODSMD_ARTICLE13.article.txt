### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION SPARTAN 
In the world of the new consoles, from the
expensive and over-hyped Play Station 3 to the
interactive and intuitive arts of the miniscule
Wii. it becomes harder and harder to find a rea
son to fire up your aging game box. With the re
lease of "God of War II." Play Station 2 owners
have a reason not only to plug back in. but also
the opportunity to enjoy one of the best gaming
experiences of the last few years.

journeys to the ends of the earth to do what no
man. god. or Titan has ever done before â€”

preventing Zeus's betrayal.The story features a
plethora of events, locations and characters
from Greek mythology, allowing you to meet
(and usually fight) everyone from the heroes
Perseus and Theseus to the fallen son Icarus
and the Titan Atlas. The rendered vistas are
nothing short of epic, and the in-game camera
acts more like a cinematographer in an action
movie than a fairy flying over your shoulder as
the camera zooms in and out and gives side an
gles and slow-mo shots during battles, puzzles
and travel.
The beauty of the original "God of War" was
that the game play was intuitive, simple and,
most importantly, absolutely captivating. Any
complaints about the first game came from
minor details and puzzles rather than major
game play components. In God of War 11, Sony
has improved on the game play in every possi
