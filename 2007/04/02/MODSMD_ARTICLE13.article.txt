# Plug your Play Station 2 back in for "God of War II"
## 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION SPARTAN 
In the world of the new consoles, from the
expensive and over-hyped Play Station 3 to the
interactive and intuitive arts of the miniscule
Wii. it becomes harder and harder to find a rea
son to fire up your aging game box. With the re
lease of "God of War II." Play Station 2 owners
have a reason not only to plug back in. but also
the opportunity to enjoy one of the best gaming
experiences of the last few years.
The sequel to 2005's highly lauded Game of
the Year, "God of War 11" once again casts you
as the bald and tattooed anti-hero. Kratos the
Spartan. The story picks up shortly after the
final events of the first game, with Kratos sitting
atop his throne on Olympus as the ancient
world's god of war. Seemingly causing too much
ruckus for his own good, the opening sequence
in the game sees Kratos betrayed, dethroned
and killed by Zeus in order to restore order to
Olympus and the world.
Kratos. however, is once again able to cheat
death and is brought back to fight Zeus with the
help of the angered and bitter Titans. (For those
not fresh on their Greek mythology, Zeus im
prisoned the Titans before becoming the ruler
of Olympus.) The game follows Kratos as he
journeys to the ends of the earth to do what no
man. god. or Titan has ever done before —
change his own fate by going back in time and
preventing Zeus's betrayal.The story features a
plethora of events, locations and characters
from Greek mythology, allowing you to meet
(and usually fight) everyone from the heroes
Perseus and Theseus to the fallen son Icarus
and the Titan Atlas. The rendered vistas are
nothing short of epic, and the in-game camera
acts more like a cinematographer in an action
movie than a fairy flying over your shoulder as
the camera zooms in and out and gives side an
gles and slow-mo shots during battles, puzzles
and travel.
The beauty of the original "God of War" was
that the game play was intuitive, simple and,
most importantly, absolutely captivating. Any
complaints about the first game came from
minor details and puzzles rather than major
game play components. In God of War 11, Sony
has improved on the game play in every possi
ble facet, reworking older elements to make
them more fun and simply eliminating what
caused too many headaches while also re
taining what made God of War great in the
first place. The only really prominent new
feature — where Kratos uses his weapons to
rappel himself over huge chasms or around
monstrous obstacles — allows for some ex
tremely cinematic sequences.
The linear game play of "God of War II"

alternates between mind-bending puzzles
and thumb-destroying fight sequences. The
puzzles are all intuitive and interesting, as
well as fairly easy to solve with a little thought
and sometimes a little trial-and-error.
In between puzzles are God of War's
trademark violent and action-packed bat
tles. Wielding two swords connected via
chains to his forearms, as well as powers be
stowed upon (or stolen from) various mytho
logical entities. Kratos runs into battle, and
the limbs start flying shortly thereafter. "God
of War II." much like its predecessor, is not
for the feint of heart. War is not about hugs
and ponies; nobody embodies that idea bet

tcr than a Spartan,and no Spartan is more vi
olent than Kratos. Blood flows like water,
and body parts scatter like leaves in a hurri
cane as Kratos pulls off gravity-defying acro
batics and the game's ever popular "fatali
ties" on weakened monsters.
From start to finish, God of War II is an
improvement on the original in every aspect
— combat, puzzles and graphics. And when
the "original" is a Game of the Year award
winner, this can only mean good things
across the board for you. the player. "God of
War II" is popularly considered the Play St
ation 2's last great hurrah, and. if that's true,
then it's one hell of a going away party.
