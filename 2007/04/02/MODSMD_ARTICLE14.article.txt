# Step up to The Counter for a new burger experience
## 
### MARY LIZ McCURDY INTERMISSION MODERNISE 
On California Ave., burgers meet the
21st century at The Counter. I hate to
break it to you, but even burgers have
become complex. Imagine the Peninsu
la Creamery's juicy burgers with Pluto's
personalized option chart. Options, op
tions. options. So what happens when
burgers become modernized?
Based on my initial expectations of
this burger restaurant. I naively expect
ed a casual "burger joint" with dim
lighting and middle-aged men drinking
beer. However, upon spotting the
avant-garde small sign outside the win
dow, my expectations began to change.
Walking in. I was certain I had en
tered the wrong restaurant.The chic bar
and two large flat screens further indicat
ed that The Counter is no average burg
er joint. This bright, modern restaurant
has a strange style, decorated relatively
barebones in order to create a clean and
tuturistic feel. Groups of skateboards
and graffiti paintings are neatly spaced
out on the walls, and modern punk music
quietly plays in the background. The
decor strives to be cool and hip. but the
skateboards seem kind of awkward.
The modern experience extends into
the menu. Each diner receives a clip

board to "Build Your Own Burger."
Sounds easy right? Well, there are over
312,120 different burger combinations
you could make, not including a plethora
of different types of fries, drinks, milk
shakes or desserts! Talk about decisions.
If you're as indecisive as I am. this menu
is tantalizing to say the least. Luckily, I
brought along friends with diverse ap
petites, so we were able to get a full read
on at least O.(XXX)I % of the menu.
Starting with the "Burger Type" sec
tion of the menu, all of them are deli
cious. The meat, be it turkey, beef or
chicken, was particularly lean and tasty.
ITiis was a nice surprise, considering the
high price ($7.95-$12.95). However, the
problem starts when choosing a patty
sizeâ€” 1/3 lb. 2/3 lb or a whole pound.
I low does"l am really hungry" translate
into pounds of meat? To be honest, 1 re
ally struggled picking a burger size be
cause I had no idea how large 1/3 of a
pound is; I did remember, though, that
the Quarter Pounder with cheese from
McDonald's leaves me feeling unsatis
fied (for a number of reasons). Naturally,
I decided to up the ante and go for the 2/3
pounder.This burger is huge! But. lucki
ly. delicious.The 1/3 is likely all you need.
2/3 is a challenge (for boys and very, very
hungry girls) and the one pounder would
probably kill you.

But the real struggle of dining at The
Counter is choosing the burger top
pings. Two different types of lettuce. 10
types of cheese. 27 toppings, 13 sauces
and three buns. And then there are the
specials.
On the bright side, at least there's
something here for everyone. Whether
you're trying to pack on the pounds or
attempting the South Beach Diet, The
Counter allows everyone to go home
happy. Get your burger on a salad bed
for a healthier meal or add a fried egg
and bacon on English muffin if you 're in
the mood for a breakfast burger (or
looking to raise your cholesterol).
Although it's overwhelming, don't
become so frazzled that you neglect your
"Build a Burger's" bill. It will easily in
crease as you up the size of your burger
(two to three extra dollars) or choose
some guacamole or bacon (one dollar
each). Partaking in the requisite "sweet"
fries will also set you back between
$3.50-$7.50. A gourmet burger, fries and
milkshake could easily add up to $20. so
choose wisely. However, portions are
huge, so think conservatively when or
dering.
Sometimes what's best about a
burger joint is getting a bacon cheese
burger with fries to hit the spot. While
The Counter offers options, be aware
that those options are not free by any
means. With that in mind,The Counter
is flavorful and definitely a special treat.
Move over Peninsula Creamery and
Plutos. At The Counter, the American
burger meets options like never before.
