# Three paths to sin: a Las Vegas visitor's guide
## 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION LOUNGE LIZARD 
Las Vegas, the city of sin. is a
perennial spring break favorite: it's
like Florida without the old peo
ple. Los Angeles without the chichi
dress code, Cancun without class.
And like a legal, unionized north
ern Nevada brothel prostitute,
there are several ways to do this va
cation right. The only difference is
what you're willing to spend.
If you're thinking about hitting
up LV on your next break.here are
three alternative Vegas vacation
schemes, scaled to accommodate
everyone from those of you with
engineering libraries named after
your parents all the way down to
those of us who are too po' to af
ford the other "o" and the "r."
Vacation 1: Off l)a Hook
Lodging: If money is not an
issue, enjoy your stay in the five
star Wynn Hotel & Resort, where
$599 a night gets you 640 square
feet, a panoramic view of the city
and a minibar with its own securi
ty alarm. Classy.
Food: If you need to nibble
something more substantial than
caviar and Dom, make your wav

to Picasso at the Bellagio. This
restaurant is filled with dozens of
original Picassos. making it one of
about five restaurants in Vegas
that doesn't cater to smokers.
Entertainment: After dinner,
burn off your 200-calorie haute
cuisine meal by dancing at the
TAO Nightclub in the Venetian.
The bouncers enforce a strict pret
ty-people-only policy, but, if you
have any trouble, just claim you're
with Paris I lilton.one of the club's
regulars. Although I personally
have never gotten in. judging by
the Facebook pictures of the two
people from high school I haven't
de-friended, this is the perfect
place to meet a bottle blonde bim
bette who is double-majoring in
Spanish and gold digging. At least
it will make you feel better about
not going to USC
Vacation 2: On Da Budget
Lodging: If you're saving your
cash to lose at the poker table, look
no further for an affordable room
than the Laughing Jackalope
Motel. Bar and Casino, right across
the street from the Mandalay Bay.
Rooms are as low as $30 during the
off-season and the bar serves the
biggest drinks in town/Think tum

biers full of Jager. Hoo-ah!
Food: Las Vegas natives would
kill me for giving away this secret,
but for an unbelievable lunch,
check out Capriotti's Sandwich
Shop, hands-down the best deli in
the Vegas valley area. Ilie shop's
specialty is "The Bobbie," a sub
packed with fresh-carved turkey,
cranberry sauce and stuffing â€”
just like Ilianksgiving at home,
without having to watch your
grandmother gum her way
through a spoonful of mashed po
tatoes. And its budget-friendly:
$13.00 will buy you a 24" (two
foot!) sandwich that easily serves
two starving students.
Entertainment: If you're in the
market for low-budget entertain
ment. look no further than the
Greek Isles Hotel & Casino, ar
guably the seediest venue off
(way off) the Strip. Here you can
take in a Rat Pack cover show,
enjoy the crooning of a cheesy
lounge singer or simply play the
penny slots while sucking down
free gin and tonics served up by
60-year-old cocktail waitresses in
satin hot pants. Warning: the
lounge singer will hit on vour date
