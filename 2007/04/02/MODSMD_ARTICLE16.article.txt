# Modest Mouse's ship hasn't sunk yet
## 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION MODESTMAN 
'ITie first Modest Mouse record I
ever heard was "Good News for Peo
ple Who Love Bad News" when 1
was in high school. My English
teacher walked into the room while
it was being played and asked what it
was. When he heard that it was Mod
est Mouse, he responded that he re
membered when Modest Mouse was
"less poppy." But his face betrayed
him: his look seemed to say, "And I
remember when they didn't suck."
Of course, "Good News for Peo
ple Who Love Bad News" was, and
still is, a very decent album. But. in
retrospect. Good News certainly
can't be compared to some of Mod
est Mouse's previous albums, such as
"The Lonesome Crowded West" or
"The Moon and Antarctica." I.ike

"Good News for People Who Love
Bad News." Modest Mouse's most
recent release, "We Were Dead Be
fore the Ship Even Sank," is a rela
tively solid album, but it's not nearly
as good as Modest Mouse's classic
releases.
The album starts off with the gen
tle accordion of "March Into the
Sea" and then explodes into lead
singer Isaac Brock's guitar and angry
shouting vocals. Combined with
drummer Jeremiah Green's sharp
percussion, this part of the song is the
angriest and harshest Modest Mouse
has been for a long time. But all at
once, the anger falls like a receding
tide, and the song changes into a gen
tle stream of melodic guitar and xy
lophone. with the rest of the track
continuing this alternation between
harsh and gentle.
In many ways, "March Into the

Sea" foreshadows the rest of the
album, which alternates between the
infectious pop of "Good News For
People Who Love Bad News" and
the angry, pessimistic rock of "The
Lonesome Crowded West." For
every raucous rock track, there's a
languishing, poppy song like "Dash
board," the album's second track and
one of its finest.
"Dashboard," which was released
two months before the album, works
well both as a single and as an inte
grated part of the record. Hie song
celebrates life, despite its crashes:
"The dashboard melted, but we still
have the radio... it would've been,
could've been worse than you would
ever know." Hie song, with its catchy
chorus and slick percussion, lacks the
substance of other Modest Mouse
songs but is undoubtedly a very good
track.

In contrast to "Dashboard," two
of the album's better songs,"Parting
of the Sensory" and "Fly Trapped in
a Jar" are far from pop. Both are full
of powerful drums and thunderous
guitar. Further accentuating the dif
ferences between "Dashboard,"
these two dark songs feature Brock's
vocals, which sound more like shout
ing than singing.
But right after the sober "Parting
of the Sensory" and "Fly Trapped in
a Jar" are the melodic "Missed the
Boat" and "Little Motel." These
songs provide a relief from Brock's
shouting and demonstrate the ma
ture Modest Mouse's musical range.
Because of their calm, melodic na
ture. these two tracks show how far
Modest Mouse has matured from its
roots.
Of course, in moving in this new
direction.it helps to have The Shins'

James Mercer, who sings backup on
"Florida." "Missed the Boat." and
"We've Got Everything." Granted.
Modest Mouse is starkly different
from The Shins, but that's the point:
Modest Mouse has changed so
much that comparing The Shins to
Modest Mouse is no longer unthink
able.
Modest Mouse's older fans may
complain that this album strays too
far from Modest Mouse's roots, but,
in fact, the opposite is true: Modest
Mouse has done a perfect job of bal
ancing its rock roots and its more re
cent pop direction. "We Were Dead
Before the Ship Even Sank" features
catchy hooks that explain why it's
now number one on the Billboard
charts, but it also has brilliant old
school rock songs that even my for
mer English teacher would love.
