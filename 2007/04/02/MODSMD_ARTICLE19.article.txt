# Here comes the money

The madness is almost over. Sixty
two games later, and my bracket
has been obliterated.
Sure,baseball season is officially un
derway as the Mets mollywhopped the
Cardinals last night, and the NBA play
offs are just a few weeks away But the
departure of college basketball for the
next couple of months will assuredly
leave a void in my life that can be satis
fied only by some more cowbell.
But luckily, there's still one game
left: Florida's probable thrashing of
Ohio State tonight for the NCAA title.
I'll be watching all right, but not so
much for the sake of hearing the
Gators' five starters talk about how
much they love each other but, rather,
to take part in the commercialization
that has swallowed college sports.
With coaches like Nick Saban and
Bob Stoops being paid ten times more
than their respective universities' pro
fessors, debate has emerged over
whether or not players as well should
be compensated for sacrificing their
time and energy in college. Surely with
college sports making so much money,
it would seem only logical that the ath
letes at center stage deserve to reap
some of the benefits and, thus, be paid
cash stipends for their play.
However, such a policy would be
impossible to implement, as universi
ties would fail to pay all their student
athletes fairly.
First, the introduction of salaries to
student-athletes' recruitment would
establish a slippery slope whereby col
lege athletics could grow to closely mir
ror professional leagues. Prospective
students could be persuaded to attend
a particular school due to favorable
monetary benefits.
So, of course, even if students were
to be paid some form of salary, the
stipends would have to be uniform
across all of the NCAA schools. But
therein lies even greater problems. At
most universities, men's basketball and
football are the sole sports that bring
home the bacon — in turn paying the
bills for the schools' other athletics.
Stipends would not only have to match
within the same sports at different uni
versities, but also amongst all sports at
all schools. Iltle IX would legally pro
hibit male athletes from being paid
more than their female counterparts,
even though men's sports typically gen
erate greater revenue.
And few colleges have the money to
even dream of such an endeavor. After
using basketball and football revenue
to pay for smaller sports, hiring coaches
and staff and awarding scholarships, lit
tle cash remains for the school. Only a
handful ot athletics programs are cur
rently making a profit. 1 lerego.in order
to keep stipends equitable, athletic pro
grams would have to draw money from
outside the department, i.e.. from in
creases in tuition — which is the last
thing any ot us want.Things would be
worse for public schools, which bring in
a great deal of money from the state.
Besides, athletes are the benefac
tors of many benefits aside from pure
cash. One could argue that athletic
scholarships are pretty much the same
as a cash stipend. These student-ath
letesgain the advantage of a quality ed
ucation in exchange for serving the
greater school community
Additionally, for those athletes hop
ing to one day make it in the bigs, uni
versities provide great publicity, allow
ing prospective pro players to showcase
their talent for scouts while at the same
time earning a degree to fall back on.
However, il these prospective ath
letes really value money over a poten
tial education, they can often choose to
go pro. While it is possible to enter
Major League Baseball without any
years in college, both the NBA and
NFL require some years in college,
making the NCAA a kind of spring
board into the pros. And as much as I
may advocate the importance of a col
lege education, we must recognize that
situations are different for different
people. Basketball and football players
deserve the same option available to
baseball players. Not everyone is
meant for college, and that includes
athletes.
Hie NCAA is. thankfully, light years
away from even considering paying ath
letes. But with so many athletes and out
siders advocating for the opposite, the
true madness may just be beginning.
