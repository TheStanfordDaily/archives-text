## Editorial Board Stranded students at Caltrain: hopefully no more 
### 
Nothing is more frustrating than re
turning to campus from an amazing
spring break, only to find oneself
stranded at the Palo Alto Caltrain station.
It's ,i long walk to the dorms, and two bags
ot luggage full of mementos from the Ba
hamas don't make it any easier. If all goes as
planned. Parking and Transportation will
spare countless students from this dismal
fate with a long-overdue increase in the free
Marguerite shuttle service on the weekends
surrounding spring break —May 24 and
April 1.
During spring break, some 8.000 Stan
ford students depart for fun and exciting va
cation spots around the globe. But before
they can hit the beaches or return to campus
afterward, many of those students must first
get to the Caltrain station via train (from the
San Jose airport) or the KX bus (from
SFO).
In years past, getting from the dorms to
the Caltrain station and back was a serious
damper on spring break joviality. Parking
and Transportation Services would only
run the sparse weekend Margaruite sched
ule. i! it actually ran any buses at all. The
irony, of course, is that many students only
use public transportation at the beginning
or end of breaks. During the rest of the
school year, students often find rides or use
the cars they keep on campus, but. the one

time students need it most, P&TS offers
scant options. Encouraging public trans
portation is always environmentally re
sponsible. hut the beginning and end of
spring break represent a special opportuni
ty to reach a larger group of students. Now.
P&TS has taken a first step to fix this prob
lem by announcing a new. expanded spring
break service that will pick up students and
meet Caltrain trains at the beginning of
break from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday,
March 24 and again at the end of break
when students return to campus from 12
p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sunday. April 1.
TTiis sounds good on paper, and we at
ITie Daily commend P&TS's effort. We
know, however, that implementation is not
always easy —at least two students we
talked to were left stranded when their bus
didn't arrive at Tressider on Saturday
morning despite the new schedule. After
waiting 20 minutes past the stated arrival
time, they ended up walking across campus.
Hopefully P&TS fixed this problem by
April 1. Even so, P&TS leaves those stu
dents who arrive on the Saturday before
classes with a long walk or wait ahead of
them.
Even given this room for improvement,
we commend P&TS for listening to stu
dent's needs and for making spring break
that much more accessible.
