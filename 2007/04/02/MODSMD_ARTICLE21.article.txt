# Spring cleaning
## 
### 
Spring break is over, chaps. It's time to
ditch Cabo and get your tanned butts
back to the Farm where the water is
clean enough to drink, so you can put a lid
on all jokes professing the relative health
iness of tequila over the tap water south of
the border.
I didn't go anywhere exotic or "colle
giate" this year. Unlike some guys I know.
I did not have to pay off the corrupt Mexi
can policia several lien Franklins worth of
pesos to avoid arrest on multiple occa
sions. nor are there spanking new pics of
me and Jose (\ tagged on Facebook. Nope.
I mostly stayed on campus, lounging
around and watching one-day rentals from
Green.
I did manage to accomplish one con
crete task, however—l cleaned my room.
Now. I know this doesn't sound like much
of a feat to you neatfreak, borderline
OCD, anal-retentive model citizens who
populate the Stanford campus, with your
pristine handwriting, fancy-schmancy me
chanical pencils with nanosized lead, and
good trash-disposal habits, but some of us
arc less concerned with such matters, so a
thorough room cleaning is a fearsome
event.
In case you haven't been reading the
news (i.e.. the Style section of The New
York Times), mess is the new black. Or, al
ternatively, cliittcr is hotter. There's a fasci
nating new book out called "A Perfect
Mess, rhe Hidden Benefits of Disorder,"
which I haven't actually read. But the theo
ry (pseudo-theory) it advances is fascinat
ing enough to merit discussion.
According to the authors, empirical
studies have shown that messy people are
often more successful than their neatfreak
colleagues, largely due to efficiency losses
on the part of the latter, who waste time and
energy (which equal money) organizing
their desks and workspaces.
Other theories suggest that people
compelled to constantly keep their envi
ronment squeaky clean are simply acting
out of an inability to focus on the task at
hand—they get distracted and fool
themselves into productivity with super
fluous organization. I'm sure these are
the same suckers who buy stuff on in
fomercials.
Additional claims mentioned in The
limes review were equally humorous and
ego-stroking: e.g., we creatures of clutter
are more creative, mentally limber and bet
ter parents than our organization-minded
brethren. Conversely, the neatnik crowd is,
on the whole, a "humorless" and "inflexi
ble"' bunch with too much free time. I really
loved that one.
But before you all flip out and call me a
la/y heathen. I should qualify my remarks,
112 irst of all. I rarely buy the conclusions
drawn in popular "studies" about living and
health that show up in the newspaper or on
Yahoo.com. Second, for every argument

against neatfreakism, there are several
more classic arguments against lazy slobs
like me.
I just happen to find the old arguments
less convincing. According to a study cited
by the National Association of Profession
al Organizers (a truly sorry lot. no doubt),
"two-thirds of respondents believed work
ers with messy desks were seen as less ca
reer-driven than their neater colleagues."
Well, aside from the fact that I'm probably
one of the least career-driven individuals
you'll ever meet at Stanford, 1 find it diffi
cult to take seriously any statement char
acterizing the "beliefs" of an unknown
sample of workers about how their col
leagues are "seen." Yes. that tells me oh so
much. Let me counter with a handy little
quotation from my buddy Einstein, who
was himself no slouch: "If a cluttered desk
is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then,
is an empty desk?"
Nevertheless, I sucked it up this week,
took out the trash, vacuumed the floor,
washed my sheets and —gasp —cleaned up
my desk, which had been out of commis
sion for over a quarter. I'm happy to say
that I was almost proud of my efforts—
proud enough to tell my mom over the
phone. With complete seriousness, she
replied: "That's great! Have you heard of
something called Spring Cleaning?" I
gruffly barked back: "Yes. 1 have. Obvi
ously."
If there were a moral to the story, it
would be that moderation is the key—there
has to be some semblance of balance be
tween neatness and mess. I'm always sur
prised at the sheer imbalance of personality
types among the Stanford population,
though. Aside from the hippie/stoner
denizens of a few choice residences, the
people here are scarily neat, at least by my
rather low standards.
I guess a little Spring Cleaning never
hurt anyone, and it's a good way to usher in
the new quarter —a quarter ripe with op
portunities to clutter my spacious one
room double all over again.
Oh. and if you happen to be my new
roommate (my old roomie is off to Beijing)
whom I've yet to meet, please take this col
umn with a grain of a salt—l promise to
keep the place livable.

Alex is writing this column front a desk he
hasn t used in a quarter. But if you can relate
to the mess-monger within him, send him an
email at acoleyfWfl stanford.edu.

hurt anyone, and it's a good way to usher in
the new quarter —a quarter ripe with op
portunities to clutter my spacious one
room double all over again.
Oh. and if you happen to be my new
roommate (my old roomie is off to Beijing)
whom I've yet to meet, please take this col
umn with a grain of a salt—l promise to
keep the place livable.

Alex is writing this column front a desk he
hasn t used in a quarter. But if you can relate
to the mess-monger within him, send him an
email at acoleyfWfl stanford.edu.
