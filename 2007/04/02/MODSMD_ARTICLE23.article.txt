# Springtime in Paris
## 
### 
I love Stanford as much as the next person.
It's been said a thousand times before,but
living here really is like being in a wonder
ful, shiny bubble. We take classes from world
famous professors; we worry about things
like the existence of epiphenomenal qualia
and the role of women in medieval literature;
we're surrounded by palm trees and abstract
sculptures. Everything here is surreal in the
best sense of the word.
So as the last days of winter quarter were
winding down. I began to feel a little anxious
about going abroad because, more than any
thing, I love spring and Stanford is as good a
place as any (actually, better than most) to
spend these three months. It's the one time of
the year when Stanford lives up to its reputa
tion as the happiest university in the world.
The weather is perfect, the flowers are in
bloom and. suddenly, everything seems pos
sible. You can wake up to the sound of birds
chirping, spend all day lounging around that
weird red fountain in front of Green or go
swimming in the Claw.
I felt a pang of nostalgia when I realized I
would have to wait another whole year be
fore once again seeing springtime at Stan
ford. But as I continued reminiscing, I real
ized that, as wonderful, beautiful and relax
ing as it is, it's also a little monotonous.
I have my comfortable routine—which
mainly involves hanging around the Moon
beans area, rubbing elbows with the smokers
and European grad students (who are often
one and the same). 1 love laying out on the
grass with a good book or enjoying one of
those delicious Moonbeans' ham and cheese

croissants, but it gets boring.
It's always the same people doing the
same things. I've gotten to know nearly all of
the regulars of the Meyer-Green area and. as
much as I love bumping into friends and get
ting sidetracked by unplanned three-hour
coffee breaks, the excitement of Stanford is
gone.
During the Saturday night before Dead
Week (the last real Saturday of winter quar
ter), a few friends and I sat out in the rocking
chairs on the porch at Casa Italiana and
watched the Row weekend scene wind down.
It was so hilariously predictable: Groups of
scantily clad girls stumbling home in four
inch heels and drunk guys hollering at each
other, throwing shoes at trees. The only ex
citement of the night was when a group of
people stopped in front of the house, carrying
three large block letters.(I think they were an
A, an L and an N. But it was dark; i can't be
sure.) Suddenly, one of them grabbed the L
and took off running toward the post office.
The others shrugged, exchanged looks and
slowly began walking toward Flo Mo.
I realized that if a guy running away with
a big letter counts as the most exciting event

of the night, it was time for a change. After
nearly three years. I've become disenchanted
with the whole Stanford scene and, suddenly,
I couldn't be happier that 1 was going to
spend spring quarter in Paris. Yes. springtime
at Stanford is pleasant. But I'd be willing to
bet that springtime in Paris is great.
There are few places in the world that
have an aura quite like Paris. It's the city of
ex-pat intellectuals discussing philosophy
over coffee and cigarettes; of hip cafes with
endless wine, expensive cheese and to-die
for chocolate; of Coco Chanel, Christian
Dior and all those other trend-setting fashion
gods. The name is practically synonymous
with art and elegance.
Sure, I've visited before. And I have to
admit, the city didn't exactly live up to my ex
pectations: It was dirty, full of tourists and a
tad kitschy. Sadly, it wasn't quite the exciting,
chic artistic center I had hoped for.
But still, I can't help but get butterflies in
my stomach every time I think about spend
ing three whole months living like a real
Parisian (well, kind of like a real Parisian).
There's something about the city—not the
actual, physical city itself, but just the idea of
the city, the very notion of Paris —that's mes
merizing. And even if my life there isn't filled
with sultry cafe rendezvous, even if I don't all
of sudden find the artistic inspiration hidden
within, at least everything will be new and un
expected.

By the time this paper goes to print, Vicky will
have been in Paris for at least 48 hours. Email
