"We just didn t get it done," senior

wet face turned from the media. "We
weren't playing well [in the first half]. I
thought that we were lucky to be up at
halftime. We just didn't do as well as we
could have done, and we really tried to

appointed," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "This will rank up with all
the opportunities that we've wasted,
hut I think this is a very unfortunate
wasted opportunity."
Stanford got off to a rocky start
against the Seminoles. Less than three
minutes into the game, Florida State
had established a six-point lead, and
the margin hovered around there for
the next 10 minutes.
Although the Seminoles quickly got
into foul trouble, putting Stanford in
the bonus within seven minutes, the
Cardinal was unable to convert from
the stripe. Stanford hit three of eight
free throw attempts and continued to
trail with a sub-par defensive effort.

Freshman center Brook Lopez led Stanford
with 1 8 points and seven rebounds in the
Cardinal's 78-58 loss to Louisville in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Card climbed within four at
8:24. and. after a four-minute scoring
drought for both teams. Smith rallied
her teammates with a jumper. Senior
center Kristen Newlin followed to tie
the score at 23, and Smith's signature
hook shot gave Stanford its first lead
with 2:51 to play in the first period.
Despite missing all nine of its
three-point attempts, Stanford went
into the break with a 29-25 lead.
"Our free throws really hurt us a
lot. especially in the first half, [as did]
going 0-for-9 from [the three-point
line].' VanDerveer said. "But, we
were not taking good shots. We need
ed to be more patient. 1 didn't think
we were playing well in the first half
[even though] we had the lead."
Fhe start of the second period ap
peared to bring much of the same:
two quick fouls by the Seminoles put
them deeper into foul trouble.Things
started to look as if they would swing
in the Cardinal's favor when junior
guard Candice Wiggins sunk a long
three to give Stanford its biggest lead
of the night at seven points.
Instead. Florida State capitalized
on an ill-advised Stanford possession
and subsequent turnover by the Car
dinal and and rallied to tie the game
at 32 with 17:44 to play The next five
minutes were marked by back-and
forth play, as there were six lead
changes and four ties.
After Wiggins' final field goal of
the night a three-pointer that put
the C ardinal up by one at 8:42 â€” the
Noles took off on an 11-2 run from

which Stanford never recovered.
VanDerveer credited Florida
State with aggressiveness and athleti
cism hut also noted that the Cardinal
players did not look relaxed.
"At halftime I actually talked to
Candice [and the team] and said,
"You're playing too hard,'" Van-
Derveer said. "(1 told them to] just
relax and play. I just felt like people
played with a burden on them. 'lhey
were just playing tight, and it's hard to
calm people down."
VanDerveer went on to note that
playing at home sometimes "puts
extra pressure on the team," and this
led to the deterioration of the shared
offense that characterized Stanford's
play throughout the season.
"We had to be able to play
through things."she said."We needed
people to knock down shots. We
needed more offense than just [fresh
man forward Jayne Appel| on the
block and just Candice from three."
While Wiggins led all scorers with
1 ( > points and five assists, only five
other Stanford players added p< tints to
the scoreboard, highlighted by 12
points from Smith and 14 from Appel.
Meanwhile, all eight Florida State
players contributed. Guard Shante
Williams was the Seminoles' leading
scorer with 16. closely followed by
guard Mara Freshour with 15. The
smaller Florida State squad also
found a way to out-rebound the Car
dinal 37-35. an area in which Stanford
usually dominates opponents by
nearly seven boards per game.
Regardless of the team's struggles
in the post and Appel's foul trouble
(she fouled out with four minutes re
maining). VanDerveer praised the
freshman forward for her consistency
in her tirst NCAA appearance. Appel

became the school's single-season
leader in blocks, posting 60 on the
year.
"I thought Jayne was really steady
out there, except for the fouls." Van-
Derveer said. "We could go to her in
side, and she had a really good poise.
I thought she did a really good job."
In the end, though. Wiggins
thought it came down to what shots
tell, likening it to the teams' meeting
in last year's tournament, when Stan
ford defeated the Seminoles 88-70 in
the second round.
"It seemed like a similar team,"
she said. "| Iliis time,] they just hit big
shots. We obviously could've done
better. It's a big disappointment."
Florida State went on to the Sweet
16, where they lost 55-43 to LSU, the
team which beat the Cardinal in last
year's Elite Eight in a heartbreaking.
62-59 buzzer-beater. Stanford failed
to advance to the Final Four for the
10th consecutive year.
Ihat comes as an especially big
disappointment for the Cardinal's
four'seniors:Smith.Newlin.Clare Bo
densteiner and Markisha Coleman.
"1 was thanking her for a great
three years." Wiggins said of her post
game embrace with Smith. "I've
learned so much and [have become) a
better person getting to know her. I
was so honored to have played with
her, and so grateful. I ler career is not
anywhere near over."
But the 2006-2007 season is over,
and Stanford will have to bide its time
for another year, waiting for the op
portunity to prove itself again.
"It is hard," VanDerveer said."lt's
hard when it's over."
Ihe Card dominates Idaho State, 96-
58 in first round
Just two days before its second

round loss, Stanford was riding a team
high. In a show of all-around strength,
the Cardinal dominated Idaho State,
96-58. on Mar. 17. Smith and Wiggins
weren't the only ones who found the
spotlight as Stanford trounced the 15-
seed Bengals, ending their season at
17-14 record (11-5 Big Sky).
VanDerveer set the tone for the
game by starting her experienced
players, and the decision paid off im
mediately. In the first ten minutes of
play. Smith and junior Cissy Pierce
combined for all of the Cardinals 22
points, including Pierce's 10-point run
in the opening five minutes.
Wiggins recognized Pierce's con
tribution (a game-total 14 points) as a
momentum boost for her teammates.
"[She showed] that she's a great
shooter and people can't just sag off
of her," Wiggins said. "We have great
perimeter shooters on our team, and
it just builds our confidence when she
is hitting her outside shots."
VanDerveer agreed, noting espe
cially that Pierce's play gave other Stan
ford players opportunities by diverting
the focus of Idaho State's defense.
"Cissy is a really good shooter and
they left her open, which gave her a
rhythm, and she hit her shots today,"
VanDerveer said. "It felt like it took
some pressure off Candice.and it also
gave Brooke a lot of good looks."
Pierce was one of four Cardinal
women to register in the double dig
its: Smith tallied a season-high 20
points. Wiggins added another 16 and
freshman guard Melanie Murphy
had 10. Smith said that much of her
success came from finding holes in
the defense.
"My shots were falling, so that's al
ways fun and exciting. Just trying to
take what the defense gave me," she

said. "With most zones, you just have
to find the openings because there
are going to be gaps in zone play. You
just have to find openings and make
reads [to] get open looks."
Stanford first tore the game open
at 11:27 in the first half, beginning a
27-7 spurt that lasted nearly until the
break. In the second half, the Bengals
never got closer than 18. despite the
efforts of Natalie Doma. The junior
center led Idaho State with 32 points
and nine rebounds. Her performance
made her the Bengals' all-time lead
ing scorer with 1,554 points.
Stanford did not allow any other
Idaho State player to break the dou
ble-digit barrier in scoring. In fact,
while the Bengals are usually bol
stered by junior guard Andrea Light
foot, who averages 18.5 points and
five rebounds per game, the Cardinal
defense held her to only four points.
"In order for us to get going offen
sively [that day], I think we had to
play well defensively," VanDerveer
said.
Stanford's frontcourt made it hap
pen, out-rebounding Idaho State 53-
20. Additionally, Appel's three blocks
matched the school's single-season
record of 58.
Once the Card got going, there
was no stopping its offensive momen
tum. Whenever the starters got to
rest, the bench picked up exactly
where their teammates had left off:
Murphy offered 10 points in 19 min
utes, freshman Michelle Harrison
added eight points and five rebounds
and sophomore forward Morgan
Clyburn hit two quick threes in the
final four minutes.
