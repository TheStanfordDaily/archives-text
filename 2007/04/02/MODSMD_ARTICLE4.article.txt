# Louisville trounces Card in NCAA opening round
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
LHXINGTON, Ky. â€” Maybe Stanford
should have been in the NIT after all.
The Cardinal saved its worst game of the
season for its most important game of the
season: the first round of the NCAA Tourna
ment on March 15. Stanford played lethargi
cally all afternoon, getting beat to seemingly
every rebound and loose ball, yielding open
shot after open shot on defense and allowing
Louisville's full-court press to force 22
turnovers. Louisville hardly broke a sweat,
using a 22-3 run to build a 46-20 halftime lead
and cruise to a 78-58 victory.
