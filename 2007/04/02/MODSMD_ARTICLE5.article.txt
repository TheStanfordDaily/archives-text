3/15 vs. Louisville L 78-58
GAME NOTES: Louisville's tough press jumpstarted the
Cardinals to the early 41-13 lead, from which Stan
ford could not recover.
"It kills me because I didn't see it com
ing," head coach Trent Johnson said. "The
thing that bothers me the most is that
Louisville was flat-out the aggressor from
the start. And that bothers me a lot."
The team couldn't decide post-game
whether it was a Rupp Arena packed with
Louisville fans arriving from their campus
just 75 miles away, the 9:30 a.m. Pacific(l2:3o
p.m. local) game time, the 8 a.m. pre-game
practice, the Cardinal's youth, its lack of
NCAA experience or simply a bad matchup
against a tough Louisville team that did them
in. But the autopsy result was secondary:
Stanford's season had come to a crushing,
heartbreaking close.
"We just didn't handle the pressure well,"
sophomore guard Anthony Goods said. "We
may have had some jitters in the beginning,
but that doesn't excuse the whole 40 minutes
BOX SCORE

of basketball. You hate to go out like this, but we just have to use
it as fuel for the fire."
Coach Johnson took the blame for his team playing soft.
"We talked all week,once we got the announcement that we
were in. and 1 knew it was going to be a concern trying to settle
them down," he said. "It was really obvious that they were tight
and weren't relaxed to start.
"But 1 didn't get the message across. I thought we were in a sit
uation where we were going to play well, quite frankly. And we
didn't."
When asked how he could have better prepared his team,
Johnson seemed even more at a loss.
"I probably would've given them drugs and let them drink a
beer or two," he joked. "Maybe that would've relaxed them a lit
tle more."
Louisville beat Stanford in the paint 36-22 on the game and 22-
2 on first-half points oft turnovers. Both factors were key to an
early lead. Stanford committed eight turnovers in the first eight
minutes, allowing Louisville to never look back from an early 12-
2 lead. Center David Padgett and fellow big-man Earl Clark
scored 15 of Louisville's 19 points during that time, and many of
them came on turnover-induced fast breaks.
"Full-court pressure was not something we've seen in games,
but we worked on it in practice," (Joods said."We planned on at
tacking it. hut we got out there and started thinking too much. We
started playing to their advantage when we started thinking, and
they forced some turnovers."
Many observers, including coach Johnson, expected
Louisville's pressure to cause Stanford headaches, so perhaps
Stanford's biggest disappointment came in the halfcourt. where
Padgett — and not Brook Lopez — was the game's dominant
big man. The wily junior's pump fake had the freshman Lopez
and his teammates leaping into the air time after time, resulting in
fouls and easy lay-ups.
Brook and fellow centers Robin Lopez, a freshman, and Peter
Provvitt. a junior, combined for 13 of Stanford's 22 fouls, and
Louisville scored 21 points from the charity stripe.
"They started the game by pounding the ball inside." senior
forward Fred Washington said. "Padgett got a couple of and-ones
that got them going early. We couldn't stop their momentum."
Brook Lopez led all players with 18 points on 8-of-15 shoot
ing, but only four of his points came in the first half, when the out
come was still in doubt. Meanwhile, Louisville leaned on its
depth, as five players cracked double figures (Padgett and fresh
man guard Edgar Sosa led Louisville with 16apiece),and 14 play
ers s;iw action, with the starters resting for the Texas A&M tilt two
days down the line.
Perhaps one of the more positive consequences of the
NCAA Tournament was Brook Lopez's post-game decision to
return to Stanford next year. Coach Johnson said after the loss
that he planned to meet with his freshman star in the next week
to discuss the possibility of declaring for the NBA draft. ESPN's

Chad Ford projected Lopez the eighth overall pick last month.
"1 want what is best for him/'Johnson said. "If he is capable of
being in a position where he can be one of the top 16 players draft
ed. then shame on anybody who would not want him to achieve
that or who would not want that for him. A Stanford education in
one year is probably like a lot of places in four years. Trust me, I
know — I graduated from Boise State."
But Lopez insisted he had far too much still to learn on the col
lege hardwood and announced that he would be coming back.
"I can't really see myself in the NBA next season," Lopez said.
"I'm really looking forward to coming back. We haven't really
done anything in college yet, and there's so much more we need

Chad Ford projected Lopez the eighth overall pick last month.
"1 want what is best for him/'Johnson said. "If he is capable of
being in a position where he can be one of the top 16 players draft
ed. then shame on anybody who would not want him to achieve
that or who would not want that for him. A Stanford education in
one year is probably like a lot of places in four years. Trust me, I
know — I graduated from Boise State."
But Lopez insisted he had far too much still to learn on the col
lege hardwood and announced that he would be coming back.
"I can't really see myself in the NBA next season," Lopez said.
"I'm really looking forward to coming back. We haven't really
done anything in college yet, and there's so much more we need
to do."

3/15 vs. Louisville L 78-58
GAME NOTES: Louisville's tough press jumpstarted the
Cardinals to the early 41-13 lead, from which Stan
ford could not recover.
"It kills me because I didn't see it com
ing," head coach Trent Johnson said. "The
thing that bothers me the most is that
Louisville was flat-out the aggressor from
the start. And that bothers me a lot."
The team couldn't decide post-game
whether it was a Rupp Arena packed with
Louisville fans arriving from their campus
just 75 miles away, the 9:30 a.m. Pacific(l2:3o
p.m. local) game time, the 8 a.m. pre-game
practice, the Cardinal's youth, its lack of
NCAA experience or simply a bad matchup
against a tough Louisville team that did them
in. But the autopsy result was secondary:
Stanford's season had come to a crushing,
heartbreaking close.
"We just didn't handle the pressure well,"
sophomore guard Anthony Goods said. "We
may have had some jitters in the beginning,
but that doesn't excuse the whole 40 minutes
BOX SCORE

of basketball. You hate to go out like this, but we just have to use
it as fuel for the fire."
Coach Johnson took the blame for his team playing soft.
"We talked all week,once we got the announcement that we
were in. and 1 knew it was going to be a concern trying to settle
them down," he said. "It was really obvious that they were tight
and weren't relaxed to start.
"But 1 didn't get the message across. I thought we were in a sit
uation where we were going to play well, quite frankly. And we
didn't."
When asked how he could have better prepared his team,
Johnson seemed even more at a loss.
"I probably would've given them drugs and let them drink a
beer or two," he joked. "Maybe that would've relaxed them a lit
tle more."
Louisville beat Stanford in the paint 36-22 on the game and 22-
2 on first-half points oft turnovers. Both factors were key to an
early lead. Stanford committed eight turnovers in the first eight
minutes, allowing Louisville to never look back from an early 12-
2 lead. Center David Padgett and fellow big-man Earl Clark
scored 15 of Louisville's 19 points during that time, and many of
them came on turnover-induced fast breaks.
"Full-court pressure was not something we've seen in games,
but we worked on it in practice," (Joods said."We planned on at
tacking it. hut we got out there and started thinking too much. We
started playing to their advantage when we started thinking, and
they forced some turnovers."
Many observers, including coach Johnson, expected
Louisville's pressure to cause Stanford headaches, so perhaps
Stanford's biggest disappointment came in the halfcourt. where
Padgett — and not Brook Lopez — was the game's dominant
big man. The wily junior's pump fake had the freshman Lopez
and his teammates leaping into the air time after time, resulting in
fouls and easy lay-ups.
Brook and fellow centers Robin Lopez, a freshman, and Peter
Provvitt. a junior, combined for 13 of Stanford's 22 fouls, and
Louisville scored 21 points from the charity stripe.
"They started the game by pounding the ball inside." senior
forward Fred Washington said. "Padgett got a couple of and-ones
that got them going early. We couldn't stop their momentum."
Brook Lopez led all players with 18 points on 8-of-15 shoot
ing, but only four of his points came in the first half, when the out
come was still in doubt. Meanwhile, Louisville leaned on its
depth, as five players cracked double figures (Padgett and fresh
man guard Edgar Sosa led Louisville with 16apiece),and 14 play
ers s;iw action, with the starters resting for the Texas A&M tilt two
days down the line.
Perhaps one of the more positive consequences of the
NCAA Tournament was Brook Lopez's post-game decision to
return to Stanford next year. Coach Johnson said after the loss
that he planned to meet with his freshman star in the next week
to discuss the possibility of declaring for the NBA draft. ESPN's
