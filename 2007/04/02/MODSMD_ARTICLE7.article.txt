## Auto burglaries flare up 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a scries of on-campus car burglaries
which began early in February, the Department
of Public Safety has issued a number of warnings
urging students to lock their car doors and to re
move valuables from their vehicles.
Police fliers on car windshields and elsewhere
around campus warn that thieves have shown a
propensity to target portable global positioning
system (GPS) units.
The fliers also warn that "it is not uncommon
for suspects to walk down a row of vehicles and
check vehicle doors to see if they are unlocked."
Deputy Chris Cohendet advised students not
to leave anything of value in their vehicles.
"Don't try to hide any laptops or backpacks in
your seats," he warned. "Burglars are smart, and
they try to take advantage of that. Make sure the
car is locked and use your alarm at all times."
Cohendet also cautioned against trying to

conceal valuable items in glove compartments or
under seats, saying that thieves are aware of these
tactics.
"Obviously they're looking in windows and
seeing what they like," he said. "They're seeing
these devices inside windows. St) they're basical
ly window smashers. Ihey'll break windows with
a ceramic chip or some kind of prying tool to get
in; they're very slick.
The burglaries — which have resulted in eight
stolen GPS units — have been clustered around
dormitory parking lots and student housing
areas. Other areas around campus have general
ly been unaffected.
According to Cohendet. these crimes do not
reflect a decrease in campus safety.
"We'll get an increase in auto burglaries, we'll
arrest someone, and then there'll be a decrease,"
he said. "In a few months, there'll be another in
crease. Crime definitely comes in waves."
