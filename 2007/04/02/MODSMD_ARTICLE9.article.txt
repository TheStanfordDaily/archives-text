According to a Mar. 20 press re

press release. "She has the mindset of a
groundbreaking scientist, the skills of a
bold and resourceful leader and a passion
for research on the frontiers of knowl
edge. These skills alone would qualify her
to lead Bio-X. When one adds her many
years of experience at Stanford to the

son who is more ready and able to lead a
program of such critical importance to
the University.
