INTRODUCTION TO ANTHROPOLOGICAL GENETICS
1 his coursc. which has no prerequisites, considers what genetics can tell us about the evolution and beha\ tor of humans
and other primates Genetic methods ha\c been brought to bear on a number of fundamental questions in anthropology
including: when did our lineage diverge from the apes'' How did they get Neanderthal DNA and what does it tell us'.'
How does our genetic past relate to our risk of genetic diseases'' How can DNA be used to identify a skeleton or
a criminal?
