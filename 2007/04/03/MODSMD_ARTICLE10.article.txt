# Using lice to study clothing

### RACHEL WHELAN 
rhough humans' early coverings were sturdy
enough to shield us from the tribulations of nature,
they were too delicate to be preserved in the fossil
record — so scientists had nearly given up on de
termining when we started wearing clothing. That
is. until Mark Stoneking and his colleagues at the
Max Planck Institute in Germany decided to look
at lice.
1 lumans are host to three species of lice, which
differ mainly in where they live on our bodies.
Head lice are perfectly adapted to latch onto the
fibers of the scalp, whereas body lice grab onto
clothing fibers. All human lice need constant con
tact with the body's blood and warmth to survive,
but each species is comfortable only in its own
niche. A head louse transferred to an individual's
shirt will rush back towards her scalp.
Knowing that body lice originated from head
lice, Stoneking and his colleagues assumed that the
date when body lice appeared should correspond
with when clothing became common. Early cloth
ing would probably have been worn tightly
enough against the skin to encourage some head
lice to move out and set up camp in a new. wide
open ecological niche-cloth fibers. The ability to
colonize clothing fibers gave this new species of
body lice access to the rest of the human body that
wasn't covered in hair.
lb date the origin of body lice, the researchers
used a molecular clock approach. After using the
fossil record to establish the mutation rate of lice
DNA. they deduced how much time had elapsed
since the two lice species diverged by counting up

the number of differences between thei
DNA sequences.
Stoneking examined a global sam- (
pie of head and body lice cells, looking'
at DNA in both the cells' mitochon
dria and their nuclei. But in the end. i

was the mitochondrial DNA that was key
to dating species divergence.

Stored on chromosomes in the nu

cleus, nuclear DNA genes are re
arranged by about 50 percemt dur- /
ing the formation of sperm and egg {
cells, in a process called recombina- *
tion. Mitochondrial DNA. on the "
other hand, does not undergo re- 1

combination, making mutations eas
ier to track since the genes stay in the i
same place on each chromosome. V
'ITie earliest mitochondrial genes

contain only head lice DNA. support- „
ing the consensus that they existed first.
Then, around 72.000 years ago, lice genes

appear that are specific to body lice.
Stoneking concluded that body lice - and by
inference clothing - thus originated 72.000

i..u* u.lguioiwu -V
years ago.
But though Stoneking's results were aimed W
at solving a specific open historical question,
like other archaelogical studies, it is hedged with
a wide margin of error. In Stoneking's case, the
margin of error was 42,000 years - something that
may throw a wrench in any future plans to record
the speed of changes in prehistoric fashion.
