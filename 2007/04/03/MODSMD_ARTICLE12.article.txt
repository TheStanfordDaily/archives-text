athletes competed against the nation's best at the Palace of
Auburn Hills, home of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA, in
Auburn Hills. Mich. And while the Cardinal's top regular
season performer, 125-pound junior Tanner Gardner,
came away disappointed after falling short of his National
Title goal, lie still earned a seventh place finish,as did 157-
pound junior Josh Zupancic.
Despite his team's historic finish, head coach Kerry
McCoy still saw plenty of room for improvement following
the close ot his second year at the helm of the Stanford pro
gram.
"You're never satisfied," McCoy said. "Obviously we
had two All-Americans, which was incredible, but we had
five guys at the tournament,and we expected all five of our
guys to go out and be competitive for Ail-American hon
ors. But to have two guys place in one year, it's a big step."
As McCoy explained, the Cardinal pair's most impres
sive feat may not have been the All-American honors they
each earned, but the path they took to get there.
"[Zupancic] was unseeded, and |Gardner] fell short and
he could have easily packed it in and given up, but he
fought back and finished on a high note — it was great," he
said."And I just think it's a credit to all the guys in the pro
gram: not just the guys that were there at the tournament,
but the guys that helped them train, the coaches that were
at the tournament. We're all definitely moving in the right
direction."
Gardner's stated goal entering the tournament was to
come away a national champion, and as a returning All-
Amcrican and the No. 3 seed at 125 pounds in the tourna
ment, that goal seemed to be within the junior's reach. But
(iardner lost 8-3 against No. 6 Paul I )onahoe of Nebraska-
Lincoln in the quarterfinals, after Donahoe came roaring
out with live points on a takedown and near fall in the first
period.
Alter bouncing back to secure his seventh-place finish,
the Stanford standout is looking to make this year's tour-
nament a step toward even greater
improvement next season.
"1 think he learned a very valuable
lesson," McCoy said. "We've talked
before about him being focused on
the journey, not the destination. 1
think he did allow himself to be so
concerned with being a national
champ that he wrestled more con
cerned about what his opponents
were going to do than with what he
needed to do. which didn't allow him
to open up and get his stuff going."
"And the other thing is Tanner
missed 20 weeks of training this year,"
McCoy continued. "He went abroad
for spring quarter, and he was work
ing out, lifting and running, but he
wasn't wrestling. And the next 10
weeks he did an internship. So for him
to have taken that time off and still to
do that well — he wrestled his worst
tournament of the year and still fin
ished seventh in the country. That
shows how good he is."
Zupancic also suffered his first de
feat of the tournament in the quarter
finals, narrowly downed 2-1 by No. 1
seed Trent Paulson of lowa State.
McCoy pointed to Zupancic's mental
adjustments down the stretch as
being the difference for the Akron,
Ohio native.
"He just really recommitted him
self,"he said."He always knew that he
wanted to be an Ail-American, but
the last few months of the season he
made some necessary changes to take
the next step. There are just a couple
things that he's done a certain way his
whole life, and we tell him,' You know.
Josh, it's good to do that, but think
about doing it this way.' And he made
those adjustments, and 1 really think
that made a difference in winning
those close matches and keeping
them close as well."
The remaining three Cardinal
qualifiers for the NCAA Champi
onships failed to place in the tourna
ment. For fifth-year senior co-captain
Brian Perry (165 pounds), the event
marked his last competition for Stan
ford. But Perry's contributions to the
team in his final year went beyond his
performance on the mat, as McCoy
believes Stanford's lone senior in
spired his younger teammates.
"He embodied a lot of things,"
McCoy said. "One, he's a senior, he's
a captain. He placed in the conference

as a freshman and then wasn't even a
starter the next year. So for him to get
into the starting lineup, and what he
sacrificed to come back for his fifth
year, I think that really shows the
team a level of commitment and what
hard work and dedication will do."

athletes competed against the nation's best at the Palace of
Auburn Hills, home of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA, in
Auburn Hills. Mich. And while the Cardinal's top regular
season performer, 125-pound junior Tanner Gardner,
came away disappointed after falling short of his National
Title goal, lie still earned a seventh place finish,as did 157-
pound junior Josh Zupancic.
Despite his team's historic finish, head coach Kerry
McCoy still saw plenty of room for improvement following
the close ot his second year at the helm of the Stanford pro
gram.
"You're never satisfied," McCoy said. "Obviously we
had two All-Americans, which was incredible, but we had
five guys at the tournament,and we expected all five of our
guys to go out and be competitive for Ail-American hon
ors. But to have two guys place in one year, it's a big step."
As McCoy explained, the Cardinal pair's most impres
sive feat may not have been the All-American honors they
each earned, but the path they took to get there.
"[Zupancic] was unseeded, and |Gardner] fell short and
he could have easily packed it in and given up, but he
fought back and finished on a high note — it was great," he
said."And I just think it's a credit to all the guys in the pro
gram: not just the guys that were there at the tournament,
but the guys that helped them train, the coaches that were
at the tournament. We're all definitely moving in the right
direction."
Gardner's stated goal entering the tournament was to
come away a national champion, and as a returning All-
Amcrican and the No. 3 seed at 125 pounds in the tourna
ment, that goal seemed to be within the junior's reach. But
(iardner lost 8-3 against No. 6 Paul I )onahoe of Nebraska-
Lincoln in the quarterfinals, after Donahoe came roaring
out with live points on a takedown and near fall in the first
period.
Alter bouncing back to secure his seventh-place finish,
the Stanford standout is looking to make this year's tour-
nament a step toward even greater
improvement next season.
"1 think he learned a very valuable
lesson," McCoy said. "We've talked
before about him being focused on
the journey, not the destination. 1
think he did allow himself to be so
concerned with being a national
champ that he wrestled more con
cerned about what his opponents
were going to do than with what he
needed to do. which didn't allow him
to open up and get his stuff going."
"And the other thing is Tanner
missed 20 weeks of training this year,"
McCoy continued. "He went abroad
for spring quarter, and he was work
ing out, lifting and running, but he
wasn't wrestling. And the next 10
weeks he did an internship. So for him
to have taken that time off and still to
do that well — he wrestled his worst
tournament of the year and still fin
ished seventh in the country. That
shows how good he is."
Zupancic also suffered his first de
feat of the tournament in the quarter
finals, narrowly downed 2-1 by No. 1
seed Trent Paulson of lowa State.
McCoy pointed to Zupancic's mental
adjustments down the stretch as
being the difference for the Akron,
Ohio native.
"He just really recommitted him
self,"he said."He always knew that he
wanted to be an Ail-American, but
the last few months of the season he
made some necessary changes to take
the next step. There are just a couple
things that he's done a certain way his
whole life, and we tell him,' You know.
Josh, it's good to do that, but think
about doing it this way.' And he made
those adjustments, and 1 really think
that made a difference in winning
those close matches and keeping
them close as well."
The remaining three Cardinal
qualifiers for the NCAA Champi
onships failed to place in the tourna
ment. For fifth-year senior co-captain
Brian Perry (165 pounds), the event
marked his last competition for Stan
ford. But Perry's contributions to the
team in his final year went beyond his
performance on the mat, as McCoy
believes Stanford's lone senior in
spired his younger teammates.
"He embodied a lot of things,"
McCoy said. "One, he's a senior, he's
a captain. He placed in the conference

as a freshman and then wasn't even a
starter the next year. So for him to get
into the starting lineup, and what he
sacrificed to come back for his fifth
year, I think that really shows the
team a level of commitment and what
hard work and dedication will do."
"And Brian battled injuries
