athletes competed against the nation's best at the Palace of
Auburn Hills, home of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA, in
Auburn Hills. Mich. And while the Cardinal's top regular
season performer, 125-pound junior Tanner Gardner,
came away disappointed after falling short of his National
Title goal, lie still earned a seventh place finish,as did 157-
pound junior Josh Zupancic.
Despite his team's historic finish, head coach Kerry
McCoy still saw plenty of room for improvement following
the close ot his second year at the helm of the Stanford pro
gram.
"You're never satisfied," McCoy said. "Obviously we
had two All-Americans, which was incredible, but we had
five guys at the tournament,and we expected all five of our
guys to go out and be competitive for Ail-American hon

each earned, but the path they took to get there.
"[Zupancic] was unseeded, and |Gardner] fell short and
he could have easily packed it in and given up, but he
fought back and finished on a high note â€” it was great," he
said."And I just think it's a credit to all the guys in the pro
gram: not just the guys that were there at the tournament,
but the guys that helped them train, the coaches that were
at the tournament. We're all definitely moving in the right
direction."
Gardner's stated goal entering the tournament was to
come away a national champion, and as a returning All-
Amcrican and the No. 3 seed at 125 pounds in the tourna
ment, that goal seemed to be within the junior's reach. But

Lincoln in the quarterfinals, after Donahoe came roaring
out with live points on a takedown and near fall in the first
period.
Alter bouncing back to secure his seventh-place finish,
the Stanford standout is looking to make this year's tour-
