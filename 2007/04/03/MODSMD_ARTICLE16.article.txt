No. 55 Stanford (4-11. 1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) has been injury-ridden this
season and spring break proved to be no
exception. In early March when the Card
added is final remaining healthy player to
the starting lineup in its shutout loss to No.
48 California, the squad's dwindling player
availability was clearly apparent. Matches
against Brigham Young, i larvard, Arizona
and Arizona State showed Stanford's vul
nerable health with a hodge-podge of line
ups.
Stanford's one win came on Friday
against No. 75 Arizona (5-12, 0-2). After
sweeping all three doubles matches
against the Wildcats, No. 110 freshman
Richard Wire, sophomore Blake Muller
and freshman Kevin Kaiser picked up
three straight-set winsat the first.third and
fifth singles positions, respectively, to de
feat Arizona 4-3.
"I was happy with our match at Ari
zona." head coach John Whitlinger said.
"It's not an easy place to play. I was happy
that Rich came out and played well.
Unit's been a constant. Rich has done
a good job for us."
In only his first year on the Farm.
Wire played in the top singles spot for
the entire spring-break series, lhe
Fngland-native also picked up a dou
bles and a singles win against No. 69
BYU. as well as a convincing 6-1,6-0
defeat over Harvard's No. 77 Chris
( lay ton on Wednesday. I"he only sin
gles match Wire dropped on the week
was a tight 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 loss to Juan
C arlos Reba/a of No. 54 ASU on Sat
urday.
Stanford was originally scheduled
to lace BYU and No. 70 Santa Clara
last Monday, but rainy weather pre
vented the double-header from hap
pening. In addition to Wire's singles
victory, the only other point that the
Card scored in its 5-2 loss to the
Cougars was at the sixth singles spot,
where sophomore Jeff Zeller picked
up a 6-4.6-2 win.
Iwodays after that.Stanford faced
I larvard and suffered its fourth con
secutive Inss. Again. Wire and Zeller
tallied the ('ardinal's only two points

with wins at the first and fourth singles
positions. Although Stanford we I
coined the return of sophomore Matt
Bruch to the doubles lineup, senior
Fric McKean was forced to pull out ol
the singles lineup because ol the flu.
Stanford finally snapped its losing
streak on Friday with its win over Ari
zona, but then fell 6-1 against Arizona
State the next day. lhe Card's lone
point was earned by Muller.who won
his second consecutive singles match
with a three-set win over ASI l's Wes
Miller. Again,the ( ardinal lacked any
semblance of a full and healthy lineup,
as neither Bruch nor freshman Paul
Morrissey competed in singles.
Despite just coming oft ol ;i bus\
week, the team faces i\ full schedule to
open the spring quarter. Stanford
