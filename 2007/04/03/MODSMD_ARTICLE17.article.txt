Ihe No. 11 Stanford softhall team began
its 2007 Pacific-10 Conference schedule
brightly last week, beating Oregon State 2-1
last Friday before splitting a pair with No. 13
Oregon on the road.
Ihc Cardinal (26-7, 2-1 Pac-10) started
off the road trip with a pitchers' duel in Cor
vallis. Ore. Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
gave up an Oregon State run in the second
inning after two walks, a hit and a wild pitch,
but Penna bore down and allowed only two
hits over the next five innings to stifle the
Beavers.
Stanford tied the game three innings
later after a crucial two-out error by Oregon
State, and the Cardinal gained its first lead
on another two-out play in the top of the
seventh: an RBI double to right-center field
by freshman center fielder Alissa Haber.
Penna retired the Beavers in order to end
the game.
The next two games, down the road in
Eugene, Ore., were as different as night and
day. Ihe Ducks tagged Stanford and junior
Becky McCullough for five runs in the sec
ond inning on their way to an 8-0 victory,
which dropped McCullough to 8-5 on the
year. Stanford managed only four hits off of
Oregon starter Melissa Rice.
But after struggling on both sides of the
ball in its Saturday game, the Cardinal

bounced back and took the game to the
Ducks the following afternoon. Stanford
scored four runs in the first inning, five runs
in the fifth inning and six runs in the sixth in
ning to hack up stellar pitching from Penna,
who did not surrender a hit until the bottom
of the fifth.
Penna also drilled a grand slam in the
fifth, the Cardinal's second grand slam of
the day after junior third baseman Michelle
Smith hit one in the first inning after consec
utive singles by Stanford's top three hitters.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill chipped in
with another three RBI as the Cardinal
romped to a 15-4 victory.
The trip north came on the heels of a suc
cessful home weekend for Stanford just
after finals week. After a two-week
break at the end of winter quarter, the
Cardinal hosted Long Beach State,
Ohio, Portland State and UC-Davis
for the Stanford Invitational 11.
Stanford left the field at the end of
Saturday with a 2-0 record in the Invi
tational, having beaten Long Beach
and Ohio 3-0 and 5-4, respectively.
Penna recorded the shutout in the
first game and contributed an RBI, as
did Neill. The Cardinal overcame an
early two-run Ohio lead in the second
game by scoring four runs in the top of
the fifth inning and adding another in
the next frame. Senior left fielder

Jackie Rinehart went 3-for-4 with two
runs and McCullough pitched a com
plete game for Stanford.
The Cardinal wrapped up the Invi
tational title the next day, despite a 3-
0 loss to Portland State in Sunday's
first game. McCullough allowed only
one run over five innings of work hut
was still took the loss after her offense
only managed to scatter five hits over
seven innings.
That offense rebounded later in
the day with seven runs against Davis.
The Aggies took an early lead after a
second-inning homer, but Penna shut
them down after that.
Stanford continues its Pac-10
schedule on Thursday, with a home
match-up against California.
