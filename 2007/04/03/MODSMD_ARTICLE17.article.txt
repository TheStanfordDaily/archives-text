Ihe No. 11 Stanford softhall team began
its 2007 Pacific-10 Conference schedule
brightly last week, beating Oregon State 2-1
last Friday before splitting a pair with No. 13
Oregon on the road.
Ihc Cardinal (26-7, 2-1 Pac-10) started
off the road trip with a pitchers' duel in Cor
vallis. Ore. Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
gave up an Oregon State run in the second
inning after two walks, a hit and a wild pitch,
but Penna bore down and allowed only two
hits over the next five innings to stifle the
Beavers.
Stanford tied the game three innings
later after a crucial two-out error by Oregon
State, and the Cardinal gained its first lead
on another two-out play in the top of the
seventh: an RBI double to right-center field
by freshman center fielder Alissa Haber.
Penna retired the Beavers in order to end
the game.
The next two games, down the road in
Eugene, Ore., were as different as night and
day. Ihe Ducks tagged Stanford and junior
Becky McCullough for five runs in the sec
ond inning on their way to an 8-0 victory,
which dropped McCullough to 8-5 on the
year. Stanford managed only four hits off of
Oregon starter Melissa Rice.
But after struggling on both sides of the
ball in its Saturday game, the Cardinal

Ducks the following afternoon. Stanford
scored four runs in the first inning, five runs
in the fifth inning and six runs in the sixth in
ning to hack up stellar pitching from Penna,
who did not surrender a hit until the bottom
of the fifth.
Penna also drilled a grand slam in the
fifth, the Cardinal's second grand slam of
the day after junior third baseman Michelle
Smith hit one in the first inning after consec
utive singles by Stanford's top three hitters.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill chipped in
with another three RBI as the Cardinal
romped to a 15-4 victory.
The trip north came on the heels of a suc
