## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a definitive effort against a strong
field of Pacific-10 Conference teams last
week, the No. 2 Stanford men's golf team
managed to place fifth overall in the Ore
gon Duck Invitational in Eugene.Ore.
Stanford finished the first day of compe
tition in tenth place with a score of 597,
twenty strokes behind the leader, No. 6
Southern California. The third round of
play proved to he the best for the Cardinal
golfers, as they produced a tremendous
comeback, shooting a team score of 283
(five under par) to knock UCLA out of the
top live and conclude the tournament in
fifth place overall.
Playing at the Eugene Country Club, the
Pac-10 golfers were forced to compete in
difficult conditions of 40 to 50 degree
weather with intermittent showers and
overcast skies. The rough conditions hin
dered most of the golfers' games on an al
ready tough course — only six golfers shot
an even par (144) or better after day one:
Matt Ma (Oregon), Kevin Chappell
(UCLA). Jamie Lovemark (USC), Alex
Pi ugh (Washington), Michael Jensen (Cal-

"This tournament was tough on the guys
with wet. cold and rainy conditions." head
coach Conrad Ray said. "We weren't too
disappointed with that finish. We wanted to
place higher, but the guys were tired com
ing out of finals, and it was tough to just rush
off to Oregon."
Leading the Cardinal in the tournament
was senior Matt Savage, who concluded it
in a tie for sixth individually. Savage fin
ished day one with a score of 14 l ) (five over
par), putting him in a tie for 23rd. Taking
those first two rounds to get to know
the course. Savage moved up sixteen
places after he shot an impressive
third round of only 70 strokes (two
under par) to give him an overall
score of 219 (three over par).
'Matt Savage and the rest of the
guys had a great third round," Ray
said. "Savage's performance was
solid in such rough conditions. The
guys' final-round scores helped to
jump some teams to give us our fin
ishing rank in the tournament. On
this course, you have to hit solidly in
the fairway and be patient to shoot a
good score. I'm glad that we were
able to shoot a good team score that
final day in the difficult conditions."
The other members of the Cardi
nal squad also stepped up their level
of play in the third round,helping the
Cardinal to earn its fifth-place finish
in the tournament. Sophomore
Daniel Lim shot an overall score of
220 (four over par) to finish in a tie for
12th place. He ended the first two
rounds of play with a score of 149
(five over par), tying his teammate
Savage. Like Savage, he had a strong
third round with a score of 71 (one
under par) to move up eleven places.
Just one stroke behind Lim was
senior Zack Miller, who concluded
the invitational with a score of 221
(five over par) to put him in a tie for
17th. Miller tied freshman teammate
Joseph Bramlett after day one with a

score of 150 (six over par), putting
them both in a tie for 31st individual
ly. Miller scored 71 (one under par) in
the third round to move him up 14
places. Bramlett concluded the third
round with a score of 74 (two over
par) putting him in a tie for 24th with
a score of 224 along with his junior
teammate Rob Grube.
Grube ended day one with a score of
153 (nine over par) but came back
with a score of 71 (one under par) in
round three to shift him up 25 spots to
a tie for 24th overall. Rounding out
the Cardinal's performance was sen
ior Matt Shin, who tied for 65th with
a total score of 238.
Once again, the Stanford men's
golf team muscled its way to a top
five finish. ITie Cardinal men have
placed in the top five of all nine tour
naments that they have competed in
this year. Stanford is now looking to
improve upon its performance when
it hosts the U.S. Intercollegiate tour
nament, April 14-15.
"We have 15 teams coming in
from all over the country," Ray said.
"We have some top teams and some
schools outside the Pac-10, like
Arkansas and Xavier. ITie Stanford
Golf Course is in good shape, and I
know the guys are looking forward to
the tournament."
