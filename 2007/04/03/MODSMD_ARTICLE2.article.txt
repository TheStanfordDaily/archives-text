## Earthquake timing less mysterious Study pinpoints the sources of previously unpredictable natural disasters 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Earthquakes arc much more difficult to predict than storms
or floods, hut it can be as important to forecast earthquakes as
it is to forecast these other natural disasters. Major earth
quakes can devastate cities that lie atop major fault lines, but
the science of predicting them relies on a thorough under
standing of tectonic movements that occur deep underground.
A groundbreaking study by David Shelly, a Stanford scien
tist who recently completed his Ph.D. in geophysics, and Geo
physics Prof, (ireg Beroza, produced evidence showing that
improvements to scientists' ability to forecast major earth
quakes may be imminent.The study appeared in the March 15
edition of the scientific journal "Nature."
"It opens the door t0... how events might evolve during the
seismic cycle," Shelly said." We can start seeing some of the de
tails."
ITie report found that two types of "seismic events" actual
ly originate from the same source. Iliese"low-frequency earth
quakes" (I.FF) and "non-volcanic tremors" (or just "tremors"
for short) occur in deep subduction zones, where oceanic
plates are forced toward the center of the earth by adjacent
continents.
A tremor is a long, sustained shake that produces seismic
waves that are low in frequency and difficult to locate, while an
LFE is a more typical signal and can be traced back to its point
of origin.
Subduction zones are characterized by major earthquakes
that occur consistently but infrequently.The quake that caused
the 2004 tsunami on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia oc
curred in a subduction zone.
In their study, Shelly and Beroza looked at a subduction
zone beneath Shikoku. Japan, but others exist as well. On the
west coast of North America, the Cascadia region straddles
Oregon, Washington and southwestern Canada.
"Scientists have puzzled over how this tremor is generat
ed," Beroza said in an email to The Daily. "In this paper we
show that the tremor is generated by a swarm of tiny, and
somewhat slow acting, earthquakes."
"Low-frequency earthquakes are event-like bits of the
tremor." Shelly said. "You can see a single event within the
tremor [...) at a bunch of different stations that are tens of kilo
meters apart. |A] tremor is not really harder to detect but it's
harder to locate. You can't figure out which exact bits at the dif
ferent stations correspond to the same source."
Both are caused by the slip of the deep portion of subduc
tion zone faults, the study discovered. The slip builds up pres
sure in the shallow regions where major earthquakes typically
occur. Both types of events can therefore be linked to the
buildup of pressure that contributes to major earthquakes.
Shelly said.
"There might be a higher than normal chance [that major
earthquakes will occur] during these tremor episodes." Shelly
said.
Now that the locatable LFE and the more elusive tremor
are known to be linked, scientists can make headway on mod
eling the events that occur in the subduction zone.Those mod-

can contribute to the probabilistic
science of forecasting earthquakes.
" Iliis is the principle result of our
paper," Beroza said, "a new under
standing of this recently discovered
phenomenon."
"It's not a way to predict earth
quakes," Shelly said."There is poten
tial to quantify the increase in the
probability of a tremor."
But Shelly also said that predict
ing earthquakes may remain an im
possibility, even with this new infor
mation.
"There's a lot of debate over
whether earthquakes are predictable
at all," he said. "You can do it in a
probabilistic way but it's not possible
to issue a warning that an earthquake
will occur next Thursday."
The next step. Shelly said, is to de
velop models of how the deep re
gions of subduction zone faults be
have.
"We need to take what we're
learning and start modeling what the
behavior really is down there," he
said. "It would be a major step if we
can start to figure out the condi
tions."
