## Editorial Board Hold Kenney accountable for record deletions 
### 
Last month's revelation that men's
head swim coach Skip Kenney inten
tionally expunged the records of five
swimmers from the 2007 team media guide
is the most serious transgression the athlet
ic department has faced in recent years.
After initially denying that he had the
records deleted. Kenney admitted he
made "a serious mistake in judgment."
Athletic Director Boh Bowlsby responded
by suspending Kenney indefinitely with
pay. a suspension that prevented Kenney
from coaching the Cardinal during its sec
ond-place linish at the NCAA Champi
onships in March. Some have called for
Kenney's firing, and it is unclear whether,
when and in what form additional punish
ment will be imposed.
Despite statements of support for Ken
ney from former swimmers, there is no
question that Kenney's actions were out of
line. Stanford has stood out among Divi
sion I athletic programs for its refusal to
compromise its values as an institution,
and the swimming fiasco threatens to un
dercut Stanford's dedication to promoting
the highest standards of integrity in its
pursuit ot athletic excellence. Kenney's
deceitful tactics have no place in one of the

finest collegiate sports programs in the na
tion.
Kenney has enjoyed astounding suc
cess as a coach, guiding the men's swim
team to seven national championships in
nearly three decades at the helm of the
program.The Card this year took home its
26th consecutive Pac-10 championship, a
feat unprecedented in any sport.
Vet Kenney's impressive accomplish
ments do not mitigate the reprehensibility
of his dishonest and mean-spirited manip
ulation of athletes' hard-earned records.
Wins and losses are not always the ulti
mate measures of success. The record dele
tions and their consequences must not be
overlooked for expediency, or simply be
cause Kenney is one of our winningest
coaches.
A student charged with a violation of
the Fundamental Standard on par with
that perpetrated by Kenney would likely
face severe ramifications. While it is ulti
mately up to Bowlsby to determine
whether Kenney's misjudgment warrants
further sanction, we see no reason why
Kenney should be dealt with differently
than any other University employee or
student.
