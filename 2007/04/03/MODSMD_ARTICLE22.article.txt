# How to buy your conscience back

### 
Jake Gyllenhaal recently paid for
$1 ().()()() worth of trees to he planted in
Mozambique through a company that
promises to help individuals offset their car
bon output: what the company markets is
something analogous to international car
bon credits on a personal scale. It works
roughly like this: Jake pays the company,
they plant a tree, the tree consumes some
CO2 during its lifetime, and Jake thus
makes great strides towards offsetting his
personal carbon output. I looray for Jake.
But can it be so simple? Can it be that the
emissions from Jake's Oscar night limo are
tidily eaten by trees in Mozambique, which
in addition to cleaning the air also increase
the aesthetic merits of the Mozambican
landscape? Perhaps. But how is Jake to
know that the trees were actually planted?
And what if they were planted but died be
fore their time? And what if the trees were
imported from long distances, thus adding
(.()2 to the already ailing atmosphere?
Well, perhaps the company Jake used is le
gitimate and accountable. But what if it's
not .' What legislation — Mozambican,
American, or otherwise — oversees the op
erations and verifies the claims made by the
tree planting company? Is planting trees the
most effective way to offset your CO2 out
put'.' What about the argument that forests
take in light rather than reflecting it, as an
other landscape such as a desert might, thus
increasing warming?
America isn't adhering to the Kyoto Pro
tocol. and there is currently no legislation
regarding the future of our nation's carbon
output (although Monday's Supreme Court
ruling which holds the F.PA accountable for
regulating carbon outputs seems promis
ing). And without official standards or ac
countability. how can we hope to know
which personal carbon offset companies are
legitimate? Al Gore's Web site, climatecri
sis.net, encourages visitors to offset their
personal carbon output by donating money
to any one of three carbon offset groups,
one of which subsidizes wind power. ITiis
brings us to even thornier matters: Is subsi
dizing wind power really going to increase
consumption'.' Would the people who pur
chase wind power do it anyway, reuardless

of the price? And what about the wind
power companies? Are they nonprofit or
for-profit? And how does that affect the
way they handle their funds — funds that
were donated by visitors to Al Gore's Web
site?
Even Gore's Web site admits they "can't
guarantee'" that their offset programs will
"generate all the estimated environmental
benefits." On reading this. I wanted to know
the statistics. I low likely is it that the offsets
really will generate their estimated bene
fits.' Given the current phrasing, it could be
anywhere between 90% and s%.There's lit
tle accountability here; simply a call for
faith. I'm being implicitly asked to have
faith that these companies have good inten
tions and good science. Well. I learned from
12 years of Catholic school that simple faith
isn't much of a foundation, especially not for
good science.
()nce we move beyond these tangled is
sues of accountability and blind faith, we
get to matters that are trickier still. Carbon
credits are growing hugely in popularity;
$6 million of carbon credits were pur
chased in 2005, versus the $110 million sold
in 2006 (here, let's reflect reverently upon
America's ability to be influenced by
movies). Hordes of eco-conscious citizens
are now buying offsets to make all kinds of
events such as weddings, frat parties, reli
gious services, etc. carbon-neutral, and
celebs such as Leonardo DiCaprio,
Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt (not to men
tion Jake Gyllenhaal) are donating to
plant-a-tree funds. Land Rover has recent
ly begun purchasing offsets for its produc
tion emissions, and movie execs went so far
as to buy carbon offsets to cover the entire

production of "The Day After To
morrow," so as not to make that day
come any sooner. Whether these
offsets are actually working is one
question, but the knottier issue is
this: Isn't it irresponsible for people
to continue living unsustainably,
even if they're paying for it? Instead
of offsetting one's air conditioning
costs, why not just shut off the AC
and open a window? Shouldn't peo
ple start making lifestyle changes in
stead of shuttling their funds off to
Mozambique?
Well, yes. We should make
changes to our lifestyles. But realis
tically. I'm not going to refuse to go
home to Connecticut because the
cross-country flight is spewing CO2
into the atmosphere. Yes, 1 can
make fewer flights, hut I'm not
going to stop flying altogether,
which is why I wish 1 knew where to
buy my carbon offsets. And 1 won't
know with any degree of certainty
until our nation hops onboard the
eco-consciousness train and starts
enacting legislation regarding car
bon offsets and other efforts to re
duce our nation's contribution to
climate change.
