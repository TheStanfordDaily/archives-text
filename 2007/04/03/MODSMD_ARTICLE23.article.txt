In support of Coach Kenney
In response to your recent coverage of
( oath Skip Kenney s removal of swimmers'
times from the Stanford Swimming media
guide, a large contingent of alumni wanted
to share our own personal experiences
while a part of Skip's program.
I it st. we want to be clear we were happy
to see an apology from Skip for his error in
judgment. However, his actions in this case
do not represent our thirty years of experi
ence swimming for him, and we are confi
dent that the majority of his swimmers feel
similarly.
Skip's support and his ability to foster a
family and team environment at Stanford
led many of us to great heights in our sport.

His impressive record of 26 consecutive
Pac-10 conference championships and 7
NCAA team titles speaks for itself.
Still, it was Skip's efforts outside the
pool, his intense focus on our personal de
velopment and his desire to see us grow into
men that we are most appreciative of to this
day. Skip s teams are always successful in
competition, but we are just as proud of the
fact that they are also models of the student
athlete ideal. Skip has coached dozens of
Academic All-Americans in his thirty years
as head coach,and his athletes have not only
graduated, but gone on to highly successful
careers after college.
