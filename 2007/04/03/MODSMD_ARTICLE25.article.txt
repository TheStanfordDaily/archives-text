# My depression is SO embarrassing
## 
### 
I shit you not. when I started to cry at the
Bridge it was like a little tat schoolgirl
blubbering in the bathroom stall hoping
nobody could hear her. wishing recess was
never over and she could just hide from the
bullies forever. And the tight walls would
tenderly close her in until there was nothing
left in the whole world except comforting
darkness and splendid isolation.
It wasn't a good cry. Men are allowed to
weep in a few precise situations: funerals,
drunken bonding and movies with last
minute sports showdowns and/or emotional
ly distant father figures (which is why
"Hoosiers" can make even a fiercely hetero
sexual linebacker Satanist bawl). I knew
when I went to the Bridge I was going to cry.
because psychiatric appointments (even with
peer counselors) are free passes for manful
tears: hard rock resolve pierced ever so
briefly by an admission of old guilt, absent
love; a moment from deep in our childhood
that we spend our waking lives perpetually
forgetting.
But 1 at least figured I had the common
badass nobility to hold off the tears until the
very end of the session, like Tony Soprano:
DARREN: (nodding resolutely) Well. I
guess that solves my brain. Thank you. Peer
Counselor, we've set all aright and there's no
need to dig any deeper.
PEER C OUNSELOR: (takes off glasses)
Darren, what about the geese?
DARREN: The geese ... of course ... they
symbolize all the sadness I've repressed
below my chiseled image (a lone tear falls
down his burnished cheekbones). Sorry, do
you have a tissue? I believe there's some dust
in my eye.
See? Dignity still intact, masculine resolve
reaffirmed by a minor dip into feminine emo
tionality. Instead, this is what happened:
PEER COUNSELOR: So. what do you
want to talk about?
DARREN: Well, it's like, y'see — (de
scends into loud.uncontrollable whimpering,
punctuated by occasional meaningless word
vomit for the next half hour)
1 didn't even get a full sentence in. and
BAM. I'm a four-year-old with an owchie and
wah. wall. wah. snort.
I can count on one hand how many times
I've told anyone how sad I can get. partially
because I'm never sad when I'm talking to
someone — a friend, a stranger, a waitress,
anyone who can validate my existence —
and partially because I 'm embarrassed by my
own sadness. Depression is so selfish, self
loathing. so boring.There are so many better
things to hate in this world, so much that's far
more depressing than a lack of direction, an
inability to connect with people, your poor

sex life, whatever. When I've been at a really
had low point — midway through last quar
ter. fall of junior year, fifth grade — it's al
ways because 1 can't find the strength to ex
cavate my head out of my ass and engage in
the wide world outside me. I feel like the only
thing on other people's minds is me and my
idiot tailings. Sadness is an existential god
complex.
Even writing about it like this feels silly
and solipsistic. Woe is me, alas for youth, oh
won t someone hug this poor, beleaguered,
upper-middle-class white male private
schooled suburban fratboy Stanford stu
dent'.' But here it is: I went to the Bridge last
quarter in the middle of what should have
been the happiest week of my life. Suffice it
to say. there were banners in White Plaza,
Facebook groups, adorably hot sophomore
sorority girls insisting 1 was a hero, ASSU
slates begging me for an endorsement and
well-paid pricks with esoteric job titles telling
me I had bad manners. People I hadn't talked
to in years were emailing me;people I didn't
know knew me. By all rights. I should have
felt amazing.
I was crying in the shower, which is the
funniest thing in the world because it's so far
beyond sad into pitiful.
What makes it all so strange is not that no
body noticed, but that 1 actively refused to let
them notice. Even making vague implica
tions about my sadness made me feel selfish,
weak and pretentious — and I hate feeling
weak. So instead it got to the point where I
felt myself perched woozily on the edge of
tears, a slight wind change from exploding
outwards in the most embarrassing display of
masculine emotion since Paul Walker tried
changing expressions. It was like a gigantic
cut oozing pus that I kept hiding until black
gangrene covered me like a manic depressive
chrysalis. / don't know what you're talking
about, it's just a scratch. No, YO U go see a doc
tor, asshole.
I was lonely, but that's not an explanation.
I was by myself for six weeks last summer and
felt nothing but an urge to escape into my
journals and a far stronger, unrequited urge
to screw a tan.starving-skinny Hungarian girl
in various cinematic positions. I never woke

up wanting the day to be over so I eould go
hack to sleep, likutl did now. I felt further
away from the people 1 loved than I did in
nine months of living in Europe. I felt de
tached from humanity, my only solitude an
empty can of Mr. Pibh with a carb on the side
and the loneliest video game ever invented.
Shadow of the Colossus. I wasn't even play
ing: I was just riding around the empty digital
world, going to the edge of the island, and
staring at the beach. That, my friends, is com
ically sad: I was so lazy. I couldn't even stare
existentially at a REAL beach.
I'm not writing this because I feel like I
need help, because I think my sadness is par
ticularly interesting or profound, or because
I like the idea of random people pointing to
me and saying,"Look at that sad dude! Hey
Saddy. why don't you cry about it. Saddy Mc-
Sadderson!" I felt better. I finished the quar
ter and I went jet skiing in Cabo. (1 also had a
panic attack, but I'm pretty sure that was the
sleep deprivation, the alcohol provision and
the Buffalo wings.) I require no anti-depres
sants beyond sunlight and bikinis. I tend to
think of myself as one of the cheeriest people
I know.
But I think that I experienced a particu
larly Stanford form of depression: I got so
wrapped up in everything that I felt attached
to nothing, so concerned with filling up my
time that 1 felt paranoid about losing every
moment. We're starting the happiest quarter
of the year; it's easy to think that all of this
particularly bleak winter quarter was a casu
al nightmare, that all we needed was the bare
whiff of summer weather to cheer us up. And
that's partially true: There's a reason why
Californians are happy and Russians are
Russians. But it's so easy to hide yourself
from yourself because someone else might
notice, particularly if you're a guy who
geeked out through high school and came
here with the decisive plan to become some
one better. It's even easier to feel like sadness
is a weakness, and Stanford kids know about
hiding weakness, feeding the elephant in the
room until it bursts its bloated esophagus.
Sadness isn't a weakness, though. It's what
makes us strong. A life of pure joy is a bland
slice of eternal boredom. We could all use a
good cry sometimes. But it's just cowardice to
hide from your friends, to cry into a pillow
and assume you'll feel better eventually.
Odds are, they're doing the same thing.
