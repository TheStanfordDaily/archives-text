# Caterpillars invade Farm
## 
### 
As students returned to campus tor
spring quarter, they were greeted by
swarms of fuzzy caterpillars. The insects,
which hang from trees and on plants all
around campus, have been exceptionally
noticeable on campus in recent years.
The green creatures invading the cam
pus are larvae (hat hatch in February and
position themselves in trees to prepare for
the next stage in their lives ITiev will soon

form cocoons, and come June, the insects
will hatch once again as moths, most likely
tussock moths.
Despite Stanford's generally environmen
tal! > -friendly attitude.students overwhelm
ingly dislike the presence of the caterpillars
on campus. Last year, many students went
so far as to join Facebook groups denounc
ing llie insects' arrival, and similar senti
ments were expressed Monday.
