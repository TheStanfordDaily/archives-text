# Study: Calif. schools need big overhaul
## Researcher calls for changed funding system 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The "irrational and complex" k 12
school system is failing millions of Cal
ifornia's students.That is, according to
a Stanford-sponsored study, until the
way schools are funded and managed
is completely revamped.
A recent report from the Stanford
Institute for Research on Education
Policy cV: Practice (IREPP), a group
led by Education Associate Prof. Su
sanna 1 oeb. indicated that the struc
tural problems inherent in the finance
and government system of California
schools are so entrenched that only a
large-scale commitment to change is
likely to have any effect.
" Ihe conclusion of the report is
that ( alifornia is in real trouble." 1 .oeb
said. She explained that California stu
dents are neither "performing well rel
ative to other states" nor "learning
what they need to learn to be success
ful later on in the labor market."
I.oeb said that one of the biggest
problems with the state's education
system is inequity in the way money
uets distributed to schools.

"The finance system |is| irrational
in that very similar districts receive
quite different dollars per pupil and
the differences across districts are not
treated coherently," she said in an
email to Hie I )aily."We are aiming for
students in poverty to have similar
achievements to the current achieve
ments of students from high-income
families."
"Getting Down to Facts" aggre
gates 22 studies conducted by 32 insti
tutions over an 18-month period from
September 2(X)5 to March 2(X)7. ITie
report was designed to analyze the
state of California's school finance
and governance systems and the ex
tent to which additional resources are
necessary for California's students to
meet expected levels of success.
Though the report did not make
specific policy recommendations, ii
did identify four major areas for im
provement that could provide short
term results. I lowever. I .oeb said."po
litically, they may not be easy to imple
ment."
flie first called for giving local ad
ministrators more autonomy by relax
ing restrictions and rules. Ihe second
focused on changing the way teachers
are hired, paid and fired — suggesting
that administrators should have
"more flexibility to dismiss teachers
who [aren't] effective."
The nonpartisan approach of
"Getting Down to 112 acts" allowed the
report to "provide information to
CCalifornia so that we could get a com
mon understanding from which to
move forward and create a better pol
icy." according to I .och.
The studies — which were re
leased March 14 and 15 — provoked
reactions from the politicians who
commissioned them.
California State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell
released a statement emphasizing the
importance of a "holistic approach"
to improving the school system, as op
posed to "piecemeal reform." (iover
nor Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, em
phasized the need to "focus on critical
school reform before discussion
about any more resources."
According to the Web site Califor
niaprogressreport.com, a self-de
scribed progressive discussion forum,
the results of "Getting Down to

year's budget and educational poli
cies. since the state's budget must be
adopted in the next three months.
