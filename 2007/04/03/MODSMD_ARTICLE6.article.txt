## Poll stresses deliberation Prof pushes innovative method, more information

The Center for Deliberative
Democracy (CDD), whose interac
tive Deliberative Polling process is
the brainchild of Communications
Prof. James Fishkin, aims to give citi
zens around the globe an informed
voice in governmental decisions.
Deliberative polling brings togeth
er a ranch >m sample of people wh( > are
then educated about an important
issue, before discussing and voting on
it. The innovative polling technique is
markedly different than the tradition
al method of using randomly-selected

poll participants who are often unin
formed on the relevant issues.
According to the CDD Web site,
the new method leads to more in
formed and accurate polls.
" Ilie resulting changes in opin
ion represent the conclusions the
public would reach, il people had op
portunity to become more informed
and more engaged by the issues," the
Web site said.
I ishkin conceived the idea for De
liberative polling during a fellowship
at the University in I ( )87. before
bringing ("DD to its permanent home
at McClatchy I (all in 2003.
"Every other poll shows what the
public thinks when it's not thinking,"
Fishkin said. "This shows what it
thinks when it is thinkinc."
A deliberative poll's randomly-se
lected participants spend two or three
days gathering information from
briefing materials and experts on the
issue. During this time, participants
engage in small-group discussions to
talk about the issue. Only after this di
alogue is complete are surveys finally
taken tor use by policymakers.
Deliberative polling has had a
worldwide influence. Texas' focus on
renewable energy can be traced in
part to a deliberative poll conducted
by energy utilities in 1997 and 1998. A
deliberative poll was conducted in a
town in China to determine priorities
for the town's public works budget.
Party officials believed the public
would want improved transporta
tion; instead the poll identified
sewage and water treatment as the
citizens' priorities.
On its Web site, the CDD quotes
journalists, researchers and former
Vice President A 1 Gore on the bene
fits of applying deliberative polling.

the most important of which, they
argue, are improved citizen-govern
mental communication.
The system is not without its criti
cisms. however. "A Different Take on
the Deliberative Poll." a 2005 paper
published in 'Public Opinion Quar
terly," an Oxford public policy jour
nal. claimed that the deliberative
poll's improvement in consistency of
opinion is temporary and not always
replicable between different polls.
"While some polls appeared to
show a rather strong and consistent
pattern that confirmed the expecta
tion that statistical associations be
tween items would increase after de
liberation. others have showed no
change at all. and others still showed
a downward movement," according
to the paper.
Still, Fishkin is enthusiastic
about the prospects of applying his
system to democracies around the
world.
"Critics say the public is not com
petent." he said."We find it is (compe
tent!, just disengaged."
