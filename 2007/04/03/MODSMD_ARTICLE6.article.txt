Democracy (CDD), whose interac
tive Deliberative Polling process is
the brainchild of Communications
Prof. James Fishkin, aims to give citi
zens around the globe an informed
voice in governmental decisions.
Deliberative polling brings togeth
er a ranch >m sample of people wh( > are
then educated about an important
issue, before discussing and voting on
it. The innovative polling technique is
markedly different than the tradition
al method of using randomly-selected

poll participants who are often unin
formed on the relevant issues.
According to the CDD Web site,
the new method leads to more in
formed and accurate polls.
" Ilie resulting changes in opin
ion represent the conclusions the
public would reach, il people had op
portunity to become more informed
and more engaged by the issues," the
Web site said.

liberative polling during a fellowship
at the University in I ( )87. before
bringing ("DD to its permanent home
at McClatchy I (all in 2003.
"Every other poll shows what the
public thinks when it's not thinking,"
Fishkin said. "This shows what it
thinks when it is thinkinc."
