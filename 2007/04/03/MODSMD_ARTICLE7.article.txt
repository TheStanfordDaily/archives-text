### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Global Climate and Knergv Project
(CICIP) is expanding its research programs yet
again, with a $15 million award for new energy re
search. The awards will he distributed among
eight research programs and five one year ex
ploratory research efforts at Stanford and other
universities worldwide.
(1( 'I ' P brings scientific and engineering com
munities together at Stanford to develop global
energy solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emis
sions. When the program started in December
2(K)2. the four major sponsors (II .Toyota,
ExxonMobil and Schlumherger pledged to
invest $225 million over a decade.
According to CiCHP Director 112 ranklin M.
()rr Jr..the recipients of the recent award will fur
ther diversify the program's researchers and
projects.
"Tliis set of awards will increase substantially
the number of investigatois from leading re
search institutions worldwide who will con
tribute their expertise to (it I Pas we work to lay
the foundations for new energy technologies." he
said in a Onivcrsity press release. "These new
awards will expand the scope of (it I P research
activities to cover coal and transportation, two
areas where development of low
greenhouse gas emissions is vital."
Other areas of research will include
solar energy and advanced materials
and catalysts.
Stanford faculty members will lead
four of the new projects, working in
conjunction with researchers from
Harvard, Brigham Young University
and the University of Utah. More re
search will take place at the California
Institute of Technology, Sweden's Up
psala University and France's Univer
sity of Picardie Jules Verne.
GCEP pledged seed funding of
$100,000 to each of the one-year ex
ploratory research efforts, the majori
ty of which will take place at Stanford
with the aid of Boise State University
researchers.
"Adding these programs to the
GCEP research portfolio is an impor
tant step forward for the project." said
