## Captain Kegger and the Raging Alchies 
### 
It's become the mantra of college students na
tionwide-from the keg-standing frat boys at
the wildest state schools to the appletini-sip
ping snobs of the Ivies — and its profundity grows
with each utterance.
"Hey. we remind each other:" You're not an al
coholic 'til you graduate."
And technically-according to the Stanford lex
icon. anyway — you're not. Every time tequila
makes your clothes fall off. your friends can just
smile and shake their heads. You're not an alco
holic: you're an alchy.
As we know all too well, Stanford students love
to abbreve. Whether you're on your way to Mem-
Chu. FloMo, or the CoHo, a breezy two-syllable
term likely exists to describe your destination.
And however much critics of this Stanford code
complain, these abbreviations do contribute to life
on the Farm. After all. they are one of many tradi
tions— Tree Week, the Wacky Walk, and. of
course. FMOTQ — that contribute to our quirky
campus identity.
But is this truly the sum of their importance?
Mv old high school was notorious for the eatinu

disorders that ravaged its all-female student body.
Yet, as teenagers more concerned with how flat
our (dress code-violating) bare midriffs appeared,
we couldn't care less about our health.The abbre
viation "rex" — for anorexic — began to circu
late. "Ohmigod," my friends and 1 would whisper
to each other, hall in disgust, half in envy."That girl
is totally rex."
Historical linguistics teaches that the creation
of a new word is rarely insignificant. Like "rex."
the birth of "alchy" is no exception. Its rise to
prominence has provided us with an alternative to
its scarier, more serious original. Essentially, the
meaning of "alchy" has evolved far beyond that of
its progenitor: Unlike "alcoholic" which conno
tates a struggle with a crippling disease, alchies
partake in excessively heavy drinking as if it were
an enjoyable — but harmless — hobby. ITie ab
breviated form removes all implications of de
pendence, obsession, abuse or depression.
This is not to say that Stanford, or any other
school, is facing an epidemic of alcoholism, clever
ly concealed by a playful abbreviation. Yet this se
mantic shift is not entirely innocuous. As the rise of

"rex" reflected our warped body images, social ac
ceptance of "alchies" may he a reflection of our
changing mores, an increasing acceptance of a cul
ture of alcohol.
Five hundred years ago. the word "knave"
meant only "servant." But. as attitudes toward the
lower classes became increasingly negative, so did
the word's meaning. It is now used to describe
someone of low character, one who is dishonorable
and deceitful. Similarly, the arrival of "alchy" may
indicate a change in our mindset — and just how
numb we've become to the excesses of college life.

April 2,1990:
Two and a half hours after
winning their 32nd game of the
season, the Stanford women's bas
ketball team was on a bus bund
for Oak Edge, a town of 29.000 in
East Tennessee. They were al
ready in good sprits when Aretha
Franklin's "Respect" began to
play on the radio.
Suddenly, the Cardinal 11
jumped up and burst into song. At
maximum volume they sang along
with Aretha as she belted out "All
I want - is just a little respect. Just
a little bit. Just a little bit."
Like Rodney Dangerfield,
Aretha will probably be making
her request for time immemorial.
After winning their 101st game in
four years yesterday in front of a
record crowd of over 20.000 —
and, incidentally, the first national
championship yesterday — the
Stanford women need not ask for
it any longer.
To think that four years ago
women's basketball at Stanford
was little more than a curiosity.
