Much has been discussed about how students are losing interest in science education
as they grow older and move farther along in the K-12 educational system. But there
is little agreement about what is needed on improving science education in the
United States. Should children learn how to engage in science through active partic
ipation, in ways that encourage learning the "whats" and "hows" of the scientific
process? Or instead, should teachers go "back to basics" with a more traditional
approach that emphasizes vocabulary and memorizing scientific facts? Don Kennedy,
Stanford President Emeritus and editor-in-chief of Science, will explore how scientists
are thinking about K-12 science teaching—and why scientific insights about how
the human brain might connect to learning have been disappointing. Part of the
discussion will focus on the critics of science teaching, with some attention to the
increasing efforts by Christian conservatives to challenge the teaching of evolution
in public schools.
