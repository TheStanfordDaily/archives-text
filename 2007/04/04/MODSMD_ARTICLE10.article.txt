# SPELL CHECK
## 'Tressider' or 'Tresidder'? Setting the record straight. 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Despite claims of grade inflation,
there's one area in which students might
receive a failing score: spelling. No, not
the kinds of words Spell Check catches,
hut words students use in their everyday
lives as Stanford students.
1 informally polled 70 students on
these five commonly misspelled names
and only two were successful in every
word they tried. On average, students'
performance was a mere 33.9 percent
— imagine receiving that score on a
final exam!
But who can blame them? It seems

that students are confused for good rea
son. as misspellings circulate widely
around campus to send mixed mes
sages. After looking at these mis
spellings so much, even I was having
doubts.
A problem set from the Humßio
core last quarter — a class that en
rolled nearly 300 students — was enti
tled "Once Upon a Time in Cubberly."
(Yes. 'Cubberly' without the extra
"e.")
In a search of the deleted items in my
email inbox (very scientific. I know), I
found 45 instances of "Tressider" dating
back to September 200b. and 107 emails
that spelled the building's name correct-

Tresidder: Two I)'s, One S
At the center of campus, Tresidder Memorial Union contains "almost every
amenity imaginable in order to meet the needs of campus inhabitants and members
of the surrounding community," according to its Web site. The building serves as a
central hub and meeting area for many students, yet why is it so hard to spell?
Only 23 ot th 65 students who attempted to spell "Tresidder" did so correctly, a
35.4 percent success rate.The most popular wrong response was "Tressider," which
garnered 47.7 percent of responses. Multiple students also spelled the building
"Tressidor (4.6 percent) and "Tresider" (3.1 percent).
One out of 10 students in Tresidder while taking the test was successful in spelling
the name of the building where they were sitting, which is named after Donald B.
Tresidder'l9, the president of the University from 1943 to 1948.
The Daily's style guide offers this mnemonic: "Remember when spelling Tresid
der there is one V for Stanford and two 'd's' for Donald."
Arrillaga: Two R\Two L's
The Arrillaga name seems to be all over buildings on campus.The Arrillaga Cen
ter for Sports and Recreation and the Arrillaga Family Sports Center are both
named for University donor John Arrillaga, and the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center is named for his wife.
Yet just over one-third of students (33.8 percent, or 23 of 68) could spell his last
name correctly. "Arillaga" was the most popular wrong response, garnering almost
half (42.6 percent) of the responses. Others included "Ariaga," "Arrigala," "Arillia
ga" and even "Arrelligella."
Hennessy • Without the E Before the Y
Dr. John 1.. Hennessy has been on Stanford's faculty since 1977 and has served as
president since 20(H). but it seems students still can't manage to spell his last name
right.
One-third of students (21 of 63) spelled his name right, a clear minority. Twenty
(31.7 percent) wrote "Hennessey." including a final "e," with the rest providing ver
sions varying the numbers of n's,s's. and e's.
One student started writing his last name, getting down the first few letters, but
then crossed it out and simply wrote "John H."
Cubberley • With the E Before the Y
1 know how Cubberley Auditorium, located in the education building, must feel.
My name, too. is commonly misspelled when the "e" between the "1" and the "y" is
forgotten.
Cubberley was named forthe School ofEducation's first dean, Ellwood Patter
son Cubberley.His namewas the one withthe lowest success rate among the students
I polled. Only 20 of the 63 students (31.7 percent) who attempted to spell "Cubber-

ly — a mere 2.4:1 ratio.
And The Daily isn't immune either.
Searching The Daily's online archives
— which date back to 1998 — for the in
correctly spelled "Tressider" yields 31
articles. Similarly, 35 articles contain
"Cubberly," 33 contain "Hennessey,"
and 12 contain "Arillaga."This is a con
siderable number, as at least four stu
dents read each article after it is submit
ted, and The Daily's style guide —
though admittedly outdated — con
tains each of the items in this feature ex
cept Hennessy.
So here's the final word on these
spellings. After looking at this page, you
have no excuses.

"On average, students'
performance was a mere
33.9 percent."

ley" did so correctly, with the vast majority (65.1 percent) spelling it without the
extra "e." Four of 14 students seated in Cubberley while filling out their survey
spelled it incorrectly. Many students, when told the correct spelling of the auditori
um, were in disbelief that there was an "e" before the "y."
Mirrielees: Just Memorize It
Mirrielees. an upperclass residence where 435 students live in apartment-style
housing, was named after Stanford student and faculty member Edith Mirrielees,
who graduated in 1907.
This word drew the most varied responses. While a similar proportion of students
got the buildings spelling correct (35.4 percent, or 17 of 48), almost no misspellings
were repeated.
Of 31 students who spelled "Mirrielees" wrong, there were 23 distinct responses,
ranging from "Meralies" to "Mierllies," "Mireles" to "Mirrorlees."
One student realized my survey was a spelling test and tried writing out "Mir
rielees" three different ways on the back of her test. (She still spelled it wrong.)
