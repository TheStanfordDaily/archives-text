My data collection for this feature was in no way the simple random sam
ple mandated by the AP Statistics class I took in high school, and should not
be taken as such.The sample was admittedly skewed toward undergraduates
(61 respondents reported undergraduate status, while only seven were grad
uate students), students in my classes and students I arbitrarily ran into
around campus.The small sample also should not be taken as representative
of the student population at large. I handed out surveys with questions such
as "Who is the president of Stanford?" to get students to write in his last name.
Some students, particularly graduate students, did not know the answers to
my questions and therefore did not get a chance to attempt to spell the words.
