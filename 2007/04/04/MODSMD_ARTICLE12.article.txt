## Editorial Board Stanford's unassuming press should press on 
### 
For an organization that claims its mis
sion is to "extend and challenge prevail
ing views in the academy and society,
and thereby explain and illuminate the
human condition" the Stanford University
Press keeps a low profile. It may be no sweat
off the back of the average student that SUP
doesn't publish the kind of books most peo
ple would skim over coffee at Moonbeam's
(few college presses do), but there's little
doubt that Stanford's press is underrepre
sented on library bookshelves. Stanford Uni
versity Press is not the press that Stanford
University ought to have.
The deficiencies of Stanford's press are
most apparent in the number of new books
it produces annually. SUP published 140 ti
tles in 2007, while the University of Chicago
Press manages to average nearly twice that
amount at 250 books per year. Both of these
presses are overshadowed by giants like
Cambridge University Press — founded in
1534— which publishes around 12(H) aca
demic titles and 200 journals every year.
Several factors should be considered
when investigating SUP's low profile. Geof
frey Burn, director of SUP,cites the Univer
sity's newcomer status to the publishing
scene as a major reason for its relatively low
output. While the Web site traces the history
of the press back to 1892. when "the first
work of scholarship bearing the Stanford
name appeared." Burn sets the founding
date for SUP as 1925. Only three of the US
News & World Report's top 19-ranked
schools established their presses later. Burns
says he believes that a college press entering
the field late faces the triple threat of lower
academic cache, lower cash flows for large

royalties and advances and an uphill market
ing battle.
Despite these difficulties, Stanford Uni
versity Press has carved out a niche for itself
in the humanities, where it cultivates its pri
mary book list. Over the last five years, SUP's
new lists have grown by 120 percent, accord
ing to Burns, who said this increase comes
while the press maintains a high level of qual
ity control in its editorial process — 80 per
cent of manuscripts are rejected outright.The
quality of SUP's publications is also reflected
in the number of awards received. Between
2(X)2 and 2005, the press earned 01 awards. In
the previous four years, the publisher had re
ceived 55.
While the progress that has been made by
SUP is commendable, the disconnect that
remains between the research produced at
Stanford, the libraries that support and dis
seminate that research and the Press that ex
ists to publish the research remains a glaring
problem. According to the SUP's Web site,
two thirds of the books published are in the
humanities and the social sciences. The re
maining third are textbooks, professional
reference works and monographs in fields
like law. business and economics.The pauci
ty of work relating to engineering, natural
sciences, computer science and medicine —
fields where the University is a global leader
— is unfortunate.
It would be unfair to compare Stanford's
press to that of an ancient industry titan like
Cambridge. But given the fact that our en
dowment and general reputation have sur
passed those of much older universities, it is
only fitting that our press be given the re
sources to catch up as well.
