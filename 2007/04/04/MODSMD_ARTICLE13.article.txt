# The
						apathy of defeat
## 
### 
Every time I went to my childhood
dentist. I was assaulted by a laminat
ed poster proclaiming: "If you can
dream it,you can achieve it!" Maybe it was
the warts on the dental hygienist's fingers,
the saccharine stench of that grainy bubble
gum tooth cleanser or my baseless but
abiding suspicion that two-thirds of den
tists are potential registered sex offenders
(if I had a hydraulic chair. 1 know what I'd
use it for), but the phrase always provoked
certain ire in me.TTie nauseating optimism,
the bulky slant rhyme â€” all in all. a more
than moderately insipid phrase.
"If you can dream it," I quipped through
frothy lips, "then good for you. buddy." The
hygienist would smile deafly, then shove the
saliva vacuum back into my prepubescent
smirk.
In spite of this lack of positive reinforce
ment. for some reason this perversion of the
phrase got stuck in my arsenal of personal
maxims. Sure, you can dream it. but then
what? It makes sense: some ambitions just
aren't meant to be realized. I low many one
eyed basketball players do you know?
Yeah, bucko, just try dreaming up some
depth perception. That kid you tutored in
English who could barely string five words
together isn't going to win a Pulitzer any
time soon, a 95-year-old tobacco manufac

turer living in Alabama isn't going to walk
on the moon.and tone-deaf high-school kat
certainly didn't win a leading role in her sen
ior year production of "Little Shop of 1 lor
rors."
Suck it up. buttercup, and get on with
your life. Or so I reasoned.
As the years rolled on. this adage contin
ued to reverberate in my mind with ever
more caustic incarnations. During the first
few years of college, I watched some of the
few high school friends with whom I contin
ued talking gradually sacrifice their own
dreams.
"Maybe my passion is Studio Art right
now. but I'm sure I'll grow to love Econom
ics."
"Why go to Harvard when the Univer
sity of Arizona is so much cheaper?"
