# The 						apathy of defeat
## 
### 
Every time I went to my childhood
dentist. I was assaulted by a laminat
ed poster proclaiming: "If you can
dream it,you can achieve it!" Maybe it was
the warts on the dental hygienist's fingers,
the saccharine stench of that grainy bubble
gum tooth cleanser or my baseless but
abiding suspicion that two-thirds of den
tists are potential registered sex offenders
(if I had a hydraulic chair. 1 know what I'd
use it for), but the phrase always provoked
certain ire in me.TTie nauseating optimism,
the bulky slant rhyme — all in all. a more
than moderately insipid phrase.
"If you can dream it," I quipped through
frothy lips, "then good for you. buddy." The
hygienist would smile deafly, then shove the
saliva vacuum back into my prepubescent
smirk.
In spite of this lack of positive reinforce
ment. for some reason this perversion of the
phrase got stuck in my arsenal of personal
maxims. Sure, you can dream it. but then
what? It makes sense: some ambitions just
aren't meant to be realized. I low many one
eyed basketball players do you know?
Yeah, bucko, just try dreaming up some
depth perception. That kid you tutored in
English who could barely string five words
together isn't going to win a Pulitzer any
time soon, a 95-year-old tobacco manufac

turer living in Alabama isn't going to walk
on the moon.and tone-deaf high-school kat
certainly didn't win a leading role in her sen
ior year production of "Little Shop of 1 lor
rors."
Suck it up. buttercup, and get on with
your life. Or so I reasoned.
As the years rolled on. this adage contin
ued to reverberate in my mind with ever
more caustic incarnations. During the first
few years of college, I watched some of the
few high school friends with whom I contin
ued talking gradually sacrifice their own
dreams.
"Maybe my passion is Studio Art right
now. but I'm sure I'll grow to love Econom
ics."
"Why go to Harvard when the Univer
sity of Arizona is so much cheaper?"

"My new husband thinks 1 should
drop out and have a baby. He's prob
ably right. I*ll go back to school
later."
I saw, okay, not the best minds of
my generation, but some pretty red
hot ones cast aside their most cher
ished ambitions because they took a
backseat to reality. But that's okay.
They were just the desires that
weren't meant to be. If you can
dream it, so what, right?
Children live in a fantasy world,
but we're adults now, and we're not
just preparing for real life — we're
already in it. If you can dream it. then
maybe you have just a little too
much time on your hands and should
start working, for a change.
Especially at Stanford, this cyni
cal incarnation of that pesky adage
seems to make sense: everyone here
is brilliant, inspired, paddling like
the dickens under the surface while
you can barely support your own
weight. You can't waste your time
grappling with daydreams when re
ality barrels around every corner
throwing punches.
During my first years at Stanford,

the dream I fought for all through
high school dwindled down to a
mere notion: I arrived here an eager
young freshman, determined to
major in Slavic Languages and Lit
eratures for virtually no reason. For
two years, I took classes, attended
lectures by visiting professors, and
every single week convinced my par
ents that, yes, this was the path I
wanted to take, while the whole time
I grew less and less sure of what that
path even entailed. One day, a good
friend asked me what I loved about
my major and 1 really thought about
it — it was like waking up in bed,
rolling over and realizing you don't
even know the person you're sleep
ing next to. I was so caught up in slav
ing away for my ambitions that 1 did
n't stop to reevaluate them at every
step; instead of making conscious
decisions about my journey, 1 picked
one destination and just kept trudg
ing on toward it.
Fortunately, after living in Moscow
for three months, it became clear
that my decision was a good one. but
this was a mere matter of chance. 1
had become so cynical toward
dreams, so paranoid about attempt
ing the impossible, that 1 completely
stopped challenging my limitations.
In an environment as competi
tive as Stanford, and hovering as
close as we are to the dreaded "real

world." 1 think it's easy to make this
mistake: to convince yourself that
the path of least resistance is your
heart's desire, to confuse enjoying
being good at something with actual
ly enjoying it. If it isn't as thrilling as
finding actual satisfaction, at least it
is safer, and if you keep yourself
busy, you won't notice the differ
ence.
1 still don't believe that if you can
dream it, you can achieve it, but
maybe my creepy dentist was on to
something after all. If you can dream
it, then you should dream it and then
think realistically about attempting
it. Maybe some dreams really aren't
meant to be (sorry one-eyed NBA
hopefuls), but many are worth at
tempting.
1, for example, have finally ac
cepted that my tone-deaf self will
never appear in a musical in any role
other than "captive audience mem
ber," but I've started seriously scour
ing major airline companies for one
way tickets to Russia. It's not the
most pragmatic post-graduation
plan, but maybe it's time to start sac
rificing safety for fantasy and not the
other way around.

As the years rolled on. this adage contin
ued to reverberate in my mind with ever
more caustic incarnations. During the first
few years of college, I watched some of the
few high school friends with whom I contin
ued talking gradually sacrifice their own
dreams.
"Maybe my passion is Studio Art right
now. but I'm sure I'll grow to love Econom
ics."
"Why go to Harvard when the Univer
sity of Arizona is so much cheaper?"

"My new husband thinks 1 should
drop out and have a baby. He's prob
ably right. I*ll go back to school
later."
I saw, okay, not the best minds of
my generation, but some pretty red
hot ones cast aside their most cher
ished ambitions because they took a
backseat to reality. But that's okay.
They were just the desires that
weren't meant to be. If you can
dream it, so what, right?
Children live in a fantasy world,
but we're adults now, and we're not
just preparing for real life — we're
already in it. If you can dream it. then
maybe you have just a little too
much time on your hands and should
start working, for a change.
Especially at Stanford, this cyni
cal incarnation of that pesky adage
seems to make sense: everyone here
is brilliant, inspired, paddling like
the dickens under the surface while
you can barely support your own
weight. You can't waste your time
grappling with daydreams when re
ality barrels around every corner
throwing punches.
During my first years at Stanford,

the dream I fought for all through
high school dwindled down to a
mere notion: I arrived here an eager
young freshman, determined to
major in Slavic Languages and Lit
eratures for virtually no reason. For
two years, I took classes, attended
lectures by visiting professors, and
every single week convinced my par
ents that, yes, this was the path I
wanted to take, while the whole time
I grew less and less sure of what that
path even entailed. One day, a good
friend asked me what I loved about
my major and 1 really thought about
it — it was like waking up in bed,
rolling over and realizing you don't
even know the person you're sleep
ing next to. I was so caught up in slav
ing away for my ambitions that 1 did
n't stop to reevaluate them at every
step; instead of making conscious
decisions about my journey, 1 picked
one destination and just kept trudg
ing on toward it.
Fortunately, after living in Moscow
for three months, it became clear
that my decision was a good one. but
this was a mere matter of chance. 1
had become so cynical toward
dreams, so paranoid about attempt
ing the impossible, that 1 completely
stopped challenging my limitations.
In an environment as competi
tive as Stanford, and hovering as
close as we are to the dreaded "real

world." 1 think it's easy to make this
mistake: to convince yourself that
the path of least resistance is your
heart's desire, to confuse enjoying
being good at something with actual
ly enjoying it. If it isn't as thrilling as
finding actual satisfaction, at least it
is safer, and if you keep yourself
busy, you won't notice the differ
ence.
1 still don't believe that if you can
dream it, you can achieve it, but
maybe my creepy dentist was on to
something after all. If you can dream
it, then you should dream it and then
think realistically about attempting
it. Maybe some dreams really aren't
meant to be (sorry one-eyed NBA
hopefuls), but many are worth at
tempting.
1, for example, have finally ac
cepted that my tone-deaf self will
never appear in a musical in any role
other than "captive audience mem
ber," but I've started seriously scour
ing major airline companies for one
way tickets to Russia. It's not the
most pragmatic post-graduation
plan, but maybe it's time to start sac
rificing safety for fantasy and not the
other way around.

Kat's current most cherished desire is
that you will email her about this col
umn. If it's not not meant to be, drop
