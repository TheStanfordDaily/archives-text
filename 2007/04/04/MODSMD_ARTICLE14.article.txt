## Understanding financial aid 
### KAREN COOPER 
You may have read last quarter about
Stanford's enhancements to student finan
cial aid. Because the calculations used to ar
rive at financial aid on both an aggregate
and personal level tend to be complicated,
the real story may have been hard to dis
cern.
The bottom line is that Stanford's institu
tional need-based scholarship funding is
being increased 15.2 percent, and that is
truly good news for students and their fam
ilies. My staff and I will have the pleasure of
dispensing $76 million of funds in under
graduate financial aid in the upcoming aca
demic year, compared with $66 million dur
ing the current year.
But what 1 hope students really glean
from the announcements is that Stanford's
financial aid program is among the most
generous nationwide. Its objectives are de
signed to reflect values we can all support
and be proud of. Let me explain.
First, Stanford remains one of the very
few universities in the nation that is "need
blind." meaning that US. citizens and per

manent residents are admitted without re
gard to their ability to pay. The university
then meets the full need of all students who
qualify for aid.
Second, our program recognizes that
there is a population of students nationwide
who are prepared for college, hut who are
not going for financial reasons. The trend is
documented in a new book called "Ameri
ca's Untapped Resource." The authors
argue that low-income students well pre
pared for college attend at rates lower than
higher-income students who are less pre
pared. This, very simply, is poor public poli
cy. As Jane Stanford said at the university's
inception. Stanford should keep "open an
avenue whereby the deserving and excep
tional may rise through their own efforts."
New financial aid policies at Stanford
have come in two separate, but related an
nouncements. First, we announced last year
that parents with incomes below $45,(KK)
per year would not be expected to con
tribute to educational costs. We also signifi
cantly reduced the expectation for families
