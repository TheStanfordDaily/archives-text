## Understanding financial aid 
### KAREN COOPER 
You may have read last quarter about
Stanford's enhancements to student finan
cial aid. Because the calculations used to ar
rive at financial aid on both an aggregate
and personal level tend to be complicated,
the real story may have been hard to dis
cern.
The bottom line is that Stanford's institu
tional need-based scholarship funding is
being increased 15.2 percent, and that is
truly good news for students and their fam
ilies. My staff and I will have the pleasure of
dispensing $76 million of funds in under
graduate financial aid in the upcoming aca
demic year, compared with $66 million dur
ing the current year.
But what 1 hope students really glean
from the announcements is that Stanford's
financial aid program is among the most
generous nationwide. Its objectives are de
signed to reflect values we can all support
and be proud of. Let me explain.
First, Stanford remains one of the very
few universities in the nation that is "need
blind." meaning that US. citizens and per

manent residents are admitted without re
gard to their ability to pay. The university
then meets the full need of all students who
qualify for aid.
Second, our program recognizes that
there is a population of students nationwide
who are prepared for college, hut who are
not going for financial reasons. The trend is
documented in a new book called "Ameri
ca's Untapped Resource." The authors
argue that low-income students well pre
pared for college attend at rates lower than
higher-income students who are less pre
pared. This, very simply, is poor public poli
cy. As Jane Stanford said at the university's
inception. Stanford should keep "open an
avenue whereby the deserving and excep
tional may rise through their own efforts."
New financial aid policies at Stanford
have come in two separate, but related an
nouncements. First, we announced last year
that parents with incomes below $45,(KK)
per year would not be expected to con
tribute to educational costs. We also signifi
cantly reduced the expectation for families
with income between $45,000 and
$60,(XX) a year.
The second change was recently
announced in response to a survey of
parents of current students showing
that middle-income families are
struggling to pay the cost of a Stan
ford education. As a result, the uni
versity committed an additional $5
million in financial aid for the 2(X)7-
08 academic year to help ease their
burden.
The additional aid earmarked for
middle-income families will reduce
the sum parents are expected to con
tribute. It also will reduce the
amount students are expected to
borrow during the school year to
$2 .(XX) from $3,500.
Specifically, Stanford is reducing
the amount of home equity assessed
in the calculation of a parental con
tribution by capping the amount of
equity considered at 1.5 times the
family income. The policy is expect
ed to reduce parent contributions
for families with significant home

equity by, on average, $2,(X)0. An al
lowance also will he made for
renters.
To make this clearer, consider a
family of four from California with
annual income of $103,000.They pur
chased their home 15 years ago and
have accumulated $48().(XX) in equity.
Under the old policies, the parents
would have been expected to con
tribute more than $25,000, and the
student would have been expected to
borrow $3,500 annually. A scholarship
of $14,000 would have been granted
to make up the shortfall. When the
new policies are fully implemented
next fall, the expected parent contri
bution will be reduced to $22,(XX).and
the amount the student is expected to
borrow will be reduced to $2,000. To
make up the difference, the student's
scholarship will be increased to
$19.(HX). In other words, that family
would save about $5,0(X).
There are two things that make
me so confident about the strength
of our financial aid program. First,
the average four-year indebtedness
for undergraduates is only $15,758.
That is much lower than the average
for private institutions, as reported
recently by the College Board. The
average nationwide is closer to

$19,000. When 1 am talking to
prospective students. 1 explain it this
way: 'Would you rather buy a new
truck as you graduate from high
school, or do you want to borrow for
four years and — at the end — have
a Stanford degree?' And 99.2 per
cent of Stanford students pay off
their debt on time.
The second source of confidence
is that Stanford's policies are such
that a family's contribution to Stan
ford year to year increases only if the
family's resources change. This key
principle cancels out the effect of tu
ition increases for anyone on linan
cial aid.
We have not yet enrolled a class
under these new policies, but 1 can't
wait to. Already we have been ablt
to better serve about 100 students in
this year's freshman class. About 200
current students benefited from the
lowering of expectations for families
with incomes between $45,(XX) and
$60,000. It will be a pleasure to apply
these new policies to even more in
coming and continuing students.
