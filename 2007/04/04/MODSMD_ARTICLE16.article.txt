# Ode to a wayward undergraduate

The gilded bust of Alexander the Great
stands atop my armoire. gathering dust
from the passage of time.
And similarly, cobwebs have begun to
form in the nooks of my normally pristine vis
age. Crows have settled in the corners of my
eyes and left the markings of their feet.
1 feel the passage of time, the fall of the
sand in the hourglass of life. Yes, readers, I am
aging. I am withering, like a peony in a glass
vessel.
1 return my gaze to the esteem'd bust. Rs
kandar-e Maqduni.as he is known in the Per
sian lands, had lived but 33 years when he left
this earth, at the height of his territorial acqui
sition â€” an empire spanning Greece. Egypt,
and the entirety of Persia. His legions had
conquered an area of tremendous breadth, a
heretofore uncharted land of majestic splen
dor.
Wikipedia tells me that yesterday in 1598.
Sir Francis Drake, at the tender age of 41, cir

cumnavigated the globe,his ships sailing forth
into the abyss with much fortitude, his fleet
flying the glorious banner of the English
Motherland.
Yet what do I. at the much-advanc'd age
of I 4 ), have to show for my years of experi
ence? I have nothing to compare with these
great men. these noble, neo-classical pillars
holding aloft the entirety of the Western
world.
1 am but a drop in the proverbial bucket.

as they say. Alas, alack and alay! Woe to the
dire state of modern man. forced forever to
sway with the pendulum ol time. To quote
Keats."Bright star, would I were steadfast as
thou art."
Would I were as steadfast as thou art. 1
would resolutely look to a grand and splendid
future, ti I I'd with much rejoicing, and...an ap
propriate major.
Indecision lills me to the core: do 1 go the
path of the wayward fuzzy, and triumphantly
surge forth on a wave of a relatively easy
course load.or do 1 "take arms against a sea of
troubles. And by opposing,end them?" with a
techie major?
With age comes indecision, and with inde
cision comes the burden of uncertainty. And 1
must choose wisely, for college is time in
which one determines the course of the ship
of life.
