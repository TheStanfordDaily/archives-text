# It's easy when she lives downstairs
## 
### 
There are a few things I will never un
derstand in this world. I don't under
stand why cell phones make a sound
when you are trying to turn the ringer vol
ume down. I don't understand why people
pay eight figures for some color splatters
called "art" that look like a three-year-old's
finger painting. And 1 certainly don't under
stand women and relationships, although
I've been in one for nearly my entire college
career.
Despite my ineptitude, 1 have made one
conclusion after dating another Stanford
student for three years: it's easy. Seriously,
folks, never in your life will you have to put
less effort into a relationship in order to
make it work.
Let's start from the beginning. Despite
any pleas from RAs to avoid dormcest,fresh
men dorms are nothing less than brothels. By
the end of the year there are enough awk
ward hook-ups and dramatic love triangles
to fill a soap opera and there will always be a
handful of dormcestual serious relationships.
That's no surprise considering that even a
child can make an effort to spend time with
someone who lives next door. (Note to my
girlfriend: Not you, baby. 1 would have spent
time with you no matter where you lived.)
It's also no surprise that it only takes a move
across campus for many of these convenient
relationships to crumble.
For the lucky fifty percent or so that
make it past the freshman dorm, the follow
ing year can bring some dramatic changes.

Ilie once five-second walk downstairs now
might be a five-minute hike ride across cam
pus to see your significant other. Wait, so we
need to actually coordinate to have dinner
together? I don't know about this anymore.
Casual run-ins slowly disappear and the
door-king becomes your best friend. I guess
it's around this point that relationships actu
ally become serious. You no longer see each
other for twenty-three hours a day so now
you have to talk about things like "feelings"
and "emotions." A typical conversation of
mine:
Her: 1 feel so close to you.
Me: Close? You lived downstairs from
me last year and now you're across campus.
I feel farther away.
As junior year comes along there is an
other bump in the road. And by "bump" I
mean a mountain called going abroad. This
is perhaps the only time most college rela
tionships must deal with really being apart.
Some will break up and others will go into
debt paying for international phone calls.
Nonetheless, evervone will come out a little

more mature (or depressed). My few
months as a swinging college bachelor in
Santiago. Chile only taught me that I lack
what rappers call "game," otherwise known
as the ability to successfully interact with
the opposite sex.
As I could have predicted, every
thing went right back to normal as soon as
we returned to campus. In fact, that is the
best part of dating at Stanford. Regardless
of where you study abroad or run off to
every summer.you always know that sooner
or later you will be back on campus. It's the
invaluable tether that will always keep your
lover close, and relationships effortless.
I don't mean to say that conven
ience is the only way that relationships work
here. Of course all successful relationships
require things like communication, trust and
unbridled horniness. My point is that we
should enjoy it while we can. Freshman, tall
in love with the girl next door. It could be the
best thing that happens to you. But once you
walk down the aisle at graduation, get ready
for a rude awakening. (I started a trust fund
to pay for plane tickets and a web cam.)
Yup. relationships after college are
going to be unlike anything we ever experi
enced as undergrade They will almost be as
hard as my relationship after my girlfriend
reads this column.
