Sophomore Bryant Hadden competes on the high bar on Mar. 2 against the
University of Michigan. NCAA Regionals are next for the squad.
"We dropped the hall a hit on the
pommel horse," Harper said. "We
might have been a little nervous en
tering it. We just weren't our best."
Stanford bounced back and
turned in the highest total score of
the night in the still rings with a
38.150. All five Stanford athletes
scored above 9.0, with Sender lead
ing the way with a 9.750 and senior
Alex Schorsch right behind with a
9.6o.This strong performance helped
the Cardinal pull just ahead of Okla
homa entering the final routine.
But a strong closing routine by
Oklahoma on the rings was the dif
ference, as the Sooners scored two
more points than the Cardinal men
who were on the vault. Oklahoma
claimed the MPSF title for the third
consecutive year, and the narrow de
feat marks the second time this year

Oklahoma and Stanford have fin
ished 1-2 in a high-level meet. De
spite this, the team says it is just a few
correctable mistakes away from
coming out on top when it really
matters: at the NCAA Champi
onships in State College, Penn., Apr.
12-14.
"We are disappointed by the sec
ond place at MPSF," Carney said.
"But we are ready for NCAAs. We
also know how to compete under
pressure, so we are heading there
with a lot of excitement."
Stanford is still ranked among the
top five nationally in nearly every
statistical category, and has per
formed well under pressure, posting
big wins earlier in the year over
Michigan and Penn State.
"We know when we execute good
routines and we hit. we are as good as
any team in the country," Harper
said. "We will be ready when it
counts."
