The Stanford women's gymnastics team set out
to defend its 2(X)6 Pacific-1() Conference Champi
onship title last weekend in Tempo. Ariz. And while
the Card had some incredible performances,a near
perfect presentation by UCLA knocked Stanford
from its throne, l t /7.2-l%. t >s.
Even with

the second-place
finish, coach
Kristen Smyth
was pleased with
her team.
"We defi
nitely opened
the door in a few
places, but I felt
like the team
rose up when
we needed them

to." she s<iid. "The kids did a nice job of stepping in
and covering for each other when it counted."
UCLA junior Tasha Schwikert posted an al
most flawless all-around score of 39.75 to win the
meet. Stanford earned honors for Smyth, who was
named coach of the year for the second year in a
row, while freshman Carly Janiga was Pac-10
Freshman of the Year.
"I wasn't even aware that there was a freshman
award,so 1 was really surprised when I received it,"
Janiga said.
The Card started out the competition on the un
even parallel bars,its strongest event t his year. Solid
bar competitors Liz Tricase and Tabitha Yim. both
juniors, were back in the line up. Sophomore Kelly
Fee started out with a solid 9.8. but sophomore
Nicole Ouradas untimely fall on her dismount set
the team back. Junior Alex Pintchouk stepped up to
deliver a strong routine with a stuck landing.
"Alex performed the first clutch routine of the
night." Smyth said."She had to follow that miss,and
she did a beautiful job, which set up the lineup to
finish very strong."
After Pintchouk's performance. Yim earned a
9.925 with a full twisting double tuck.
Ihen came Tricase, ranked No. I
nationally all last season. Her aggres
sive. powerful routine earned her a
9.95 and the bar title. The Cardinal
scored a 49.325, tying its third-highest
bar rotation of the 2(X)7 season.
Junior Lauren Elmore and Yim
started the squad on the balance
beam with solid performances of
9.875 and 9.9, respectively; Yim tied
for fourth in the event. But then Jani
ga had her first fall on the balance
beam in her collegiate career, result
ing in a disappointing 9.175. Fee, the
anchor for the beam, delivered a
much-needed 9.85 to finish the event.
"That was the second major clutch
routine of the night." Smyth said.
"When Carly went down that put
huge pressure on Kelly. She really de
livered when we needed her."

After two events. Stanford was in
the lead by a mere .05 over UCLA.
Pintchouk led off the floor exer
cise with a 9.8.1 Imore fought through
a short landing on her final tumbling
pass to score a 9.7 and Fee stepped up
for the second time, performing a
solid routine for a 9.85.
"I knew that I had no room for
error," Fee said. "We've always got
each other's backs. If I had made a
mistake, one of the girls would have
stepped up the same way 1 did."
Janiga and Ourada showed their
mental toughness by scoring 9.9 and
9.875. respectively, after they both
missed on previous events.
Stanford had some highlights on
the floor, but a strong bar perform
ance gave the Bruins a slight lead
after three events. 49.325-49.125.
The Cardinal moved to its final
event, the vault, with confidence, es
pecially with Tricase and Yim back in
action. Stanford earned three scores
above 9.8. and two over 9.9, highlight
ed by Pintchouk's 9.925, her season
best, and third in the competition.

"Having Liz and Tub back for the
first time in eight weeks was wonder
ful and they did beautiful vaults, but
Alex was spectacular in the anchor
spot and showed more evidence that
she is really emerging as a leader on
the vault." Smyth said.
Still, Stanford's efforts on the vault
were not enough to overcome
UCLA.
"We had some real highlights at
the meet, but we also know that we
can do better and that we still have
not reached our full potential," fresh
man Stephanie Carter said. "We are
definitely moving in the right direc
tion to peak at the perfect time. It is
going to be great to see what lies
ahead of us."
The Cardinal women finished their
season with a No. 4 national ranking
and a No. 1 ranking in the Pac-10 and
the Western NCAA region.They next
compete in the NCAA regional com
petition on Apr. 14.
