# BUSINESS SCHOOL
## Microsoft CEO chats on campus 
### LINUS LIANG 
What makes a great company? Steve Ballmer, Mi
crosoft CEO and Stanford GSB drop-out. returned to
campus March 15 to reflect on this question. In front
of a completely packed Bishop Auditorium. Ballmer
took part in a fire side chat with the Dean of the Grad
uate School of Business. Robert Joss.
Ballmer's excitement was apparent when he dis
cussed the four stages he attributes to a successful
company.
First, a company must invent something, and sec
ond, bring it to critical mass/Hiird, Ballmer said,"milk
it like heck when it's at critical mass." capitalizing on
the market share. Finally, the company must create an
environment to repeat the process.
"Great companies wind up having to be all four,"
Ballmer added.
Ballmer then applied this reasoning to the compe
tition. responding to audience questions about
Google.
"Google built one very good business, okay, but
they only have one thing that they do. Everything else
is sort of cute, but there's one thing." he said
Ballmer referred to Microsoft as "a two-trick
pony."
"Two-trick ponies are rare in the history of busi
ness," Ballmer said. "Desktop was a trick and server
was a trick. The third trick, we're trying to do online:
the fourth trick, we're trying to do consumer electron
ics."
Ballmer also answered questions about the future
of Microsoft, stating that the company's core compe
tency is still writing the software that will positively

transform society. Among the innovative technologies
that Microsoft is working on are television, reading,
and speech recognition.
When asked about the increased competition for
top talent. Ballmer was not too worried. He men
tioned that Microsoft just had its best recruiting year
and he welcomed the competition.
"If you want to work on the broadest set of kind of

interesting ways to transform the
world through technology, there's no
better place to work than Mi
crosoft," he said. "That's a fact."
I"he discussion continued with
Ballmer's tough decision to leave
Stanford, which began during his
first year of business school in 1980.
Since he had multiple offers from
prestigious consulting and banking
firms for summer jobs, he spent
spring break visiting their home of
fices.
On a whim. Ballmer decided to
end the trip in Seattle to see his
friend Bill Gates, who had been urg
ing him to work at Microsoft, then a
23-person company. While there.
Gates tried to persuade him to give
up his offers and instead work there
for a summer.
"I thought about it for a day and
I said, well. Bill is the smartest guy I
had ever met," Ballmer said, adding
that he had always wanted to work
with Gates, whom he met on his dor
mitory floor as an undergraduate at
Harvard.
Although all he knew about the
company was that "it was the world
leader in an emerging thing",
Ballmer decided to give it a try.
After six weeks, however, here

alized he had made a big mistake
and decided to go back to Stanford.
Before he left, though. Gates took
him to dinner one last time "and at
dinner Bill said to me, 'look, you
don't get it. You may feel like
you've just joined to become the
bookkeeper of a 30-person compa
ny, but we're going to put a comput
er on every desk and in every
home.'"
Those lines struck a chord with

Ballmer and he reconsidered, buying
a house in Seattle a mere three
weeks later. Eighteen years later.
Forbes listed him as the 12th richest
man in the world.
