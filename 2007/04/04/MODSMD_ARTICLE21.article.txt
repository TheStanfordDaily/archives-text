match in three (30-25,30-26 and 30-

game one. Stanford closed to 20-18
and 26-24, but a block and ;i kill
clinched the game for the Gauchos.
UCSB never trailed after 3-3 in
an uneventful game two. Game
three was much closer, with Stanford
hanging just a point or two behind
the Gauchos throughout the early
stages. But UCSB used a four-point
spurt to build a 27-l l ) lead and
cruised to the win.
"liven though we lost in three,
this was one of our best-played
matches yet." Kosty said. "Our out
side hitters had a solid performance,
which resulted in a high hitting per
centage. Ibis was one of the first
times that a team has been able to
hold their opposite [Evan Patak] to
only one ace for the match.
We were competitive, but against
a team like that, you have to be even
after 25 in order to have a chance for
victory," he continued. "We were still
trying to catch up at that point, and
we just didn't have enough time in
the match to find a rhythm."
Romero led the Cardinal with 14
kills and three aces in Santa Barbara.
Ceran and Shoji each added 12 kills
to the Cardinal effort. Groppi had 39
assists en route to a team-best hitting
percentage of .333. Defensively,
Shoji and sophomore Jarod Keller
finished with six digs apiece.
Ibe Cardinal now hopes to have
a great performance this weekend,
with home finales against No. I Pep
perdine and No. 14 Southern Cali
fornia this Friday and Saturday, re

"We get two great opportunities
to play two great competitors in this
league." Kosty said. "We get to play
the No. I team in the country, which
has proven themselves over and
over.'lbis will be a great time to play
and learn from the best."
