While most Stanford students were relaxing over
spring break, Stanford women's lacrosse (4-6) trav
elled to the East Coast to battle some of its tough
est competition of the season. An exciting Mar. 25
game against Virginia Tech ended in overtime with
a 12-10 Cardinal victory, but No. 3 Maryland proved
a tougher opponent, topping Stanford 15-7 in a tel

eviscd game just three days later. Finally, in an
amazing upset, the Cardinal defeated No. 12 Van
derbilt 10-9, thanks to freshman Dana Lindsey's
game-winning goal with four seconds left.
I he ( ardinal women had to edge out a win over
Virginia Tech, as they allowed the Hokies to come
back from a 7-4 deficit with 23:42 left in the game.

Sophomore midfielder Bess Siegfried receives a pass in a Mar. 1 1 home game against Colgate. After its eastern swing, the Cardinal now launches into
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
But with the score tied at seven, the
Hokies lost their momentum as
Stanford went on its own scoring
streak. Goals from senior midfield
er Liz Piselli, sophomore midfield
er Bess Siegfried and senior attack
Michelle DeChant gave the Cardi
nal a 10-7 lead with only five min
utes remaining.
Not to be deterred, the Hokies
forced overtime with three straight
goals, the last coming with just 41
seconds left in regulation. The first
overtime draw went to Stanford,
and the momentum would stay in
its corner for the remainder of the
game. With 3:17 left on the clock,
Piselli took advatage of a free-posi
tion shot for her second goal of the
night. Only a few minutes later.
DeChant posted the insurance
goal. Junior goalkeeper Laura
Shane did not disappoint in the
win, notching an impressive 11
saves.
Despite their show against Vir
ginia Tech, the Cardinal women
were no match for the No. 2 scoring
offense of Maryland. The Terrapins
took control of the game early in
the first half with three unanswered
goals in the first ten minutes. A goal
from Stanford sophomore Jamie
Nesbitt only irritated the Terrapins,
who responded with a five-goal
streak to blow the game open at K
-1. Freshman Lauren Schmidt
scored with about 6:30 left in the
first half, but then the Terps zipped
in four more goals on the half,
bringing the score to 12-2.
Not to be discouraged, Stanford

emerged from the loeker room with
renewed energy. Neshitt and
Schmidt combined for three goals
in the half's first five minutes, only
for the Terps to shut the door with
three more scores. The Cardinal's
DeChant and Siegfried scored the
game's final tallies.
A last-second goal ended Satur
day's heart-pounder against Van
derbilt, a suitable end to a strange
game. The Commodores had the
early edge, posting two quick scores
within the first two minutes, but
they didn't score in the half's final
l l ):l l ). In the meanwhile, Stanford
went on a five-goal roll to bring the
score to 6-3 by halftime.
Vanderbilt started the second
half much as it did the first, initiat
ing a 5-1 scoring run with a goal
only 30 seconds after the opening
whistle. The rest of the half saw a
variety of unusual calls, including
five yellow cards against Vanderbilt
players and a red card for Com
modore coach Cathy Swezey. One
yellow card resulted in an empty
net free shot for the Card, only for
Stanford's shot to hit the post.
Amidst the plethora of whistles,
Vanderbilt and Stanford traded
goals until the score read 9-9. Hut
with only four seconds to go. fellow
freshman Julie Christy found the
hero Lindsay for the decider.
Christy herself was honored yester
day as the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation co-Player of the Week.
Up next for the Cardinal women
is a visit this Friday from Denver,
one of the MPSF's strongest teams.
The 7 p.m. start will mark a rematch
of last year's tournament champi
onship.
