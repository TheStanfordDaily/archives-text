# Harbaugh talking the talk
## 
### 
In case you missed it, a funny
tiling happened during the
Daily's two-week hiatus: Stan
ford football made the national
news. Albeit indirectly.
Coach Jim Harbaugh had some
interesting comments on the future
of Southern California's program in
an interview with CBS Sportsline.
He opined that success in college
football is often linked to a coach's
longevity with a program, listing
Notre Dame's Charlie Weis, Ohio
State's Jim Tressel and Pete Carroll
at IJSC. But then he added the kick
er: He'd heard that Carroll would
only be coaching the Trojans lor one
more year, presumably then moving
to the NFL's greener (and richer)
pastures.
In the Los Angeles Times. Carroll
responded with textbook coachs
peak. issuing a blanket denial that
said pretty much nothing at all. All
told then, here at Stanford, we have
a genuine national story on our
hands. From newspaper columnists
to ESPN's semiliterate Jim Rome,
talking heads everywhere wondered
whether Harbaugh really does know
something about Carroll's future.
Rome asked whether this was just
the motivation the Trojans needed
to score 100 points against the Car
dinal this season.
Quips and barbs aside, something
is radically different here. Stanford
football is in the news — sort of. But
after a 1-11 season, that is news in it
self.
The insinuation that Harbaugh's
looking to stay for the long term
should be music to Cardinal fans'
ears. (At least until the UCLA sea
son-opener. What will really set him
apart, for better or for worse, will be
the on-field performance of his
squad in 2007 and beyond.) But with
4 p.m. today marking the start of
spring practice. Stanford's new
coach is seemingly going the extra
mile in trying to renew the kind of
enthusiasm that hasn't accompanied
the program since the bygone days
ofTy Willingham.
In making sweeping changes, like
a return to the 4-3 on defense and
position switches for numerous
players, the former quarterback
known in the NI L as "Captain
Comeback" has distanced the pro
gram from its immediate and dismal
past. But in his oft-stated commit
ment to a West Coast-style offense,
praise of the Stanford tradition of
the scholar-athlete and open admi
ration for Bill Walsh, Harbaugh has
made clear that he's attempting to
spark a renaissance, not a revolu
tion.
Ami that's why Harbaugh should
be making headlines. Granted, his
efforts will ultimately be judged by
his record, but so far at least, Har
baugh appears to be saying all the
right things.
Still the story was not Harbaugh
per se. but the claim about Carroll's
truncated future at IJSC. That's to be
expected. On the national scale, the
Trojans are big news and the Cardi
nal aren t. What should be encourag
ing, though, is that I larbaugh would
n't back down, and said at a recent
conference."We bow to no man. We
bow to no program here at Stanford
University."
Its that attitude that Harbaugh
has to hope will be infectious among
fans, students and alumni, and even
his own team. Because no one knows
how soon the program will be rele
vant again in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, but a good first step (especially
for recruiting) is creating the belief
that it will happen sooner, not later.
And Harbaugh's comments do ex
actly that.
So while the on-field rebuilding
process may be barely underway, at
least the rhetoric is in lull swing.
After all. you've got to start some
where — and when a college power
house like USC is involved, it en
sures that the rest of the college
football world will, on some level,
have to take notice.
And for Pete Carroll, if Stan
lord s new guy really is on to some
thing, so much the better for the con
ference's "Little l >."
