Listserv term misused
It has come to our attention that
you have used the term LIST
SERVER) to describe electronic mail
distribution lists ("Tragedy of the
Listserv commons," Mar. 14). Unfor-

tunately, that term is a registered
trademark and should only be used
to refer to our email list management
software product.
It is a common mistake to use
LISTSERV(R) as a generic term.

We request that you replace it with
another phrase, such as "e-mail
list." "mailing list" or "discussion
group."
