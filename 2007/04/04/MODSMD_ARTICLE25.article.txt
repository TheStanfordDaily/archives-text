### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate spent most of its brief first
meeting of the quarter discussing
two proposed changes to the judi
cial charter. The first alteration
would broaden the jurisdiction of
the Board on Judicial Affairs in
sexual assault cases, while the sec
ond would extend the time window
for victims to report an offense.
The first proposed amendment
would widen the scope of the cur
rent charter, which "does not apply
to alleged offenses committed off
campus. except those associated
with participation in University ac

tivities." The new charter would
"apply year-round to all on-cam
pus activities, and to any acts that
threaten the safety and integrity of
the University community regard
less of where such acts occur."
The second proposed amend
ment would extend the time peri
od in which charges can be filed
from six months to two years after
the alleged offense took place.
The change would apply specifi
cally in cases "involving sexual as
sault. dating/domestic violence,
sexual harassment, stalking, a
hate crime or physical assault."
The Senate will vote on the pro
posed amendments next week.
