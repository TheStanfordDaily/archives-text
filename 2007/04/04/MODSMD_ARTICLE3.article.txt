never happen," Hisaw said. "Gladys
was so caring as a friend, daughter, sis

contact with," she said.
Rachel Ko. who attended the Cate
School with Ayora. said she will re
member her for how she focused her
life on "service and making the world

a more beautiful place."

the best of our lives the way Gladys
did."

Ayora family" during a difficult time
for them.

Dean Arcadio Morales, de Peralta
and other friends of Ayora have
begun planning a memorial service to
be held next week at a time yet to be
determined.
"Many of us. myself included, took
the news with tremendous shock and
disbelief," Navarro said. "Never did
we think that something so sudden
and tragic could happen to one of our
very own, especially to somebody
like Gladys. We all miss her tremen
dously, but we know we need to try
and stay positive and upbeat since
that's how she would've liked it. We
must remember her life more so than
mourn her death, which will be the
purpose of bringing the community

for the service."
