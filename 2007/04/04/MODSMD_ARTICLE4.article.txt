# STUDENT GROUPS
## Conservative students to broaden base Group's kickoff event will showcase George George Shultz 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Co-founders of the nascent Stanford Con
servative Society (SCS) are hoping to spark
far-reaching discourse that attracts students
of all ideological stripes and mobilizes the
University's conservative community.
"We wanted to expand conservatism." said
Grant Starrett '10. Co-founder and president
of SCS. "We want to be a home for engaging
people, not just a home for conservatives."
Steve Flory'lo.SCS treasurer.said that he
initially was a member of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans but left the group to help
form a new organization that would reach out
to a variety of conservative thinkers, including
libertarians, moderates and even moderate
liberals.
"A lot of people are feeling disenfran
chised by the Republican Party at the mo
ment.so I want to reach out not just to Repub
licans." Flory said.
Flory emphasized the group's informali
ty and said that SCS would not require
large time commitments or duties from
members.
"It will be an informal, noncommittal
group where we discuss the events of the
week and share conservative ideas." he said.
"We want group members to feel involved
and be having fun."
George Shultz — who served as secretary
of state during much of Ronald Reagan's pres
idency— will be the featured speaker at the
group's opening meeting on Apr. 10, which will
also include a series of informal "Coffee with
Conservative" discussion meetings.
Starrett discussed the importance of foster
ing personal connections between conserva
tives at Stanford and noted that encouraging
this social interaction is one of SCS's
goals.
"Politics will unite everyone [at
the group events] but will come sec
ond to getting everyone there," he

said. "1 like the
personal connec
tion between con
servatives, espe
cially with the mi
nority mindset. I
am very excited
about what we can
do by reaching out
to people."
Though the

group will always have an informal
dynamic, Flory said he expects it to
become more active next year as the
election approaches. Starrett plans
to bring more guest speakers to cam
pus. including Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court John Roberts.
Starrett said he pursued Schultz
because of his record as a I loover In

stitution Fellow and public servant.
Flory said that Schultz normally
charges a $S().(KH) appearance fee
but waived that commission and
agreed to speak at SCS's opening
event for free.
The group has been trying to pub
licize itself and the upcoming event
via Facebook and word-of-mouth.
"We are also going to dorms to
feel out who the conservatives are
and to try and invite them to join our
group." Flory said.
Flory said that the group's youth
and energy will set it apart from other
conservative groups on campus.
"The Stanford Conservative So
ciety will be different from other
conservative groups on campus be
cause we are a young, very excited
group of kids." he said. "All three of
the officers are freshmen, as op
posed to the officers of the Stanford
College Republicans, who are most
ly seniors. We're a good group of
guys — really committed and excit
ed about being together lor the next
four years."
