## Sexual violence Web site launched Organizers hope initiative expands accessibility, awareness of options for victims of assault 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Sexual Violence Advisory Board and Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman unveiled a new Web site last week that aims
to centralize information about the resources available for student
victims of sexual attacks.
Hie site."Sexual Assault & Relationship Abuse Prevention & Sup
port at Stanford," includes a hotline number for Stanford's Sexual As
sault Center, a list of the various ways that students can report sexual

crimes and other re
sources for sexual violence
victims. It also offers infor
mation detailing which re
porting options are anony
mous, which are accompa
nied by legal investiga
tions and which require a
medical exam.
Officials said the new
site was created to fill an
important hole in the Uni
versity's existing support
system.
"It was an obvious gap
in student life issue that is
governed by policy." said
Carole Pertofsky, director
of I lealth Promotions Ser
vices at Vaden Health

"Very few people on
campus are aware of all
of the resources available,
and certainly not the
everyday student
— LAURETTE BEESON,
Assistant Dean of Students

Center. "We thought students needed information about sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse — awareness and definitions, preven
tion. response options and consequences for offenders."
The Sexual Violence Advisory Board and the Women's Center at
Stanford launched the site a few months ago but only began to publi
cize it last week via promotional emails to campus lists.
Those involved said the new site was created in part to raise aware
ness about support on campus.
"It's confusing for a member of the Stanford community, if they've
been assaulted, to know what services exist and what kind of support
is available," said Assistant Dean of Students Laurette Beeson.who
was instrumental in the site's creation. "Very few people on campus
are aware of all of the resources available, and certainly not the every
day student."
According to Beeson. the Uni
versity wants to get a better under
standing of sexual violence on cam
pus, while maintaining student pri
vacy. Administrators hope that the
site will help them identify trends
and reveal ways to make the campus
safer.
Tracking sexual assault at Stan
ford — and beyond — is difficult
because many sexual violence inci
dents go unreported. Beeson added.
Recently, the California Coalition
Against Sexual Assault (CAL
CASA) conducted a survey of 32
colleges and universities in Califor
nia which found that 1 in 4 women
had been victims of rape or attempt
ed rape. 84 percent of those attacked
knew their assailant and 57 percent
of the assaults occurred on dates. Ac
cording to the study, 42 percent of
victims told no one about the assault
and only five percent reported it to
the police.
According to the Department of
Public Safety's Web site, the number

of reported sexual offences (includ
ing rape and fondling) dropped from
38 in 2003 — when the "serial grop
er" was terrorizing campus — to
four in 2005. The police received no
reports of rape on the Stanford
Campus in 2005, down from six in
2003 and two in 2004.
The Office of Judicial Affairs re
ported that after four years with only
two combined sexual assault-related
violations of the Fundamental Stan
dard. there were seven cases last
school year.
By making it easier for students
to report assaults. Beeson hopes the
University will be able to form a
more concrete idea of how often of
fences occur on campus.
"It is extremely personally diffi
cult. if you are assaulted, to decide if
you want to report it and to whom.'
she said. "There are a lot of reasons
that sexual assault is the most under
represented crime."
Users can access the new site's re
sources by typing "rape." "relation
shipabuse"sexualassault" or "do
mesticviolencc" into the URL line of
any Stanford network computer.
