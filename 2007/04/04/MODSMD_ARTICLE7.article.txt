## Sexual violence Web site launched Organizers hope initiative expands accessibility, awareness of options for victims of assault 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Sexual Violence Advisory Board and Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman unveiled a new Web site last week that aims
to centralize information about the resources available for student
victims of sexual attacks.
Hie site."Sexual Assault & Relationship Abuse Prevention & Sup
port at Stanford," includes a hotline number for Stanford's Sexual As
sault Center, a list of the various ways that students can report sexual

crimes and other re
sources for sexual violence
victims. It also offers infor
mation detailing which re
porting options are anony
mous, which are accompa
nied by legal investiga
tions and which require a
medical exam.
Officials said the new
site was created to fill an
important hole in the Uni
versity's existing support
system.
"It was an obvious gap
in student life issue that is
governed by policy." said

"Very few people on
campus are aware of all
of the resources available,
and certainly not the
everyday student

Center. "We thought students needed information about sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse — awareness and definitions, preven
tion. response options and consequences for offenders."
The Sexual Violence Advisory Board and the Women's Center at
Stanford launched the site a few months ago but only began to publi
cize it last week via promotional emails to campus lists.
Those involved said the new site was created in part to raise aware
ness about support on campus.
"It's confusing for a member of the Stanford community, if they've
been assaulted, to know what services exist and what kind of support
is available," said Assistant Dean of Students Laurette Beeson.who
was instrumental in the site's creation. "Very few people on campus
are aware of all of the resources available, and certainly not the every
day student."
