Apr. 4,1930:
ITie Stanford Axe is Stanford's
own once more. While the Blue and
Gold horde literally slumbered on its
feet last night, a hand of twenty in
trepid wearers of the Cardinal
whisked the precious implement
from under the nose of the Berke
leyans in whose possession it had
rested since that fatal day in 1899,
and brought it back to the Stanford
campus.
A fake newspaper camera with
an ink bottle for a lens and a home
made tear bomb were the hoods
pulled over and thrown into the eyes
of the Californians. While part of the
twenty men rode as guards on the ar
mored car that was conveying the
axe from the Greek theater, scene of
the Bean's annual axe rally, to the
Greek theater where it was kept
sheltered, a group of pseudo-photog
raphers occupied the crowdis atten
tion with their apparent efforts to get
a picture. Then, flash! A tear bomb
burst in the midst of the startled
Berkeleyans, a surge of Stanfordites
closed around the custodian of the
axe as he attempted to step from the
car, and the axe was gone before the
Californians realized what had tran
spired.
Now the Weapons lies safe in the
vaults of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
