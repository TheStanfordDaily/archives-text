## ADMINISTRATION Parents rank Stanford No. 1 Survey says high schoolers' top choice is NYU 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Moms and dads nationwide may love Stan
ford even more than their kids do, a national sur
vey shows. In the Princeton Review's 2007 Annu
al College Hopes and Dreams Survey, Stanford
was voted as parents' number one "dream
school" — that is, the top choice for their chil
dren if acceptance and money were non-issues.

Students, however, voted New York University
as their favorite for the third year in a row. Stan
ford was third on their list following NYU and
Harvard. UCLA was the only other California
school on either list,coming in seventh in the stu
dents' rankings.
The Hopes and Dreams Survey has been con
ducted annually since 2(M)2 and its results are
published in the Princeton Review's "Best 361
Colleges" book. Stanford has done well histori
cally, ranking as parents' first and second choice
for 2005 and 2006 respectively. Students rated
Stanford third and fourth on their 2005 and 2006
lists.
According to Stanford Parent Club President
Eva Jacob, it comes as no surprise that parents

hold the University in such high regard.
"Everybody thinks Stanford is a great school;
it has great breadth." she said in an email to The
Daily. "1 always meet parents who are very gung
ho about Stanford."
Jacob cited a perceived lack of arrogance on
campus as another feature of the University that
parents appreciate. The difference in parent and
student rankings may lie in which criteria each
group values, she said.
"Parents feel that it is a very safe environment,
and 1 don't think kids choose Stanford for that
reason." she said. "Parents feel that Stanford is in
a much better environment than a lot of the other
top schools — safety and security is
a big issue tor them."
Jacob speculated that NYU's
urban location may be responsible
for its popularity with students.
"NYU may have been at the top
of the [students' list] because of
where it is located," Jacob said. "I
think it's exciting to be in New York
as a young person."
NYU's three-year stint at the top
of the student survey is surprising to
some students, however.
"They're obviously a good
school," said Chris McCarty "09,
"But not on the same level of Stan

ford."
The annual survey also revealed
other education issues about which
students and parents disagreed.
While parents' primary concern is
their child's coursework, students
are more likely to worry about
money and debt accumulation.
The survey found that 65 per
cent of both students and parents
found the college application
process "highly stressful." while 51
percent claimed that financial aid
would be "extremely necessary."
The study was conducted online
from February through the end of
March. 4,594 high school students
and 1.260 parents participated in
survey.
