## ASSU race is officially on Slates guard flyer areas in White 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Campaigning for next week's ASSU flec
tions kicked off at at midnight yesterday, as can
didates gathered in White Plaza to begin flyer
ing.
"We probably had 30 or 40 candidates in
White Plaza," said Elections Commissioner
Bernard Luis Fraga '08. "They had been staking
spots for about four hours before. White Plaza is
now full of flyers."
Fraga said that the grounds maintenance
staff removed some flyers.
"(There was] a little catch this morning due
to a mix-up," he said. "The Stanford grounds
maintenance staff took down a lot of flyers and
banners this morning and candidates had to put
them back up."
Fraga also noted that over 100 candidates are
running in the Apr. 11-12 elections, including a
record five Executive slates.
Flyering was the most popular strategy for
outreach in the opening salvo of the week-long
campaign. One of the Executive
slates, Hershey Avula '08 and
Mondaire Jones '09, also distributed
T-shirts and placed an ad opposite
that of fellow Executive candidates
Brett Mammon 08 and Lakshmi
Karra '08 in table tents in dining halls
across campus.
Along with a "Promote the Vote"
elections party at ITie 750 featuring
GSC and Executive candidates,
"Meet the Candidates "dinners were
the centerpiece of yesterday's cam
paigns. Candidates visited Stern
Dining and Wilbur Dining last night
and will do so again tonight, before
moving to Lagunita Dining and
Ricker Dining on Monday and Tues
day.
Candidates reacted favorably to
the meet-and-greet style of cam
paigning featured at the "Meet the
Candidates" dinners.
"Apparently in the past they've

tended to do debates, but the Elec
tions Commissioner wanted it to be
more one-on-one meet the candi
dates, and he decided to set up more
events like this where you go around
and speak to people one-on-one,"
said Anthony Bestafka-Cruz 10. a
candidate for the ASSU Senate.
"1 think it's actually a good oppor
tunity to meet the voters and show
the candidate more as a person and
not as a flyer," added Raffi
Mardirosian *10, another Senate can
didate."Most of the flyers, if you look
at them, they look pretty much the
same. So it's just an opportunity to
show the voters that I'm a real person
and tell them what 1 have to offer."
Students expressed mixed reac
tions regarding the campaign kick
off yesterday.
Criticism of the Office of Student
Activities (OSA) —prevalent on
many flyers — resonated with
Xavier Gaeta '09.
"The issue of the OSA and its
management is a major campaign
issue," he said. "Hopefully it will re
verse the trend that the OSA has
been taking towards bureaucratizing

a lot of the social activities that have
been happening."
Yuhao Ding 09 expressed disap
pointment with some of the livers he
has seen.
"I don't like it when people make
campaign promises they can't keep."
he said, referencing various candi
dates' promises to eradicate the
caterpillars on campus.
Ranee Graham-Bailey said
he would have preferred more tra
ditional debate-based campaign
ing.
"The flyering is crazy." he said.
"I'm somebody who's very interest
ed in the political process. I see peo
ple putting all of this effort into flyer
ing for a few things they're gonna
work on. 1 like debates. I like speech
es."
The campaign period will last
until Tuesday and voting will occur
online Wednesday, Apr. 11 and
Thursday. Apr. 12. For more infor
