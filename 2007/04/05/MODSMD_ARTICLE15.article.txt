Campaigning for next week's ASSU flec

didates gathered in White Plaza to begin flyer
ing.
"We probably had 30 or 40 candidates in
White Plaza," said Elections Commissioner
Bernard Luis Fraga '08. "They had been staking
spots for about four hours before. White Plaza is
now full of flyers."
Fraga said that the grounds maintenance
staff removed some flyers.
"(There was] a little catch this morning due
to a mix-up," he said. "The Stanford grounds
maintenance staff took down a lot of flyers and
banners this morning and candidates had to put
them back up."
Fraga also noted that over 100 candidates are
running in the Apr. 11-12 elections, including a
record five Executive slates.
Flyering was the most popular strategy for
outreach in the opening salvo of the week-long
