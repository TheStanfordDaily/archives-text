In an event promoting the
launch of the Initiative for K-12
Education as part of the Stanford
Challenge, former University
president Donald Kennedy
called on the University commu
nity to focus on the pressing need
to evaluate and improve science
education in the United States.
President John Hennessy in-

troduced Kennedy,
noting that the
United States has
fallen behind much
of the world in
math and science
achievement at the
12th grade level.
"And yet we can

do it," I lennessy said. "We have
the ability to be successful."
He pointed out that students
enrolled in Advanced Place
ment courses in high school
achieve at levels that are com
petitive internationally.
Hennessy decided to include
the K-12 Initiative in the Stan

ford Challenge after numerous
alumni stressed the need for
leadership in the field.
"Last year I toured the Unit
ed States talking to alumni about
the future of the University,"
I iennessy told the audience."We
had to make a more significant
commitment to K-12."
Kennedy pointed out that one
of the education system's key
problems is its inability to attract
and retain teachers.
"I'd argue that much of our
objections to education in
America at this level would dis-


Kennedy
appear if there were a sense among
parents and observers that we were
getting better teachers," he said.
Kennedy pointed out that the
problem of recruiting able teachers
has been targeted effectively by
Teach for America.
"Twenty-five years ago. a bright
Stanford undergraduate would sit
down at a dinner table with a group
of others [...] and only with great re
luctance would undertake the an
nouncement that he wanted to teach
high school English or chemistry.
Teach For [America] has played a

huge role in changing all that."
Several audience members noted
that Kennedy failed to address the
low retention rate of students in sci
entific disciplines.
"1 was disappointed because 1
thought the speaker didn't connect
with a lot of issues particular to science
education,"said Jon Shemwell.a grad
uate student in Education. "At some
level we are shunting people away
from math and science and [Kennedy]
didn't address the particulars."
Administrators hope that the K
-12 Initiative will be an important in
terdisciplinary mechanism for Stan
ford to target deficiencies in current
policies governing primary and sec
ondary education.
"These problems don't come in
disciplinary packages," School of Ed

ucation Dean Deborah Stipek said
in an interview with The Daily "The
whole campaign is about creating in
centive and support."
The K-12 Initiative, she added,
will focus on three areas: teachers
and teaching; policy and leadership;
and governance.
"A lot of it is about engaging the
campus broadly," said Kenji Hakuta,
professor of education and a mem
ber of the K-12 Initiative's Steering
Committee. "The whole university
[should] be involved."
In an interview after the event,
Kennedy brainstormed several
changes that could be made at Stanford
to facilitate the promotion of education
as a legitimate career path for students.
"I wonder whether the career
center shouldn't offer [the opportu
nity to recruit on campus] to a group
of principals from Bay Area
schools," he said,"The director of the
career center ought to be open to
that sort of suggestion."
Both Kennedy and Hakuta ac
knowledged that changes may need
to be made with regard to the per
ception that the Stanford communi
ty undervalues education.
"We ought to reward teachers bet
ter," Kennedy told The Daily. "Teach
ing ought to be a profession talked
about with the same amount of re
spect as law. medicine and business."
"We're trying to explore ways to
start shifting values," Hakuta said.
"Changing that will take time."
