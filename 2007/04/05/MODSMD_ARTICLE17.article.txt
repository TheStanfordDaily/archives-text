### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
Levinthal Mall was packed last night as Brown
University Economics Prof. Glenn Loury delivered a
simple message.
"Crime and punishment in America have a
color," he said bluntly.
True to his economics background. Loury sup
ported his claim with chart after chart of detailed ev
idence. But his data were in service of a passionate vi
sion.
"Someone needs to speak for the juveniles locked
up in Florida for life without possibility of parole, for
AIDS victims chained to their bunk and dying of
neglect," Loury said. "If not me, who? If not now.
when?"
Loury peppered the audience with statistics: The

proportion of the population in prison in America is
6.1 times that of Canada and 12.3 times that of
France. Violent crime has plummeted by 60 percent
per capita in America since 1993, but the amount of
nonviolent offenders in prison has skyrocketed.
There is nearly a three-fifths chance that a black
male high-school-dropout born between 1965 and
1969 will have gone to prison before the age of thir
ty-five.
