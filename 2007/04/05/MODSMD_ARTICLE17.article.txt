## Prof parses prisons Loury addresses race bias in U.S. incarceration system 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
Levinthal Mall was packed last night as Brown
University Economics Prof. Glenn Loury delivered a
simple message.
"Crime and punishment in America have a
color," he said bluntly.
True to his economics background. Loury sup
ported his claim with chart after chart of detailed ev
idence. But his data were in service of a passionate vi
sion.
"Someone needs to speak for the juveniles locked
up in Florida for life without possibility of parole, for
AIDS victims chained to their bunk and dying of
neglect," Loury said. "If not me, who? If not now.
when?"
Loury peppered the audience with statistics: The

proportion of the population in prison in America is
6.1 times that of Canada and 12.3 times that of
France. Violent crime has plummeted by 60 percent
per capita in America since 1993, but the amount of
nonviolent offenders in prison has skyrocketed.
There is nearly a three-fifths chance that a black
male high-school-dropout born between 1965 and
1969 will have gone to prison before the age of thir
ty-five.

Yesterday evening, Brown professor Glenn Loury spoke to
a crowd in Levinthal Hall about race and incarceration.
But Loury did not confine him
self to the language of statistics. In
stead. he leaped to the realm of
morality and ethics and drew conclu
sions there.
One of his prominent arguments
was that a failure in personal respon
sibility did not alone account for the
problems of America and African-
Americans.
"1 know how attractive such ideas
can be." Loury said. "1 once espoused
them myself."
Instead, he argued that the state,
by exerting an overblown response
to crime, also bears responsibility.
"Whose failure is it when 15-year
olds threaten us with guns in the
streets?" Loury asked. "Yes. it's
theirs,yes, it's their families' — and it
stops there?"
Loury said that the rates and
methods of imprisonment in Amer
ica have helped create a vicious

cycle with incarceration fostering a
prison culture that leads to more
crime, harsher punishment and yet
more incarceration.
"We don't have to do this," Loury
said. "I'm not a Pollyanna; I under
stand that social control is necessary.
The question is how, and at what
cost. There are sensible alterna
tives."
Harvard professorTommie Shel
by, who is participating in a discus
sion about Loury's work on Friday,
emphasized the importance of that
message.
"He brought out the ways in
which the treatment of crime is polit
ical." Shelby said. "There are a range
of choices involved."
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Josh Cohen noted the emphasis
Loury gave to the racial and punitive
aspects of the judicial system.
"He forcefully put on the table
for discussion an issue that is ex
tremely important and very rarely
discussed." Cohen said.
Economics graduate student
Jamie McGuire said that Loury
clearly illustrated the problem, not

ing especially a prison Loury de
scribed in which a man was habitu
ally raped by a gang whose mem
bers thought of him as their "prop
erty."
"He did a good job of being
graphic about it," McGuire said.
While there were few students
in the audience of around 150. the
room was filled with faculty, in
cluding some high-profile campus
figures. Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-
Haims '89 and Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan were pres
ent, as was President John Hen
nessy. who delivered the introduc
tory speech.
"I don't get to |see) great lectur
ers like Prof. Loury often," Hennessy
told The Daily beforehand. "I've had
this one down on my calendar for a
while."
Loury will be giving his second
talk, entitled "Social Identity and the
Ethics of Punishment," today at 5:30
p.m. at Stanford I lumanities Center.
