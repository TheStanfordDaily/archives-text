## Mock trial team takes fifth First national contest for Law School team 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
In its first trip to the national stage of
the National Trial Competition, the
Stanford Law School's mock trial team
took home fifth place at last week's
prestigious tournament.
Rae Woods JD '07. Fred Smith JD
'07 and Jeremy Presscr JD 'OS beat
nearly 300 teams on their way to the
top-five finish, trailing only first-place
winner Chicago-Kent College, Tem
ple University, Notre Dame and Pep
perdine.
"A very motivated group of stu
dents run our Mock Trial program,"
said George Fisher, a professor at the
Law School who occasionally
worked with the team.The Universi
ty's mock trial program was founded
in 2003 by two former students and
continues to he largely student-run
today.
"To be honest, we prefer being on
our own because of the freedom it
gives us as an organization," Presser
said. However, team members also
recognize the need for future faculty
input.
"We got some limited input from
faculty, which was invaluable,"
Woods said, "but I think that if Stan
ford is to take it to the next level, we'll
need some guidance from a more in
volved coach because law students
can only teach themselves so much."
Woods also noted that many
other schools give students credit
and scholarships for participation on
a mock trial team, while Stanford of
fers no such incentives.
The National Trial Competition
— which Woods called "one of the
oldest and most prestigious mock
trial competitions in the United
States" — is sponsored by the Amer
ican College of Trial Lawyers, which
also judges for the competition.

Presser said teams are judged
"based on how well students know
the law, how well they present the
case,how well they can think on their
feet and general oral advocacy
skills."
After their fifth-place finish, the
University's mock trial has ambi
tious goals for the future.

"We will continue to compete in
this tournament in coming years, as
well as the tournament sponsored by
the American Association of Justice,"
Woods said. "Teams that plaee well at
both of those top tournaments re
ceive invitations to the Tournament
of Champions, and we hope Stanford
reaches that level soon."
"Many of our strongest members
are first year law students, so we're
very excited about our prospects,"
Presser added.
The trial at the national competi
tion was The People v.Toby Baron, a
fictional case about an alleged rape
that incensed some participants.
"It's too bad that the authors of
the fact pattern failed to exercise bet
ter judgment," Woods said. "Unfor
tunately, the fact pattern was riddled
with harmful stereotypes about rape
victims. Teams were forced to argue
the rape victim was promiscuous and
enjoyed deviant sex to win, because
the sole issue was consent."
Despite her objections, however,
Woods reiterated her stance that
mock trial is an invaluable learning
experience.
"There is no better activity to test
your ability to think quickly and to
get valuable experience applying the
legal knowledge we've been learning
in the classrooms," she said.
Fisher echoed her sentiments.
"Trial advocacy training is a critical
part of preparing for trial lawyering,"
lie said. "Lots of lawyers learn on the
job. In the real world, it's rare to get
constructive feedback on trial skills."
