# A 						LOOK BACK
## Women's season cut short 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
At the start of the NCAATournament.it seemed
as if Stanford women's basketball had come full cir
cle. A No. 4 preseason ranking and expected Final
Four run were nearly tossed aside by season slip-ups.
but Stanford pulled off a 29-5, 17-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference record and reclaimed the Pac-10 Tourna
ment title.
So with a No. 2 seed in the Fresno, Calif, region,
where its first two games would be at Maples Pavil
ion, the Cardinal had come around and was back on
track to the Final Four.
But the circle was never completed.
In the NCAA second round, Stanford lost 68-61
to 10-seed Florida State.
"We're just really, really, really disappointed,"
head coach T'ara VanDerveer said after the stunning
upset. "This will rank up with all the opportunities
that we've wasted, but I think this is a very unfortu
nate wasted opportunity."

Junior right-hander Nolan Gallagher will take the mound Sunday afternoon in Arizona. Gallagher,
who has pitched one complete game this season, is slated to make his ninth start this weekend.
As senior center Brooke Smith put it.the
Cardinal just didn't get it done.
"We weren't playing well [in the first
half]." Smith said. "I thought that we were
lucky to be up at halftime. We just didn't do
as well as we could have done, and we really
tried to improve on that, but we just didn't
get it done."
An II -2 Seminoles run in the last 8:42 put
to bed Stanford's hopes of its first Final Four
since 1997 and a chance at a fourth straight
Elite-Eight appearance.
ITiere are claims that Stanford played
"tight on its home court — missed shots,
foul problems and more — and one only
need look back to start of the season for the
obvious amount of pressure that has fol
lowed the talented and touted team.
In the WN IT second round. Stanford lost
its high rank in a 55-52 upset loss to No. 24
Brigham Young. An 18-2 run by the Cougars
in the final 7:23 left the Cardinal reeling as it
couldn't make a shot in the clutch.
"No one got it done," VanDerveer said in
a statement similar to the one she'd be mak
ing a little more than four months later. "We
can t make the mistakes we're making and
expect to win."
The same held true as the Cardinal faced
its top competition of the season.Tennessee
assumed the No. 4 ranking and had its 11th
straight win over No. 11 Stanford, 77-60.
Only two days later on the road, the Cardi

nal lost 74-69 to then-No. 8 Georgia.
Stanford dropped to a 2-3 record, its low
est since the 1999-2000 season, when the
Cardinal went on to a 21- ( > final and lost in
the NCAA second round to the Lady Bull
dogs.
"We played against two top 10 teams,
[and] we're disappointed in what we did,"
VanDerveersaid."! think that we have very
competitive players.and [a loss| makes peo
ple even more competitive. It makes them
more determined."
That determination was needed soon
with Pac-10 competition around the corner.
Fortunately for Stanford, another good
thing come out of its November road losses:
the breakthrough of freshman forward
Jayne Appel.
Appel.a McDonald's Ail-American and
2006 Gatorade State Player of the Year,
came off an injured left shoulder to play in
the Nov. 13 BYU loss. But it was in the Ten
nessee game that she made her presence
known when she posted 23 points, five re
bounds and five blocks in 30 minutes of play.
She followed up with 16 points and nine re
bounds at Georgia.
More stellar performances followed,and
after twice earning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors. Appel said she felt like she
had "been able to piece it all together."
"I lopefully.for the rest of the year, it'll be
like that." she added.

And it was. As Appel stepped up for the
( 'ardinal, the women returned to form with
17 straight wins. The freshman proved a
force on the inside, along with Smith and
senior center Kristen Newlin. And at the
end of the season, Appel was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year and had averaged
13.2 points and 7.5 rebounds.
Another new face, freshman JJ Hones,
also found her place as the Cardinal's go-to
point guard. With sophomore Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude out on injury. Hones started
20 games and averaged 4.9 points, 3.9 assists
and 24.3 minutes per game until Feb. 4.
Ihat day, Stanford watched another
point guard fall to injury. Just 39 seconds
into the game. Hones came off a three-point
attempt and tore her ACL — she was out
for the season. Things only went downhill
from there, though, as Stanford had its 17-
game streak broken by then-No. 21 Califor
nia. 72-57.
As for the point-guard void, at first it
looked like it would be filled byjunior guard
('andice Wiggins. But the Cardinal was able
to find a new star in Melanie Murphy; the
freshman's late-season efforts led her to av
erage 14.6 minutes and 2.4 assists per game
;is she helped get the ball inside to Appel.
Wiggins would also encounter injury
trouble. The two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Year (a first-team All-Pac-10 honoree this
season) had a more statistically subdued
season, averaging a team-high 16.9 points
(less than hist year's 21.8 points). But her
presence was felt even more all around the
court, with stellar ball-handling and team
leadership.
It was no surprise then that Wiggins was
n't the only one feeling the hurt when she
sprained her ankle for a second time this
season. (Wiggins also struggled with an in
jured hamstring during the season.)
Stanford was able to close out the con
ference season with six straight wins, secur
ing the Pac-10 regular-season title for the
seventh straight time. And when Wiggins
did return, in the first game of the Pac-10
I'ournament. it was with a vengeance. In the
three games of the tourney, she averaged
21.7 points and had two huge defensive
moves to pull out the championship win
over the Cardinal's top Pac-10 rival, Ari
zona State. 62-55.
"('andice gives everything she can give,"
VanDerveer said after championship
match. "She's the most competitive person
in the room. She's phenomenal."
From there, the Cardinal found itself a
No. 2 seed lor the NCAA Tournament and a
No. 5 national rank. After steamrolling
Idaho State, 95-58. Stanford's season was
cut short against Florida State.
With that, four members of the team
ended their ('ardinal careers: Smith, Newlin,
Markisha Coleman and Clare Bodensteiner.
Smith anil Newlin will especially be missed
in the Cardinal's post. Smith averaged 13.9
points and h rebounds on the season, while
Newlin averaged 7.9 rebounds.
Now. Stanford must move on without
them. Although Wiggins has only one more
year left with the Cardinal, the team's rising
talent — Appel, I lones. Murphy and Gold-
Onwude— will likely ensure future suc
cessful seasons. As will Stanford's No. 4 re
cruiting class for the coming year: Hannah
Donaghe, Kayla Pedersen, Jeanette Pohlen
and Ashley Cimino, a 6-foot-3 forward and
(latorade State Player of the Year.
