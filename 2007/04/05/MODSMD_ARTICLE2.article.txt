## Women's season cut short 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
At the start of the NCAATournament.it seemed
as if Stanford women's basketball had come full cir
cle. A No. 4 preseason ranking and expected Final
Four run were nearly tossed aside by season slip-ups.
but Stanford pulled off a 29-5, 17-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference record and reclaimed the Pac-10 Tourna
ment title.
So with a No. 2 seed in the Fresno, Calif, region,
where its first two games would be at Maples Pavil
ion, the Cardinal had come around and was back on
track to the Final Four.
But the circle was never completed.
In the NCAA second round, Stanford lost 68-61
to 10-seed Florida State.
"We're just really, really, really disappointed,"
head coach T'ara VanDerveer said after the stunning
upset. "This will rank up with all the opportunities
that we've wasted, but I think this is a very unfortu
nate wasted opportunity."

Junior right-hander Nolan Gallagher will take the mound Sunday afternoon in Arizona. Gallagher,
who has pitched one complete game this season, is slated to make his ninth start this weekend.
