### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR

both were won by a score of 4-3. Stanford
faced San Diego on Tuesday and Santa
Clara yesterday at home.

matches tomorrow and Saturday. But the
two recent wins have put No. 60 Stanford
back on track; the team is 3-1 over the past
four matches after going on a four-game
slide at the end of March.

when it sets the tone in doubles. After
sweeping doubles against San Diego (8-9)
and Santa Clara (14-6). Stanford eventually
won both overall matches.

Muller and Matt Bruch paired up to move
their team toward victory on Tuesday with
an 8-5 win. The No. 27 doubles team faced
USD's Thomas Liversage and Chris Coet
zee. Freshmen Richard Wire and Paul Mor
rissey won their set against Jonas Mouly and
Levon Brown. 8-3. Rounding out the dou
bles teams at No. 3 were senior Eric Mck
ean and freshman Kevin Kaiser, who de
feated Charl Wolmarans and Matt
Ozurovich, 8-5.
Wire had another opportunity to shine
later that day when he played at the No. 1
singles position against the Torero's No. 47
Liversage. While the Cardinal was up at the
end of doubles, San Diego came back with
three wins in the first five singles matches.
