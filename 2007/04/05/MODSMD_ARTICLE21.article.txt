## Editorial Board Honors theses merit saving 
### 
As senior undergraduate honors
candidates enter into the final leg
of the thesis writing process, it is
worth taking a step back and considering
how their work will he preserved for pos
terity. As it stands, most academic depart
ments have some policy for maintaining
copies of recently completed theses for
anyone interested in either writing a thesis
or sampling undergraduate research.
These collections are usually kept in de
partmental offices, or occasionally depart
mental libraries, and rarely span back more
than a few years. Some copies of under
graduate theses also find their way into the
University library archives. By doing a
genre search on Socrates (the University li
brary cataloguing system) one can find, for
example, the 2006 honors theses for the
Program of Urban Studies, the 2003-2005
honors theses for the program in Interna
tional Security Studies, and the 1979-1993
honors theses in Human Biology. The de
scriptions of these collections helpfully in
form us of the number of linear feet that
are occupied by each (an impressive 15 in
the case of the 1 luman Biology theses), but
offer nothing in the way of subject matter,
author or title.
'I"he University's current stance
toward the preservation of undergraduate
theses ouuht to be reconsidered. The writ

ing of an honors thesis entails a substantial
commitment of time and effort by students.
The University, and its departments, ought
to acknowledge the achievement of its hon
ors thesis writers by developing a more sys
tematic approach to preserve the culmina
tion of their work. At a minimum, this
should entail a University-wide policy ad
vising departments on how honors theses
ought to be maintained. Further, the de
partments should coordinate with the li
brary so that copies of theses are regularly
collected and catalogued in such a way that
students might be able to benefit from their
preservation, without having to make some
Indiana Jones-like expedition into the Uni
versity archives. We suspect this might be a
more substantive undertaking than our
quick description might imply, and for that
reason we would support the exploration of
more innovative approaches that minimize
the burden placed upon library and depart
mental office staffs. In particular, in this era
of PDFs and broadband access, it may be
more preferable to maintain the collection
as an electronic database. Regardless of the
ultimate form that such a system might
take, we strongly encourage a coordinated
effort among students, librarians and de
partment administrators to address the cur
rent deficit in this aspect of the honors the
sis program.
