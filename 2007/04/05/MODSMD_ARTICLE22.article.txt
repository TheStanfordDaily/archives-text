# My sister, the felon
## 
### 
So. 1 have two younger sisters. We are
comically different. While the youngest
is down in LA with so much stardust in
her eyes she's dangerous behind the wheel,
my other sister is in upstate New York doing
things 1 don't understand. 1 don't under
stand because I 'm not as cool as she is.
I've never been as cook I mean, I'm a
pretty righteous dude. In high school,every
girl thought I was sweet and pure and
thought of me like a brother. My sister,
though, she was prom queen. That means
she was so cool that people thought she was
hot. Social slang is a mixture of weather de
scriptions I haven't fully mastered. All 1
know is. she's cool and apparently hot. and
I 've been described as "balmy" or "milder in
the afternoon."
In high school, our social lives were pret
ty different but we had a typical sibling rival
ry and constantly tried to be cooler than
each other. When she got the summer fun
Barbie, I had to get the cheerleader Barbie.
She could beat my friends at Beirut, I could
beat them at Tekken 5. Always, she had a
cooler answer for my actions.
I thought I caught up to her in college. I
upgraded the social groups I'd previously
run with by joining the newspaper staff and
by playing in the marching band. In re
sponse. she joined the rugby team and used
phrases like "expand one's mind" to de
scribe her behavior. Well, it it was an arms
race of coolness she wanted. I was going to
give it to her. I began buying T-shirts with
clever sayings on them and I wore scarves a
lot, even though the weather never really
demanded it. Cool people ignore the weath
er. They are above the weather.
But just this past month.she found a way
to beat me again. I don't know how I'll
ever top it. She was arrested. That's like
the nuclear bomb of coolness. If you have a
record, you're like the most badass person
on the block. My baseball card collection
and my comic book-centered thesis can't
even touch that. Imagine being in a party. In
one corner, you have me with my obscure T
shirts and witty banter related to Japanese
film. I'm sweet and nice but vaguely myste
rious — not in a Humphrey Bogart kind of
way. but more of a Tobey Maguire kind of
way. I guess wh.it I 'm saying is. though I may
look completely unimpressive, one would
hope there is a strong possibility I have been
bitten by a large radioactive insect. I lowev
er. she in the other corner will always trump
me. She wears hooded sweatshirts artfully
torn down the middle — mine lack the
tears. I can't pull off the tears. It just further
adds to the idea that she is dangerous and
possibly criminal while she passes out copies
of her mugshot as party favors.
My attempts to defuse her coolness have
only been frustrated. At first, I thought we
were arguing semantics. I mean. I got
pulled over once. I had a run in with the law.
I listen to controversial music and don't
have mainstream political beliefs on domes

tic or international issues. Sometimes, even,
I pirate music. Other people's music!
But then I found out my sister was arrest
ed under the Patriot Act. Dammit. She's so
dangerous, so edgy, she's a terrorist! Just
give me dork glasses right now, because I'm
never going to be as cool as that. She got
pulled over by the cops, and they found a
fake ID on her. People don't realize, but
under the Patriot Act, showing false identi
fication papers is a felony offense. That
means next time you use your fake to buy
booze, you could find yourself in violation of
a law meant to stop terrorism. Meanwhile,
my sister is a felon. My own sister! I'm so
jealous 1 could kill her! And I guess then I'd
be fighting terrorism. Just like every show
on CBS. CBS is cool, right?
Her reaction was just adding further in
sult to injury. She played it off, all chill like it
was nothing.They handcuffed her. they took
her mugshots (so jealous), and probably
sent her off to some maximum security
prison, like Abu Jersey. Me. 1 was getting
angry and writing about how if a 20-year-old
blond college girl can be classified as a na
tional security threat and lumped in with
terrorists, there is something seriously
wrong with the Patriot Act, our government
and the current state of this country. This
was a totally uncool response.
She began to show off. in my opinion,
when she dropped the fact, nonchalantly,
that the cop asked for her phone number
and out to dinner afterwards. At first. I was
like, come on. the cop needs your phone
number for identification purposes. But no,
he wanted to ask her out. She goes to the po
lice station, gets a date. I go to the DMV. 1
only get some unsigned forms and a hand
job. Her story is cool, mine is made up for
this column.
So now I'm trying to figure out how ex
actly I'm going to beat her. She's got this
whole "I'm a potential terrorist" thing going
tor her (even though the charges were
dropped, she gets away with everything),
and her popularity and intrigue levels have
just soared in her upstate New York college.
I guess I'm going to have to rob a bank now
or kidnap one of Jack Bauer's daughters on
"24." Sigh. You'd think sibling rivalry would
dissipate when you get older.
Well. I'm off to buy a ski mask.

shirts and witty banter related to Japanese
film. I'm sweet and nice but vaguely myste
rious — not in a Humphrey Bogart kind of
way. but more of a Tobey Maguire kind of
way. I guess wh.it I 'm saying is. though I may
look completely unimpressive, one would
hope there is a strong possibility I have been
bitten by a large radioactive insect. I lowev
er. she in the other corner will always trump
me. She wears hooded sweatshirts artfully
torn down the middle — mine lack the
tears. I can't pull off the tears. It just further
adds to the idea that she is dangerous and
possibly criminal while she passes out copies
of her mugshot as party favors.
My attempts to defuse her coolness have
only been frustrated. At first, I thought we
were arguing semantics. I mean. I got
pulled over once. I had a run in with the law.
I listen to controversial music and don't
have mainstream political beliefs on domes

tic or international issues. Sometimes, even,
I pirate music. Other people's music!
But then I found out my sister was arrest
ed under the Patriot Act. Dammit. She's so
dangerous, so edgy, she's a terrorist! Just
give me dork glasses right now, because I'm
never going to be as cool as that. She got
pulled over by the cops, and they found a
fake ID on her. People don't realize, but
under the Patriot Act, showing false identi
fication papers is a felony offense. That
means next time you use your fake to buy
booze, you could find yourself in violation of
a law meant to stop terrorism. Meanwhile,
my sister is a felon. My own sister! I'm so
jealous 1 could kill her! And I guess then I'd
be fighting terrorism. Just like every show
on CBS. CBS is cool, right?
Her reaction was just adding further in
sult to injury. She played it off, all chill like it
was nothing.They handcuffed her. they took
her mugshots (so jealous), and probably
sent her off to some maximum security
prison, like Abu Jersey. Me. 1 was getting
angry and writing about how if a 20-year-old
blond college girl can be classified as a na
tional security threat and lumped in with
terrorists, there is something seriously
wrong with the Patriot Act, our government
and the current state of this country. This
was a totally uncool response.
She began to show off. in my opinion,
when she dropped the fact, nonchalantly,
that the cop asked for her phone number
and out to dinner afterwards. At first. I was
like, come on. the cop needs your phone
number for identification purposes. But no,
he wanted to ask her out. She goes to the po
lice station, gets a date. I go to the DMV. 1
only get some unsigned forms and a hand
job. Her story is cool, mine is made up for
this column.
So now I'm trying to figure out how ex
actly I'm going to beat her. She's got this
whole "I'm a potential terrorist" thing going
tor her (even though the charges were
dropped, she gets away with everything),
and her popularity and intrigue levels have
just soared in her upstate New York college.
I guess I'm going to have to rob a bank now
or kidnap one of Jack Bauer's daughters on
"24." Sigh. You'd think sibling rivalry would
dissipate when you get older.
Well. I'm off to buy a ski mask.
