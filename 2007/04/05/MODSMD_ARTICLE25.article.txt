# Anonymous art
## 
### 
I am not sure why I've noticed —
whether it's because I look at my feet a
lot when 1 walk, or because I have the
sharp, honed eye of an art major — but
over the course of this year, there have been
multiple wonderfully random, completely
inspired anonymous art pieces. Lurking
among us normal, unimaginative students is
a drove of secret guerilla artists who have
been silently and quite delightfully leaving
their creative mark on Stanford's public
arenas.
Firstly, there is the Intersection of
Death, a prime space for Tree Stunts, frat
party advertisements and near-accidents.
As of late, it has also been a mini-public art
museum.There was the short-lived but very
humorous twisted bike sculpture which fea
tured multiple bicycles locked together,
their bent frames and wheels presenting the
would-be aftermath of a high-speed five
bike pile-up. Then the trumpet section of
the Band made "The Vortex of Death,"
complete with a life-size trumpeter trum
peting on top of a two-foot-high stand. A
taped road with two lanes and helpful ar
rows directed traffic around the musically
inclined mannequin. Although the trum
peter eventually Dizzie Gillespied it some
where else, the substantial stand remained
and soon became home to a seven-foot,
cherry-red, diamond-shaped minimalist
statue. It was bedecked for Valentine's Day
with large red felt hearts and then again for
Women's History Month with an Austin
Powers-sized female symbol nestled in its
upper point. Who are these elfin decora
tors?
Recently, spray-painted banana peels
have appeared all over campus. There are a
few in the Intersection of Death, one in front
of the gym and another in the front of the
post office.
Most prolifically, there has been an en
tire assemblage of artistic chalking. Just as I
was studying "Howl" in my poetry class, I
awoke one sunny morn in utter enchant
ment to find the entirety of Allen Gins

berg's masterpiece colorfully written all the
way from White Plaza down to the History
Corner. Later that quarter another anony
mous chalker wrote feel-good phrases like
"You are beautiful" and "Breathe" from
White Plaza down to the Quad. My favorite
anonymous art project of all. however, was
the chalk-tracing of night shadows. As I was
leaving the painting studio late one night. I
realized that the shadow shed by a lone,
abandoned bike had been carefully traced
in chalk. A few steps further, the shadows of
Green Library's bollards were outlined, as
were the tress outside the Education Build
ing. Perhaps most stunningly, as a result of
numerous light sources around MeniAud,
the multiple shadows cast by one lamppost
had all been traced, a radiating starburst of
orange and yellow emanating from the lone
pole.
During the day, the lines were nothing but
a muddled, incoherent jumble of a chalking
gone-wrong, but at night, they became mag
ical, Pan's Labyrinth-esque creations —
each chalked shadow was just as wonderful
to discover as the next. The tracings were
captivating, and it had me scouring the
ground for evenings on end. not to mention
contemplating a late-night sting operation to
expose the nocturnal Shadow Chalker's true
identity.
Who are these people? Are they doing
projects for class? Are they the sons and
daughters of chalk company tycoons? I
can barely make myself comb my hair, let
alone anonymously create public art for
the Stanford community in my free time.
In fact, the only thing I have done for Stan

ford is recycle. And keep myself out of jail.
It amazes me that people do this kind of
stuff, with no possibility of recognition.
Yeah, yeah, the reward of a job well done
is to have done it. but we all know that is
the fourth falsest of all lies, behind 3) when
the serpent told Adam apples were awe
some, 2) Anna Nicole said she married for
love (God rest her soul) and 1) Pinocchio
told Shrek he wasn't wearing women's
panties.
Come to think of it. who are all the people
that fact check for Wikipedia and post on
You Tube? Who is this specimen of a crea
ture that writes an essay on the Greek god
Demeter simply so the world can access that
information for free, and then chalks shad
ows? With no credit needed, of course. Who
are you, Stanford student extraordinaire,
who puts red dye in the MemAud fountain
during Big Game Week, constantly updates
the always-intriguing Unofficial Stanford
blog. and writes me inspirational messages
on my way to class? They aren't creating a
portfolio, building a resume or signing their
name at the bottom of their work, they are
doing these things just for the sake of expres
sion.
And perhaps this is the purest art of all,
unmotivated by money or fame but simply
and wholly generated by the need to create
and share something personal. After all.
artists didn't sign their work for centuries,
until the Renaissance came along and every
one fell in love with the individual.
So, to all anonymous campus artists who
made art for the joy of art: Thank you for
making me aware of the beauty of shadows
and the power of poetry. I've noticed what
you've been up to, and I genuinely appreciate
it.
Here is to art, and to those that do it for
themselves, and for us.

If you own bucket fit Is of chalk or a banana peel
template, please please please email Katie at kt

you are.
