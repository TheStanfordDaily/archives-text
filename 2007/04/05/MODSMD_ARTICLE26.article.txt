## ASSU platforms don't dazzle GSC Some candidates absent front meeting 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a lengthy meeting last night,
the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) heard from several of the can
didates running for the ASSU Exec
utive, questioning them on their plat
forms and ideas.
Many of the two-person slates
echoed the same concerns, such as
creating a health care plan for gradu
ate students and reexamining how
student groups are organized.
"A lot of the things you hear from
Executive candidates are very gener
al things," former GSC Chair Tom
Lee said to one slate at last night s
meeting. "How are you going to be

different from all the other people?"
Some of the candidates acknowl
edged that graduate concerns are
often glossed over by Executive can
didates, who are all undergraduates.
"If you talk to other candidates,
they'll give you some bullet points —
like health care, vision and dental
plans or diversity — but there's no
real substance beyond that," said
Hershey Avula '08, who is running for
ASSU President with Lakshmi karra
1)8 as his Vice Presidential candidate.
Of the five candidate pairs run
ning for the Executive positions,
three appeared at last nights GSC
meeting. Neither Anthony Scodary
'08 and Annie Wyman '08. running as
'ITie Chapparal's mock slate Submit,
nor The Warm Weather Party's Brian
Truebe 08 and Folahan Olowoyeye
'08 were present.
In other matters, the GSC intro
duced a bill to place an excess

$100,000 from its reserves into
longer-term financial investments.
"It's something we cannot call an
endowment, but would essentially be
one," said GSC Funding Committee
Chair Adam Beberg.
However, the bill is expected to
meet resistance from other parts of
the ASSU.
"There's 15 arguments against it."
said Stanford Student Enterprises
CEO Matt McDonald '05, who over
sees many of the ASSU's funds. "The
key argument is precedent and how
you see yourselves as an organization "
He added that making this change
could possibly affect student groups
outside of the GSC.
GSC members plan to meet with
McDonald to discuss the bill further
before next week's meeting.
