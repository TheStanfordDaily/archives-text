## 
### 
Senior centers Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin were selected to
the WNBA during yesterday's draft in Cleveland. Smith was
picked 23rd overall in the second round by the Minnesota Lynx,
while Newlin was picked 34th by the Houston Comets in the
third round.
The two graduating seniors were the first members of the
Cardinal to be drafted by the WNBA since 2004, when Nicole
Powell was picked third overall by the Charlotte Sting.
In Minnesota, Smith will join two other Pac-10 players:
UCLA's Noelle Quinn (No. 4 overall pick) and Shay Murphy
(No. 15). The Lynx were 10-24 last year and finished seventh in
the Western Conference. The Comets were 18-16 last season,
and placed third in the same conference.
