## Men find fountain of youth Young team shows promise for 2007-08 season 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
A young Stanford men's basketball squad exceeded its
relatively low expectations for the 2006-07 season and
looks poised for a breakout campaign next year.
Ibis team's adventure began about a year ago. Last
June's graduation of 2005-06 starters Dan Grunfeld, Matt
Ilaryasz and Chris I lernandez put Stanford in a deep hole
heading into this season. The off-season loss of two assis
tant coaches only deepened that pit. l ive incoming fresh
men and three sophomores had to form the nucleus of a
team that would start just one upperclassman â€”redshirt
junior Fred Washington.
Given the team's youth, the media picked the Cardinal
to finish seventh in the conference.and most did not expect
an NCAA berth for the first time in years. Yet. by the skin
of its teeth. Stanford did just that.
The squad finished with a respectable 18-13 overall
record and 10-7 Pacific-10 Conference mark, returned to
the NCAA Tournament after last year's hiatus broke an
11-year streak.
Perhaps the season's most salient moments came in Jan
uary. First, sophomore Lawrence Hill's 14-foot jumper
beat the buzzer and shocked eventual ACC regular-season

Freshman center Robin Lopez started and played in 31 games this
past season. He will return next year to a team that should be very
similar to this year's, as only two players are set to depart.
