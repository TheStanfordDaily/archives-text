# A 						LOOK BACK
## Men find fountain of youth Young team shows promise for 2007-08 season 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
A young Stanford men's basketball squad exceeded its
relatively low expectations for the 2006-07 season and
looks poised for a breakout campaign next year.
Ibis team's adventure began about a year ago. Last
June's graduation of 2005-06 starters Dan Grunfeld, Matt
Ilaryasz and Chris I lernandez put Stanford in a deep hole
heading into this season. The off-season loss of two assis
tant coaches only deepened that pit. l ive incoming fresh
men and three sophomores had to form the nucleus of a
team that would start just one upperclassman —redshirt
junior Fred Washington.
Given the team's youth, the media picked the Cardinal
to finish seventh in the conference.and most did not expect
an NCAA berth for the first time in years. Yet. by the skin
of its teeth. Stanford did just that.
The squad finished with a respectable 18-13 overall
record and 10-7 Pacific-10 Conference mark, returned to
the NCAA Tournament after last year's hiatus broke an
11-year streak.
Perhaps the season's most salient moments came in Jan
uary. First, sophomore Lawrence Hill's 14-foot jumper
beat the buzzer and shocked eventual ACC regular-season


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman center Robin Lopez started and played in 31 games this
past season. He will return next year to a team that should be very
similar to this year's, as only two players are set to depart.
Co-champion Virginia. 76-75, in
Charlottesville, Va. The following
weekend. Stanford came back from
being down by five late in the game
to top Washington. 78-77 at Maples.
A last-second three by sophomore
Anthony Goods saved the day (and
a blown nine-point lead) against
Washington State. 71 -68 in overtime.
After a split with the Oregon
schools, Stanford upped the ante
when Southern California and
UCLA visited town. After a back in
jury sidelined him from July through
November, freshman Brook Lopez
trumpeted his potential against the
Trojans. Against them. Lopez
recorded the first triple-double in
school records and an all-time Stan
ford-best 12 blocks against South
ern California's touted freshman laj
Gibson in a 65-50 Stanford rout.
Three days later, the Cardinal an
nounced its arrival to national tel
evision audience when it rallied
from 17 down to shock then-No. 2
(and eventual Final Four-competi
tor) UCLA. 75-68.
Even when the team wasn't win
ning at Maples, Stanford certainly
was giving fans their money's worth.
The Cardinal twice defied the odds
to force overtimes with incredible
shots (see Goods' 24-foot contested
three, forcing double overtime in a
90-86 loss to Gonzaga) and equally
unbelievable rallies (see overcom
ing a 20-point deficit in a 85-80 over
time loss to Arizona).
But the season had its ugly mo
ments too. The team started with a
whimper, going down in double
digit fashion early at home to under
manned mid-majors Air Force (79-
45) and Santa Clara (62-46).
Then, a high ankle sprain forced
Goods to the sideline for the last
month of the regular season, and his
team struggled on the road in his ab
sence. Playing some of the worst
basketball any team in a Cardinal
uniform has played in recent memo
ry, the young squad was swept by the
Washington schools in early Febru
ary. The team played better in its an
nual Los Angeles trip two weeks
later but still came up empty-hand
ed.
Ultimately, the kicker to a 4-8 fin
ish came in tournament play. First

up were the Pac-10 quarterfinals at
Los Angeles' Staples Center where
Goods missed two potential game
icing free throws, as USC came from
behind for an 83-79 overtime win.
A week later, in the NCAA Tour
nament at Kentucky, Stanford was
caught with its pants around its an
kles. Louisville jumped to a 41-13
lead in what Johnson deemed Stan
ford's worst half of the year, walking
to a 78-58 victory in one of the most
lopsided games of the entire tourna
ment.
Still, the NCAA experience can
only help this young squad, and
looking ahead to next year's roster
gives even more reason for opti
mism. All five starters and virtually
every critical player returns from
this year's team, with the only losses
being reserve Carlton Weatherby
and walk-on Chris Bobel.
Meanwhile, 6-foot-8, 210-pound,
three-star power forward Josh
Owens arrives on the Farm from
Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire
while sharpshooting San Francisco
transfer Drew Shiller becomes eligi
ble for play. Most importantly.
Brook and Robin Lopez have
shown the physical ability to domi
nate Pac-10 play. A little polish over
the summer could drastically im
prove their games and Stanford's
overall fate.
The Cardinal players are not the
only ones looking forward to their
team's roster. As good as the Pac-10
was this year, it could be even better
in 2008; there are only eight gradu
ating seniors in the entire league.
Whether stars like USC's Nick
Young and Gabe Pruitt, UCLA's
Aaron Afflalo, Washington's
Spencer Hawes and Jon Brockman.
Arizona's Marcus Williams and
Oregon's Malik Hairston leave for
the NBA or come back to school
could have a major impact on next
year's conference hierarchy —as
well as how Stanford can reasonably
expect to do.
With so much talent on the Cardi
nal squad, it's hard to imagine Stan
ford not notching 10 wins in the con
ference, making a prolonged appear
ance in the top 25 and picking up its
first NCAA win of the Trent Johnson
era. Look for next year's team to do
just that, and if it catches a few
breaks, make a serious push deep
into postseason play.

to finish seventh in the conference.and most did not expect
an NCAA berth for the first time in years. Yet. by the skin
of its teeth. Stanford did just that.
The squad finished with a respectable 18-13 overall
record and 10-7 Pacific-10 Conference mark, returned to
the NCAA Tournament after last year's hiatus broke an
11-year streak.
Perhaps the season's most salient moments came in Jan
uary. First, sophomore Lawrence Hill's 14-foot jumper
beat the buzzer and shocked eventual ACC regular-season

Freshman center Robin Lopez started and played in 31 games this
past season. He will return next year to a team that should be very
similar to this year's, as only two players are set to depart.
Co-champion Virginia. 76-75, in
Charlottesville, Va. The following
weekend. Stanford came back from
being down by five late in the game
to top Washington. 78-77 at Maples.
A last-second three by sophomore
Anthony Goods saved the day (and
a blown nine-point lead) against
Washington State. 71 -68 in overtime.
After a split with the Oregon
schools, Stanford upped the ante
when Southern California and
UCLA visited town. After a back in
jury sidelined him from July through
November, freshman Brook Lopez
trumpeted his potential against the
Trojans. Against them. Lopez
recorded the first triple-double in
school records and an all-time Stan
ford-best 12 blocks against South
ern California's touted freshman laj
Gibson in a 65-50 Stanford rout.
Three days later, the Cardinal an
nounced its arrival to national tel
evision audience when it rallied
from 17 down to shock then-No. 2
(and eventual Final Four-competi
tor) UCLA. 75-68.
Even when the team wasn't win
ning at Maples, Stanford certainly
was giving fans their money's worth.
The Cardinal twice defied the odds
to force overtimes with incredible
shots (see Goods' 24-foot contested
three, forcing double overtime in a
90-86 loss to Gonzaga) and equally
unbelievable rallies (see overcom
ing a 20-point deficit in a 85-80 over
time loss to Arizona).
But the season had its ugly mo
ments too. The team started with a
whimper, going down in double
digit fashion early at home to under
manned mid-majors Air Force (79-
45) and Santa Clara (62-46).
Then, a high ankle sprain forced
Goods to the sideline for the last
month of the regular season, and his
team struggled on the road in his ab
sence. Playing some of the worst
basketball any team in a Cardinal
uniform has played in recent memo
ry, the young squad was swept by the
Washington schools in early Febru
ary. The team played better in its an
nual Los Angeles trip two weeks
later but still came up empty-hand
ed.
Ultimately, the kicker to a 4-8 fin
ish came in tournament play. First

up were the Pac-10 quarterfinals at
Los Angeles' Staples Center where
Goods missed two potential game
icing free throws, as USC came from
behind for an 83-79 overtime win.
A week later, in the NCAA Tour
nament at Kentucky, Stanford was
caught with its pants around its an
kles. Louisville jumped to a 41-13
lead in what Johnson deemed Stan
ford's worst half of the year, walking
to a 78-58 victory in one of the most
lopsided games of the entire tourna
ment.
Still, the NCAA experience can
only help this young squad, and
looking ahead to next year's roster
gives even more reason for opti
mism. All five starters and virtually
every critical player returns from
this year's team, with the only losses
being reserve Carlton Weatherby
and walk-on Chris Bobel.
Meanwhile, 6-foot-8, 210-pound,
three-star power forward Josh
Owens arrives on the Farm from
Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire
while sharpshooting San Francisco
transfer Drew Shiller becomes eligi
ble for play. Most importantly.
Brook and Robin Lopez have
shown the physical ability to domi
nate Pac-10 play. A little polish over
the summer could drastically im
prove their games and Stanford's
overall fate.
The Cardinal players are not the
only ones looking forward to their
team's roster. As good as the Pac-10
was this year, it could be even better
in 2008; there are only eight gradu
ating seniors in the entire league.
Whether stars like USC's Nick
Young and Gabe Pruitt, UCLA's
Aaron Afflalo, Washington's
Spencer Hawes and Jon Brockman.
Arizona's Marcus Williams and
Oregon's Malik Hairston leave for
the NBA or come back to school
could have a major impact on next
year's conference hierarchy —as
well as how Stanford can reasonably
expect to do.
With so much talent on the Cardi
nal squad, it's hard to imagine Stan
ford not notching 10 wins in the con
ference, making a prolonged appear
ance in the top 25 and picking up its
first NCAA win of the Trent Johnson
era. Look for next year's team to do
just that, and if it catches a few
breaks, make a serious push deep
into postseason play.
