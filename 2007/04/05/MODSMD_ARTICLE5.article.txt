# Cardinal Baseball
## TURNING UP THE HEAT Team hopes to stop three-game slide 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After suffering a home sweep at the
hands of UCLA to open Pacific-10
Conference play, Stanford baseball
heads to Tempe, Ariz, to square off
against another conference rival. No.
12 Arizona State.
The Sun Devils (23-10,4-2 Pac-10)
enter the three-game series today after
taking two of three games from Wash
ington in Seattle and winning 10 of
their last 13. Arizona State boasts a po
tent offense, led by first baseman Brett
Wallace, batting .481 with 11 home
runs,4s RBI and an eye-popping .850
slugging percentage. But far from
being a one man show, the Devils are
batting .360 as a team and average
nearly 10 runs per game. The Cardinal
(13-12, 0-3), by comparison, ranks
eighth in the conference with a .278
team average and is scoring just 5.64
runs per game.
Sophomore right-handed reliever
Max Fearnow sees an opportunity in
the matchup against Arizona State for
Stanford to bounce back from its
early-season struggles.
"They're good hitters." Fearnow
said of the Sun Devils. "We're going to
have to show up ready to play â€” and
we can play. We had a bad weekend
against UCLA, but we're only going to
get better. We have a lot of talent on our
team that is underachieving right now,
so the bright side is we have nowhere to
go but up."
ASU have been far from one-di
mensional this season, as the squad's
top two starters. Josh Satow (7-2.2.00

start of the season. Following some
high-scoring contests against the Bru

the series in Tempe all have run up

have marks of over 6.(X).
