# Cardinal Baseball
## TURNING UP THE HEAT Team hopes to stop three-game slide 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After suffering a home sweep at the
hands of UCLA to open Pacific-10
Conference play, Stanford baseball
heads to Tempe, Ariz, to square off
against another conference rival. No.
12 Arizona State.
The Sun Devils (23-10,4-2 Pac-10)
enter the three-game series today after
taking two of three games from Wash
ington in Seattle and winning 10 of
their last 13. Arizona State boasts a po
tent offense, led by first baseman Brett
Wallace, batting .481 with 11 home
runs,4s RBI and an eye-popping .850
slugging percentage. But far from
being a one man show, the Devils are
batting .360 as a team and average
nearly 10 runs per game. The Cardinal
(13-12, 0-3), by comparison, ranks
eighth in the conference with a .278
team average and is scoring just 5.64
runs per game.
Sophomore right-handed reliever
Max Fearnow sees an opportunity in
the matchup against Arizona State for
Stanford to bounce back from its
early-season struggles.
"They're good hitters." Fearnow
said of the Sun Devils. "We're going to
have to show up ready to play — and
we can play. We had a bad weekend
against UCLA, but we're only going to
get better. We have a lot of talent on our
team that is underachieving right now,
so the bright side is we have nowhere to
go but up."
ASU have been far from one-di

fcIRA) and Brian Flores (5-1, 3.()6)
would appear to match up favorably
against the Cardinal's starting rota
tion. which has been lackluster at the
start of the season. Following some
high-scoring contests against the Bru
ins, Stanford's scheduled starters for
the series in Tempe all have run up
ERAs of over 5.(X), and two of three
have marks of over 6.(X).

According to sophomore outfielder Joey Au
gust— a bright spot for the Cardinal in recent
games, bringing an 11-game hitting streak into
Thursday's contest — balance on both sides of the
ball is what will pose a challenge for Stanford.
"They're a great hitting team, but they've got a
lot of great arms ttx)," August said. "They're a
great team. I think they were picked to finish first
or second in the league, so we knew it would be a
big test no matter what the outcome was this past
weekend."
Offensively, the Cardinal's greatest success this
season has come playing from behind, as eight of
its 13 victories were in come-from-behind fashion.
Stanford scored nine runs in the ninth inning of
Saturday's 16-11 loss against UCLA.
"I really think it's just because we're playing
more relaxed," August said. "When you're down
big, there's not a lot of pressure 1 guess, so we're
finding ways to play more relaxed and loose. We
need to find ways to do that early on. And we need
to find ways to come to the ballpark relaxed, loose,
ready to go and try to put things together for nine
innings instead of just one."
After losing three of three to UCLA in the first
home sweep suffered by the Cardinal since 1997,

Thou: is certainly an added degree of pressure on
coach Mark Marquess's team. The Card has not
lost tour in a row to start conference play since
*77 Marquess's first year as Stanford's coach.
We d like to think that all the games are real
ly important, hut obviously going 0-3 puts us in a
ig hole. August said. "We have a long way to go.
But the main thing everybody can do is keep
working hard and keep doing what we've been
<- oing and just hope it will start paying off — try to
prove ourselves a little bit this next weekend.
We re excited for the challenge."
It will have to start paying off soon if Stanford
opestostay j n the thick of things in a competitive
Pac-10 Conference.
On one side you have to take it slow, one
game at a time, but on the other side, the season
isn t very long so there is some room for press."

Stanford scored nine runs in the ninth inning of
Saturday's 16-11 loss against UCLA.
"I really think it's just because we're playing
more relaxed," August said. "When you're down
big, there's not a lot of pressure 1 guess, so we're
finding ways to play more relaxed and loose. We
need to find ways to do that early on. And we need
to find ways to come to the ballpark relaxed, loose,
ready to go and try to put things together for nine
innings instead of just one."
After losing three of three to UCLA in the first
home sweep suffered by the Cardinal since 1997,

Thou: is certainly an added degree of pressure on
coach Mark Marquess's team. The Card has not
lost tour in a row to start conference play since
*77 Marquess's first year as Stanford's coach.
We d like to think that all the games are real
ly important, hut obviously going 0-3 puts us in a
ig hole. August said. "We have a long way to go.
But the main thing everybody can do is keep
working hard and keep doing what we've been
<- oing and just hope it will start paying off — try to
prove ourselves a little bit this next weekend.
We re excited for the challenge."
It will have to start paying off soon if Stanford
opestostay j n the thick of things in a competitive
Pac-10 Conference.
On one side you have to take it slow, one
game at a time, but on the other side, the season
isn t very long so there is some room for press."
»earnow said. "We need to get going. We can't
play like this for very long before we're out of it.so
we need to get it going quick."
