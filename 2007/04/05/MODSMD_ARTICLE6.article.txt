### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford soft hall team gets its first
shot at archrival California at home on Thursday,
before traveling north to finish the series on the
Golden Bears' home field.
After starting their conference season with a
solid 2-1 road trip to Oregon, the Cardinal
women (26-7,2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) are rel
ishing the opportunity to further strengthen its
record against the Bears (23-19,0-3 Pac-10).
"In the Pac-10. every weekend is tough." head
coach John Rittman said. "But this is different be
cause it's a rivalry weekend."
Stanford will hope to continue the power
surge that began against No. 12 Oregon last
weekend, when the team hit five home runs on its
way to a 15-4 victory. The win came right on the
heels of an 8-0 shellacking by the Ducks, giving
the weekend a night-and-day look that clearly
outlined what a team has to do to be successful.
"|ln the first game] we didn't get clutch hits,
we didn't pitch well and Oregon did," Rittman
said. "But we were able to bounce back.
"If you don't bring your A-game in this con
ference." Rittman added, "you're going to get
beat."
Central to the Cardinal's efforts, both on of
fense and on the other side of the ball, will be ace
pitcher Missy Penna.The sophomore right-han
der is sporting an 18-2 record and a 1.53 ERA
going into the Cal series, and she has been back
ing up her stellar pitching with her bat. Penna has
notched 17 RBI (good enough for third on the
team), and belted a grand slam in the second Ore
gon game last weekend.
Stanford's offense will also be looking for con
tinuity from junior second baseman Tricia Ag
gabao and freshman outfielder Alissa I laber. Ag-
