# Living up to the Cardinal rule
## Addressing the state of Stanford women's basketball 
### CHRISTORPHER ANDERSON 
FRESNO. Calif. — The party was on for the
Louisiana State faithful. I'all Tiger Sylvia
Fowles blew apart every Husky defense in
the paint and Connecticut's shooting went bitter
ly cold. Husky coach Geno Auriemma blubbered
on the podium. A boisterous contingent of LSU
fans cheered the program's fourth straight trip to
the Final Four.
Amidst all the celebration in the Fresno Re
gional final one thing was conspicuously absent.
Stanford.
The second-seeded Cardinal — playing the first
and second-round games in its own house — was
supposed to be here, purging the ghosts of three
straight trips to the Elite Fight without a victory.
Coming off a three-point loss to LSU in the
2006 Elite Eight, this was the year for the Cardinal
women, with almost every piece from last year's
regional finalist squad back. But instead of rocking
in Cleveland, the team stayed home, out-muscled
by 10-seed Florida State in a 68-61 loss.
The criticism began immediately. "The team's
not tough enough.The gameplan was bad.The star
player didn't take enough shots." To take it all in.
one might have thought the program was in a
death spiral.
Mike Eubanks, editor of thebootleg.com and
The Bootleg magazine, admits that the season was
a disappointment but feels the program is nearing
the zenith of excellence of the 19905, when the
team went to six Final Fours in eight years.
"This was the most talented team Stanford has
had since 1997. with three players the caliber of
Wiggins, Brooke Smith and Jayne Appel," Eu
banks said.
Eubanks points out the immense pressure of
expectations coming into this season. The injuries
to two starting point guards shattered continuity
and hampered the development of the team.
He also says Candice Wiggins was a shell of her
self, a result of a long break taken to recover from
previous injury as well as injuries sustained
throughout the season. While she had "Wiggins
moments" where she successfully took the team
on her back, Wiggins was far from the sparkplug
she was her first two years.
Eubanks also points out that this year's Pac-10
was inferior to last season, particularly in prepar

ing its teams for NCAA Tournament play. Also
missing was something like last year's Krista Rap
pahahn, who did one thing — shoot the three —
and did it well.
There are additional talking points about the
state of the program now that the 2006-07 season
is done.
Are rising powers taking away talent from Stan
ford, leaving it less able to compete nationally?
Not likely. The growth of women's college bas
ketball is riding a new wave of talented players,
enough to fill out rosters all across the country.Ten
years ago. it was a game dominated by a handful of
schools: Stanford, Tennessee, Texas Tech and
Louisiana Tech.Today there are at least twice that
many schools with a fair shot at winning it all. and
new powers have risen in Duke, Maryland, Ari
zona State, Rutgers and Baylor to name a few. Eu
banks suggests that some of that growth can be
traced to the success of the 1996 Olympic team,
coached byTara VanDerveer, that added national
spotlight to women's basketball.
But in terms of tradition, talent and institution
al support, the Cardinal is still beside Tennessee

and UConn as one of the top programs in the
game. Stanford's recent recruiting classes have
been very strong. Some of that talent — Wiggins,
Jayne Appel, Jillian Harmon and the point guards
— has made instant impact upon its arrival.
Is the schedule preparing the team adequately for
tournament play?
Yes and no. Stanford plays Tennessee, the crown
jewel of the game, every season, and in the past two
seasons scheduled aggressively with Texas Tech,
Minnesota and Georgia, to go with a strong slate in
the preseason WNIT. The rest of the season is de
pendent on the strength of the conference, with
tougher Pac-10 competition furnace-testing the
team for the dynamics of the postseason.
Is VanDerveer "losing it" as a coach?
Highly unlikely The Cardinal just went to three
straight Elite Eight games and lost them by a com
bined total of 12 points. According to Eubanks, the
key factor in the analysis is the vast differences in per
sonality and style between those three teams. I"he
first year (2(X)3-2004) was the Nicole Powell show,
lilting the team with her performance. The second
year was marked by the distributed leadership of five
seniors.The third team was a grow-up-fast outfit built
behind the experienced Wiggins and Smith.
Consistent success with that much change in
style is a sign of strong coaching. Eubanks claims
"the staff is as hungry as the program has been in
a long time."
Will the Pac-10 gain balance and national
recognition?
Probably both. With Duke coach Gail
Goestenkors taking the Texas job. a long string of
coaching dominoes are poised to fall. Charli Turn
er Thome just got a contract extension at Arizona
State and will continue to make her program a na
tional player. Hie opportunity is there for Pac-10
programs to add women's hoops to the athletics
arms race.
The growth of women's basketball in top-flight
athletic schools — schools with BCS-caliber foot
ball programs and strong conference competition
— might further concentrate success along in
ternecine rivalry lines like Stanford-Arizona State
and Duke-North Carolina-Maryland, leaving
smaller-conference programs like Louisiana Tech
and Old Dominion at a disadvantage.
Eubanks refuses to believe the program isn't on
the way up.
"To reinvent the team with three totally differ
ent sets of personnel, to go to the Elite Eight every
year, to be so close to going to the Final Four, that's
like the 90's," he said.
