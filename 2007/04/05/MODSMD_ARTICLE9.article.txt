## Chimeric 
### 
What happens when a mar
moset fathers his brother's
son? No, it's not a riddle —
it actually happens. Marmosets are
small South American monkeys with
very weird genetics. Marmoset moms
almost always give birth to fraternal
twins possessing a particular devel
opmental quirk. In utero, the twins'
piacentas fuse, creating a network of
blood vessels through which they
swap cells. So a baby marmoset ends
up being made of some cells of his
own, and some of his brother's.
The marmoset is an example of a
genetic chimera. In Greek mythology,
a chimera had the head of a lion, the
tail of a snake, and the belly of a goat.
In biology, a genetic chimera is an an
imal with two sets of DNA, like a mar
moset. For example, a marmoset's eye
cells might have different DNA than
his lung cells. Where it gets really in
teresting is when the monkeys have
different sex cells. A marmoset's
sperm cells could match the body cells
of his brother. So daddy marmoset's
kids can really be his nephews.
How did come to plumb mar
moset paternity, anyway? Re
searchers at the University of Ne
braska set up a marmoset colony,
and they wanted to keep track of the
families in it. But the family tree they
came up with was seriously mangled.
The researchers were trying to take
DNA from the marmosets' hair, but
hairs from the same marmoset had
different genetic code. Each mar
moset had DNA from itself in some
cells and DNA from its twin in other
cells. The marmoset is the first
known animal in which most mem
bers are chimeric.
But marmosets aren't the only
mammals that can be chimeric. Ge
netic chimerism is extremely rare in
humans, but it can happen when two
embryos meant to be twins fuse to
gether. The result is one human with
two sets of DNA. In effect, a genetic
chimera is his own twin.
Chimerism in humans can have
weird consequences. It is a favorite
plot device of shows like "CSI" and
"Law & Order." The episodes go
something like this: Detectives iden
tify a suspect in the brutal rape and

murder of some gorgeous coed The
cocky suspect mouths off to the med
ical examiner as she take his blood
for a DNA swap. Sure enough, his
DNA doesn't match the semen left
on the mutilated victim. Later the
detectives discover why: Their sus
pect's blood doesn't match his
semen. A genetic chimera! Further
DNA tests confirm the perp's identi
ty, and justice prevails.
But sometimes truth is stranger
than fiction. Genetic chimerism made
the news in a case even weirder than
the twisted fantasies of "CSI." Lydia
Fairchild was an unemployed mother
of three who applied for federal assis
tance. To make sure she wasn't com
mitting welfare fraud by claiming kids
that weren't hers, her whole family
had to be DNA tested. The results
came back with a surprise. The DNA
test said Lydia's kids were all siblings,
and Lydia's boyfriend was their fa
ther, but Lydia herself wasn't their
mother. Suspected of fraud or even
kidnapping. Lydia was told the state
could take her kids away. Frantically,
she dug up photos of her pregnancies,
her kids' birth certificates, and a state
ment from the obstetrician who deliv
ered them as babies. Still, DNA was
the gold standard of evidence, and
Lydia had a near-impossible time
finding a lawyer to take her case. She
began making plans to hide her kids
from the authorities.Then she became
pregnant again, and the state was so
suspicious of her they hired a court of
ficer to wait in the delivery room for
an immediate DNA test. This child,
too, came back as not belonging to
Lydia. A sympathetic attorney finally
took her case, and he stumbled across
a New England Journal of Medicine
paper on chimerism. Lydia was found
to have the condition, and the case
against her was dropped.
Technically, all human females
are chimeras of sorts. Females have
two X chromosomes, but in any
given cell, only one is active. One X
chromosome is balled up into a dor
mant bundle called a Barr body.This
process is random in each cell, so a
female winds up being a mosaic of al
ternating active X chromosomes. We
see this in calico cats: Orange patch
es mean one X chromosome is ac
tive. while black patches mean the
other chromosome is active. Human
females don't have black and orange
splotches, but their mosaicism can
manifest in other ways. A rare condi
tion called hypohidrotic ectodermal
dysplasia leaves its sufferers unable
to form sweat glands. The gene for
the disease is carried on the X-chro
mosome, so females might have one
good X and one diseased X. De
pending on which X is inactivated in
which place, they will have patches
of skin with sweat glands and patch
es without.
Marmosets would probably think
mosaic sweat glands are pretty tame.
But what I think is really wild about
chimerism is that nobody knows
they are chimeric until something
weird happens, like the state trying
to take their kids away. 1 leek. 1 could
be a chimera. Or would that be 'we'?

see this in calico cats: Orange patch
es mean one X chromosome is ac
tive. while black patches mean the
other chromosome is active. Human
females don't have black and orange
splotches, but their mosaicism can
manifest in other ways. A rare condi
tion called hypohidrotic ectodermal
dysplasia leaves its sufferers unable
to form sweat glands. The gene for
the disease is carried on the X-chro
mosome, so females might have one
good X and one diseased X. De
pending on which X is inactivated in
which place, they will have patches
of skin with sweat glands and patch
es without.
Marmosets would probably think
mosaic sweat glands are pretty tame.
But what I think is really wild about
chimerism is that nobody knows
they are chimeric until something
weird happens, like the state trying
to take their kids away. 1 leek. 1 could
be a chimera. Or would that be 'we'?
