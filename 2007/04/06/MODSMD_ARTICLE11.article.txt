April 6,1949:
"If a Communist teacher cannot
be objective in his presentation, he is
almost by definition precluded from
the classroom. Dr. Wallace Sterling
stated yesterday morning at his first
press conference after taking over
Stanford's presidency.
"Speaking before representatives
of newspapers and wire services. Dr.
Sterling outlined his ideas on Stan
ford's reputation, its standards, and

its dealings with Communists.
"i doubt if any member of the
Communist Party is a free agent,' he
continued, if he isn't a free agent, he
cannot be objective in his teaching.
Therefore, he should be precluded
from classroom presentation.
"'Communism is a real menace in
the world." Dr. Sterling said. "We can
only hope that the people confront
ed with the responsibility of combat
ing it, understand it.'"
