# Eccentric billionaire's irreverence amuses
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Billionaire real estate tycoon Sam Zell,
65, had an unorthodox message for Stan
lord Law School students last night.
"I thought law school was the biggest
l ucking bore of my life," he told a few hun
dred people gathered for a lecture spon
sored by the Rock Center for Corporate
Governance.
"But," he said to the relief of anxious
professors and students taking hundreds
of thousands of dollars out in loans,
"you've got to understand it if you're
gonna play, particularly if you're going to
play at a high level."
1 lis crude language matched his laid
back wardrobe. He eschews ties, often
wears jeans and has maintained a casual
dress code for his employees since the
l%os. In his two-hour public appearance
— reception, lecture, question-and-an
swer session — the man who has made
headlines this week for orchestrating an
$8.2 billion buyout of media conglomerate
Tribune, which owns 23 television stations
and is the parent company of the Los An
geles Times, was full of candor.
I lis performance was an amalgamation
of Charles Foster Kane, Gordon Gekko
and Jim Cramer. One moment, he was the

old village elder mentoring the eager,
young warriors in one breath; the next, he
was the ruthless, take-no-prisoners invest
ment baron who has stirred fear in news
rooms around the country with the possi
bility of deep cutbacks.
He sounded like the fictitious main
character of Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane"
["1 think it would be fun to own a newspa
per"] when he talked about his foray into
the industry. He deflected several ques
tions about how he would turn around Tri
bune and declined to give specifics, re
minding reporters that he has only been "a
newspaper man since Monday, and not
even that."
"Give me two weeks to become a ge
nius," he joked.
Zell, who calls himself "The Grave
Dancer," has been labeled a "bottom-feed
er" in press accounts. When he lambasted
the onerous requirements of Sarbanes-
Oxley and talked about his love for the
free market, he sounded like Gecko in
Oliver Stone's 1987 film "Wall Street"
speaking at theTeldar Paper annual meet
ing.
"1 was born 90 days after my parents
came to this country," he said, beaming
with pride. "My father taught me that the
streets are paved with gold, that there is no
other country in the world that has the
kind of opportunity that we have here. I
believe that.
"Yes, the U.S. is severely criticized in a
lot of different places around the world,
but in the end the most common question
that I hear as I travel around the world is

'Where's my fucking visa?"'
He told students never to take them
selves seriously and to enjoy whatever line
of work they pursue.
"If it ain't fun, I don't do it,"he said,
calling the maxim a "Sam-ism."
"1 really believe that the 11th Com
mandment is 'thou shall not takes one's
self too seriously.' When you're the owner,
you can do that."
At other points in his lecture, he
seemed most like Jim Cramer, the goofy
host of CNBC's "Mad Money" television
show who dispenses investment advice to
callers.
"1 hated academia," he told the crowd,
packed with high-ranking University ad
ministrators. "I thought it was boring as
hell, so I had to start and build businesses
while I was an undergraduate and while I
was in law school as a way of keeping my
sanity."
He bragged that he made $150,000 dur
ing his last year of law school at the Uni
versity of Michigan. And that, he told the
crowd, was in 1960s dollars.
His friends love his irreverence and
continual exertion of energy.
Zell's old fraternity buddy Lon Allan
JD '68, who introduced him at the event,
said, "Not too many people sell a business
for $39 billion and then before the ink is
dry, rather than going sailing in the
Mediterranean, buy another business for
eight or 10 or 12 billion."
