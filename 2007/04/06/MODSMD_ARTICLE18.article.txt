## Editorial Board Fill Lake Lag

line "lake" is most often mereh a dry and

be rectified.This spring. Lake ought to be
restored to its rightful, water-filled state. With
the warm weather and consistently sunny
forecasts of spring quarter, there is no better
time to call for this change than now.
Lake Lag was not always dry in the
spring. In the past, ample winter rains and di
verted water from a nearby creek provided
enough rainwater to fill the reservoir. Even
when natural conditions were ideal, howev
er. additional action had to be taken to boost
water levels. The Department of Athletics
had to pump up to 500 gallons of water per
minute into the lake to ensure that it would
be ready by the first week of spring classes.
In addition to the aesthetic benefits pro
vided to residents of Narnia. Jerry. Roble and

Lagunita dorms by the existence of a lake
rather than a muddy depression in their
backyards, the lake would have several prac
tical applications. In happier years, the now -
empty lake w as used for water sport practices
and windsurfing lessons during spring quar
ter. Adventurous spirits engaged in rafting
expeditions across its now-desolate surface.
Persistent campus rumor* maintain that the
lake is not filled to protect the California tiger
salamander, which is classified as "threatened"
in Santa Gara Count). On the contrary, sala
manders are well-served by the existence of a
large water source during the winter and spring
months. In years of drought, tiger salamanders
do not breed in many areas. According to a
1994 article in the Journal for Herpetology. an
academic periodical devoted to the study of
amphibians and reptiles, salamander larvae
thrived in the filled Lake Lagunita during the
spring months. A salamander-friendly policy
can. in fact, coexist with the mainte
nance of water levels during the spring.
The spring-quarter filling of Lake
Lag. especially in years when winter
rainfall and creek diversions are inad
equate, is an expensive proposition. It
carries, however,significant aesthetic,
recreational and ecological benefits.
Currently, the Facebook group 'Till
Lake Lag" has 4(X) members, demon
strating that considerable student ad
vocacy exists for action on this issue.
In addition to the fun of windsurf
ing lessons on Lake Lagunita, the
importance of nurturing a rare
species and the backyard benefits for
residents of nearby dorms, filling
Lake Lagunita would reinstate an
air of truth to its name. If the Univer
sity should balk at the idea of filling
the lake once more each spring, per
haps student petitioners should con
sider a request for a change of name
instead. Dirt Patch-unita. anyone?
