# Nursing a new contract
## Hospital union votes on second proposal after March rejection 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Nurses at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics (SHC)
and the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH)
voted yesterday on a preliminary employment con
tract agreement that would bring pay raises and im
proved retirement benefits. Contract negotiations
were completed last week after an earlier proposal was
voted down on Mar. 20 by members of the Committee
for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (CRONA).
the hospital nurse union. Results of yesterday's vote
will be announced later today.
If the agreement is ratified, a new contract between
the members of CRONA and the hospitals will be
valid until Mar. 31,2010. If it is voted down, the nurses
will be employed without a contract, as their previous
contract expired last week, and negotiators would re
turn to the bargaining table.
Nurses yesterday were optimistic that the newly ne
gotiated agreement would pass.
"When I speak to my coworkers, they're mostly
happy with it," said Lisa Fernandez, a registered nurse
who works on the maternity side of LPCH. "It's not
worth striking over."
Several other nurses told Lhe Daily that they were
happy with the new agreement. Dissenting nurses may
have chosen to skip the meeting, however, as CRONA
policy indicates that absence counts as a "no" vote.
CRONA president Lorie Johnson declined to com
ment until after the results are fully counted. Other
nurses also declined lo comment, citing union solidar

ity. CRONA leadership recommended the new agree
ment to its members.
Negotiations for the new contract began in Janu
ary. According to hospital spokesperson Sarah Staley,
central issues in the negotiations included wage in
creases, retirement benefits for both new and senior
employees and wage differentials for nurses whose
shifts fall into special categories, such as nights or
weekends.
" This is the opportunity for nurses to come to the
table and use their voice in obtaining a better sort of
working contract that is fair and reflects their hopeful
wage and retirement package," Staley said. "Those are
the sort of foundational elements of interest to con
tract discussions."
The earlier agreement was voted down on Mar. 20
after being rejected by the CRONA negotiating team,
which cited the hospitals' refusal to adequately in
crease the nurses' pay. an inadequate retirement plan
and unfair pay differentials for SHC nurses.
The new agreement would offer nurses a six per
cent pay raise in 2007. a 5.5 percent pay raise in 2008,
and a second 5.5 percent pay raise in 2009, which both
Staley and Fernandez said was higher than the pay in
crease offered in the previous agreement. If approved,
the agreement would also increase the night shift dif
ferential at SI IC to match LPCH's IS percent, and the
hospital would increase its matching retirement con
tribution by 1 percent.
Nurses casting their votes expressed unhappiness
only over a provision of the contract which requires
junior nurses to work 12 months before they are eligi
ble for retirement benefits.
"It was a question of this being a bit more of a com
prehensive package than last time we negotiated,"
Staley said."l think that both parties came to the table
in good faith in both situations."
