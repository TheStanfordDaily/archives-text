# Win, lose or draw

Before we get down to business. I have
something to say to Parvati Ra
machandran. (To be fair I actually
don't remember your name, but you sure
looked like a Parvati Ramachandran.)
I'm sure that you remember me. We first
fell head-over-heels for each other when
you accosted me in White Plaza under the
pretense of inviting me to the "anti-chauvin
ist/pro-gun/save-the-animals support our
troops" three-on-three DDR Tournament
that your over-funded under-representative
student group was hosting. Our eyes lacked.
1 signed your Special Fees petition, you
handed me a flyer and. according to the As
sociated Press, an angel got its wings.
Well,what 1 want to say is that I'm sorry I
never showed up. I really meant to come. It's
just that I'm not sure I'm really ready for that
sort of commitment right now. I mean. 1
hardly know you.ya know? But don't get me
wrong. It's been great. Never forget the good
times — or well, that good time. You've
helped me grow so much.Thank you.
That being said, my friends, we have im
portant news to discuss. As I'm sure you all
are aware, the results of the 2M7-2008 Law
Association Presidential Race shall be an
nounced this afternoon — and. dare I say it.
I am either the winner or the loser (or
maybe even both). To be safe. I've decided
to write this column as both the triumphant
celebration of my victory and a humble
recognition of my loss.
First, to address a possible loss: "Friends.
Indians, law students: I loved you! I loved
you like a brother! What were you think
ing." Did you even bother to ask my oppo
nents (one of which I can only assume was
the winner) where he or she was while I was
n't in "Nam"? In Canada draped in maple
leaves with Rick Moranis. I bet. And did it
cross your mind to dig through either or
both of their pasts to find scintillas of evi
dence of their high school relationships that
I bet were extra-marital? Or proof that they
drank alcohol illegally in college?!
Man. who am I kidding? I lost this elec
tion because of my own blunders. I'll admit I
made some mistakes on the campaign trail. I
didn't know how to respond when confront
ed with the oft the cuff riddle about whether
condoms stop the spread of sexually trans
mitted diseases. I mean, if a tree falls in the
woods, will a bear defecate there? Who's to
tell really? ...And as to that other thine, well.

I guess I didn't really clear my name with my
comment. "1 thought that the cop was there
to sell me a dime bag." C'est la vie.
Now to address the possibility of not los
inti:" 1 did it! YAY!!! Party at my place! If you
need directions, just call 867-5309. But don't
congratulate me. friends, congratulate your
selves because you just won the best president
that your monej did buy. The infamous
"Bridge to Nowhere" will have nothing on
the kinds of unjustifiable imitation-pork bar
rel pr<ijectsd'm a vegetarian.by the way) that
I let loose on the Law School. First project on
the agenda is a moving walkway from my
door to the Law School, with vary ing speeds
depending on how much time I have on my
hands. (Maybe in my second term. I'll add a
dome to protect against inclement weather.)
To be fair. I must give props to both of my
opponents. You stuck in the race even after
Gallup polls showed me leading significant
l\ among all three Stanford Law voting
blocs: the left, the center-left and the far-left.
You refused to say die even after I bugged
your convention. Swift Boated you and
posted a parody of Apple's "Big Brother"
commercial (starring you) on You Tube. I
can onl\ attribute my razor-slim margin of
victor\ as a broad, limitless mandate to im
plement the policies that at least one half of
you plus one voted for. I've been waiting
years to say this, and now I feel it's only ap
propriate: "I am the decider."
Well friends, either way. the people have
spoken Fhe votes have been counted, and
some worthy individual, whoever it is. will
be the new president of our Law Associa
tion. To my very worthy opponents who. it
stands to reason, either beat me or did not
beat me. I say kudos. I tip my hat to you, I
shake your hand and 1 look forward to
working with you in the coming year.

his celebration, drop him a line at
