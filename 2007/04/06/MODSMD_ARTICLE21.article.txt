# Letters to the Editor

### 
Student, anger thyself
I am writing in response to the generally
non-existent Letters to the Editor section in
your newspaper. Let me tell you a little story.
I was an undergraduate once. I remember
back when I opened The Stanford Daily
each day in eager anticipation of the angry,
ridiculous and occasionally insightful letters
to the editor. The self-righteous letters, the
feuds that continued from day to day. this
was the part of the paper I read without fail.
Now. a few years later. The Daily rarely
has any letters at all from disgruntled under
grade What gives? Are you undergraduates
apathetic, too busy or cynical already? Does
n't anyone want to voice their opinions, how
ever absurd, on Palestine. Stanford "living
wage" issues, the quality of the dining hall
food, bike tickets, laundry politics or whatev
er''
Jeez, youngsters. As a great man once
said: Lively up yourselves. No issue is too
small for The Daily! And Daily.doyour part
to get some reader input. Rustle up some
scandal, if that's what it takes! Start writing
some inflammatory editorials, if that's what
you need to do! (And writing about the gra
ciousness of wealthy alumni, as you did in a
recent issue.does not count.)
Stanford is becoming a little bit boring.
Jump on it.

Thesis solution underway
Yesterday s editorial ("Honors theses
merit saving") examined the problem of
storing senior honors theses, the capstones
to tour years of undergraduate education
and significant intellectual works.The edito
rial hoard worried that while the library
keeps some theses, many are no longer avail
able. It encouraged the University to find a
way to safeguard all honors theses for pos
terity.
Senior Theses are not alone in their vul
nerability. Large datasets, unpublished re
search and unpublished graduate papers —
while worth preserving—all risk falling
victim to the teeth of time. To address this
concern. Stanford University Library &
Academic Information Resources (SU
LAIR) has been building a Stanford Digital
Repository (SDR).The SDR is on target to
open this fall, and will serve as an archival
repository of any significant unpublished
work by Stanford students, faculty and re
searchers. including seniors honors theses.
The SDR is an innovative program de
signed to protect and make available impor
tant works and data forever; it will never
shut its virtual doors.

Theses already being preserved
As a senior writing an honors thesis
in history, I strongly agree in the impor
tance for the I Jniversity and faculty to
preserve senior theses. Unfortunately,
yesterday's editorial ("Honors theses
merit saving") provided only a superfi
cial examination of how theses are
saved at this university. The author(s)
did a Socrates search and found theses
from urban studies. IPS and human bi
ology. Assuming that these were the
only three departments which pre
served honors theses, the board there
by proceeded to make a blanket cri
tique of how all honors programs have
saved their students' work.
In actuality, departments make a
concerted effort to preserve theses. For
example, the 1 lumanities I lonors Pro
gram. Department of 1 listory and De
partment of English have preserved
honors theses since 1949, 1458 and

1963, respectively at Special Collec
tions in Green 1 .ibrary. A listing of their
theses can he found on Socrates. Not
only do departments preserve their
theses, but they make them easy to ob
tain. The Socrates listing for the De
partment of I hstory includes an online
finding aid, where a prospective honors
student can find the author, year and
title of every honors thesis written since
1958. For programs such as bnglish. a
student need only to go to Special C ol
lections to ltH)k at a hard-copy of their
finding aid. The Falconer Library has
copies of biology honors theses. In
other programs, such as CSRE. a stu
dent can visit the department office to
find where the program has preserved
previous theses. No "Indiana Jones
search." as the editorial board calls it. is
needed to uncover what any prospec
tive honors student can discover in a
short visit to their department or an on
line inquiry. Many of the reforms the
editorial board calls for have already
been enacted and utilized by students
(i.e., myself) writing an honors thesis.
