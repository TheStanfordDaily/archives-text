# Nice work if you can get it

Even before Felicity hooked up with
Noel, the life of a college RA was seen
as a privileged position. Holding kids'
heads over toilets, counseling heartbroken
residents through dormcest break-ups. and
knowing every last bit of house gossip —
what could be more glamorous than that?
In just a few short hours (or. if you have no
class on Fridays and get off to a late start, just
a few short hours ago), "regular decision'' RA
applications for the 2007-2008 school year are
due. If you've managed to miss all of the
emails and flyers and Daily ads that have blan
keted campus for the past few months, you can
forget turning in both a hard and a soft copy
today: your chance to irrevocably alter the
lives of the Class of 2011 and/or the face of
Residential Education has passed. If. howev
er.you've attended your required info session,
gathered letters of recommendation, and sub
tly conveyed your many interpersonal
strengths in your essays, you have just joined
the illustrious ranks of RA wannabes. With an
application process that rivals the Google job
hunt gauntlet (they often have five rounds of
interviews, not two) and a reward that lands
you not in a free Whole Foods-like mecca but
in Stern Dining, it's only natural to wonder:
What's in it for the applicant?
Of equal importance, at least for those
who believe in asking not what their univer
sitv can do for them, but what thev can do for

their university: Do you have what it takes?
Like many of you. I remember moving in
to my freshman dorm like it was yesterday.
As I dragged my suitcase toward what 1
hoped was the front of Larkin. a group of
matchingT-shirted people I'd never seen be
fore yelled my name at the top of their lungs.
While the others jumped around like lunatics
on speed, one of them ran toward me. flailing
his arms and offering to help me with my
bags. 1. logically, stopped dead in my tracks.
These are the Herculean individuals who,
even at 24.1 cannot rival in age or maturity.
Between the four of them, my freshman
RAs covered every Stanford stereotype. In
Upper West. Nate, the former class president,
reigned supreme. Born in a suit and tie hut
equally at ease in basketball shorts. Nate was
virtually engaged to his high school sweetheart
who.conveniently, was a student at Santa Clara.
Tall, dark and handsome, he landed a top con
sulting job in November of his senior year (long

before 1 knew what McKinsey. Bain or Mercer
meant) and had a close group of drawmates
who were featured in Stanford Magazine for
some impressive feat or another. From the get
go. ever> girl on his hallway gave the First Lady
glares: in May. one "accidentally" gave her a
black eye. but even that was not enough to de
stroy perfection — when Nate proposed at the
top of some gorgeous, snow-covered mountain
during our senior year, the story, and its verifi
cation of his Superman status, made the rounds.
Wherever his white-picket-fenced, three bed
room two bathroom home is. I'm sure he's per
fectly happy overseeing its house meetings.
Of course, not every RA so closely resem
bles the pre-fallen Gavin Newsom. A far cry
and two hallways away from Mr. Together.
Mike was the Stanford bubble's poster child —
with an emphasis on the latter. A Stanford Sier
ra Camp counselor and Band member. Mike
had more energy than the average second grad
er — which is good, because he's now teaching
a classroom full of them. As an RA. he organ
ized a four-square tournament and gleefully ac
companied us to Chuck E. Cheese, tequila
filled Camelback in tow. True to Stanford-lov
ing form. Mike stuck around for a coterm and,
last I checked, still lives with a group of fellow
SSC/Band alumni at the Executive Ranch of
Ridiculousness, a sliuhtlv older version of a
