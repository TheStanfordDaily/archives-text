# Thrown to the urban wolves
## 
### 
In the last four years. 1 have suckled hard
and fast on the teat of The Stanford Expe
rience. In the name of an elite education. I
have talked with the President of Latvia,
swum with seals, and bathed naked in hot
springs at a monastery. My experiences are
not unique: I know people who have been
flown to China, held video-conferences with
Audi reps and photographed penguins in
Antarctica, all on the Stanford dollar.
Yet as I look back on a recent adventure. I
find myself facing a cruel reality: Although
Stanford may excel at grooming its under
graduates to comfortably prowl the world of
privilege, there is one area in which our urban
brethren — Berkeley, Columbia and the like
— have us trumped: The Farm is quite possi
bly the world's worst place to learn street
smarts and urban savvy.
1 came to this conclusion after spending
Spring Break in Berlin in order to finish a re
search project from last summer. I forgot to
outline housing in my budget, so 1 crashed at
my friend Sara's for a few days. 'ITiis would
have been super if Sara lived in one of those
historic European apartments, with ox-eye
windows and faux-rococo molding along the
tops of the walls. However. Sara lived in a
converted cement factory with 14 of her
artist-type friends. When I explained my liv
ing situation to my Berkeley friends, every
one of them asked me if I was bringing pep
per spray. This should have been a clue.
When I arrived at the commune, a group
of five members were just on their way out.
Carrying large, plastic bags, they told me that
they were going bottle-hunting. My hosts ex
plained that they needed the recycling
money to buy dinner and "skag."
I consider my German to be pretty good, but
I had no idea what "skag" was — all I could tell
was that my hosts seemed infinitely more con

cerned about buying "skag" than eating that
night. I figured "skag" was some type of expen
sive art supply. I was excited to watch them work
with "skag" and maybe take some new artistic
knowledge back with me to the United States,
About two hours later, the artist-types re
turned with their groceries. Eagerly wanting to
bond. 1 asked to see the "skag." One of the men
in the group. Freddy, a late-20-something with
mini conch shells weaved into his dreadlocks,
laughed and pulled out a zip-lock bag with a
box of baking soda, a test tube and some stuff in
little bottles. I asked in German if "skag" was
like papier-mache. Everyone giggled. This is
when I finally began to get uncomfortable.
1 watched as Freddy brought out some
taupe-colored powder, and began an elabo
rate series of mixing it with the liquid in the
little bottles, then the baking soda, then again
with more stuff in little bottles.The bottom of
a coke can came out from someone's pocket,
then the Bunsen burner that earlier we'd used
to make tea was turned on. Freddy took off
his belt and looped it around his arm. I finally
got it: "Skag" meant heroin. I was about to
watch a circle of junkies get their fix.
I remember during my freshman year at
Stanford, people in my dorm went nuts when
some people made a gravity bong in the
courtyard.They said that they could smell the
smoke and that they were allergic to pot.
What would they do if they found themselves
in my situation — stuck in a junky circle in an
abandoned factory in Berlin?
The bucolic setting of our school is ideal
for incubating us against the harsh realities
of life. As a tour guide. I push our isolation as
a huge selling point for protective parents. I
like that my biggest fear at 3 a.m. on a Friday
is that 5-SURE will take forever and I might
have to walk the 10 minutes home in the Cal
ifornia cold.

However, at the moment when I found
myself stranded on a foreign continent with
artist-hobos cooking up heroin in front of
me. I sort of wished that I had experienced
something comparable in the safe and famil
iar confines of The Farm.
Obviously. I am not saying that people
should do more hard drugs at Stanford. It is
just a reality that Stanford students are kept
blessedly unaware of life's realities, while my
friends at Columbia had their RAs warn
them about pushers during week one of
school.
1 still think that our isolation from the real
world, accurately referred to as the Stanford
Hubble, is a precious and delightful part of The
Stanford Experience. The Bubble encircles
everything. It has followed me around the
world, keeping me safe in Latvia and warm in
the Rocky Mountains. The Bubble has let me
keep my innocence far longer than even my
parents thought possible.
Its just that as 1 look back on my time at
Stanford, I wonder how different it would
have been if I had experienced everything
with my newly-opened eyes. Certainly Poland
would have seemed less cheery. I suppose that
after a few weeks back in the Bubble, this
question will fade away from my mind, but
right now all 1 can think about is how I
thought that heroin was papier-mache.
