Neither Washington State (12-8. 1-4) nor Washington (3-14. 0-4)
have been particularly formidable this season.but the Stanford women,
winners of 12 straight matches, will still have to be ready.
"[Teams like Washington State and Washington] have both foreign

ers and American players — they definitely have dangerous players
high up in their lineup, and then it usually trails off." Burdette said. "As
always, we have to be on our toes and ready to go. hut we're looking for
a really decisive win."
Yelsey is looking forward to ending her home career on a high note
this Senior Weekend.
"It'll be a little sad because it's been four years and it doesn't feel like
it at all." she said. "It doesn't feel like it should be our last set of home
matches. It'll probably be sad. but we're going to have a really good time
with it."
