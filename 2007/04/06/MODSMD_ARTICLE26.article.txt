Over spring break, Stanford (3-21,2-1 (i
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) gave
No. 8 Cal State-Northridge some tough
competition before finally falling in four
(30-27. 30-23, 28-30, 30-22). Games one
and three were point for point, but the
Matadors edged their way to a game-one
victory, and the Cardinal fought its way to
a mid-game lead to clinch game three. But

Northridge took control in games two and
four, coming on strong midway through
each game to stuck and hold leads that
Stanford could not overcome.

Junior co-captain Matt Ceran led the
Cardinal.scoring 17 kills (.270) against the
Matadors, followed by freshman Kawika
Shojiwith 15 (.290) and Brandon Williams
with 12 on a match-high .667. Williams
also rained down three aces, while setter
Miki Groppi served up 46 assists. For
Northridge, Eric Vance scored 13 kills
along with a career-high six aces, but Dan
Rhodes led the Matadors with a match
high 21 kills.
After the Matador victory, the Cardi
nal traveled south to face No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara but was swept in three (30-25,30-
2b and 30-26). Ihe Gauchos led most of
the way through games one and two to se
cure the expected victory. Game three
proved to be much more exciting with
Stanford trailing by just a point or two
until UCSB scored four straight, building
a 27-19 lead to seal a Gaucho victory.
Pepperdine (21-1. 17-1 MPSF) comes
into tonight's contest riding a program

years, including team captain this
year. 1 can't say enough about how
much Brian means to this team. He

been a great asset to us this year. Both
the coaching staff and the players in
