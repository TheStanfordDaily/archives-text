# Gauging the Gators' greatness
## 
### 
With the Florida Gators'
back-to-back men's basket
ball championships, one
question remains: Are they the great
est of all time?
1 say yes.
Joakim Noah might not be the
most aesthetically pleasing guy, A 1
1 lorford showed that his dance moves
are a bit lacking and Lee Humphrey
looks like he belongs at a Nascar tail
gate instead of the Final Four — but
there's no denying Florida's status in
college-basketball history.
And I'm very aware of that history,
having grown up a UCLA-homer.
The Bruins won 10 titles under John
Wooden in a span of 12 seasons, in
cluding seven titles in a row at one
point. Surely, winning titles to the sev
enth power has to be more impressive
than just winning back-to-back.
But it was a different game back
then.
John Wooden's teams only had to
win four games to close out each sea
son when the tournament fields only
featured 16. Logistically speaking, the
tournament was two games easier to
win.
On top of this, a coach like John
Wooden never had to worry about his
players taking off before their senior
seasons. Although there were rare oc
currences when players left early for
the NBA, these were isolated cases.
Continuity was a huge factor in main
taining the Wooden Dynasty In the
Leßron James and O.J. Mayo era of
basketball, continuity is non-existent.
The Gators established continuity
in an age where there is none. Last
season's line-up featured three
would-be lottery picks, all of whom
chose to stay and win their second
title. I originally scoffed at their deci
sions when they said that they wanted
to "make history." I couldn't have
been more wrong.
UCLA's legacy under Wooden will
always be the greatest dynasty in col
lege basketball, and probably all of
major sports — there's no argument
against that. But. as for the greatest in
dividual team of all time, I'd take the
'06 and '07 Gators all day, every day.
Florida ripped through a top
heavy tournament field for the sec
ond year in a row, and they did it with
ease.There wasn't a single game in the
2007 tournament that was in doubt in
the last two minutes. In the Gators'
2006 run, Florida only had one close
call in its Sweet 16 match-up against
Georgetown.
Unlike the last repeat champion
(the '91 and '92 Duke squads) who
needed miracle shot after miracle
shot to march on, the Gators made it
look easy.
Basketball is a game of great vari
ance. If an underdog catches hot from
the three-point range, anything can
happen. The fact that Florida, for the


Jack
Salisbury
Above the Rim
most part, wasn't tested in the past
two tournaments only further argues
its supremacy
On the court, the Gators' lineup
was nearly flawless. Big-men Noah.
Horford and Chris Richard comple
mented their backcourt counterparts
better than any trio I've ever seen.
Perimeter players Humphrey and
Green were money when they need
ed to be. and 6-foot-9 swingman
Corey Brewer epitomized versatility.
There's no way that lineup could
have been any better. It featured
everything: outside shooting, dribble
penetration, a powerful post game
and stingy defense. If I could add any
player in all of college basketball to
the Gators' starting line-up, I'm not
sure I would. That's how well they
worked together.
In every game 1 saw the Gators
play in the tournament, the score al
ways felt like it wasn't indicative of
the flow of the game. That is to say,
some of the contests may have been
close, but Florida was just toying with
its opponents. When push came to
shove. I lumphrey and Brewer would
often execute back-breaking hlows
with their deadly outside shooting.
I usually don't praise a team this
much. I feel like a sycophant talking
about these Gators, but I just can't
help myself.
But of course. Joakim Noah is still
the most hateable person in the histo
ry of college athletics. Not even the
most impressive run in modern col
lege basketball could remedy that.

Jack Salisbury is a freshman who has
obviously been swept off his feet by
Joakim Noah's charm anil devilishly
good looks. Let him know what you
think at iack24Q'Stanford, edit.
