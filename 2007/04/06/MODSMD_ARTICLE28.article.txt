# Gauging the Gators' greatness
## 
### 
With the Florida Gators'
back-to-back men's basket
ball championships, one
question remains: Are they the great
est of all time?
1 say yes.
Joakim Noah might not be the
most aesthetically pleasing guy, A 1
1 lorford showed that his dance moves
are a bit lacking and Lee Humphrey
looks like he belongs at a Nascar tail
gate instead of the Final Four — but
there's no denying Florida's status in
college-basketball history.
And I'm very aware of that history,
having grown up a UCLA-homer.
The Bruins won 10 titles under John
Wooden in a span of 12 seasons, in
cluding seven titles in a row at one
point. Surely, winning titles to the sev
enth power has to be more impressive
than just winning back-to-back.
But it was a different game back
then.
John Wooden's teams only had to
win four games to close out each sea
son when the tournament fields only
featured 16. Logistically speaking, the
tournament was two games easier to
win.
On top of this, a coach like John
Wooden never had to worry about his
players taking off before their senior
seasons. Although there were rare oc
currences when players left early for
the NBA, these were isolated cases.
Continuity was a huge factor in main
taining the Wooden Dynasty In the
Leßron James and O.J. Mayo era of
basketball, continuity is non-existent.
The Gators established continuity
in an age where there is none. Last
season's line-up featured three
would-be lottery picks, all of whom
chose to stay and win their second
title. I originally scoffed at their deci
sions when they said that they wanted
to "make history." I couldn't have
been more wrong.
UCLA's legacy under Wooden will
always be the greatest dynasty in col
lege basketball, and probably all of
major sports — there's no argument
against that. But. as for the greatest in
dividual team of all time, I'd take the
'06 and '07 Gators all day, every day.
Florida ripped through a top
heavy tournament field for the sec
ond year in a row, and they did it with
ease.There wasn't a single game in the
2007 tournament that was in doubt in
the last two minutes. In the Gators'
2006 run, Florida only had one close
call in its Sweet 16 match-up against
Georgetown.
Unlike the last repeat champion
(the '91 and '92 Duke squads) who
needed miracle shot after miracle
shot to march on, the Gators made it
look easy.
Basketball is a game of great vari
ance. If an underdog catches hot from
the three-point range, anything can
happen. The fact that Florida, for the
