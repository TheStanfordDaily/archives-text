## INSIDE THE RUSH PROCESS ISC sororities to begin recruitment next week Sisters explain rush process 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
By Tuesday, some 200 girls will
have chosen to begin the four-day
sorority rush process.They will sign
up to spend their weekend meeting
dozens of sorority members and
engaging in hundreds of brief con
versations. They will use each inter
action to assess the sororities and
the Greek system as a whole, decid
ing if they want to spend the rest of
their college years with one group
of girls. And they will be judged in
turn.
Rush begins in earnest on Fri
day. Apr. 13. ITie girls, who will have
all registered online and paid a $20
fee by the Tuesday deadline, will
head to the second floor of Tresid
der. There they will be re-

quired to attend parties —
social gatherings without
alcohol — hosted by each

of the five sororities who
are part of the process:
1/ AUUm

Kappa Alpha Ineta,
Kappa Kappa
n n: n.4,.

Gamma, Pi Beta
Phi. Chi Omega
and Delta Delta

Delta. The
events are not
hosted at soror
ity houses in

order to avoid discriminating
against Kappa Kappa Gamma and
Chi Omega, which are unhoused.

Each party will generally consist
of many knots of girls chatting with
current members of the sorority,
asking questions about the sorority
and making small talk. Lindsay
Schauer '07. a former member of
Kappa Alpha Theta, described the
parties as organized chaos.
"It's actually sort of a planned
job interview process," she said.
"You walk in and you meet a cou
ple of people who are in the sorori
ty, and you get to ask them ques
tions about their sorority. And they
also ask you questions. You meet as
many people as you can in the
sorority, and the people in the
sorority try to meet as many
rushees as they can. So it's multiple
little interviews going on all the

time in the form of casual conversa
tion."
The rushees cycle through the
parties in groups, with one group
leaving for the next sorority as an
other enters. After all the girls have
visited all the parties, the sorority
members settle down for a long
night. Each sorority must decide
which girls it is going to invite back
for the next day.They each use differ
ent methods, including discussion,
silent voting or a ballot process, and
then send the results to the lnter
sorority Council (ISC), which organ
izes rush for these five sororities.
Stanford has six other sororities
aside from those in the ISC: Alpha
Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta
are members of the African Ameri
can Fraternal and Sororal Associa
tion. and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi,
Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta
and Sigma ITieta Psi belong to the
Multicultural Greek Council.
ITie rush process for these sorori
ties is somewhat different. For exam
ple. Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and
Sigma Psi Zeta have hosted several
events over the past week to distrib
ute information and meet potential
new members in a fun atmosphere.
Ciirls rushing Alpha Kappa Delta
Phi are guaranteed interviews if they
attend at least two events and one in
formation session. According to An
gela Cheng'o9. bids to join the sorority
are given Monday, Apr. 15 at midnight,
and the girls have 24 hours to decide
whether they will accept this bid.
"ISC's events start Tuesday, so the
timing lets them attend an ISC event,
so they can experience what other
sororities have to offer," Cheng said.
"We don't want to make them com
mit if they haven't tried other op
tions."
Schauer explained that sororities
are not looking for any characteris

tics in particular.
"There's no meeting saying 'This
is what we want in our girls,'" she said.
"The members are basically looking
for people that they would want to be
friends with. And for every person in
each sorority, that's a different type of
person, which is why you get diverse
classes in each sorority."
Jennifer Hernandez *07, ISC Pres
ident, explained that each house
must invite a certain number of girls
back, depending on the total number
of rushees.
"They give us a list — these are the
girls that we want to invite back —
and there's a little gray area of girls
that they might want back depending
on the quota for that night," she said.
"We don't really know: it's kind of a
number crunch for us on our side."
A junior sorority member, who
wished to remain anonymous in
order to avoid violating national
chapter rules, explained that girls
should not feel insulted if they're not
invited back.
"Unfortunately, rush is often bi
ased towards girls who can make a
good impression in a few brief con
versations," she said. "Sometimes
these conversations have little to do
with the actual quality of the person,
as many great people are shy in this
intimidating setting."
The rushees then come back to
Tresidder thejiext morning to find
out how many parties they have been
invited to that day.They can only at
tend four parties on the second day,
so if they have been invited to five
they must decide which sorority's
event they will not attend.
On Saturday. Apr. 14, the process
will be repeated. Each girl must at
tend all of the parties to which she
was invited, up to a maximum of
four, and stay at each one for a longer
period of time. After the events end.

there is another round of selection.
The next night, the girls can only at
tend a maximum of three parties. On
the second night, each sorority per
forms skits for the prospective mem
bers, and. on the third night, they dis
cuss their philanthropic activities.
The final night. Preference Night,
is held at the Sheraton and is a
calmer, more formal event. Many
girls have dropped out by this time or
have not been invited back. But if a
rushee makes it to Preference Night,
she is assured a bid at a sorority. At
this point, the girl can only attend, at
most, two sororities' events. After
wards, she will list the sororities in
order of her preference. The sorori
ties will then rank the girls that they
have under consideration, and the
two sets of preferences are tabulated
late at night. Each girl will receive an
offer of membership, called a bid,
from only one sorority.
The next day, Apr. 16th, the girl
will go back to Tresidder one last
time to pick up her bid. Upon open
ing the envelope, she will discover
the name of the sorority and can
choose to accept or reject the bid.
Rush is over.
"I think everyone who's done it
will agree that it's really exhausting,"
Schauer said. "Everyone is trying to
impress everybody. By the second or
third day, your face hurts from smil
ing so much, and you're tired of an
swering and asking the same ques
tions to everyone. Like any sort of in
terview process, it gets tiring once
you do it 20 times."
The sorority rush process is essen
tially the same at every school. The
rules for rush are laid down by the Na
tional Pan-Hellenic Council, a body
that sets guidelines for fraternities.

also ask you questions. You meet as
many people as you can in the
sorority, and the people in the
sorority try to meet as many
rushees as they can. So it's multiple
little interviews going on all the

time in the form of casual conversa
tion."
The rushees cycle through the
parties in groups, with one group
leaving for the next sorority as an
other enters. After all the girls have
visited all the parties, the sorority
members settle down for a long
night. Each sorority must decide
which girls it is going to invite back
for the next day.They each use differ
ent methods, including discussion,
silent voting or a ballot process, and
then send the results to the lnter
sorority Council (ISC), which organ
izes rush for these five sororities.
Stanford has six other sororities
aside from those in the ISC: Alpha
Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta
are members of the African Ameri
can Fraternal and Sororal Associa
tion. and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi,
Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta
and Sigma ITieta Psi belong to the
Multicultural Greek Council.
ITie rush process for these sorori
ties is somewhat different. For exam
ple. Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and
Sigma Psi Zeta have hosted several
events over the past week to distrib
ute information and meet potential
new members in a fun atmosphere.
Ciirls rushing Alpha Kappa Delta
Phi are guaranteed interviews if they
attend at least two events and one in
formation session. According to An
gela Cheng'o9. bids to join the sorority
are given Monday, Apr. 15 at midnight,
and the girls have 24 hours to decide
whether they will accept this bid.
"ISC's events start Tuesday, so the
timing lets them attend an ISC event,
so they can experience what other
sororities have to offer," Cheng said.
"We don't want to make them com
mit if they haven't tried other op
tions."
Schauer explained that sororities
are not looking for any characteris

tics in particular.
"There's no meeting saying 'This
is what we want in our girls,'" she said.
"The members are basically looking
for people that they would want to be
friends with. And for every person in
each sorority, that's a different type of
person, which is why you get diverse
classes in each sorority."
Jennifer Hernandez *07, ISC Pres
ident, explained that each house
must invite a certain number of girls
back, depending on the total number
of rushees.
"They give us a list — these are the
girls that we want to invite back —
and there's a little gray area of girls
that they might want back depending
on the quota for that night," she said.
"We don't really know: it's kind of a
number crunch for us on our side."
A junior sorority member, who
wished to remain anonymous in
order to avoid violating national
chapter rules, explained that girls
should not feel insulted if they're not
invited back.
"Unfortunately, rush is often bi
ased towards girls who can make a
good impression in a few brief con
versations," she said. "Sometimes
these conversations have little to do
with the actual quality of the person,
as many great people are shy in this
intimidating setting."
The rushees then come back to
Tresidder thejiext morning to find
out how many parties they have been
invited to that day.They can only at
tend four parties on the second day,
so if they have been invited to five
they must decide which sorority's
event they will not attend.
On Saturday. Apr. 14, the process
will be repeated. Each girl must at
tend all of the parties to which she
was invited, up to a maximum of
four, and stay at each one for a longer
period of time. After the events end.

there is another round of selection.
The next night, the girls can only at
tend a maximum of three parties. On
the second night, each sorority per
forms skits for the prospective mem
bers, and. on the third night, they dis
cuss their philanthropic activities.
The final night. Preference Night,
is held at the Sheraton and is a
calmer, more formal event. Many
girls have dropped out by this time or
have not been invited back. But if a
rushee makes it to Preference Night,
she is assured a bid at a sorority. At
this point, the girl can only attend, at
most, two sororities' events. After
wards, she will list the sororities in
order of her preference. The sorori
ties will then rank the girls that they
have under consideration, and the
two sets of preferences are tabulated
late at night. Each girl will receive an
offer of membership, called a bid,
from only one sorority.
The next day, Apr. 16th, the girl
will go back to Tresidder one last
time to pick up her bid. Upon open
ing the envelope, she will discover
the name of the sorority and can
choose to accept or reject the bid.
Rush is over.
"I think everyone who's done it
will agree that it's really exhausting,"
Schauer said. "Everyone is trying to
impress everybody. By the second or
third day, your face hurts from smil
ing so much, and you're tired of an
swering and asking the same ques
tions to everyone. Like any sort of in
terview process, it gets tiring once
you do it 20 times."
The sorority rush process is essen
tially the same at every school. The
rules for rush are laid down by the Na
tional Pan-Hellenic Council, a body
that sets guidelines for fraternities.

By Tuesday, some 200 girls will
have chosen to begin the four-day
sorority rush process.They will sign
up to spend their weekend meeting
dozens of sorority members and
engaging in hundreds of brief con
versations. They will use each inter
action to assess the sororities and
the Greek system as a whole, decid
ing if they want to spend the rest of
their college years with one group
of girls. And they will be judged in
turn.
Rush begins in earnest on Fri
day. Apr. 13. ITie girls, who will have
all registered online and paid a $20
fee by the Tuesday deadline, will
head to the second floor of Tresid
der. There they will be re-

quired to attend parties —
social gatherings without
alcohol — hosted by each

of the five sororities who
are part of the process:
1/ AUUm

Kappa Alpha Ineta,
Kappa Kappa
n n: n.4,.

Gamma, Pi Beta
Phi. Chi Omega
and Delta Delta

Delta. The
events are not
hosted at soror
ity houses in

order to avoid discriminating
against Kappa Kappa Gamma and
Chi Omega, which are unhoused.

Each party will generally consist
of many knots of girls chatting with
current members of the sorority,
asking questions about the sorority
and making small talk. Lindsay
Schauer '07. a former member of
Kappa Alpha Theta, described the
parties as organized chaos.
"It's actually sort of a planned
job interview process," she said.
"You walk in and you meet a cou
ple of people who are in the sorori
ty, and you get to ask them ques
tions about their sorority. And they
also ask you questions. You meet as
many people as you can in the
sorority, and the people in the
sorority try to meet as many
rushees as they can. So it's multiple
