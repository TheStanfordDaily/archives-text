# No. 1 women looking for sweet 16
## 
### 
With just over a month remaining in
the 2007 campaign, the Stanford
women's water polo team will kick
things into high gear this weekend by
opening its spring schedule on the road

against UC-lrvine ;ind Kong Beach
State.
The top-ranked Cardinal (17-1. (i-O
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
has not competed in nearly two weeks,
but the squad has already showed that
it is more than capable of handling ex
tended periods without competition.

After a three-week break in their
schedule for Dead Week and finals, the
Stanford women returned to the pool
in dominant form, posting three con
secutive victories by margins of 14
goals or more.
Stanford enters the weekend riding
the momentum of a 15-game winning
streak spanning two months — the
Cardinal's one and only loss this sea
son came on Feb. 3 against rival South
ern California in the Stanford Invita
tional.
Since that time, however, the Stan
lord women have emerged to claim the
top spot in I he national rankings in
convincing fashion. The Cardinal
knocked off the Women ofTroy, 10-8,
in conference play on Feb. 17 and then
repeated the feat a week later at the
Irvine Invitational to earn a spot in the
tournament title match. ITiere the
Stanford women upset defending na
tional champion UCLA 8-4 to take the
No. I ranking for the first time since
2003.
The Cardinal defense, always the
foundation of the team's past success,
has continued to shine this season.
After limiting its opponents to an aver
age of just 4.67 goals per game during
the month of March, Stanford now av
erages 5.50 goals allowed per game, the

Allison Gregorka and the Cardinal will look to defend their No. 1 ranking
this weekend as they travel to face UC-Irvine and Long Beach State. Gregorka re

against the pair of East-Coast
squads that visited the Farm two
weeks ago, recording four-goal
games against Princeton and Mary
land en route to a l()-goal weekend.
Silver, who has scored in every one
of the Cardinal's games this season,
currently stands tied for third in the
conference scoring rankings.
First up for the Stanford women
this weekend will be No. 4 Irvine
(15-6.3-4). as the two teams square
off at the Anteater Aquatics Com
plex. this evening at 5 p.m. The
Anteaters have won their last five
games to rebound from a heart
breaking overtime loss to then-No. 4
California. Irvine took over the No.
4 spot in the rankings earlier this
week as a result of the Bears' upset
loss at the hands of then-No. 7
Hawaii. Senior two-meter defender
Jackie Prine leads the Anteaters
with 30 goals, including 10 in the

team's last five contests. Junior Lau
ren Machanis has been steady in the
cage for Irvine this season, having
made 155 saves thus far. the sixth
most in the MPSF.
On Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal faces No. 17 Long Beach State
(6-12.2-5), who has battled through
a tough schedule as of late. After los
ing seven straight, the 49ers finally
managed to put an end to their skid
by upsetting No. 12 UC-Santa Bar
bara, 8-7, earlier this week. The
Long Beach State offense takes the
form of a balanced attack, as four
members of the squad have netted
20 goals or more this season.
This weekend will also serve as a
competitive "tune-up" opportunity
for Stanford, which returns for its
biggest remaining home game of the
season next weekend against No. 2
UCLA. The Cardinal host the Bru
ins on Saturday, Apr. 14 in what
promises to be an explosive show
down between two of the top con
tenders for this year's NCAA title.
