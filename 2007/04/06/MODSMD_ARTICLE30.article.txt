### 
With just over a month remaining in
the 2007 campaign, the Stanford
women's water polo team will kick
things into high gear this weekend by
opening its spring schedule on the road

against UC-lrvine ;ind Kong Beach
State.
The top-ranked Cardinal (17-1. (i-O
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
has not competed in nearly two weeks,
but the squad has already showed that
it is more than capable of handling ex
tended periods without competition.

After a three-week break in their
schedule for Dead Week and finals, the
Stanford women returned to the pool
in dominant form, posting three con
secutive victories by margins of 14
goals or more.
Stanford enters the weekend riding
the momentum of a 15-game winning
streak spanning two months — the
Cardinal's one and only loss this sea
son came on Feb. 3 against rival South
ern California in the Stanford Invita
tional.
Since that time, however, the Stan
lord women have emerged to claim the
top spot in I he national rankings in
convincing fashion. The Cardinal
knocked off the Women ofTroy, 10-8,
in conference play on Feb. 17 and then
repeated the feat a week later at the
Irvine Invitational to earn a spot in the
tournament title match. ITiere the
Stanford women upset defending na
tional champion UCLA 8-4 to take the
No. I ranking for the first time since
2003.
The Cardinal defense, always the
foundation of the team's past success,
has continued to shine this season.
After limiting its opponents to an aver
age of just 4.67 goals per game during
the month of March, Stanford now av
erages 5.50 goals allowed per game, the
