## Women's golf readies for final stretch 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off its best finish of the
spring season, the No. Stanford
women's golf team hopes to carry its
momentum back home for the Peg
Barnard Invitational this weekend.
The tournament will be held at the
par-71. 6,030-yard Stanford Golf
Course, today and tomorrow.
Stanford will play host to 12 other
teams as UC-Davis, Hawaii. Fresno
State. Denver, Eastern Washington,
Long Beach State, San Francisco,
Oregon State, Portland State. San
Jose State. Washington State and
Santa Clara visit the Farm. The field,
as head coach Caroline O'Connor ac
knowledges. is not the star-studded
opposition found during previous
tournaments.
"This field isn't nearly as strong as
any of the other portions we've
played all year," O'Connor said.
"When you look at our rank of sched
ule, we have the toughest-ranked
schedule in the country."

GAMf NOTES: As the season winds down for
the No. 9 Cardinal, Stanford's seniors will
have one last chance to make a strong im
pression on their home course before open
ing post-season play. But sophomore Mori
Chun is the Cardinal golfer currently swing
ing the hottest club. Chun finished second
individually at last weekend's PING ASU In
vitational, just two strokes behind the overall
leader.
I lowever. O'Connor believes that
this is not a time to let up. especially
during the Cardinal's last tourney be
fore the postseason.
" Ibis is definitely a weaker field,
but there are certain things we want
to accomplish as a team," she said.
"We're going out and trying to beat
par. We have certain goals and objec-
lives that don't necessarily relate to
the field."
Playing at home is certainly an
other advantage in the Cardinal's
favor.This will he the second tourna
ment on the Stanford Golf Course, ai
it follows the Stanford Intercolle
giate last October. In the Intercolle
giate, senior Lauren Todd led the
Cardinal attack with a third-place in
dividual finish.
"We always love playing at
home," O'Connor said. "This is one
of the best golf courses in the country'
and we feel really comfortable here.
In the past. Lauren had a great tour
nament here in the fall and she's
looking to go out and improve upon
that."
Stanford is entering the Invite
with some momentum of its own.
Last weekend, the squad tied for
sixth at the PING ASU Invitational
in Tempe. Ariz, .and sophomore Mari
Chun finished second individually,
lust two strokes behind the leader.
The win marked Stanford best plac
ing of the spring season, which had
been marred by some earlier sloppy
play.
"We're in a good place right now,"
O'Connor said. "We had a stretch of

tournaments where we didn't play
great, but we've had a good year.
Everyone's frame of mind is very
positive moving into this weekend."
Of Stanford's players, Chun should
be especially positive headed into this
weekend. Though she has played
below expectations for most of spring.
Chun's second-place finish suggests
that her troubles are behind her —
very good news for the Cardinal.
"Maris strong play is very impor
tant to the team," O'Connor said.
"[Seniors] Lauren and Jennifer
(Tangtiphaiboontana) have played
so well and consistently all season.
It's nice to see Mari step back up and
play well again. It's absolutely what
we expected from her, and I antici
pate that it will continue for the rest
of the spring."
Chun's resurgence inTempe came
with an uncharacteristic perform
ance by Tangtiphaiboontana.
Tangtiphaiboontana notched unex
pectedly elevated scores on all three
rounds of play, despite leading the
team for most of the spring season.
Still. O'Connor expresses the utmost
confidence in one of her team's lead
ers.
"Jennie struggled a little with that
golf course," O'Connor said. "It's
been a course that has not set up well
for her. and where all four years she
has not been able to dominate. She'll
bounce back — she's feeling good
and she has a good frame of mind."

Last year. Southern California
and Irene Choswept the team and in
dividual fields, while Stanford fin
ished third overall.The Cardinal last
won the tourney in 2(XM. and will
look to reclaim the title after a two
year drought on its home field.
"We've had a great week out on
the golf course, and we've had some
good practices," O'Connor said.'im
portantly, we feel comfortable
around the green, which is going to
he key. It's nice to play at home and
have home-court advantage. We're
looking forward to the weekend."
As the last tournament before
postseason play, the Stanford squad
is looking for a final tune-up. ITie
event will also serve as a final home
farewell to the Cardinal seniors.
Tangtiphaiboontana, Todd. Saana
Rapakko and Jenna Seki.
"Our seniors feel like they can
come out and have a fantastic event,"
O'Connor said. "We want to go out
and win this one at home to have con
fidence going into the postseason."
