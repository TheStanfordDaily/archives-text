### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONNTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford softball team
dropped a 3-0 decision to archrival
California last night at the Boyd and
Jill Smith Family Stadium.The match
was a pitcher's duel for four shutout
innings until a costly three-run
homer blew the game open.
Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
took the loss, only her third of the
year. Despite a 1.53 ERA on the sea
son. Penna has given up nine home
runs, including last night's to leadoff
hitter Alex Sutton following a visit to
the mound by Stanford's pitching
coach.
Penna pitched a complete game

with seven strikeouts, six of them in
the first three innings. However, the
team got quite a scare when a sixth
inning liner by Bernice Masaniai hit
Penna in the circle. Freshman catch
er Rosey Neill threw out the runner,
and Penna stayed in the game.
Opposite Penna was Cal pitcher
Lauren Frankiewicz. who pitched a
three-hitter against the potent Cardi
nal offense. Stanford (26-8.2-2 Pacif
ic* 10 Conference) threatened the
Bears in the second inning with run
ners on second and third, but
Frankiewicz struck out junior Tricia
Aggabao to end the inning. From
that point on. the Cardinal was un
able to advance a runner past first
base.

Cal (24-9. 1-3) also outplayed
Stanford offensively, gaining a 5-3
advantage in hits. The only Cardinal
players to get hits in the game were
freshman Alissa llaber, junior
Michelle Smith and Penna. All Stan
ford base hits were singles.
Stanford is now 17-27 all-time
against Cal: last year, however. Stan
ford similarly dropped its first deci
sion before moving on to take the
season series 2-1.
Despite playing on its home field,
the Cardinal was faced with a crowd
full of Cal fans. During the later in
nings of the game, California cheers
drowned out any Stanford support,
which undoubtedly made a come
back all the more difficult.
Fortunately, the Cardinal won't
have to wait long for revenge. Stan
ford is slated for two more games at
Cal this weekend, today at 3 p.m.
and tomorrow at 1 p.m. These will
mark the last matchups between the
two rivals for the regular season.
