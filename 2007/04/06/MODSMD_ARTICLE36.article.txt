## Graduate?' Galm down, we mean the movie! 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION JOB SEEKER 
Al the end of this quarter, Stanford's se
niors will be thrust out into the "real world."
In anticipation of this. Intermission is revisit
ing one of the most beloved movies that deals
with moving on from college: "The Gradu
ate" (1967).
Ask my housemate what his favorite mo
ment in graduate school was, and he'll proba
bly tell you it was the time he quoted "The
Graduate" to rapturous applause. He was in a
physics seminar at the time, and the guest
speaker, a flustered Cuban professor, said to
his audience that he could explain an impor
tant point in his talk with just "one word."
Madly searching through his slides, the speak
er reminded his listeners that he needed just
"one word." "One word." After an apprecia
ble delay, my housemate called out "plastics."
The professors in the room fell about laugh
ing.
The line my housemate is quoting comes
near the beginning of director Mike Nichols'
much revered classic. Benjamin Braddock
(Dustin Hoffman) has returned home from
college and his very square parents have
thrown him a party to celebrate his success. At
the party, a family friend pulls Benjamin aside
and says, "1 just want to say one word to you
— just one word: Plastics. There's a great fu
ture in plastics. Think about it. Will you think
about it?"
The line, one of Hollywood's most famous,
quickly establishes Benjamin's low opinion of

his parents' friends and bolsters his desire to
do something "different" with his future. It's a
telling moment in the movie, but. nowadays, it
says more about how much the film has dated
than about Benjamin's character.
I like "The Graduate." I think it's a good
movie. But I don't think it's a great one. Ben
jamin's affair with an older family friend, Mrs.
Robinson (Anne Bancroft), is full of funny
scenes and witty dialogue. His seductress's
vengeful relationship with her daughter
Elaine (Katharine Ross) is also well-played.
But the film is hampered by things that I sim
ply cannot appreciate. Hoffman is too expres
sionless to be appealing, and he looks far too
old to be playing a 20-year-old. (He was actu
ally 30 when the film was shot; Bancroft was
only 6 years older!) And Benjamin's relation
ship with Elaine makes absolutely no sense to
me, partly because it's given little time to
breathe and partly because Elaine seems so
uninteresting. Benjamin falls in love instantly,
and the object of his affection decides to
marry someone else in roughly the same time
frame.
Actually, what annoys me most about the
film is that it doesn't have much to say, and it
doesn't seem to go anywhere. (It certainly
doesn't offer upcoming college graduates any
useful advice.) If the film's ending is uplifting,
it's not because Benjamin has sorted out his
future. It's only because he's stuck it to some
"oldies." Perhaps this sort of gesture was ap
plauded at the time? This is certainly the sen
timent of critic Roger Ebert, who writes in a
1997 (luke-warm) review of the movie that it

came "out of a specific time in the late 1960s
when parents stood for stodgy middle-class
values, and 'the kids' were joyous rebels." I'm
guessing that my housemate's physics semi
nar was filled with professors from this gen
eration.
Is it fair for me to criticize the film for not
addressing the source of Benjamin's malaise
or for not really going anywhere? Maybe.

Noah Bambusch's "Kicking and Scream
ing," another movie about moving on
from college (or, more precisely, not

moving on from college) doesn't really
go anywhere either. But 4
it never really cre-

the
rJ r J I \ r'l TIWr 1
LlJirlJ JJI

ates the sense that
it will. It always

seems content to have its characters ex
change witty banter and populate
scenes with little momentum or
purpose.
"The Graduate" is shown at
Stanford Flicks each year at the
end of Spring quarter as a sendoff for seniors.
This year it will be shown on Sunday, June 3.

The movie has a great first half and is worth see- _
ing for this alone. And, honestly, how many op-1
portunities do you get to mark the end of col-1
lege with a screening ofl

"The Graduate?" Never-1
theless, I wish the movie
had a better second half
— one that didn't age so
poorly, one that made I
sense, and one that I
I went somewhere.
