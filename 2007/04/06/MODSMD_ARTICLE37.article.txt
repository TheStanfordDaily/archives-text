# Spring break: If you need a quick reminder of its glory
## 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION SPRING BREAKER 
To choose some of the best spring break movies out there,
we must first obviously define what constitutes one. Thus, I have
developed a list of 10 criteria:
L Your mind must not be taxed in any way to understand
what's going on. I worked hard enough during winter quarter.
This means no foreign films, no confusing out-of-order time se
quences, no movies that mix reality and fantasy without in
forming the viewer, no super-complex plots, etc. Basically, you
should not finish a spring break movie thinking to yourself,
"Boy, that was thought-provoking." If you do, you're watching
the wrong kind of movie.
2. A setting in a known vacation city (Miami, Las Vegas, etc.) is
good. Foreign countries can be even better (but sometimes go
awry: "Babel" had foreign countries — not a spring break
movie).
3. A subplot involving romance helps. Who doesn't want to find
love during spring break?

4. Stars must be under the age of 30, or at least very attractive.
5. Absolutely no tears must be shed (unless they come from
laughter). Anything remotely sad or depressing is out.
6. Somewhat surprisingly, the words "spring break" should
probably not appear in the title. A search on IMDB with these
words reveals a bunch of "Girls Gone Wild" videos, some TV
movie entitled, "Spring Break: Shark Attack," "The Real Can
cun" (a blink-and-you-missed-it movie version of "The Real
World") and an '80s movie called "Spring Break." Granted, I
have not seen any of these, but I have a feeling in my gut that
they are all terrible. (Some claim that "Spring Break" is a clas
sic, but, with an IMDB rating of only 2.6/10 — and I generally
agree with those ratings — I am skeptical).
7. Visible road trips or plane flights arc excellent.
8. Presence of parties, alcohol and related fare is expected.
9. Spring break movies won't have won Academy Awards (or
any awards whatsoever). Movies which have would probably
contradict#!.

10. A movie can still be classified as a spring break movie even
if some of rules one through nine are violated (but not too
many) if watching it makes you happy; as we all know, that's the
true purpose of spring break!
Using the criteria above, here are some of my movie sugges
tions:
1. Cocktail — This is not regarded as Tom Cruise's best
work by any standards, but he goes to Jamaica, learns to mix
drinks with flair and falls in love. It's everyone's dream spring
break tale!
2. Zoolander — This is among my favorite comedies. It gets
funnier with every viewing and. in my opinion, is simply bril
liant. Ben Stiller makes even death — normal spring break
taboo — hilarious (freak gasoline fight accident, anyone?). It
also includes at least a hundred quotable lines.
3. Old School — I thought that some Will Ferrell movie
should be on this list ("Zoolander" doesn't count), and this is
probably his best one. This movie capitalizes on #8 from the cri
teria list.
4. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castel-Two stoned boys

damon,etc is not violated

to lears watching this one.
