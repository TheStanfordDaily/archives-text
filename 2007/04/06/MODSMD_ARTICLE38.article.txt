## Kan Zeman: Mmm, falafel-ful 
### DANATURKER INTERMISSION ZEWOMAN 
As I walked into Kan Zcman on Saturday night,
the funky Middle Eastern music and the Mediter
ranean paintings on the walls made me hungry for my
for my favorite Mediterranean dish — falafel. 1 ab
solutely adore falafel, but, unfortunately, I've had
problems finding good falafel in the area. It's not that
great at Olives Cafe on campus, and it's just decent at
Cafe 220 on University Avenue. Desperate to find
good falafel and hummus, I searched online for
Mediterranean restaurants in Palo Alto, and 1 decid
ed to give Kan Zeman on University Drive a shot.
After all, one more bad falafel ball wouldn't hurt me.
But at Kan Zeman, I found a falafel that's actually up
to my expectations and worth talking about; it was
more than just your average ball of fried chick peas.
With the perfect number of people eating at the
restaurant (not enough people that I had to wait for a
table, but a sufficient crowd for me to have some con
fidence that this restaurant would be worth il) my
hungry stomach was eager for me to sit down. To my
delight, before I could even take off my jacket, the
waiters brought over hot pita bread and a delicious
olive oil dipping sauce with a hint of oregano. Since
one of my pet peeves is waiting at a restaurant and not
getting any bread until the meal is almost ready (who
wants bread then?), Kan Zeman and I hit it off from
the very beginning.
Tempted to just get the Falafel Plate, 1 decided to
go for something with a little more variety (but still in
cluding falafel. of course). For $9.99, the Vegetarian
Combo I ordered came with a choice of Caesar salad
or lentil soup and falafel, hummus, tabouleh, baba
ghanoush, dolma and Mediterranean salad. Although
I personally was not a huge fan of the lentil soup, it
was a huge hit with my friends who devoured it. In the
typical "I like what you ordered better" scenario, 1 re
ally enjoyed the Caesar salad my other friends or
dered. which came with crunchy homemade crouton
crisps and a light Caesar dressing. After my last sip of
soup, the meal came out — perfect timing.
Overall, the plate was a success. The hummus was

really good and of perfect consistency. In fact, as a testimo
ny to its deliciousness, my friend licked every last bit off her
plate (even eating it plain at one point). The baba ghanoush.
a mix of eggplant, sesame seeds, olive oil and lemon, was
amazing; its lightly smoky taste made it the perfect compli
ment to the unlimited pita bread. The Mediterranean salad
was decent, though it did have a disproportional number of
peppers compared to cucumbers and tomatoes. The
tabouleh, a salad of cracked wheat, tomatoes, onions, and
parsley, was fresh and healthy, but — unless you're a
tabouleh fanatic — there's no way you could finish all of the
huge serving. Last but not least, the falafel. The falafel balls
were actually delicious. They were perfect in crispiness, size
and taste. The only big complaint I had was that there were
only two falafel balls; the majority of the space on the plate
was taken up by the various salads, which, although good,
were not as great as the falafel.
Another dish we tried was the Pasta Mediterranean: as a
huge pasta fan, I wanted to see if a "Mediterranean" variety
was anything special. Coming with fresh tomatoes, olives,
mushrooms, onion, garlic and artichoke hearts in a white
wine sauce, the pasta was actually quite unique. The arti
choke hearts were a surprisingly nice addition; the wine
sauce, although a bit strong, was not too thick like most
white sauces nor too watery like most wine sauces. We were
too full for dessert (unlimited pita bread = full stomach), but
many of the desserts seemed to have an almond theme to
them, so, if you like almond, this is your place. The prices
were reasonable for a restaurant in Palo Alto (it really de
pends on what you order); if you want to go on a fancy or ca
sual date, this place would be perfect; the restaurants suit
both options very well: wraps and kabobs are available on
the more causal side, but racks of lamb, salmon and other
more lavish dishes are available as fancier options.
My favorite part of the restaurant was not the food but
the service. I have never seen such great service at a Palo
Alto restaurant. Not once did my water glass get even half
empty, and the food was brought out with perfect timing.
After my last bite of pita bread, there was soup; with my
last sip of soup, there was the main course; within seconds
of our telling the waiters we were done eating, they deliv
ered the check. Kan Zeman gets an A from me. and 1 def
initely will be returning there every time I have a craving
for falafel.
