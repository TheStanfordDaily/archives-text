# INLINE FOR WINE
## Students camp out in Quad for class signup 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Armed with tents, sleeping bags
and wool hats, dozens of students
camped out in the Quad late
Wednesday evening and early
Thursday morning, shivering
through the night for love of wine.

They were in line for one of the
University's most popular courses:
a one-unit activity course on wine
tasting offered at the French
House. By 7:30 a.m. yesterday,
when sign ups for the class began,
over 100 students were waiting in
line.
Formally known as French Viti
culture. the class regularly draws
hundreds of prospective students
every quarter hoping to grab one of
its 60 coveted seats. This spring has
been no exception, as graduating
seniors with extra room in their
schedules try to make the most of
their remaining time at Stanford.
Many of the campers had their
spots staked out several hours be
fore sign-ups began yesterday morn
in S" . . . ,
Stephanie Potter '07 arrived with
her friends at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday
night, a full 10 hours before sign-ups
began. To pass the time, they
watched episodes of the TV show
"Felicity" on a laptop, went on walks
and ate Domino's pizza that they
had delivered to the Quad.
"It's not because 1 had to. but be
cause 1 wanted to," Potter said about
camping out. echoing the strong in
terest many students have in the
class.
But with only 60 spots up for
grabs, many students who braved the
early morning chill had little hope of
joining the class. In fact, students
who arrived as early as 5 a.m. were
turned away when they got to the
sign-up sheet and were told that the
list was full.
"By the time we got to the end of
the line, we knew we couldn't get in.
but they could have at least let us
sign up so we wouldn't feel like we
wasted our time." said Kenneth
Shaw '07, who missed the chance to
be on the waiting list by three peo
ple. "You couldn't even sign up your
name to show that you were there."
In sum. 71 students added their
names to the sign-up list — the last
spot being determined between two
friends in a game of rock-paper-scis
sors. Final determinations for the
class roster were made at an organi
zational meeting last night.
Top priority is given to residents
of the French House, who signed up

for the course independently of yes
terdays early morning line and pay
only $45 (non-residents are charged
$85 to take the class). Whatever
spots remain after French House
students are finished signing up are
then offered to the general student
population.
While all participants must be 21
or older.seniority has no effect in de
ciding who gets into the class.
Though students often complain
about this rule.saying that seniors do
not have the chance to take the class
again, course organizer Patricia de
Castries, assistant director of the lan
guage center, is strict when it comes
to course policies, insisting that they
keep entry into the class fair.
The course, designed to teach stu
dents about the different types of
wine through tastings and field trips,
has earned a reputation over its six
year existence. Once, de Castries
said. President John Hennessy
walked into a class and tasted wine
with students. Wineries have also
sent the class invitations to come
visit to taste its wine.
De Castries offered some advice
for students who want to get into the
course. "The thing is just try, try.
try," she said. "It's tough, but I can't
do anything about it."
"It's very good if you come with
your girlfriend," she added. "You
stay cozy that way."
After a long night, students who
scored a top spot on the list ap
peared relieved, ultimately believing
that the wait was worth it.
"You know it's a good night." one
student said after signing up. "when
you have wine stains on your pants."
