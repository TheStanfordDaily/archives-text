## More than timber and oil: Canadian indie music 
### ANDREW HUNG INTERMISSION CANUCK 
They say that Canada's only gcxxl for her tim
ber, oil and pretentious indie music. Admittedly,
nolxjdy actually knows who "they" are, nor could
anyone really care less about limber and oil in
Canada. However, Canada just so happens to be
quite the hapjx'ning place tor the indie music ad
dict, with first-rate bands springing up from be
hind every tree and underneath every oil well. As
Toronto and Montreal, especially, play host to
scores of trendy clubs and dozens of festivals big
and small each year, the two cities have some of
the best new independent artists from pretty much
everywhere. Even though you may indulge in
maple syrup and Canadian hockey from time to
time,you're probably still missingout on Canada's
best export in recent years. Here's a tantalizing
taste of what the hipsters up north have to offer.
1. "Heartbeat," by Angela Desveaux, off the
album "Wandering Eyes"
If Lucinda Williams were coffee cake. Angela
Desveaux would lie tirainisu. The country music
influence in her dcliciously soothing music is still
audible, mostly in the homely drums and the
twanged-out guitar lines oozing with tremolo,

but her songwriting is not tinged with the joviali
ty of country or the bitterness of rock. Rather, the
uncontrived vocal harmonies and shimmering
guitar invoke a slight sense of longing that lingers
unobtrusively after the song is over.
2. "Set Yourself on Fire," by Stars, off the album
"Set Yourself on Fire"
The boys and girls of Stars accomplish extraordi
nary levels of the word "ethereal" with this mas
teq?iece. "Set Yourself on Fire" pretty much has
it till. Singers Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan
double the vocal melody gently in a perfect oc
tave. melting away the lyrics word by word. From
the intricate choreography of the dueling synthe
sizer rift's in the intro to the seamless dancing be
tween triple and duple meters, and from the fren
zied marauding of the hi-hat cymbals in the cho
rus to the soft diminuendo of the coda, the band
demonstrates its abjectly astonishing prowess in
arranging dynamics and instrumentation.
3. "Planets Conspire." by The Meligrove Band,
off the album "Planets Conspire"
The Meligrove Band may be driven by the piano
of frontman Jason Nunes. but they are not your
average piano band. Between the pounding of the
rhythm piano, the harsh, tinny voicing of the

drums and the partially distorted vocals, the raw
edge of "Planets Conspire" and its eponymous
album can liardly be confused with the works of
Keane or Ben Folds Five. None of their instru
ments have particularly euphonious timbres going
for them (perhaps due to the interestingly 10-fi
production of the album), but the band members
don't really need good tone, anyways; the reckless
spirit of their garage band beginnings lives on.
4. "AWOO," by The Hidden Cameras, off the
album " Awoo"
A Canadian Belle & Sebastian, if you will. The
Hidden Cameras seem to be more of a roving
posse of happy-go-lucky exiles than a band of se
rious musicians, with songs that are more remi
niscent of lullabies and circuses than anything
else. However, backing the simplistic songs and
Ã¼biquitous jangling guitar of frontman Joel Gibb
are a dozen or so instruments (including a string
section and chiming xylophone contraptions),
their well-versed performers and some serious
orchestration.
5. "Use It," by The New Pornographers, off the
album "Twin Cinema"
Some admirers of The Beatles say that creating

the pcrfect pop song is one of the highest forms
of art. The New Pornographers have certainly
taken that to heart, lavishing lush harmonies,
heart-seizing progressions and instantly memo
rable hooks to create a pop song so pimped out
Xabit would be proud. Drummer Kurt Dahle,
far from restraining himself in the "pocket" like
most other pop drummers, not only creates ;in
dynamite groove but also shows occasional signs
of flashiness, punctuating the otherwise dolce
song with an edgy splash of rock.
6. "7/4 Shoreline," by Broken Social Scene, off
the albunV'Broken Social Scene"
Only once in a blue moon does a song in an odd
meter hit the big time, but Broken Social Scene
has joined the exclusive club alongside Dave
Brubeck's "Take Five" and Pink Floyd's
"Money." One of the biggest indie bands in
Canada in many respects (including popularity
and the sheer amount of people involved), this
conglomerated supergroup of Canadian indie
all-stars has created a groove so addictive and
danceable you completely forget that it's in
seven. Even discounting the gimmick factor of
the unusual meter, the airy, melodic vocals over
the paced drive of the drums and the pleasantly
mild dissonance of the instruments still sum up to
a notable indie rock gem.
