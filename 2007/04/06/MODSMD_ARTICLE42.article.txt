# Amy Winehouse brings down the house
## 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION WINE TASTER 
She is a smoother Macy Gray. An edgier
Kelly Clarkson. An urban Norah Jones. She
is Motown meets R&B meets jazz meets pop.
Amy Winehouse, the latest Brit to break onto
the American music scene, is a sound all her
own.
Her distinctive music has already won her
critical acclaim in Britain, where she won the
"British Female Solo Artist Award" and re
leased a multi-platinum debut album. Now
releasing her second record "Back to Black"
in the U.S.. Winehouse is part of what has
been deemed the third British Invasion,
which includes such Brit Snow
Patrol, KT Tunstall, James Blunt, James
Morrison, Natasha Bcdingfield, Corinne
Baylcy Ray and Joss Stone. But this skinny,
Jewish Brit doesn't look or sing like anyone
else crossing the pond. With Rapunzel-length
black curly hair, a throw-back-disco bee hive,
huge naked lady tattoos down both her arms,
black Egyptian eye make-up and a thick Eng
lish accent. Amy Winehouse's splash onto the
American music scene is well-deserved.
Although some British superstars haven't
translated to U.S. audiences (Robbie
Williams standing as one of the most dramat
ic examples), America is embracing Wine-

house's unique vocals and full-band back-up
right alongside her orthidontically challenged
cousins. Inspired by the 1960s doo-wop girl
groups, Winehouse is a modern jazz and
R&B artist with a retro sound. Her list of in
fluences is as broad as her vocal range and in
cludes Busta Rhymes, the Shangri-las, Elvis,
Sarah Vaughn and Nas. She samples "Ain't

No Mountain High Enough" in
her song "Tears Dry on Their
Own"; four tracks later, her song
"You Know I'm No Good" fea
tures Ghostfacc Killah.
Her inimitable sound is cou
pled with her dark, honest, catchy
and autobiographical lyrics.
Winehouse wrote or co-wrote
every song on "Back to Black"

and claims her soul is in her music.
In response to gossip about her drug and al
cohol use. Winehousc said. "If you read the
stories, that's cool, but there's not much I can
say about myself that the music doesn't." In
her hit single "Rehab." Winchouse croons,
"They tried to make me go to rehab/1 said no.
no no." Later in the song, as a tribute to "60s
icons Ray Charles and Donny Hathaway, she
denounces rehab: "I'd rather be at home with
Ray/ I ain't got seventy days/ Cuz there's
nothing, nothing you can teach me/ That 1

table, and she looks good while
