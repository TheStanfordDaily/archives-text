## The
						Tossers: A Toe-Tapping Journey 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION AGONIZER 
For the last 15 years. Chicago's The Tossers have been providing the Mid
west with a distinct musical flavor that blends Irish heritage, Midwestern folk
and punk defiance. In "Agony," their sophomore release on Victory Records,
The Tossers push themselves further to harmonizx their influences in their
most complete and consistently strong album to date.
Coming from a predominantly Irish neighborhood. The Tossers inherited
folk and storytelling from Midwestern America and Ireland. The band has
transformed and struggled to meld their influences; initially. The Tossers
played merely folk and only later evolved their music into a punkish hybrid that
people have compared to the Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly. Ironi
cally. The Tossers are only gaining popularity now despite having existed
longer than either of their punk/folk cousins. Their reputation is still growing,
and they, like Flogging Molly, have often been compared to the definitive Celtic
lblk/punk band The Pogues. Like The Pogues, The Tossers feel right at home
with both painful, slow ballads and faster dance tunes. Likewise, they choose to
focus more on traditionally folk instruments such as the mandolin and banjo to
carry melodies rather than the distorted guitar of other Irish-influenced bands.
Unlike the group's previous work, the central themes of "Agony" are not
historical anecdotes or folk ballads, but instead personal battles. The theme of
pain is fittingly explored in songs detailing alcoholism, war. love and insanity.
The album sports 17 songs, which is a great many for a folk band. The recording
time is less than 50 minutes though, and. while this usually is indication of a constant
barrage of short, fast songs without lyrical depth, this isn't the case on "Agony."
The mixture of their influences, punk and folk, can be seen in the range of
songs. They're distinct and provide ample evidence of the band's musical abili
ties. The instrumental "The Sheep in the Boots" is a toe-tapping folk dance ex
perience in comparison to the lonely, frustrated rants of Huggins on "Not For
gotten." The band veers into politics as well. Though it has one of the weakest
choruses, "Political Scum" has some memorable lines. Huggins laments, "Over
the sea and far away kids die in deserts 'cause they've been sent that way."
There are also plenty of folksy ballads and crafted stories, from the bouncy
"Siobhan" to the reflective, gypsy-like wanderings of " Romany." Troubled re
lationships get their fair space as well, both in dark contemplative spaces such
as "Leopardstown Races"and "Claddagh" to the fast, punk-paced "Traps and
Ultimatums," easily one of the most verbose love songs they've ever done.
Meanwhile, "Not Alone" hits the listener with a heavy, repeating drum, a
musical flogging that sounds like either a death march or the noise that one's
soul makes as it falls down the stairs to hell. The barely audible mandolin and
constant beat are the only accompaniment to Huggin's rant about sexual trus
tration. The song seems to be a descent into madness or hell, and the full band
comes in at the end. seemingly offering a relief, suggesting either salvation or
exultant arrival in madness. But then the drum beat comes back in. and the
song fades into silence. It is easily the darkest moment in the album, and, more
lhan any other song, embodies the idea of "agony" beautifully.
The album ends on a positive note, a simple and self-affirming sing along
that will likely get stuck in your head and leave you with the sense that you ve
completed a journey through darkness, only to come out out into the light once
more. It reminds you that, despite the painful journey, life is lun.
As a whole, the album hangs together better than the groups previous
works, showing an improved ability to blend different influences. While the
album's range is certainly honed to darker and personal shades, it has plenty
of fast dancing tunes that remind the listener of the jigs ol older albums. I he
major criticisms this album will draw from fans is that its wide range will make
it seem disjointed on first listen. Huggins and company are a crafty bunch,
though, and arc careful at planting seeds and lyrical reoccurrences throughout
the tapestry. The album will grow tin fans, and. though not every song is a jig
worthv dance number, they are all well crafted.
For fans of Patrick Street, Blood or Whisky. Flogging Molly, The Pogues.
