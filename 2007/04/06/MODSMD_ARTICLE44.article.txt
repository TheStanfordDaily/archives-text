# LCD Soundsystem

### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION LCD SCREEN 
Dance/techno often gets accused of being slick but
shallow. Even worse non-fans such as myself deride
dance and techno as simply annoying. But every once
in a while, a dance album comes around that's so
catchy, so good, that it's impossible to dislike. "Sound
of Silver," the newest album from James Murphy's
musical project, LCD Soundsystem, is exactly one
such album. Murphy's dance-punk release is slick, but
certainly not shallow. And it's everything but annoy
ing.
Certainly, the hooks are endlessly repetitive. But
the needle's not stuck in the groove; just when the
song might start getting boring, Murphy mixes it up
and changes things. Each track features layer upon
layer of sound that make each listen intriguing, as you
can always discover something new, whether it's a
cool way the cowbell sounds or the pleasing backup
vocals.
Murphy, though, doesn't need anyone to back him up.
His vocal range is vast, going from a God-like voice in
the first track. "Get Innocuous!" to his defeated vocals
in the last song, "New York, 1 Love You But You're

Bringing Me

Down." Most of all. Murphy's singing is eminently
smooth and controlled, which fits right in with the in
strumentals. Like Murphy's voice, Nancy Whang's
background vocals create an atmosphere of utter ef
fortlessness. It's almost as if Whang and Murphy's
voices are instruments rather than voices, and words
themselves are irrelevant while the important things
are the beats and pitch of the vocals.
Not only does Murphy demonstrate a perfect control
of his voice, but every instrument in each song is
tweaked to perfection. Nothing is too loud or too soft,
and Murphy demonstrates a knack for making each
instrument comc across as gorgeous. In "All My
Friends." Murphy offers a monumental hi-hat; in
"Watch the Tapes," his synthesizer sounds like what
can best be described as a muttering old man. But
most impressive is the cumulative effect of each in
strument: the sound might come across as sparse but
paradoxically remains varied and full at the same time.
If I had to criticize the album in one way, it's Murphy's
inability to make "records" rather than a collection of
singles. Certainly, this applies to "Sound of Silver,"
but to a lesser extent than to his first album, "LCD
Soundsystem." All the songs on "Sound of Silver"
could easily stand on their own, but "Sound of Silver"
is joined together at least somewhat better than "LCD
Soundsystem" by the haunting sense of nostalgia that
permeates each song. In "Someone Great," Murphy
reminisces about the past: "I miss the way we used to
argue/ Locked in your basement... Something's a

problem/ To tell the truth 1 saw it coming." In
"Sound of Silver," Murphy sings how the
"Sound of Silver... makes you want to feel
> like a teenager"; in "All My Friends,"

Murphy remarks how he "Wouldn't
trade one stupid decision/ For anoth-

er five years of life."
But this thread of nostalgia is only

moderately noticeable; mostly,
the album is a collection of rela
tively disjointed singles. But
they're outstanding. "North

American Scum" is an infec
tious, head-banger of a track,
which alternatively criticizes

and celebrates its title conti
nent. "All My Friends" features
an exceedingly repetitive piano
cord over and over but still man-

ages to be exciting, even
thrilling. "Us V Them" bounces
with a cowbell that almost
forces you to dance.

Perhaps "Sound of Silver" is pri
marily a dance album, but it's also
an album that you can sit down and

J listen to, again and again. But you
probably won't be sitting for long be
cause the urge to move is utterly conta-

gious. It's exactly this beguiling quality
that makes the "Sound of Silver" the exact

opposite of annoying dance music.
