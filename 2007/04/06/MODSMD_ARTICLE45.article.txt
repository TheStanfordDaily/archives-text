## Roxy mounts her Mounties 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SKETCHY CANUCK 
In Roxy's mind, "Canada" and "sex" have always been two separate ideas
never to be combined for any reason. Come on — can you think of anything
unique to those Canadians that's particularly sexy? Aside from the occasional
I accent, if that's your thing (and, really, do "aboot" and "how ya doin\ eh?"
| even qualify?), there's not much in Canada except wide expanses of, well,
| wilderness.

But as Roxy mused further on the concept of Canadian sex
a misty memory began to swim in front of her eyes. A tall and
powerful man, vigorously and lustfully mounting...a horse?!?
That's right. Roxy suddenly remembered something very
special about Canada's wide expanses — Mounties! Also
known as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Mounties
have been combining the cop and cowboy/girl fantasies since
1868. Talk about a hot piece of Canadian bacon.
Once Roxy's appetite was thus whetted, there was no
stopping her. She searched for Mountie-bounty all night long,
and her results brought her to the towering heights of ecsta
sy. Roxy thinks you may have heard about Italian policemen
being extraordinarily attractive, but who expected to find
such tasty law-enforcing morsels right across a border you
don't even need a passport to cross? Certainly not Roxy.
Discover, for example, the online sex shops often fre
quented by Mounties. Pick up a "jack rabbit vibrator" on
your next visit — oh, how those Canadians love the outdoors
and nature's creatures. The website www.canadiansextoys.ca
also stocks a mystifying array of" Fleshlight" products: "flesh
light vagina, fleshlight bum & fleshlight mouth, fleshlight in
serts, fleshlight sex in a can," and the list goes on and on. Roxy
thinks all of the above would really hit the spot on those cold

112 Canadian nights. In fact, she's open sesame.
The Mounties (Roxy just can't say their name enough! After all, it sounds a
lot like "mount me") also have a political party to serve their special interests.
It's called — you guessed it — the Sex Party! Through their political activism,
Mounties can focus on the important things in public safety, such as "Public Sex
— The Politics of Erotic Life" and "Politics for a Sex-Positive Future." Moun
ties and their fans also regularly host SAVY (Sex/Art/Vote/Yes!) celebrations.
For more information about Sex Partying — political style — go to www.the
sexparty.ca. An article on this homepage loudly calls for more discussion of sex

by mainstream journalists. Note to Canada: Roxy's available.

But, even as she considers defecting to Canada, Roxy truly can't help ask
ing — where's the American version of the Sex Party? And please don't tell

her most Friday nights at SAE or try to recommend your favorite

porn site. 1 he answer is that there really isn t one, and this is not
the only .way in which Canadians' attitudes toward sex trump

those of Americans.
Mounties, their incredible hotness and double fantasy-

come- 1
alive status aside, are also extremely sexually tolerant. Same-sex mar
riage is legal in Canada, and two Mounties happily tied the knot in 2005.
And no, they were not assaulted by their co-Mounties just days after the
celebration. Additionally, there are almost 25,000 Mounties in Canada —
enough to satisfy even Queenie from"The Wild Party." From all this,
Roxy's learned one thing — It's time to bring Canada back. Mountie for
President! Vote Canada's Sex Party in 2008, and take a walk on the
wilderness side.
