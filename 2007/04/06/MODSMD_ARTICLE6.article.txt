## Zell talks business Billionaire buys papers, touts new investment 
### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Millionaire real estate tycoon
Sam Zell. who inked an $8.2 billion
deal to buy media conglomerate
Tribune on Monday, said he looks
forward to the "fascinating chal
lenge" of turning around an under
performing company in a lagging

industry in which he is a newcomer.
"It makes it even more exciting
when 1 see other people haven't
been able to figure it out." he told
Stanford Law and Business School
students last night in his first public
appearance since the acquisition
was announced.
Zell, 65, became the 52nd rich
est man in America largely bv mak
ing contrarian investments —
snapping up cheap companies
when their stars had faded in the
eyes of most investors. Some ana-

Real estate investor Sam Zell smiles during an interview last month. The 65
year old spoke to students yesterday about corporate governance.
lysis question the wisdom of his designs on
Tribune, which owns The Los Angeles
Times, 23 television stations and the Chica
go Cubs.
"A lot of people didn't think the rail car
business was a good investment. 1 made a
quarter billion dollars. A lot of people
thought the container leasing business was a
horrific business. I made a half a billion dol
lars," /ell said, responding to a question
after his hour-long Rock Center for Corpo
rate Governance lecture. "Should I go on, or
do you get the message?"
i le said a feud between the major share
holders of Tribune had caused internal
"warfare" but argued that "Tribune is a col
lection of truly extraordinary assets with ex
traordinary brands."
Zell said he had no editorial agenda for
the media company but added that he wants
to increase revenues and cut costs while sup
porting quality journalism.
"The newspapers have to be relevant,"
he said."ln many cases over the last lOyears
and with the growth of the Internet, as tip
posed to the newspapers aggressively deal
ing with that, 1 think they've laid down.
That's what it looks like to me."
He suggested savings would come from
outside the newsroom and hinted that, if the

deal goes through, he would try to squeeze
more money out of such Internet companies
as Google who link to his newspapers' con
tent.
"11 all of the newspapers in America did
not allow Google to steal their content for
nothing, what would Google do?" he asked.
"We have a situation today where
effectively the content is being paid for by
the newspapers and stolen by Google,
etcetera. TTiat can last for a short time, but it
can't last forever. 1 think Google and the
boys understand that. We're going to see
new deals and new formulas in the media
space that reflect the reality of cost benefit."
"But remember." he was quick to add.
"I'm a newspaper man since Monday, and
not even that. Give me two weeks to be
come a genius."
Today's New York Times reports that bil
lionaire David Geffen will have dinner with
Zell tonight to discuss a possible spin-off of
The Los Angeles Times. But today's San
Jose Mercury News reports that, at a recep
tion before last night's speech, Zell said he
was going to keep Tribune intact.
Zell did not mention the Tribune acquisi
tion during his lecture, which was about cor
porate governance and the recent $39 bil
lion sale of his company. Equity Office

Properties Trust.
He focused on the value of a strong
board of directors and decried what he said
was increasingly excessive government reg
ulation of public companies, spurred by the
landmark 2(M)2 Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
"It puts the U.S. markets at a disadvan
tage to the rest of the world," he said. "1
think it is putting the United States behind
the eight ball."
At one point in his lecture, Zell played a
music video recorded to the tune of Frank
Sinatra's "Love and Marriage." University
President John Hennessy, who serves on the
Google Board of Directors, laughed out
loud through the music video, which was
highly critical of government interference in
public companies.
Zell said he has seen employees crying at
their desks because of what he called the
law's frustrating complexity.
"In the end, do you really think you can
legislate morality?" he said. "The bottom
line is that there is no way to legislate moral
ity. The only way you can is by religion, and
I'm very much in favor of separation of com
pany and religion."
