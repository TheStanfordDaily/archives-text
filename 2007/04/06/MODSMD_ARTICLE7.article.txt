## Math used to model race Economics prof. describes Minority education shortfall as vicious cycle 
### MIKE DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the second of two presentations. Brown Univer
sity Economics Prof. Glenn Loury tempered a pas
sionate discourse on the causes of high rates of crime,
gun possession, children conceived out of wedlock and
lack of education among underprivileged African-
Americans with the empirical analysis that is the tool
of his trade last night at the Stanford Humanities Cen
ter.
While the Wednesday talk consisted of a wealth of
empirical data on these problems, last night's presen
tation focused on constructing mathematical models
of these problems. Loury concluded that many of the
troubles facing black communities cannot be viewed
simply as consequences of poor choices on the part of
individuals but, rather, are direct outcomes of societal
conditions and perceptions.
One model illustrated that the inclination of any
particular group to invest in education is directly relat
ed to the perceived benefit of such an investment.
Within groups where education was prevalent and had
been shown to continuously benefit the recipients, the
level of investment in education was shown to grow.
ITie opposite trend existed in groups where education
was less common and the benefits less obvious.
As a result, communities which start with a lower

level of education will be subject to a vicious cycle pre
venting growing investment in education.
Loury argued that such an approach pins responsi
bility on actions taken by whites in the past.
"What we fail to realize is that ghettos and such
urban enclaves are our own creation," Loury said.
"ITiey are there precisely because white Americans
did not want such people to live with them. And when
the ghettos to which these people were confined began

to fester in their isolation, the inhab
itants of such communities were
condemned as dangerous and harm
ful to society."
Loury gave an example of how
this model fits into the context of
America by referring to a well-doc
umented phenomenon known as
the "acting white problem." in
which hardworking African-Ameri
can students supposedly face label
ing as "wannabe whites" for devot
ing too much attention to their stud
ies.
Loury pointed out that such cul
tural pressure by African-Ameri
can students on their peers was only
evident at schools in which the
African-American student popula
tion was less than a fifth of the gen

eral population.
"The way African-American stu
dents acted toward one another was
a direct result of how African-
American students interacted with
white students," Loury said.
Loury argued that this had impli
cations for American society as a
whole.
"The American project of civil
inclusion is woefully incomplete,"
he said.
The only way to truly solve the
racial problems of this generation,
Loury argued, is to foster a broader
and more inclusive sense of human
ity.
"The fundamental premise that
should guide us is that we are in this
together," he said. "To understand
that those people, whatever their
race, nationality, social status or re
ligious preference, are us."
