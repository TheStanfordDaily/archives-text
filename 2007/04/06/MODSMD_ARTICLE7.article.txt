## Math used to model race Economics prof. describes Minority education shortfall as vicious cycle 
### MIKE DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the second of two presentations. Brown Univer
sity Economics Prof. Glenn Loury tempered a pas
sionate discourse on the causes of high rates of crime,
gun possession, children conceived out of wedlock and
lack of education among underprivileged African-
Americans with the empirical analysis that is the tool
of his trade last night at the Stanford Humanities Cen
ter.
While the Wednesday talk consisted of a wealth of
empirical data on these problems, last night's presen
tation focused on constructing mathematical models
of these problems. Loury concluded that many of the
troubles facing black communities cannot be viewed
simply as consequences of poor choices on the part of
individuals but, rather, are direct outcomes of societal
conditions and perceptions.
One model illustrated that the inclination of any
particular group to invest in education is directly relat
ed to the perceived benefit of such an investment.
Within groups where education was prevalent and had
been shown to continuously benefit the recipients, the
level of investment in education was shown to grow.
ITie opposite trend existed in groups where education
was less common and the benefits less obvious.
As a result, communities which start with a lower

level of education will be subject to a vicious cycle pre
venting growing investment in education.
Loury argued that such an approach pins responsi
bility on actions taken by whites in the past.
"What we fail to realize is that ghettos and such
urban enclaves are our own creation," Loury said.
"ITiey are there precisely because white Americans
did not want such people to live with them. And when
the ghettos to which these people were confined began
