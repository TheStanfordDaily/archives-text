## Crisco is ingredient for ASSU Chappie's sticky antics bring auger, laughs 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When official campaigning for
next week's ASSII elections began
just after midnight on Wednesday, a
number of candidates new to the
process were not prepared for the an
nual antics ofThe Chapparal that tra
ditionally accompany the flyering
frenzy.
Anthony Bestafka-Cruz 10 said
that past ASSU Senators had told
him stories about The Chappie com
ing around during the election and
spraying Crisco so that people could
not put up their flyers. He said that,
right before midnight, "it started to
get chaotic" when some candidates
started to steal flyering space others
had been saving.
"Right at midnight is when it kind
of got confusing," he said. "Every
body starts flyering away and I had a
banner and I was putting it down
against the outer edge. I laid one end
of it down, and 1 was smoothing it out.
And this guy came up who I didn't
recognize and I hadn't seen all night.
I le came up with a can on the part I
was still trying to smooth out and he
started spraying Crisco behind the
flyer."
"I don't remember what I said ex
actly but I remember yelling at him,"
he added. "I hurried up and pushed
the flyer down so he couldn't spray
anymore behind it. But I know he did
get around to a few people's areas
and he sprayed it down so they could
n't tape down their stuff."
Bestafka-Cruz said that The
Chappie also staged a fake fight to
mock the candidates.
"During this whole time I was try
ing to secure down my banners, and
The Chappie was going around and
just causing chaos." he said. "Appar
ently one of the gnys made one of the
girls out there cry."
Anthony Scodary 'OS. who is run
ning for ASSU Executive under The
Chappie's auspices, denied any affili
ation with the antics in White Plaza.
"I don't know anything about
that," he said.
Scodary said that Chappie mem
bers normally accompany Hie Chap
pie slate to the event, but he said they
were tamer this year because they did
not have a megaphone.
"There was a guy who was going
under the name Sergio who was in
terfering with things who claimed he
went to school here and later said he
didn't." he said, tongue in cheek."He
was trying to pick lights with a lot of
the candidates there. I le was tearing
up paper and pushing people in the
fountain. Sergio, I later found out,
has been living in Meyer Library for
a month."
Elections Commissioner
Bernard Luis Fraga "08 said he had
not received serious or unusual
complaints about The Chappie's be
havior at the event.
"1 haven't received any extensive
complaints other than general light
hearted mischief by The Chappie,"
he said. "But if things got out of
hand, I'm extremely upset to hear
that because, in the past,The Chap
pie has always been light-hearted
and playful in their actions, and their
intent should not to be to shame or
insult any of the candidates."
Hershey Avula *08 — another
candidate who is running for ASSU
Executive with Mondaire Jones '09
as his Vice Presidential candidate —
said he was upset about The Chap
pie's behavior at the time, but un
derstood that they had no malicious
intent.
"[They] play jokes on the other
candidates, and one of the things is
spraying Crisco over all over the
surfaces, and it's mostly just a joke."
he said. "Their actions weren't ex
tremely harmful, but they definitely
impeded the ability of some candi
dates to put up their posters.

Avula/Jones takes the elections very
seriously, and we can understand
why some candidates can be very
frustrated. Even though actions like
this are humorous, we completely
understand that at times they can
also he detrimental to the process."
Avula speculated that some peo
ple reacted negatively to the pranks
because of the high number of first
time candidates.
"I don't believe [the Chappie
slate] has signed on to the fair cam
paign polices." he said. "So. them
coming out and doing what they did,
I'm not sure if the Elections Com
missioner could do anything about
it. I can see how, since there are so
many new people, they would see
this is an egregious crime and not
annual humor."
