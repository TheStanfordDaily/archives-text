## Crisco is ingredient for ASSU Chappie's sticky antics bring auger, laughs 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When official campaigning for
next week's ASSII elections began
just after midnight on Wednesday, a
number of candidates new to the
process were not prepared for the an
nual antics ofThe Chapparal that tra
ditionally accompany the flyering
frenzy.
Anthony Bestafka-Cruz 10 said
that past ASSU Senators had told
him stories about The Chappie com
ing around during the election and
spraying Crisco so that people could
not put up their flyers. He said that,
right before midnight, "it started to
get chaotic" when some candidates
started to steal flyering space others
had been saving.
"Right at midnight is when it kind
of got confusing," he said. "Every
body starts flyering away and I had a
banner and I was putting it down

And this guy came up who I didn't

started spraying Crisco behind the
flyer."
"I don't remember what I said ex

he added. "I hurried up and pushed
the flyer down so he couldn't spray

n't tape down their stuff."
Bestafka-Cruz said that The
Chappie also staged a fake fight to
mock the candidates.
"During this whole time I was try

The Chappie was going around and
just causing chaos." he said. "Appar
ently one of the gnys made one of the
girls out there cry."
Anthony Scodary 'OS. who is run
ning for ASSU Executive under The
Chappie's auspices, denied any affili
ation with the antics in White Plaza.
"I don't know anything about
that," he said.
Scodary said that Chappie mem
bers normally accompany Hie Chap
pie slate to the event, but he said they
were tamer this year because they did
not have a megaphone.
"There was a guy who was going
under the name Sergio who was in
terfering with things who claimed he
went to school here and later said he
didn't." he said, tongue in cheek."He
was trying to pick lights with a lot of
the candidates there. I le was tearing
up paper and pushing people in the
