## Settlement allows Joyce scholar to publish work 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
English Prof. Carol Shloss' suit against James
Joyce's estate for the permission to quote pas
sages from the Irish author's 1939 novel
"Finnegans W;ike" and letters between the fa
mous novelist and his daughter Lucia Joyce was
settled in her favor.
Shloss' 2005 biography, "Lucia Joyce: To
Dance in the Wake," aims to alter the longstand
ing view of Joyce's mentally ill daughter by show
ing that the author did not actually consider her
to be crazy but rather unique and original. In

order to do so. Shloss needed
the passages from Joyce's novel
and letters as evidence, but her
initial request to quote the ma
terials was denied by Joyce's es
tate, a move that Shloss attrib
uted to Joyce's grandson
Stephen Joyce, who is protec
tive of the memory of Lucia
Joyce, his aunt.
Shloss said that the specific
passages, which she omitted Iron
crucial.
"['Lucia Joyce: To Dance in

n her hook, were
1 the Wake'] is a

new reading of the Joyce family life." she said.
"And when you present new paradigms, you sim
ply must have evidence. Evidence was what I had
to take out of my book."
In response, Shloss filed a lawsuit against the
Joyce estate. While Shloss argued that Joyce and
his daughter would have wanted the material to
be available to the public, Stephen Joyce claimed
its use invaded family privacy.
Maria Nelson. ;t lawyer bused in Los Angeles
who represented the Joyce estate, explained that
Stephen Joyce was against published work that
