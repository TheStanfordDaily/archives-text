## Settlement allows Joyce scholar to publish work 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
English Prof. Carol Shloss' suit against James
Joyce's estate for the permission to quote pas
sages from the Irish author's 1939 novel
"Finnegans W;ike" and letters between the fa
mous novelist and his daughter Lucia Joyce was
settled in her favor.
Shloss' 2005 biography, "Lucia Joyce: To
Dance in the Wake," aims to alter the longstand
ing view of Joyce's mentally ill daughter by show
ing that the author did not actually consider her
to be crazy but rather unique and original. In

order to do so. Shloss needed
the passages from Joyce's novel
and letters as evidence, but her
initial request to quote the ma
terials was denied by Joyce's es
tate, a move that Shloss attrib
uted to Joyce's grandson
Stephen Joyce, who is protec
tive of the memory of Lucia
Joyce, his aunt.
Shloss said that the specific
passages, which she omitted Iron
crucial.
"['Lucia Joyce: To Dance in

n her hook, were
1 the Wake'] is a

new reading of the Joyce family life." she said.
"And when you present new paradigms, you sim
ply must have evidence. Evidence was what I had
to take out of my book."
In response, Shloss filed a lawsuit against the
Joyce estate. While Shloss argued that Joyce and
his daughter would have wanted the material to
be available to the public, Stephen Joyce claimed
its use invaded family privacy.
Maria Nelson. ;t lawyer bused in Los Angeles
who represented the Joyce estate, explained that
Stephen Joyce was against published work that


Shloss
focuses on his aunt's illness, believ
ing it to be disrespectful to both her
and the family.
"Shloss. I believe, felt that she
should be able to use whatever mate
rials she could uncover, pointing out

that in the U.S.. at least, the dead
have no privacy rights." Nelson
wrote in an email to'The Daily.
Shloss said Lucia Joyce's writings
were readily available to the public.
"Lucia gave her writing to the li
braries; she wanted it to be made
public and said so in her will," Shloss
said. "In this sense, she was being si
lenced in a way that violated her own
wishes."
The case was settled out of court

and Shloss was allowed to quote the
material electronically and in a
printed supplement to her book, ac
cording to a press release by the
Stanford Law School.
Shloss said she felt compelled to
sue both for herself and for future
scholars.
"1 wanted to make a case for the
goodness and Tightness of what we
do as scholars," she said. "I wanted
to call attention to the plight of oth

ers like myself, and 1 wanted to reap
the fruit of my own literary labor."
Though she was vindicated by
the outcome, Shloss was nonethe
less frustrated by the protracted
process.
"What's 'fair' after you've had to
struggle to publish a scholarly book
for 15 years?" she asked.
