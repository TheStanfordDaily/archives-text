From ASSU Elections Guide
The Daily: Mow is your campaign
going so far? Have there been any
challenges?
Ilrisin Treubc: It's been one enormous
challenge because of basically nepotism
and indifference. The biggest challenge
was on the very first nicht when the

feeding frenzy started and everyone
showed up at midnight to put up their
flyers. It you arrive three minutes late,
then your campaign is already screwed,
because every space has been taken up
