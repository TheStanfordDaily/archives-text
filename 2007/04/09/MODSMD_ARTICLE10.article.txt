The Daily: Mow is your campaign
going so far? Have there been any
challenges?
Ilrisin Treubc: It's been one enormous
challenge because of basically nepotism
and indifference. The biggest challenge
was on the very first nicht when the

feeding frenzy started and everyone
showed up at midnight to put up their
flyers. It you arrive three minutes late,
then your campaign is already screwed,
because every space has been taken up


HEN/The Stanford Daily
by paper waste. We arrived slightly
late and we started hanging up a
banner. Our first obstacle was im
mediately apparent when the elec
tions commissioner came over and
said we couldn't hang our banner
because we hadn't registered some
thing early enough in what he jok
ingly called "the free speech zone."
When we went to put up oui flyers,
the good space had already been
taken because of their first-come,
first-serve policy, which doesn't re
ally benefit anyone except for those
who have spent thousands of dol
lars at Kinkos. And when we started
flyering at around two in the morn
ing, Avula and Jones came over and
accused us of taking their twine.
Folahan Olowoyeye: That was
more ridiculous than anything.
TI): Do you think your affiliation
with The Band is going to help you
get votes or is going to hurt you?
FO: I think above all else the Stan
ford Band is what is most widely
representative of Stanford, much
to the chagrin of the ASSU and the
OSA, or anyone who trys to pro
mote a respectable image.
BT: Like John Arrillaga.
TI): What do you think is the
biggest issue in this race, or per
haps, what's the most divisive
issue?
FO: 1 would say it's an issue of ac

countability. 1 feel what's happen
ing on this campus is that the OSA
and the ASSU are trying to create
as little accountablity for them
selves and the students.
TI): How so?
FO: By the way the policy is creat
ed, particularly in terms of party
planning and alcohol. But every
kind of open celebration of student
life is kind of strictly regimented
under this kind of schedule.
TI): Someone wrote on our Web
site on an article that I wrote actu
ally that "The only people who run
are serious resume-pushers who
spend thousands of dollars to get
elected." What do you think about
that?
BT: That wasn't actually me who
wrote that, but that's good. 1 defi
nitely feel like it's the people who
spend the most money and are just
there to make themselves look bet
ter. The ASSU originally was
founded along with the University
as a means to help Stanford stu
dents work with the administration
and be a facility between the two.
Ever since then more and more has
been piled on as a way to make
ASSU Senators look bettter.
FO: 1 think part of my own frustra
tion with the electoral process and
the idea of student groups is that
by creating any body of individuals
to think for you and act for you,
they kind of remove that responsi
bility and that dynamism from you.
