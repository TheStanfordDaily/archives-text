# Smoothie Review
## Wake up with the Acai Supercharger 
### VICTOR CRUZ INTERMISSION 
Despite the appearance of the strange
purple-berry mush of the Acai Supercharg
er, I wholeheartedly recommend this
smoothie. I've had my share of Jambas and
this one, off the "Functional Flavor" menu,
packs 640% of Vitamin C and 78g of sugar in
what two of my friends described as,"a solid
flavor...it's hard to describe. It's just deli
cious." Unlike the light, summery creamsicle
that my roommate got for a quick sugar
boost on his way to stats class, the Acai Su
percharger can actually be considered a
meal in itself.

The drink is standard Jamba
consistency, easy to stir, with not
quite-blended granules of boost.
Acai Supercharger comes in the
deep. rich, purple of Acai palm
berries and packs some kick with
some caffeine-like guarana.
Skeptical as I was about its super
charging capabilities, 1 felt great
after sitting in the sun, talking to

friends, and digesting
this mid-afternoon
snack. I felt great! With
the help of this drink. I
was finally able to start

my day at 3 p.m.

A word of warning:
though. The little black berries
tend to cluster between teeth,
leaving you looking like a fool.
