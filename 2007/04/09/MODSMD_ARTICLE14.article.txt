## Campus arts 'Bare Witness' to the photography of Gordon Parks 
### NICOLE DEMBY INTERMISSION CURATOR 
In her book "On Photography." Susan
Sontag writes,"there is something predato
ry in the act of taking a picture. To photo
graph people is to violate them, by seeing
them as they never see themselves, by hav
ing knowledge of them they can never
have; it turns people into objects that can
be symbolically possessed." "Bare Wit
ness" Cantor's new exhibit of 73 black
and-white works by recently deceased pho
tographer. novelist and film director Gor
don Parks, is a reminder that even Sontag
was fallible. Many of these outstanding
photographs chronicle poverty and slum
life in various cities. These photographs
never try to elicit a specific emotional re
sponse from the viewer by strong-arming
him into feeling pity. Instead. Parks used
his lens to explore exactly how his subjects
see themselves — not exclusively as sympa
thy-inducing victims of impoverishment,
but as human beings with complex psy
chologies that have been shaped by their
harsh realities. The genius of these photo
graphs is that they resist portraying even
their most destitute subjects as victims of
the camera or of their surroundings. With
out simplifying his subjects or diminishing
the poignancy of the specific moment.
Parks captured lives shaped by the rapidly
shifting social forces of a postwar America
and thus portrayed history in its most
human form.
Gordon Parks is perhaps most-acclaimed
for his photography but was a versatile
artist, spawning the Blaxploitation genre
with his 1971 movie "Shaft," publishing nov
els and poetry and composing a ballet about
Martin Luther King, Jr. He was also an au
thor and a musician.The youngest of 15 chil
dren. Parks was born into poverty in Fort
Scott. Kan. in l l )12.1 le began his photogra
phy career as a woman's portrait photogra
pher. then started to photograph Chicago's
poor and Black South Side. These photo
graphs landed him a job with the Farm Secu
rity Administration, where he pho
tographed under the supervision of the head
of the FSA's Information Division, Roy
Striker. Perhaps his most recognizable pho
tograph—and the first one the viewer en
counters in the main room of the Cantor ex
hibit— depicts Ella Watson, a black janitor
at the Farm Security Administration build
ing. standing in front of an American flag
with a broom in hand and a mop in the back
ground.The photograph is called "American
Gothic, Washington, D.C.," titled after the
famous Grant Wood painting of the same
name. The American flag hovers out of focus
in the background, an allegory for that
which hovered above African Americans as
they struggled against racism and other
workers as they strove to make a living in
America.
It was his relationship with Striker that
led him to work on the Standard Oil Photog
raphy Project in the mid '40s photographing
life in small towns and industrial centers.
Some photographs from the project includ
ed in the exhibit —such as an image of a
young grease-plant worker, looking deter
mined despite the nightmarish setting of the
plant —show the tentative hope and doubt
of people caught in the industrial thrust of
the nation. On the other hand, others show
the encroachment of mass culture into small
towns. The aforementioned photographs
chronicling slum life that are the soul of the
exhibit, however, are selections from photo
essays that Parks published in Life maga
zine. In one series. Parks captures the life of
a young Brazilian boy, Flavio da Silva, and
his siblings growing up in a squalid favela in

American Gothic, Washington D.C.
Rio de Janero.These beautiful and affecting
images capture the physical conditions of
people's impoverished lives, yet they are in
tensely personal and psychological. Parks
engages with the subject's mental state at
the moment his lens captures them. In his
high-contrast style, he draws the viewer to
the subject and the subject's humanity as
something distinct from the peeling walls,
the dirty pits and the tenements that sur
round them.
These photo essays are being displayed
as high art, which speaks to Parks' versatili
ty as a photographer. Even his most affect
ing photographs, such as those of Flavio ten
derly feeding his younger brother are beau
tifully composed images. Struck initially by
the photographs from magazines that riders
would leave behind while working as a wait
er on a luxury train car. Parks went on to
have a strong career as a freelance fashion
photographer and worked for Vogue. Re
grettably, the exhibit includes only one of his
fashion photographs.
A second, lighter room houses Parks'
portraits of famous artists and historical
figures. Again we see his predilection for
photographing his subjects in dramatic
lighting, often streaming in from one side.

I le captured his artist subjects in their nat
ural setting: Duke Ellington playing piano,
Leonard Bernstein in Carnegie Hall. Al
berto Giacometti and Alexander Calder
surrounded by their art. Also in the room
are photographs of Muhammad Ali. Mal
colm X and members of the Black Pan
thers. Two photographs—the 1977 photo
graph of prominent Black Panther mem
ber Edridge Cleaver and his wife Kathleen
in front of a portrait of Panthers co
founder Huey Newton, and a 1949 photo
graph of Ingrid Bergman in Stramboli,
dressed in white and glancing loftily to the
side while three black-clad old women in
the background gawk at her—exemplify
once more how good Parks' skill at using
his camera to connect with his subject's
psyche.
"Bare Witness" may not be as accessible
as the Richard Avedon photographs down
stairs, but they are certainly just as resound
ing and important. By forcing the viewer to
focus not only on the subjects' characters
but also on their situations. Parks' photo
graphs transcend time and space while at
the same time conveying a historical mo
ment. The exhibit runs from now until July 1
at Cantor Arts Center.

life in small towns and industrial centers.
Some photographs from the project includ
ed in the exhibit —such as an image of a
young grease-plant worker, looking deter
mined despite the nightmarish setting of the
plant —show the tentative hope and doubt
of people caught in the industrial thrust of
the nation. On the other hand, others show
the encroachment of mass culture into small
towns. The aforementioned photographs
chronicling slum life that are the soul of the
exhibit, however, are selections from photo
essays that Parks published in Life maga
zine. In one series. Parks captures the life of
a young Brazilian boy, Flavio da Silva, and
his siblings growing up in a squalid favela in

American Gothic, Washington D.C.
Rio de Janero.These beautiful and affecting
images capture the physical conditions of
people's impoverished lives, yet they are in
tensely personal and psychological. Parks
engages with the subject's mental state at
the moment his lens captures them. In his
high-contrast style, he draws the viewer to
the subject and the subject's humanity as
something distinct from the peeling walls,
the dirty pits and the tenements that sur
round them.
These photo essays are being displayed
as high art, which speaks to Parks' versatili
ty as a photographer. Even his most affect
ing photographs, such as those of Flavio ten
derly feeding his younger brother are beau
tifully composed images. Struck initially by
the photographs from magazines that riders
would leave behind while working as a wait
er on a luxury train car. Parks went on to
have a strong career as a freelance fashion
photographer and worked for Vogue. Re
grettably, the exhibit includes only one of his
fashion photographs.
A second, lighter room houses Parks'
portraits of famous artists and historical
figures. Again we see his predilection for
photographing his subjects in dramatic
lighting, often streaming in from one side.

I le captured his artist subjects in their nat
ural setting: Duke Ellington playing piano,
Leonard Bernstein in Carnegie Hall. Al
berto Giacometti and Alexander Calder
surrounded by their art. Also in the room
are photographs of Muhammad Ali. Mal
colm X and members of the Black Pan
thers. Two photographs—the 1977 photo
graph of prominent Black Panther mem
ber Edridge Cleaver and his wife Kathleen
in front of a portrait of Panthers co
founder Huey Newton, and a 1949 photo
graph of Ingrid Bergman in Stramboli,
dressed in white and glancing loftily to the
side while three black-clad old women in
the background gawk at her—exemplify
once more how good Parks' skill at using
his camera to connect with his subject's
psyche.
"Bare Witness" may not be as accessible
as the Richard Avedon photographs down
stairs, but they are certainly just as resound
ing and important. By forcing the viewer to
focus not only on the subjects' characters
but also on their situations. Parks' photo
graphs transcend time and space while at
the same time conveying a historical mo
ment. The exhibit runs from now until July 1
at Cantor Arts Center.
