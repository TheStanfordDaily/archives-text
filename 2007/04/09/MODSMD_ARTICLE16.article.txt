# Hidden Stanford Eateries
## Take your business to Arbuckle Cafe 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION BUSINESSWOMAN 
Graduate School of Business
SIS Memorial Way
Hours: Mon-Thurs: 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Fri: 7:30 p.m.-3:30
p.m. Lunch is served from 11:00 a.m.- 1:30 p.m.
Descending the staircase in the atrium of Stanford's
Graduate School of Business, the snaking serving lines,
clamorous cacophony of conversation and horseshoe of
florescent-lit food stations might initially remind you of
your elementary school lunchroom. Here, the similari
ties end.
Arbuckle Cafe is quick.efficient and crowded. When
I called to ask them preliminary questions (fancy phras
ing for "hours"), the phone rang 20 times with no an
swer. At the time. I pictured servers lounging around
chewing on their fingernails, uninterested in the phone
jingling in the background. After watching the sandwich
assembler and his streamlined, hurried movements. I re
alize that there's simply no time to answer the phone.
Every employee is out on the floor: pressing paninis,
tossing salads and tenderly folding burritos.
Given this lunchtime pandemonium. 1 expected that
the food itself would be lackluster. How good can a
sandwich be when the assembler makes two or three in
such rapid succession? Arbuckle surprises, however, in
the freshness and vigor of its offerings. Food stations arc
clearly labeled.There's a smoothie area.open salad bar,
taqueria, panini press, deli (where the aforementioned
sandwich assembler deftly builds a sandwich according
to your specifications) and a feature "At Home" section.
The latter has offerings that change on a daily basis. It is
also here that the featured soups and salad can be locat

ed. It none of this suits your fancy, then there is also a
shelved cooling unit next to the registers with packaged
sandwiches, sushi, yogurt and other to-go items.
()ne of my friend opted for a turkey sandwich with
the works, liic sandwich's appearance alone was im
pressive: two generous slices of nutty wheat bread and a
flattened rainbow of fillings cut in half and set slightly
askew in the plastic container. Given a choice between
truit and ( aesar salad, my friend asked for fruit, and the
server placed a small cup of grapes, melon and strawber
ry in the sighing mouth of the sandwich slices.
ITie sandwich, made of "sound fundamentals,
lacked a special sauce or any distinctive spin to separate
it fiom a dozen other sandwiches across campus. Of
course, this would have something to do with the way
Arbuckle caters to the customer— if you don't have the
extemporaneous creativity to create a sauce with the in
gredients behind the glass, there's just not going to be

one.
My other friend also ordered
smoked turkey, but she had hers
pressed with provolone, tomato, avo
cado, and lettuce on a French baguette
as a grilled panini. After the first few
bites, she admitted to having been in
timidated by the overwhelming vari
ety — from eggplants to roasted pep
pers to cranberry sauce — and her
temporary paralysis when faced with
such choice perhaps led her to make
unimaginative selections. However,
despite semi-blandness, she touted
the quality flavor of each individual
ingredient and said in sum, "This isn't
dining hall food."
Because I have a rampant obses
sion with burritos (which 1 blame on

Chipotle). I approached the taqueria.
After waiting for a few minutes in the
line, the taquerian (I think this is a
fair assumption of his title) turned to
me. It's worth noting that he was
beaming, as though he had stood
there, passing the time all day with
other burritos while secretly waiting
to make mine. "What would you like
today, young lady?" The ingredients
are laid out a la Subway, and you can
use words or simply point and grunt.
It's all the same to the taquerian, who
heaps hefty helpings into the tortilla
of your choice (plain, wheat and
spinach) and then rolls it up with
ease. I gestured to the marinated tofu
and vegetables, black beans, various
salsas and lettuce. 1 then seized the
plate with eager hands and carried it
five feet to the register. My friends
trolled around the serving area a lit
tle more, perhaps scanning the wide
variety of bottled drinks (I'd locked
in on a delicious bottled root beer

right away). The sandwich, panini
and burrito were each under 6 dol
lars, which makes Arbuckle a stark
contrast to its neighbor positioned di
rectly across Palm Drive: the Cool
Cafe.
On our way to sit down, we picked up
some of the novelty "Spudware": the
icing on Arbuckle's environmentally
conscience cake. 11l is biodegradable
cutlery is made of potato starch with a
few other minority additives, so when
you sort through your trash and recy
clable products post-meal, the ending
balance leaves you feeling like Cap
tain Planet.
The only genuine problem you might
come across during your visit to Ar
buckle is the seating. Amid lunch
hour congestion, the only open area
for my friends and me was the edge of
the staircase, which we claimed with a
shrug. We were soon enough distract
ed by food and conversation, though,
and both of which were superb.
