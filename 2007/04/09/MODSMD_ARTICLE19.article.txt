"I think it is wonderful that Stan
ford has a prize like this," Karl said.
"It is a tribute to both the Haas Cen
ter and Miriam Roland."
Karl has promoted student inter
est in human rights through her
Global Politics of Human Rights
course and by incorporating under
graduates into several pro bono
service projects. For example, some
of her students have helped her pre
pare testimony for civil trials involv
ing human rights violations in Fil Sal
vador. Karl has also mentored stu
dents interested in topics ranging
from post-genocide Rwanda to
HIV/AIDS issues in South Africa.
"We are fortunate to be at a uni
versity like Stanford, but this privi
lege carries responsibility to know
about the world and to do our small

part to make it better." Karl said.
When championing human rights
work. Karl said she is inspired by her
students and by the "extraordinary"
efforts of the global community.
"Without organizations like the
Center for Justice and Accountabili
ty and without human rights defend
ers who work together all the time
without any recognition, the type of
'justice cascade' we would like to see
happen — the end of impunity and
accountability we are trying to build
— would not be possible," she said.
Patell — who recently received
the 2007 Robert T. Davis Award —
offers programs and courses that en
courage GSB students to achieve
positive social change.
While serving as Associate Dean

of the GSB from 1985 until 1991,
Patell pioneered the Public Manage
ment Initiative (PMI). which allows
Public Management Program stu
dents to tackle projects involving
pressing social needs.
"By giving students the freedom of
choice, we could capitalize on the par
ticular strengths and experiences of
each year's group, as well as move the
spotlight around so that over the
course of ten years, many different
faculty members would be drawn in
during the one or two years that the
PMI topic coincided with their per
sonal areas of research and teaching,"
Patell said in an email to The Daily.
