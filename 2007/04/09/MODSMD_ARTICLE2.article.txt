### WEENA PUN 
While Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 and Presi
dent George W. Bush do not share much in common, they
were united on Saturday morning by a somewhat peculiar
similarity. Drawing inspiration from the White House's
annual Easter Egg Roll. Etchemendy and his wife Nancy
hosted Stanford's first Egg Roll at the Meyer-Buck 1 louse.
About three hundred graduate students and their fam
ilies attended the event, which was sponsored by the Of
fice of the Provost, the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
and the Escondido Village Community Associates.
As their children hunted for more than 1.5(H) plastic
Easter eggs, graduate students and their families ate
breakfast with the provost at his home.The Easter festiv
ities also included face-painting and a photo-op with the
Easter Bunny— played by Emily Rains, a graduate stu
dent in chemistry.
The festivities were popular among all attendees.
"We had never done anything in particular for Easter
before, but this was fun and the kids are enjoying it," said
mechanical engineering graduate student Joshua Webb
"They have set up the event really well."

More than a hundred children hunted for about 1,500 Easter eggs that had been hid
den on the lawn of the Meyer-Buck House on Saturday morning. The event marked
Stanford's first Easter Egg Roll.
The Etchemendys said they had
been planning the event since the
beginning of the school year. Before
the final egg roll competition, the
provost thanked the organizers and
the graduate students and their
families for making the event a sue

cess.
And though a few eggs remain
hidden, plans for another Egg Roll
next year are already being consid
ered.
"Graduate Students are impor
tant to keep Stanford a family
friendly place," Etchemendy said.
"So, if the GSC is still interested, we
will definitely do it again."
