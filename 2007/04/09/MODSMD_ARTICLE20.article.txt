## Editorial Board Death to the caterpillars? 
### 
Everyone seems to be talking about
how much they hate the caterpillars.
Hanging from oak trees in vast
hordes, these little hairy crawling things
make any walk (or worse, bike ride) fear
some for the unsuspecting passers-by along
Escondido or by Green Library. The in
evitable brief, stilted encounters with old
classmates and dorm-mates in White Plaza
now have an easy topic of conversation for
students to mutually gripe about. Hie cater
pillars even induced two graduating seniors
to form a mock ASSU Executive slate, dub
bing themselves the "Katerpillar Killerz."
accusing those who don't support them of
being "pro-caterpillar," certainly a harsh
charge in today's political climate.
And it appears that Ground Services has
noticed. According to the Stanford Report,
caterpillars seek new trees when the tree
they are in becomes too full for cocoons to
form. This means that no matter how many
caterpillars hang down from trees, there are
many more on the tree itself. Groundskeep
ers will be power washing them from trees,
as well as releasing spined soldier bugs (we
couldn't make this up), a natural predator of
the caterpillars. Nematodes, microscopic
worms, will probably be released later in the
season, as groundskeeping officials are an
ticipating several cycles of caterpillar
growth, although they suggest that this
year's proliferation is exceptionally large.

The caterpillar controversy brings up
several significant issues. First and fore
most. is it ethical to essentially eliminate the
caterpillar and moth population on cam
pus? Iliis remains a difficult question, and
one that is probably impossible to resolve.
We must remember, however, that Stanford
is not a natural environment. Every tree,
every branch, is endlessly manicured, and so
the caterpillars proliferate in an environ
ment without natural predators that would
have prevented a population explosion. In
Stanford's manufactured natural environ
ment. certain things must be regulated to
both preserve the campus' aesthetic as well
as some sort of environmental balance.
Second, student ire directed at the cater
pillars seems to be misplaced. Yes. it is enter
taining when a professor realizes a caterpil
lar is crawling in his hair during lecture, and
it is terrifying to bike through a patch of
them. But at the same time.it seems that stu
dents could direct their anger at something
far more important—the Iraq War. their
I:con 51 problem set, Vladimir Putin, any
thing else, really—as it seems that the larg
er. long-term significance of caterpillars is
about as big as their size.
The caterpillars may have a hard time
finding an advocate. It seems like most stu
dents will consent to their regulation. And if
that will move students along to larger and
more important things, so much the better.
