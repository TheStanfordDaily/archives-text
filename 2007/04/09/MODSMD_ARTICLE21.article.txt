# I am a caterpillar

### 
I am a caterpillar, nearly two weeks old,
and a proud soldier in the Tussock Moth
army. My life goals, succinctly put. in
clude preserving the beauty of our species,
ruining human lives and drinking pesticide
like it's my job. Did 1 mention ruining
human lives? Humans are foul, disgusting
creatures. I wish swift death upon them all.
1 was on a mission the other day to gather
intelligence confirming the presence of sever
al metallic machines located in the upper
reaches of Tresidder Union, a formidable
Enemy stronghold. 'ITiese machines, accord
ing to myth, are capable of producing entire
stacks of delicious Green Leaves upon entry
of certain passcodes — four to six digit strings
the Enemy has classified as PIN. If only the
leaves weren't so distastefully inscribed with
the mugs of human ex-Presidents like Grant,
a drunken buffoon, or Jackson, a slave-own
ing thug... (or was that Jefferson?)
As you know, the great scientists of the
last century (Lepidopterus,Calliteara,et al.)
first hypothesized that these machines
might be the Holy Grail of sustainable agri
culture— an unlimited supply of green
leaves, a Fountain of Youth, a Sorcerer's
Stone! Victuals to fill the cavernous stom
achs of the entire Caterpillarian race! We
are a species of voracious eaters after all.
Even the Enemy must grant us that!
But in my hunt,comrades, I experienced
a horrific thing. 1 was subjected to a most
brutal and perverse torture by our Enemy—
and not merely one of the faceless human
peons whom we regularly humiliate over
Lausen Mall, but a traitor — a former
human friendly.a former proponent of cater
pillar rights, and now the most despicable of
all created beings. Please, for the sake of our
species, urge your children to fear his name:
Alex Coley, scum of the natural universe —
an amoral creature if there ever was one.
After an exhausting trek up the Tresid
der stairway I arrived at my destination, the

remote region of the second floor, where
few caterpillars have ventured before. And,
by gum. the myths were all true! My first
sight of the mechanized leaf-spewing won
ders called ATM sent me into a rapture so
profound I nearly wept. Were I a swallowtail
caterpillar I would have secreted tears from
my beautiful false eyes. Alas, I 'm a lowly tus
sock...but pardon the racial interlude...
For that split second when I glimpsed
those beautiful machines, 1 was entranced,
calm as a chrysalis. The exquisite precision
with which the stack of leaves was ejected,
the flawless geometrical shape, the
smoothest edges on any green I've seen in
my long two weeks of larval living. Damn
those grubby human hands, always snatch
ing away what is rightfully ours!
But my elation was soon cut short. I heard
a terrific rumbling above me. I knew it was
someone speaking English, that ugliest of
tongues, and I cringed. I struggled to decipher
the words: "I ley little buddy. I hate to do this,
but you're eating pur trees. It's not right." Of
course! I recognized the voice of Alex Coley,
our ally, who went out of his way last spring to
defend our species' honor. I waved my tendrils
in a friendly salute, but he didn't reciprocate.
Instead, a sneer. "I'm gonna dominate
you. you stupid creature. Stop eating my
trees. Dlh. DIE Dili!" A maniacal laugh.
And then the sky went black. I looked up.


Coley

In Pursuit of the Epic
A massive, spherical globule, block
ing out the sun. hurtled down on me
at a ferocious velocity. Before 1 could
say "pupae" 1 was submersed in a vis
cous liquid, my ambulatory capacity
disabled. My unscientific guess is that
he spit on me.
Paralyzed, trapped in a sea of
mucus, foam, and saliva, the smell of
sour coffee lingering. Iliat was only
the beginning. The bastard had the
nerve to chuckle as 1 struggled to Ilex
my tendrils in vain hope of escaping.
Out of nowhere a huge gust of wind
blown from his lungs blasted my
fragile, immobile body, tossing me
across the surface of his spit. 1 skid
ded like a rag doll. The traitor Coley
buffeted me about this pool of odor
ous saliva like Neptune did Aeneas.
After what seemed an eternity of
cruel, thoughtless torture, of feeling
utterly powerless at the hands of a
true human sadist, he eventually lost

interest. With a wink and a Hick of
the index finger, he launched me
nearly five feet off the railing and 1
sailed down to what could have been
certain death Luckily, I only blacked
out. When 1 woke up the traitor was
gone, and I began the long crawl
back home. My fur has yet to dry.
My good larval friends, heed
these words. This is war, in the truest
sense of the word. Take a quick look
at the steps of Cubberley, and you'll
see a wasteland of fallen brothers,
rotting away, their poor bodies muti
lated under the unforgiving soles of
the Enemy shoes. You'll hear them
speak about you in the most irrever
ent tones. They will make Facebook
groups in the name of xenophobia.
Propaganda is already hot off the
press of their liberally biased media
operation, the so-called Stanford
Daily. But it's all true. We do hate
them. And we will let it be known.

Alex's computer has been hijacked by
a caterpillar seeking revenge. He's
probably tied up somewhere, but you
can try to reach him at acoleyOW&stan
ford.edu.
