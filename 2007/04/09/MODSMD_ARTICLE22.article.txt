Grad students don't deserve dazzle
Dear Stanford Daily.
I am writing in regards to Niraj Sheth
'07's article in Thursday's paper. "ASSU
platforms don't dazzle (JSC."
Of course not. Stanford Daily. Of course
not!
Let me explain: What the hell do we
know about graduate students?
To Anthony Scodary 'OS and me 'OS. the
very idea of a graduate student is both para
doxical and unprofitable. Let's look at the
phrase itself, for starters. We have the adjective
"graduate" — so these are "graduated stu
dents?" Excuse me? Are they students or
graduates or what? Are they like the mythical
centaur (which was purported to be half man
and half horse)? And there is a whole commu
nity of these mystery folk stuck to the east side
of our campus like some sort of louse? More
over. one that will probably swell up even
yuckier and puffier if we offer it dental plans?
I'm like, huh? And Anthony 'OS's like. I
sure don't smell any clams in this. As you
know, we at Submit freely acknowledge that
exploitation—enlightened greed, or maybe
just greed—is a bit of what this campus
needs (with a generous drizzling of promis
es. since we have promised to make the

most). But you can't make money off a grad
uated student, since such a thing cannot
exist. It'd be like ripping off a unicorn.
So we didn't go to the GSC meeting. In
stead, we ventured forth to the 750 to try and
spot such a fantastic creature in its native
habitat.
And even that was a failure,since Antho
ny 'OS forgot his ID and we had to sit at a
table in the corner and 1 almost got hit in the
eye with a pool cue and the guy playing
scratched on that shot so everything was a
complete waste. A waste! As we had sus
pected from the beginning. We got in Antho
ny OS's jeep and went home, determined to
save our dazzle for another day.
The Submit slate would also like to point
out that there's only one Lakshmi Karra'OSin
this campaign, and she has partnered herself
with the inoffensively bland Brett Hammond
'OS. Whereas Sheth incorrectly mates her with
Mershey Avula 'OS — and if the FedF.x
Kinko's didn't badly scramble their banner or
ders,! would say that Avula 'OS and Jones 'OS
have been making it since last week at least.
But Lakshmi —can we call you Lakshmi
'OS?—if you lind yourself a bit at odds in all
this swapping, we at Submit have your back
and would like to buy you things.
