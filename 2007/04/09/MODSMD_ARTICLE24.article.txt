# An American in Parisian footwear
## 
### 
I've been in Paris for over a week now and
1 have yet to see a Parisian in flip-flops.
True, it has been chilly these past few days,
but still warm enough to be considered "san
dal weather." And certainly. I've seen many
Parisians in sandals. Strappy, lacy, high
heeled sandals. So clearly, it's not a matter of
the cold.
I have a daily 30-minute commute to and
from the Stanford center and during that
hour or so on the metro, I've gotten to know
Parisian shoe preferences quite well. Fancy
and uncomfortable seem to be all the rage.
You can get away with wearing sneakers, but
only if you're jogging or doing some other
kind of exercise.
One may wonder, why do I spend my time
on the metro looking at people's feet? Well,
that's just the way things are done around
here. As the lovely people at the center
warned us during orientation, there are very
strict etiquette rules and guidelines we must
follow when riding the metro. Don't eat or
drink,speak only in hushed tones (and never
on a cell phone) and. most importantly, never
look strangers in the eye. Catching some
one's eye or. heaven forbid, smiling is imme
diately taken as an invitation.
So that leaves those metro-goers not look
ing for a date with only two options: Keep
your nose stuck in a book or newspaper or. in
the absence of good reading material, sit qui
etly and look at your (and other people's)
feet. And since I've made a habit of forget
ting my books at home, I usually end up
doing the latter. Which, by the way, is harder
than it sounds because, growing up in subur

bia, my natural tendency is to smile at and
strike up conversations with pretty much
everyone.
But, generally, people here are very insis
tent on keeping their personal space, well,
personal. So chitchatting with strangers in
awkward social situations (i.e. the metro and
elevators), complimenting a random
woman's outfit or smiling at people you don't
know are all entirely out of the question.The
only exceptions are dogs and babies. You can
smile at dogs and babies. If the dog and/or
baby are exceptionally cute, you can even
start a conversation with the owner/parent.
But the conversation can't stray from the
topic of the dog's/baby's cuteness.
It seems strange that a city famous for
people-watching in charming cafes would
have such a strong tradition of "keeping to
oneself." After all, nearly every cafe is
arranged so that all of the chairs face out onto
the street, giving cafe patrons a clear view of
passers-by. It's like the city is practically beg
ging you to interact with strangers.
But that's simply not the case. You can
look at others when in a cafe, but trying to
start a conversation probably wouldn't go

over so well. And once you leave the cafe (the
zone of permitted staring), it's back to avoid
ing eye contact.
ITiat's the thing about Paris, there's a
specified time and place for everything. And
once you're out of that time and place, doing
whatever it was that was allowed is no longer
acceptable. If you're not at a cafe, you don't
look at other people; if it's not an appropriate
mealtime,you don't snack; if it is an appropri
ate mealtime and you're eating with others,
you don't excuse yourself to use the rest
room.
Life here isn't about being comfortable or
friendly or living in the spur of the moment.
It's about doing what's supposed to be done,
when it's supposed to be done and how it's
supposed to be done. Or to put it more sim
ply, it's about tradition.
Which, finally, brings me back to shoes.
Just like Parisians don't look at each other on
the metro because it's not the way things are
done, so they don't wear flip-flops because
it's not the way things are done. And just like
I've bitten the bullet and overcome my ten
dency to smile, so I've put away my flip-flops
for the quarter. (And, since I don't exercise,
also my sneakers. So, really all of my even
somewhat comfortable shoes.) Which is a
shame because I have a sneaking suspicion
that I'm going to walk more this quarter than
1 have in my entire life and doing it in a sim
ple pair of flip-flops would probably spare
me some pain.
