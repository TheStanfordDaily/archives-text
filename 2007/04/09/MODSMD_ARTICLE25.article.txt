## Give justice a chance 
### ABBY BURNS 
William Blackstonc said of the justice sys
tem that it would he "[h]etter that ten guilty
persons escape than that one innocent suf
fer." Yet many people do suffer: since l ( )73,
over 230 innocent individuals in the United
States have been wrongfully convicted of
crimes for which they were subsequently
cleared — proof that our criminal justice sys
tem is far from perfect. What this says to me
is that there are flaws in our criminal justice
system that need to be — and, perhaps more
importantly, cart be — fixed.
Nick Yarris can tell you about flaws in the
system. Yarris spent 22 years on Pennsylva
nia's death row for the murder of Linda Mae
Craig. During his trial, detectives manipulat
ed witnesses into falsely identifying Yarris
and prosecutors attempted to destroy evi
dence that could be used to prove Yarris' in
nocence. After his conviction. Yarris would

spend fifteen years appealing for DNA evi
dence to be tested — the same DNA evi
dence that would finally and conclusively
prove his innocence in 2003.
Common sense would say that this would
be the end of Yarris' ordeal — common
sense would be too much to hope for with the
Delaware County District Attorney's Office.
Yarris was released eight months later "nolle
prosequi" — meaning that the DA's office
could arrest and retry him on this same
charge at a later date. Further, despite actual
ly being innocent of this crime, Yarris is still
subject to the "three strikes law:" if he is ever
convicted of another crime, he will be put
away for life — despite that he was innocent
of those felonies that would qualify him for
life in prison in the first place.
Yarris' story demonstrates not only how
our criminal justice system is flawed, but,
more powerfully, suggests solutions for how
to improve it:

(1 )Efficiently test DNA evidence. Yarris
spent over a decade on death row after tech
nology existed that could prove his inno
cence. Especially for a death row case, let
there he no doubt about the guilt or inno
cence of the convict.
(2)lrnprove post-release compensation for
exonerees. Exonerees receive less help than a
post-release guilty inmate, who likely receives
assistance with job training, psychological
counseling, and other reintegration services.
Currently, a few prisons give "gate money."
ranging from $ 10 to $20(). to exonerees for im
mediate needs and nothing more.
(3)Automatically expunge the criminal
records of released defendants. It can be
years before an exoneree's criminal record is
finally cleared — years in which the record
prevents the innocent individual from secur
ing gainful employment.
