for the Cardinal against a
Pac-10 opponent.The 0-6 record is the team's worst start in the
conference since it opened with six straight losses in coach Mark
Marquess' first season as skipper in 1977.
Stanford did win three in a row earlier this season against
California — a Pac-10 opponent — in a non-conference series.
"Honestly, we're down right now because of the sweep, but
baseball is a funny game," sophomore starter Jeremy Bleich

said. "We can't take a loss and have it carry over to the next
game — all it can do is hurt you. it won't help you. We know
right now we don't feel it. but by Tuesday we've got to be posi
tive."
The Sun Devils, who were picked to finish first in the Pac-10
after taking nine of 14 first-place votes in a preseason poll, move
to 6-0 against the Cardinal in Tempe. Ariz... dating back to 2005.
Known for its prolific offense, Arizona State currently has
four players in the top ten in the conference RBls and five in top

falls to below .500 and remains winless in Pac-10 play.
ten batting averages. But their starters may have had a
bigger impact than the bats. Mike Leake (7-1) and Brian
Mores (7-1) shut down the Cardinal in the Thursday and
Saturday games, each pitching over eight innings and re
tiring at least ten batters in a row. In the series finale, Flo
res allowed one unearned run and four hits in 8.1 in
nings.
"They're good hitters, but they're still just hitters."
Bleich said. "They weren't as good as advertised, I don't
think, we just didn't make the pitches that we needed to.
Obviously, they're a good offensive team and when you
make bad pitches they will hurt you. but they're definite
ly a beatable team."
On Saturday, junior Nolan Gallagher struggled from
the outset in his shortest outing of the year (2 IP). Gal
lagher (2-4) walked the first two batters he faced before
hitting Erie Sogard to load the bases. On the next play,
sophomore first baseman Brent Milleville threw short
on a potential double play ball at the plate, allowing
leadotf man 'Ilm Smith to score. The Sun Devils would
add a run on a Petey Parramore sacrifice fly, going up 2-
0 without recording a hit.
Arizona State never looked back, scoring in each of
the next four innings. Kiel Roling led the charge with
two home runs, including a two-run shot in a five-run
fifth inning that put the game completely out of reach at
13-0.
In the Friday game, Stanford was kept in the game of
fensively by sophomore center fielder Sean Ratliff (2-4,
7 RBI). Ratliff started things in the seventh inning with
an inside-the-park grand slam. The Cardinal leadoff hit
ter smacked a ball deep to the right center gap past a div
ing Smith. Despite tripping up a bit on his way between
third and home. Ratliff made it safely across to tie the
game at 5-5.
In the eighth. Ratliff would get a homerun the more
conventional way with a three-run drive over the fence
in the right field corner, making the score 11 -8.
The Sun Devils made their crucial push in the sev
enth. With one out and the score tied at 5-5, Ike Davis
reached on a fielding error by junior second baseman
Adam Sorgi.Two batters later, C.J. Retherford took an
offering from sophomore Tom Stilson to right-center for
a three-run double stretching the Sun Devil lead to 8-5.
Junior David Stringer took the loss (0-1) in his first deci
sion of the year while Joey Parigi (3-1) took the victory.
Arizona State would claw back from a 4-0 deficit in
the season opener before taking its first lead of the game
in the seventh inning.Taking over for starter Jeremy Ble
ich (1-5) after he was escorted off the field by a trainer,
junior Erik Davis gave up a one-out RBI single to Rol
ing (4-4.2 RBI). Brett Wallace scored from second after
reaching on his Pac-10 best 26th walk of the season.

surgery, recorded a hit in all three games, extending his

conference since it opened with six straight losses in coach Mark
Marquess' first season as skipper in 1977.
Stanford did win three in a row earlier this season against
California — a Pac-10 opponent — in a non-conference series.
"Honestly, we're down right now because of the sweep, but
baseball is a funny game," sophomore starter Jeremy Bleich

sophomore first baseman Brent Milleville threw short
