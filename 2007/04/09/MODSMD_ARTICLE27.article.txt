# Softball drops two to rival California
## Cardinal's bats fall silent in weekend series 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team took
a step backwards this weekend as it lost two
out of three to Bay Area-rival California.
The Cardinal (27-9,3-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped the first and last match
ups of the three-game series against the
only unranked team in the Pac-10. Cal (25-
20, 2-4) started the season in the rankings
but fell out after performing poorly in its
non-conference schedule.
Stanford's lineup was plagued by an of
fensive power outage during the series.The
squad had only eight hits in 48 combined
at-bats in the two losses to the Golden
Bears, and seven of those eight hits were
singles.
Furthermore, the Cardinal barely man
aged to overcome a defensive niiscue to
win the middle game of the series after an
error let Cal's leadoff hitter on in the first
inning. That player scored on a two-out
grand slam later in the inning.
I"he first game of the weekend, hosted
by Stanford, moved quickly as both pitch

ers mowed down the opposing batters one
after another. Sophomore Missy Penna
struek out five of the first six hatters she
faced,but her game went off the rails in the
top of the fifth inning when she allowed a
two-out, three-run homer.That was all the
offense the Golden Bears needed to claim

Cal pitcher Lauren Frankiewicz had no
such difficulties. She kept a dormant Stan

allowing only three singles —by Penna,
junior third baseman Michelle Smith and
freshman center fielder Alissa Haber —
and two walks through seven shutout in
nings. Only one Cardinal base-runner ad

Stanford regained its offensive touch in
the second game against Cal. at Levine-
Fricke Field in Berkeley. After senior left
fielder Jackie Rinehart grounded out to
start the game, the Cardinal drew three suc
cessive walks to load the bases before
freshman catcher Rosey Neill hit a two-
RBI double to right-center field.
After Penna (19-3) surrendered the
two-out grand slam in the bottom of the
first inning, Stanford responded to retake
the lead for good in the top of the second.
I laber. who finished the day with two RBI
and three runs scored on two-for-four hit
ling, chased Cal's second pitcher of the day
by smashing a triple down the left-field line

Sophomore hurler Missy Penna allowed a grand slam in
Saturday's contest vs. Cal. Luckily, her offense was able to
pull it together for the 8-6 Cardinal victory.
But whatever momentum Stan
ford had regained on Friday was lost
in the next days rubber match. ITie
Bears burst out for five runs in the
top of the second inning against Car
dinal starter junior Becky McCul
lough (8-6) on a wild pitch and two
two-run home runs. Cal had widened
its lead to 7-0 before I laber hit a solo
shot to center field in the fifth inning.
Haber (two-for-two) was the only
Cardinal batter to advance past sec
ond base as Cal's Frankiewicz bore
down on Stanford yet again.
Stanford hosts St. Mary's in a
non-conference game on Wednes
day before heading south for the
weekend to play a game against Ari
zona and a pair against Arizona
State.
