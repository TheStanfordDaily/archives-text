the job done against two of the nation's top teams from South
ern California, losing 3-1 to USC on Senior Day.
Game one went point-for-point until
Stanford broke away with a four
point lead, 19-15, forcing a Pepper
dine time out. A kill by Paul Carroll
and a Stanford hitting error helped to
shorten the Cardinal lead, and even
tually both teams would only trail by

Stanford was unable to follow
through during the last moments of
the game, allowing Pepperdine to
take the game at 27-30.
During game three, Pepperdine
jumped to an early lead of 6-3. even

game.The Waves took a calming time
out at 26-25, which led to Pepperdine

rack up 30 kills, hitting .400 on the
evening and helping the Waves to
win the match.
"I was really pleased with the way
that we played this weekend, but es
pecially on Friday," Ceran said. "We
were outmatched in experience and
skill level with the top team in the
country. To take a game off of a team
like Pepperdine is definitely a high
light of our season."
Despite the loss on Friday, the
Stanford team was determined to
win its last home game for its depart
ing seniors. The Cardinal scored five
service aces and hit .565 against the

teams fought for the lead and only
held it for a few points at a time. C.J.
Schellenberg finally managed to
bring his team to game point at 29-26,
but Romero would not have it, ex
tending the game with a block and a
service ace. 1 lowever. Romero's sin
gle efforts were not enough to come
back against the Trojans, who ended
game three at 30-28 with a kill by
Hunter Current.
Knowing that a game four win
would be crucial to bring the match
to a fifth game for a potential last
home victory, the Cardinal fought
the Trojans again until the very end.
Both teams exchanged the lead
many times until USC went on a
three-point run.bringing the score to
28-25. The Cardinal looked to be on
its way to making a comeback when

making the score 28-26. Stanford lost
composure on a hitting error, which
led to a Trojan game and match vic
tory with a game three score of 30-
26.

two matches. Hawaii is a good but
beatable team and we look forward
to ending the season on a good note
next week."
