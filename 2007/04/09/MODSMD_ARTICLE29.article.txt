### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Seniors Anne Yelsey and Theresa
Logar finished off their careers in just
the way they started them: in a domi
nating fashion.
Playing in the final home match of
their careers, Logar and Yelsey, along
with the rest of their Stanford team
mates, had little trouble in their
matches against Washington State
and Washington this past weekend.
Friday's match against Washing
ton State was a complete sweep. 7-0.
Saturday's match against the Huskies
of Washington wasn't much different.
Stanford had little trouble, winning
by a final score of 6-1.
Logar was happy with the Cardi
nal's performance in her final match.
"1 think that we played really
well," she said. "It was kind of a tune
up for next weekend [against the
LA. schools]."
Yelsey, who together with Logar
has led the Cardinal to three consec
utive NCAA and Pac-10 titles,
agreed.
"1 thought we played really well."
she said, 'it was kind of nerve-wrack
ing because they were our last two
home matches, but everybody played
well."
In between the singles and dou
bles portion of Saturday's match
against Washington, Yelsey and
Logar were honored for their four
years of commitment and achieve
ments as Cardinal tennis players.
It was emotional throughout the
ceremony, with assistant coach
Frankie Brennan listing the players'
respective accomplishments and
head coach Lele Forood speaking
more about their individual and per
sonal merits.
Logar described the ambivalence
of the experience. The senior co-cap
tain went on to say that "[the fact that
it was my last home match] didn't re
ally hit me until we did the little cere
mony between singles and
doubles...it was bittersweet.
"Yesterday was the culmination of
everything," she added."Stanford re
ally allowed me to find myself as a
tennis player. I've grown so much as a
player. I'm now going to have to
broaden my horizons as a tennis play
er, which is good and bad."
Yelsey was a little less conflicted, but
still enjoyed the ceremony alongside
her fellow senior.
"It was great," she said."lt was re
ally nice to hear nice words. It was re
ally emotional."
