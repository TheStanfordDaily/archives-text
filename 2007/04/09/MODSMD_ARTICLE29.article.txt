## Cardinal keeps on rolling Top-ranked Stanford remains perfect at home with weekend wins 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Seniors Anne Yelsey and Theresa
Logar finished off their careers in just
the way they started them: in a domi
nating fashion.
Playing in the final home match of
their careers, Logar and Yelsey, along
with the rest of their Stanford team
mates, had little trouble in their
matches against Washington State
and Washington this past weekend.
Friday's match against Washing
ton State was a complete sweep. 7-0.
Saturday's match against the Huskies
of Washington wasn't much different.
Stanford had little trouble, winning
by a final score of 6-1.
Logar was happy with the Cardi
nal's performance in her final match.
"1 think that we played really
well," she said. "It was kind of a tune
up for next weekend [against the
LA. schools]."
Yelsey, who together with Logar
has led the Cardinal to three consec
utive NCAA and Pac-10 titles,
agreed.
"1 thought we played really well."
she said, 'it was kind of nerve-wrack
ing because they were our last two
home matches, but everybody played
well."
In between the singles and dou
bles portion of Saturday's match
against Washington, Yelsey and
Logar were honored for their four
years of commitment and achieve
ments as Cardinal tennis players.
It was emotional throughout the
ceremony, with assistant coach
Frankie Brennan listing the players'
respective accomplishments and
head coach Lele Forood speaking
more about their individual and per
sonal merits.
Logar described the ambivalence
of the experience. The senior co-cap
tain went on to say that "[the fact that
it was my last home match] didn't re
ally hit me until we did the little cere
mony between singles and
doubles...it was bittersweet.
"Yesterday was the culmination of
everything," she added."Stanford re
ally allowed me to find myself as a
tennis player. I've grown so much as a
player. I'm now going to have to
broaden my horizons as a tennis play
er, which is good and bad."
Yelsey was a little less conflicted, but
still enjoyed the ceremony alongside
her fellow senior.
"It was great," she said."lt was re
ally nice to hear nice words. It was re
ally emotional."
After the ceremony, the Cardinal
completed its sweep of the Washing
ton schools with its stellar singles
play. Junior Whitney Deason, the
line-up's No. 4 player, was the only
team member to suffer a loss.
Logar spoke on her feelings about
Senior Weekend, and the possible ef
fects that it had on the match.
"1 got kind of stressed out. 1 want
ed to play really well because it was
my last time out there," she said.
"After the match, it didn't feel like
my last home match. 1 don't think I'll
accept that until I'm walking across
the stage at commencement. I played
well, which I'm really proud of. Anne
also played really well."
Yelsey had similar thoughts as she
approached the end of a Stanford ca
reer that includes a 103-1 team dual
match record.
"I was a little on edge and a little
more emotional [than usual|." the ac
complished senior said. "It was hard

to think straight on the court, but
that's how it goes.
"Its Senior Day and it's supposed
to be emotional," Yelsey continued.
"1 think everyone was a little off be
cause ol the big presentation, but we
still won handily; everybody did a
great job."
Despite the festivities of Senior
Weekend, the Cardinal isjust nearing
the stretch run of its season.The next
three matches will be against the
class of the Pacific-10 Conference:
Cal and the L.A. schools, UCLA and
Southern California. After that, it's
the Pac-10 Individual Champi
onships. and then straight into the
NCAA Championships in May.
A crucial factor for the Cardinal
recently has been the team's im
proved health. Stanford suffered a
stretch in the middle of the season
where several players had injuries or
illnesses of many varieties; despite
this, the Cardinal women were able
to make it out with their one-loss
record intact. Now that the team is
healthy, there's no telling how good
they can be.
Yelsey and Logar, both key com
ponents to the last three national

champion Stanford teams, gave their
perspectives on where they think
their team stands right now.
"1 think that the team is playing
well," Logar said."We're getting very
healthy, which is always good. I think
that by the time we hit Pac-10, the
team will be running on all cylin
ders."
When it comes down to it, the Car
dinal is still about business. The Se
nior Day activities were emotional,
but the seniors themselves now have
a major task at the forefront of their
agenda: winning a fourth straight na
tional title.
Yelsey, the businesslike leader for
Stanford, made this clear.
"It was sad and emotional to be
playing at home for the last time, but
I think we're all looking forward to
the end of the season. We have these
big matches coming up; it's exciting
because NCAAs are coming around
the corner. Maybe [Senior Day] is
bittersweet, but we're all looking for
ward to the end of the year and going
out with a bang."

recently has been the team's im
proved health. Stanford suffered a
stretch in the middle of the season
where several players had injuries or
illnesses of many varieties; despite
this, the Cardinal women were able
to make it out with their one-loss
record intact. Now that the team is
healthy, there's no telling how good
they can be.
Yelsey and Logar, both key com
ponents to the last three national

champion Stanford teams, gave their
perspectives on where they think
their team stands right now.
"1 think that the team is playing
well," Logar said."We're getting very
healthy, which is always good. I think
that by the time we hit Pac-10, the
team will be running on all cylin
ders."
When it comes down to it, the Car
dinal is still about business. The Se
nior Day activities were emotional,
but the seniors themselves now have
a major task at the forefront of their
agenda: winning a fourth straight na
tional title.
Yelsey, the businesslike leader for
Stanford, made this clear.
"It was sad and emotional to be
playing at home for the last time, but
I think we're all looking forward to
the end of the season. We have these
big matches coming up; it's exciting
because NCAAs are coming around
the corner. Maybe [Senior Day] is
bittersweet, but we're all looking for
ward to the end of the year and going
out with a bang."
