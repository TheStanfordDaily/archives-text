## Nurse union ratifies new three-year contract Six percent pay increases specified each year until 2010 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
A new three-year contract agreement was
ratified by the union that represents the nurses
at Stanford's hospitals last Thursday.
'it's a great step in the right direction," said

Sarah Staley.a spokesperson for Stanford Hos
pitals and Clinics (SHC) and the Lucille
Packard Children's I lospital (LPCH), after the
Friday announcement. "It's indicative of a posi
tive three years that we look forward to."
The new agreement was tentatively accepted
by Committee for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement (CRONA) on Mar. 30 following
nearly three months of negotiations. 'Ilie final
agreement was reached with the help of a feder
al mediator after CRONA members voted down
an earlier version of the contract on Mar. 20.

Although union leaders recommended that
their members ratify the new contract, CRONA
president Lorie Johnson said that many of the
union's leaders are disappointed with the agree
ment's retirement and salary provisions.
"At Stanford and Packard, nurses hired after
1997 do not have medical insurance when they
retire," Johnson said. "We arc the only hospital
in the Bay Area that does not offer medical in
surance to our retirees if they were hired after
1997."
"Compared to other contracts in
the Bay Area, this is significantly infe
rior to the contracts of other hospi
tals,' she added. "[The contract's]
across-the-board increases puts us in
the middle — the average — in
terms of the wages of other hospitals.
When other hospitals start negotiat
ing this year, it will put us even more
behind."
The salary increases specified in
the contract are six percent in the
first year, 5.5 percent in the second
year and another 5.5 percent in the
third year. In a press release, SHC
asserted that the pay raises will
"make SHC and LPCH nurses
among the best compensated in the
Bay Area" — a statement that Sta
ley said was based on an internal
audit of Bay Area hospitals con
ducted by SHC.

"I think the hospital certainly
came to the table listening to the con
cerns of the nurses and really accu
rately trying to address them in a way
that would make the contract fair
and highly competitive," Staley said.
"We were mindful of the fact that this
is a three year contract — it is very
fair and competitive for the next
three years."
Johnson said that CRONA would
continue to work with both hospitals
to improve nurses' salaries and bene
fits.
"We have made it known to the
hospital during the negotiations that
retirement is something that we are
going to be addressing next time [in
2010], including medical insurance
for nurses who are going to be retir
ing," she said. "We are going to be
educating our membership."
SHC and LPCH representatives
were adamant that their organiza
tions are devoted to providing their
employees with competitive salaries
and other packages.
"We value our nurses highly and
recognize their dedication and com

mitment to providing the highest
quality care at our hospitals," said
SHC President Martha H. Marsh, in
a statement.
"Both [hospitals] are looking to
both recruit and retain the best
healthcare professionals," Staley
added. " Ibis agreement is certainly
reflective of that."
The contract will expire on Mar.
31.2010.
