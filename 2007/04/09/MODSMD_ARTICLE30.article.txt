# Golf finishes season strong
## No. 9 women's golf edges Denver for win 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a final tune-up before the postsea
son. the No. 9 Stanford women's golf team
ended its spring in winning fashion at the
2007 Peg Barnard Collegiate. The event
marked the Cardinal's second tournament
victory of the season and yet another top
ten finish for its record.
Over the course of the two-day event,
the Cardinal shot a four-over-par 572 (287-
285) for a four-stroke victory over No. 23
Denver (286-290 — 576). After the first day
of play. Stanford had trailed Denver by a
stroke. I iowever. a strong final day pushed
the Card ahead of the Pioneers.
Fellow Pacific-10 Conference opponent
Oregon State (586) came in at third, fol
lowed by Hawaii (592). Long Beach State
(592) and San Francisco (593). Rounding
out the rest of field were Washington State
(594). San Jose State (599), Fresno State
(608). Portland State (620) and UC-Davis

(620).
The Cardinal win came at the par-71,
6,037-yard Stanford Golf Course, where the
Stanford Intercollegiate was held last Octo
ber. In that event, senior Lauren Todd's
strong play led the team to a fourth place
finish.This time around was no different, as
Todd finished second overall with a 137 (70-
67). one stroke from the tournament's two
round record. Todd had ten birdies in the
event.
Long Beach State's Kay Hoey trumped
I'odd in both accolades, though. I ler eight
under 134 earned her top individual honors
for the tourney and broke the tournament
two-round record set back in IW7 by San
Jose State's Janice Moody.
Following Todd was freshman Catherina
Wang, who tied for fourth with a 142 (74-
68). During the weekend, Wang had 11
birdies, which could greatly help the Cardi
nal lineup in the postseason.
Sophomore Mari Chun finished ninth in
the tourney with a 144 (71-73). Chun's re
cent strong play is also good news for the
Cardinal cause. This is her second top ten
finish following last week's second place
standing at the PING ASU Invitational.
With no juniors on Stanford's roster, these
two golfers figure to be the team's leaders of
the future.
For now, Stanford is led by two formi
dable players in seniors Todd and Jen
nifer Tangtiphaiboontana. Tangtiphai
boontana finished 23rd with a 150 (73-
77), her second straight sub-par perform
ance. At the beginning of the spring sea
son, Tangtiphaiboontana led the Cardi
nal outright with her strong play. Her cur
rent slump jeopardizes Stanford's desire
to go deep in the postseason.
Nonetheless, these four players pose
an intimidating lineup for any Pac-1() or
other non-conference opponents. Over
the two days, Stanford totaled 33 birdies
to lead all visiting teams.The Card will be
counting on strong performances from
these four in the upcoming postseason.
Sophomore Ki-Shui Liao tied
Tangtiphaiboontana with both rounds of
75 and freshman Angela King finished at
35th. The tourney also served as a final
regular-season farewell to the four sen
iors on the team: Todd. Tangtiphaiboon
tana, Saana Rapakko and Jenna Seki.
Rapakko tied King with a 153, and Seki
shot a five-over 76 on the final day.
The Cardinal is now primed for the
postseason with two strong finishes in its
final regular season tournaments. With
last week's sixth place finish at the PING
ASU Invite and this weekend's victory at
home, momentum appears to be with
Stanford. However, Stanford will surely
need all it can get when it faces a strong
Pac-10 Conference.
The postseason begins at the end of
the month when Stanford heads to Seat
tle for the Pac-10 Women's Golf Cham
pionships. The three-day event will last
Apr. 23-25. Last year, the Cardinal fin
ished seventh in the Pac-10,led by Chun,
then a freshman.
Following the Pac-10 tourney are the
NCAA Regional Championships and
NCAA Women's Golf Championships,
both in May. Although the Cardinal is
faced with a difficult task at hand, it now
has a two week break to recover and re
group.
Interestingly, history may be on Stan
ford's side as well.The last time the Car
dinal headed to Washington, it took the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational, its first vic
tory' of the season. Chun also took top in
dividual honors. The Cardinal women
can only hope that another trip to the
Evergreen State will produce similar re
sults.
