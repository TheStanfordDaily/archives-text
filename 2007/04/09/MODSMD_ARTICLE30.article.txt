As a final tune-up before the postsea
son. the No. 9 Stanford women's golf team
ended its spring in winning fashion at the
2007 Peg Barnard Collegiate. The event
marked the Cardinal's second tournament
victory of the season and yet another top
ten finish for its record.
Over the course of the two-day event,
the Cardinal shot a four-over-par 572 (287-
285) for a four-stroke victory over No. 23
Denver (286-290 â€” 576). After the first day

event.

two-round record set back in IW7 by San
Jose State's Janice Moody.
Following Todd was freshman Catherina
Wang, who tied for fourth with a 142 (74-

the tourney with a 144 (71-73). Chun's re
