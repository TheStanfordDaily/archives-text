### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Students around campus were
warned to stay inside Saturday after
noon as smoke from a Redwood City

gent scent of burning plastic and
metal.
The two-alarm blaze that started
at a metal scrap yard at the Port of
Redwood City around 8 a.m. Satur
day could not be doused until 6:30
a.m. Sunday. The San Jose Mercury
News reported that thousands of
people called 911. and 16.000 auto
mated telephone calls were made to

local residents. More than 60 fire
fighters were involved in the effort
to control the blaze, and people as
far south as the Santa Cruz Moun
tains said they could smell the
fumes.
Air inspectors monitored the
skies to test for toxins, and Resident
Assistants in several dorms warned
students to close windows and stay
inside. Several cities issued advi
sories for residents with breathing
problems, elderly people and young
children. No one was reported to be
hospitalized as a result of the fire or
the air pollution.
