### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Beginning next year, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission will ac
cept the Common Application and a
Stanford-specific supplement for all
applicants to the University. The
switch to the Common App. will also
bring a later Regular Decision dead
line: high-school seniors will now
have until Jan. 1 to send in their ap
plications as opposed to the old Pec.
15 benchmark.
The Common Application is of
fered by about 3(K) colleges as a
streamlined way for student to sub
mit applications to multiple colleges.
"We think that the Common Ap
plication is an incredibly convenient
way for students to apply to college,"
said Richard Shaw. Dean of Under

Aid. "Plus, it provides wonderful ac

The Office of I Jndergraduate Ad
mission announced on Mar. 30 that
2.4fi5 of almost 24.(MM) freshman ap
plicants were offered admission for
the 2(X)7-2(X)K school year. These ap

plicants, like those in years prior, all
applied to the University using a par
ticular Stanford application distinct
from the Common App.
Shaw said that the change in the
application deadline has thus far
been well-received by high school
guidance counselors and members of
the Stanford community
"Since most colleges and univer
sities have a Jan. 1 deadline, our Dec.
15 deadline has frustrated high
school students and counselors, who
have felt pressured to meet the earli
er deadline," Shaw said. "The faculty
and the provost are also very sup
portive of the move to the Common
Application. It's a win-win situation
for everyone."
Shaw stated that the financial aid
process will also be changed to better
accommodate the Jan. 1 application
deadline. I lowever.the Office of Ad
missions intends to keep its current
dates for mailing letters of accept

Student reactions to the applica
