# ADMINISTRATION
## Common App. adopted Application deadline extended to Jan 1 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Beginning next year, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission will ac
cept the Common Application and a
Stanford-specific supplement for all
applicants to the University. The
switch to the Common App. will also
bring a later Regular Decision dead
line: high-school seniors will now
have until Jan. 1 to send in their ap
plications as opposed to the old Pec.
15 benchmark.
The Common Application is of
fered by about 3(K) colleges as a
streamlined way for student to sub
mit applications to multiple colleges.
"We think that the Common Ap
plication is an incredibly convenient
way for students to apply to college,"
said Richard Shaw. Dean of Under
graduate Admission and Financial
Aid. "Plus, it provides wonderful ac
cess for applicants."
The Office of I Jndergraduate Ad
mission announced on Mar. 30 that
2.4fi5 of almost 24.(MM) freshman ap
plicants were offered admission for
the 2(X)7-2(X)K school year. These ap

plicants, like those in years prior, all
applied to the University using a par
ticular Stanford application distinct
from the Common App.
Shaw said that the change in the
application deadline has thus far
been well-received by high school
guidance counselors and members of
the Stanford community
"Since most colleges and univer
sities have a Jan. 1 deadline, our Dec.
15 deadline has frustrated high
school students and counselors, who
have felt pressured to meet the earli
er deadline," Shaw said. "The faculty
and the provost are also very sup
portive of the move to the Common
Application. It's a win-win situation
for everyone."
Shaw stated that the financial aid
process will also be changed to better
accommodate the Jan. 1 application
deadline. I lowever.the Office of Ad
missions intends to keep its current
dates for mailing letters of accept
ance.
Student reactions to the applica
tion changes were mixed. Betsy
Walls 'OS said she would have pre
ferred to use the Common App.
when she applied to the University
and expressed hope that other col
leges with unique applications would
follow Stanford's lead.
"I think this decision will remove
lots of the busy work from applica
tions," Walls said. "1 know that it
might have been seen as some type of
status indicator that we had our own
application, but Stanford doesn't
need a separate application ty.show
its overwhelming awesomeness."
Judith Pond '08 said that one of the
primary advantages of the Common

App. is its ability to streamline the
process of applying for fee waivers.
"For schools that accept only
their own application, students have
to contact each individual admis
sions office and provide documenta
tion to every school," Pond said.
"With the Common Application,
certain students, such as those who
receive fee waivers from the College
Board for the SAT, can automatical
ly qualify for up to four waivers,
making the application process more
accessible and comfortable for stu
dents who are unable to pay exorbi
tant application fees."
Eric Chow '08. however, said he

was concerned about the decision to
switch.
"You'll get a lot of students only
filling out the Common Application,
and Stanford will be no more than a
box to check off on the application,
even if Stanford has its own supple
mental application," Chow said. "As
a result, the University will be en
couraging a lot more students to
apply who are not truly passionate
about Stanford and Stanford-specif
ic qualities that differentiate Stan
ford from other schools."
