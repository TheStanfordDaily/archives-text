The Daily: I low's your campaign going so
far? I lave there been any particular chal
lenges or successes in running?
Kyle Ladewig: We haven't been so big on
flyeringand making these big banners be
cause what we have realized is that name
recognition is a huge part of a campaign.
We kind of run a different kind of cam-

paign, which is to talk face-to-face with
students and run this personal campaign,
which is how we will actually take on the
job as ASSU executives.
I I): You entered the race a little later
than the other candidates. Do you think


JOHN SHEN/The Stanford Daily
you've gotten enough publicity since
then to successfully get to the execu
tive office?
Aaron Smith: We were trying to fig
ure out what's the best way to apply
ourselves. We've been involved with
all these Stanford student groups at a
very microscopic level. We are just try
ing to communicate to people what
we are and what we're going to do.
KL: 1 think a lot of other candidates
who haven't been involved with stu
dent life are at a deficit with us.
They've been involved in this mad
rush to go out and contact people and
make those connections. We've been
making those connections for the
past three years.
I'D: What would you say are some of
the most important issues to your
campaign?
KL: One thing we're trying to set for
ward on our campaign and on our
Web site is we want to impact student
life on a day-to-day basis and we want
to create concrete initiatives that will
actually impact students. One of our
ideas is reforming the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OSA). 1 have a very
close relationship with the OSA. I

talk with Nanci Howe and Peggy
Chung on an almost daily basis. We've
actually had a talk with them about
how we can put these issues forward,
how we can change the OSA and how
we can make it more user friendly.
We'll be creating a student advisory
committee to perform quarterly re
views of the OSA to get student
input. We'll also be helping them
transition from a paper-based system
to an electronic system for events
submission.
TD: On one of the articles on our
Website in the student comment box.
one student wrote, "The only people
who run are serious resume-pushers
who spend thousands of dollars to get
elected." I've asked this question to
everyone â€” how would you respond
to that complaint?
AS: One of the things is we're trying
to show is that we're not politicans.
This is not a stepping stone for me.
The reason why we decided to run so
late is because we've been involved
with all of these student groups be
forehand. We've constantly held
leadership positions trying to get
more things done, and we looked at
the next step. What's the next step?
That's ASSU President and Vice
President.
