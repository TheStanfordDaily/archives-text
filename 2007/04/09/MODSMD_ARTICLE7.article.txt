The Daily: I low do you distinguish your
self from the other slates? I low do we tell
you apart?
Mondaire Jones: We have far more rele
vant experience, and I think our platform
is also much more well researched and
more practical.

Hershey Avula: We're not making broad,
general promises. We have specific plans
on how to get things done. And we've
shown that we can get results in the past
year. In the Undergraduate Senate, we
passed several resolutions on student ad-

vocacy interests.
TI): What kind of criticism have you
received and how have you dealt with
it?
MJ:The closest thing that would have
manifested itself that way would have
been a question about the draw and
its absence from our platform. Our re
sponse pretty much clarified that the
draw was already being reformed. We
didn't really need to address it.
HA: That's a big frustration for us.
Other slates are putting things on
their platfrom that's already getting
done. For us, that's malicious in its in
tent because it's promising something
that's already happening and promis
ing to take credit for it. 1 think that the
Brett and Lakshmi slate is promising
a three-tier draw, and that's some
thing that John Bravman has already
talked to us about and is already in the
plans for 2010.
TD: I've seen your table tents with
your flyer on one side and Lakshmi
and Brett's flyers on the other side. If
you look at them, yours has a lot of
points and theirs is much simpler. Do
you think that is a strength or a weak
ness?
M.I: I think that's a weakness on their
part. The criticism we received was
that we had too much text and some
one wasn't going to read it. What I did
was condense it and try to re-flyer dif

ferent placards in different dining
halls. Theirs clearly tends to be more
social in nature than anything else. It's
frustrating and also, I think it's pretty
sad. We're not running for class presi
dent, we're running for ASSU Execu
tive.
TI): Have you found any issues in this
campaign particularly important or
divisive or both?
HA: For us. diversity is a big thing in
terms of pushing faculty and graduate
diversity. And the entire student body
seems to be behind this. But some of
the things we've heard have been al
most kind of racist.
TI): Like what?
IIA: Like, "Why do you put diversity
on there?" I mean, there's clearly rea
sons why we put graduate student and
faculty diversity as high issues be
cause they promote education on
campus. In the end.Stanford's an aca
demic institution. And if we don't
have diverse faculty to provide di
verse viewpoints for students to learn
from, what does that say about us?
IM.I: And to provide role models for
those who might be interested in pur
suing certain fields but might think
that because of their demographic
that they're somehow ill-suited for
that, such as women in the sciences.
HA: These issues are very, very prob
lematic to us. and we find it really of
fensive. It's just one of those things, like
how can you say something like that
and feel okay about yourself after?
