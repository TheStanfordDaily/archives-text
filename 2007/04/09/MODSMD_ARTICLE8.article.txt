The Daily: I low is your campaign going?
I akshmi Karra: We think it's been going
well. We're having a lot of fun doing it.
We've been in White Plaza every day,
going around to dining halls, singing our
song. And so we've been enjoying it a lot.
I'D: I 've seen your flyers on the dining
halls on the table tents and there on the

hack of the Avula/Jones flyers, and if you
compare them, yours has a lot fewer bul
let points, and theirs is very extensive. Do
you think that this is a strength or a weak
ness?
Brett Mammon: I definitely think it's a

strength. Both slates are promising
similar things. And they're promising
a lot of things. It's impossible for two
people to accomplish half of the
things that they're promising. So. it's
going to come down to the cabinet
and the ASSU as a whole, and we
have a set of concrete goals that we
know we can and will accomplish
with this motivated cabinet. It's like
Lakshmi said, we've built an army of
people who are not usually involved
in ASSU stuff, but they're out there
and they care about it and those are
the kind of people we look forward
to working with next year to accom
plish those things that art on our
flyer.
TI): What concrete objectives are
your biggest priorities in the coming

year?
LK: We want to make the ASSU very
transparent for students, and 1 think
that by having a very large cabinent
of very motivated people, a large per
centage of Stanford students are
going to be like,"l know someone on
the cabinet." That automatically
gives you a sense of power or owner
ship, or at least identification with the
ASSU. So, that's one of our big goals.
Other things we want to see happen:
We want the Mausoleum Party and
we want the draw to be fixed.
BH: OS A reform.
LK: OSA reform, absolutely.
BH: Instead of saying that we're
going to change the rules and beat up
Nanci I lowe. we have our concrete
things we're going to do that are
going to help alleviate the situation. 1
know Nancy Howe. 1 know how she
works. The administration in general
is not just going to back down, and
Nancy Howe is not going to say.

Okay, Darren Frannich,you win.' If
we work with her and show her how
changing some of these arbitrary
rules make sense, then she's very rea
sonable. It will happen.
Tl): What do you think is the most
important issue in this race and also
perhaps the most divisive issue in this
race?
LK:The two platforms are very sim
ilar. So, 1 guess what you have to go
to then is, who are the people who
are running? The other slate has a
lot of Senate experience. Brett and 1
come from a very different back
ground, and I think that making sure
that people know the background
we come from is by no means less
qualified but, in fact, more qualified
as the voice of the student body I
think that's what it kind of boils
down to.
