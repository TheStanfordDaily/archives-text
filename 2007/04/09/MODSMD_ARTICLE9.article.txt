The Daily: Can you tell us a little bit
about your platform?
Anthony Scndary: The average Stan
ford student this week has been hearing
a lot of campaign promises from our op
ponents. We understand that the aver
age Stanford student has a lot of needs

personal resources."

and desires that they want fulfilled by
our opponents and by us. We want to tell

promises this week, and no matter how
many promises our opponents are mak-

mg, we promise that we'll make
more.
TD: Do you think that some of the
other campaign platforms are too
broad in their ambitions, or that they
don't do enough?
Annie Wyman: 1 think that they dodge
the question most frequently. Be
cause the question to me seems to
be one of cold, hard cash. Our slate
has always promised to engage the
students of Stanford University in a
mutual and profitable relationship,
one in which insane amounts of
money change hands, and 1 really
haven't heard any of the other slates
make that promise. We think that it's
key.
AS: Our opponents are what Annie
calls in her series of best-selling non
fiction books, "weak minds."
AW: Or maggot people.
TD: There's been a lot of criticism
recently of the ASSU and its dis
tance from students. What are your
feelings on that?
AW: 1 think that any student that has

a particular gripe, say'l don't like my
roommate,' i don't like it when the
OS A says we can't have a party,'
would be pretty satisfied if we were
to, say, issue them a personal bond in
the amount of $2,(X)0 or a golden bi
cycle, both of which we have ready at
hand.
AS: How big is your room?
TD: 1 have a two-room double to
myself.
AS: How many square feet would
you say that is?
TI): Really, ridiculously huge.
AS: Is it bigger than this room?
TI): No.
AS: What if 1 could get you your own
house on the Stanford campus with
more space than not just this room,
but this entire publication building?
TD: Could you promise to do that?
AW: We could absolutely promise.
AS: We'll promise it right now.
TD: How likely is it you'll come
through on all of these promises?
AW: We c m promise to make these
promises again and again until these
promises do or do not come true.
