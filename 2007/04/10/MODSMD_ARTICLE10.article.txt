Suitcases line the hallway of Bechtel Inter
national Center, and a savory aroma emanates
from a room filled with animated chatter.
Gathered around circular tables were seven
newly arrived Thai students and their Stanford
student hosts, discussing and planning the
newcomers' upcoming three-week immersion
into American culture.
Each year, the Stanford-Thai Exchange
Program (STEP) brings five to seven Thai stu
dents to Stanford to spend three April weeks
living and studying on campus. On Sunday
evening, this year's students began their jour
ney into a different world.
Program coordinators explained the proj
ect as a way to expose Thai students to broad
er influences.
"The overarching aim of the project is to
expose Thai college students to American cul
ture and to Stanford's intellectual milieu. - ' ex
plained Fah Sathirapongsasuti '09, co-director
of STEP.
Founded in 1997 through the Thai-Ameri
can Intercultural Society, STEP began as a
way to give outstanding Thai students the op
portunity to study abroad.
Academically, participants work on re
search projects with the mentorship of gradu
ate students. They also take program-specific
courses in areas such as culture, and are free to
attend general Stanford classes. At the end of
the three weeks, they give final oral presenta
tions on their topics of investigation.
"We choose research as a way to introduce
them to resources available at Stanford and
urge them to think critically about their sub

jects of study," said Sathirapongsasuti.
Participant Pat Wongpan of Mahidol Uni
versity in Thailand said that he was attracted
by the greater opportunities available at Stan
ford. where STEP students can talk to profes
sors about their projects. Wongpan will be re
searching solar physics and space weather to
examine issues behind global warming.
"I'd like to open my mind," said Wongpan.
"I think I'll have fun and make friends and
connections. The important thing is the expe
rience."
"Thai people would rather have a
coup to overthrow a 'bad' prime
minister and rewrite the constitu
tion, whereas Americans would not
consider that as an option."

Living with hosts in dormitories, exchange
students have access to university facilities
such as libraries, student centers, and the
sports complex. On weekends, they go on ex
cursions to tourist attractions in the Bay Area.
"Not only do they explore their academic
interests but they also get to experience the
culture at Stanford," said Ryan Estenzo '09. a
former host. "This equips them to be versatile
in the future, either in pursuing further studies

in the United States or coming up with ideas to
return their gratitude to their home country."
Former STEP student Kan Kanjanapas
won Thailand's Robocup Championship and
will represent Thailand in the international
Robocup 2007. held in July in Atlanta, Ga.
One of the program's aims, as described on
its web site, is to broaden participants' out
looks and "expose the students to Western
views on a wide range of issues, such as equal

ity. individualism, family values, and civic du
ties."
Sathirapongsasuti said that there are signif
icant differences between Eastern and West
ern values that the program aims to address
and explore.
