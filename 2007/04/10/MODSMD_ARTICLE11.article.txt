# On the Rhodes: with Sarah Schulman
## 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Boasting an impressive array of alumni in
cluding Bill Clinton, Nicholas Kristof and
David Souter, the Rhodes Scholarship is re
garded as a launching-pad for some of the most
accomplished college-aged intellectuals in the
nation. When, however. Harvard graduates
Marissa Dell and Swati Mylavarapu published
an op-ed in the Harvard Crimson relating their
own sub-par experiences as Rhodes Scholars,
they generated a firestorm of debate about
whether the world's oldest international schol
arship program merits the renown that it has
amassed.
Warning undergraduates to "think twice be
fore attending the Rhodes scholarship informa
tion session," in an opinions piece entitled "Ox
ford Blues." Dell and Mylavarapu described the
library facilities at Oxford as "less than inspir
ing," and their overall educational experiences

at Britain's oldest university as "frustrating."
Painting a particularly grim picture of the
prospect of research at Oxford, the editorial
warned future Rhodes Scholars with hopes of
conducting independent research. "You will
likely spend most of your time in touch with
1 larvard librarians to access materials not avail
able at Oxford, and you will probably be asking
your undergraduate advisor for research fund
ing and advice," the op-ed read.
And what of the famed tutorial system, in
which prominent faculty mentor up-and-com
ing young scholars? "If you have visions of de
bates with famous Nobel Prize winners," wrote
the two authors,"expect instead to be taught in
a lecture hall by an apathetic post-doc."
The complaints outlined in the editorial
reached far beyond the academic life at Oxford:
The authors argued that the social life at the
university was sub-par. in part because of the
fact that "everything— including coffee shops
and pharmacies" closes at 5 p.m. in the town of
Oxford.
The reaction to the editorial has been wide
spread. Over 200 comments were posted to the
Crimson's web site, many of which criticized the
authors for being overly negative and petty in
their complaints about Oxford. In a follow-up
features article, Elliot F. Gerson. the adminis
trator of the American Rhodes Trust, reflected
on what it means to be a Rhodes Scholar. "One

of the worries that we have and the price of the
fame of the scholarship," admitted Gerson in
the article, "is that is that a lot of successful
American students, instead of asking,' What is it
that 1 really want to do and why,' ask them
selves,' What is the next most competitive thing
1 can apply for?"'
To grain a perspective on the issue,The Daily
interviewed Sarah Schulman '05, a current
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford completing her doc
torate in Social Policy and Social Work. A

and social-science research at Stanford. Schul

TSl):The major concerns that the authors ex
press are that the research facilities at Oxford —
both in terms of library resources and faculty
mentors — are lacking compared to Harvard.
Do you do research at Oxford? How is your re
lationship with faculty mentors? How is the ad
vising, compared to Stanford?
SS: Like any graduate school, Oxford has
strong programs and weaker programs.
Prospective applicants should choose Oxford
not just because it is Oxford, but because it is a
good fit with the applicants' academic interests
and passions. My academic interest — children,
youth, and family policy — is outside of the
