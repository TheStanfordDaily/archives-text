# On the Rhodes: with Sarah Schulman
## 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Boasting an impressive array of alumni in
cluding Bill Clinton, Nicholas Kristof and
David Souter, the Rhodes Scholarship is re
garded as a launching-pad for some of the most
accomplished college-aged intellectuals in the
nation. When, however. Harvard graduates
Marissa Dell and Swati Mylavarapu published
an op-ed in the Harvard Crimson relating their
own sub-par experiences as Rhodes Scholars,
they generated a firestorm of debate about
whether the world's oldest international schol
arship program merits the renown that it has
amassed.
Warning undergraduates to "think twice be
fore attending the Rhodes scholarship informa
tion session," in an opinions piece entitled "Ox
ford Blues." Dell and Mylavarapu described the
library facilities at Oxford as "less than inspir
ing," and their overall educational experiences

at Britain's oldest university as "frustrating."
Painting a particularly grim picture of the
prospect of research at Oxford, the editorial
warned future Rhodes Scholars with hopes of
conducting independent research. "You will
likely spend most of your time in touch with
1 larvard librarians to access materials not avail
able at Oxford, and you will probably be asking
your undergraduate advisor for research fund
ing and advice," the op-ed read.
And what of the famed tutorial system, in
which prominent faculty mentor up-and-com
ing young scholars? "If you have visions of de
bates with famous Nobel Prize winners," wrote
the two authors,"expect instead to be taught in
a lecture hall by an apathetic post-doc."
The complaints outlined in the editorial
reached far beyond the academic life at Oxford:
The authors argued that the social life at the
university was sub-par. in part because of the
fact that "everything— including coffee shops
and pharmacies" closes at 5 p.m. in the town of
Oxford.
The reaction to the editorial has been wide
spread. Over 200 comments were posted to the
Crimson's web site, many of which criticized the
authors for being overly negative and petty in
their complaints about Oxford. In a follow-up
features article, Elliot F. Gerson. the adminis
trator of the American Rhodes Trust, reflected
on what it means to be a Rhodes Scholar. "One

of the worries that we have and the price of the
fame of the scholarship," admitted Gerson in
the article, "is that is that a lot of successful
American students, instead of asking,' What is it
that 1 really want to do and why,' ask them
selves,' What is the next most competitive thing
1 can apply for?"'
To grain a perspective on the issue,The Daily
interviewed Sarah Schulman '05, a current
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford completing her doc
torate in Social Policy and Social Work. A
Human Biology major who was active in clinical
and social-science research at Stanford. Schul
man says that Oxford
TSl):The major concerns that the authors ex
press are that the research facilities at Oxford —
both in terms of library resources and faculty
mentors — are lacking compared to Harvard.
Do you do research at Oxford? How is your re
lationship with faculty mentors? How is the ad
vising, compared to Stanford?
SS: Like any graduate school, Oxford has
strong programs and weaker programs.
Prospective applicants should choose Oxford
not just because it is Oxford, but because it is a
good fit with the applicants' academic interests
and passions. My academic interest — children,
youth, and family policy — is outside of the
scope of my department. While this
can lead to some frustration, one of
the virtues of the Oxford system is its
complete flexibility. As an Oxford
DPhil [Ph.D.] Student. 1(K) percent
of my time is devoted to research.
This means 1 can spend my day mak
ing connections with academics and
researchers external to my depart
ment and outside of Oxford. Once 1
adjusted to the fact that there would
he little institutional support for my
research — 1 realized how much 1
was learning by building bridges and
setting up the research for myself.
Stanford couldn't have prepared me
better — the incredible institutional
support I received for doing re
search as an undergraduate provid
ed me with a model for how to go
about laying the groundwork for
myself. Sure, 1 would love a more en
gaged faculty mentor at Oxford —
but, at the end of the day, I made a
decision to attend a graduate pro
gram that is not perfectly aligned
with the research I do.
TSI): Both of the authors of the
Crimson op-ed are doing their Ox
ford programs in Economic and So
cial History. Could their problems be
local to their departments?
SS: Universities are rarely superb
at all things. Engineers may choose
Stanford over NYU. while drama
students may choose NYU over
Stanford.The same is true at Oxford.
Oxford really specializes in core aca
demic disciplines like philosophy,
political theory, and literature.
TSI): Mow was Stanford's advis
ing program for the Rhodes?
SS: Stanford provided excellent
guidance before, during and after
the completion of the Rhodes
process. Because the process is so
unique, with so many layers to it. this
guidance tended to be more focused
on the scholarship itself, rather than

the Oxford experience. While it is
the applicants' job to ask whether
the Rhodes Scholarship and Oxford
University is the right path for them.
1 think advising programs can jump
start that critical thinking by helping
students apply the same criteria they
would use to gauge any other gradu
ate school opportunity.
TSI): The authors suggest taking
some time off before applying to the
Rhodes program — do you agree or
disagree?
SS: The best part of the Oxford
experience is getting to know and
converse with students from a truly
broad range of backgrounds and di
verse academic experiences. What
makes these interactions so satisfy
ing is that, for the most part. Oxford
students are really grounded: They
know themselves and they know
what they want. As long as prospec
tive Rhodes have that sclf-aware
ness — whether it was acquired be
fore or after taking some time off —
1 say. go forward with the Rhodes
process!
TSI): Is there anything about the
Rhodes program that surprised you?
Do you have any advice of your own
for students considering applying for
the Rhodes program?
SS: For me, Oxford's value
comes from the intangibles. The
late-night conversations you have
with friends at the pub. riding on the
back of your professor's bicycle to
dinner at college, drinking 100-year
old port and having picnics in the
meadow once the seemingly never
ending rain becomes never-ending
sun. It took me awhile to appreciate
this aspect of the Oxford experi
ence. I learned how important it is
to adjust and realign your expecta
tions at the start of a new opportu
nity and not continually compare
where you are now with where you
have been. Oxford is different than
Stanford, so a whole new set of stan
dards needs to apply.

gram that is not perfectly aligned
with the research I do.
TSI): Both of the authors of the
Crimson op-ed are doing their Ox
ford programs in Economic and So
cial History. Could their problems be
local to their departments?
SS: Universities are rarely superb
at all things. Engineers may choose
Stanford over NYU. while drama
students may choose NYU over
Stanford.The same is true at Oxford.
Oxford really specializes in core aca
demic disciplines like philosophy,
political theory, and literature.
TSI): Mow was Stanford's advis
ing program for the Rhodes?
SS: Stanford provided excellent
guidance before, during and after
the completion of the Rhodes
process. Because the process is so
unique, with so many layers to it. this
guidance tended to be more focused
on the scholarship itself, rather than

the Oxford experience. While it is
the applicants' job to ask whether
the Rhodes Scholarship and Oxford
University is the right path for them.
1 think advising programs can jump
start that critical thinking by helping
students apply the same criteria they
would use to gauge any other gradu
ate school opportunity.
TSI): The authors suggest taking
some time off before applying to the
Rhodes program — do you agree or
disagree?
SS: The best part of the Oxford
experience is getting to know and
converse with students from a truly
broad range of backgrounds and di
verse academic experiences. What
makes these interactions so satisfy
ing is that, for the most part. Oxford
students are really grounded: They
know themselves and they know
what they want. As long as prospec
tive Rhodes have that sclf-aware
ness — whether it was acquired be
fore or after taking some time off —
1 say. go forward with the Rhodes
process!
TSI): Is there anything about the
Rhodes program that surprised you?
Do you have any advice of your own
for students considering applying for
the Rhodes program?
SS: For me, Oxford's value
comes from the intangibles. The
late-night conversations you have
with friends at the pub. riding on the
back of your professor's bicycle to
dinner at college, drinking 100-year
old port and having picnics in the
meadow once the seemingly never
ending rain becomes never-ending
sun. It took me awhile to appreciate
this aspect of the Oxford experi
ence. I learned how important it is
to adjust and realign your expecta
tions at the start of a new opportu
nity and not continually compare
where you are now with where you
have been. Oxford is different than
Stanford, so a whole new set of stan
dards needs to apply.

Boasting an impressive array of alumni in
cluding Bill Clinton, Nicholas Kristof and
David Souter, the Rhodes Scholarship is re
garded as a launching-pad for some of the most
accomplished college-aged intellectuals in the
nation. When, however. Harvard graduates
Marissa Dell and Swati Mylavarapu published
an op-ed in the Harvard Crimson relating their
own sub-par experiences as Rhodes Scholars,
they generated a firestorm of debate about
whether the world's oldest international schol
arship program merits the renown that it has
amassed.
Warning undergraduates to "think twice be
fore attending the Rhodes scholarship informa
tion session," in an opinions piece entitled "Ox
ford Blues." Dell and Mylavarapu described the
library facilities at Oxford as "less than inspir
ing," and their overall educational experiences

at Britain's oldest university as "frustrating."
Painting a particularly grim picture of the
prospect of research at Oxford, the editorial
warned future Rhodes Scholars with hopes of
conducting independent research. "You will
likely spend most of your time in touch with
1 larvard librarians to access materials not avail
able at Oxford, and you will probably be asking
your undergraduate advisor for research fund
ing and advice," the op-ed read.
And what of the famed tutorial system, in
which prominent faculty mentor up-and-com
ing young scholars? "If you have visions of de
bates with famous Nobel Prize winners," wrote
the two authors,"expect instead to be taught in
a lecture hall by an apathetic post-doc."
The complaints outlined in the editorial
reached far beyond the academic life at Oxford:
The authors argued that the social life at the
university was sub-par. in part because of the
fact that "everything— including coffee shops
and pharmacies" closes at 5 p.m. in the town of
Oxford.
The reaction to the editorial has been wide
spread. Over 200 comments were posted to the
Crimson's web site, many of which criticized the
authors for being overly negative and petty in
their complaints about Oxford. In a follow-up
features article, Elliot F. Gerson. the adminis
trator of the American Rhodes Trust, reflected
on what it means to be a Rhodes Scholar. "One

of the worries that we have and the price of the
fame of the scholarship," admitted Gerson in
the article, "is that is that a lot of successful
American students, instead of asking,' What is it
that 1 really want to do and why,' ask them
selves,' What is the next most competitive thing
1 can apply for?"'
To grain a perspective on the issue,The Daily
interviewed Sarah Schulman '05, a current
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford completing her doc
torate in Social Policy and Social Work. A
Human Biology major who was active in clinical
and social-science research at Stanford. Schul

TSl):The major concerns that the authors ex
press are that the research facilities at Oxford —
both in terms of library resources and faculty
mentors — are lacking compared to Harvard.
Do you do research at Oxford? How is your re
lationship with faculty mentors? How is the ad
vising, compared to Stanford?
SS: Like any graduate school, Oxford has
strong programs and weaker programs.
Prospective applicants should choose Oxford
not just because it is Oxford, but because it is a
good fit with the applicants' academic interests
and passions. My academic interest — children,
youth, and family policy — is outside of the
scope of my department. While this
can lead to some frustration, one of
the virtues of the Oxford system is its
complete flexibility. As an Oxford
DPhil [Ph.D.] Student. 1(K) percent
of my time is devoted to research.
This means 1 can spend my day mak
ing connections with academics and
researchers external to my depart
ment and outside of Oxford. Once 1
adjusted to the fact that there would
he little institutional support for my
research — 1 realized how much 1
was learning by building bridges and
setting up the research for myself.
Stanford couldn't have prepared me
better — the incredible institutional
support I received for doing re
search as an undergraduate provid
ed me with a model for how to go
about laying the groundwork for
myself. Sure, 1 would love a more en
gaged faculty mentor at Oxford —
but, at the end of the day, I made a
decision to attend a graduate pro
gram that is not perfectly aligned
with the research I do.
