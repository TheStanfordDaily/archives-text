## Refugee tells his story Subject of Eggers' book shares life experiences 
### CARLEE BROWN 
Valentino Achak Deng spoke
about his experiences as a Sudanese
refugee in Ethiopia and Kenya last
night in an event co-sponsored by
Stanford In Government (SIG), Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur
(STAND) and McSweeney's Pub
lishing, which published Dave Eg
gers' fictionalized 2006 memoir
"What is the What," which details
Deng's life.
Deng also spoke to the packed au-

dience in Building
200 about the im
portance of work
ing to stop the
genocide in Darfur.
'"What is the
What' is my life,
but it is my life as a
microcosm of what
people are living in
Sudan." Deng said.

Before Deng even stepped to the
lectern, many audience members al
ready knew his story. Deng was sepa
rated from his family in southern
Sudan and spent 13 years in foreign
refugee camps. Eventually, he came
to the United States and settled in
Atlanta, where he took three jobs
and attended college. When he real
ized that few Americans were aware
of the Darfur genocide, Deng began
lecturing to high school and college
groups about his home country.
"I need to tell people about
southern Sudan, because if I don't
tell people about this it could happen
anywhere," he said.
Deng's stop at Stanford was part of a
nationwide tour that benefits the
Valentino Achak Deng Foundation,

which is funded by the proceeds from
Eggers' book. The foundation —
which aims to aid Sudanese people in
the U.S. and Sudan —is allowing
Deng to travel this summer to his
hometown to start work on a com
munity complex which will feature a
library, a women's center, a youth ac
tivity center and a sports facility.
"It's a long-term project," said
Greg Larson, a representative from
McSweeney's Publishing who works
with Deng." We're going to build var
ious buildings, but the most impor
tant thing in African development is
sustainability."
Event coordinator Nikki Serapio
'07, a member of STAND, said that
"What is the What" has catalyzed
American students to think about
the genocide in Darfur.
"Countless high school and col
lege students have come up to me
and said they want to be involved be
cause they were moved by the book."
Serapio said. "There are so many ar
ticles you can read, but when people
bring compelling stories to the audi
ence. it underscores the urgency"
According to Serapio. Deng's ap
pearance is part of a larger STAND
initiative this month to revitalize
Darfur efforts on campus. On Apr.
2 l ). the group will help host a large
Darfur rally in San Francisco's Civic
Center. Students and the public at
large can learn more and register for
the event at http://www.darfursf.org.
Deng said he is supportive of
STAND'S efforts.
"1 want more young people to
come out and support STAND." he
said.
