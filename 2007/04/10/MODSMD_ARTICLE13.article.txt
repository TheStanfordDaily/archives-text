## Editorial Board Brett and Lakshmi for ASSU executives 
### 
Brett Mammon and Lakshmi Karra are
the executive candidates best equipped
ti> face the issues that will confront the
student body during the 2007-2008 school year.
1 ach ot the five slates sat down with The
DaiK Sunday for 30 minutes, during which
each pair of candidates gave a presentation
followed by a question-and-answer session.
While the decision was a difficult one that
came after hours of deliberation, Hammon
and Karra stood out for their experience in
class leadership positions and dedication to an
important yet achievable set of goals.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the two frontrun
ner slates share many of the same objectives.
Brett and I .akshmi and Avula/Jones propose
to reform the Office of Student Activities
(C)SA). increase campus diversity and pro
mote social programming with events such as
an all-Stanford pool party. In the absence of
some differentiating factor in the platforms
themselves, some observers and candidates
have portrayed the race as pitting the advoca
cy-oriented ASSU experience of Avula and
Jones against the programming-directed class
leadership of I lammon and Karra.
While it is not readily obvious that one type
of background is preferable to the other, we
feel that I lammon and Karra stand to gain
from their exposure to and experience work
ing with all types of students as class presi
dents and executive cabinet members. Where
as many have little direct contact with the
ASSU — indeed,some neither know nor care
what the ASSU does — class presidents are
often more engaged with students on a daily
basis. 1 lammon and Karra bring a fresh per
spective as outsiders in combination with an
insider's informed understanding of issues
that matter.
Many of I lammon and Karra's proposals
reflect their strong sense of the pulse of the
student body. As leaders in the Class of 2008,
Hammon and Karra have direct experience
working with OSA and its director Nanci
1 lowe. They correctly point out that students
are best served by foregoing the inflammato

ry anti-OSA rhetoric in favor of collabora
tion and cooperation within existing param
eters. They say that Stanford's peer institu
tions have less onerous party-planning re
strictions and plan to use these comparisons
to leverage policy changes with what they say
is an understaffed OSA.
Even if relatively modest in number, the
ideas advanced by I lammon and Karra are
straightforward and likely to be effective,
lliey call for more openness in the Nomina
tions Commission, which would require the
Senate to publish the names of students on
committees.
I lammon and Karra seek to integrate class
presidents and cabinets, who represent un
tapped resources, into the ASSU organiza
tional structure. Rather than advocating non
binding resolutions of questionable efficacy.
I lammon and Karra propose to address cam
pus diversity issues in part by holding open
houses for ethnic-theme dorms. These ideas
represent practical yet valuable proposals
with real prospects for implementation.
Our support for Brett and Lakshmi is by
no means unqualified. Iheir proposal to re
form the draw by creating two tiers of pre
ferred status is confusing and could create un
intended negative consequences. The opposi
tion slates, notably Avula/Jones. offer com
pelling ideas that merit consideration by
whichever slate emerges victorious.
We were impressed by the freshness and
energy of Aaron Smith and Kyle Ladewig.two
fraternity brothers who believe the ASSU fo
cuses too much on global issues and overlooks
important local concerns. We sympathized
with some of the frustration and resentment
expressed by Truebe and Olowoyeye's Warm
Weather Party, which holds that student gov
ernment has consistently failed to look out for
the interests of its constituents.
Yet the direct experience of working with
students brought by Brett and Lakshmi. cou
pled with a series of meaningful and realizable
goals, gives them the edge in what looks to be
a tight election.
