# Blowin' in the wind
## 
### 
Bob Dylan introduced me to Revolution (with a capi
tal R) in the 6th grade. At the time, I knew about other
revolutions — primarily those of the French, Russian
and American varieties — but no one had told me about
Revolution. ITie introduction happened when I stole a best
ot-Dylan compilation disc from my mother and inserted it
into my portable CD player. Although songs such as "Sub
terranean I lomesick Blues" were nigh incomprehensible to
me. it was impossible to miss the fact that Dylan was angry
about something: even now, I'm hard-pressed to think of a
song more passive-aggressive than "Blowin' in the Wind."
I idolized Dylan, partly because 1 believed him to be
dead, and partly because he promised the times were a
changin". which for an unstylish, acne-laden, puppy-fat
cursed 11-year-old was good news. My blind adoration of
Dylan quickly spread to other singer/songwriters of his era.
such as Join Mitchell, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin,etc. In the face
of the pre-teen world's Britney Spears obsession, my musi
cal tastes looked odd, even to my mother, who started ques
tioning me about 'my music.'
As my mother explained 'my music' to me, stories of her
youth began to emerge from the marijuana-clouded haze of
her past. I had gathered that Dylan was singing about what
1 called in my mind the Revolution, and the stories coming
from the improbable mouth of my bespectacled, polo shirt
clad mother, made the nature of the Revolution clearer.The
Revolution hated racism, sexism and the war in Vietnam.
Hie Revolution had sprung from bra-burning, long-haired
nymphs such as my mother who had been arrested and been
high, but most importantly had been right.
As I listened to that best-of-Dvlan album repeatedly, I
decided secretly that I would be a revolutionary when I grew
up. I wanted a share of the energy and spontaneity, but most
importantly the Tightness, that the 60's and 7()'s radiated,
even from their decades-long distance. But as I've grown, it
has become painfully clear that there is no more Revolu
tion. No longer do 20-somethings sit en masse on the lawn
with their guitars and their radical notions of peace, freedom
and equality. But for God's sake, why not? ITiat's what I
want to do!
()ur generation doesn't wage revolutions on grassy lawns
or at spontaneous demonstrations or in City I.ights. Dylan's
famed San Francisco hangout. Instead, our mini-revolutions
are carefully coordinated, confirmed via email, made into
Facebook events, neatly filed intoASSLJ folders and funded
by the OSA (if your smiling Financial Officer smiles
enough). It sometimes seems, too, like our revolutions are
fighting against each other. Will my money be donated to
AIDS or breast cancer research? Which foreign locale will I
pour my ideals into? Which will be my revolution?
I think we've become fragmented because our world has
gotten so complicated.Thanks to mass media, global travel,
pandemics and other border-crossing developments, we've
become a global community with so many problems.oppos
ing camps and contrary sources that it's hard to even form
an opinion, let alone enact it. I'd like to think that the reason
we've failed to launch a united Revolution is because the
problems facing the world today are so vastly different from
those that sparked the Revolution.
It seems that the issues against which the Revolution
fought were ones centered in mindset. Ihe Revolution tried
to change people's opinions about segregation and sexism,
which lead to legislation, which lead to ... us. Our situation.
()ur mini revolutions aren't so much about chaneinu minds

as they are about enacting the ideals that we already sup
port. We don't disagree about whether the people in Darfur
should or should not be victims of genocide, but we as a na
tion are seemingly bewildered when it comes to taking ac
tion. litis goes for most of our other mini-revolutions as
well.
Dylan's shining Revolution no longer exists, although 1
see people, young and old alike, hungering for a return of the
Revolutionary glory days. During my freshman year, one of
my section leaders in Sl.l (suspend your jokes just this
once, please) frequently dismissed us from section with the
half-mocking, half-earnest entreaty, "Alright. Now go
rebel." I wished I could. I wished 1 could go fight the good
fight, like my mother and Bob Dylan taught me. But perhaps
1 should have realized that revolution isn't something
learned, but something conjured in desperate times. If I
learned revolution from my mother, then perhaps it isn't
revolution at all.
Today's revolution is a whole different kind of fight, one
for which even Dylan couldn't prepare me. When 1 look at
global warming, my chosen mini-revolution. I realize sadly
that idealized arguments won't get me very far.The answer
isn't blowin' in the wind; the only things blowin' in the wind
are pollutants, and none of Dylan's songs offer advice about
carbon sequestration.The point is that I — we — all have to
wage our mini-revolutions with Dylan's zeal, but with the
understanding that they won't be half as romantic as
Dylan's songs. C)ur mini-revolutions largely lack an opposi
tion — unless you count apathy, which is hardly fun to argue
against.
As for the disturbing fragmentation and sterilization of
our little on-campus revolutions, I'm sure Darren Franich
could make more of it than I can. All I can say is that it's
scary and that students are complicit in it. While I've said
that the days of righteous opposition are largely over for us
collegiate revolutionaries. I still don't advocate our becom
ing flaccid resume-building groups. Both students and ad
ministrators will need to create the space for cause-oriented
student groups to actually be able to effect change, rather
than pouring all their time into paperwork.
But I digress. What I mean to say is that the situation of
the revolution is shitty, but there is a common ground on
which all our diverse revolutions stand, and it is this: Our rev
olutions appeal to a global conscience that is not even close
to being fully-formed. If we believe in our revolutions.it will
be our job to build that conscience. Although we tiny revolu
tionaries might feel like complete unknowns, or even rolling
stones with no direction home, there's something to be said
for our brand of revolution. It's new. it's what our parents'
Revolution brought us to, and most importantly, it's ours.
