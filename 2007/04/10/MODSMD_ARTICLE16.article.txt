# Undead presidents

### 
Nobody likes the senior class presidents. The
votes were barely counted last year when the
vitriol started flying through the senior class
stratosphere. Pub Night isn't happening, and it's their
fault. Our commencement speaker isn't Bill Clinton,
and it's their fault. My tummy hurts, and it's their fault.
They did not seek popular acclaim. They took shit
from all sides in desperate hope of maintaining an al
ready-turbulent status quo. I begged them to give me
dirt to fling in the administration's fat face. Like most
seniors, I have stopped hoping that the people who
run our school have any understanding of or interest
in the undergraduates.
An administration so painfully out of touch with its
constituents deserves a metaphorical Molotov cock
tail thrown straight up its unmetaphorical ass. The
senior presidents tried something different: diploma
cy. They worked through a labyrinthine web of inef
fective bureaucracy that would make Orwell weep
and God quit. "It's sincerely not an us versus them
deal," one president's email assured this newspaper in
the dark days of early fall. "Making it seem even re
motely like that would do infinitely more damage to
Pub Night in the future." Of course, the presidents
also proclaimed that we'd be the first class to advise
on a Commencement speaker.
It isn't fair to say that our presidents failed us, be
cause they got us Pub Night, even if they have to call
it Senior Night (which is a lame name devised by lame
people obsessed with laming out the world).The only
reason we've been getting bused around on Thurs
days is because the presidents have a good relation
ship with Nanci Howe. Working with Ms. Howe is
somewhat like talking to a brick wall that occasional
ly kicks you in the crotch and steals your lunch money,
so everyone from the class of *07 (and a few wily
youngsters from '08,'09,'10 and Gunn High School)
should send the presidents a thank you email.
But they have not solved the Pub Night problem. At
best, the ID card holograms and anti-vomit contracts
are stopgaps: Their emails invariably contain some red
typed warning, "even just a couple of people vomiting
on a bus or spilling alcohol can incur a fine large enough
to force us to cancel a future Senior Night... a few peo
ple can truly ruin Senior Nights for everyone else."
Whether or not that's true is up for debate, but the pres
idents have taken steps to protect Pub Night that have
preserved the event's body at the expense of its soul.
One Pub Night in January, I stayed at the bar until
the end of the evening. When the last bus arrived, one
girl in line did not have an ID hologram. She had a
Stanford ID; she was clearly, but not overly, inebriat
ed; it was 2 a.m. on a chill winter night. One of the sen
ior presidents refused to let her on board. The presi
dent explained wanly, "I'm only following orders."
Golly, just like at Nuremburg! I wish that I had been
drunk enough to not be painfully aware that even rais
ing my voice would probably get me blackballed from
the Marguerite, because then I would have said.
"Look at you. you company man. you minor pawn,
you would leave one of our own out in the cold just be
cause she didn't sign a silly piece of paper? When did
it become so easy to make Soviet references? When
did it become easier to fight your fellow students than

to fight the administration?"
At times like that, I fear our presidents show their
true colors: covering their ass, fearful for liability, los
ing sight of the trees for the security of the whole for
est. It must be said that they aren't bad people, just
politicians, which means they think they have to play
the game. ITie class of 2007 needed someone unafraid
to play the game their own way, or to throw the board
out the window, leap up on President Hennessy's desk
and explain, "We represent the future of your univer
sity. so be a doll and kindly do not fuck with us." The
seniors needed someone to represent our anger, not
assuage it. Someone to make the administration un
derstand just how much they have taken from us.Too
often, they were trying to convince us that settling for
less was the best thing we could do.The tragedy of the
senior class presidents is really the tragedy of Stan
lord under President Hennessy: students trying to
work with an administration that has only marginal
interest in working with us.
Everything that we've been through as a class —
the wave of prohibitions, the bans, the crawling shad
ow of Absolute F'un sowing pestilence upon this once
great land — has led us to this moment. I see admits
walking around a campus that will soon belong to
them, not me. We have a duty: to all the people who
will take your rooms and work on your desk and mess
around in your bed: to the kids walking by you in tour
groups; to the kids in high school staying up nights
doing homework; to the kids in fifth grade staring to
wards the future with nothing but the ghost of a
dream; to those yet unborn.
I write* this as an impassioned plea to the senior
class presidents who I voted for and in whom I still be
lieve. It is not too late to be extraordinary. The sun
does not set on our class for another two long and lazy
spring months. If you need us. we will be there. If you
want us to air the long list of grievances our class has
suffered, we will be there. If you want us to blanket the
administration with such a mighty flood of emails that
SUNet implodes upon itself, we'will be there. If you
want us to put a keg in a shopping cart and march
around the OSA office like Joshua at the walls of Jeri
cho, Do You Hear the People Sing" playing off a
portable stereo, we will be there. But for God's sake,
do something. You are not middlemen. You are presi
dents. Don t be Franklin Pierces and James
Buchanans. Be brave. Be Teddy fucking Roosevelt.

A Stanford administrator recently told Darren
hranich, Whether this is a soul crushing bureaucracy
or not, you still shouldn t treat people the way you do. "
