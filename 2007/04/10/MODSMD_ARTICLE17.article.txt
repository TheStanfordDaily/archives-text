## Water polo pushes win streak to 17 Strong play in first half yields a pair of victories 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Last week was a rather topsy-turvy week in
the world of collegiate women's water polo, as a
pair of the nation's top five teams suffered stun
ning upsets that prompted a flurry of adjust
ments to the national rankings. When the top-20
poll came out Wednesday, the formerly No. 7
UC-Irvine squad found itself ranked fourth
overall, cracking the top five with its highest
ranking ever in school history.
But the top-ranked Stanford women's team
gave the Anteaters a rude welcome to the exclu
sive upper echelon of the rankings,scoring eight
unanswered first-half goals en route to a re
sounding 10-3 victory last Friday. A day later, the
Cardinal went on to knock off Long Beach
State. 13-6, on the strength of hat tricks from
sophomore Lolo Silver and freshman Kelsey
Holshouser. With the pair of conference victo
ries, the Stanford women maintained a firm grip
on their No. 1 ranking, while pushing their cur
rent winning streak to 17 games.
The members of the Cardinal squad (19-1,
8-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) have
made themselves right at home in the
Anteaters Aquatie Complex this season. In
late February, they headed to Irvine and went a
perfect 4-0 to take first place in the annual
Anteater Invitational tournament. Then, last
Friday, they effectively compromised the
Anteaters' home-pool advantage by lighting
up the back of the cage four times in each of the
first two periods to put the game out of reach

by halftime.
Irvine might have held out early hope for an
upset,getting a goal from sophomore two-meter
Gianni Rossi one minute into the first period to
open the game's scoring. But Silver evened it up
by converting a Stanford six-on-five opportuni
ty shortly thereafter, and a minute later, senior
captain Katie Hansen put the Cardinal ahead to
stay with her only goal of the game. Silver and
junior Jackie Gauthier pushed the score to 4-1 in
favor of the Cardinal before the period was
through.

The Stanford defense shut down the Irvine
attack in the second period, and it was 9-1 before
the Anteaters were able to find the back of the
cage again midway through the third period.
Both teams added one more goal before the
final buzzer sounded to bring the final tally to
10-3. Silver led the field with four goals on the
day. all of them coming in the first half. With the
performance. Silver also passed the 100-goal
mark in just the second season of her career.
Gauthier, who finished with two goals, was the
only other member of the Cardinal squad to
