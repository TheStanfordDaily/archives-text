## Tiebreakers key victory over Oregon on road 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two matches determined by
tiebreakers in the third set helped de
cide the outcome of Friday's contest
when the Stanford men's tennis team
faced Oregon. The Cardinal ultimate
ly clinched a 5-2 victory over the
Ducks by earning three-set victories
at the fourth and sixth singles spots. In
a match much closer than the score in
dicates. had Stanford not nabbed the
final two matches, Oregon would have
narrowly edged out the Card.
"It was a very hard-fought 5-2
win," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "I mean, you look at 5-2, and you
think it wasn't that close, but we liter
ally were in tiebreakers to win the
match. I have to give Dave Ryan and
Kevin [Kaiser] props; they hung
around and found a way to win."
No. 60 Stanford (7-12, 2-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) started off the day by
winning the doubles point for the
third match in a row. Senior Eric

McKean teamed with freshman Kevin
Kaiser to pick up the first victory at
the final doubles spot, with sopho
mores Matt Bruch and Blake Muller
following suit with an 8-5 victory.
When singles play began. Oregon
(9-10.0-3 Pac-10) evened the score to
one-apiece when Muller deferred to
his opponent in straight sets. Stanford
then gained a 3-1 lead by earning vic
tories at the top half of the lineup.
McKean overwhelmed his opponent,
6-3,6-2 in the third spot, and freshman
Richard Wire defeated Marcos Ver
dasco at the top spot. 6-4,6-1.
Despite this lead, the remainder of
the match proved nerve-racking, as
the entire second half of the lineup
split sets with its opponents. Sopho
more Jeff Zeller was next to complete
his match, ultimately falling in a tight
6-1,4-6,6-4 loss.
The Cardinal only needed one
more victory to seal the match, and
both Kaiser and senior David Ryan
went to tiebreakers in the third and
final sets of their matches. Winning 6-
2, 2-6, 7-6, Ryan clinched the win for
Stanford for the second time in a row.
"[Dave's] a great team player who
does whatever it takes for the team to
do well," Whitlinger said. "He hasn't
really had a lot of chances, but when

Kaiser gave the Card its final point
with his 5-7,6-2,7-6 win.
On Saturday. Stanford was able to
translate some of this momentum to
doubles when the team faced No. 33
