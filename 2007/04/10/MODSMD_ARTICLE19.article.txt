Two matches determined by
tiebreakers in the third set helped de
cide the outcome of Friday's contest
when the Stanford men's tennis team
faced Oregon. The Cardinal ultimate
ly clinched a 5-2 victory over the
Ducks by earning three-set victories
at the fourth and sixth singles spots. In
a match much closer than the score in
dicates. had Stanford not nabbed the
final two matches, Oregon would have
narrowly edged out the Card.
"It was a very hard-fought 5-2
win," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "I mean, you look at 5-2, and you
think it wasn't that close, but we liter
ally were in tiebreakers to win the
match. I have to give Dave Ryan and
Kevin [Kaiser] props; they hung
around and found a way to win."
No. 60 Stanford (7-12, 2-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) started off the day by
winning the doubles point for the
third match in a row. Senior Eric

McKean teamed with freshman Kevin
Kaiser to pick up the first victory at
the final doubles spot, with sopho
mores Matt Bruch and Blake Muller
following suit with an 8-5 victory.
When singles play began. Oregon
(9-10.0-3 Pac-10) evened the score to
one-apiece when Muller deferred to
his opponent in straight sets. Stanford
then gained a 3-1 lead by earning vic
tories at the top half of the lineup.
McKean overwhelmed his opponent,
6-3,6-2 in the third spot, and freshman
Richard Wire defeated Marcos Ver
dasco at the top spot. 6-4,6-1.
Despite this lead, the remainder of
the match proved nerve-racking, as
the entire second half of the lineup
split sets with its opponents. Sopho
more Jeff Zeller was next to complete
his match, ultimately falling in a tight
6-1,4-6,6-4 loss.
The Cardinal only needed one
more victory to seal the match, and
both Kaiser and senior David Ryan
went to tiebreakers in the third and
final sets of their matches. Winning 6-
2, 2-6, 7-6, Ryan clinched the win for
Stanford for the second time in a row.
"[Dave's] a great team player who
does whatever it takes for the team to
do well," Whitlinger said. "He hasn't
really had a lot of chances, but when

we put him in, he stepped up big time

coach, that's all 1 can ask of someone."
Kaiser gave the Card its final point
with his 5-7,6-2,7-6 win.
On Saturday. Stanford was able to
translate some of this momentum to
doubles when the team faced No. 33
Washington, but they could not carry
the energy to singles, falling to the
Huskies 6-1.
Wire and freshman Paul Morrissey
opened play on Saturday with an 8-6
victory over Washington (13-6, 1-3
Pac-10). The Huskies evened the
doubles board when they picked up
the third doubles spot. No. 27 Bruch
and Muller sealed the first point of
the day when they defeated a veteran
team of Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic.
"At 1 and 2 [doubles], we proba
bly played as well as we've played
all year, and 3 wasn't far behind,"
Whitlinger said. "But Washington's
very difficult to beat up [in Seattle].
We ended up playing the match in
doors because of a little rain, and
they're even tougher inside."
"We had a great feeling after
winning that doubles point." the
head coach continued. "But we all
knew it was just one point, and it

wasn't going to be an easy match by
any stretch of the imagination."
Although Washington trailed
Stanford and had just lost to No. 51
California the day before, the
Huskies were not going to give up
and quickly made up in singles what
they lacked in doubles. Despite the
return of Bruch to the Card's singles
lineup. Washington swept all six
matches.
"They lost to Cal the day before
and were down a doubles point."
Whitlinger said. "But they really
stepped up to the challenge, and I've
got to give them a lot of credit for
that."
Much like Friday's matchup with
the Ducks, Saturday's contest was
also much closer than the final 6-1
score implied. Bruch and Wire,
Stanford's top two players, fell in
three sets, both playing tiebreakers
in lieu of the third set. Also, at the
third singles position, Muller

dropped the first set. 6-3, before
narrowly dropping the second in a
tiebreaker to Washington's Andy
Kuharsky.
The team begins the Stanford
Challenge, a run of five home
matches, starting with tomorrow's
match against the defending NCAA
champion. No. 17 Pepperdine.
"We have five more home
matches against very good teams.
Pepperdine being the first one,"
Whitlinger said. "They won [the
NCAA Championship] at Stanford,
so they feel pretty confident coming
into this place. But as 1 told our
guys, we throw our records out the
window.This is the start of the Stan

we put him in, he stepped up big time
against Santa Clara and Oregon. As a
coach, that's all 1 can ask of someone."
Kaiser gave the Card its final point
with his 5-7,6-2,7-6 win.
On Saturday. Stanford was able to
translate some of this momentum to
doubles when the team faced No. 33
Washington, but they could not carry
the energy to singles, falling to the
Huskies 6-1.
Wire and freshman Paul Morrissey
opened play on Saturday with an 8-6
victory over Washington (13-6, 1-3
Pac-10). The Huskies evened the
doubles board when they picked up
the third doubles spot. No. 27 Bruch
and Muller sealed the first point of
the day when they defeated a veteran
team of Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic.
"At 1 and 2 [doubles], we proba
bly played as well as we've played
all year, and 3 wasn't far behind,"
Whitlinger said. "But Washington's
very difficult to beat up [in Seattle].
We ended up playing the match in
doors because of a little rain, and
they're even tougher inside."
"We had a great feeling after
winning that doubles point." the
head coach continued. "But we all
knew it was just one point, and it

wasn't going to be an easy match by
any stretch of the imagination."
Although Washington trailed
Stanford and had just lost to No. 51
California the day before, the
Huskies were not going to give up
and quickly made up in singles what
they lacked in doubles. Despite the
return of Bruch to the Card's singles
lineup. Washington swept all six
matches.
"They lost to Cal the day before
and were down a doubles point."
Whitlinger said. "But they really
stepped up to the challenge, and I've
got to give them a lot of credit for
that."
Much like Friday's matchup with
the Ducks, Saturday's contest was
also much closer than the final 6-1
score implied. Bruch and Wire,
Stanford's top two players, fell in
three sets, both playing tiebreakers
in lieu of the third set. Also, at the
third singles position, Muller

dropped the first set. 6-3, before
narrowly dropping the second in a
tiebreaker to Washington's Andy
Kuharsky.
The team begins the Stanford
Challenge, a run of five home
matches, starting with tomorrow's
match against the defending NCAA
champion. No. 17 Pepperdine.
"We have five more home
matches against very good teams.
Pepperdine being the first one,"
Whitlinger said. "They won [the
NCAA Championship] at Stanford,
so they feel pretty confident coming
into this place. But as 1 told our
guys, we throw our records out the
window.This is the start of the Stan
ford Challenge. We've got some
tough matches coming up. but we'll
take them one at a time. We're look
ing forward to this challenge."
