## Graduate elections are overshadowed GSC struggles to fill vacancies as volunteers work to up turnout 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
News flash: This week's elections are for grad
uate students, too.
But while it is hard to miss the thousands of
flyers undergraduate candidates have posted on
every available inch of campus, the run-up to
elections for the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has been noticeably less visible.
While a quick trip to the bathroom is all it
takes to find out how plentiful candidates for the
Undergraduate Senate are, GSC candidates are
much fewer and farther between. In fact, a short
fall of graduate candidates threatened to leave
the 15-person GSC without enough members
for next year, until a last-minute push encour
aged more students to run.
