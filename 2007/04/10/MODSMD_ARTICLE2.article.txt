# STUDENT GOV'T
## Graduate elections are overshadowed GSC struggles to fill vacancies as volunteers work to up turnout 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
News flash: This week's elections are for grad
uate students, too.
But while it is hard to miss the thousands of
flyers undergraduate candidates have posted on
every available inch of campus, the run-up to
elections for the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has been noticeably less visible.
While a quick trip to the bathroom is all it
takes to find out how plentiful candidates for the
Undergraduate Senate are, GSC candidates are
much fewer and farther between. In fact, a short
fall of graduate candidates threatened to leave
the 15-person GSC without enough members
for next year, until a last-minute push encour
aged more students to run.
But that is not really all that un
usual for graduate elections.
"The graduate student population
has traditionally had challenges at
tracting student officers," said current
GSC co-chair Jenny Allen, who also
writes for The Daily. "Last
year, it was just enough people [to fill
the council]."
Though a record number of grad
uate candidates signed up to run this
year, several dropped out recently
and very few have done substantial
campaigning. And while every under
graduate running for Senate posted a
profile on the elections web site, most
graduate candidates did not.
There is also no candidate from
the School of Education on the ballot,
even though GSC by-laws require
representation from each of the
schools.
The trouble does not end there.
Graduate students also vote in much
fewer numbers than undergraduates,
a phenomenon that some cite as giv
ing undergraduates a disproportion
ate influence in deciding joint meas
ures such as special fees. Though
there are more graduate students
than undergraduates on campus, un
dergraduates counted 60 percent
more voters in last year's elections.
Are graduate students just more
apathetic when it comes to student
government than their younger
peers? Not necessarily, say students
who are regularly involved with
graduate student government.
"It's not so much a lack of inter
est. Graduate students are interested
in these things," said fifth-year elec
trical engineering graduate student
Tom Lee, a former GSC co-chair
who has maintained involvement
with the council for almost three
years.
"But they have a lot of other
things they are also interested in. like
their family and their research," he
added. "When you're trying to weigh
your priorities, those things tend to
float to the top."
In fact, the further graduate stu
dents are in their academic program,
the more time they must spend doing
research and writing dissertations,
leaving less time for involvement in
student government. This explains
why the GSC usually retains few in

cumbents, as older members nearing
the end of their studies no longer
have tree time to commit. This year,
for example, several representatives
decided not to run again even though
they will be on campus next year.
Unlike undergraduates, graduate
students also often identify with their
specific department or school more
than with the graduate community as
a whole, making student government
a resource that few consider.

Yes, we have fewer
people who are
interested, but the
people who we
get are really
committed.
— TOM LEE, grad student

"There's no one community of
graduate students as there are for un
dergrade" Lee said. "Your life is tied
very much to the department or pro
gram you are in, and those things af
fect you more directly than things that
might happen with the ASSU."

There is one exception. Among
those involved in graduate student
government, there is a consensus
about this year's foremost campaign
issue: health care. An ongoing and
complicated saga that dates back
several years, health care for gradu
ate students and their dependents
has become one of the few issues that
transcends departments and schools
and is perhaps the most pressing
concern the GSC will face next year.
Not surprisingly, ASSU Execu
tive candidates — all of whom are
undergraduates — almost universal
ly pay lip service to "health care" in
hopes of attracting graduate votes.
But often they lack detailed propos
als beyond the initial suggestion, of
fering little more to voters than
vague commitments.
"The feeling I get when 1 listen to
these candidates is that they've just
read the GSC web site," Lee said.
"GSC candidates are usually more
substantial."
All this can make the GSC a very
different body than the Undergradu
ate Senate. Whereas most of the Sen
ate's work is conducted by elected
representatives, those familiar with
the graduate council's mechanics say
the GSC works more like a volun
tary organization, often depending
on unelected members to spearhead
initiatives and programs.
"It's both a blessing and a curse,"
Lee said. "Yes, we have fewer peo
ple who are interested, but the peo
ple who we get are really commit
ted. That's [what makes] it very ef
fective."

In turning out the vote, the
ASSU has adopted different strate
gies for undergraduates and gradu
ates. Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08 says that while
the battle with undergraduate
turnout is making students realize
that individual votes count, the bat
tle with graduate turnout is raising
awareness that there are elections
in the first place.
"A large percentage of the gradu
ate population [doesn't] know what
the GSC does," Fraga said. "But it
still affects them quite a bit in terms
of fees and how much they pay."
Last year, there were complaints
that the Elections Commission did
not advertise sufficiently in the grad
uate parts of campus, and instead fo
cused their flyering efforts in places
visible mostly to undergraduates. To
remedy this problem, the GSC allo
cated additional funds to the Com
mission this year for the expressed
purpose of advertising more heavily
to their constituents.
In order to encourage graduates
to vote, the Commission made ap
pearances at several recent graduate
events, something they almost never
do for undergraduates.
Fraga, however, expressed some
frustration with graduate involve
ment in the elections process.
"It shouldn't," he said, "have to
take people being scared that there
are not going to be enough candi
dates to get people to run."

But that is not really all that un
usual for graduate elections.
"The graduate student population
has traditionally had challenges at
tracting student officers," said current
GSC co-chair Jenny Allen, who also
writes for The Daily. "Last
year, it was just enough people [to fill
the council]."
Though a record number of grad
uate candidates signed up to run this
year, several dropped out recently
and very few have done substantial
campaigning. And while every under
graduate running for Senate posted a
profile on the elections web site, most
graduate candidates did not.
There is also no candidate from
the School of Education on the ballot,
even though GSC by-laws require
representation from each of the
schools.
The trouble does not end there.
Graduate students also vote in much
fewer numbers than undergraduates,
a phenomenon that some cite as giv
ing undergraduates a disproportion
ate influence in deciding joint meas
ures such as special fees. Though
there are more graduate students
than undergraduates on campus, un
dergraduates counted 60 percent
more voters in last year's elections.
Are graduate students just more
apathetic when it comes to student
government than their younger
peers? Not necessarily, say students
who are regularly involved with
graduate student government.
"It's not so much a lack of inter
est. Graduate students are interested
in these things," said fifth-year elec
trical engineering graduate student
Tom Lee, a former GSC co-chair
who has maintained involvement
with the council for almost three
years.
"But they have a lot of other
things they are also interested in. like
their family and their research," he
added. "When you're trying to weigh
your priorities, those things tend to
float to the top."
In fact, the further graduate stu
dents are in their academic program,
the more time they must spend doing
research and writing dissertations,
leaving less time for involvement in
student government. This explains
why the GSC usually retains few in

cumbents, as older members nearing
the end of their studies no longer
have tree time to commit. This year,
for example, several representatives
decided not to run again even though
they will be on campus next year.
Unlike undergraduates, graduate
students also often identify with their
specific department or school more
than with the graduate community as
a whole, making student government
a resource that few consider.

Yes, we have fewer
people who are
interested, but the
people who we
get are really
committed.
— TOM LEE, grad student

"There's no one community of
graduate students as there are for un
dergrade" Lee said. "Your life is tied
very much to the department or pro
gram you are in, and those things af
fect you more directly than things that
might happen with the ASSU."

There is one exception. Among
those involved in graduate student
government, there is a consensus
about this year's foremost campaign
issue: health care. An ongoing and
complicated saga that dates back
several years, health care for gradu
ate students and their dependents
has become one of the few issues that
transcends departments and schools
and is perhaps the most pressing
concern the GSC will face next year.
Not surprisingly, ASSU Execu
tive candidates — all of whom are
undergraduates — almost universal
ly pay lip service to "health care" in
hopes of attracting graduate votes.
But often they lack detailed propos
als beyond the initial suggestion, of
fering little more to voters than
vague commitments.
"The feeling I get when 1 listen to
these candidates is that they've just
read the GSC web site," Lee said.
"GSC candidates are usually more
substantial."
All this can make the GSC a very
different body than the Undergradu
ate Senate. Whereas most of the Sen
ate's work is conducted by elected
representatives, those familiar with
the graduate council's mechanics say
the GSC works more like a volun
tary organization, often depending
on unelected members to spearhead
initiatives and programs.
"It's both a blessing and a curse,"
Lee said. "Yes, we have fewer peo
ple who are interested, but the peo
ple who we get are really commit
ted. That's [what makes] it very ef
fective."

In turning out the vote, the
ASSU has adopted different strate
gies for undergraduates and gradu
ates. Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08 says that while
the battle with undergraduate
turnout is making students realize
that individual votes count, the bat
tle with graduate turnout is raising
awareness that there are elections
in the first place.
"A large percentage of the gradu
ate population [doesn't] know what
the GSC does," Fraga said. "But it
still affects them quite a bit in terms
of fees and how much they pay."
Last year, there were complaints
that the Elections Commission did
not advertise sufficiently in the grad
uate parts of campus, and instead fo
cused their flyering efforts in places
visible mostly to undergraduates. To
remedy this problem, the GSC allo
cated additional funds to the Com
mission this year for the expressed
purpose of advertising more heavily
to their constituents.
In order to encourage graduates
to vote, the Commission made ap
pearances at several recent graduate
events, something they almost never
do for undergraduates.
Fraga, however, expressed some
frustration with graduate involve
ment in the elections process.
"It shouldn't," he said, "have to
take people being scared that there
are not going to be enough candi
dates to get people to run."
