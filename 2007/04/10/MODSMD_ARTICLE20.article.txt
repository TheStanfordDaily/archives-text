# It's time for some baseball
## 
### 
It's officially the most wonderful
time of the year, the few months
during the year in which things
actually matter: baseball season.
Some things have been strange
(Cleveland games being "snowed
out"), while other phenomena have
gone on as expected (the Dodgers
sweeping the Giants for eight
straight wins in San Francisco).
With the season just getting
warmed up, here are some of my re
cent thoughts:
Spoke Too Soon?
Yeah, 1 admit it. Just a few short
weeks ago, 1 was singing the prais
es of the Stanford baseball team,
which was in the middle of an
eight-game win streak. 1 argued the
Cardinal just seemed to be doing
everything right, hitting in the
clutch and keeping pitches low in
the zone. Stanford is now 0-6 to
open Pacific-10 Conference play,
the Cardinal's worst conference
start since head coach Mark Mar
quess first took the team's helm in
1977. So where did it go wrong?
Of course, earlier in the season,
star closer junior David Stringer
owned a 2.45 ERA — it's since
climbed up to just under 4.00. The
"clutch hitting" has been anything
but. This past weekend in Tempe,
Ariz.. Stanford allowed two Ari
zona State starters to go eight in
nings. What about doing everything
right? The Cardinal also allowed 10
unearned runs over the weekend,
including six in the series finale.
Marquess had high hopes for his
starters heading into the season,but
so far it's been pretty much unwar
ranted. The staff has posted a 5.86
ERA while allowing 186 runs —
compared to the 162 runs the Cardi
nal has scored.
I'm confident the Cardinal will
get into gear soon enough, but with
out the crucial wins over Texas and
Fullerton that helped propel Stan
ford into the postseason last season,
the squad better get into its winning
ways soon if there is any hope of
reaching the playoffs.
Worth the Price?
Daily columnists are not paid for
their services, and the only thing left
in my wallet is 20 pesos remaining
from my spring break trip to Mexi
cali. But. 1 gotta watch my baseball.

Unfortunately, the only games
broadcast up here in northern ('ali
tor nia are those of the Giants and
A's. So. if I want to watch my
Dodgers kick the crap out of the
rest of the NI. West. I'm going to
have to subscribe to mlb.tv— a
service provided by mlb.com that
allows fans to watch out-of-market

games, lhe site charges $14.95 per
month or $89.95 per year. A premi
um service is also available for
$119.99 all season, allowing fans to
watch six games at one time — all
supposedly at twice the picture
quality of standard mlb.tv.
Subscribers are allowed a live
day trial. ()f course, fans are first re
quired to submit all their credit
card information. If within five days
the subscriber is unsatisfied, he can
send an email to an obscure address
and hope he or she is not billed. My
advice to those die-hard fans: Pur

chase the service for a month to test
it out. II you're extremely unhappy
before the five days are up. then
you won't even be charged the $15.
Iliis is the avenue I selected, for its
1 write this. I'm watching Opening
Day at Dodgers Stadium as if 1
were back in Los Angeles.
A-Rod, the Hero
Yes, those were cheers you
heard as Alex Rodriguez came up
to bat Sunday afternoon, shortly
before he knocked a home run to
rally even more support, lhe sud
den burst of loyalty resulted from
his walk-off grand slam against the
Orioles the previous day. But. don't
get too excited yet. After all. this is
the same guy that batted eighth in
the playoffs last season — just one
year after winning the Al MVP
award. Iliis isn't the first time A-
Rod has received praise in the
Bronx. He'll make an error sooner
or later, and he'll be playing for an
other team sooner rather than
later.
