# It's time for some baseball
## 
### 
It's officially the most wonderful
time of the year, the few months
during the year in which things
actually matter: baseball season.
Some things have been strange
(Cleveland games being "snowed
out"), while other phenomena have
gone on as expected (the Dodgers
sweeping the Giants for eight
straight wins in San Francisco).
With the season just getting
warmed up, here are some of my re
cent thoughts:
Spoke Too Soon?
Yeah, 1 admit it. Just a few short
weeks ago, 1 was singing the prais
es of the Stanford baseball team,
which was in the middle of an
eight-game win streak. 1 argued the
Cardinal just seemed to be doing
everything right, hitting in the
clutch and keeping pitches low in
the zone. Stanford is now 0-6 to
open Pacific-10 Conference play,
the Cardinal's worst conference
start since head coach Mark Mar
quess first took the team's helm in
1977. So where did it go wrong?
Of course, earlier in the season,
star closer junior David Stringer
owned a 2.45 ERA — it's since
climbed up to just under 4.00. The
"clutch hitting" has been anything
but. This past weekend in Tempe,
Ariz.. Stanford allowed two Ari
zona State starters to go eight in
nings. What about doing everything
right? The Cardinal also allowed 10
unearned runs over the weekend,
including six in the series finale.
Marquess had high hopes for his
starters heading into the season,but
so far it's been pretty much unwar
ranted. The staff has posted a 5.86
ERA while allowing 186 runs —
compared to the 162 runs the Cardi
nal has scored.
I'm confident the Cardinal will
get into gear soon enough, but with
out the crucial wins over Texas and
Fullerton that helped propel Stan
ford into the postseason last season,
the squad better get into its winning
ways soon if there is any hope of
reaching the playoffs.
Worth the Price?
Daily columnists are not paid for
their services, and the only thing left
in my wallet is 20 pesos remaining
from my spring break trip to Mexi
cali. But. 1 gotta watch my baseball.
