1 RM. ET

The game started with a goal by
Denver (11-2) freshman midfield
Ali Flury, but by the time the clock
read 21:35, things were looking up
for Stanford (4-7) as junior attack
Daphne Patterson and her team
mate senior midfielder Liz Piselli,
scored two goals to uive Stanford a
2-1 lead.
The indomitable Pioneers only
used this as a source of motivation,
however, and the Stanford women
would not find themselves in the
lead for the remainder of the game.
Despite yellow cards for Denver
sophomore defense Katelyn Tag
gart and sophomore midfielder
Karen Morton, the Pioneers went
on to score three successive goals to
take a 4-2 lead with 10:30 left in the

half. The Cardinal and the Pioneers
traded goals back and forth for the
remainder of the half, with key
goals coming from sophomore mid
fields Bess Siegfried and Maris
Perlman. As both teams headed for
the locker room, the Cardinal was
behind. 6-4. but still in the game.
A Denver goal early in the sec
ond half was followed just 30 sec
onds later by Patterson's second
point of the day, keeping the Cardi
nal within two. Stanford soon en
countered trouble, though, as Den
ver's Steph Coyne, Kristie Leggio
and Karen Morton managed to
whip three balls into the back of the
net to give the Pioneers their largest
lead of the game with a 10-5 margin.
A goal by Stanford junior attack
Megan McClain briefly closed the

gap to four, but by the 4:55 mark
Denver was once again sitting on a
five-goal lead.
Stanford freshman midfielder
Julie Christy, last week's Moutain
Pacific Sports Federation co-Player
of the Week, and sophomore mid
field Jamie Nesbitt retaliated with
two quick goals, but the final blow
came when Coyle scored her fourth
goal of the game, bringing the final
score to 12-8. Throughout the game
Stanford suffered 20 turnovers,
making costly ball handling errors
that eventually helped the Pioneers
secure the win.
Freshman attack/midfield Dana
Lindsay, the star of Stanford's last
game against Vanderbilt. said that


JASON CHUANG/The Stanford Daily
Junior attacker Daphne Patterson notched two goals in the Cardinal's loss to
Denver on Sunday. Her second goal cut the Pioneers' lead to 7-5, but that was
as close as Stanford could get to catching its MPSF rival.
the Cardinal will take the loss as
motivation to meet the Pioneers
again in the postseason.
"At this point, we just look for
ward to learning from our mistakes
and hopefully getting another shot
at Denver in the MPSF tourna
ment." she said.

Last year's MPSb championship
game also pitted Stanford against
the Pioneers, but that time (unlike
on Friday), the matchup concluded
with a Cardinal victory.
Stanford have a few more games
to go before MPSF Tournament
time however, starting with a trip to
Ithaca, N.Y. this weekend to take on
Cornell. Draw time for Sunday's
game is scheduled for 1 p.m. EST.
