As a senator I will work to ensure
that students have a closer connection
with the ASSU. I also want to see Stan
ford become a better place for students
by lowering fees wherever possible, in
creasing conveniences for students,
and ensuring that all student groups get
the funding they need while becoming
less dependent on special fees.
