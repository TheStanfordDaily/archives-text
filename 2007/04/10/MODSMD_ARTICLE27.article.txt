SOPHOMORE

As a sophomore, I have had the
opportunity of having almost 2 years
on this campus. That means that I
have heard the issues and concerns
many different students have in rela
tion to both student life and the ad
ministration. With that, I felt that it
would be necessary for to act as a

voice for the student body and run
for an undergraduate senate posi
tion. There are many different issues
that I would like work on that range
from grad/ faculty diversity to in
creased areas of use of parking per
mits. Vote for me and I will get the
job done.
