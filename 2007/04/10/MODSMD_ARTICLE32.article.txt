FRESHMAN

Why Senate? Simple because I
will work with fellow senators and
university administrators to promote
a "Stanford Mood" that enables
YOU to have a high impact on the
workings of the University. More
specifically, 1 aim to work on an in
crease in student study and meeting
places including an ease in reserving
rooms for events, fair labor policies
for Stanford workers without any re
strictions, improvements in dining

options and streamlined funding for
smaller groups. I have been endorsed
by SOCC and will continuously
strive to uphold both student and fac
ulty diversity. So "Get in the Mood,
Vote Mahmood."
