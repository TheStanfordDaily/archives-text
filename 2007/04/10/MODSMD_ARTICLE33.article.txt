Last week, I asked several Stan
ford students a simple question:
"What exactly does the ASSIi do?"
Most people shrugged their shoulders
and simply answered, "I dunno."
This shows me one thing: there is
terrible communication between the
ASSU and the students they are sup
posed to represent. II elected, 1 will
work with the senate's communica
tions committee to ensure the stu
dents know EXACTLY what the
ASSU's responsibilities are and what
they are doing through bi-weekh
publications and a more user-friendly
feedback option on the ASSU web
site in addition to many other initia
tives. SOCC Endorsed.
