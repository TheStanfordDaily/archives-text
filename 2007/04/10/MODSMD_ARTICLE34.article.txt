FRESHMAN

I have a vision for a hotter Stanford
and I believe I have the passion and
abilities to realize that vision. I am
dedicated, efficient, attentive, and
(when necessary) aggressive. As a
Senator, I will promote the interests
of students and attempt to improve
the Stanford experience. 1 have been
extensively involved with student
government and this year, as the
ASSU Frosh Council Chair of the In
terdormitory Activities Committee. I
organized West Campus Came Night
and Wilbur Game Night to give fresh
men opportunities to branch out and
to make new friends. I am endorsed
by the Stanford Democrats and
SAID.
