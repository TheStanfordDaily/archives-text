SOPHOMORE

I am running for the Undergraduate
Senate because I possess the experi
ence and desire to serve that Stan
ford's undergraduate community
needs. I have worked with both the
Executive and Legislative branches of
the ASSU for the past two years, and I
have intimate knowledge of its work
ings. In addition. I am genuinely com
mitted to addressing the most pressing
concerns of the undergraduate com
munity and acting as a liaison between
the student body and the administra
tion. Three issues I am especially pas
sionate about are safeguarding faculty
diversity, improving OSA-student re
lations, and making campus more en
vironmentally friendly. Thank you.
