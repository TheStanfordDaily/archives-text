# JONATHAN KASS
## 
### 
FRESHMAN

When it comes to work, I'm hard
core. No, seriously. When I say I'm
going to do something, I do it. I also
have almost never-ending enthusi
asm for student affairs. I am there
fore very excited to he trying for Sen
ator, a position where I can combine
these two aspects of me.
Some of my main platforms are
reducing the cost of course readers
by standardizing the process to go

to outside printers, fixing syl
labus.stanford.edu, advocating a
gender-blind housing option, loos
er restrictions for parties, and fix
ing advising programs for freshmen
and sophomores. So remember...
Don't let another year pass without
Jonathan Kass!
