So many students on campus have little idea of what the
ASSU does, and I believe this needs to change. Being a part of
the system as an Undergraduate Senator will allow me to
work towards the implementation of more outlets for student
voice within the ASSU as a whole. I will also work to improve
communication between the student voice, the administration
and the ASSU,support the existence of diverse groups and ac
tivities on campus, listen and respond to student concerns and

FRESHMAN

questions, and above all, act as a responsible student liaison when serving the
Stanford community.
