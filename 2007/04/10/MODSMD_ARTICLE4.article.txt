## X-ray breaks down bio molecules 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
A new world-class tool for examining
the structures of complex molecules was
added last month to the suite of technolo
gies available at the Stanford Synchotron
Radiation Lab (SSRL) facility at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
Ihe new "molecular observatory" — also
known as an x-ray beamline — was fund
ed by the California Institute ofTechnolo
gy (CalTech) with a grant from the Gor
don and Betty Moore Foundation.
Scientists hope that the automated
new x-ray beamline will enable re
searchers around the globe to study the
structures of larger molecules in smaller

quantities — breaking the field of struc
tural biology wide open.
"This is the most advanced instrument
that we have," said SSRL scientist Keith
Hodgson. "You can really push at the
frontiers of biocomplexity."
The new beamline will be used in a
technique called x-ray crystallography,
which scientists use to take pictures of the
shapes of large molecules like enzymes
and other proteins. In crystallography a
beam of x-rays is shot through a crys
talline array of molecules that then bend
the radiation in characteristic patterns.
These patterns are not exact images of
the molecules, but scientists can use them
to calculate molecular structures.
"X-rays are the most used and power-

tul method to determine
the structure of macromol
ecules," said SSRL Directo

Joachim Stohr."We have to build

a crystal out of individual proteins. We
have thousands of millions of these pro
teins all lined up. When we shoot our x
ray through we get a diffraction pattern,
and from that pattern we can deduce the
structure of an individual protein that sits
within the crystal."
"You can think of [crystallography]
like a microscope," Structural Biology
Prof. Bill Weis said. "You shine light at
something and you observe its image. The
problem is we have no x-ray lens, so we
have computational patterns that we use
to reconstruct the image."

Weis is one of a
number of scientists around

the world who will be able to use

the new facility.The beamline will enable
him to determine the structures of mole
cules that are not normally soluble in
water — proteins bound up in the mem
branes of cells.
These molecules are often more diffi
cult to crystallize: Out of the 42,626 pro
teins with known structures, less than five
