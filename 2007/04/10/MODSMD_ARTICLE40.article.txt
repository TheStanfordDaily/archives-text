FRESHMAN

care about student interests.
Students are the foundation and
driving force of Stanford, and I
would love to represent them. I will
bring relevant and achievable stu
dent problems to the forefront.
Problems such as improving the fi
nancial resources available to stu
dent groups as well as making the
process of using various spaces on

campus less costly and more user
friendly. In the spirit of Cardinal
unity, I will further promote the in
tegration of cultural and social
groups. I will advocate diversity at
Stanford, and improve the channels
for voicing concerns to the ASSU. I
am readv to be your Senator.
