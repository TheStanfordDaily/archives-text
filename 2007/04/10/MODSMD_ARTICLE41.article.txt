Mv slogan: The Extra 'U' in my
name is for You.
I will make it easier for students
to achieve their goals. This means
resisting OSA restrictions on social
life and parties, standing behind
groups and students facing discipli
nary actions, and ending restrictions
on fundraising. This also means
making Special Fees applications
more accessible and the ASSU more
responsive and transparent.
I wish to encourage meaningful

dialogue on campus. This means pro
viding more support and funds for
joint speakers and panels, funding
advocacy groups and publications,
and enlisting the muscle of the ASSU
to bring the best speakers to campus.
