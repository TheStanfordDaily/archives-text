If elected, my main concern would
be to make the students more involved
with university decision-making. 1 will
attempt to make the ASSU senate ad
dress students' concerns directly. Our
greatest strength as a student body is
our diversity and open-mindedness. I
will make sure that every student group
can voice its concerns. Promoting dia
logue on various issues is the only way
to achieve intellectual solutions.
