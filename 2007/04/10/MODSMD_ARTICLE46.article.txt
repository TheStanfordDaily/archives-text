# Class President Candidates (Sophomores)
## THE
						GIVING TREE Durell Coleman '10, Cameron Drake '10, Andi Pimentel '10, Jeremy Voss '10

What would be your one top priority in office and why? As the
name of our slate suggests, we'll be about giving. Giving to others —
through a Class of 2010 Field Day with the elementary students of
East Palo Alto — and giving to our class and each other—through
events like the Big Game Bonfire, an old Stanford tradition that
we'll make new. We know awkward, so we'll start a Sophomore
Speed Dating Day. Then, to break the silence, a Water Balloon Day:
East Campus vs. West, two sides of White Plaza, and we clean up.
Class presidents have a proscribed job: They organize and create
events. So that's what we've been brainstorming about for the last
six weeks, and what we'll deliver on next year if we're lucky enough
to get your vote. (Sorry if our T-shirts have blinded you.) Be Giving.
Be Tree. Branch Out.
What qualities will you as a team bring to the presidency? The
qualities we'll bring to the job are simple: Energy, compassion, and
big barrels of fun. We're honest, too. But the fact that we acknowl
edge the duties of the job — making events — has clearly not limit
ed our plans. We have specific goals with a general theme: having a
good time while giving back or not. Our interests are all over the
place. A girl who is starting a program for Stanford's maintenace
workers focusing on early child development education. A varsity
athlete. A mentor in the East Palo Alto Stanford Academy. Frosh
Council. Gaieties. BSU. With our energy, we'll make events big and
weird and fun. We would be grateful to have the chance to make our
promises real.
