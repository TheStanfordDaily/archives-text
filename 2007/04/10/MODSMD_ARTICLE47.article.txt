What would he your one tup priority in office and why?
Our top priority in office is accurately representing the di
verse wishes and concerns of our entire class. Many of the
ideas on our platform (for example, freshmen dorm re
unions and textbook rentals) came from casual conversa
tions with different students when we asked them how we
could improve their lives at Stanford. By taking student
polls and having Soph Serve socials, monthly social gather
ings that would allow sophomores to reunite and interact
with their student government, we will be able to listen to
the changes that sophomores would like to see made at
Stanford. This is our top priority because we have a genuine
interest in serving our class the "sweetest" year possible.

What qualities will you as a team bring to the presidency?
Soph Serve is diverse, diligent, and dedicated. We each bring
unique skill sets due to our diverse backgrounds in terms of
extra curricular involvements, residences, ethnicities, gen
der, and our experiences in general. We are most able to rep
resent the entire class of 2010 because we are the only slate
that has an equal number of representatives from East and
West Campus. We are also the only slate whose members
have all had experience working with the ASSU on Frosh
Council. Most importantly, we care. We want to make \isi
ble and significant improvements in students' lives. To see
our unique and diverse experiences in more specificity, visit
