What M ould be your one top priority
in office and why? Our top priority
for the class of 2010 is reinvigorating
the Stanford social atmosphere. We
realize that this priority is broad but
there a few specific ways whereby we
believe we can address this issue.
1 Reinvigorate Friday and Saturday
nights
- Better and more unique frat par
ties
- Fully utilize Old Union (games,
performances bv student groups,
etc)
2. Support our sports teams and the
arts
- Official tailgating events for cer
tain sports events.
- More Concerts by mainstream
and local artists.
3. Maintain Stanford traditions
- Exciting homecoming events
- A Memorable Sophomore For
mal
- Bringing back the Big Game
Bonfire
4. Pop the Stanford bubble
- Networking with nearby col
leges/organizations for large scale
events.
What qualities will you as a team
bring to the presidency? Before we

became The Usual Suspects, we
would regularly gather in Room 216
to muse over college life — classes,
inconsistent Friday and Saturday
nights, dorm gossip, etc. Upon hear
ing about the opportunity to repre
sent the sophomore class and leave
our footprint on the class, we were
stoked. Not only are we really close
friends but we are visionaries at
heart. While we may never see eye
to-eye on some issues (e.g. success in

relationships, the merits of cock
blockery,), we believe that our
unique interpersonal dynamic is key
to the advancement of our class. We
mirror the student body in its well
endowed diversity and in our far
reaching involvement in the commu
nity. We are AIM. ASSU. BSU.
MSA, PSA, SLE, SSE amongst
other acronymous organizations.
Most importantly, we're practical
and we keep it real.
