# Filipino vigil honors veterans
## Filipino-American Student Union commemorates 65-year anniversary of Bataan Death March 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sixty-five years ago this week,
thousands of American and Filipino
soldiers who surrendered to the
Japanese after the Battle of Bataan
were forcibly marched more than 60
miles to prison camps in what is now
known as the Bataan Death March.
Last night, members of the
Pilipino-American Student Union
(PASU) held a candlelight vigil in
the Oval to commemorate the an
niversary of the march — during
which, according to some estimates,
l(),(M)() of the 75,000 captives died
before reaching the prison camps.
Ilie vigil — which also supported
the pending Filipino Veterans Equal
ity Act (FVEA) — was part of a na
tionwide series of events coordinat
ed by Student Action for Veterans
Equity, an advocacy group of which
PASU is a member organization.
Members of PASU worked for

two months to organize and plan the
campus vigil, and similar events
took place tin college campuses
across the nation, ranging from Cal
ifornia to Virginia.
"This is a vigil to commemorate
and remind us that Filipino veterans
who fought in World War 11 have not
received benefits," said Michael
Dela Cruz'o7.
Approximately 75,000 candles
— one for each soldier forced to
participate in the 1942 march —
were lit across the country last night,
including 300 to 350 at Stanford.
FVEA first appeared in Con
gress in IIWl l W and is scheduled for
discussion by the Senate Veteran's
Affairs Committee tomorrow.
The act aims to rectify and re
verse the Rescission Act of 1946,
which stripped American-allied
World War II Filipino soldiers of
their veteran status. If ratified,
FVEA will help the approximately
20,(XX) living Filipino veterans who

organizers said currently lack access
to many veterans' benefits.
" Iliis year has been projected as
the year in which this issue is re
solved." said llialy Gutierrez '07. a
member of PASU. "The majority of
Representatives that have support
ed the issue are in Congress right
now. The person who is chairman of
the Veteran's Affairs Committee
has supported the issue."
Vigil coordinators said that rais
ing awareness about F ilipino veter
ans' issues was an important goal of
last night's event.
"The bills have been doing better
each time around, but the biggest
problem is still getting attention to

the issue," Dela Cruz said. "We hope
to bring this issue to the attention of
the younger generation."
PASU co-chair Dana Austria '08
expressed optimism that F ; VEA
would be passed in the next year. If
the act is approved, she said, it
would be beneficial to the Filipino-
American community as a whole
because of the centrality of veter
ans' issues.
"There are issues of youth, edu
cation. culture, housing," Austria
said."lt's one population,but it cov
ers so many issues."
