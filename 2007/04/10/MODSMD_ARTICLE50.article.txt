# Class President Candidates (Upperclassmen)
## THREE CHICKS AND A NARODICK Nada Boutros '08, Arielle Montgomery '08, Philip Narodick '08, Natasha Pereira-Kamath '08 
### 
What would be your one top
priority in office and why? T
ogether, Three Chicks and a Nar
odick have the primary goal of en
suring that 2008 is a year our class
will never forget. We have every
intention of making pub nights,
the formals, and the commence
ment speaker memorable by
working alongside the OSA early
on and collecting as much input
from students as possible through
surveys and our blog www.stan-
I (>rdsen iors. blogspot .com.
Above all, however, we want
to keep our class connected
throughout our senior year and
after graduation from Stanford
with the use of our website
www.stanfordseniors.com for '08
events, your input, and updates.
What qualities will you as a
team bring to the presidency?
Our team is special because we
are not a group of friends from a
couple communities on campus.
We represent many different
facets of Stanford's student bodv

and our class resulting in a team
which will best address the issues
that matter most to you and your
community on campus â€”
chances are you probably already
know one of us.
The ideal Senior Class Presi
dent would need to be detail-ori
ented, dedicated, and approach
able. Our ample work and cam
pus experience has made our
team detailed enough and the
dedication piece is something we
can show you.
We will be very accessible be
cause as presidents we believe
that we wouldn't be doing our job
correctly if we didn't work closely
with you in addition to the OSA.
And if nothing else, we have a
sense of humor as you can see
from our group's name. Remem
ber : Vote Three Chicks and a
Narodick.
