What would be your one top priority in
office and why? Our top priority is to unify
the class of 2(X)9, whether here on The
Farm or abroad. We have a number of
ideas for how to achieve this goal. Our
class has shown tremendous support for
service-related activities, so we plan to
hold a Charity Vegas Night. To reconnect
students abroad with Stanford life, we will
have welcome back picnics at the begin
nings of Winter and Spring Quarters.
Once each quarter, we will organize Stan-
Grams: in White Plaza, students can write

notes and send small care packages to
their friends abroad. Because Junior For
m;d is the biggest event for our class, we
want to change it from a memorable night
to an outstanding experience. We want to
make Junior Formal a package deal: not
only will we bring you to a great night of
music and dance, hut we'll also offer a
hotel deal for interested (Wers. When
Spring Quarter comes around, we don't
want to waste the beautiful weather; we'll
organize a class-wide sand volleyball tour
nament. We want to make sure that our

time at Stanford gets better and better.
What qualities will you as a team
bring to the presidency? As a slate, we
have a lot to offer to the class of 2009.
We've got tons of new ideas, we've had
diverse Stanford careers, and more than
anything, we're really excited to have
the opportunity to serve our classmates.
We have a lot of experience in serving
the student body, and we want to take
advantage of our different abilities to
make our junior year unforgettable.
