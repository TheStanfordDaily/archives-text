## Aaron Smith '08 and Kyle Ladewig '08 
### 
If you could changc only one thing over the
course of your tenure in office, w hat would it be,
and why? A major concern that must be ad
dressed is the transparency of ASSU. We be
lieve the majority of students on campus don't
know their ASSU executives and more impor
tantly, don't even know what they do! Also,
many view ASSU as a separate entity from the
Stanford Population. We plan to change ASSU
by making it a more visible organization that can
be utilized by anyone. Through our involvement
throughout the past three years, we have devel
oped intimate relationships with students and
student groups as well as many influential ad
ministrative figures. If elected, we will only en
courage and increase more relationships by
making ourselves easily accessible through a
regularly updated website and by providing our
personal emails to allow students to contact us
individually about any concerns. We want to as
sure that you know who we arc, what we do, and
how to reach us.

Why are you qualified to hold this position?
We have actively been a part of multiple student
groups and held many leadership positions. Dur
ing the past three years, we have dedicated our
time to many student groups, and have only
yearned to apply ourselves to more challenging
and influential positions. But most importantly,
through our various groups, we have developed
the ability to work with groups as well as within
groups. In order to effectively achieve a goal, one

must efficiently organize the right
individuals, coordinate cooperation,
and set realistic, quantifiable and re
viewable goals. We understand the
infrastructure of student groups and
we have worked between groups.
Combined, these assets will be cru
cial at the school wide level.
What sets you apart from the
other slates? First and foremost, we
are not politicians. We are student
leaders. We have not chosen to run
for this position to pad our resume
nor do we see it as a means to an end

in providing a foundation for our po
litical careers. We enjoy being highly
involved and through our student
groups, we have been able to make
major changes. In addition, we bring
a fresh outsider's perspective to the
ASSU office because we have been
apart the Stanford community, and
we have dealt with the challenges stu
dents and students groups face. We
can apply this knowledge to properly
dealing with the issues of the students
at a campus-wide level. Now, com
bined with our passion and love for
Stanford, we plan to apply our dedi
cation. and ability to effectively get
things done to the entire Stanford
community.
