If you could change only one thing over
the course of your tenure in office, what
would it be, and why? A top priority of ours
is making the ASSU an institution that is
accountable and visible to Stanford stu
dents. A student government that neither
makes good on its promises nor advocates
for what students want is ultimately ineffec
tive. Moreover, invisible government hurts
the credibility and legitimacy of the institu
tion.
In the case of Old Union, we fought suc
cessfully to reopen the channels of commu
nication between students and administra
tors, and we asserted a strong student voice
into the construction of a building that will
impact thousands of students on campus.
Now. students will be given the opportunity

to learn the details of Old Union, and to
voice their concerns through focus groups
and other communications with ASSIJ offi
cials. As ASSU Executives, we want to con
tinue in this tradition of gauging student
concerns, and then advocating on their be
half to the Administration. Furthermore,
disenchantment with the ASSU is due

largely to the fact that many people
simply do not know what their stu
dent government is doing. As
ASSU Executives, we will work
with all branches of the ASSU to
coordinate highly visible events and
services, as well as to communicate
the status of our initiatives to the
entire campus community.
Why are you qualified to hold
this position? Wc are qualified for
the position of ASSU Executive be
cause of our extensive work as elect

oil ASSU officials and leaders with
in the Stanford community. Her
shey is currently the Chair of the
Undergraduate Senate, and sets the
policy agenda for the Senate. Under
his leadership, the Senate avoided a
financial crisis, ensured efficient
travel to the Big Game this year,
and refocused its efforts on student
advocacy. As chair of the Senate
Advocacy Committee, Mondaire is
in tune with the needs of students.
He worked to pass ASSU resolu
tions urging the I Jniversity to elimi
nate restrictions one student use of
the Legal Counseling Office, to use
sweat-free labor in the production
of collegiate apparel, and to pro
mote faculty and graduate student

diversity.
What sets you apart from the other
slates? Our qualifications for the po
sition of ASSIJ Executive are exten
sive, especially in comparison to
other candidates. We feel that our
demonstrated ability to get results
also distinguishes us from the com
petition. Our platform is the most
well-researched and practical. For
example, we don't promise to re
form the draw to a three-tier system
when this will already he done hv
2010. Additionally, we are not a
purely social slate; our initiatives
place an unparalleled emphasis on
student advocacy. Please remember
to vote Avula/Jones.
