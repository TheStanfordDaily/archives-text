## RAFFI MARDIROSIAN 
### 
FRESHMAN

Class of 2010, MS&E/I.R.
1 am running to effect changes
that I strongly believe need to be im
plemented.
1 think:
* OSA Party Policies need more stu
dent input
* Bureaucratic Fees need reduction

to control the rising cost of education
* Solar Power / Recycling helps cam
pus sustainability
* The Arts need more emphasis and
funding
* A Sweat-free Campus is part of
Stanford's global duty.
I pride myself on being able to take
issues as they arise and analyze them
with an open and critical mind,
