FRESHMAN

After seven years of competing at na
tional and international unicycling
championships, I am ready to unite
my world-champion dedication with
this world-class organization. 1 hope
to bring a renewed sense of balance to
t he ASSU by returning to the roots of
our association and focus on the im
mediate concerns of the Stanford
community. My main initiatives in
clude the continued support for need
based financial aid for international
students, increased communication
across campus, free airport shuttle for

Stanford students, improvements on
the roll-over dining program and so
much more! Through these projects I
plan to promote community building
and diversity throughout campus.
