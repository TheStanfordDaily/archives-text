FRESHMAN

As a Senate Associate, I discovered new ways that the ASSU
could serve the student hodv. One of my priorities will be re
forming the reserve policy at Green Library so that students
who cannot afford textbooks do not have to compete for books
on reserve during exam week and are able to check them out for
more than two hours. Next year, 1 will promote sustainability by
encouraging Stanford Dining and additional row houses to
adopt environmentally friendly programs. In addition, I will in
vestigate gender-blind housing and educate student groups
about funding opportunities.
Endorsed by Stanford Democrats, JSA and QSA.
