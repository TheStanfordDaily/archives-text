# New course evals. are restricted
## No replacement for Courseguide; students cannot see how faculty rated 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
Today is an important day for those students who neglected to fill
out their winter quarter course evaluations.
I"hey can finally see their grades on Axess, two full weeks after
students who did evaluate their professors andTAs were able to see
how they did.
But even those students who finished their evaluations by the
deadline are not able to see how their peers ranked the same profes
sors or how faculty for classes they are taking this quarter fared in
evaluations. Professional colleagues, department chairs and deans
are able to see the quantitative ratings of teachers, but they are not
authorized to view the comments written by students about other
faculty.
At last month's Faculty Senate meeting, outgoing Registrar
Roger Printup did not offer a concrete response to a pressing ques
tion for many students: when the data collected from the evalua
tions will be released to the student body.
Printup said the University was considering making the release
of student feedback a "faculty option" — that is, professors would
be able to decide whether or not the results of their evaluations
would be released to students — but he emphasized that nothing
had yet been decided.
The online evaluations, which have drawn praise from the Reg
istrar's Office, also led to the disappearance of the online
Courseguide, a database of student feedback previously published
by the ASSU from course evaluations completed at the end of each
quarter.
Printup told faculty members that the new system — which was
piloted in the winter of 2005 and fully deployed last fall — garnered
an overall response rate of 88.8 percent, a mark significantly higher
than previous years.
According to statistics Printup released at the meeting, 1.758
classes and 721 sections were evaluated during the online system's
trial run. Students must be enrolled in the course (eliminating audi
tors from the evaluation process) and all classes containing three or
more students were assessed. Courses offered through the Schools
of Law, Business and Medicine were exempt from the evaluation
process unless cross-listed with undergraduate offerings.
Engineering Prof. Brad Osgood. Humanities and Sciences Prof.
Susan Stephens, Education Prof. David Labaree and Earth Sciences
Prof. Stephan Graham all aided Printup with the project.
In an email to The Daily, Stephens said that her role in develop
ing the system was "pretty minimal."
"The Registrar has done the heavy lifting,"she said,"and the cog
nizant deans of all schools that use the new evaluations have met on
