# New course evals. are restricted
## No replacement for Courseguide; students cannot see how faculty rated 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
Today is an important day for those students who neglected to fill
out their winter quarter course evaluations.
I"hey can finally see their grades on Axess, two full weeks after
students who did evaluate their professors andTAs were able to see
how they did.
But even those students who finished their evaluations by the
deadline are not able to see how their peers ranked the same profes
sors or how faculty for classes they are taking this quarter fared in
evaluations. Professional colleagues, department chairs and deans
are able to see the quantitative ratings of teachers, but they are not
authorized to view the comments written by students about other
faculty.
At last month's Faculty Senate meeting, outgoing Registrar
Roger Printup did not offer a concrete response to a pressing ques
tion for many students: when the data collected from the evalua
tions will be released to the student body.
Printup said the University was considering making the release
of student feedback a "faculty option" — that is, professors would
be able to decide whether or not the results of their evaluations
would be released to students — but he emphasized that nothing
had yet been decided.
The online evaluations, which have drawn praise from the Reg
istrar's Office, also led to the disappearance of the online
Courseguide, a database of student feedback previously published
by the ASSU from course evaluations completed at the end of each
quarter.
Printup told faculty members that the new system — which was
piloted in the winter of 2005 and fully deployed last fall — garnered
an overall response rate of 88.8 percent, a mark significantly higher
than previous years.
According to statistics Printup released at the meeting, 1.758
classes and 721 sections were evaluated during the online system's
trial run. Students must be enrolled in the course (eliminating audi
tors from the evaluation process) and all classes containing three or
more students were assessed. Courses offered through the Schools
of Law, Business and Medicine were exempt from the evaluation
process unless cross-listed with undergraduate offerings.
Engineering Prof. Brad Osgood. Humanities and Sciences Prof.
Susan Stephens, Education Prof. David Labaree and Earth Sciences
Prof. Stephan Graham all aided Printup with the project.
In an email to The Daily, Stephens said that her role in develop
ing the system was "pretty minimal."
"The Registrar has done the heavy lifting,"she said,"and the cog
nizant deans of all schools that use the new evaluations have met on
occasion to decide on short-term
policies as the new system is tested."
A March 30 meeting clarified the
issue.
"The decision was to wait until we
have the full year of data." Stephens
said. "At the beginning of the aca
demic year, we would like to meet
with the relevant ASSU people to
work out what will be available for
students."
Printup confirmed Stevens' state
ment in an email to Hie Daily, ex
plaining that the committee will re
visit the issue of releasing student
feedback in the future, after deter
mining "the validity of the evaluation
process."
While the committee is hesitant to
release definite plans for the future of
Courseguide.a number of ASSU Ex
ecutive candidates have made the
publication of the new online evalua
tions a central issue in their cam
paigns.
Brett 1 iammon '08, who is running

for ASSU President with Lakshmi
Karra '08 as his Vice President, ac
knowledged that the new online sys
tem does necessitate a new method
for interpreting the data collected
from students.
"Whatever the validity of the re
sults, releasing them would be more
helpful to students than not having
any information at all," he said. "We
will make it a priority to get (the re
sults] out in less than a year."
1 lershey Avula '08. another ASSU
Executive candidate running with
Mondaire Jones '09, had specific sug
gestions in his campaign platform.
"We could make their results
available on an system through
Axess," he said. "We could compro
mise by having a section in the online
Courseguide in which students could
add their own written feedback.
"We want at least the expected
grade, average hours of workload
and how people graded lecturers."
he said. "The way we understand it,
the best and earliest possible date
to bring back Courseguide is fall
2007."
