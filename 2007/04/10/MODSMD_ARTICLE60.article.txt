Stanford is an institution that gives us little seope to
eomplain about how things are run here. However,
that shouldn't and doesn't negate the fact that stu
dents still have concerns they would like to see heard
and dealt with; issues like high textbook prices, better
dining options using meal-points that would be ac
cepted at more locations around campus, greater
number of locations in the Bing Overseas Program,
transparency in renovation of the Old Union into a
complete student-space, and certainly more say in ad
ministrative and ASSU decisions. I strongly believe I
can help bring about these changes as a Senator.
