FRESHMAN

As undergraduate senator, I will
make your voice heard. I intend
to increase communication be
tween the senate and student
body so that the senate can re
spond more quickly to student

concerns. Along these lines. I plan to work with stu
dent groups to advocate improvements in 112 unding
and group space. Further, 1 will improve dialogue be
tween the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) and the
senate, so that student concerns are both heard and
addressed. As an ASSU outsider, I bring fresh per
spectives to the table through which I can find cre
ative solutions and better represent your voice.
