# STUDENT LIFE
## Student-written play thrives in small setting 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A tiny set without an elevated stage
and a tight seating arrangement in the
small Elliot Performance Center was
the setting for last weekend's "A
Crooked Line," an Asian American
Theater Project (AATP) production.
Audience members at the play —
which sold out the last two days of its
Thursday-Saturday run — witnessed
the theater group make the statement
that the Stanford drama scene, despite
its space crunch, offers more than
enough room for artistic merit and
passion.
"1 think this dispels the notion that
the only dramatic performances worth
watching at Stanford are those staged
by the Drama Department and Ram's
Head," said Bryan Tan '07, one of the
play's lead actors. "TTiere are perform
ance groups out there who can rival
[both groups] in acting, directing and
technical quality."
The play's directory, Alex Mallory
'08. said smaller drama groups like
AATP face a space crunch on campus.
"The largest setback is the lack of
performance space,"she said. "We had
to set up and take down the set every
night for a week, which takes away
from our time and adds a lot of work to
evervone's load."

"It was a challenge," she said, "for
me to turn the show — which is de
signed for a large-budget, big-stage
production — into something that
would fit into the small Elliot Pro
gramming Center space."
The student-written play is about a
Korean American family's struggles as
three siblings are forced to choose dif
ferent ways of dealing with the war on
the Korean peninsula.
"I don't think that I've come across
a single full-length student-written
play during my entire four years here
at Stanford," Tan said. "One-acts, ves.
Student films, yes. but never a full
length staged piece."
The script was written entirely by
Modern Thought and Literature grad
uate student Ju Yon Kim. who began
writing the play three years ago as an
assignment for Artist in Residence
Cherric Moraga's playwriting course.
"A Crooked Line" is Kim's first fully
staged piece.
"It was both incredibly terrifying
and rewarding to sec the script come to
life." Kim said.
The actors, none of whom were Ko
rean. had to find a way to understand
Korean cultural experiences and effec
tively communicate these experiences
to a diverse audience.
"We had to learn some basic Korean
phrases." Tan said, "and ask friends
about certain aspects of Korean cul
ture to help us better understand how
the characters would interact."
Kim said that the play's ambiguity
and explicit, but sometimes specific,
cultural overtones were crucial to its

message.
"I actually think that both relating
and not relating can be productive and
important experiences," she said. "I
imagine that a single audience mem
ber is constantly moving between feel
ing close and distant from the per
formance."
Kim added that some of the burden
rested on the audience's understand
ing and stressed that communication
between herself and audience mem
bers would help her gauge the play's
effectiveness in getting across its mes

sages.
"What would be ideal,"she said."is
it the audience registered that they
could or could not relate to certain as
pects and reflected 011 why."
1 he ticket proceeds from the show

smaller drama groups ()ne such piece
is Stan Lai's "Sand on a Distant Star."
