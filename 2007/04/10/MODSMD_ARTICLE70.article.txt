I am not happy with a lot of things
at Stanford and want to change them.
The University makes us jump
through hoops to get anywhere and
when you think you're done they say
you 'forgot something' and say
'sorry.' There should be fewer restric
tions to organizing activities on cam
pus. a better Stanford website, a shut
tle to the S.IC and SFO airports, and
better use of the GCC for repeat
campus wide events... 1 endorse Fen
Zhao and Krishna Keating who are
dedicated to making this place better.
