As a candidate for the School of En
gineering Representative, I plan to
work with the Graduate Student
Council to make the graduate com
munity more aware of the resources
available to them at the university. I
also hope to increase contact be
tween students pursuing degrees in
different departments, fostering a
healthier academic and social at
mosphere. I already attend weekly
GSC meetings and am involved in
the Funding Committee as well as

helping to develop the New Gradu
ate Student Orientation. I look for
ward to working on the GSC and am
always open to suggestions 011 how
to improve graduate life at Stan
ford.
