If you could change only one thing over the
course of your tenure iu office, what would it
he, and why? We share students' frustrations
with the OSA. having served as Class Presi
dents and officers in various VSOs. The prob
lem is not any individual person — problem is
the policy, the problem is the fact that the OSA
is severely understaffed. We believe a compar
ative analysis of our peer institutions is the only
way to convince our administration to relax the
more arbitrary rules. In addition, we will place
an Executive Cabinet member in the OSA. He
or she will be the first person a student group
goes to when they want advice about how to
plan an event. When issues arise, this Cabinet
member will advocate on behalf of the student

group to ensure the event occurs.
Why are you qualified to hold this position?
We've held a variety of positions within the ASSU
as well in VSOs. Together, we've been Junior Gass
President, Sophomore Class President. ASSU Ex
ecutive Aide, and members of Class Executive Cab
inets, Frosh Council, Saheli, Stanford's South Asian
Women's Collective, Basmati Raas. Fleet Street.
Ram's Head, Queer/Straight Alliance, and the
Stanford Democrats. We have been very successful
in these endeavors, as evidenced by our campaign to
spread cultural awareness of diverse winter holidays
through the Sophomore Cabinet, and our revival of
the Mausoleum Party this fall, with the current Ex
ecutive, through the Junior Cabinet.

What sets you apart from the other slates? We
are leaders. If we win, we will work with the Senate,
hut we will not he just an extension of the Senate.
Our experience in the ASSU has focused on lead
ing our peers to reach tangible, visible results. We
have a concrete set of measurable goals like throw
ing a Stanford Pix>l Party, securing 24-hour study
space in Old Union, and splitting up the two pre
ferred years of the draw to ensure th;it no one gets
screwed both years. We are also concerned with
LGBT and women's issues. We sat on the Sexual
Violence Advisory Board and we want to more
proactively include the LGBT community in the
Graduate and Faculty diversity discussion. All the
slates have similar goals and a lot of them. It's going
to come down to who can outline specific ways of

reaching these goals and motivate the ASSU to ac
complish these goals. People will want to work with
us because we are passionate, efficient, and will
keep things fun. We take this position very serious
ly. but we do not take ourselves too seriously.
