# SUBMIT
## Anthony Scodary '08 and Annie Wyman '08 
### 
If you could change only one thing over the course of
your tenure in office, what would it be, and why? Stanford
University is one of the most fiscally bloated in this country.
We think it only just that each Stanford student be provid
ed the opportunity to siphon off a little of this precious lipid
for themselves.
It's about profit. It's about a mutually beneficial rela
tionship between students and university in which incredi
ble sums of money are exchanged. To ensure that the stu
dents, the University itself, and ourselves come out of 2007-
2(X)8 with our wallets bulging, we've decided we ought to
step in. We want to reiterate: we don't need Stanford. Stan
ford needs us.
Why are you (|iialified to hold this position? Curious
about our qualifications? How does leadership sound?
We've got it. Success? You bet. Nearly unlimited personal
resources? Absolutely. Wyman wrote in her bestselling
books on success and money that in Nature there are two
types of people: the winners and the weak. ()ur opponents
are weak; they are narcissistic, afraid, and powerless. We on
the other hand are winners. When we wish to conquer
something, it's as good as got a flag planted in it. Scodary is
one of America's most cutthroat and successful business
men. called by some a success machine.
What sets you apart from the other slates? Take a look
around this insert. You may notice, among the vacant faces,
a number of promises — perhaps even dozens and dozens
and dozens of promises. We have only one promise — for

every promise the other candidates make, we promise to
make the same promise and many others. If the promise is
something numerical, we'll double it if it's good and halve
it if it's had. You may wonder how our opponents could
possibly top this platform. The answer is that they simply
cannot.
Look, we know every Stanford student has his or her
own desires and needs, and we just want you to know, we
will promise to fulfill them. If every student's desires were
a dart board, and our promises darts, we guarantee we'd
not only get a bulls eye each time, but we'd also get him a
better dartboard. We invite each and every student to
send us a personal email describing his or her own deep
est desires (preferably fiscal) at ajwyman@stanford.edu
and/or scodary@stanford.edu. Need a new room? We'll
build you a new dorm. Need a new bike? We'll get you a
boat.
We promise to promise to make something happen.
Submit will hold a press conference at the claw Tuesday
at noon and welcome all interested parties to attend.
