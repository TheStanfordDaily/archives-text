If von could change only one thing
over the course of your tenure in office,
what would it be, and whv?The
ASSIJ is a self-serving organization.
What have they done for (he students?
They have played the fiddle while their
precious institution perishes in flames.
The sacred rights of the student have
been taken away. The OSA. the
ASSU. and the Administration have
all ensured that we remain in infancy.
I"hey hold our hands, and claim they
are protecting the student. That is a lie,
in their pursuit of "protecting us from
ourselves," they have instead de
stroyed our liberty. What they have be
come is an institution of self-serving
bureaucrats more concerned with pro
tecting themselves from the supposed
ly litigious members of the community
which send their children to "daycare."
for four years until they are ready to be
sent out into the real world, a real world
of desk slavery and status quo. We are
not a university of children.
The OSA has done everything they
can to maintain your infancy, and the
ASSU's resume-padders have done
nothing to stop them. Self-serving bu
reaucrats don't know you. they don't
care; you are just a statistic. They see
jello parties as a liability when they

should learn to trust us. They strictly
enforce "social budgets" because they
see it as a means to enforce temper
ance. This drives drinking under
ground, and creates an even more un
stable environment, but one in which
the pseudocrats can be absolved of all
responsibility if a student dies, it's not
their fault. Meanwhile John Arillaga
buys another piece of Stanford prop
erty. and the University sells another
parcel of its dignity. How long will it
be until we see the John C. Arillaga
Stanford Mausoleum Center?
The Warm Weather Party will stop
the OSA from destroying our inde
pendence: we will stop them from
keeping us in immaturity. We will stop
the ASSU from their nepotism, and if
we have to we will dissolve the senate.
We will not allow freedom to be de
ported. Stanford's motto is "The wind
of freedom blows." and at Stanford,
the wind of freedom, blows. The
pseudocrats of the OSA. the re
sumepadders of the ASSU, and the
paper pushers of the Administration
are to blame. The pseudocrats who
saw fit to remove our flyers and threat
ened us with disqualification are
scared of what we can accomplish, and
they should be. Vote Warm Weather.
