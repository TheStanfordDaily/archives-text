Day In The Life

April 10,1930:

U.C. does not favor idea of Axe as
trophy
A week after the "Immortal 21" re
gained the Axe for Stanford, the presi
dent of the California student body sent
a telegram to the ASSU president stat
ing that California would not favor
"making the axe a Big Game trophy,
even if Stanford should decide to make
it one."
John A. Reynolds' telegram read:
"Contrary to the sentiment expressed in
the Stanford Daily and elsewhere, he
students of the University of California
do not now and never will favor making
the axe a Big Game trophy. If Stanford
does not dare to display the axe at a rally
as we have, we feel sure that there will be
left enough men at California to go and
get it."
In 1933. Stanford and UC-Berkeley
signed an agreement making the Axe
the official trophy of Big Game.
