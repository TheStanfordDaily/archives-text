Increasingly, society has been questioning the systems and methods used to develop, approve, distribute,
and use drugs and other healthcare products. Specific focus on the pharmaceutical industry has led to the
revelation that this process generates many ethical issues ranging from the types of drugs that should be
developed, the conflicts of interest inherent in pharmaceutical industry-academic relationships, the rights
