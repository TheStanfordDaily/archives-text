## Defense hopeful prosecutors could announce decision in Duke lacrosse rape case this week 
### 
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - The three men indicted in the Duke
lacrosse sexual assault case could learn this week whether
state prosecutors plan to bring them to trial or drop the
charges, a person close to the case said Tuesday.
ITie attorney general's office, which has said for several
weeks it was close to completing its investigation since taking
the case from the district attorney, has wrapped up addition
al interviews, said the person, who spoke to The Associated
Press on a condition of anonymity because a formal an
nouncement has not been made.
A spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office
said Tuesday no announcement in the case was scheduled. No
motions or court papers were filed in the case on Tuesday.
"There is some hope that there might be an answer from
the attorney general this week at some point," said defense
attorney Wade Smith, who represents player Collin Finnerty.
Finnerty. Reade Seligmann and David Evans were indict
ed on charges of rape, kidnapping and sexual offense last
spring after a woman told police she was assaulted at a March
2(X)6 team party where she was hired to perform as a stripper.
All three have steadfastly maintained their innocence, with
Evans calling the allegations "fantastic lies."
Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong dropped
the rape charges in December after the accuser changed a
key detail in her story, and recused himself a few weeks later
after the state bar charged him with several ethics violations
tied to his handling of the case. If convicted. Nifong could be
disbarred.
