The Board of Trustees, re
versing its past position, voted
yesterday to support a share
holder resolution which
would force a major US hank
to halt new loans and renewal
of old loans to the apartheid
regime in South Africa.
The action came at the
board meeting in Los Angeles

following a recommendation
from the University Commit
tee on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR). The vote was
unanimous.
Trustees postponed action
on a similar proposal before
the Bank America Corpora
tion, electing to wait until the
CIR acted on an additional
proposal dealing with loans to
communist bloc countries.
