## Students honor Fraga 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Students and supporters of Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga — who announced in
December that he would leave for the Uni
versity of Washington after the current aca
demic year — have organized a May 4 trib
ute to honor the beloved professor for the
role he played as a mentor, teacher and
friend.
"The tribute will be an event with per
formances, speakers and food to honor Pro
fessor Fraga and his contributions to cam
pus," said Melissa Morales '09, one of the
students helping to organize the event."It is
going to be celebratory."
"The film will show lots of really nice
things but we wanted Professor Fraga to
have something tangible to take with him,"
she added.
A video containing clips of faculty, stu
dents, staff and alumni talking about their
experiences with Fraga will be shown at the
tribute.Talisman. Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford and Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford
will also be performing.
Fraga will also receive a reflection book
— which will be a collection of letters and
photographs submitted by faculty, students,
staff and alumni expressing their memories
and thanks — at the tribute.
"We have received some wonderful let
ters people have written about how much
Luis Fraga has impacted their professional
and personal life, not just their academic
life," said Claudia Aranda '99, one of the
major organizers of the tribute and the
book. "It has been a continued outpouring
of support."
Aranda could not estimate the number
of submissions she will receive, because they
are still coming in and will be accepted until
midnight tomorrow.
A summer fellowship, for which
fundraising is currently underway, is also
being set up to honor Fraga.The Haas Cen

a summer working on institutional change
at a non-profit, private or governmental or
ganization. Aranda said that the goal is to
obtain funding for the first of three annual
fellowships by this summer.
"We want to honor what Fraga taught us
about the power of grassroots organiza
tions," Aranda said. "We are hoping that
everyone in the community will donate [to
the fellowship fund] in that spirit. We don't
want the money to come from just a few
people; it is a chance for students to show
their support."
Morales said she got involved in the trib
ute after she participated in last fall's pro
tracted effort to keep Fraga at the Universi
ty-
"l didn't know Professor Fraga before
last fall but was interested in the campaign
because everyone has heard him speak
within the Latino community," she said."He
is the go-to for faculty support and the idea
of losing that."
All members of the Stanford community
are welcome to participate in the tribute
and fundraising efforts. Reflection book
submissions can be sent to
fragabook@gmail.com until tomorrow's
deadline. Everyone who submits a response
is welcome to the tribute next month, for
which the RSVP deadline is Apr. 20.
