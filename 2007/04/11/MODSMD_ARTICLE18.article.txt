## Senate plans vote on Mideast divestment 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate moved a step closer to vot
ing on the controversial Israel di
vestment bill that members first
discussed during winter quarter at
its meeting last night.
Senator Nabill Idrisi () l ). who
authored the proposal, told his
peers that he made several changes
to the first version of the bill to re
flect their concerns and those of
other students. Barring a motion to
table it, the Senate will vote on the
issue at next week's meeting.
"The main change is that its not
immediately calling for divestment,
but instead suggests following an
established protocol of reevaluat
ing investments in areas that cause
'substantial social injuries. " Idrisi
said, referring to Stanford's State
ment on Investment Responsibili
ty, which dictates that the Board of
Trustees should consider divest
ment from companies whose "ac
tivities or policies cause substantial
social injury."
"The blame [for human rights
abuses] is not placed on Israel as a
state." Idrisi added. "Rather, [the
bill] is suggesting that it's only
these particular Israeli govern
ment policies that are causing
human 1 ights violations."
Idrisi also cites Amnesty Inter
national's statement that Palestin
ian human rights are violated by
"closures, curfews and demolitions
of homes as a form of collective
punishment" in his proposal.
The bill asks the Board of
Trustees to "reevaluate invest
ments in companies that violate in
ternational law and abuse human
rights in Israel and Palestine" in
five ways, which range from com
panies deemed to be "enabling

militant organizations to carry out
attacks on civilians" to those "en
gaging in practices that institution
ally discriminate against people of
a specific race, religion or ethnici
ty."
The revisions also recommend
divesting from companies that sup
port the "building or maintenance
[of the] separation barrier current
ly being built in the West Bank";
companies that "facilitate home
demolition, land confiscation or
other acts of collective punish
ment": and companies that "pro
vide military support and weapon
ry to facilitate operations (in) ille
gally occupied" territories.
Idrisi's changes also attempted
to address concerns that the first
version of the bill was explicitly bi
ased because it did not acknowl
edge Palestinian responsibility for
the conflict in the Middle East.To
this end. Idrisi added a Human
Rights Watch statement which
read, "the Hamas-led Palestinian
authority needs to take immediate
steps to end attacks on civilians by
I lamas's own militant wing and
other armed groups."
While it encourages divestment
from Israel, the bill makes a point
of addressing the concerns of Jew
ish students on campus, stating
that, "divestment from abuses in a
particular country isn't meant to
alienate or offend students with
strong religious or ethnic ties to
that country."
The Senate also approved
changes to the judicial charter that
will broaden the jurisdiction of the
Board on Judicial Affairs in sexual
assault cases and extend the time
window for victims to report an of
fense.
