# Freshman living the dream
## Senate candidate becomes overnight celebrity after You Tube video jump-starts campaign 
### DAN NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Three freshmen: One breathes fire, another is a
seven-foot basketball sensation. Hut the third
freshman, ASSU Senate candidate Eugene Nho.
recently stole the headlines with a one-of-a-kind
campaign video.
Its humor and overall production quality puts
ASSU executive candidates' efforts to shame. Just
ask outgoing ASSU executive Elizabeth Heng'o7.
She's never met Nho in her life, but sent him a con
gratulatory message on Facebook.
The video, a parody of the trailer for the movie
"300,"opens with Nho declaring his candidacy and
vowing to fight for student rights. Knights then bat
tic and race on horseback toward Hoover Tower,
only for Nho to dodge their arrows in a Matrix
style slow motion shot.
The video's high point comes moments later.
"I want to make Stanford a more active campus
by breaking down bureaucratic barriers," says
Nho. his face occupying the entire screen. "Those
rules and regulations of OS A [Office of Student
Activities] hinder student activities."
Finally, the editing of fellow freshman Alan
Ransil — who doubles as a fire-breathing magi
cian in his spare time — cuts to the actual trailer.
"This is necessary," a knight bellows.
"Necessary?" screams Nho."This is Stanford!"
A swift kick to the midsection knocks the
knight into a gaping hole.
"It's a short sentence but encompasses the idea
that the OSA shouldn't be a problem at Stanford
and we need to fix it," Nho said in an interview with
The Daily." It has a double meaning. It shouldn't be
an excuse — students are entitled to better servic
es."
Nho then quickly runs through his platform,
capped by his rejoinder to a knight's scream of
"Tonight, we dine in hell!"
"Next year, my dining plan will fix this." he

promises.
ITie 77-second video ends with a
cameo appearance from Nho's room
mate, freshman basketball standout
Brook Lopez: He's Brook Lopez,
and. with a smile and a thumbs-up. he
approves this message.
Ransil and Nho filmed the video
in 15 minutes in the middle of Lake
Lagunita at sunset on Sunday. A blue
bedsheet tied between bedframes
served as the background, allowing
Ransil to splice in the actual trailer.
"He ran into my room at 5 p.m.,"
said Ransil, who has been making
movies since eighth grade and spent
10 hours editing Nho's film. "1 was
doing physics homework, but 1 love
making movies, so I dropped every
thing until 2 in the morning."
The video can be seen at

gene Nho on Facebook or YouTUbe.
It had been viewed 875 times at press
time.
Nho, who hails from South Korea,
was originally hesitant about the idea,
saying he did not want the student
body to view his candidacy as a joke.
But. as the video has become increas
ingly popular, he has learned to em
brace it.
"I was worried people thought I
was light." he said."l 'm not really like
that; I have a serious platform and
ideas. But, I do also have a funny
video."
