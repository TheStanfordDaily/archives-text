## OSA dominates Exec. campaign Candidates debate tactics while University pledges improvement 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Several ASSU Executive slates have made re
vamping the Office of Student Activities (OSA) a
top issue in their campaign platforms. At public ap
pearances, some candidates have said they'll play
hard ball with the administrators in the office re
sponsible for the Row, party planning and Univer
sity-sponsored social events. Others say they will
work to make long-term reforms in the party-plan
ning process, and at least one slate has called on the
University to hire more staffers for OSA.
University officials say they are committed to
making the office managed by Nanci Howe work
for students, that they value input from candidates
and that there is an effort already underway to im
prove the OSA.
Hershey Avula 'OS and Mondaire Jones '09 said
it was one of their "top five" priorities, equating
OSA reform with Old Union development, reduc
ing student costs and academic initiatives like
Course Guide.
"We want to immediately establish an OSA pol
icy revision board with student members from the
[Inter-fraternity Council and) from regular student
groups to discuss why these policies are in place,"
Avula said. "A lot of the policies are
arcane and OSA officials themselves
will admit,'l don't really know why
the policy is there, it has some validi
ty. so we keep it.' But that's not good
enough."
Aaron Smith '08 and Kyle
Ladewig '08 made a similar sugges
tion, saying they would promote a
quarterly review in which the ASSU
Executives talk with OSA.
Lakshmi Karra 08, ASSU Vice Pres
idential candidate running with Brett
Hammon 08, championed the idea of
having a student representative work
with the OSA.
"[Our] vision for next year in

terms of the OSA," she said, "is we
have a cabinet, we have a healthy
budget, we want to put one of our
cabinet members in the OSA and
have them be the student voice in the
OSA."
"|We need to do] a comparative
analysis with other peer institutions
because that's really the only effec
tive way to get Stanford administra
tion to change anything," Mammon
added. "Looking at Harvard, Prince
ton. Yale, they all have shorter [party]
notification periods. It's like four
days or six days. None of them said
you can't mention alcohol in the
name of the flyer, which ours does.
Harvard's not falling apart."
Powers said that OSA wants to ad
dress concerns like Mammon's.
"The Dean of Students Office is in
the beginning stages of a strategic
planning effort that will involve look

ing at all aspects of what we do in
every department, and that would in
clude OSA," said Dean of Students
Maureen Powers. "The various de
partment heads in those areas are
going to be involved deeply in ana
lyzing how everything is happening
in their department.
"It's very possible that other insti
tutions have more sophisticated tech
nology that they can use in process
ing the kinds of requests you are talk
ing about," she said. "We have not at
this point been able to develop and
provide a truly sophisticated system.
That's something that Nanci I lowe
has been interested in having — for
example, if we were able to have a
planning process that was done com
pletely online."
Powers said that the evaluations
will include focus groups — reflect
ing the ideas of a number of this

year's campaign platforms.
"We'll be doing a variety of out
reach efforts that will include focus
groups." Powers said. "We'll be look
ing at every one of the departments
in the Dean of Students areas. We'll
be asking for students to give us all of
their feedback."
Iliis revision process falls in line with
a number of changes suggested by
potential ASSU Executives.
Powers declined to comment on
whether or not the OSA will adopt
any of the other revisions suggested
in campaign proposals, and she said
she was optimistic about the poten
tial success of OSA's own review
process.
"I don't think I'm in a position to
comment on [whether their propos
als are feasible] but I myself and all of
the department heads are already ex
cited about this opportunity to get

input and feedback," she said. "I
think that one of the things that
comes out of a strategic plan is that
you are able to identify what are the
actual needs that exist."
Powers ducked questions about
whether or not some of the Executive
slates' proposed reforms such .is
the Big Game Bonfire, the Row
Block Party and a pool party at Avery
— were realistic, but she was quick to
say that student input is essential to
OSA's future success.
"What I can tell you is that I think
it's important to listen very carefully
to any suggestion that comes from
students," Powers said. "And then we
have to review with a careful eye to
make sure that we are addressing any
obvious concerns like how do we
manage the risk involved in a partic
ular suggestion, how do we manage
the security involved, how do we han

die the financing or the staffing?"
Still. Ladewig said that the ASSU
will have to work to make OSA's role
more transparent to the student body
a sentiment echoed by ASSU
Presidential candidate Brian Truebe
08. who is running with Folahan
(Mowoyeve "OK as part of "The Warm
Weather Party."
"You've got to increase the trans
parency of the organization," TYeube
said." I "heir entire organization takes
care of Greek Life, sporting events,
parties, everything. It's such a mega
lithic organization, that the left and
the right hand are fighting each other
as to what they do and because they
don't have specifically described
powers, they can go all over the
place."

Powers said that OSA wants to ad
dress concerns like Mammon's.
"The Dean of Students Office is in
the beginning stages of a strategic
planning effort that will involve look

ing at all aspects of what we do in
every department, and that would in
clude OSA," said Dean of Students
Maureen Powers. "The various de
partment heads in those areas are
going to be involved deeply in ana
lyzing how everything is happening
in their department.
"It's very possible that other insti
tutions have more sophisticated tech
nology that they can use in process
ing the kinds of requests you are talk
ing about," she said. "We have not at
this point been able to develop and
provide a truly sophisticated system.
That's something that Nanci I lowe
has been interested in having — for
example, if we were able to have a
planning process that was done com
pletely online."
Powers said that the evaluations
will include focus groups — reflect
ing the ideas of a number of this

year's campaign platforms.
"We'll be doing a variety of out
reach efforts that will include focus
groups." Powers said. "We'll be look
ing at every one of the departments
in the Dean of Students areas. We'll
be asking for students to give us all of
their feedback."
Iliis revision process falls in line with
a number of changes suggested by
potential ASSU Executives.
Powers declined to comment on
whether or not the OSA will adopt
any of the other revisions suggested
in campaign proposals, and she said
she was optimistic about the poten
tial success of OSA's own review
process.
"I don't think I'm in a position to
comment on [whether their propos
als are feasible] but I myself and all of
the department heads are already ex
cited about this opportunity to get

input and feedback," she said. "I
think that one of the things that
comes out of a strategic plan is that
you are able to identify what are the
actual needs that exist."
Powers ducked questions about
whether or not some of the Executive
slates' proposed reforms such .is
the Big Game Bonfire, the Row
Block Party and a pool party at Avery
— were realistic, but she was quick to
say that student input is essential to
OSA's future success.
"What I can tell you is that I think
it's important to listen very carefully
to any suggestion that comes from
students," Powers said. "And then we
have to review with a careful eye to
make sure that we are addressing any
obvious concerns like how do we
manage the risk involved in a partic
ular suggestion, how do we manage
the security involved, how do we han

die the financing or the staffing?"
Still. Ladewig said that the ASSU
will have to work to make OSA's role
more transparent to the student body
a sentiment echoed by ASSU
Presidential candidate Brian Truebe
08. who is running with Folahan
(Mowoyeve "OK as part of "The Warm
Weather Party."
"You've got to increase the trans
parency of the organization," TYeube
said." I "heir entire organization takes
care of Greek Life, sporting events,
parties, everything. It's such a mega
lithic organization, that the left and
the right hand are fighting each other
as to what they do and because they
don't have specifically described
powers, they can go all over the
place."
