# STUDENT GOV'T
## OSA dominates Exec. campaign Candidates debate tactics while University pledges improvement 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Several ASSU Executive slates have made re
vamping the Office of Student Activities (OSA) a
top issue in their campaign platforms. At public ap
pearances, some candidates have said they'll play
hard ball with the administrators in the office re
sponsible for the Row, party planning and Univer
sity-sponsored social events. Others say they will
work to make long-term reforms in the party-plan
ning process, and at least one slate has called on the
University to hire more staffers for OSA.
University officials say they are committed to
making the office managed by Nanci Howe work
for students, that they value input from candidates
and that there is an effort already underway to im
prove the OSA.
Hershey Avula 'OS and Mondaire Jones '09 said
it was one of their "top five" priorities, equating
OSA reform with Old Union development, reduc
ing student costs and academic initiatives like
Course Guide.
"We want to immediately establish an OSA pol
icy revision board with student members from the
[Inter-fraternity Council and) from regular student
groups to discuss why these policies are in place,"
