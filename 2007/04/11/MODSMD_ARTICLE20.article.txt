## Editorial Board Reject Measure A 
### 
With all the glad handing and flyer
ing of the past week, the focus has
been largely on the executive slate
and senate candidates. Easily overlooked is
Measure A. a garbled and confusing ballot
initiative that could undermine the free
campus press if passed.
The leader of the Undergraduate Sen
ate's Administration & Rules Committee,
Danny Arbeiter '08, has said that "at most,
this change would affect one group per
year." That group is The Stanford Daily.
Cloaked in the technical legalese of an
amendment which purports to fix spelling
errors ["Some portions of the Constitution
were written before spell check," the ASSU
Web site says|. Measure A would give grad
uate student voters disproportionate say on
special fees measures. It would effectively
allow a few people on the GSC Appropria
tions committee to block The Daily's re
quest for needed special fees money every
year.
The bill would raise the bar for passage
on joint special fees requests, requiring 50

percent of both undergrad and grad voters.
Currently a majority of all students must
support the request for it to he granted. The
change would mean that a majority of both
the graduate and undergraduate voting
populations must support a joint special
fees initiative for it to secure passage.
The Daily consistently receives strong
majority support from voters. Our newspa
per, written and edited by dedicated stu
dents. provides a valuable service to the en
tire University. This change could mean in
creased special fees requests from under
grade Students are well within their rights
to request refunds on what amounts to a
small subscription fee.
Every student vote should be counted
equally; graduate student votes should not
carry disproportionate weight. If the stu
dent body is overwhelmingly in favor of a
measure, then the majority should carry the
day.
The Daily urges a No vote on the stealth
attack that is Measure A and a yes vote on
its special fees request.
