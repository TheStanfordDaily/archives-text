# The 						coolest kids on campus
## 
### 
Oh glorious day! We are on the verge
of a truly momentous occasion,
lonight, as you lay your head upon
the pillow, history will be made behind the
mahogany doors of a well-furnished chalet.
rhere will be a celebration, complete
with wine,cheese and a nice, healthy serving
of arrogance. Glasses will clink as the air fills
with the sounds of self-congratulatory bom
bast. Hie ball will admit UK) lucky people,
with a guest list that has been carefully
combed through. And everyone there will be
a VIP.
What is this event, pray tell? Hie guests
to tonight's cotillion are the 100 hottest
members of our student body, the 100 most
sculpted, aesthetically beautiful creatures
that our campus has to offer. They have
gone through a rigorous screening, and now
is their time to shine. Their 100 th member
has joined, and the group is complete.
Hie spotlight will fall on each of them in
turn, and for that instant illuminate their
perfectly symmetrical features, their envi
able externality.
And those of us outside in the courtyard,
our faces pressed to the window, fogging the
glass of the chalet's wall-length casement
with our unclean breath, will have no re
course but to look on, our revolting appear
ances only highlighted by the contrast with
the beauties within."lf only!" we will say."lf
only we could somehow find a way in, and
prove to ourselves that we are beautiful!"
But nay.Try as we might, we are the great
unwashed. The undeniable Standard has de

clared that there is one beauty, and we do
not fit the bill.
"Look at our badges!" they will trumpet.
Our eyes will turn to a pin on their lapels:
ITie 100 Absolute Hottest People on Face
book." Underneath, some of the guests have
more insignia, sewn into the fabric of their
expensive suits: "Facebook's HOTTEST
men! and"I just tried to ford the river and
my fucking oxen died."
ITiey are the well-decorated veterans of
an everlasting struggle for aesthetic superi
ority.
You know what this really means: The
most ridiculous people on campus have fi
nally found their friends. And now. there are
100 of them. The 100 most superficial, shal
low. and generic prototypes to own a Stan
ford Facebook account have been armed
with a community of like-minded individu
als. And the results are disastrous.
Hie group bills itself as a community with
the purpose of celebrating the "physical

beauty, intelligence, humanity and
charisma," of "select Stanford stu
dents." With the goal of "contributing
positively to a progressive sense of
beauty," (a phrase apparently taken
from someone's college application),
the group hopes to smash traditional
notions of attractiveness by admit
ting a diverse, multifaceted and exot
ic team 0f...
... blond-haired, blue-eyed white
kids mostly from California.
"Now now," you might say, "cer
tainly, the officers for the group rep

resent a diverse notion of beauty!
Look: there's a black guy or two. And
an Asian one!" Indeed, striking.
Until you note that there are only
three African Americans in the
group at all.
East Asians make a slightly better
showing, with a full five of them, and
South Asians constitute roughly
three themselves.There are two peo
ple of likely Hispanic origin.
But wait. Wait. Our University is
only 40% Caucasian. Why are 87%
of these people White? For that mat
ter, why are most of the girls wearing
bathing suits, and most of the guys
wearing pink shirts/polos, and hold
ing alcoholic beverages?
Whoa there, partner. Maybe I'm
being a bit too critical. After all.

these people are Hawt Stuff! Per
haps I'm just speaking out of envy.
Come to think of it. I'm only bitter
because I can't fit the shallow and
generic stereotype of beauty es
poused by these well-proportioned
paragons of physical excellence.
In the end, Facebook's 100
Hottest, continue to celebrate in
your chalet, as we the great ugly
masses look on. Give yourselves a
great big pat on the back, realizing
that you are better than all of us.
You've earned it.

Nat is deeply saddened that he isn't one
of Facebook's hottest. You can entail

the reply will he laden with self-depre
cating sadness.
