						coolest kids on campus

### 
Oh glorious day! We are on the verge
of a truly momentous occasion,
lonight, as you lay your head upon
the pillow, history will be made behind the
mahogany doors of a well-furnished chalet.
rhere will be a celebration, complete
with wine,cheese and a nice, healthy serving
of arrogance. Glasses will clink as the air fills
with the sounds of self-congratulatory bom
bast. Hie ball will admit UK) lucky people,
with a guest list that has been carefully
combed through. And everyone there will be
a VIP.
What is this event, pray tell? Hie guests
to tonight's cotillion are the 100 hottest
members of our student body, the 100 most

not fit the bill.
"Look at our badges!" they will trumpet.
Our eyes will turn to a pin on their lapels:

book." Underneath, some of the guests have
more insignia, sewn into the fabric of their
expensive suits: "Facebook's HOTTEST
men! and"I just tried to ford the river and
my fucking oxen died."
ITiey are the well-decorated veterans of
an everlasting struggle for aesthetic superi
ority.
You know what this really means: The
most ridiculous people on campus have fi
nally found their friends. And now. there are
100 of them. The 100 most superficial, shal
low. and generic prototypes to own a Stan
ford Facebook account have been armed
with a community of like-minded individu

Hie group bills itself as a community with
