# K@ for Sen@e

### 
It is one of my favorite Stanfordian ironies
that the year's two most despised seasons
occur simultaneously: ASSU elections
and the massive onslaught of caterpillar
bombardiers. Nothing gives me greater joy
than watching those slimy, evasive little
beasts crawling all over the White Plaza
propaganda distributed by ... well, people
who could answer to a similar description.
Okay, maybe my symbolism is a little
crass, but it's got nothing on some of these
aspiring senators' campaign slogans. Al
though I won't bore you with specific ex
aamples (the extra "a" is for "atrocious"),
suffice it to say that when forty-something
students are running for only fifteen spots,
the most important plan of attack is coming
up with a catchphrase that will stick. And if
it manages to do so only from the staggering
quality of its sheer ineptitude, look, there's
no such thing as had publicity, am I right?
Just jam your name into a cringing little
rhyme and you're off to the races!
Still. 1 can t help but to wonder how well
these charming witticisms would go over in
a real election, like the kind we sometimes
have in America.
"Abraham L: the 'Line' between vou and
the ASSU!"
"Hisen-how-are we ever going to clean
up the Senate? With Ike!"
"A Hush in the office is worth two birds in
the hand. (Admittedly that one is a bit non
sensical, but if he gave away free candy in
White Plaza, I'd probably vote for him any
way.)
Unfortunately (or not. perhaps) these lit
tle snippets are frequently all we know
about the candidates. While a few go to the
trouble of copying their entire platforms in
eight-point font on each of their thousands
of flyers, most opt for simplicity, leaving
dorm bulletin boards ablaze with enough
"Vote 4 me"sand unnaturally rapturous
headshots to last a semi-illiterate lifetime.
In the past, lack of visible platforms has

never stopped me from committing arbi
trary acts of democracy: 1 just use the tried
and true method of voting for people I
know, everyone who lived in my freshman
dorm and that guy who transferred out of
my PWR class after two lectures last year.
However, glancing at The Daily's Election
Guide today I realized that I. as a junior, no
longer know the type of person who runs for
ASSI I senate. While this marks the greatest
appreciable upswing in my social value since
I stopped wearing stirrup pants with match
ing turtlenecks in the fifth grade, it did leave
me in a bit of a pickle: how to choose?
Dejected, I was forced to turn to the plat
forms.
Oh. the platforms. If you have spent any
traction of the past week on Facebook. in
White Plaza or enjoying regular digestion,
then you know that judging candidates by
their inspired and bizarre promises seems
ludicrous at best. Many of the campaign fly
ers show the type of slick-tongued. wily pre
dation I thought could only be cultivated in
incarcerated televangelists. Short of found
ing their own universities, I see no way some
of these candidates can achieve their goals:
increasing faculty diversity, building new
eateries on campus, increasing student at
tendance at non-basketball sports events?
Just promise me longer recess and finish the
job already, guys.
Other candidates stick to the "irresponsi
bly vague" technique of seducing prospective
