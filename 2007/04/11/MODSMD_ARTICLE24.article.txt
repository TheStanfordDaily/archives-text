# It's sad we don't consider being a SAHD
## 
### 
Imagine a job where you can work from
home, make your own hours and never
report to a superior. There are no inter
views or resumes required to apply. Stephen
Colbert calls the profession a threat to
America. Sociologists call it an example of
gender-nonconformity. 1 call it being a stay
at-home-dad. and it is my life-long dream.
Despite the negative press, stay-at-home
dads (SAHDs) have it all figured out. They
take on the role of raising the kids while their
wife brings home the bacon. They attend
PTA meetings, change diapers and cook din
ner. rhey also watch every sporting event
imaginable, take naps during the day and
read each morning paper cover-to-cover. I
realize many of you are skeptical that being a
SAHD is a real profession, so I will address
each one of your concerns below.
Isn t being a SAHD a waste of your college
degree?" Waste" is a strong word. I would say
"creative use." It's really about incorporating
what you learned into fatherhood. For exam
ple. 1 learned a little something about child
development and pediatric sports medicine.
While other little league coaches will be fum
bling around when their starting pitcher goes
down. I'll have my pitchers on such a great
physical therapy regimen their arms will look
like those of the kid from "Rookie of the
Year," without the horrible defect. 1 can al
ready see our trophy and after-game party at
Chuck-E-Cheese. lor the engineering ma
jors, you can use your skills to design the most
ergonomic, heaven-like rocking chair imagi
nable. If you think a major like international
relations is useless, think again. Your diplo

matic skills will he priceless when your hahy
girls hit puberty.
How can you afford to stay at home? A
very reasonable concern, but this ties back to
the importance of college. Sure, your actual
degree will be nothing more than an expen
sive coaster, but you will never encounter a
higher proportion of ambitious women
crammed into one place than here at Stan
ford. Over halt the girls in your class are
going to make six figures and have a fancy
title within a few years. Others will go to grad
school and be so successful that people will
call them "madam." It's a goldmine of SAHD
partner potential.
Of course, once you do find a suitable
mate (also known as "falling in love") fi
nances might be crunched when your wife
gets pregnant, leaving both parents jobless at
home. During this time I recommend finding
odd jobs to make ends meet. Selling crap on
e√üay, signing up for medical studies or join
ing Amway are three that come to mind.
Aren 't you going to he bored staving at
home all day ? Not when you have more hob
bies than a ten-year old. I will definitely need

to live by the ocean so I can surf and have a
garage where I can watch "The New Yankee
Workshop" on PBS and make cool furniture
with fancy tools. I'll sing lullabies on my gui
tar and take lots of pictures while practicing
my black-and-white photography skills.
Then there are the things 1 still want to learn:
chess, French and car mechanics. Hell,
maybe I'll even write a book. Another op
tion is to use your free time to "do good." If
all the SAHDs joined forces I'm confident
that world hunger. AIDS and cancer would
disappear in the next decade.
It you are still a skeptic, you probably are
too proud or insecure about your masculini
ty to ever be a SAHD. Sorry, dude, 1 didn't
know your penis was so large that is will actu
ally prevent you from loving and caring for
your family.
However, before you stop reading allow
me to paint a picture for you: Imagine a life of
after-school snacks (ants-on-a-log!), morn
ing surf sessions and little league champi
onships. A life where ballet recitals replace
business meetings and diapers are the only
currency. A life where you never wear a tie or
give a presentation, but you can go to bed
each night feeling satisfied and accom
plished.
No, that's not a fairytale. It's the life of a
SAHD.

Kevin realized lie might not have a wife or kids
within the next decade and is starting to panic.
Maybe he didn't think this one all the way
through. Email him advice at kpadrez@stan
