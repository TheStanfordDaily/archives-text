## Seek to understand the caterpillars 
### BEN GRAVES 
You say you hate the caterpillars, but
why? I am among the minority of people who
love the little critters, and here is why: Most
of the caterpillars swinging from the treetops
and latching onto your sweater are western
tussock moths, Orgyia vetusta — a common
critter native to the Californian oak wood
lands. They are part of a collection of species
that have evolved to live on the California
live-oak trees, which dominate the flora of
Stanford campus. These magnificent beings
prune the evergreens of their early foliage,
promoting the budding of acorns and form
ing the base of a thriving trophic pyramid.
For me they encapsulate the subtle beauty of
evolution and ecology. The oaks feed the
caterpillars, which support a diversity of
birds, arthropods and small mammals. These
myriad connections spin a fine web of life, es
sential for our survival and sanity.
As a senior, I feel many of my peers leave
this place armed with degrees, ready to "af

fect change" in government, business,schools
and hospitals, yet poorly grasping the funda
mentals of our natural system. In order to
prepare world leaders to face the challenges
of the 21st century, Stanford needs to pro
mote a framework of thinking about the en
vironment that students can take with them
wherever they end up.
Critical to the understanding of the natu
ral world is the idea of belonging to a place.
What does it mean to know a place? It begins
with questions like: What grows here? What
doesn't? Where does my food come from?
What about my water? Put simply, these are
essential questions that should be asked by
all citizens and are necessary for living a sus
tainable life.
David Orr, a prominent philosopher in
this field, writes that a University must pro
mote a "courtship between mind and nature"
by introducing the mysteries of a specific
place. We should be asking ourselves: Why
are there caterpillars? What do they eat?
What eats them? Why are there so many

"U/ 11 n ° W ' ' st u dent s arc exclaiming.
Why are they on my skin? Eeww gross!'
while tailing off their bikes dodging webs of
silk that are essentially the same as the sheets
they sleep on.The conversations I have heard
on campus the past few weeks have shown
that students are receiving degrees from a
world-class institution while maintaining a
befuddled ignorance of the natural world
around them.
So before you complain about the bugs,
t.ike off your headphones, go under an oak
tree and listen to what the little pre-moth
caterpillars are saying. "Slow down... Don't
reak my web.... Walk for a change... Admire
my agility, beauty and grace as I hang in thin
air, defying gravity." And instead of com
plaining. go seek out answers. Engage your
mind. Learn about your place and then help
someone else understand their own.
