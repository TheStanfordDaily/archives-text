## No more lives for Pacman 
### 
Hopefully, Adam "Pacman"
Jones of the Tennessee Titans
has saved money for a rainy
day. Because with NI L Commission
er Roger Goodell ruling yesterday
that Jones would he suspended for
the whole of the 2007 season, a real
storm is on the horizon for the trou
bled cornerback.
The commissioner's ruling, which
also handed down an eight-game
suspension for Cincinnati Bengals
wide receiver Chris Henry, is de
signed to put the current generation
of NFL delinquents in check. The
capstone league in the American
sports scene just took a big step to
wards deterring teams from signing
and drafting the trouble children of
the league — and a big step away
from these vilified athletes ever turn
ing their lives around.
Of course teams are going to pay
even more attention to character
concerns now that Goodell has
shown he means business. The rea
son teams pay talented, but troubled,
players millions of dollars each year
is because they believe they'll make
good on their investment. Talent


Griffin
Ranis and Raves
wins games, and wins translate to at
tendance, merchandise and a higher
profile within the league — all of
which translates to a healthier bot
tom-line for a franchise.
Like the rest of us, owners, gener
al managers and coaches don't need
the headaches. If the talent isn't
going to be allowed on the field,
more and more league decision
makers are likely to pass on possible
malcontents.
But has Goodell really considered
the cost of his actions? Sure, it would
be nice if every athlete was a solid cit
izen off the field, but theses punish
ments at the NFL level aren't going
to solve the moral issues that have
been a part of athletics for decades.
Plenty of athletes will still receive
money — or worse, receive it under
the table at college. And teams will
still rely chiefly on a player's produc
tion to determine his worth, as there
isn't any uniform way to measure
character. The players with poorer
backgrounds will still grow up in bad
neighborhoods,and still have possess
from the "bad crowd."
And, maybe most devastatingly
of all, the fans will be denied their
chief form of offseason entertain
ment.
To get back to Pacman's specific
case, let me recount those fateful
events that led to his year-long ban,
and perhaps, in part, to Cioodell's
new "tough-love" approach to play
er discipline. Back in February, dur
ing the NBAs All-Star Weekend in
Las Vegas, Jones and some friends
made their way to a strip club, where
Jones proceeded to "make it rain"
— literally throwing thousands of
dollars into the air. .
Then, things got interesting. It
seems that while Pacman was cool
throwing away money onto the
stage, he was not cool with the
dancers picking it up, and a scuffle
ensued during which three strippers
were shot. It's the kind of story that's
just so strange you have to hear it
again. This is the kind of stuff that
keeps a sport in the news. As ugly as

it sounds, sometimes any publicity is
good publicity.
It was the details of this particular
case that stood out. According to
some reports. $68.(XX) was recovered
by police after the incident, begging
the question of what happened to
the rest of it. Nobody goes into a
strip club with a random amount of
cash like that, which probably means
that $32,000 of Pacman's money was
never recovered. How much of that
stayed at the club with patrons and
employees and how much was con
fiscated by authorities, we'll proba
bly never know. It's not like Jones is
going to stand up and ask why they
didn't find all of the money he reck
lessly brawled over in one of the
most bizarre sports-related incidents
of the past decade.
I hate to trivialize the violence
that occurred in Sin City, but the
truth is it got people interested in the
NFL after the Super Bowl and be
fore free agency and the Draft, tradi
tionally the league's dead time. And
the punishment handed down by the
league isn't likely to help Pacman's
cause either — as now he'll have an
entire year to himself, away from his
team and free to get into all the trou
ble he can handle. If Jones' problem
was hanging with the wrong crowd,
pulling him away from his team
mates and coaches and letting him
stay home for an entire season
would hardly seem to be in his best
interest.
It's also important to note that
Goodell isn't punishing Jones for
crimes he's been convicted of, but
rather for accusations. Might Bud
Selig draw a lesson from this? With
Hammerin' Hank's home-run
record soon to fall to the much re
viled Barry Bonds, does Bud have
the new commish on the block to
thank for the precedent he needed
to ban the controversial Giants'
slugger without a trial?
It seems that $68,000 bought
more for Pacman than a night to re
member in Las Vegas. It may have
bought the whole of the sports world
a whole new outlook — innocent
until you've made headlines.
