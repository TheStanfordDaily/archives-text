## No more lives for Pacman 
### 
Hopefully, Adam "Pacman"
Jones of the Tennessee Titans
has saved money for a rainy
day. Because with NI L Commission
er Roger Goodell ruling yesterday
that Jones would he suspended for
the whole of the 2007 season, a real
storm is on the horizon for the trou
bled cornerback.
The commissioner's ruling, which
also handed down an eight-game
suspension for Cincinnati Bengals
wide receiver Chris Henry, is de
signed to put the current generation
of NFL delinquents in check. The
capstone league in the American
sports scene just took a big step to
wards deterring teams from signing
and drafting the trouble children of
the league â€” and a big step away
from these vilified athletes ever turn
ing their lives around.
Of course teams are going to pay
even more attention to character
concerns now that Goodell has
shown he means business. The rea
son teams pay talented, but troubled,
players millions of dollars each year
is because they believe they'll make
good on their investment. Talent
