# Lele Forood Tennis
## Player or coach, Forood just wins 
### BY JACK SALISBURY 
S Sometimes, all roads really do lead hack home. Stanford
women's tennis coach Lele Forood knows this. The *79
alumnus has coached the Cardinal since 2000. leading her
alma mater to the last three NCAA Championships. All
told, Stanford has won an astounding five national cham
pionships under Forood. the 2003 Inter-Collegiate Tennis Associa
tion Coach of the Year and two-time Pacific-10 Conference Coach
of the Year.
Fvcr humble, Forood attributes much of her success to Stan
ford's tennis tradition — and her players.
"I think that the kids who choose [Stanford] are not only very
talented, but they want to take on the responsibility of keeping this
program on the level of which it's always been," she said. "They ac
cept that responsibility."
Forood's journey to Stanford was rather circuitous, though. In
1977, the junior-to-be had to make a decision. Receiving no schol
arship, Forood needed money to pay lor school. Good enough to
compete at the professional level. Forood turned pro, foregoing
her athletic eligibility.
She returned to Stanford to complete her degree in Sociology
two years later, but would never again don a Cardinal uniform on
the court. After five years of professional tennis, including top-lb
finishes at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Forood called it quits
and became a tournament promoter in France.
Hut three years in France made Forood restless — she missed
home. So, she returned to the Bay Area in 1988. 112 ormer coach and
close friend Frank Brennan offered her a part-time assistant
coaching position at Stanford — and Forood would never be the
same.
"Three months turned into a year, and a year turned into 12

years," Forood said.
Sure enough, even though she had never planned to be a coach,
Forood enjoyed her time at Stanford from the start.
"1 decided that being around 18-to-21 -year-olds was kind of
lun." she said. "Helping them develop their tennis was something
I enjoyed doing. Certainly, working with Frank was also a lot of
fun."
Enjoying herself as she went
along, Forood found the transition
from tennis player to tournament
promoter to coach came rather easy.
"I had worked teaching tennis
since 1 was 15, so 1 was a very experi
enced instructor," she said.
When the legendary Brennan re
tired in 2000, there was no question
as to who would be his successor.
Forood was the logical replacement,
and she relished the opportunity.
it was a very easy, natural transi
tion," she said.*'lt was a very easy
and accommodating work situation.

and I enjoyed developing the play
ers. I'm not sure 1 could have ever
coached anywhere else. It was not
only a place 1 was familiar with, hut 1
understood what you had to do as a
student-athlete here."
One can argue whether Forood
has left a greater legacy as a player or
as a coach. In her two years playing
for Stanford, Forood held down the
No. 1 slot, reached the finals of the
singles national championships in
her freshman year and the singles
and doubles semifinals in her sopho
more year.
Though those days are long gone,
Forood couldn't be happier with her
current lot in life. To her, nothing is
better than being outside on a beau
tiful day, hitting balls and developing
players.
"I love coaching here," she said.

"There's a lot of freedom to it. Ihe
hours are what you make of it and
you certainly have your time avail
able to you in the summer. And. it's a
pretty nice lifestyle, being outside
every day."
Right now. Forood's main focus is
guiding the Cardinal to a fourth
straight national title.The stretch run
is right around the corner, and noth
ing would be sweeter than capturing
her sixth national championship and
Stanford's 16th.
Ultimately, though, whether or
not Stanford wins its fourth straight
title is irrelevant to determining
Forood's legacy. As a Cardinal play
er and coach, Forood's legacy is set in
stone.
