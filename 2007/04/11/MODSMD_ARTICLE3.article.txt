This year's application process
involved a survey sent out to Sen

Macarrin Morton '07. a SOCC
representative, the survey tested
both the applicants' knowledge

portant to SOCC, as well their
plans and qualifications for ad
dressing them.
"We wanted to see that they
represented the interests of the
organization, and asked ques
tions about their knowledge of
the community and their experi
ence," Morton said.
According to Morton, among
the issues specifically considered
by SOCC were the lack of diver
sity in the graduate student body
and university faculty; the high
cost of event hosting on campus;
and fair labor and trade.

experience. Executive slates were
asked then to apply that experi
ence with their "plans for further
progress on those issues."

lowed by interviews with a group
of more than 10 representatives
from the five groups under
SOCC: the Black Student Union
