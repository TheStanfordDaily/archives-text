# The 						process: how and why candidates received endorsements from SOCC, QSA and the Dems
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Three student group's leaders
spoke with The Daily about the
endorsement process ahead of
this week's ASSU elections. Al
though not comprehensive, these
are examples of the process can
didates follow to earn an en
dorsement.
Students of Color Coalition
The Students of Color Coali
tion (SOCC) endorsement is
among the most publicized in this
year's election. As Brett Mam
mon '08 of the Executive slate
Brett and Lakshmi put it, SOCC
is "the big one." SOCC did not en
dorse Brett and Lakshmi, but did
endorse its top competitor.
Avula/Jones, along with 13 sena
torial candidates out of the 22
who applied for endorsement.
This year's application process
involved a survey sent out to Sen
ate and Executive candidates by
the coalition. According to
Macarrin Morton '07. a SOCC
representative, the survey tested
both the applicants' knowledge

and awareness of the issues im
portant to SOCC, as well their
plans and qualifications for ad
dressing them.
"We wanted to see that they
represented the interests of the
organization, and asked ques
tions about their knowledge of
the community and their experi
ence," Morton said.
According to Morton, among
the issues specifically considered
by SOCC were the lack of diver
sity in the graduate student body
and university faculty; the high
cost of event hosting on campus;
and fair labor and trade.
In addition to identifying their
experience. Executive slates were
asked then to apply that experi
ence with their "plans for further
progress on those issues."
The questionnaire was fol
lowed by interviews with a group
of more than 10 representatives
from the five groups under
SOCC: the Black Student Union
(BSU), Muslim Student Aware
ness Network (MSAN),Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), Asian American Students
Association (AASA) and
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA). A consensus was
then reached by the core committee,
selecting candidates for endorse
ment.
"We selected the candidates who
best represented our needs as a
community in tackling the issues,"
Morton said.
Stanford Democrats
The Stanford Democrats also
considered both senators and Exec
utive slates, selecting six of 20 senate
applicants and neither of the Execu
tive slates that applied for endorse
ment.
Endorsement from the Democ
rats first required answering a ques
tionnaire sent out to all candidates.
A total of over 100 pages of respons
es detailing "experience and posi
tions on key issues" were received,
according to Bobby Lepore '07,
president of the group.
These were read by the Democ
rats' board, which consists of 22
members. Twelve of those members
then participated in a board meet
ing, where they questioned the 20
candidates who applied for an en
dorsement this year.
At the two-hour meeting, the two
Executive slate applicants (Brett
and Lakshmi and Avula/Jones) went
through a much more rigorous in
terview.
In his letter to The Daily, Lepore
described how the Democrats'
board, "looked first and foremost
for candidates that demonstrated a
thorough command of the issues
and promised concrete, realistic so
lutions to the challenges faced by
students and student organizations."
"It wasn't at all about figuring
out what candidates would push the
right buttons with us, that would say
the right things that appear to be on
the Democratic party line (however
that applies to the ASSU elec
tions)," Lepore added."lt was really
us taking a lot of time and effort to
get to know these candidates, to get
to know their experience, and to get
to know how they approach these is
sues and to see whether their cam
paign slogans were mostly just plati
tudes."
Queer Straight Alliance
The Queer Straight Alliance
(OSA) took a simpler approach to
the process: After conversation over
the issues,endorsements were either
approved or rejected.
According to QSA president
George Xander-Morris'oB, the most
important issue was whether a can
didate supported non-gender-based
housing. Xander-Morris said that
because the two Executive slates
(Brett and Lakshmi and
Avula/Jones) who approached the
group were similar, and both shared
a common view of promoting non
gender-based housing, it was "only
fair" to endorse both.
"From QSA's perspective, if ei
ther candidate won. it'd be in QSA's
best interest," Xander-Morris said.
"QSA didn't have any concerns
with anything else. TTiey had the
exact same platforms, literally —
not to criticize them, but they just
did."
