# Behind the Scenes Men's Gymnastics
## For gymnasts, practice makes perfect 
### BY DANNY BELCH 
When people think of rigorous
sports training, gymnastics
might not jump to mind. Exe
cuted properly, the sport
looks to he more about tech
nique than raw strength. According to the
Stanford men's gymnastics team, nothing
could he further from the truth. Hie Cardinal
trains intensely for hours and months on end
â€” all for about one minute of competition.
"Practices can last up to four hours." sen
ior Dylan Carney said. "We warm up and
stretch about 45 minutes [for injury preven
tion), and then generally there are three rota
tions of about 45 minutes each where we

work on basic technique and skills."
The athletes must strive for perfection
every day. Hie Cardinal men know that one
mistake could ruin a meet, a season or even a

career.
"When you are working on new skills, it
usually takes a long time to get the technique
down," Carney said. "Depending on what it
is. it may take thousands of repetitions just to
get to the point where you are doing some
thing that merely resembles what you're try
ing to do. I've spent years and years just
working on one particular move."
Junior Eli Alcaraz points out that other
athletes can take mental breaks in practice.
That's not so feasible when backflipping on a
balance beam.
"Your mental game must be at KM) percent
when you are actually doing gymnastics in
practice," he said. "Otherwise, there is seri-

ous potential for injury."
Practice itself is fundamentally
mental, according to Alcaraz.
"Once you are in good physical
shape or once you learn a particular
skill, then most of the work becomes
mental," he said. "Many factors go
into it. like trying to do your routine
facing a different direction, or with
people yelling at you or while visual
izing yourself at the venue you will
be competing at."
Still, the training is physically de
manding, and can take a harsh toll
on the body. Indeed, gymnasts seem
to get injured as frequently as Stan
ford students spot caterpillars, but
the team knows it can usually per
form through the pain.
"Injuries.in general,are extreme
ly prevalent," Carney said. "Our in
juries this year are pretty unfortu
nate, but we try not to let the small
ones affect us. It all depends on what
type of injury it is and what event
you are doing."
The squad has shaken off its fair
share of injuries: Sophomore Greg
Ter-Zakhariants so badly dislocated
his finger in a meet that it popped

through his skin, but was back train
ing less than two weeks later. In ad
dition. he broke his neck during a
competition, but still competed in
the meet before having surgery.The
list of injuries continues, including
broken backs, legs.and shoulders
that have sidelined some athletes for
the season.
Some injuries are so unimportant
to competition results that the gym
nasts don't even notice.
"We put our bodies in positions
that they were probably never
meant to be in," junior David
Sender said. "That's part of the
sport. I've always tried to convey to
the guys that injuries are 90 percent
in your head. If you are strong
enough mentally, you can work
through just about anything. All
gymnasts are constantly battling
some sort of injury."
The Cardinal men have done a
pretty good job of working through
their injuries this year. Despite
being undermanned in events
throughout the year, the team has
still pulled together high scores and
quality wins, leading to its current
No. 4 ranking.
Beside the difficulties of training,
another little-known fact about
gymnastics is how the athletes de
velop their muscularity.
The team does not train in the

weight room and does not lift any
dumbbells. Instead, the Cardinal
men strengthen themselves
through hours on the rings, bars or
pommel horse, throwing around
their body weight, lifting and spin
ning it in different directions while
maintaining a strong core.
"Lifting weights isn't really nec
essary when you spend four hours a
day throwing your own body
weight around," senior Peter Her
man said. "Most of our strength
comes from our event-specific ac
tivities. In fact, weight training
builds a lot of mass, which can actu
ally hurt us because it weighs us
down."
Gymnastics has more than its
share of mental and physical strain,
but the difficulty does not hinder
the work ethic of the team. No mat
ter the hours or pain involved, the
squad said it works as hard as it can,
focusing on perfecting and improv
ing its routines.
"1 love this sport," Sender said.
"I get to go into the gym every day.
thinking to myself,' How can 1 push
myself just a little bit further?'
That's what makes this sport great.
That's what sets us apart from
everyone else."
