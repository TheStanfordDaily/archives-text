# Candidates vie for endorsements
## SOCC is case study for how system works 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
As students begin to fill out
their online ASSU election bal
lots, many think back to the flyers
or Web sites they've glanced at —
and the endorsements that often
accompany them.
In an election where many stu
dents are apathetic or see little
difference between candidates
who make similar promises, en
dorsements can make the differ
ence. But with groups and indi
viduals making private decisions
to publicly support candidates
and slates, students are largely
unaware of the process leading to
endorsements, making them con
fusing and sometimes controver
sial.
Candidates, current senators
and group leaders illuminated
the decision-making process in
more than a dozen interviews
with The Daily this week.
Different groups have differ
ent mechanisms for picking can
didates. The Stanford Democrats
use a questionnaire, followed by
an interview. Groups like the
Queer Straight Alliance (QSA)
are willing to endorse multiple

candidates for the same post if
they agree with the group on is
sues of fundamental importance.
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), like the Democrats,
sends out a questionnaire and
then holds a rigorous interview,
followed by a consensus decision
from representatives of the five
groups included in the coalition.
Despite the finality of these
endorsement decisions, some
question the processes and valid
ity of various endorsements.
SOCC's decision to endorse
Avula/Jones shines light on the
process that unfolds in private
every year.
On a campus where diversity
is widely embraced, the two
front-running slates (Brett and
Lakshmi and Avula/Jones) both
stressed plans for improving the
representation of minorities.
Mondaire Jones '09 has been
involved with the University's
Black Student Union and the
N A ACP since he arrived on cam
pus. Both Jones and running mate
Hershey Avula '08 — who are
both ASSU senators — say they
have helped to author and pro
mote resolutions in the Senate
supporting diversity.
Both Brett Hammon '08 and
Lakshmi Karra '08 have served
on class executive committees
tasked with improving diversity,
and they propose improving rela

tionships between campus and
ethnic communities.
In a close election, the SOCC
endorsement has historically
proven to be valuable to candi
dates. Last year, 10 of the 13
SOCC-endorsed candidates for
Senate went on to win election.
Heng with Graham, the winning
executive slate, also received the
SOCC endorsement.
Hammon told The Daily that
the SOCC endorsement is "the
big one" because the coalition's
support brings volunteers, a
ready-to-use infrastructure and
voters who can be easily mobi
lized. As the two slates struggle to
present themselves as having the
best plan for diversity, holding the
SOCC's stamp of approval can be
crucial and sensitive.
SOCC spokesperson Macar
rin Morton '07 said the SOCC
core committee — which includ
ed chairs of the five SOCC-affili
ated groups — "didn't feel that
[Brett and Lakshmi] best repre
sented the issues and concerns of
the colored community."
When asked why Avula/Jones
received SOCC's endorsement,
Avula claimed his opponents
"didn't show they could get
things done on this University
with regard to communities and
graduate student diversity."
Avula and Jones were also individually en
dorsed by SOCC for last year's senate race.
"We've really pushed hard for these initia
tives and shown that we care over the past two
years," Avula said. "1 think they could see
through the fact that individuals were just
looking for endorsements to get elected, as op
posed to getting endorsements because they
care about the community."
Hammon and Karra said that among the
reasons provided for their failed endorsement
request was that neither had shown involve
ment in one of the SOCC-affiliated groups.The
duo said that not being tied down into one indi
vidual group would allow them to advocate for
all students, including women and the LGBT
community.
"We thought we did a really good job with
our interview and our application because one
of the reasons we're running is because we're
passionate about advocating for communities
of color," Mammon said. "We respect SOCC
and we respect their decision, but we also re
spectfully disagree with the decision because if
we didn't think we were going to do a better job
advocating for students, we wouldn't be run
ning."
Hammon and Karra also noted that, since
failing to receive the SOCC endorsement, they
have individually met with all five SOCC-cov
ered groups: the Black Student Union (BSU),
Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN). Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO), Asian American Students As
sociation (AASA) and Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MKChA).
Within the affiliated communities, however,
support for Avula/Jones is not unanimous.
Charlton Gholson '08 is an African-American
supporter of Brett and Lakshmi. A message
sent last Friday to the Diaspora, an email list
for the black community, listed SOCC endorse
ments such as that for Avula/Jones. In a re
sponse to the email, Gholson reminded list
members of the opposing slate's platform, in
cluding its commitment to diversity.

"1 would think that Brett and Lakshmi de
serve a SOCC endorsement," Gholson said. "1
think, based on my knowledge of how they
have previously advocated for diversity in their
limited capacity in the ASSU, they have estab
lished that they advocate for diversity quite
well."
Gholson was immediately unsubscribed
from the Diaspora. List owners cited an elec
tion rule which requires a sender to get permis
sion from a list owner before sending cam
paign-related emails. After Gholson's removal,
several emails were sent to the list endorsing
Avula/Jones.
Still, Gholson has continued to support
Brett and Lakshmi. flyering and wearing their
T-shirt. He's not a member of the BSU, but he
says there are no "hard feelings" toward SOCC
and its decision to endorse Avula/Jones.
But Gholson told The Daily that he feels the
endorsement of Avula/Jones misrepresents the
differences in the ethnic communities within
and outside SOCC's apparatus.
"I do think that SOCC represents all stu
dents of color at Stanford," Gholson said. "I
mean, it's called the 'Students of Color Coali
tion' — and even though it is the union of [the
five groups], I do think SOCC has to take ac
count of things that go on outside of those five
groups. I do feel that they [should] represent
what 1 think as a student of color, even though
I'm not a literal member of the BSU"
Morton, Jones and Avula did not return re
peated telephone calls and emails over the last
two days seeking comment.
Hammon echoed Gholson's statement, cit
ing the limited reach of the SOCC core that
made the decision.
"When SOCC makes a decision," he said,
"they don't get all 3,(XM) students of color in the
undergraduate community to be at the inter
view— it's just those 10 people [on the core
committee]."
Avula and Jones defended the SOCC
process, however, calling it "very thorough" in
its evaluation of the candidates' ability to rep
resent the colored community.

"Clearly we exhibited the most profession
alism, and our platform is more researched,
and we're more qualified," Avula said, "and I
think that's obviously why we received those
endorsements."
Avula said that sometimes people wrongly
assume that SOCC is only interested in sup
porting minority candidates.
"SOCC receives a lot of criticism because
they're made up of ethnic groups and a lot of
people, very racistly, will think you only got the
endorsement because you're of that ethnic
background," Avula said.
Concerns like these, however, have called
into question the very meaning of an endorse
ment itself. With varying processes and ideas
for endorsement, the word seems flexible to
the student group and situation.
Jones defined an endorsement as meaning
"that we support those communities and that
we have an interest in those communities —
not that we support everything they stand for."
Hammon and Karra said they believe that
endorsements show an interest in their sup
porters' constituents and their issues, as well
as a willingness to work together. According
to them, endorsements don't take the place of
the rest of a candidate's platform or cam
paign.
"It's not like we can sit back and our cam
paign is set," Karra said. "We have to work just
as hard. They're not a shortcut by any means."
But with groups that seem to have litmus
tests for endorsements, such as QSA's empha
sis that their candidates should support non
gender-based housing, it can be difficult for stu
dents to look beyond endorsements without
the guidance of those providing them.
Current senator Danny Arbeiter 'OS re
ceived endorsements from the Stanford De
mocrats and Republicans in his freshman-year
campaign. Now in his second term. Arbeiter
said that endorsements can be effective, but
"for them to be credible, they should come with
some sort of qualifications attached" — quali
fications, he said, that give specific reasoning
for an endorsement.

"An endorsement would he bad when you
trust it blindly," Arbeiter added.
Bobby Lepore '07. the president of the Stan
ford Democrats, said his group wanted to make
the process transparent, at the same time con
veying "information to students about how
candidates really work, behind whatever's just
on their flyers in the bathroom."
Gholson said that even if endorsements are
understood, they can still present a "false di
chotomy" between candidates.
"Endorsements often give the message to
voters that — in the case of SOCC — one can
didate is for diversity and the other isn't."
Gholson said.
Lepore and the Stanford Democrats avoid
ed such problems by endorsing neither execu
tive slate that applied. With a two-thirds major
ity required for approval, and both slates and
their platforms appearing indistinguishable,
the Democrats declined to weigh in. With that
said. Lepore added, "people should read into
our failure to endorse a candidate as a state
ment of the strength of both slates."
In contrast, Morton said that the SOCC
does not endorse more than one candidate (or
neither) because it "defeats the purpose of
helping the community in its decision." SOCC
leaders considered its endorsed candidates the
most qualified, experienced and interested in
the issues.
In the end. though. Arbeiter said it comes
down to a judgment call by each voter, both of
the endorsement itself and the rest of a candi
date's campaign — their platform and experi
ence.
"1 encourage every voter to educate them
selves to the greatest extent possible." Arbeiter
said. "1 think endorsements should be more
like guidelines than strict rules, per sc."
"You're never going to find the perfect can
didate for every student group," he added,"nor
the perfect endorsement for every student who
looks at them."
