# Candidates vie for endorsements
## SOCC is case study for how system works 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
As students begin to fill out
their online ASSU election bal
lots, many think back to the flyers
or Web sites they've glanced at —
and the endorsements that often
accompany them.
In an election where many stu
dents are apathetic or see little
difference between candidates
who make similar promises, en
dorsements can make the differ
ence. But with groups and indi
viduals making private decisions
to publicly support candidates
and slates, students are largely
unaware of the process leading to
endorsements, making them con
fusing and sometimes controver
sial.
Candidates, current senators
and group leaders illuminated
the decision-making process in
more than a dozen interviews
with The Daily this week.
Different groups have differ
ent mechanisms for picking can
didates. The Stanford Democrats
use a questionnaire, followed by
an interview. Groups like the
Queer Straight Alliance (QSA)
are willing to endorse multiple

candidates for the same post if
they agree with the group on is
sues of fundamental importance.
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), like the Democrats,
sends out a questionnaire and
then holds a rigorous interview,
followed by a consensus decision
from representatives of the five
groups included in the coalition.
Despite the finality of these
endorsement decisions, some
question the processes and valid
ity of various endorsements.
SOCC's decision to endorse
Avula/Jones shines light on the
process that unfolds in private
every year.
On a campus where diversity
is widely embraced, the two
front-running slates (Brett and
Lakshmi and Avula/Jones) both
stressed plans for improving the
representation of minorities.
Mondaire Jones '09 has been
involved with the University's
Black Student Union and the
N A ACP since he arrived on cam
pus. Both Jones and running mate
Hershey Avula '08 — who are
both ASSU senators — say they
have helped to author and pro
mote resolutions in the Senate
supporting diversity.
Both Brett Hammon '08 and
Lakshmi Karra '08 have served
on class executive committees
tasked with improving diversity,
and they propose improving rela

tionships between campus and
ethnic communities.
In a close election, the SOCC
endorsement has historically
proven to be valuable to candi
dates. Last year, 10 of the 13
SOCC-endorsed candidates for
Senate went on to win election.
Heng with Graham, the winning
executive slate, also received the
SOCC endorsement.
Hammon told The Daily that
the SOCC endorsement is "the
big one" because the coalition's
support brings volunteers, a
ready-to-use infrastructure and
voters who can be easily mobi
lized. As the two slates struggle to
present themselves as having the
best plan for diversity, holding the
SOCC's stamp of approval can be
crucial and sensitive.
SOCC spokesperson Macar
rin Morton '07 said the SOCC
core committee — which includ
ed chairs of the five SOCC-affili
ated groups — "didn't feel that
[Brett and Lakshmi] best repre
sented the issues and concerns of
the colored community."
When asked why Avula/Jones
received SOCC's endorsement,
Avula claimed his opponents
"didn't show they could get
things done on this University
with regard to communities and
