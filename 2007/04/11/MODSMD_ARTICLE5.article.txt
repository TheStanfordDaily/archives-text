## INSIDE THE RUSH PROCESS IFC fraternities begin two-week-long recruitment 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Monday and Tuesday,
hordes of freshmen descended on
the Row to play games, gorge
themselves on free food, and de
cide if they want to live with fifty
other guys for the next three years.
They were taking part in the first of
five open rush events each fraterni
ty will he holding over the next two
weeks, described variously by fra
ternities members as a sorting
process, a competition, and an in
troduction to a lifelong experience.
A fraternity rush event general
ly centers around an activity -
whether it's mock casino gambling,
arcade games, or hookah night -
and food, from ln-and-Out burgers
to Subway sandwiches. The activi
ties provide a focal point for the
event while the fraternity brothers
thread their way through the crowd

attempting to get to know the
rushees and trying to impress them
with the uniqueness of their organ
ization.
Housed fraternities will host
their events in their houses: Kappa
Sigma,Theta Delta Chi, Sigma Nu,
Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Alpha.
The unhoused fraternities. Delta
Tau Delta, Sigma Epsilon, Delta
Kappa Epsilon and Alpha Epsilon
Pi. will hold their events in rented
Row houses. All are members of
the Interfraternity Council (IFC).
which does not include the mem
bers of the African-American Fra
ternal-Sororal Association or the
Multicultural Greek Council.
Many of these ethnically themed
fraternities are simultaneously
holding rush events.
Some IPC fraternities will host
hosts an event from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sat
urday. Apr. 14.simultaneously holding rush
events.
Some II C fraternities will host events
from 8 to 11 p.m. on Mondays and Wednes
days while others will have events on Tues
days and Thursdays. In the second week, the
fraternities will change around their calen
dars. in order to avoid
"This year our rush events are sort of
themed around our basic rush theme," said
Anant Vinjamoori '08. SigEp's recruitment
chair. "Which is basically us being different
from all the other fraternities and better.
1 lence our slogan.'Different and Better.'"
David Pi ingle '08. recruitment chair for
SAF. explained that most frats will gather
after the event to discuss the people that
they've met that night.
"It varies in length, getting longer as the
process goes on, he said. "It's basically just
the impressions that people have. If you talk
to a guy and say that he's a great guy. I'll
make sure to talk to him later on."
The meeting process is very informal, and
further discussions will often take place dur
ing meals and other occasions when mem
bers of a fraternity gather. But Rainer Castil
lo '07. one of Sigma Nu's recruitment chairs,
explained that there is an element of self-se
lection in the process.
"We'll get a huge draw the first night and
then a smaller crowd each day as rush pro
gresses. It'll break down naturally without
our help. We don't only invite people to some
events. We want everyone to come if they're
interested."
Most fraternity members emphasized
that there were no specific criteria for the
rushees.The events are about seeing whether
the rushees would be able to enjoy the cul
ture of the frat.
"There are a lot of people we're really
close to. but they're just not a great fit for the
organization." Castillo explained.
After the five open events, each fraternity
has an invitation-only off-campus event,
which takes place either on Friday. Apr. 20,0r
Saturday. Apr. 21. An invitation to one of
these events indicates that the fraternity is
seriously considering uiving the rushee an

offer of membership, called a "bid." A frater
nity will personally deliver their bids on the
following Sunday, and prospective members
have until Wednesday to accept.
The fraternity rush process is governed by
a series of rules, which are enforced by the
IFC. First of all. no alcohol can be consumed
in the house during a rush event, even in
closed rooms. Second of all. no rushee can be
in the house after the event ends at 11 p.m.
On days when the fraternity is not hosting an
event, rushees should not be in the house at
all. If fraternity members take rushees off
campus during the recruitment period, to
dinner for instance, they must be returned by
7:30 p.m., so they have time to attend other
fraternity events.
The rule mandating a dry rush was put in
place by the Stanford administration, but
many fraternity members expressed approval.
"It's like when you walk into a bar." said
IFC recruitment chair Kyle Ladewig *08.
"You don't go into a bar, drunk, expecting to
find your soulmate. In the same way. you
don't go into fraternity recruitment, which is
a lifetime commitment, drunk and expect to
find the right fraternity"
Brian Inouye '08. the other IFC recruit
ment chair, explained that the other rules
were designed to provide freshmen with
equal access to each fraternity and vice versa,
especially in light of competition for rushees
between the various organizations.
"Every fraternity is trying to get a good
class for next year," he said. "There is a com
petition between the houses. Everyone
knows specific freshmen and everyone wants
them. There are cool kids out there and the
houses do want them."
However. Jake Fuentes'o9. Sigma N u's other
recruitment chair, thought that competition
between frats was minimal.
"I think that the frats have enough differ
ences on their own that it's obvious which
frat will end up with which group of people."
Stanford's fraternity rush process is more
structured than that at many other universities.
In addition to the ban on alcohol during rush
events. Stanford's lower-key fall rush is closed
to freshmen, because the University wants all
incoming students to have a unified freshman

experience. Additionally, most universities
lack Stanford's restrictions on when or how
many rush events a fraternity may hold.
Avishai Weiss '08. the IFC president, at
tributed these differences to the greater
amount of power Stanford has over the
Greek system.
"Because they own all the property, any

thing we do is under their jurisdiction," he
said."Whereas because at UCI.A all the frats
are all off-campus, they don't really need any
connection to the school. Stanford really
does have an arm in everything. And they do
feel a lot more like a parent in that sense.
"Fraternities have to meet with [Assistant
Dean and Director of Student Activities]

Nanci Howe before rush started to get their
events approved," he continued. "Nanci
Howe sits down and says, 'This is OK. this is
OK. this isn't OK.' There are no real guide
lines either; it's just how she feels that day."
Howe was not available for comment.

next two weeks are themed around games, in an attempt to attract interested candidates and break the ice.
