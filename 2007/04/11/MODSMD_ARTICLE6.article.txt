# POCKETBOOK TO TEXTBOOK
## Citing convenience, students stay with Bookstore, spurn SUPost 
### JESSICA FISHELL 
It's that time of year again. Car
rying another shrink-wrapped
monster, you hold your breath be
fore you rip through the plastic,
knowing you're about to decrease
its buyback value forever. But what
can you do? It's a required text
book.
New books are expensive. Text
book costs have risen at twice the
rate of inflation over the past 20
years, according to a 2005 report by
the Government Accountability
Office.
And students face a double hur
dle in purchasing materials for the
quarter. With hand-picked content,
low-publication-run course readers

can add another fifty to eighty dol
lars per class to their costs.
Some professors, out of a desire
to save their students money, turn
to self-publishing firms, either on
line or nearby. Econ Prof. Gavin
Wright, for example, used universi
tyreaders.com, a site which publish
es and ships course readers to stu
dents. But students said that price
wasn't necessarily the most impor
tant thing.
"| Wright ] made us order them,
but now I have to wait for it to come
in and I don't even know if it was
that much cheaper," said Frances
Clow '08.
Similar concerns are evident in
the textbook market. Though stu
dents often complain about high
prices, the Stanford Bookstore
holds the lead in the textbook mar
ket. Of twenty-three people inter
viewed by the Daily, 80 percent of
students cited the Bookstore as the
number one place they go to for textbooks.
"If they have the used books there, then I'll
just buy them because I like having them right
away," said Clow.
The problem, however is that used books
usually sell out in the first few days of classes.
"If they don't have the used books there, 1
get them from Amazon," Clow said.
Indeed,students ranked websites like Ama
zon. com and Half.com as their second-most
frequent source for textbooks, citing cheaper
prices and large used markets. Still, students
complain about the time they must wait before
receiving their materials.
"Fall quarter. I received a book two weeks
after turning in the test on it," recalls Kali
Donovan '07.
More immediate but less dependable are
sources like campus chat lists, friends, and dor
mmates, the third-most-popular textbook
source. Personal networks are full of bargains
and the book you need could be just down the

hall, but what's available is unpredictable and
difficult to navigate efficiently.
"I like going to friends for books,but they're
normally not the books I need." says Aimee
Epstein '08.
Least-used are websites designed to facili
tate these interactions, such as SUPost.com,
TheHappyZork.com. and uloop.com. Admin
istrators of these websites say that they provide
a common ground where students can connect
to other students across campus to buy and sell
according to their needs - and the needs of their
bank accounts. Yet students voting with their
mouse clicks generally avoid these sites in
favor of more tried-and-true procurement
methods, citing usability concerns.
SUPost.com is a forum where students post
what they want to buy or sell. Students can also
use it to promote events or find roommates. It's
quick and simple. Founder Greg Wientjes. an
MA student in Electrical Engineering, esti
mates that students post an average of 1(H)

items, personals, and events per week, with
goods ranging from textbooks to futons to cars
for sale. Approximately 10 percent of those
posts are textbook-related. The challenge is
trying to come up with the most creative post
title for your category.
Uloop.com is a newer website, but has a simi
lar idea. Launched at UC Santa Barbara this Jan
uary with a wide variety of posting categories,
Uloop's goal is to create a student exchange net
work. Uloop. Co-founder Denis Miller says, cuts
out the middle-man and helps students avoid
pesky mark-ups on textbooks. Students can
browse postings at their campus according to
category or post date, and create profiles so that
others know who they're talking to.
On TheHappyZork.com. students can post
books and more, thanks to a new classifieds
section. The site even provides sellers with
comparable prices from the Stanford Book
store and Amazon.com for reference. Unlike at
Uloop. you don't have to join to start searching,

though due to trust and security concerns, it
also requires a valid .edu email address for
users to engage in transactions. And if the
search comes up empty, the site provides a link
to that book on the Amazon used marketplace.
"If nobody on campus is selling a particular
book, we still want to be useful."says Donovan, who
founded the website after his earlier frustrations.
So why are these websites still in fourth
place in the textbook market?
"I think the websites are a really cool idea,
but I just never get around to it"says Clow.
And when it comes to buying books, stu
dents say that it's easiest to buy them in the
same place you can get the initial book lists.
"There are a lot of [websites] on campus, but
they're all really useless," said Josh Liptzin '08.
And if. after all those options, you still don't
want to pay for a book, there's always the li
brary.
