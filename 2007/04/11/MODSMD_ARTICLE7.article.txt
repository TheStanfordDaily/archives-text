ture of the conservative movement.

had a great time serving him and we had fun.

the U.S. system should he reformed to
ensure that all Americans have access
to health care.
"We should have a healthcare sys
tem in which money flows to individ
uals so they have a choice," Shultz
said.
He added that many of Reagan's
principles could be applied to modern
day problems. For example, he ex
plained that the former president's in
cremental approach to curbing ozone
emissions could be applied to carbon
dioxide emissions today. However, he
also noted that any carbon reduction
treaty must be an all-inclusive one that
regulates developing countries like
China and India to be truly effective.
"Why not apply the Montreal pro
tocol — a process that keeps identify
ing things that can done about [carbon
dioxide emissions] — and makes an
agreement on a global basis to solve
global warming."
The event kicked off the first of
several meetings that SCS leadership
has slated for conservatives on cam
pus. The group was founded to mobi
lize the University's conservative
community and to promote discourse
among campus conservatives.
SCS Treasurer Steve Flory' 10 said
that while the group would not hold
weekly meetings, it plans to be active.
"We don't want to have a weekly
meeting but every several weeks we
will have Coffee with Conservatives
as a time for conservatives to come
together and talk about politics."
Flory said.
SCS President Grant Starrett '10
said that he plans to bring Craig Rom
ney.son of 2008 Republican presiden
tial candidate Mitt Romney, to cam
pus in addition to Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court John Roberts.
Milton Solorzano '07 said he was
happy with the buzz surrounding the
opening event.
"It was an excellent opportunity to
bridge the disparate conservative
communities at Stanford." he said,
"and a wonderful opportunity to hear
one of the greatest policy figures of
the late 20th century."
