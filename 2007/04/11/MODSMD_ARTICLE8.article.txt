## Go-Pass measure divides grads 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When graduate students head to the polls today
and tomorrow,they will be faced with the latest chap
ter in the Go-Pass saga, one of the most fiercely de
bated issues in graduate student politics. For years,
the highly controversial subsidized transportation
program for off-campus students has managed to sur
vive through heavy advocacy and last-minute com
promises.

But (his election could he its last breath.
A measure on this year's graduate ballot asks stu
dents whether all off-campus graduate students
should be charged a non-refundable fee to finance
the purchase of CalTVain's Go-Pass, which gives hold
ers unlimited rides on the transit system for one year
hut can only be bought en masse.
Though the referendum is only an advisory one.
with the provost having the final say
on whether the charge is ultimately
applied, the barriers to its passing
are much higher than for other bal
lot measures. Not only must the Go-
Pass measure obtain 66 percent of
votes in the election, but a petition
with signatures from at least half of
all off-campus graduate students
must also be submitted by August.
And after passage, 50 percent of the
passes have to be picked up by the
end of Autumn Quarter if the pro
gram is to continue into the future.
If all those conditions are met
and the Provost approves the
charge, the Go Pass fee — at $108
for the year — would be higher than
the combined total of all other grad
uate student general and special
fees. The total cost of the program
exceeds $300,000.
The road leading to this point has
been long and complicated. A hasti
ly assembled special fee measure

that would have funded the program
failed in last year's election, and the
Go-Pass was only kept alive by a
last-minute deal struck between the
University and the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC).
One of the stipulations of that
deal was that the GSC must put
some measure on this year's ballot
that would fund the Go-Pass pro
gram without additional University
support. The final version of the
measure, however, is very different
from what many expected it to be
earlier in the year.
Originally intended to be a re
fundable special fee applied to all
graduate students — on-campus
and off — it was revised early last
quarter to apply only to off-campus
graduate students. But then concern
arose that too many students might
ask for their money back if the fee
remained refundable.
"The main reason that the GSC

felt we had to go forward with this
non-refundable fee was that the
kind of ballot measure we were
thinking about had too much of a
risk," said Graduate Student Trans
portation Board member Martin
Mueller, one of the authors of the
ballot measure. "With the potential
ly high refund rate, that might have
bankrupted the whole ASSU finan
cial system."
Since the ASSU does not have the
authority to institute a non-refund
able fee. the ballot measure became
an advisory one that the provost will
use in making a final decision on
whether to institute the charge.
Both proponents and opponents
of the measure agree that the final
version is a compromise solution.
"The non-refundable fee was not
my first choice, but given the situa
tion the University is in offering the
Go-Pass to students, it's the best op
tion," Mueller said.

But those opposed to the meas
ure say it is not what off-campus stu
dents were looking for.
"The problem is that it is a sub
sidy for some students at the ex
pense of others." said Adam Beberg.
a GSC representative who lives off
campus and voted against putting
the measure on the ballot. "Once
you explain to students where the
money is coming from, they agree
it's not a great idea.The thing people
aren't really aware of is that the
money would come from other stu
dents."
Prior versions of the Go-Pass
program had been heavily subsi
dized by the University, making the
ultimate cost to students significant
ly cheaper. Last year, the pass was
funded entirely by the provost's of
fice. while it was paid for jointly by
the GSC, the provost and the deans
of the various schools this year.
But since the University has sig

naled that it is no longer willing to
continue contributing money, the
program can only survive if it is
funded entirely by students without
any subsidy from the administration.
With such high barriers to pass
ing, and without the incentive of a
University subsidy, many are skepti
cal that the measure will pass.
"It's basically dead.The criteria is
so high that it won't happen," Be
berg said. "There's no fair way to do
it anymore."
And a 'no' vote on the Go-Pass
ballot measure this week would like
ly spell the program's death knell.
"Unless a donor is generous
enough to pay the $320,000 to
$350,000 cost for the program, we
don't see any other way to fund this,"
said GSC co-Chair Jenny Allen, who
also writes for The Daily.
