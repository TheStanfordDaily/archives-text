# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Task force calls for dorm fixes More community, staff in housing neighborhoods 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) Cirqg Boardman said hiring
more staff to create broader neigh
borhood identity in dorms could be
coming, if the the findings of the Stan
ford Task force Evaluating Educa
tion in Residences (STEER) are im
plemented. Only a handful of people
attended the presentation to residen
tial education student staff at Toyon
Lounge last night, the culmination of
an almost 18-month process set in
place by Provost John Etchemendy.
The faculty, staff and student
members of STEER studied reports
and current program structure, col
lected feedback from 14 student
focus groups and interviews with fac
ulty and staff.
"The STEER effort confirmed
many of the excellences we find [in
residential education at Stanford],
but also revealed many areas for con
cern." Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education (VPIJE) John Brav
man said in an email to The Daily.
"The STEER process recognized
that residences are the nexus for most
students' lives most of each day, and
that a more thorough effort to build
upon our legacy of education in the
residences was the best way to cele
brate what we have already accom
plished."
The task force found that student
interest and engagement in residen
tial experiences is generally positive,
but that the quality of that experience
varies dramatically. It also noted that
student issues are becoming increas
ingly complex and time-consuming.
The group also decided that resi
dences are autonomous units with lit
tle accountability and that limited re
sources and lack of space due to over
crowded dorms detract from creating
dynamic living and learning environ
ments.
Boardman also noted that the res
idential education staff is increasing
ly occupied with student conduct is
sues and that the program is no
longer attracting tenured faculty to
resident fellow positions.
The task force proposes an en
hanced partnership between the of
fices of the VPSA, VPUF and Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises, all of
which had a representative acting as a
co-Chair of STEER.
Members of STEER also envision
a residential education system in
which every undergraduate resi
dence hall will be part of one of ap
proximately 10-12 'neighborhoods'
with a minimum of one faculty fellow
— a tenured professor who is respon
sible for academic programming —
and one residence dean, who will act
as a student affairs professional re
sponsible for student well-being and
behavior. Both the faculty fellow and
the residence dean would live on-site.
Additional part-time and full-time
staff would also be hired to create ef
fective residential and academic sup
port teams.
"Each residence hall will have dif
ferent needs depending on size and
composition," Boardman said,"so we
will be flexible when filling neighbor
hood staffing."
The University also hopes to hire
a director to lead the residential ed
ucation program and implement the
recommendations of the task force.
In addition, working groups will
complete a thorough review of poli
cies, programs and practices to look
at other issues, such as those related
to student residential staff positions
and the Draw. Implementation will
take an estimated two to three
years.
Another session announcing the
STEER findings will be held next
Wednesday at Roble Theater from 7-
8 p.m.
