# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Task force calls for dorm fixes More community, staff in housing neighborhoods 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) Cirqg Boardman said hiring
more staff to create broader neigh
borhood identity in dorms could be
coming, if the the findings of the Stan
ford Task force Evaluating Educa
tion in Residences (STEER) are im
plemented. Only a handful of people
attended the presentation to residen
tial education student staff at Toyon
Lounge last night, the culmination of
an almost 18-month process set in
place by Provost John Etchemendy.
The faculty, staff and student
members of STEER studied reports
and current program structure, col
lected feedback from 14 student
focus groups and interviews with fac
ulty and staff.
"The STEER effort confirmed
many of the excellences we find [in
residential education at Stanford],
but also revealed many areas for con
cern." Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education (VPIJE) John Brav
man said in an email to The Daily.
"The STEER process recognized
that residences are the nexus for most
students' lives most of each day, and
that a more thorough effort to build
upon our legacy of education in the
residences was the best way to cele
brate what we have already accom
plished."
The task force found that student
interest and engagement in residen
tial experiences is generally positive,
but that the quality of that experience
varies dramatically. It also noted that
student issues are becoming increas
ingly complex and time-consuming.
