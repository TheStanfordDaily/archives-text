April 12,1989
An article entitled "Students at odds with budgeting,
poll shows" revealed the results of a survey returned by
1.200 undergraduates who ranked their top 10 budget pri
orities.
Their top five priorities were undergraduate scholar
ships, undergraduate housing, teaching assistants in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, undergraduate re
search and hiring women faculty and faculty of color.
"The University dropped undergraduate housing from
its list of Centennial Campaign fundraising priorities Feb.
9," the article reads.
More than 80 percent of students said that the 8 percent
tuition rise from 1989-1990 was not justified, and more than
90 percent said that administrators "should do more to ad
dress the problem of undergraduate housing."
