Zimbabwe bishops condemn treatment
of opposition

The leaders of the Zimbabwe
Catholic Bishops Conference

circulated a pastoral letter on

Easter Sunday condemning the

treatment of opposition lead

ers by the government of

President Robert Mugabe

The letter, titled "God Hears

the Cries of the Oppressed

was posted in churches through

out the country, even as opposi

tion activist Philip Katsande re-

mained in "very critical condition" ac
cording to doctors in Harare, Zimbab
we's capital. Katsande, who works for
the Movement for Democratic
Change, has been hospitalized since ,
Thursday, when police officers shot
him three times in his own home.
The Bishops Conference's letter sig
nals the greatest show of support yet for <
the anti-Mugabe democratic opposition
from the country's Catholic establish- ;
ment. Christianity and indigenous ani- I
mist beliefs constitute Zimbabwe's <
major religions. I"he actions of the Mu- !
gabe government regarding the opposi- !
tion, including evidence of the brutal I
beatings of Morgan Tsvangirai and his 1
supporters and allegations of politically i
motivated murder, have brought strong I
international pressure on the regime <
since the crackdown began in March. I
It is in this context that South African <
President Thabo Mbeki, currently in the ;
Sudan for discussions with leaders <
about the Darfur crisis, is said to be in I
the process of formulating a strategy for ]
mediating between Zimbabwe's fac- I
tions. Mbeki was given a mandate last i
month by the South African Develop
ment Community to mediate the crisis
in Zimbabwe. 'Ibis marks Mbeki's fifth
mandate from the SADC since 20(H) to
resolve a conflict in Zimbabwe. While
critics argue that the South African
President must raise the profile and in
tensity of his efforts to deal with liarare,
Pretoria has expressed concern that
very public diplomacy might alienate
the Mugabe regime.

Terrorist bombings in
Algiers attempt assas
sination, wound 100

On Wednesday, a group
calling itself al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb completed a
series of deadly terrorist

bombings in the Algerian

capital city. The first explo- I

sion, which ripped a mas- \

sive hole in a building that

houses central government of-

fices in downtown Algiers,deto-

nated shortly before 11 a.nv

local time. The blast, which was

apparently designed to take the

life of Algerian Prime Minister Ah

delaziz Belkhadem. was followed by

a number of bombings in the eastern

district of Bab Ezzouar. on the road to
the airport and near one of the country's
premier universities. The main target of
this series of attacks was apparently the
neighborhood police office.
More than 1 (X) people were wounded
in the combined attacks, with minimum
fatality estimates ranging from 23 to 30
dead. Prime Minister Belkhadem. who
survived the attempt on his life, was show
ered with support from international lead
ers, and made a statement on the radio
condemning acts that were "criminal,
cowardly, and committed at precisely the
moment in which the Algerian people are
demanding national reconciliation."

Algeria, which suffered
through bloody civil con-

b .. w.wv-w.j
flirt during most of the 1990s

in which violent Islamist groups
played a major part, has not seen such a vi
olent attack in its capital in more than a
decade. The attacks were carried out by
suicide bombers driving explosive-laden
vehicles. They were planned by al-Qaeda
in the Islamic Maghreb, formerly known
as the Salafist Group for Preaching and
Combat, an Islamist terrorist group that
announced in January its intentions to be
come an affiliate of Osama bin Laden's al-
Qaeda movement. During his residency in
the Sudan in the mid 1990'5, bin Laden
funded and trained Islamist groups for ter
rorist operations in many North African
countries, including Algeria.

U.N. reports on Sudanese attack on Chad
The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees called international attention to
eastern Chad this week after an attack by
Sudanese Janjaweed militias killed hun
dreds of villagers on March 31. Initial esti
mates by Chad's government, located in
the far western capital of N'Djamena, put
the number of dead at less than 1 (XX but the
U.N. now says that probably 2()0 to 400 peo
ple were killed by the Janjaweed.
"Because most of the dead were buried
where their bodies were found," the High
Commissioner said on Wednesday, "often
in common graves owing to their numbers,
we may never know their exact number."
For months, international watch groups
have been warning that the crisis in Sudan's
Darfur region would escalate to include
Chad along with the Central African Re
public, as Darfuri refugees sought safe
haven in these countries from the deadly
militias. Since erupting in 2003, as many as
450,(KX) have died in the conflict in Darfur.
with millions more displaced.
The international outcry against what
is generally considered a genocide by the
Khartoum government of Omar al-Bashir
has still not generated meaningful change
in the Sudanese leader's policy toward
Darfur. The American diplomat John Ne
groponte. Deputy Secretary of State, left
late Wednesday for Sudan, where he will
urge President al-Bashir to take action to
end the violence in Darfur. which Presi
dent Bush has described as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Sudanese government ac
cused the military forces of Chad of killing
at least 17 Sudanese soldiers during a raid
into Sudan's territory on Monday. Chad
has repeatedly denounced the Sudanese
government, saying that it is intentionally
sending rebel forces into Chadian territo
ry to attack military and civilian targets.
