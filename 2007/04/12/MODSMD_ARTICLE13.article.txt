NEW YORK (AP) —Kurt Von
negut, the satirical novelist who captured
the absurdity of war and questioned the
advances of science in darkly humorous
works such as "Slaughterhouse-Five"
and "Cat's Cradle." died Wednesday. He
was 84.
Vonnegut. who often marveled that
he had lived so long despite his lifelong
smoking habit, had suffered brain in
juries after a fall at his Manhattan home
weeks ago, said his wife, photographer
Jill Krementz.
The author of at least 19 novels, many
of them best-sellers, as well as dozens of
short stories, essays and plays, Vonnegut
relished the role of a social critic. He lee

tured regularly, exhorting audiences to
think for themselves and delighting in
barbed commentary against the institu
tions he felt were dehumanizing people.
"I will say anything to be funny,often
in the most horrible situations." Von
negut. whose watery, heavy-lidded eyes
and unruly hair made him seem to be in
existential pain, once told a gathering of
psychiatrists.
A self-described religious skeptic and
freethinking humanist, Vonnegut used
protagonists such as Billy Pilgrim and
Eliot Rosewater as transparent vehicles
for his points of view. He also tilled his
novels with satirical commentary and
even drawings that were only loosely
connected to the plot. In "Slaughtcr
housc-Five." he drew a headstone with
the epitaph: "Everything wns beautiful.

and nothing hurt."
But much in his life was traumatic,
and left him in pain.
Despite his commercial success. Von
negut battled depression throughout his
life, and in 1984. he attempted suicide
with pills and alcohol, joking later about

how he botched the job.
His mother had succeeded in killing
herself just before he left for Germany
during World War 11. where he was
quickly taken prisoner during the Battle
of the Bulge. I le was being held in Dres
den when Allied bombs created a
lircstorni that killed an estimated tens of
thousands of people in the city.
"The firebombing of Dresden ex
plains absolutely nothing about why I
write what I write and am what I am,"
Vonncgut wrote in "Fates Worse Than
Death." his 1991 autobiography of sorts.
But he spent 23 years struggling to
write about the ordeal, which he sur
vived by huddling with other POW's in
side an underground meat locker la
beled slaughterhouse-five.
The novel, in which Pvt. Pilgrim is
transported from Dresden by time-trav
e ling aliens from the planet
Iralfamadore, was published at the
height of the Vietnam War, and solidified
his reputation as an iconoclast.
