Coalition (SLAC) will announce

pledged to fast until the University
answers the group's demand for a
"real" living wage for campus
workers.
The symbolic protest action is in
protest of the University's living
wage policy, which SLAC claims ap
plies to very few workers because
they say it contains unfair loop
holes.
