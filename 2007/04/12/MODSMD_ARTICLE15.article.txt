## GSC debates discretionary spending Grads approve a plan to send lobbyist to D.C. 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Amid elections to decide their
successors. Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) members debated next
year's budget at one of their last
meetings together last night.
Much of the discussion centered
around how much of the program
ming budget should be allocated to
discretionary funds, unattached to
any specific purpose. A tentative
budget presented at the meeting set
aside a significantly larger amount
for discretionary use than was allo
cated this year, and the proposed
amount would increase by $7,(HM) if a
constitutional amendment passes in
this week's election.
Some said that leaving so much
money to the discretion of the GSC is

simply irresponsible governance.
"When I look at this budget. 1 see
a lack of focus and purpose in the
GSC," said education graduate stu
dent representative Matt Andrews.
"When we choose to put 25 percent
of our money in discretionary funds,
that's a lot of money to be putting in
and telling graduate students, 'Oh,
trust us.'"
Instead of putting money into dis
cretionary spending. Andrews said,
funding should be allocated to spe
cific line items that state clearly what
kind of events for which the money
will be used.
But other members were in favor
of the flexibility allowed by the larg
er pool of discretionary funds.
"They do let us do things that we
haven't done in the past and couldn't
foresee." said GSC member and
Shireen Barday J.D. 'OS.
One such example of the pro
gramming mentioned was for events
initiated by students outside the
GSC, which have previously been fi
nanced through discretionary funds.

The discussion did not come to a
conclusion last night, and a vote was
postponed until next week's meet
ing.
The GSC also approved applied
physics graduate student Dirk En
glund as its official lobbyist for tax
relief in Washington. D.C.
However, approval for another
representative — Maxim Afanasyev
MBA '08 — to serve as a lobbyist for
international student issues was
blocked.
"1 don't sense clarity in the room
about what the problem is, and what
your solution is." GSC member and
comparative literature graduate stu
dent George Bloom said, after rais
ing an objection to approving
Afanasyev. "1 don't have a sense at
this point exactly what he's advocat
ing and to whom."
That matter will be brought up
again when the incoming GSC con
venes.
