## Editorial Board California Knows How to Vote 
### 
For years, federal reports have been
rolling out proclaiming the sad state
of electronic voting. The Congres
sional Research Service, the Government
Accountability Office and independent
analysis from the Caltech/MIT Voting
Technology project all raise serious con
cerns about the possibility for fraud, misuse
and human errors when using increasingly
popular electronic voting machines. While
some of these machines appear to work
fine, others like Diebold's Accu Vote-TS
machine are apparently fraught with
known security issues. A recent academic
paper from Princeton reviewing the ma
chine warns of vulnerabilities "to extreme
ly serious attacks," that would enable ne'er
do-wells to install malicious code in a vot
ing situation in under a minute. Worse, the
government has failed to deploy national
standards and certifications for voting ma
chines.
The state of California, at least, is taking
matters into its own hands. In recent weeks
California Secretary of State Debra Brown
unveiled the most rigorous top-down re
view of electronic voting machines to date.

Brown's proposal would subject potential
electronic voting machines to urgently
needed physical and electronic tests.
Amongst other tests, these would involve
the use of "red teams," consisting of groups
of hackers who would attempt to tamper
with the machines in voting-reslistic sce
narios. Perhaps even more important is
Brown's demand to inspect the source
code on all voting machines before certifi
cation. Many machines on the market use
unacceptable closed-source proprietary
software that is not available for inspec
tion. Hopefully Brown's stringent stan
dards will force voting machine manufac
turers to be more open and transparent
about the software that makes theses ma
chines tick.
'ITiis is a long overdue step, and we com
mend Debra Brown for her efforts to en
sure that electronic voting machines are
held to the high standard that our democ
racy deserves.
The federal government however, still
lags inexcusably behind. We hope Congress
will pay attention to California and swiftly
adopt its standards on the national level.
