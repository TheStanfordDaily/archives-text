# I Think I Need A Crash Course on Life
## 
### 
I have learned a lot of things at Stanford.
I've read "King Lear," practiced my golf
swing and studied ocean currents. I
learned about the "U.S. and the Middle East
Since l%7"and analyzed art "From Paris to
New York in the Early 20th Century." As
much as I have loved every moment of my
highly-eclectic, incredibly specific Stanford
classes, I am getting a little worried about my
education.
The real-world tornado spins menacingly
closer, picking up velocity with each passing
quarter. I'm afraid that instead of running
for the basement, however, I'll end up over
the rainbow, confused and dazzled in my
own dream-land,still biking everywhere, not
locking my door, and assuming everyone
else is a Democrat. In fact, college is like
being on the Yellow Brick Road in many
ways: You are on a clear journey in a magical
land towards an end goal, there is a lot of di
versity in your friend group, and the trees are
something to be reckoned with, whether due
to evilness or caterpillars. But instead of joy
fully waking up in my Kansas bed surround
ed by concerned and loving family members,
I think I am going to leave this good-witch,
munchkin-filled land only to be hit in the
face with the Brick Wall of Reality. I can't
sew on a button, and in all honesty 1 am un
clear on what subletting actually is. I think I
need to take a crash course on life.
Firstly, I am worried about where I am
going to live. Soon over are the days of guar
anteed housing, two-minute commutes and
free laundry, and fast approaching are the
years of unpleasant landlords,stuccoing pin
holes. and unfurnished rooms. Finding an
apartment seems like a scary, way-too-adult
thing to be doing in the first place. How will
1 know what furniture I will need, and are
you sure those free egg crates that come with
my dorm's produce orders aren't a good way
to save on shelves? And how will I know
what is a good deal for a room? Older
friends of mine seem to self-importantly
throw out numbers willy-nilly, sharing with
their other older and inevitably well-in
formed peers the cost of their studio in the
Mission District. The graduated, initiated
to-adult-land-ers simultaneously sigh and
shake their heads — what a bad deal. Then
some lucky renters reveal how little they are
paying for a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half
bath on 15th. and all the ripened tenants col
lectively cluck in concurrence — a steal and
a half. I guess graduation marks the begin
ning of everyone's real estate career. Al
though I'm hoping this property knowledge
comes from listening to these oldies and not
via apartment blunders and nightmare
neighbors, I think all I really need to know is
how not to get ripped off. Will I give myself
away as a fresh-faced, utterly naive, private
ly schooled graduate if I inquire about get
ting a public-use foosball table in the lobby?
I am also concerned about transporta
tion. Between the free Marguerite service
and subsidized event transportation, 1 use
my car almost exclusively to drive to Secret
Safeway and go to the gym when it's raining.
As the late comedian Mitch Hedberg once
said (God rest his soul)."I don't know how
to fix a car. If my car breaks down, and the
gas tank does not say 'E." I'm fed." Ditto
that. Mitch. 1 have assumed for far too long
that some Stanford party-planner some
where has had the forethought to charter
buses for my convenience. I have never had
to check my oil, add windshield wiper fluid

or renew my registration. I feel like there are
other fluids that you can add/should check in
your car. but 1 guess they will reveal them
selves to me either when a helpful light be
comes illuminated on my dashboard or
when my car starts smoking and smelling
strange.
Perhaps the thing that worries me most is
insurance. Apparently you need to pay small
amounts of money on a regular basis to
make sure that stuff doesn't happen to your
stuff. Soon, I'll no longer be under my par
ent's insurance wing. How do I get health in
surance? 1 am pretty sure that as a young, in
spired youth I am supposed to hate the con
glomerate that is the HMO, but I am not sure
why or what to do about that — HMO:
Human Mind Organization, Humble
Medics Operation, Hurting Men Ostraciza
tion. I am also pretty sure I am going to need
insurance for my car. And my life. And what
about my future pet? Should I get travel in
surance? Dental insurance? Worker's com
pensation insurance? At this point, the only
things that 1 would currently want to have
covered are my computer and my Facebook
pictures. And maybe my orchids.
I think that 1 need a home-ec class, too.
How do I cook things that don't involve
cheese or pasta? How do 1 darn socks?
Hem pants? Trim a tree? And dare I say it.
change a diaper?
All I can hope is that someday, when a
mechanic is fixing a flat tire of mine, he will
look perplexed and say, "God, I've been
thinking, what's the name of the comedic go
between in Geoffrey Chaucer's famous
poem.Troilus and Criseyde?" Now there is
something I can help you with.
