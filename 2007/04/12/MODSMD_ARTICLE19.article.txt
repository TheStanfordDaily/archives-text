# An Admit Weekend Guide for the Parents
## 
### 
Dear Parent of an Admitted Student:
Congratulations! Your son or daugh
ter has been admitted to Stanford
University. We know this must be an exciting
time for you, so we would like to share in
your joy by telling you how to best curb it.
Your child is welcome to attend Admit
Weekend, the weekend of April 19-22 nd. an
awkward carnival of souls resembling a pre
teen beauty pageant. You are welcome to
come visit our campus as well, though we
imagine that will be vaguely awkward for
your son or daughter.Thus, we strongly con
sider you renting a room in one of our local
and hideously expensive hotels.
We advise you to leave your phone num
ber and be prepared to pick up your child in
tears at any moment. Perhaps they are not
are ready for college this year, or are not the
college type. Wrap your arms around the
child and reassure that them it's okay. Your
deposit is non-refundable, however.
As a new member of the Stanford family,
parents of Stanford students have access to
our many resources. We encourage you to in
vestigate our sponsored vacation program,
enjoy our Stanford yacht club, or receive
free pamphlets for the high end retirement
homes that your children will put you in.
We have enclosed a list of classes that
parents are welcome to sit in on, as well as a
list of recommended restaurants. If you are
feeling lonely, we have enclosed a list of sin
gle and willing faculty members.
During opening festivities, please do not
leave your child unattended. Your child is
special and unique, but so is everyone else's.
Make sure that the little genius you take
home is your own, for many geniuses look

similar at first glance. If at the end of the day,
you can still not find your child,lost boys and
girls will be forced to join the Stanford Band.
When you arrive, try to mention as often
as possible that your child can't be there the
entire time because they must attend anoth
er admit weekend, at a school "they are
strongly considering." You are not fooling
anyone, however, by saying the rival school
begins with the letter "H."
You may have many questions about the
academic rigors of our college, but don't
worry, that will not be addressed in the
slightest. We prefer to focus on the aesthetic
side of a university experience, much like a
family restaurant or a theme park would.
Please excuse the construction, currently
most of Stanford's rides are being renovat
ed. And while it is fun for you and your
daughter to pose for a picture with the Tree,
despite what the Tree says, "breakfast with
the characters" does not take place under his
costume.
We offer a rigorous preview of our fine
academic opportunities, vibrant social life,
and nationally renowned athletics by having
your child spend the majority of their time
doing ice breakers. To highlight the varied

groups on campus, from the equestrian team
to the radio station, a capella performances
will be held hourly.
Your child will not be treated based on
the color of their skin, unless they are any of
the following: Jewish, African American.
Hispanic, Latino/a. or Asian American. In
which case, they will be whisked off to cul
tural-focused ice breakers. If they are a fe
male engineer, they will be asked to go to the
Phi Psi house so they may grow accustomed
to being worshipped as a god.
We encourage parents to feel free to drop
by any fraternity house's basement, because
that is where the unregistered party is going
on.'lTirough our elaborate cardinal-red tape
and fear of lawsuits, we have suppressed un
sightly elements of this campus during admit
weekend.Thus, if your child gets drunk or in
jured, our lawyers have assured us it is their
own damn fault. Your tuition money is hard
at work ensuring that the school is not liable
for your child's safety.
Once again, we would like to congratu
late you and your child for your/their
achievements. For every night you've stayed
up with your child to learn something, for
every moment you worried that you should
have just bought a puppy instead, for the
emotional heartbreak, gray hair, and ir
reparable damage on your heart that the ad
missions process has caused you... We ap
plaud you!

Shameless voting plug: Chris encourages
everyone to vote in today's elections. He's vot

Warm Weather Party, and the Band. Send com
