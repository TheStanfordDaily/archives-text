## RESIDENTIAL LIFE Grad students in lurch as housing subsidies end 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Student Housing's decision this
winter to downsize the University's
subsidized off-campus apartments
program has left some graduate stu
dents scrambling to find a place to
live next year.
In late January, many students liv
ing in subsidized off-campus apart

merits — which the University has
provided to help graduate students
finance their housing since 1998—
received letters informing them that
they had to move out by June.
Ilie program was originally in
tended to be a temporary solution to
the skyrocketing prices and high
rents of the Bay Area housing mar
ket during the Silicon Valley dot-com
economic boom. Now that prices

have flattened out. officials believe
students should pay for their own
housing.
"Stanford is in the process of
phasing out this program, as demand
from students is down and off-cam
pus rentals are more affordable than
when the program was started," the
Student Housing Web site reads.
While the entire program was ini
tially scheduled to end in June, Uni

versity officials decided to extend
some of the subsidies until 2009,
when the 600-student Munger Grad
uate Residences are slated to open.
But matters are still not resolved
for 2007-2008. When they announced
in January that they were planning to
downsize the program. Student

Dollies and Stanford Band members perform in White Plaza yesterday to rally support for special fees. Undergraduate and graduate students can vote on
line at ballot.stanford.edu until tonight at midnight.
Housing officials said they could
guarantee housing for a mere 138 stu
dents at the Oak Creek and Stanford
West, two on-campus living options
for grad students. Iliis leaves more
than 400 graduate students in the
lurch.
"1 think that the off-campus subsi
dized housing program should have
been extended until after the comple
tion of the Munger Graduate Resi
dences, so that there would be a con
sistent amount of University-provid
ed housing throughout the transi
tion." said Charles Anderson, presi
dent of Bio Medically Affiliated Stan
ford Students (BioM ASS)
BioMASS, along with other
groups, has worked with the Universi
ty in hopes of achieving a compro
mise.
"We are also concerned about the
long-term issue of volatility in the Sil
icon Valley housing market, and the
negative impact this can have on

Stanford graduate students who
might have to compete for housing
with people making much larger in
comes than they do, as happened dur
ing the dot-com boom," Anderson
added.
Graduate students have brain
stormed about ways to fix the prob
lem.
"1 think the best solution to this
problem would have been to let the
people who were in subsidized
housing stay in their apartments
and to end the program by not rent
ing out places to new students," said
Flo Pauli. a graduate student in ge
netics.
The University has told students
that the program's budget is not suffi
cient to allow for this solution.
Another contentious issue re
volves around furniture. The off-cam
pus apartments were unfurnished,
forcing students who lived in them to
purchase their own furniture. Cam
pus housing, on the other hand, is fully
furnished, so if students who took ad
vantage of the subsidized off-campus
option in the past have to move on
campus, they will have to sell or store
most of their furniture.

"Most of these students were de
nied on-campus housing in the lottery
and were thus given off-campus hous
ing, so they should not be penalized
for having adapted to their circum
stances by buying furniture," Ander
son said.
The furniture issue discouraged
Pauli and her roommate Katie Cun
ningham, a graduate student in bio
logical sciences, from moving back
into on-campus housing.
"We were offered to move back on
campus, but at this point we have ac
cumulated a lot of furniture and there
are no unfurnished apartments for
single students on campus," Pauli
said.
Pauli said persistence is impera
tive in the search for reasonably
priced housing.
"What we learned is that even
though we had to talk to a lot of peo
ple to get this done, we were able to
find a solution," she said. "If you are
proactive and present your case to
Housing, they might be able to help
you. too."
