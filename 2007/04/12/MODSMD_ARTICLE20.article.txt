## Make course evaluations readily available 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
I was disturbed to read [ Monday] that the
results of the course evaluations are not rou
tinely and systematically made available to
the student body.The current policy (or lack
thereof) is ill-considered and indefensible
for a number of reasons. The most obvious
one is that students and their families are
paying over $30,000 a year in tuition (or as
much of that as they can possibly afford) for
the privilege of taking these classes. The
least that Stanford could do—and the mini
mum I think it is morally required to do —is
to make this most fundamental piece of con

sumer information available to students be
fore they spend something like $3,000 on a
class.
Related to this is the difficulty students
have in making informed choices about
classes and professors. Four years go by very
quickly for a Stanford undergraduate. There
are often painful opportunity costs to taking
one course instead of another. In terms of
maximizing the quality and richness of their
undergraduate experience, students should
have as much information at their disposal
as possible.
There is a third reason that should con
cern the University. The public availability

of course evaluation information is an im
portant incentive for professors to do their
best in the classroom and to devote serious
time to their students outside the classroom
as well. Over the last three decades, Stanford
has done a great deal to reward, motivate,
and improve good teaching. But it is easy to
become complacent, and complacency
thrives in the absence of transparency.
Finally, a historical perspective may be
useful here. The requirement that essential
ly every course be evaluated every time it is
offered was one of the principal recommen
dations of a student-faculty Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality appointed by

the ASSU thirty years ago. As the chairman
of that task force, I recall our feeling that the
widespread availability of this information
was an important tool for improving the
quality of teaching and for raising the weight
given to teaching in tenure, promotion, and
salary decisions.That is why we recommend
ed that as much information as possible be
made available to the ASSU Course Guide,
rhat is also why. today, we need the return of
the C ourse Guide as soon as possible.
