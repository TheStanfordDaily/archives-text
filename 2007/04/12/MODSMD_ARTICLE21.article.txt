### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team
enters this week's NCAA Championship
poised to compete for its third national
championship in program history and the
first since 1995.The fourth-ranked squad is
out to improve on a third-place showing a
year ago. when the Cardinal felt it could
have just as easily taken home the title.
But this is a new year, and Stanford re
mains confident that this week is its time to
shine.
"We are prepared," head coach Thorn
Glielmi said."We are well-conditioned and
in shape, so we just have to do our jobs and
be consistent."
However, only two points separate the
top five teams' overall season averages as
they head into the meet, so the title is far
from a lock until the last dismount is made.
"It's any team's competition to win."
Glielmi said "No one has really set them
selves apart from the rest."
Based on their average overall score
this season. 12 teams were invited to this
year's NCAA Championships at Penn
State. On Thursday, the teams will compete
in two separate qualifiers.
Stanford faces five other teams in its
qualifier group: Army Illinois, Michigan,
Ohio State and lowa. The other qualifier
features Temple, Oklahoma, Minnesota,
Nebraska. California and Penn State. The
top three teams from each qualifier ad
vance to Friday's competition, where the
six teams contend for the national champi
onship.
Stanford will need to compete well on
Thursday just to have a shot at the title.

Less than 24 hours later, the Card must
compete again for the championship. But
the quick turnaround does not worry the
team.
"We have trained hard and competed
three days in a row before" Glielmi said.
"We used the conference championships
to do this, where we practiced hard Thurs
day and Friday, and then competed on Sat
urday."
"We have been training even when we
have been tired and not in top condition,"
senior Dylan Carney added. "And we have
been tapering back since [the conference
championships]. We all feel good now. so
three days in a row shouldn't be a problem
for us."
The Cardinal enters the weekend with
several athletes ranked nationally in their
respective events. A defending NCAA
champion. Carney averages more than
three tenths of a point higher than the sec
ond-highest average scorer in the high bar

(9.780-9.400). Junior David Sender is the
defending NC'AA vault champion,and this
year ranks third overall in the event with a
9.160 average. Sender also ranks fourth in
the high bar with a 9.140.
In one of the Cardinal's strongest
events, the still rings, three Stanford com
petitors rank in the nation's top 15. Senior
Alex Schorsch is No. 2 with an average
score of 9.640: Sender comes in at No. 5
with a 9.570: and sophomore Bryant Mad
den rounds out the top 15 with a 9.420.
In the pommel horse, junior Chris
Harper ranks third nationally with an aver
age score of 9.160 and I hidden is ninth with
an 8.750.
Additionally, Sender enters this week
end as the top all-around gymnast in the
country' with an average total score of
54.130.
"It would be great if everything went
smoothly in the meet," Sender said. "But
we know that no team is perfect. We will
have to deal with any problems that arise
— small or big — and not give up at any
point."
Though the Cardinal knows what at
mosphere to expect, one new thing for the
squad is the venue.
Instead of being held in Penn State's
large and spacious Bryce Jordan Center,
the competition has moved to the Recre
ation Hall.The Hall is a considerably small
er facility and perhaps one of the smallest
the team has ever competed at.
"The facility will definitely take some
getting used to." Carney said. "It will be re
ally loud because of the small size, and it
feels like the crowd can touch you as you

State will take some getting used to in the championship.
Among the adjustments is dealing with the noise of the
crowd, which sounds much louder inside the small venue.
are competing. But that shouldn't put
too much pressure on us."
Stanford still hopes there is pres
sure on the other teams. Glielmi said
that because the Cardinal has com
peted a lot this season, his team holds
a slight edge.
"There are teams that have not
had as many competitions as us this
year," Glielmi said. "'lTiat will help us

put pressure on the other teams,
learns have even broken down in the
past because of it. so we can take ad
vantage of that this weekend."
Overall, the Cardinal is confident
in its ability to bring a home a nation
al title.
"It we execute what we have done
in training, we can win," Sender said.
It we go out there and do what we
normally do without any major falls
or mishaps, we will be the team to
beat."
