Stanford men's volleyball caps off its
season with a trip to Honolulu. I lawaii
tomorrow. But the trip won't be a time
to relax. Not only are the final two
matches of the season this weekend
against No. 10 Hawaii, but the Cardinal
is also looking for continuity after two
exciting matches.
Last weekend, the Cardinal (3-23,2-
18 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
managed to capture a victory in the first
game of each match against top-ranked
Pepperdine and No. 12 Southern Cali
fornia, but faltered in the subsequent
games to fall in four in both matches.
"We played some of the best volley
ball that we have played against Pep
perdine last weekend." head coach John
Kosty said. "1 wish that it would have
carried over to the match against USC,
but our passing was our main struggle
against USC."
Stanford surprised Pepperdine (23-
1. 19-1 MPSF) when the Cardinal pro
vided stiff competition in last Friday's
match.
Game one was excellently played
with both teams fighting for each point.
Each team stayed close in score until a
crucial kill by freshman setter Kawika
Shoji tied the score at 27, giving the Car
dinal the necessary momentum to win
the game 34-32.
The next three games were equally
competitive in the beginning stages of
each game,but the Cardinal had trouble
following through to build a lead for the
win. Pepperdine stole three more victo
ries from the Cardinal with scores of 30-

27, 30-26 and 30-25 to win the overall
match.
Freshman opposite Evan Romero
led Friday's match against the Waves by
saturating the court with 22 kills, fol
lowed by junior Matt Ceran's 20 kills.
Sophomore Miki Groppi controlled
ball placement, earning 56 assists. Shoji
proved to be consistent in both defense
and offense with 19 kills and a team
high 14 digs.
Stanford also picked up 16 team
blocks, but was unable to stop Paul Car
roll's 30 kills coupled with a .400 hitting
average.
Hie Cardinal sent off its departing
seniors with an early win in game one at
home, but again could not follow
through in the next three games, falling
to the Trojans (12-13,9-11 MPSF).
Stanford had a great hitting per
formance, delivering a .565 average ver
sus USC's .476, indicating a win was pos
sible for the Cardinal.
To seal the game-one victory, Shoji
scored back-to-back aces at 28-22. help
ing the Cardinal to take the win with a
score of 30-24. Stanford would go on to
fight with a great amount of heart in the
next three games, as each remained
close and was decided during the last
moments of the game. The Cardinal
seniors walked off home court without
a final match win. with scores of 30-24,
27-30,28-30 and 26-30.
Again. Romero proved his consis
tency when he refused to give up and
led the team with 22 kills and a .432 hit
ting average. Shoji's 17 kills and .517 hit
ting average greatly contributed to
Stanford's successes in the match.
