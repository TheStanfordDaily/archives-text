### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After watching yesterday's match, one
would have never guessed that the Stanford
men's tennis team barely makes the cut for the
top 50 teams in the nation. Wednesday after
noon showed a team much stronger than its
No. 50 ranking and subpar win-loss record
would indicate.
The Card (7-13) fought hard and tested No.
19 Pepperdine, but ultimately fell 4-3 to the
Waves. At least Stanford can say it put up a
challenge as an underdog.
Defending NCAA champion Pepperdine
(14-7) won its first team title at Stanford last
May and has followed it up with a successful
season in 2007.The Waves' only losses this sea

dine has won 10 of its last 11 matches, drop
ping only a tight 4-3 loss to No. 4 Baylor earli
er this month.
Although Stanford won the doubles point
in its last four matches, the Cardinal was not
able to do that on Wednesday. Sophomores
Matt Bruch and Blake Muller picked up an 8-
3 win. but the second and third doubles posi
tions dropped their sets 8-5 and 8-4. respec
tively.
With Pepperdine leading 1-0. Muller decid

board. The sophomore blanked his opponent
in the first set and led 5-0 in the second before

with No. 13 Andrew Begemann,
falling 6-4, 6-3. Aware that his oppo
nent was returning to the court after a
two-month hiatus. Begemann used
that to his advantage. The Waves'

opponent,6-4.6-4. Narrowly dropping

"[On Wednesday]. 1 told the guys.
We've had some trouble getting start
ed in singles."' head coach John
Whitlinger said. "We've been getting
behind very early, by one or two
breaks. I told the guys,'l don't want to
look at the board and see us down.'
But, boy. the guys came out and
played really well.and everybody was
even in the first sets.
"We're disappointed because we
thought we could have won the
match," Whitlinger continued. "There
are some positives with Eric. Kevin
and Blake, and the way they played
today, but we still didn't come up with
the victory. We played the defending
national champion right to the wire,
but we all felt that we could have

won."
Yesterday's match marked the start
of the Stanford Challenge, a run of
matches played at the Taube Family
Tennis Center. The team next plays
host to No. 10 UCLA tomorrow and to
No. 8 Southern California on Saturday.
ITie Bruins have only lost three match
es this season (all to top-10 teams), and
the Trojans' lone loss this season came
to top-ranked Georgia in March.
"I think we all felt at one time that
we could win [yesterday's] match,"
Whitlinger said. "And that's the feel
ing we need to have when we go in on
Friday â€” that we have potential to
win the match. UCLA's very good,
and they're deserving of the ranking
they have and the record they have.
There were a lot of positives in [yes
terday's] match, and that's one of
them. It shows our guys that we can
compete with these teams, and we
could have even won this match."
