### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After watching yesterday's match, one
would have never guessed that the Stanford
men's tennis team barely makes the cut for the
top 50 teams in the nation. Wednesday after
noon showed a team much stronger than its
No. 50 ranking and subpar win-loss record
would indicate.
The Card (7-13) fought hard and tested No.
19 Pepperdine, but ultimately fell 4-3 to the
Waves. At least Stanford can say it put up a
challenge as an underdog.
Defending NCAA champion Pepperdine
(14-7) won its first team title at Stanford last
May and has followed it up with a successful
season in 2007.The Waves' only losses this sea
son have come to teams in the top 15. Pepper

dine has won 10 of its last 11 matches, drop
ping only a tight 4-3 loss to No. 4 Baylor earli
er this month.
Although Stanford won the doubles point
in its last four matches, the Cardinal was not
able to do that on Wednesday. Sophomores
Matt Bruch and Blake Muller picked up an 8-
3 win. but the second and third doubles posi
tions dropped their sets 8-5 and 8-4. respec
tively.
With Pepperdine leading 1-0. Muller decid
ed to even the score and put Stanford on the
board. The sophomore blanked his opponent
in the first set and led 5-0 in the second before
closing out the match 6-0,6-3 to even the over
all count to one apiece.
