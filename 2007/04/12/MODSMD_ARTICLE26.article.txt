# SAILING
## Team fights off Yale and frigid temperatures 
### 
The Stanford sailing team trav
eled to Massachusetts this past
weekend arriving to unpleasant
weather conditions, hut leaving
with a pleasing result: a second
place finish.
Sailors felt their exposed hands
freeze at the appropriately titled
Friis and Marchiando regattas this
past weekend. However, the team
overcame the cold weather on Sun
day to move up in the field of 16.
The Card won its first three single
round-robin races that morning on
the Charles River at MIT, where the
temperature hovered around 38 de
grees. Stanford dropped the next two
races, to put the team at 4-2 with a
final run against an undefeated Yale.
The Cardinal needed a win to finish
in the regatta's top three.a Stanford
raced three pairs in the final event:
junior Eddie Conrad with senior
Joanna Madsen;senior Brian Haines
with sophomore Kelly McKenna;
and senior Emery Wager with fresh
man Leigh Hammel. Haines and
McKenna came in first with
Wager/Hammel finishing right be
hind them.
While the Cardinal executed well
for the win. Yales performance also
opened the door for Stanford to fin
ish 1-2. According to
gostanford.com, Yale (who had put
together a 12-3 record on Saturday)
overstood the layline and its crew
later fell head-first out of a chasing
boat. Yale did take the Marchiando
Trophy, as it gained 113 points in the
A division and 206 points in the B di
vision.
On the first day of competition at
Lake Medford in Tufts, Stanford par
ticipated in a double round-robin
against seven schools,including No. 1
Yale. Fighting the weather, harsh
conditions and different boats, the
Cardinal finished the day with an 8-6
mark.
Two weekends ago, Stanford also
had success, albeit much closer to
home. Stanford hosted the St. Francis
Yacht Club Collegiate Regatta at a
breezy San Francisco bay. Hie field
was much bigger too, with 24 coed
and women's varsity teams and 16
junior varsity teams overall.
On the second day of the race,
Apr. 1, Wager and Hammel teamed
up to sail a perfect regatta. The coed
team won every race and finished on
top with a 42-point margin. Howev
er. due to technical issues, both coed
varsity boats (Haines/McKenna and
Wager/Hammel) withdrew from the
final two races.This placed the Cardi
nal in fourth overall, with Southern
California taking the top spot in the
regatta.
The Stanford women finished
third overall, led by Madsen and jun
ior Evan Brown in division A and
sophomore Taylor Grimes and sen
ior Katherine Schlosser in division B.
The Cardinal's junior varsity duos
placed one, two, three among other
JV teams.
Cardinal sailing next prepares for
the Admiral's Cup in King's Point.
New York and the women-only De
lenbaugh in Providence, Rl. Both
events are scheduled for this week
end.
