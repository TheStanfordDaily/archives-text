# A 						reality check for campaigns
## Candidates' vague plans criticized as unrealistic 
### ANDREA FULLER AMIT ARORA DESK EDITORS 
Every year, like clockwork,
ASSU executive slates propose ex
tensive reforms in an effort to en
tice voter support.
These ambitious (and numer
ous) proposals are touted on dorm
flyers, plastered on bathroom stalls
and repeatedly announced in public
campaigning.
Promises are compiled in the
ASSU-published Elections Hand
book to help students better under
stand their candidates and assess
how they might contribute to cam
pus.
But according to a number of ad
ministrators. these published plat
forms are often vague, lacking the de
tails that would allow for an accurate
assessment of campaign promises.
Some University officials even
said that many of the promises made
by this year's executive slate candi
dates were cither already in the works
or completely infeasible.
And Lauren Graham '07, after al
most a year as ASSU vice president,
warned voters to be weary of ambi
tious promises.
"For a number of the candidates,"
she said, "one-third of their platform
has already been done, one-third of
their platform is currently underway
by different departments and one
third of it will never be able to be ac

complished."
Two slates, Brett and Lakshmi and
Aaron Smith and Kyle Ladewig. pro
vide a general description of their
goals on their Web sites but do not ex
plain what progress they have made
in fulfilling them.
The Avula/Jones Web site touch
es on how the slate has worked to
ward achieving the goals men
tioned in its campaign; however,
since it fails to give a detailed ac
count of exactly how the candi
dates' proposals will be accom
plished. it adds to the confusion that
many students say they feel about
how the ASSU actually works.
In about a dozen interviews with
members of the administration and
current student leaders. The Daily
did a reality check of platforms and
found that the plans presented by
the executive slates generally suffer
from a lack of clarity that makes it
hard for administrators and stu
dents to judge their feasibility.
Lack of clarity
Both Avula/Jones and Brett and
Lakshmi target graduate student
diversity as a critical issue in their
campaign platforms. However, Vice
Provost of Graduate Affairs Patri
cia Gumport told The Daily in an
email that assessing the plausibility
of these ambitions is challenging
without specific plans.
"It is difficult to comment on the
feasibility of broad policy direc
tions rather than on specific pro
posals." she said. "That said, I can
tell you that increasing the diversity
of the graduate student population
is a top priority of the VPGE Of
fice."
University Registrar Roger
Printup said that course evaluation
reform — a promise that many of
this year's executive slates have
mentioned in their platforms — is
an ongoing process in his office.
"The results from autumn and
winter quarter have been very en
couraging," Printup wrote in an
email to The Daily. "The response
rate has been excellent, and the sys
tem itself has functioned quite nice
ly, which makes me hopeful that we
can duplicate that success in spring
quarter."
Moreover, Avula/Jones has list
ed bringing back Courseguide as
one of their key academic initia
tives. At last month's Faculty Senate
meeting, however, Printup told the
committee that the University is
considering making the release of

student feedback a "faculty op
tion."
A similar disconnect exists be
tween ASSU executive slates' din
ing proposals and administrators'
responses. In their campaign plat
form, Brett and Lakshmi sought to
"make more flexible meal plans,"
but in an email to The Daily, Execu
tive Director of Stanford Dining
Rafi Taherian said that he already
considers Stanford's plans to be
quite flexible.
"This year, we launched two
other initiatives to create more flex
ibility," he said. "Our student stake
holders, by in large, have been re
ceptive and satisfied with these
changes."
With administrators in a number
of departments touting the success
es of recent programs and their re
sponsiveness to student interests,
many of the platform proposals by
executive slates were overwhelm
ingly viewed as too broad to war
rant significant consideration.
Infcasibility
While administrators deemed
many of the proposals too vague,
they rejected outright the feasibility
of some ideas.
In their online platform, Aaron
Smith and Kyle Ladewig call for
"better late-night dining options
from popular outside vendors."
Taherian expressed doubt, howev
er, about the University's ability to
come through on this promise and
listed a number of complications
that would prevent it from happen
ing.
"The Dining Committee and
previous ASSU executives have
seen and worked on these initia
tives, and chosen against them," he
said. "In the current scenario, I
would see this proposal as extreme
ly challenging to fulfill. As a re
minder, every time services are out
sourced, there will be fewer re
sources available to other programs
and our focus has been to enhance
existing programs rather than re
ducing them."
While Smith and Ladewig struck
out with Stanford Dining, a promise
made by Avula/Jones to improve
faculty diversity was criticized by
Vice Provost for Faculty Develop
ment Pat Jones. In their platform.

Avula/Jones promised to "promote
diversity in all University depart
ments by creating basic, uniform re
cruiting steps for all departments to
take when hiring new faculty."
Vice Provost Jones said this goal
was unrealistic.
"The University does expect
schools and departments to incor
porate efforts to increase faculty di
versity into their faculty hiring ef
forts," she said. "Faculty hiring is
done through a number of ap
proaches. and the challenges to ob
taining diverse applicant pools vary
across disciplines so it is not likely
that there would be a uniform set of
recruiting steps."
Brett and Lakshmi, meanwhile,
said that they will "write a weekly
update in The Daily about what the
ASSU is doing" — a promise that
Ben Eppler '09, managing editor of
opinions at The Daily, said was un
realistic.
"They can abide by the once
every-two-weeks limit for op-ed
submissions like everyone else," he
said.
In light of criticism from admin
istrators and student leaders, next
year's ASSU Executive team —
whoever it will be — will undoubt
edly face roadblocks in implement
ing some of its promises.
Taking Undeserved Credit
In this year's tight election race,
some slates have criticized their op
ponents for making promises that
the administration has already been
working on.
In an interview with The Daily,
which appeared Monday, presiden
tial candidate Hershey Avula "08 ac
cused the Brett and Lakshmi slate
of taking credit for developing a
three-tier housing draw plan that he
suggested has already been in the
works.
"Other slates are putting things
on their platform that's already get
ting done," Avula said. "For us,
that's malicious in its intent because
it's promising something that's al
ready happening and promising to
take credit for it."
But Student Housing Project
Manager Bill Georges refuted
Avula's accusation in an email to
The Daily.
"There is no current plan to im

plement this proposal but the idea
is one that will be discussed," he
said. "No discussion is currently un
derway, and no major changes will
be made to this year's Draw."
Georges also expressed doubt
about potential advantages that a
three-tier draw would bring.
"The idea of a three-tier draw
numbering scheme has come up a
number of times over the years," he
said. "While it has some appeal in
providing more equity in the Draw,
it does make it more difficult for
students to draw in groups across
classes and may result in high con
centrations of students by class in
some residences."
Smith and Ladewig's platform,
meanwhile, proposed creating for
the first time a "comprehensive on
line Cardinal Calendar for cultural,
athletic, social and philanthropic
events." But The Daily has already
been publishing this kind of calen
dar since the beginning of February,
according to Page Two Managing
Editor Kelley Fong '09. Fong said
the paper pulls events from
events.stanford.edu, the Athletics
calendar and an email box managed
by the newspaper (calendar@daily.
stanford.edu).
Director of the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) Norman
Naimark also challenged the claim
in Avula/Jones' platform that the
slate will work on "expanding
Study Abroad Programs (e.g.
Spain. India)," noting that BOSP
already has plans to open a center
in Spain.
"We are planning on opening a
center in Spain — Madrid — next
winter and we will be accepting ap
plications this spring," Naimark
said in an email to The Daily. "It's 98
percent sure on a winter opening.
We would like to try something in
India and are thinking about ways
to do so."
Students must now wait until 5
p.m. tomorrow — when the elec
tion results will be announced in the
CoHo — to find out which slate has
best convinced voters that its poli
cies are not only feasible and clear,
but also beneficial to the campus.

"make more flexible meal plans,"
but in an email to The Daily, Execu
tive Director of Stanford Dining
Rafi Taherian said that he already
considers Stanford's plans to be
quite flexible.
"This year, we launched two
other initiatives to create more flex
ibility," he said. "Our student stake
holders, by in large, have been re
ceptive and satisfied with these
changes."
With administrators in a number
of departments touting the success
es of recent programs and their re
sponsiveness to student interests,
many of the platform proposals by
executive slates were overwhelm
ingly viewed as too broad to war
rant significant consideration.
Infcasibility
While administrators deemed
many of the proposals too vague,
they rejected outright the feasibility
of some ideas.
In their online platform, Aaron
Smith and Kyle Ladewig call for
"better late-night dining options
from popular outside vendors."
Taherian expressed doubt, howev
er, about the University's ability to
come through on this promise and
listed a number of complications
that would prevent it from happen
ing.
"The Dining Committee and
previous ASSU executives have
seen and worked on these initia
tives, and chosen against them," he
said. "In the current scenario, I
would see this proposal as extreme
ly challenging to fulfill. As a re
minder, every time services are out
sourced, there will be fewer re
sources available to other programs
and our focus has been to enhance
existing programs rather than re
ducing them."
While Smith and Ladewig struck
out with Stanford Dining, a promise
made by Avula/Jones to improve
faculty diversity was criticized by
Vice Provost for Faculty Develop
ment Pat Jones. In their platform.

Avula/Jones promised to "promote
diversity in all University depart
ments by creating basic, uniform re
cruiting steps for all departments to
take when hiring new faculty."
Vice Provost Jones said this goal
was unrealistic.
"The University does expect
schools and departments to incor
porate efforts to increase faculty di
versity into their faculty hiring ef
forts," she said. "Faculty hiring is
done through a number of ap
proaches. and the challenges to ob
taining diverse applicant pools vary
across disciplines so it is not likely
that there would be a uniform set of
recruiting steps."
Brett and Lakshmi, meanwhile,
said that they will "write a weekly
update in The Daily about what the
ASSU is doing" — a promise that
Ben Eppler '09, managing editor of
opinions at The Daily, said was un
realistic.
"They can abide by the once
every-two-weeks limit for op-ed
submissions like everyone else," he
said.
In light of criticism from admin
istrators and student leaders, next
year's ASSU Executive team —
whoever it will be — will undoubt
edly face roadblocks in implement
ing some of its promises.
Taking Undeserved Credit
In this year's tight election race,
some slates have criticized their op
ponents for making promises that
the administration has already been
working on.
In an interview with The Daily,
which appeared Monday, presiden
tial candidate Hershey Avula "08 ac
cused the Brett and Lakshmi slate
of taking credit for developing a
three-tier housing draw plan that he
suggested has already been in the
works.
"Other slates are putting things
on their platform that's already get
ting done," Avula said. "For us,
that's malicious in its intent because
it's promising something that's al
ready happening and promising to
take credit for it."
But Student Housing Project
Manager Bill Georges refuted
Avula's accusation in an email to
The Daily.
"There is no current plan to im

plement this proposal but the idea
is one that will be discussed," he
said. "No discussion is currently un
derway, and no major changes will
be made to this year's Draw."
Georges also expressed doubt
about potential advantages that a
three-tier draw would bring.
"The idea of a three-tier draw
numbering scheme has come up a
number of times over the years," he
said. "While it has some appeal in
providing more equity in the Draw,
it does make it more difficult for
students to draw in groups across
classes and may result in high con
centrations of students by class in
some residences."
Smith and Ladewig's platform,
meanwhile, proposed creating for
the first time a "comprehensive on
line Cardinal Calendar for cultural,
athletic, social and philanthropic
events." But The Daily has already
been publishing this kind of calen
dar since the beginning of February,
according to Page Two Managing
Editor Kelley Fong '09. Fong said
the paper pulls events from
events.stanford.edu, the Athletics
calendar and an email box managed
by the newspaper (calendar@daily.
stanford.edu).
Director of the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) Norman
Naimark also challenged the claim
in Avula/Jones' platform that the
slate will work on "expanding
Study Abroad Programs (e.g.
Spain. India)," noting that BOSP
already has plans to open a center
in Spain.
"We are planning on opening a
center in Spain — Madrid — next
winter and we will be accepting ap
plications this spring," Naimark
said in an email to The Daily. "It's 98
percent sure on a winter opening.
We would like to try something in
India and are thinking about ways
to do so."
Students must now wait until 5
p.m. tomorrow — when the elec
tion results will be announced in the
CoHo — to find out which slate has
best convinced voters that its poli
cies are not only feasible and clear,
but also beneficial to the campus.

Every year, like clockwork,
ASSU executive slates propose ex
tensive reforms in an effort to en
tice voter support.
These ambitious (and numer
ous) proposals are touted on dorm
flyers, plastered on bathroom stalls
and repeatedly announced in public
campaigning.
Promises are compiled in the
ASSU-published Elections Hand
book to help students better under
stand their candidates and assess
how they might contribute to cam
pus.
But according to a number of ad
ministrators. these published plat
forms are often vague, lacking the de
tails that would allow for an accurate
assessment of campaign promises.
Some University officials even
said that many of the promises made
by this year's executive slate candi
dates were cither already in the works
or completely infeasible.
And Lauren Graham '07, after al
most a year as ASSU vice president,
warned voters to be weary of ambi
tious promises.
"For a number of the candidates,"
she said, "one-third of their platform
has already been done, one-third of
their platform is currently underway
by different departments and one
third of it will never be able to be ac

complished."
Two slates, Brett and Lakshmi and
Aaron Smith and Kyle Ladewig. pro
vide a general description of their
goals on their Web sites but do not ex
plain what progress they have made
in fulfilling them.
The Avula/Jones Web site touch
es on how the slate has worked to
ward achieving the goals men
tioned in its campaign; however,
since it fails to give a detailed ac
count of exactly how the candi
dates' proposals will be accom
plished. it adds to the confusion that
many students say they feel about
how the ASSU actually works.
In about a dozen interviews with
members of the administration and
current student leaders. The Daily
did a reality check of platforms and
found that the plans presented by
the executive slates generally suffer
from a lack of clarity that makes it
hard for administrators and stu
dents to judge their feasibility.
Lack of clarity
Both Avula/Jones and Brett and
Lakshmi target graduate student
diversity as a critical issue in their
campaign platforms. However, Vice
Provost of Graduate Affairs Patri
cia Gumport told The Daily in an
email that assessing the plausibility
of these ambitions is challenging
without specific plans.
"It is difficult to comment on the
feasibility of broad policy direc
tions rather than on specific pro
posals." she said. "That said, I can
tell you that increasing the diversity
of the graduate student population
is a top priority of the VPGE Of
fice."
University Registrar Roger
Printup said that course evaluation
reform — a promise that many of
this year's executive slates have
mentioned in their platforms — is
an ongoing process in his office.
"The results from autumn and
winter quarter have been very en
couraging," Printup wrote in an
email to The Daily. "The response
rate has been excellent, and the sys
tem itself has functioned quite nice
ly, which makes me hopeful that we
can duplicate that success in spring
quarter."
Moreover, Avula/Jones has list
ed bringing back Courseguide as
one of their key academic initia
tives. At last month's Faculty Senate
meeting, however, Printup told the
committee that the University is
considering making the release of

student feedback a "faculty op
tion."
A similar disconnect exists be
tween ASSU executive slates' din
ing proposals and administrators'
responses. In their campaign plat
form, Brett and Lakshmi sought to
"make more flexible meal plans,"
but in an email to The Daily, Execu
tive Director of Stanford Dining
