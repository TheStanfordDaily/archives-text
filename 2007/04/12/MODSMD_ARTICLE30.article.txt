Dear Reader,
Today we run the fifth issue in
our series of career guides. For
the last six weeks, our business
team has spearheaded a joint
effort with the Career

upon the vast resources of
Stanford University in the produc
tion of this guide. We're proud of
the opportunities and advice out
lined within this special supple
ment. The sectors outlined in this
guide offer many exciting areas
for involvement. We hope this
provides a valuable survey with
ideas for further inquiry.
Sincerely,
James Hohmann
President, Stanford Daily

I recently hud the opportunity to speak with an
experienced professional from the venture fund
arena. He provided me with some great informa
tion that could he critical to your success, if you
are one of those folks thinking of taking the
plunge into the world of startups Here are his
thoughts.
Name: John Cadeddu
Title: Managing Director
Years working in this arena: 12
Company Name: Duff Ackerman & Goodrich
Company Description: Venture Capital Fund
1) Please describe the current business climate in
Silicon Valley for startups.
- It's probably as good as it's been since early
2001 for a startup to raise money. On the other
hand, increased startup activity means it's get
ting more challenging to recruit top level people
to startups and great people make or break a
startup.
Are there certain types of products and/or ser
vices that seem to receive the most funding?
- Internet based businesses appear to be attract
ing more capital than they have in several years.
Is there more funding available now compared
to a year or two ago?

- It certainly feels like more than two years ago
but not much more than a year ago.
2) When considering starting a business, what
are the most critical things to consider?
- You need to get two things absolutely right, a)
a great, big market and, b) right people. If you
don't get the market opportunity right, it doesn't
matter how great the team is. If you get the mar
ket question right, is this the unique team of peo
ple to lead the market?
3) How would someone interested in starting a
business go about finding the right people to pre
sent their proposal?
- It's often best to begin by networking with
other entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley has many
such formal and informal groups and they offer
tremendous support to first-time entrepreneurs.
4) What are the mistakes—the things people do
that cause their startup to fail?
- Three classic mistakes.

"Startups are incredibly hard; forget
about work-life balance - it's a
dysfunctional lifestyle."

a) Mistaking an idea for value. There's no short
age of people with great ideas. It's executing
very well on a great idea that matters.
b) Technology in search of a problem: Don't
assume because your technology can solve a
problem that you should be solving that prob
lem.
c) People. Absolutely, absolutely keep the qual
ity bar high on every hire. Never compromise or
lower the bar.
5) Can you comment on the importance of build
ing and maintaining a professional network and
finding a mentor before/during starting a busi
ness?
It's critical. Mentors save you a lot of time - time
you would otherwise spend making avoidable
mistakes.
6) Any final words of wisdom?
Startups are incredibly hard; forget about work
life balance - it's a dysfunctional lifestyle. On the
other hand, those who thrive in startups would
n't have it any other way.
