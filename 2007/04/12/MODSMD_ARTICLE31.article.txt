Researching Start-ups and
Identifying Opportunities

The very nature of start-up compa
nies—new, small and often deliberately
secretive —makes it difficult to learn
about companies or find opportunities.
The following list includes some helpful
resources for gaining a general under
standing of start-ups, researching com
panies, identifying job opportunities
and networking.
At the Reference Library of the Career
Development Center:

TOPIX news search query "startup"
Press releases and news articles on startup
ventures. Try adding "Silicon Valley" or the
name of another region or city to limit the
search geographically. Be wary: Press
releases are written by the start-ups them
selves and may be self-serving.

Venture Capital Websites:
Another way to discover previously unknown
start-ups is to visit the websites of the venture
capital firms bankrolling them. Many venture
capital firms publish their portfolio of pre- and
post-IPO start-ups. There are many venture
capital firms; the following list shows the port
folios of just a few:
