Venture Capital, Entrepreneurship, and the Operation of
Privately-Held Businesses (Gould : 5 units)
We will discuss (in an economic context) the following
materials in two modules: Venture Capital and Operational
Issues, which inevitably overlap and connect with each
other. By necessity, we will also end up covering some sig
nificant aspects of the laws of each of these areas to the
extent that they inform the economics and/or relevant busi
ness practices. We may, at times, end up in realms that are
distinctly NON-ECONOMIC (e.g. psychology, marketing,
law. personal dynamics, mild engineering, organizational
behavior, common sense.) More than anything else, this
course is supposed to provide some illustration of how the
venture capital and entrepreneurship businesses are
REALLY done, and it would be naive and unwise to pre
tend that economics can explain EVERYTHING, though it
does certainly tell us a good bit or this course would not be

distinctly NON-ECONOMIC (e.g. psychology, marketing,

behavior, common sense.) More than anything else, this
course is supposed to provide some illustration of how the

Venture Capital, Entrepreneurship, and the Operation of
Privately-Held Businesses (Gould : 5 units)
We will discuss (in an economic context) the following
materials in two modules: Venture Capital and Operational
Issues, which inevitably overlap and connect with each
other. By necessity, we will also end up covering some sig
nificant aspects of the laws of each of these areas to the
extent that they inform the economics and/or relevant busi
ness practices. We may, at times, end up in realms that are
distinctly NON-ECONOMIC (e.g. psychology, marketing,
law. personal dynamics, mild engineering, organizational
behavior, common sense.) More than anything else, this
course is supposed to provide some illustration of how the
venture capital and entrepreneurship businesses are
REALLY done, and it would be naive and unwise to pre
tend that economics can explain EVERYTHING, though it
does certainly tell us a good bit or this course would not be
offered in an Economics Department.
