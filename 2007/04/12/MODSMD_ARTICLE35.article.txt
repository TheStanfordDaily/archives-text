# Educator's corner
## 
### 
The STVP Educators Corner website is an internationally recognized resource
for educators who teach students about high-technology entrepreneurship. It is
an online archive of content from the Stanford Technology Ventures Program and
leading entrepreneurship faculty at universities world-wide. This constantly
expanding resource includes an extensive searchable database of video clips of
entrepreneurial thought leaders; reading lists; case studies on high-technology
entrepreneurship; and links to conferences, foundations, and newsgroups that
support entrepreneurship education.
This project has been made possible by a generous grant from the Kauffman
Foundation. The videos are made possible by the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.

The mission of the project is to support and encourage faculty around the
world who teach entrepreneurship to scientists and engineers. The design of the
archive is based on feedback from entrepreneurship educators regarding the
challenges faced when teaching entrepreneurship to engineers and scientists.
The project has three major efforts:
1. To encourage faculty to think about how entrepreneurship should be
taught to engineering and science students.
2. To prepare educational resources from the high-technology industry for
access and reuse by others.
3. To develop an archive of digital resources, and thereby provide access to a
network of resources for entrepreneurship educators.
The project is made possible by a grant from the Kauffman Foundation, and
with collaboration from the Stanford Center for Professional Development. The
Stanford Technology Ventures Program is housed within the Management
Science and Engineering department in the School of Engineering at Stanford
University.
