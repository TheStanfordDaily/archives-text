### APPLYING FOR POSITION By Chaz Kyser 
Sometimes it seems the most you can do is
wish your resume well after you send it off.
But there is something else you can do: make
sure it ends up in the hands of the right per
son. The right hands are the ones that belong
to the person who can say "you're hired."
Sending your materials to the right person is
easy when the job advertisement directs you to
send it to a specific person, but trickier when
you are asked to send it to human resources.
Most large organizations and companies now
have human resources (HR) departments,
which serve as the middle-man between poten
tial employees and the employers. The people
who work in HR are the ones who decide if
your resume merits the consideration of the
person hiring for the position. You take the
gamble of your resume ever getting seriously
looked at when you send it to these well-mean
ing, but career-blocking people.
To overcome this barrier you can find out
who your resume really needs to go to and
send it to them and the human resources
department. Finding out who the real decision

maker is may take a little time and snooping,
but it's worth it. The most direct approach is
by just calling the company and asking who's
who. If that doesn't suit you then browse their
website.
Once you know who your materials should
be directed to you're one step closer to getting
your valuables into their hands. Keep in mind
that just because you sent your resume off
doesn't mean that it was received and
reviewed. Some employers get hundreds of
applications every week and you don't want
yours to be the one that gets lost on the way to
their desk. The following are simple rules to
follow when sending your application materi
als via mail, fax, email, or when delivering
them in person.
By mail: When applying bv mail, print your
resume and cover letter on matching resume
paper. If your line of work requires samples
that can be sent (such as photographs, graph
ics, or news stories), send the samples that
reflect your best work and put your full name
and contact information on them. Send your
materials in an envelope that matches your
resume and cover letter or a paper-sized enve
lope so your materials will be neat when

received. Call the employer two to three days
after they should have received your materials
to make sure they got them, to inquire it they
have any questions for you, and to ask any
questions you may have about the company
(unless you are specifically directed not to
contact the employer).
By Fax: When sending your resume and
cover letter via fax, make doubly sure the
cover sheet is directed to the right person.
Wait a few minutes after you send it to call
and verify that it was received, and that your
materials are in the process of being given to
the person who should review it. It won't hurt
to call later in the day to make sure it got into
the right person's hands, to inquire if they
have any questions for you, and to ask any
questions you may have about the company.
By Email: If you're directed to email your
resume to a specific person, call the person to
verify that it was received a few hours after
you sent it, to inquire if they have any ques
tions for you. and to ask any questions you
may have about the company.
If you are applying online or have no idea who
will receive your resume, call the HR office
and ask someone to check to make sure all

your materials were received.
In Person: Applying in person gives you
the chance to present yourself to a potential
employer and to take a look at your potential
workplace. Call the company and ask when
the owner or manager will he in on the day
you plan to visit. It is a good idea to dress busi
ness casual or in an actual suit. Ask for the
person in charge once you get there, and if
they are not there ask for the next person in
charge. Your goal is to introduce yourself to
someone who has some decision-making
authority when it comes to getting you a job
with the company. If you have to turn your
materials in to someone in human resources,
inquire about their hiring process and how
long it usually takes for materials to be
reviewed. Always be extra nice to everyone
you meet while visiting the company.
