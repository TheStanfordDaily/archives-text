# Interview with Pandora© founder Tim Westergreen
## 
### Pete Borum 
What is Pandora.com?
It's an online personalized radio service, powered
by The Music Genome Project, that allows a person
to easily and quickly create a radio station that
plays just music they like, and it does that by con
necting songs musicologically using this Music
Genome.
Can you describe the Music Genome Project for
me?
Yeah, it's a collection of songs—hundreds of thou
sands—that have been analyzed musically, each
along close to 400 musical attributes. So it's a
musical taxonomy. We have a team of musi
cians—about 50 of them—that listen to songs one
at a time and capture for every song about 400
musica! details, kind of like musical DNA. And
when you create a station on Pandora using a
song or an artist, what's happening is Pandora is
connecting that song's musical DNA with other
songs in the collection and sequencing songs
based on musical similarity.
And how long have you been working on this?
So, I founded the company in December of 1999,
so we've been working on the Genome for a little
over 7 years. Pandora, the service itself, has only
been out a little over a year, but the Music Genome
Project work has been going on since 2000.

So in that time, from the time you first got the
idea to now, how much has your idea
changed?
Well, the underlying idea, in terms of the Genome,
has stayed pretty steady, which is the idea of under
standing music musicologically and then using that
to help people discover stuff, which is the basic
premise of the company. In terms of how it's offered
to consumers —or the business around it—has
changed radically, several times. Our initial busi
ness was actually to license that as a tool for other
companies to use, or for other portals or other
music websites to provide. So intelligent music dis
covery for their consumers. We tried that online.
We tried that actually at record stores through web
enabled kiosks for awhile. And finally we landed on
radio.

Is the original idea that you had for The Music
Genome Project better or worse than what I
can find today on Pandora.com?
I think Pandora is just about the optimal presenta
tion of it. Obviously, there are many features and
things that we will be adding to it to expose more of
the capabilities for our listener, but it's the perfect
use of the Genome. I can't imagine a better one.
When you graduated in '88, there were a lot of
students going into investment banking.
[laughs] I remember that well.
During that period, were you tempted at all to
take advantage of your Stanford degree to land
a high-paying regular job?
No, I wasn't. I didn't have any appetite for that. I
had a big advantage, which was that I didn't have
student loans., so that's something that gave me an
awful lot of flexibility that not every student has. So
that's something to be understood. It gave me the
flexibility to make some choices that I might not
have had if I had a lot of debt that I had to start pay
ing off right away. That was a big advantage for
me. But when I graduated, I didn't really know what
I wanted to do. I had always loved music, and in
college I got deeper and deeper into music, but I
didn't think too far ahead about my career. Just that
when I left school, I knew that I wanted to keep play
ing music, and so I tried to figure out how to do that.
And I took a job as a nanny. That was my first job.

And then went out and played in rock
bands for a long time.
So you must have had some idea
how difficult the world that you
were entering would be. What
motivated you to make that deci
sion anyways?
I think more than anything it was the
pull of music itself. I had a real pas
sion for music. I really loved it. It's
what I longed to do, and what I most
enjoyed doing, and I just HAD to do it.
So my professional choice was more
about figuring out how to do this thing
I had to do. And music itself is a very
competitive profession. It's very hard
to be successful. But when I got start
ed I didn't have a ten-year plan for my
music career. I just wanted to do it, to
enjoy it, to be able to do it full-time, or
close to full-time, to do it the way I
wanted to, so play the way I wanted to
and find good situations to play in. I
didn't really look that far ahead to be
honest. I just made the best decision I
could with what I knew at the time.
And what did your parents say?
They were always pretty supportive. I
think the pressure to find something
sort of more stable or a career that
you would more traditionally associate
with a Stanford degree came internal
ly. The pressure you're talking about,
I started to feel as I got older. Into my
late twenties, and certainly into my
early thirties, I began feeling pressure
myself to have established something.
You know, something that had some
longevity to it. And when I started
Pandora, I was penniless. I was 33 or
34 and I had been doing music for a
long time and it hadn't turned into a
meaningful career. I had been doing
film composing for awhile, so I defi
nitely was feeling the squeeze at that
point.
So what words or adjectives would
you say best describe the path that
you took from graduation to this
point.
What adjectives? Let's see, I would
say improvisational is one. In more

ways than one. I was a jazz musi
cian. I would say uncertain is one
way I would describe my life a lot.
Short-term. I made decisions, pri
marily, on what I really desired to do
at that time. I think that one of my
lenses for my life is that I don't want
to look back and ever regret not hav
ing tried something or I don't want to
look back and say that out of fear for
something, I chose not to try. That for
me would be the most scary of
regrets, because you can't go back
and do it again. So, if I do what I
really like to do, what I really want to
do, what I really love to do, it's hard
to look back and say that that was the
wrong choice. I would say that, in
the last seven years, which have been
a completely different chapter for me,

I would say terrifying is certainly in
there for a while, as our company
struggled for a long time. And now,
ultimately, I would say incredibly
rewarding.
So you graduated in '88. It's 2007
now. Would you say that you could
have predicted how long and diffi
cult the road to success would be?
My life definitely has had different
phases. As far as the musician part of
it, you know being in bands and so
on, I don't think it really surprised me,
that I spent a lot of years working at it,
and not quite turning it into a viable
profession. I can't say that I was super
surprised by that. When I started this
company, somebody said to me, "This

"My life definitely has had different phases. As far as the musican part of it,
you know being in bands and so on, I don't think it really surprised me,
that I spent a lot of years working at it, and not quite turning it into a
viable profession." -Tim Westergreen

is going to be the hardest thing you've
ever done in your life—way harder
than you ever imagined." And I
thought, "Yeah, whatever." And it
was. And it was far harder than I
thought. And it was far more
demanding and stretched me WAY,
WAY more than I ever thought would
happen. It's kind of the way that
women describe having a child: "If
you knew how much it would hurt, you
wouldn't have one, but once you've
had a baby, you're like, 'Oh, I'm real
ly, really glad I did.'" My aunt said to
me, "If women knew how much it hurt
to have a baby, they wouldn't have
one, because they also wouldn't know
how rewarding it is to have a baby."
And I think that probably applies to
this company.

So if you want to understand a
mother's pain, start your own
company?
[Laughs] It's the closest a man will
have to having a baby.
Was there any point when you
were tempted to give up?
Oh sure, yeah. What happened for
me in this company is that there's a
very gradual process of investment.
It's like gambling. You bet and bet
and bet, and you're like, "Ok, I've got
to get my money back, so I'm going to
bet more and more and more," and at
some point you've invested a lot in it,
and once you've done that, and once
you've had a lot of people invest in it,
there's a VERY STRONG pull to keep
going. And I felt an enormous oblig
ation to everybody involved. And
there was definitely a point when I said
to myself, "I'm going to make this hap
pen or die trying. I will leave nothing
on the field." And I think that that's a
sort of natural momentum for an
entrepreneur. And we borrowed a lot
of money from people to do this, both
in cash, and in people volunteering
their time when they weren't getting
paid. And there were times when, if I
didn't have all the obligations, I'm not
sure in hindsight that I can honestly
say that I would have kept going,
because it seemed so difficult and
hopeless at times.
Was there anything other than that
obligation that kept you going?
Yeah, I should not understate this, but
I've always believed in the idea. I've
always thought that it could be a real
ly important thing, that it would have
its day, and that we just needed to
hang on long enough. And I had lit
tle pieces of evidence along the way,
whether it was a company willing to
license it, or some prominent executive
in the field or some commentator real
ly identify how powerful it could be, or
also experiencing the product our
selves and thinking, "Wow, this is real
ly good. I mean, come on, somebody
has to understand that." And there
was enough of that to fuel that flame.

And I've always believed in the idea.
And even when our company was at
its lowest of lows, I could still get up
and rally the company, because I hon
estly believed that we had a future. If
I hadn't believed in it, then there's NO
WAY we could have gotten here.
So when you say "Rally the compa
ny," how many people were you
rallying?
There were varying numbers at varying
times. We grew to be about fifty peo
ple, and that was the group that start
ed to experience the tailspin. And we
went from fifty down to six or seven.
And all along that descent, we had
weekly meetings to update people. So
in front of those various sized audi
ences, I gave that same talk.
And how is Pandora doing right
now?
It's doing fabulously well. It's a com
pletely different experience now.
We're growing like a weed. We're
growing very fast, and we're getting a
lot of positive feedback from the peo
ple who are using it, which is the most
important signal of having built some
thing important. So all the pieces are
starting to fit together. Our revenue is
growing.
And how many people do you
have working for you now?
A hundred.
So running a company that's as
successful is yours right now is a
very obvious measure of success.
In my opinion, though, simply tak

ing the road less traveled and stay
ing on it for almost two decades is
in its own way an even bigger suc
cess story. Looking back over your
journey to this point, which one
are you more proud of?

[Long pause...a little ver klempt]
That's a hard choice. I'm pretty proud
of both of those things. I look back at
what I did during my twenties and I
think, "God, you fool. You could have
done all these things. You could have
done it so much better, so much more
intelligently. There's so much more
you could have done, even when you
were in college." I took so little
advantage of what was available to
me at Stanford, and what was avail
able to a college student, to prepare
myself for the future. And I look back
and say, "Gosh, I really could have
managed my life better." But I think
that everything you do, if you reflect on
it, teaches you something. My strug
gles as an independent artist really
wound up informing my decision to
make the Genome. The fact that it
didn't work out and I ended up being
a film composer for awhile - self
employed, started my own business,
and got really into selling, which
became a very important skill later on.
And I had a modest level of success as
a film composer, but also learned to
start thinking about musical taste, in
terms of musical attributes. That
wound up really being an important
inspiration for the Genome. I think in
hindsight all those things contributed
to what became this company. I feel
very fortunate that this company has
tied a thread through all those experi
ences, but I think to some extent that
everybody does that. If they reflect

"I took so little advantage of what was available to me at Stanford, and
what was available to a college student, to prepare myself for the future.
And I look back and say, 'Gosh, I really could have managed my life
better.' But I think that everything you do, if you reflect on it, teaches you
something." -Tim Westergreen

back, as they go through each phase
of their life, if they're reflective, they
will tie a thread through it. Even if they
do something they hate, that's going
to teach them something when they do
their next thing. So I'm proud of both
of those things, it'd be hard to com
pare them.
And for those students who would
like to work at Pandora after grad
uation, what's the best way to go
about that?
My email is tim@pandora.com, and
I'm always happy to look at resumes
from Stanford students.
