# Interview with Pandora© founder Tim Westergreen

What is Pandora.com?
It's an online personalized radio service, powered
by The Music Genome Project, that allows a person
to easily and quickly create a radio station that
plays just music they like, and it does that by con
necting songs musicologically using this Music
Genome.
Can you describe the Music Genome Project for
me?
Yeah, it's a collection of songs—hundreds of thou
sands—that have been analyzed musically, each
along close to 400 musical attributes. So it's a
musical taxonomy. We have a team of musi
cians—about 50 of them—that listen to songs one
at a time and capture for every song about 400
musica! details, kind of like musical DNA. And
when you create a station on Pandora using a
song or an artist, what's happening is Pandora is
connecting that song's musical DNA with other
songs in the collection and sequencing songs
based on musical similarity.
And how long have you been working on this?
So, I founded the company in December of 1999,
so we've been working on the Genome for a little
over 7 years. Pandora, the service itself, has only
been out a little over a year, but the Music Genome
Project work has been going on since 2000.

So in that time, from the time you first got the
idea to now, how much has your idea
changed?
Well, the underlying idea, in terms of the Genome,
has stayed pretty steady, which is the idea of under
standing music musicologically and then using that
to help people discover stuff, which is the basic
premise of the company. In terms of how it's offered
to consumers —or the business around it—has
changed radically, several times. Our initial busi
ness was actually to license that as a tool for other
companies to use, or for other portals or other
music websites to provide. So intelligent music dis
covery for their consumers. We tried that online.
We tried that actually at record stores through web
enabled kiosks for awhile. And finally we landed on
radio.

Is the original idea that you had for The Music
Genome Project better or worse than what I
can find today on Pandora.com?
I think Pandora is just about the optimal presenta
tion of it. Obviously, there are many features and
things that we will be adding to it to expose more of
the capabilities for our listener, but it's the perfect
use of the Genome. I can't imagine a better one.
When you graduated in '88, there were a lot of
students going into investment banking.
[laughs] I remember that well.
During that period, were you tempted at all to
take advantage of your Stanford degree to land
a high-paying regular job?
No, I wasn't. I didn't have any appetite for that. I
had a big advantage, which was that I didn't have
student loans., so that's something that gave me an
awful lot of flexibility that not every student has. So
that's something to be understood. It gave me the
flexibility to make some choices that I might not
have had if I had a lot of debt that I had to start pay
ing off right away. That was a big advantage for
me. But when I graduated, I didn't really know what
I wanted to do. I had always loved music, and in
college I got deeper and deeper into music, but I
didn't think too far ahead about my career. Just that
when I left school, I knew that I wanted to keep play
ing music, and so I tried to figure out how to do that.
And I took a job as a nanny. That was my first job.
