### Chaz Kyser 
Part 1 of "Working in Corporate America:
Sink or Swim" discussed some of the issues
people tend to have while working in corpo
rate America. The following are tips for suc
ceeding in a corporate environment.
Swimming in the Corporate
Environment
1. Have a Plan: If your goal is to climb the
corporate ladder at the company you're work
ing for then you'll need to know how to climb
it. It may not be a typical straight ladder —
parts of it might be broken off and it may zig
zag. so have a plan before you start climbing.
You'll first need to know what rung on the
ladder you're starting from and how many

steps you need to climb to get to where you
want to he. Find out what the people in the
positions you desire did to get to where they
are. Where did they start on the ladder? How
many years did it take them to get the position
they have? How many times did they get pro
moted'.' Knowing these things will help you
map out a plan to get you to the rung on the
ladder you desire.
2. Get a Career Mentor: Having a career
mentor within your company, someone that is
dedicated to helping you in your career, is crit
ical to your success. Seek out someone with
influence that appears sincere and amiable
when talking to you.
3. Be Better Than the Best: Just "doing
your job" in an atmosphere filled with com
petitive people isn't going to get you one
step up the corporate ladder. Make yourself

the employee that other employees come to
for help, and if possible, who your manager
comes to for advice sometimes. If you're
better than the best, then when the time
comes for a promotion there shouldn't be
one reason why your boss doesn't consider
you first.
4. Learn to Speak Up for Yourself: Your
talent and energy helps keep the company in
business. Speak up if you find you're being
treated differently than other co-workers.
Speak up if you feel excluded; speak up if you
feel other people's biases are affecting you.
Don't let anyone get the impression that you
can be ignored, taken for granted, and not
considered as a valuable employee that
deserves the same opportunities and respect
as everyone else.
5. Develop a Tough Skin: Working in cor

porate America may send you home crying
some days if you don't develop a tough skin
soon after you enter it. The environment isn't
fit for people who can't stand pressure in
many forms. You'll need to he tougher and
more flexible when you walk into work every
day. And you have to adopt the attitude that
you're going to excel in the corporate envi
ronment regardless of any barriers set before
you.
