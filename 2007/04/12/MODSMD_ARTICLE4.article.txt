# "Fair campaign" labels revoked after late emails
## 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Two ASSU Executive slates
and one senatorial candidate
had the "fair campaign" label
removed from their names on
the online ballot last night, as
Elections Commissioner
Bernard I raga '08 considered
revoking the designation from
more candidates amid an ap
parent spate of violations
Thursday.
Candidates and election
observers said the develop
ments raise serious questions
about the soundness of the
new "fair campaign" policies, a
voluntary pledge offered this
year for the first time to candidates
who agree to abide by a strict set of
restrictions. Fraga acknowledged
the system will likely require revi
sion next year.
To hold onto the fair campaign
designation, neither candidates nor
their supporters could send promo
tional emails after the online polls
opened at 12:01 a.m. yesterday.
Although the Brett and Lakshmi
slate, the Aaron Smith and Kyle
Ladewig slate and Senate candidate
Fadi Quran '10 signed the pledge,
they lost their "fair campaign" sta
tus yesterday after emails were sent
advocating for their campaigns. The
Warm Weather Party never accept
ed the terms.
Late last night, Fraga said the
Elections Commission was dealing
with another potential violation by
another executive slate, but he later
said that the candidates in question
(whom he declined to name) were
saved by a loophole.
"Some people have found cre
ative ways to bend the principles
but not break them," he said. "I
can't give details. It would be impli
cating the people who did it, be
cause they know how people bent
the principles."

Fraga added that the loss of fair
campaign status should not auto
matically reflect poorly on the can
didates.
"The loss of the fair campaign
label does not necessarily imply
malicious intent on the part of a
candidate, group or slate," he said.
"It only means that there was a por
tion of the principles that was vio
lated in some way."
Presidential candidate Brett
Mammon "OS — who sent an email
to the Mirrielees House chat list —
said that his action was an uninten
tional slip.
"I emailed my buddy back who
had emailed the Mirrielees list be
fore midnight yesterday,"he said. "I
sent an email that said.'thanks a lot.
keep spreading the good word,
from Brett.' I accidentally clicked
'reply all' instead of 'reply.' Most
lists are closed, but anyone can send
to the Mirrielees list. It was just an
innocent mistake. 1 was just trying
to thank a friend."
"Hopefully, this tiny mistake
won't change any minds." he added.
"Hopefully they've seen us. they've
seen we're running a positive cam
paign and that we've followed
every rule thus far."

Another presidential candidate.
Aaron Smith "08, said his slate lost
its fair campaign status when a
friend sent out an email supporting
his candidacy.
"1 sent an email to my friend say
ing if you send a personal email,
[the recipient is] allowed to send it
to the list they're a part of," he said.
"They're also supposed to do it be
fore midnight. 1 mistakenly forgot
to send it to my friend before mid
night. The guy sent it at seven in the
morning. It's understandable that
he wanted to get the word out. but I
forgot to explicitly tell them that its
not allowed."
"I mostly felt stupid because of
carelessness," he added. "1 forgot to
explicitly tell people. Ninety-five
percent of people don't know un
less they're running for ASSU posi
tions."
Mondaire Jones "09 — who is
part of the Avula/Jones slate, which
had retained its fair campaign sta
tus as of press time — said he and
his running mate had worked hard
to ensure that supporters knew
about restrictions.
"We have made a comprehen
sive effort to inform all of our sup
porters that they were not to send

out any emails to any lists after mid
night last night." he said. "As far as 1
know they haven't, and if anyone
does, they are not an Avula/Jones
supporter and they may be rogue
individuals who may have been told
to do so by another slate."
Fraga said that the fair campaign
principles are new this year and will
require revision for next year, based
on last night's events.
"Next year, we will try and close
those loopholes," he said. "For now.
we will have to run with what we
have in terms of the fair campaign
ing principles and what's enforce
able and what's verifiable."
Fraga said that many unautho
rized email lists were used this year
for campaigning, and candidates
could not technically be indicted.
He also said fair campaign polices
regarding flyering. Facebook cam
paigning and the petition process
will require some tweaking.
"We want a better enforcement
mechanism," he said, "with regards
to University policy to deal with fly
ering issues such as illegal posting
of materials."
