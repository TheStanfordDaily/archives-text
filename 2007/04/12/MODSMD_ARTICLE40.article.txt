As you consider your career
options both from a technical chal
lenge and geographic perspective,
here is a look at some projections
from the Silicon Valley Leadership
Group.
The following information was
taken from "2007 Silicon Valley
Projections, Tough Challenges—
Hopeful Signs."

Leadership Group. To review the

Silicon Valley Industry
Overview
The report covers 40 cities in four
counties: San Mateo, Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz and Alameda. Eight
industries are broken into two
groups:
Primary: the industry clusters that
drive the Silicon Valley economy:
• Technology (High-tech):
Software, Hardware/Equipment,
Internet Commerce
• Life Sciences: Medical
Device/Diagnostics, Biotechnology
• 112 inancial & Professional Services:
Venture Capital, Investment
Banking, Engineering, Consulting
Secondary: those that support the
primary industries—the core com
ponents and their economic activi
ties or the major impacts that
emanate from them:
• General Manufacturing: Food,
Chemicals, Transportation
Equipment, Fabricated Metals,
Machinery
• Telecommunications: Service
Providers
• Utilities: Service Providers
• Education: Service Providers
• Healthcare: Service Providers
These Silicon Valley industries
were compared to those in compet
ing. domestic metro areas: Austin,
TX, Boston, MA, Denver, CO,

Portland, OR, San Diego, CA,
Seattle, WA, Washington, DC.
And, international communities
including Bangalore, India, Berlin,
Germany, Dublin, Ireland,
Grenoble, France, London,
England, Prague, Czech Republic,
Shanghai, China, Singapore, St.
Petersburg, Russia, Stockholm,
Sweden, Tokyo, Japan.
Activities compared included
leadership and strategy, manufac
turing/production, logistics network,
shared services, and customer locus.
Some of the findings you might find
useful:
As innovation within the Valley's
primary industries becomes more
global, competition from domestic
and international communities has
increased. However, no competing
area has a strong advantage across
all value chains.
Key market dynamics for
Silicon Valley are anticipated to
continue to reflect the innovation
focus of the area, including a high
ly compensated workforce and the
availability of venture capital.
Venture capital investments in the
Valley have continued to be four
times that of the closest competing
metro area and commonly
approach the aggregate investment
levels of all competing metro areas
combined. However, global com
petition for skills, cost of living,
limited housing stock, and erosion
in the region's quality of life, will
have an impact on the Valley.
Population and civilian labor lorce
growth are expected to lag lower
cost areas of the country, especial
ly in the South and Southeast. An
additional limitation to future
competitiveness is the relatively
low number of housing units in
relation to the number of house
holds. Additional housing stock
within a reasonable commute of
employment centers within the
Valley will be key to attracting and
retaining talent within the region.
Data shows Silicon Valley's core
strengths are in the innovation, cre
ativity and product and service
development at the front-end of the
value chain, which drive the success
and global eminence of its primary

industries. Silicon Valley stands out
compared with leading global inno
vation centers for having diverse
strengths, significant competitive
advantages across several value
chain segments in both technology
and life sciences.
This strength is a function of the
high talent that resides in the
Valley, its significant agglomeration
of companies large and small, the
Bay Area's leading engineering and
science programs at its world-class
universities, and a highly unique
spirit and culture of innovation that
exists in the high technology, life sci
ences and other sectors.
In the startup and adolescence
phases of a company, innovation
and the creation of products and
services drive its success. Things
like manufacturing, production, dis
tribution, shared services and cus
tomer support are developing plat
forms which support the launch of
the new product. Some are out
sourced, some grow and mature
internally.
In the Bay Area, with its high
cost structure and the business cli
mate that has evolved, many compa
nies have been forced to explore
reducing the size of these functions
through reengineering, outsourcing
or redeployment.
The next wave is sourcing engi
neering and higher skilled talent to
other geographies. Companies are
diversifying their talent and innova
tion through the development of
centers in key technology centers
across the globe, in both established
and emerging locales.
Silicon Valley has the breadth
and depth of the best in technology
talent. It also has a high cost of liv
ing, limited housing choices, degrad
ing education, and unbearable com
mutes. It is becoming difficult to
retain and attract talent to the
Valley.
