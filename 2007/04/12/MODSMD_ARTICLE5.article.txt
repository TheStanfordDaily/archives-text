For the past eight years, the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) has brought "cool"
to campus in the form of the Cool Products
Expo; this year's version of the annual event
took place yesterday at the Arrillaga Alumni
Center, where more than 1,200 people gath

innovative new products and their inventive
pioneers.
The products ranged from Repel-Em
garbage bags that keep insects and animals
away from trash to a wireless remote-con
trolled skateboard by Exkate to the Joby Go
ri 11 apod camera tripod.
"We hope that [the Expo] will encourage
students from Stanford as well as other local
students to consider careers in product design
and manufacturing." said John Aney, assistant
director of Alliance for Innovative Manufac
turing, which co-sponsored the event.
Despite claims that developing countries
like China and India are supplanting the Unit
ed States in the manufacturing sphere, Aney
claims that product design and innovation are
still "alive and well" in the U.S. and in Califor

the most 'cool' products coming out

sometimes even built right here in
the Bay Area." he said.
This year's Expo was defined by a
high number of cutting-edge
"green" products designed for envi
ronmental sustainability, like the
solar-powered backpacks Quantys
presented.
"One of the themes this year was
green technology because of the in
creased interest on campus about
the environment and sustainable so
lutions in product design," said
David Abramson MBA '07,c0-pres
ident of the Product Design and
Manufacturing Club.
Exhibitors expressed their grati
tude to event organizers for allowing
them to increase the visibility of
their products.
"The Expo allows us to gauge
consumer reactions, to improve
presentation of our technology and

to meet people at Stanford for possi
ble future collaboration," said Greg
Hyver, vice president of marketing
at NeuroSky.a company that designs
biosensors.
The Expo also featured student
work. For example, d.light, a compa
ny formed recently by Stanford
MBAs and engineers, is developing
lighting and power solutions for the
1.6 billion people in the world who
lack access to electricity.
"'lTie Expo is a great way to get
the word out about our products that
will be an affordable solution for
rural families in developing coun
tries." said NedTozun MBA '07.c0-
CEO of d.light.
Palo Alto High School students
were also at the Expo showing off
their head-mounted, remote-con
trolled device designed for quadri
plegics.
"We have been able to generate
greater awareness for our work and
new ideas [at the Expo]." said Nick
Clayton, a member of the nearby
high school's robotics club.
