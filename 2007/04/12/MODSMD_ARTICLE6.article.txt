### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Forty students from China and across the
United States arrived on campus Sunday for a
student conference on IJ.S.-China relations.The
hope of the weeklong event is simple: Network
ing and cultural awareness between the future
leaders of two great powers will foster amicable
relationships between China and the United
States decades down the road.
"On Common Ground 2(X)7" is the product
of the Forum for American-Chinese Exchange
at Stanford (FACES), which was founded in
2001 in response to the international incident
following the downing of an American spy plane
on Chinese territory, according to FACES pres-

Jessica Chen Weiss "03 was study
ing in Beijing at the time and started
the group as a response to the
heightened tension, misunderstand
ing and suspicion caused by the inci
dent.
"The impetus" Chadha said,"was
to bring together future leaders on a
grassroots level so that if such a thing
was to happen down the line we could
sidestep any unnecessary misunder
standings."
"As an organization," he said, "its
mission is to bring the future leaders
of the United States and China to
gether today, so that 10, 15, 20 years
down the line, when they all go places
and mature as leaders, based on this
forum they can better U.S.-China re
lations because they all know each
other and because of the tight net
work we've created."
Drew Camarda '08. director of re
cruiting and publicity for FACES,
said program applicants were vetted
through a rigorous selection process
that whittled the delegate pool down
from 850 applicants to 40.
"This was our most successful year
in terms of applications," Camarda
said. "There was an application in
crease of 250 over last year.

Wynn Tanner '07, director of
American recruiting for FACES, said
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents across a wide range of academ
ic fields, as well as students from Tai
wan and 1 long Kong, are represented
among this year's delegates. Four are
Stanford students.
This week's conference at Stan
ford is the first of a two-part series.
The second installment will take
place in November at Beijing's Ren
min University, one of three FACES
chapter universities in China.
"We're excited to have the confer
ence there," said Director of Chinese
Recruiting Randy Yang. "This is the
first time that that chapter has hosted
the event."
After a week's worth of activities
— including formal debates, lectures
and panels as well as social mixers
and an Iron Chef competition — del
egates will go to San Francisco and at
tend a closing banquet back on cam
pus tomorrow before they check out
Saturday morning.
"The week has been thrilling for
us because it's a culmination of all our
work," Chadha said. "The amazing
people we've been reading about are
actually here in the flesh. They have
great opinions to share and it's fun to
sit in any event we have to see them
engage each other. We're really mak
ing an impact."
