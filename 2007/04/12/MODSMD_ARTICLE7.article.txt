# STUDENT GROUPS
## Roosevelt sponsors policy SIC Group collaboration to be focus of revamped course 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
I"hc Stanford chapter of the Roosevelt Insti
tution convened its "Public Policy 5351" stu
dent-initiated course for the second time'llies
day night, a revamped version of the autumn
quarter course that aims to develop beginning
students' policymaking and writing skills
through team-oriented tasks.
The course is focused on engaging students

in the policy process by putting their ideas into
practice. Organizers said this quarters class
will place less emphasis on advanced, individu
alized policymaking topics in favor of a more
introductory,group-oriented curriculum.
"The offering in the fall was much more in
dependent study, said hric Mitzenmacher '08,
president of Roosevelt at Stanford. "Primarily
it was students working on their own policy
ideas in their own fields. We decided, this term,
to go in a little bit of a different direction and
bring in sponsored projects and tailor the
course more towards students who hadn't had
much policy experience.They're going to learn
the basics of policy writing and poli
cy research while working closely
with the project sponsors."
The once-a-week, two hour
course has two distinct parts: the first
hour will he a writing workshop in
the form of an interactive lecture,
while the second hour will be devot
ed to group projects in one of the
class' two policy concentrations.
According to Roosevelt Policy
Coordinator Leslie Finger '07. the
organization has been approaching
national issues like oil dependence,
socioeconomic diversity on college
campuses and supporting working
families from a local angle. I"he
course will reflect Roosevelt's more
localized approach.
Mitzenmacher hopes that a local

perspective will help students make
a more substantive impact on policy.
"What we've tried to do through
out the campus groups is create a
policy body as a whole," he said.
"We're also trying work to take ad
vantage of Stanford's comparative
advantages, and for the most part
those aren't with national policy,
they're with working with state and
local leaders. We're tailoring our im
pact towards local issues where we
can get some real traction on the
ground."
As such, the group is working in
conjunction with Santa Clara Coun
cilwoman Jamie McLeod to promote
renewable energy.
"[Courtcilwoman McLeod is ]
bringing in a project of renewable
energy to Santa Clara," Mitzen
macher said. "Santa Clara has its
own power utility and that gives
them more flexibility when it comes
to innovating in terms of green ener
gy use. There is already a plan in

place to transition to 10 percent re
newable energy by the end of 2008.
Our project with [McLeod] is to fig
ure out what incentives could be put
into place to get citizens of Santa
Clara to commit to that 10 percent,
specifically focusing on home solar
initiatives."
The institution will also work with
the Admissions Office and Dean of
Admissions Richard Shaw to re
search lifestyle differences between
students of varying socioeconomic
backgrounds.
Specifically, policy groups will
focus on housing differences and on
campus job opportunities.
"We've done a lot to get people
here, but are we doing enough to
make their experiences equitable
once they're on campus?" Mitzen
macher asked. "We're working to
narrow the gap."
