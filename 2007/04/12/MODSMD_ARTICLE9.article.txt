## Staying alive How to dominate dormmates in Assassins 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When the endlessness of spring quarter sunshine be
gins to border on bland, there's nothing quite like a touch
of paranoia to awaken your senses. Come Assassins sea
son, every shadow on the wall begins to resemble the kid
from room 310. Dining halls become minefields. And
those dinky plastic water guns you used to get in goodie
bags? They're not so cute anymore.
Thanks to the annual game of Assassins, in which water
gun-equipped residents must squirt — "kill" — fellow
dormmates in a battle against elimination, many Stanford
students will soon find their lives entirely transformed in
the fight for survival.To win the game, assassins must suc
cessfully squirt their target within 24 hours of assignment,
or else super-soaking terminators will ruthlessly track
them down for removal. For some, the game is a welcome
distraction from yet another quarter of difficult classes.
For others, though. Assassins is a way of life; the chronic
struggle to survive induces more anxiety, terror and sleep
less nights than a chem midterm. Luckily, for those of you
in the second category, past champions and on-campus
Assassins experts shared their wisdom with The Daily, of
fering you five proven ways to outlast your dormmates
until the triumphant end.

1. Be unpredictable.
If you're tired of your daily route to lecture, now would
be a good time to change it. According to a number of As
sassins experts, the best way to defend yourself is not neces
sarily to hide, but to make it impossible to anticipate your
whereabouts.
"My basic strategy," explained Shane Combest "07, a
two-time winner in Roble,"was just never to be predictable.
Never let your assassin know where you are. [because] if you
become predictable you become easy to ambush. Even with
bodyguards you are unsafe; a gun inside a sleeve will render
witnesses useless. Travel alone, travel unusual routes, and
don't trust anyone."
Like Combest. Joshua Resa '09 never divulged his
whereabouts.
"I always took a new route when traveling across cam
pus," he said. "I was fairly secretive, and I never told people
where 1 was going."
Resa finished in the final three in Freshman-Sophomore
College last year, and attributed his secrecy to his Assassins
success.
As a way to avoid a run-in at the salad bar you habitual
ly visit twice a day. take advice from Gavin Jenkins '08, who
made it to the finals in Freshman-Sophomore College his

freshman year.
"Take this oppor-

tunity to sample the
many restaurants and

cafes on campus for food
that you never got around to trying out before this," Jenkins
advised. "Dozens of kills happen at dining halls."
Jenkins is likewise a master of an unpredictable offense:
"Killing anybody while suspended from wooden timbers
above their head and scoping them out with a handheld mir
ror is just an immensely satisfying experience, I must say."

2. Work in pairs.
In a world where few can be trusted, it helps to have a
friend around to watch your back.

Explained Jenkins, "teamwork allows cover tactics on
corners and blind turns, it allows a point man to flush out
any hiding assassins at each others' classes (an assassin is
very unlikely to show up at the class of his victim's part
ner), and if you should end up with each other as tar-

gets. then the one further down the chain can take
all kinds of risks without worrying about any-

body assassinating them, which makes a pair
nearly invulnerable as long as they have
their wits about them."

At the same time, the allure of
victor)' could easily lead a seeming
ly loyal partner astray. This brings
me my next point:

3. Be paranoid.

"Don't trust anyone," advised
Jenni Sloat '08. who defeated all of
her Donner dormmates her fresh
man year." 1 know of so many peo-

pie who got sold out by their
friends, or more often, by their room
mates."

"Some people took too many chances,"
continued Sloat, citing lone trips to class or the
bathroom. "It's those short trips down the hallway

that can really be fatal. Just because you see a group of
people around doesn't mean you are safe; people can get
whole groups to close their eyes or turn around on cue so
they can get a kill. Be very suspicious of small gatherings
of people, especially if they are friends of someone who
might be after you."
There are other "extreme likelihood threats" that
Jenkins urged players to take seriously. "Pay attention to
rooftops, glance at tree limbs, expect every door to be
slightly ajar with a gun in it. including near your classes,
park your bike in somewhat secluded but open areas
[and] use cover tactics on blind corners," he advised.
Be careful, too, for what Jenkins calls "cheap psycho
logical tricks." along the lines of "Help me carry these
books," or "Help me kill this other guy." In the ruthless

world of Assassins, being a good
Samaritan can easily backfire.
4. Do your research.
Resa offered a simple summary of
his strategy: "I basically just tried to
find out where people would be, and
1 got there first."
Van Kou Khang 08, who made it
to the finals in Donner his freshman
year, offered similar advice. "The
main tactic [is knowing] the daily
routine of your assigned target and
catching them when they least expect
it."
Resa and Khang may make it
sound easy, but a significant amount
of planning goes into anticipating a
target's whereabouts.
While a traditional approach
might be to research someone's

class and activity schedule, Jenkins
urged players to "consider inferring
schedules from sources like things
hanging on the person's door, their
Facebook interests, their majors,
etc. — not necessarily only the ob
vious things."
For serious players, Sloat offered
a far more meticulous strategy.
"I had Post-it notes all over my
desk: lists of people I knew were or
weren't playing, a circle of who had
what target continually changing as 1
got new information and, as people
died off, who was my ally and who I
should watch out for," she divulged.
5. iiu all in.
Above all, you've got to be in it to
win it.
"If you want to win," revealed
Combest, "you have to learn to give
up little things. You have to go in
ready to ditch class and your friends."
Other ruthless veterans agree;
when survival is on the line, silly
things like sleep, grades and loyalty
become secondary. While sleep debt

can be replenished, homework
grades recovered and friendships
repaired, a squirt gun death is ab
solute.
According to Jenkins, "the best
people tend to fall as a result of ex
ternal forces disrupting their sched
ule or through sheer atrophy and ex
haustion. 1 got out last year due to it
being Parents' Weekend and having
to do things with my parents who
were staying in a hotel, involving
lots of unnecessary and vulnerable
trips."
In the simple words of Resa,
"grades don't matter. Just win."
And since everyone can't win.
there's something to be said even for
the student who puts his heart and
soul into losing.
"Be creative and make it look
good as you die trying." advised
Sloat.'Once you get far enough, you
just have to go all in or else it's not
worth it."

"I always took a new route when traveling across cam
pus," he said. "I was fairly secretive, and I never told people
where 1 was going."
Resa finished in the final three in Freshman-Sophomore
College last year, and attributed his secrecy to his Assassins
success.
As a way to avoid a run-in at the salad bar you habitual
ly visit twice a day. take advice from Gavin Jenkins '08, who
made it to the finals in Freshman-Sophomore College his

freshman year.
"Take this oppor-

tunity to sample the
many restaurants and

cafes on campus for food
that you never got around to trying out before this," Jenkins
advised. "Dozens of kills happen at dining halls."
Jenkins is likewise a master of an unpredictable offense:
"Killing anybody while suspended from wooden timbers
above their head and scoping them out with a handheld mir
ror is just an immensely satisfying experience, I must say."

2. Work in pairs.
In a world where few can be trusted, it helps to have a
friend around to watch your back.

Explained Jenkins, "teamwork allows cover tactics on
corners and blind turns, it allows a point man to flush out
any hiding assassins at each others' classes (an assassin is
very unlikely to show up at the class of his victim's part
ner), and if you should end up with each other as tar-

gets. then the one further down the chain can take
all kinds of risks without worrying about any-

body assassinating them, which makes a pair
nearly invulnerable as long as they have
their wits about them."

At the same time, the allure of
victor)' could easily lead a seeming
ly loyal partner astray. This brings
me my next point:

3. Be paranoid.

"Don't trust anyone," advised
Jenni Sloat '08. who defeated all of
her Donner dormmates her fresh
man year." 1 know of so many peo-

pie who got sold out by their
friends, or more often, by their room
mates."

"Some people took too many chances,"
continued Sloat, citing lone trips to class or the
bathroom. "It's those short trips down the hallway

that can really be fatal. Just because you see a group of
people around doesn't mean you are safe; people can get
whole groups to close their eyes or turn around on cue so
they can get a kill. Be very suspicious of small gatherings
of people, especially if they are friends of someone who
might be after you."
There are other "extreme likelihood threats" that
Jenkins urged players to take seriously. "Pay attention to
rooftops, glance at tree limbs, expect every door to be
slightly ajar with a gun in it. including near your classes,
park your bike in somewhat secluded but open areas
[and] use cover tactics on blind corners," he advised.
Be careful, too, for what Jenkins calls "cheap psycho
logical tricks." along the lines of "Help me carry these
books," or "Help me kill this other guy." In the ruthless

world of Assassins, being a good
Samaritan can easily backfire.
4. Do your research.
Resa offered a simple summary of
his strategy: "I basically just tried to
find out where people would be, and
1 got there first."
Van Kou Khang 08, who made it
to the finals in Donner his freshman
year, offered similar advice. "The
main tactic [is knowing] the daily
routine of your assigned target and
catching them when they least expect
it."
Resa and Khang may make it
sound easy, but a significant amount
of planning goes into anticipating a
target's whereabouts.
While a traditional approach
might be to research someone's

class and activity schedule, Jenkins
urged players to "consider inferring
schedules from sources like things
hanging on the person's door, their
Facebook interests, their majors,
etc. — not necessarily only the ob
vious things."
For serious players, Sloat offered
a far more meticulous strategy.
"I had Post-it notes all over my
desk: lists of people I knew were or
weren't playing, a circle of who had
what target continually changing as 1
got new information and, as people
died off, who was my ally and who I
should watch out for," she divulged.
5. iiu all in.
Above all, you've got to be in it to
win it.
"If you want to win," revealed
Combest, "you have to learn to give
up little things. You have to go in
ready to ditch class and your friends."
Other ruthless veterans agree;
when survival is on the line, silly
things like sleep, grades and loyalty
become secondary. While sleep debt

can be replenished, homework
grades recovered and friendships
repaired, a squirt gun death is ab
solute.
According to Jenkins, "the best
people tend to fall as a result of ex
ternal forces disrupting their sched
ule or through sheer atrophy and ex
haustion. 1 got out last year due to it
being Parents' Weekend and having
to do things with my parents who
were staying in a hotel, involving
lots of unnecessary and vulnerable
trips."
In the simple words of Resa,
"grades don't matter. Just win."
And since everyone can't win.
there's something to be said even for
the student who puts his heart and
soul into losing.
"Be creative and make it look
good as you die trying." advised
Sloat.'Once you get far enough, you
just have to go all in or else it's not
worth it."

When the endlessness of spring quarter sunshine be
gins to border on bland, there's nothing quite like a touch
of paranoia to awaken your senses. Come Assassins sea
son, every shadow on the wall begins to resemble the kid
from room 310. Dining halls become minefields. And
those dinky plastic water guns you used to get in goodie
bags? They're not so cute anymore.
Thanks to the annual game of Assassins, in which water
gun-equipped residents must squirt — "kill" — fellow
dormmates in a battle against elimination, many Stanford
students will soon find their lives entirely transformed in
the fight for survival.To win the game, assassins must suc
cessfully squirt their target within 24 hours of assignment,
or else super-soaking terminators will ruthlessly track
them down for removal. For some, the game is a welcome
distraction from yet another quarter of difficult classes.
For others, though. Assassins is a way of life; the chronic
struggle to survive induces more anxiety, terror and sleep
less nights than a chem midterm. Luckily, for those of you
in the second category, past champions and on-campus
Assassins experts shared their wisdom with The Daily, of
fering you five proven ways to outlast your dormmates
until the triumphant end.

1. Be unpredictable.
If you're tired of your daily route to lecture, now would
be a good time to change it. According to a number of As
sassins experts, the best way to defend yourself is not neces
sarily to hide, but to make it impossible to anticipate your
whereabouts.
"My basic strategy," explained Shane Combest "07, a
two-time winner in Roble,"was just never to be predictable.
Never let your assassin know where you are. [because] if you
become predictable you become easy to ambush. Even with
bodyguards you are unsafe; a gun inside a sleeve will render
witnesses useless. Travel alone, travel unusual routes, and
don't trust anyone."
Like Combest. Joshua Resa '09 never divulged his
whereabouts.
