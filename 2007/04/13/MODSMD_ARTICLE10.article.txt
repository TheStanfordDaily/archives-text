### ANDREA FULLER EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITERS 
Forty percent of all students voted in this
week's ASSU election, according to initial inter
nal estimates obtained by The Daily after polls
closed at midnight this morning. In a record
turnout,ss.4 percent of undergrads voted. Ol the
5,848 students who cast online ballots, 2,248 were
graduate students and 3,600 were undergrads.
Results will not be announced until 5 p.m. at
the CoHo, but with the race behind them, some
slates looked back on the challenges and high
lights of an intense campaign week.
Brett Hammon '08 said his slate worked to
shed a positive light on ASSU candidates.
"A lot of people assume that everyone in
volved in the ASSU is a tool," he said."And while
this is a pretty safe assumption most of the time,
there are a good 15 percent of us who are not.
"I'm glad that 1 don't have to watch my mouth
anymore," he added."When 1 would cuss around
voters, Lakshmi [Karra '08] would snap at me.
'Brett, you can't say that shit in public.'"
Mondaire Jones '09 said he and his running
mate Hershey Avula '08 worked hard to main
tain their integrity in the election.
"We're proud of the fact that we ran a clean,
fair campaign in accordance with the rules that
we committed to following earlier last quarter,"

he said. "We hope that voters will realize that
we're the best candidates for the job."
"There's little else we can do at this point; our
platforms have been presented to the student
body," he said. "Despite misrepresentation m
publications like The Stanford Daily, we hope
that students will be able to sift through the plat
forms to distinguish the good platforms Irom
those that aren't as good."
Hammon added on a more serious note that if

his slate lost, he would like to discuss his ideas
with the winner.
"As similar as everybody's platforms are, each
slate has a few original, good ideas too." he said.
"And the whole school would benefit from a lit
tle post-election cooperation in that area."
Kyle Ladewig'OSsaid he had "a lot of fun run
ning." but was disappointed in some of the other
