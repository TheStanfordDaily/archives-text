Theatrical Society kicks off its an
nual spring production.
Director Merritt Forrest Baer
"07 called award-winning composer
Andrew Lippa's score "seductively
written, both deeply complex and
compellingly sensual."
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
sorted through 1,500 musicals he
fore selecting "The Wild Party."
"The show is rarely produced
due to its musical and technical
complexity, but Ram's I lead decid
ed to embrace this challenge and
has taken student theatre at Stan
ford to the next level," Producer
Cindy Prieto '07 wrote in an email
to Hie Daily.
The production staff began
working on the show last spring, and
cast auditions were held in early
January. While they said the play
has been laborious and time con
suming. the cast and crew said the
show's production has been re
warding.
"It takes an incredible amount
of work from many people in order

to put on a professional production
of as high quality as 'The Wild
Party,"' Prietosaid. in fact.much of
the cast and staff spent their spring
breaks in MemAud building one of
the most impressive sets the Stan
ford campus has ever seen â€” vari

ous parts of the set actually move
mechanically during the show."
Ram's Head also improved the
acoustics of Memorial Auditorium
