Campus will he flooded with
thousands of locals Sunday as the
University hosts its fifth annual
Community Day. More than 50 stu
dent organizations and campus de
partments plan to host activities for
visitors in the day-long event,
which will begin at 10 a.m. and end
at 4 p.m.
Executive Director of Stanford
Events Elaine Enos said that Com
munity Day is based on one of Le
land Stanford's goals for the Uni
versity.
"One of the important things to
be taught in the institution is co-op
eration." Stanford wrote in a letter
to David Starr Jordan, the Univer
sity's first president.
Enos. who is helping organize
the event, described it as a way to
connect the campus with the sur
rounding community.
"[lt's] an opportunity for our
neighbors to meet with faculty,
staff and students and to learn
more about these departments and
what Stanford students are doing
and learning on campus," she said.
"The event is designed to promote
partnerships and increase under
standing between Stanford and its
neighbors."
This year's version of the annu
al event will feature several new
activities, including guided tours of
the Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve and a climate change panel.
The Student Organizing Commit
tee for the Arts (SOCA) will once
again host "An Art Affair," which
will feature both visual art and live
performances, highlighted by a
3:30 p.m. performance by interna
tionally renowned Taiko artist
Kenny Hndo in White Plaza.
"This year we are looking to in
crease the diversity of our offer

ings with some new educational
programs concerning issues facing
our community and world," Enos
said.
Community Day will also fea
ture the Founder's Celebration,
which commemorates the Univer
sity's founding. One student speak
er — who is selected after a com
petitive application process — is a
central part of the annual celebra
tion. This year's winner, Andrea
Fuller 09, who is also an editor at
The Daily, said she was honored by
the prospect of representing the
University at the event.
"1 am going to be using quotes
from Leland Stanford Jr. and talk
ing about how we should look to
the past both in Stanford life and
our own life," Fuller said. "I really
have learned a lot from both my
past and present. And I think the
University can do the same by
looking back to its founding."
