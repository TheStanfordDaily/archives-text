## Editorial Board Continue to improve ASSU Web infrastructure 
### 
For voters during campaign week and
groups and candidates in the registra
tion process, one of the most impor
tant resources is the main ASSU election
Web site: elections.stanford.edu. Here,
prospective candidates can access detailed
election requirements, voters can read the
ASSU election handbook for a quick guide
to candidates and issues and the curious can
study a concise description of what exactly
each elected office entails.
In many ways, this website is an excellent
clearinghouse of all election related materi
als and is, therefore, an effective way of
streamlining the election process. Its weak
ness is that few alternatives exist. Because
the site is so central to the ASSU electoral
process, when it is out of commission, all of
the information it contains becomes much
more difficult to access. This is particularly
problematic, if. as happened Sunday, the site
is down during election week itself.
Overall, the incident was relatively
harmless. According to ASSU election com
missioner Bernard Fraga, the outage was
due to a problem with the ASSU server. All
ASSU sites were down for several hours,
but the problem was "quickly resolved," and
Fraga says he received no complaints. Fraga
was also adamant that, although the voting

process itself is online through another
ASSU site (ballot.stanford.edu), there are
safeguards in place against both technical
breakdowns and attempted manipulation.
In any extreme situation,such as an earth
quake or complete freeze during voting, it is
likely that elections would simply have to be
rescheduled.
As California begins an overhaul of its
electronic voting procedures in order to
make sure elections run as smoothly as pos
sible. it would not hurt Stanford and the
ASSU to do the same. With both Florida
and Maryland switching to election ma
chines that have paper as well as electronic
records, worries about an all-electric system
are understandable.
It is a positive sign that the elections this
week were relatively routine and that we
have existing safeguards. It is also important
to note that the ASSU elections are small
scale and are much easier to set up and pro
tect than hundreds of statewide voting ma
chines. especially since voters are already
registered through their SUnet IDs.
Nevertheless, there is room for improve
ment. Making sure that all ASSU — and
election-related sites are operational during
the campaign week would be an excellent
start.
