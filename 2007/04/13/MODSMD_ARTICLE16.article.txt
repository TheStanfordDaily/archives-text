America is a strange place. It's full of
strange people doing strange things
in a strange way- It may be very hard
for you to recognize this (I mean, it's hard
for me, so it must he even tougher for you
guys), but it's true.
Now, one of the odd things that happens
to you after you've lived in a foreign coun
try for awhile is that it starts to feel like
home. The bizarre cultural foibles that one
previously mocked become one's own. and,
as such, they are objects of tender affection
rather than derision.
As a result of this, the US of A only re
veals its eccentricities when I have guests.
Then, faced with a fresh pair of eyes, all its
weirdness comes back to me. Whilst there
are many oddities of Americana that are not
present elsewhere in world, the one (at least
as far as I've observed) that confuses my
European comrades most is tipping.
If one were to try to find a single sen
tence that sums up capitalism, many people
would go with "Everything has a price." Fur
ther.everyone would,hopefully,agree that a
price must be both an amount I am willing
to sell for and one that you are willing pay. 1
believe this goes by the moniker "supply
and demand" in the trade.
Tipping,on the other hand, is the antithe
sis of this philosophy — it is independent ot
supply. When you tip someone, you get to
decide the price and they get to smile and
look grateful for your largesse.
For all its flaws, the market is a great
equalizer; in any transaction, it (at least in
principle, if not always in practice) puts both
parties on the same footing — one buys and
sells only if the price is right. It you're rely
ing on a tip (and my ex-wait stalf friends as
sure me that's par for the course), you're
selling, but the price could be anything. Or
nothing.
1 find it intriguing that the world's shining
beacon of capitalism can let everyone down

so badly. America is, after all, what defenders
and assailers of Adam Smith hold up as prima
facie evidence of the market's wide-ranging
successes or disturbing moral failures.
More than capitalism, though, tipping at
tacks another deep-seated conceit of the
American mindset: classlessness. It is an
ideal of this country (and a deeply ad
mirable one) that ability should always win
over privilege and that one should never be
forced to rely on the mercy of another's gen
erosity. Clearly, if your income requires fre
quent gifts, said ideal is breaking down.
The practice of doling out cash to those
whose service pleases you is one of days of
old. when service was servitude and throw
ing scraps to the lower classes was an ac
ceptable form of payment. Moreover, 1
would argue this anachronism is a deliber
ate reflection of times past.
Why deliberate? Well, people, in general,
like nothing more than to feel both gener
ous and superior. Tipping affords them a
chance to do just that. After all what better
way to finish a fine, luxurious gourmet meal
fit for a king than by aping royalty?
Many of us will never be truly rich
(though none of us will ever be truly hard
up. either). For us, luxury is just that — a
luxury. In modern times, however, the na
ture of ostentation is changing; it is becom
ing affordable and accessible (perhaps
more about that some other time) — the

trappings of wealth are being steadi -
ly untrapped by globalization and
whatnot (three cheers for cheap
labor).
In a world where it's increasingly
easy to pretend you're wealthy, it's
perhaps not surprising that we grav
itate to other, more intangible, habits
of the rich. A large (and unfortu

nate) part of feeling successful is the
notion of being more successful than
others around you. And that. I'm
afraid, may be the subtext of your
apparent generosity at brunch.
Of course, since all of this is ideal
speculation, one shouldn't necessar
ily assume that I'm right. Maybe
Americans are big tippers because
you're better, more exceptional peo
ple. A beacon of hope for mankind
and all that.
