# Op-Ed
## Restricted access to event is censorship 
### MEGAN REISS 
I am going to begin writing this op-ed by
pointing out the obvious: Stanford Universi
ty is a private institution. As a private
school, Stanford may not be obliged to grant
full first amendment rights to its students.
The first amendment bans Congress
trom abridging freedoms of speech, press
and the right to peaceful assembly. Every
day in classes,meetings and Stanford events,
we are allowed to exercise these rights. It the
administration chose to ignore these rights
forcibly by. say. employing a professor who
docked points off a grade every time a stu
dent disagreed with him or her. we as the
student body would have to stand up and
demand change.
Likewise, Stanford would be going
against its own history of encouraging citi
zenship through the act of peaceful assem
bly if it began banning protests. Be it
through demonstrations or petitions. Stan

ford has appeared open to allowing students
to challenge policies and beliefs.
A group of students is organizing an
event called "The 3 Ex-Terrorists." The
event will be controversial.The topics of ter
rorism, the Middle East. Palestine and Israel
raise strong feelings all around.
Stanford students are not afraid of con
troversy. During winter quarter, students
bombarded the campus with calls to divest
from Israel. Last spring, many participated
in a protest against the Bush presidency dur
ing the president's visit. John Edwards incit
ed students with a call to action.
All of these events were student led. All
these events were covered by the press.
The planning of the 3 Ex-Terrorists event
has been fast and difficult. We were told by the
Risk Management Department that we had
to limit the event to only people with Stanford
I D's for "security reasons." We don't know the
criteria used to assess risk, but we
wanted the talk to occur, so we acqui
esced. We were consistently assured
by the administration that this is nor
mal because this is not a community
event; it is a Stanford student event.
We were then told that there
would be no video or photography al
lowed.Thoimh we did not understand

the problem, we acquiesced.
Finally, this week we were told that
the press is not allowed to attend the
event.Hie reason â€” this is a Stanford
event.
At what point does limiting the at
tendance of a student event become
censorship?
The free flow of ideas is necessary to
the development of educated opin
ions. and we need to demand our
rights to hear different views. We need
to ensure that the next generation of
Stanford students will be allowed to
participate in the free flow of ideas.

We need to challenge the administra
tion whenever it stifles opposing
views from being heard.
If you agree that we need to main
tain open dialogues on campus, send
an email or letter to John I lennessy at
hennessy@stanford.edu saying that
you support full media access to news
worthy campus events. We may not be
granted rights, so. on occasion, we
must fieht to obtain them.
