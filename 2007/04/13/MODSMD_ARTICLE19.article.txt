# Itsy bitsy caterpillars and other signs of spring
## 
### 
Spring has arrived here on the Farm, and
that can only mean four things.
1. Caterpillars
Apparently, someone upstairs didn't get
the memo that students are the only entities
allowed to be in gestation here. As if campus
housing wasn't crowded enough, now the
furry creatures "position themselves in trees
to prepare for the next stage in their lives."
according to an article in last week's Daily.
While I highly doubt that anyone was plan
ning to Draw into the trees in the Oval, 1 pre
fer life with as little competition as possible
(now I'm starting to sound like my father,
who has long since declared war on the ro
dents, insects and fungi of the natural world).

When they start showing up in class and pre
registering on Axess, I will be very upset.
Obviously in response to the numerous
Facebook groups and political campaigns fo
cused exclusively on the compelling issue of
caterpillar control. Stanford's administration
has taken action. The Stanford news server
recently reported the planned release of
"predatory spined soldier bugs" and noted
that "reinforcements will be sent in later in
the season, in the form of predatory nema
todes." In addition to forming an alliance
with the better-armed half of the natural
world. Stanford has begun "power-washing"
affected trees. The metaphor is so ripe that
I'm not even sure which direction to take it.
Finally, the news report noted that contact

with the caterpillars can cause allergic reac
tions. both dermatological and. if inhaled,
respiratory. There was no mention of their
hallucinogenic potential. Let that be a warn
ing to all of you entrepreneurial chemists out
there who hoped to translate the plague into
your own fiscal gain.
Speaking of plagues, what with the recent
Passover holiday, perhaps we should be slight
ly more concerned about the implicit message
of our own locust-like infestation. Might some
one upstairs be trying to tell us something'. 11

begging professors to hold class out
side (I m sure there's been a statisti
cally significant drop in these pleas
over the past two weeks).
Sure, our admissions brochures
and admit website feature numerous
pictures of appropriately diverse, J.
Crew-clad classes outside and deep
in thought and conversation.but I've
learned something from my own
teaching experience: Although one's
eyes are more likely to stay open
outdoors, they will most definitely
not focus on the textbook in one's
lap. There are birds, squirrels and
other, um, compelling species to ob
serve. And this time I'm not refer
ring to our eight-footed new neigh
bors.
3. Courtship
After a long, somewhat rainy
winter, who isn't ready to get out and
roll in the grass? Or. more accurate
ly these days, stay inside and roll
around on an insect-free twin extra
long?
Obviously, seniors should be cap
italizing on their final eight weeks of
interaction with their long-harbored
crushes. Just think — even if it ends
badly, as it usually does, in just a few
short weeks you'll be on opposite
sides of the state/country/globe. If
that's not compelling enough, then
consider this: This is your last chance
— at least until your five-year re
union, at which point one or both of
you may be legally bound to some
one else, a fact which will either
make the aforementioned awkward
ending entirely inconsequential or
even more uncomfortable.
For everyone else, focus on the
spring fling/spring fever excuse. In
terms of whom to fling (aside from
the caterpillar that just landed on
your shirt), I can offer only one piece
of advice: Someone who will land
softly. BFFs do not make good pro
jectiles, nor do TAs. Avoid big egos
and anyone in whom you have an
emotional (or academic) investment.
4. Cold chocolate
Somewhere, I'm sure chocolate
covered caterpillars are considered a
delicacy (Google tells me there are
over 150.000 sites where I can "buy
chocolate covered caterpillars," and
several of them look legitimate). But
here in the land of Yumi Yogurt. I pre
fer desserts of the (crunch-optional)

soft-serve variety.
For those of you who still eat with
in walking distance of a soft serve
machine and have yet to be initiated
into the Stanford fold, Yumi Yogurt is
located a good 15 to 20 minutes away
on El Camino in Redwood City. It is
not to he confused with the far inferi
or Yogurt Stop, also located on HI
Camino, hut much, much closer to
campus and much, riiuch less deli
cious (not to mention more expen
sive).
Never ones to shy away from diffi
culty when there's a valuable reward
to be had, Stanford students regularly
make the pilgrimage to the land of
extra-large portions and extremely
long lines (which, even in the dead of
winter, often snake out the door). Un
officially sponsored by the NCAA and
the Intersorority Council, Yumi regu
larly hosts informal team meetings
and gossip sessions: even now. years
after graduation, the Collins twins stop
by when they're in the area. One of my
friends is convinced Yumi laces its con
coctions with crack cocaine, but I've
done enough Sleep and Dreams re
search to know that every frozen dairy
product contains caffeine. Add in
sugar and. depending on your flavor of
choice, neon coloring, and it's no won
der that Yumi enjoys cult status.
Being the multi-tasker that I am.
I propose the following kill-all
caterpillars-with-one-stone ap
proach to spring quarter: relocate
the Quad to Sequoia High School
(conveniently across the street from
Yumi and in possession of a large,
grassy football field). Just make sure
the caterpillars stay on the Farm:
they may be hungry, and Yumi's por
tions may be large, but I refuse to
share my Ultimate Fudge Brownie.

the season, in the form of predatory nema
todes." In addition to forming an alliance
with the better-armed half of the natural
world. Stanford has begun "power-washing"
affected trees. The metaphor is so ripe that
I'm not even sure which direction to take it.
Finally, the news report noted that contact

with the caterpillars can cause allergic reac
tions. both dermatological and. if inhaled,
respiratory. There was no mention of their
hallucinogenic potential. Let that be a warn
ing to all of you entrepreneurial chemists out
there who hoped to translate the plague into
your own fiscal gain.
Speaking of plagues, what with the recent
Passover holiday, perhaps we should be slight
ly more concerned about the implicit message
of our own locust-like infestation. Might some
one upstairs be trying to tell us something'. 11

begging professors to hold class out
side (I m sure there's been a statisti
cally significant drop in these pleas
over the past two weeks).
Sure, our admissions brochures
and admit website feature numerous
pictures of appropriately diverse, J.
Crew-clad classes outside and deep
in thought and conversation.but I've
learned something from my own
teaching experience: Although one's
eyes are more likely to stay open
outdoors, they will most definitely
not focus on the textbook in one's
lap. There are birds, squirrels and
other, um, compelling species to ob
serve. And this time I'm not refer
ring to our eight-footed new neigh
bors.
3. Courtship
After a long, somewhat rainy
winter, who isn't ready to get out and
roll in the grass? Or. more accurate
ly these days, stay inside and roll
around on an insect-free twin extra
long?
Obviously, seniors should be cap
italizing on their final eight weeks of
interaction with their long-harbored
crushes. Just think — even if it ends
badly, as it usually does, in just a few
short weeks you'll be on opposite
sides of the state/country/globe. If
that's not compelling enough, then
consider this: This is your last chance
— at least until your five-year re
union, at which point one or both of
you may be legally bound to some
one else, a fact which will either
make the aforementioned awkward
ending entirely inconsequential or
even more uncomfortable.
For everyone else, focus on the
spring fling/spring fever excuse. In
terms of whom to fling (aside from
the caterpillar that just landed on
your shirt), I can offer only one piece
of advice: Someone who will land
softly. BFFs do not make good pro
jectiles, nor do TAs. Avoid big egos
and anyone in whom you have an
emotional (or academic) investment.
4. Cold chocolate
Somewhere, I'm sure chocolate
covered caterpillars are considered a
delicacy (Google tells me there are
over 150.000 sites where I can "buy
chocolate covered caterpillars," and
several of them look legitimate). But
here in the land of Yumi Yogurt. I pre
fer desserts of the (crunch-optional)

soft-serve variety.
For those of you who still eat with
in walking distance of a soft serve
machine and have yet to be initiated
into the Stanford fold, Yumi Yogurt is
located a good 15 to 20 minutes away
on El Camino in Redwood City. It is
not to he confused with the far inferi
or Yogurt Stop, also located on HI
Camino, hut much, much closer to
campus and much, riiuch less deli
cious (not to mention more expen
sive).
Never ones to shy away from diffi
culty when there's a valuable reward
to be had, Stanford students regularly
make the pilgrimage to the land of
extra-large portions and extremely
long lines (which, even in the dead of
winter, often snake out the door). Un
officially sponsored by the NCAA and
the Intersorority Council, Yumi regu
larly hosts informal team meetings
and gossip sessions: even now. years
after graduation, the Collins twins stop
by when they're in the area. One of my
friends is convinced Yumi laces its con
coctions with crack cocaine, but I've
done enough Sleep and Dreams re
search to know that every frozen dairy
product contains caffeine. Add in
sugar and. depending on your flavor of
choice, neon coloring, and it's no won
der that Yumi enjoys cult status.
Being the multi-tasker that I am.
I propose the following kill-all
caterpillars-with-one-stone ap
proach to spring quarter: relocate
the Quad to Sequoia High School
(conveniently across the street from
Yumi and in possession of a large,
grassy football field). Just make sure
the caterpillars stay on the Farm:
they may be hungry, and Yumi's por
tions may be large, but I refuse to
share my Ultimate Fudge Brownie.
