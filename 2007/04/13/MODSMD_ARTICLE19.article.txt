# Itsy bitsy caterpillars and other signs of spring
## 
### 
Spring has arrived here on the Farm, and
that can only mean four things.
1. Caterpillars
Apparently, someone upstairs didn't get
the memo that students are the only entities
allowed to be in gestation here. As if campus
housing wasn't crowded enough, now the
furry creatures "position themselves in trees
to prepare for the next stage in their lives."
according to an article in last week's Daily.
While I highly doubt that anyone was plan
ning to Draw into the trees in the Oval, 1 pre
fer life with as little competition as possible
(now I'm starting to sound like my father,
who has long since declared war on the ro
dents, insects and fungi of the natural world).

When they start showing up in class and pre
registering on Axess, I will be very upset.
Obviously in response to the numerous
Facebook groups and political campaigns fo
cused exclusively on the compelling issue of
caterpillar control. Stanford's administration
has taken action. The Stanford news server
recently reported the planned release of
"predatory spined soldier bugs" and noted
that "reinforcements will be sent in later in
the season, in the form of predatory nema
todes." In addition to forming an alliance
with the better-armed half of the natural
world. Stanford has begun "power-washing"
affected trees. The metaphor is so ripe that
I'm not even sure which direction to take it.
Finally, the news report noted that contact

with the caterpillars can cause allergic reac
tions. both dermatological and. if inhaled,
respiratory. There was no mention of their
hallucinogenic potential. Let that be a warn
ing to all of you entrepreneurial chemists out
there who hoped to translate the plague into
your own fiscal gain.
Speaking of plagues, what with the recent
Passover holiday, perhaps we should be slight
ly more concerned about the implicit message
of our own locust-like infestation. Might some
one upstairs be trying to tell us something'. 11
