## CARD OUT TO Baseball looks to improve on 0-6 Conference mark against Pac-10's best 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After snapping a six-game losing streak
on Tuesday at Nevada, Stanford baseball will
have an opportunity this weekend to snap
out of another skid, as it takes on No. 13 Ari
zona and tries to win its first Pacific-10 Con
ference game after opening to 0-6 in the
league against UCLA and Arizona State.
Hut against a talented Arizona squad led
by starting aces Preston Guilmet ((>O. 1.65
I RA) and lefty Brad Mills (7-2,3.21). that
may be no easy task this weekend at Sunken
Diamond.
The Wildcats (2S-6. 6-0 Pac-10) come in
riding a 14-game winning streak and stand
atop the league standings with their perfect
conference record. Stanford, which has been
plagued so far this season by difficulties in all
three phases of the game — pitching, hitting
and defense — will need a strong effort to
begin turning its season around.
"We played better at Rent), which was
good." head coach Mark Marquess said.
"And Arizona is probably one of the hottest
teams in our conference light now. Their
pitching numbers are very good, especially
when you consider they're pitching in Ari
zona. where the ball flies and the ground is
hard. Obviously their offensive numbers are
good, and they run, but with the ERA
they've shown with that staff, we know we're

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will look to
notch its first league win of the season
against the Pac-10 leading Wildcats, but
may need to do more than that to keep
their flagging conference hopes alive this
weekend. Friday night's matchup could be
particularly difficult for the Cardinal, as it
faces Arizona ace Preston Guilmet, who
has pitched nine innings in each of his last
three starts with hitters batting just .181
against him over that span. Stanford will
have a favorable travel schedule in the
coming weeks, with 10 of the team's next
13 games at home and the remaining
three at Cal next weekend.
