## CARD OUT TO Baseball looks to improve on 0-6 Conference mark against Pac-10's best 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After snapping a six-game losing streak
on Tuesday at Nevada, Stanford baseball will
have an opportunity this weekend to snap
out of another skid, as it takes on No. 13 Ari
zona and tries to win its first Pacific-10 Con
ference game after opening to 0-6 in the
league against UCLA and Arizona State.
Hut against a talented Arizona squad led
by starting aces Preston Guilmet ((>O. 1.65
I RA) and lefty Brad Mills (7-2,3.21). that
may be no easy task this weekend at Sunken
Diamond.
The Wildcats (2S-6. 6-0 Pac-10) come in
riding a 14-game winning streak and stand
atop the league standings with their perfect
conference record. Stanford, which has been
plagued so far this season by difficulties in all
three phases of the game — pitching, hitting
and defense — will need a strong effort to
begin turning its season around.
"We played better at Rent), which was
good." head coach Mark Marquess said.
"And Arizona is probably one of the hottest
teams in our conference light now. Their
pitching numbers are very good, especially
when you consider they're pitching in Ari
zona. where the ball flies and the ground is
hard. Obviously their offensive numbers are
good, and they run, but with the ERA
they've shown with that staff, we know we're

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will look to
notch its first league win of the season
against the Pac-10 leading Wildcats, but
may need to do more than that to keep
their flagging conference hopes alive this
weekend. Friday night's matchup could be
particularly difficult for the Cardinal, as it
faces Arizona ace Preston Guilmet, who
has pitched nine innings in each of his last
three starts with hitters batting just .181
against him over that span. Stanford will
have a favorable travel schedule in the
coming weeks, with 10 of the team's next
13 games at home and the remaining
three at Cal next weekend.

the Pac-10 in batting average and last in team ERA and fielding percentage.
going to have our hands full."
Arizona last lost a series to the
Cardinal in 2002, another run of mis
fortune that will have to end if Stan
ford is to salvage what is left of its sea
son. Another series loss to Arizona
would essentially cripple the Cardi
nal's chances in the Pac-10 down the
stretch. A large component of Stan
ford's turnaround hopes lie with the
squad's starting rotation, which has
yet to live up to expectations this sea
son.
As Friday's expected starter,
sophomore lefty Jeremy Bleich, put
it, Stanford's pitchers need to stay fo
cused on their own game and win
every battle as it comes.
"| We just need to] keep pitching,
keep throwing it. keep playing the
game," Bleich said. "Don't really
compete against yourself, compete
against the other guy. That's some
thing we've done a lot: We haven't
made the right pitches at the right
time. We've got good stuff, but we
need to put it all together."
Sophomore outfielder Sean
Ratliff, who leads Stanford in runs,
stolen bases, hits, slugging and on
base percentages among regular
players and is tied for the team lead
in home runs, was also adamant that
the Cardinal needs to work for con
sistency to best Arizona.
"I don't think it should change
our approach at all," Ratliff said.
"Every week in the Pac-10 you know
that the guys you're going to face are
going to have pretty good stuff, espe
cially the Friday night guys,and most
of the Saturday night guys are going
to be very good, very effective. They
wouldn't be pitching in the Pac-10 if
they didn't have the ability to put up
a lot of good numbers and get guys
out. We just have to stick with the ap
proach we've been working on. and
just keep swinging the bat."

Marquess, though, h;is been most
troubled by his team's defensive
lapses in recent games. Claiming a
high level of parity in the Pac-10, it
was the errors and extra chances the
Cardinal gave to its first two confer
ence opponents that most bothered
the coach in his 30th season at the
Stanford helm.
"We probably played our poorest
series of the year against UCLA, un
fortunately at home, and we just real
ly were never in any of the games,"
Marquess said."l thought we played
better at Arizona State; we had a
chance to win two of those games,
but what was disappointing to us
more than anything else in those two
series is we just didn't play very good
defense.
"We didn't pitch really well for
the most part, but the defense was
the thing that really concerned me,"
he continued. "We made a lot of er
rors, and gave UCLA and gave Ari
zona State a lot of extra outs, and you
just can't do that."
Ratliff was hopeful that the
squad's 9-4 win over the Wolfpack
earlier this week might give Stanford
a shot in the arm just as the Cardinal
needs it the most.
"I think it's always good to get
back on track with a win, especially
when you're struggling a little bit."
Ratliff said. "And they swung the bats
well — they're a good team. So we
get our groove back, and that's the
start of the second half of the season;
so as far as we're concerned it's I -0 in
the second-half, and we're just going
to try to get back on the right path."
Stanford hosts the Wildcats
tonight at (i p.m., followed by 1 p.m.
match ups on Saturday and Sunday
at Sunken Diamond.
