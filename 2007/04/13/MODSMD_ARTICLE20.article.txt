# Students, rise to action!

### 
There is something profoundly wrong
with our University. Maybe you can't
put your finger on it. hut you know
that something just doesn't feel right. There
are moments when you can almost articulate
what is troubling you. At EBF 1 lappy Hour,
you hear two people absently ask each
other."Whatever happened to that grad stu
dent who committed suicide?" You skim
election tliers in the bathroom and prompt
ly forget what anyone is promising as soon as
you finish washing your hands. Over break
fast, you read an editorial in The Daily, tack
ling a tough issue like re-filling Lake Lag or
regulating the caterpillar population on cam
pus. For some reason, these moments register
with a faint unease. But you aren't sure why.
When you were a senior in high school,
you remember reading the cover of your ac
ceptance envelope. It went something like,
"For all the times you stayed up late to get it
right... volunteered your time, talent and en
ergy; we applaud you."
You applauded yourself, too. A new chap
ter of vour life lav before vou, and you could

n't wait for it to start. But after that first rush
of a cappella concerts and fountain hopping,
things slowly changed. Looking back, you
now consider your optimism cute and naive.
Perhaps you think that you have found
the source of your unrest.The OSA is ruining
your fun through liability-minded mandates.
John Arrillaga is destroying your campus one
palm tree and stucco-clad box-building at a
time.The ASSLI has more tools in it than are
pair shop. The seniors have ruined things for
the underclassmen by publicly pissing in
bushes at Pub night. Ilie freshmen are ca
reer-driven megalomaniacs, representative
of the death of Stanford as a laid-back Ivy-al

ternative.
Wake up. undergrads: If you really gave a
damn, you would actually be doing some
thing. That slight unease that you feel is guilt.
It's your fault, my fault, our fault that Stan
ford is swathed in a cloak of bureaucracy and
out-of-touch policies. We have little to no
ownership in this campus, and I think we se
cretly don't want it. We like our apathy. We
like our angry words mixed with complete in
action.
We could easily have more ownership.
There are roughly 7,000 undergrads at Stan
ford. If we really thought that a policy was
bullshit, we could band together in an act ot
solidarity or defiance. We don't like that
Admit Weekend is dry? Fine.Then let's over
run the Row with parties from Slav to Sigma
Chi. Can the OSA punish all 1.500 Row resi
dents? We hate that Arrillaga is allowed to
mold our campus in his image? Fine. Then
let's storm the President's Office and vote
with our feet.
