# Students, rise to action!
## 
### 
There is something profoundly wrong
with our University. Maybe you can't
put your finger on it. hut you know
that something just doesn't feel right. There
are moments when you can almost articulate
what is troubling you. At EBF 1 lappy Hour,
you hear two people absently ask each
other."Whatever happened to that grad stu
dent who committed suicide?" You skim
election tliers in the bathroom and prompt
ly forget what anyone is promising as soon as
you finish washing your hands. Over break
fast, you read an editorial in The Daily, tack
ling a tough issue like re-filling Lake Lag or
regulating the caterpillar population on cam
pus. For some reason, these moments register
with a faint unease. But you aren't sure why.
When you were a senior in high school,
you remember reading the cover of your ac
ceptance envelope. It went something like,
"For all the times you stayed up late to get it
right... volunteered your time, talent and en
ergy; we applaud you."
You applauded yourself, too. A new chap
ter of vour life lav before vou, and you could

n't wait for it to start. But after that first rush
of a cappella concerts and fountain hopping,
things slowly changed. Looking back, you
now consider your optimism cute and naive.
Perhaps you think that you have found
the source of your unrest.The OSA is ruining
your fun through liability-minded mandates.
John Arrillaga is destroying your campus one
palm tree and stucco-clad box-building at a
time.The ASSLI has more tools in it than are
pair shop. The seniors have ruined things for
the underclassmen by publicly pissing in
bushes at Pub night. Ilie freshmen are ca
reer-driven megalomaniacs, representative
of the death of Stanford as a laid-back Ivy-al

ternative.
Wake up. undergrads: If you really gave a
damn, you would actually be doing some
thing. That slight unease that you feel is guilt.
It's your fault, my fault, our fault that Stan
ford is swathed in a cloak of bureaucracy and
out-of-touch policies. We have little to no
ownership in this campus, and I think we se
cretly don't want it. We like our apathy. We
like our angry words mixed with complete in
action.
We could easily have more ownership.
There are roughly 7,000 undergrads at Stan
ford. If we really thought that a policy was
bullshit, we could band together in an act ot
solidarity or defiance. We don't like that
Admit Weekend is dry? Fine.Then let's over
run the Row with parties from Slav to Sigma
Chi. Can the OSA punish all 1.500 Row resi
dents? We hate that Arrillaga is allowed to
mold our campus in his image? Fine. Then
let's storm the President's Office and vote
with our feet.

Sick Sad World
The sad truth is that no one really
cares. Some may complain loudly at
the great injustices of the system, but
few seem so inclined to organize and
strike. At this point, members of stu
dent organizations like SLAC are
most likely crying out in protest. Yes,
there are student activism groups
who both complain loudly and take
action. However, the average stu
dent goes right on criticizing with
great bravado but doesn't care
enough to actually do something.
To be fair, the average student is
most likely deeply invested in eradi
cating HPV in Somalia or educating
Belarusian peasants on women's
rights. 1 understand the importance
of student involvement in interna
tional affairs, but I don't support
how involvement in distant prob
lems often replaces local community
activism.
1 think that the root of our apathy
partially stems from the nature of
change within a bureaucracy. Noth
ing transforms quickly at Stanford.
Rather, all change is slow and grad
ual.
I am hesitant to use dorm alcohol
policy as an example, seeing as how
this will inevitably lead some to
think that all 1 care about are parties
and alcohol. This is not the case, but
dorm alcohol policy is an oft men
tioned example of gradual change at
Stanford. First, there was no alcohol
allowed in freshman common
spaces.Then, three years later, enter
ing freshmen had to take an alcohol
awareness test before they arrived.
Two years from now, freshman
dorms will only be able to have beer
or wine on the premises. Four years

after that conies the first dry frosh
dorm. By 2015. RAs are required to
report all underage drinking to the
Stanford police.
But no one in 2015 remembers
2003, when I drank Coronas with the
sophomores in the FroSoCo lounge
during admit weekend and no one
Cared.The class of 2019 is just thank
ful that they can still drink lukewarm
beer in the John Arrillaga Social
Gathering Pod. Not that they'd want
to. anyway. With a four percent ac
ceptance rate, the entering class of
strategically marketed and
groomed-since-kindergarten patent
holders and Swahili translators has
left social interaction to the kids at
CSU-Fullerton.
I suppose that 1 lament the in
evitable. Our increasing bureaucratic
apathy is to he expected at a time
when the only way to get into Stan
ford seems to be focusing on one's
career from middle school onward.
As Stanford gets increasingly com
petitive. the guy who grew up in
South Dakota and took apart his
dad's tractor to see how it worked
will be edged out by the guy who
wrote a book about taking apart trac
tors in South Dakota his mom is a
publisher, and she knows that her son
needs to stand out to get in.
How can we as students know
how to take a stand when we have
spent our whole lives being pro
grammed and directed by our par
ents? How can we, compulsively
over-committed and burned-out,
take the time to protest a new school
policy when we just want to find time
to get laid? By the look of things. 1
guess we can't. But it would be damn
nice if we tried.

You should come to Jackie Bernstein's
protest puny on Saturday night of
Admit Weekend. Contact her at

ling a tough issue like re-filling Lake Lag or
regulating the caterpillar population on cam
pus. For some reason, these moments register
with a faint unease. But you aren't sure why.
When you were a senior in high school,
you remember reading the cover of your ac
ceptance envelope. It went something like,
"For all the times you stayed up late to get it
right... volunteered your time, talent and en
ergy; we applaud you."
You applauded yourself, too. A new chap
ter of vour life lav before vou, and you could

n't wait for it to start. But after that first rush
of a cappella concerts and fountain hopping,
things slowly changed. Looking back, you
now consider your optimism cute and naive.
Perhaps you think that you have found
the source of your unrest.The OSA is ruining
your fun through liability-minded mandates.
John Arrillaga is destroying your campus one
palm tree and stucco-clad box-building at a
time.The ASSLI has more tools in it than are
pair shop. The seniors have ruined things for
the underclassmen by publicly pissing in
bushes at Pub night. Ilie freshmen are ca
reer-driven megalomaniacs, representative
of the death of Stanford as a laid-back Ivy-al

ternative.
Wake up. undergrads: If you really gave a
damn, you would actually be doing some
thing. That slight unease that you feel is guilt.
It's your fault, my fault, our fault that Stan
ford is swathed in a cloak of bureaucracy and
out-of-touch policies. We have little to no
ownership in this campus, and I think we se
cretly don't want it. We like our apathy. We
like our angry words mixed with complete in
action.
We could easily have more ownership.
There are roughly 7,000 undergrads at Stan
ford. If we really thought that a policy was
bullshit, we could band together in an act ot
solidarity or defiance. We don't like that
Admit Weekend is dry? Fine.Then let's over
run the Row with parties from Slav to Sigma
Chi. Can the OSA punish all 1.500 Row resi
dents? We hate that Arrillaga is allowed to
mold our campus in his image? Fine. Then
let's storm the President's Office and vote
with our feet.


Bernstein
Sick Sad World
The sad truth is that no one really
cares. Some may complain loudly at
the great injustices of the system, but
few seem so inclined to organize and
strike. At this point, members of stu
dent organizations like SLAC are
most likely crying out in protest. Yes,
there are student activism groups
who both complain loudly and take
action. However, the average stu
dent goes right on criticizing with
great bravado but doesn't care
enough to actually do something.
To be fair, the average student is
most likely deeply invested in eradi
cating HPV in Somalia or educating
Belarusian peasants on women's
rights. 1 understand the importance
of student involvement in interna
tional affairs, but I don't support
how involvement in distant prob
lems often replaces local community
activism.
1 think that the root of our apathy
partially stems from the nature of
change within a bureaucracy. Noth
ing transforms quickly at Stanford.
Rather, all change is slow and grad
ual.
I am hesitant to use dorm alcohol
policy as an example, seeing as how
this will inevitably lead some to
think that all 1 care about are parties
and alcohol. This is not the case, but
dorm alcohol policy is an oft men
tioned example of gradual change at
Stanford. First, there was no alcohol
allowed in freshman common
spaces.Then, three years later, enter
ing freshmen had to take an alcohol
awareness test before they arrived.
Two years from now, freshman
dorms will only be able to have beer
or wine on the premises. Four years

after that conies the first dry frosh
dorm. By 2015. RAs are required to
report all underage drinking to the
Stanford police.
But no one in 2015 remembers
2003, when I drank Coronas with the
sophomores in the FroSoCo lounge
during admit weekend and no one
Cared.The class of 2019 is just thank
ful that they can still drink lukewarm
beer in the John Arrillaga Social
Gathering Pod. Not that they'd want
to. anyway. With a four percent ac
ceptance rate, the entering class of
strategically marketed and
groomed-since-kindergarten patent
holders and Swahili translators has
left social interaction to the kids at
CSU-Fullerton.
I suppose that 1 lament the in
evitable. Our increasing bureaucratic
apathy is to he expected at a time
when the only way to get into Stan
ford seems to be focusing on one's
career from middle school onward.
As Stanford gets increasingly com
petitive. the guy who grew up in
South Dakota and took apart his
dad's tractor to see how it worked
will be edged out by the guy who
wrote a book about taking apart trac
tors in South Dakota his mom is a
publisher, and she knows that her son
needs to stand out to get in.
How can we as students know
how to take a stand when we have
spent our whole lives being pro
grammed and directed by our par
ents? How can we, compulsively
over-committed and burned-out,
take the time to protest a new school
policy when we just want to find time
to get laid? By the look of things. 1
guess we can't. But it would be damn
nice if we tried.

You should come to Jackie Bernstein's
protest puny on Saturday night of
Admit Weekend. Contact her at
jaber(p Stanford, edi i for details.
