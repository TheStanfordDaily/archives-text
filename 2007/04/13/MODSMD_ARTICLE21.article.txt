## Open letter to President Hennessy 
### 
Dear President llennessy.
In 2003, during a time of escalating protest
by the Stanford community, you designed
and implemented a "Living Wage Policy tor
Subcontracted Workers." hailed by your
statement, "we recognize paying a living
wage to all the people who work on campus
is a reasonable and justifiable thing to do."
Ibis policy implemented a wage floor for em
ployees of contractors who do business with
Stanford, consistent with the University
Code of Conduct you also designed. The
Code of Conduct demands that all individu
als who "contract with" or "assert an associa
tion with" the University "are responsible for
sustaining the highest ethical standards of
this institution, and of the broader communi
ty in which we function."
In 2004. the Presidential Advisory Com
mittee on Workplace Policies (PAC) — con

vened a year earlier in response to the con
tinued protest by the community — issued
its assessment of campus labor policies. In its
final report, the PAC concluded that the liv
ing wage policy includes "so many conditions
to its applicability that it has the effect of ex
cusing many Contracted workers from that
policy." Indeed, the living wage policy as im
plemented in May 2003 includes a list of
seven restrictions on the types of workers
who may qualify for a living wage. The PAC
argued forcefully that a " living wage' policy
that appends a string of conditions creates in
equities among similar workers and risks giv
ing the unfortunate impression that Stan
ford's employment policies do not really
mean what they are proclaimed to be." ITius.
the PAC recommended that the scope of
Stanford's living wage policy "should be ex
panded so that at least three of the current re

strictions are removed."They recommended
that an additional two of the restrictions be
removed following a review of feasibility. In
stead of accepting this recommendation out
right. you forwarded the issue on to the
Human Resources department to conduct a
further review.
In 2(X)(i, two years after the release of the
PAC report. Human Resources issued a re
sponse in which it refused to lift any of the re
strictions. briefly citing unspecified increases
in cost and logistical difficulties. Now. four
years after the implementation of the living
wage policy, all its restrictions remain intact
despite the recommendations of the PA(
and the demands of the student body, work
ers and the ASSIJ. Accordingly, we ask that
you immediately follow through on your
