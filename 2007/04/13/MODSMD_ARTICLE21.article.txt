## Open letter to President Hennessy 
### 
Dear President llennessy.
In 2003, during a time of escalating protest
by the Stanford community, you designed
and implemented a "Living Wage Policy tor
Subcontracted Workers." hailed by your
statement, "we recognize paying a living
wage to all the people who work on campus
is a reasonable and justifiable thing to do."
Ibis policy implemented a wage floor for em
ployees of contractors who do business with
Stanford, consistent with the University
Code of Conduct you also designed. The
Code of Conduct demands that all individu
als who "contract with" or "assert an associa
tion with" the University "are responsible for
sustaining the highest ethical standards of
this institution, and of the broader communi
ty in which we function."
In 2004. the Presidential Advisory Com
mittee on Workplace Policies (PAC) — con

vened a year earlier in response to the con
tinued protest by the community — issued
its assessment of campus labor policies. In its
final report, the PAC concluded that the liv
ing wage policy includes "so many conditions
to its applicability that it has the effect of ex
cusing many Contracted workers from that
policy." Indeed, the living wage policy as im
plemented in May 2003 includes a list of
seven restrictions on the types of workers
who may qualify for a living wage. The PAC
argued forcefully that a " living wage' policy
that appends a string of conditions creates in
equities among similar workers and risks giv
ing the unfortunate impression that Stan
ford's employment policies do not really
mean what they are proclaimed to be." ITius.
the PAC recommended that the scope of
Stanford's living wage policy "should be ex
panded so that at least three of the current re

strictions are removed."They recommended
that an additional two of the restrictions be
removed following a review of feasibility. In
stead of accepting this recommendation out
right. you forwarded the issue on to the
Human Resources department to conduct a
further review.
In 2(X)(i, two years after the release of the
PAC report. Human Resources issued a re
sponse in which it refused to lift any of the re
strictions. briefly citing unspecified increases
in cost and logistical difficulties. Now. four
years after the implementation of the living
wage policy, all its restrictions remain intact
despite the recommendations of the PA(
and the demands of the student body, work
ers and the ASSIJ. Accordingly, we ask that
you immediately follow through on your
stated commitment to a University
wide living wage policy by imple
menting the following:
1. That the living wage be expand
ed to apply to all campus workers re
gardless of the dollar value of em
ployee contract, duration of employ
ment. number of hours worked per
week, union membership status and
worksite location. The living wage
should apply equally to workers re
gardless of whether they are em
ployed directly by Stanford, by a
contractor or by any other entity af
filiated with Stanford.
2. That changes to the living wage
policy be made in the context of a
more comprehensive labor policy re
form that includes guarantees for
complete wage parity and a commit
ment to absolute neutrality in union
organizing efforts, including the insti
tution of a card-check neutrality sys
tem.
3. That any changes made be ac
companied by proactive mecha
nisms of ongoing adjustment and ac
countability so that wages and other
labor policies can remain responsive
to the needs of workers and trans
parent to the entire community.
4. That any policy changes that are
made be accompanied by propor
tional budget and resource alloca
tions to departments that will he re
sponsible for hiring workers with
the new labor standards or to ad
ministrative departments charged
with implementing and overseeing
these policies. Thus, no department
will be forced to hire fewer workers
in order to implement the higher
wages, and no administrative de
partment will be put in a position in

which it is unable to promptly con
duct a comprehensive review or im
plement changes for lack of re
sources.
5. That all changes made to labor
policy, any details and processes for
their implementation and any ac
companying analysis be conducted
in a transparent and democratic
fashion in which workers, faculty,
students and the Stanford communi
ty will have access to information
and will be fully involved in the deci
sion-making process.
