## No. 1 tennis faces final stretch 
### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked Cardinal women's tennis team will
begin its stretch run with two crucial in-conference
matches against UCLA and Southern California. Stan
ford enters this weekend's competition riding a 14-
game winning streak.
('omingoffof an emotional weekend with the festiv
ities of Senior Day, Stanford (17-1,5-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will now see tougher competition from the
Bruins and Trojans. UCLA (13-6.4-1) is ranked No. 13
in the nation while USC (16-2,5-0) is ranked seventh.
Last weekend's opponents, Washington State and
Washington, were not ranked in the top 40.
Ilus weekend's matches are pivotal for the Cardinal,
as the team tries to clinch another Pac-10 title. A sweep
of the I..A. schools would almost assure Stanford of the
title.
" ITiey're very important [matches)," coach Lele
Forood said. "They're a good indication of where we
are right now. For our own understanding of where we
are at this point in the season, the results will he very im
portant to us."
Senior Anne Yelsey was also keen on the signifi
cance of the weekend's upcoming matches.
"These next two weeks will he the toughest confer
ence matches we will have had so far." she said.' It will
be a big a challenge. We always want to go to L.A. and
beat [UCLA and USC] in front ot their home crowd.
It's a challenge in that respect."
Stanford plays UCLA today at 1:30 p.m., followed
by its Saturday match against the Trojans at noon.
'Hie Cardinal was victorious in its first matches
against the Los Angeles schools. Moth games were chal
lenging for Stanford, though — the match against
UCLA was particularly close as the Cardinal had to
rally from a 3-2 deficit to win by a final score of 4-3.
"We were a little bit fatigued last time," Yelsey said.
"I think we're well rested and ready to play them [this
time around|."
The UCLA venue could present a unique obstacle
for the Cardinal, as Yelsey explained that the Bruins
often bring out a lot of fans and even their band, on oc
casion, to its tennis matches. The business-like Cardinal,
though, welcomes the challenge of the adversarial road
atmospheres.
"We've gotten so good at blocking things out that I
don't think it makes an impact." Yelsey said.

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford faces its greatest remaining chal
lenges on the schedule this weekend against No. 13 UCLA and
No. 7 USC, their last two ranked opponents before the Pac-10 in
dividuals. Stanford is 8-1 against top 25 ranked opponents this
season.

With the opponents they'll face, the Cardinal
women will still have all that they can handle.
"They're two teams that are ranked in the top ten in
the country, so it's highly competitive stuff," Forood
said.
UCLA's No. I player, Riza Zalameda. is a force on
the court. She gave Stanford's No. 1. senior Theresa
Logar, plenty of trouble, defeating her 1-6,6-1, 6-0 on
Feb. 17.
"If [Zalameda] is on," Yelsey said, "she's a great
player."
I JSC's top two players are also tough match-ups for
the Cardinal. Junior Lindsay Nelson and freshman
Sarah lansler both outdid Stanford's Nelson and
Yelsey. respectively. Yesley and Logar's previous losses
to the USC duo may provide an extra incentive, though.
Nelson stands at six feet and is one of the most pow
erful players in all of college tennis. She plays at the No.
1 spot and will be an interesting match-up for Logar.
Nelson won the first match up between the pair back in
February, l ansler is only a freshman, but, as her results
show, she is a force on the tennis court.
But the Cardinal fully expects to be ready for the
challenges posed by all of its opponents this weekend.
As co-captain Yelsey put it, "our team seems to play
better under pressure and when everything's on the
line."
