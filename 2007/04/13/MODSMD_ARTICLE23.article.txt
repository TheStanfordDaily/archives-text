# Gregorka leads in the pool and out
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Senior Alison Gregorka has come
a long way in her water polo career
literally, as well as figuratively.
From an unlikely start in the state of
Michigan, where sports on ice are
more popular than sports in water,
Gregorka's journey has taken her
around the world to pools in every
corner of the globe.
But none of those pools holds a
place as dear to Gregorka's heart as
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center,
where the talented two-meter de
fender has developed into one of the
top collegiate water polo players in
the nation, as well as a respected and
trusted senior leader of her team.
Born and raised in Ann Arbor,
Mich., Gregorka took up water polo
in middle school and went on to lead
her high school's varsity team to
state championships in three ol her
four years on the squad. Yet regard
less of her successful prep career, it
would be hard to say that Gregorka
was destined for water polo great
ness at a higher level. Not only did
she live in a state nearly 2,(KM) miles
removed from the sport's hotbed of
sunny Southern California, but the
quality of the competition she was
facing couldn't compare to what
most of her current teammates were
experiencing during their high
school years.
"It was hard to get recruited Irom
so far away, especially because
Michigan water polo isn't exactly
considered to be top notch. "Gregor
ka explained with a laugh.
Despite the odds,though,Gregor
ka eventually signed on to become a
member of the Cardinal squad, lured
to the I arm as much by a memorable
recruiting trip as by the school's un
paralleled mix of athletic and aca
demic opportunities.
"I had a really great time on my
trip here," said Gregorka, who now,
four years later, has been named one
of the team's two captains. "So many
of the girls on the team hung out to
gether and I really liked that atmos
phere. I figured that [team dynamic]
carried over somehow into the
water, and I think it really does. Year
to year it definitely changes, but I feel
like the people who end up here on
our team are kind of a different
breed in general ."
Stanford head coach John Tanner
testified to Gregorka's rapid transi
tion from being a high school star in
the Midwest to being a dependable
member of a collegiate program
looking to win an N( A A title.

4/7 vs. No. 14 Long Beach
State W 1 3-6
4/1 4 Avery Aquatic Center
1 PM.
GAME NOTES; Stanford faces one of its most
significant obstacles of the season tomorrow,
as the Cardinal hosts the Bruins in a
matchup of the top two ranked squads in the
nation. Stanford will be looking to extend its
1 7 game winning streak against a UCLA
squad that is also perfect in the MPSF, having
notched nine conference wins on the season
while posting a 20-1 overall record. The
Cardinal has scored in double figures in
each of the last nine games and 11 of its last
12. Following the showdown against UCLA,
Stanford is slated to face No. 12 UC-Santa
Barbara on Sunday at 1 p.m.

"I think the tiling that makes
[Gregorka] stand out is the fact that
she's not from a 'standard' water
polo area, and that she just didn't
have the opportunities to he exposed
to real high-level water polo [as a re
sult]." Tanner said. "For her to he
from Ann Arbor, Mich, and to be
held in really high regard by her
teammates here early in her career
shows what kind of an athlete she is.
and how determined she is to suc
ceed and excel."
But Gregorka's travel for water
polo certainly hasn't been limited to
trips to and from home in Ann
Arbor. In fact, her five-hour (light
home to Michigan pales in compari
son to some of the flights Gregorka
has taken in order to represent the
United States on the international
stage.
During her sophomore year. Gre
gorka headed to Perth, Australia,as a
member of the U.S. Junior National
Team that ultimately took gold with
an 11 -9 victory over Russia in the
championship match. This past sum
mer, Gregorka cracked the ranks of
the U.S. Senior National Team,one of
just 14 players named by head coach
Guy Baker to the squad that will ul
timately wear the red,white and blue
at the 2(K)S Olympics in Beijing.
After traveling to Hungary and
Italy for World League competition,
Gregorka and the rest of the Senior
National squad headed to Tianjin.

China, for the 2(K)(i FINA World
Cup.The tournament ended on a dis
appointing note for the Americans,
however, as they fell to Russia in the
bronze medal game, 9-8.
An intense fall training season
followed, during which time Gregor
ka headed down to the National
Training Center in Los Alamitos,
Calif, every other weekend to work
out with the national team. That hard
work paid off last month at the 2(X)7
FINA World Championships in Mel
bourne. Australia, where Gregorka
and her teammates knocked off
Team Australia to bring home the
gold medal. Gregorka tallied three
goals and six assists in the tourna
ment.
"It was a whole new level this
time," Gregorka said of her recent
trip Down Under. "This past sum
mer's World Cup was my first major

tournament as a member of the Se
nior team, but it didn't feel like a big
tournament. But coming to World
Championships, it was all the aquatic
sports, so the atmosphere surround
ing it was a lot bigger than anything
I 've been a part of."
Now back with the Cardinal, Gre
gorka is focused solely on helping
her team bring the NCAA title back
to the Farm for the first time since
2002. Armed with a laugh described
by fellow co-captain and senior Katie
Hansen as "infectious." Gregorka
provides as much with her alterna
tively goofy and serious disposition
and boundless enthusiasm as she
does with her premier defensive play.
"It's been kind of hard the month
without her," Hansen said of her fel
low co-captain. "Alison's just a lot of

Senior Alison Gregorka is a presence on the international stage as well as for
the No. 1 Cardinal, helping lead Team USA to a first place finish in the 2007
FINA Championships. Stanford squares off against top rival No. 2 UCLA this
weekend as well as No. 12 UC-Santa Barbara.
tun as a teammate in general, as I
think anyone on the team will tell
you. She's always having fun, but
when it comes down to business,
she's very serious and gets the job
done. Luckily (she's) found it really
easy to ease herself back into the
team and what we're doing really
quickly and seamlessly."
"Alison has a real presence

around her that is appealing to all
â€¢he people on the team," Tanner
added. I mean, you can hear her
| when she laughs] and you certainly
notice her, hut she's also happy to
be behind the scenes (because] she
leally doesn't need to stand out or
have attention drawn to herself."
With her unique combination of
attitude, skill and dedication,
there s no telling just how far the
talented senior from Ann Arbor
will go.
