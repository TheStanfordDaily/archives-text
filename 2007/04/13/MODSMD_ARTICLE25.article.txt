## Health expert takes on flu 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
World Health Organization
(WHO) Assistant Director-General
for C ommunicable Diseases David
Heymann warned faculty and stu
dents gathered F.ncina's Bechtel Au
ditorium that the world's pandemic
preparedness programs would he
critical to combatting a potential
avian flu outbreak.
Heymann also pointed out sever
al weaknesses of the program and ex
plained how they are currently being
addressed internationally.
"I'm not going to give you the
scares," he told the audience. "I'm
going to give you the facts as we
know them at WHO."
As part of the Payne Lecture se
ries sponsored by the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies. Heymann addressed the key
mechanisms by which influenza
spreads from animal populations to
human populations to become pan
demic flu, in particular the HSNI
strain known as avian flu.
All strains of influenza, he said,
come from avian sources. Originally
a disease found onlv in birds, some

strains of influenza now can be trans
ferred to human populations and
spread among humans.
The world is currently at a rela
tively low level of pandemic alert,
but WHO is monitoring the HSNI
virus for signs that it has combined
with a virus transmissible to humans
or the less likely possibility that it has
made the jump on its own. The cur
rent alert level is called 'phase three.'
"The most important thing today
is to stop the pandemic at the
source," Heymann said. "Should we
move to phase four, the world would
be in very serious danger."
Heymann noted in particular that
the world's current vaccine-produc
tion capacity is low relative to the
population of developing countries.
He said that many nations with vac
cine-production capacity have intro
duced policies which make it impos
sible to export vaccines to other na
tions until their own national capaci
ty has been met.
"This inequality [...] has led to a
real discontent in developing coun
tries," he said.
The process that produces vac
cines for seasonal influenza each
year takes approximately six months

and relies heavily upon international
cooperation and the free exchange
of viruses discovered in different lo
cations. From these viruses, the most
hazardous are identified and target
ed. The current global vaccine pro
duction capacity is approximately
500,000 doses, Heymann said.
Additionally. Heymann outlined
the process of pandemic disease de
tection — using Sudden Acute Res
piratory Syndrome (SARS) as an ex
ample — and touched on global
health activism.
"One of the most important
things is to talk about access," he said
in an interview with The Daily.
"There is a role for everyone to play."
The talk attracted both students,
faculty and members of the Center
for International Security and Coop
eration.
"This is a big international issue
that we are facing," said Niaz Ba
naiee. a faculty member in the de
partment of pathology. "It's better to
know about it now than wait until it
happens. We still know very little in
terms of treatment."
