## Winter housing crunch alleviated Spring brings spacious rooms to undergrads 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As usual, the turn of spring has
brought to campus showers, flowers
and housing relief. As more space
in student residences has become
available, the housing crunch under
graduates suffered winter quarter
has come to an end.
Last quarter, more than 30 return
ing undergraduates were placed in
graduate housing due to lack of
space, but, this quarter, almost every
returning student has been accom
modated in undergraduate housing.
"Because the number of students
returning to campus spring quarter is
smaller than that returning winter
quarter and because many seniors
graduate at the end of winter quar
ter, we generally have a surplus of
undergraduate housing spaces dur
ing spring quarter each year," Direc
tor of Housing Assignments Sue
Nunan told The Daily in a written
statement.
According to Housing Assign
ments, of 127 students on the spring
quarter housing waiting list, all but
three have been assigned a room in
an undergraduate residence, and
there are still more than 160 vacan
cies remaining scattered around

campus.
Undergraduates who were placed
in graduate housing last quarter had
the chance to move into undergradu
ate residence this quarter, but most
of them have chosen to remain in
their current locations.
"lt d be a huge inconvenience to
move my stuff around campus," said
Carl Moore '08. who was placed in a
single in Crothers Hall when he re
turned from Oxford in the winter. "I
don't mind my assignment too
much."
Others who had roommates last
quarter have suddenly found them
selves living in singles.
"I was betting on the odds." said
Mason De Passe 08, whose room
mate moved out this quarter and still
has no new assigned roommate. "I'm
betting that no one given a choice
would choose Crothers."
ITiis pattern of a winter housing
crunch followed by spring vacancies
is not unusual, according to Student
Housing. More students study
abroad autumn quarter while few
leave in the winter, creating difficul
ties for students seeking mid-year as
signment. When a large number of
students leave to go abroad again in
the spring, vacancies open up.
"It's surprising," DePasse said,
"because spring is the nicest quarter
here."
