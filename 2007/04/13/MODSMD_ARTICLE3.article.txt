# Barry's legendary shadow
## 
### 
While 1 was nestled under a
palm tree in the Quad, try
ing to figure out whether I
should write about the future of Stan
lord basketball or the early entries to
the NBA draft, a novel idea came to
me. I decided not to write about bas
ketball for this week's column.
Sure, my column may be called
"Above the Rim." but even I get a lit
tle siek of basketball sometimes.
Watching the NCAA Tournament
and ridiculous amounts of basketball
can do that to you — 1 guess I just
need ;i little break to recharge before
the NBA s stretch run.
And. after all. baseball is here.
Spring is in the air and Opening Day
was almost a full two weeks ago.
Major League Baseball is just getting
into the swing of things (pun intend
ed) and. before you know it. it's going
to be October.
Which brings me to the brunt of
my column: Barry Bonds and the
juiced era over which he has reigned.
Now, I understand why people
hate Barry Bonds. For decades, the
man has been a jerk to the media
("jerk "really doesn't convey the way
he treated journalists and carried
himself in public), gotten in lights
with fellow teammates and been ac
cused of using performance-enhanc
ing supplements in the BALCO


Salisbury
Above the Rim
scandal.
It's completely legitimate to hate
Barry Bonds as a person or a player.
He's just one of those guys.
So maybe it's natural that so
many people would want to write off
Bonds' legacy as a baseball player
for these very reasons. But that's
where 1 have to disagree: no matter
what you think of the guy and how
valid those thoughts are. he should
and always will be considered one of
the greatest players of all time.
Despite the fact that he has the
single-season home-run record and
may capture Hank Aaron's career
record. Bonds' legacy as a player has
been tarnished by those in the media
and fans of the game because of his
purported connection with perform
ance-enhancing drugs.
And it's fair to detract from the
statistics themselves — after all.
Bonds is a juiced player playing in a
juiced era. But to detract from
Bonds' status as one of the greatest
players of all time is wrong.
You just have to put things into
context.
When Bonds went on his tear

during the early part ofthisdecade.it
was truly remarkable. Managers
were walking him with no one on
base routinely.This wouldn't happen
to any other player in the modern
game, maybe ever. Bonds was once
walked with the bases loaded —
does it get any more insane than
that?
And, at the same time. Bonds
doesn't exemplify most home-run
hitters' batting styles. Such past pro
lific home-run hitters as Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa had lit
tle bat control,striking out an astro
nomical number of times. Bonds is
almost impossible to strike out, a re
markable feat for a hitter with his
power.
Indeed. Barry's best attribute
might not be his power; it might be
his simply flawless swing. He has a
brilliant eye, and he consistently
makes contact with the ball.
In his career, the much-maligned
left-fielder has won multiple Gold
Gloves. 'Hie only real chink in his
game might be his weak arm, which
wasn't always as weak as it is now.
During his prime, Bonds' influ
ence and impact on games were in
describable. Managers planned their
whole strategy around the fourth
spot in the Giants' line-up.
For some people to write off
Bonds' career because he may have

used steroids seems to me to stem
from an incredibly narrow view
point. You could have the most arti
ficially strong man in the world, and
he wouldn't ever he able to do the
things Bonds was doing on the field,
and, to an extent, is still doing today.
Bonds' alleged steroid abuse may
detract from his charisma, personal
credibility, integrity and his actual
statistical prowess,but it simply can t
detract from his legacy as one of the
greatest of all time. Because he was
just that good.
Whether or not he captures the
home-run record or gathers 3,(KK)
hits is irrelevant. Numbers are just
numbers. After all. no one will ever

match Babe Ruth for what he did in
his time because slugging in the Bam
bino's era just isn't the same as doing
it today. Along the same lines, Kobe
Bryant's 81-point performance last
year will always be more remarkable
than Wilt's magical KXJ. It's all about
the context of the games.
But I feel like I'm rambling by
now. I guess that's what happens
when a writer with a column entitled
"Above The Rim" tries to delve into
the world of baseball.

sonable person. Vent your irrational
