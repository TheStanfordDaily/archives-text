# Barry's legendary shadow
## 
### 
While 1 was nestled under a
palm tree in the Quad, try
ing to figure out whether I
should write about the future of Stan
lord basketball or the early entries to
the NBA draft, a novel idea came to
me. I decided not to write about bas
ketball for this week's column.
Sure, my column may be called
"Above the Rim." but even I get a lit
tle siek of basketball sometimes.
Watching the NCAA Tournament
and ridiculous amounts of basketball
can do that to you â€” 1 guess I just
need ;i little break to recharge before
the NBA s stretch run.
And. after all. baseball is here.
Spring is in the air and Opening Day
was almost a full two weeks ago.
Major League Baseball is just getting
into the swing of things (pun intend
ed) and. before you know it. it's going
to be October.
Which brings me to the brunt of
my column: Barry Bonds and the
juiced era over which he has reigned.
Now, I understand why people
hate Barry Bonds. For decades, the
man has been a jerk to the media
("jerk "really doesn't convey the way
he treated journalists and carried
himself in public), gotten in lights
with fellow teammates and been ac
cused of using performance-enhanc
ing supplements in the BALCO
