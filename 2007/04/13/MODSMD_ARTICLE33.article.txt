## Its not over 'til...the networks say it is 
### RACHEL LEW INTERMISSION TV GUIDE EXPERT 
Season finales generally make me happy.
Why? You can always count on a season fi
nale to be exciting. Characters come. Charac
ters leave. People die. Babies are bom. People
fall in love. There are weddings. People cheat.
People break up. Characters are revealed to
be traitors. Characters are revealed to be Cy
lons. Year long story-arcs will be resolved (we
hope, unless the name of your show is "Lost,"
in which case nothing will be resolved and the
plot will become increasingly convoluted).
Someone will be crowned the next American
Idol, Top Model, Pussycat Doll, Survivor,
celebrity ballroom dancer, etc.
However, season finales can sometimes
make me sad as well. For one thing, they're
not always well done and sometimes leave me
disappointed. Often, shows do some of the
things listed above merely for shock value and
they contribute nothing positive to the plot of
the show at large. Season finales also tend to
utilize the most evil and devious device of all
— the clifthanger. It is in this way that TV net
works ensure that we will continue to watch
their programs come next fall. Therefore, the
finale of the season of a TV program is some
times in no way final at all. Shows may leave
us scratching our heads, hoping, wondering,
crying and even causing harm to ourselves as
we wait in suspense from sometime in May or
early June until September to find out
whether someone will live or die. and whether
or not an apocalypse will be prevented. That
being said, a cliffhanger done right can also be
genius (think back to the ending of the first
season of "Alias").

50... considering all of the above, here is a
list of upcoming season finales that I am most
eagerly anticipating or, at the very least, have
high hopes will not prove disappointing for
you:
1. "Heroes" — Although only in its fresh
man year. I've already become very at
tached to this show (with the exception of
Niki/Jessica/Brooke Taylor Windham from
"Legally Blonde" ... I hate her and think
she's a waste of time). I can't wait to see
everyone join up and "Save the World" (or
at least New York). "Heroes" returns April
23 and concludes on May 21.
2. "The Office" — There hasn't really been
that big of a season-long plotline on "The Of
fice" this year (like last season's Jim and Pam
bit), but each episode is always funny, and I'm
sure the finale won't disappoint. Whether
Michael is using Wikipedia negotiation tactics
to get a raise, Jim is convincing Dwight that
he's a vampire or Dwight is being Dwight,
"The Office" always makes me chuckle. This
season concludes on May 10 with an office trip
to the beach.
3. "Grey's Anatomy" — I haven't loved this
season of Grey's as much as the last one (for
awhile not that much was happening... every
one was just whining), but recently 1 think it
has been improving. And we all know that
everyone watches it... even Bill Clinton re
cently admitted that it was among his favorite
TV shows. Also, the last two episodes are sup
posed to be setting up a spin-off for Addison,
and 1 am intrigued to see how that turns out.
Finale airs on May 10.

4. HBO — Granted I am cheating here, since
HBO is obviously a network and not a show.
However, since I imagine that most people at
Stanford don't even get HBO (myself includ
ed), it seemed like it should only get one entry
dedicated to it. Be sure to check out the finale
of "Entourage" (by either making the right
kind of HBO-purchasing friends or using
other entirely legal methods ...), which re
turned for the second half of its third season
last Sunday and concludes on May 20. Also on
May 20 is the series finale of "The Sopranos."
I know a lot of people have probably given up

on "The Sopranos since it airs

so infrequently, but I always
like to in the very least see

how a series that I used to
watch ultimately con
cludes (like "The OC,"
which ended in February,
except that I may have
never stopped watching <
that one). You can also
watch the brilliant 7 1/2
Sopranos clip made by

two fans on
You Tube to
* - 1. 14

catch up. it
was so funny
that the cre
ator of show,
David
Chase, didn't
even de
mand that it
get taken
down (since
it included
footage from

"The Sopranos," which we all know normally
makes HBO very angry).
5. "24" — I always wait to watch this on DVD,
and I have also heard that this season is defi
nitely among the weaker ones, but we all
know that the last few episodes of a season of
"24" are always the most exciting. This season
concludes with two episodes on May 21.
6. "PCD Presents: The Search for the Next
Doll" — We all have our one trashy reality
show that we arc inexplicably devoted to.

Some people still care who the next Amer
l ican Idol will be. I — without reason —

find myself mildly addicted to "PCD
Presents ..." 1 feel confident admit-

ting this in writing now since 1 re
cently learned at a birthday dinner
for some of my friends that there
are at least three other people be
sides me who also carc who the next
Pussycat Doll will be. The suspense
ends on April 24. We'll probably
never see or hear from the winner

again after that (much like
America's Next Top

Models don t exactly be
come top models), but
I'm alright with that. I ac
tually don't even listen to
or much like the Pussy
cat Dolls — 1 somehow
just enjoy this show (and
contrary to what my
brother may say, it does
not lower one's 10.. ■ be
cause that's not possible,
right?).

whether someone will live or die. and whether
or not an apocalypse will be prevented. That
being said, a cliffhanger done right can also be
genius (think back to the ending of the first
season of "Alias").

50... considering all of the above, here is a
list of upcoming season finales that I am most
eagerly anticipating or, at the very least, have
high hopes will not prove disappointing for
you:
1. "Heroes" — Although only in its fresh
man year. I've already become very at
tached to this show (with the exception of
Niki/Jessica/Brooke Taylor Windham from
"Legally Blonde" ... I hate her and think
she's a waste of time). I can't wait to see
everyone join up and "Save the World" (or
at least New York). "Heroes" returns April
23 and concludes on May 21.
2. "The Office" — There hasn't really been
that big of a season-long plotline on "The Of
fice" this year (like last season's Jim and Pam
bit), but each episode is always funny, and I'm
sure the finale won't disappoint. Whether
Michael is using Wikipedia negotiation tactics
to get a raise, Jim is convincing Dwight that
he's a vampire or Dwight is being Dwight,
"The Office" always makes me chuckle. This
season concludes on May 10 with an office trip
to the beach.
3. "Grey's Anatomy" — I haven't loved this
season of Grey's as much as the last one (for
awhile not that much was happening... every
one was just whining), but recently 1 think it
has been improving. And we all know that
everyone watches it... even Bill Clinton re
cently admitted that it was among his favorite
TV shows. Also, the last two episodes are sup
posed to be setting up a spin-off for Addison,
and 1 am intrigued to see how that turns out.
Finale airs on May 10.

4. HBO — Granted I am cheating here, since
HBO is obviously a network and not a show.
However, since I imagine that most people at
Stanford don't even get HBO (myself includ
ed), it seemed like it should only get one entry
dedicated to it. Be sure to check out the finale
of "Entourage" (by either making the right
kind of HBO-purchasing friends or using
other entirely legal methods ...), which re
turned for the second half of its third season
last Sunday and concludes on May 20. Also on
May 20 is the series finale of "The Sopranos."
I know a lot of people have probably given up

on "The Sopranos since it airs

so infrequently, but I always
like to in the very least see

how a series that I used to
watch ultimately con
cludes (like "The OC,"
which ended in February,
except that I may have
never stopped watching <
that one). You can also
watch the brilliant 7 1/2
Sopranos clip made by

two fans on
You Tube to
* - 1. 14

catch up. it
was so funny
that the cre
ator of show,
David
Chase, didn't
even de
mand that it
get taken
down (since
it included
footage from

"The Sopranos," which we all know normally
makes HBO very angry).
5. "24" — I always wait to watch this on DVD,
and I have also heard that this season is defi
nitely among the weaker ones, but we all
know that the last few episodes of a season of
"24" are always the most exciting. This season
concludes with two episodes on May 21.
6. "PCD Presents: The Search for the Next
Doll" — We all have our one trashy reality
show that we arc inexplicably devoted to.

Some people still care who the next Amer
l ican Idol will be. I — without reason —

find myself mildly addicted to "PCD
Presents ..." 1 feel confident admit-

ting this in writing now since 1 re
cently learned at a birthday dinner
for some of my friends that there
are at least three other people be
sides me who also carc who the next
Pussycat Doll will be. The suspense
ends on April 24. We'll probably
never see or hear from the winner

again after that (much like
America's Next Top

Models don t exactly be
come top models), but
I'm alright with that. I ac
tually don't even listen to
or much like the Pussy
cat Dolls — 1 somehow
just enjoy this show (and
contrary to what my
brother may say, it does
not lower one's 10.. ■ be
cause that's not possible,
right?).
