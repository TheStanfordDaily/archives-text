# The
						Godfather
## Find the horse's head in your bed this Sunday 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION GODMOTHER 
If you don't go to FLiCKS this Sunday, you
might end up with a horse head in your bed
— or at least a handful of caterpillars in your
hair. This week, FLiCKS is presenting the
great granddaddy- of all modern gangster
films, the-epic and legendary "The Godfa
ther" (1972), directed by Francis Ford Cop
pola.
"The Godfather" is consistently ranked as
one of the greatest American films ever
made. Chances are, if you have tangential
access to any form of media broadcasting,
you have already seen either it or at least one
of its innumerable parodies everywhere
from"The Simpsons" to "Saturday Night
Life." In terms of the gangster genre, it's
right up there with Martin Scorsese's "Good
fellas" and "Growing Up Gotti" marathons

on E!
But if you're totally out of the loop, the
story focuses on young Italian American
WWII war hero Michael Corleone (an al
most dangerously good-looking Al Pacino)
as he comes home to take over the Mafia dy-

nasty from his father, dying
mob boss Don Vito Cor
leone (Marlon Brando). Al
though Michael is happy
with his relatively safe civil
ian life, he is gradually
sucked into the family busi
ness by a cast of eccentric
characters: his starry-eyed,
sycophantic brother Fredo;
his eldest brother. Sonny, a

first-class lunkhead: and an array of mob un
derbosses packing more heat than a
menopause convention.
Although "The Godfather" is packed to

"I'm gonna
make him an
offer he can't
refuse."

the gills with guns, car chases and foxy
women with hideous '70s hairdos, it's also a
study of eternal them£s like the costs of secu
rity, the ambiguity of evil and the problemat
ic relationship between a son and a father
who kills people for money. It's basically

Hamlet with Bronx accents
and heroin.
Whether you're an obses
sive "Godfather" addict or
have never seen a gangster
movie in your life, you should
check it out this weekend. It's
an anthropological experi
ence: Guys get to cry manly,
manly tears about their own
father/son relationships;

women can get adrenaline highs from the
thousands of machine gun bullets that pour
on-screen; and everyone will leave craving
cannoli.
