# Japanese Film Festival
## 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION FAN BOY 
1960 was an important year in the history of Japan
ese film. It marked a peak in film production and saw
the emergence of several new/filmmaking talents at
j the same time that established directors like Akira
I Kurosawa and Mikio Naruse continued to dazzle
their audiences. Beginning tonight, this important
i year in Japanese cinema is being celebrated with its
own film festival: "Japan 1960: Classic Cinema
Meets the New Wave." The scries continues until
June 1 with screenings on Friday evenings at 7:30
p.m. in Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium. Seven
films arc featured in the lineup and the screenings
are open to the public. The films are subtitled and
three of the film reels were shipped from Japan
specifically for the event.
This is the third time Stanford has hosted a film sc
ries on Japanese film. The first was in 2003. focused on
influential director Yasujiro Ozu. The second series
was held in 2005 and it centered on the actress Kinuyo
Tanaka.
Scries coordinator Jim Reichert. a professor in the
Department of Asian Languages and self-proclaimed
film fan, chose to base this year's series around 1960"

because it marked "a peak in creativity among Japan
ese filmmakers." In addition to the directors listed
above, the festival is also screening movies from film
makers who were still making a name for themselves
at the time. These include Nagisa Oshima and Shohei
Imaniura.
Reichert notes that 1960 also saw "considerable civil
turmoil as students and activists demonstrated against
the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance." The influences of
the U.S.-Japanese relationship, in particular, is the
focus of Imamura's "Hogs and Battleships."
Other films in the series include Kurosawa's re
working of Hamlet, "The Bad Sleep Well." and Ozu's
family drama "Late Autumn." The former features a
wonderful performance from long-time Kurosawa
collaborator Toshiro Mifune while the latter is Re
ichert's personal pick of the series.
At the moment. Japanese cinema is assbciated with
two genres in particular: animation ("Spirited Away"
and "Howl's Moving Castle") and the so-called J-Hor
ror movies ("Ring" and"The Grudge"). More than
anything, "Japan 1960" demonstrates that this was not
always the case. 1960. in particular, was a year of great
variety and richness in Japanese film. The "Japan
1960" festival offers film-goers a rare opportunity to
appreciate this fact.
