# When a Woman Ascends the Stairs

### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION STAIR ASCENDER 
In watching Mikio Narusc's "When a Woman Asccnds the
Stains" (1960). one might find it hard to believe that the film
was shot almost five decades ago. The story immerses the
viewer in the everyday woes of a geisha in post-WWll Japan
named Keiko (also referred to as "Mama"), who is masterful
ly played by Hidcko Takaminc.
Keiko is struggling to make ends meet as she approaches
what hopefully will prove to be (as one person terms it) a "'turn
ing point" in her life. In entering her middle-aged years, Keiko
recognizes that if she wants to do well for herself, she must ei
ther find a husband or start her own geisha bar. As a woman in
her social position at this time, these are the only choices she
has in order to have a hope of attaining any self-sufficiency.
While trying to retain her modest ("conservative," as she
puts it) approach to the geisha business, Keiko is constantly
pressured by others to abandon her standards for self respect
in order to bring in more "business." She's encouraged hy
those around her to more aggressively court customers via
phone solicitations (which is not becoming of a proper geisha,
in her opinion), dress more provocatively (her co-workers
urge her to wear "brighter" and more striking clothes) and go
a bit farther with her customers than she might be comfortable
with.
As if that all were not enough, soon a tempting offer comes
about that would allow her to start her own bar, but at a steep
cost. Keiko's decisions only become all the more difficult as
the plot progresses. All the while, her family is convinced she
is selfishly indulging in "high life" luxuries because of the ex
pensive lifestyle that she maintains (which she argues is nec
essary to be able to cultivate the proper image for herself in
her line of work).
The movie is notable for the stirring performances delivered
by Takamine, who perfectly fits the bill as a geisha desperately
seeking to maintain her decency and autonomy in a world that
gives her few attractive life options, and her fellow geishas (as
well as the many curious customers that she entertains by
night). While the pace of the film gets a bit slow in the middle,
and there's a seemingly unneeded (and heartbreaking) side
story involving a certain chubby factory owner, all in all there is
still plenty to like in this flick. In particular, it's enlightening to
see such a stark and honest portrayal of the limited life choices
available to such a workingwoman. It's not the representation
you might expect given the time period when the film was re
leased, but that's exactly what makes the movie continue to be
so relevant nearly 50 years after its initial release.
