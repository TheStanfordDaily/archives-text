## The 						Bad Sleep Well 
### MARCO HERNANDEZ INTERMISSION SOLID SLEEPER 
/
When a Japanese movie comes out with name like "The
Bad Sleep Well," the first thing that comes to mind is some
sort of Japanese-Western hybrid flick or a Ouentin Taranti
no experiment. Disappointingly for all the "Kill Bill" fans,
director Akira Hurosawa's mystery about embezzlement,
corruption and a string of suicides is no Tarantino flick. This
is not necessarily bad since it means the movie is not afflict
ed by larantino's hit-and-miss visions of artistic grandeur
("Grindhouse," anyone?). On the contrary, this 1960s flick
is a far more conventional movie that is shy, yet powerful.
The first 10 minutes are somewhat confusing. We see re
porters flock the wedding of a well-off lame girl (the film's
vocabulary, not mine) for no apparent reason. However, the
movie quickly reaches a good pace and most of the charac
ters are fleshed out sufficiently for the plot to make sense.
After the police investigate a government agency, bureau
crats begin to drop like flies. A mysterious individual knows
the top officials have something to do with a similar suicide
that took place five years prior. He pops into the scene and
the top officials are scared out of their pants.
One of the oddities of this film is the acting talent. Toshire
Mifune, one of Japan's greatest actors, plays a two-faced
avenger who infiltrates the enemy's home. Most of the other
actors deliver superb performances as well. The supporting
characters sometimes seem like caricatures of themselves,
which confused the heck out of me since this isn't a comedy.
The plot is great because it's not far-fetched. Although the
film takes place 15 years after World War 11, the corrupt gov
ernment agency and white-collar crime in this movie are
reminiscent of the World Com and Enron scandals that seri
ously hurt the public's trust of corporations. In a way, the
movie provides a commentary on issues such as government
transparency and social standing — Mifune's character is a
bastard — and these topics only add to the richness of the
movie rather than taking away from it. j
Through and through the film is a true gem of 1960s
Japanese cinema, even if the ending leaves much to be de
sired. Where the pace of the movie had me expecting a
grand, loud gasp-inspiring ending. I only got a downer with
a bit of karmic payback. Despite this. "The Bad Sleep Well"
is definitely not a film that puts viewers to sleep.
