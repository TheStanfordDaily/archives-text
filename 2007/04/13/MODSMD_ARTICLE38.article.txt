# The 						Island
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION ISLANDER 
Very rarely is there a film that says so much with so lit
tle. Kaneto Shindo's "The Island" is a film completely de
void of dialogue, but is also not exactly a silent film, as
sound effects and scoring are employed to great effect.
What's more, the plot of the film — that the daily life of a
family living on a small island is suddenly interrupted by
tragedy — is remarkably simple, yet it is in this simplicity
that the film achieves a rare level of beauty and emotion.
The bulk of the flick is spent focusing on the routines of
the family. Without a word, they row in to the mainland to
fetch fresh water, irrigate their crops, feed their animals
and prepare dinner. However, just because no one says a
word doesn't mean the film lacks conversation: Shindo
draws meaning and indication from every glance and ex
pression on the family members' faces, so while nothing is
said, the audience still receives a profound amount of in
sight into the world of the characters and their feelings for
one another. A meticulous level of detail into all as
pects of each shot — camera work, blocking, acting —
and just as the viewer is drawn in close, the sound effect of
an oar cutting through water will jar them into alertness,
the lone sound echoing the solitary nature of this family's
isolated life on the island.
The film takes its time, repeating scenes of mealtime and
farmwork, but Shindo provides each action with enough
care so each watered crop and row of the boat paddle
seems to carry its own meaning. By the time an event oc
curs that completely rips the family from their normal
lives, the viewer has been given a deep look into their daily
lives, and the result is all the more effective. Watching the
devastation on each family member's face in complete si
lence is altogether stunning, and few films of any number
of words are able to emote as much of an emotional heft.
Of course, a film totally devoid of dialogue and primar
ily concerning the routines of a normal family will tend to
drag or become repetitive occasionally, but the overall
payoff of "The Island" is huge. It is a heartfelt, rewarding
and extremely unique film — one that shouldn't be
missed.
