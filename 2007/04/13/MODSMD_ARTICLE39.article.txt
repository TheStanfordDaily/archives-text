# Late Autumn

### WEENA PUN INTERMISSION SEASON EXPERT 
Fans of "300" will not like this Hick. There are no robust
I supermen screeching at the top ot their lungs in costumes
I reduced to bloody red eapes and underwear. There arc no
[elephantine wolves or wolfish elephants. You won't feel a
I rush of adrenaline in your bloodstream, nor will this movie
split your sides with laughter or make you want you to cud-1
die with your significant other. Instead, "Late Autumn"!
shows two demure and coy Japanese women battling to
keep their relationship alive.
The movie opens with a memorial service held for Mr.
I Miwa. who has been dead for six years now. The time peri
od is a decade or two after the Second World War. The late
Mr. Miwa is survived by his widow Akiko and daughter
Ayako (Aya) as well as three of his closest friends from col
lege. Apparently, they are all concerned about Aya's mar
riage situation. Given her beauty and gentleness, they don't
want her to go to waste and start searching for potential
suitors. It is then revealed that the daughter does not want
to marry because she is reluctant to leave her widowed
mother alone in an apartment all by herself. When the three
friends (all of whom in their youth had fallen in love with
the mother Akiko) find this out, they plan to re-marry the
mother off so that the daughter is then free to marry as well.
What then ensues is sometimes humorous and sometimes
embarrassing but mostly the heart-wrenching truth about
the mother-daughter bond.
Filial love is the center of the movie, but a humble love
story of the daughter with her boyfriend comes at odds with
it. The movie ends in what most people would agree to be a
natural way, but it could be said to raise the question of fu
tility of love. To find about which "love" 1 am talking about
here (filial or adult), one has to watch this wonderful film.
If you cared more about the cape Gerard Butler was wear
ing in "300," I can promise you'll be disappointed. But if
you at all felt a heavy heart when the queen holds that lock
et in her hand in the end, you will not forget "Late Au
tumn."
