('onsistency is a simple hut absolutely essen
tial part ul gymnastics, and with an unwavering
season of at least fourth or better in the nation
al rankings, consistency is a quality that the
Stanford women are counting on as they travel
to Tucson. Ariz. There, they will look to tumble
their way to the top tomorrow at b p.m. as the
No. I seed in the NCAA Regional champi
onships.
• The team has been one of the most consis
tent teams that I have witnessed in my gymnas
tics career." coach Kristen Smyth said. "We
have been having great practices, and we hope
to build off of our performance at the Pac-IOV
The team finished a close second to UCLA
at the Pac-10 Championships.The Cardinal put
forth a strong team effort, but Smyth said some
gaps will be filled in before regionals.
"Improvement on details of beam and floor,
stuck landings on the vault and aggressive bar
routines with hit handstands and concise move
ments will need to be made if we really want to
do well at regionals," she said.
In preparation for the regional
competition, the team had a mock
meet last Saturday, in which the
women showed some of their best
team efforts all year. Now is the time
of the season when the girls' training
is tapering off, the hard conditioning
is over and the time for attention to
details, focus and perfection of rou
tines is here.
"We hit 24 for 24 routines at the
mock meet, a goal that we have for
every competition," sophomore
Nicole Ourada said. "It was very en
couraging to accomplish that the
weekend before regionals."
Smyth was impressed by her
team's enthusiasm and energy going
into regional competition.
"On Saturday, the girls showed
me their determination and desire to
do well at regionals," Smyth said.
"They are starting to feel a hop in
their step — they are working hard
but bringing fun to the sport at the
same time."
After being edged out by Oregon
State in last year's regional champi
onships, junior Tabitha Yim said the
team has plenty of motivation to get
even.
"The Card are looking to send
OSU a message this year." Yim said.
"They beat us out in our house last
year, so we have a wake-up call to
give them."
The rivalries and outcome of the
meet are high priorities for Stanford,

but the one thing that the team never
loses sight of is the fun of the sport.
"Our first priority is to have fun,"
freshman Blair Ryland said. "We
love each and every girl, we love gym
nastics together. We do well when we
have fun because we love what we
do."
"The family atmosphere that we
have is not something that every
team has," she continued. "We are
lucky and grateful for it, and 1 think
our success is partly due to our close
knit team."
Two members of that family —
juniors Liz Tricase and Yim — are
bouncing back from injuries into full
action for regionals. Their coming
back could positively impact the con
fidence of the team, but their return
also raises some difficult questions in
terms of the line-up for Smyth.
"Emotions will have to be man
aged, but it just comes down to hav
ing the most consistent gymnast com
pete," Smyth said. "Each gymnast un
derstands their value. Even if you're
not competing, you are going
through the emotional roller coaster
of the meet with everybody, and con
tributing any way that you possibly
can."
The Stanford women are compet
itively strong, top to bottom. They
will keep with the theme and goal of
the entire season, hitting all 24 rou
tines. Indeed, junior Aimee Precourt
said that the pressure of this week
end's regional meet does not change
that goal at all.
"Every weekend, we're hitting 24
for 24 regardless of the meet," she
said."lt is something that we can con
trol."
The top two teams, individual all
arounders and event winners will
qualify for the national champi
onship. Apr. 26 in Salt Lake City.
