### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION HOG LOVER 
"Hogs and Battleships" (1961) isn't a movie that will
leave a good taste in your mouth. Harsh and brutal, cyni
cal and even angry, there aren't a lot of flicks that so vehe
mently criticize while leaving so little room for air. Direc
tor lmamura Shohei's film about 5 young rtian named
Kinta who goes to work at a pig pen on a local U.S. mili
tary base is a relentless critique on both the American oc
cupation of Japan and moral corruption in Japanese soci
ety in general. But what truly separates it from other social
commentaries is its refusal to allow anyone, including pro
tagonist Kinta, any form of respite from scorn. The result
is a film that, while anything but warm, makes for com
pelling, unforgettable viewing.
On the surface. "Hogs and Battleships" is very much a
film about a gangster trying to go straight. After Kinta,
whose hobbies include enticing American sailors with
prostitutes, is put in charge of the pig pen, he is recruited
by his yakuza gang to sell food scraps through the black
market for profit. His girlfriend wants him to leave the
gang lifestyle, but she herself is pulled into the seedy un
derworld of crime. The outlook, however, is uniquely
bleak, and over time it becomes clear that we are watching
hard-nosed individuals with little hope of moral repen
tance. Kinta becomes something of an anti-hero, although
that term is almost inappropriate as there is surprisingly lit
tle "heroic" about him.
The film is well shot and acted with a great deal of ener
gy, given an intense and rough-edged feel that emphasizes
the corruption that permeates all aspects of society. As a
gangster talc it succeeds on the level of entertainment, but
the themes of distrustful authority and ethical futility can
now be seen as (albeit somewhat exaggeratedly) applica
ble to the current world â€” especially issues concerning
military occupation. It pulls no punches in its critiquc of
America's post-World War II involvement in Japan just as
it leaves no portion of Japanese culture unscathed.
On top of its effective commentary, "Hogs and Battle
ships" is a fast-moving, energetic yakuza tale that works in
a very basic way. It has a harsh negativity about it. a bleak
ness that may turn some viewers away. But all in all, it is
good entertainment, made only more valuable by being
laced with a fierce, ruthless underlying message.
