## Get a taste of delicacy with gelato 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION GELATO QUEEN 
Across from the Apple Store on Uni
versity Avenue, Michael's Gelato & Cafe
is the perfect after-dinner place to go if
you've got a little room left in your stom
ach. With about 30 flavors of gelato to
choose from, even the pickiest of people
can find a flavor that suits his taste. In ad
dition, just in case you're not sure what
flavor to taste (and making the wrong de
cision could be a potential catastrophe, as
we all know), the owner is more than will
ing to allow you to try as many flavors as
you like. In fact, giving the different fla
vors a whirl — most of which were deli
cious — was almost more fun than actual
ly eating my cup of gelato.

Of the flavors, there were a few especially
notable hits. Cookies and cream was a fa
vorite for all and seemed to be the most pop
ular choice. Extra creamy with crushed
Oreos, the only criticism was that there were
not enough cookies. Another great flavor
was the vanilla gelato, which was far from
boring, as one might expect plain vanilla to
be. My personal favorite was the blueberry
cheesecake, which was a smooth blend of
fruit and cake — not too sweet, not too
bland. Each bite seemed to melt in my
mouth.
The Papa Rock flavor was also an inter
esting and delicious blend mixing dark
chocolate, walnuts, almonds and marsh
mallows into a chunky Rocky-road version
of gelato. Meanwhile, a refined, delicate
flavor constituted the Gianduia, a mix of

Piedmont nuts and chocolate, with neither
flavor overpowering the other. For a less
chocolately taste, there are many fruit fla
vors such as lemon custard and mixed berry
sorbet that have a lighter and less creamy
taste to them. Some of the "just Okay" fla
vors we tried 'vere dulce de leche and cof
fee toffee, which were just a little too sweet
for me and most others. There were also a
few unique flavors like green tea, whose
taste resembled that of a Starbucks green
tea frappuchino.
However, there is a down side ... the
prices. For a small cup, it will cost you $3.75,
for a medium cup. $5.00, and for a large cup,
$6.00. But Michael's definitely packs a good
amount of gelato into a small cup, and espe
cially if you have already eaten dinner, a
small cup should more than suffice. More

over, the gelato, at least in my opinion, is
well worth the cost. It's of much better qual
ity than the other ice cream places I have
tried in Palo Alto, (not to mention the fact
that gelato, although creamier, is actually
healthier than ice cream!). The presentation
of the gelato is also quite fancy, coming in a
colorful, frosted cup with a cute miniature
spoon ... with a spoon of that size, you're
forced to eat your treat slowly, making the
savory taste last even longer.
So if you feel like having a little extra
something after dinner, Michael's is your
place. With music, a bright, colorful atmos
phere and extra-friendly service, this little
gelato caf6 is a happening establishment. It
really is a special, although pricey, place to
go — perfect if you want something a little
more exciting than Haagen-Dazs.
