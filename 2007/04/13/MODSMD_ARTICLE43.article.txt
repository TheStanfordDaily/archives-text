### ELIZA FOX INTERMISSION GOSSIPER 
There is definitely truth to the idea of the
Stanford bubble. With the exception of PoliS
ci majors and that kid who obnoxiously reads
The New York Times just to show everyone
else up, we don't really have much to talk
about besides parties and caterpillars. For
some of us, though, news on foreign wars isn't
the only thing missing. For those of us who live
for supermarket checkout lines, who can stay
up into the night checking Pop Sugar and
Dlisted, who really only go to the gym to read
Us Weekly anyway, the lack of celebrity gos
sip can be a painful thing too.
Sure we don't actually believe most of it, and
sure we usually make fun of it, and sure we dis
, like most celebrities most of the time. But
I they're like the high school friends who drove
you insane and whom you now miss like crazy.
So for those of you out there who understand
I — we few. we happy few, we band of gossipers
— here's what we've been missing.
The "baby bump" trend is, sadlv, still in full
swing. This slightly-malicious game of watch
| ing celebrities' minute weight swings is, I'm

/
convinced, merely a ploy to make the rest of us
feel better about being able to pig out on East
er candy because we're not famous enough to

incite speculation. For those
who actually care, though,
Nicole Kidman isn't pregnant.
Her friend Naomi Watts, how
ever, is.
Apparently the "it's a
dietT'it's surgery" fun hasn't
stopped either. Courtney Love
has recently dropped 44
pounds. Some say it's diet, some
say it's gastric bypass. The real
question, though: Why do we
care? |
Us Weekly, People Maga
zine, Pop Sugar and Dlisted are
all excited about a romance be
tween Jake Gyllenhaal and
Reese Witherspoon. Don't get
your hopes up, though. The ro
mance is so "very, very secret"
that all even the most imagina-

tive reporters have to go on is a few sightings
of the two in the same place at the same time,
which is particularly ridiculous once you real

ize that the two are co-starring in the movie
"Rendition.'' Come on guys, you can do better
than that. It's like saying that Ryan Phillippe

hooked up with Lind
say Lohan and Ashlee
Simpson. Oh wait, you
said that, too.
In other "because
once you were 13 and
Lindsay Lohan was
cool" news, Lindsay
and Hilary Duff have
buried the hatchet and
are now buddies. This

makes me sad.

because I
v liked them

more when
' they were

' fighting. In
an overly-

manicured,

drugged-up Holly
wood, two girls fighting

seemed somehow... normal. Plus, like all cat
fights, it was fun to watch.
Tori Spelling had a baby, Liam Aaron Mc-

Dermott. This is extremely exciting for her,
I'm sure, but since 1 never really cared about
Tori anyway, it's not that exciting for me.
Jason Whaler, that guy from"The Hills"
and "Laguna Beach" (you know, that show
that we all "didn't watch" because we were
out saving the world and such) just got ar
rested last weekend. Again. Actually, for
the fourth time, although I wasn't aware of
the first three. Also. Hayden Panettiere is
dating Stephen Colletti (the guy from sea
son one, made famous for me by my
friend's line: "There's only one reason to
watch this show, and its name is Stephen").
Go figure.
Additionally, Kate Hudson and Owen Wil
son have apparently been a real-deal couple
since February. This makes me sad, not be
cause they're not cute (they are), but because
I feel out of the loop for just finding out now.
But regardless of my feelings, they've recently
been cavorting in Australia with Luke's bless
ing (because that really mattered).
And that's just the beginning of the fun. And
you have to admit to yourself, if not to anyone
else, that you missed it. Hey, at least now you
have a reason to go to the gym.
