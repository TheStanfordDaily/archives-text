## A-Muse Concert! 
### DEAN SCHAFFER INTERMISSION MUSER 
® Anyone who goes to San Francisco with two
• friends on a Monday night to see Muse, one of the
— biggest hands in Europe, probably expects weird
and surprising things to happen. I know 1 did.
• During my trip, the most unusual incident was not
one of my friends left his ticket in his dorm
room (that was predictably disastrous). It wasn't
• wlicn my other friend tried to insert a five-dollar
fhill in a machine's credit card slot (that was just hi
larious). Nor was it that Muse's opening act was
® called Immigrant, despite the fact that all five
0 members are San Francisco natives (I had already
guessed they were a bit slow on the uptake —
'they looked like Cal graduates). And it wasn't
that Muse totally fucking rocked (that was ex
_ pected). Nor was it that not one, not two. but zero
people tried to sell me drugs (though that was the
•runner-up).
0 Indeed, the strangest and most surprising
episode of my jaunt took place just a few minutes
•before Muse came onstage. While waiting pa
tiently with my friends in the pit, 1 turned my head
to look at the balcony when I caught sight of a
• small plastic object flying through the air in my
direction. Before I could even react, it hit
me in the shoulder and landed in my hand. It took
®me about 10 seconds to realize that this projectile

was actually a small
container of water
based "sensual lubri
cant." I couldn't sec
who threw it, but. in
retrospect, 1 think I
can reasonably as
sume that it was God
(Muse seems right up
His alley). I didn't re
alize it at the time,
but someone was try
ing to tell me some
thing: "You're going
to need this lube,
buddy. The night's
gonna get wild."
To clarify. 1 am not
insinuating that 1 had
agonizingly unpleas
ant sex at the concert,
merely that the lube
would have
smoothed out my
rough — and some
times painful — ex
perience in the pit.
But what does one
call the breathtaking
feeling (literally) of

thousands of bodies pushing against one another
to the pounding beat of a bass drum? How does
• one describe the unbearable physical pressure

and the nearly maddening desire for a breath of
fresh air?
It's called being in the Pit. It's called Rocking
Out. It's called Living.
From "Take a Bow" and "Hysteria" (Muse's
first two songs of the night) to "Stockholm Syn
drome" (the last song of the first encore) to
"Knights of Cydonia" (the last song of the sec
ond, final encore), Muse proved that Rock —
yes, with a capital "R"— is not dead. As the
group's guitarist and lead singer, Matthew Bel
lamy showcased the raw vocal and instrumental
talent that is his trademark in a performance
that was nearly flawless (he played the incredi
ble tapping solo at the end of "Invincible" with
note-for-note perfection) and always exhilarat
ing. He and his bandmates, Chris Wolstcn
holme (bass) and Dominic Howard (drums),
unleashed song after song with the energy and
musicianship that make Muse one of the best
live bands today. Although the group per
formed nearly every track off its latest album,
"Black Holes and Revelations," and several
numbers from 2003's breakthrough "Absolu
tion," they didn't shy away from old and rela
tively obscure favorites, including "Plug in
Baby," "Citizen Erased," "Feeling Good" and
"Sunburn."
Although many talented bands perform well
musically, few put on a truly great show. Muse, on
the other hand, managed to keep things interest-

ing. Before launching
into an electrifying ren
dition of "Stockholm
Syndrome," Bellamy
used his guitar's bizarre
"chaos pad" (don't ask
— I really have no clue
what it is) to create an
impromptu techno
breakdown over
Howard's beats. No one
knew what the hell was
going on. but everyone
loved it. Moments like
that make for a truly
memorable concert.
To say I was wet with
sweat by the time it was
all over wouldn't be ac
curate. "Drenched"
would be a more appro
priate adjective. Gross?
Yes. Relevant? Proba
bly not. But I'll be
damned if that wasn't
one of the greatest con
certs I've ever seen. De
spite my lofty expecta
tions, I was blown away.
I should've used the.

lube to make my time in the pit a bit more enjoy
able. but I have no regrets. All in all. let's just say
1 was pleasantly surprised.
