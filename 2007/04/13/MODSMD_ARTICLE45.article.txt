### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION DIAMOND 
At the ripe age of 19, Joss Stone has already accomplished more than many musi
cians hope to do in a lifetime. In 2005, she won "Best British Female Solo Artist" and
was nominated for three Grammies, including Best New Artist, Best Female Pop
Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. She has toured with The Rolling
Stones and has performed onstage with the likes of James Brown. Gladys Knight, Ste
vie Wonder, John Legend and Santana. Just last week, her third record and first release
in the U.S., "Introducing Joss Stone," debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200. making it the
highest ever debut for a British female solo artist.
Some have declared that Stone has the looks of Britney with the pipes of Whitney.
Others have called her a white Aretha Franklin. To whomever she is compared, there
is no denying the girl is hot and that she has the talent to match. Her vocal range and
control are phenomenal, and her funk-meets-soul-meets-R&B sound will get your toes
tapping and your head bopping. While Stone's first record, "Soul Sessions," was a col
lection of covets. Stone's second album. "Mind, Body, Soul," debuted Stone's song
writing abilities; the singer-songwriter felt, however, that neither of her first two
records reflected her true musical style. On her third album, she wrote every song but
one and declares it is "truly me. That's why I'm calling it 'Introducing Joss Stone.'
These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist."
Stone dabbles in many styles, and her latest record proves almost impossible to cat
egorize. "Tell Me What We Are Gonna Do Now," which features the rapper Com
mon, opens with a decidedly reggae beat. "Music" is much more hip-hop, and the reclu
sive Fugee-member Lauryn Hill loans her vocals to the track. "Arms of My Baby" has
a salsa back-beat while "Baby, Baby, Baby" has a strong '70s soul sound, with its call
and-response back-up singers, simple rhyming chorus, brass-heavy background and
improvised vocal flourishes. Her single, "Tell Me 'Bout It," is equally retro, but with a
modern edge and sexier lyrics. She sings, "I need a little lovin' at least two/ Times a day./
So when I call ya boy, you better run/ Here right away./ Let's have a show of hands,
who's/ Addicted to their man?/ If 1 could do the things I want to you 7 You'd be chang
ing all your plans."
Despite Stone's sexy star appeal and U.S. success, some view her third album as a
let-down, introducing" debuted at #12 in the U.K. while her previous album topped
the charts. Although her most recent record is supposed to be her first original triumph,
it has received mixed reviews from critics, and her singles have done worse than origi
nally projected. Admittedly, Stone's vocals can be overloaded at times. Some songs
seem to bleed into the more memorable ones as she presents a fourteen-song onslaught
of funk and soul.
Regardless of sales or sky-high expectations, however. Stone is unimaginably young
and talented, and she has all the time in the world to hone her voice and sharpen her
sound. "Introducing" is full of life, sexy and undeniably soulful â€” Stone is a diamond
in the ruff, and she's well on her way to making music history.
