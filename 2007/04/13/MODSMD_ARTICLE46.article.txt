### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
We've all run into Japanese animation at some point — the
fanciful storylines, the impossible hairstyles, the equally im
possible bodily proportions. Let's face it — shorts that short
don't look that good on just any ordinary Japanese schoolgirl.
Even Roxy would be thy about slipping a pair of those on ...
or off. But everyone in Japanese anime (except for the villains,
of course) seems to \k of unusual physical attractiveness — if
you find certain iaeals attractive. The long-legged, fair
skinned Japanese schoolgirl with a tiny waist and a huge bust
to, well, round indisputably dominates the genre._
Roxy's really not complaining. She's grateful, in fact.

that the innocent-looking Wit ass-kicking school-

girl is a far cry from the geishas idealized in
days past. With their heavy makeup and \
dreary robes, Roxy is a little confused as to
why those women were so sexually desired
n..i .

anyway. But the geisha-schoolgirl contrast re- i
ally illustrates a cultural phenomenon that
seems to be typical of just about anywhere —
what really matters is not what individuals find

personally attractive, but what is in fashion in soci- 1
ety as a whole. And boy, are schoolgirls in fashion in
Japan.
It might seem that schoolgirls also have a fairly large

fan base in America. The classic short plaid skirt and '
sheer white shirt look is certainly popular on porn sites
and at parties of any kind. Roxy thinks that people just

—; — j ~ r 1 — j i
can't resist the tempting fantasy of innocence waiting to be
spoiled. At least, however, the porn sites and party get-ups
don't (usually) exploit real innocence. But it's a different

story in Japan.
In the Land of the Rising, um. Sun, it is quite easy and so
cially acceptable to purchase a real Japanese schoolgirl's
panties from a vending machine on your way to your re
spectable corporate job. Then, during your lunch break, you

can cave into the temptation t0... okay, not even Roxy is going
to go there.
In general. Roxy is all about tickling fancies. Fetishes? She's
got plenty. Being kinky, naughty or taboo in her personal life
is one of Roxy's greatest pleasures. It makes Roxy's proverbial
sun, er, rise, indeed. But she sees a few things wrong with the
situation in Japan.
First of all, Roxy thinks this must be creating a shortage of
underwear in Japanese cities and towns. Schoolgirls are liter
ally approached on the street on

their way to or from

school,

preferable after a

long day of gym workouts and lectures

in hot, airless rooms so the panties are more

"used," and offered money. Say a student does this a cou
ple of times a week. She'll be fresh out of underwear in a few
months, and Roxy finds that issue personally troubling. Think

of all the textile workers pulling double shifts and the Japan
ese housewives rushing out to buy more panties, of the unused
variety.
Second, why did whatever industry association that controls
schoolgirls' panties have to take all of the fun out of it by mak
ing them accessible in the same way that your corner grocery
store is? Isn't most of the excitement generated because you
feel like you're engaging in something dirty and secret, and,
oh, what would say if she knew? In Japan, you're
running to the store to pick up a jug of milk, a loaf of bread and
some used panties. "I'll take the yellow ones, please." What is
up with that?
But finally, all kidding aside, Roxy wonders what effect this

has on the schoolgirls themselves. Do they understand

what's happening to their used goods'? Do

their parents encourage them to
1_ * 1 A.l l_

bring home the extra cash,
or deprive them of lunch
. . . ?4.. i r* i.i

money as security? Do they
realize that their former un-

dergarments, and to some
extent, the schoolgirls them-

selves. are nothing more than
sex objects for a random per-

vert on the street?
In many countries, there are
laws against child pornography

and other forms of exploitation of
the youth. In Japan, however, this
seems to be an underdeveloped

panties are from real schoolgirls.
What is truly the difference, at least as
far as the customers are concerned?

Let them have their fun, but without ac

country. Or, Roxy will just sell you her panties. She can always
buy more from a vending machine.
