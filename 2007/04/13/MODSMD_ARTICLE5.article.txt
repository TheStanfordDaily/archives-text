The No. 12 Stanford Softball team is travel
ing south this weekend for a tough series of Pa
cific- 10 ( onference games against the Arizona
schools. Hie Cardinal will meet last year's
NCAA champion. No. 4 Arizona, today before
playing two games against No. 10 Arizona

slugger Kristie Fox (41 RBI) are players who

came at the hands of Arizona. Nonetheless.
Arizona State is in the midst of a three-game
losing streak, with each of those losses coming
by a 1 -0 margin.
Stanford's pitching will be critical to keep
ing the Sun Devils mired in their offensive
slump. The series might come at just the right
