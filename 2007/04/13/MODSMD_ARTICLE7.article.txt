# Golf driving for sixth win
## Card to host US Intercollegiate 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a long, successful season,
the No. 2 Stanford men's golf team
will host the U.S. Intercollegiate
tournament this weekend, which will
mark the Card's first home tourna
ment of the season, as well as its last
tournament before heading to the
Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Oregon.
The Cardinal has placed in the top
liv e in all nine tournaments in which
it has competed this year and will be
looking for its sixth tournament vic
tory this weekend — its best record
since the Tiger Woods era ('94-'96).
"We are really excited for this
weekend."coach Conrad Ray said."l
think that we have built up some
great motivation because the last
time we won this tournament was
1995. We are looking at this Stanford
event as the beginning of our post
season. The guys have been practic
ing hard and are excited to be able to
give it a run to see if we can pull in an
other victory."
The tournament will consist of 15
teams from across the nation:
Arkansas, Colorado State, Minneso
ta. Missouri, Nevada-Reno, Oregon
State, Rice, San Jose State. UC-
Davis, UC-Irvine. UNC'-Wilmington.
Washington. Washington State,
Xavier and Stanford.
The Cardinal is the highest-ranked
team that will participate in the 54-
hole tournament. UCLA won the
tournament last year with a two
round total of 578 after a rain storm
forced officials to end play early. Ju
nior Rob Grube took the individual
win with a score of 135.
"I think everyone is playing well
and working hard." Grube said.
"Everyone feels good about our
chances this week. I'm not into mak
ing predictions, but I'm looking for
ward to having a good week on our
home course, and hopefully we can
pull off a victory. After this, the only
thing that matters is making it to the
NCAAs in June. I know that we are
all looking forward to playing hard

Cardinal players have also
notched many great individual per

Each member of the team has com
peted in at least one event, and three
different members have golfed their
way to at least one individual victory
this season (Grube, senior Zack
Miller and freshman Joseph Bram

the highest individual rankings in the
country with Miller at 14th. Bramlett
at 20th. senior Matt Savage at 21st
and Grube at 31st.
"We've got eight guys who are all
playing well and deserve to be in the
line-up every week," Savage said.
"We've played well in every tourna
ment this year, but that doesn't
mean anything until now. We've got
the postseason coming up. and that
is when the tournaments start mat
tering. We're just going to keep
doing what we've been doing all
year: working hard and let the re
sults play out.
"It's always nice to play at home,"
he continued. "We know the course
well — where to hit it. how the putts
break. Even though that will be an
advantage, we've still got to hit the
shots and stick each of our game
plans. We're looking forward to hav
ing a good tournament and going out
to protect our home course."

enters the toughest part of its season.

best finishes in years.
Ibis season has been a lot of

together to form a great group of
friendships to build a wonderful
team dynamic. However, we really
won t be satisfied until we can put an
exclamation mark on our season by
doing well in the Pac-10 champi

long way to go because the most im
