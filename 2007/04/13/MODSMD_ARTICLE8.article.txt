## Sort species. Battle chaos.

Plato's world of forms really
does exist — 1 found it in Lon
don's Natural History Muse
um.
If you weave through the shriek
ing schoolkids. step beyond the ani
matronic dinosaurs and open an un
obtrusive mahogany door, you'll dis
cover a testament to the human com
pulsion to categorize. There are
rooms and rooms full of cabinets,
each with dozens of drawers bursting
with biological specimens. Should a
curator at the museum discover a
new species — a new trilobite fossil,
for instance — the curator tags the
specimen with the species' name and
locks it up in one of those infinite
cabinets.
Like Plato's forms, these speci
mens are the ideal prototypes of their
species. Biologists can access them to
determine if an animal they've found
is a brand-new species or if it match
es a species on file. There are thou
sands of these species prototypes in
London, and there are even more
housed in other museums.
The species archetypes are cer
tainly compelling. But ever since
Darwin, they're a bit obsolete scien
tifically. It's hard to have one repre
sentative of each species if no one
can't quite agree on what a species is.
Taxonomy, the science of classi
fying organisms, was much less com
plicated at its inception. Carolus
Linnaeus started the classification
frenzy in earnest in the 18th century,
naming and cataloging hundreds of
species, including our own. The
name Homo sapiens is an example
of another Linnaean contribution:
binomial nomenclature. In Lin
naeus' system, the name of the
genus goes first, and the species
name follows: Tyrannosaitrus rex
and Escherichia coli are two familiar
examples. And Linnaeus wasn't sat
isfied with just renaming animals.
The father of taxonomy was born
just "Carl." but he re-christened
himself "Carolus Linnaeus" in
honor of his new system.
In Linnaeus' day, the definition
of a species was clear-cut. A species
was a logical category, groups creat
ed by God that did not change over
time. Ironically, now that our pic
ture of evolution is much clearer,
our picture of a species is much
murkier.
Today, different definitions of
species vie for scientific recognition.
The biological species concept is the
definition presented in high school
textbooks. This definition states that
a species is a set of organisms that
can interbreed and produce fertile
offspring. A cat is an animal that can
make kittens with all other cats, but
not with hamsters or chickens. But
the definition starts to break down.
For example, all dogs are the same
species. In theory, a Great Dane and
a chihuahua could produce some
weird-looking offspring, but the ani
mals? relative sizes prevent any ac
tual lovemaking.
Conversely, some animals of dif
ferent species can interbreed. For ex

ample, ligers — lion-tiger hybrids —
are impressive half-ton felines with
pale stripes on tawny fur that result
when zoos do not cautiously segre
gate their big cats. In the animal
kingdom, ligers exist in a category
along with mules and other hybrids.
At the microscopic level, some bac
teria have foregone fornication for
strange DNA-swapping. Each pres
ents challenges to the biological
species concept.
But is there a better definition of
species? The phylogenetic species
concept is one contender. It defines
species based on their evolutionary
history. As soon as two groups of or
ganisms have sufficiently split, they
are separate species. No one can
argue with the logic of the phyloge
netic species concept, but the devil is
in the details. Who decides when
species have sufficiently split? What
happens if they start to separate and
then come back together ?
ITiis isn't just a philosophical de
bate. The Endangered Species Act
counts on the existence of species.
The U.S. is considering adding polar
bears to the list of endangered
species. Although this is good news
for polar bears, it's a bit awkward,
because — well, because polar bears
aren't a species. DNA testing has
confirmed that some brown bears (a
class which includes grizzlies and
Kodiak bears) are more related to
polar bears that they are to each
other. Polar bears can even inter
breed with grizzly bears — a hybrid
"pizzly bear" was recently discov
ered in the wild. It's shattering my el
ementarv-school illusions about
Arctic animals.
Species or not. most people think
polar bears should be saved. Anoth
er animal is more controversial. Pre
ble's meadow-jumping mouse is a
tiny rodent that hops about Col
orado and Wyoming. It's a threat
ened species that should be protect
ed —at least according to some.
Others say that Preble's mouse is no
different from the common meadow
jumping mouse, which is all over the
U.S. It just depends what you think a
species is.
It seems unlikely that the species
question will be settled anytime
soon. Humans battle life's chaos by
sorting, organizing and cataloging.
Thousands of specimens line the
drawers of the Natural History Mu
seum in quiet witness to the comfort
of clear-cut categories. Knowing that
species aren't as clear-cut as we think
doesn't make it easier to let go of
them. Were Linnaeus around next
month to blow out his 300thbirthday
candles, I think he'd understand.

because — well, because polar bears
aren't a species. DNA testing has
confirmed that some brown bears (a
class which includes grizzlies and
Kodiak bears) are more related to
polar bears that they are to each
other. Polar bears can even inter
breed with grizzly bears — a hybrid
"pizzly bear" was recently discov
ered in the wild. It's shattering my el
ementarv-school illusions about
Arctic animals.
Species or not. most people think
polar bears should be saved. Anoth
er animal is more controversial. Pre
ble's meadow-jumping mouse is a
tiny rodent that hops about Col
orado and Wyoming. It's a threat
ened species that should be protect
ed —at least according to some.
Others say that Preble's mouse is no
different from the common meadow
jumping mouse, which is all over the
U.S. It just depends what you think a
species is.
It seems unlikely that the species
question will be settled anytime
soon. Humans battle life's chaos by
sorting, organizing and cataloging.
Thousands of specimens line the
drawers of the Natural History Mu
seum in quiet witness to the comfort
of clear-cut categories. Knowing that
species aren't as clear-cut as we think
doesn't make it easier to let go of
them. Were Linnaeus around next
month to blow out his 300thbirthday
candles, I think he'd understand.
