## Student work shines at 'An Art Affair' 
### NICOLE DEMBY INTERMISSION FAIR GOER 
Students who found themselves in
White Plaza on Friday or Saturday may
have thought they were entering an alter
nate collegiate universe.Thanks to SLAC's
camping tents, where students were on the
third day of their hunger strike, and the
large music and art tents of the SOCA-or
ganized An Art Affair. Stanford felt a bit
more alternative than it usually does on
your average tourist-ridden weekend. It
was like stumbling, momentarily, on to the
campus of a small liberal arts school or
even of Stanford's historically hippy-er
and hipper rival.
The visual art show was a reminder that
even though the art community at Stan
ford is a small one. it is an immensely tal
ented one nonetheless. There were two
tents, the large main tent and a smaller tent
in which there were some art displays and
short film screenings Saturday night and
musical performances on Sunday. The art
work displayed was varied: it ranged from
the formal to the informal and included
many mediums, from the expected large
oil canvases and photograph series, to the
more unexpected—sculpture, sketchbook
pages, and even rock painting. The list
below highlights some of the best pieces
from An Art Affair, though by no means
includes all of the strong work that was dis
played.
Painting Highlights:
• Jessi Reel: Reel's large figurative oil
paintings are beautifully colored represen
tations of the human body, particularly
those of athletes. Her best works are two
opposing canvases, each depicting a mus
cled swimmer replete with swim cap and
goggles. Reel uses traditional figure paint
ing in an exaggerated, almost caricature
like manner in the style of contemporary
painter John Currin.
• The Surrealists: The Soo-Rae and Cyrus
Khajvandi represent Stanford's budding
Dalis. Shadowy figures lurk in Soo-Rae's
anime-inspired surrealist landscapes.
Khajvandi mixes acrylic and oil paints in
his colorfully imaginative landscapes to
create a beautiful texture effect. In one
painting, round, fleshy figures walk away
from the dark silhouette of a metropolis.
They are venturing into a stretch of land
with a solitary tree, behind which stands
a lone, shadowed figure with a red bal
loon. The painting evokes some sort of
reverse evolution, an escape from mod
ernism and return to a post-apocalyptic
Eden.
• Sara Sisun: Sisun's large oil paintings are
lovely and slightly sinister. Her large can
vases are wonderful, particularly "Convul
sion." a painting of an ambiguous figure in
red pajamas whose face is blurred as if it is
moving violently, but her best work is a

wistful painting entitled "The Long
Drive."This oil-on-paper piece is a thickly
painted. expressionistic depiction of a road
receding into the distance.
• Maria Sanchez: Sanchez's work is bright
and eye-catching. Her flat and wonderful
ly colored paintings are reminiscent of
Mexican folk art.
Photography Highlights.
• Trisha Huerta: Huerta's series of black
and-white portraits immediately recall the
current Richard Avedon exhibit at the
Cantor Arts center. Like Avedon. her sub
jects are set against a white background
and are very expressive, yet their expres
sions tend towards happier emotions than
those in the Avedon show.
• Katie Taylor: Taylor's "Urban land
scapes" series is beautiful and represents
some of the best photography in the show.
It captures, in crisp color, those oft-over
looked. idiosyncratic details of city envi
ronments. Her photographs portray the
beauty of cracked pavement, colorful
doors, and abandoned beer bottles.
• Christina McCauley: In her black and
white pictures taken in what appear to be
the mechanical engineering shops on cam
pus, Christina McCauley depicts an alien
mechanical universe of strange machines
and welders in what look like radiations
suits. In one out-of-focus photograph enti
tled "Mystery Machine." a ghostly hand
floats behind a large, unidentifiable ma
chine, a faint trace of human in the mecha
nized realm of the shop.
Some highlights in other mediums:
• Crispy Kim: Kim's wonderful paintings
on two stones and one piece of bark are
unexpected and refreshing. They embody
elements that are so often intertwined in
contemporary Japanese art: cuteness and
nature.
• Megan Miller: Miller's collage pieces
vary from the minimal "Paint Splatter Ex
periments 1 and 2," in which India ink
splatters are cut out and superimposed on
white paper, to "Four Seasons", her series
of four beautiful and slightly kitschy col
lage pieces that resist the usual tackiness of
collages made from magazine clippings.
• Molly Butcher: Butcher's hanging sculp
ture. made out of purple thread and white
strips of paper that curl onto the floor,
evokes sculptor Eva Hesse's organic mini
malism.
• In a smaller tent, bare sheets of black
paper were hung up and pastels were avail
able for children (and others) to draw on.
making the art an interactive affair.
It was heartening to see the display of
Stanford's community of visual artists. An
Art Affair was a reminder that small does
not mean marginal and that artists are
doing wonderfully creative things during
their time here.
