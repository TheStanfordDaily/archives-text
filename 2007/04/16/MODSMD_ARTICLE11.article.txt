## A
						review of the Stanford Soundtrack 'Chronology' 
### SCOTT COOMES KZSU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Iliis Saturday, the sixth volume of the Stanford
Soundtrack was released at An Art Affair by the Student
Organizing Committee for the Arts (SOC'A). Titled
"Chronology." this year's edition of the soundtrack fea
tures tracks b\ twenty Stanford artists performing a wide
variety of contemporary popular music, from indie-pop
to hip hop to folk. The compilation mostly features differ
ent groups from last year's edition, although a few artists
return.
The Stanford Soundtrack is framed by its two most dy
namic and exciting tracks. The compilation begins with
Sabrina Duim. the recently deceased member of Volun
teer Pioneer, playing the harp in the introduction to
"I ear of Cholera", one the compilation's strongest songs.
The sing-speak vocals inject the compilation with a dis
orienting but fun energy and that carries well into the
succeeding tracks. At the opposite end of the spectrum.
Isaac Wang's piano instrumental, "Erina's Song." serves
as a fitting and sober final statement for the soundtrack.

Several other tracks stand out between these two poles;
Beatbeat Whisper, whose self-titled debut has received
considerable airplay at kXSU. provide with the humble
folk track "Lulu." Tremolo guitar wanders in and out of
the sing-song narrative and fingerpicking, granting an
ethereal feel that departs from the clean and upbeat drive
of most of the compilation. "Elephant+Rhinoceros," by
the Reiterators grants a similar moment of repose. The
track functions through a more minimal twee sensibility,
which drives the piece with its simple ukulele strums and
handclap percussion.
The first half of the Stanford Soundtrack maintains
a fairly regular indie-pop sound, dominated by a dra
matic and straightforward, yet carefree, tone. The com
pilation has a definite and distinct feel throughout, and
perhaps it would not be presumptuous to say that the
Stanford Soundtrack as some sort of voice of student
culture. But, just as students who have spent too much
time within the Bubble can attest, consistency can
eventually shift to saturation, and the compilation like
wise starts to grow bland after a time. While the musi
cality of the pieces maintains a high level of competen
cy, its uniformity proves a challenge for the attention
span.
Fortunately, the shift to tracks outside of this domi
nant genre in the second half keeps the progression inter
esting, with some hip hop. folk, and classical songs nestled
into the mix at opportune moments.The cool electronic
interlude "Something to I lold You Over" by A Squirrel
serves this function well as a transition from a series of
soul and hip hop songs back into a final reprise of the
original indie pop tone. Campus favorite K Flay makes an
appearance with the I loover bassdriven "Just Say No,"
rapping about avoiding mind-altering substances. With
these moments of deviance from the pop tone, the com
pilation actually garners a unity of sound by setting out
on a path that eventually loops back to a variation of the
original musical statement.
The Stanford Soundtrack presents a satisfying survey
of the Stanford popular music scene and showcases an
engaging mix of campus voices and music making ap
proaches. Listen not just for your friend's band, but as an
introduction to some of the talented artists on campus,or
even to get inspired to make some music of your own
with your roommate.
