# Hidden Stanford Eateries
## No need to 'book' a table at this tasty cafe 
### KAT LEWIN IN INTERMISSION LITERARY LUNCHER 
Everyone knows the Stanford
Bookstore as the place where you
drop exorbitant amounts of money
on overpriced textbooks at the start
of the year, but few students realize it
also contains one of the best eateries
on campus. Where else can you eat a
three-course meal (soup, entree and
dessert) for less than $10?
The Stanford Bookstore Cafe
(open during normal Bookstore
hours) offers a variety of tasty break
fast and lunchtime foods in a pleas
ant atmosphere. Available all day are
bagels, croissants and breakfast pas
tries like danishes and muffins, as
well as an assortment of hot bever
ages made with Peerless brand cof
fee beans, not the unpalatable dish
watery Peet'sthat dominates the rest
of campus.
However, lunchtime is when the
Bookstore Cafe really comes to life.
Among the savory lunch options are
a variety of pre-made burritos, cal
zones and sandwiches that are hand
prepared every day. The cafe also
sells cups of Campbells soup for
$().W if you show your student II) —
one of the most under-rated deals on
campus, and a culinary staple for un
seasonably cold spring days.
After much deliberation, my
friend and I settled on a brown rice
burrito and a spinach and feta cheese
calzone. The food was served hot
after a modest five-minute wait, and
we dug in with relish. Right away we
could tell that the entrees were pre
pared with high-quality ingredients:
The burrito was stuffed with flavor
ful brown rice, beans and juicy toma
toes — infinitely more appetizing
than similar fare from The Tree

house. The burrito also passed the
all-important "tortilla integrity" test
with flying colors: in spite of its gen
erous filling, my friend was able to
eat the entire thing by hand without
making a mess. Any burrito that
doesn't make you look like a
schmuck in public is five-star in my
book.
The spinach and feta cheese cal
zone was also a huge hit: it was
crammed to the outer limits with
warm, slightly spicy, very fresh
spinach, and while the feta was no
ticeable it did not overpower the
flavor of the vegetable. Although
the calzone was a little on the dry
side, a bowl of soup would have
fixed that.
Far and away, though, the stand
out lunch special at the cafe is their
soup and half a sandwich deal: a cup
of soup and half of a huge Parisian
baguette sandwich (ham or turkey
with butter and cheese on French
bread) for a mere $4.(X). A satisfying,
reasonably nutritious meal for the
price of a Starbucks latte. and sinnif
icantly less than a similarly filling
lunch from Olive's orTresidder.
After entrees, we turned our at
tentions to the cafe's enticing dessert
display. After examining mousse

cake, pecan streusel bars and a par
ticularly dreamy looking boysenber
ry cheesecake square, we finally set
tled on tiramisu and a square of Mac
aroon Madness.
The tiramisu was passable, but the
sponge-cake-to-gooey-goodness
ratio was disappointingly high. The
Macaroon Madness bar, however,
was nothing short of mind-blowing.
It was dense, chewy and moist, like
macaroon flirting with apple pie and
utterly seducing the senses.
Ali in all, the Stanford Bookstore
Cafe offers one of the most rewarding
lunchtime dining experiences on cam
pus. The only two downsides are that
the food is not made to order, so near
the end of the day selection diminish
es. making this a better venue for an
early lunch. Seating is also fairly limit
ed (due in part to the inordinate num
ber of TAs who seem to hold their of
fice hours in the cafe), so if you're eat
ing with a companion, make her stake
out a table while you wait in line.
But the cafe's convenient loca
tion. tasty food and competitive
prices make it the perfect place to
grab a quick bite between two class
es. meet up for a meal with a few
friends or just linger over pleasant
food and a good book.
