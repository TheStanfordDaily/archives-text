El Centro Chicano and the Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) kicked off Cesar
Chavez Commemoration 2007 yesterday with per
formances in Stern Dining by Ballet Folklorico and
Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford.
Ilie 14th annual commemoration — which will in
clude a speech by Rev. Jesse Jackson — is geared to
ward bringing attention to global issues like human
rights.
"The events for this year's commemoration are all
about a space for creating dialogue and to address sit
uations going on around us." said co-coordinator Ser
gio Rosas '09. "Student life is really busy and people
are always active, and because of that. 1 think it's im
portant to take the time to remember that there are is
sues that still exist out there."
Other notable events include a discussion on the
militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border by Chicano
Studies Lecturer Jose Palafox and a service learning
project that will bring students to a local farmworking
community to discuss labor issues with representa
tives from California Rural Legal Assistance
(CRLA).
Ilie committee hopes the eclectic events will at
tract a broader audience than in previous years.
"Since the beginning planning stages, the commit
tee and I decided we wanted to broaden the scope of
the events in order to reach out to more faculty and

students with different interests," said co-coordinator
Martha Alvarez'oB. in an email to The Daily. "For in
stance, we wanted not only to talk about the struggle
of farm workers, hut create discussions about more
contemporary social justice issues like the rights of in
digenous people and immigrants."
Rosas said this year's commemoration would em
phasize the immigrant debate.
"We are focusing more on labor and social issues,
the issues that Chavez fought for and his legacy for
fighting for farm workers rights." he said. "We hope
that its not just what he did for the Latino community
that is recognized, but all communities facing the
same issues as well."
In an Apr. 23 address in Kresge Auditorium. Jack
son will touch on the legacy Chavez left behind and a
number of current societal issues.
Rosas encouraged students to attend the event
both to honor Chavez and to learn about the impor
tance of social justice.
"It is about remembering and realizing that people
in the past such as Chavez have struggled to bridge the
inequality gap among the labor community." he said.
"It is important to remember that there are people
who spend their entire lives lighting for others. I lav
ing an opportunity to hear a speaker address things
like that is something we should all take advantage
of."
Alvarez emphasized the importance of the com
memoration as a means to spreading Chavez's mes
sage.
"Since not many students, including Latinos, know
much about Chavez," she said."! believe it is incredi
bly important to educate the greater Stanford com
munity about his legacv."
