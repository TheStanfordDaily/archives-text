## Task force tackles climate change 
### ROXNA IRANI 
Members of the Green Ribbon Task Force on Climate
Protection encouraged audience members at a presenta
tion in the Arrillaga Alumni Center yesterday to think
about climate change and to take concrete steps to re
duce greenhouse gas emissions.
The task force — brainchild of former Palo Alto
mayor Judy Kleinberg — was established to promote en
vironmentally sound practices in the community.
Panelist Karl Knapp stressed the need for a climate
action plan and advocated "educating community mem
bers and instilling within them a moral imperative to save
resources for future generations."
The task force also highlighted the necessity for busi
nesses, institutions and Palo Alto residents to encourage
"green technological innovation."
The speakers could not agree which level — local,
state, national or global — most deserved aggressive im
plementation of strategies to curb global warming.
Echoing the "think globally, act locally" mantra of
many environmentalists, panelist Walter Hays said that
initiative taken at a local level will "bubble up and result

in ramifications at a national level which will actually
make the most difference."
Another panelist. Chris Christofferson, said the an
swer depends on whether monetary benefit or moral im
pact is the lens used to define success.
Jeremy Carl argued that international cooperation is
the most important issue, announcing that: "A global at
tack is needed."
Kevan Christensen '10 said he was pleased to see com
munity support and interest in such a critical field.
"The issue of climate change" he said, "is a big chal
lenge but an important one to address."
Sanjee Singla, a coterminal student in management
science and engineering, said he was impressed by the
task force's mission.
"I now have more respect for Palo Alto and Stan
ford." he said."in their efforts to reduce global warming."
Weiying Yu '06 said the panel put the problem of cli
mate change in perspective.
"It made you realize," she said,"what you can do and
the impact you can make at a local level."
