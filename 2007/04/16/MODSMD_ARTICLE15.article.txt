## Law students fight corporate culture Group aims to improve work conditions, bill system 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Craig Holt SotÂ»all J.D. "07 and An
drew Canter J.D. '08 have joined
more than 100 law students in an
email onslaught targeting the inbox
es of hiring and recruiting divisions
at top law firms in an effort to inspire
change in inefficiencies in the bill
able hour system and to improve
lawyers' work environments.
Segall and Canter are members of
Law Students Building a Better
Legal Profession, a new nationwide
group dedicated to lawyers' rights.
"We are writing as a group of over
100 law students to propose a change
in the way we all experience our pro
fession." they wrote in an email."We

are working to ensure that practicing
law does not mean giving up a com
mitment to family, community and
dedicated service to clients."
The group is lighting for a trans
actional billing system and a reduc
tion in maximum hour expecta
tions for partnership, among other
goals.
According to the email, over
worked lawyers often have little time
or energy to fullfill their pro bono re
sponsibilities and be dedicated fami
ly members.
"[li s] bad for everyone: It means
that the leadership of the legal pro
fession tends to remain white, male
and upper class," Segall said. "It
means that it's very hard to be en
gaged with your family and commu
nity as a firm lawyer. It means that al
most no lawyers meet their pro bono
obligations."
Group members recognize the
price they would have to pay it the

changes they are proposing are im
plemented.
"We recognize that these changes
are not free," according to the
group's Web site. "We are willing to
accept reduced salaries in exchange
for better working lives."
Some skeptics, however, have ques
tioned the viability of the group's de
mands.
"( an these students really change
the profession, will Big Law sign on,
or is this all just pie in the sky?" Wall
Street Journal law blogger Peter
Lattman asked in a recent entry.
Canter and Segall remain opti
mistic in their goals.
"No transition is easy or immedi
ate." Segall said. "But we're confi
dent that this is workable."
