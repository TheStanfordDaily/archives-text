## Editorial Board Don't let SNRP end 
### 
When ASSU Elections Commission
er Bernard Fraga "OS announced to
students awaiting elections results
last Friday that the Stanford News Reader
ship Program (SNRP) was one of only two
groups that failed to garner special fees
funding, an audible collective gasp gripped
the Collo. And rightfully so. This failure on
the ballot represents a shocking and tragic
loss for the Stanford community. Perhaps
more so than any other group requesting
special fees, except I"he Daily, the SNRP
provides a crucial service to all Stanford stu
dents. SNRP provides 600 copies of the San
Jose Mercury News and 350 copies of the
New York Times to the student public every
day. free of charge.These papers are located
in dorms, hallways and major intersections
around campus for anyone to read.
SNRP educates the Stanford communi
ty. enlightens public discourse on campus
and helps ground student life with a daily in
flux of perspective on pressing local, state
and national issues. The mere presence of
these papers on campus promotes debate
among many students who would otherwise
not seek out news on their own accord.
Just last month, we extolled on this page
the virtues of the program and noted that if
bursting the Stanford bubble is a worthy
goal, we can think of few means better than
providing two outstanding newspapers at
the price of mere dollars per student per
year.
Interestingly, 53 percent of students vot
ers voted in favor of the SNRP. but the pro
gram tragically fell victim to a little-known
clause that requires that special fees groups
to garner "yes" votes from 15 percent of the
total student population regardless of
turnout. It appears that grad students, of
whom only one third supported the SNRP
as compared with two thirds of undergradu
ates. played a large role in the SNRP's nar
row rejection.

It is not immediately clear why the
SNRP failed to collect the votes necessary
for passage. Many students indicated that
they voted against the SNRP simply be
cause they could not identify the program
by name.The SNRP leadership's campaign
efforts consisted of including flyers publiciz
ing the SNRP's special fees request in the
three days preceding the election —a re
spectable, but hardly overwhelming, effort.
A more pressing long-term concern is
the apathy that some grad students seem to
feel toward the SNRP. This antagonism is
puzzling when one considers that SNRP dis
tribution sites are equitably apportioned
between areas frequented by graduates as
those frequented by undergraduates.
Nonetheless, those in charge of the SNRP
would do well to address graduate student
concerns with the program in anticipation
of re-applying for special fees next Spring.
In the interim, however, hope remains
for the SNRP's continuation during the
2007-8 academic year. We strongly urge
SNRP leaders to look for alternative
sources of funding for next year, including
but not limited to accepting discretionary
funds from the University administration.
Few programs are more deserving ot tund
ing. and surely the Administration can come
up with an extra $50,000 amid a year of
record-shattering fundraising to assist the
SNRP in this crucial period.
Another option would be for the new
ASSU Undergraduate Senate to pass an
emergency appropriation for money to
keep the program alive. Or for a donor to
step in and keep the program alive.
No matter how it happens, we hope that
program can find funds despite this setback,
and can regroup for a successful special fees
petition one year from now. The Stanford
community will suffer greatly if it loses free
access to world-class, "outside the bubble"
journalism.
