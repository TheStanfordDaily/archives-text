# Too cool for Parisian school
## 
### 
There's a posh, hip gay club on the
Champs-Elysees called ITie Queen.
We had all heard stories about its un
rivaled coolness from our host brothers and
sisters and decided to check it out for our
selves. After some research, we decided that
Thursday would be best because not only
was admission free, but it was also early ' l )()s
video night. Hot Eurotrashy gay men and
'90s hits in the middle of one of the most
beautiful streets in Paris for free — how
could we go wrong?
Of course, the operation required some
planning.To get in without cover one needed
a "free pass," which could be found some
where in Le Marais— Paris' oldest district,
known for its trendy gay nightlife and a
falafel restaurant "recommended by Leni
Kravitz." So much of the day was spent scour
ing the various laundromats and sex shops of
the district, looking for enough passes to
cover the entire group of nearly 20 people.
Once the passes were acquired and the
group gathered, we headed to the club, giddy
with anticipation. As we got off the metro, we
heard techno beats and saw multi-colored
strobe lights and a line of people dressed in
bright orange mini-skirts and neon green
boas stretching along the C harnps. We knew
we had hit the jackpot. So clutching our
handy free passes, we got in line ready to
dance the night away. We knew the club was
selective in who they let in.so we made an ef
fort to speak French and act as we thought
cool Parisian club-goers should.
Unfortunately, when we reached the
bouncer, he took one look at us and shook
his head. We began to protest, but he point
ed to the exit and shooed us out. We lingered
around the club entrance hoping he would
change his mind, but it was no use. Clearly,
we weren't cool enough for The Queen.
We weren't cool enough for the French.
No matter how hard we try to fit in. speak
French and follow all of the weird and
ridiculous rules of Parisian etiquette, the lo
cals always catch on to the fact that we're
not part of the "in" crowd who have lived in
Paris their entire lives and are utterly blase
about its trendy gay clubs.
In restaurants, we try our best to order in
French and sometimes even go out of our
way to speak French among ourselves, hop
ing to pass, if not for native Parisians, at least
for people who are somewhat competent in
French culture and language. Hut most of
the time, before we even have a chance to
open our mouths, the waiters address us in
English — usually with a condescending
and annoyed snarl.
A friend of mine tried to order Egyptian
coffee last week and immediately the waiter
laughed and. switching to English to make
sure we understood, told him. "No no. this is
real coffee. It's strong, not like the stuff you're
used to. You won't like it. get something else."
My friend explained, in French, that he was

well aware of the strength of the coffee and
had drank and enjoyed similar coffee before.
But the waiter continued to protest in Fng
lish. trying to convince my friend to at least
take some milk and sugar with his coffee.
Such absurd situations in which waiters at
tempt to save us from our naive misconcep
tions of French cuisine in broken Fnglish and
we assure them that we know what we're or
dering in broken French are sadly all too
common. No matter how hard we try, they re
fuse to treat us like one of them.
One would think they would appreciate
the amount of effort we put into trying to
communicate in French instead of sticking
to the comfort of Fnglish. But rather than
being relieved to see an American tourist
who doesn't assume that everyone has to
speak Fnglish. Parisians are annoyed by the
horrible way we butcher their language in
our hopeless effort to fit in. At best, they are
sometimes amused and mock us.
One of the highlights of my time here was
when a woman stopped me by the entrance
to the Louvre to ask for directions. Of
course, as soon as she realized that a) I
couldn't understand half of what she was
saying and b) I had no idea where anything
was located, she let out an exasperated sigh
and turned on her heel. But nevertheless, for
a brief moment, someone had mistaken me
for a Parisian. And oddly enough, it was
when I was doing a stereotypically touristy
thing rather than trying to pass for a local.
1 guess trying too hard may be part of our
problem. Fitting in among Parisians has to
come naturally. After our disappointment at
the entrance of The Queen, our large group
split up and three of us decided to head to a
nearby cafe to wash away our sorrows by
splurging on fancy cocktails such as "Play
girl" and "Sensual Feeling." After a few hours
at the cafe, filled with liquid courage, we de
cided to give The Queen another shot. But
this time we gave up any pretense of being
Ux'al and waltzed up to the bouncer flaunting
our non-Parisian-ness. Without giving it a sec
ond thought, he immediately let us in. Unfor
tunately, our free passes expired at 12:30 and.
since we didn't want to pay the 15 euro cover
fee,we left the club still never having seen the
inside. But this time, it was with our heads
held high, feeling entirely satisfied that we
were cool enough for Paris.
