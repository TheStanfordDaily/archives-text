It's Spring quarter, and that means it's
GAME time. baby. You know the deal —
nerdv CS major dorm staffers write up
fancy, obtuse riddles and puzzles, plant them
all across the Bay Area, and the rat race be
gins! Teams of four or five hop into cars, sit
around with their laptops, and put to use all
the cunning and guile they can muster in
what eventually comes down to an all-night,
all-out. no holds barred steel cage match of
Googling prowess! Whose search engine will
reign supreme? Who will be most proficient
at stealing WiFi from strangers on the street?
OK, so it's not that trivial. In fact, the
Game is one of my favorite activities of the
year. I was given the opportunity to play last
Friday with FroSoCo and some SLE kids. It
was an offer I could not refuse. What follows
is a highly accurate and unbiased account of
what transpired.
4:00 p.m. — The last-minute rush to gather
materials commences. WE NEED A
LIGHTER!! LAPTOP BATTERIES? EN
ERGY DRINKS? WHAT ABOUT A MAP
OMG OMG OMG WE'RE SCREWED.
Our team, obscurely named TEN!, is com
posed of John Le, Kelley l ong, Ellen Iruxaw
and Christian Torres looking a disheveled
mess as we vainly struggle to prepare, 'i
brought yummy snacks." Ellen assures us.
But where the hell can we get a shovel?
8:00 p.m. — Stanford Campus, over an hour
into Game play. After dealing with a rather
unsupportive Game Controller ("the first
clue is so simple: it shouldn't be taking you

twenty minutes"), we finally make it past the
first riddle and head to KZSU.
9:30 p.m. — IKEA in EPA. We cross paths
with a few SLE kids. Their looks of confi
dence also betray their inner dread — Team
TEN! is gaining speed. We rapidly solve the
next puzzle in a nearby McDonalds, and
teammate John Le obliges to order some
thing to prove we aren't dirty freeriders. He
asks for a free cup of water. He asks in Japan
ese.
12:04 a.m.— Dutch Windmill. Golden Gate
Park. SF. Amidst a crowd of drunken revelers
and roadside squatters (yes, they were fe
male). we solve yet another clue. We are in a
serious groove. Oh. and 1 start to bleed. I
apologize. Christian, for bleeding all over
your car seat.
3:21 a.m. — The Palace of Fine Arts. Can 1
just say WOW/.A? ITiis place is out of this
world. Did we just get transported to Ancient
Greece? We frolic amongst the gigantic stone
edifices of the palace and I pretend I'm
Leonidas fighting the Persians.Then I pee by
a nearbv tree.

5:00 a.m. — AT&T Park.The bag of clues has
mysteriously disappeared. This is our first
major crisis. Game Control tells us to get on
the internet to download the clue electroni
cally. It's a Saturday, so nothing around is
open. We find ourselves sitting in the driz
zling rain humming WiFi on the doorstep of a
closed Starbucks. How glamorous. An hour
later, we're blasting Disney songs from our
sole functional laptop inside a McDonalds as
day begins to break.
7:(i(> a.m. — Colma: Utterly absurd looking
Cemetery/Columbarium decorated like a
Mini-golf course. John is getting drowsy.
Ellen is bouncing with energy — she's hit her
second wind, kelley has been on fire all night.
Christian is holding up alright. 1 think 1 dozed
off. I'm not doimi so hot. MUST. HAVE.
BAWLS. ENERGY. DRINK.
10:00 or so a.m. — Winchester House. San
Jose. The situation is grim. I'm not the spry
young eighteen-year-old 1 used to be. All
nighters were never my strong suit, though.
We've been in this godforsaken parking lot
for nearly two hours now. John looks seasick.
Kelley is showing signs of possibly maybe al
most cracking. I 'm going a bit gaga upstairs. Is
it true that staying awake for 24 hours is
equivalent to having a nontrivially high
BAG?
11:00 am — Palo Alto Jr. Museum. I have
slept like a baby on the ride over. It was the
soundest I've slept since spring break. I take



Alex
Coley
In Pursuit of the Epic
a surreal jaunt through a sea of
kindergarteners, drawing stares
from concerned parents. College
students clearly not welcome here.
11:21 am — Ricker Dining. Stan
lord University. We arrive at long
last, safe and intact. We are the third
team to arrive. Only ten minutes
separate us from first place. I'm flab
bergasted. Ten minutes. Ten lousy
minutes. Bickering about penalties
and time bonuses ensues. One team
mate, in a defeated voice, speaks the
frustrating truth: "Remember: only
38 votes, guys. Only 38 votes..."
Whether ten lousy minutes or 38
lousy votes, the closer you come to vic
tory, the harder it is to stomach a loss.
Still. I'm glad to be home.
