Brett and Lakshmi win undergrad vote but lose record turnout nail biter

In one of the closest elections in memory
and with the highest voter turnout in ASSU his
tory, I lershey Avula '08 and Mondaire Jones '(W
were chosen as the new ASSU executives over
their top rivals Brett Hammon '08 and 1 .akshmi
karra '08 by a margin of a mere 38 votes.
Jones. Avula's vice presidential candidate,
could hardly contain himself when Elections
Commissioner Bernard Fraga '08 announced
the results to the approximately 200 people
packed in the CoHo Friday afternoon.
In the screaming-and-yelling commotion,
Avula was nearly knocked to the ground.
"I went up to give |Jones] a hug and he
jumped up and shouldered me in the face,"
Avula joked just after the results were an
nounced, gripping his jaw in pain hut trying to
crack a smile. "1 think it may be broken, but
we're very happy."
Hammon left shortly after the votes were
announced hut expressed his disappointment
to The Daily over the phone, blaming graduate
students for pushing the Avula/Jones vote
above that of his slate. 1 lammon and Karra re
ceived 69 more undergraduate first choice
votes than did Avula and Jones, but their slate
got 221 fewer first round graduate votes.
The ASSU used choice voting, which ;»l!ows
voters to rank candidates from first to last.
Each round, the slate which received the
fewest votes was eliminated and each vote cast
for the losing candidate was given to the vot
ers' next-ranked choice.
For example, in the first round, the Warm
Weather Party garnered 440 votes. After the
Chappie slate, Submit, was removed in the first
round and the Smith and Ladewig ticket was
thrown out in the second round, the slate's
vote total grew to 517, or M percent.
The race came down to Avula/Jones and

braces running mate and president-elect Hershey Avula '08, left, after their victo
ry was announced in the CoHo Friday.
Brett and Lakshmi. Avula and Jones
got 2,030 votes, and Mammon and
Karra received 1,992.
"We ran a very good campaign."
Mammon said. "I'm very proud of
what Lakshmi and 1 have done. 1
think we made a big statement at
least about what kind of new atti
tudes to bring to the ASSU."
"I'm very proud of our team in
terms of people that don't usually get
involved in ASSU stuff." he added.
"They came out in full force because
they shared Lakshmi and my pas
sion. Our team may not have been as
serious but they were definitely fun
ner [sic]."
Avula and Jones acknowledged
that they were anxious before the
announcement.
"We weren't sure [who was going
to win]," Jones said. "It seemed like
the odds were against us."
The slate told The Daily it feared
that the student body would not un
derstand its message.
"We knew we were the best can
didates," Jones said, "but it was not
knowing whether the students
thought that."
Avula and Jones were enthusias
tic about the high voter turnout.
"Thank you for coming out in
such high numbers," Avula said.
"Thank you. graduate students, for
making your voice heard.This year's
executive will take a large role in
graduate advocacy."
Fraga was also pleased with the
record number of ballots cast. The
Graduate Student Council voter
turnout was also up 10 percent over
last year.
"In the past, numbers have been
below 10 percent grad turnout,"

Fraga said,"so this is amazing.
Junior and senior turnout was
substantially higher than last year's,
perhaps because of strong discon
tent with the leadership in the Office
of Student Activities. Sophomore
turnout was slightly lower than last
year's, likely due to the tact that the
winning slate for junior class presi
dents was unopposed.
" Turnout was extremely high,
higher than in national elections,"
Fraga said. "It's very clear voters
were mobilized by the candidates
and the issues. Even though the
votes were very close, 1 think the
high turnout speaks for itself."
Before the results were an
nounced. Mammon was jovial about
the campaigning process.
"There were some glitches along
the way," he wrote in an email to TTie
Daily earlier this week. "1 sent out a
couple emails last week that said
'Come by my room in Burbank if you
want one of my lies or tropical gum!'
ITiough I would be happy to spew lies,
people were pleasantly surprised when
1 gave them leis instead at my room."
Karra said she thinks her team did
the best it could.
"It was incredibly close and 1
don't think that Brett and 1 could
have done anything better." she said.
"I think we put our best feet forward.
It's sad we didn't win. It's unfortu
nate that it was so close because it
makes it harder."
Both Jones and Avula expressed
relief that the race was over. The
campaign was so exhausting, Jones
said, that he fell asleep while tlyering
graduate dorms at one point.
What are they going to do now?
"Sleep."

"Thank you for coming out in
such high numbers," Avula said.
"Thank you. graduate students, for
making your voice heard.This year's
executive will take a large role in
graduate advocacy."
Fraga was also pleased with the
record number of ballots cast. The
Graduate Student Council voter
turnout was also up 10 percent over
last year.
"In the past, numbers have been
below 10 percent grad turnout,"

Fraga said,"so this is amazing.
Junior and senior turnout was
substantially higher than last year's,
perhaps because of strong discon
tent with the leadership in the Office
of Student Activities. Sophomore
turnout was slightly lower than last
year's, likely due to the tact that the
winning slate for junior class presi
dents was unopposed.
" Turnout was extremely high,
higher than in national elections,"
Fraga said. "It's very clear voters
were mobilized by the candidates
and the issues. Even though the
votes were very close, 1 think the
high turnout speaks for itself."
Before the results were an
nounced. Mammon was jovial about
the campaigning process.
"There were some glitches along
the way," he wrote in an email to TTie
Daily earlier this week. "1 sent out a
couple emails last week that said
'Come by my room in Burbank if you
want one of my lies or tropical gum!'
ITiough I would be happy to spew lies,
people were pleasantly surprised when
1 gave them leis instead at my room."
Karra said she thinks her team did
the best it could.
"It was incredibly close and 1
don't think that Brett and 1 could
have done anything better." she said.
"I think we put our best feet forward.
It's sad we didn't win. It's unfortu
nate that it was so close because it
makes it harder."
Both Jones and Avula expressed
relief that the race was over. The
campaign was so exhausting, Jones
said, that he fell asleep while tlyering
graduate dorms at one point.
What are they going to do now?
"Sleep."
