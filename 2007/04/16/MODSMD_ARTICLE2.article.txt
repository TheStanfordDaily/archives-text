Brett and Lakshmi win undergrad vote but lose record turnout nail biter

In one of the closest elections in memory
and with the highest voter turnout in ASSU his
tory, I lershey Avula '08 and Mondaire Jones '(W
were chosen as the new ASSU executives over
their top rivals Brett Hammon '08 and 1 .akshmi
karra '08 by a margin of a mere 38 votes.
Jones. Avula's vice presidential candidate,
could hardly contain himself when Elections
Commissioner Bernard Fraga '08 announced
the results to the approximately 200 people
packed in the CoHo Friday afternoon.
In the screaming-and-yelling commotion,
Avula was nearly knocked to the ground.
"I went up to give |Jones] a hug and he
jumped up and shouldered me in the face,"
Avula joked just after the results were an
nounced, gripping his jaw in pain hut trying to
crack a smile. "1 think it may be broken, but
we're very happy."
Hammon left shortly after the votes were
announced hut expressed his disappointment
to The Daily over the phone, blaming graduate
students for pushing the Avula/Jones vote
above that of his slate. 1 lammon and Karra re
ceived 69 more undergraduate first choice
votes than did Avula and Jones, but their slate
got 221 fewer first round graduate votes.

Each round, the slate which received the
fewest votes was eliminated and each vote cast
for the losing candidate was given to the vot
ers' next-ranked choice.
For example, in the first round, the Warm
Weather Party garnered 440 votes. After the
Chappie slate, Submit, was removed in the first
round and the Smith and Ladewig ticket was
thrown out in the second round, the slate's
vote total grew to 517, or M percent.
The race came down to Avula/Jones and
