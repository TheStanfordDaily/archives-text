## Rush and the Fundamental Standard 
### DAN BENTLEY 
'ITiis article is about rush (full disclosure: I
rushed, pledged and joined Phi Kappa Psi in
the spring of 2001 ),so if you're not interested
in fraternities or sororities, you should keep
reading anyway. Because it's also about Stan
ford, what respect means, and how the Fun
damental Standard should change to recog
nize that. For background, the Fundamental
Standard only applies to students; in its cur
rent form. "Students at Stanford are expect
ed to show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens. Failure to do this
will be sufficient cause for removal from the
University." The problem with this is that to
show respect, you have to be shown respect.
Ihough I live far away in New York.conver
sations with my still-student friends make me
believe that the respect and trust between stu
dents and administration is on thinner ice than
it has been since I came to The Farm.Take Dar

ren Franich's recent poorly-framed but materi
ally substantive column. Vice Provost Greg
Boardman's public response to the column
took strong issue with its tone (as well he
should have). but did not address its salient crit
icisms (as well he should have).The very writ
ing of the column, the response by Boardman.
and the KO posts on the Daily's website about
the two reveal the deep-seeded nature of this
conflict.Too many students feel that the Funda
mental Standard is now a one-way road man
dating that they follow unreasonable policies
instead of seeing it as the community-fostering
statement it should be.
So it's in this context that 1 read, with dis
may and shock, the specifics of this year's dry
rush.
Don't get me wrong: I 'm a huge fan of dry
rush. Rush, like any time involving applying
and acceptance, is a delicate time. Hazing,
which is abuse of this relationship, happens
all too often, even inadvertently, and is more
likely to happen if alcohol is present. And so.

we should have dry rush.
Hint's all that has to be said. "Stanford has
a dry rush." Oh, and maybe a reiteration of
the Fundamental Standard. Instead, my
inbox contains paragraphs of regulations as
detailed as "That means no alcohol from 8:00
I'M to 11:00 PM for the entire two weeks. It
OS A monitors come at 10:45 PM and see
brothers drinking, even if there aren't
rushees in the house and even if we aren't
having an event, we can be fined."
I"his isn t showing respect to students. It is
attempting to solve a genuine problem of
abuse of authority by the bureaucratic equiv
alent of nickel-and-diming. Because the
()SA cannot see someone being degraded in
the abstract, they instead watch out for beer
cans, and come away satisfied that they arc
doing what they can to protect students. Ad
mittedly. this focusing on one symptom of a
disease may prevent some underage imbib-
