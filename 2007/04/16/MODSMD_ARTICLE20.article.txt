## Rush and the Fundamental Standard 
### DAN BENTLEY 
'ITiis article is about rush (full disclosure: I
rushed, pledged and joined Phi Kappa Psi in
the spring of 2001 ),so if you're not interested
in fraternities or sororities, you should keep
reading anyway. Because it's also about Stan
ford, what respect means, and how the Fun
damental Standard should change to recog
nize that. For background, the Fundamental
Standard only applies to students; in its cur
rent form. "Students at Stanford are expect
ed to show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens. Failure to do this
will be sufficient cause for removal from the
University." The problem with this is that to
show respect, you have to be shown respect.
Ihough I live far away in New York.conver
sations with my still-student friends make me
believe that the respect and trust between stu
dents and administration is on thinner ice than
it has been since I came to The Farm.Take Dar

ren Franich's recent poorly-framed but materi
ally substantive column. Vice Provost Greg
Boardman's public response to the column
took strong issue with its tone (as well he
should have). but did not address its salient crit
icisms (as well he should have).The very writ
ing of the column, the response by Boardman.
and the KO posts on the Daily's website about
the two reveal the deep-seeded nature of this
conflict.Too many students feel that the Funda
mental Standard is now a one-way road man
dating that they follow unreasonable policies
instead of seeing it as the community-fostering
statement it should be.
So it's in this context that 1 read, with dis
may and shock, the specifics of this year's dry
rush.
Don't get me wrong: I 'm a huge fan of dry
rush. Rush, like any time involving applying
and acceptance, is a delicate time. Hazing,
which is abuse of this relationship, happens
all too often, even inadvertently, and is more
likely to happen if alcohol is present. And so.

we should have dry rush.
Hint's all that has to be said. "Stanford has
a dry rush." Oh, and maybe a reiteration of
the Fundamental Standard. Instead, my
inbox contains paragraphs of regulations as
detailed as "That means no alcohol from 8:00
I'M to 11:00 PM for the entire two weeks. It
OS A monitors come at 10:45 PM and see
brothers drinking, even if there aren't
rushees in the house and even if we aren't
having an event, we can be fined."
I"his isn t showing respect to students. It is
attempting to solve a genuine problem of
abuse of authority by the bureaucratic equiv
alent of nickel-and-diming. Because the
()SA cannot see someone being degraded in
the abstract, they instead watch out for beer
cans, and come away satisfied that they arc
doing what they can to protect students. Ad
mittedly. this focusing on one symptom of a
disease may prevent some underage imbib-
ing. But at what cost?
Unfortunately, this policy isn't
just dumb; it's dangerous because it
both forbids reasonable situations
and ignores harmful ones. Consider
the following three examples:
1. The clarification to rush policy,
"[any] contact between a prospec
tive new member and a fraternity
(day or night) where alcohol is pres
ent will be considered a violation of
this policy. E.g.. A couple of actives
are at the Tree House having a couple
of beers, a prospective new member
shows up to say hello.They must ask
the prospective new member to
leave, or they will be in violation of
the policy." This policy requires os
tracizing someone solely because of
their status as a rushee â€” precisely
the hazing we're supposed to avoid.
2. One regulation prohibits any con
tact between brothers and rushees
during specific time periods. What
happens when, as has often hap
pened in Phi Psi.a brother living out
side the house rushes his roommate?
Or a lab partner in a class that occurs
during these other sessions? Must

one roommate be "rushiled" (rush
exiled) from their common home?
Or must both of their grades suffer?
3. Hazing can occur with EANABs
or in other. non-Greek Student Or
ganizations. But Rush regulations do
not apply to these potentially harm
ful situations.
If you want to ban hazing, ban
hazing. If you want to ban substances
that contribute to hazing, ban sub
stances that contribute to hazing.
But not with the inflexible and in
complete abstention of the OS A. Do
it with the reasoned abstention im
plied by the Fundamental Standard.
The thing about finely worded regu
lations is that, because their preci
sion implies completeness, they are
more likely to be circumvented.
Having such emphasis on the letter
of the law actively discourages fol
lowing the spirit of it. If we want to
avoid these circumstances (and we
should).the solution is not to have an
administrator forbid every combina
tion they can think of, in a game of
forbidden-recruitment-practice
Clue ("Ram's Head Members in Ar
rillaga with a Jug of Wine"). Instead,
say the why ("Substances and pres
sure at recruitment events harm the
Stanford Community") and give
others the respect to reason out the
what (e.g., that this applies not only

to Greeks hut also to the Hand and
Shakes and the Review, etc.).
And so, I'd like to suggest two re
visions to the form and application
of the Fundamental Standard.
1 .The Fundamental Standard should
apply to all members of the Stanford
Community, not just students as it
currently does. Everyone, from
Pro Fro to professor, administrator
to alumnus, should he required to
show each other common respect.
2. Members of the Stanford Commu
nity musi not only respect regula
tions. but also be shown the respect
to behave like reasonable people.To
this end. detailed regulations should
be replaced with a statement of prin
ciple, a reiteration of the Fundamen
tal Standard and, possibly, a history
of relevant interpretations and ap
plications (as exam blue books have
for the I lonor Code).
The benefit of existing in a com
munity like Stanford, where every
one is capable of being a lawyer,
should be that we do not have to act
like lawyers. Let us move back to a
place where respect means both the
responsibility to behave as reason
able people and the right to expect
that our peers will. too.
