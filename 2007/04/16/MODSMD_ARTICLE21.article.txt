eyes set on a national championship, hut came up

218.45. finishing behind Oklahoma (220.20) and
the new national champion, Penn State (221.00).
MEN'S GYMNASTICS
4/12 NCAA Championships
3rd place 218.45
GAME NOTES. Penn State took the NCAA title with a 221.00
total; Oklahoma was the runner-up (220.20). This was the
Cardinal's second straight third-place finish. Junior David
Sender defended his NCAA title in the vault.
INDIVIDUAL TITLES:
ALEX SCHORSCH - STILL RINGS - 9.75
DAVID SENDER - VAULT - 9.30
Once again. Stanford competed very well
across the board, but mishaps on the pommel
horse and parallel bars plagued the Cardinal
squad, as it finished third for the second consecu
tive year.
"We obviously wanted to win the champi
onship." junior David Sender said."But when you
look at the big picture,we still ended up third,and
that is nothing to be ashamed of."
Despite the third-place overall finish, Stanford
clearly asserted its national dominance on the still
rings. For the second consecutive day.the Cardi
nal led all teams in the event, tallying a score of
38.650. Seniors Peter Derman and Alex Schorsch,
along with sophomore Bryant Madden and
Sender, all scored above a 9.5.
Another strong event for the team was the
floor exercise, where 1 ladden was the top scorer
with a 9.50. and sophomore Greg Ter-Zakhari
ants, junior Eli Alcaraz and senior Dylan Carney
all scored above a 9.3. The score was especially
impressive in that the Cardinal competed during
Penn State's final rotation. With a blue-and-white
clad crowd erupting at the end of every Nittany
Lion routine, often right in the middle of a Cardi
nal performance, Stanford's gymnasts stayed fo
cused.The Cardinal held the crowd off and man
aged to finish the rotation without many errors.
Still, the Cardinal was unable to parlay fantastic
individual efforts into a team victory.
"All the teams performed surprisingly well,"
Sender said. "So to do as well as we did, when all
the teams did a lot better than we expected, is no
bad feat."
More top performances for the Cardinal in
cluded four athletes who led the competition in
separate events: Sender had the high on the vault
with a 9.30, junior Chris Harper on the pommel
horse with a 9.30, Carney on the high bar with a
9.70, and Schorsch on the rings with an outstand
ing 9.80. Several other athletes also toppled their
previous season bests.
The Cardinal moved next to the individual
event finals on Saturday, where the team finished
its season strong. Two Stanford athletes were
crowned national champions and another three
gained All-American status. Sender, the defend
ing NCAA vault champion, defended his title
with a 9.30. although Pejman 1 brahimi of Ohio
State also scored a 9.30 to earn a share of the title.
"It feels good to win the vault again," Sender
said. "Having to share the title was a tad disap
pointing. but two years in a row is great."
Additionally. Schorsch ended his Stanford ca
reer on a high note. I le avenged a runner-up ef
fort from last year with an outright NCAA title
this year, winning the still rings with a score of
9.75."
Among other finishes. Harper took third on
the pommel horse (9.20), Derman placed sixth in
the rings (9.60) and Carney took seventh in the
high bar (9.05). Carney, the defend
ing champion in the event, stumbled
during his routine and was unfortu
nately denied his second title in a
row.

"It was a pretty good day," coach
Thom Glielmi said. "It was unfortu
nate that Dylan missed on the high
bar. 1 can't tell you the last time he
missed a high bar routine."
Stanford concludes the season
with much to be proud of: I lie Cardi
nal finished with five Ail-American
athletes and a strong showing at the
NCAA Championships for the sec
ond straight year. The team now wel

comes a few days off this week before
returning to training.
The Cardinal men will have to
wait another year to earn a national
championship, hut two straight third
place finishes should certainly be the
right kind of motivation to get them
there.
