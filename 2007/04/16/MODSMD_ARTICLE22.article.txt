# 'Cats take two, Card claws back in finale
## Inman, Davis dominate Arizona at Diamond to stave off sweep 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Cardinal baseball (15-17.1-8 Pacific-10 Conference)
finished its three-game weekend series against Arizona
(30-7, 8-1) with a rousing 6-3 victory on Sunday that
seemed to bring some life back to the Stanford dugout.
After a pair of losses to start off the weekend's compe
tition against the Wildcats,though, Stanford still finds it
self mired at the bottom of the league's cellar.
Stanford found itself behind early on for the third
game in a row against Arizona yesterday,as the Wildcats
scored early, notching three runs over the first four in
nings. But freshman starter Jeffrey Inman kept the dam
age manageable, putting in five solid innings of work.

GAME NOTES: Stanford fell in the series, but managed to deal
the Wildcats their first conference loss of the season in Sun
day's finale. The win also marked Stanford's first Fbc-10 vic
tory of the year as Cardinal right hander Erik Davis pitched
four strong innings in relief of Jeffrey Inman, who got the win
for Stanford. The Cardinal will slay in the Bay Area until May
5, as it is slated to travel to face Cal in Berkeley next weekend
after Tuesday's matchup against the Broncos.

Junior catcher Brian Juhl notched Stanford's only RBI in the first game against the Wildcats, blasting a solo home
run against the otherwise stellar Preston Guilmet on Friday. Juhl and the Cardinal will have to pick up their pace
quickly if they hope to stay alive in the Pac-10 after dropping eight of their first nine conference games.
home run screaming down the right
field line to tie the game at 2-2.
Next up, freshman Toby Gerhart
made his own luck, doubling to riuht
center, stealing third and scoring on a
wild pitch by Arizona starter Ryan
Perry. Junior right fielder Michael
Taylor then drove in sophomore left
fielder Joey August on a double after
August singled and stole second.
While the Cardinal would add
two runs to its total in the seventh,
Stanford junior right-hander Erik
Davis was busy making them unnec
essary Davis took over for Inman in
the sixth and allowed just one hit and
no runs the rest of the way for the
Cardinal.
"1 just went in there with the idea
that 1 was going to preserve that lead
no matter what 1 had to do." Davis
said. "We were going to win this
game when I came in, that's the way 1
thought of it."
For Davis, the difference in team
morale between the series finale and
the first two contests was immense.
"The pressure was getting to us a
little bit and everybody was feeling a
little bit down, but we cyme out a lit
tle bit differently," Davis said.
"Ratliff hit an absolute bomb, and
everybody was upbeat — everybody
was cheering. It's a lot easier to play
like that than it is when you're ex
pecting to lose."
The series opened with a brilliant
performance by Arizona ace Preston
Guilmet. who racked up a career
high 15 strikeouts against the Cardi
nal in his fourth consecutive nine
frame outing, his third complete
game over that span. Junior catcher
Brian Juhl accounted for Stanford's
only run of the evening, driving a solo
home run to right field.The Cardinal
pitching staff couldn't keep up with
Guilmet, as sophomore Jeremy Ble
ich went 6.2 innings and allowed six
runs in the loss, and the Wildcats won
8-1.
"[Guilmet] had some pretty good
pitches," Juhl said. "He threw strikes
when he needed to, and we didn't re
ally make adjustments as a team. We
knew that he was going to throw the
ball down, and we just kept swinging.
That happens sometimes, especially
when you get on a little bit of a rut
and start trying to press."
It was Saturday's second game of
the series, though, that was a true
back-breaker for the Cardinal as Ari
zona assured itself of the series victo
ry in a 15-1 rout. Brad Mills mirrored
Guilmet's performance and gave up
one run over nine innings of work.
No Cardinal hitter collected more
than one hit in the game, and four
starters went hitless on the day.

Stanford managed to stay in the
game through the first four innings
before the game unraveled in the top
of the fifth, when the Wildcats scored
11 runs to take a commanding lead.
ITie outburst was a new single-inning
high tor Arizona this season as the
Wildcats sent 15 men to the plate,
capped by a towering three-run
home run to left field by designated
hitter Brad Glenn.
"It was just a bad inning, we had a
few bad hops," Juhl said. "A few hits, a
few errors — that's just stuff that you
can't always control. So we just kind
of decided to throw that away, come
out here and we get a fresh start."
Defense played a critical role in
another loss for the Cardinal, as it
committed five errors on Saturday
with two coming in that devastating
tilth inning. Fielding errors had been
singled out by coach Mark Marquess
as being a major factor in Stanford's
struggles against UCLA and the Sun
Devils.
"A lot of it's mental; they can do it
in practice," Marquess said. "They've
got a little bit of anxiety and every
thing's been a struggle lately, so they
just need to relax and play a little
bit."
"It's much tougher to play defense
this time of year because the fields
are harder," he continued. "We just
haven't been playing good baseball in
about a month, and it's just kind of
steamrolled on us in a negative way,
so it was good to get this win."
The Cardinal returns to action
this Tuesday in a 6 p.m. non-confer
ence game against Santa Clara (18-
19, 5-4 West Coast Conference) at
Sunken Diamond.

few errors — that's just stuff that you
can't always control. So we just kind
of decided to throw that away, come
out here and we get a fresh start."
Defense played a critical role in
another loss for the Cardinal, as it
committed five errors on Saturday
with two coming in that devastating
tilth inning. Fielding errors had been
singled out by coach Mark Marquess
as being a major factor in Stanford's
struggles against UCLA and the Sun
Devils.
"A lot of it's mental; they can do it
in practice," Marquess said. "They've
got a little bit of anxiety and every
thing's been a struggle lately, so they
just need to relax and play a little
bit."
"It's much tougher to play defense
this time of year because the fields
are harder," he continued. "We just
haven't been playing good baseball in
about a month, and it's just kind of
steamrolled on us in a negative way,
so it was good to get this win."
The Cardinal returns to action
this Tuesday in a 6 p.m. non-confer
ence game against Santa Clara (18-
19, 5-4 West Coast Conference) at
Sunken Diamond.

Cardinal baseball (15-17.1-8 Pacific-10 Conference)
finished its three-game weekend series against Arizona
(30-7, 8-1) with a rousing 6-3 victory on Sunday that
seemed to bring some life back to the Stanford dugout.
After a pair of losses to start off the weekend's compe

self mired at the bottom of the league's cellar.
Stanford found itself behind early on for the third
game in a row against Arizona yesterday,as the Wildcats
scored early, notching three runs over the first four in
nings. But freshman starter Jeffrey Inman kept the dam

GAME NOTES: Stanford fell in the series, but managed to deal
the Wildcats their first conference loss of the season in Sun
day's finale. The win also marked Stanford's first Fbc-10 vic
tory of the year as Cardinal right hander Erik Davis pitched
four strong innings in relief of Jeffrey Inman, who got the win
for Stanford. The Cardinal will slay in the Bay Area until May
5, as it is slated to travel to face Cal in Berkeley next weekend
after Tuesday's matchup against the Broncos.

Junior catcher Brian Juhl notched Stanford's only RBI in the first game against the Wildcats, blasting a solo home
run against the otherwise stellar Preston Guilmet on Friday. Juhl and the Cardinal will have to pick up their pace
quickly if they hope to stay alive in the Pac-10 after dropping eight of their first nine conference games.
home run screaming down the right
field line to tie the game at 2-2.
Next up, freshman Toby Gerhart
made his own luck, doubling to riuht
center, stealing third and scoring on a
wild pitch by Arizona starter Ryan
Perry. Junior right fielder Michael
Taylor then drove in sophomore left
fielder Joey August on a double after
August singled and stole second.
While the Cardinal would add
two runs to its total in the seventh,
Stanford junior right-hander Erik
Davis was busy making them unnec
essary Davis took over for Inman in
the sixth and allowed just one hit and
no runs the rest of the way for the
Cardinal.
"1 just went in there with the idea
that 1 was going to preserve that lead
no matter what 1 had to do." Davis
said. "We were going to win this
game when I came in, that's the way 1
thought of it."
For Davis, the difference in team
morale between the series finale and
the first two contests was immense.
"The pressure was getting to us a
little bit and everybody was feeling a
little bit down, but we cyme out a lit
tle bit differently," Davis said.
"Ratliff hit an absolute bomb, and
everybody was upbeat — everybody
was cheering. It's a lot easier to play
like that than it is when you're ex
pecting to lose."
The series opened with a brilliant
performance by Arizona ace Preston
Guilmet. who racked up a career
high 15 strikeouts against the Cardi
nal in his fourth consecutive nine
frame outing, his third complete
game over that span. Junior catcher
Brian Juhl accounted for Stanford's
only run of the evening, driving a solo
home run to right field.The Cardinal
pitching staff couldn't keep up with
Guilmet, as sophomore Jeremy Ble
ich went 6.2 innings and allowed six
runs in the loss, and the Wildcats won
8-1.
"[Guilmet] had some pretty good
pitches," Juhl said. "He threw strikes
when he needed to, and we didn't re
ally make adjustments as a team. We
knew that he was going to throw the
ball down, and we just kept swinging.
That happens sometimes, especially
when you get on a little bit of a rut
and start trying to press."
It was Saturday's second game of
the series, though, that was a true
back-breaker for the Cardinal as Ari
zona assured itself of the series victo
ry in a 15-1 rout. Brad Mills mirrored
Guilmet's performance and gave up
one run over nine innings of work.
No Cardinal hitter collected more
than one hit in the game, and four
starters went hitless on the day.

Stanford managed to stay in the
game through the first four innings
before the game unraveled in the top
of the fifth, when the Wildcats scored
11 runs to take a commanding lead.
ITie outburst was a new single-inning
high tor Arizona this season as the
Wildcats sent 15 men to the plate,
capped by a towering three-run
home run to left field by designated
hitter Brad Glenn.
"It was just a bad inning, we had a
few bad hops," Juhl said. "A few hits, a
few errors — that's just stuff that you
can't always control. So we just kind
of decided to throw that away, come
out here and we get a fresh start."
Defense played a critical role in
another loss for the Cardinal, as it
committed five errors on Saturday
with two coming in that devastating
tilth inning. Fielding errors had been
singled out by coach Mark Marquess
as being a major factor in Stanford's
struggles against UCLA and the Sun
Devils.
"A lot of it's mental; they can do it
in practice," Marquess said. "They've
got a little bit of anxiety and every
thing's been a struggle lately, so they
just need to relax and play a little
bit."
"It's much tougher to play defense
this time of year because the fields
are harder," he continued. "We just
haven't been playing good baseball in
about a month, and it's just kind of
steamrolled on us in a negative way,
so it was good to get this win."
The Cardinal returns to action
this Tuesday in a 6 p.m. non-confer
ence game against Santa Clara (18-
19, 5-4 West Coast Conference) at
