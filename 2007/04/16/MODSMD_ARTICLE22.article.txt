### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Cardinal baseball (15-17.1-8 Pacific-10 Conference)
finished its three-game weekend series against Arizona
(30-7, 8-1) with a rousing 6-3 victory on Sunday that
seemed to bring some life back to the Stanford dugout.
After a pair of losses to start off the weekend's compe

self mired at the bottom of the league's cellar.
Stanford found itself behind early on for the third
game in a row against Arizona yesterday,as the Wildcats
scored early, notching three runs over the first four in

GAME NOTES: Stanford fell in the series, but managed to deal
the Wildcats their first conference loss of the season in Sun
day's finale. The win also marked Stanford's first Fbc-10 vic
tory of the year as Cardinal right hander Erik Davis pitched
four strong innings in relief of Jeffrey Inman, who got the win
for Stanford. The Cardinal will slay in the Bay Area until May
5, as it is slated to travel to face Cal in Berkeley next weekend
after Tuesday's matchup against the Broncos.

Junior catcher Brian Juhl notched Stanford's only RBI in the first game against the Wildcats, blasting a solo home
run against the otherwise stellar Preston Guilmet on Friday. Juhl and the Cardinal will have to pick up their pace
quickly if they hope to stay alive in the Pac-10 after dropping eight of their first nine conference games.
