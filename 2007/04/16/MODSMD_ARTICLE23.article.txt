### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two days of nail-biting play, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's golf team captured its sixth team victory
at the U.S. Intercollegiate tournament on the Stan
ford golf course. Junior Rob Grube also notched his

second individual win at this weekend's tournament
with a score of 202 (eight under par).
Hie Cardinal seized and held the lead during the
first two rounds of play on Saturday in light rain and
wind, coming into the last round with an overall
score of 556 (four under par). In sunny conditions,
with a slight wind. No. 30 Minnesota had tied Stan
ford for first place with a score of 838 (two under
par) yesterday. There was tension on the 18th hole
when Minnesota led by one stroke. Hut Grube
birdied on a par 4 and Minnesota's Bronson La-
Cassie bogeyed to put both teams in a tie for the top
spot.
After calculating the tie breaker — the three-day
stroke totals, with the throw-out score for each day

also added in — Stanford had shot a 219 against
Minnesota's 223, giving the Cardinal the tourna
ment title. Rounding out the top five for the tourna
ment was Oregon State in third (860). UC-Irvine in
fourth (862) and Washington in fifth (866).
"We had a very successful weekend," Stanford
head coach Conrad Ray said. "The weather cooper
ated. and the golf course was in perfect shape. The
competition was impressed with Stanford and the
surrounding campus. It has been a long time since
we have won this tournament; last time we won was
in 1995. We had a goal to win it and it felt good to pull
it off."
