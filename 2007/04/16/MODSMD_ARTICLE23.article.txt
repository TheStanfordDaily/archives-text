Hie Cardinal seized and held the lead during the
first two rounds of play on Saturday in light rain and
wind, coming into the last round with an overall
score of 556 (four under par). In sunny conditions,
with a slight wind. No. 30 Minnesota had tied Stan
ford for first place with a score of 838 (two under
par) yesterday. There was tension on the 18th hole
when Minnesota led by one stroke. Hut Grube
birdied on a par 4 and Minnesota's Bronson La-
Cassie bogeyed to put both teams in a tie for the top
spot.
After calculating the tie breaker — the three-day
stroke totals, with the throw-out score for each day

also added in — Stanford had shot a 219 against
Minnesota's 223, giving the Cardinal the tourna
ment title. Rounding out the top five for the tourna
ment was Oregon State in third (860). UC-Irvine in
fourth (862) and Washington in fifth (866).
"We had a very successful weekend," Stanford
head coach Conrad Ray said. "The weather cooper
ated. and the golf course was in perfect shape. The
competition was impressed with Stanford and the
surrounding campus. It has been a long time since
we have won this tournament; last time we won was
in 1995. We had a goal to win it and it felt good to pull
it off."
Leading the ( ardmal to its victory was
Cirube. who putted his way to 40 even-par
holes. 10 birdies and an eagle in the tourna
ment, earning him the individual win. On day
one. Grube had an almost unheard of first
round score of 65 (live under par). Only two

performance, scoring 69 (one under par) in
order to enter the third round three strokes
ahead of the second-place golfer. Adding to
his great performance.Grube fired a 68 (two
under par) in the third round, making his
i>verall score 202 (eight under par) to earn in
dividual top honors.
"[Grube] plays Stanford well." Ray said.
He shot a great score of 65 right at the be
ginning m order to set himself up for a great
week Rob is hard to beat because he doesn't
make ;i lot of mistakes. I le played solidly all
tournament and made some good decisions.
"Rob really came through for us when we
needed him." he continued. "This is his sec
ond individual win this season and he is real-
Iv gaining some form at the right time here at
the end of the season."
Just behind (irube was sophomore Daniel
Lim who competed individually and led the
team shooting 42 even-par holes to finish in a

After two days of nail-biting play, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's golf team captured its sixth team victory
at the U.S. Intercollegiate tournament on the Stan
ford golf course. Junior Rob Grube also notched his

second individual win at this weekend's tournament

score of 556 (four under par). In sunny conditions,
with a slight wind. No. 30 Minnesota had tied Stan
ford for first place with a score of 838 (two under
par) yesterday. There was tension on the 18th hole
when Minnesota led by one stroke. Hut Grube
birdied on a par 4 and Minnesota's Bronson La-
Cassie bogeyed to put both teams in a tie for the top
spot.

stroke totals, with the throw-out score for each day

also added in — Stanford had shot a 219 against
Minnesota's 223, giving the Cardinal the tourna
ment title. Rounding out the top five for the tourna
ment was Oregon State in third (860). UC-Irvine in
fourth (862) and Washington in fifth (866).
"We had a very successful weekend," Stanford
head coach Conrad Ray said. "The weather cooper
ated. and the golf course was in perfect shape. The
competition was impressed with Stanford and the
surrounding campus. It has been a long time since
we have won this tournament; last time we won was
in 1995. We had a goal to win it and it felt good to pull
it off."

Cirube. who putted his way to 40 even-par
holes. 10 birdies and an eagle in the tourna
ment, earning him the individual win. On day

round score of 65 (live under par). Only two

performance, scoring 69 (one under par) in
order to enter the third round three strokes
ahead of the second-place golfer. Adding to
his great performance.Grube fired a 68 (two
under par) in the third round, making his
i>verall score 202 (eight under par) to earn in
dividual top honors.
"[Grube] plays Stanford well." Ray said.
He shot a great score of 65 right at the be
ginning m order to set himself up for a great
week Rob is hard to beat because he doesn't
make ;i lot of mistakes. I le played solidly all
tournament and made some good decisions.
"Rob really came through for us when we
needed him." he continued. "This is his sec
ond individual win this season and he is real-
Iv gaining some form at the right time here at
the end of the season."

Lim who competed individually and led the
team shooting 42 even-par holes to finish in a
