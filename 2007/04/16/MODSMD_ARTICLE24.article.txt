# Polo tops Bruins in dramatic OT
## No. 1 women down archrivals on Silver's game-winner 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's water polo team seems to have devel
oped quite a penchant for dramatic overtime victories.
On Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal needed a little more time
than usual to take care of business against visiting UCLA. After
regulation time expired with the score tied at six apiece, Stanford
sophomore Lolo Silver produced the deciding goal with 1:33 re
maining in overtime to seal the 7-6 decision. But senior two-meter
Christina 1 lewko was the true offensive hero of the match for
Stanford, rallying the Cardinal attack with three goals on the day.
Following their inspired effort against the Bruins, the Stanford
women knocked off UC-Santa Barbara, 12-5. yesterday to cap a
perfect weekend at home.

up 1-0 on its first possession of the game. After the two teams
traded goals. I lewko scored her second goal of the period, assist
ed by freshman driver Kelly Eaton, to put the Cardinal back up
by two.
Hewko wouldn't factor into the scoring again until the final
period of regulation, but there were plenty of dramatics in the in
terim. In the second period, senior goalkeeper Meridith McColl
set the tone by stonewalling shot after shot from the relentless
Bruins offense. At one point she took a ball right off the forehead
from point-blank range, but quickly shook it off and proceeded to
knock down three consecutive shots on UCLA's next possession
to preserve Stanford's lead. Both teams scored once in the second
and third periods, and Stanford headed into the final period of
regulation up 5-3.
But the Cardinal couldn't make its two-goal lead stand up. as
the Bruins proved in stunning fashion the truth of the old adage
"It ain't over'til it's over." Junior forward Brittany Rowe brought
UCLA back even with a pair of impressive goals within a span of
one minute early in the period. Her first came on a backhand at
set, and her second came as a one-touch tip past a closing McColl
to tie the score at 5-5. Hewko responded with her third goal of the
day, but UCLA's Courtney Mathewson answered to send the
game into overtime.
"Those were two little breakdowns that we could have
stopped," Hewko said ot Rowe's two scores. "It was sort of simi
lar to what happened in our previous games against USC this
year, but the general consensus was that we could still pull it out.
and that we just needed to play good 'D' and execute our plays."
Rowe's pair ol goals to knot the score likely conjured up mem

in the Avery Aquatic Center. In the first, the Women of Troy
