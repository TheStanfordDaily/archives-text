# Arizona schools scorch softball in desert
## Cardinal falters against Pac-10 rivals 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe desert proved unfriendly for No. 12
Stanford softball, which was swept by
the Wildcats and Sun Devils in a three
game Arizona road trip. A 4-1 loss to
the defending national champion. No. 4
Arizona, on Friday followed by two
blowout losses.7-0 and 8-2 respectively,
against Arizona State made for a trou
bling weekend for the Cardinal.
The three consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference losses dropped the Cardinal

record to 27-12 overall and 3-6 in
league play. This marks the sixth con
ference loss for Stanford in its last eight
Pac-10 contests. Last weekend. Stan
ford lost the regular season series to
archrival California in a heated three
game series. Coach John Rittman ac
knowledged the difficulty of playing in
the Pac-10.
"Playing on the road in this conference
isn't easy," Rittman said. "We're play
ing some very good teams and we have
to find a way to finish games."
Coming into this weekend. Stanford
starting pitcher Missy Penna appeared
ready to step up for her squad. Ihe
sophomore's second career no-hitter
came midweek against Saint Mary's,
giving the (Cardinal an 8-0 victory in six
innings. Penna also had eight strikeouts
on the night, includinu her 200 th of the

season.
However, against Arizona, Penna al
lowed four earned runs in six innings in
the circle and struck out only two Wild
cats. Sunday's game against the Sun
Devils was even more uncharacteristic
for Penna, who allowed eight earned
runs in her six innings of work. Al
though the weekend almost doubled
her loss total for the season, Rittman
showed unyielding support for his staff
ace.
"Penna can definitely bounce back."
Rittman said."l don't think she was hit
that hard. She just gave up some big
hits, and we had a few errors, hit batters
and bases on balls that preceded the big
hits. We just had a hard time getting out
of a couple innings this weekend, but
there's no question that we're a capable
team and that we can bounce back."
The first game of the Arizona series
was viewed by a packed crowd of over
1200 fans.The Wildcats struck first with
four early runs in the first three innings,
their only runs of the game. Finding it
self behind early, the Cardinal had the
tough task of facing Arizona pitcher
Taryne Mowatt, who boasted a streak
of 21 consecutive scoreless innings.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill re
versed Mowatt's fortunes with a fifth
inning lead-off blast to right field, her
sixth home run of the season. Ihe shot
tied her with junior Michelle Smith for
the team lead in home runs. Beside her
tremendous power potential. Rittman
commended his backstop on her de
fense as well.
"Rosey has done a great job. not only
with her power, but also with providing
the team her strong ability defensively
behind the plate," Rittman said. "Fri
day night, we lost to an Arizona team
who's very good at home. We had the
bases loaded twice and we gave our
selves opportunities to stay in the game
and win it."
On Saturday. Arizona State pitcher
Katie Burkhart blanked the Cardinal
over seven innings, allowing only one
hit to freshman Alissa llaber.
Burkhart's performance spoiled Cardi
nal junior Becky McCullough's strong
game, in which she allowed no earned
runs and eight strikeouts in six innings.
Four Stanford errors, however, proved
to be the difference, accounting for
seven unearned runs.
To finish the weekend, the Cardinal
dropped its rematch against Arizona
State, 8-2. Despite taking an early 2-0
lead over the Sun Devils, Stanford
failed to hold onto the lead as Arizona
State rallied back against Cardinal ace
Penna. Sunday's game seemed eerily
similar to Saturday's contest, according
to Rittman.
"Basically the same thing happened on
Sunday," he said."We had an early lead
and made a few mistakes. Good teams

giving the (Cardinal an 8-0 victory in six
innings. Penna also had eight strikeouts
on the night, includinu her 200 th of the

season.
However, against Arizona, Penna al
lowed four earned runs in six innings in
the circle and struck out only two Wild
cats. Sunday's game against the Sun
Devils was even more uncharacteristic
for Penna, who allowed eight earned
runs in her six innings of work. Al
though the weekend almost doubled
her loss total for the season, Rittman
showed unyielding support for his staff
ace.
"Penna can definitely bounce back."
Rittman said."l don't think she was hit
that hard. She just gave up some big
hits, and we had a few errors, hit batters
and bases on balls that preceded the big
hits. We just had a hard time getting out
of a couple innings this weekend, but
there's no question that we're a capable
team and that we can bounce back."
The first game of the Arizona series
was viewed by a packed crowd of over
1200 fans.The Wildcats struck first with
four early runs in the first three innings,
their only runs of the game. Finding it
self behind early, the Cardinal had the
tough task of facing Arizona pitcher
Taryne Mowatt, who boasted a streak
of 21 consecutive scoreless innings.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill re
versed Mowatt's fortunes with a fifth
inning lead-off blast to right field, her
sixth home run of the season. Ihe shot
tied her with junior Michelle Smith for
the team lead in home runs. Beside her
tremendous power potential. Rittman
commended his backstop on her de
fense as well.
"Rosey has done a great job. not only
with her power, but also with providing
the team her strong ability defensively
behind the plate," Rittman said. "Fri
day night, we lost to an Arizona team
who's very good at home. We had the
bases loaded twice and we gave our
selves opportunities to stay in the game
and win it."
On Saturday. Arizona State pitcher
Katie Burkhart blanked the Cardinal
over seven innings, allowing only one
hit to freshman Alissa llaber.
Burkhart's performance spoiled Cardi
nal junior Becky McCullough's strong
game, in which she allowed no earned
runs and eight strikeouts in six innings.
Four Stanford errors, however, proved
to be the difference, accounting for
seven unearned runs.
To finish the weekend, the Cardinal
dropped its rematch against Arizona
State, 8-2. Despite taking an early 2-0
lead over the Sun Devils, Stanford
failed to hold onto the lead as Arizona
State rallied back against Cardinal ace
Penna. Sunday's game seemed eerily
similar to Saturday's contest, according
to Rittman.
"Basically the same thing happened on
Sunday," he said."We had an early lead
and made a few mistakes. Good teams

Stanford couldn't break out offensively in Arizona, averaging one run per
game over the weekend. Shannon Koplitz, batting .348, along with the rest of
the Cardinal will try and reverse that trend this Friday when they host UCLA.
Ihe desert proved unfriendly for No. 12
Stanford softball, which was swept by
the Wildcats and Sun Devils in a three
game Arizona road trip. A 4-1 loss to
the defending national champion. No. 4
Arizona, on Friday followed by two
blowout losses.7-0 and 8-2 respectively,
against Arizona State made for a trou
bling weekend for the Cardinal.
The three consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference losses dropped the Cardinal

record to 27-12 overall and 3-6 in
league play. This marks the sixth con
ference loss for Stanford in its last eight
Pac-10 contests. Last weekend. Stan
ford lost the regular season series to
archrival California in a heated three
game series. Coach John Rittman ac
knowledged the difficulty of playing in
the Pac-10.
"Playing on the road in this conference
isn't easy," Rittman said. "We're play
ing some very good teams and we have
to find a way to finish games."
Coming into this weekend. Stanford
starting pitcher Missy Penna appeared
ready to step up for her squad. Ihe
sophomore's second career no-hitter
came midweek against Saint Mary's,
giving the (Cardinal an 8-0 victory in six
innings. Penna also had eight strikeouts
on the night, includinu her 200 th of the

season.

lowed four earned runs in six innings in
