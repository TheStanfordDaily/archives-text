### JENNY ALLEN 
To celebrate Founder's Day, Amy Chen
JD/MBA '07 told a crowd of visitiors that
the Stanford family's legacy is a reminder
"to have the boldness to imagine big things
and the conviction to pursue them."
"1 can think of no better way to celebrate our
Founders — on this day and every day — than to live
our lives in a way that honors this calling," she said on
Sunday, delivering a prize-winning speech to com
memorate the week.
Yesterday's Community Day, which included the
Founders' Celebration and An Art Affair, brought
thousands of visitors to campus for more than 50 free
activities, including strawberry DNA extractions at
the science fair and a commemorative screening of
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech " lbe Other Ameri
ca."delivered 40 years ago in Memorial Auditorium.
For the first time this year, community members
attended lectures on such diverse topics as the bur
geoning high tech sector and the groundbreaking re
search being done on

the human genome,
which were held to in
crease awareness about
the innovative work
being done at the Uni
versity.
"We wanted to high
light more of Stanford's
academic programs this
year to help inform and
excite our neighbors of
all ages about Stanford's
rich and varied research
enterprise," said Pat De
vaney. director of the
Office of Science Re
search, which helped or
ganize science and engi
neering lectures,
demonstrations and
hands-on activities for
the day.
Other first-time
Community Day events
included tours of Jasper
Ridge Biological Pre
serve and the Stanford
Red Barn.
"[The tours were
done] in an effort to
bring community mem
bers 'into the lab' so to
speak and get a better

sense of the kind of sci
ence and educational opportunities the Preserve
provides," said Philippe Cohen, administrative direc
tor of Jasper Ridge.
The Student Organizing Committee for the Arts
(SOCA) also held portions of their annual art festi
val — An Art Affair — at Community Day.
"We were excited to be able to incorporate brand
new workshops by student groups, interactive art and
a literary tent into 'An Art Affair' this year," said
SOCA co-Director Bria Long '09.
Ally DeArman '08, SOCA co-director, said that
the group hosted "An Art Affair" in conjunction with
Community Day "to increase visibility for student vi
sual and performing artists and to show off their in
credible talent."
The Founders' Celebration processional — re
plete with Jane and Leland Stanford actors and big
wheel bicyclists— led a crowd from the Oval to the
Mausoleum, which was opened to the public after the
student speaker contest winners — Chen and An
drea Fuller '09 — reflected on the legacy of Stan
ford's Founders.
"It was an honor to give the Founders' Celebra
tion speech," said Fuller, also an editor at I"he Daily.
"This is the first time 1 have attended Community
Day, and I am incredibly excited by how many peo
ple turned out."
Chen said that the Founders' Celebration gave
the University a "chance to celebrate and share its
venerable past, vibrant present and promising fu
ture" with local communities.
"Stanford has been a wonderful and transforma
tive place for me these past four years," she said, "so
particularly as I graduate this year, it's an honor to be
able to reflect on and share the impact that Stanford
has had on my life and on my future."
