## Cal program gives drug convicts second chance on financial aid 
### MICHELLE LOCKE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BERKELEY, Calif. — No one's applied yet for
scholarships aimed at helping University of California,
Berkeley, students denied financial aid because of a
drug conviction. But that hasn t stopped the student
run grants from raising a little smoke.
The grants approved by Cal s student government
earlier this year won a 2007 "Campus Outrage Award,
from the Delaware-based Collegiate Network.
"You would think student government at Berkeley
might want to rewnrd students with good grades, not
those who have violated school policy, federal law.state
law." said Stephen Klugewicz, executive director of the
network.
Cal student senator David Israel Wasserman helped
createthegrants — RemovinglmpedimentstoStudents
Education,or RISE — because he said its unfair for fed

eral financial aidofficialstojustsaynotocertainstudents.
"1 don't like the fact that the government singles out
and basically creates a caste of students that are not de
serving of financial aid and not deserving of the means
to go to college," he said.
While a handful of schools have extended help to stu
dents caught by the penalty, Berkeley is unusual in hav
ing a program run by students, said Tom Angell.
spokesman for the Students For Sensible Drug Policy.
The Washington-based student group joined the
ACLU last year to sue over the restriction, but the suit
was dismissed. An appeal is pending.
"It does not make sense to pull students out of
school for minor drug offenses," said Angell. "That only
increases the chances that they'll go on to develop seri
ous drug problems or commit more serious crimes and
makes it less likely that they'll become productive tax
paying citizens."
The drug conviction penalty was added to the I ligh

er Education Act in 1998. Penalties range from a one
year suspension to permanent ineligibility, depending
on the type and number of convictions. The ban, which
does not include alcohol-related offenses, can be lifted
if students complete approved rehabilitation programs.
According to Education Department figures, nearly
33.000 students who applied for financial aid for the
2(H)(i-07 school year were ineligible because of self-re
ported drug convictions (nlthough it's also possible
other factors could have disqualified those students.)
Another 1.800 were eligible for aid for only part of the
school year due to the date of their drug offenses.
More than 10.000 students left the question blank,
which means their applications weren't processed. All
told, the number of students denied aid amounted to
less than I percent of the overall 13.7 million applicants.
For the upcoming school year, the law was changed so
students only have to report drug offenses that occurred
while they were in college and getting financial aid. Data

so far indicate that out of 5.5 million applicants about
2XMK) are in the ineligible category, about 1(X) face sus
pended aid and about 2.MM) left the question blank.
At Berkeley, Wasserman sees the law as too broad,
because it covers major and minor drug offenses, and
unfair, because students aren't asked about non-drug
related convictions.
I le noted that the scholarship program, as approved
by Berkeley's Associated Students of the University of
California, comes with requirements, including 20
hours of community service, so "it's not like we're just
handing out money to people."
So far. there haven't been any applicants for the
grants, which would be funded by money generated from
student fees as well as business operations run by ASUC.
But that's OK by Wasserman. who hopes just having
the awards in place will boost lobbying efforts to repeal
the drug penalty as the education act comes up for re
view this year.
