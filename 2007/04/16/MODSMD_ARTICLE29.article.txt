## New tools unearth Fragile X Mechanisms of Down Syndrome, symptom of disease, elucidated 
### VICTOR CRUZ 
I'sing newly developed tools that examine how
brain eells make connections, a team of researchers at
the Center for Research and Treatment of Down Syn
drome recently discovered that defects in pre-synaptic
cells may influence the development of mental retar
dation, a symptom of a genetic disease known as Frag
ile X.
According to the researchers, defects in pre-synap
tic cells depress the number of brain cell connections,
a phenomenon that leads to mental retardation.
"As a result of this defect, a lot fewer connections
are formed between cells in the brain," said Molecular
and Cellular Physiology Prof. Daniel Madison. "We
believe that the basis of mental retardation is that the
neuronal network is simplified."
Because mutations in the gene that causes Fragile
X change the way post-synaptic cells look.previous re
search on synapse formation concentrated on the sig
nal reception of cells.
Jesse I lanson. a molecular and cellular physiology
researcher, predicted that the new research would
shift the focus to pre-synaptic cells.
"We realized for the first time that setting up the
pre-synaptic neurons made a difference," Hanson
said. "We've known for a while that there is modifica
tion with post-synaptic neurons, but this is the first
time there is a functional change in pre-synaptic neu
rons."
Madison and Hanson hope their findings will aid
scientists in understanding the mechanisms that give
rise to Fragile X. a disease that occurs with a frequen
cy of 1 in 4,(H)0 men and 1 in 8.000 women.
William Mobley, director of the Center for Re
search and Treatment of Down Syndrome, said he was
pleased that the research is making a difference for
those dealing with Down syndrome.
"The best part about all of this research is that fam
ilies dealing with Fragile X and Down syndrome real
ly appreciate the work." he said.
