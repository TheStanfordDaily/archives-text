ence in the Senate this year throughout the
campaign.They have pledged to attend all the
chamber's committee meetings and work
more closely with the Senate than their pred
ecessors.
But the Senate that will be sworn in next
month could be very different from the one
they led this year.

dorsed by the moderate-to-right-leaning
Stanford Review won.These candidates were
also endorsed by a loose coalition, which in

the Queer Straight Alliance.

was confident that candidates who
got elected on platforms unsupport

you're actually there," he said.

was nervous and had convinced her
self that she was not going to win. I'en

minutes later, she found out that she
had been elected to the Senate.

the ASSU as well as overseeing the
completion of Old Union.
"We'll hit the ground running,"
