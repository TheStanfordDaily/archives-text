ran as ASSU insiders, talking up their experi
ence in the Senate this year throughout the
campaign.They have pledged to attend all the
chamber's committee meetings and work
more closely with the Senate than their pred
ecessors.
But the Senate that will be sworn in next
month could be very different from the one
they led this year.

The race for control of the 15-seat ASSU
Senate was a tossup. with outsiders and fresh
men performing more strongly than expect
ed. Seven of the 13 Senate candidates en
dorsed by the moderate-to-right-leaning
Stanford Review won.These candidates were
also endorsed by a loose coalition, which in
cluded groups like The Band, the Inter-Fra
ternity Council, the Stanford Democrats and
the Queer Straight Alliance.
Only six of this year's winners were en
dorsed by the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC). This contrasts with last year's re
sults, when lOofthe 13 SOCC-endorsed Sen
ate candidates won. None of the candidates
endorsed by The Review were also endorsed
