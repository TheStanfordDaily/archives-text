NEW YORK— The nation's
largest student loan provider will stop
offering perks to college employees as
part of a settlement announced last
Wednesday in a widening probe of the
student loan industry.
SLM Corp., commonly known as
Sallie Mae. also agreed to pay $2 mil
lion into a fund to educate students
and parents about the financial aid
industry, and it will adopt a code of
conduct created by New York Attor
ney General Andrew Cuomo, who is
heading the probe.
Cuomo said the expanding inves
tigation of the $K5 billion student
loan industry has found numerous
arrangements that benefited schools

and lenders at the expense of stu
dents. Investigators say lenders have
provided all-expense-paid trips to
exotic locations for college financial
aid officers who then directed stu
dents to the lenders.
"Our position is very simple,"
Cuomo said. "Loan decisions should be
made in the best interest of the students,
and not the best interest of the school."
Sallie Mae CEO Tim Fitzpatrick
said in a statement Wednesday, "We
are pleased that Attorney General
Cuomo has recognized Sallie Mae's
leadership in the student loan indus
try and our ethical market practices
with students and schools."
ITie language closely resembled
that of a statement from Citibank,
which last week also agreed to a $2
million settlement with the office.
