# News Reader Program loses, Go-Pass fails
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN, SAM BHAGWAT ANDREA FULLER 
All hut two student groups
on the ballot received special
fees in last week's ASSU elec
tions.
In a surprise to the crowd
gathered at the CoHo Friday
afternoon, the Stanford News
Readership Program's re
quest for funds to deliver The
New York Times and San Jose
Mercury News to students was
rejected.
The Comedy ( tub. a gradu
ate student activity group that
brings professional comics to
campus every week, failed
narrowly with 4K.4 percent
support.
i"he two measures on the
ballot for graduate students
failed to pass, even though
they were supported by ma
jorities. The GO-Pass advisory
referendum would have con
tinued a controversial pro
gram to pay for off-campus
graduate students' transporta
tion. Its failure to win a super
majority likely means the end
of the program.
The Daily received its special fees
request for $49,000. with more than
80 percent of undergraduates and 62
percent of the entire student body
supporting the request. Among the
45 groups requesting undergraduate
special fees, only Student Initiated
Courses and Sexual Health Peer Re
sources Center garnered more sup
port.
Hie groups with the shakiest ma
jorities included The Stanford Pro
gressive, the Stanford Chapparal.
the Cardinal Broadcasting Network
and the Axe Committee. All re
ceived less than 55 percent of the

vote.
Measure A, the constitutional
amendment that will make it harder
for groups requesting both under
graduate and graduate special fees
to do so successfully, passed with al
most 90 percent of the vote.The un
dergraduate and graduate popula
tions must now independently ap
prove a joint special fees request for
it to pass.
The News Readership Program
received 54 percent support from
students hut failed to pass because it
received less than 15 percent of
overall support from the entire stu
dent body — a largely unknown re
quirement for groups that ask for
money from graduate and under
graduate students.
