## Student found dead in EV Friends express shock over apparent suicide 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Maurice "Mo" Morsette '09 was
found dead Thursday morning in Es
condido Village in what students are
being told is an apparent suicide.
Morsette lived in Ujamaa and was
an active member of the Native Amer
ican community on campus. Residents
of Ujamaa and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
were informed of his death Thursday
night by administrators, including Dr.

Winona Simms of
the Native Ameri
can Community
Center (NACC)
and associate deans
for religious life
Rabbi Patricia Kar
lin-Neumann and
Rev. Joanne
Sanders.
Morsette was

widely liked and news of his death was
met with disbelief.
"A lot of people were shocked,"
said Genia Begay '08, a member of the
Native American community who also
lives in I Jjamaa. "It doesn't make a lot
of sense to anyone."
It will take about one week for the
Santa Clara County Coroner's office
to officially determine the cause of
death, said Sergeant Ed Wise, a
spokesman for the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's Department.
Ilie manner in which Morsette's
body was found suggests that he
hanged himself. Wise added.
"Homicide investigators did go out
to the scene," Wise said. "Even if [a
death) does look like a suicide, there
are other things they have to do."
Morsette's death follows the highly
publicized apparent suicide of gradu
ate student Mengyao "May" Zhou in
late January and the passing of Gladys
Ayora '08 in a San Jose car crash last
month.
Rumors of Morsette's death circu
lated widely over the weekend, dis
tressing some undergraduates.
"It's so frustrating," said Julia
Schmitt '07, after hearing about
Morsette's death from several sources.
"Why is everyone killing themselves?"
Karl in-Neumann acknowledged
that the recent deaths have stunned
the community.
"One is too many." she said. "|Hut]
you can try to have a really good safe
ty net in place to prevent it."
