## Student found dead in EV Friends express shock over apparent suicide 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Maurice "Mo" Morsette '09 was
found dead Thursday morning in Es
condido Village in what students are
being told is an apparent suicide.
Morsette lived in Ujamaa and was
an active member of the Native Amer
ican community on campus. Residents
of Ujamaa and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
were informed of his death Thursday
night by administrators, including Dr.

Winona Simms of
the Native Ameri
can Community
Center (NACC)
and associate deans
for religious life
Rabbi Patricia Kar
lin-Neumann and
Rev. Joanne
Sanders.
Morsette was

widely liked and news of his death was
met with disbelief.
"A lot of people were shocked,"
said Genia Begay '08, a member of the
Native American community who also
lives in I Jjamaa. "It doesn't make a lot
of sense to anyone."
It will take about one week for the
Santa Clara County Coroner's office
to officially determine the cause of
death, said Sergeant Ed Wise, a
spokesman for the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's Department.
Ilie manner in which Morsette's
body was found suggests that he
hanged himself. Wise added.
"I lomicide investigators did go out
to the scene," Wise said. "Even if [a
death) does look like a suicide, there
are other things they have to do."
Morsette's death follows the highly
publicized apparent suicide of gradu
ate student Mengyao "May" Zhou in
late January and the passing of Gladys
Ayora '08 in a San Jose car crash last
month.
Rumors of Morsette's death circu
lated widely over the weekend, dis
tressing some undergraduates.
"It's so frustrating," said Julia
Schmitt '07, after hearing about
Morsette's death from several sources.
"Why is everyone killing themselves?"
Karl in-Neumann acknowledged
that the recent deaths have stunned
the community.
"One is too many." she said. "|Hut]
you can try to have a really good safe
ty net in place to prevent it."


Morsette
"(Morsette] was exceedingly well
connected," she added.'Tt wasn't that
he didn t know where to turn. There
are some [students] where you know
their issues and try to make sure that
someone is watching over them and
others where you just don't know.
That's part of the sadness."
Morsette was a member of the
rhree Affiliated Tribes, which in
cludes the Mandan. Hidatsa and
Ankara Nations. He grew up on the
Fort Berthold reservation in New
Town.N.D.
Hie sophomore was remembered
Friday night at an informal gathering
in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk that was host
ed by Simms, who is also the resident
fellow for the ethnic theme dorm. A
more formal memorial was held in
Tresidder Union's Oak Room yester
day.
According to friends, Morsette
was a basketball fan with a conta
gious smile and an easygoing man
ner. He united communities and fre
quently spent time at the NACC,
friends said.
"He had a silent charisma," said
Forrest Tahdooahnippah '07. a close
friend of Morsette. "The stuff he'd say
was the right stuff to say. He was real
ly laid back, really caring. He was al
ways down,you know. 1 le'd always be
there.
"He's straight off the Res," Tah
dooahnippah added. "Only seven
people went to college from his
whole high school. To get as far as he
did with a smile on his face was a tes
tament to the type of person he is."
"It's not often you see a Native
[American| man come from where
he did," said Anthony Marquez '06,
who was Morsette's freshman year
resident assistant (RA) in Muwek
ma-Tah-Ruk. "If there was one per
son 1 would talk about reservation
stuff with, it'd be Mo."
"1 look up to him." Marquez
added. "Last year one of his friends
committed suicide and he stayed with
us. He loved us.That was Mo. He is as
Native [American] as we come."

"We connected over basketball,
too," Begay said. "He knew people.
1 le could recognize basketball play
ers — he had a passion. 1 le would re
ally light up. We had a lot of fun to
gether."
Dean for Religious Life William
"Scottv" McLennan said that Stan
ford— and members of the Mental
Health Task Force in particular —
would respond to Morsette's death
by marshalling resources for stu
dents.

"I find Stanford highly resourced
in this area compared with a lot of
other universities," he said. "There
are a number of stress-reducing dy
namics here."
Karlin-Neumann, who sits on the
Campus Climate committee of the
Mental Health Task Force, said that
the task force will likely extend the
deadline for the mental health policy
report they plan to make to the
Provost's office.
"I don't know how this recent
death will change things," she said.
"The Campus Climate responsibility
was to learn more about the experi
ence of our students."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman called the apparent
suicide "a devastating loss for our
campus."
"We want to remind those who
are affected by this tragedy." he said
in a Friday press release, "that a

broad network of support is available
across the campus for students, staff
and faculty."
Boardman recommended Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center, the Office for Religious Life,
community centers and residence
staff as potential sources of support
for members of the Stanford commu
nity. McLennan also mentioned the
residence deans.
Tahdooahnippah said he thought

"He's straight off the Reservation], Only seven
people went to college from his whole high school. To
get as far as he did with a smile on his face was a

— Forrest Tahdooahnippah, senior

that Morsette may have been de
pressed on occasion, but that he was a
happy person on the whole. 1 le said
that it is difficult to come to Stanford
as a Native American man.
"You can't stereotype [depres
sion]." he said. "[Morsette] was gen
uinely happy a lot of the time.There's
a lot of stuff that you can't see.
"Coming from a reservation, there
are a lot of cultural differences," he
added. "Expectations are totally dif
ferent."
Friends said that they will always
remember Morsette as a loving, car
ing person.
"I'm really thankful," Begay said.
"I le's one of the friends who seldom
come around, you know? He was
warm and comforting and got along
with everybody."

tament to the type of person he is."
"It's not often you see a Native
[American| man come from where
he did," said Anthony Marquez '06,
who was Morsette's freshman year
resident assistant (RA) in Muwek
ma-Tah-Ruk. "If there was one per
son 1 would talk about reservation
stuff with, it'd be Mo."
"1 look up to him." Marquez
added. "Last year one of his friends
committed suicide and he stayed with
us. He loved us.That was Mo. He is as
Native [American] as we come."

"We connected over basketball,
too," Begay said. "He knew people.
1 le could recognize basketball play

Dean for Religious Life William
"Scottv" McLennan said that Stan
ford— and members of the Mental
Health Task Force in particular —
would respond to Morsette's death
by marshalling resources for stu
dents.

"I find Stanford highly resourced
in this area compared with a lot of
other universities," he said. "There
are a number of stress-reducing dy
namics here."
Karlin-Neumann, who sits on the
Campus Climate committee of the
Mental Health Task Force, said that
the task force will likely extend the
deadline for the mental health policy
report they plan to make to the
Provost's office.
"I don't know how this recent
death will change things," she said.
"The Campus Climate responsibility
was to learn more about the experi

Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman called the apparent
suicide "a devastating loss for our
campus."
"We want to remind those who
are affected by this tragedy." he said
in a Friday press release, "that a

broad network of support is available
across the campus for students, staff
and faculty."
Boardman recommended Coun

(CAPS), the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center, the Office for Religious Life,
community centers and residence
staff as potential sources of support
for members of the Stanford commu
nity. McLennan also mentioned the
residence deans.

Maurice "Mo" Morsette '09 was
found dead Thursday morning in Es
condido Village in what students are
being told is an apparent suicide.
Morsette lived in Ujamaa and was
an active member of the Native Amer
ican community on campus. Residents
of Ujamaa and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
were informed of his death Thursday
night by administrators, including Dr.

Winona Simms of
the Native Ameri
can Community
Center (NACC)
and associate deans
for religious life
Rabbi Patricia Kar
lin-Neumann and
Rev. Joanne
Sanders.
Morsette was

widely liked and news of his death was
met with disbelief.
"A lot of people were shocked,"
said Genia Begay '08, a member of the
Native American community who also
lives in I Jjamaa. "It doesn't make a lot
of sense to anyone."
It will take about one week for the
Santa Clara County Coroner's office
to officially determine the cause of
death, said Sergeant Ed Wise, a
spokesman for the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's Department.
Ilie manner in which Morsette's
body was found suggests that he
hanged himself. Wise added.
"I lomicide investigators did go out
to the scene," Wise said. "Even if [a
death) does look like a suicide, there
are other things they have to do."
Morsette's death follows the highly
publicized apparent suicide of gradu
ate student Mengyao "May" Zhou in
late January and the passing of Gladys
Ayora '08 in a San Jose car crash last
month.
Rumors of Morsette's death circu
lated widely over the weekend, dis
tressing some undergraduates.
"It's so frustrating," said Julia
Schmitt '07, after hearing about
Morsette's death from several sources.
"Why is everyone killing themselves?"
Karl in-Neumann acknowledged
that the recent deaths have stunned
the community.
"One is too many." she said. "|Hut]
you can try to have a really good safe
ty net in place to prevent it."


Morsette
"(Morsette] was exceedingly well
connected," she added.'Tt wasn't that
he didn t know where to turn. There
are some [students] where you know
their issues and try to make sure that
someone is watching over them and
others where you just don't know.
That's part of the sadness."
Morsette was a member of the
rhree Affiliated Tribes, which in
cludes the Mandan. Hidatsa and
Ankara Nations. He grew up on the
Fort Berthold reservation in New
Town.N.D.
Hie sophomore was remembered
Friday night at an informal gathering
in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk that was host
ed by Simms, who is also the resident
fellow for the ethnic theme dorm. A
more formal memorial was held in
Tresidder Union's Oak Room yester
day.
According to friends, Morsette
was a basketball fan with a conta
gious smile and an easygoing man
ner. He united communities and fre
quently spent time at the NACC,
friends said.
"He had a silent charisma," said
Forrest Tahdooahnippah '07. a close
friend of Morsette. "The stuff he'd say
was the right stuff to say. He was real
ly laid back, really caring. He was al
ways down,you know. 1 le'd always be
there.
"He's straight off the Res," Tah
dooahnippah added. "Only seven
people went to college from his
whole high school. To get as far as he
did with a smile on his face was a tes
tament to the type of person he is."
