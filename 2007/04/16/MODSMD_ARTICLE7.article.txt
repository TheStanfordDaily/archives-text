## Terrorist talk sparks debate Press ban ignites controversy University reverses policy 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three ex-terrorists scheduled to talk at Stan
ford today have sparked a maelstrom of contro
versy even before stepping foot on campus —
though much of the attention is not self-induced.
After initially banning outside press from at
tending tonight's event in Kresge Auditorium at
7 p.m., the University reversed its decision fol
lowing complaints from several media organiza
tions.
Event organizer and Stanford College Re
publicans President Megan Reiss'o7 received an
email from Nanci 11 owe. director of the Office of

Student Activities, on Thursday morning in
forming her that the event would be closed to
non-Stanford media. Ilie only reason given in
the email, later obtained by The Daily, was "stan
dard protocol."
In response, she sent out a press release de
tailing the University's decision and wrote an
op-ed that appeared in Friday's Daily.
Almost immediately, media organizations
across the country — from ITie New York Times
to The San Jose Mercury News — took interest.
An article on the University's decision to ban
outside press appeared in The San Francisco
Chronicle.
By Friday afternoon. University officials
were singing a different tune.
"There will be some outside press." Director
of University Communications Flaine Rav said
Friday."lt was pretty early yesterday
that we tried to figure out how to
have press there."
Howe did not return multiple
emails and phone calls to her office
last week.
Though the University decided
the event would be closed to the gen
eral public much earlier, organizers
were only told last week that outside
press would not be allowed either.
Iliose involved with the event
say the University's actions last
week infringed on First Amendment
rights and could be considered cen
sorship.
"When it gets to the point that
you're limiting what ideas can be ex
pressed. that almost bridges on free
speech." Reiss said. "If you ban out
side press, it means you don't want

these ideas to be expressed outside of
this little space."
She added that outside media or
ganizations only started taking no
tice of the event after the University
said that press could not attend.
"What tipped them off," she said,
"was saying they couldn't cover it."
Walid Shoebat, one of the three ex
terrorists who will be speaking at
Kresge Auditorium tonight, also had
words for the administration.
"I think it is our position and our
view that is causing the University to
bar us from speaking out," he said in
an interview with The Daily on Fri
day. "Stanford boasts about its free
dom of speech, but that's under
mined by its actions here."
Shoebat and his colleagues are
not unfamiliar with controversy.
Their strong support of Israel and
vocal criticism of Islam has created a
number of critics. Some have gone so
far as to describe them as 'islamo
phobes."
But none of that has deterred

Shoebat from speaking out against
the very ideas he claims he himself
once held.
"We need to identify what is the
principle values of these terrorists
[sic]," he said. "That is, they believe
that Islam as a religion must propa
gate through the world by force."
Shoebat is also a staunch defend
er of Israel, which he says is too often
blamed for violence in the Middle
East.
"We do not as Westerners put
blame where blame is due,"he said.
"The Middle East has always been a
hotbed of violence from both Sunni
and Shi'a Muslims. There was vio
lence going on way before the Israeli
occupation that is rarely discussed.
He added: "What is right with Israel
is very rarely focused on."
Shoebat, who was born in Pales
tine, said he spent much of his youth
fighting against Israel on behalf of
the Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion. His wife — whom he tried to
convert to Islam — convinced Shoe
bat to study Jewish beliefs more
closely.
It was then,he says,that he started
to question Islam and what he says is
its "history of propagating violence."
"I began to see that my struggle
with the Jewish people was in the
Bible," he said, "and I began to see
the futility of fighting against the
Jewish people and being anti-Semit
ic."
A convert to Christianity.Shoebat
now speaks out against Islamic ex
tremism himself.
Tonight's event is scheduled for 7
p.m. at kresge Auditorium. Tickets
will be available from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m. in White Plaza with a Stanford
ID.
