## Community Day 
### 
From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m Sunday, Stanford hosted Community Day,
inviting the general public to enjoy all that Stanford has to offer.
Highlights included a wide range of student performances,
lectures and exhibits. Enjoying the happy families and adorable
young children frolicking about campus was an activity in itself.
