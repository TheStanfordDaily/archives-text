(ilaciers pro\ ide a unique record of climate change, lee cores reveal histories of temperature, pre
cipitation. and other environmental variables \t the timescale of relevance to most historical prob
lems. the interpretation of these records is generally not precise. C ilacier advance and retreat pro
vides another sort of climate sensor. The famous "ice man" of the \lps was exposed by glacier re
treat due to warming climate, for example. Ice records are most compelling and dramatic at the
longer timescales ot the glacial-interglacial climate cycles. I lumans are creatures of the ice
ages. I his long context is an essential aspect of deep-time historv.
Kurt M. Cuffey is a professor of geography at the University of California. Berkeley. Dr ( uffe\
has a particular interest in the earth s great ice sheets. His research efforts emphasi/e environmental
change of polar regions, with a focus on glaciologic problems. He uses geophysical techniques to
reconstruct histories of temperature and snow fall rate over the ice sheets. I le is also working on bet
ter understanding of the physical and chemical processes that determine ice composition a func
tion ot climate. Dr. (uffey pioneered the use of borehole thermometry to obtain a temperature cali
bration ot the oxygen isotope record in ice cores from Summit Greenland. He is a fellow of the
AGIJ. and in 2003 he was awarded AGU's Macelwane Medal. Dr. Cuffey received Ins Ph.D. from
the University of Washington.
