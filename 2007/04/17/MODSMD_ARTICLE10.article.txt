fused to dismiss the possibility that a
co-conspirator or second shooter
was involved lie said police had in
terviewed a male who was <t "person
of interest" in the dorm shooting who
knew one of the victims, but he de
clined to give details.

public-address announcements after
the lirst shots. Many said they
learned ol the lirst shooting in an e

on their hands because of their lack
of action after the lirst incident." said

enth floor of the dorm.

other incident was going to occur."

versity closed off the dorm after the

lirst attack and decided to rely on e
niail and other electronic means to
spread the word, but said that with
11,000 people driving onto campus
first thing in the morning, it was diffi
cult to get the word out.
He said that before the e-mail
went out. the university began tele
phoning resident advisers in the
dorms and sent people to knock on
doors. Students were warned to stay
inside and away from the windows

based on the information you had at
the time. You don't have hours to re
flect on it." Steger said.

student programs manager at Virginia
lech.said their lirst notification came
in an e-mail at 9:26 a.m.. more than
two hours after the first shooting.

at West Amber Johnston earlier this
morning. Police are on the scene and
are investigating." ITie message

contact police about anything suspi
cious.

their children. It also made coun
selors available and planned an as

threats on campus over the past two
weeks but said they had not deter

laying waste to our hearts and mak
ing desolate our minds," Verbrugge
said during a prayer. "We need now
the consolation only you can give."
Alter the service. Clark's friend
Gregory Walton, a 25-vear-old who
graduated last year.said he feared his
nightmare had just begun.

large that I would know at least one
person on that list." said Walton, a
banquet manager. "I don't want to
look at that lis) I don't want to.
"It's just, it's going to be horrible,
and it's going to get worse before it
gets belter."
