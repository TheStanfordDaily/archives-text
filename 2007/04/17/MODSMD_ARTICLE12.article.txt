## Editorial Board For future execs, opportunity and responsibility 
### 
Congratulations are in order for next
year's ASSU executives, Hershey
Avula 'OH and Mondaire Jones '09.
One of the most notable facets of the
Avula/Jones campaign was its extensive
platform of proposals which the candidates
said they would champion if elected. Unlike
many other candidates for ASSU office
every year, who run on a few key issues,
Avula and Jones have done a laudable
amount of research across a broad range of
campus concerns. They will have plenty to
work with.
We urge the incoming executives to do
all that they can to pursue the majority of
the initiatives they promised last week.This
will be a particular challenge due to the
lengthy laundry list of issues they proposed
to address during the campaign. The execu
tives will have to decide how best to spend
their energy and prioritize what can be
achieved over popular-but-potentially-un
workable ideas. For example, promoting vi
sion and dental plans for graduate students
is a great rallying point for a campaign, but
would be difficult to see through even if it
were the sole responsibility of the ASSU ex
ecutives.
Other proposals, like organizing better
Big Game events, soliciting student input
for the finalization of Old Union and
streamlining interaction with the Office of
Student Activities, are not only feasible, but
should be relatively unchallenging for
Avula and Jones, who are already well
versed in the intricacies of ASSU' bureau
cracy. Both individuals worked hard in the
Senate to secure concrete student benefits
with programs like the Stanford Savers Web

site, which provides coupons and discounts
for local businesses.
Another decision the new executives
should make is to incorporate the best parts
of their opponents' policy recommenda
tions into their own initiatives.
Despite their intentionally controversial
campaign, the Warm Weather Party was right
to question why so much of the University's
attitude toward students is focused around
avoiding litigation. As ASSU executives
Avula and Jones will be in a unique position
to examine and discuss with the administra
tion specifically why this is and how to re
solve the situation. Though there are surely
more complicated legal issues at stake, the
Warm Weather Party's suggestion that all
students sign liability wavers upon attending
the University is worth looking into.
An important idea that was shared in
slightly different forms by Avula/Jones and
their principal opponents, Brett and Laksh
mi. was posting an executive cabinet mem
ber to be a liaison to the OSA. If managed
correctly, the implementation of this pro
posal could go a long way toward deescalat
ing the current tension between students
and the administration regarding that of
fice.
The high voter turnout in this election
does not necessarily mean expectations of
the ASSU have risen, but it does translate
into a certain degree of momentum for this
year's winners. We wish Avula and Jones the
best of luck with capitalizing on that sup
port. With so many students participating in
this year's electoral process, it is likely that
next year's actions (and inactions) will be
noticed.
