## SNRP: A group worth fighting for 
### AARON QAYUMI 
Amidst all the vague campaign prom
ises. unrealistic platforms and spam
emails in the 2007 ASSU Elections,
there was one group that offered a straight
forward, tangible benefit to all Stanford stu
dents. And it was rejected.
At less than $4 per year per student, the
Stanford News Readership Program dis
tributed <SOO copies of the New York Times
and (>OO copies of the San Jose Mercury
News daily at over 30 locations on campus
designed to offer equal access to graduate
and undergraduate students. The program
began in 2002 and is widely appreciated by
the student body. I artier this year.The Daily
wrote. "Of all the services available to stu
dents ;it the University, few compare in
value to the Stanford News Readership Pro
gram (SNRP)."
Although we won a majority of yes votes,
we did not get 15 percent of grad and under
grad students to vote yes so we didn't pass.
As SNRP President. I blame myself that de
spite three days worth of fliers tucked into
our papers the group came up about 100
votes short.
Undergraduate support is typically
greater than that ol the graduate communi
ty. We at the SNRP believe that this is be
cause the undergraduates have had access
to the daily papers throughout their years at

Stanford and truly appreciate their value as
part of the Stanford experience.
I could write this op-ed to denounce the
electoral process, student apathy, or the dis
tracting inundation of information during
campaign week. But instead of condemning
the Stanford community, I'd rather just
point out that I think this program will be
missed. No matter who you are, at some
point in your Stanford career you've picked
up one of our papers.
I believe that despite our failure in this
election, there is still widespread support for
our group. After all. we did still have a ma
jority ol yes votes despite ;i major drop in
grad votes. I 'm certain that the real problem
was people not knowing that the SNRP was
responsible for distributing these papers.
Now you will know this, because the papers
will not be there.
We are going from $60,000 in funding to
a maximum of $6,000. Despite student sup
port for the program, it looks like Stanford
could have empty newspaper racks on cam
pus next year. We are looking for alternate
funding and will work to keep our program
alive and win funding in next year's special
fees election. Please make sure you support
us then.
