Caterpillars are an annoyance
Have any of you sat in Sunken Diamond,
for example, or anywhere on campus, and
found caterpillars crawling around your
head and the rest of your body? It's not the
best of times. In fact, it's lousy Stanford
doesn't use insecticides — just water. And
we're in a drought situation.

C lass of '.19
Restricted access to event is deplorable
I am thunderstruck by Stanford's deci
sion to ban public access to the speech by
three former I'A terrorists Walid Shoebat,
who had to change his name when a death

sentence was his reward for changing his pol
itics, should be heard by everyone who cares
about the truth. Google him. Buy his book.
The motto of Stanford — translated
from the German — is, "The wind of free
dom blows." In this hurried, sound-bite
drive era. the University seems to have
killed off the first three words.
I haven't been this embarrassed since
The Big Game that ended with The Play.
Stanford need not solicit me for any fur
ther funding.
As I wrote in my letter terminating my
membership in MHNSA. "Though I can't
stop all the censorship in the world, I decline
to voluntarily subsidize any of it."
