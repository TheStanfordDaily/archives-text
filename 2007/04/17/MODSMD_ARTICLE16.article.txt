# Money for nothing
## 
### 
Some people at this school have a knee
jerk argument against anything that
would make Stanford a better place:
"That will cost too much money." Filling
Lake Lag costs too much money. A Bill Clin
ton commencement speech costs too much
money. More Pub Nights, a gym with show
ers, increasing wages: far. far too much
money.
People like this aren't just money-hungry
capitalist scum with no imagination or
human decency. They are also legally blind.
As anyone with working retinas can tell you,
our University recently planted three new
palm trees in front of Tresidder. To think. I
thought the people who run this school were
out of touch with the student body! I don't
know about you. but I've been saying for
years that what Stanford University really
needs is three more palm trees. On my way
home late at night from a party, with keg
beer pressing against my bladder walls,
nothing feels better than relieving myself all
over a $50,000 palm tree. My father would
appreciate the irony. I am literally pissing on
my own tuition.
I almost wish 1 could sit in on the meet
ings where decisions like this are made, but
1 like imagining them so much more:
Administrators sit around a tabic, brows fur
rowed.
President Hennessy: The workers are
asking for a living wage. The students are
asking for OSA reform. Local news is all
over us for blocking press from that ex-ter
rorist event.
Minor Functionary: We should get a palm
tree.
Somewhat Less Minor Functionary: I
have a better idea. Two palm trees.
Major Functionary: Stop thinking so
smaII.THREE new palm trees.
President I lennessy: It's risky ... (dramat
ic pause, followed by a wink and a smile) but
they don't call me John "Danger" Hennessy
for nothing!
All shake hands and playfully throw Beluga
caviar at each other.
There's a quiet mass hysteria on this cam
pus about the palm trees. We share embar
rassed giggles over how much they cost, yet
everyone feels tremendously attached to
them. TTiey somehow define our school to
such an extent that, without them. Stanford
would be a very different place. So we tend

to think.
I'm going to suggest something that may
sound grouchy: Hie palm trees represent
the absolute worst instincts of our Universi
ty, of everyone from the greenest freshman
to the fattest fat cat on the board of
trustees. They create a facade of purest
blissful beauty that hides an introverted en
vironmental turmoil. Because they are not
made for the northern California climate, it
costs a considerable sum of money to keep
them looking shiny; in a sense, they start
dying the second we plant them. Beautiful
on the outside, rotting on the inside.
Fitzgerald would have quit gin for a
metaphor like that; and then relapsed.
There is an undeniable aesthetic appeal
to living in a veritable Garden of Eden of
the world's finest flora and fauna (as op
posed to, say, the East Coast), but any corpo
ration that spends millions of dollars each
year on the aesthetic qualities of local plant
life is surely entering the final decadent
stage of empire. (No doubt the last Caesars
had beautiful gardens until the barbarians
broke through the gates and raped all the
trees.) The palm trees are here to make our
campus look attractive to everyone who
does not live here. Iliey exist for postcards,
Asian tourists and Admit Weekend.
The new palm trees — a trifecta monu
ment to all the stupid things we spend
money on — stand in stark contrast to the
little array of tents at the far corner of White
Plaza, where a few people sincere, stupid
and brave enough to fight for what's right
are starving themselves for a living wage.
For some reason, I've always found it re
markably easy to make fun of people like
the activists in SLAC (Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition). I know a lot of people who
look derisively on this whole hunger strike,
as if even thinking that such an action could
ever have any meaning was offensive. "The
Simpsons" had a hunger strike, after all.
SLAC is supposedly meeting with Presi

dent I lennessy this week, and promises that
their 11 starvation artists will not stop fast
ing until the workers of this school get a liv
ing wage. Over the last four years Hennessy
has made a lot of promises that, in a classi
cally muddled style, he doesn't quite break
but certainly doesn't fulfill. Instead, he
buries any progress under the cloud of bu
reaucracy. He convened a Presidential Ad
visory C ommittee and then ignored most of
its recommendations, possibly because the
PA( concluded that I lennessy's living wage
policy had so many conditions as to be es
sentially irrelevant; for comparison, think of
a pro-environment bill that recommends
cutting down all the rainforests, nuking the
polar ice caps and replacing all solar batter
ies with coal-fired power plants.
I hope that SI,AC can make some head
way. because a living wage is important. Yet
on some selfish level I also hope that the ad
ministration ignores them for just a few
more days. Because this weekend. Stanford
becomes an advertisement for itself, a col
lege that s safe for high schoolers, so sani
tary that even (lie most timid ethnic stereo
type mother will feel safe sending her little
genius here. Hie Stanford they are going to
see has nothing to do with the Stanford we
know. Its the administration's Stanford.
Dean Julie s Stanford, a Stanford without
problems, a snowglobe.
I would love these admits to see some
students starving themselves for social jus
tice, to see that what'seven more impressive
than Stanford s physical beauty is the fierce
devotion its students leel to the rest of hu
manity. Maybe that s not true, and we're all
as selfish and entitled as everyone says, but
it's nice to think that we could all care about
something enough to fight for it. And I
would love for these high schoolers to see
the horr it ic bipolarity of our administration.
th.it it can set three new palm trees in the
middle of school and ignore the needs of the
people who clean up our vomit, who feed us
our crappy dorm food and who do every
thing we re too busy, stupid or lazy to think
about. 3
Everything about Admit Weekend is as
fake as our palm trees. Wouldn't it be nice if
we showed them something real?
