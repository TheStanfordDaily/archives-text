GAME NOTES: The top-ranked Cardinal notched
two victories over the Los Angeles schools this
past weekend. Though neither game was the
smoothest of matches, Stanford still managed to
clinch a close win. Stanford has a chance to
clinch a share of the Pac-10 title this Saturday
when it plays cross-bay rival Cal, who lost to
UCLA and USC this past weekend. It is the Car
dinal's regular-season finale.

In what was considered to be two of
the most crucial matches of Stanford's
season, the women's tennis team came up
big just when it counted the most in its vic
tories over UCLA and Southern Califor
nia this past weekend.
The No. 1 Cardinal won the seventh
and deciding point in both matches, de
feating the Bruins and Trojans, each by a
score of 4-3.
On Friday, senior co-captain Anne
Yelsey clinched Stanford's victory when
she beat UCLA's Tracy Lin 7-6,6-4. Satur
day's match against USC wasn't over
until junior Whitney Deason came up big
with her win over the Trojans' Anca Anas
tasiu,2-b.6-4,7-5.
"It was an incredible effort on our
team's part," head coach Lele Forood
said.
The Stanford victories advanced a
theme for the Cardinal this season: win
ning close matches. Despite its lofty 19-1

mark, Stanford has had to battle for many
of its victories. Nearly letting out a chuck
le, Forood explained her team's ability to
close out wins.
"This is an unusual season: we've
played a lot of close matches." she said.
"That wasn't the case last year. Our team
has become pretty comfortable playing
close matches, though."
