GAME NOTES: The top-ranked Cardinal notched
two victories over the Los Angeles schools this
past weekend. Though neither game was the
smoothest of matches, Stanford still managed to
clinch a close win. Stanford has a chance to
clinch a share of the Pac-10 title this Saturday
when it plays cross-bay rival Cal, who lost to
UCLA and USC this past weekend. It is the Car
dinal's regular-season finale.

In what was considered to be two of
the most crucial matches of Stanford's
season, the women's tennis team came up
big just when it counted the most in its vic
tories over UCLA and Southern Califor
nia this past weekend.
The No. 1 Cardinal won the seventh
and deciding point in both matches, de
feating the Bruins and Trojans, each by a
score of 4-3.
On Friday, senior co-captain Anne
Yelsey clinched Stanford's victory when
she beat UCLA's Tracy Lin 7-6,6-4. Satur
day's match against USC wasn't over
until junior Whitney Deason came up big
with her win over the Trojans' Anca Anas
tasiu,2-b.6-4,7-5.
"It was an incredible effort on our
team's part," head coach Lele Forood
said.
The Stanford victories advanced a
theme for the Cardinal this season: win
ning close matches. Despite its lofty 19-1

mark, Stanford has had to battle for many
of its victories. Nearly letting out a chuck
le, Forood explained her team's ability to
close out wins.
"This is an unusual season: we've
played a lot of close matches." she said.
"That wasn't the case last year. Our team
has become pretty comfortable playing
close matches, though."

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Junior Whitney Deason defeated the Trojans' Anca Anastasiu at the No. 4 spot in Sunday's 4-3 win. She
took the set 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 in Los Anaeles.
Yelsey provided her uwn insight
into the team's close victories.
"We always believe we're going
win," she said. "In the last match on
Friday, I knew I could win. and I
thought 1 was going to win.
"When Whitney was on the court
on Saturday, we all believed that we
would win." Yelsey continued. "You
look across the net and you don't get
the same feeling from the USC
team."
1 orood and Yelsey were neverthe
less i|uick to praise the efforts from
the Bruins and Trojans.
" I"hey came out ready to play, and
thank goodness we were ready for it."
Yelsey said.

Critical to Stanford's victory, both
Yelsey and fellow senior co-captain
Theresa Logar swept No. 13 UCLA
(14-7.5-2 Pacific-10 Conference) and
No. 7 USC (17-3.6-1) at their one and
two spots.
"They both basically turned them
selves around this season and really
turned it up." Forood said. "They've
done an excellent job at the top of our
lineup to not be okay with losing to
good players. They've really turned
the corner."
Freshman Lindsay Burdette also
sung her praises toward the team's
captains.
"The seniors really showed their
experience in the way that they came
[out] and took care of business," she
said. "They knew all along that these
were going to be tough [matches]."
Yelsey explained her own
thoughts, beginning by acknowledg
ing that she and Logar were "com

pletely dominated last time" by the
Trojans.
" 1 think it was a combination of me
feeling more prepared as opposed to
coming off a bunch of losses before
the last USC match," Yelsey said.
"Theresa and 1 both wanted re
venge."
Logar, in particular, got revenge
against USC's Lindsey Nelson, whom
many consider to be one of the best
players in the NCAA. Nelson stands
at six feet and invariably provides a
tough match-up for her opponents.
As Forood explained. Logar was
able to take Nelson out of her game,
forcing the Lady Trojan to make hits
that were out of her comfort zone.
Putting it in tennis terms, Forood
said that Nelson was hitting balls out
side of her "strike zone" the whole
day. Logar's ability to take Nelson out
of her game enabled the Cardinal to
finish with a crucial 6-4,6-4 victory.

As a side note. Stanford was not at
full strength in its matches against the
Los Angeles schools.
Sophomore Jessica Nyugen. a sig
nificant contributor for the Cardinal
this season, has been sidelined with
foot problems. Junior Celia Durkin
has also struggled with health issues.
Durkin was forced to forfeit during
her match against UCLA.
With all the struggles the women
had to endure, Forood was simply
happy to come out of the weekend
undefeated.
In the weekend sweep. Stanford
pushed its conference record to 7-0,
guaranteeing itself at least a share of
the conference title. A win over Cali
fornia this Saturday will earn the team
the conference title outright: a USC
loss to UCLA will do the same,as well.
