spot on the uneven bars and captured her third
all-around win with a 39.475. Yim's win was ex

tional.

"Tabby has competed at NCAAs alone for
the past two years, [and now] rejoiced with tears
of happiness because she'd finally have a team
there with her," sophomore Kelly Fee said. "We
all felt like a year-long weight had been lifted
from us. For the juniors who had only two more
shots at winning an NCAA title, this was the mo
ment they had dreamt of."
Fee has consistently led the team on the un
even bars for the bulk of the season and she de

title while fellow junior co-captain Liz Tricase won the vault event.
swinging on Saturday.
It's definitely hard for me to not
put pressure on myself," Fee said.
"Starting off the meet with a good
routine is crucial, hut 1 try to use this
as fuel. Plus, our team has a sort of
motto: 'I've got your back.' Keeping
that in mind always calms my
nerves."
Sophomore Nicole Ourada fol
lowed l*ee with a 9.725, while junior
Alex Pintchouk scored a 9.775 and
freshman Carly Janiga came up with
a big 9.8. Alter Yim's event-winning
9.9, the Card had five strong scores
and expected a sixth from junior Liz
rricase. An unexpected and unchar
acteristic fall on one of Tricase's
trademark moves erased that final
strong score.
"We all know that Liz can hit a
bar routine almost perfectly,"
Pintchouk said. "We had five good
hits before the fall,so we were still in
a good position. Liz will definitely hit
it at nationals."
Last weekend wasn't all bad news
for Tricase, though. She won the
vault with a 9.9.
The balance beam — an event
that posed some problems for the
Card at last year's regionals — fol
lowed the uneven bars.
Stanford has trained this year to
handle high-pressure situations like
those posed on the balance beam
when at nationals. Training has in
cluded putting the beam in the hall
way to have the crew team yell at the
gymnasts as they did a routine.
Some lineup changes on the
beam also happened mid-season,
putting four juniors to compete in
the first four spots. With a strong dis
play of self-assurance, junior Lauren
Elmore led the quartet, as she has all
season, with a 9.8.
"After bars, Lauren exited the
locker room and had an indescrib
able look of determination and con
fidence on her face," Fee said. "1 had
absolutely no doubt that she would
lead us off with a hit on beam."
"She is the rock of our beam
team," added head coach Kristen
Smyth.
After the quartet of juniors. Fee
performed one of her best routines
of the season. She scored a 9.9 for a
five-way tie for second. Janiga had
her second fall of the season, but the
Card finished the second event with
a 49.25 and a slight lead.
Pintchouk started the Cardinal
tumblers with one of her best rou
tines, scoring a 9.85 on the floor.
"1 really enjoy leading off. and 1
love competing on floor: it is one of
my favorite events," Pintchouk said.
"On Saturday, I came in with confi

dence and thinking about each indi
vidual movement. 1 let the pressure
go and just had so much fun."
Elmore, Fee, Janiga and Ourada
all scored above a 9.8. Yim competed
on the floor for the first time since
January, scoring a 9.85.
"Yim's floor routine is full of non
stop action and high energy," Smyth
said. "The whole crowd pays atten
tion when Tabitha performs. She re
ally lights up an arena."
In the last event of the night,
freshman Blair Rvland earned the
leadoff role and scored a 9.8 on the
vault.
"I really like competing, and I
missed out on being in lineups at
Pac-lOs," Ryland said. "So, I just did
the best job I could on vault during
practice leading up to Regionals. We
were on a roll coming off the other
three events, and it was exciting to
start off our last rotation strong."
The rest of the rotation went
smoothly. Tricase came back from a
difficult fall on the bars and finished
with an event-winning vault of 9.9.
Hie finish wrapped up Stanford's
NCAA Regional title, and after a
disappointing finish last year, this
year's win was an extremely impor
tant and emotional moment for the
team.
"We were all crying because we
were so happy." Ourada said. "We
are so excited to put in the extra
work and get those little half tenths
that we have been missing. We are
going to do what we have done all
season, go out there with confidence
and have fun with our gymnastics."
The Cardinal women next com
pete at the NCAA National Cham
pionships in Salt Lake City, Utah on
April 26.
