# Men's tennis drops two matches to LA schools
## Stanford challenges USC but drops two of three in doubles 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team is getting a
little stronger with every match that it plays,
but that slight improvement is still not proving
to be enough.
The No. 50 Card dropped two matches this
past weekend to its southern California coun
terparts. both of whom are ranked in the top
10. Despite the losses, when compared to the

last meeting with these Pacific-10 Conference
rivals. Stanford did significantly better this
time around.
Stanford (7-15. 2-4 Pac-10) first fell to No.
10 UCLA,S-2.0n Friday before being narrow
ly edged out by No. 8 Southern California. 4-2,
on Saturday. These results are a marked im
provement from February's 5-2 and 7-0 losses
to the Trojans and the Bruins, respectively.
The Cardinal's loss to the Trojans was the
closer of the two contests last weekend. There
were even points in the afternoon where a
Stanford victory seemed to loom on the hori
zon. Stanford eventually hit the court amidst
Saturday's blistering cold two hours later than
scheduled because of rainy weather.
Despite recent success in doubles, the Card

dropped (wo of three double matches against
USC for a 1-0 deficit. With a put-away volley
and an overhead, the Trojans nabbed the sec
ond and third doubles matches, respectively,
with scores of 8-3 and 8-5. Stanford earned a
small moral victory shortly after, when No. 27
sophomores Matt Bruch and Blake Muller
beat No. 38 Robert Farah and KaesVan't llof,
8-7.
"Against good teams, that doubles point is
gigantic." head coach John Whitlinger said. "I
think we were all a little unhappy that we did
n't come out and play a little better doubles.
I'm happy for Matt and Blake to win that
match — which is an important match for

GAME NOTES! Stanford struggled in the doubles position
against USC, dropping two of three matches. Singles play
went a little better, with the Cardinal hanging in there in the
final two matches. Nevertheless, Stanford comes into its game
against Ftacific right after a loss. The Tigers also dropped their
last match, a 6-0 sweep by San Francisco.
them as a team — but 1 was hoping that we could
sneak that doubles point because 1 like the new
doubles combinations and thought that would
give us a chance."
Freshman Kevin Kaiser notched the first
point of the day against USC with his victory at
the fourth singles spot. Earning breaks and
pulling away in the middle of both sets. Kaiser
picked up a 6-4,6-3 win.
"Kevin has really come on in the last couple
weeks and has played some good tennis for us,"
Whitlinger said. "I'm happy to see the progress
he's been making."
Stanford briefly took the lead when freshman
Richard Wire tallied the next win over No. 44
Dejan Cvetkovic. No. 75 Wire led 5-0 in the first
before closing out the set 6-2 when Cvetkovic
missed a volley. The Stanford freshman then
earned an early break in the second set and
closed out the match, 6-2,6-3.
"When Matt couldn't play [singles] and
everybody had to move up, I was really im
pressed with how the guys came out. and Rich es
pecially," Whitlinger said. "But that's what he's
capable of. He played a pretty good match
against a pretty darn good player from USC."
"1 like the way Rich played the whole match."
Whitlinger continued. "In spots, he can play very
well, but for some reason, sometimes he lets
down. But on Saturday, he played a complete
match. We talked about a few things, and he real
ly took them to heart. I'm very proud of him."
The Stanford lead did not last for long as USC
was able to earn two wins at the bottom of the
lineup. The Trojans picked up the fifth and sixth
singles matches to gain a 3-2 edge.
The remaining two matches were neck and
neck, but USC ultimately claimed the win and
showed why it is in the top 10. At the third singles
spot, despite opening the match with a service
break, Stanford senior captain Eric McKean nar
rowly fell in a tiebreaker in the first set and 6-4 in
the second.
Once USC had clinched the match, Muller re
bounded. claimed the second set and was on
serve in the third. However, due to time con
straints, Muller was not able to complete his
match with No. 101 Van't Hof.

"Blake's still not completely back to where 1
think he can be, but he's making some big strides
toward that," Whitlinger said. "It's nice to see
him end the season the way he is. 1 le's a competi
tor. and he had a rough stretch there for a bit so
it's just nice to see him be able to compete. I 'm
really happy with the way things have progressed
this year, and I'm looking for bigger and better
things in the years to come."
Stanford put up a valiant effort on Friday
against the Bruins as well, but fell short.

but fell in the super-tiebreaker for the third.
Stanford is scheduled to face Pacific today at

"Right now, we've just got to worry about
going out and beating UOP, and after that, Cal."
Whitlinger said. ". They beat us up pretty good
[in Berkeley] and so we'd love to get a little pay
back. It might be a match where they have to
beat us to get in the [NCAA] tournament, so
they'll be fired up to play."
