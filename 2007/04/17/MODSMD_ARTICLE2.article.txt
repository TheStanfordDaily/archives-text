# Day 5 of labor fast
## Students met with Hennessy last night but no resolution on the living wage demands made by SLAC leaders 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC) met yesterday with
President John Hennessy, Human Re
sources Director Diane Peck and Dean of
Students Maureen Powers to discuss the
University's living wage policy for con
tracted workers.The meeting came on the
fifth day of an ongoing hunger strike by 12
SLAC members to protest the policy,
which they see as unfair.
"SLAC is challenging Stanford to be
the model employer that |it is] claiming to
be." said SLAC spokesperson Shamala
Gallagher'o7.
She said the hunger strike will end
when SLAC and Hennessy come to an
agreement regarding restrictions that cur
rently exclude some contracted workers
from the living wage policy.
Approximately 70 students supporting
SLAC s six-person delegation walked to
gether from White Plaza to Building 170
where the meeting was held late yesterday
afternoon. Many students remained for
the entire meeting, offering support to the

negotiating team.
"The students made a proposal and a
series of suggestions," dean Powers told
Ihe Daily after the meeting. "The presi
dent listened carefully to everything the
students said."
She said those fasting are "choosing" to
do so.
"They and the president are meeting in
good faith today and will meet again in
good faith tomorrow [Tuesday]." she
added. "1 understood that the fast was
going on until they got a meeting. 1 was
surprised when they said that the fast
would continue."
Some students cheered on the protestors.
"1 think it's really awesome to see soli
darity among the students," said Mikayel
Currim 'OS. who passed the SLAC gather
ing on the way back from class. "1 hope
I lennessy pays heed to this."
Five SLAC members began to fast last
Thursday in an effort to get the attention
of administrators and to secure a meeting
with Hennessy; seven other fasters joined
on Sunday.Those abstaining from food in
clude undergraduates, graduate students
and three workers.

"1 think a fast is a really big statement,"
said faster l.isa Llanos '09, who is also a
member (if the outgoing ASSU Under
graduate Senate. "A lot of people tend to
be really apathetic on this campus. People
won't take the time to educate themselves
on what's going on. I think that changes
when you put your health and your body
on the line."
"We are students of this university,"
she added. "We are here. We go to classes
here. It's their responsibility to us to listen
to us. The administration sometimes
seems like this impenetrable fortress.
| But | if we get enough student support we
can really make this happen."
SLAC members are protesting seven
restrictions on the living wage policy
which they claim exclude most low-wage

workers from the policy's outlined guide
lines— guidelines that include a salary
higher than $11.15 per hour for contracted
employees who have benefits and $12.5 l )
per hour for those who lack benefits. The
living wage policy also includes paid vaca
tion time; Hennessy has said that he is
committed to upholding the policy.
Members of SLAC assert that the liv
ing wage policy does not cover many
workers, and I rnesto Garcia, a contracted
worker who is taking part in the fast,
agreed.
"The contract with the company I work
with is that the minimum wage is $8 an
hour," said Garcia, who works for ABM
Janitorial Services. "1 don't care about

how much I make working hut I do
care about my dad because he [also]
works here."
In a document released by the
President's Advisory Committee for
Workplace Policy in December 2006,
Human Resources recognized four
existing restrictions but recommend
ed that they remain unchanged.
These restrictions require that con
tracts last for at least a year, that
workers work at least 30 hours a
week for six months, that workers
are not represented by a union and
that the value of a contract exceeds
$100,000 per year. Workers em
ployed by subcontractors under con
tracts that fail to meet all of these
conditions are not covered bv the

University's living wage policy.
In a statement released by the
Stanford News Service last night
after the meeting, the University as
serted that the current guidelines
cover approximately 125 to 150
workers who provide basic services
under current contracts.
SL.AC spokesman Matt Seriff-
Cullick '08 was optimistic about the
outcome of the meeting, which lasted
for one hour. Another meeting will
be scheduled for sometime today.
"It didn't seem as though there's
been no progress," he said. "I do feel
like this is going to bring results."
Seriff-Cullick said that SLAC
provided Hennessy, Powers and
Peck with a sheet of paper which
contained what he called a "one
page long preamble that frames our
demands," along with a list of imper
atives. In a statement. University of
ficials termed the text a "Code of
Conduct that has provisions that go

beyond the living wage policy."
Yesterday's meeting was the culmi
nation of a long attempt to secure a
meeting with Hennessy, SLAC
members said. Seriff-Cullick said
that he had been denied meetings
several times. Llanos said that ASSU
senators had also been denied a
meeting after the Senate passed a
resolution calling on the University
to extend the living wage policy ear
lier this year.
The administration asserted,
however, that it respects students'
concerns regarding the policy.
"It's not unusual at all for propos
als to come from a student group,"
said Kate Chesley, a spokesperson
for the president's office. "The fact
that the living wage policy has been
enacted is proof that the students'
proposals are taken quite seriously."

would continue."
Some students cheered on the protestors.
"1 think it's really awesome to see soli
darity among the students," said Mikayel
Currim 'OS. who passed the SLAC gather
ing on the way back from class. "1 hope
I lennessy pays heed to this."
Five SLAC members began to fast last
Thursday in an effort to get the attention
of administrators and to secure a meeting
with Hennessy; seven other fasters joined
on Sunday.Those abstaining from food in
clude undergraduates, graduate students
and three workers.

"1 think a fast is a really big statement,"
said faster l.isa Llanos '09, who is also a
member (if the outgoing ASSU Under
graduate Senate. "A lot of people tend to
be really apathetic on this campus. People
won't take the time to educate themselves
on what's going on. I think that changes
when you put your health and your body
on the line."
"We are students of this university,"
she added. "We are here. We go to classes
here. It's their responsibility to us to listen
to us. The administration sometimes
seems like this impenetrable fortress.
| But | if we get enough student support we
can really make this happen."
SLAC members are protesting seven
restrictions on the living wage policy
which they claim exclude most low-wage

workers from the policy's outlined guide
lines— guidelines that include a salary
higher than $11.15 per hour for contracted
employees who have benefits and $12.5 l )
per hour for those who lack benefits. The
living wage policy also includes paid vaca
tion time; Hennessy has said that he is
committed to upholding the policy.
Members of SLAC assert that the liv
ing wage policy does not cover many
workers, and I rnesto Garcia, a contracted
worker who is taking part in the fast,
agreed.
"The contract with the company I work
with is that the minimum wage is $8 an
hour," said Garcia, who works for ABM
Janitorial Services. "1 don't care about

how much I make working hut I do
care about my dad because he [also]
works here."
In a document released by the
President's Advisory Committee for
Workplace Policy in December 2006,
Human Resources recognized four
existing restrictions but recommend
ed that they remain unchanged.
These restrictions require that con
tracts last for at least a year, that
workers work at least 30 hours a
week for six months, that workers
are not represented by a union and
that the value of a contract exceeds
$100,000 per year. Workers em
ployed by subcontractors under con
tracts that fail to meet all of these
conditions are not covered bv the

University's living wage policy.
In a statement released by the
Stanford News Service last night
after the meeting, the University as
serted that the current guidelines
cover approximately 125 to 150
workers who provide basic services
under current contracts.
SL.AC spokesman Matt Seriff-
Cullick '08 was optimistic about the
outcome of the meeting, which lasted
for one hour. Another meeting will
be scheduled for sometime today.
"It didn't seem as though there's
been no progress," he said. "I do feel
like this is going to bring results."
Seriff-Cullick said that SLAC
provided Hennessy, Powers and
Peck with a sheet of paper which
contained what he called a "one
page long preamble that frames our
demands," along with a list of imper
atives. In a statement. University of
ficials termed the text a "Code of
Conduct that has provisions that go

beyond the living wage policy."
Yesterday's meeting was the culmi
nation of a long attempt to secure a
meeting with Hennessy, SLAC
members said. Seriff-Cullick said
that he had been denied meetings
several times. Llanos said that ASSU
senators had also been denied a
meeting after the Senate passed a
resolution calling on the University
to extend the living wage policy ear
lier this year.
The administration asserted,
however, that it respects students'
concerns regarding the policy.
"It's not unusual at all for propos
als to come from a student group,"
said Kate Chesley, a spokesperson
for the president's office. "The fact
that the living wage policy has been
enacted is proof that the students'
proposals are taken quite seriously."
