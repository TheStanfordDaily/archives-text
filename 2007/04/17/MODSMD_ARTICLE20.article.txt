## Broncos visit the Farm Card hopes to continue clutch hitting 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After snapping Arizona's 16-
game winning streak on Sunday and
earning its first Pacific-10 Confer
ence victory, Stanford baseball looks
to start a streak of its own.
With just one win in league play,
the Cardinal (15-17, 1-8 Pac-10)
needs to garner as much momentum
from Sunday as possible. Stanford
faces its first test tonight, as Santa
Clara (18-19,5-4 West Coast Confer
ence) visits Sunken Diamond for a 6
p.m. non-conference game.
"Any games now that we can win
are big to kind of keep it rolling."
catcher Brian Juhl said. "[Santa
Clara] always plays us tough; I kind
of like playing them. They're pretty
good players and it's a pretty good
team, so it's always a challenge."
Clutch hitting paved the way to
Stanford's first league victory of the
season, as the Cardinal finally broke
out against Arizona's pitching with a
three-run third. The runs were
spurred by sophomore center fielder
Sean Ratliffs homerun.and a double
and excellent base running by fresh
man designated hitter Toby Gerhart.
But as head coach Mark Mar
quess acknowledged, at this point.
Stanford's Pac-10 hopes look bleak.
"Obviously, realistically, I think
we're way behind." Marquess said.
"We were 2-7 last year and still man
aged to do it. But to be honest with
you, we're not too worried about the
Pac-10; we're just worried about
hopefully playing a little bit more
consistent baseball and good solid
games."
Following tonight's matchup, the

Card squares off against Pac-10 rival
California (IK-1 1 ), 3-6) in a three
game weekend series at Berkeley.
"[Sunday's win] gives us a little
bit of momentum, but what really
could help us is Tuesday night," jun
ior right-hander Erik Davis said.
"Siring a couple wins together and
then beat (Cal ace] Tyson Ross on
Friday and watch out, because Stan
ford's back. And I think that's a very
big possibility.
