1 didn't even know where to begin
this week. Here's a look at some note
worthy sports stories:
Chi-Town Chaos
Last week, the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee selected Chicago over Los An
geles for America's bid for the 2016
summer games. Now. I'm all for shar
ing the wealth; after all. L.A. has al
ready hosted the games twice before
in 1932 and 1984. But let's not forget
the column's title.
Given Southern California's
plethora of athletic facilities and po
tential benefits from hosting the 2016
Olympics. I'm beginning to second
guess the USOC's decision. Given re
cent sites' inefficiency at hosting the
games (Atlanta's commercialization
and Athens' tardiness in constructing
venues), if things go wrong in Chicago
in 2016. don't say 1 didn't tell you so.
L.A. is one of the few Olympic
hosts to have actually turned a profit
for the IOC during the games.The city
already has more than enough world
class sites available,especially with the
recent construction of the Home
Depot Center and Staples Center.
Furthermore, the main Olympic Sta
dium already exists in the Memorial
Coliseum. L.A. would not have to
build a new site far from its fellow ven
ues.
However, the city would be forced
to invest a few million into refurbish
ments for the coliseum — something
that could finally secure a pro football
team for the town. Two birds with one
stone, anyone?
Nevertheless, Chicago stands a re
ally great shot at landing the games.
Fellow potential sites Tokyo and
Prague both have major factors
against them.Tokyo hosted the World
Cup in 2002. and the IOC will likely
not award the games to Europe two
times in a row. So I'll throw my support
behind Chicago, just as long as the
combustible personalities of Lou
Piniella and Ozzie Guillen are gone by
then.
Don't Hit the "Panic" Button Yet
The media keeps blasting the Yan
kees. who lost two of three close ones
to desk editor Liz Aguilar's Athletics
this past weekend. Mariano Rivera
blew the save opportunity against Scu
taro. the starting rotation is in sham
bles and Derek Jeter is making more
errors than Bill O'Reilly in a debate
against Geraldo Rivera.
Look. Roger Clemens will join the
Empire soon enough. The Yanks will
still whack eight runs per game and
eventually win the AL East before los
ing to the Angels in the AL Division
Series. And no matter which way you
think about it, A-Rod is gone after this
season.
Making Strides?
Sunday evening marked a histori
cal moment at Chavez Ravine in Los
Angeles. Sixty years ago as of Sunday
night, Jackie Robinson broke base
ball's color barrier by donning a
Brooklyn Dodgers uniform.
And while African-Americans
have made strides in baseball since
1947, African-Americans today com
prise less than 10 percent of all MLB
players. While I don't blame direct
racism as the reason for this phenom
enon, these numbers speak to a grow
ing problem: urban cities' lack of ac
cess to baseball.
The sport has been institutional
ized over the past few years, as kids
simply do not play pick-up games on
the street like in the good ol' days.
Children instead are forced to join lit
tle leagues, which take a lot of the
spontaneity out of the game.
Initiatives such as the Urban Youth
Academy in Compton. Calif, are ex
cellent examples of major-league
baseball reaching out to the greater
community, but MLB is only hurting
its cause by spending so many more
resources by scouting in Latin Ameri
ca rather than in America's urban
cities.
In fact. 1 still remember my uncle
Mauro describing his playing days
with Jackie Robinson — before the
historic year of l l )47. Without the


Lomeli
The SoCol Bias
inner-city resources to play the game,
players like Robinson may never
have been exposed to baseball.
But let us not forget the most im
portant lesson we can get from Jackie
Robinson. After the 1956 season, the
man was traded to the New York Gi
ants. Robinson chose retirement over
disgracing himself by playing for the
orange and black.
