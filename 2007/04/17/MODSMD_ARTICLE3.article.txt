### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a packed Kresge Auditorium rimmed with cops
and scattered with cameras last night, three men claim
ing to he formei terrorists rained fire and brimstone
down on Islam a faith they said they once held —in
a talk that elicited a wide range ot reactions from the
charged crowd.
In fiery speeches mai ked by some jeers as well as pe
riodic applause, the men called on the audience to open
its eyes to what they said were the dangers of the reli
gion.
"Islamic terrorism wants to establish hegemony
around the world,"said Walid Shoebat.
the last man to take the podium."Once
it gains strength, that's when you will
see the true face of Islamic fundamen
talism."
ITie ex-terrorists also said that
Americans needed to "wake up to
the dangerous realities of the Islam
ic faith."
"America is not just asleep," said
Kamal Saleem. the first speaker.
"America is ignorant of truth."
All three described their religious
upbringings and how they first got in
volved with terrorism at an early age.
"By 13, I had my first kill." said
Xak Amani. the second speaker who
is from Beirut, Lebanon. "1 had be
come a man."
Saleem's story was equally chill
ing.
"At seven years of age, I went to
an assault camp."he said. "I trained
on anti-aircraft guns. I trained on
everything."
"I felt I was the purpose of Islam."
he added.
The men described the violence in
their early lives as the consequences
of their faith, often singling out Islam
among others.
"Christian fundamentalists give
the world a headache." Shoebat said,
drawing some laughter. "Muslim fun
damentalists chop the head right off."
The men also criticized the vilifica
tion they said they have suffered for
their remarks, saying that the liberty
given to critics of Judaism and Chris
tianity is not always extended to critics
of Islam.
"Every time we say things in the
media, we are being looked at as Islam
ophobes, racists, hate-mongers, you
name it." Shoebat said."()nce you start
saying 'Islam,' that's it.That's where the
buck ends."
Ihe three men have been rebuked
for their strong criticism of Islam, and
some have questioned their claims to
be former terrorists.
Security was very heavy at the
event, which was organized by mem
bers of Stanford College Republi
cans and Hie Stanford Review .There
were large numbers of police present
as well as restrictions on personal be
longings. Many students complained
that they had to leave their back
packs under trash cans and hidden in
corners outside the building, after
being told they could not bring them
into the auditorium.
But other students were more un

derstanding of the extra precautions.
"After hearing these guys talk. I can
understand how there can be serious
security concerns." said Kyle Pubols'W.
Several members of the press were
also in attendance, including crews
from at least three television news pro
grams and reporters from Ihe New
York Times and The San Francisco
Chronicle. The University initially told
event organizers that outside media
would be banned from the event but
later changed its decision after receiv
ing numerous complaints from news
organizations.
In the question-and-answer session
following the individual remarks, the
speakers often clashed with audience
members.
"If you do not believe this, you are
an ignorant Muslim. You are not a
true Muslim," Amani said to one Pak
istani student who argued with him on
the role of fighting in the Koran.
The student, Fahad Mahmood TO,
challenged Amani further.
"Different people interpret the
Koran differently." he said."You inter
pret it your way."
"You cannot interpret the Koran."
Amani replied."That is not faith."
There were also audience mem
bers who appeared to agree with the
speakers, giving standing ovations
and frequent applause. Many of those
who seemed to approve of the speak
ers' comments, however, were con
centrated in the first seven rows of the
auditorium, which were reserved for
outsiders specially invited to the
event.
As if to mark the disparity in the
audience's reception of the ex-ter
rorists. the evening ended as some
of the audience applauded while
one unidentified student yelled an
grily at the speakers as they left the
stage.
"It was nothing." said Aaron Pol
hamus OS as he left."if not controver
sial."
