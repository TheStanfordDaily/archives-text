On their last legs, hikers stride along a public path adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek toward the end of a 23.5-mile trek around the perimeter of
the Stanford campus. About a dozen people made the full-day journey led by
History Prof. David Kennedy '63 on a rainy Saturday.
the campus.
We begin at dawn, or rather every
one else begins at dawn. The group
starts at the intersection of Palm Drive
and El Camino Real where large
sandstone gates mark the entrance to
the University. As the first rays of sun
light peek down from the heavens, the
group is heading east toward Gunn
High School, but 1 am lost in Escondi
do Village, winding my way through
bungalows and eucalyptus trees. As 1
search for the group. 1 worriedly chew
750 calories worth of Clif bars that I 've
stolen from my roommate. Slung over
my shoulder is a messenger bag that
contains everything I've been told to
bring: water, food and a raincoat. I
hope it will not rain.
1 join the group about 30 minutes
after they've begun. Walking down
Stanford Ave., the group looks like
what it is — a bunch of academics
(plus reporters) out for a walk.The at
tire is. fittingly, an odd mix of North
Face water-resistant pants, V-necked
sweaters, and thick-rimmed glasses, as
though Sherlock Holmes has dressed
up to climb Mount Everest. Wishing
that 1 had put on something herring
bone-patterned. 1 merge awkwardly
with the line of walkers and try to keep
up.
Jon Christensen '81 welcomes me
to the group. Christensen is a current
ly a history graduate student and a re
search fellow at the Center for Envi
ronmental Science and Policy It was
his winter quarter course "What Went
Down on the Farm: Stanford Campus
as a Laboratory for Environmental
History" that served as the inspiration
for this epic endeavor. Jon tells me
about the varied members of our
party, pointing out professors, re
porters and post-docs as the mouth
piece of his water-bottle-backpack -
hybrid sways lazily above his shoulder.
Jon introduces me to Peter Wright '08.
who took his class and has organized
many of the logistics of the walk. A
graduate of an outdoor survival
school. Peter is wearing a hat and
snazzy backpack and seems eminently
prepared. He and 1 are the only under
graduates on the walk.
As Kennedy strides by, the KQED
journalist riding in his wake. Jon
makes a quick introduction, and I'm
suddenly at Kennedy's side. Jon has
told me that Kennedy is a Pulitzer
prizewinner and now an acting mem
ber of the Pulitzer Prize Board. Just
the day before, the distinguished pro
fessor was in New York City making
the final decisions about this year's
prizes. I tag along next to Kennedy like
a lost, star-struck puppy, still in awe of
the fact that I am walking next to the
man who wrote my eighth-grade
American history textbook.
Kennedy's pace is fiercely aerobic,
and I have trouble keeping up, despite
the fact that he's 65 and has legs hard
ly longer than mine. He asks about my
major and my own writing interests,
and soon we're off on a discussion
about the theater. He and I agree on
several things: the state of modern
American drama (worrying). Tom
Stoppard's plays (more textbook than
dialogue) and "Anna in the Tropics"
(decent). We disagree, however, on
Alan Bennett's "The History Boys"
— I say it's profound, he says it's in
conclusive. I immediately reconsider.
Kennedy also mentions that he is lis
tening to lan McKellan reading
Robert Fagles' translation of the
"Odyssey" on tape. It's oddly fitting,as
we ourselves are on a sort of peripatet
ic odyssey. And perhaps Kennedy is
our brave Odysseus, although I'm not
sure about the hordes of suitors at
home.
The group rests for a moment at
some soccer fields that Stanford leases
to a nearby school, but it's only a few
minutes before Kennedy recom
mences the adventure,setting the pace
for our motley procession. The area is
charmingly suburban, and although
Stanford's ownership of the land is not
at all apparent. I know we're literally
walking the boundary of the Stanford
owned lands. Christensen tells me that
he has had to secure permission from
all of Stanford's tenants for us to walk
along the perimeter of the property,
which crosses roads and even High
way 280. He is enthused about the
walk.even now that he is experiencing
its painful reality. Ile tells me about
the Web site he is building to docu
ment the journey:
walkingthefarm.stanford.edu (acces
sible only to users with Stanford IDs).
We walk on sidewalks and highway
shoulders, discovering among other
things that Stanford owns a small vine
yard. We also skirt the periphery of the
Stanford Research Park,one of the in
dustrial parks that started off the Sili
con Valley boom. We leave the road
and start up into the foothills, which
look just like pristine ranch land, but
without the cows. There is no path
here, so we keep close to the barbed
wire fence that delineates the proper
ty boundary. Prying hard not to fall
sideways into the barbed wire. I shuf
fle through the long grass and weeds
that cover the hills. Ihe KOED re
porter strides beside me, holding the
microphone next to my feet to cap
ture, presumably, the sound of my as
cent. We reach the top of a hill and
look below us at Highway 280, which
looks no bigger than a stream winding
through the hills.To the east is the Bay,
and to the west is the Pacific, hardly

visible through the incoming rain
clouds. We descend, stopping periodi
cally to duck under barbed wire
fences. Kennedy's jacket is momentar
ily caught on a barb, and we all freeze,
but. he is freed and we continue.
The foothills are interrupted peri
odically by stretches of quiet road.
Hi ere is more ducking under fences,
filing through gates and getting stuck
in barbed wire. In one field, we see a
collection of well-fed goats, and
Kennedy stops. "This is where the Sa
tanic circle was." he observes calmly.
We accept this statement reverently.as
is appropriate for such a place. Hie
spot is indeed ideal for a Satanic circle;
it's well-shaded, and besides, there are
goats to sacrifice. 1 reflect momentari
ly on Stanford's rich history.
As we continue through the hills,
the barbed wire fence turns into a dirt
path, and the only marker of the Stan
ford land boundary is a ridge of trees
that Jon points out just before we pass
under 1 lighway 280 through a tunnel.
We learn from Jon's occasional com
mentary that between the Research
Park and Jasper Ridge lie the Stan
ford-owned polo grounds, in addition
to a number of areas that are leased by
tenants such the Webb Ranch, which
grows organic produce and runs a sta
ble. As we walk through the Ranch, 1
am introduced to a history post-doc
and her husband, a visiting professor
from Florida, two grad students and
others, including Nora Sweeny, a
charming alum and University admin
istrator with whom I share English de
partment gossip.
Just as we're starting through the
Webb Ranch, a downpour begins. My
ill-chosen cotton pants are soaked, as
are my running shoes. Blisters form on
the bottoms of my feet, and I'm grow
ing rather chilly. The pace slows, and
we all tread carefully around the cow
pies that dot the road. The company,
however, is well worth the weather.
Nora introduces me to Maggie Kim
ball, the University Archivist, who tells
me that the last remaining building of
the Stanford estate is tragically
housed behind the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, across the street from the
Stanford Shopping Center.
We ascend a hill into Jasper Ridge,
a place that I've heard about but never
seen. Ille land preserve isn't open for
public visiting, and I've heard it's hard
to get into. Hie rumor is substantiated
by razor wire mounted above the
chain-link gate. Our docent. Bob
Dodge, tells us that over 1 (K) research
projects are currently in progress on
the Ridge, which is home to a number
of ecosystems that are representative
of the central California environment.
Dodge hands us each a list of the
plants growing in Jasper Ridge, and we
begin our walk through the preserve.
As we follow a barely-defined dirt
path. 1 begin to understand why it isn't
open for public visiting.The land is so
well protected and preserved that it
seems more valuable to keep it pris
tine than to open it up.
On the path. Dodge points out a
pair of California newts, adorable little
reddish-brown creatures who climb
around his hands and boots un
abashedly before ambling off together
like a married newt couple. Above the
path, tree branches slung with hanging
moss drip residual rainwater onto our
heads, and I am in awe of what Stan
ford has in its hands. We circle a lake
and come to a dam that holds the lake
water back from a three-story drop. A
civil and environmental engineering
professor appears magically on the
dam and informs us of its history as a
part of the California water supply.
Apparently, sediment is building up
behind the dam and necessitates the
draining of the lake, the destruction of
the dam or something equally mo
mentous. It seems strange that the
quiet preserve will have to be so dras
tically changed.
Joyously, our next stop is lunch,
which is hosted at a strangely angular,
windowed structure atop a peak in
Jasper Ridge. There, we meet a group
that includes President John Hen
nessy, some well-heeled donors, sus
tainability coordinators. Jasper Ridge

officials and others who have come to
observe us mid-trek, sweaty and
rained-on. Kennedy, by contrast.looks
crisp and clean as he bounds forward
to greet Jean and Bill Lane '42. Am
bassador Lane, sporting a red cowboy
hat, makes a quick speech about the
importance of Stanford's focus on cit
izenship, given its proximity to and in
volvement with members of the sur
rounding communities. I le encour
ages Stanford to remember that
"fences don't always make good
neighbors. Sometimes fences have to
be lowered."
Jean Lane, a delicate woman in out
doorsy clothes, also steps forward to
say a few words. A woman after my
own heart, she mentions the impor
tance of Jasper Ridge's Global Change
Experiment, a project begun in 1997 to
gauge the effects of climate change on
California!! environs. "We do know
that there is global climate change."
she asks."so what will we do?"
We sit down to our long-anticipat
ed lunch, which the Lanes have gener
ously funded. It is now about I:3o,and
we have been walking for seven hours.
1 pile a biodegradable (!) plate with
grilled salmon, fresh fruit, bread and
salad. The building's lab serves as a
dining room: tables have been brought
in,and the labcounters have been cov
ered with tablecloths. A catering staff
wanders incongruously through the
lab. clearing biodegradable plates and
refilling glasses as a history undergrad
plays country-western themes on a
classical guitar.
Once lunch is done, we leave the
assembled crowd behind and proceed
— a mere 13 of us — on the final leg of
our journey. We are accompanied,
brietiy. by Uennessy, who appears to
be in the same unnatural state of phys
ical fitness as Kennedy. Ilie two of
them bound ahead as 1 struggle to
keep up, eager to see our president in
action. Kennedy introduces me to
Uennessy as "the reporter," and I re
flect that there is perhaps no dirtier
label. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the
introduction. Uennessy and I shake
hands, and he asks my major. A double
in classics and English, i say. and he
asks why. I tell I iennessy it is because 1
want to read Shakespeare properly. 1
feel terribly conscious of the fact that
I'm talking to an ex-engineer.
A wandering Dalmatian inexplica
bly crosses our path, and Uennessy
coos at it. I feel a sudden wave of com
passion for our I Jniversity's president,
for whom life seems to contain far
more meet-and-greets than 1 could
ever stomach.
Kennedy tells us that "walking the
farm" (the catch phrase that he uses to
refer to our journey) is something he
learned about from his own Stanford
roommate, an lowa native who told
Kennedy about his family's annual rit
ual of walking the entire periphery of
their land to check for needed mainte
nance.
Given Stanford's moniker, it is em
inently appropriate to say that we are
"walking the Farm "as we examine the
extent of Stanford's outer boundaries,
checking up on the state of the Uni
versity and assessing what exactly is
under Stanford's purview. It is far
more than students.certainly, lliere is
the agricultural land, the nature pre
serve, the various tenants along whose
fences we have walked. I remark to
Kennedy and I lennessy that it seems
almost impossible to keep track of the
Stanford "community." if we are
thinking about all B.ISO acres.
Kennedy and I lennessy give me wise
looks that say "No." so I reconsider
and amend. It is complex, I say. but not
impossible.They heartily agree.
We need to cross a four-lane road
to continue, and 1 lennessy leads the
mad dash, ending up on the grassy
highway shoulder on the other side,
closely followed by Kennedy. It is re
freshing to see our intellectual giants
jaywalking. Ilie president leaves us
after another mile or so. but the 13 of
us continue, mostly along the sides of
paved roads, past housing develop
ments and into the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, where we see the old Stan
ford family carriage house that the

archivist Kimball mentioned, sitting
bravely behind a cluster of prefabri
cated apartments. As we stroll through
a public park. History Prof. Richard
White tells us about his course on na
t ure films, in which his students are an
alyzing "Bambi" as a commentary on
the state of the American family.
We enter the home stretch along El
Camino.and the sandstone gates draw
agonizingly close. Predictably,
Kennedy finishes first, looking barely
winded. 1 pass through the gates with
an aching lower back and tired feet,
but the walk is over and we are a qui
etly ecstatic group of 13. Reflecting on
the journey. Kennedy tells me, "The
land is a long-term resource, and it is in
the University's best interest to retain
it." And he is right. The land offers
Stanford a place in which to grow and
live,but it's alsoa lesson in the practice
and potential of sustainability.
Kennedy tells us that in addition to
being a maintenance check-up,"walk
ing the farm" is also something that
prospectors do before purchasing a
piece of land. 1 regret that I did not
"walk the Farm" during Admit Week
end,as a kind of grueling survey of the
territory I was about to purchase. I was
a tentative admit, and discovering the
breadth of Stanford's community
might have made the University more
appealing. But it is better late than
never, I think, to discover the extents
(both geographical and otherwise) of
the University I am pleased to hear
later that Kennedy hopes to make the
walk an annual event.
I feel a sense of proprietary pride as
we end our tour of Stanford's B.ISO
acres. Of walking the Farm, Kennedy
tells us, "This has reminded me again
and again of the Stanfords' idea of a
great Western university." It is an apt
summary of our odyssev.

The 23.5-mile hike was inspired by an idea from History Prof. David Kennedy '63 (center) and realized by the lo

for whom life seems to contain far
more meet-and-greets than 1 could
ever stomach.
Kennedy tells us that "walking the
farm" (the catch phrase that he uses to
refer to our journey) is something he
learned about from his own Stanford
roommate, an lowa native who told
Kennedy about his family's annual rit
ual of walking the entire periphery of
their land to check for needed mainte
nance.
Given Stanford's moniker, it is em
inently appropriate to say that we are
"walking the Farm "as we examine the
extent of Stanford's outer boundaries,
checking up on the state of the Uni
versity and assessing what exactly is
under Stanford's purview. It is far
more than students.certainly, lliere is
the agricultural land, the nature pre
serve, the various tenants along whose
fences we have walked. I remark to
Kennedy and I lennessy that it seems
almost impossible to keep track of the
Stanford "community." if we are
thinking about all B.ISO acres.
Kennedy and I lennessy give me wise
looks that say "No." so I reconsider
and amend. It is complex, I say. but not
impossible.They heartily agree.
We need to cross a four-lane road
to continue, and 1 lennessy leads the
mad dash, ending up on the grassy
highway shoulder on the other side,
closely followed by Kennedy. It is re
freshing to see our intellectual giants
jaywalking. Ilie president leaves us
after another mile or so. but the 13 of
us continue, mostly along the sides of
paved roads, past housing develop
ments and into the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, where we see the old Stan
ford family carriage house that the

archivist Kimball mentioned, sitting
bravely behind a cluster of prefabri
cated apartments. As we stroll through
a public park. History Prof. Richard
White tells us about his course on na
t ure films, in which his students are an
alyzing "Bambi" as a commentary on
the state of the American family.
We enter the home stretch along El
Camino.and the sandstone gates draw
agonizingly close. Predictably,
Kennedy finishes first, looking barely
winded. 1 pass through the gates with
an aching lower back and tired feet,
but the walk is over and we are a qui
etly ecstatic group of 13. Reflecting on
the journey. Kennedy tells me, "The
land is a long-term resource, and it is in
the University's best interest to retain
it." And he is right. The land offers
Stanford a place in which to grow and
live,but it's alsoa lesson in the practice
and potential of sustainability.
Kennedy tells us that in addition to
being a maintenance check-up,"walk
ing the farm" is also something that
prospectors do before purchasing a
piece of land. 1 regret that I did not
"walk the Farm" during Admit Week
end,as a kind of grueling survey of the
territory I was about to purchase. I was
a tentative admit, and discovering the
breadth of Stanford's community
might have made the University more
appealing. But it is better late than
never, I think, to discover the extents
(both geographical and otherwise) of
the University I am pleased to hear
later that Kennedy hopes to make the
walk an annual event.
I feel a sense of proprietary pride as
we end our tour of Stanford's B.ISO
acres. Of walking the Farm, Kennedy
tells us, "This has reminded me again
and again of the Stanfords' idea of a
great Western university." It is an apt
summary of our odyssev.

On their last legs, hikers stride along a public path adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek toward the end of a 23.5-mile trek around the perimeter of
the Stanford campus. About a dozen people made the full-day journey led by
History Prof. David Kennedy '63 on a rainy Saturday.
the campus.
We begin at dawn, or rather every
one else begins at dawn. The group
starts at the intersection of Palm Drive
and El Camino Real where large
sandstone gates mark the entrance to
the University. As the first rays of sun
light peek down from the heavens, the
group is heading east toward Gunn
High School, but 1 am lost in Escondi
do Village, winding my way through
bungalows and eucalyptus trees. As 1
search for the group. 1 worriedly chew
750 calories worth of Clif bars that I 've
stolen from my roommate. Slung over
my shoulder is a messenger bag that
contains everything I've been told to
bring: water, food and a raincoat. I
hope it will not rain.
1 join the group about 30 minutes
after they've begun. Walking down
Stanford Ave., the group looks like
what it is — a bunch of academics
(plus reporters) out for a walk.The at
tire is. fittingly, an odd mix of North
Face water-resistant pants, V-necked
sweaters, and thick-rimmed glasses, as
though Sherlock Holmes has dressed
up to climb Mount Everest. Wishing
that 1 had put on something herring
bone-patterned. 1 merge awkwardly
with the line of walkers and try to keep
up.
Jon Christensen '81 welcomes me
to the group. Christensen is a current
ly a history graduate student and a re
search fellow at the Center for Envi
ronmental Science and Policy It was
his winter quarter course "What Went
Down on the Farm: Stanford Campus
as a Laboratory for Environmental
History" that served as the inspiration
for this epic endeavor. Jon tells me
about the varied members of our
party, pointing out professors, re
porters and post-docs as the mouth
piece of his water-bottle-backpack -
hybrid sways lazily above his shoulder.
Jon introduces me to Peter Wright '08.
who took his class and has organized
many of the logistics of the walk. A
graduate of an outdoor survival
school. Peter is wearing a hat and
snazzy backpack and seems eminently
prepared. He and 1 are the only under
graduates on the walk.
As Kennedy strides by, the KQED
journalist riding in his wake. Jon
makes a quick introduction, and I'm
suddenly at Kennedy's side. Jon has
told me that Kennedy is a Pulitzer
prizewinner and now an acting mem
ber of the Pulitzer Prize Board. Just
the day before, the distinguished pro
fessor was in New York City making
the final decisions about this year's
prizes. I tag along next to Kennedy like
a lost, star-struck puppy, still in awe of
the fact that I am walking next to the
man who wrote my eighth-grade
American history textbook.
Kennedy's pace is fiercely aerobic,
and I have trouble keeping up, despite
the fact that he's 65 and has legs hard
ly longer than mine. He asks about my
major and my own writing interests,
and soon we're off on a discussion
about the theater. He and I agree on
several things: the state of modern
American drama (worrying). Tom
Stoppard's plays (more textbook than
dialogue) and "Anna in the Tropics"
(decent). We disagree, however, on
Alan Bennett's "The History Boys"
— I say it's profound, he says it's in
conclusive. I immediately reconsider.
Kennedy also mentions that he is lis
tening to lan McKellan reading
Robert Fagles' translation of the
"Odyssey" on tape. It's oddly fitting,as
we ourselves are on a sort of peripatet
ic odyssey. And perhaps Kennedy is
our brave Odysseus, although I'm not
sure about the hordes of suitors at
home.
The group rests for a moment at
some soccer fields that Stanford leases
to a nearby school, but it's only a few
minutes before Kennedy recom
mences the adventure,setting the pace
for our motley procession. The area is
charmingly suburban, and although
Stanford's ownership of the land is not
at all apparent. I know we're literally
walking the boundary of the Stanford
owned lands. Christensen tells me that
he has had to secure permission from
all of Stanford's tenants for us to walk
along the perimeter of the property,
which crosses roads and even High
way 280. He is enthused about the
walk.even now that he is experiencing
its painful reality. Ile tells me about
the Web site he is building to docu
ment the journey:
walkingthefarm.stanford.edu (acces
sible only to users with Stanford IDs).
We walk on sidewalks and highway
shoulders, discovering among other
things that Stanford owns a small vine
yard. We also skirt the periphery of the
Stanford Research Park,one of the in
dustrial parks that started off the Sili
con Valley boom. We leave the road
and start up into the foothills, which
look just like pristine ranch land, but
without the cows. There is no path
here, so we keep close to the barbed
wire fence that delineates the proper
ty boundary. Prying hard not to fall
sideways into the barbed wire. I shuf
fle through the long grass and weeds
that cover the hills. Ihe KOED re
porter strides beside me, holding the
microphone next to my feet to cap
ture, presumably, the sound of my as
cent. We reach the top of a hill and
look below us at Highway 280, which
looks no bigger than a stream winding
through the hills.To the east is the Bay,
and to the west is the Pacific, hardly

visible through the incoming rain
clouds. We descend, stopping periodi
cally to duck under barbed wire
fences. Kennedy's jacket is momentar
ily caught on a barb, and we all freeze,
but. he is freed and we continue.
The foothills are interrupted peri
odically by stretches of quiet road.
Hi ere is more ducking under fences,
filing through gates and getting stuck
in barbed wire. In one field, we see a
collection of well-fed goats, and
Kennedy stops. "This is where the Sa
tanic circle was." he observes calmly.
We accept this statement reverently.as
is appropriate for such a place. Hie
spot is indeed ideal for a Satanic circle;
it's well-shaded, and besides, there are
goats to sacrifice. 1 reflect momentari
ly on Stanford's rich history.
As we continue through the hills,
the barbed wire fence turns into a dirt
path, and the only marker of the Stan
ford land boundary is a ridge of trees
that Jon points out just before we pass
under 1 lighway 280 through a tunnel.
We learn from Jon's occasional com
mentary that between the Research
Park and Jasper Ridge lie the Stan
ford-owned polo grounds, in addition
to a number of areas that are leased by
tenants such the Webb Ranch, which
grows organic produce and runs a sta
ble. As we walk through the Ranch, 1
am introduced to a history post-doc
and her husband, a visiting professor
from Florida, two grad students and
others, including Nora Sweeny, a
charming alum and University admin
istrator with whom I share English de
partment gossip.
Just as we're starting through the
Webb Ranch, a downpour begins. My
ill-chosen cotton pants are soaked, as
are my running shoes. Blisters form on
the bottoms of my feet, and I'm grow
ing rather chilly. The pace slows, and
we all tread carefully around the cow
pies that dot the road. The company,
however, is well worth the weather.
Nora introduces me to Maggie Kim
ball, the University Archivist, who tells
me that the last remaining building of
the Stanford estate is tragically
housed behind the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, across the street from the
Stanford Shopping Center.
We ascend a hill into Jasper Ridge,
a place that I've heard about but never
seen. Ille land preserve isn't open for
public visiting, and I've heard it's hard
to get into. Hie rumor is substantiated
by razor wire mounted above the
chain-link gate. Our docent. Bob
Dodge, tells us that over 1 (K) research
projects are currently in progress on
the Ridge, which is home to a number
of ecosystems that are representative
of the central California environment.
Dodge hands us each a list of the
plants growing in Jasper Ridge, and we
begin our walk through the preserve.
As we follow a barely-defined dirt
path. 1 begin to understand why it isn't
open for public visiting.The land is so
well protected and preserved that it
seems more valuable to keep it pris
tine than to open it up.
On the path. Dodge points out a
pair of California newts, adorable little
reddish-brown creatures who climb
around his hands and boots un
abashedly before ambling off together
like a married newt couple. Above the
path, tree branches slung with hanging
moss drip residual rainwater onto our
heads, and I am in awe of what Stan
ford has in its hands. We circle a lake
and come to a dam that holds the lake
water back from a three-story drop. A
civil and environmental engineering
professor appears magically on the
dam and informs us of its history as a
part of the California water supply.
Apparently, sediment is building up
behind the dam and necessitates the
draining of the lake, the destruction of
the dam or something equally mo
mentous. It seems strange that the
quiet preserve will have to be so dras
tically changed.
Joyously, our next stop is lunch,
which is hosted at a strangely angular,
windowed structure atop a peak in
Jasper Ridge. There, we meet a group
that includes President John Hen
nessy, some well-heeled donors, sus
tainability coordinators. Jasper Ridge

officials and others who have come to
observe us mid-trek, sweaty and
rained-on. Kennedy, by contrast.looks
crisp and clean as he bounds forward
to greet Jean and Bill Lane '42. Am
bassador Lane, sporting a red cowboy
hat, makes a quick speech about the
importance of Stanford's focus on cit
izenship, given its proximity to and in
volvement with members of the sur
rounding communities. I le encour
ages Stanford to remember that
"fences don't always make good
neighbors. Sometimes fences have to
be lowered."
Jean Lane, a delicate woman in out
doorsy clothes, also steps forward to
say a few words. A woman after my
own heart, she mentions the impor
tance of Jasper Ridge's Global Change
Experiment, a project begun in 1997 to
gauge the effects of climate change on
California!! environs. "We do know
that there is global climate change."
she asks."so what will we do?"
We sit down to our long-anticipat
ed lunch, which the Lanes have gener
ously funded. It is now about I:3o,and
we have been walking for seven hours.
1 pile a biodegradable (!) plate with
grilled salmon, fresh fruit, bread and
salad. The building's lab serves as a
dining room: tables have been brought
in,and the labcounters have been cov
ered with tablecloths. A catering staff
wanders incongruously through the
lab. clearing biodegradable plates and
refilling glasses as a history undergrad
plays country-western themes on a
classical guitar.
Once lunch is done, we leave the
assembled crowd behind and proceed
— a mere 13 of us — on the final leg of
our journey. We are accompanied,
brietiy. by Uennessy, who appears to
be in the same unnatural state of phys
ical fitness as Kennedy. Ilie two of
them bound ahead as 1 struggle to
keep up, eager to see our president in
action. Kennedy introduces me to
Uennessy as "the reporter," and I re
flect that there is perhaps no dirtier
label. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the
introduction. Uennessy and I shake
hands, and he asks my major. A double
in classics and English, i say. and he
asks why. I tell I iennessy it is because 1
want to read Shakespeare properly. 1
feel terribly conscious of the fact that
I'm talking to an ex-engineer.
A wandering Dalmatian inexplica
bly crosses our path, and Uennessy
coos at it. I feel a sudden wave of com
passion for our I Jniversity's president,
for whom life seems to contain far
more meet-and-greets than 1 could
ever stomach.

path. 1 begin to understand why it isn't
open for public visiting.The land is so
well protected and preserved that it
seems more valuable to keep it pris
tine than to open it up.
On the path. Dodge points out a
pair of California newts, adorable little
reddish-brown creatures who climb
around his hands and boots un
abashedly before ambling off together
like a married newt couple. Above the
path, tree branches slung with hanging
moss drip residual rainwater onto our
heads, and I am in awe of what Stan
ford has in its hands. We circle a lake
and come to a dam that holds the lake
water back from a three-story drop. A
civil and environmental engineering
professor appears magically on the
dam and informs us of its history as a
part of the California water supply.
Apparently, sediment is building up
behind the dam and necessitates the
draining of the lake, the destruction of
the dam or something equally mo
mentous. It seems strange that the
quiet preserve will have to be so dras
tically changed.
Joyously, our next stop is lunch,
which is hosted at a strangely angular,
windowed structure atop a peak in
Jasper Ridge. There, we meet a group
that includes President John Hen
nessy, some well-heeled donors, sus
tainability coordinators. Jasper Ridge

officials and others who have come to
observe us mid-trek, sweaty and
rained-on. Kennedy, by contrast.looks
crisp and clean as he bounds forward
to greet Jean and Bill Lane '42. Am
bassador Lane, sporting a red cowboy
hat, makes a quick speech about the
importance of Stanford's focus on cit
izenship, given its proximity to and in
volvement with members of the sur
rounding communities. I le encour
ages Stanford to remember that
"fences don't always make good
neighbors. Sometimes fences have to
be lowered."
Jean Lane, a delicate woman in out
doorsy clothes, also steps forward to
say a few words. A woman after my
own heart, she mentions the impor
tance of Jasper Ridge's Global Change
Experiment, a project begun in 1997 to
gauge the effects of climate change on
California!! environs. "We do know
that there is global climate change."
she asks."so what will we do?"
We sit down to our long-anticipat
ed lunch, which the Lanes have gener
ously funded. It is now about I:3o,and
we have been walking for seven hours.
1 pile a biodegradable (!) plate with
grilled salmon, fresh fruit, bread and
salad. The building's lab serves as a
dining room: tables have been brought
in,and the labcounters have been cov
ered with tablecloths. A catering staff
wanders incongruously through the
lab. clearing biodegradable plates and
refilling glasses as a history undergrad
plays country-western themes on a
classical guitar.
Once lunch is done, we leave the
assembled crowd behind and proceed
— a mere 13 of us — on the final leg of
our journey. We are accompanied,
brietiy. by Uennessy, who appears to
be in the same unnatural state of phys
ical fitness as Kennedy. Ilie two of
them bound ahead as 1 struggle to
keep up, eager to see our president in
action. Kennedy introduces me to
Uennessy as "the reporter," and I re
flect that there is perhaps no dirtier
label. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the
introduction. Uennessy and I shake
hands, and he asks my major. A double
in classics and English, i say. and he
asks why. I tell I iennessy it is because 1
want to read Shakespeare properly. 1
feel terribly conscious of the fact that
I'm talking to an ex-engineer.
A wandering Dalmatian inexplica
bly crosses our path, and Uennessy
coos at it. I feel a sudden wave of com
passion for our I Jniversity's president,
for whom life seems to contain far
more meet-and-greets than 1 could
ever stomach.
Kennedy tells us that "walking the
farm" (the catch phrase that he uses to
refer to our journey) is something he
learned about from his own Stanford
roommate, an lowa native who told
Kennedy about his family's annual rit
ual of walking the entire periphery of
their land to check for needed mainte
nance.
Given Stanford's moniker, it is em
inently appropriate to say that we are
"walking the Farm "as we examine the
extent of Stanford's outer boundaries,
checking up on the state of the Uni
versity and assessing what exactly is
under Stanford's purview. It is far
more than students.certainly, lliere is
the agricultural land, the nature pre
serve, the various tenants along whose
fences we have walked. I remark to
Kennedy and I lennessy that it seems
almost impossible to keep track of the
Stanford "community." if we are
thinking about all B.ISO acres.
Kennedy and I lennessy give me wise
looks that say "No." so I reconsider
and amend. It is complex, I say. but not
impossible.They heartily agree.
We need to cross a four-lane road
to continue, and 1 lennessy leads the
mad dash, ending up on the grassy
highway shoulder on the other side,
closely followed by Kennedy. It is re
freshing to see our intellectual giants
jaywalking. Ilie president leaves us
after another mile or so. but the 13 of
us continue, mostly along the sides of
paved roads, past housing develop
ments and into the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, where we see the old Stan
ford family carriage house that the

archivist Kimball mentioned, sitting
bravely behind a cluster of prefabri
cated apartments. As we stroll through
a public park. History Prof. Richard
White tells us about his course on na
t ure films, in which his students are an
alyzing "Bambi" as a commentary on
the state of the American family.
We enter the home stretch along El
Camino.and the sandstone gates draw
agonizingly close. Predictably,
Kennedy finishes first, looking barely
winded. 1 pass through the gates with
an aching lower back and tired feet,
but the walk is over and we are a qui
etly ecstatic group of 13. Reflecting on
the journey. Kennedy tells me, "The
land is a long-term resource, and it is in
the University's best interest to retain
it." And he is right. The land offers
Stanford a place in which to grow and
live,but it's alsoa lesson in the practice
and potential of sustainability.
Kennedy tells us that in addition to
being a maintenance check-up,"walk
ing the farm" is also something that
prospectors do before purchasing a
piece of land. 1 regret that I did not
"walk the Farm" during Admit Week
end,as a kind of grueling survey of the
territory I was about to purchase. I was
a tentative admit, and discovering the
breadth of Stanford's community
might have made the University more
appealing. But it is better late than
never, I think, to discover the extents
(both geographical and otherwise) of
the University I am pleased to hear
later that Kennedy hopes to make the
walk an annual event.
I feel a sense of proprietary pride as
we end our tour of Stanford's B.ISO
acres. Of walking the Farm, Kennedy
tells us, "This has reminded me again
and again of the Stanfords' idea of a
great Western university." It is an apt
summary of our odyssev.

On their last legs, hikers stride along a public path adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek toward the end of a 23.5-mile trek around the perimeter of
the Stanford campus. About a dozen people made the full-day journey led by
History Prof. David Kennedy '63 on a rainy Saturday.
the campus.
We begin at dawn, or rather every
one else begins at dawn. The group
starts at the intersection of Palm Drive
and El Camino Real where large
sandstone gates mark the entrance to
the University. As the first rays of sun
light peek down from the heavens, the
group is heading east toward Gunn
High School, but 1 am lost in Escondi
do Village, winding my way through
bungalows and eucalyptus trees. As 1
search for the group. 1 worriedly chew
750 calories worth of Clif bars that I 've
stolen from my roommate. Slung over
my shoulder is a messenger bag that
contains everything I've been told to
bring: water, food and a raincoat. I
hope it will not rain.
1 join the group about 30 minutes
after they've begun. Walking down
Stanford Ave., the group looks like
what it is — a bunch of academics
(plus reporters) out for a walk.The at
tire is. fittingly, an odd mix of North
Face water-resistant pants, V-necked
sweaters, and thick-rimmed glasses, as
though Sherlock Holmes has dressed
up to climb Mount Everest. Wishing
that 1 had put on something herring
bone-patterned. 1 merge awkwardly
with the line of walkers and try to keep
up.
Jon Christensen '81 welcomes me
to the group. Christensen is a current
ly a history graduate student and a re
search fellow at the Center for Envi
ronmental Science and Policy It was
his winter quarter course "What Went
Down on the Farm: Stanford Campus
as a Laboratory for Environmental
History" that served as the inspiration
for this epic endeavor. Jon tells me
about the varied members of our
party, pointing out professors, re
porters and post-docs as the mouth
piece of his water-bottle-backpack -
hybrid sways lazily above his shoulder.
Jon introduces me to Peter Wright '08.
who took his class and has organized
many of the logistics of the walk. A
graduate of an outdoor survival
school. Peter is wearing a hat and
snazzy backpack and seems eminently
prepared. He and 1 are the only under
graduates on the walk.
As Kennedy strides by, the KQED
journalist riding in his wake. Jon
makes a quick introduction, and I'm
suddenly at Kennedy's side. Jon has
told me that Kennedy is a Pulitzer
prizewinner and now an acting mem
ber of the Pulitzer Prize Board. Just
the day before, the distinguished pro
fessor was in New York City making
the final decisions about this year's
prizes. I tag along next to Kennedy like
a lost, star-struck puppy, still in awe of
the fact that I am walking next to the
man who wrote my eighth-grade
American history textbook.
Kennedy's pace is fiercely aerobic,
and I have trouble keeping up, despite
the fact that he's 65 and has legs hard
ly longer than mine. He asks about my
major and my own writing interests,
and soon we're off on a discussion
about the theater. He and I agree on
several things: the state of modern
American drama (worrying). Tom
Stoppard's plays (more textbook than
dialogue) and "Anna in the Tropics"
(decent). We disagree, however, on
Alan Bennett's "The History Boys"
— I say it's profound, he says it's in
conclusive. I immediately reconsider.
Kennedy also mentions that he is lis
tening to lan McKellan reading
Robert Fagles' translation of the
"Odyssey" on tape. It's oddly fitting,as
we ourselves are on a sort of peripatet
ic odyssey. And perhaps Kennedy is
our brave Odysseus, although I'm not
sure about the hordes of suitors at
home.
The group rests for a moment at
some soccer fields that Stanford leases
to a nearby school, but it's only a few
minutes before Kennedy recom
mences the adventure,setting the pace
for our motley procession. The area is
charmingly suburban, and although
Stanford's ownership of the land is not
at all apparent. I know we're literally
walking the boundary of the Stanford
owned lands. Christensen tells me that
he has had to secure permission from
all of Stanford's tenants for us to walk
along the perimeter of the property,
which crosses roads and even High
way 280. He is enthused about the
walk.even now that he is experiencing
its painful reality. Ile tells me about
the Web site he is building to docu
ment the journey:
walkingthefarm.stanford.edu (acces
sible only to users with Stanford IDs).
We walk on sidewalks and highway
shoulders, discovering among other
things that Stanford owns a small vine
yard. We also skirt the periphery of the
Stanford Research Park,one of the in
dustrial parks that started off the Sili
con Valley boom. We leave the road
and start up into the foothills, which
look just like pristine ranch land, but
without the cows. There is no path
here, so we keep close to the barbed
wire fence that delineates the proper
ty boundary. Prying hard not to fall
sideways into the barbed wire. I shuf
fle through the long grass and weeds
that cover the hills. Ihe KOED re
porter strides beside me, holding the
microphone next to my feet to cap
ture, presumably, the sound of my as
cent. We reach the top of a hill and
look below us at Highway 280, which
looks no bigger than a stream winding
through the hills.To the east is the Bay,
and to the west is the Pacific, hardly

visible through the incoming rain
clouds. We descend, stopping periodi
cally to duck under barbed wire
fences. Kennedy's jacket is momentar
ily caught on a barb, and we all freeze,
but. he is freed and we continue.
The foothills are interrupted peri
odically by stretches of quiet road.
Hi ere is more ducking under fences,
filing through gates and getting stuck
in barbed wire. In one field, we see a
collection of well-fed goats, and
Kennedy stops. "This is where the Sa
tanic circle was." he observes calmly.
We accept this statement reverently.as
is appropriate for such a place. Hie
spot is indeed ideal for a Satanic circle;
it's well-shaded, and besides, there are
goats to sacrifice. 1 reflect momentari
ly on Stanford's rich history.
As we continue through the hills,
the barbed wire fence turns into a dirt
path, and the only marker of the Stan
ford land boundary is a ridge of trees
that Jon points out just before we pass
under 1 lighway 280 through a tunnel.
We learn from Jon's occasional com
mentary that between the Research
Park and Jasper Ridge lie the Stan
ford-owned polo grounds, in addition
to a number of areas that are leased by
tenants such the Webb Ranch, which
grows organic produce and runs a sta
ble. As we walk through the Ranch, 1
am introduced to a history post-doc
and her husband, a visiting professor
from Florida, two grad students and
others, including Nora Sweeny, a
charming alum and University admin
istrator with whom I share English de
partment gossip.
Just as we're starting through the
Webb Ranch, a downpour begins. My
ill-chosen cotton pants are soaked, as
are my running shoes. Blisters form on
the bottoms of my feet, and I'm grow
ing rather chilly. The pace slows, and
we all tread carefully around the cow
pies that dot the road. The company,
however, is well worth the weather.
Nora introduces me to Maggie Kim
ball, the University Archivist, who tells
me that the last remaining building of
the Stanford estate is tragically
housed behind the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, across the street from the
Stanford Shopping Center.
We ascend a hill into Jasper Ridge,
a place that I've heard about but never
seen. Ille land preserve isn't open for
public visiting, and I've heard it's hard
to get into. Hie rumor is substantiated
by razor wire mounted above the
chain-link gate. Our docent. Bob
Dodge, tells us that over 1 (K) research
projects are currently in progress on
the Ridge, which is home to a number
of ecosystems that are representative
of the central California environment.
Dodge hands us each a list of the
plants growing in Jasper Ridge, and we
begin our walk through the preserve.
As we follow a barely-defined dirt
path. 1 begin to understand why it isn't
open for public visiting.The land is so
well protected and preserved that it
seems more valuable to keep it pris
tine than to open it up.
On the path. Dodge points out a
pair of California newts, adorable little
reddish-brown creatures who climb
around his hands and boots un
abashedly before ambling off together
like a married newt couple. Above the
path, tree branches slung with hanging
moss drip residual rainwater onto our
heads, and I am in awe of what Stan
ford has in its hands. We circle a lake
and come to a dam that holds the lake
water back from a three-story drop. A

sible only to users with Stanford IDs).
We walk on sidewalks and highway
shoulders, discovering among other
things that Stanford owns a small vine
yard. We also skirt the periphery of the
Stanford Research Park,one of the in
dustrial parks that started off the Sili
con Valley boom. We leave the road
and start up into the foothills, which
look just like pristine ranch land, but
without the cows. There is no path
here, so we keep close to the barbed
wire fence that delineates the proper
ty boundary. Prying hard not to fall
sideways into the barbed wire. I shuf
fle through the long grass and weeds
that cover the hills. Ihe KOED re
porter strides beside me, holding the
microphone next to my feet to cap
ture, presumably, the sound of my as
cent. We reach the top of a hill and
look below us at Highway 280, which
looks no bigger than a stream winding
through the hills.To the east is the Bay,
and to the west is the Pacific, hardly

visible through the incoming rain
clouds. We descend, stopping periodi
cally to duck under barbed wire
fences. Kennedy's jacket is momentar
ily caught on a barb, and we all freeze,
but. he is freed and we continue.
The foothills are interrupted peri
odically by stretches of quiet road.
Hi ere is more ducking under fences,
filing through gates and getting stuck
in barbed wire. In one field, we see a
collection of well-fed goats, and
Kennedy stops. "This is where the Sa
tanic circle was." he observes calmly.
We accept this statement reverently.as
is appropriate for such a place. Hie
spot is indeed ideal for a Satanic circle;
it's well-shaded, and besides, there are
goats to sacrifice. 1 reflect momentari
ly on Stanford's rich history.
As we continue through the hills,
the barbed wire fence turns into a dirt
path, and the only marker of the Stan
ford land boundary is a ridge of trees
that Jon points out just before we pass
under 1 lighway 280 through a tunnel.
We learn from Jon's occasional com
mentary that between the Research
Park and Jasper Ridge lie the Stan
ford-owned polo grounds, in addition
to a number of areas that are leased by
tenants such the Webb Ranch, which
grows organic produce and runs a sta
ble. As we walk through the Ranch, 1
am introduced to a history post-doc
and her husband, a visiting professor
from Florida, two grad students and
others, including Nora Sweeny, a
charming alum and University admin
istrator with whom I share English de
partment gossip.
Just as we're starting through the
Webb Ranch, a downpour begins. My
ill-chosen cotton pants are soaked, as
are my running shoes. Blisters form on
the bottoms of my feet, and I'm grow
ing rather chilly. The pace slows, and
we all tread carefully around the cow
pies that dot the road. The company,
however, is well worth the weather.
Nora introduces me to Maggie Kim
ball, the University Archivist, who tells
me that the last remaining building of
the Stanford estate is tragically
housed behind the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, across the street from the
Stanford Shopping Center.
We ascend a hill into Jasper Ridge,
a place that I've heard about but never
seen. Ille land preserve isn't open for
public visiting, and I've heard it's hard
to get into. Hie rumor is substantiated
by razor wire mounted above the
chain-link gate. Our docent. Bob
Dodge, tells us that over 1 (K) research
projects are currently in progress on
the Ridge, which is home to a number
of ecosystems that are representative
of the central California environment.
Dodge hands us each a list of the
plants growing in Jasper Ridge, and we
begin our walk through the preserve.
As we follow a barely-defined dirt
path. 1 begin to understand why it isn't
open for public visiting.The land is so
well protected and preserved that it
seems more valuable to keep it pris
tine than to open it up.
On the path. Dodge points out a
pair of California newts, adorable little
reddish-brown creatures who climb
around his hands and boots un
abashedly before ambling off together
like a married newt couple. Above the
path, tree branches slung with hanging
moss drip residual rainwater onto our
heads, and I am in awe of what Stan
ford has in its hands. We circle a lake
and come to a dam that holds the lake
water back from a three-story drop. A
civil and environmental engineering
professor appears magically on the
dam and informs us of its history as a
part of the California water supply.
Apparently, sediment is building up
behind the dam and necessitates the
draining of the lake, the destruction of
the dam or something equally mo
mentous. It seems strange that the
quiet preserve will have to be so dras
tically changed.
Joyously, our next stop is lunch,
which is hosted at a strangely angular,
windowed structure atop a peak in
Jasper Ridge. There, we meet a group
that includes President John Hen
nessy, some well-heeled donors, sus
tainability coordinators. Jasper Ridge

officials and others who have come to
observe us mid-trek, sweaty and
rained-on. Kennedy, by contrast.looks
crisp and clean as he bounds forward
to greet Jean and Bill Lane '42. Am
bassador Lane, sporting a red cowboy
hat, makes a quick speech about the
importance of Stanford's focus on cit
izenship, given its proximity to and in
volvement with members of the sur
rounding communities. I le encour
ages Stanford to remember that
"fences don't always make good
neighbors. Sometimes fences have to
be lowered."
Jean Lane, a delicate woman in out
doorsy clothes, also steps forward to
say a few words. A woman after my
own heart, she mentions the impor
tance of Jasper Ridge's Global Change
Experiment, a project begun in 1997 to
gauge the effects of climate change on
California!! environs. "We do know
that there is global climate change."
she asks."so what will we do?"
We sit down to our long-anticipat
ed lunch, which the Lanes have gener
ously funded. It is now about I:3o,and
we have been walking for seven hours.
1 pile a biodegradable (!) plate with
grilled salmon, fresh fruit, bread and
salad. The building's lab serves as a
dining room: tables have been brought
in,and the labcounters have been cov
ered with tablecloths. A catering staff
wanders incongruously through the
lab. clearing biodegradable plates and
refilling glasses as a history undergrad
plays country-western themes on a
classical guitar.
Once lunch is done, we leave the
assembled crowd behind and proceed
— a mere 13 of us — on the final leg of
our journey. We are accompanied,
brietiy. by Uennessy, who appears to
be in the same unnatural state of phys
ical fitness as Kennedy. Ilie two of
them bound ahead as 1 struggle to
keep up, eager to see our president in
action. Kennedy introduces me to
Uennessy as "the reporter," and I re
flect that there is perhaps no dirtier
label. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the
introduction. Uennessy and I shake
hands, and he asks my major. A double
in classics and English, i say. and he
asks why. I tell I iennessy it is because 1
want to read Shakespeare properly. 1
feel terribly conscious of the fact that
I'm talking to an ex-engineer.
A wandering Dalmatian inexplica
bly crosses our path, and Uennessy
coos at it. I feel a sudden wave of com
passion for our I Jniversity's president,
for whom life seems to contain far
more meet-and-greets than 1 could
ever stomach.
Kennedy tells us that "walking the
farm" (the catch phrase that he uses to
refer to our journey) is something he
learned about from his own Stanford
roommate, an lowa native who told
Kennedy about his family's annual rit
ual of walking the entire periphery of
their land to check for needed mainte
nance.
Given Stanford's moniker, it is em
inently appropriate to say that we are
"walking the Farm "as we examine the
extent of Stanford's outer boundaries,
checking up on the state of the Uni
versity and assessing what exactly is
under Stanford's purview. It is far
more than students.certainly, lliere is
the agricultural land, the nature pre
serve, the various tenants along whose
fences we have walked. I remark to
Kennedy and I lennessy that it seems
almost impossible to keep track of the
Stanford "community." if we are
thinking about all B.ISO acres.
Kennedy and I lennessy give me wise
looks that say "No." so I reconsider
and amend. It is complex, I say. but not
impossible.They heartily agree.
We need to cross a four-lane road
to continue, and 1 lennessy leads the
mad dash, ending up on the grassy
highway shoulder on the other side,
closely followed by Kennedy. It is re
freshing to see our intellectual giants
jaywalking. Ilie president leaves us
after another mile or so. but the 13 of
us continue, mostly along the sides of
paved roads, past housing develop
ments and into the Classic Residence
by Hyatt, where we see the old Stan
ford family carriage house that the

archivist Kimball mentioned, sitting
bravely behind a cluster of prefabri
cated apartments. As we stroll through
a public park. History Prof. Richard
White tells us about his course on na
t ure films, in which his students are an
alyzing "Bambi" as a commentary on
the state of the American family.
We enter the home stretch along El
Camino.and the sandstone gates draw
agonizingly close. Predictably,
Kennedy finishes first, looking barely
winded. 1 pass through the gates with
an aching lower back and tired feet,
but the walk is over and we are a qui
etly ecstatic group of 13. Reflecting on
the journey. Kennedy tells me, "The
land is a long-term resource, and it is in
the University's best interest to retain
it." And he is right. The land offers
Stanford a place in which to grow and
live,but it's alsoa lesson in the practice
and potential of sustainability.
Kennedy tells us that in addition to
being a maintenance check-up,"walk
ing the farm" is also something that
prospectors do before purchasing a
piece of land. 1 regret that I did not
"walk the Farm" during Admit Week
end,as a kind of grueling survey of the
territory I was about to purchase. I was
a tentative admit, and discovering the
breadth of Stanford's community
might have made the University more
appealing. But it is better late than
never, I think, to discover the extents
(both geographical and otherwise) of
the University I am pleased to hear
later that Kennedy hopes to make the
walk an annual event.
I feel a sense of proprietary pride as
we end our tour of Stanford's B.ISO
acres. Of walking the Farm, Kennedy
tells us, "This has reminded me again
and again of the Stanfords' idea of a
great Western university." It is an apt
summary of our odyssev.

The 23.5-mile hike was inspired by an idea from History Prof. David Kennedy '63 (center) and realized by the lo
gistical work of Ph.D. student Jon Christensen (left) and history major Peter Wright '08 (right). Kennedy said he
hoped to make the walk around the perimeter of campus an annual event.
