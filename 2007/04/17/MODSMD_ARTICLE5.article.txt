BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) - A
gunman massacred 32 people at
Virginia Tech in the deadliest
shooting rampage in modern I J.S.
history Monday, cutting down Ins
victims in two attacks two hours
apart before the university could
grasp what was happening and
warn students.
lTie bloodbath ended with the
gunman committing suicide, bring
ing the death toll to 33 and stamp
ing the campus in the picturesque
Blue Ridge Mountains with un
speakable tragedy.perhaps forever.
Investigators gave no motive
for the attack. I he gunman's name
was not immediately released, and
it was not known whether he was a
student.
"Today the university was
struck with a tragedy that we con
sider of monumental proportions."

Virginia Tech President Charles
Stegcr said. 'The university is
shocked and indeed horrified."
Rut he was also faced with diffi
cult questions about the universi
ty's handling of the emergency and
whether it did enough to warn stu
dents and protect them after the
first hurst of gunfire. Some stu
dents bitterly complained they got
mi warning from the university
until an e-mail that arrived more
than two hours after the first shots
rang out.
Wielding two handguns and
earn ing multiple clips of ammuni
tion. the killer opened fire about
7:15 a.m. on the fourth floor of
West Ambler Johnston, a high-rise
coed dormitory, then stormed Nor
ris Mali, a classroom building a
hall mile away on the other si tic of
the 2,6(K)-acre campus. Sonic of the
doors at Norris Mali were found
chained from the inside, apparent
ly by the gunman.
