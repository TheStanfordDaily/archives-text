## Visitor touts improved options for wind energy Despite risks, prof, optimistic for future 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Niek Jenkins, an engineering
professor from the University ol
Manchester and a member ol I â–  ng
land's Royal Academy of I ngi
neering. spoke yesterday about the
heat and electricity-producing ca
pabilities of wind power.
In order for wind power to be
come a viable energy alternative.
Jenkins stressed the necessity of
governmental support in making
the new technology more cost cf

fective. Mut even with the right leg
islation. engineers and energy de
velopers are still charged with the
task of developing wind energy
that works.
"Appropriate policies for the
electrical power system will not. on
their own. stimulate (renewable
energy)." Jenkins said, "but poor
policies can impede development."
Despite the risks involved with
the advancement of wind energy.
Jenkins' colleagues remain opti
mistic about the potential of the
new technology to decrease de
pendence on fossil fuels.
"The sky's the limit in a
sense." said I nvironinental Hn
gineering Prof. Gil Masters. "In
stalled capacity is growing 30 to 40
percent per year. Intermittency is
sues have the potential to be re
solved."
Jenkins cited regulations on the
energy sector and governmental
cooperation as the two most im
portant developments in making
wind energy a more affordable
and practical source of energy.

The guest lecturer also said he
believes that the popularity of
wind energy will increase as peo
ple all over the globe become
more environmentally conscious.
Civil Engineering Prof. Russell
Clough said he hoped Jenkins* lec
ture would raise awareness on
campus about the potential of al
ternative energy options.
"|1 hope this lecture will] edu
cate the people here about the op
portunities (of wind energy]." he
said, "and how important it is."
