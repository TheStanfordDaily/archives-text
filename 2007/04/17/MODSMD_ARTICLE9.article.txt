## Three-time world champ puts unicycling career on hold 
### MARISSA MILLER 
Stanford students arc known for their skill on two
wheels: By spring quarter, the typical freshman considers
hiking through the intersection of death — cell phone in
one hand, coffee in the other — an easy task
At the I rosli Talent Show, however, students in a
packed Krcsge Auditorium watched in awe as cyclist
Ryan Wocssner '10 took the stage. Wocssncr walked on
the treads of a wheel's tire: he spun circles with his entire
body off to one side; and then he rode with only his
hands.
But the best part? I le did it all on one wheel.
Woessncr's unicyeling performance took first place in
the talent show. I le walked away with the gold medal, full
bragging rights and the respect of every cell-phone jug
gling cyclist in the room.
Wocssner, who holds eight world titles in unicycling,
stumbled across the sport in sixth grade. A friend began
attending classes at a nearby gym and convinced him to
conic along. At first. Wocssner remained deeply skepti
cal.
"I was like,'l Jm... isn't that a sport for circus clow ns?'"
said Wocssner."l went to a practice, though, and at my
first one, I was able to get on the unicycle and ride across
the gym."
Wocssner, who hails from Minnesota, learned to ride
at Minnesota's Twin Cities IJnicycle Club, one of the
largest and most prestigious unicycling clubs in the na
tion. Iltough there are several types ot unicycling — in
cluding racing, mountain ("Muni") and street — the
Twin Cities club focuses exclusively on freestyle.
"I like to compare it to figure skating." Wocssner said.
"It's a four-minute routine choreographed to music,
where you perform a series of trieks before judges."
Competitors craft a routine around tricks that range
from any of 10 skill levels. In order to achieve a certain
skill level, cyclists must execute a number of difficult
moves.
"Tor level one, you have to get on a unicycle by your
self. ride around the gym, and dismount gracefully with
the seat in front,"said Wocssner."By level ten.you're fac
ing ten mounts of all different kinds of st\ les."
Within one year. Wocssner had passed the first eight
levels of freestyle unicycling: after his second, he had

completed all 10. At age 13. he was the youngest person
to pass all levels in the International IJnicyeling Federa
tion — and he had done it in record time.
" The quickest person before me — it took her over
live years to p;iss." admitted Woessner with a sheepish
grin.
In 2000. at the world championships in Beijing, he won
Junior Male !• xpert in freestyling. Kntering the seventh
grade. Woessner's professional career was poised to
begin — with puberty following dose behind.
" Hie second year I was unicycling, I met a girl." said
Woessner.
11 er name was Amy Shields, and she was a unicyclist,
too. Alter meeting at a'l win ('ities practice, the two decid
ed to work on a freestyle routine together.'The next year,
thev took home the World Artistic Pairs Junior Hxpert
title.
Ultimately, the two became more than unicycling
partners.
" lliree years into it. we started to go out and date, and
when we did. that was when our routine really started to
take oil." Woessner said."ln 2004. we won our first [adult]
pairs world title. ITic routine was flawless."
Ibis past summer — after racking up three more
world titles— Woessner was elected a director of the
1 'nicvcling Society of America. But despite these
achievements, he plans to put his unicycling career on
hold while at Stanford.
"'l"his summer. I'll be helping out at club practices,
working with people, seeing how their routines are com
ing together, giving them tips, and trying to teach them
new skills." said Woessner. "Also, I'll be judging at the
competitions. Its a lot of fun just to watch what people
can do."
Still, the opportunity to perform for his peers was irre
sistible.
"I decided that I'd try out for the freshman talent
show, so I put together a routine-kind of last minute,"said
Woessner."'l here was a lot of incredible talent, but I went
out there, had a great routine and ended up coming away
with the victory."
