## Model UN team triumphs anew 
### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After several years of lackluster performances, Stan
ford's Model United Nations (MUN) team performed
admirably at last weekend's University of Chicago con
ference, where the squad won the award for Outstanding
Large Delegation.
Nine of the team's l(i members received recognition,
and three students — Josh Dell '08, James Vaughan '09
and Marcus Williams '09 — were honored as the best
delegates in their committees.
Fhe team finished second overall, behind Harvard,
and achieved a level of success far beyond recent years.
Vaughan. the team's co-director, attributed the
team's recent progress to a change in attitude.
" Ihe team began the year disunited, unskilled and ideal
istic, but it finishes the year a group of terrific friends
convinced that debating fake French policy isn't nerdy,"
he said."ln years past the team did not make that transi
tion and it consequently did not succeed."
With its new leadership core, the team placed well at
three conferences this year, winning honors at both the
University of Pennsylvania's fall con
ference and I larvard's winter confer
ence in addition to the recent Chica
go convention.
Co-Director Boris Hanin '09
echoed Vaughan's sentiments and
suggested that the team's enthusiasm
this year separated it from previous
squads. I lanin also attributed the suc
cess to weekly practices, during
which team members simulate policy
discussions and United Nations
Committee meetings.
According to its leaders, the MUN
team also plays a role in the Stanford
community at large. Through a part
nership with the Students for Inter
national Affairs at Stanford, team
members tutor local high school stu
dents nil foreign policy issues and
host a high school Model UN confer
ence at the University.
Vaughan said the skills learned in
MUN are applicable 1 to the profes
sional world.
"Anyone interested in business or
politics benefits from the MUN ex
perience." he said. "Real diplomatic
skills are necessary to mobilize a
forum as cold-blooded as the floor of
the General Assembly behind your
resolutions."
