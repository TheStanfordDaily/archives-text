# Day In The Life
## April 18,1906 
### 
Beginning at about seven minutes
past five this morning and lasting for
fully twenty seconds, the greatest
earthquake of modern times shook
the campus and affected the entire
Santa Clara Valley and probably the
whole Pacific Coast.The effect of the
shake on the campus was terrible.
Two lives were lost, six injured, and
the damage done to buildings cannot
be estimated.The exact financial loss
will not he ascertained for weeks, but
as a general and hasty estimate Pres
ident Jordan places the figures at
$2,800,000. But it seems certain that
the loss is twice as great.
