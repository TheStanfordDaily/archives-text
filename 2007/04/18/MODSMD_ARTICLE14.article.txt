# The 						Random Hookup
## BREAKING DOWN THE TYPICAL MORNING AFTER PHRASE 
### 
A stranger shows up at an inti
mate room party? Random.
You run into your old IHUM pro
lessor at In 'n Out? Random.
A freshman emerges from the
RAs room, clad only in his boxers,
around five in the morning? Ran
dom (and pretty sketchy, too).
These events are not random sim
ply because they are unexpected:
they are random because they clash
with our assumptions about the way
things work. Room parties are for
close friends, professors only exist in
lecture halls and RAs don't —or
shouldn't, anyway — hook up with
their freshmen Iliis is how life in the
Stanford bubble operates.
"Random" no longer just con
notes a statistical selection process in
which every item has an equal prob
ability of being chosen. Instead, it's
one of the most übiquitous words in
our colorful lexicon, and we use it to
describe anything that deviates from
a social norm. "Random," my par
ents insist, has become to our gener
ation what words like "groovy" and
"neat" were to theirs. We have em
braced this adjective and made it our
own.
I lere at Stanford, anything can be
random, from the onset of the cater
pillar plague to the presence of a
techie in an Art History class. And
then of course, there's the random
hookup.
While most students can agree on
the set of activities covered by the
word (anything from making out to
sex. but usually something in be
tween). the random hookup has yet
to be defined.
So what, then, makes a hookup
random? What factors qualify one as

random, and what underlying as
sumptions about our world does it vi
olate?
Sociolinguist William Labov once
conducted a famous experiment in
which he asked subjects to label a
container as either a cup or a mug.
Participants agreed on what consti
tuted each object, until Labov played
with their dimensions and features.
When subjects were asked to identi
fy these new. unusual objects, many
did not fall consistently into one cat
egory or another. To each partici
pant, the semantic boundaries of the
words "cup" and "mug" were slightly
different.
In the same way, a random
hookup can mean different things to
different people. The phrase con
jures the equivalent of a one-night
stand, an alcohol-induced encounter
between two strangers, but the term
can extend far beyond that usage.
Some qualify a hookup as random
only if they have never met the other
person before that night. Some insist
that — even if the two are friendly
acquaintances — it's still random.
For others, a random hookup is just
one that involves anyone they have
no genuine romantic interest in.
To my surprise, the Stanford stu
dents 1 spoke to overwhelmingly iden
tified with the last two definitions.
1 looking up with people we don't real

ly know (let alone, like) is not some
thing we consider normal. Regardless
of how frequently these hookups may
occur, we seem to understand them as
some sort of aberration. As sexually
liberated as we are today, as accepted
as the hookup is. we still think it's fun
damentally.. .well, random.
Despite what our parents might
think, maybe we haven't lost all their
old-fashioned romantic sentiment.

Maybe, deep down — past the hor
mones and alcohol flooding our
blood stream — we're not looking
for easy action with a side of regret.
Maybe what we truly want is some
thing meaningful, a wholly un-ran
dom connection in the midst of this
chaos we call college.
