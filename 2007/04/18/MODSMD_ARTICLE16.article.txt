# Details emerge about Virginia Tech gunman
## 
### MATT APUZZO ASSOCIATION PRESS 
BLACKSBURG. Va. (AF) - The
gunman in the Virginia Tech mas
sacre was a sullen loner who alarmed
professors and classmates with his
twisted, violence-drenched creative
writing and left a rambling note rag
ing against religion and rich kids.
A chilling picture emerged lues
day of C'ho Seung-I iui — a 23-year
old senior majoring in English — a
day after the bloodbath that left 33
people dead, including Clio, who
killed himself as police closed in.
News reports said that he may
have been taking medication for de
pression and that he was becoming
increasingly violent and erratic.
Despite the many warning signs
that came to light in the bloody after
math. police and university officials
offered no clues as to exactly what set
C'ho off on the deadliest shooting
rampage in modern U.S. history.
"1 le was a loner, and we're having
difficulty finding information about
him." school spokesman Larry
I lincker said.
A student who attended Virginia
Tech last fall provided obscenity- and
violence-laced screenplays that he
said Cho wrote as part of a playwrit
ing class they both took. One was
about a fight between a stepson and
his stepfather, and involved throwing
of hammers and attacks with a chain
saw. Another was about students fan
tasizing about stalking and killing a
teacher who sexually molested them.
"When we read Cho's plays, it was
like something out of a nightmare. Hie
plays had really twisted, macabre vio
lence that used weapons I wouldn't
have even thought of," former class

mate lan MacFarlane, now an AOL
employee, wrote in a blog posted on
an AOL Website. 1 le said he and other
students "were talking to each other
with serious worry about whether he
could be a school shooter."
Professor Carolyn Rude, chair
woman of the university's English de
partment. said Cho's writing was so
disturbing that he had been referred
to the university's counseling service.
Cho — who arrived in the United
States as a boy from South Korea in
1992 and was raised in suburban
Washington, D.C., where his parents
worked at a dry cleaners — left a note
that was found after the bloodbath.
A law enforcement official who
read Cho's note described it Tuesday
as a typed, eight-page rant against
rich kids and religion. The official
spoke on condition of anonymity be
cause he was not authorized to speak
to the media.
"You caused me to do this," the of
ficial quoted the note as saying.
Cho indicated in his letter that the
end was near and that there was a
deed to be done, the official said. He
also expressed disappointment in his
own religion, and made several refer
ences to Christianity, the official said.
The official said the letter was ei
ther found in Cho's dorm room or in
his backpack. The backpack was
found in the hallway of the classroom
building where the shootings hap
pened. and contained several rounds
of ammunition, the official said.
The Washington Post quoted law
enforcement sources as saying Cho
died with the words "Ismail Ax" in
red ink on one of his arms, but they
were not sure what that meant.
Cho graduated from Westfield
I ligh School in Chantilly,Va..in 2(X)3.

I lis family lived in an off-white, two
story townhouse in Centreville, Va.
"He was very quiet, always by
himself," neighbor Abdul Shash said.
Shash said Cho spent a lot of his free
time playing basketball and would
not respond if someone greeted him.
Classmates painted a similar pic
ture. Sonic said that on the first day of
a British literature class last year, the
30 or so students went around and in
troduced themselves. When it was
C'ho's turn, he didn't speak.
On the sign-in sheet where every
one else had written their names. Cho
had written a question mark."ls your
name. 'Question mark?"' classmate
Julie Poole recalled the professor
asking. The young man offered little
response.
Cho spent much of that class sit
ting in the back of the room, wearing
a hat and seldom participating. In a
small department, Cho distinguished
himself for being anonymous. "He
didn't reach out to anyone. He never
talked," Poole said.
One law enforcement official said
Clio's backpack contained a receipt
for a March purchase of a Clock
mm pistol. Cho held a green card,
meaning he was a legal, permanent
resident. That meant he was eligible
to buy a handgun unless he had been
convicted of a felony.
Roanoke Firearms owner John
Markell said his shop sold the Clock
and a box of practice ammo to Cho 36
davs ago for $571.

"He was a nice, clean-cut college
kid. We won't sell a gun if we have any
idea at all that a purchase is suspi
cious." Markell said.
Investigators stopped short of say
ing Cho carried out both attacks. But
State Police ballistics tests showed
one gun was used in both.
And two law enforcement offi
cials. speaking on condition of
anonymity because the information
had not been announced, said Cho's
fingerprints were on both guns, whose
serial numbers had been filed off.
Gov. Tim Kaine said he will ap
point a panel at the university's re
quest to review authorities' handling
of the disaster. Parents and students
bitterly complained that the universi
ty should have locked down the cam
pus immediately after the first burst
of gunfire and did not do enough to
warn people.
On Tuesday afternoon, thousands
of people gathered in the basketball
arena for a memorial service for the
victims, with an overflow crowd of
thousands watching on a jumbo TV
screen in the football stadium. Presi
dent Bush and the first lady attend
ed.
"As you draw closer to your fami
lies in the coming days, I ask you to
reach out to those who ache for sons
and daughters who are never coming
home," Bush said.
Stories of heroism and ingenuity
emerged Tuesday.
Liviu Librescu, an Israeli engi

neering and math lecturer, was killed
after he was said to have protected
his students' lives by blocking the
doorway of his classroom from the
gunman. And one student, an Eagle
Scout, probably saved his own life by
using an electrical cord as a tourni
quet around his bleeding thigh, a doc
tor reported.
On Tuesday night as darkness fell,
thousands of Virginia Tech students,
faculty and area residents poured
into the center of campus to grieve
together. They held thousands of can
dles aloft as speakers urged them to
find solace in one another.

Clio's backpack contained a receipt

BLACKSBURG. Va. (AF) - The
gunman in the Virginia Tech mas
sacre was a sullen loner who alarmed
professors and classmates with his
twisted, violence-drenched creative
writing and left a rambling note rag
ing against religion and rich kids.
A chilling picture emerged lues
day of C'ho Seung-I iui — a 23-year
old senior majoring in English — a
day after the bloodbath that left 33
people dead, including Clio, who
killed himself as police closed in.
News reports said that he may
have been taking medication for de
pression and that he was becoming
increasingly violent and erratic.
Despite the many warning signs
that came to light in the bloody after
math. police and university officials
offered no clues as to exactly what set
C'ho off on the deadliest shooting
rampage in modern U.S. history.
"1 le was a loner, and we're having
difficulty finding information about
him." school spokesman Larry
I lincker said.
A student who attended Virginia
Tech last fall provided obscenity- and
violence-laced screenplays that he
said Cho wrote as part of a playwrit
ing class they both took. One was
about a fight between a stepson and
his stepfather, and involved throwing
of hammers and attacks with a chain
saw. Another was about students fan
tasizing about stalking and killing a
teacher who sexually molested them.
"When we read Cho's plays, it was
like something out of a nightmare. Hie
plays had really twisted, macabre vio
lence that used weapons I wouldn't
have even thought of," former class

mate lan MacFarlane, now an AOL
employee, wrote in a blog posted on
an AOL Website. 1 le said he and other
students "were talking to each other
with serious worry about whether he
could be a school shooter."
Professor Carolyn Rude, chair
woman of the university's English de
partment. said Cho's writing was so
disturbing that he had been referred
to the university's counseling service.
Cho — who arrived in the United
States as a boy from South Korea in
1992 and was raised in suburban
Washington, D.C., where his parents
worked at a dry cleaners — left a note
that was found after the bloodbath.
A law enforcement official who
read Cho's note described it Tuesday
as a typed, eight-page rant against
rich kids and religion. The official
spoke on condition of anonymity be
cause he was not authorized to speak
to the media.
"You caused me to do this," the of
ficial quoted the note as saying.
Cho indicated in his letter that the
end was near and that there was a
deed to be done, the official said. He
also expressed disappointment in his
own religion, and made several refer
ences to Christianity, the official said.
The official said the letter was ei
ther found in Cho's dorm room or in
his backpack. The backpack was
found in the hallway of the classroom
building where the shootings hap
pened. and contained several rounds
of ammunition, the official said.
The Washington Post quoted law
enforcement sources as saying Cho
died with the words "Ismail Ax" in
red ink on one of his arms, but they
were not sure what that meant.
Cho graduated from Westfield
I ligh School in Chantilly,Va..in 2(X)3.

I lis family lived in an off-white, two
story townhouse in Centreville, Va.
"He was very quiet, always by
himself," neighbor Abdul Shash said.
Shash said Cho spent a lot of his free
time playing basketball and would
not respond if someone greeted him.
Classmates painted a similar pic
ture. Sonic said that on the first day of
a British literature class last year, the
30 or so students went around and in
troduced themselves. When it was
C'ho's turn, he didn't speak.
