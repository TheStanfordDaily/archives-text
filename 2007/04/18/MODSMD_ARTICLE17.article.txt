## Study: bullying prevalent in schools 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Wedgies? Stolen lunch money?
launting? Hunk, these are remnants
of your bygone childhood? Think
again.
A new study from the Lucile
Packard Children's 1 lospital and the
School of Medicine has found that
bullying is rampant in American ele
mentary' schools.
Ihe report — published in the
Apr. 12 issue of the "Journal of De
velopmental and Behavioral Prac
tices"— found that nine out of 10
students in elementary school report
being victimized by their peers and
six out of 10 admit to bullying others.
Psychologist Tom Tarshis, who
developed the Peer Interactions in
Primary School questionnaire
(PIPS) that was used in the study,
said that he created the survey to ad
dress the lack of current, widely ac
cepted research on the issue.
"There was no questionnaire that
had been scientifically validated for
use in an elementary school popula
tion," he said."We needed this prop
er instrument to measure bullying
and victimization."
Tarshis' colleagues said the study
would provide researchers with in
formation on two kinds of bullying.
"This work developing PIPS will
allow researchers to gather compre
hensive information on both direct
and indirect bullying and victimiza
tion as described by children as
young as eight years." said Pediatrics
Prof. Lynne Huffman, in an email to
The Daily."As the paper notes,direct
bullying includes things like pushing.

kicking or overt threats, while indi
rect bullying is characterized by teas
ing, exclusion and giving 'dirty'
looks."
The PIPS questionnaire consist
ed of 22 questions concerning bully
ing and victimization. It was adminis
tered to 270 students in the third
through sixth grades at three differ
ent elementary schools in California
and Arizona.
The students checked boxes la
beled "a lot," "sometimes" or
"never" in response to statements
such as "at recess 1 play by myself."
Approximately l X) percent of re
spondents answered "sometimes" to
at least one question.
"What we found was that the vast
majority of kids had at least experi
enced some victimization," Tarshis
said.
Bullying and victimization are
linked to depression.anxiety,suicidal
thoughts and criminal actions,
Tarshis said.and an effective method
of intervention is vital.
"You need treatment or interven
tion that addresses three different
groups: the kids, the school staff
[and] you have to work with the par
ents too," Tarshis said. "You have to
get everyone on board. We really

need a comprehensive integrative
curriculum adopted at the elemen
tary school level."
'"We believe the PIPS will be a
helpful tool that can be used to test
intervention effectiveness," I luff
man added.
Ihe researchers hope the publi
cation of the study will spur discus
sion about bullying.
"1 lopefully it will bring [the issues
of bullying and victimization] to the
attention of the scientific community
— pediatricians and child psychia
trists," Tarshis said.
" The Journal of Developmental
and Behavioral Pediatrics' is a peer
reviewed journal devoted to the de
velopmental and psychosocial as
pects of pediatric health care," I luff
man said. "As it is written for and
read by physicians, clinicians, psy
chologists and researchers who are
concerned with emotional, behav
ioral and psychosomatic problems as
well as learning disorders and devel
opmental disabilities, it provides a
terrific opportunity for disseminat
ing the important conclusions of this
research project."
