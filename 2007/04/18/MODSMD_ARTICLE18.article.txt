## Editorial Board Fairness requires runoff 
### 
Last night. 12 ASSU Senators voted to
deprive both graduate and undergrad
uate of their constitutional
right to a runoff election.
Bernard fraga "08. the elections commis
sioner. presented a constitutional argument
in favor of a runoff election in the Senate
meeting last night. Fraga. who recently
presided with objectivity and efficiency over
the highest-turnout election in ASSU histo
ry. knows what he is talking about.
Of 4.497 votes cast for executive slates.
Hershev Avula 'OS and Mondaire Jones '09
received a first-choice total of 1867. 41.5
percent of the total. Even in the fourth
round, after the instant runoff system had
eliminated three rival slates, the current ex
ecutives-elect garnered only a plurality of
votes cast — not a majority. Of the original
4497 votes. Avula/Jones received 45.1% in
this round.
Article III. section 3 of the student body
constitution specifically states that "The
President and Vice President shall be elect
ed by a majority of the Association." and
that."[s]hould no slate of candidates receive
a majority of the votes...a runoff election
shall be held within the next 14 days be
tween the two slates receiving the most
votes."The letter and spirit of the constitu
tion agree: A runoff election must be held.
rhe 12 Senators who voted to overrule
Fraga's recommendation for a new round of
runoff voting did so by pointing to the fifth
round of runoff balloting, in which
Avula/Jones garnered 2856 out of the oriui

nal 4497 votes cast — a clear, if razor-thin,
majority.The problem with this argument is
that the fifth round of runoff voting took
place after Avula/Jones's last competitor
was eliminated.
Only after the last remaining contender
was thrown out did Avula/Jones win more
than half of votes cast for executive slates.
There is some ambiguity in the constitution
and the Senate bylaws as to whether this
constitutes a majority.
It should not.Thanks to the instant runoff
system, we know that if all other candidates
were eliminated, a little more than half of
students would prefer Avula/Jones to hav
ing no executives at all.
This sort of electoral ambiguity has no
place in a sophisticated, liberal-minded
community like Stanford.
We owe it to all slates to declare a new
campaign period and hold a runoff election.
If next year's executives are to enjoy the le
gitimacy that should be accorded to demo
cratically-elected leaders, their victory must
be confirmed by a final round of elections
between the two highest vote-getters —
Avula Jones and Brett Mammon '08 and
Lakshmi Karra '08.
We also owe it to the students and voters.
In 2002. bureaucratic stalling prevented a
student from filing a valid claim in another
controversial election 'I"he voters of this
University are in danger of falling victim to
the same hoodwink. Although the 2002 in-
