# Overheard in White Plaza
## 
### 
Last spring, eating dinner alone one
night in The Treehouse (my life is so
glamorous). 1 overheard a rather ram
bunctious conversation held between a
sloppy, bearded trat boy and a girl in jogging
shorts in the booth next to me. Although 1
missed some of the preliminary subtleties,
the gist was a description of a bet the man
had taken a few weeks before: apparently
his frat had ordered one too many of the
Ireehouse's colossal five-foot party burritos
for a rush event, and one of the bearded
guy's frat brothers wagered $50 that he
could not eat the entire thing within three
days. The only stipulation: Beard could not
cut. rip or tear the burrito in any way.To clar
ify. these burritos are as thick around as a
relative!} muscular female thigh.
Beard described with crowing glee his
race against time and When
Beard had finally eaten the whole mess
small enough to tit into a mini-fridge, the
burrito s tilling had taken on the viscosity of
freeze-dried spam and his roommate com
plained of a distinctly morgue-like smell.
()nce it could fit into his microwave, he
riuked the entire oozing bean-and-cheese
og upward, he claimed, of thirty times in
>rder to make it palatable enough to jam
Jown a few bites. Finally he reached the
promised land, the last few inches of burrito
— rock hard, petrified by repeated microra-
Jiation and a gentle mossy green about its
>erimeter.
I le couldn't do it. He threw away the bur
ito and ceded his bet — and. I'm guessing,
lis lunch.
lb this day 1 periodically wander the
:ampus. wondering where my bearded bur
'ito-lover is now. Has his digestive system
ully recovered? Did he shave his beard?

Will he rally his strength and try again, a
hungrier, wiser man? I venture a hopeful
"no" to the latter.
Not only is this one of the greatest tales I
have ever heard of man pitted versus his
own gluttony, but it stands as a reminder of
one of the key tenets of life: Listen to other
people's conversations. Especially those
conversations to which you are not invited
because that, frankly, is when people say the
best stutf. And thus a legacy of eavesdrop
ping was born.
Well, eavesdropping is such a vulgar (al
beit wholly accurate) word for it. I don't
want to paint myself here as a chronic peep
ing torn, skulking around behind draperies
with my ears pressed to keyholes. Nothing
ot the sort! What I'm talking about is polite,
civilized non-accidental overhearing: hang
ing around coffee houses or grocery stores,
merely keeping an auditory sensor on the
pulse ot human life. Of course, if 1 happen to
be in the vicinity of a particularly good
break-up. I wouldn't put myself above
crouching behind a stack of empty boxes for
a better vantage point.
Iliis type of voyeurism is a natural
human impulse. There are websites like
"Overheard in New York" and its innumer-
