# Overheard in White Plaza
## 
### 
Last spring, eating dinner alone one
night in The Treehouse (my life is so
glamorous). 1 overheard a rather ram
bunctious conversation held between a
sloppy, bearded trat boy and a girl in jogging
shorts in the booth next to me. Although 1
missed some of the preliminary subtleties,
the gist was a description of a bet the man
had taken a few weeks before: apparently
his frat had ordered one too many of the
Ireehouse's colossal five-foot party burritos
for a rush event, and one of the bearded
guy's frat brothers wagered $50 that he
could not eat the entire thing within three
days. The only stipulation: Beard could not
cut. rip or tear the burrito in any way.To clar
ify. these burritos are as thick around as a
relative!} muscular female thigh.
Beard described with crowing glee his
race against time and When
Beard had finally eaten the whole mess
small enough to tit into a mini-fridge, the
burrito s tilling had taken on the viscosity of
freeze-dried spam and his roommate com
plained of a distinctly morgue-like smell.
()nce it could fit into his microwave, he
riuked the entire oozing bean-and-cheese
og upward, he claimed, of thirty times in
>rder to make it palatable enough to jam
Jown a few bites. Finally he reached the
promised land, the last few inches of burrito
— rock hard, petrified by repeated microra-
Jiation and a gentle mossy green about its
>erimeter.
I le couldn't do it. He threw away the bur
ito and ceded his bet — and. I'm guessing,
lis lunch.
lb this day 1 periodically wander the
:ampus. wondering where my bearded bur
'ito-lover is now. Has his digestive system
ully recovered? Did he shave his beard?

Will he rally his strength and try again, a
hungrier, wiser man? I venture a hopeful
"no" to the latter.
Not only is this one of the greatest tales I
have ever heard of man pitted versus his
own gluttony, but it stands as a reminder of
one of the key tenets of life: Listen to other
people's conversations. Especially those
conversations to which you are not invited
because that, frankly, is when people say the
best stutf. And thus a legacy of eavesdrop
ping was born.
Well, eavesdropping is such a vulgar (al
beit wholly accurate) word for it. I don't
want to paint myself here as a chronic peep
ing torn, skulking around behind draperies
with my ears pressed to keyholes. Nothing
ot the sort! What I'm talking about is polite,
civilized non-accidental overhearing: hang
ing around coffee houses or grocery stores,
merely keeping an auditory sensor on the
pulse ot human life. Of course, if 1 happen to
be in the vicinity of a particularly good
break-up. I wouldn't put myself above
crouching behind a stack of empty boxes for
a better vantage point.
Iliis type of voyeurism is a natural
human impulse. There are websites like
"Overheard in New York" and its innumer-

Atomic Nectarine
able regional spin-offs dedicated
solely to categorizing snippets of
other people's bizarre banter. These
sites prove that if overheard conver
sations aren't the currency of civi
lization, they are at least its merrily
jangling small change.
Vicariously identifying with some
guy who is talking too loudly at
Coldstone can give you the opportu
nity to experiences life's greatest
sorrows and joys at no expense of
your own. Slaving away in our heav
ily padded academic cells, some
times we lose touch with the outside
world and the surprisingly high per
centage of its inhabitants whose
weekends don't revolve around san
itized fraternity debauchery or hat
ing Tolstoy. Over the past year, my
ceaseless devotion to minding
anonymous strangers' beeswax has
allowed me to suffer the frustration
of refinancing a house, the elation of
being awarded a Fulbright and even
the awkward first encounter be
tween a portly Wisconsin CEO and
his recently purchased Russian mail

order bride. (He asked if she liked
ketchup: she demanded they buy a
house with a pool.)
Even on a day when 1 can't bring
myself to change out of pajamas, I
can experience cataclysmic events —
usually with a good dose of schaden
freude. I have collected knock-knock
jokes aplenty, break-ups by the
dozen, frantic lunch hour psychoana
lyst phone calls and one really really
good biscuit recipe. While eaves
dropping has not necessarily in
creased the depth of my life, it has
definitely expanded the breadth.
While some might misconstrue
the habitual hearer of other people's
conversations as a furtive cloaked
tigure. hell-bent on invading privacy
and exposing the secrets of
strangers, I see it as a gentler hobby
more in the line of. say. butterfly
catching. The words whizzing past
your ears the majority of every day
are striking and ephemeral cultural
artifacts, and paying attention to
them can help you better understand
the people around you. Plus, you
hear the occasional great story about
truly repulsive Mexican food.
