### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate
failed to pass a controversial hut
toothless divestment hill last night
calling for the University to
reevaluate its investments in Is
rael and Palestine. Despite gar
nering five 'yes' votes and only
three "no" votes, the measure
failed to gather the majority it
needed to pass after five senators
abstained.
Ilie Senate first discussed the
hill — authored hy Nahill Idrisi
'09 — at a February meeting, hut
delayed voting until yesterday
due to a makeover the hill under
went after a variety of concerns
were raised.
At the February meeting, the

Senate heard from Omar Shakir
'07, president of Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel
(SCAI), and Andrew Ehrich '09,
president of the Jewish Student
Association (JSA).
Shakir and Ehrich briefly ad

dressed the chamber over the
bill's changes at last night's meet
ing. The debate was not as lengthy
or as heated as it was at the Febru
ary meeting, possibly due to pre-

Dozens of undergraduates crowded the ASSU Senate meeting last night
to express their opinions on a bill that would call for the University to divest
from Israel and Palestine. The bill failed to harness a majority of votes.
vailing concerns about last week's
ASSU elections results. (Please see
"Election Questioned",page I.)
"The major issue this bill comes
down to," Shakir said, "is that the
Board of Trustees reevaluate its in
vestment responsibilities."
"What we've got here is a bill
that reflects compromises," he
added, referring to the changes
made to the bill, which included a
focus on investment responsibility
instead of an explicit call for divest
ment. Hie revised bill also included
a Human Rights Watch statement
which reads,"The Hamas-led Pales
tinian authority needs to take im
mediate steps to end attacks on
civilians by Hamas's own militant
wing and other armed groups."
Ehrich contested Shakir's
claims.
"This bill, though changed, re
mains one-sided, unfair and a detri
ment to peace in the Middle East,"
he said.
Ehrich called the bill's inclusion
of the Human Rights Watch state
ment condemning Hamas "disin

genuous.
"Ilamas is a recognized terrorist
organization, so no one invests in
them anyway." Ehrich said. "Which
is more proactive —to invest in
peace, or to divest from people who
may be trying to solve the situa
tion?"
Though the bill failed to win
enough support to pass in the Sen
ate, Shakir told The Daily after the
meeting that he thought the
evening's results constituted a "very
positive step."
"I see this as a real victory." he
said, "to have more 'yes' than no'
votes just a few months after this
campaign was launched."
Ehrich said that student opinion
about divestment is divided,citing a
wide range of views about the Mid
dle East on campus.
"There's really no precedent for
such a bill to be brought to the Sen
ate when the [Office of Student Ac
tivities] is actively working to pro
mote a fair dialogue with both
SCAI supporters and supporters of
Israel," Ehrich said. "[Such a dia
logue] would lead to a debate that
can be productive and work to
wards true peace."
