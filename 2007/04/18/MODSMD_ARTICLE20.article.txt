# The 						making of a dull boy

### 
I w as organizing my pencils this morning.
Allow a few seconds for that sentence to
sink in. I was categorically separating the
colors, shapes and sizes of my writing uten
sils And all the while. I was cheerfully belt
ing out a song. Not just any song, mind you.
but the charming folk ditty "The Unicorn
Song." hy Peter. Paul and Mary:
"When I was growing up.
My best friend was a unicorn.
The others smiled at me. and called me
crazy.
Hut I was not upset, by knowing I did not
conform.
I always thought their seeing must be
hazy."
I got out the ol' "two-wheels." chuckling
as I made use of this antiquated phrase, and
began to mechanically churn the wheels in
the direction of my first class.
"My. I slept well." said my inner voice, an
over-enthusiastic 1950s teenager who anx
iously awaits Ma and Pa at the close of the
workday. "A full 9 hours! And I got work
done, too!"
I reflected on my new study habits linal
ly. I thought. I've got it all down. I do home
work AND I sleep! What a novel concept. I

decided at the start of spring quarter to go to
sleep before 12 and wake up before 9. to do
my most intense studying during the day
and to never, under any circumstances, take
naps And surprisingly, unlike my plans to
stop drinking caffeine, eating vegetables,
taking pictures of myself with Photobooth
and going in for psychology studies that pay
a sub-ten-dollar amount, this plan actually
worked.
()h dear though, I thought, what ever will
I do with all of my free time?
Perhaps. I can engage in extracurricular
activities that will reflect well upon me when
I decide to enter the workforce. Or. alterna
tively. I can volunteer, which w ill also reflect
well upon me when I decide to enter the

workforce. Gee, I enjoy the prospect
of entering the workforce.
My mind wanders off to ponder
the meaning of the word "work
force," as 1 sit alertly in class, taking
an abundance of notes and mar
veling at my mental agility (no doubt
resulting from the copious sleep). 1
even find myself whistling the "Andy
Griffith" song as I bike back from
my history class.
And it hits me square on. once
more: what the hell am I doing?
ITie natural consequence of be
coming studious is becoming boring.
ITiis is a tried and proven fact, and I
found it out for myself while biking
gaily back to my dormitory and giv
ing myself an internal pat on the
back for good study habits.
What a mistake! All work and no
play really does make for a dull boy.
Sure, 1 get more work done, but
work, by nature, is not meant to be
done. It is meant to sit idly, as I con
struct cardboard outfits for use in
soccer matches. Work is supposed to
disappear, as 1 tape a fake coconut

bra to my chest and create a grass
skirt out of palm fronds. And most
importantly, work is supposed to do
itself, if I wait long enough.
Let this be a rallying cry to all of
you. As you sit in the library, the
world turns, and "As the World
Turns" is a really crappy TV pro
gram. As you type away in Meyer,
there are half-naked people outside
playing in the foam that someone
has created in the fountains. And as
you sing "The Unicorn Song" and
sort pencils, the guy down the hall is
telling a story about Full Frontal Nu
dity.
I learned a valuable lesson today,
and I hope convey it to all of you be
fore it's too late. Dullness can hap
pen. It is a real problem. But you
can fight it. with irregular sleep cy
cles, irrational costume creation,
and general irreverence. At the very
least, you can triumphantly leave
those pencils in their haphazard
heap, as you trump off to create
problems for administrative offi
cials.
