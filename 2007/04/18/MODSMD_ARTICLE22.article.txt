# Financial illiteracy
## 
### 
Life as an undergraduate at Stanford is a
slightly misrepresented version of real
ity. We have a prepared dinner every
night at 6 p.m.. we don't pay fur laundry and
we never commute more than five minutes to
our campus "jobs." Even the idea of paying
for utilities is unknown. So many students
couldn't pay a monthly internet hill that the
administration decided to incorporate the
cost into tuition. Whew — one less thing to
worry about.
It's no surprise, then, that when I attended
a class called "Financial Literacy." there was
not an empty seat in the room. After four
years of a liberal arts education, a group of
panicking seniors like myself realized their
recent seminar on eighteenth-century British
poets might not have many "real world" ap
plications. Financial Literacy, on the other
hand, teaches the very basics of earning,
spending and saving money. It is the most
practical one-unit class I have ever taken.
I always considered myself to be suffi
ciently financially "literate." 1 have a job. I
pay tor things. I even rented an apartment.
All on my own! OK. you caught me — I only
sublet an apartment during a summer. And I
only pay for things like boxes of Two-Buck
Chuek and a senior formal ticket. I 've never
owned a credit card or signed a lease, and I
usually say I am "exempt from paying taxes
because I don't know what that means.
Nonetheless, mv financial illiteracy never

concerned me until recently. My train of
thought went something like this: 1 do not
own very much money, nor do I plan on ever
making very much money, therefore why do
I need to learn about finances? The answer is
that, like most undergraduates, I have never
had a full-time job. Never having a full-time
job means that even the lowest salary imagi
nable is going to seem like 1 hit the lottery.
Suddenly I will not just have money to spend,
but money to mismanage and lose.
The only thing that makes me feel better
is the fact I am not alone. As I gazed across
the lecture hall I saw a fantastic group of
smart, ambitious, severely confused individu
als. There were Rhodes scholars and Olympic
athletes ready to solve to world's problems,
but not one of them could do their own taxes.
Iliey were the group of students that finally
realized there are certain things only govern
ment payroll tables can teach you. Of course,
the students I didn't find among this group
were the econ-major-investment-banker

types who knew the difference between state
and federal bonds by age six. For the rest of
us. this class represented the real world in all
its painful glory. No fluffy discussions about
Nietzsche or Pushkin, just about payroll
withholdings.
Hie biggest slap in the face is this idea of
saving for the future. (Apparently this week
end doesn't count as "the future" anymore.)
Putting a few pennies in the piggy bank is
easy, but words like pensions and 401 ks
might as well be part of a foreign language.
My biggest fear is that 1 will be the idiot who
invests his life-savings in next version of Pogs
and then wonders what went wrong. While I
always assumed that people who worry
about financial literacy were just greedy, now
I realize that they are the ones who can buy a
house or pay for their children's education.
Although this school tries to shield us
from anything remotely related to life out
side the Farm, this simple class is a pinprick in
the Stanford bubble. It is slowly letting in real
world air and serves as a reminder that some
times practical, mundane information is im
poi tant too. Now. it you excuse me, I must get
back to studying for my class on Kierkeuaard
and religious existentialism.

Kevin is worried the IRS is going to put him in
jail for saying he is exempt from paying taxes. If
you are NO I the IRS, you can email him at
