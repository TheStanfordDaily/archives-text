## Pleasantly surprised by "Three Ex-Terrorists" event 
### ADNAN MAJID 
I was well aware of the positions concern
ing Islam and Muslims presented by
each of the three speakers at the April
16th "Three Ex-Terrorists" event. As a
member of the Muslim community of Stan
ford. I noticed many a Muslim student trou
bled by the ideology of the speakers in the
days leading up to the event. Some wanted
to respectfully protest, a course of action we
eventually decided against. 1 attended the
event fully expecting my religion to be re
viled. as it was. However, I left pleasantly
surprised and confident that the Stanford

community would see through the speakers'
black and white claims.
Actually, I had a hard time suppressing my
laughter when Zaki Anani was describing his
exemplary Muslim upbringing, one in which
he would fail to pray but faithfully kept hold
of the core Islamic belief of fighting the infi
del. Maybe I had fooled myself into thinking
that prayer, five times a day. was a pillar of
Islam.
The next time I bike over to the campus
mosque at 6:00 a.m. for daily morning
prayers. Ill be sure to ask my friend. "What
are we doing here, not sleeping? Didn't you
know we were more obligated to fight? Stop

wasting your time with Darfur activism or
advocacy for the homeless."
He d look at me puzzled, so I 'd brinii out
my Qur an pointing out the verse — "And
slay them where you find them" (2.191). But
he'd ask me to read the very verse preceding
it. "Fight in the way of God those who fight
you and do not commit aggression — God
loves not aggressors" (2.190). Are we then
talking about defensive war?
I was continually mystified by one of the
speaker's knowledge of the Qur an and the
tradition of the prophet Mohammad. I'd
guess I'd have to buy one of the
speakers' books to actually learn
why 1 want to kill you.
Despite the pain felt by many Mus
lim students who had attended the
event, the Stanford community can
stand to benefit greatly from it. The
students who attended the event and
those who could not are all well edu
cated and keen on independently in
vestigating any claim for its veracity.
If you wonder about the speak
ers' claims of yearning to bring the
severed heads of infidels before the
feet of Allah, ask your Muslim dorm
mate how she views Islam's stance
against the anthropomorphi/ation
of God. Seek to understand how
Muslims interpret the oft-cited verse
on wife-beating in light of the
Prophet Muhammad's own admoni
tion of the practice. Seek out individ
uals or organizations such as the Is
lamic Society at Stanford University

(ISSIJ) to discuss such interpreta
tions. Ask the University administra
tion for Islamic resources if they are
not available. Read the Qur'an and
form your own interpretations of
how to balance verses of peace with
verses of fighting.
Falsehood springs from misun
derstandings, such as the suggestion
that the feelings of the Muslim ques
tioners were atypical. The interfaith
work of the father of one questioner
is no surprise in Muslim America.
But the speakers were keen to con
demn even the Council of American-
Islamic Relations (CAIR).a key civil
rights organization and one of many
Muslim groups that repeatedly con
demn terrorism.
Forget about conservative or
"moderate" Muslims. Does anyone
who witnessed the event truly think
that even liberal Muslims would like
to hold hands with Walid Shoebat,
/.aki Anani and Kamal Saleem with
their open stance against Islam? It is
no surprise that only fifty of the
"eight million" (possibly distrustful)
American Muslims would show up
to his rally in Washington DC. Does

CAlß's refusal to attend constitute
as clear proof in its sympathy for ter
rorists? (By the way. check out their
great Islamofascist website at
www.cair.com.)
Or maybe I'm just lying to your
face, using taqiyyah, an understand
able Shi'a position to conceal one's
beliefs in the face of persecution but
which Kamal Saleem just taught me
was actually an obligatory tool for all
Muslims todestroN infidels. The mes
sage is clear: Distrust your Muslim
neighbor.
But as I had said, our community
at Stanford can easily reject such
fear. We've been trained to investi
gate what we don't know rather than
to take a speaker's statements on
faith. We can far too easily dismiss
the first two speakers, Zaki Anani
and Kamal Saleem. for offering us
nothing but that fear.
I was impressed, however, with
Walid Shoebat's argumentative
style, his ability to anticipate the re
sponses of his opponents to absolve
himself of the accusations leveled
against him. He complains, "we are
being looked at as Islamophobes.

racists, hate-mongers, you name it."
He complains further that at each
event, he hears a barrage of voices: "1
was horn in. grew up in. and experi
enced Palestine, l gypt. Iran, and
Pakistan and disagree with your ac
count. Because of his complaints, are
we then to simph dismiss the claims
that he may truh he a hate-monger
or that his distant account of his
youth ma\ truh diverge from the
everyday experiences of natives of
foreign lands?
And at the end. 1 was amused that
Shoebat eluded Israeli peace ac
tivists for being too willing to engage
with Palestinians rather than whole
heartedly supporting Israeli occupa
tion all this while the event flyer
claimed he was now a "peace ac
tivist." I 'or some reason.it doesn't re
ally taste like peace.
But maybe peace tastes like car
rion.
