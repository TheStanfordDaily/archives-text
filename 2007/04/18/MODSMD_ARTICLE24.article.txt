Community Day highlights
living wage issue
Stanford's recent Community
Day was enjoyable, but for main
people at Stanford it could have been
more enjoyable. These are the peo
ple. mostly contract employees, who
are not paid a living wage.
They are some of the hardest-work
ing people at the University: they
earn a living wage, but they don't get
paid one.
The living wage issue has been
under discussion at Stanford for sev
eral years now. The University actu
ally claims to have a living wage pol
icy. but it includes so many condi
tions and exclusions that it is not
clear that anyone at Stanford actual
ly benefits from it.
The standard for a university's re
sponsibility to its community is set In
Harvard, which has had an effective
living wage policy since 2001.
Harvard's policy was established
when it was led by president-emeri
tus Derek Bok. Ironically, Bok is an
alum of Stanford (BA '51). so while
his own institution is a leader, his
alma mater is dratiuinu her feet.

It's time for Stanford to address
the living wage issue forthrightly.

SNRP loss not "tragic"
Ihe Stanford News Readership
Program is obsolete and wasteful.
You defended the program by stat
ing that the presence of newspapers
provided In SNRP encourages stu
dents to read them, whereas they
otherwise might not have. Most stu
dents either don't care enough to
read the paper, or they care enough
to seek out news on their own.
Accessing the New York Times
website (which, including l imes Se
lect. is wholly free for university stu
dents) is hardly more difficult than
picking up a newspaper, especially at
a school as w ell-connected as Stan
ford Dropping the program isn't a
"tragic loss" as you mentioned
( ' l)on't let SNRP end," April 16): it's
a monumental amount of trees saved.
