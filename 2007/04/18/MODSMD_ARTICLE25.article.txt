Alter consistently performing at a high level in the
past tew weeks, including a smashing victory over
C alitornia in the Big Meet and a stellar performance
in the NCAA Indoor Championship, the Stanford
track and field team was much more relaxed this past
weekend. But even though the Cardinal was able to
take a breather, it still came out with a strong per
formance.

Sophomore Lau
ren Stewart was the
sole player competing
in the Rafer John
son/Jackie Joyner-
Kersee Invitational at

UP NEXT
TRITON INVITATIONAL
4/2 La Jolla, Calif.

UCLA this past weekend. She participated in the
multi-event portion.
Track and field director Edrick Floreal remarked
that "she had a good start," but unfortunately was not
able to make an NCAA-qualifying mark because she
received three fouls. A player is only allowed to have
three attempts when participating in the event.
Meanwhile, senior Michael Robertson, junior
Daniel Schaerer and redshirt freshman Jaynie
Goodbody participated in the Mt. SAC relays in
Walnut. Calif, this past weekend. In a competition
featuring several well-known stars —
including Asafa Powell from Jamaica,
who is the 100-meter world record hold
er, and Dwight Phillips, the long jump
Olympic gold medalist — Stanford ath
letes were able to hold their own.
Floreal was especially impressed
with Schaerer, whose 196-foot mark
in the discus was "a big personal
best" and improved his ranking in the
NCAA. Robertson finished with a
mark of 198 feet, which the coach
seemed relatively happy about. Also.
Goodbody threw the javelin an im
pressive distance of 126 feet, doing
well enough to reach the final round.
Next weekend, the team heads to
LaJolla,Calif.,fortheTriton Invitation
al. Most of the team — about 60 peo
ple — will travel for the competition.
As the team nears May's postsea
son events, the Cardinal is focused on
coming out strong as the upcoming
competitions have higher stakes.
"We're just try ing to come togeth
er as a team for the Pac-10 [tourna
ment]," Floreal said.
