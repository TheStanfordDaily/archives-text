# Card buckles late to Broncos, 6-3

### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
BASEBALL

After earning its first Pacific-10
Conference win of the season Sunday
against Arizona. Stanford baseball
knew it had the opportunity to build
momentum last night against Santa
Clara. But in a season that has thus far
been ripe with failure, the Cardinal
again failed against its cross-town ri
vals, falling 6-3.
The Broncos (18-19,5-4 West Coast
Conference) started hot at Sunken Di
amond. scoring a first-inning run on a
pair of singles and a double-play ball
that scored leadoff man David Hoff
man from third. Stanford (15-17, 1-8
Pac-10) answered back in the bottom of
the first, as junior designated hitter
Michael Taylor drove in freshman right
fielder Toby Gerhart from first with a
double to right centerfield.
Scoring quieted down over the next
three innings, before Stanford sopho
more right hander Max Fearnow re
lieved junior David Stringer in the third
with one out and runners on the cor
ners. A strange balk call on a move from
first to third that would have resulted in
an out was argued by both managers
and eventually amounted to a do-over,
as no out was called and runners stayed
at the corners. I Tie run at third would
eventually score later that inning on a
fielder's choice, and the Broncos added
an insurance run in the seventh.
The Cardinal was quick to rally,
however, as Santa Clara's Justin Kuehn

hit sophomore shortstop Cord Phelps
with a pitch. Junior catcher Brian Juhl
capitalized, driving an 0-1 pitch over
the right-field fence to tie the game at
three.
Hut the Broncos came roaring back
in the eighth. Two singles and two walks
set the stage, and a crucial double down
the left-field line from designated hitter
Carl Bacon, against sophomore south
paw Tom Stilson. gave Santa Clara its
final margin of victory.
Stanford junior Brendan Domarac
ki, pinch hitting for sophomore Brent
Milleville, led off the bottom of the
ninth with a double to centerfield. After
sophomore Grant Escue's flyout Juhl's
groundout to first advanced Domarac
ki to third, but sophomore centerfield
er Sean Ratliff s single up the right-field
line struck freshman pinch runner
Wande Olabisi for the final out.
Stanford's season continues with a
weekend series at Cal (19-19,3-6 Pac
-10).
