4/ 1 at Hawaii L 3-1

Hawaii to battle, pushing Saturday's match to four
games. Unfortunately, Stanford was not able to build
enough momentum to close out Saturday or Sunday's

matches victoriously and fell in three and four games,
respectively, to Hawaii.
"We got better game by game, match by match this
weekend." head coach John kosty said. "We were fair
ly inconsistent on Friday night, but we played tough.
Unfortunately, we were battling from behind for most
of the games."
Friday's match was a duel to the finish with each
team competing to build the lead. During the first 13
points of game one. the lead switched hands three
times and a tie occurred 10 times.
Hawaii eventually stacked a large lead after there
was a tie at 13-all. and the Warriors went on to win the
match 30-22.
Game two was no different than game one in the

beginning stages of the match. The
Warriors sealed their win when they
scored eight of the final 10 points
played, winning by a score of 30-23.
Game three was much tougher for
the Card as 1 lavvaii constructed a 10-
point lead that the Card was unable
to come back from. Blocking and hit
ting made the difference in the final
30-22 outcome.
The Cardinal notched six blocks
against the Warriors' 11.5. Freshman
opposite l -van Romero led the Car
dinal with 17 kills, but could not raise
Stanford's hitting percentage (.104)
enough for it to compete with
I lawaii's .334 hitting average.
In I lawaii's last match of the sea
son on Saturday, over 4.000 people
came to the Stan Sheriff Center in

Honolulu to say goodbye to four
seniors and to watch the Cardinal's
record fall to 3-25 overall and 2-20 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. The weekend series was also a
visit home for freshman setter Kawi
ka Shoji.
Stanford stayed point for point
with Hawaii (13-13, 11-11 MPSF)
and even had the lead at 14-11 until
the Warriors scored four straight to
tie the score at 15-all. Hawaii would
go on to build a lead to take game
one. 30-27.
The Cardinal came out fighting in
game two and jumped out to an early
lead at 10-6. Stanford held on to its
six-point advantage and went on to
win the game, forcing the match to
four games.
"We came out strong on Satur
day." Kosty said. "We lost the first
game, but put up some tough compe
tition. We played really well in the
following games, but it became a
Lauri 1 lakala [Ilawaii'ssenior oppo

site] show. It was senior night,and he
really stepped up his game and
played well. We did our best to try to
stop him, and he just got too many
kills."
Hawaii was shaken by Stanford's
win but followed up with a showcase
of its blocking abilities, leading to a
game-three victory of 30-23 for the
Warriors. The Cardinal stayed with
the Warriors in game four until
Hawaii broke the tie at 9-all and
gained a significant lead. Stanford
had lost its momentum, the game
and its last match with a final game
score of 30-25.
Shoji led the Cardinal with 23
kills and Romero added another 22.
Sophomore setter Miki Groppi com
manded 58 assists, while fellow soph
omore Brandon Williams posted a
match high of eight blocks.
The Cardinal has had a rough
year but has improved greatly over
the past season. Next season. Stan
ford will look to improve its record

and build its reputation early on.
"If you watched the match on Sat
urday you would expect Stanford to
be at least a top-500 team," Kostv
said. "We consistently got better and
played better volleyball, though our
record did not reflect how good of a
team we really were at the end of the
season. I've been trying to get the
guys to be more aggressive when
they play; the ball isn't down until it
hits the floor."
"Brandon Williams actually dove
over the bench and crashed into the
bleachers in the third game while
[senior libero] Brian Lindburg ran
over the scorers' table and made a
man spill coffee on himself and the
television set in order to save the
ball," he continued."We played real
ly hard over the weekend, and those
are just some examples of how much
heart we have on this team."
