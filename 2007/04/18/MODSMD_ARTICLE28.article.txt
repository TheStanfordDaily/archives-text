# IIyse Ishino Women's Gymnastics
## Battling back — with a smile 
### JENNIFER O'NEIL 
Ilyse Ishino — a freshman gymnast
with a love of shopping, chocolate souffles
and hip-hop dancing. Just looking at her,
you would never know that she's battling
a life-threatening disease.
shino came to Stanford via Santa Ana
as one of the most highly recruited fresh
men in gymnastics. She had won the level
-10 national title and the alternate spot on
the 2(X)4 Olympic team.
But, just after this past Thanksgiving,
Ishino was diagnosed with pulmonary em
boli. With blood clotting in her lungs, one
of Stanford's most promising gymnasts
had no choice but to abandon the high
beam for blood thinners and the sidelines

in the past five months.
It's a frustrating illness
because she feels fine and
she is in the best shape of
her life," Coach Kristen
Smyth said. "She is a phe
nominal gymnast and
even better person. She
hasn't had a day of prac
tice without a smile. She is a
great inspiration for the
team."
Ishino's gymnastics ca
reer goes farther back,
though, than her recruit
ment by the Cardinal. She
