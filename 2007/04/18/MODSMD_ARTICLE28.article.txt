# IIyse Ishino Women's Gymnastics
## Battling back — with a smile 
### JENNIFER O'NEIL 
Ilyse Ishino — a freshman gymnast
with a love of shopping, chocolate souffles
and hip-hop dancing. Just looking at her,
you would never know that she's battling
a life-threatening disease.
shino came to Stanford via Santa Ana
as one of the most highly recruited fresh
men in gymnastics. She had won the level
-10 national title and the alternate spot on
the 2(X)4 Olympic team.
But, just after this past Thanksgiving,
Ishino was diagnosed with pulmonary em
boli. With blood clotting in her lungs, one
of Stanford's most promising gymnasts
had no choice but to abandon the high
beam for blood thinners and the sidelines

in the past five months.
It's a frustrating illness
because she feels fine and
she is in the best shape of
her life," Coach Kristen
Smyth said. "She is a phe
nominal gymnast and
even better person. She
hasn't had a day of prac
tice without a smile. She is a
great inspiration for the
team."
Ishino's gymnastics ca
reer goes farther back,
though, than her recruit
ment by the Cardinal. She
got h<x)ked on the sport
by summersaulting at

the young age of three.
"Mv parents were extremely sup
portive, especially in my serious gym
nastics career," she said. "They helped
me balance school and gym: they
would even make the long 40-minute
drive to and from practice."
Along with her parents, another
huge role model for lshino was her
teammate, Tabitha Yim. Previously
club team members, the two met when
lshino was 14. There was an instant
connection, and they trained for four

years together.
When asked about Yim. Ishino's
face lit up in a gigantic smile.
"Tabby welcomed me with open
arms." she said. "She was almost a sis
ter figure for me: she would even help
me out at competitions. I don't know
what I would have done without her."
Allyse went through the Olympic
trials with Yim in 2004. And after
Yim's injury, Allyse went on to place
fifth at trials and qualify for the alter
nate position in Athens.
"Four days after Tab's surgery, she
was in the gym helping and cheering
me on. cast and all." lshino said. "We
were lucky to have each other during
the trials time and elite gymnastics —
it was a great support system."

So what does an alternate
Olympian gymnast do on campus
when she is not able to compete? She
immerses herself in Stanford life. Ishi
no is busy participating in one of her
greatest passions, dance, as a member
of the hip-hop group DVB.
"I am absolutely obsessed with
dancing." Ishino said. "I want to learn
all different styles of dance: modern,
jazz, ballet, and maybe even minor in
dance. The people in DVB are so
much tun and so laid-back. Dancing
has really helped me cope and take
my mind off of everything."
On the mats, though Ishino has
been injured, her upbeat attitude and
optimism have been a huge help to
her teammates.

Junior Liz Tricase is amazed by
Ishino's work ethic.
"1 don't know how she does it." Tri
case said."She is in the gym ever}' day.
forced to work on the boring stuff,
like flexibility and conditioning. Her
motivation and determination is in
spiring to the whole team."
Ishino said she makes an effort to
not be a downer in practice.
"I want to make the atmosphere of
practice lighter: I don't want to make
them worry," she said. "It's not about
me — it's about the team."
After six months of blood thin
ners, Allyse should finally be cleared
on May 1 — too late for this season,
but not too soon to start thinking
about the next.

"I really believe that when she is
healthy she has the ability to chal
lenge for the NCAA national all
around title," Smyth said. "You will
definitely be hearing about Allyse
next year."
How has this experience changed
her? For one, Ishino plans to major in
human biology.and she is considering
a career in orthopedic surgery or
sports medicine.
"1 love sports." Ishino said, "and
the opportunity to help athletes
through difficult times like the one 1
am going through now would be
amazing."
