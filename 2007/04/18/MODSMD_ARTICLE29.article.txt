# Jumping ship: sane or taboo?
## 
### 
It's October of 2(H)2, and, for a
time, all seems right with the
world.
The San Francisco Giants, my Gi
ants. are just seven outs away from
their first World Series Champi
onship since l l )54. three years before
they moved to the West Coast. It's a
great time to be alive, even if 1 am a
little nervous when Dusty Baker
takes starter Russ Ortiz out of the
game.
But we all know what happened
next: Scott Spczio. Rally Monkeys.
Thunder Stix. Robb Nen's arm, hang
ing by a thread, and giving out on the
sport's biggest stage.
The years following the 2002
heartbreaker have marked a gradual
descent into mediocrity. Old fa
vorites like J. T. Snow, Nen and Beni
to Santiago were replaced by new
clubhouse cancers like Shea Hillen
brand. Armando Bcnitez and AJ
Pierzynski as the Giants made their
gradual descent into the realms of
mediocrity and hopelessness.
In recent years, frustration among
fans has largely stemmed from a
complete lack of young hitting talent
within the organization, which has
forced the Giants time and again to
either trade away promising young
pitchers or overpay for veterans. It
doesn't make for a pretty payroll
when the last true hitter an organiza
tion has developed is 30-year-old
Pedro Feliz.
So. the strategy in 2007, after the
big-stick free agents went elsewhere,
was to overcompensatc with pitch
ing. But the new. old-look Giants
with their $126 million man, Barry
Zito, got off to a glacially slow start,
winning just two of their first nine
and scoring 20 runs over that span.
Before mid-April, my Giants looked
dead in the water.
Which raises an important ques
tion sports fans everywhere have to
face at some time or another: When is
it okay to just give up? Not abandon
your rooting interests, per se, but ac
knowledge them as lost causes, at
least for the immediate future.
Everybody's favorite team at
some point finds itself in the gutter.
(Unless you just love the Yankees. In
that case, just substitute the Knicks.)
And I have to admit, it's been
tempting to give up on San Francisco
this year. There's a certain peace of
mind you can achieve. Suddenly,
you're just watching the games as an
innocent, indifferent bystander. If

you expect the worst, you'll never be
disappointed.
But you also won't be able to stay
interested for very long.
If you're a sports fan at Stanford,
you already know what 1 mean.don't
you? We all know where the football
program has been recently, and so
we know what it is to not just be mis
erable on the field, but also without
hope for the future. It's that kind of
perfect storm that drives fans to lose
interest and empties stadiums â€”
even the shiny new ones.
Hope is the great equalizer in
sports. It's trite, but true, that Stan
ford and USC are currently tied atop
the Pacific-10 Conference 2007 foot
ball standings at 0-0. As the 2002 An
gels. 2003 Marlins or 2001 New Eng
land Patriots could tell you, that's

why we play the game.The offseason
contests of dollars and cents that
control who wins on paper some
times have no bearing on who wins
on the field.
Sometimes, though, it's all about
your frame of mind. The Giants, to
spite my early premonitions of a sea
son already lost, have been battling
back of late. After scoring just 20 runs
over their first nine games, the G
men had put up 16 over their past
two games heading into Tuesday
night's matchup. The multi-million
dollar zen master, Barry Zito himself,
even contributed to the mini-revival,
shutting out the Rockies in Colorado
over six innings. Oh, and the Cardinal
has a new football coach.
That may not be a deluge of good
news, but it's a start. And it's proba
bly enough for me to stay interested.
I'm just crazy enough to believe.
