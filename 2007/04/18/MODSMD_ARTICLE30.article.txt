### SARA LANNIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A whopping 11 of the 31 Stanford
women's lacrosse players are fresh
men. And this season, those freshmen
have wasted no time leaving their
mark on the program. Following are
brief looks at each of the girls Cardi
nal fans will be hearing about for sea
sons to come:
Julie Christy, Lauren Schmidt — Midfield
Christy, a Pennsylvania native, has
scored six goals and assisted five this
season for Stanford. A captain, three
time team MVP and First-Team Ail-
American during her high-school ca
reer. she led her team to three
straight state championships. Thus
far, the Division 1 experience has
been everything Christy has hoped
for.
"1 had expectations it would be re
ally intense and a faster pace, and it
definitely has been." she said. "But
it's also been more fun because it's
been more challenging,and the entire
team actually takes things seriously
because we have to."
A highlight was against Vander
bilt, when Christy assisted fellow
freshman Dana Lindsay's game-win

ning goal vvitli less than 10 seconds
left. Make no mistake: The freshmen
had arrived.
"When playing Vanderbilt, we
won in the last 10 seconds, and 1 had
the assist to another freshman"
Christy said. "It was nice for all of us
because it was freshman to freshman.
It was definitely a defining moment
of the season for me."
Schmidt is also stepping up for the
Cardinal. The midfielder from Bay
Shore, N.Y. leads the squad with 22
points. And while her five-goal outing
against St. Mary's earned her MPSF-
Player of the Week honors in Febru
ary. Schmidt knows life exists after
the whistle.
"The chemistry within our class is so
awesome." she said. "Not only do we
have a way of just finding each other
in games, but they are also my best
friends outside of lacrosse."
