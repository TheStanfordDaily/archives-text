### ANDREA FULLER MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITERS 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate voted 12-1 last night against hold
ing a runoff between the two top ex
ecutive slates of last week's elections,
overruling a motion brought to the
council by Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08.
Before a packed audience of sen
ators and undergraduate students,
Fraga advised the Senate at yester
day's meeting to hold a runoff be
tween executive-elect Avula/Jones
and runner-up Brett and Lakshmi.
1 le cited an amendment to the ASSU
Constitution, which stipulates that a

two-slate runoff must be held if no
ticket receives a majority of votes in
i he election.
Senate leaders, however, were
quick to point out that the ASSU by
laws allow the Senate and Graduate
Student Council (CISC) to overrule
the Elections Commissioner's rec
ommendation with a two-thirds vote.
Senate Chair and ASSIJ Presi
dent-elect Hershey Avula "OS and
senator and Vice President-elect
Mondaire Jones '09 had resigned
trom the Senate at the beginning of
the meeting to comply with a bylaw
that prevents students from holding
both senate and executive positions.
