## Fraga proposes runoff but 12 ASSU senators cite Joint Byaws and overrule recommendation 
### ANDREA FULLER MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITERS 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate voted 12-1 last night against hold
ing a runoff between the two top ex
ecutive slates of last week's elections,
overruling a motion brought to the
council by Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08.
Before a packed audience of sen
ators and undergraduate students,
Fraga advised the Senate at yester
day's meeting to hold a runoff be
tween executive-elect Avula/Jones
and runner-up Brett and Lakshmi.
1 le cited an amendment to the ASSU
Constitution, which stipulates that a

two-slate runoff must be held if no
ticket receives a majority of votes in
i he election.
Senate leaders, however, were
quick to point out that the ASSU by
laws allow the Senate and Graduate
Student Council (CISC) to overrule
the Elections Commissioner's rec
ommendation with a two-thirds vote.
Senate Chair and ASSIJ Presi
dent-elect Hershey Avula "OS and
senator and Vice President-elect
Mondaire Jones '09 had resigned
trom the Senate at the beginning of
the meeting to comply with a bylaw
that prevents students from holding
both senate and executive positions.
As a result they could not vote, hut all eight of their fel
low Students of Color Coalition (SOCC)-endorsed sen
ators voted against a runoff. Senator Danny Arbeiter '08
was the sole dissenter.
The GSC will vote on the runoff tonight.
In an interview with The Daily. Jones downplayed the
elections controversy.
"I feel that the real story tonight was [Israel] divest
ment." he said [See "ASSU rejects divestment", pg. I|.
"The issue discussed tonight was really just a technicali
ty. Even Brett and Lakshmi agree with the decision that
both bodies came to."
However, sources close to the campaigns told The
Daily that the Senate vote was preceded by behind-the
scenes political maneuvering by Avula and Jones and ;it
least one closed-door meeting with a University admin
istrator.
Fraga said he felt compelled to call for a runoff as stip
ulated by the Constitution.
"A literal definition of the wording states that a ma
jority of votes in the election must vote "yes' or rank [the
winning slate] in the situation of an instant runoff be
tween the Executive slates," Fraga said. "The obligation
is to hold a runoff [within 14 days] because that threshold
was not met."
Fraga defined a "majority" as a majority of total votes,
and not as a majority of votes for the Executive slates. In
fifth-round voting. Avula/Jones received 2.85(i votes. 68
votes short of a majority because many students ab
stained.The slate did. however, receive a majority of the

4,525 executive
slate votes cast.
Avula/Jones re
ceived 38 more
votes than oppo
nents Brett Mam
mon 'OcS and Laksh
mi karra "OS in the
fourth round.
Senate mem
bers vigorously de
bated whether or
not to overrule
Fraga's suggestion
after he told them
about the runoff.
Some senators

said they worried
that voter turnout, especially among graduate students,
would be lower in a second election. Avula/Jones re
ceived strong support from the graduate population in
the first election.
"Grad student turnout would be atrocious were they
to have another election." Jones said, "'lliis is a time for
mending, not for increased polarization."
Incoming senator Luukas lives'o9 contested the issue
of graduate student turnout.
"I don't think the Undergraduate Senate needs to
concern itself with the turnout of graduate students." lie
said. " That's a problem for the (ISC. If you want the stu
dent body represented, then the vote needs to be a ma
jority."
Senator Priyanka Goel "07 said that Fraga's concerns
did not merit a special election.
"1 just think that this is a technicality." she said. "We
have gotten an amazing number of people to vote. There
should not be a runoff."
Nkemjika Ugonabo '() l ), who was filling in as senate

chair for Avula. encouraged the Senate to use its power
to overrule Fraga's suggestion.
"If there are significant concerns as to the outcome of
a special election " she said, "we have the responsibility
and the power to overrule the recommendation of the
Elections Commission."
I lammon. who attended the meeting, said he played
no role in bringing the idea of a runoff to the table I le
said a former member of the Constitutional Council con
tacted him and Fraga.
"I respect the judgment of the Senate and the (JSC."
he said. " Iliis is a very rare case in terms of a lot of peo
ple abstaining. Let the bodies do their job. It the bodies
decide against a runoff. I'm not going to go kicking or
screaming. It not. Hershey and Mondaire will be verv

good executives."
"It there is a runoff, I
would like to run."he
added, "and if there's not a
runoff, then I will be happy
to devote my energy to an
other worthy cause."
Jones commended
Mammon for his com
ments.
"1 think it was really big
of Brett to come and say
that," he said.
While most of the Un
dergraduate Senate
agreed with the election
results, Arheiter said he

thought the Senate had overstepped its powers.
"It comes down to a matter of interpretation of the
governing documents." Arbeiter said. "Bernard ab
solutely did the right thing in deciding to hold a runoff
election. The letter of Constitutional law says that is what
he is supposed to do. I think it's ambiguous as to whether
the Undergraduate Senate in this case has the preroga
tive to overrule that decision."
More than two-thirds of the members on the GSC
must vote against a second round of balloting for Fraga's
proposal to die.
If the GSC votes for the runoff,"then there's no form
of recourse for the declared victors to take," Arbeiter
said. On the other hand, if the GSC votes down the
runoff, "someone could file suit in the Constitutional
Council, making the argument that this is not a case in
which the Senate has the option of overruling the Elec
tions Commission."
