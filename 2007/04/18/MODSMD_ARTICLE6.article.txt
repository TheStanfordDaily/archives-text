## Webmail features enhanced Students increasingly rely on external clients 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Information Technology
Services (ITS) administrators intro
duced the newly modified Webmail
Beta email system last week, they
hoped the change would draw a fa
vorable response. But with more and
more incoming students using exter
nal email clients like Microsoft Out
look and Gmail. many either have
not noticed or are unaffected by the
program's new features.
With a number of upgraded com
ponents and new color schemes, the
new Webmail offers a dramatically
different version of the old email sys
tem. Additional changes include a
new left-side menu bar, a Stanford
email address search option as well
as additional email filters and mes
sage options. Users can now also
check their email through Personal
Digital Assistants (PDAs).
ITS has been working throughout
the year to develop upgrades to Web
mail. and last week's launch marked
the culmination of their efforts.
"It was definitely an initiative that
spanned our organization," said ITS
Director of Strategic Planning and
Communications Nancy Ware. "We
had individuals from across our or
ganization working to make it hap
pen."
Hie upgrades came largely in re
sponse to input and feedback ITS
had collected from students and staff
over the years regarding problems
with the old system. Ware said.
According to Residential Com
puting Network and Systems Ad
ministrator Ethan Rikleen, however,
the upgraded system may not have
the wide-ranging effects ITS admin
istrators were hoping for.
"The way Stanford students
check mail has really changed," Rik
leen said, referring to the increasing
numbers of students choosing to au
tomatically forward their email from
Webmail to an outside service. I le said he has noticed a
spike in this trend over the past 18 months.
"The more students grow up using Yahoo! Mail and
Gmail before they even get here, the more comfortable
they become with it," Rikleen said.
While they are increasingly popular amongst stu
dents, outside email services create a headache for ad
ministrators due to the greater anonymity they provide
their users. Rikleen said.
Some students say their propensity to use alternative
email options is driven largely by inefficiencies they see
in the Webmail system.
"I've always encouraged my residents to move to
Gmail or some other client-based system." said Edwin
Chiu '07. resident computer consultant (RCC) in Twain.
"I'm glad they're updating [Webmail] because the old
system wasn't well suited for day-to-day use."
Preliminary student reactions to the Webmail
changes have been largely influenced by the shift to
wards independent email services.
"Personally. I don't see much of a change because I
use Outlook and I don't even see Webmails site." said
Betai Koffi'lo.
While it remains to be seen whether the modifications
in Webmail will lure back students who have shifted to
other services. I TS continues to research communication

strategies for the future but has not yet announced any
additional upgrades.
"We're not planning any [other] feature or function
changes," Ware said, "but we
constantly monitor all of our products and if we need to
make changes to the existing
product we can."
