On Monday morning, tragedy befell the nation, when a senior at Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 students before killing himself. The
tragic reverberations of the shooting were silently felt yesterday on Stanford's campus. The flag at half-mast, the increased police
presence in White Plaza and an impromptu prayer basket in Memorial Church all served as recurring reminders of the senselessness
of violence. The Office for Religious Life has planned a Gathering for Reflection and Prayer for today from 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
