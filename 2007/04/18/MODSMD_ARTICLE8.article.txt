# STUDENT LIFE
## Student-run political Web site introduced Political blog maintained by students exclusively 
### JORDAN CHAZIN 
Students who have difficulty finding
time to follow the upcoming presidential
election take note: An entirely student-run,
politically-minded web site will soon pro
vide an accessible forum for election news

and coverage.
TheScoopoB.com — which is scheduled
to launch in August — will be a student
blog with a staff comprised exclusively of
politically-involved high school and col
lege students.
Co-founded by Andrew Mangino, a
sophomore at Yale, and Alexander Heffn
er.a high school junior at Phillips Academy,
the web site will be a go-to source for all
students: Those who are politically active
can contribute to the site, while their less

knowledgeable peers can visit the site for
information about the election.
"TTieScoopoB.com has the potential to
be to the 2(M)S election what the live televi
sion debate was to the l%() election, in
which John F. Kennedy gained tremendous
amounts of popularity by playing to the
camera, upstaging a withdrawn Richard
Nixon," said Mangino. who is also presi-
dent and editor-in-chief of the site.
"This is a turning point in history.and
the world is dying for leadership."
Mangino, who believes
TheScoopoB.com will provide stu
dents with a medium to share their
political passions,said the site will be
open to everyone.
"We're looking for students
everywhere, regardless of where they
go to school." he said. "We're trying
to promote an open forum of ideas
for people who are passionate about
politics, sociology, journalism and
writing."
Despite Mangino's optimism,
however, some Stanford students

have questioned the benefits of such
a resource.
Nellie Selander '07. former presi
dent and current board member of
the Stanford Democrats, said she is
skeptical of the site's place in the po
litical arena.
"People who would look for a
web site like this are already interest
ed and informed in politics." she said.
"It doesn't seem to be really filling an
empty niche. There are a million
blogs out there."
Others acknowledge the potential
value of the site, however.
"The fact that so much informa
tion about the election is centralized
on one site is convenient." said Neil
Lakin '09. who researched political
activism on college campuses for his
Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) research paper.
Lakin said that Stanford students

— who his research showed were
generally engaged and interested in
politics — may not need the site as
much as the average college student.
"Stanford students are more po
litically aware than they give them
selves credit for." he said. "You al
ways hear students describing them
selves as politically apathetic, living
in the "Stanford Bubble.' but walking
through White Plaza and seeing the
variety of flyers put up by student
groups.you realize that students here
are in fact very passionate about po
litical issues."
nieScoopoB.com will launch on
Aug. <S. Students interested in con
