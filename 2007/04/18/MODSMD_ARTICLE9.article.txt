## SLAC fast continues Second meeting with Hennessy fails to produce concrete results 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Representatives from the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) met with President John Hennessy
for the second time in two days yesterday to discuss the
University's living wage policy for contracted workers.
But the "ongoing negotiations," as SLAC calls them,
have yet to produce any concrete results, raising ques
tions about how long protesting students can maintain
their fast, which has now reached its seventh day.
SLAC members will meet with representatives from
Human Resources today and plan to meet with Hen
nessy again later this week.
One week ago, five students initiated a fast to high
light their concerns with the University's current livine
wage policy, which they claim does
not sufficiently meet contracted
workers' needs. Twelve members of
SI.AC are now participating in the
hunger strike. University officials
said yesterday, however, that the fast
did not influence the president's de
cision to meet with SLAC members.
"1 think the one point they really
stressed to the students is that the
president would have met with them
whether they fast or not," said Uni
versity spokesperson Kate Chesley.
"To some degree, people are simply
worried about their health and want
them to know that they don't have to
fast to meet with the University."
SLAC spokesperson Matt Seriff-

Cullick '08 disagreed and called the
University's statement that the fast
had not prompted their decision to
meet "disingenuous."
"We have been sending emails to
them for years and we have been re
fused over and over," he said. "No
one has forced these students to fast
except the situation where they feel
strongly about something."
SLAC members have called on
the University to agree to implement
immediate changes that would in
crease the salaries of contracted
workers currently exempt from the
living wage policy. Students at yes
terday's meeting provided 1 lennessy
with a document that Seriff-Cullick
called a "reformatted code of con
duct." It specified a number of policy
changes that SLAC would like to see
implemented.
In a press release issued last night,
the University said the 'code of con

duct' went "far beyond the scope of
any discussions appropriate between
[SLAC] and the University."
"[Hennessy] recognizes that it's a
document of great conviction."
Chesley said, "but that it goes far be
yond the living wage issue."
SLAC members said the fast
would continue until their concerns
expressed in the document are ad
dressed in a concrete manner.
"We want to see signs of imple
mentation immediately," Seriff-Cul
lick said. "We want to see a concrete
and immediate timeline for imple
mentation."
