## Editorial Board Take Admit Weekend with a grain of salt 
### 
Love it or hate it. Admit Weekend is
once again upon us. Starting today
and carrying on through the week
en J. hundreds of prospective freshmen will
he scouring the campus to see if Stanford is
the right fit for them. Yet. the question aris
es: Exactly what view of Stanford are
ProFros getting?
Admit Weekend is considered by many
to be an abbreviated version of New Stu
dent Orientation (NSO), a week-long
"summer camp" held at the beginning of
every school year, filled with bonding ac
tivities and dorm cheers. Admit Weekend,
too. is characterized by a certain hyper-en
ergy. with dorm flags waving in the air and
fountain hopping galore.
While this can be highly enjoyable for
ProFros. the nature of Admit Weekend's
festivities is debatable. On the Editorial
Board alone, we sat divided 3-3 between
"absolutely hating" Admit Weekend, and
feeling it was "one of the best weekends of
my life." It is our opinion that, whether
Admit Weekend nearly made you choose
another school or whether Admit Week
end alone made you fall in love with Stan
ford. it does not accurately portray our
school. Over the weekend, the notion may
arise that among the myriad of events and
social activities offered, nobody here goes
to class or works hard—or that they are ac
ademically serious. This is. of course, far
from the truth.
To the credit of the organizers. Admit
Weekend is typically well-run, with enthu
siastic Hollos and RoHos. The task of ar
ranging mini-courses, housing, dining and

events like Hoi loPalooza is enormous, and
the coordinators of Admit Weekend should
be commended. They have undoubtedly
put in numerous man-hours to ensure the
success of the Weekend, known along with
Reunion Homecoming, NSO, Parents'
Weekend and Commencement as part of
the "Big 5" annual events on campus. While
some elements of the weekend may seem
contrived —the rampant use of acronyms
and excessive dorm pride—these are in ac
tuality. a part of what Stanford really is.
But Admit Weekend also presents a
falsely idyllic view of Stanford in which stu
dents are perpetually happy and frolicking
outdoors with very little school work to do.
Also, the campus is officially dry this week
end. resulting in an atypical weekend social
scene. It is true here, like at the majority of
schools with whom we compete for these
students, that drinking is a part of the social
scene. The absence of a Senior Night this
weekend, for example, skews what a Pro Fro
might perceive as an "average weekend"
during the rest of the school year.
To members of the incoming class of
2011 who are taking the time to read this
editorial, take all you see around you with
a grain of salt. Engage in lengthy conversa
tions about Stanford with your RoHo and
110 l 10. but also don't be afraid to approach
random students, while waiting in line at
Jamba Juice or in the Bookstore, to get
their candid opinions on the University. We
have had good experiences here, but by
talking to as many people as possible and
sitting in on classes during the day, you'll
get a better idea of the "real" Stanford.
