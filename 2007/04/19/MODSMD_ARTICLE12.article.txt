# To have and to Hannity
## 
### 
My girlfriend and 1 are on the rocks.
I'm not a close-minded or judg
mental person or anything. In fact,
as a college-educated youth, I find myself
an example of the open-minded liberalism
that is a benefit of upper-tier universities.
Whether it be frisbee or foreplay, I'll give
anything a try once.
Hut then the unthinkable happened.
My girlfriend is interviewing for a job at
Fox News. She claimed she needed the
money; she wanted a job in New York. I
told her that going to New York and work
ing at Fox News was like going to Tavern
On the Green and ordering the corndog.
I admit, that was a bit harsh. After taking
a few sips of my herbal tea and repeating the
instructions my yoga instructor keeps
telling me. 1 achieved enough chi to ask her
to explain herself more. I was calm. 1 was as
open as a window.
I"hey contacted her and the job paid well.
ITiey spoke highly of her accomplishments,
and why couldn't I be supportive of her?
What was so bad about Fox News?
I snapped my chi like a Slim Jim. I began
to regress into an infantile version of my
self. I was angry, betrayed, and began mak
ing Star Wars references. 1 told her I felt
like Queen Amidala: "Oh sure, Anakin,
hang out with that Senator Palpatine char
acter. seems like a good influence." 'ITien
next thing I know she'll be watching Hill
O'Reilly and killing Jedi babies left and
right!
Granted, she isn't as knowledgeable
about politics, or Star Wars, as I am. Where
as I can list a dozen or so moments of jour
nalistic bias or downright lying, she knows
very little about Fox News and had to do re
search before the interview. She had to
Wikipedia the network program lineup in
case they asked about her favorite show.
She chose to say "Hannity and Colmes" if
prompted I went into a somewhat inarticu
late rant about how I lannity basically dom
inated Colmes. making him a strawman for
the Republican right's self-righteous con
spiracy laden rhetoric. I lost my train of
thought, though, because I had managed to
break the coffee cup in my hand and the tea
was now burning my flesh. I hadn't noticed.
Twitch.
After she helped bandage my arm. I
smiled and tried to further explain to her
why. rationally, working at the network was
wrong. In order to prove their bias I asked
her about the questions the interviewer
;isked: Was there a political litmus test? Did
they ask about the radical views of her
boyfriend? Did they ask her who she was
voting for in 2(X)8? Did they ask about me at
all?
Her answers disappointed me because
their questions were not only tame, but bad.
They didn't ask about her views on supply
side economics, the Iraq War,or her own ex
periences as a "culture warrior." Instead.

they asked her yes-or-no questions about
her resume. Not "tell me about your experi
ence" but "you did this, right?" This makes
for a very easy interview, but it also suggests
that, if you can believe this. Fox News wasn't
doing their research. Or maybe, Fox already
knows what she's done because of their vast
wiretapping networks and elaborate con
servative conspiracy. When I checked her
blouse for microphones. I knew I'd lost my
chi. Also, her respect.
She called me close-minded. Me! I was
the definition of open-minded. Whether
you be liberal, libertarian, moderate or pro
gressive. I 'II be happy to hear your divergent
views. 1 pontificate on how much Hush sucks
without pausing for breath. I lecture her
constantly on the evils of a biased media
group and I stare indignantly at Rush Lim
baugh bumper stickers. I'm the fucking def
inition of open-minded.
I had every right to be angry. Fox News is
evil and I don't want her corrupted by that.
I like how my girlfriend keeps me balanced,
but I don't want a "fair and balanced" girl
friend.
1 began to wonder what it would be like
for her to work there. It was too much to
hope for that she would in on my secret
quest to destroy the station—an inside
woman in my quest to point out the absurd
ity and falsity of the network, a network that
most of my family watches on a regular
basis. I couldn't ask her to slip Rush Lim
baugh more prescription drugs or correct
them every time they list Mark Foley as a
Democrat. One intern can't collate the evil
away.
So I wondered what it would be like to
date one of them. A "fair and balanced" girl
friend would certainly be very different, and
not just because right now she keeps getting
into skateboarding accidents.
I was frightened that this could tear our
relationship apart. She was seeking employ
ment at a corporation of pure evil. I found
her innocence was conflicting with my ra
tional, open-minded run-of-the-mill college
liberalism that demanded such a strict knee
jerk reaction that it impaired my ability to
behave like a social human being. Damn
you Rupert Murdoch, damn you.

So I wondered what it would be like to
date one of them. A "fair and balanced" girl
friend would certainly be very different, and
not just because right now she keeps getting
into skateboarding accidents.
I was frightened that this could tear our
relationship apart. She was seeking employ
ment at a corporation of pure evil. I found
her innocence was conflicting with my ra

liberalism that demanded such a strict knee
jerk reaction that it impaired my ability to
behave like a social human being. Damn
you Rupert Murdoch, damn you.
