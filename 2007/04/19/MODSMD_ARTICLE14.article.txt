# The
						best things in life are improvised
## 
### 
We study hard for weeks. We plan
months ahead of time. We plan to
study so that we can maximize the ef
ficiency of our all too few studying hours.
In high school, we primed ourselves for col
legiate rigor, taking all the AP classes that exist
ed. Now in college, we ready ourselves once
again for the cutthroat competitiveness of grad
school by taking MCAT classes, writing a thesis
and studying for the GRHs.
It seems we perpetually prepare for the soon
to-be. the promised bigger and better subse
quent stages of life. Admittedly, so far our for
ward-looking planning mania has paid off —
we do attend this large, good college. Although
I thank myself for all my hard work and fore
thought. the truth of the matter is that the best
things in life — the ones that are the most fun
and the most satisfying — are improvised.
It makes sense that tun stuff is improvised. No
one likes researching coral bacterium for
months or balancing a checkbook — we have
to force ourselves to do these things. We are all
creatures of immediacy, hedonists hiding in
paper-thin shells of rational thought. It's why
America can't seem to figure out weight-loss
(eat less, move more), or plan for retirement
(save a little bit of money over a long while).
With improvisation, there is no waiting, delayed
results,or ridiculously bopping away on an ellip
tical— just immediate response and crisp ef
fects. Nothing is more elegant and satisfying
than the directness of thought to execution.
For example, the sports that are the most fun
to watch, and to play for that matter, are impro
vised. Basketball, volleyball, football and six'-
cer:These sports rely on the ability of their play
ers to adapt.react and think on their feet — tak

ing that idiom to all of its literal capacity. No of
fense swimmers, rowers and runners out there,
but I bet your competition will end with one
person/team going faster than another
person/team. You'll never believe the regatta 1
saw. guys, by the end. one boat went past two
buoys the soonest! It is the thrill of dunks, fast
breaks, spikes, amazing digs, incredible blocks,
unthinkable passes and unreal interceptions
that make these sports fascinating and keep the
bleachers packed.
In jazz, improvisation reigns supreme. Any
one can hit chords, and in fact a computer can do
it better than any human, but to respond to
other musicians and seamlessly quilt together
notes and riffs is the mark of a master jazz artist.
Dancing, doodling and. dare I say it. sex. are all
unrehearsed. Perhaps the greatest example of
common spontaneity, however, is conversation.
Hanging out. flirting, catching up with old
friends — conversation is enjoyable because of
the risk that accompanies responding to the un
known and the pleasure of successfully doing so.
ITiere is nothing worse than listening to a
forced, "really funny" story, which inevitable
ends up being over-worked,over-told and whol
ly humorless.There is nothing greater, however,
than a group of friends discovering a moment of

hilarity together, the energy tangibly escalating,
brimming up and over as the group builds from
a brainstorm to a breakthrough.
Granted, the pleasure of conversation can
easily become the dread of small talk: First dates
are nerve-racking and flirting can be disastrous
ly embarrassing. But 1 think it is because these
potentially awkward situations are often the
most rehearsed. Although meant to ease the di
alogue. "What do you study?", "What are you
interested in?", "Where are you from?" and
other obligator} formalities inhibit the improv
isation of just plain ol' talking — these conven
tional conversations become the most staged,
and then the most awkward and boring. Any
thing that is overworked starts to wilt and lose
its pizzazz — Michael Jackson's nose stands as a
potent example.
Admittedly, even in conversation there are
rules to follow and practice to be had — good
conversationalists don't interrupt and listen
closely. Likewise, sports, karate and the saxo
phone take years of lessons before improvisa
tion is a possibility.
But for us type-A long-time overachievers.
perhaps this improvisational paradox is easy for
us to understand — we are good at isolating and
attaining goals, even if we're working towards
spontaneity. For now. let's rehearse our improv
isation by seeking out the new. accepting mis
takes and remembering our trials and errors for
future off-the-cuff moments. That way. next
time someone asks me for an impromptu pres
entation. to play a game of pick-up, or be on the
next "Iron Chef," I'll be more than readv for it.
