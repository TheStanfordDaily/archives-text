## SLAC asks too much 
### DIANE PECK 
Dear Editor:
Yesterday the University provided the Daily
with a statement regarding the discussions be
tween President I lennessy and the Student
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC). The Daily
correctly reported that SLAC had introduced
into the discussions what SLAC's leadership
called a "reformatted code of conduct."
The Daily also correctly stated that the Uni
versity believed the code of conduct went "far
beyond the scope of any discussions appropri
ate between (SLAC] and the University."
Unfortunately, the Daily did not include in
its article what this "code of conduct" calls for.
The four-page document includes elements
that dictate budget procedures and priorities
for Stanford departments, requirements for a
variety of new reporting and monitoring sys
tems, changes in benefit programs for Stanford
employees, as well as the creation of an organi
zation "independent of the Stanford Universi
ty administration" to be responsible for em
ployment practices at the University.
Such a document and the discussions to date
are clear indicators that SLAC has an agenda
that exceeds the scope of the living wage poli

cy —which was the understood topic of these
meetings with President Hennessy—and. in
some cases, indeed exceeds the authority of
President I lennessy s purview. Even so. Presi
dent Hennessy recognizes and respects that
some students are passionate about living wage
issues. But the facts belie much of the rhetoric
that has been used without qualification in re
cent days.
1. The University is taking the extraordinary
step of migrating temporary and casual em
ployees to living wage rates, a process that will
be completed by the end of this fiscal year
(Sept. 1,2007).
2.The living wage policy also covers employees
of contractors that do work at the University
Yes, there are some exclusions that the univer
sity believes are reasonable, but still, hundreds
of employees of university contractors have
been beneficiaries of the University's living
wage policy. 1 laving said that, the University is
still willing to consider further modifications to
the policy.
3. The demands made by SLAC include
items—such as allowing union-card checks in
stead of elections for union representation—
that are not part of the generous and fair pack

age that the union recommended and workers
approved last summer.
4. President 1 knnessy has met twice with rep
resentatives of SLAC. heard their concerns,
and is willing to have university representatives
continue the dialogue as long as the dialogue
and the behavior of SLAC remains civil. Fast
ing is not necessary for dialogue to continue.
5. Even the lowest-paid of Stanford's regular
employees receive salaries and benefits signifi
cantly higher than living wage polices that are
in effect in various cities and counties in the Bay
Area.
Finally, regardless of how heartfelt an indi
vidual's opinion may be on these or any other
issues, it is not a substitute for thoughtful deci
sion-making.
President I lennessy is certainly mindful of
SLAC"s opinions and concerned for the health
and well-being of those students who have cho
sen to last. But intense feelings and strong opin
ions cannot be the sole basis for making deci
sions that affect the health and well-being of
the entire university.
