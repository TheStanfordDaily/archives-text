# Our Stanford Challenge
## 
### 
As Stanford educators, we are glad to see
students in the Stanford I .abor Action Coali
tion resurrecting the movement for a real liv
ing wage at Stanford. Although we are very
concerned for their health, the students and
others who have fasted this week present the
university with a challenge that is the flipside
to the fundraising campaign known as the
Stanford Challenge. We can relate the living
wage campaign specifically to the tenets of
the Stanford Challenge: educating leaders,
seeking solutions to pressing problems, and
sustaining a foundation of excellence.
1) Educating Leaders: We feel that hon
esty and truthfulness are key to academic in
quiry in any discipline, qualities that we hope
to pass on to our students as much as possible.
We should be open about what our values and
policies are and the reasons for having them.
In the same spirit, we should either be open
and honest about why we are not having a liv
ing wage policy, or we should have a living
wage policy that is true to its name. The cur
rent state of affairs strikes us as dishonest: a
living wage policy with so many restrictions
that it excludes many of those who most need
it. It suggests that we as the university com

munity are more concerned with our image
than with the well-being of those that make
up this community.
In 2(K)4.a Presidential Advisory Committee
looked at Stanford labor policies and made a
number of recommendations. We think that
these recommendations should be acted upon:
Among other things, 4 of the 7 restrictions on
the living wage policy should be removed. If
these recommendations continue to be ig
nored, what educational message are we send
ing to the future leaders we are educating? That
honest critical inquiry and discussion of values
can make a difference, but not at Stanford?
II) Seeking Solutions: It is clear that
questions of how to distribute scarce resources
w ill always be difficult to resolve. A living wage,
health care benefits,educational opportunities,
etc. would require the university to re-allocate
money. But an open discussion about these dif
ficult trade-offs is another aspect of the kind of
education we should provide to our students.
With a commitment to just labor policies
and a realization of limited resources, we can
surely find the creative and financial solutions
to improve the situation of many low-paid
workers. Teaching our students to look for

these kinds of creative solutions is.again,part of
what a Stanford education should he all about.
Ill) Sustaining a Foundation of Excel
lence: One foundation of the excellence of
this university is its students. As faculty mem
bers. we are impressed and humbled by the
initiative, energy and perseverance of those
students who have worked hard on improv
ing the situation of the low-paid workers at
Stanford. It is this tradition of excellence that
we wish to sustain at our university.
