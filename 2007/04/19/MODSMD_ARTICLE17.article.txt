## Int'l report: Dire warnings on climate Schneider details disputes on wording 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
A comprehensive report by the
United Nations-sponsored Inter
governmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) adopted at a con
ference in Brussels earlier this
month has ominous predictions
for the Earth's future.
"In North America, there will
be heat waves, intensified hurri
canes. melting snow and glaciers,
and the redistribution of plants
and animals with the threat of en
dangerment," said biological sci
ences Prof. Stephen Schneider,
who is also a senior fellow at the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment. "Water supply will become
a problem.There will be the prob
lem of floods if the snow melts too
early in the year and then you
have a longer, drier summer,
which is a risk for drought and
wildfire."
Schneider said that Stanford
would be affected by longer heat
waves and poorer air quality in
the summers due to increased fos
sil fuel use and more pollutants
trapped in the atmosphere.

Schneider authored a chapter
in the IPCC report, entitled "Key
Vulnerabilities and the Risk of
Climate Change." which provides
general formulas for determining
how to prioritize climate control
efforts based on factors such as ir
reparability, fairness and magni
tude of impact.
"(Scientists] never tell policy
makers what to do." Schneider
said. "We tell them the risks â€”
that is. what can happen and what
are the odds. We give [policymak
ers] ways to react to the problem
that are rational and consistent."
Schneider spoke to the U.S.
House Committee on Science and
Technology yesterday about the
report, which is the fourth install
ment of a series that began in 1990.
According to Schneider, dele
gates at the Brussels conference
had varying opinions about what
the report should say. Represen
tatives from smaller countries
wanted the report's tone to be
more hard-hitting in order to
prompt more drastic changes.This
sentiment, he said, was not as pop
ular among larger countries.
"In a country like Saudi Arabia
that wants to sell oil or China that
wants to burn coal, they're trying
to make the report weaker,"
Schneider said. "Countries try to
spin the report up or down de

pending on their national inter
ests. The reason there were UK)
countries and 50 authors [at the
conference] was to fight it out and
get the report balanced."
Delegates often bickered over
the exact wording of several pas
sages. according to Schneider.
Strong phrases such as "virtually
certain" were changed to "pro
jected" or "is likely" in a variety of
places throughout the report.
Schneider estimated that 20
percent of the report was "spun a
little too far." weakening it more
than the authors would have
liked. Saudi Arabia and China
were responsible for most of the
"spinning." while the United
States was relatively supportive,
he said.
"The U.S.. much to my pleasant
surprise, was actually very sup
portive of about N5 percent of it."
Schneider said. "Given the Hush
Administration's history, we
thought that was spectacular."
Schneider remains optimistic
that a bipartisan solution to cli
mate change is possible.
"There's no such thing as a Re
publican wildfire or a Democratic
wildfire." he said. "We have to
solve these problems collectively."
