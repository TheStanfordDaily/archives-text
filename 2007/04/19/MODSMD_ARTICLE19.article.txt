MEN'S TENNIS

Anyone would agree that the Stanford
men's tennis team lias gone through its share
of trials and challenges this season. These
tests have resulted in a weathered team that
doesn't falter, and this perseverance played
in the ('ai d's favor on Tuesday when Stanford
earned its first shutout win of the season,
blanking Pacific 7-0.
Although Stanford (8-15) didn 't get off to
as dominant a start as its doubles perform
ance this season suggested it could have, the
team still got the job done and went on to
sweep singles against the Tigers (2-17).
1 told the guys that this match was one of
the 'trap' matches." head coach John
Whitlinger said. "You have the Pepperdine.
USC and UCI.A matches, which are really
tough matches.and then the C'al match on the
other side on Saturday. Sometimes you get
trapped by not getting really mentally pre
pared for a Pacific match.
"I thought in doubles, we almost fell into
that trap." Whitlinger continued. "I didn't
think we played great doubles to be honest,
but we talked about it at halftime, and the
guys came out and played very well in sin
gles."
As the evening turned frigid, senior Eric
Mckean and freshman Richard Wire were
the first pair to complete their doubles
match. At the third doubles position, the pair
got down an early break and trailed 1-3. but
then won seven games in a row to pick up an
8-3 victory.
Sophomores Matt Bruch and Blake
Muller moved up to No. <S in this week's rank
ings after earning an 8-5 win over UCLA's
No. 7 Philipp Gruendler and Benjamin
Kohlloeffcl on Friday. I lowever. the Stanford
duo struggled on Tuesday, getting broken
halfway through the set and ultimately drop
ping the contest. 8-5.
With the count even at one apiece, the sec
ond doubles position would determine the di
rection of the match going into singles. Fresh
men Kevin Kaiser and Paul Morrissey led 7-
4. and after multiple deuces. Kaiser dished
out an unreturnable serve to give Stanford a
1 -0 edge.

After halftime,Stanford came out stronger
in singles against a predominantly interna
tional squad. Even in matches where Pacific
attempted to challenge the team, the Card
proved steadfast and responded to any test it
was faced with, recovering from any leads that
the Tigers managed to gain.
The second half of the lineup quickly post
ed two wins for the Cardinal. Kaiser picked
up an easy 6-1.6-ovictory at the fifth singles
position when his opponent dumped a back
hand slice in the net.
"If you look at the last couple weeks.
[Kevin's] probably the most improved player
on the team at the moment." Whitlinger said.
"He's had some very good wins in the past
couple weeks against some very good play
ers. and we'll sure as heck need the same kind
of performance from him on Saturday
[against Cal]."
McKean was next to come off the court
after only allowing his opponent two games.
Pacific's Alan Kelly double faulted and gave
McKean the win and Stanford's third point of
the day.
At the second singles position, Bruch was
up 5-4 and on set point when he worked his
opponent's backhand and had the opportuni
ty to put away a volley to take the first set.
After the tight 6-4 first set. Bruch breezed
through the second to pick up an easy 6-1 and
clinch the win for Stanford.
At the third singles spot, Muller's score
mirrored that of Bruch's. Muller won an easy
first set. 6-1. when Pacific's Vegerd Veskima
gi stretched for a volley and missed. In a clos
er second set. the Stanford sophomore
picked up the set. 6-4. and the win when yet
another Tiger double faulted on match point.

at the sixth and first singles positions, respec
tively. but boosted by a fan base braving the
bitter cold, both hung on to complete Stan

Morrissey dropped the first set but came

back to pick up the second and then the third

first. 6-3. but then trailed 1-4 in the second.

the breaker. Wire threw up a big
serve to go up 6-5 and then followed
it up at the end of the next point with
a low backhand slice crosscourt to
punctuate the win.
"| Rich) won the first set,and a lot
of times, he does start slowly in the
second set," Whitlinger said. "We've
talked about it, and we've worked
on it. He came back and won the sec
ond set in a tiebreaker, so that was
nice to see. [The set] didn't start the

way I wanted it to. but it ended the
way I wanted it to."
On Saturday at 1 p.m., Stanford
will take on No. 39 California at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium in its
final home match of the season. Sat
urday's match will also honor cap
tain McKean and classmate Dave
Ryan on Senior Day.
Although the Bears blanked
Stanford in March,Cal will take on a
more experienced and toughened
Cardinal squad this time around,
hopefully less hampered by injuries.
This match will also prove to be of
utmost importance, as Stanford will
need to close out its regular season
with a win if it is to have any shot at

making the NCAA tournament.
" This is a big match for both of
us." Whitlinger said."lf we have any
chance of getting into NCAAs. we
have to win this match, and it may
be the same for [Ca 11. If the (tour
nament selection|committee looks
at what we've done in the past cou
ple weeks, and we can get a win
over Cal, that might show them
something. That's what makes it
even more exciting besides the
Stanford/Cal rivalry â€” an NCAA
berth could be on the line for both
of us."
