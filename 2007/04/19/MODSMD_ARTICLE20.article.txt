a "fun meet" â€” the team
plans to relax on this trip. (ienerally, the team gets to the meet
as close to its start as possible, but this weekend, things will be
different.
The team will arrive in San Diego on Thursday night, but
will have Friday ;it its leisure after working out in the morning.
On Saturday, the team will compete at the Triton Invitational,

All potential Cardinal competitors for the Pac-1() will be
going to this weekend sTriton Invitational. liowever.the expec
tations the team carries will be different.as some team members
w ill be competing in events outside of their comfort zone.
I or example. ()kanlami will be competing in the high jump,
although he is best known for his excellent performances in the
triple jump. Several other members of the Stanford squad will
also switch around to new events, giving the team members a
chance to get a t;iste of different types of competition. Many of
the competitors who were expected to hit the NCAA Region
al-qualifying mark this season have already achieved their
marks, but others still need to work at it and will do so this
weekend.
"[The players who have not hit the mark] will try to take
tare of business." head coach Hdrick Horeal said.

particularly beneficial to throwers in the discus event in the past.

has great leadership skills and she
never ceases to amaze me."
