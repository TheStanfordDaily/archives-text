The Cardinal had to settle for sec
ond. though, as the Huskies held off
the Cardinal in all three events: the
varsity, second varsity and novice
eights. The losses were a disappoint
ing revert after last year's upset wins
by Stanford also at the Windermere.
Placing second only to California,
the varsity men's team then received
its highest ranking yet: No. 4 in the
nation.
"1 think last year was our coming
of-age year," men's head coach Craig
Amerkhanian said. "We have a lot of
mutual respect now between us, Cal
ifornia and Washington."
This year, Stanford men's varsity
eight — composed of sophomores
Mark Murphy, Alex Osborne and
coxswain Ariel Dixon: juniors Silas
Stafford, Ottavio Siani and Dave
Creighton; and seniors Nate Rooks,
Donny Simkin and Kevin Baum —
went into the competition ranked
No. 2.
The Windermere Classic also
came on the heels of the previous
weekend's Copley Cup title for Stan
ford. In the official start to their
spring season, the Cardinal men de
feated the then-No. 2 Golden Bears,
along with Oregon State and Purdue,
to claim a second consecutive cup.
"We got a big boost last week
from beating Cal, and from that
Stanford rowing has earned a lot of
respect." Amerkhanian said.
Aside from Cal, though. Washing
ton presented a tremendous chal
lenge going into the weekend. Re
turning many of last year's rowers,
some of whom also have internation
al experience, the team was de
scribed as "big, fast and strong" by
Simkin.
"We still came in confident,
though." he added. "A lot of teams
with high rankings often haven't
been tested, especially early in the
season."
Stanford received its own first test
against No. 20 George Washington.
In Saturday's first race at Redwood
Shores, the Cardinal varsity eight
came out with decisive success, beat
ing the Colonials by just under nine
seconds (6:12.72 against 6:21.35).
The next race would be much
closer, though, when Stanford went
down to the wire with No. 8 Wiscon
sin. The Badgers led the Cardinal
through the 1,000-meter midway
point by half a boat length. Stanford
made a push, though, and caught up
with Wisconsin for a win decided by
the final five strokes and just one
tenth of a second.
"What's special about this team is
its tenacity, and its collective focus,"
said Simkin. who called the Wiscon
sin race one of the best of his career.
"Everyone understands how to work
together and move cohesively, and I
think we showed that ability against
Wisconsin.
"[The team] stayed level-headed
and composed, even though we were
down...at the midway point," he
added. "We pulled it off in a great
sprint."
The Huskies awaited Stanford in
Sunday's finale, where they affirmed
their ranking over the Cardinal with
a six-second win (5:47.45 against
5:53.55).

the race, and it'll be exciting to race
