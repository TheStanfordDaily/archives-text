## SOX G.M. REFLECTS Former Stanford football star now at the helm of Chicago White Sox 
### SAM PRESSMAN 
With the Chicago White Sox in town to do bat
tle with the Oakland As on Apr. 10, the Daily's
Sam Pressman had the opportunity to interview
Kenny Williams, the White Sox General Manager
and Senior VP.
Williams was a Stanford undergraduate and a
member of the Cardinal football squad for one
year. But baseball lured him away from the grid
iron, and when the White Sox selected Williams in
the 1982 Amateur Draft, he went on to have a solid
professional career, after which he rejoined the
White Sox organization as a scout in 1992.
Williams later served as director of Minor League
Operations and the Vice President of Player De
velopment.
In November 2000, Williams became the Gen
eral Manager of the White Sox and the team has
since experienced great success; his deft wheeling
and dealing helped to bring the 2005 White Sox
the organization's first World Series victory since
1917. Williams was frank in describing the role of
the general manager, as well as the importance of
diversity in today's increasingly international
game. He even gave a brief reflection on his one
memorable year on the Farm:
Sam Pressman: Looking back on your Stanford
experience, what comes to mind?
Kenny Williams: Well. I think the worst decision of
my life was to leave early ... I regret it to this day.
SP: Well you played in "The Game" (notoriously
known among the Stanford faithful as the Big
Game that went awry versus Cal in 1982)... I low
was that?
KW: I'd like to play it over again — we'd win it
again. It's always been a hitter taste
that unfortunately we have to relive a
few times a year because of ESPN
Classic.
SP Do you remember what you were
doing during the play?
KW |ll ead coach) Paul Wiggin actu
ally had me by the shoulder pads and
was about to send me in the game,
and he says,"Kenny,go in the game in
case someone breaks free and you

can run them down." And then he
said. "Ah. nah, just stay right here
with me, nothing's going to happen."
And I was right there with Paul Wig
gin watching that whole play develop
heard all of the whistles, saw all
the knees hit the ground, all the ille
gal infractions that the referees didn't
see ... and I'm still bitter about it.
SP: Just reading about how you
moved up in the ranks with the White
Sox is impressive. I low do you think
the role of GM has changed during
your tenure at the position?
KW: Well, you know, it's my seventh
year now, and I think how it's
changed [is that), first of all. it's not

the same job it was a generation ago.
simply because there's much more
coverage, much more media, many
more media obligations, whether it
be online publications that you have
to deal with, or blogs or fans [who]
have their own websites. So a lot of
misinformation gets out there, [there
is] a lot more scrutiny ... longevity
certainly has been dented as a result
of the increased focus.
Sl': You're also the Senior VP.
KW: It's just a title. 1 just happen to be
sitting in the chair that is responsible
for player acquisition and contractual
issues and have a say in some of the
other things we do as an organization,
but its just a title. Our management
style is an all-inclusive management
style,so we all have a say in what direc
tion we are going to go. i just happen to
sit in the chair where, if we can't reach
a consensus on something,then I track
the course for us.

SP: The game has changed so much,
just financially. A team isn't just a trav
eling band of players, it's a corporation
and it's part of a billion dollar industry.
KW: It is that, [and] yeah, there are
budgets. If the business aspect is not
taken care of first, then there is none
of this. [Gesturing out to the field, the
players milling around in pre-game
warm-ups, the soon-to-be full Colise
um and the green grass]
SP: So when you're making your deci
sions. how do you find balance between
the two seemingly contrasting sides?
KW: Well, it's difficult because you
have an obligation to your fan base to
put together a product that gives
them hope for a championship. Peo
ple are very passionate about that,
but you also have to allow however
you are structured, in terms of private
ownership, public ownership or
something other — you have to
make sure you take care of those re

sponsihilities and your team's bot
tom line as well. You have to try to
put together a winning club whatever
your circumstances.
SP: What was the process in finding
[team manager] Ozzie [Guillen]? 1 le
seems to really spark this team.
KYV: Well, we played together first,
and you start with that, and the re
spect I had for him from when we
played with one another. He just
needed to go out there.coach, and get
some experience. This was a good fit
for him. [and] the rest of the coaching
staff is as well — we've all played to
gether, we have a passion for the
White Sox. and it makes a difference.
SP: So I'm looking out at this field,
and it's wild to see these players as
normal people, hanging out and
stretching before the game. They're
just 25 guys hanging out together,
playing a game. Do you think about
that as you attempt to construct a
team and a community?
KW. Well if you're talking about
chemistry, I believe, yeah, it makes a
difference what type of people you're
putting in your uniform. We believe
in character. Yes, you have to be tal
ented. but we want people who are
going to show up every day to win the
ball game not for selfish reasons. We
have a good group of guys that you
can root fonthey bring a certain work
ethic that is necessary in a city like
Chicago.
SP: When you look at the money that
was heaped on [Barry] Zito or
Daisuke [Matsuzaka] this winter,
what do you think?
KW: We can't afford to do business in
that fashion. I don't worry about
what a team does do or doesn't do as
much [as I care about] my competi
tion. how I've got to beat them, how
I've got to counteract what they do.
Obviously the money affects all of us
as it leads to an inflation of salaries,
which makes it harder for everyone
to compete, but there's nothing I can
do about it. So. I worry about things I
can control. It's better to spend ener
gy focusing on how to make your or
ganization — your company —
more successful and competitive.
SP: Did you always hope to be a gen
eral manager after your playing
days?
KW: No. I didn't want any part of base
ball— I'd met a lot of people that
weren't necessarily straight shooters. 1
was more interested in going into the
financial sector, going back to school,
getting my degree and going into fi
nance so 1 could make some real
money (and not get called an idiot

every day on every radio station or TV
program in Chicago). Things just kind
of fell in this direction and the oppor
tunity to run the minor league system
was very important. (My work] in
Chicago came about out ot necessity
for a good friend of mine who is an
owner of the club. And then the former
general manager retired, so ownership
lot>ked around and looked in my direc
tion ... and the rest is history
SP: Increasingly there are more
"suit"-minded people moving into
the executive box that didn't come
from the game.
KW:That's up to what they [the own
ers] want to do. Whoever owns a club
can shape their own organization
structure however they desire. We
have our way here in Chicago; its a
blend of both. I've got business expe
rience as well as experience on the
playing field, but every club is struc
tured differently. So you know you
very well could be the next general
manager of the Oakland A's the way
things are going.
SP: Ha, thanks. What do you think of
the international growth of the game?
KW : It's a good thing. It can only help
get the game better, the best talent on
the field, as well as diversity which 1
think is good in any business, because
you open people's minds to the possi
bility of bringing in a global approach
to your business.
SP: In light of the Jackie Robinson
Day coming up (Apr. 15) there's
been a lot of discussion about the dis
appearing face of African-Ameri
cans in baseball...
KW: Its disturbing that only nine per
cent [of those] out on the field [are
African-American] at the major
league level. There are certain rea
sons why kids aren't playing as much
— they're gravitating towards bas
ketball, football, video games, but it is
what it is, and if it continues in this
manner, there will be less opportuni
ty for blacks at an executive level,and
its diversity as a whole. Sometimes it
becomes a black-and-white issue, but
prejudice as a whole (is the issue]. We
need to get rid of all our prejudices as
a society in general before focusing
on one particular identity,and that in
cludes gender, so we need to really
grow up as a society and evolve to a
greater degree, because it's impera
tive if we're going to take our con
sciousness to the next level. But, I
gotta go.
SP:'l"hank you.

few times a year because of ESPN
Classic.
SP Do you remember what you were
doing during the play?
KW |ll ead coach) Paul Wiggin actu
ally had me by the shoulder pads and
was about to send me in the game,
and he says,"Kenny,go in the game in
case someone breaks free and you

can run them down." And then he
said. "Ah. nah, just stay right here
with me, nothing's going to happen."
And I was right there with Paul Wig
gin watching that whole play develop
heard all of the whistles, saw all
the knees hit the ground, all the ille
gal infractions that the referees didn't
see ... and I'm still bitter about it.
SP: Just reading about how you
moved up in the ranks with the White
Sox is impressive. I low do you think
the role of GM has changed during
your tenure at the position?
KW: Well, you know, it's my seventh
year now, and I think how it's
changed [is that), first of all. it's not

the same job it was a generation ago.
simply because there's much more
coverage, much more media, many
more media obligations, whether it
be online publications that you have
to deal with, or blogs or fans [who]
have their own websites. So a lot of
misinformation gets out there, [there
is] a lot more scrutiny ... longevity
certainly has been dented as a result
of the increased focus.
Sl': You're also the Senior VP.
KW: It's just a title. 1 just happen to be
sitting in the chair that is responsible
for player acquisition and contractual
issues and have a say in some of the
other things we do as an organization,
but its just a title. Our management
style is an all-inclusive management
style,so we all have a say in what direc
tion we are going to go. i just happen to
sit in the chair where, if we can't reach
a consensus on something,then I track
the course for us.

SP: The game has changed so much,
just financially. A team isn't just a trav
eling band of players, it's a corporation
and it's part of a billion dollar industry.
KW: It is that, [and] yeah, there are
budgets. If the business aspect is not
taken care of first, then there is none
of this. [Gesturing out to the field, the
players milling around in pre-game
warm-ups, the soon-to-be full Colise
um and the green grass]
SP: So when you're making your deci
sions. how do you find balance between
the two seemingly contrasting sides?
KW: Well, it's difficult because you
have an obligation to your fan base to
put together a product that gives
them hope for a championship. Peo
ple are very passionate about that,
but you also have to allow however
you are structured, in terms of private
ownership, public ownership or
something other — you have to
make sure you take care of those re

sponsihilities and your team's bot
tom line as well. You have to try to
put together a winning club whatever
your circumstances.
SP: What was the process in finding
[team manager] Ozzie [Guillen]? 1 le
seems to really spark this team.
KYV: Well, we played together first,
and you start with that, and the re
spect I had for him from when we
played with one another. He just
needed to go out there.coach, and get
some experience. This was a good fit
for him. [and] the rest of the coaching
staff is as well — we've all played to
gether, we have a passion for the
White Sox. and it makes a difference.
SP: So I'm looking out at this field,
and it's wild to see these players as
normal people, hanging out and
stretching before the game. They're
just 25 guys hanging out together,
playing a game. Do you think about
that as you attempt to construct a
team and a community?
KW. Well if you're talking about
chemistry, I believe, yeah, it makes a
difference what type of people you're
putting in your uniform. We believe
in character. Yes, you have to be tal
ented. but we want people who are
going to show up every day to win the
ball game not for selfish reasons. We
have a good group of guys that you
can root fonthey bring a certain work
ethic that is necessary in a city like
Chicago.
SP: When you look at the money that
was heaped on [Barry] Zito or
Daisuke [Matsuzaka] this winter,
what do you think?
KW: We can't afford to do business in
that fashion. I don't worry about
what a team does do or doesn't do as
much [as I care about] my competi
tion. how I've got to beat them, how
I've got to counteract what they do.
Obviously the money affects all of us
as it leads to an inflation of salaries,
which makes it harder for everyone
to compete, but there's nothing I can
do about it. So. I worry about things I
can control. It's better to spend ener
gy focusing on how to make your or
ganization — your company —
more successful and competitive.
SP: Did you always hope to be a gen
eral manager after your playing
days?
KW: No. I didn't want any part of base
ball— I'd met a lot of people that
weren't necessarily straight shooters. 1
was more interested in going into the
financial sector, going back to school,
getting my degree and going into fi
nance so 1 could make some real
money (and not get called an idiot

every day on every radio station or TV
program in Chicago). Things just kind
of fell in this direction and the oppor
tunity to run the minor league system
was very important. (My work] in
Chicago came about out ot necessity
for a good friend of mine who is an
owner of the club. And then the former
general manager retired, so ownership
lot>ked around and looked in my direc
tion ... and the rest is history
SP: Increasingly there are more
"suit"-minded people moving into
the executive box that didn't come
from the game.
KW:That's up to what they [the own
ers] want to do. Whoever owns a club
can shape their own organization
structure however they desire. We
have our way here in Chicago; its a
blend of both. I've got business expe
rience as well as experience on the
playing field, but every club is struc
tured differently. So you know you
very well could be the next general
manager of the Oakland A's the way
things are going.
SP: Ha, thanks. What do you think of
the international growth of the game?
KW : It's a good thing. It can only help
get the game better, the best talent on
the field, as well as diversity which 1
think is good in any business, because
you open people's minds to the possi
bility of bringing in a global approach
to your business.
SP: In light of the Jackie Robinson
Day coming up (Apr. 15) there's
been a lot of discussion about the dis
appearing face of African-Ameri
cans in baseball...
KW: Its disturbing that only nine per
cent [of those] out on the field [are
African-American] at the major
league level. There are certain rea
sons why kids aren't playing as much
— they're gravitating towards bas
ketball, football, video games, but it is
what it is, and if it continues in this
manner, there will be less opportuni
ty for blacks at an executive level,and
its diversity as a whole. Sometimes it
becomes a black-and-white issue, but
prejudice as a whole (is the issue]. We
need to get rid of all our prejudices as
a society in general before focusing
on one particular identity,and that in
cludes gender, so we need to really
grow up as a society and evolve to a
greater degree, because it's impera
tive if we're going to take our con
sciousness to the next level. But, I
gotta go.
SP:'l"hank you.

With the Chicago White Sox in town to do bat
tle with the Oakland As on Apr. 10, the Daily's
Sam Pressman had the opportunity to interview
Kenny Williams, the White Sox General Manager
and Senior VP.
Williams was a Stanford undergraduate and a
member of the Cardinal football squad for one
year. But baseball lured him away from the grid
iron, and when the White Sox selected Williams in
the 1982 Amateur Draft, he went on to have a solid
professional career, after which he rejoined the
White Sox organization as a scout in 1992.
Williams later served as director of Minor League
Operations and the Vice President of Player De
velopment.
In November 2000, Williams became the Gen
eral Manager of the White Sox and the team has
since experienced great success; his deft wheeling
and dealing helped to bring the 2005 White Sox
the organization's first World Series victory since
1917. Williams was frank in describing the role of
the general manager, as well as the importance of
diversity in today's increasingly international
game. He even gave a brief reflection on his one
memorable year on the Farm:
Sam Pressman: Looking back on your Stanford
experience, what comes to mind?
Kenny Williams: Well. I think the worst decision of
my life was to leave early ... I regret it to this day.
SP: Well you played in "The Game" (notoriously
known among the Stanford faithful as the Big
Game that went awry versus Cal in 1982)... I low
was that?
KW: I'd like to play it over again — we'd win it
again. It's always been a hitter taste
that unfortunately we have to relive a
few times a year because of ESPN
Classic.
