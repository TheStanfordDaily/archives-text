## SOX G.M. REFLECTS Former Stanford football star now at the helm of Chicago White Sox 
### SAM PRESSMAN 
With the Chicago White Sox in town to do bat
tle with the Oakland As on Apr. 10, the Daily's
Sam Pressman had the opportunity to interview
Kenny Williams, the White Sox General Manager
and Senior VP.
Williams was a Stanford undergraduate and a
member of the Cardinal football squad for one
year. But baseball lured him away from the grid
iron, and when the White Sox selected Williams in
the 1982 Amateur Draft, he went on to have a solid
professional career, after which he rejoined the
White Sox organization as a scout in 1992.
Williams later served as director of Minor League
Operations and the Vice President of Player De
velopment.
In November 2000, Williams became the Gen
eral Manager of the White Sox and the team has
since experienced great success; his deft wheeling
and dealing helped to bring the 2005 White Sox
the organization's first World Series victory since
1917. Williams was frank in describing the role of
the general manager, as well as the importance of
diversity in today's increasingly international
game. He even gave a brief reflection on his one
memorable year on the Farm:
Sam Pressman: Looking back on your Stanford
experience, what comes to mind?
Kenny Williams: Well. I think the worst decision of
my life was to leave early ... I regret it to this day.
SP: Well you played in "The Game" (notoriously
known among the Stanford faithful as the Big
Game that went awry versus Cal in 1982)... I low
was that?
KW: I'd like to play it over again â€” we'd win it
