## SLAC stands by 'demands' Hunger strike still on as Univ. expresses concern for proesters 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
In their third meeting in as many days, five rep
resentatives of the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) sat down Wednesday afternoon for
two hours with administrators including Dean of
Students Maureen Powers and Human Re
sources Director Diane Peck to argue about the
University's living wage policy.
Director of University Communications Alan
Acosta called the meeting "a productive discus
sion about some of the issues."
SLAC spokesperson Matt Seriff-Cullick 'OS
said that University administrators presented
group representatives with counter-proposals to
points in the "code of conduct" document that
SLAC introduced at Tuesday's meeting.
The University said in a statement that the
document "went far beyond the scope of (...) dis
cussions appropriate between SI.AC and the
University." SI.AC refers to these proposals as

"imperatives" or "demands," while the University
calls them "suggestions."
Seriff-Cullick said that SLAC made clear in its
written materials that a discussion of the living
wage would necessitate discussion of some wider,
related issues.
"1 think that we've been clear in everything
that we've ever communicated to the president
that the living wage is not an isolated issue," he
s;iid. "Every time we've delivered something to
them we always mention a lot more things than
the living wage campaign."
Acosta said that it was issues mentioned in the
"code of conduct" not directly associated with the
living wage that exceeded the scope of the discus
sion.
"They're free to characterize this however
they want," he said,"but for us the discussion was
primarily about the living wage."
Both sides said that there will be additional
discussions.
Twelve people continue to fast in what is now
the eighth day of n hunger strike. Seriff-Cullick
said that the ongoing fast has added to the ur
gency of the discussions.

On day seven of the SLAC hunger strike, which members have launched to protest the University's liv
ing wage, activists converse in their White Plaza encampment.
"1 think they're trying to con
vince us that the fast isn't what's
bringing them to the table," he said.
"Part of the reason for that is that
the fast is bringing a lot more atten
tion [...] to the issues than other
things have."
Acosta said that the fast has had
no effect on the ongoing meetings
with SLAC.
"We've said that we will meet
with them," he said. "President Hen
nessv has said that he is willing to
meet with them and so he has urged
them to stop the fast. We're con
cerned about the students' health."
