## Council decides abstentions do not count as student votes, confirms Avula/Jones victory unanimously 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hic Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted unani
mously last night against holding a run-off election
to determine next year's ASSU Executive, siding
with the Undergraduate Senate and overturning
what the Elections Commissioner said is required by
the ASSI' ('onstitution.
Unless a case to contest the governing bodies' de
cision is filed with and upheld by the Constitutional
Council, the ASSU's judicial body, Hershey Avula
'08 and Mondaire Jones '08 will be next year's ASSU
president and vice president, respectively. The run
ners-up. Brett Mammon 08 and Lakshmi Karra '08,
said they have no plans to contest the election re
sults.
The GSC's decision came down to a debate over
whether an abstention should be counted as a vote.
Though a record number of students turned out to
vote, a large number of them did not cast a ballot for
any ASSU Executive slate.
"The question for us as a body is how a vote
should be defined," said outgoing GSC co-Chair Paul
Gurney. "Are votes people who voted for an execu
tive slate, or everyone who logged onto the ballot?"
