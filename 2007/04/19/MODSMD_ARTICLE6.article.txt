# GSC votes down exec run-off
## Council decides abstentions do not count as student votes, confirms Avula/Jones victory unanimously 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hic Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted unani
mously last night against holding a run-off election
to determine next year's ASSU Executive, siding
with the Undergraduate Senate and overturning
what the Elections Commissioner said is required by
the ASSI' ('onstitution.
Unless a case to contest the governing bodies' de
cision is filed with and upheld by the Constitutional
Council, the ASSU's judicial body, Hershey Avula
'08 and Mondaire Jones '08 will be next year's ASSU
president and vice president, respectively. The run
ners-up. Brett Mammon 08 and Lakshmi Karra '08,
said they have no plans to contest the election re
sults.
The GSC's decision came down to a debate over
whether an abstention should be counted as a vote.
Though a record number of students turned out to
vote, a large number of them did not cast a ballot for
any ASSU Executive slate.
"The question for us as a body is how a vote
should be defined," said outgoing GSC co-Chair Paul
Gurney. "Are votes people who voted for an execu
tive slate, or everyone who logged onto the ballot?"
If only voters who cast a ballot
for at least one executive slate are
counted, Avula/Jones received over
68 percent support. But if absten
tions — people who did not vote
for any executive slate — are also
counted in the total number of
votes. Avula and Jones did not gar
ner the majority required by the
ASSU Constitution.
Elections Commissioner
Bernard Fraga '08 said last night

that a run-off election was needed,
but also made it a point to say that
he was only obeying what the Con
stitution required of him.
"It is not the recommendation or
the decision of the Elections Com
mission to hold a run-off," Fraga
said. "It is the constitutional re
quirement of the Elections Com
mission to hold a run-off."
Ultimately, the GSC decided
that people who abstained from the
ASSU Executive election should
not be counted in the total number
of votes.
"Even if you buy the argument
that 1,323 people abstained to
make a point, abstention is a choice

not to participate," said GSC mem
ber George Bloom. "You bear the
consequences even if that's a state
ment of conscience."
I {amnion and Karra told the GSC
that they did not want to influence
the decision one way or another.
"We don't feel it's our job as can
didates to tell you guys — the GSC
— how to do your job." Hammon
said. "We're going to respect the de
cision of the Undergraduate Sen
ate, the GSC and the Constitutional
Council."
"If all the bodies that be decide
against a run-off, Lakshmi and 1
won't leave kicking and scream
ing," he added. "But if there is a

run-off, we would like to run."
In an interview with The Daily
after the GSC vote. Mammon and
Karra said they were not even
aware of the relevant constitutional
clause that would allow them to
contest the elections results to the
Constitutional Council.
Mammon and Karra said that
while they themselves would not
file a case, they have not decided if
they would support a case if it is
filed by someone else.
"We personally are not going to
be pushing it." Karra said.
Relations between the two slates
seemed to remain amicable, and
Avula said that he had extended an

offer to Mammon and Karra to
serve on his executive cabinet.
Also in last night's meeting,
which was their last together, the
outgoing GSC approved next year's
budget after shifting funds from dis
cretionary accounts to more specific
line items. They ended the meeting
with words of advice to their soon
to-be successors.
"Please love this organization."
