### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
'I"his Stanford senior hopes to
beat out 14 other undergraduates
from across the country to win a
$ 100.0(H) cash prize. Who is Jeop
ardy! 2(X)7 College Championship
contestant Craig Boge? Correct.
Boge will represent Stanford at
the annual Jeopardy! college tour
nament during this weekend's live
taping at the University of South-

ern California.
ITie tournament
will air between
April 30 and May
'it's still sur
real to think
about it." said
Boge. who said
he has joked for
years about ap-

pearing on Jeopardy!
I le saiil he has watched the triv
ia show since early childhood, be
fore deciding to apply for the 2(M)h
college tournament, which fellow


BOGE
Stanford Quiz Bowl member Nico
Martinez '07 won.
Boge applied again last fall, com
pleting a timed online exam followed
by a live audition that included a
mock game and interview. In March,
he learned he had won a spot on the
show.
In preparation for this weekend's
competition, the human biology

major is beefing up on "fuzzy" trivia
in such areas as literature, history, art
and music. But he is not cramming
too hard.
"I'm mainly trying to keep my
sanity" Boge said, "and not overload
myself with information."
Martinez said Boge has a great
shot to win the tournament.
"Craig is a really smart guy," Mar
tinez said. "Even if he doesn't win. it
just means that the other players got
lucky or felt more comfortable up
there. Either way. it's a great honor to
be selected for the show."
Martinez also offered some words

of advice for Boge.
"Just try to enjoy the moment be
cause the game goes by really fast,"
he said. "After you get over the first
few minutes of being on camera, you
start to have a lot of fun with it. It's a
lot of fun to see something you know
and to try to buzz in."
Martinez said he used the money
he won last year for spring break trips
and an engagement ring for his fi
ancee. Rebecca Garza '06. to whom
he proposed in March.
