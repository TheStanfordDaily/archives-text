## Experts compare photographers, work 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Kresge Auditorium was packed
last night as three panelists dis
cussed the Richard Avedon and
Gordon Parks photography cur
rently on display at the Cantor Arts
Center.
Those associated with the Auro
ra Forum, a century-old Stanford
organization that hosted the event,
said they were not surprised with
the high turnout and the exhibit's

popularity.
"It's very accessible subject.and
people are very interested in the
history of the image in culture
today." said Art History Prof, and
panel moderator Wanda Corn in
an interview with The Daily.
"I've just spent the day at the
museum and both exhibits have
been rather steadily trafficked."
she added. "My guess is that these
are two well-known photographers
that haven't been seen together in
the Bay Area lately and in this depth,
so I anticipate a lot of public audi
ence."
New York Times art critic Andy
Grundberg and Deborah Willis, pro
fessor of photography and imaging
at New York University, participated
on the panel.
Corn said she hoped the panel
would be "inter-generational," but
student turnout was low.
Atherton resident Linda Fenney
did not think students missed much.
"I thought it was terrible," she
said atter the event."The panelists
just weren't stimulating, because
they didn't give us any information
about the photographers' messages. 1
didn't learn very much, let's put it
that way"
Art History Prof, Bryan Wolf dis
agreed with Fenney however, and
said he appreciated the chance to lis
ten to the panelists compare the
artists' work.
"1 think they are two extraordi
nary photographers, and it's a rare
opportunity to see them exhibited
together and to have an expert on
each photographer moderated by an
art historian discuss the issues," he
said.
A collection of Avedon's work,
"In the American West." will be on
display at Cantor until May 6. while
Parks' "Bare Witness" will remain at
the museum until July 1.
