Compete for fun, for prizes - or just for the bragging rights.
It's a new test of vocabulary strength that ups the ante on word-based
competition. In the Define-a-Thon, a quick-paced game separates the
vocabulary geniuses from the vocabulary wannabes. You'll pit your knowledge
of English against that of your friends and colleagues. Hosted by American
Heritage Dictionary Senior Editor and "hip lexicographer," Steve Kleinedler.
Winner receives a prize package that includes
a $50 Stanford Bookstore gift card.
Runners-up will receive consolation prizes.
