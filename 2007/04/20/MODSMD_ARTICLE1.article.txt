What a difference a month
makes.
When the Cardinal first faced Cal
this season, the team was in the
midst of an eight-game win streak
and achieved a milestone: the pro
gram's 2500 th win. But since sweep
ing the Bears, Stanford has struggled
to a 5-13 record, managing only one
conference win in that stretch.
The Cardinal (15-18, 1-8 Pacific
-10 Conference) hopes to regain
some of its early season form when it
heads to Berkeley, Calif, this week
end for a conference series against
Cal (19-19,3-6).
"Everything was kind of snow
balling. and 1 think the attitude of
the team...hasn't allowed us to get
hack yet," freshman righty Jeff
Inman said. "We need to have some
people have good games and get on
a roll again, because as easy as it was
to get into this snowball effect, it's
going to take work to get out of it."
Of the places to start. Berkeley
might be the best fit for the Cardi

the Bears, both this year and histori
cally. Behind a shutout performance
from Inman and junior reliever
David Stringer in a 1-0 win on Mar.
4 and two come-from-behind victo
ries, the Cardinal sweep ensured at
least a season split. Stanford has not
lost a season series to its rival since
1978.
And after playing six games a
year against each other, it's also a
team the Cardinal knows better
than most.
"You're pretty familiar with each
other, but it goes both ways," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "I think
it's a nice thing to do, because if we
didn't play that extra series our fans
wouldn't get a chance to see Cal play
and that's a real shame. It's a good ri
valry, it's good competition and it's
good for our fans."
Hie list of potential improve
ments is long for the Cardinal. The
team's conference woes are reflect

The last two weeks have been
rough on the world of sports.
Meat-headed Don Imus. think

showed us that race and racism is still
a paramount issue in today's America
with his description of the Rutgers
women's basketball team as "nappy

Then, NBA superstar and sup
posed role model Tim Duncan was
challenged to a fight by veteran refer
ee Joey Crawford. The scene had its
comic elements to it. but it was still
fairly disgusting with the raw angst
and hate between the old Crawford
and the robust Duncan.
In a time when nuclear weapons
programs abound, people are killed
over the outcomes of Little League
games and enormously wealthy NBA
players' demand salary hikes citing
the "need to feed their family," you
sometimes have to wonder where our
neurotic society is going.
And then Virginia Tech happened.
Virginia Tech.
The I iokies have been a mainstay
of college athletics for years. Head
football coach Frank Beamer built
his program based on hard work and
excellent special teams play.
By the time a kid named Michael
Vick stepped onto the Blacksburg
campus in the fall of 1998, Beamer's
program had reached the status of
national power.
Since then, Virginia Tech has al
ways been a mainstay of college foot
ball, competing in the national cham
pionship and appearing at numerous
New Year's Day bowl games.
Under Setli Greenberg, Tech's
basketball program has also risen,
beating both Duke and North Caroli
na this year in ACC play and making
the NCAA Tournament as a five
seed.
It has never been hard to root for
the I lokies; they have up-and-coming
programs. And after all. who can re
sist rooting for a I lokie?
Part of the allure in rooting for the
Hokies was that you often didn't
know what a Hokie was. For the
record, I lokie is a fictional mascot
masquerading itself as a maroon bird.
But there's even more reason to
root for the I iokies now.
We all know about the tragedy
that took place this Monday. I can't
imagine what it's like to be a student
at Virginia Tech right now, to know
someone who was shot or injured, to
be around the university or to even
be an alumnus. The inexplicable
tragedy has moved our nation,
brought people together, but most of
all. its left us asking: Why?
There isn't an answer, though.

ITie last time a Stanford women's water

Hie Cardinal achieved the feat in 2(H) 1.
six years ago, when the squad reeled off 27
consecutive games before falling to UCLA
in the NCAA championship match.

on Feb. 3 against powerful Southern Cali

unstoppable. Last weekend, the team ral

"Our biggest problem is our offense
hasn't generated a lot of hits and op
portunities to score. We haven't
done a very good job of that, and our
numbers reflect that."
"We need to play a more consis
tent brand of baseball " he added.

A new Stanford committee will conduct an
evaluation of its emergency protocols in the
wake of Monday's shootings at Virginia Tech
University. The protocol review, which will be
led by Vice President for Business Affairs
Randy Livingston, was announced in a state
ment concerning the massacre by President
John Hennessy.
"The terrible ordeal suffered there reminds
us how precious life is and how important it is
that we all redouble our efforts to prevent such
tragedies in the future," Hennessy said. "At
Stanford, we plan to review all of our emer
gency response protocols. 'ITic safety of the
Stanford community will always be a top prior
ity for us."
Police at Virginia Tech have drawn criticism
for their decision not to lock down the campus
after the initial shootings in West Ambler John
son Hall, a dormitory.
Chris Cohendet, a deputy at the Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS), said the police
train for what he called "an active shooter situ
ation." In such a case, officers would call togeth
er nearby agencies and attempt to control the
situation.
"There's obviously a lot of things that go
through your mind," he said. "You want to be
sure the community is safe. But you've got to
figure things out. For instance, at [Virginia

ward to playing this weekend. We
know that we're playing tough, very

The last two weeks have been
rough on the world of sports.
Meat-headed Don Imus. think
ing he was being clever and funny,
showed us that race and racism is still
a paramount issue in today's America
with his description of the Rutgers
women's basketball team as "nappy
headed hos."
Then, NBA superstar and sup
posed role model Tim Duncan was
challenged to a fight by veteran refer
ee Joey Crawford. The scene had its
comic elements to it. but it was still
fairly disgusting with the raw angst
and hate between the old Crawford
and the robust Duncan.
In a time when nuclear weapons
programs abound, people are killed
over the outcomes of Little League
games and enormously wealthy NBA
players' demand salary hikes citing
the "need to feed their family," you
sometimes have to wonder where our
neurotic society is going.
And then Virginia Tech happened.
Virginia Tech.
The I iokies have been a mainstay
of college athletics for years. Head
football coach Frank Beamer built
his program based on hard work and
excellent special teams play.
By the time a kid named Michael
Vick stepped onto the Blacksburg
campus in the fall of 1998, Beamer's
program had reached the status of
national power.
Since then, Virginia Tech has al
ways been a mainstay of college foot
ball, competing in the national cham
pionship and appearing at numerous
New Year's Day bowl games.
Under Setli Greenberg, Tech's
basketball program has also risen,
beating both Duke and North Caroli
na this year in ACC play and making
the NCAA Tournament as a five
seed.
It has never been hard to root for
the I lokies; they have up-and-coming
programs. And after all. who can re
sist rooting for a I lokie?
Part of the allure in rooting for the
Hokies was that you often didn't
know what a Hokie was. For the
record, I lokie is a fictional mascot
masquerading itself as a maroon bird.
But there's even more reason to
root for the I iokies now.
We all know about the tragedy
that took place this Monday. I can't
imagine what it's like to be a student
at Virginia Tech right now, to know
someone who was shot or injured, to
be around the university or to even
be an alumnus. The inexplicable
tragedy has moved our nation,
brought people together, but most of
all. its left us asking: Why?
There isn't an answer, though.
Hint's the hardest part.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Card crosses Bay to top 20 wins
By WES MATEO
DESK EDITOR
ITie last time a Stanford women's water
polo team won 20 games in a row, more
than half of the members of this year's
team hadn't even entered high school yet.
Hie Cardinal achieved the feat in 2(H) 1.
six years ago, when the squad reeled off 27
consecutive games before falling to UCLA
in the NCAA championship match.
This year's team gets its shot at 20
straight tonight, and it's only fitting that the
top-ranked Cardinal (21-1, 10-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) should be facing
cross-Bay rival and No. 6-ranked Califor
nia (10-9,6-5) for the occasion.
ITie Stanford women's lone loss came
on Feb. 3 against powerful Southern Cali
fornia, but since then the Cardinal has been
unstoppable. Last weekend, the team ral
lied to extend its winning streak by knock
ing off No. 2 UCLA at home in an overtime
thriller, 7-6. It was just the second time this
season that the Bruins have lost, but both
of those losses came at the hands of the
Cardinal.
