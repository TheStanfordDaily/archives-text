Apr. 20,1967:
National Suspends Kappa Sigma
Amid Negro Pledge Controversy
"Kappa Sigma fraternity has been
suspended from its national organi
zation. apparently because of diffi
culties arising after a Negro was
pledged two years ago. The action
has not yet been made definite, and
certain alumni are now try ing to re
verse the decision. The chapter is
awaiting a letter of explanation from
the national.
"Commenting on representatives
of Kappa Sigma's national organiza
tion, one local member said,' They're

such a bunch of flaming bigots, it
makes me sick to associate with
them* He added that he thought the
reasons given for the suspension
were 'petty.'
One of Beta Zeta's [Stanford's
Kappa Sigma chapter] coordinators
for rush is a Negro; the other's grades
apparently do not meet the stan
dards of the national.
The two were depledged last
quarter at the insistence of the na
tional but were allowed to remain
living in the house. [Chapter presi
dent Dan] Kirby said this was not in
violation of any rules."
