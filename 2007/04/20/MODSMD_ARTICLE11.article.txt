Action Coalition (SLAC),group of
ficials announced at a rally yester
day Yet 10 are continuing the fast
which is now in its ninth day â€” as
part of an ongoing effort to correct
what they see as shortcomings in the
University's living wage policy.
Liz Brody '09 checked into
Vaden Health Center yesterday
morning and is receiving intra
venous fluids, SLAC spokesman
Matt Seriff-Cullick '08 told The
Daily. Sofia Lee *03, a social worker
in San Francisco who returned to
campus this week for the living
wage campaign, also chose to break
her fast. Lee had to return to work
after taking five days of vacation
time.
"I think [Stanford] has forgotten
how to respect student voice on
campus," Lee said as she announced
her decision to break the fast,
adding that communicating with
the administration was a challenge
for activists.
"Is there room for student voice
at the University?" she said Mon
day."! don't feel that."
Seriff-Cullick said he supported
Brody's decision to stop fasting.
"She didn't have time to pre
pare." he said. "We ended up with so
many [more] fasters than we antici
pated."
Thom Massey. a student affairs
officer in the Dean of Students' Of
fice said he was sorry to hear about
Brody's health issues.
"1 hope we can reach some sort
of agreement before [more] stu
dents become ill." he said. "1 hope
that the students take care of one
another."
Rally intersects with
Admit Weekend
Yesterday's rally began in White
Plaza during the Admit Weekend
Activities Fair, before protesters
marched to Memorial Auditorium.
About 50 people, including some
Stanford workers and prospective
freshmen, sat on the Auditorium's
steps while other admitted students
and their families tiled in around
them to attend the University Wel
come, a formal introduction to
Admit Weekend.
According to Seriff-Cullick, yes

terday's rally was held in response
to President John Hennessy's deci
sion to delay a fourth meeting with
SLAC representatives until today.
I le said that Brody's illness ought to
cause the administration to move
more quickly.
"I 'm optimistic that this could be
ended pretty soon." he said in an in
terview with The Daily. "[But] it's
going to take a commitment, not
just agreements."
SLAC member and faster Jose
les de la Cruz '07 shared Seriff-Cul
lick 's optimism.
"The University is still moving
pretty slowly on this issue, but we've
got a lot of power," he said at the
rally. "This is day eight of not eating,
and I'm still excited to be here."
Some prospective freshmen at
tending the University Welcome
event said they were happy with the
rally, which caused a bottleneck as
people entered the building.
"1 like it," said Julia Janssen, an
admitted student from Atlanta who
will be attending the University
next ycar."lt shows how committed
Stanford students are."

Jessica Salinas, an admitted stu
dent from Houston who is still de
ciding whether to attend Stanford,
said the living wage issue could in
fluence her school choice. Salinas
joined the SLAC rally after hearing
about it in White Plaza.
"It tells you something about the
school,"she said."lt might make me
mad if my parents were making this
[wage]."
The Administration did not in
terfere with the rally, which lasted
for about an hour.
"I don't think it impacted [the
University Welcome] in any real
way," said Massey, who stayed on
the Auditorium's steps during the
rally. "I think what students and
families see is student diversity."
Seriff-Cullick said that the rally
was not intended to disrupt the
Admit Weekend events.
"We're hoping that it'll attract
future SI.AC-tivists," he said with a
smile. "As admitted students, they
already have a choice."
