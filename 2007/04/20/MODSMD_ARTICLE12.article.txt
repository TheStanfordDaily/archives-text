Next year's prospective freshmen
affectionately known as"ProFros"
are here for Admit Weekend, a
three-day affair designed to im
press and inform admitted stu
dents.
This year, students from 4 l )
states — and such faraway places
as Israel. Thailand, Brazil and
Turkey — are here for Admit
Weekend.
"Before applying to Stanford,
it's hard to experience the campus
as a student," said associate dean of
admission and financial aid
Christina Wire in an email to The
Daily. "Admit Weekend launches
our admitted students on their own
Stanford journey."
Planners of this year's event
have catered to parents more so
than in previous years.
The Office of Public Affairs, in
collaboration with the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce, has creat
ed an event called Destination

Palo Alto, which is planned to fa
miliarize parents with the area and
each other.
"During previous years, parents
haven't had much programming,
so we like [Destination Palo
Alto]," said Kalei Kim.assistant di
rector of marketing and outreach
of undergraduate admission.
"Admit Weekend focuses on the
students. All the parents are in the
same position, and this gives them

time to bond with each other."
As in previous years, the Uni
versity has mandated a "dry" cam
pus in order to promote student
safety.
"Our admitted guests have all
signed a "Guidelines for Admit
Weekend Participants" statement
in which they arc instructed that
the use of alcohol or illegal drugs

by participants is forbidden." Kim
said."(Such activity) can result in se
rious sanctions, including the revo
cation of an offer of admission. The
Office of Undergraduate Admission
takes this policy very seriously."
Admit Weekend coordinators
have planned a wide range of alco
hol-free activities, including student
panels focusing on life at Stanford,
departmental information sessions
and social activities that promote
Pro Fro bonding.
"Stanford is all about balance."
said Branner Head House Host
(Hollo) Kyla Barr TO."Our jobs as
I loHos are to help in that process by
giving them advice on academic
questions as well as showing them
that balance that many Stanford stu
dents have.
"[We have been] scheduling a
cappella groups to perform or hav
ing a midnight fountain hopping trip
or just having conversations about
what it's like to be a student here on
campus." she added.
Wire said that Admit Weekend is
meant to show ProFros all that the
University has to offer, both socially
and academically.
"In Dean [of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid] Richard Shaw's words,
our goal is "to provide exceptional
exposure to this extraordinary
place,'" she said. "Admitted students
can [then] make the most informed
decision about where to spend the
next four years of their lives."
