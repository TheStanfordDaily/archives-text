## Stigma of tobacco splits faculty Hennessy finds himself opposite Pizzo in FacSen 
### NICK PARKER MANAGING EDITOR 
Tensions ran high at yesterday after
noon's Faculty Senate meeting as mem
bers hutted heads over a proposed reso
lution that would bar tobacco compa
nies from funding I Jniversity-sponsored
research projects.
Introduced by Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Bernd Girod.chair of the Com
mittee on Research, the resolution
elicited strong reactions on both sides of
the debate. Some administrators and
faculty members called the motion a
moral obligation while others con
demned it as setting a dangerous prece
dent.
The resolution — which proposes
that "Stanford University will not enter
into sponsored research agreements
with companies that make or market to
bacco products" — passed by a 7-5 mar
gin in the Committee on Research. It
was sponsored by History Prof. Robert
Proctor and co-signed by Medical
School Prof. Robert Jackicr and Law
Prof. I lank (ireely *74.
Supporters of the resolution said the
I Jniversity has an obligation to disasso
ciate itself from the tobacco industry,
which they said manipulates University
research for its own ends.
"[Tobacco companies] never fund
projects that would implicate them
selves," Girod said. "They select proj
ects that help them develop theories
about alternative explanations for to
bacco-related diseases, such as air pol
lution or genetic predisposition."
Greely also voiced strong support for
the proposal and castigated tobacco
companies as disingenuous.
"Using the guise of academic re
search. [the tobacco industry] has per
verted academic research to its own
ends for 50 years," he said. "The tobac
co industry is using Stanford to white
wash [itself]. They are using us for their
nefarious ends, and we should stop it."
"If any human endeavor deserves
the term 'evil,'" he added, "1 think the

tobacco industry probably deserves
it."
The resolution's opponents, how
ever. said that prohibiting tobacco in
dustry-funded research could lead to a
slippery slope for the banning of more
research.
"It's dangerous to target a specific
industry," said Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering Prof. Jeffrey Koseff
MS '78. "Who's to judge what comes
next? Ibis time it's tobacco. Next it
could be alcohol; it could be oil."
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 agreed, arguing that preventing to
bacco companies from funding Uni
versity-sponsored research could cre
ate a troubling precedent.
"If we were to go this way, I think
we would get similar efforts to ban
funding from oil companies, pharma
ceutical companies, the Department
of Defense," he said. "Changing re
search policy is not a good way to
make a statement."

President John Hennessy de
nounced the resolution, calling it "po
litical."
"This is a political message, and I
am very concerned that we are chang
ing our academic policy to send a polit
ical message," he said. "And 1 worry
about whether or not that is a wise
change in our policy."
Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo
disagreed with Hennessy, saying he
supported the resolution on ethical
grounds.
"There is a difference between the
tobacco industry and any other indus
try' that exists today," he said. "I don't
agree that this is political or politics per
se."
The Senate did not vote on the res
olution yesterday and will discuss the
matter further at its next meeting on
Mav 3.
