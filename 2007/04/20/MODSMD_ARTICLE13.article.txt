### NICK PARKER MANAGING EDITOR 
Tensions ran high at yesterday after
noon's Faculty Senate meeting as mem
bers hutted heads over a proposed reso
lution that would bar tobacco compa
nies from funding I Jniversity-sponsored
research projects.
Introduced by Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Bernd Girod.chair of the Com
mittee on Research, the resolution
elicited strong reactions on both sides of
the debate. Some administrators and
faculty members called the motion a
moral obligation while others con
demned it as setting a dangerous prece
dent.
The resolution — which proposes
that "Stanford University will not enter
into sponsored research agreements
with companies that make or market to
bacco products" — passed by a 7-5 mar
gin in the Committee on Research. It
was sponsored by History Prof. Robert
Proctor and co-signed by Medical
School Prof. Robert Jackicr and Law
Prof. I lank (ireely *74.
Supporters of the resolution said the
I Jniversity has an obligation to disasso
ciate itself from the tobacco industry,
which they said manipulates University
research for its own ends.
