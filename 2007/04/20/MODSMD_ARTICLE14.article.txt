## Editorial Board Continue improving elections enforcement

The controversy surrounding the pres
entation of spring election results to
the Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council this week has prevented
a reflective look back on this year's campaign
week and the voting that followed.
That's a shame, because there is much for
followers of campus politics to be proud of.
Turnout among graduate and undergraduate
students spiked 10 percent from the year be
fore. In 2006 there were two serious slates and
the perennial Chaparral duo in the running
for ASSU executive, while last week no less
than five slates threw their hats into the elec
toral ring. Four of these slates brought serious
issues before the voters, creating one of the
hardest-fought campaigns in recent memory.
Facing a tight executive race, candidates
reached out to the graduate community to a
greater degree than ever before. Grad stu
dents cast more votes for ASSU executive
this year than they did in any election on
record â€” the result of increased efforts by
candidates to mobilize this group of voters. A
promise to fight for improved graduate
health care featured prominently in
Avula/Jones' platform, and Brett and Laksh
mi campaigned to protect grad students from
special fees levies for groups geared toward
the undergraduate population.
Technological innovation was another
memorable development of the 2(X)7 elec
tions season. Taking a cue from 2(X)N presi
dential contenders like 1 lillary Clinton. Web
savvy candidates utilized video-sharing sites
like You Tube to a greater extent than ever
before. The most memorable example came
from freshman Eugene Nho's Senate cam

paign: a brilliant "300"-parody You Tube spot
that helped garner him the highest number of
senatorial votes since Omar Shakir '07's 2(X)4
run.
In this year of intense competition and in
novation. the ASSU Elections Commission
made the right move by pressing forward
with the implementation of a new "Fair Cam
paign" label. In previous elections seasons, no
constitutional method existed for enforcing
elections rules governing flyering and poster
placement. Under the leadership of Bernard
Fraga 'OS. this year's commission took steps
to rectify the situation by providing a "Fair
Campaign" label next to the candidates
name on the ballot. A campaign which broke
the rules would have this label revoked, sig
naling its failure to follow ASSU elections
guidelines. Despite anger in some camps
about alleged spotty enforcement of these
guidelines, the system represents a marked
improvement over the system of previous
years.
Hopefully next year's elections commis
sion will work closely with this year's leader
ship to review the successes and failures of
the Fair Campaign label. It's unclear how
much the designation mattered to voters, so
revoking it may have been more of a symbol
ic slap on the wrist than a serious penalty for
rule breakers. II there are rules defining pre
cise limits on flier and poster placement and
campaigning times, enforcement should be
made a higher priority so cheaters don't ben
efit at the expense of honest campaigners.
ITiis year's reform was a step forward,but im
provements should be made for next year's
election season.
