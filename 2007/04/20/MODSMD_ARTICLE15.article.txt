# The 						first ride on the merry-go-round
## 
### 
In case you haven't heard it loud and
clear enough in the past 24 hours: wel
come to Stanford.
From the red-and-white banner at the
end of Palm Drive (considering its promi
nence and how much use it has gotten over
the years, you'd think the administration
would spring for an accurate, cardinal-col
ored one) to the happy-go-lucky Hollos.
RoHos and Admit Weekend coordinators,
the friendly greetings on this campus
abound like caterpillars and bicycles.
If you choose to stick around as 1 have
for the past seven years (parents, don't be
alarmed: like most of my friends, I graduat
ed in four years.The ones who didn't are, as
in the case of a certain Mr. John Steinbeck,
doing quite well for themselves without an
official degree. Not that your little Johnny
or Sue will throw caution and $120,000 to
the wind to pursue an incredibly promising,
not to mention stable, artistic career. But I
digress.The point: I'm now a grad student),
the coming days will offer numerous en
counters with certain elements of the Stan
ford experience that, much like the wel
come messages and caterpillars, will recur
time and again throughout your years here.
I.Too much to do, not enough time.
I have not bothered to look at the Admit
Weekend website (back in my day, which
would be the year A!) 2(MX). we just had
paper pamphlets), but I am quite certain
that your options for the weekend will be no
less overwhelming than mine were. From
classes to panels to activities, the choices are
endless. And most of them, with the possible
exception of that 9 a.m. lecture, probably
look incredibly appealing.
The reality, of course, is that you can't do
it all — and not just because many of them
happen at the same time. You're smart, so
you already know there are only 24 hours in
a day; if. however, you're like me. it will take
you at least the next four years to learn that
energy is also a limiting factor. Pay attention
to how many consecutive hours you sleep
when you get home from this weekend. You
can only last for so long on five hours of
sleep and constant stimulation.
2. Amazing people.
During my first 48 hours on campus, I
crossed paths with Mike McDonald and
Casey Jacobsen (basketball players whose
names probably mean nothing to you —
trust me. young'un. they were noteworthy
back in the day), Amboy Kelso (another
throw-back. Although the band no longer
exists, two of the musicians are currently
working independently in LA),and Chelsea
Clinton (I am going to make myself feel bet
ter by NO T identifying this one. I don't care
that you were roughly three years old when
her father was elected the first time).
Famous personalities aside, there are a
lot of incredible people around here. For the
next four years, they will live next door and
across campus and. though you will later
wonder how you ever shared so little space
with another human beine. in the same

room as you.
As with the classes and activities dis
cussed above, living amongst 6500 over
achievers can get pretty overwhelming, es
pecially when you're comparing their Face
book profiles to your internal emotional ex
perience. At some point in time,most every
one believes he or she was mistakenly ad
mitted (and 1, for one. spent as little time as
possible with those whose confidence/arro
gance never faltered — trust me, there are
more than a few of those, too). I now know
multiple people who work for the Office of
Undergrad Admissions, and 1 think I've
been here long enough to say they don't
make mistakes.
3. Ambiguous sexual interactions.
Despite the general awesomeness of the
people on this campus, there is one area in
which we tend not to excel.
I've written entire columns on this issue
(see "Smart. Cute, and Unavailable" for re
cent observations), so. rather than use my
precious word limit to repeat myself, 1 will
simply say this: contrary to its vast appear
ance. this is a small campus. If you hook up
with a fellow admit this weekend, he or she
will undoubtedly end up in your freshman
dorm.
Please, please do not fall prey to an up
perclassman. And, if you must, steer clear of
the large houses on Mayfield Row. Suppos
edly, they are all off on retreats this week
end. but that didn't stop me from spending
two evenings with some soccer-playing
members of SAF.
Bottom line: for all of the drama, very
few are ready to be in real romantic rela
tionships during their time at Stanford (and
I believe this is the same at most compara
ble schools across the country). Now. three
years after graduation, the relationship
ready are currently married and/or en
gaged: the rest of us are only beginning to
get serious about our commitments to peo
ple other than ourselves. From my class, the
former population numbers roughly 30 out
of 1725. You do the math. And, unless you're
one of the latter, prepare yourself for a
bumpy four-year ride on the emotional
roller coaster of "less-than-serious. more
than-friends." As with the rest of your Stan
ford experience, there will be crazy highs
and depressing lows,and it will all be over in
the blink of an eye. For now. though, sit
back, relax and enjoy the ride. Oh. and wel
come to Stanford.

one believes he or she was mistakenly ad
mitted (and 1, for one. spent as little time as
possible with those whose confidence/arro
gance never faltered — trust me, there are
more than a few of those, too). I now know
multiple people who work for the Office of
Undergrad Admissions, and 1 think I've
been here long enough to say they don't
make mistakes.
3. Ambiguous sexual interactions.
Despite the general awesomeness of the
people on this campus, there is one area in
which we tend not to excel.
I've written entire columns on this issue
(see "Smart. Cute, and Unavailable" for re
cent observations), so. rather than use my
precious word limit to repeat myself, 1 will
simply say this: contrary to its vast appear
ance. this is a small campus. If you hook up
with a fellow admit this weekend, he or she
will undoubtedly end up in your freshman
dorm.
Please, please do not fall prey to an up
perclassman. And, if you must, steer clear of
the large houses on Mayfield Row. Suppos
edly, they are all off on retreats this week
end. but that didn't stop me from spending
two evenings with some soccer-playing
members of SAF.
Bottom line: for all of the drama, very
few are ready to be in real romantic rela
tionships during their time at Stanford (and
I believe this is the same at most compara
ble schools across the country). Now. three
years after graduation, the relationship
ready are currently married and/or en
gaged: the rest of us are only beginning to
get serious about our commitments to peo
ple other than ourselves. From my class, the
former population numbers roughly 30 out
of 1725. You do the math. And, unless you're
one of the latter, prepare yourself for a
bumpy four-year ride on the emotional
roller coaster of "less-than-serious. more
than-friends." As with the rest of your Stan
ford experience, there will be crazy highs
and depressing lows,and it will all be over in
the blink of an eye. For now. though, sit
back, relax and enjoy the ride. Oh. and wel
come to Stanford.
