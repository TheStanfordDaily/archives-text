# A 						lesson from Virginia Tech
## 
### 
It's time for a game of Funny/Not Funny.
First: A joke overheard in the CoHo on
Monday referencing the Virginia Tech
massacre. Not Funny. No one laughed, and
someone said. "Too soon, too soon." Next: An
off-hand comment made at the gym on
Wednesday, poking fun at the ethnicity of the
Korean shooter responsible for the assault,
("ho Seung-I lui. Funny? At least. 1 heard peo
ple laugh in response. "Oh. man... that's so
wrong. I lahahahaha."
I low soon is too soon to use a tragedy as
fodder for comedy? "Homer loves Flanders,"
a Simpsons episode in season five, parodies
Charles Whitman, the University of Texas
tower-sniper: Ned Flanders guns down multi
ple I lomers from atop a bell tower. About 25
years after the massacre, FOX executives
found the scene funny enough to air. 1 low long
will it take for South Park to run an episode
satirizing the events at Virginia Tech?
I think that the amount of time it takes for
someone to find humor in tragedy is directly
related to his connection to the incident. It is
unlikely that the man who sold Sueng-Ilui his
gun will ever find anything humorous about
the shooting. The student in the CoHo who
made his joke last Monday probably doesn't
know anyone at Virginia Tech. I doubt that he
feels any kind of personal connection to the
event.
I lowever. we as Stanford students are actu
ally deeply connected to the Virginia Tech
massacre. Seung-I lui exploded at Virginia
lech. Maurice "Mo" Morsette imploded at
Stanford. Both students' lives ended in
tragedy.

Maurice Moisette's suicide is one of at least
three reported at Stanford this academic year.
Ranked in 2005 by The Princeton Review as
the university with the "Happiest Students
Overall" in the country. Stanford doesn't seem
to be living up to its reputation any longer.
Hie Virginia Tech tragedy will undoubtedly
lead the Stanford administration and various
support groups on campus to reexamine how
issues of mental health are handled on campus.
This response seems to deal with only part of a
greater problem.
No matter how many aggressive programs
a school funds, no matter how many 24-hour
hotlines they provide or psychologists they
hire, nothing can change without a change in
the student culture itself.
Unfortunately, the type of student elite uni
versities admit is not going to change anytime
soon. We are a nation obsessed with getting
into college. And the most obsessed end up
here. As a result, we are a campus full of top
heavy people. We are world-class debaters,
writers and chemists, fully actualizing our intel
lectual potential. But these skills have come at
the loss of developing more basic skills. By the
end of winter quarter of my freshman year. 40

percent of my all-frosh dorm had never been
kissed. ITirowing these types of kids into the
collegiate world is bound to result in extreme
feelings of alienation, confusion and anger.
College is a place where many get their first
taste of freedom, but learning how to handle
independence isn't part of any AP Physics text
book.
1 know that this article goes to print during
Admit Weekend, and. as such. 1 was reluctant
to write this week about our collective failings
as members of the academic world. As a tour
guide who couldn't imagine having gone any
where else (and who enthusiastically tells this
to hoards of high school juniors on a regular
basis). 1 want to make sure that 1 am very clear:
I have had a remarkable experience at Stan
ford, and 1 know that 1 made the right choice in
coming here. Quite a few of my friends feel the
same way. "ITie problems of socially handi
capped hyper-achievers are not unique to a
few schools. Rather, this situation is endemic
across the country.
I decided to write this article after 1 watched
a mother and her Pro Fro daughter walk
through the activities fair yesterday. The
daughter was texting on her cell phone, and her
mom kept on taking papers from the student
tables, asking the students working the booths
a slew of questions: "How many hours a week
do you volunteer? How many other activities
do you do? Do you put your activities on your
resume? How many activities should my
daughter do?" The mother was so involved in
her daughter's life that I wondered if she had

opened her daughter's acceptance
letter for her.
My hope is that the mother I over
heard reads this week's column. I
hope that she realizes that her daugh
ter is probably exhausted from push
ing herself through four incredibly dif
ficult years and almost certainly will
need guidance on how to be a well-ad
justed citizen, not how to build a re
sume, as she enters adulthood. My
hope is that ProFros read this column
and realize that coming to college is
not going to be easy, wherever they
choose to go. Part of growing up is fac
ing failure and difficulty, and there is
no shame in asking for help, even it it
seems as though everyone else is
doing Fine.They aren't.
Our complete inability to cope
with the pressures of today may even
tually be funny. But for now. it's defi
nitely too soon to turn the tragedy of
our extreme emphasis on academic
intelligence and achievement into a
quick one-liner glibly delivered at
the Manzanita brunch table.

My hope is that the mother I over
heard reads this week's column. I
hope that she realizes that her daugh
ter is probably exhausted from push
ing herself through four incredibly dif
ficult years and almost certainly will
need guidance on how to be a well-ad
justed citizen, not how to build a re
sume, as she enters adulthood. My
hope is that ProFros read this column
and realize that coming to college is
not going to be easy, wherever they
choose to go. Part of growing up is fac
ing failure and difficulty, and there is
no shame in asking for help, even it it
seems as though everyone else is
doing Fine.They aren't.
Our complete inability to cope
with the pressures of today may even
tually be funny. But for now. it's defi
nitely too soon to turn the tragedy of
our extreme emphasis on academic
intelligence and achievement into a
quick one-liner glibly delivered at
the Manzanita brunch table.
