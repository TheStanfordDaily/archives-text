# Caterpillar? I hardly knew her
## 
### 
Before reading this, you probably want
to run your fingers through your hair,
brush off your shirt and pants, and have
a 112 riend examine those places that your hands
and eyes can't reach. Done?
If you've come across a caterpillar, keep it
in your palm as you read this article for dra
matic effect. If not, then take the time to walk
around campus until you find one, preferably
alive. No need to rush, there're plenty for
everybody. I can wait.
Now get real close to that bug. Look it in
its eyes, peer into its soul. Ask it how its day is
going, see if it wants to grab a beer later.
Check if any of its family, friends or lovers
(former or present) have been power-washed
lately or if they've devised any clever ways to
counter its formidable arch-nemesis, the
predatory spined soldier bug. (I have to won
der whether those soldiers volunteered for
their duty, and if so whether they are worried
that their tours may be extended with no
prior notice).
During this little exchange you two may
want to work through any past emotional is
sues you've had. whether they stem from you
not showing enough affection to the caterpil
lar when it was a baby or from that time the
caterpillar hooked up with that guy it knew
you were totally crazy about. I mean, even
though you probably would have just fooled

around with him then never returned his
calls, that's just stepping over a line (about
thirty times, in the case of the caterpillar).
I hope that you and the caterpillar have
worked out your existential conflict now. 1
must say that, after spending an extended pe
riod of time in a developing country. 1 am
more concerned with bugs inside me — i.e..
amoebas and parasites — than with having
bugs such as caterpillars on me. Moreover,
caterpillars seem amazingly benign because:
l.They don't bite,2.They don't smell,3.They
don't transmit diseases, 4. They don't stain
your clothes, 5. They're so cute! You just
wanna take 'em home and breastfeed 'em.
Of course it's perfectly reasonable to not
want to be covered in bugs. But the larger
issue that the caterpillar brings to my mind is
that when we've been raised in comfort, we
usually turn into people who can't live with
out it. I have heard from countless law stu

dents that they can't work in public interest
because they grew up with certain amenities,
and they just can't give them up now. Working
tor legal aid is a nice thought, but how can you
live in a posh neighborhood with nice cars
and send your kids to private school on that
sort of salary? (You can't, by the way).
We all crave the finer things in life, and it
seems to follow that we wouldn't give up
these things unless we were forced to. What
we may not realize though is that in striving
for the classy status symbols that riches can
afford us, we might make it hard (if not im
possible) to live the lifestyle that accompa
nies working toward social justice, speaking
up for the disadvantaged and leveling the
playing field for the worst off among us.
On face it's hard to imagine why anyone
would tolerate being covered with insects
when they could just as easily release nema
todes and retake White Plaza for the human
race. But in the larger scheme of things,
maybe being inconvenienced, uncomfortable
and annoyed can enable us to better honor
the things that really matter to us in life: Our
ideals.our beliefs and our values.That's worth
sparing a caterpillar or two. isn't it?

fortable and annoyed, drop Vishnu a line at
