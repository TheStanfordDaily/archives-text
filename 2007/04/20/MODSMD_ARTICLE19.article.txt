Administration should
acknowledge suicides

ITie Virginia Tech shooting hap
pened on Monday morning, and by
Tuesday night our vice provost had
sent everyone an email about it. ex
pressing the shared grief of the Stan
ford community, inviting us to a re
membrance on Wednesday after
noon. and reminding us that "We
need to rely on each other for sup
port and to nurture our sense of com
munity."
Boardman didn't send any emails
about Maurice Morsette's death,
though. On Friday Boardman issued
a press release with a statement of
less than 80 words regarding the loss
for our campus (the email about Vir
ginia Tech was six paragraphs, just
over 300 words). Since then no word
from University officials has gone
out en masse about Morsette's
death, nor has there been any sort of
memorial event set up by the organ
izers of the Virginia Tech remem
brance.
Additionally, while Morsette's
body was found on Thursday morn
ing. the Daily didn't cover the story
until Monday. On the front page of
that day's edition. Morsette's death
was marginalized on the right-hand
column, while Hershey Avula and
Mondaire Jones's ASSU election
victory was the bold-print center
piece.
If we're really to have the nur
tured communitv Boardman talks

about, I think the administration
ought to address the student body a
little more personally about a death
among our classmates, the way he did
regarding the Virginia Tech shooting.
The email about that sounded much
less perfunctory than the one or two
line grievance and standard listing of
psychological resources named in
the press release about
Morsette.Though not wrong, it
seems backwards for an administra
tion to say and do more about deaths
on another school's campus than one
on its own.

Fast sets dangerous precedent
That the members of the Stanford
Labor Action Committee (SLAC)
genuinely care for the plight of the
University's workforce not covered
by a living wage is undisputable.
Clearly, by organizing people, host
ing events, and even depriving them
selves of food, they demonstrate not
only their solidarity with those they
feel to be the victims of the universi
ty's policies, but also their willingness
to take action to correct it. For their
determination, they can easily be ad
mired.
Nevertheless, regardless of the
potential righteousness of their
cause (which in itself deserves some
scrutiny), the ongoing fast goes too
far. I strongly feel that it sets a bad
precedent for President 1 lennessy or
the Stanford administration to re
ward such behavior, which might be
considered irresponsible, with presi
dential access and even potential ca
pitulation. I sincerely hope that if
Stanford does adopt a comprehen
sive living wage policy that encom
passes the temporary and part-time
workers it now excludes, it does so
well beyond the time span of this
fast, and on its own accord. 1 am per
sonally convinced that the fasters
will not last too long if the Adminis
tration decides to wait them out. at
least, as I presume they are. if they
are honest about not eating.
My opinion in this matter has
nothing to do with any animosity to
ward SLAC or any great love for the
current living wage policy, though.
Instead. 1 am concerned about the
message the leadership would be
sending were they to buckle to
S LAC's demands.
1 just cannot imagine a future at
Stanford in which groups that may
have fringe agendas attempt to per
form similar practices in order to
gain similar results â€” and perhaps

initiate actions that end in the tragic
deaths of fellow students. Bowing to
SLAC at this point in time would be
tacit acknowledgement that the ad
ministration is susceptible to this
kind of tactic, and would not bode
well for future circumstances, in
which the administration can ab
solutely not afford to break down.
I understand that SLAC feels
that this is the only way in which they
can bring the administration to be ac
countable for its actions, and power
to them if they are able to successful
ly bring about change, but this is not
the right way to go about it. Right
now. my criticism is reserved for
SLAC because their protest should
be ineffective (unless, of course, this
is all a publicity stunt, in which by all
measures, it has been very effective).
However, if the administration does
make serious concessions as a result
of this fasting, my critique really falls
on it for not demonstrating decisive
leadership. At the end of the day. I
have but one request to President
Hennessy: Please do not submit.
