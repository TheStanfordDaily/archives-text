# Cardinal Baseball
## AT BAT FOR A COMEBACK 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What a difference a month
makes.
When the Cardinal first faced Cal
this season, the team was in the
midst of an eight-game win streak
and achieved a milestone: the pro
gram's 2500 th win. But since sweep
ing the Bears, Stanford has struggled
to a 5-13 record, managing only one
conference win in that stretch.
The Cardinal (15-18, 1-8 Pacific
-10 Conference) hopes to regain
some of its early season form when it
heads to Berkeley, Calif, this week
end for a conference series against
Cal (19-19,3-6).
"Everything was kind of snow
balling. and 1 think the attitude of
the team...hasn't allowed us to get
hack yet," freshman righty Jeff
Inman said. "We need to have some
people have good games and get on
a roll again, because as easy as it was
to get into this snowball effect, it's
going to take work to get out of it."
Of the places to start. Berkeley
might be the best fit for the Cardi
nal. Stanford has had success against
the Bears, both this year and histori
cally. Behind a shutout performance
from Inman and junior reliever
David Stringer in a 1-0 win on Mar.
4 and two come-from-behind victo
ries, the Cardinal sweep ensured at
least a season split. Stanford has not
lost a season series to its rival since
1978.
And after playing six games a

year against each other, it's also a
team the Cardinal knows better
than most.
"You're pretty familiar with each
other, but it goes both ways," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "I think

it's a nice thing to do, because if we
didn't play that extra series our fans
wouldn't get a chance to see Cal play
and that's a real shame. It's a good ri
valry, it's good competition and it's
good for our fans."

Hie list of potential improve
ments is long for the Cardinal. The
team's conference woes are reflect
ed in their Pac-10 worst for runs
scored (182) and total hits (310), as
well as its ERA (6.04). This is the

GAME NOTES: Stanford narrowly avoided
three consecutive Pac-10 sweeps this past
Sunday, defeating Arizona, 6-3, in the third
and last games of the set. In doing so, the
Cardinal ended the nation's longest winning
streak, which Arizona held at 16.

Cardinal's highest ERA in team his
tory: the previous high of 5.36 was
set in 1979.
"To he honest, all phases have
been pretty poor." Marquess said.
"Our biggest problem is our offense
hasn't generated a lot of hits and op
portunities to score. We haven't
done a very good job of that, and our
numbers reflect that."
"We need to play a more consis
tent brand of baseball " he added.


TAYLOR CONE/The Stanford Doily
Junior catcher Brian Juhl is hitting .296 for the season heading into this weekend's crucial series against cross-bay
rival California.
Ace Tyson Ross leads the Bears
on the mound,despite the lack of run
support from his teammates. The
star right-hander has lived up to
lofty expectations with a 2.17 ERA.
hut is only 3-5 on the year.
In six of Ross' appearances, the
Bears have scored three or fewer
runs, squandering such gems as a 16-
strikeout performance. At Sunken
Diamond earlier this year, Ross lost
a 1-0 pitcher's duel to Inman. The
Cardinal freshman threw 7.1 innings
of shutout baseball in his first game
against Cal.
"It was early in the year and 1 had
all my pitches going," Inman said.
"I've just got to try and attack them
like 1 did the first time out. That's
been one of the big things that I've
been trying to work on; people have
been telling me I haven't had a good
attack."
Though the team's strength is its
staff, the Bears have two impressive
offensive leaders, transfer David

Cooper (.359, 9. 37 RBI) and Jeff
Kobernus (.346,16 RBI). Both have
cooled off since starting the season
batting over .400. but Cooper is still
in the top 10 in four major offensive
categories: hits (52), slugging per
centage (.62K), RBIs and homeruns.
Stanford pitching was able to
keep both in check in the earlier
non-conference series, especially
Cooper, who went 1-14 from the
plate.
The first two of the pitching
matchups are set. with the Sunday
starters likely to come out sometime
today. In tonight's series opener,
Ross will go up against sophomore
lefty Jeremy Bleich.The Bears' and
Cardinal's wins leaders, Alex Rollin
(7-2) and Inman (3-2). will pitch on
Saturday
"It's definitely a big series be
cause we dropped two series in the
Pac-10," Inman said,"and if we want
to show people how we can play, we
need to start winning and start win
ning now."
First pitch on Friday is scheduled
for 6:30 p.m. in Berkeley.
