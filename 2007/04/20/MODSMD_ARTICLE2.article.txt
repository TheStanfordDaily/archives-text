# Cardinal Baseball
## AT BAT FOR A COMEBACK 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What a difference a month
makes.
When the Cardinal first faced Cal
this season, the team was in the
midst of an eight-game win streak
and achieved a milestone: the pro
gram's 2500 th win. But since sweep
ing the Bears, Stanford has struggled
to a 5-13 record, managing only one
conference win in that stretch.
The Cardinal (15-18, 1-8 Pacific
-10 Conference) hopes to regain
some of its early season form when it
heads to Berkeley, Calif, this week
end for a conference series against
Cal (19-19,3-6).
"Everything was kind of snow
balling. and 1 think the attitude of
the team...hasn't allowed us to get
hack yet," freshman righty Jeff
Inman said. "We need to have some
people have good games and get on
a roll again, because as easy as it was
to get into this snowball effect, it's
going to take work to get out of it."
Of the places to start. Berkeley
might be the best fit for the Cardi
nal. Stanford has had success against
the Bears, both this year and histori
cally. Behind a shutout performance
from Inman and junior reliever
David Stringer in a 1-0 win on Mar.
4 and two come-from-behind victo
ries, the Cardinal sweep ensured at
least a season split. Stanford has not
lost a season series to its rival since
1978.
And after playing six games a

year against each other, it's also a
team the Cardinal knows better
than most.
"You're pretty familiar with each
other, but it goes both ways," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "I think

it's a nice thing to do, because if we
didn't play that extra series our fans
wouldn't get a chance to see Cal play
and that's a real shame. It's a good ri
valry, it's good competition and it's
good for our fans."

Hie list of potential improve
ments is long for the Cardinal. The
team's conference woes are reflect
ed in their Pac-10 worst for runs
scored (182) and total hits (310), as
well as its ERA (6.04). This is the

GAME NOTES: Stanford narrowly avoided
three consecutive Pac-10 sweeps this past
Sunday, defeating Arizona, 6-3, in the third
and last games of the set. In doing so, the
Cardinal ended the nation's longest winning
streak, which Arizona held at 16.

Cardinal's highest ERA in team his
tory: the previous high of 5.36 was
set in 1979.
"To he honest, all phases have
been pretty poor." Marquess said.
"Our biggest problem is our offense
hasn't generated a lot of hits and op
portunities to score. We haven't
done a very good job of that, and our
numbers reflect that."
"We need to play a more consis
tent brand of baseball " he added.
