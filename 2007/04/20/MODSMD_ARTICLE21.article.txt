## Ratliff rakes in experience 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
112 or the casual fan, centerfielder Scan Ratliff may not
have st(K)d out among Stanford baseball's up-and-coming
offensive force last year. As a freshman, he pitched 28 in
nings. earned a 2-0 record and 6.75 ERA, and failed to col
lect a single hit in 14 at-bats.
Following a position switch in the offseason, though,
Ratliff has become a dangerous presence at the plate dur
ing his sophomore campaign. And with Stanford baseball
struggling to stay afloat in the Pacific-10 Conference, the
I.ongmont.Colo. native enters this weekend's crucial series
against California as Stanford's offensive leader.
The team leader in runs. hits, home runs and slugging
percentage, Ratliff said that it may all be just one more step
toward his major-league goals. Ihe first obstacle he faced
was being noticed in a state not known for producing top
level talent.
"My whole life I've been working to play baseball for a
living," Ratliff said. "All through high school,that's all I was
working for — to keep getting looks from D-l programs
and guys at the major-league level — and that's tough to do
in Colorado.A lot of guys don't get looks because it'sacold
weather state — not too many people are flocking to Col
orado to find talent."

After scoring just two runs last year, Ratliff s 33
runs this season have accounted for nearly 20
percent of the Cardinal's total. The dynamic

sophomore, who is also tied for second on the

team for RBI (17), still sees a long road

ahead despite his recent improvements.
"I think I've fixed some things with my
swing that I was struggling with last

year," he said. "Obviously I'm still
not anywhere near where I need
t,, ka Kut 1W koH enma cn/._

to r>e. out 1 ve nau some suc
cess. I've been seeing the ball
well, and I've been getting
some balls to go in. but it's a
process, and I'm still trying to

get better every day."
Ratliffs first priority at
the plate is reducing his
strikeout rate; he leads the

team with 41 Ks. But overall, '
the standout sophomore is
mostly looking to improve his
team's chances as he grows into

his role in the leadoff slot.
"My strikeout count is
abysmal this year," Ratliff said.
"I'm embarrassed to even think
about it. But other than that, [my
goals are] just being more consis
tent and being able to get on
base and do the things that a
good leadoff hitter needs to. and
get our guys some RBI opportu
nities and score some runs."
If he was just a solid leadoff
hitter. Ratliff would be a more
than welcome addition to the Car
dinal. But his contributions in cen
terfield may be just as important

to his team's chances in this season's Pac-10.
Ratliff has notched a perfect 1 .(X) fielding percentage
this year and lists St. Louis Cardinals' centerfielder Jim Ed
monds, known for his Gold Glove ability and flair in center,
as one of his three greatest baseball role models.The other
two? 1 lis father and hall-of-famerTed Williams.
"I've always told coach [Mark] Marquess every time we
have meetings that I feel like I'm as good a defensive out
fielder as we have," Ratliff said. "Nothing short of perfect is
acceptable for me. 1 expect to make every play,and I expect
to do everything right out there."
Marquess said he has been impressed with his center
fielder's progress at the plate and in the field but empha
sized that he and Stanford's coaching staff have seen
Ratliff s talent and potential all along.
"[Ratliff has| had a good year," Marquess said.'i don't
think he's exceeded my expectations because we knew he
had the potential to be a good player. He can get better,and
I think he knows that. I le's going to get better the more he
plays and gets a little more experience both offensively and
defensively."
As a major statistical leader for Stanford, both offen
sively and defensively, Ratliff seems to be trying to embrace
his role as a vocal leader for the team.
"I 've been told that this is both a gift and a curse, but I'm

a little bit more fiery than most people," he said.
"It tends to get me in trouble sometimes —
I'll say something to an umpire if I don't

think the call was good, or I'll yap at some
of my teammates if I don't think they're
doing something the right way. But 1 think
it just shows how much heart I have and
how much love I have for the game, and

how much I want to be out here every
day."

With the Cardinal's hack to
the wall in the Pac-10, however, it's
been the sophomore's leadership
by example that has most ini-

pressed Marquess.
"I would agree he's fiery, and
that's good," said the veteran

Stanford coach, now in his 30th
year at the helm of the program."! le
plays hard, he's very competitive.
J ♦u..* „

Sometimes you ve got to control that a
little bit. and he does a pretty good job of
that. But he plays hard, and 1 think guys re
spect the way he plays, and that's important."

Ratliff knows that the Cardinal has to
get things turned around quickly in the Pac-10,
going so far as to claim it was of "paramount"
importance to win tonight's matchup against
the Bears. Stanford needs to show that it re-

mains a force to be reckoned with in the confer
ence. But despite the Cardinal's sub .500 record,
Stanford's table-setter still thinks things could turn
around quickly.

"I've seen us play great against really good
teams," Ratliff said, "and I think we're capable of turning
this season around in one weekend."
If his confidence is contagious, there may yet he hope for
Stanford baseball.

percentage, Ratliff said that it may all be just one more step
toward his major-league goals. Ihe first obstacle he faced
was being noticed in a state not known for producing top
level talent.
"My whole life I've been working to play baseball for a
living," Ratliff said. "All through high school,that's all I was
working for — to keep getting looks from D-l programs
and guys at the major-league level — and that's tough to do
in Colorado.A lot of guys don't get looks because it'sacold
weather state — not too many people are flocking to Col
orado to find talent."

After scoring just two runs last year, Ratliff s 33
runs this season have accounted for nearly 20
percent of the Cardinal's total. The dynamic

sophomore, who is also tied for second on the

team for RBI (17), still sees a long road

ahead despite his recent improvements.
"I think I've fixed some things with my
swing that I was struggling with last

year," he said. "Obviously I'm still
not anywhere near where I need
t,, ka Kut 1W koH enma cn/._

to r>e. out 1 ve nau some suc
cess. I've been seeing the ball
well, and I've been getting
some balls to go in. but it's a
process, and I'm still trying to

get better every day."
Ratliffs first priority at
the plate is reducing his
strikeout rate; he leads the

team with 41 Ks. But overall, '
the standout sophomore is
mostly looking to improve his
team's chances as he grows into

his role in the leadoff slot.
"My strikeout count is
abysmal this year," Ratliff said.
"I'm embarrassed to even think
about it. But other than that, [my
goals are] just being more consis
tent and being able to get on
base and do the things that a
good leadoff hitter needs to. and
get our guys some RBI opportu
nities and score some runs."
If he was just a solid leadoff
hitter. Ratliff would be a more
than welcome addition to the Car
dinal. But his contributions in cen
terfield may be just as important

to his team's chances in this season's Pac-10.
Ratliff has notched a perfect 1 .(X) fielding percentage
this year and lists St. Louis Cardinals' centerfielder Jim Ed
monds, known for his Gold Glove ability and flair in center,
as one of his three greatest baseball role models.The other
two? 1 lis father and hall-of-famerTed Williams.
"I've always told coach [Mark] Marquess every time we
have meetings that I feel like I'm as good a defensive out
fielder as we have," Ratliff said. "Nothing short of perfect is
acceptable for me. 1 expect to make every play,and I expect
to do everything right out there."
Marquess said he has been impressed with his center
fielder's progress at the plate and in the field but empha
sized that he and Stanford's coaching staff have seen
Ratliff s talent and potential all along.
"[Ratliff has| had a good year," Marquess said.'i don't
think he's exceeded my expectations because we knew he
had the potential to be a good player. He can get better,and
I think he knows that. I le's going to get better the more he
plays and gets a little more experience both offensively and
defensively."
As a major statistical leader for Stanford, both offen
sively and defensively, Ratliff seems to be trying to embrace
his role as a vocal leader for the team.
"I 've been told that this is both a gift and a curse, but I'm

a little bit more fiery than most people," he said.
"It tends to get me in trouble sometimes —
I'll say something to an umpire if I don't

think the call was good, or I'll yap at some
of my teammates if I don't think they're
doing something the right way. But 1 think
it just shows how much heart I have and
how much love I have for the game, and

how much I want to be out here every
day."

With the Cardinal's hack to
the wall in the Pac-10, however, it's
been the sophomore's leadership
by example that has most ini-

pressed Marquess.
"I would agree he's fiery, and
that's good," said the veteran

Stanford coach, now in his 30th
year at the helm of the program."! le
plays hard, he's very competitive.
J ♦u..* „

Sometimes you ve got to control that a
little bit. and he does a pretty good job of
that. But he plays hard, and 1 think guys re
spect the way he plays, and that's important."

Ratliff knows that the Cardinal has to
get things turned around quickly in the Pac-10,
going so far as to claim it was of "paramount"
importance to win tonight's matchup against
the Bears. Stanford needs to show that it re-

mains a force to be reckoned with in the confer
ence. But despite the Cardinal's sub .500 record,
Stanford's table-setter still thinks things could turn
around quickly.

"I've seen us play great against really good
teams," Ratliff said, "and I think we're capable of turning
this season around in one weekend."
If his confidence is contagious, there may yet he hope for
Stanford baseball.
