## 
### SARA LANNIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (4-7) hosts rival California (5-
6) this weekend. The Bears are cur
rently ranked third in the Mountain
Sports Pacific Federation standings,
right ahead of No. 4 Stanford. The
game should he intense, as Stanford
tries to upset Cal and the Bears look
to snap a five-game losing streak.
Stanford's only scheduled game
last week, an away match-up against
Cornell, was cancelled due to an ex
pected snowstorm, so the Cardinal
will have had more than two weeks of
downtime since it last played.
The Cardinal's last game against
Denver on Apr. 6 was a struggle, end
ing with a 12-8 loss to the Pioneers.
Denver is having a very successful sea
son, currently ranked second in the
MPSFlistings and No. 16 in the nation.
Last season, the Cardinal and
Golden Bears faced each other
twice, initially during the regular sea
son, followed by a matchup in the
MPSF tournament. Stanford, at the
time ranked No. 17, lost the 9-6 in the
season opener at Cal's field. Re
venge was sweet the second time
around: The Card women, who had
advanced to No. 16. topped the Bears
in the semifinals of the MPSF tour
nament, 17-6.
Last year's victory saw goals by
seven different Cardinal players, led
by junior Daphne Patterson with
five. Patterson was an indispensable
asset to the team during the semifinal
game, tallying an astonishing seven
points thanks to five goals and two

assists. Currently, Patterson is second
on the team for points, having
amassed 20 on the season.
McClain scored two goals against
the Bears in the final game last sea
son. Currently, she is fourth on the
team in scoring (14 goals) and has
tallied eight assists as well for a total
of 22 points. Both DeChant and Mc-
Clain, who have played pivotal roles
on the team thus far, will need to re
peat last year's performances to
clinch the win on Saturday.
Midfielders Liz Piselli and Jamie
Nesbitt both contributed a goal
apiece to last year's win. As a senior
this season, Piselli is third on the
team in scoring (15 goals), which,
combined with her season-long tally
of five assists, gives her 20 points.

Now a sophomore, Nesbitt is seated
at sixth on the team, with a cumula
tive total of eight goals and two as
sists this year.
Ibe Stanford women will be look
ing to their younger players, particu
larly freshmen, to fill this scoring
void in Saturday's game. Freshman
Lauren Schmidt is tied with Patter
son as the team's highest scorer, and
her fellow freshmen teammates
Dana Lindsay and Amanda Schwab
have both notched four goals on the
season.
Saturday's matchup will be the
Card's last home game of the season.
Play starts at 1 p.m. at Maloney Field.
