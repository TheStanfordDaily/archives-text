# Tennis seeks Pac-10 title
## 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
With a conference championship
and a rivalry match on the line, the
Stanford women's tennis team caps
off its regular-season schedule by vis
iting California at 12 p.m. on Satur
day. The Cardinal, which holds a one
game lead over Southern California
in the Pacific-10 Conference stand
ings. can clinch the conference title
with a win,or if USC loses to UCLA.
Despite the conference champi
onship implications that the match
holds, freshman Lindsay Burdette
said that the title is only of nominal
importance.
"The Pac-10 Championship is
definitely secondary to how much
momentum this match could give us
going into the beginning rounds of
[the NCAA Championships]," she
said.
Stanford comes into Saturday's
match having won 17 in a row; the
team's last loss was on Feb. 3 against
Georgia Tech at the National Team
Indoors.
As head coach Lele Forood ex
plained. though, the scores were
somewhat misleading. Many close
matches could have gone one way or
the other, and in both cases, the 6-1
final score was not completely in
dicative of the caliber of Cal's squad.
"They're a very talented team,"
Forood said. "We've had matches
[against Cal| that certainly weren't as
one-sided as the score would sug
gest."
Iliis weekend's meeting will be
the third time that the two teams
have matched up this season, and the

fact that the players have seen so
much of each other should add an in
teresting dynamic to the match.
"It's really tough to play a team
this many times," Forood said. "It's
very, very tough to see the same team
over and over and to he successful. It
kind of builds the pressure on us
more to keep it up."
On the contrary, Burdette didn't
think that the number of times the
teams have played would affect the
outcome of the match.
"We know how their coach coach
es, and we know the mentality of all
the girls since we've seen them so
much," the freshman said, exuding
an air of confidence. "Even though
they switch it up, we've got their
numbers."
In particular, the top two players
in Cal's lineup will present problems
for the Cardinal. California junior
Susie Babos is the reigning NCAA
Singles Champion; but Stanford's
No. 1 player, Theresa Logar, has had
her number this season, defeating
her both times that they have met.
Cal also features tough matchups
from senior Zsuzsanna Fodor and
freshman Nina Henkel. In the Gold
en Bears' last match against Stan

ford, Henkel was the only member
of Cal's team to record a victory.
Despite the challenges that Stan
ford expects to see from these play
ers, Forood praised Cal's lineup as a
whole.
"The other parts of their lineup
have been very effective against
other teams," she said. "1 think
they're pretty solid players all the
way through the lineup."
On top of the stiff competition
Stanford expects to see, the elements
at Berkeley are never easy to con
tend with either.The physical make
up of the I lellman Tennis Center can
make things tough for visiting play
ers. As Forood explained, the condi
tions are often windy and there
aren't backstops behind the nets,
making it hard to see.
Yet, although the elements and
Cal's home-court advantage may
play a possible factor in the match,
the Cardinal will do its best to block
out all outside distractions.The team
takes on the personality of its cap
tains, Logar and Anne Yelsey, in tak
ing care of business.
The Stanford women have played
a number of close matches over their
17-match winning streak, proving
their experience in tough situations.
This past weekend, a USC manager
even went so far as to say that the
Cardinal is like a "cat with nine
lives." It was perhaps an accurate as
sessment, although Stanford's track
record of winning the last three na
tional titles might suggest a feline of
higher pedigree. The Bears will find
out on Saturday.
