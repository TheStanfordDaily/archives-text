# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students vote paper cut Abstentions, opposition from grad students likely mean no more more or Mere deliveries 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Every weekday, students across campus wake
up to free copies of The New York Times and The
San Jose Mercury News. But that will likely change
after the Stanford News Readership Program
(SNRP) failed to win special fees in last week's
ASSU elections.
While SNRP received more than 50 percent
support among those who cast a ballot, there were
so many abstentions that the group failed to meet
the threshold required for special fees— 15 per
cent of the overall student body.
As a result, it is unlikely that SNRP will be able
to continue providing newspapers next year unless
it finds funding from another source. Without spe
cial fees, the group can receive a maximum of
$6,000 from the ASSU — not enough to cover its
budget.
SNRP president Aaron Qayumi '09 said he is
currently looking into alternative financial options,
including private donors, the ASSU and the Uni
versity. Qayumi said it is likely that the program's
lack of special fees will lead to a suspension of its
services next year.
"I'm not too optimistic but will do what 1 can,"
Qayumi said."We will look into alternative funding
methods as much as possible but I'm not consider
ing any of the options as really reliable."
ASSU President Elizabeth 1 leng "07 said that
groups who have failed to receive special fees in the
past have looked for alternative funds though ad
ministrators and other donors.

"Although I believe that the News Reader
ship Program is one of the best programs that has
ever come out of the ASSU, the majority of the
student body has voted against the program on
special fees," she said in an email to The Daily.
"Unfortunately, ASSU reflects the student body
and it would be contradictory to fund something
that the student body does not want to fund."
SNRP originated in 2002 and distributes
newspapers to about 20 locations on campus, in
cluding the Graduate Community Center and
the CoHo.
"The program has overwhelming undergrad
support but the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) is kind of morally opposed to it," Qayumi
said. "They think it is just a way for the newspa
pers to increase their readership and some grad
students don't think the program caters to them
even though we have distribution sites for them
and the racks are always empty."
GSC member Jeff Laretto JD '08 questioned
SN RP's advertising techniques.
"The program doesn't market and distribute
to graduate students." he said. "I looked at their
marketing budget and it is $200. which means
they aren't really advertising."
GSC Appropriations Committee Chair and
computer science graduate student Adam Be
berg said students can just as easily visit the
newspapers' Web sites.
"I think it boils down to the idea that we all
know how to operate a Web browser and from
the results many undergrads and grads felt that
way," he said in an email to The Daily.
For his part. Qayumi said that students will
miss the newspapers next year.
"This failure is an example of a student group
students approve of and want that didn't get
through," he said. "When people don't have the
newspapers, they might appreciate it more."
