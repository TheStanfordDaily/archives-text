## Stegner fellows selected from record-size pool 
### JACKIE CHU 
The Creative Writing Program (CWP) an
nounced its 2007-2008 Stegner Fellows last
week. Five poets and five fiction writers were
chosen from among more than 1.4(H) appli
cants.
"It's the most applications we've ever had."
said Program Assistant Ryan Jacobs.
Program Director Eavan Boland said defining
exactly what makes an application stand out is
difficult.
"What we look for can't exactly he codified
but we all certainly know it when we see it," she
said in an email to The Daily. "A strong, inde
pendent voice, a real and continuing feel for
language. Ambitious subjects are part of it."
Jacobs said that faculty play a critical role in the
selection process.
"It's the faculty that reads [the applica
tions]." he said. "They usually find a few stand
outs."
The Stegner Fellowship is a two-year pro
gram named after Wallace Stegner. an Ameri
can environmentalist who founded CWP. The
fellowship covers tuition and writers receive
$22,000 per year for living expenses.
Boland said that the fellows work with a dis
tinguished faculty consisting of published writ
ers.
"That's what makes the program so strong
â€” continuing exchange and conversation be
tween poets and fiction writers in the process of
finding themselves and their work." Boland
said.
"These are writers we admire." she added.
"We're very glad to have them, although every
year we wish we had more fellowships to give
out."
