Agreement reached in Africa

On Friday, an agreement was reached between the
;overnment of the Central African Republic and

the armed group calling itself the
Union of Democratic Forces

>r Reconstruction (UFDR,a
rench acronym).

Since its liberation
from France in 1%0. the \
CAR was ruled by a series
ot military dictatorships
until a decade-long period
of elected civilian rule
began in 1993. The current

President, General Francois
Bozize, seized power in a coup.

leading a two-year transitional j
government until his authority was
ratified by a national election in

2005.
Rebel groups have plagued Bozize since his assumption of
power, but lately Bozize has been combining anti-rebel mili
tary offensives with conciliatory negotiations. Last week's
agreement with the UFDR. for example, follows a February
peace deal with rebel chief Abdoulaye Miskine, who com
manded the ID PC, or Democratic Front for the Liberation of
the Central African People.
Friday's accord, formalized in the northern town of Birao
and near the borders of both Chad and Sudan, was signed be
fore Bozize and rebel military commander Damane Zakaria,
and in the presence of Famine Cisse. a special representative
of the Secretary General of the United Nations. Also in atten
dance were officers of the Central African military; of
FOMUC, a regional military force drawn from an amalgam of
Central African states; and representatives of the French mili
tary.
Last December, the French Defense Ministry admitted to
and defended orders it had given its pilots to fly their Mirage
jets on sorties against rebel groups in Chad and the CAR.The
French government's reasoning centered on the tens of thou
sands of refugees from the Darfur crisis, who are pouring into
and destabilizing the Chad and the CAR The government of
the CAR has asked for French and other international assis
tance in containing not only the refugee population, but also
the many armed rebel groups in the Sudan border region that
it says are backed by the Khartoum regime of Omar al-Bashir.
French presidenfiol campaigns enter final strelc
The major candidates for the office of the president of
France have entered the final sprint of their campaigns this
week, as they prepare for Sunday's vote to decide who will suc
ceed outgoing President Jacques Chirac, in office since 1995.

In order to win the presidency on

Sunday, a candidate will need not only
to get more votes than his or her oppo
nents, but also an absolute majority

of the electorate.
\ As it stands, however, this

12-candidate race is divided

enough that no one ex
\ pects it to be decided

after Sunday's

round. Instead.
\ the two leading

candidates from

Sunday's elec-

tion will go on to a runoff election

in the first week of May. the winner of which
will officially be the next French president.

The four leading candidates and their expected shares of
the electorate, according to French research firm Ipsos. are as
follows: Jean-Marie Le Pen at 13.5 percent. Francois Bayrou at
18.5 percent. Segolene Royal at 24.5 percent and Nicolas
Sarkozy at 29.5 percent.
Le Pen. an extreme right-wing candidate who shocked

French voters by making it into the
runoff stage with Chirac in the last elec
tion. represents a xenophobic, anti-

immigration element of
the conservative
French. He is

expected to
draw some
right-wing
voters fron

frontrunner Nicolas
Sarkozy, the main-

stream conservative \
candidate and veteran of
the Chirac government.
Sarkozy presided as in
terior minister during the
series of riots that rocked
the suburbs of many

French cities in
autumn 2005. S
He is the
most pro-

/ American and â€”
/ pro-big business of all candi
y dates, and in recent months he has sharpened his
stance on immigration in order to counteract Le Pen's
S gravity.
The candidate that Sarkozy is most likely to face in
May's second round of elections is Segolene Royal, a socialist
candidate who was born not in France, but in the Senegalese
city of Dakar. If victorious. Royal will be the first female Pres
ident of France. Like Sarkozy, Royal has been obliged to en

gage in a battle against the more radical elements of her base
the ballot on Sunday will feature some hardcore left
wingers, including Trotskyites, a Communist, and a strong anti
globalization candidate. Some analysts believe that, with all
the maneuvering that Royal and Sarkozy have done to try to
best their respective left- and right-wing competition, it may be
difficult for them to make a general appeal to all voters in the
second round.
Failing a Royal victory, the other possible challenger to
Sarkozy is the centrist candidate Francois Bayrou, whom many
see as a moderate alternative to the frontrunners. Bayrou, a
pro-farmer candidate who is praised by his supporters for what
they view as his levelheadedness and reasonability. has profit
ed in recent weeks from the "frustration vote," as some mem
bers of the French public have grown more and more dissatis
fied with Sarkozy and Royal. A late surge in Bayrou's poll
numbers has leveled off in recent weeks.

Iraq bombings kill 171

ITie deadliest series of attacks since the February begin
ning of the U.S. military's "troop surge" in Iraq took place
on Wednesday in the capital, killing at least 171 Iraqis,
mostly Shiites. Five bombs detonated across Baghdad (four
were car or truck bombs), although the most deadly attack
took place in the Shiite market area known as Sadriya,
where at least 140 were killed.

Sadriya was shut down and fortified with blast
walls by the U.S. military in February, after another
deadly attack left more than 100 dead at that time. Lt.

Colonel Christopher Garver, a spokesperson for the
U.S. military, said that it was too soon to judge the surge
because only 60 percent of the planned troop increase

is currently in place. He added that exe

cution-style killings have gone down
, since February but that bomb- .

ings have remained steady.
Also on Wednesday, Iraqi
Prime Minister Maliki an- I

nounced that the Iraqi govern-

, ment plans to take
' complete control

/ of Iraq's security
' forces from the U.S. \
military by the end of '

next year.
