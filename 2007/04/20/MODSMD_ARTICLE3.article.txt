## Va. shooting prompts Univ. policy review Police trained, armed with special weapons, for crisis 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new Stanford committee will conduct an
evaluation of its emergency protocols in the
wake of Monday's shootings at Virginia Tech
University. The protocol review, which will be
led by Vice President for Business Affairs
Randy Livingston, was announced in a state
ment concerning the massacre by President
John Hennessy.
"The terrible ordeal suffered there reminds
us how precious life is and how important it is
that we all redouble our efforts to prevent such
tragedies in the future," Hennessy said. "At
Stanford, we plan to review all of our emer
gency response protocols. 'ITic safety of the
Stanford community will always be a top prior
ity for us."
Police at Virginia Tech have drawn criticism
for their decision not to lock down the campus
after the initial shootings in West Ambler John
son Hall, a dormitory.
Chris Cohendet, a deputy at the Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS), said the police
train for what he called "an active shooter situ
ation." In such a case, officers would call togeth
er nearby agencies and attempt to control the
situation.
"There's obviously a lot of things that go
through your mind," he said. "You want to be
sure the community is safe. But you've got to
figure things out. For instance, at [Virginia
Tech, officers] received what they
thought was a domestic dispute call
earlier on. And within that time frame
the police department |was| getting
numerous calls with differing infor
mation. It's really hard for a police de
partment to filter all of this informa
tion."
For these kinds of situations, Stan
ford's police cruisers carry a variety of
weapons in addition to the standard
issue handguns. They are also
equipped with non-lethal weapons,
such as tasers, as well as more power
ful alternatives, including shotguns.
"Basically, if there's something
going on where someone is going
through buildings and shooting away,
law enforcement has to grab teams
together and react," Cohendet said.
"We would have to engage the sus
pect, in this case."
Greg Boardman, vice provost for
student affairs, said the University
would take Monday's incident into
account while reviewing its policies
for students with mental health issues.
The Virginia Tech shooter. Cho
Seung-Hui. had previously been com
mitted to a psychiatric facility by the
Blacksburg, Va. university but was re
leased when two female students he
had harassed decided not to press
charges against him.
"In recounition of the increasing

considering what

prevalence and complexity of student
mental health issues both nationally
and here at Stanford, we have been in
the process of studying tne Universi
ty's policies and procedures as well as
our campus climate through the work
of the Mental Health and Well Being
Task Force," he wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Created in October 2006.
the task force is composed of stu
dents, staff and faculty.and it has been
meeting regularly since the fall in
order to assess our current policies
and determine where we can make

improvements.
Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Roger Printup was un
sure what changes would come from
these initiatives.
"I am sure that not only Stanford
but every college and university will
be considering what this event means
for a large number of issues," he wrote
in an email to The Daily. "Campus se
curity and mental health [are] the two
most obvious issues. But it is way too
early to speculate on what specific ac
tions might be taken before institu
tions have an opportunity to examine
those issues thoughtfully and in
depth."
Betts Gorsky. who was on campus
for Admit Weekend and whose
daughter will attend Stanford next
year, said that the shootings did not
change her view of campus security.
"I think that it's very difficult for
any school to protect against random
acts of violence like that," she said.
"Maybe it will make individuals a lit
tle more observant and willing to
react if they see or hear something
from a student that seems out of the
ordinary or depressed. But it's always
easy to have 20/20 hindsight."
