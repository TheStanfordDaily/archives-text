# News alert: Bat Boy found... on Capitol Hill!
## 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION CONGRESSIONAL BAT BOY 
As part of President Bush's na
tionwide abstinence program enti
tled "Keep It in Your Pants Billy,"
Congress has enlisted the supernat
ural. Alter his debut in the June 23,
1992 issue of "Weekly World
News," the infamous "Bat Boy,"
son of country singer Susan Boy.
was integrated quickly into popular
freak culture alongside Janet Reno
and the platypus. Since then, the av
erage teenager's libido has grown to
the size of an engorged grapefruit
and drastic measures have been set

in placc by the administration that
brought you WMDs and the plan to
colonize Mars.
The history behind this new ab
stinence measure is as strange as a
two-legged dog doing the 100-
meter dash. Roughly four months
ago. Bat Boy emerged from his
dank cave somewhere in the Ap
palachians, squinting into the sun
and ambling up the stairs of the
Capitol Building. Aging rapidly
and growing what can only be de
scribed as a piece of mold under his
nose. Bat Boy attempted to gain
the respect of his fellow Congress
man by legally changing his name
to Bat Man. However, finding the

copyright to that name taken, he
has since become the chafing
chastity belt on America's loins
under the moniker of Congress
man Henry Waxman (thanks for
letting us know, Conan!).
Bat Boy / Waxman's appear
ance alone (see above diagram)
has been known to turn flaccid
even the most vocal of proponents
of safe sex. Coupled with his poi
soned tipped fangs and protection
of affluent homeowners from
methane gas explosions, Waxman
has been known to appear in the
back of your father'scar at the pre
cise moment things got "interest
ing." (Editor's note: The United

States government defines "inter
esting" as godless decisions that
lead to eternal hellfire.)
So as Admit Weekend continues

and you doc-eyed ProFros get in
touch with your parcntless selves,
remember — the Waxman is
watching!
