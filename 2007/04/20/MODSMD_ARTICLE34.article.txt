## College: Sorry, isn't TV 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION CO-ED 
Unless you had an older sibling
or friend in college whom you had
the pleasure of visiting (without an
adult presence) before you went off
to college yourself, then the TV
world's representation of college
was probably one of the only
glimpses you had into university
life. I personally was convinced that
college was going to be like "Felici
ty" on the WB. While this turned
out not quite to be the case (I think
Felicity spent way too much time
obsessing about Ben and Noel to
have time to get a degree from any
school), some shows did a far worse
job of portraying college than "Fe
licity" did. Here they are, in order of
increasing ridiculousness:
5. "The OC"
Granted, out of the "OC" bunch
only Summer even went to college.
Biggest flaw: 1 don't think the show
had Summer going to a class once
during her brief college stint (which
ended after about 5 minutes when
she was kicked out for the whole
"setting animals free that she
thought were being tortured for
pointless research" thing, also quite
realistic). In fact, I'm not sure if
Summer ever even carried anything
larger than a purse (which would
hold, say, books). Now I know she
was only attending "Brown"
(which is in quota-

lions because even a second-grader
could tell that, with the exception
of, like, two overhead campus shots,
this most certainly was not filmed at
Brown), but 1 think that the stu
dents still have classes there.
4. "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
Buffy goes to UC Sunnydale. Ha
ha. That's a fake school. Now on to
the real problems...
What? There are no vampires at
real college? Yes. I know, the vam
pires are metaphors for all sorts of
trials and tribulations experienced
by plucky protagonist Buffy. Fine.
However, even if we let the whole
supernatural thing slide by, it was
just too much when the whole back
story about Buffy's sort of hot TA
(though he was no Angel) Riley was
revealed. You see, Riley worked for
a secret military-ish agency called
the Initiative, conveniently run by
one of Buffy's professors, which
was on a crusade to hunt and cap
ture all of the evil creatures in Sun
nydale. Did 1 mention that the giant
headquarters for this Initiative- —
where, among other things, all of
the captured demon creatures were
kept as prisoners — were located
underneath UC Sunnydale? Ridicu
lous!
3. "Dawson's Creek"
Yes, those crazy kids from
"Dawson's Creek" went through
two entire years of college on the
show (most people I know had
given up on the show by that point,
so that fact might have slipped by
some of you). There were too many
flaws with this one to list, so I'll just
recall one specific event that I al
ways found particularly amusing:
After her first semester of college.
Joey finds herself inside of some
. magical building that has about 10
\ printouts taped up on the wall.
A I'm not sure if these printouts

were supposed to represent only
Joey's classes or everybody that
attended the school, but, ci-

ther way. the printouts rele
vant to Joey appeared to all
conveniently be arranged in

a single row. What did these
printouts display? They
displayed the final grades

that Joey had gotten in
each of her classes.
Right. Not once in col-

lege have 1 looked up a
course grade on a print-

out taped to a wall. Here at Stan
ford. we find out our course grades

using computers. I'd venture to say
that that's how it's done at other
places too.
2. "Saved by the Bell, The College
Years"
Blink and you missed this one
anyway, as it only lasted for one sea
son. hut this show featured some of
our favorite characters from the
classic "Saved Bv the Bell" in what
apparently was supposed to he col
lege (though not Jessie, who didn't
go to the same college as the others
and whom I only mention now he
cause true fans might recall that she
was rejected from her dream
school, Staasbury). I was only eight
when this aired, but 1 wasn't fooled
by its nonsense. Most egregious
misrepresentations of college: 1)
The professors always seemed to be
in the students' rooms and at their
parties; 2) Even the Dean was al
ways hanging out with the fresh
men... often willingly; 3) The RA
equivalent for the dorm was an ex
pro football player; 4) Kelly was
pre-med? Zach passed an ethics
exam when nobody else did'.' and 5)
Zach and Kelly got engaged as
freshmen and set off to Vegas for
their wedding. FYI: The wedding
— occurring in the two-hour TV
movie classic "Wedding in Las
Vegas" — sadly signaled the end of
"Saved By the Bell" forever (un
less, God help you, you watched
"The New Class").
1. "Beverly Hills. 90210"
Was 1 surprised when 1 came to col
lege that I didn't find myself living in a
sprawling "beach apartment" (as
Donna and Kelly called it) but instead
was sharing about 600 total square feet
with two other people? Was 1 surprised
that I never found myself entangled in
an affair with a professor (and not only
me, but half of my friends too)? Was I
surprised that 1 never was faced with
the dilemma of taking cocaine in order
to stay up to finish my work (and that
my friends also had issues with diet
pills, prescription drugs and crystal
mcth)? Was I surprised that my peers
didn't look like they were 30? Was 1
surprised that my professor didn't
brainwash me into joining a cult? Was
1 surprised that for aside job my friends
didn't operate a night club (at the ripe
young age of 18,1 might add)?
Not really. Nobody watched
"90210" expecting a realistic portrayal
of anything. However, it does, there
fore. win the award hands down for the
most laughable portrayal of college.
