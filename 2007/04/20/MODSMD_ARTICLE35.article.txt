# Wait there's sex in that movie!

### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION EEX-IN-MOVIES EXPERT 
Let's face it — sex in the movies is
better than sex as most of us will ever
know it: The participants are gor
geous, the lighting's always perfect
and the soundtrack is perfectly at
tuned to your every caress and
Compared to the silver screen, real
sex seems messy and downright awk
ward. Next time you need to spice up
your love life, skip the frat party and
head right to Blockbuster to' check
out these top-10 greatest sex scenes
in celluloid history.
1. "8 Mile" — After extensive fore
play consisting of a rap that manages
to offend black people, homosexuals
and the proletariat, Eminem has his
way with a scantily clad Brittany
Murphy in a Detroit factory. Roman
tic. The hottest thing about this scene
is its urgent realism: The characters
barely speak, don't fully remove their
clothes and the camera doesn't look
away for one second of the action
(which clocks in at about five min
utes, if you're keeping score — dis
appointing in real life, but impressive
on the screen).
2. "Y Tu Mama Tambien" — Any
film that begins with an explicit sex
scene is pretty solid in my book. The
movie twists into an erotic labyrinth
as bewitching Ana Lopez Mercado
seduces teenaged Diego Luna and
then a best friend, played by the in
credibly attractive Gael Garcia
Bernal. Of course, the three in
evitably — and thankfully — end up
in a steamy threesome with a guy-on
guy liplock that makes "Brokeback
Mountain" look like "Gilligan's Is
land."
3. "Raging Bull" — This black and
white Scorsese masterpiece takes a
turn for the deeply erotic when boxer
Jake Lamotta (played by a sexy,
young Robert De Niro — those were
the days) forsakes his pre-fight sex
ban for a steamy moment with his
mistress. She maintains steady eye
contact with the camera while licking
down his stomach — only to get
tossed aside at the last moment, leav
ing nobody satisfied but the viewer.
4. "Annie Hall" — Although Woody
Allen is the master of American sex
scenes, his seminal performance is in
"Annie Hall" when he turns on a red
light bulb, strips down to nothing but
boxers, black trouser socks and his
trademark glasses and seduces the
heck out of Diane Keaton. His con
cern over her pleasure manages the
difficult feat of being both heart-melt
ingly tender and unbelievably whiny.

5. "American Beauty" — Four
words: "Fuck me, your majesty." A
disillusioned housewife, played by
Annette Bening, memorably cuck
olds her husband with a self-pro
claimed real estate king (the incredi
bly sexy Peter Gallagher), the result:
some hilarious dirty talk and a new
found respect for Bening's sex god
dess status.
6. "Breathless" — This 1960 Godard
film is the epitome of French New
Wave, and if there's one thing the
French do well — well, they do it
even better naked. Virtually a third
of the entire film (which may or may
not have a plot of some sort) is an ex
tended love scene in which a young
couple lounges in bed, wrinkles the
sheets and blows countless smoke
rings. Yummy.
7. "Cruel Intentions" — While it's
nearly impossible to pick one stand
out scene from this beautiful and sex
soaked film, top honors are a toss-up
between a kinky Sarah Michelle Gel
lar teaching a man how to go down on
her while his girlfriend eavesdrops
and a tender, touching love scene be
tween Ryan Philippe and the virginal
Reese Witherspoon (a former Stan
ford student).
8. "Clockwork Orange" — One of
the funniest scenes in Kubrick's film
about a gang of teenage thugs in a
dystopian future is the unlikely sight
of the movie's anti-hero seducing two
extremely young girls by turns to the
"William Tell Overture." The scene
is played in fast motion: as Alex is
with one girl, the other puts her
clothes back on, only to have them
removed shortly thereafter. And
while, of course, (statutory) rape is
never funny, the "William Tell Over
ture"? Comic gold.
9. "Risky Business" — In spite of its
'80s cheesiness, watching Tom Cruise
and Rebecca De Mornay get it on in
a train — complete with soft lighting
and a throbbing Tangerine Dream
soundtrack — is the stuff erotic fan
tasy is made of. And cut to 20 years
later, when no one in the free world
would touch Tom Cruise's alien
wang for less than five million bucks.
Who'd have guessed?
10. "Wedding Crashers" — Al
though this movie has sex scenes in
every flavor of crazy and creepy, the
best by far is a montage early in the
film of Vince Vaughn and Owen
Wilson waltzing a bevy of hotties
into the sack one by one, carefully
orchestrated to the classic wedding
song "Shout!" Watching a number
of seductresses fling themselves
onto satin sheets is truly a sight to
behold.
