# Need to impress the chicks? Watch these flicks

### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION GENDERED MOVIE EXPERT 
Sophomore year. I lived with my friend
Debby in Mirrielees. Debby is cool in many
ways. However, one way in which she is par
ticularly cool — especially with the opposite
gender — is her movie collection. Whenever
boys would enter our room and see Debby's
movies on the bookcase in our living room
("living room" is a generous designation,
here referring to the tiny square of space in a
Mirrielees apartment between the kitchen
and the single bedroom), they would ask in
awe, "Whose movies are those?" Why were
they awed? Debby's collection includes
many of the movies that 1 would classify as
"guy movies."
What's a guy movie? It's the antithesis of
a chick flick. They involve action, cars, guns,
fights, crime and often Nicolas Cage (find me
a guy that does not think "The Rock" is a cin
ematic masterpiece, and I will pay you). If a
guy movie involves any form of romance at
all, it almost certainly is reduced to a sec
ondary subplot (more likely, though, women
are merely present to take off their clothing).
Debby's collection includes such guy classics
as "Scarface," "The Godfather" trilogy,
"Army of Darkness," various Bond flicks, all
of those movies based on comic books and,
not surprisingly, "The Rock."
Boys visiting our room would also eventu
ally come across my own movie collcction, at
which point they would again inquire,
"Whose movies are those?" Now, I cannot do
justice in writing to the different intonations
used in the pronunciation of the word
"those" when boys were inquiring about
Debby's movies versus my own. However,
let's just say that "those" for Debby meant,
"This girl is the coolest girl 1 have ever met.

and we are going to be best friends right
now," whereas "those" for me connoted,
"These movies are lame. I don't want to see
them — ever. Take me back to Debby's
movies." (For the record, there is nothing
wrong with my movie collection, and most

girls will deem it awesome.)
After much consideration
and thought, I've decided

that there is no reason why 1
this snap judgment based on 1
movie ownership should not '
be bidirectional. 1 do under
stand why guys are impressed
with Debby's collection. They
think to themselves, "Wow. not

only does this girl own these I
movies, but that means she'll also '
willingly and happily watch them
with me." But it works both ways!
If Debby is cool in the eyes of guys
because she owns "Scarface," then
here are some movies that guys
should own to impress us women:

1. "When Harry Met Sally" —This
movie is at the top of every list of best chick
flicks, best romantic comedies, best date
movies, etc. for a reason. Simply put, it's a
classic.
2. A movie with Julia Roberts ("Ocean's
11" does not count) — "Pretty Woman."
"My Best Friend's Wedding." "Notting
Hill." "Erin Brockovich." Choose one. We
like them all.
3. A movie with Brad Pitt ("Ocean's 11""
still does not count. Nor does "Fight Club")
— "Meet Joe Black" or "Legends of the
Fall" would be the most solid choices.
4. Any of the "Harry Potter" films — Males
and females of all ages will freely admit to all
degrees of obsession with the Harry Potter

books. However, the movies seem restricted
to the collections of females. Maybe they're a
little childish, but us gals think they're great.
So, men, get yourself a copy of "Harry Potter

and The Prisoner of Azka
ban" (my _

per
sonal favorite),
and if any-

body ques
tions your

./
manhood, just de
clare that Hermione is hot.

5. Disney classics — "The Little
Mermaid." "Beauty and the Beast." "The
Lion King." "Aladdin." 1 know you guys
liked these movies when you were younger.
We still like them!
6. "Center Stage" — I can't explain why,
but girls love movies about dancing. "Center
Stage" tends to be the favorite. It has some of
the corniest dialogue you have ever heard
and the most unrealistic end dance sequence
you could possibly fathom (and a bulimic girl

and a love story, without which no dance
movie would be complete), but us girls eat it
up like chocolate. For every guy who loves
"The Rock," I will find you a girl who

loves "Center Stage."
7. "Dirty Dancing" and/or "Ghost"

— Again, we like dance movies. We
also like Patrick Swayze (as he ap
peared in "Dirty Dancing" or
"Ghost"; I'm not sure what he's
looking like these days).

8. Grab bag — Choose one of
the following (since I am a realist
and the actual possibility of guys
going and buying any of these
movies is pretty much nil):
i "Beaches." "Bend it Like
\ Beckham." "Clueless." "How

to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.'
"Legally Blonde." "Love Ac
tually." "Love and Bas-

ketball." "Mean
Girls." "The
Notebook."

w Ok, guys are
' probably reading this
list and thinking to
themselves that the day

112 they purchase "Beauty
and the Beast" or "Not
ting Hill" will be the day

that they die. However, I'm
merely providing some food
for thought. Men, try diversi-

fying your movie collections for once, and I
promise it won't go unnoticed by us ladies.
Make us swoon over your movie collections
like you do over Debby's! You want sex
(looking at the overall theme of this issue of
Intermission)? Adding some of these movies
to your shelves might not hurt.
