## Get 'Wild' during Admit Weekend (without the booze) 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION PARTIER 
i
There was a lot <pf talk surrounding "Wild <
Party" this week — what, with posters that I
feature nudity and descriptions that empha- 1
size the sexual nature of the musical. But if 1
you are looking for Gaieties-style raunch, you
will be severely disappointed by this show,
which is ultimately extremely classy.
The generally bubblely atmosphere of this
spring musical from Rams Head is significant
ly enhanced by its incredible set. It nothing
else motivates you to go to Memorial Audito
rium to check out it. I suggest you go for the
backdrops which are quite aesthetically pleas
ing. The costume work and score ot the musi
cal also are beautifully done.
Moreover, the structure "of the musical it
self is intriguing since it is lighter in the first
half, as the audience is introduced to the char
acters and their world. The second half is the
complete opposite, as viewers are then
thrown into a far darker situation.
The opening of the play is fairly light, as the
audience is slowly introduced to the relation
ship of the "sexually ambitious" Queenie
(Lauren Hayes '08) and the "rough" Burrs
(Charlton Gholson '08). This relationship
quickly takes a turn for the worse when Burrs
and Queenie become bored with the status
quo.
In this context. Burrs quickly became my
favorite character because he is given ample
dimensionality and well-played. Despite com-

U
ing across as a bit of a bastard,
Gholson's portrayal of Burrs
is done well enough to en
sure that both Queenie and
him remain morally ques
tionable, as opposed to i

ensuring that the audi
ence would side with
Oueenic in this talc of

111 11110 luiv, \J
love and betrayal.

The musical in
cludes some vulgar
material, including
scenes of partial nu
dity and drug usage.
The audience also
meets some shady

figures. 'Kate (Clea
Alsip '08) is a sleazy
woman who plays
Queenie's foil and

spends most of the
play trying to seduce

Burrs. This is a role
that she pulls off re- ■
markably well, despite
some of the drug scenes that
wprp. sliphtlv oft (for a well-

wtit aiigiiiijr v 1 *-" " " vu
played coke head, I suggest
Mia in "Pulp Fiction" — Kate
does not manage to convey this

well).
My other favorite character actual
ly has very little to do with the plot of
the play, but is so entertaining it

doesn't really matters. Madeleine
True (Olivia Harewood '09) plays a
lesbian who looks for love, well,
everywhere. Her vocals are amazing
and she provides a dose of entertain
ment to the otherwise slower paced
first half of the play.

As with Madeleine True,
he dancer, Jackie (Wade Ray
'08), seems to be inconse
quential in the play, but his
lone dance scene is beautiful
ly done, however confusing a
viewer might find it. The
other main character.
Black, (Willi Farrales '08),
while interesting, never
moves beyond the one-di- .
mensional status of Quee
nie's knight in shining
armor.

His development could
have been stronger, especially since
his role requires that he ,act within
the main foursome of the otherwise
very strong characters, Kate, Burrs
and Queenie.
Despite some minor glitches, The
Wild Party is an excellent and enter
taining show, that still manages to
keep it classy. It is playing on tonight
and tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium and tickets are $9 for stu
dents, $15 for faculty/staff and $18
general admission.
