# Oh yes! Erotic Places on Campus

### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION THERMOMETER 
Hoover Tower Hoover tower was raised in 1941 and con
sists of a rigid steel frame that thrusts 285 feet skyward.
The visitors' elevator navigates up its shaft in a mere 30
seconds, although some guests have complained that this
rousing ascension sends blood rushing to their heads. In
order to create an erection of this magnitude, engineers
had to work long and hard. Really hard. Unbelievably
hard. Oh yeah, and some people say it looks like a penis.
What they don't know: If you stand behind a tree and
squint a little bit, Old Hoov has pubes too!

"Large Torso: Arch" statue: This large bronze arch in front of the
Cummings Art Building has the right idea about female nudes: Skip
the boring limbs and faces and cut right to the good stuff! In this
case, a hugely magnified outline of a human torso, with the am
biguous suggestion of hipbones and the soft curve of a colossal
breast. If you're feeling particularly Freudian, you can crawl inside
the giant torso and symbolically reenter the womb — but as a fair
warning, doing so would probably ratchet up the statue's effect
from "strangely arousing" to "overwhelmingly creepy."

(Jay Liberation statue: The Gay Liberation statue near the
math corner outside the main Quad caused a huge scandal
when it was installed in 198(J — and if there's anything hotter
than progressive liberal politics, it's taboo art. Not only that, but
the two couples depicted in the arrangement are pretty hot in
and of themselves. The most erotic aspect of the sculpture is its
humanity: two loving couples caught in casual moments of af
fection. Plus: lesbian thigh-groping action!

Cactus garden: Why is the Arizona Cactus Garden like
Kappa Sig's fraternity house? If you walk in, you might
feel a small prick. Zing! Seriously, though, the garden,
which was planted in the 188()s, is the second most phal
locentric location on campus, right after the Papua New
Guinea totem pole garden near Roble. The rock beds are
brimming with various species of spiny succulents and
sensual desert blossoms, proving that, if you're in the
market for recreation, you should look to nature for in
spiration.

No doubt about it — Stanford is hot. The gym is crammed to bursting with Olympic-quality athletes; starting in mid-February,
every lawn is crowded with co-eds canoodling in bikinis; and wo even have the occasional sexy tenured professor (hello, French
Lit Department!). It's only fitting, then, that the very architecture of our beloved University reflects the slightly over-intellectu
al sexiness that so draws us to our peers. After taking a tour of the strangely arousing (mostly) inanimate sites on campus, you
may need a cold shower or a few inches of Chaucer to sooth your erotic agitation.

Nymph tree: While not widely hailed
as one of Stanford's must-see attrac
tions, this shapely tree on the out
skirts of the Slav Dom parking lot is
perhaps the single most strangely
arousing sight on campus. On the
one hand, those lithe legs, that taut,
nymphly posterior, those curled toes
melding into translucent leaves —
what beauty, what rapture! On the
other hand, she is, in fact, a tree..

Angel of Grief: This statue, near the Stanfords' Mau- \
solemn, was originally built as a tribute to Jane Stan- 1
ford's brother, Henry Clay Lathrop. He must have been
a lucky man. From the delicately sweeping tendrils of
her sculpted hair to the tender curve of a slim shoulder,
the larger-than-life-size angel is a perfect embodiment
of elegiac elegance — even her toes are poignant. Espe
cially when reflecting the soft light of a full moon, the
sculpture proves that the only thing more erotic than a
grieving woman is a grieving woman with wings.

Martyr Although tourists rarely get beyond the stoic,
robed "Burghers of Calais" sculptures in Memorial
Court, the University's primo Rodin sculptures are
all in the Rodin sculpture garden outside of the Can
tor Arts Center. One of the garden's focal pieces is
"Martyr," a sculpture of a supine, shockingly emaci
ated woman. Judging by her tragically sprawling de
meanor and nudity, either she has just been killed or
she passed out on her way home from Exotic Erotic.

Sieve of Eratosthenes: "Sieve of Eratos
thenes"? More like Sieve of Erotic
ihenes! Hoo-ah! This giant stainless
steel sculpture behind the Cantor Arts
Center looks like a techie Rorschach of
two randy robots swapping hydraulic
fluids. Show a picture of this bad boy to
your Roomba and he'll be spinning
around for weeks. Although ihe name of
this piece rather tamely refers to a math
ematical method of determining prime
numbers, one look at the statue is more
than enough to make one want to plug a
number into a hot equation.
