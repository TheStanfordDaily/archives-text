matchups against defending Pac-10
Champion UCLA and Washing
ton. Head coach John Rittman rec
ognizes his team's strong play at
home.
"It feels good to be at home and
to fill our home field." Rittman
said. "We're definitely looking for
ward to playing this weekend. We
know that we're playing tough, very
good opponents in UCLA and
Washington, and we're going to
have to make some adjustments
and bring our TV-game this week
end."

GAME NOTES: This weekend will mark the
Cardinal's first complete Pac-10 series at
home this season. Stanford has had mixed
results in the Pac-10, compiling a 3-6
record in arguably the nation's toughest
conference.

Sophomore ace Missy Penna has earned a team-leading
1.96 ERA to go along with a 20-5 record in an up-and
down season for the Cardinal.
that. Stanford conceded its regular
season series to archrival California.
"We've had a tough stretch of
games this first part of the Pac-10
season, having played eight of our
first nine on the road." Rittman said.
"This conference is not easy, and
you're going to have some ups and
downs and bumps in the road."
However, home-field advantage
will not guarantee a win against the
Bruins or the Huskies. UCLA (28-
11. 4-4 Pac-10) provides a balanced
attack of strong hitting and potent
pitching. Its offense is powered by
lunior Krista Colburn.who is batting
.415 on the year with 54 hits. Fellow
junior Anjelica Selden anchors the
pitching staff with 15 wins and a 2.40
PR A. while limiting her opponents
to a .190 average.

The Huskies (27-11. 4-4 Pac-10)
and UCLA have almost identical
records. ITic Washington lineup has
five starters batting over .300, no
tably senior Dena Tyson with 12
homers and 37 RBI and junior Ash
ley Charters with 50 hits. Their two
main pitchers, sophomore Danielle
Lawrie and junior Caitlin Noble,
have sub-2.00 ERAs: 1.60 and 1.90.
respectively.
Currently, the opposition isn't ex
actly killing the Cardinal. Rather, it
has lately been a self-destruction
through errors and allowing extra
outs.
"First of all. we need to be able to
pitch well and play defense,"
Rittnian said. "We have to stay in
games, meaning we don't give away
outs and don't make mistakes. We
have to play consistent softball
against good competition."
Fortunately, the Card isn't with
out its own arsenal of players and
pitchers. Stanford's potent offense,
which has outscored opponents 183-

104 on the year, is currently led by a
streaking Alissa Haber. Hie fresh
man is wielding a hot bat with an
eight-game hit streak and a .591 av
erage in April. She is also leading the
team in doubles with 11.
"Alissa is having a good approach
to the plate," Rittman said. "She's a
very capable hitter, and she's hitting
some tough pitches as well. That's
nice to see, especially from a fresh
man."
Stanford also found itself with an
other potent bat when sophomore
Maddy Coon returned to the lineup
and notched her first hit since March
last Friday. Coon, one of the team's
power hitters, suffered a hand injury
that left her out of the lineup for a
month. However, Rittman is glad to
see Coon back in the game.
"Maddy is definitely a presence in
our lineup," he said. "Opposing
pitchers definitely have to be con
cerned with her power and ability to
hit for average in our lineup. It's very
important for the strength of our

team to have her hack."
The Cardinal's pitching staff is led
by sophomore Missy Penna. Penna is
currently 20-5 with a 1.% ERA and
214 strikeouts. Last week. Penna also
pitched her second career no-hitter
in a midweek matchup against Saint
Mary's. However, the desert was not
as friendly to Penna as she dropped
two decisions and almost doubled
her season loss total.
Still. Rittman stands by his ace.
"We know that Missy's going to
go out there and battle hard,"
Rittman said. "We're just looking for
Missy to continue to improve, work
hard and be consistent. When she's
done that in the past, she has had
very much success."
The Cardinal is now at a crucial
point in its season, when wins can be
come an odd commodity. If anything,
this homestand will definitely impact
how Stanford finishes the vear.

to a .190 average.

The Huskies (27-11. 4-4 Pac-10)
and UCLA have almost identical
records. ITic Washington lineup has
five starters batting over .300, no
tably senior Dena Tyson with 12
homers and 37 RBI and junior Ash
ley Charters with 50 hits. Their two
main pitchers, sophomore Danielle
Lawrie and junior Caitlin Noble,
have sub-2.00 ERAs: 1.60 and 1.90.
respectively.
Currently, the opposition isn't ex
actly killing the Cardinal. Rather, it
has lately been a self-destruction
through errors and allowing extra
outs.
"First of all. we need to be able to
pitch well and play defense,"
Rittnian said. "We have to stay in
games, meaning we don't give away
outs and don't make mistakes. We
have to play consistent softball
against good competition."
Fortunately, the Card isn't with
out its own arsenal of players and
pitchers. Stanford's potent offense,
which has outscored opponents 183-

104 on the year, is currently led by a
streaking Alissa Haber. Hie fresh
man is wielding a hot bat with an
eight-game hit streak and a .591 av
erage in April. She is also leading the
team in doubles with 11.
"Alissa is having a good approach
to the plate," Rittman said. "She's a
very capable hitter, and she's hitting
some tough pitches as well. That's
nice to see, especially from a fresh
man."
Stanford also found itself with an
other potent bat when sophomore
Maddy Coon returned to the lineup
and notched her first hit since March
last Friday. Coon, one of the team's
power hitters, suffered a hand injury
that left her out of the lineup for a
month. However, Rittman is glad to
see Coon back in the game.
"Maddy is definitely a presence in
our lineup," he said. "Opposing
pitchers definitely have to be con
cerned with her power and ability to
hit for average in our lineup. It's very
important for the strength of our

team to have her hack."
The Cardinal's pitching staff is led
by sophomore Missy Penna. Penna is
currently 20-5 with a 1.% ERA and
214 strikeouts. Last week. Penna also
pitched her second career no-hitter
in a midweek matchup against Saint
Mary's. However, the desert was not
as friendly to Penna as she dropped
two decisions and almost doubled
her season loss total.
Still. Rittman stands by his ace.
"We know that Missy's going to
go out there and battle hard,"
Rittman said. "We're just looking for
Missy to continue to improve, work
hard and be consistent. When she's
done that in the past, she has had
very much success."
The Cardinal is now at a crucial
point in its season, when wins can be
come an odd commodity. If anything,
this homestand will definitely impact
how Stanford finishes the vear.
