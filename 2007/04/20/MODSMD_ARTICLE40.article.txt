Eating at Stanford: Because gaining those
freshman 15 should be delicious
Stanford has an array of places to eat outside
of the dining halls. 1 lere is a carefully selected
list with a few of the more well-known options
that will likely satisfy any Pro Fro craving
without involving a police search.
(Hives
Olives, a Mediterranean-thcmed eatery in the
basement of Building 160. has a nice range of
options. From gyros and souvlakis to
Mediterranean-styled burgers and pizza,
Olives is a safe choice for lunch. For the early
birds, Olives sells fruit cups and orange juice
that are bound to satisfy a morning craving.
Most dishes come with a choice of olive rice or
couscous; rice is the more savory of the two.
For the student on the run. Olives carries
ready-made sandwiches and salads. Prices
vary, and pizza is the least expensive meal
item.
The Alumni Cafe
Located at the Arriilaga Alumni Building —
where Admit Weekend check-in took place
— this eatery is among the best on campus.
The Cafe specializes in a variety of hot subs,
but also carries chicken and other assorted
daily specials. Items on the menu that every
Cardinal should try include the Santa Cruz
sub. which has chicken and avocado. The
Cafe's on-the-go menu includes refrigerated
sandwiches, sushi and assorted salads. A re
laxed ambience is what sets this eatery apart
j from others on campus, thanks to the Arrilla-

Sprouts
Although some of Tresiddcr's eating choices
leave much to desire. Sprouts churns out sal-

ads that will satisfy even the most vo
racious individual. Sprouts'

menu rotates, offering three

daily choices. The South
western Chicken salad

is a customer favorite
that can be tried any
day of the week —

the only constai
item on the
menu.
Sprouts' in
gredients
are fresh,
and the

dressings shy away from regular offerings.
I'm still not sure what that green dressing
on the Southwestern Chicken salad is. but
I don't mind it a bit. For vegetarians.
Sprouts is a great alternative. Simply ask
for no chicken, and you're set. The salads
are big, so for most people, sharing a salad
is not a bad idea.
Subway
Although Subway at Tresidder isn't exact
ly a culinary delight, it does have the best
hours on campus. Subway prides itself
with being one of the few campus eateries
that is open seven days a week and until 8
p.m. on weekdays. Most people are al
ready familiar with Subway's menu, which
does away with some of the guesswork in
volved with ordering a meal.
The Treehouse
One of Stanford's independently owned
restaurants. The
Tree-

house, serves up some very au
thentic Mexican food. The restaurant's
menu includes burritos, tostadas, quesadillas.

tacos and. oddly enough, teriyaki bowls,
among other offerings. The prices for dishes
are fairly inexpensive, while serving portions
arc fairly big. Burritos, for example, can serve
two people. The Treehouse also offers a range
of angus-beef burgers, the best on campus.
Items are cooked to order. A courteous staff
and a welcoming quasi-sports bar theme
make the customer experience enjoyable.
The Thai Cafe
Blink and you'll miss the Thai Cafe, located in
the basement of Jordan Hall. With only a
counter and a few refrigerators full of bever
ages, the Thai Cafe offers a rolling menu.
Most items — if not all — cost five dollars,
but don't let the prices be indicative of the
food's quality. This inexpensive lunch option
draws crowds everyday for both the price and
the delicious food. It's not gourmet, but it's
not sloppy Stanford Dining stir-fry cither. The
Thai Cafe also has the cheapest soft drinks on
campus. Have cash on hand, as it is the only
form of payment accepted. Best of all, be pre
pared for a quick service, one of the Thai
Cafe's assets.
The CoHo

One word: crepes. The CoHo, or Coffee
House for all you profros, makes a

wide variety of crepes. From Nutella
and strawberry to chicken, cheese
and pesto, everyone's bound to find
a delicious crepe. The CoHo also

offers a daily baked-potato bar for
all you potato lovers, as well as salads

and sandwiches. If in the mood for a
snack, the CoHo also carried an assortment of
baked goodies that will go well with that
caramel machiatto. ii
