# So it's your first time at Stanford? Hero's where to go. young Profor

### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION PROFRO 
If you're a Pro Fro and already
want to chuck your snazzy red fold
er into a fountain and laugh in the
face of planned activities, this list is
for you. For a taste of the "real"
Stanford experience, meander
around campus and check out some
of these spots. Have coffee with a
new friend at Moonßean's or write
a postcard to your mom while sit
ting in the Quad. And if you don't
have time to do any of these things,
at least be aware of what you have
to look forward to. Oh, and you
non-ProFros can probably benefit
from visiting these great locations,
too (if you haven't already).

The Dish. Although it doesn't
provide satellite TV. the Dish and its
surrounding area is a great place to
take a hike on a pleasant afternoon.
For a second, you might even forget
you're still in the Stanford Bubble.
Moonßean's. Disregarding the
fact that it's sandwiched between-
Green and Meyer Libraries, fre
quenting Moonßean's is a fun way
to pretend you're at an actual, cute
'n' trendy cafe. (They take real
money and everything!)
Fountain in front of the Stanford
i Hospital. Hanging out around a hos
pital may not be your idea of fun.
, Understandable. But weird location
aside, this sizable fountain deserves

a visit if only to catch the humorous
mating antics of its resident mallard
ducks. Fun, indeed.
The planters around the Quad.
One of the most accessible and stun
ningly beautiful places to sit on cam
pus. Recline and stare off into some
foliage until a tourist interrupts to
ask you if he can take a picture with
a real, live Stanford student.
The benches around the Claw. It
is almost impossible to sit within
these four concrete parentheses and
get work done. Between the baby-
Gap model inches away from falling
into the fountain and the unleashed
doggy parading about, you will be
distracted. And that's a good thing.

The Arizona Cactus Garden. No
need to get on a plane for this. If
you're willing to trek out to the Mau
soleum and navigate from there, you
will stumble across an unexpected
garden of 500 cacti and succulents.
Just remember to keep your hands
to yourselves, kids.
Amy Blue Garden. In between the
two Serra Complex buildings hides a
little slice of paradise. The garden,
which is reportedly Monet-inspired,
features a footbridge, pond and
charming foliage. It may not live up to
the French countryside, but there are
some rocking benches. Literally rock
ing. As in. they rock, back and forth.
Stanford Bookstore. If you can't

get off campus and really want to
catch up on the latest issue of The
Economist or Vogue, the Bookstore
is the way to go. If you feel ridiculous
sitting in the little kiddy seats by the
magazine section, check out the
ample seating in the back. The spots
by the walls of windows are perfect
for people watching. Until you real
ize how creepy it is that someone
could potentially be viewing as you
scamper from Meyer to White
Plaza.
Storke Publication Building.
Come keep the Daily staffers com
pany. We have cable. Be sure to visit
the Intermission office. It's the most
fun you'll ever have in a windowless
room.
