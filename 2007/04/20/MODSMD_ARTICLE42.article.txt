### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION PIZZA EXPERT 
Patxi's Chicago Pizza, on Emer
son Street in downtown Palo Alto,
offers a unique style of pizza that is
not quite the traditional "Chicago"
pizza yet not quite the average pizza
you would get from Pizza My Heart
or Round Table. Overall, my expe
rience at Patxi's had its ups and
downs.
Let's start with the "bad" and get
ii over with: First of all. the menu in
cluded only a few salads (garden.
Caesar, spinach and Greek) and. of
course, pizza; there were no pastas
or even desserts. However, I would
suspect that many people do not go
to a pizza parlor expecting to eat

much else.
In addition, as warned on the
menu, the deep-dish Chicago style
pizzas took about 30 to 40 minutes
each to cook (and the thin-crust piz
zas about 20 to 30 minutes); regard
less of the crust you want, if you are
hungry, 1 would suggest getting
there early enough to brace yourself
for the wait.
The biggest disappointment,
though, was probably the cost of the
pizza. A 10-inch pizza (for two peo
ple) cost about $ i 7, a hefty price for
pizza. But I will admit that the pleas
ing presentation of the pizzas and
their distinctive crust made Patxi's
pizzas more special than your typi
cal large pizza from Domino's for
$y.99.
Now for the really good stuff
about Patxi's. The pizza was not
only great to look at bul also great to
taste. The Chicago-style pizza
(which, for those of you who have
never had it, is a thick-crusted pizza
with marinara sauce poured on top
of the cheese) came out fresh and
hot: the inversion of the sauce and
cheese certainly made for a pretty
pizza.

Our table got one pepperoni,
one sausage and one mushroom,
onion and bell pepper pizza on
whole-wheat crust (an attempt to
make a healthy pizza), but you can
make any type of pizza you want
with any type of crust and any
number of toppings you so desire.
A 10-inch Chicago-style pizza for
two or a 14-inch for three is plen
ty, as the thick crust makes the
pizza more filling than you would
expect.
In regard to the taste of the pizza,
the sauce was delicious and of the
perfect consistency. The cheese was
a little much for me but would have
put a cheese-lover in paradise.
The crust, though, was my fa
vorite part — the whole-wheat

crust (despite sounding like one of
those things that's healthy but
probably tastes horrible) was espe
cially amazing. Although it's silly
to say that food can make you
happy, the golden, perfectly
cooked, thick crust really made me
(or at least my stomach) quite
pleased.
The service and atmosphere
were also pretty decent. Although
the hostess was a little too hyper (if
you could call him that) for my
friends and me, the overall friendli
ness of the service was great, and
our waiter was always there when
we needed refills.
The restaurant itself had a very
modern, casual decor. With black
and white paintings on the wall, an
open kitchen and shiny wooden ta
bles and scats. Paxti's is a fun place
to go with friends but probably not
the best date atmosphere.
One last warning: If you plan to
go on the weekend, I would suggest
going before 7 p.m., as there tends
to be a long wait for a table later in
the night (not to mention the addi
tional cooking-time wait already
noted above).
