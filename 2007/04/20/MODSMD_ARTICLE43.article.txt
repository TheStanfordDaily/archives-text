## College: Honestly, it's about the sex 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
ProFros: This is the begin
ning of your real Stanford edu
cation.
When Roxy first came to (or
should she say, "at"?) Stanford,
she was pleasantly surprised.
Very pleasantly. She kids you
not — they were all almost a
foot long! And she got to have
a different one every weekend.
She could go through them
quickly or cozy up to them and
spend a lot of time examining
them. If she got really desper
ate, extras were available on
line. What more could a girl ask
for in eojlege?
Roxy is, of course, talking
about sex columns. Virtually
. unknown in high schools na
tionwide, the sex column is a
standby in many college news
papers. No columnist is so ac
claimed, of course, as yours
truly. Here this. Class of O-
Leven. Roxy writes a weekly
sex column that you'll get to
enjoy every Friday at Stanford
next year. And while Roxy is
quite famous for her writing
ability alone, she has plenty of
other talents to share with you.
Mmm, they didn't tell you that
at Harvard, did they?
Roxy listened to her guid
ance counselor's advice and
didn't let her potential go to
waste in college. And she can
help you do the same during
your time at Stanford. College
is undoubtedly the best time to
have sex. Lots of it. Preferably
with multiple partners. Live it
up, because after college it's
called prostitution.
But seriously. Sex in college
has several advantages over sex
at other times in your life. Stan
ford University will hold your

hand through lots of the new
experiences you'll have in col
lege. Well, Roxy's leading you
by a different appendage.

Roxy is, of course, talking
about sex columns. Virtually
. unknown in high schools na
tionwide, the sex column is a
standby in many college news
papers. No columnist is so ac
claimed, of course, as yours
truly. Here this. Class of O-
Leven. Roxy writes a weekly
sex column that you'll get to
enjoy every Friday at Stanford
next year. And while Roxy is
quite famous for her writing
ability alone, she has plenty of
other talents to share with you.
Mmm, they didn't tell you that
at Harvard, did they?
Roxy listened to her guid
ance counselor's advice and
didn't let her potential go to
waste in college. And she can
help you do the same during
your time at Stanford. College
is undoubtedly the best time to
have sex. Lots of it. Preferably
with multiple partners. Live it
up, because after college it's
called prostitution.
But seriously. Sex in college
has several advantages over sex
at other times in your life. Stan
ford University will hold your

hand through lots of the new
experiences you'll have in col
lege. Well, Roxy's leading you
by a different appendage.

ProFros: This is the begin
ning of your real Stanford edu
cation.
When Roxy first came to (or
should she say, "at"?) Stanford,
she was pleasantly surprised.
Very pleasantly. She kids you
not — they were all almost a
foot long! And she got to have
a different one every weekend.
She could go through them
quickly or cozy up to them and
spend a lot of time examining
them. If she got really desper
ate, extras were available on
line. What more could a girl ask
for in eojlege?
