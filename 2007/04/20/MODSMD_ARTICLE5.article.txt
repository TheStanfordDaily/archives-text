# Hope for the Hokies
## 
### 
The last two weeks have been
rough on the world of sports.
Meat-headed Don Imus. think
ing he was being clever and funny,
showed us that race and racism is still
a paramount issue in today's America
with his description of the Rutgers
women's basketball team as "nappy
headed hos."
Then, NBA superstar and sup
posed role model Tim Duncan was
challenged to a fight by veteran refer
ee Joey Crawford. The scene had its
comic elements to it. but it was still
fairly disgusting with the raw angst
and hate between the old Crawford
and the robust Duncan.
In a time when nuclear weapons
programs abound, people are killed
over the outcomes of Little League
games and enormously wealthy NBA
players' demand salary hikes citing
the "need to feed their family," you
sometimes have to wonder where our
neurotic society is going.
And then Virginia Tech happened.
Virginia Tech.
The I iokies have been a mainstay
of college athletics for years. Head
football coach Frank Beamer built
his program based on hard work and
excellent special teams play.
By the time a kid named Michael
Vick stepped onto the Blacksburg
campus in the fall of 1998, Beamer's
program had reached the status of
national power.
Since then, Virginia Tech has al
ways been a mainstay of college foot
ball, competing in the national cham
pionship and appearing at numerous
New Year's Day bowl games.
Under Setli Greenberg, Tech's
basketball program has also risen,
beating both Duke and North Caroli
na this year in ACC play and making
the NCAA Tournament as a five
seed.
It has never been hard to root for
the I lokies; they have up-and-coming
programs. And after all. who can re
sist rooting for a I lokie?
Part of the allure in rooting for the
Hokies was that you often didn't
know what a Hokie was. For the
record, I lokie is a fictional mascot
masquerading itself as a maroon bird.
But there's even more reason to
root for the I iokies now.
We all know about the tragedy
that took place this Monday. I can't
imagine what it's like to be a student
at Virginia Tech right now, to know
someone who was shot or injured, to
be around the university or to even
be an alumnus. The inexplicable
tragedy has moved our nation,
brought people together, but most of
all. its left us asking: Why?
There isn't an answer, though.
Hint's the hardest part.
