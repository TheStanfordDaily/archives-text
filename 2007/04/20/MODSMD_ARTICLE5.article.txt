# Hope for the Hokies
## 
### 
The last two weeks have been
rough on the world of sports.
Meat-headed Don Imus. think
ing he was being clever and funny,
showed us that race and racism is still
a paramount issue in today's America
with his description of the Rutgers
women's basketball team as "nappy
headed hos."
Then, NBA superstar and sup
posed role model Tim Duncan was
challenged to a fight by veteran refer
ee Joey Crawford. The scene had its
comic elements to it. but it was still
fairly disgusting with the raw angst
and hate between the old Crawford
and the robust Duncan.
In a time when nuclear weapons
programs abound, people are killed
over the outcomes of Little League
games and enormously wealthy NBA
players' demand salary hikes citing
the "need to feed their family," you
sometimes have to wonder where our
neurotic society is going.
And then Virginia Tech happened.
Virginia Tech.
The I iokies have been a mainstay
of college athletics for years. Head
football coach Frank Beamer built
his program based on hard work and
excellent special teams play.
By the time a kid named Michael
Vick stepped onto the Blacksburg
campus in the fall of 1998, Beamer's
program had reached the status of
national power.
Since then, Virginia Tech has al
ways been a mainstay of college foot
ball, competing in the national cham
pionship and appearing at numerous
New Year's Day bowl games.
Under Setli Greenberg, Tech's
basketball program has also risen,
beating both Duke and North Caroli
na this year in ACC play and making
the NCAA Tournament as a five
seed.
It has never been hard to root for
the I lokies; they have up-and-coming
programs. And after all. who can re
sist rooting for a I lokie?
Part of the allure in rooting for the
Hokies was that you often didn't
know what a Hokie was. For the
record, I lokie is a fictional mascot
masquerading itself as a maroon bird.
But there's even more reason to
root for the I iokies now.
We all know about the tragedy
that took place this Monday. I can't
imagine what it's like to be a student
at Virginia Tech right now, to know
someone who was shot or injured, to
be around the university or to even
be an alumnus. The inexplicable
tragedy has moved our nation,
brought people together, but most of
all. its left us asking: Why?
There isn't an answer, though.
Hint's the hardest part.

Above the Rim
It's times like these when sports
are therapeutic, taking people away
from the harsh reality of the world
we live in. A touchdown, last-second
shot or an interception can make
people forget, for just a moment,
what has happened.
What I'm saying is: Sports can he
trivial, hut for the most part, they're
not.
A 45-yard touchdown run or a 50-
yard field goal? Sure, they're pretty
meaningless in the long run, but
when you realize w ho they're affect
ing and how they're affecting them,
they suddenly take on a whole new
meaning.
After the city of New Orleans ex
perienced the devastating disaster of
Hurricane Katrina, it rallied around
the hometown Saints. The Saints re
ceived coverage around the country
for their heart-warming story; anil
unlike a lot of things dramatized in
sports, the Saints' story was truly

heartwarming.
Drew Brees. Reggie Bush and
Marques Colston rejuvenated a city,
a region and a country by bringing
the Saints to the doorstep of the
Super Bowl.They understood the re
sponsibility on their shoulders and
acted accordingly, being active in
their communities and setting new
standards for what it meant to be role
models.
And in the process, they showed
that sports aren't just sports. Sports
bring people together. They may not
seem to have that same effect in a
place like California, but trust me: If
you go to Tuscaloosa, Chapel Hill, or
even Blacksburg, sports are a huge
thing.They're more than just a game.
I'll be rootirg for the Hokies
every chance I get next year. 1 can
only hope that the city of Blacksburg,
the state of Virginia and the whole
country will rally around Virginia
Tech and its athletic program in mov
ing on from this senseless tragedy.
It was hard to not root for the
Hokies before. Now? It's impossible.
