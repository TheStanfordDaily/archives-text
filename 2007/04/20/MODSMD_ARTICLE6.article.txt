# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card crosses Bay to top 20 wins 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
ITie last time a Stanford women's water
polo team won 20 games in a row, more
than half of the members of this year's
team hadn't even entered high school yet.
Hie Cardinal achieved the feat in 2(H) 1.
six years ago, when the squad reeled off 27
consecutive games before falling to UCLA

in the NCAA championship match.
This year's team gets its shot at 20
straight tonight, and it's only fitting that the
top-ranked Cardinal (21-1, 10-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) should be facing
cross-Bay rival and No. 6-ranked Califor
nia (10-9,6-5) for the occasion.
ITie Stanford women's lone loss came
on Feb. 3 against powerful Southern Cali
fornia, but since then the Cardinal has been

unstoppable. Last weekend, the team ral
lied to extend its winning streak by knock
ing off No. 2 UCLA at home in an overtime
thriller, 7-6. It was just the second time this
season that the Bruins have lost, but both
of those losses came at the hands of the
Cardinal.
Stanford largely had senior two-meter

Christina Hewko to thank for the
outcome, as the two-time All-Amer
ican rose to the occasion by provid
ing a hat-trick as well as strong play
in the defensive end. Hewko con
cluded her big weekend a day later
with a four-goal effort against visit
ing IJC-Santa Barbara, propelling
the Cardinal to a 12-5 victory.
On Tuesday, the Newport Beach,
Calif-native was named MPSF
Mikasa Player of the Week for her
performance, making her the third
member of the Cardinal squad to
garner the award this year (seniors
Katie Hansen and Meridith McColl
were also recognized earlier in the
season). Not surprisingly, though.
Hewko maintained a modest per
spective in evaluating her role in
the Cardinal's victory over the Bru
ins.
"I just sort of happened to be in
the right positions, and it happened

to be my shots that went in,l she said.
"It was a big game, and definitely fun.
I'm totally stoked about it. but it was
a great game all around for our
whole team."
One of the team's most notable
accomplishments in the game was its
ability to prevent the Bruins from
scoring on the six-on-five advantage.
Anchored by McColl's solid play in
goal, the smothering Stanford de
fense successfully killed all six
UCLA power plays in the game, sev
eral of which came in the final period
of play.
But the Bruins were equally ef
fective in countering the Stanford
man-up advantage, as the Cardinal
went 0-5 in its power-play opportuni
ties.
"It's something we get excited
about because we see it as a great op
portunity to demoralize 11he other
team]," I lewko said of the Cardinal's

defense against the six-on-five. "It
was definitely something we were fo
cusing on heading into [our game
against UCLA). But we also weren't
very successful in [our six-on-five ad
vantages], so that's an area we can
improve upon."
But that storyline likely won't
matter much this evening,as the Car
dinal looks to claim its seventh con
secutive Big Splash victory over the
Bears. Following the game, the team
will return home to Stanford in
preparation for its regular-season fi
nale against San Jose State, Saturday
afternoon at 1 p.m. at the Avery
Aquatic Center. Prior to the start of
the final home game of their careers,
I lansen. I fewko. McColl and co-cap
tain Alison Gregorka will be hon
ored as part of Senior Day.
