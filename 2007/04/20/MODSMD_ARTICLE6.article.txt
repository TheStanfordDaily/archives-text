# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card crosses Bay to top 20 wins 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
ITie last time a Stanford women's water
polo team won 20 games in a row, more
than half of the members of this year's
team hadn't even entered high school yet.
Hie Cardinal achieved the feat in 2(H) 1.
six years ago, when the squad reeled off 27
consecutive games before falling to UCLA

in the NCAA championship match.
This year's team gets its shot at 20
straight tonight, and it's only fitting that the
top-ranked Cardinal (21-1, 10-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) should be facing
cross-Bay rival and No. 6-ranked Califor
nia (10-9,6-5) for the occasion.
ITie Stanford women's lone loss came
on Feb. 3 against powerful Southern Cali
fornia, but since then the Cardinal has been

unstoppable. Last weekend, the team ral
lied to extend its winning streak by knock
ing off No. 2 UCLA at home in an overtime
thriller, 7-6. It was just the second time this
season that the Bruins have lost, but both
of those losses came at the hands of the
Cardinal.
Stanford largely had senior two-meter
