## The
						journeys of the brainwashing parasite 
### 
It plays out like your worst night
mare. You're faced with the
fiercest, toothiest, scariest preda
tor imaginable. All this monster
wants to do is eat you up. And yet —
you can't turn away. You find your
self inexplicably drawn to this mon
ster, and you go closer, and closer...
Such is the situation with rats in
fected with a bizarre parasite. Toxo
plasma gondii (or "toxo," as it's
cheekily called) is a protozoan fa
mously found in cat poop. The para
site is dangerous to pregnant
women, but, in most humans, it
seems to cause no more than flu-like
symptoms. But for rats, it's a differ
ent story: the parasite can actually
send them to their deaths.
Toxo can only reproduce sexually
in cat intestines. (Sexy place, no?)
But the parasite can live in almost
any warm-blooded host, including
the rat. The shortest distance from a
rat to a cat is through the cat's
mouth. The problem, for the para
site, is that rats are terrified of cats —
even a whiff of cat urine is enough to
send them squeaking for cover.
But all that changes once a rat
catches toxo. Amazingly, a toxo-in
fected rat is actually attracted to cat
urine.
The Sapolsky lab at Stanford re
cently studied this phenomenon.
They found some toxo, they got
some rats and they bought some
bobcat urine. (Who knew that was
commercially available?)The Sapol
sky lab found that toxo-infected rats
have damaging cysts on their amyg
dalas. the part of the brain involved
in fear and anxiety.This would make
sense — knock out the fear, and the
rats won't run from cats.
So, are the amygdala-damaged
rats completely fearless? Actually,
no. It turns out the effect of toxo is
astonishingly specific. The rats are
still afraid of doggy smells; they are
afraid of open spaces; they are leery
around unknown foods. But when it
comes to cat pee, they can't get
enough.
Weird as toxo is, it's not particu
larly unique. Parasitic brainwashing
happens all over the animal king
dom. The lancet fluke, Dicrocoelium
dendriticum, is a protist like toxo.
Unlike toxo, it's not content with

only two host animals. The lancet
fluke finds its way through three
species in its life cycle.
Adult lancet flukes hang out in
side cows. They mate in the cows
liver (another sexy place!) and send
eggs off into the animal's digestive
tract. An infected cow leaves fluke
laden cow pies in its wake.
Next in the lancet fluke's life
cycle are snails with the munchies.
Snails evidently snack on cow poo,
sometimes with a lancet fluke gar
nish. Once inside the snail, the para
sitic larvae attach themselves to the
snail's digestive tract and develop
into their juvenile state. The he
sieged snail immobilizes these in
vaders by wrapping them in slime.
Slime balls full of flukes are excreted
onto the grass, where they await
their next host.
The ant is the most pitiable crea
ture in the lancet fluke saga. To a
thirsty ant, the fluke-filled slime
balls are a source of moisture. The
ant slurps up the slimy flukes, oblivi
ously signing its death warrant. The
lancet flukes head straight for the
ant's brain.
From then on. the insect becomes
restless. Instead of bedding down
with its fellows at night, the ant heads
for the nearest blade of grass. The
erstwhile unadventurous insect
clambers to the tip of a blade of
grass, holds tight with its mandibles
and waves in the breeze until morn
ing. At dawn, it rejoins its nestmates
on the ground.
But all is not back to normal. The
very next night, the infected ant is
back on that grass. This goes on until
the blade of grass — along with the
hapless ant — gets eaten by a cow,
and the lancet fluke is back inside its
favorite animal.
Ibis is so science fiction-esque 1
can hardly believe it. But the mind
control doesn't end with parasites.
