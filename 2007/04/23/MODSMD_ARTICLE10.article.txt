# Mohsin Hamid
## Author of "The Reluctant Fundamentalist" speaks about novel and personal experiences 
### ANNA H.R. KHAN INTERMISSION INTERVIEWER 
Two weeks ago I sat down with
Mohsin Hamid, the unassuming and
fascinatingly articulate author of
"Moth smoke" and"The Reluctant
Fundamentalist, who was visiting
Stanford to speak to students. We
spoke of his novel, of Pakistan and of
the many issues of this current day
and age. The conversation moved
from a professional plane to one of
mutual understanding. Similar back
grounds brought forth issues that
were previously untouched for fear of
"not knowing enough."
"The Reluctant Fundamentalist"
is Mohsin Hamid's second novel.
Using the dramatic monologue form.
Hamid toys with problems of the cur
rent decade: nostalgia, terrorism, and
media induced misconception.
Through the pull between suspicion
and bias comes to surface the story of
Changez, a young man who ventures
forth from his homeland of Lahore,
Pakistan to study abroad at Prince
ton. Deeply talented, Changez lands a
job with Underwood Samson soon
after he graduates, but this perfect
lifestyle starts to slip away in light of
9/11. Not only do the attacks induce
change within the society, but they
also allow this change to creep into a
side love story. Full of rapid, often
startling conversation. Hamid forces
the reader to interact with the text.
The novel transcends borders, as it al
lows the reader to delve into issues
that survive past the last page. The
reader walks away with some form of
revelation, either of himself or of the
often blurry reality of today's world.
Anna khan: The book only follows
the voice of one character, Changez.
Was it easier for you to write the book
in monologue so that the American
voice did not have a chance to speak?
Mohsin Hamid: I wrote seven drafts of
this book— in a third person narra
tive, a first person narrative, an Amer
ican voice, a Pakistani voice and a
combination of both. The dramatic
monologue form that I finally decided

on allowed me to capture the way in
which the world sees itself today, in a
sense of mutual suspicion. It almost
mimics the global media where so
often you hear one side of the story.
My novel is written in a form that
takes the reverse side of the media: it
hands the content over to the 'reluc
tant fundamentalist." It is equally bi
ased. The reader has to realize, though,
that the novel is only a version of the
truth. Numerous hints are given
throughout the novel that Change?, is
not entirely a reliable character.
Ak: Your main character,Changez,is
Pakistani and went to Princeton just
like you did. I le also worked in New
York City for quite some time. Was
this in some way an autobiographical
novel?
MH: No. In me, there are both sides of
the conversations — the American
side and the Pakistani side.The novel
as a whole deals with an issue that is
important to me. 1 had much more of
an American experience than
Changez did: 1 spent half of my life in
the United States.
Ak: Quoting Changez, "Princeton
made everything possible for me. But
it did not. could not, make me forget
such things as how much 1 enjoy the
tea in this, the city of my birth..." Were
there times where you felt that you
had forgotten where you came from?
You went to the same school 1 did, the
Lahore American School, and 1 know
personally that it can be suffocating
when a school embraces a culture so
different from the one surrounding it.
Mil: Altogether, my parents have
thirteen siblings. That means 1 have
over two dozen cousins in Lahore,
who were within three or four years of
my age. A vast majority of my friends
and cousins didn't go to the Lahore
American School (LAS). 1 think 1 got
a much bigger slice of Lahore and so 1
didn't feel as suffocated. When I go
back to Lahore I don't go back to my
bubble of post-LAS. I go back to peo
ple who never thought of being any
where else but Lahore.

Ak: Quoting your novel. "You ap
pear distracted, sir; those pretty girls
from the National College of Arts
have clearly recaptured your atten
tion. Or are you watching that man.
the one with the beard far longer than
mine, who has stopped to stand beside
them? You think he will scold them
for the inappropriateness of their
dress — their T-shirts and jeans? I
suspect not: those girls seem comfort
able in this area and are likely to come
here often, while he looks out of
place."( Pg 22) Please comment on lib
eralism and its interaction with Pak
istan being an Islamic Republic?
MH: What we call Islam is the Islam
of the Saudi culture. If you go to a
Pakistani village, all the women work.
If they didn't, people would starve.
Pakistan is unlike Middle Eastern
Countries; it is predominantly an agri
cultural society In Pakistan, the gov
ernment can't really tell the people
what to do because it doesn't do much
for the people. In Saudi Arabia, the
government can because it owns all
the oil and generates most of the rev
enue for the country.
Pakistan is incredibly diverse, and
not many people understand that
when they have only one interpreta
tion of the country. The question of lib
eralism is not an easy one. What we
need to understand are the dimensions
of our diversity. If you turn on the tele
vision in Pakistan, there is QTV, Fash
ion TV. ITiere is an urban vs. rural di
vide. You see women in jeans and in
traditional dresses.There are many dif
ferences geographically in the five dif
ferent provinces. While being a strong
agricultural center, it also has big in
dustrial belts. Even in terms of occupa
tion. there has been diversity with the
Aryans first, and then followed by the
Mongols and the British. So if you ask
me to comment on the interaction, I
would have to say it's very complex.
AK:The novel has been released in a
decade of turmoil, not only in the
West but also in Pakistan. The chief
justice of the Supreme Court was
fired and there have been countless
threats from madrassas (religious
schools). Do you think this is the
brink of a revolution? Will fundamen
talists take over a nation that is unsta
ble in its governance? Is this novel as
much a social critique as was "Moth
Smoke," your first novel?
MH: 1 m not convinced that Pakistan
is teetering on the brink of a revolu
tion. Yes, there might be a restoration,
but that is very different from a revo
lution. 1 actually wrote in support of
the idea that President Pervez
Musharraf needs to step down. The
idea that one man can be chief of army
staff and the President is not a part of
the constitution, even though he may
have started out with liberal inclina-

I * ' - - - J
tionsThe idea of a revolution in Pak
istan today is new; it is just a part of
media frenzy. There is a conflict in the
world today — a political conflict that
is misunderstood in religious terms.
Religious terms are used to dress up a
political conflict. I think the idea of
Pakistan being at the brink is invented
to control Pakistan's pragmatists. not
Utopians. They just want to do things
the way they are doing things.
AK: The story of Erica was a very
prominent part of the novel and cer
tainly doesn't seem completely one
dimensional. What is the parallel of
Erica's story?
MH: All authors hope that no charac
ter of theirs is one-dimensional!
Erica's nostalgia in the novel is one of
the most important themes. What is
nostalgia? It is a longing for the past,
an innate part of the human condition.
Nostalgia is not as prevalent when we
are younger —we think we are far
ther from death and life seems to glow.
But in a rapidly moving world, nostal
gia becomes more tempting. Even in
politics. Bush speaks of the "axis of
evil" — that is a Second World War
concept. When the social welfare state
was established, it was a form of nos
talgia. In my view of the world, nostal
gia can be both a crippling feeling and
one that makes you stronger. Erica's
affliction makes evident nostalgia's
multi-dimensional presence.
AK:The whole concept of the novel is
based on a conversation between two
men. Is it really believable that
Changez can tell so much to another,
a man he does not even know?
MH: The dramatic monologue has a
fantastical element. It is a form that is
playful. It allows you to bend reality in
a way that tempts the reader with sus
picion and disbelief. Can a conversa
tion like this really happen? Of course
not.
AK: Why did you write this book?
MH: 1 wanted to figure some things
out. I am in love with America and
deeply angry with it. sort of like
Changez. He is always aware of cer
tain benefits that America hands over
to him. benefits that are part of the
American corporate culture. At the
same time the culture doesn't work
for him. 1 le becomes at once ashamed
and proud of his background. It is a
strange dichotomy. The novel impli
cates the audience; it holds up a mir

ror to what they are. In that process,
the author establishes a conversation
with the audience.
AK: The title of the novel, "The Re
luctant Fundamentalist," is important
to the overall meaning. For me the
feeling of reluctance was less of an un
certainty than fundamentalism was.
for the character of Changez.
Mil: Cli angez. in some ways, does act
like a reluctant fundamentalist. He
doesn't want to leave America but has
to. It is that reluctance which is funda
mental and most direct. He works in a
company that values other compa
nies. He doesn't believe that society
should be governed with valuing eco
nomic fundamentals. It almost be
comes an ethical issue. As he becomes
more resistant to that, he becomes
more and more reluctant.
AK: The ending was probably the
most startling and frightful part of the
novel. Hie reader expects something
terrible to happen hut is not given a de
finitive ending. The lack of a concrete
ending leaves the reader hanging. Did
you intend for il to be that way?
MH:The end product is exactly what
I intended it to be. If an artist creates a
painting, it is everything he/she in
tends it to be. Usually readers are
hunting for answers and books can't
really give you the answer — the no
tion of the answer is actually wrong,
there is a multiplicity of answers
through which you become aware of
your own biases. The audience be
comes frightful of shadows. If an au
thor shows even the slightest hint of
something sinister, it becomes a puz
zling ending. You have to understand
that the novel is a conversation and
the end of the novel is the end of the
conversation. Do we know exactly
what happens? No.The novel is like a
conversation much like the world is in
conversation. Hie expectation that a
terrible thing is going to happen,
speaks for the world today.
AK: fhat is so true. If we had all the
answers, the state of the world would
be verv different. Personally. I felt a

little abandoned by the ending.
Maybe it is just because I haven't read
books that expect the reader to partic
ipate as much as the author has.
Mil: All you get from me is black
squiggles of ink on pulped wood. JTie
novel is a mirror. Every part of it. in
cluding the ending is a part of the
novel that occurs on the reader's side
of the divide. In the novel you are the
director and the cinematographer.
And because of that, to a certain ex
tent. maybe you are a little bit aban
doned. As an author, if you take the
time out to read this book. I'm happy.
AK: 1 low would you compare the re
action in London after the 7/11 attacks
to the reaction in American after the
9/11 attacks? How would you com
pare your response to that reaction?
MH: The 9/11 attacks happened in an
incredibly spectacular fashion. The
two attacks are not equal events.
When I talk about their reactions, I
want to make sure that we're not
equating the two things. In Britain,
people acted as if things were normal,
that things would go on. In Britain, it
seems like they are used to the con
cept of terrorism. They have dealt
with groups like the IRA.
That's very different from the
American reaction. For the Ameri
cans. things will never be the same.
Everybody should be very frightened.
I lere. the media has much more of an
emphasis on scaring people — that
factor is very endemic to American
media. The people are being overly
frightened about the wrong things. Ter
rorism is a huge problem that needs to
be addressed. But forty thousand peo
ple die in car accidents yearly. Six thou
sand died in the war on terror. We have
been made to be afraid.disproportion
ate to the risk. For Americans, this
sense of fear has always been evident.
Partly, it has to do with America's his
tory. the history of moving into new
territory — the whole series of things.
Whereas in Britain, people have been
living in the same place, enduring dif
ferent things. The place is less fright
ened.llie War on Terror is a misnomer.
It is a War on Fear.

them? You think he will scold them
for the inappropriateness of their
dress — their T-shirts and jeans? I
suspect not: those girls seem comfort
able in this area and are likely to come
here often, while he looks out of
place."( Pg 22) Please comment on lib
eralism and its interaction with Pak
istan being an Islamic Republic?
MH: What we call Islam is the Islam
of the Saudi culture. If you go to a
Pakistani village, all the women work.
If they didn't, people would starve.
Pakistan is unlike Middle Eastern
Countries; it is predominantly an agri
cultural society In Pakistan, the gov
ernment can't really tell the people
what to do because it doesn't do much
for the people. In Saudi Arabia, the
government can because it owns all
the oil and generates most of the rev
enue for the country.
Pakistan is incredibly diverse, and
not many people understand that
when they have only one interpreta
tion of the country. The question of lib
eralism is not an easy one. What we
need to understand are the dimensions
of our diversity. If you turn on the tele
vision in Pakistan, there is QTV, Fash
ion TV. ITiere is an urban vs. rural di
vide. You see women in jeans and in
traditional dresses.There are many dif
ferences geographically in the five dif
ferent provinces. While being a strong
agricultural center, it also has big in
dustrial belts. Even in terms of occupa
tion. there has been diversity with the
Aryans first, and then followed by the
Mongols and the British. So if you ask
me to comment on the interaction, I
would have to say it's very complex.
AK:The novel has been released in a
decade of turmoil, not only in the
West but also in Pakistan. The chief
justice of the Supreme Court was
fired and there have been countless
threats from madrassas (religious
schools). Do you think this is the
brink of a revolution? Will fundamen
talists take over a nation that is unsta
ble in its governance? Is this novel as
much a social critique as was "Moth
Smoke," your first novel?
MH: 1 m not convinced that Pakistan
is teetering on the brink of a revolu
tion. Yes, there might be a restoration,
but that is very different from a revo
lution. 1 actually wrote in support of
the idea that President Pervez
Musharraf needs to step down. The
idea that one man can be chief of army
staff and the President is not a part of
the constitution, even though he may
have started out with liberal inclina-

I * ' - - - J
tionsThe idea of a revolution in Pak
istan today is new; it is just a part of
media frenzy. There is a conflict in the
world today — a political conflict that
is misunderstood in religious terms.
Religious terms are used to dress up a
political conflict. I think the idea of
Pakistan being at the brink is invented
to control Pakistan's pragmatists. not
Utopians. They just want to do things
the way they are doing things.
AK: The story of Erica was a very
prominent part of the novel and cer
tainly doesn't seem completely one
dimensional. What is the parallel of
Erica's story?
MH: All authors hope that no charac
ter of theirs is one-dimensional!
Erica's nostalgia in the novel is one of
the most important themes. What is
nostalgia? It is a longing for the past,
an innate part of the human condition.
Nostalgia is not as prevalent when we
are younger —we think we are far
ther from death and life seems to glow.
But in a rapidly moving world, nostal
gia becomes more tempting. Even in
politics. Bush speaks of the "axis of
evil" — that is a Second World War
concept. When the social welfare state
was established, it was a form of nos
talgia. In my view of the world, nostal
gia can be both a crippling feeling and
one that makes you stronger. Erica's
affliction makes evident nostalgia's
multi-dimensional presence.
AK:The whole concept of the novel is
based on a conversation between two
men. Is it really believable that
Changez can tell so much to another,
a man he does not even know?
MH: The dramatic monologue has a
fantastical element. It is a form that is
playful. It allows you to bend reality in
a way that tempts the reader with sus
picion and disbelief. Can a conversa
tion like this really happen? Of course
not.
AK: Why did you write this book?
MH: 1 wanted to figure some things
out. I am in love with America and
deeply angry with it. sort of like
Changez. He is always aware of cer
tain benefits that America hands over
to him. benefits that are part of the
American corporate culture. At the
same time the culture doesn't work
for him. 1 le becomes at once ashamed
and proud of his background. It is a
strange dichotomy. The novel impli
cates the audience; it holds up a mir

ror to what they are. In that process,
the author establishes a conversation
with the audience.
AK: The title of the novel, "The Re
luctant Fundamentalist," is important
to the overall meaning. For me the
feeling of reluctance was less of an un
certainty than fundamentalism was.
for the character of Changez.
Mil: Cli angez. in some ways, does act
like a reluctant fundamentalist. He
doesn't want to leave America but has
to. It is that reluctance which is funda
mental and most direct. He works in a
company that values other compa
nies. He doesn't believe that society
should be governed with valuing eco
nomic fundamentals. It almost be
comes an ethical issue. As he becomes
more resistant to that, he becomes
more and more reluctant.
AK: The ending was probably the
most startling and frightful part of the
novel. Hie reader expects something
terrible to happen hut is not given a de
finitive ending. The lack of a concrete
ending leaves the reader hanging. Did
you intend for il to be that way?
MH:The end product is exactly what
I intended it to be. If an artist creates a
painting, it is everything he/she in
tends it to be. Usually readers are
hunting for answers and books can't
really give you the answer — the no
tion of the answer is actually wrong,
there is a multiplicity of answers
through which you become aware of
your own biases. The audience be
comes frightful of shadows. If an au
thor shows even the slightest hint of
something sinister, it becomes a puz
zling ending. You have to understand
that the novel is a conversation and
the end of the novel is the end of the
conversation. Do we know exactly
what happens? No.The novel is like a
conversation much like the world is in
conversation. Hie expectation that a
terrible thing is going to happen,
speaks for the world today.
AK: fhat is so true. If we had all the
answers, the state of the world would
be verv different. Personally. I felt a

little abandoned by the ending.
Maybe it is just because I haven't read
books that expect the reader to partic
ipate as much as the author has.
Mil: All you get from me is black
squiggles of ink on pulped wood. JTie
novel is a mirror. Every part of it. in
cluding the ending is a part of the
novel that occurs on the reader's side
of the divide. In the novel you are the
director and the cinematographer.
And because of that, to a certain ex
tent. maybe you are a little bit aban
doned. As an author, if you take the
time out to read this book. I'm happy.
AK: 1 low would you compare the re
action in London after the 7/11 attacks
to the reaction in American after the
9/11 attacks? How would you com
pare your response to that reaction?
MH: The 9/11 attacks happened in an
incredibly spectacular fashion. The
two attacks are not equal events.
When I talk about their reactions, I
want to make sure that we're not
equating the two things. In Britain,
people acted as if things were normal,
that things would go on. In Britain, it
seems like they are used to the con
cept of terrorism. They have dealt
with groups like the IRA.
That's very different from the
American reaction. For the Ameri
cans. things will never be the same.
Everybody should be very frightened.
I lere. the media has much more of an
emphasis on scaring people — that
factor is very endemic to American
media. The people are being overly
frightened about the wrong things. Ter
rorism is a huge problem that needs to
be addressed. But forty thousand peo
ple die in car accidents yearly. Six thou
sand died in the war on terror. We have
been made to be afraid.disproportion
ate to the risk. For Americans, this
sense of fear has always been evident.
Partly, it has to do with America's his
tory. the history of moving into new
territory — the whole series of things.
Whereas in Britain, people have been
living in the same place, enduring dif
ferent things. The place is less fright
ened.llie War on Terror is a misnomer.
It is a War on Fear.



SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Author Mohsin Hamid speaks to Stanford students on April 9. The author sat
down with Intermission reporter Anna Khan to talk about Hamid's new book.
Two weeks ago I sat down with
Mohsin Hamid, the unassuming and
fascinatingly articulate author of
"Moth smoke" and"The Reluctant
Fundamentalist, who was visiting
Stanford to speak to students. We
spoke of his novel, of Pakistan and of
the many issues of this current day
and age. The conversation moved
from a professional plane to one of
mutual understanding. Similar back
grounds brought forth issues that
were previously untouched for fear of
"not knowing enough."
"The Reluctant Fundamentalist"
is Mohsin Hamid's second novel.
Using the dramatic monologue form.
Hamid toys with problems of the cur
rent decade: nostalgia, terrorism, and
media induced misconception.
Through the pull between suspicion
and bias comes to surface the story of
Changez, a young man who ventures
forth from his homeland of Lahore,
Pakistan to study abroad at Prince
ton. Deeply talented, Changez lands a
job with Underwood Samson soon
after he graduates, but this perfect
lifestyle starts to slip away in light of
9/11. Not only do the attacks induce
change within the society, but they
also allow this change to creep into a
side love story. Full of rapid, often
startling conversation. Hamid forces
the reader to interact with the text.
The novel transcends borders, as it al
lows the reader to delve into issues
that survive past the last page. The
reader walks away with some form of
revelation, either of himself or of the
often blurry reality of today's world.
Anna khan: The book only follows
the voice of one character, Changez.
Was it easier for you to write the book
in monologue so that the American
voice did not have a chance to speak?
Mohsin Hamid: I wrote seven drafts of
this book— in a third person narra
tive, a first person narrative, an Amer
ican voice, a Pakistani voice and a
combination of both. The dramatic
monologue form that I finally decided

on allowed me to capture the way in
which the world sees itself today, in a
sense of mutual suspicion. It almost
mimics the global media where so
often you hear one side of the story.
My novel is written in a form that
takes the reverse side of the media: it
hands the content over to the 'reluc
tant fundamentalist." It is equally bi
ased. The reader has to realize, though,
that the novel is only a version of the
truth. Numerous hints are given
throughout the novel that Change?, is
not entirely a reliable character.
Ak: Your main character,Changez,is
Pakistani and went to Princeton just
like you did. I le also worked in New
York City for quite some time. Was
this in some way an autobiographical
novel?
MH: No. In me, there are both sides of
the conversations — the American
side and the Pakistani side.The novel
as a whole deals with an issue that is
important to me. 1 had much more of
an American experience than
Changez did: 1 spent half of my life in
the United States.
Ak: Quoting Changez, "Princeton
made everything possible for me. But
it did not. could not, make me forget
such things as how much 1 enjoy the
tea in this, the city of my birth..." Were
there times where you felt that you
had forgotten where you came from?
You went to the same school 1 did, the
Lahore American School, and 1 know
personally that it can be suffocating
when a school embraces a culture so
different from the one surrounding it.
Mil: Altogether, my parents have
thirteen siblings. That means 1 have
over two dozen cousins in Lahore,
who were within three or four years of
my age. A vast majority of my friends
and cousins didn't go to the Lahore
American School (LAS). 1 think 1 got
a much bigger slice of Lahore and so 1
didn't feel as suffocated. When I go
back to Lahore I don't go back to my
bubble of post-LAS. I go back to peo
ple who never thought of being any
where else but Lahore.

Ak: Quoting your novel. "You ap
pear distracted, sir; those pretty girls
from the National College of Arts
have clearly recaptured your atten
tion. Or are you watching that man.

a way that tempts the reader with sus
picion and disbelief. Can a conversa
tion like this really happen? Of course
not.
AK: Why did you write this book?
MH: 1 wanted to figure some things
out. I am in love with America and
deeply angry with it. sort of like
Changez. He is always aware of cer
tain benefits that America hands over
to him. benefits that are part of the
American corporate culture. At the
same time the culture doesn't work
for him. 1 le becomes at once ashamed
and proud of his background. It is a
strange dichotomy. The novel impli
cates the audience; it holds up a mir

ror to what they are. In that process,
the author establishes a conversation
with the audience.
AK: The title of the novel, "The Re
luctant Fundamentalist," is important
to the overall meaning. For me the
feeling of reluctance was less of an un
certainty than fundamentalism was.
for the character of Changez.
Mil: Cli angez. in some ways, does act
like a reluctant fundamentalist. He
doesn't want to leave America but has
to. It is that reluctance which is funda
mental and most direct. He works in a
company that values other compa
nies. He doesn't believe that society
should be governed with valuing eco
nomic fundamentals. It almost be
comes an ethical issue. As he becomes
more resistant to that, he becomes
more and more reluctant.
AK: The ending was probably the
most startling and frightful part of the
novel. Hie reader expects something
terrible to happen hut is not given a de
finitive ending. The lack of a concrete
ending leaves the reader hanging. Did
you intend for il to be that way?
MH:The end product is exactly what
I intended it to be. If an artist creates a
painting, it is everything he/she in
tends it to be. Usually readers are
hunting for answers and books can't
really give you the answer — the no
tion of the answer is actually wrong,
there is a multiplicity of answers
through which you become aware of
your own biases. The audience be
comes frightful of shadows. If an au
thor shows even the slightest hint of
something sinister, it becomes a puz
zling ending. You have to understand
that the novel is a conversation and
the end of the novel is the end of the
conversation. Do we know exactly
what happens? No.The novel is like a
conversation much like the world is in
conversation. Hie expectation that a
terrible thing is going to happen,
speaks for the world today.
AK: fhat is so true. If we had all the
answers, the state of the world would
be verv different. Personally. I felt a

little abandoned by the ending.
Maybe it is just because I haven't read
books that expect the reader to partic
ipate as much as the author has.
Mil: All you get from me is black
squiggles of ink on pulped wood. JTie
novel is a mirror. Every part of it. in
cluding the ending is a part of the
novel that occurs on the reader's side
of the divide. In the novel you are the
director and the cinematographer.
And because of that, to a certain ex
tent. maybe you are a little bit aban
doned. As an author, if you take the
time out to read this book. I'm happy.
AK: 1 low would you compare the re
action in London after the 7/11 attacks
to the reaction in American after the
9/11 attacks? How would you com
pare your response to that reaction?
MH: The 9/11 attacks happened in an
incredibly spectacular fashion. The
two attacks are not equal events.
When I talk about their reactions, I
want to make sure that we're not
equating the two things. In Britain,
people acted as if things were normal,
that things would go on. In Britain, it
seems like they are used to the con
cept of terrorism. They have dealt
with groups like the IRA.
That's very different from the
American reaction. For the Ameri
cans. things will never be the same.
Everybody should be very frightened.
I lere. the media has much more of an
emphasis on scaring people — that
factor is very endemic to American
media. The people are being overly
frightened about the wrong things. Ter
rorism is a huge problem that needs to
be addressed. But forty thousand peo
ple die in car accidents yearly. Six thou
sand died in the war on terror. We have
been made to be afraid.disproportion
ate to the risk. For Americans, this
sense of fear has always been evident.
Partly, it has to do with America's his
tory. the history of moving into new
territory — the whole series of things.
Whereas in Britain, people have been
living in the same place, enduring dif
ferent things. The place is less fright
ened.llie War on Terror is a misnomer.
It is a War on Fear.



SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Author Mohsin Hamid speaks to Stanford students on April 9. The author sat
down with Intermission reporter Anna Khan to talk about Hamid's new book.
Two weeks ago I sat down with
Mohsin Hamid, the unassuming and
fascinatingly articulate author of
"Moth smoke" and"The Reluctant
Fundamentalist, who was visiting
Stanford to speak to students. We
spoke of his novel, of Pakistan and of
the many issues of this current day
and age. The conversation moved
from a professional plane to one of
mutual understanding. Similar back
grounds brought forth issues that
were previously untouched for fear of
"not knowing enough."
"The Reluctant Fundamentalist"
is Mohsin Hamid's second novel.
Using the dramatic monologue form.
Hamid toys with problems of the cur
rent decade: nostalgia, terrorism, and
media induced misconception.
Through the pull between suspicion
and bias comes to surface the story of
Changez, a young man who ventures
forth from his homeland of Lahore,
Pakistan to study abroad at Prince
ton. Deeply talented, Changez lands a
job with Underwood Samson soon
after he graduates, but this perfect
lifestyle starts to slip away in light of
9/11. Not only do the attacks induce
change within the society, but they
also allow this change to creep into a
side love story. Full of rapid, often
startling conversation. Hamid forces
the reader to interact with the text.
The novel transcends borders, as it al
lows the reader to delve into issues
that survive past the last page. The
reader walks away with some form of
revelation, either of himself or of the
often blurry reality of today's world.
Anna khan: The book only follows
the voice of one character, Changez.
Was it easier for you to write the book
in monologue so that the American
voice did not have a chance to speak?
Mohsin Hamid: I wrote seven drafts of
this book— in a third person narra
tive, a first person narrative, an Amer
ican voice, a Pakistani voice and a
combination of both. The dramatic
monologue form that I finally decided

on allowed me to capture the way in
which the world sees itself today, in a
sense of mutual suspicion. It almost
mimics the global media where so
often you hear one side of the story.
My novel is written in a form that
takes the reverse side of the media: it
hands the content over to the 'reluc
tant fundamentalist." It is equally bi
ased. The reader has to realize, though,
that the novel is only a version of the
truth. Numerous hints are given
throughout the novel that Change?, is
not entirely a reliable character.
Ak: Your main character,Changez,is
Pakistani and went to Princeton just
like you did. I le also worked in New
York City for quite some time. Was
this in some way an autobiographical
novel?
MH: No. In me, there are both sides of
the conversations — the American
side and the Pakistani side.The novel
as a whole deals with an issue that is
important to me. 1 had much more of
an American experience than
Changez did: 1 spent half of my life in
the United States.
Ak: Quoting Changez, "Princeton
made everything possible for me. But
it did not. could not, make me forget
such things as how much 1 enjoy the
tea in this, the city of my birth..." Were
there times where you felt that you
had forgotten where you came from?
You went to the same school 1 did, the
Lahore American School, and 1 know
personally that it can be suffocating
when a school embraces a culture so
different from the one surrounding it.
Mil: Altogether, my parents have
thirteen siblings. That means 1 have
over two dozen cousins in Lahore,
who were within three or four years of
my age. A vast majority of my friends
and cousins didn't go to the Lahore
American School (LAS). 1 think 1 got
a much bigger slice of Lahore and so 1
didn't feel as suffocated. When I go
back to Lahore I don't go back to my
bubble of post-LAS. I go back to peo
ple who never thought of being any
where else but Lahore.

Ak: Quoting your novel. "You ap
pear distracted, sir; those pretty girls
from the National College of Arts
have clearly recaptured your atten
tion. Or are you watching that man.
the one with the beard far longer than
mine, who has stopped to stand beside
them? You think he will scold them
for the inappropriateness of their
dress — their T-shirts and jeans? I
suspect not: those girls seem comfort
able in this area and are likely to come
here often, while he looks out of
place."( Pg 22) Please comment on lib
eralism and its interaction with Pak
istan being an Islamic Republic?
MH: What we call Islam is the Islam
of the Saudi culture. If you go to a
Pakistani village, all the women work.
If they didn't, people would starve.
Pakistan is unlike Middle Eastern
Countries; it is predominantly an agri
cultural society In Pakistan, the gov
ernment can't really tell the people
what to do because it doesn't do much
for the people. In Saudi Arabia, the
government can because it owns all
the oil and generates most of the rev
enue for the country.
Pakistan is incredibly diverse, and
not many people understand that
when they have only one interpreta
tion of the country. The question of lib
eralism is not an easy one. What we
need to understand are the dimensions
of our diversity. If you turn on the tele
vision in Pakistan, there is QTV, Fash
ion TV. ITiere is an urban vs. rural di
vide. You see women in jeans and in
traditional dresses.There are many dif
ferences geographically in the five dif
ferent provinces. While being a strong
agricultural center, it also has big in
dustrial belts. Even in terms of occupa
tion. there has been diversity with the
Aryans first, and then followed by the
Mongols and the British. So if you ask
me to comment on the interaction, I
would have to say it's very complex.
AK:The novel has been released in a
decade of turmoil, not only in the
West but also in Pakistan. The chief
justice of the Supreme Court was
fired and there have been countless
threats from madrassas (religious
schools). Do you think this is the
brink of a revolution? Will fundamen
talists take over a nation that is unsta
ble in its governance? Is this novel as
much a social critique as was "Moth
Smoke," your first novel?
MH: 1 m not convinced that Pakistan
is teetering on the brink of a revolu
tion. Yes, there might be a restoration,
but that is very different from a revo
lution. 1 actually wrote in support of
the idea that President Pervez
Musharraf needs to step down. The
idea that one man can be chief of army
staff and the President is not a part of
the constitution, even though he may
have started out with liberal inclina-

I * ' - - - J
tionsThe idea of a revolution in Pak
istan today is new; it is just a part of
media frenzy. There is a conflict in the
world today — a political conflict that
is misunderstood in religious terms.
Religious terms are used to dress up a
political conflict. I think the idea of
Pakistan being at the brink is invented
to control Pakistan's pragmatists. not
Utopians. They just want to do things
the way they are doing things.
AK: The story of Erica was a very
prominent part of the novel and cer
tainly doesn't seem completely one
dimensional. What is the parallel of
Erica's story?
MH: All authors hope that no charac
ter of theirs is one-dimensional!
Erica's nostalgia in the novel is one of
the most important themes. What is
nostalgia? It is a longing for the past,
an innate part of the human condition.
Nostalgia is not as prevalent when we
are younger —we think we are far
ther from death and life seems to glow.
But in a rapidly moving world, nostal
gia becomes more tempting. Even in
politics. Bush speaks of the "axis of
evil" — that is a Second World War
concept. When the social welfare state
was established, it was a form of nos
talgia. In my view of the world, nostal
gia can be both a crippling feeling and
one that makes you stronger. Erica's
affliction makes evident nostalgia's
multi-dimensional presence.
AK:The whole concept of the novel is
based on a conversation between two
men. Is it really believable that
Changez can tell so much to another,
a man he does not even know?
MH: The dramatic monologue has a
fantastical element. It is a form that is
playful. It allows you to bend reality in
a way that tempts the reader with sus
picion and disbelief. Can a conversa
tion like this really happen? Of course
not.
