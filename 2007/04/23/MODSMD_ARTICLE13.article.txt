## Editorial Board Ex-terrorists, decency and debate 
### 
Last Monday night. one of the most
controversial events of the year took
place on campus. The Stanford Col
lege Republicans and the Stanford Review,
who jointly organized the event, com
plained incessantly about regulations from
the Office of Student Activities. The ban
ning ot outside media was lilted when media
sources such as the International Herald
Tribune carried stories about it. Called
"Three Ex Terrorists." the panel purported
to "discuss indoctrination and incitement in
the Muslim world." It was bound to be con
troversial: I lie three panelists were in fact
ex-terrorists, having been formerly part of
the PLO.
It is clear that these questions about
Islam and terrorism need to be asked, but
the event was a disappointing forum that
had more than its fair share of indoctrina
tion. l irst. the three panelists, especially
Walid Shoebat. had a strong tendency to
shout down students during the question
and-answer period. Shoebat relied on se
lective quotations and prepared respons
es. Second, the remarks by the three men
contained many historical inaccuracies,
which when corrected by members ot the
audience, were ignored or dismissed with

out citation. Third, the event was not pro
ductive toward reaching a better under
standing of Islamic fundamentalism.
American foreign policy or any larger
subject at all.The three men. each a Chris
tian convert, were harshly critical of Islam
as a religion, but they dismissed important
arguments about the moderates in the
faith.
The most stirring and provocative mo
ment of the night was when one of the stat
ed that the U.S. was lying down and ignoring
the threat of Islamic fundamentalism, and
woke up after Sept. 11 only long enough to
hit the snooze button and go back to sleep.
This was hardly a comment on anything
substantive, and none of the three men sug
gested how the U.S. could better go about
combating Islamic fundamentalism, besides
implying that a much stronger military re
sponse was needed. While a distrust of Islam
was promoted, the panelists were unable to.
or chose not to. provide any policy changes
or deep cultural analysis.
What was the point of the event, then?
The event was powerful and fascinating;
however, the panelists provided no rational
outcome for the arguments they raised dur
ing the talk.
