# Admit Weekend? LOL
## 
### 
I had one eye trained on the sky last
week, and another on Weather.com.
As storm clouds rolled in. I brimmed
with glee, willing the Gods to flex their
meteorological muscles. But somewhere
up in the ivory towers of Tresidder. Sweet
Hall, and a nondescript building on
Galvcz. certain very important people
were cowering in fear, huddled around the
weather report.
Such anxiety surrounding weather con
ditions can only mean one thing: Admit
Weekend, 2007. With the arrival of ProFros
imminent and gloomy conditions showing
no signs of cheering up. I've no doubt that
members of the Admissions Department
and .1 handful of administrators had their
collective, Prol ro-hungry stomach tied up
in knots.
I. 011 the other hand, was having a ball.
Anytime the administration squirms is a
good time in my book. So when the weather
took ;i turn for the worst at this most critical
juncture in Stanford history, when we need
ed Northern California to be Southern Cal
ifornia. j list for one stinkin' weekend of the
year (one weekend!), the vindictive part of
me reared its ugly head.
"Bring on the precipitation, bring on
the clouds, bring on the bitter fifty-five to
sixty degree frosts!!" it exclaimed. The
supposedly less vindictive part of me nod
ded in vigorous agreement, and hummed
the tune of Hilary Duff's smash hit "Come
Clean." I was consumed by a twisted desire
to reveal to the mass of all Joe and Jane
Prol i os. soon to find themselves caught in
a deluge of Stanford Propaganda (Stan-
ProPo. if you like), the Truth! The pro
found. unrelenting, all-revealing Truth
about this place; that elusive concept that
certain higher-ups from the University
like to sweep under the rug for a certain
weekend every April and a certain week
long summer camp in late September—a
concept light years removed from the im
penetrable nether region that stretches
from the Oval to the front of Memorial
Church, where Asian tourists have their
playtime.
i don't think I'm being too "radical" in
believing that Admit Weekend should not
be the great hulking lie that it is. I'm no ex
pert in ethics or anything, but I don't see
the justification for outright deluding a
great mass of clueless high school kids, co
ercing them to come to a place they've
never seen without severely corrected vi
sion. courtesy of spontaneous (staged)
fountain hopping runs,driveling ice-break
ers anil bonding activities that seem cliill at
the time, and nightly HoMoPaloozas at
Wilbur dining.
Clearly it wouldn't be enough to simply
let the Prof ros roam around on your av
erage Spring Quarter weekend. You
know, check out some classes, chat up some
"chill, laid back" Californians, toss a Fris
bee. buy a Stanford hoodie (anil one for
Mom too), and then hit up some sweet, to
tally laid buck social functions.
What's wrong with that picture? Is Stan
ford afraid to reveal that the average life of
a student consists of working too hard, run
ning around to meetings at all hours of the
day and night, and then, with a sigh of relief,
yetting sloshed?

I can see it now: Admit Weekend with no
programming, no dorm flag waving, no epic
a capella shows, and no Prohibition —the
administration's worst fear. With Rol los up
to their necks in midterms, the poor
ProFros, without the guiding light of recy
cled icebreakers and without a fleck of good
judgment in their juvenile bones, they
would surely take to rampant alcohol con
sumption, which inevitably translates into a
fatal plummet down in the Princeton Re
view rankings. Yes, that seems a likely sce
nario. Too bad the Admit Weekends of I lar
vard.Princeton.Yale,and Mi l have all been
confirmed to be significantly "wetter" than
ours.
St) what's to be done? Are we as stu
dents obligated to tell ProFros the truth?
That the weather is dull and temperate,
and never as sunny as you'd expect? That
the Administration doesn't have enough
confidence in the merits of its University
to let the kids choose for themselves, with
out prepackaged nonsense factoring
strongly in the decision? I don't like
prepackaged nonsense, unless it's edible.
Absolute Fun is Absolutely Atrocious. I
want people to come to Stanford because
they genuinely want to be here. How can
our ProFros decide they genuinely want to
be here? Show 'em the truth, lhere are
more than enough remarkable individuals
here to show any Pro Fro a good time,
where "good time" is not limited to binge
drinking...right? I was thrilled that big
events like The Wild Party were show
cased this weekend. That's not Admit
Weekend BS. That's just Stanford being
awesome.
Unfortunately. I didn't have a Pro Fro to
myselt, but I talked to a few. especially
those unlucky enough to have wound up in
I roSoCo. Fliey all seemed so genuinely
happy to be here, even the mind-numbing
ly obnoxious ones who were "set on
( hemF. and talked like they owned the
place. One Pro Fro told my math major
friend that "Math seems like such an easy
major. LOL, I could do it in like two years!"
LOL!!! LOL!!! In my culture, we like to
say: R U SUM KIND OF JOKER?
Still. I'd feel dirty letting the kiddies in on
the secret:"Stanford isn't all fun and games.
Sometimes its fun. and if you live in FroSo-
Co or SIT:, you'll probably play a lot of
board games, but there's also something
called work. I guess its really sort of option
al, but being the budding investment
bankers you are, you should probably do it.
Oh, and in places like Robinson, we don't
even have dorm flags!"
Shocking. I know.

Alex is glad the Proiros are gone, and is also
glad that the Yankees SUCK. If you gotta
problem with that, send him some fightin'
words at aeotextMfl Stanford.edit

and .1 handful of administrators had their
collective, Prol ro-hungry stomach tied up
in knots.
I. 011 the other hand, was having a ball.
Anytime the administration squirms is a
good time in my book. So when the weather
took ;i turn for the worst at this most critical
juncture in Stanford history, when we need
ed Northern California to be Southern Cal
ifornia. j list for one stinkin' weekend of the
year (one weekend!), the vindictive part of
me reared its ugly head.
"Bring on the precipitation, bring on
the clouds, bring on the bitter fifty-five to
sixty degree frosts!!" it exclaimed. The
supposedly less vindictive part of me nod
ded in vigorous agreement, and hummed
the tune of Hilary Duff's smash hit "Come
Clean." I was consumed by a twisted desire
to reveal to the mass of all Joe and Jane
Prol i os. soon to find themselves caught in
a deluge of Stanford Propaganda (Stan-
ProPo. if you like), the Truth! The pro
found. unrelenting, all-revealing Truth
about this place; that elusive concept that
certain higher-ups from the University
like to sweep under the rug for a certain
weekend every April and a certain week
long summer camp in late September—a
concept light years removed from the im
penetrable nether region that stretches
from the Oval to the front of Memorial
Church, where Asian tourists have their
playtime.
i don't think I'm being too "radical" in
believing that Admit Weekend should not
be the great hulking lie that it is. I'm no ex
pert in ethics or anything, but I don't see
the justification for outright deluding a
great mass of clueless high school kids, co
ercing them to come to a place they've
never seen without severely corrected vi
sion. courtesy of spontaneous (staged)
fountain hopping runs,driveling ice-break
ers anil bonding activities that seem cliill at
the time, and nightly HoMoPaloozas at
Wilbur dining.
Clearly it wouldn't be enough to simply
let the Prof ros roam around on your av
erage Spring Quarter weekend. You
know, check out some classes, chat up some
"chill, laid back" Californians, toss a Fris
bee. buy a Stanford hoodie (anil one for
Mom too), and then hit up some sweet, to
tally laid buck social functions.
What's wrong with that picture? Is Stan
ford afraid to reveal that the average life of
a student consists of working too hard, run
ning around to meetings at all hours of the
day and night, and then, with a sigh of relief,
yetting sloshed?

I can see it now: Admit Weekend with no
programming, no dorm flag waving, no epic
a capella shows, and no Prohibition —the
administration's worst fear. With Rol los up
to their necks in midterms, the poor
ProFros, without the guiding light of recy
cled icebreakers and without a fleck of good
judgment in their juvenile bones, they
would surely take to rampant alcohol con
sumption, which inevitably translates into a
fatal plummet down in the Princeton Re
view rankings. Yes, that seems a likely sce
nario. Too bad the Admit Weekends of I lar
vard.Princeton.Yale,and Mi l have all been
confirmed to be significantly "wetter" than
ours.
St) what's to be done? Are we as stu
dents obligated to tell ProFros the truth?
That the weather is dull and temperate,
and never as sunny as you'd expect? That
the Administration doesn't have enough
confidence in the merits of its University
to let the kids choose for themselves, with
out prepackaged nonsense factoring
strongly in the decision? I don't like
prepackaged nonsense, unless it's edible.
Absolute Fun is Absolutely Atrocious. I
want people to come to Stanford because
they genuinely want to be here. How can
our ProFros decide they genuinely want to
be here? Show 'em the truth, lhere are
more than enough remarkable individuals
here to show any Pro Fro a good time,
where "good time" is not limited to binge
drinking...right? I was thrilled that big
events like The Wild Party were show
cased this weekend. That's not Admit
Weekend BS. That's just Stanford being
awesome.
Unfortunately. I didn't have a Pro Fro to
myselt, but I talked to a few. especially
those unlucky enough to have wound up in
I roSoCo. Fliey all seemed so genuinely
happy to be here, even the mind-numbing
ly obnoxious ones who were "set on
( hemF. and talked like they owned the
place. One Pro Fro told my math major
friend that "Math seems like such an easy
major. LOL, I could do it in like two years!"
LOL!!! LOL!!! In my culture, we like to
say: R U SUM KIND OF JOKER?
Still. I'd feel dirty letting the kiddies in on
the secret:"Stanford isn't all fun and games.
Sometimes its fun. and if you live in FroSo-
Co or SIT:, you'll probably play a lot of
board games, but there's also something
called work. I guess its really sort of option
al, but being the budding investment
bankers you are, you should probably do it.
Oh, and in places like Robinson, we don't
even have dorm flags!"
Shocking. I know.

Alex is glad the Proiros are gone, and is also
glad that the Yankees SUCK. If you gotta
problem with that, send him some fightin'
words at aeotextMfl Stanford.edit
