# Tasting the stars

### 
France is known for a lot of things: cheese,
fashion, lost generation expats, revolu
tions. But there's nothing quite as revered
or idolized as French wine. Whites from Alsace,
reds from Bordeaux and, of course. Cham
pagne. Ah. champagne. That sparkling elixir
whose every bubble contains a glimmer of cel
ebration and decadence; the drink of kings, nay,
of gods; the very personification of elegance.
Nothing could more perfectly, more complete
ly encapsulate the very essence of France. And
since Reims, the center of the renowned Cham
pagne region, is just a short two-hour train ride
away from Paris, I decided to spend last Sunday
immersing myself in French culture.
I had heard that the highlight of the city
was its champagne caves and that one could
get a tour of these caves for a mere 15 euros.
I had no idea what exactly a Champagne cave
was, but it sounded promising. Plus, each tour
ended with Champagne tasting.
1 decided to visit the headquarters of Piper-
I leidsieck,a champagne giant who's been in the
business since 1785. I'd read in some guidebook
that most of the champagne production in
France is d< >minated by a handful of such ancient
families who are steeped in tradition,sol expect
ed a simple tour, focusing on ties to royalty and
nobility and champagne-making techniques
dating back to 13th century monks. But as we
boarded the Indiana Jones-style buggy that was
to be our guide. I began to have my doubts.
In a very Disneyland-esque manner, a
voice boomed out from the speakers, telling
us to please keep our hands and feet inside
the vehicle at all times. As the buggy's safety
restraints lowered, we were off to explore
"the magical world of Piper-Heidsieck." I
could see dark shapes protruding from the
walls and, to my absolute horror, soon real
ized that the shapes were 10 foot tall stone
grape vines. As we approached each one, our
disembodied guide told us about the different
varieties of grapes used to make champagne.
While he spoke of red wines, such as the Pinot

Noir. the stones were bathed in purple lights
(the leaves, however, remained green). When
he told us about white wines, such as the
Chardonnay, the stones were bathed in a
white light. Suddenly, the room went dark and
lights began to glitter on the ceiling to sym
bolize nighttime. It almost felt like we were in
a real vineyard... except for the whole stone,
buggy and being in a cave thing.
Luckily, we didn't have to use our imagina
tion for long, because after the lights came back
on, large stone hands appeared from the ceiling
to demonstrate how the large stone grapes
should be picked and handled. A violin concer
to played in the background. As the buggy
turned a corner, we were greeted by an army of
life-sized stone men, posed in front of endless
rows of champagne bottles. Upon closer exami
nation, we realized that the bottles were empty.
Now that we had learned how the grapes are
picked and the champagne stored, it was time
to for the "disgorging." Apparently, after years
of fermentation in the caves, a sediment forms
in the bottle of champagne. To remove it, the
sediment has to be trapped in the neck of the
bottle, which is then frozen. Once the bottle is
opened, the pressure causes the frozen sedi
ment to shoot out, much like a cork.To help us
understand the process, the buggy entered a
tunnel-like chamber, which was illuminated by
dancing circles of light. The tunnel began to get
narrower. 1 soon realized that the tunnel sym
bolized the neck of a champagne bottle and our
buggy the ice. As the buggy soared through the
tunnel with festive music playing in the back

ground. I felt like 1 could sympathize with the
cork. After successfully being ejected from the
tunnel/bottle, we were greeted by festive bub
bles and more sparkling lights.
But nothing could compare to the tour's
grand finale. We entered a replica of the set of
Casablanca. A 1 lumphrey Bogart mannequin
sat at a bar stool, sipping a glass of Piper-Hei
dsieck. A voice boomed out:"Everybody, let's
try that again. Bogey, back in place." I"he tour
then finished with a series of photographs of
celebrities drinking Piper-Heidsieck. As we
passed through the hallway of photos, a
French pop song blasted from the cave walls.
The buggy suddenly rotated around and we
found ourselves facing a mirror opposite the
photographs. Looking at my reflection next to
the photos, it was almost like sharing a glass of
champagne with George Clooney.
1 had expected monks, kings, real bottles of
champagne; instead I got stone grapes and
Humphrey Bogart. 1 had expected tradition,
class, elegance; instead 1 got a less impressive
and more alcoholic version of Disneyland. But
thinking about it.it makes perfect sense. Every
thing in France seems to be moving away from
tradition. Advertisements on the metro are in
English, no one follows the strict language rules
established by L'Academie francaise and high
schoolers have dreadlocks and rap on street
corners. Even in France, knowing that Britney
Spears drinks your product is much more im
pressive than having caves that once belonged
to some Medieval monks or being the favorite
champagne of some long forgotten king.
And even though 1 was initially disap
pointed by the tour's lack of "authenticity." it
was well worth it. Especially when we got to
taste three varieties of champagne at the end.
Because despite the kitschiness of it all, these
guys still make a fine, fine champagne.

Vicky is planning a wine-tasting tour of Franco.
