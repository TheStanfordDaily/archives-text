## When will we be sweatshop free? 
### BETHANY WOOLMAN 
'lliis is an invitation to all students, student
groups, faculty and alumni to take a stand and
encourage our I Iniversity to promote human
rights worldwide. When President Hennessy
announced The Stanford Challenge in 2006,
he represented the best of our University — a
University that uses its resources to make pos
itive and progressive change in a world full of
problems. I lennessy challenged all of us to
"meet the commitment made by Jane and Le
land Stanford 'to promote the public welfare
by exercising an influence on behalf of hu
manity and civilization.'" In the spirit of the
Stanford Challenge, a coalition of concerned
Stanford students launched a campaign to en
sure that Stanford is doing its best to promote
fair, healthy and safe labor practices through
out the world. Currently, Stanford University
has no mechanism to ensure that clothing that
bears the proud Stanford name is not pro
duced in sweatshops. The Sweatshop-Free
Stanford Campaign has been working tireless
ly for two quarters now to provide the Univer
sity with an alternative to sweatshop products.
In the past two months, we have had a se
ries of promising meetings with the adminis
tration. Most notably. President Hennessy
and Susan Weinstein, Head of Trademark Li
censing. have expressed their agreement that
Stanford should actively support an alterna
tive to sweatshop labor in third world coun
tries. Additionally. we have agreed that Stan
lord needs to partner with a monitoring body
to encourage our distributors,such as Nike, to
promote fair labor practices in the factories
they have contracts with. However, we ap
pear to have reached a stalemate with regards
to which monitoring organization that will be.
This is where your input matters.
After seven weeks of research, we are
convinced that Stanford should follow in the
footsteps of 160 colleges and universities na
tionwide and partner with the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC), an independent, non
profit monitoring organization. Additionally,
we should sign on to the Designated Suppli
er's Program (DSP), as 30 other schools have
done, including Columbia, Cornell, George
town. Duke, and the entire UC system. In
joining the WRC, Stanford will adopt a man
ufacturing code of conduct that guarantees
workers basic human rights. In order to en

force this code of conduct, it is imperative
that we also join the DSP.This move will en
sure that factory owners have both the incen
tive and the resources to pay their workers a
living wage, allow them to unionize, and cre
ate a safe working environment.
Unfortunately, Susan Weinstein is recom
mending to President Hennessy that we not
join the WRC and the DSP. and instead join a
separate monitoring organization called the
Fair Labor Association (FLA). We are troubled
by this recommendation for a multitude of rea
sons. Most notably, the large number of distrib
utor corporations that sit on the FLA board re
sults in a clear conflict of interest, preventing
the FLA from being as effective as it could be.
We do not think companies should have execu
tive control over the monitoring of their own
factories, just like we do not think companies
should audit their own financial records.This is
a classic case of the fox guarding the chicken
coop. Furthermore, in numerous cases, the
FLA has repeatedly demonstrated an unwill
ingness to hold companies accountable for
worker rights abuses. While companies natural
ly prefer the FLA over the WRC and the DSP
we strongly believe that Stanford is an institu
tion of integrity. To be swayed on this issue by
corporate interests would be immoral.
After seven weeks of meeting with President
Hennessy and University administrators,
preparing research and presenting our case for
the joining the WRC and the DSP we are asking
IVesident Hennessy to decide whether he sup
ports our campaign to make Stanford a truly
sweat-free university. Ihough it was understood
that these seven weeks of meetings were a
forum for the administration to consider our re
search and our proposal. President I lennessy
has asked us to provide him with a formal report
to aid him with his decision. We have done so.
and though we expected his decision within the
week, he has recently alerted us that he will not
make this decision a priority until June. Addi
tionally, he has not responded to our requests
for a final meeting. We have consistently acted
in gixxl faith and have always aimed to work
alongside the administration, but at this point.
President Hennessy unfortunately appears to
be digging in his heels and stalling.
We believe that we must end Stanford's
connection to sweatshops as soon as possible,
and we will not relent in our campaign to
make Stanford sweat-free. Please help us en

courage Hennessy to make the right decision
in a timely fashion. If you need more infor
mation, visit sweatfree.stanford.edu and
download the policy briefing we submitted to
him on Monday (We had hoped to post Ms.
Weinstein's policy briefing as well, but she
has requested that it be kept confidential.)
Additionally, please email ddshih@stan
ford.edu if you or your organization would
like to officially endorse us. Other than that,
we look forward to seeing you at campus
wide rallies and events in the near future.
Please stop by our isew-ini this Wednesday at
noon in White Plaza. We are confident that if
President Hennessy truly believes our great
university can rise to the Stanford Challenge,
he will support joining the WRC and the
DSP. rhank you so much for your patience,
time, and support.

we look forward to seeing you at campus
wide rallies and events in the near future.
Please stop by our isew-ini this Wednesday at
noon in White Plaza. We are confident that if
President Hennessy truly believes our great
university can rise to the Stanford Challenge,
he will support joining the WRC and the
DSP. rhank you so much for your patience,
time, and support.
