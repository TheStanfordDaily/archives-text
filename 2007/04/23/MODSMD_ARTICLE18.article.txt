Fosters make a mother proud
Dear Editors:
In response to Friday s letter "Fast Sets Dan
gerous Precedent:"
I am a mother of one of the Living Wage
tasters. Like all mothers. I tried to raise my
child to care about others, to believe in fair
play and to stand up for his convictions. Now
my son is doing just that and my heart is torn.
He is taking seriously the ideals that not only
his mother, but his teachers and, yes, even
President Flennessy, hold.
Grant Everett Starrett believes "it sets a bad
precedent for the Stanford administration to re
ward such behavior." I think it is the Universi
ty's job to promote such behavior. Mr. Starrett
cannot imagine a future at Stanford in which
groups ... perform similar practices." Unfortu
nately. neither can I. Imagine students all over
campus pursuing all legal means at tremendous
personal cost to help others be treated fairly. If.
by listening to SLAC, President I lennessy is en
couraging other students to follow suit, the
world would become a better place for all of us.
ELLEN HRLMAN
