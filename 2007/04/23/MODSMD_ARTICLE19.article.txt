## For baseball, the agony of defeat

Stanford baseball needed to come
out of the gate strong at California this
weekend. But after losing two of three
at Evans Diamond by a 19-9 margin,
the Cardinal's conference hopes look
bleaker than ever, with the squad still
looking for its first Pacific-10 Confer
ence series victory.

Stanford (16-20.2-10 l'ac-10) started
the series with a Friday night tilt against
the Bears' ace righty Tyson Ross. Ross
shut down the Cardinal, going 7.2 in
nings and allowing only five hits.
The game was largely an exercise in
offensive futility for Stanford, as just
three players — junior right fielder
Michael Taylor, junior first baseman
Randy Molina and sophomore left
fielder Joey August — collected hits
against the Bears (21-20,5-7), who won
3-0. The Cardinal left eight men on

base as sophomore Jeremy Bleich took
yet another hard-luck loss, dropping
his record 1-6, despite allowing just six
hits over 7.2 innings.
"TVson Ross pitched a very good
game against us today," coach Mark
Marquess said. "And when you have a
couple of chances to score like we did.
you have to take advantage of them."
The series' second game provided
redemption. Ilie Cardinal won out in
an emotional roller-coaster, scoring
three runs in the seventh and eighth in
nings en route to a 4-3 thriller over its
Bay Area rivals. Junior Erik Davis got
the win in relief of freshman starter Jef
frey Inman, who allowed just two runs
in five innings of work.
But it was clutch hitting that really
won the game for the Cardinal, which
entered the seventh down 2-1. Sopho
more shortstop Cord Phelps' single
drove in the inning's first run, and
sophomore centerfielder Sean Ratliff
drew an RBI walk for the second.
Cal came back in the bottom half of
the seventh, though, scoring one run on
a pair of singles and a sacrifice bunt,
sending the game to the eighth tied at
three. But junior catcher Brian Juhl's
single drove in an unearned run in the
eighth, and junior Nolan Gallagher
pitched two scoreless innings of one-hit
ball for his first save of the year.
"We really wanted to come out
today and show the type of team we're
made of." junior second baseman
Adam Sorgi said. "This was a really
good team victory for us. The one thing
that we got today that we've been miss
ing all year is this type of momentum."
Stanford couldn't keep the momen
tum Sunday, however, as the Bears
blasted their way to a 13-5 thrashing.

Davis and sophomores Max
Fearnow and Tom Stilson did most
of the damage. Fearnow allowed five
earned runs on five hits, while
recording just one out in his first
start of the season.
Defense was again a problem for
the Cardinal, as the Bears scored
three runs after senior third base
man Ryan Seawell's error extended
the inning. All told. Stanford com
mitted seven errors in the final two
games of the series.
The series loss to the Bears deals
a serious blow to the Cardinal's post

season hopes, as Stanford will re
main last in the Pac-10 with just a
pair of conference victories. Califor
nia now sits at seventh in the Pac-10
with its sixth win of the year against
a conference opponent. The week
end seemed to show just how far
Stanford has regressed: The Cardi
nal swept the Bears in a non-confer
ence series earlier this season.
Stanford will return to action at
home this week with a pair of non
conference games, Tuesday against
San Jose State and Wednesday
against Fresno State, before hosting
conference rival and defending na
tional champion Oregon State in a
three-game weekend series.
