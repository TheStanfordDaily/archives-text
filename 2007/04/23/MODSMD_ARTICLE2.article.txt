# PROFROS PROFILED:
## Six new faces on the Farm 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION MAN RIVER 
Watching all those cute little ProFros last week
end reminded me of a different, more innocent
time. A time when we actually bothered wearing
high heels to classes, when we all seriously cared
about the SA T scores of virtual strangers, when we
feared there might actually exist a mythical perma
nent record of every time we got recess detention in
elementary school. In short. Admit Weekend takes
us all back to life before college. Generally,prospec
tive freshman can be sorted into a few categories.
Which of these did you fit into, back in the day?
True-Blue Cardinal: This spirited little filly has

spent the past eighteen years dream
ing of Lakeside Dining and practic
ing her wacky walk: she knows all
Branner's dorm chants from the

past five years and she actual
ly believes that we might win
Big Game again in the conceiv
able future. The True-Blue
Cardinal Pro Fro is a Stanford
devotee to the bone, and sent
in her early acceptance

months ago.The only reason she's

going to Admit Weekend at all is to get a dose of
HoHoPalooza to tide her over until MuFuUnSun
and, of course, to become "besties 4eva!" with her
RoHo.HoHo and future RFs.
Typical quote: "Go Stanford!"
Haughty Harvardite: No force of man or God is
going to recruit this young Pro Fro to Stanford: he
was accepted to all sixteen universities he applied
to, including two colleges at Oxford. You know this
because he told you within the first
y twenty seconds of conversation.

Multiple times. He only applied to
Stanford as a practice application
before sending off his envelopes to
all of the "real" schools back East.
He spends the entire weekend

chain-smoking cloves and quot
ing Ulysses, wearing a wool
trench coat and wondering

when it's going to start
raining. As he leaves, he

shakes your hand cordially,
flicks you a custom-printed business card, and tells
you to be sure to get in touch when you decide
you're ready to rumble with the real (i.e. Boston
ian) big boys.
Typical quote: "After my interviews at Princeton,
Colombia, Harvard and Yale, it's so charmingly
quaint to visit your cute little farm."

The Party Animal: According to
Facebook, this profro's favorite
movies are Animal House,
Porky's and American Pie 2. ;
She came to The Farm to

enjoy her first real, alcoholic
boy-girl party — and no stupid "dry
weekend" policy is going to stop her!
The Party Animal waltzes in to drop

off her stuff on the Thursday of Admit
Weekend; the next time you see her is three days
later. She reeks of gin and strawberry soda. When
you ask where she's been sleeping, she mutters
something incoherent about Xanadu's laundry
room. Sketch.
Typical quote: "So, what does SAE stand for?"

Scaredv McStagcMom: Iliis
is the poor, cute little high
school senior who gets '
dragged around all week- *
end by his over-eager. pro-
Stanford parents. While they
take flyers and candy fro
every single booth at the activ
ities fair (including Campus
Girl Scouts and the Judo
Club), he sullenly text mes
sages his friends back hom

While his parents are forcing President Hennessy to
autograph a Nalgene, he is frantically trying to gnaw
off an arm through the custom-made Stanford polo
shirt his mommy dressed him in that morning. His
parents refuse to call him by anything but his Col
lege Confidential admissions forum screen name. In
reality, this kid doesn't even know which colleges he
has applied to — he is just waiting patiently to go
somewhere (anywhere!) more than 1(X) miles away
from home in the fall.
'typical quote: This kid's mother does all the talking
for him; it is currently unknown whether he is phys
ically able to speak.




Eager lleaver:This profro is so im
pressive that her

fifty-page re
sume is re
quired reading

for introducto
ry CS and
MS&E classes.

She maintained a
4.7 GPA. won na
tionals in debate.

initiated a gender
studies course at her

school, single-handedly
saved a family of fifteen after

Hurricane Katrina. and invented a
moving, speaking, artificial-intelli
gence-driven robot to play with blind
orphans whose parents died of AIDS
in Bolivia. Over the course of Admit
Weekend, she started a non-profit in
East Palo Alto and learned Norwe-

»ian. She was so busy interviewin
enured faculty members durin

Admit Weekend that she could only
sleep two hours a night — but she
managed to use that time to donate
plasma. Just looking at her makes you
want to take a nap.
Iypical quote:"Would it be possible to
pi ay a varsity sport, sing in an a cappel
la group and do a three year co
v term?"

Ideal Profro: Iliis Pro Fro
acknowledges that Admit
Weekend is a little dorky,
but the people are cool. I le

spends half of his time
checking out the libraries and
potential academic tracks, and

the other half grabbing Late Nite
with students and asking what

Stanford life is really like. I le knows
that there's no way to understand a
university in one weekend, but he
likes what he sees and is pretty psy
ched for the next four years.
Typical quote: "It was nice to meet
you, man. See you in the fall."
