# Softball makes it rain
## Card takes two of three, but skies, Washington too much 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
First the skies rained on the Cardinal. Then it
was Washington's turn.
Stanford picked up impressive wins over
UCLA (6-4) on Friday,and Washington (3-2) early
Sunday after a Saturday rain delay. But Washing
ton took Stanford to the whooping shed with a 12-
I thrashing Sunday afternoon, ruining an other
wise perfect weekend.
"We've been on the other side of a game like
that, where we scored a lot of runs," Coach John
Rittman said. "We know there are going to be
bumps in the road, but we're just trying to stay con
sistent. trying not to get too high and not too low."
No. 16 Stanford's (29-13,5-7 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) victory over No. 11 Washington (29-12,6-5)
was easily the weekend's most dramatic. Down 3-0,
Washington wrestled back the momentum with
two solo homers — Dena Tyson's in the top of the
fourth, and Ashley Charters' in the fifth.
But then sophomore righty Missy Penna re
gained control and finished what junior Becky Mc-
C'ullough started. The Huskies put two on in the
sixth and one on in the seventh, but never could
push the tying run across the plate.
The Cardinal had jumped to a 2-0 lead in the
third — off a single, an error, a hit batter and two
walks — before rain forced a premature end to
Saturday's festivities. When play picked back up
Sunday morning, freshman catcher Rosey Nciil
drew an illegal pitch from Washington's Caitlin
Noble to score freshman outfielder Alissa Maber.
That give Stanford all the offense it would need.
"We knew after the rain delay there was a lot of
game left." Rittman said."Becky pitched very well
Saturday, and then [Sunday], Missy pitched out of
some jams. Over the course ot the weekend, any
time you win two of three, that's huge."
Yesterday afternoon, though. Washington left
no doubt as to the outcome, shelling both Penna
and McCullough.The Huskies scored runs in each
of the game's six innings, while Washington ace
Danielle Lawrie shut Stanford's offense down.
The Huskies led 5-0 before Stanford scored its
sole run in the third, with a Haber groundout plat
ing junior infielder Tricia Aggabao. But Washing
ton responded with a vengeance, and a four-run
flurry in the sixth drew the contest to a merciful
close.
"They just got on a roll and kept putting runs on
the board," Rittman said."lt made it difficult offen
sively for us to try to do things against a very good
pitcher. I've seen us pitch better obviously, but that
was a bad game for all of us."
Stanford started the weekend on the right note
with a 6-4 upset of No. 12 UCI.A (2S-12. 4-5 Pac
-10) on the strength of some timely hitting.
Ibough the Cardinal failed to score after load
ing the bases in the first, the women managed a hit
in nearly every clutch situation thereafter. Junior
infielder Michelle Smith's two-RBI double high
lighted a four-run second, with Penna's RBI single
in the fifth and Haber's homer tocenter in the sixth
rounding out Stanford's scoring.
UCLA pulled to within 4-3 with four hits in a
three-run third, but Penna had the upper hand the
rest of the way in a complete-game victory. She did
allow an unearned run in t.ie seventh, but a foul fly

"1 was proud of way she battled through really
tough situations," Rittman said."Bases loaded, no
body out in the sixth, and she struck out three real
ly good hitters. Our offense gave her some run sup
port, which was definitely huge."
