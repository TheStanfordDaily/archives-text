CALIFORNIA COLLEGIATE
CHALLENGE
Berkeley, Calif.
The highlight on the women's side was
a first-through-fourth Stanford finish in
the 100 meters. Sophomore Alicia Follmar
took top honors (2:09.12), with redshirt
junior Arianna Lambie (2:09.95), junior
Lauren Centrowitz (2:10.36) and sopho
more Kaylin Pennington (2:11.73) follow
ing, respectively.
In the 3000-meter run, the Cardinal
women also swept the top three spots.
Sophomore Katie Harrington finished
first with a time of 9:48.81. with freshmen
Madeleine O'Meara and Kate Niehaus
close behind.
Among other strong finishes, senior
Jakki Bailey won the 100-meter dash with
a blistering 11.66 seconds, while junior
Erica McLain won the long jump with a
remarkable leap of 6.27 meters.
The throw was not as kind. Senior Kate
Elsbury placed 12th with a mark of 54.82
meters, and redshirt freshman Jaynie
Goodbody finished 13th.
Still. Coach Edrick Floreal was pleased
with the weekend.
"We had tons of good performances in
the competition," he said. "Jakki Bailey
did really well, along with many of the
other competitors."
The men's team also impressed. Red-
shirt junior Russell Brown and red
shirt sophomore Garrett Heath fin
ished one-two in the 800. Senior
Brett Gother won the 1500 with an
NCAA Regional-qualifying 3:44.54,
and redshirt sophomore Hari Mix
took the 5000 in 14:18.21.
As expected, senior Michael
Robertson did well in the warm
Southern California weather, win
nine the discus with a school-record

heave of 62.55.
"Windy weather â€” it helped
some of the throwers, not all of
them," Floreal said. "Michaei
Robertson had a huge performance.
It was a team-building and team-ori
ented trip, and this helped a lot of
players do well."
The Cardinal will compete at
home this Saturday in the Payton
Jordan Cardinal Invitational. The
Pac-10 Championships will also be
hosted by the Cardinal, May 5-6 and
Mav 12-13.
