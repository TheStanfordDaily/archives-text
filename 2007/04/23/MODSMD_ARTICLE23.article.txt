The Cardinal enters the tournament
fresh off a victory at the Peg Barnard
California Collegiate this past weekend.
Senior Lauren Todd, ranked No. 19
nationally by Golfweek magazine, paced
host Stanford with a five-under 137 for a
second-place individual finish. Freshman
Catherina Wang finished fourth with a
142, two strokes ahead of sophomore
Mari Chun, who tied for ninth. Senior Jen
nifer Tangtiphaiboontana, ranked 41st,
came in at 23rd (73-77—150), another
sub-par performance from one of the
team leaders.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal lineup ap
pears set for the postseason. Seniors Todd
and Tangtiphaiboontana are usually con
sistent players who have led Stanford
throughout the season. Chun has shown
flashes of brilliance, winning the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational earlier this season.
Todd currently leads the team with a
73.2 stroke average, with No. 29 Chun
following closely behind at 73.6.
Tangtiphaiboontana boasts seven top-25
finishes, edging out Todd and Chun's six
apiece.
While those three form the
team's nucleus, Wang's recent
strong play will likely earn her the
final spot in the lineup. Sophomore
ki-Shui Liao had occupied that slot
for most of the season, hut a weak
early spring opened the door for
Wang, who also placed 35th at the
PING ASU Invitational.
With four seniors — Todd.
Tangtiphaiboontana. Jenna Seki
and Saana Rapakko — and no jun
iors on the roster. Stanford knows
this is the year. Chun and Liao do
return next season, but asking them
to carry the team is a tall order.
In their eight tournaments this
season, the Cardinal women have
won twice and finished in the top
10 every time. Their first victory-of
the year came at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invite in Sammamish,
Wash., so Stanford is hoping that
another visit to the Evergreen
State will have the same results.
Still, the competition is fierce as
No. 1 Arizona State. No. 6 Southern
California. No. II UCLA and Np.
15 Arizona all could easily walk
away with the crown. The dark
horses are No. 45 Washington
State. No. 50 Oregon, No. 55 Cali
fornia. No. 59 Oregon State and
No. 60 Washington.
Last season. UCLA took its
third straight Pac-10 Champi
onship with a 15-over 879. inching
out Arizona State (880). Stanford
finished seventh of the ten teams
with a 912 as Chun finished 11th
with a 222. Tangtiphaiboontana
placed 15th with a 226. Todd took
33rd with a 232 and then-senior
Kelly Husted and Liao tied for 34th
with 235.
Though the Pac-10 Champi
onships are today's focus, a brighter
beacon looms on the horizon — the
NCAA Championships. Anything
can happen there: Four Pac-10
teams placed in the top 10 last year,
but Pac-10 champion UCLA only
managed 11th.
Today, though, Stanford will tee
off with the defending champion
Bruins at 9:40 a.m.
