The Cardinal enters the tournament
fresh off a victory at the Peg Barnard
California Collegiate this past weekend.
Senior Lauren Todd, ranked No. 19
nationally by Golfweek magazine, paced
host Stanford with a five-under 137 for a
second-place individual finish. Freshman
Catherina Wang finished fourth with a
142, two strokes ahead of sophomore
Mari Chun, who tied for ninth. Senior Jen
nifer Tangtiphaiboontana, ranked 41st,
came in at 23rd (73-77—150), another
sub-par performance from one of the
team leaders.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal lineup ap
pears set for the postseason. Seniors Todd
and Tangtiphaiboontana are usually con
sistent players who have led Stanford
throughout the season. Chun has shown
flashes of brilliance, winning the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational earlier this season.
Todd currently leads the team with a
73.2 stroke average, with No. 29 Chun
following closely behind at 73.6.
Tangtiphaiboontana boasts seven top-25
finishes, edging out Todd and Chun's six
apiece.
