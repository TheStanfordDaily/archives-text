## KENNEY WILL STAY 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Skip Kenncy will keep his job. Athletic
Director Bob Bowlsby announced on Fri
day. But first, the head men's swimming
coach must complete a 60-day suspension
for deleting swimmers' records. Bowlsby
also said the 28-year coach committed no
NCAA violations.
Kenney's tampering with five swimmers'
times and All-Academic records first came
to light in a Mar. 9 Daily article ("Coach
deletes stats"). After initially denying the al
legations that he purposely removed specif
ic swimmers' records from official media
guides in an interview with The Daily, the
64-year-old coach reversed his story the
same day and soon admitted the transgres
sion. Bowlsby placed him on indefinite sus
pension the same day and promised an in
vestigation.
Friday's announcement marked the con
clusion of that investigation, and the start of
Kenney's two-month suspension without

pay. In assessing Kenney's actions, Bowlsby
said the 18-time Pacific-10 Conference
Coach of the Year showed a "serious lack of
judgment."
"1 had no right to omit the records of any
athlete on media guides or other publica
tions," Kenney said. "This will not occur
again."
Some, however, were not willing to for
give Kenney for his actions — or the Uni
versity for its subsequent handling of the sit
uation.
"I know in the bottom of my heart that
it's not fair, but there's nothing we can do
about it." said a former swimmer who was
previously granted anonymity by Fhe Daily
because of the issue's sensitivity. "I think
Stanford has a double standard for its facul
ty. It's just disappointing that justice was not
served."
Mike McLean, father of Michael
McLean '06 — one of the five swimmers
whose records were removed — said he
found the University's decision "disap
pointing" in light of his son's experience.

Several current members of the men's
swimming team, however, reacted to Fri
day's decision with relief.
"I'm excited to know I'm going to be
coached again in the future by Skip," said
senior captain Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who
added that Bowlsby's decision to suspend
Kenney was a "tough judgment call."
Wildman-Tobriner, who was recently
named the Pac-10 Swimmer of the Year and
won two gold medals at the FINA World
Championships in March, said that Ken
ney's absence from March's NCAA Cham
pionships — where the Cardinal placed sec
ond — represented "the three most critical
days of the year for any swimmer."
Senior Shaun Phillips was also "glad to
have | Kennev] back," though the coach will
not return until June 20. In the meantime, as
at the NCAA Championships and in the
past few weeks, assistant coach Ted Knapp
will stand in for Kenney as the team goes
through spring training.
