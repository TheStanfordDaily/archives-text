# SLAC claims victory as hunger strike ends
## Columnist delves into fasters' motivations, experiences 
### RUTH MCCANN DAILY COLUMNIST 
When I visited SLAC's makeshift camp in White Plaza
early on Friday afternoon, the Fast for a Living Wage had
been going strong for nine days, and several of the partici
pants 1 met said they would fast "for as long as it takes/'They
were also cautiously optimistic about the meeting between
SLAC organizers and President John I lennessy that was
scheduled for later that afternoon.
That meeting, however, went far better for SLAC than
the previous three that week, and shortly before dusk, the
fasters ended their hunger strike.
The fast was broken with a few tentative mouthfuls of
banana, followed by toast, applesauce and rice.
Joseles De La Cruz,'o7, who fasted for nine days, said he
only ate grudgingly."! only ate because I needed to," Joseles
told me via email. "I wasn't hungry and 1 had a hard time
grasping the concept of chewing food."
Joseles was one of the participants who initiated the fast
on the evening of Apr. 12. The group prepared for sever
al days beforehand, whittling down their diet to include
only fruits, vegetables, soups and juices. They were assist
ed by a hunger strike consultant, whom SLAC organizers
met with while planning the fast. During the nine days.

sity to extend Stanford's living wage policy. Fasters celebrated above by snacking on bananas, toast, applesauce and rice.
the participants' numbers reached a
peak of 12 before shrinking to eight.
ITiree participants hat! to stop fasting
early for medical reasons, and one was
unable to get more time off from her
job.
When I visited the camp on the af
ternoon of Day Nine, the place was
largely deserted. SLAC spokesman
Matt Seriff-Cullick '08 was sitting on
the ground playing acoustic guitar
while an older man with a graying
ponytail sat nearby drinking coffee.
Hie cluster of nine tents, nestled under

a group of trees in the corner of White
Plaza, was littered with Nalgenes and
Smart Water bottles. There was, of
course, no food. Three white banners
hung from the branches of the trees,
proclaiming in English and in Spanish
that the fast had reached Day Nine.
Matt, who played his guitar next to
a table laden with SLAC info, wel
comed me into the camp in the same
sort of hushed tones that nurses use to
welcome visitors into a hospital ward.
Except, in this case, the patients
weren't there.The tents were empty —
the fasters were at Vaden. They had
gone for bkxxl and heart rate tests.
Vaden had treated them all,despite the
fact that some weren't students.
As I waited for the fasters. Matt told
me about their progress. "They defi

nitely have a lot less energy, and they all
look thinner" he said gravely. "But
they've been holding up pretty well
they've been doing better than 1 ex
pected."
I was nervous for the tasters to re
turn. afraid that they might resent me
for having eaten both breakfast and
lunch that day.and still more afraid that
1 wouldn't be able to look at them, let
alone talk to them. What would it be
like to see people not just hungry but
starving?
Four tasters returned to the camp
shortly after 1 arrived. There was. re
markably. no apparent difference be
tween them and myself, except that
they moved painfully slowly. The first
person I spoke to was Joseles.
We talked together under a cater
pillar-laden tree amid a clutter of water
bottles and books, including a Noam
C homsky volume. Wearing red track
pants and a puffy blue jacket. Joseles
sat next to me, rolling a water bottle be
tween his hands as he talked.
"I've noticed that I'm not as coher
ent as I used to he,"he said, "but other
than that it's been fine. I'm only nau
seous when 1 move." Although he
spoke slowly and with obvious effort,
Joseles was lucid throughout the inter
view and told me about his own experi
ences with issues of labor justice. He
told me that his mother, a former jani
tor. was supportive of the fast because
"she grew up without healthcare, and 1
grew up without healthcare, and she
knows what it's like to make those
wages, and she's proud of me. She's
scared, but she's more upset at I len
nessy."
Joseles told me that his mother had
received a letter from I lennessy in
forming her that her son was fasting.
The letter, in which her name was mis
spelled and she was inaccurately called
his stepmother, caused more anger
than anything else.
A member of SLAC since his fresh
man year. Joseles said that he was
thankful for the high morale among
the fasters and SLAC organizers. Al
though he he fasted for all nine days
and lost 19 pounds, Joseles nonetheless
took part in the SLAC rallies and sat in
on all the meetings with I lennessy. He
was optimistic about the group's
chances for successful negotiation, but
his estimate for how long he could keep
going was slim.
Joseles was also enthusiastic about
the encouragement the group had
been receiving from the Stanford com
munity. "1 get really excited about the
support we're getting," he said.
I next visited graduate student Dan
Weissman, who was huddled alone in
his tent, wearing fingerless black
gloves,a hat and an Illinois sweatshirt. 1
asked for an interview, and he looked
tentatively toward the place some 15
feet away where I 'd been interviewing
other fasters.
"Do you mind if we stay here?" he
asked.grimacing with obvious effort as
he uncapped a bottle of Smart Water. I
said I didn't mind, and a SLAC organ
izer cleared off a canvas camp chair for
me at the opening to Dan's tent,
"I feel really tired." Dan warned me
as we began the interview, "and it's
kind of hard to focus and sometimes to
remember things."
At Dan's Vaden visit, he had been

told that his pulse was good, although
he was still waiting for blood test re
sults. He had ingested nothing but
water and a single vitamin since Day
One of the fast. He estimated that he
had been drinking between three and
four liters of water daily. Nine days ear
lier. Dan weighed 175 pounds, but
when 1 saw him. he was barely at 155.
"I've avoided looking at myself in
the mirror." Dan told me."l did it once,
and I looked like 1 was starving, which
1 am."
1 asked where Dan was showering,
and he sheepishly admitted that he
hadn't lately. He told me that he and
the other tasters had been using the
bathrooms in the Bookstore and in
Meyer Library, but that he hadn't
needed to shave in a while. He stopped
to finger his modest beard and told me
that, by his estimation, it had stopped
growing on Day Three. I asked Dan
how much longer he thought he could
keep going.
"1 feel good," Dan told me. "I feel
like I can keep going for as long as it
takes. More to the point, I'm willing to
keep going after I stop feeling good."
Unlike other fasters, Dan didn't ex
perience severe hunger pangs during
the first few days. He told me that his
two main problems had been exhaus
tion and the cold. Even during the mid
dle of the day. Dan was clothed in his
sweatshirt and nestled in a sleeping
bag. I couldn't imagine what the nights

were like,especially in such flimsy tents
(Joseles had told me that the fasters
huddled together in the tents at night
for warmth). Dan reflected that it was
worth it to spend the cold nights in the
camp, given the camaraderie that was
present among the fasters.
Dan said that the high spirits were a
primary part of what was keeping him
going.The group was all together in the
camp most nights, and they had
watched movies on a projector and
sung karaoke a few nights before. Dan
was also glad of the visibility the camp
afforded to those passing by. Dan said
that all sorts of people had approached
the fasters with encouragement. He re
counted an incident in which he awoke
at 4 a.m. to see a security guard stand
ing nearby. Anxious, Dan asked the
guard what was going on, and he told
Dan that he had been waiting for one
of the fasters to wake up so he could tell
them how appreciative he was of their
fasting.
Along with the students, two ABM
janitors joined the fast, although only
one, Ernesto Garcia, was able to re
main until Day Nine. Ernesto, a part
time ABM janitor and a student at
Canada College in Redwood City, had
been fasting for six days when 1 spoke
with him. Like Dan and Joseles,
Ernesto had been attending SLAC ral
lies during his fast. With regard to his
motivation to join the fast, Ernesto said
that he was doing it on behalf of the

Stanford workers.
"I'm humbled by what the students
are doing" he told me."but I came here
to represent the workers, because lots
of them couldn't get time off." Two of
Ernesto's fellow workers had tried to
join the fast but weren't given the vaca
tion time.
Ernesto, who hadn't prepared for
the fast, said that the results of his
Vaden visit weren't encouraging. Tm
not doing that well," he said. "My pulse
is getting low.The doctor said one more
day,max. But 1 feel okay I feel fine." His
father, who is active in the union at
Stanford, had called that morning, ex
pressing concern for Ernesto's health.
Ernesto, however, was optimistic that
his fast wouldn't go on much longer.
He was right.
SLAC participated in a total of four
meetings during the fast, three of which
were with President Hennessy. At the
final meeting, Hennessy agreed to
broaden the University's living wage
policy and removed several conditions
that had previously prevented what
SLAC estimates to be hundreds of
workers from enjoying University ben
efits.
The post-meeting snack was a wel
come treat for the fasters. As Dan told
me,"That first banana was the most de
licious thing I've ever had."

been going strong for nine days, and several of the partici
pants 1 met said they would fast "for as long as it takes/'They
were also cautiously optimistic about the meeting between
SLAC organizers and President John I lennessy that was
scheduled for later that afternoon.
That meeting, however, went far better for SLAC than
the previous three that week, and shortly before dusk, the
fasters ended their hunger strike.
The fast was broken with a few tentative mouthfuls of
banana, followed by toast, applesauce and rice.
Joseles De La Cruz,'o7, who fasted for nine days, said he
only ate grudgingly."! only ate because I needed to," Joseles
told me via email. "I wasn't hungry and 1 had a hard time
grasping the concept of chewing food."
Joseles was one of the participants who initiated the fast
on the evening of Apr. 12. The group prepared for sever
al days beforehand, whittling down their diet to include
only fruits, vegetables, soups and juices. They were assist
ed by a hunger strike consultant, whom SLAC organizers
met with while planning the fast. During the nine days.

The eight remaining fasters ended their hunger strike on Friday afternoon after SLAC successfully negotiated with the Univer
sity to extend Stanford's living wage policy. Fasters celebrated above by snacking on bananas, toast, applesauce and rice.
the participants' numbers reached a
peak of 12 before shrinking to eight.
ITiree participants hat! to stop fasting
early for medical reasons, and one was
unable to get more time off from her
job.
When I visited the camp on the af
ternoon of Day Nine, the place was
largely deserted. SLAC spokesman
Matt Seriff-Cullick '08 was sitting on
the ground playing acoustic guitar
while an older man with a graying
ponytail sat nearby drinking coffee.
Hie cluster of nine tents, nestled under

a group of trees in the corner of White
Plaza, was littered with Nalgenes and
Smart Water bottles. There was, of
course, no food. Three white banners
hung from the branches of the trees,
proclaiming in English and in Spanish
that the fast had reached Day Nine.
Matt, who played his guitar next to
a table laden with SLAC info, wel
comed me into the camp in the same
sort of hushed tones that nurses use to
welcome visitors into a hospital ward.
Except, in this case, the patients
weren't there.The tents were empty —
the fasters were at Vaden. They had
gone for bkxxl and heart rate tests.
Vaden had treated them all,despite the
fact that some weren't students.
As I waited for the fasters. Matt told
me about their progress. "They defi

nitely have a lot less energy, and they all
look thinner" he said gravely. "But
they've been holding up pretty well
they've been doing better than 1 ex
pected."
I was nervous for the tasters to re
turn. afraid that they might resent me
for having eaten both breakfast and
lunch that day.and still more afraid that
1 wouldn't be able to look at them, let
alone talk to them. What would it be
like to see people not just hungry but
starving?
Four tasters returned to the camp
shortly after 1 arrived. There was. re
markably. no apparent difference be
tween them and myself, except that
they moved painfully slowly. The first
person I spoke to was Joseles.
We talked together under a cater
pillar-laden tree amid a clutter of water
bottles and books, including a Noam
C homsky volume. Wearing red track
pants and a puffy blue jacket. Joseles
sat next to me, rolling a water bottle be
tween his hands as he talked.
"I've noticed that I'm not as coher
ent as I used to he,"he said, "but other
than that it's been fine. I'm only nau
seous when 1 move." Although he
spoke slowly and with obvious effort,
Joseles was lucid throughout the inter
view and told me about his own experi
ences with issues of labor justice. He
told me that his mother, a former jani
tor. was supportive of the fast because
"she grew up without healthcare, and 1
grew up without healthcare, and she
knows what it's like to make those
wages, and she's proud of me. She's
scared, but she's more upset at I len
nessy."
Joseles told me that his mother had
received a letter from I lennessy in
forming her that her son was fasting.
The letter, in which her name was mis
spelled and she was inaccurately called
his stepmother, caused more anger
than anything else.
A member of SLAC since his fresh
man year. Joseles said that he was
thankful for the high morale among
the fasters and SLAC organizers. Al
though he he fasted for all nine days
and lost 19 pounds, Joseles nonetheless
took part in the SLAC rallies and sat in
on all the meetings with I lennessy. He
was optimistic about the group's
chances for successful negotiation, but
his estimate for how long he could keep
going was slim.
Joseles was also enthusiastic about
the encouragement the group had
been receiving from the Stanford com
munity. "1 get really excited about the
support we're getting," he said.
I next visited graduate student Dan
Weissman, who was huddled alone in
his tent, wearing fingerless black
gloves,a hat and an Illinois sweatshirt. 1
asked for an interview, and he looked
tentatively toward the place some 15
feet away where I 'd been interviewing
other fasters.
"Do you mind if we stay here?" he
asked.grimacing with obvious effort as
he uncapped a bottle of Smart Water. I
said I didn't mind, and a SLAC organ
izer cleared off a canvas camp chair for
me at the opening to Dan's tent,
"I feel really tired." Dan warned me
as we began the interview, "and it's
kind of hard to focus and sometimes to
remember things."
At Dan's Vaden visit, he had been

told that his pulse was good, although
he was still waiting for blood test re
sults. He had ingested nothing but
water and a single vitamin since Day
One of the fast. He estimated that he
had been drinking between three and
four liters of water daily. Nine days ear
lier. Dan weighed 175 pounds, but
when 1 saw him. he was barely at 155.
"I've avoided looking at myself in
the mirror." Dan told me."l did it once,
and I looked like 1 was starving, which
1 am."
1 asked where Dan was showering,
and he sheepishly admitted that he
hadn't lately. He told me that he and
the other tasters had been using the
bathrooms in the Bookstore and in
Meyer Library, but that he hadn't
needed to shave in a while. He stopped
to finger his modest beard and told me
that, by his estimation, it had stopped
growing on Day Three. I asked Dan
how much longer he thought he could
keep going.
"1 feel good," Dan told me. "I feel
like I can keep going for as long as it
takes. More to the point, I'm willing to
keep going after I stop feeling good."
Unlike other fasters, Dan didn't ex
perience severe hunger pangs during
the first few days. He told me that his
two main problems had been exhaus
tion and the cold. Even during the mid
dle of the day. Dan was clothed in his
sweatshirt and nestled in a sleeping
bag. I couldn't imagine what the nights

were like,especially in such flimsy tents
(Joseles had told me that the fasters
huddled together in the tents at night
for warmth). Dan reflected that it was
worth it to spend the cold nights in the
camp, given the camaraderie that was
present among the fasters.
Dan said that the high spirits were a
primary part of what was keeping him
going.The group was all together in the
camp most nights, and they had
watched movies on a projector and
sung karaoke a few nights before. Dan
was also glad of the visibility the camp
afforded to those passing by. Dan said
that all sorts of people had approached
the fasters with encouragement. He re
counted an incident in which he awoke
at 4 a.m. to see a security guard stand
ing nearby. Anxious, Dan asked the
guard what was going on, and he told
Dan that he had been waiting for one
of the fasters to wake up so he could tell
them how appreciative he was of their
fasting.
Along with the students, two ABM
janitors joined the fast, although only
one, Ernesto Garcia, was able to re
main until Day Nine. Ernesto, a part
time ABM janitor and a student at
Canada College in Redwood City, had
been fasting for six days when 1 spoke
with him. Like Dan and Joseles,
Ernesto had been attending SLAC ral
lies during his fast. With regard to his
motivation to join the fast, Ernesto said
that he was doing it on behalf of the

Stanford workers.
"I'm humbled by what the students
are doing" he told me."but I came here
to represent the workers, because lots
of them couldn't get time off." Two of
Ernesto's fellow workers had tried to
join the fast but weren't given the vaca
tion time.
Ernesto, who hadn't prepared for
the fast, said that the results of his
Vaden visit weren't encouraging. Tm
not doing that well," he said. "My pulse
is getting low.The doctor said one more
day,max. But 1 feel okay I feel fine." His
father, who is active in the union at
Stanford, had called that morning, ex
pressing concern for Ernesto's health.
Ernesto, however, was optimistic that
his fast wouldn't go on much longer.
He was right.
SLAC participated in a total of four
meetings during the fast, three of which
were with President Hennessy. At the
final meeting, Hennessy agreed to
broaden the University's living wage
policy and removed several conditions
that had previously prevented what
SLAC estimates to be hundreds of
workers from enjoying University ben
efits.
The post-meeting snack was a wel
come treat for the fasters. As Dan told
me,"That first banana was the most de
licious thing I've ever had."
