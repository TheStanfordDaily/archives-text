When I visited SLAC's makeshift camp in White Plaza
early on Friday afternoon, the Fast for a Living Wage had
been going strong for nine days, and several of the partici
pants 1 met said they would fast "for as long as it takes/'They
were also cautiously optimistic about the meeting between
SLAC organizers and President John I lennessy that was
scheduled for later that afternoon.
That meeting, however, went far better for SLAC than
the previous three that week, and shortly before dusk, the
fasters ended their hunger strike.
The fast was broken with a few tentative mouthfuls of
banana, followed by toast, applesauce and rice.
Joseles De La Cruz,'o7, who fasted for nine days, said he
only ate grudgingly."! only ate because I needed to," Joseles
told me via email. "I wasn't hungry and 1 had a hard time
grasping the concept of chewing food."
Joseles was one of the participants who initiated the fast
on the evening of Apr. 12. The group prepared for sever
al days beforehand, whittling down their diet to include
only fruits, vegetables, soups and juices. They were assist
ed by a hunger strike consultant, whom SLAC organizers
met with while planning the fast. During the nine days.
