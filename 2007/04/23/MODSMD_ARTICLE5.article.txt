After nine days and dozens of
missed meals, the eight remaining par
ticipants of the hunger strike organized
by the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) broke fast after the stu
dent group reached an agreement with
the University Friday afternoon re
garding Stanford's living wage policy.
In his third personal meeting with
student representatives, President
John Hennessy agreed to make multi
ple changes to the existing policy, with
the effect of broadening the number of
contracted workers who earn a wage
minimum of $11.15 an hour with bene
fits, or $ 12.59 without benefits.
The agreement reached on Friday
will expand the living wage to apply to
workers without regard for the dura
tion of their contracts, the number of
hours they work or the duration of time
they are employed.
It does not, however, extend the liv
ing wage policy to cover two of the
groups excluded by restrictions specifi
cally targeted by the SLAC campaign:
workers in unions and workers em
ployed under aggregate contracts less
than $1(K),(KK) in value. Iliis group in
cludes workers employed by ARM Jan
itors such as Ernesto Garcia, who was

one of the fasters.
ITie amount of additional workers,
who might be covered by the agree
ment is still unclear.The University has
yet to release an estimate, but SLAC
spokesperson Matt Seriff-Cullick '08
said that, while he did not want to spec
ulate, the number might be "in the hun
dreds."
Both parties celebrated the com
promise. University officials talked up
the importance of the meetings, while
SLAC activists emphasized the bar
gaining power generated by the fast.
"1 think this shows that when people
sit around a table and discuss issues
that are important, they can reach
some compromise," said University
spokesperson Alan Acosta."lt may not
be the absolute everything that either
side wanted, but it shows that when you
sit down and discuss issues that are im
portant. you can reach some resolu
tions and improve them."
Seriff-Cullick '08 offered a different
assessment. "Most of what matters is
not what goes on in the negotiating
room, it's what goes on outside," he
said.
Although SLAC members down
played the role played by negotiation,
the group's current stance represents a
softened version of earlier positions
made regarding the goals of the fast.
"The problem is in the disjunction
[that exists] between the business side
of the institution and its function as a
social actor," Seriff-Cullick said on
Monday of the difficulties SLAC faced
in getting the University to drop the
collective bargaining restriction, which
bars union-represented workers from

the living wage policy. "There's a very
standard business mentality that pre
vails."
But by this weekend, he had
changed his tone, saying that negotia
tions had helped and that SLAC "got
the most headway when we could point
out contradictions between the spirit of
the policy and its applications."
"No matter what their mentality,
they need to be internally consistent,"
he said.
In an email to SLAC members sent
out on Friday, Seriff-Cullick asserted
that the new "preferred-contractors"
list would likely assist ABM Janitors in
their next contract negotiations, how
ever.
Policies governing compensation
for subcontracted workers can vary by
contractor, and in many cases, they can
be the product of a collective agree
ment between unionized workers and
their employer. Instead of requiring
that all contracted workers be paid a
living wage by their employer, the Uni
versity's preferred list aims only to pro
vide an encouragement for contractors
to meet that standard.
"That way," Acosta said, "we are
able to have a broader application of
the policy."
SLAC spokesperson Shamala Gal
lagher '07 expressed some dissatisfac
tion with the University's insistence on
a "preferred-contractors" list.
"Everyone's happy with the way
things turned out," she said. "But
there's still that one restriction that
