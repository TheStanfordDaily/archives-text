### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 1.4(H) red-folder-toting, name-tag-wearing
high school seniors flooded campus for this year's
version of Admit Weekend. Hie prospective fresh
man — or ProFros — were treated to a series of ac
tivities designed to persuade them to attend Stanford,
and despite scattered showers, both organizers and
participants deemed the weekend a success.
"We're trying to take the image they have of Stan
ford and really deliver that on a personal level," said
Dean of Freshman and Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims '89. "They seem to be lovely people and
look really engaged and excited about Stanford."
Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw toldThe Daily
that almost 1,400 students and <X(X) parents visited the
University over the weekend — a number that
eclipsed last year's total.
The new class of "Oh-leven," as termed by I.yth
cott-Haims, filled Memorial Auditorium for Provost
John Etchemendy's welcome address Thursday af
ternoon.
Lythcott-1 laims made bold predictions about this
year's yield rate — which Dean Shaw
estimated would be around 67 percent
— saying that about SO percent of ad
mits she had spoken with said they
were committed to attending Stanford.
Admit Weekend also featured an
increased level of programming, some
of which was geared at parents, ac
cording to Associate Director of Ad
mission and Financial Aid Christina
Wire.
"This year we also worked very col
laboratively with the city of Palo Alto
to put together an evening program
for parents to introduce them to the
city of Palo Alto and Stanford Shop
ping Center," Wire said.
Despite scattered rain showers,
which threatened to disrupt some
Admit Weekend traditions like mid
night fountain hopping, student or
ganizers said the weekend was a suc
cess.
"Admit Weekend was amazing!"
said Lia BonamassaTO,a House Host
(1 10l lo) in Otero. "It was a little tough
because of the rain, but the actual pro
gramming went well. I've dime ab
solutely no work since Thursday, but it
was definitely worth it."
Some students interviewed bvThe

Daily also said the University's cam
pus-wide "dry weekend" policy was
not an issue.
"We personally didn't have any
problems, and I think that held true in
most places," Bonamassa said. "Our
biggest in-dorm concern was making
sure that alcohol was never present,
but my dormmates respected that
rule."
ProFros also said the weekend was
enjoyable and informative.
"it's really good to get a view of the
college life." said Daniel Swartz. a
Pro Fro from Sacramento. "It's going
to be hard to go back to high school
now for three more months. We're
ready to stay here."
Julian Gropp, and admit from
Bavaria,Germany,said he enjoyed the
weekend. Gropp. who said he was de
ciding between Columbia. Duke and
Stanford, said that "this event had a
big role in my decision" and that he
had decided to attend Stanford.
The University received a record
23.954 applications for the class of
2011. admitting 2,465 students for an
acceptance rate of 10.29 percent, also a
record. The admit pool comprises stu
dents from all 50 states and 59 coun
tries. Students will have until May 1 to
decide whether or not to accept Stan
ford's offer.
