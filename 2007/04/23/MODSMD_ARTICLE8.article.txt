## Fashion Philosophical Fashion: A Colorful Manifesto 
### NICOLE DEMBY INTERMISSION GLOWSTICK 
When I was at a concert in Berkeley recently, I had
to blink twice to make sure I wasn't in an American
Apparel ad. The boy to my left was wearing a pair of
big red wire glasses frames with no lenses OVER a pair
of thick-rimmed glasses! The lead singer of the band, a
mightily attractive Frenchman, was wearing nothing

but gold metallic leggings and a winning smile. A
tall, waifish girl wore a large neon yellow t-shirt that

would give those Hollo shirts a run tor the
money.The lead-singer of the opening act was an
emo sineer-sonewriter so in touch with his

inner child that he had scrawled hearts and
flowers over his arms and neck in colorful

washable marker. Streaks of blue and pink
poked out of asymetrical haircuts. Every
one had a can of PBR in hand and a pack of
American Spirits in pocket.

As is inevitable when any youth subcul
ture grows so large that it becomes visible to
people above the age of thirty, The Observer,
The New York Times, and New York Magazine
have all documented the arrival of new-rave or
nu-wave. a music/fashion/nartv trend that oriei-

cities. Wikipedia. a surprisingly reliable source of

style of music fusing elements of electronic, disco
music and punk which developed in the UK in
2006, It has similarities with US-led style dance-

of the scene often dress in bright colours." But, perhaps
Jet Storm, the lead singer of London-based band Trash
Fashion, described the aforementioned aesthetic most
succinctly when he said in a short documentary

about the hand."lf you can get up in the morning,
look at yourself in the mirror, and say I'm an
idiot,' that's new-rave."

Whether consciously or unconsciously, those
hip kids I saw at Berkeley had certainly started

to embrace elements of this trend, maybe
mixing it up with an East Bay tinge with
their fifty dollar T-shirts and collector

sneakers. But coming back to Stanford, I
couldn't help but wonder why the Stanford
bubble is impervious to trends that seem to

pervade many other California college cam
puses so quickly. Sometimes, on lonely nights, I
find myself longing to be back with my bi-bifo
caled friend and his candy-striped companions.

I'm not advocating that we all become trend
whores and go sell our souls to Urban Outfitters.

My friend at Berkeley describes classmates who
just sit around looking cool all day like it's their job.

In contrast to these people, there is something al
most refreshing about Stanford's indifference to
hipster fashion. People here are, for the most part.

genuinely unattected and unpretentious. And yet.
there's something telling about the fact that we (with
the exception, perhaps, of the Stanford Band) eschew
elements of irony or absurdity in our clothing. The

new-rave trend embodies a certain liberating playful
ness, and people's embrace of it shows a penchant for
the experimental, and even the ridiculous. The rave
style party involves a masquerade of outlandish fashion
and serious dancing to the psychadelic dance-pop of
bands like the Klaxons. It is an exercise in creating an
alternative universe, one of totally arbitrary rules and a
fair dose of self-mockery.
Of course, people inevitably take themselves too se
riously on both ends of the spectrum. The aforemen
tioned professional cool kids have sucked all the play
fulness out of fashion by forgetting about its arbitrari
ness and using it as a mechanism of social stratification
and intimidation. On the other hand, many people at

Stanford refuse to step out of the pages of Seventeen
Magazine because they think something a hit more
daring would disrupt the order of their lives. As one
brave Stanford fashion soul once related to me, some
girl she had been chatting with at a party innocently
expressed her admiration that my friend could "dress
like that and still be successful."
If we could only maintain our unpretentiousness but
expand ourselves enough to harness the sheer and ab
surd fun of some of the trends that kids come up with
these days, then we could have the best of both worlds.
Stanford needs more bright colors. We need to sharpen
our glowsticks. pop the yuppie bubble and replace it
with something a little more outlandish.
