## Take yourself out to a ball game 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION BASEBALL FAN 
In 1908, Jack Norworth said "take me out to the
ball game" on a subway train and his words burned
into the national consciousness. Half a century
later, in 1955, sportscaster Ernie Harwell charac
terized baseball as a symbol of "the American spir
it." In last year's Gallup poll, however, only 37 per
cent of Americans identified themselves as being
"fans" of the sport, representing one of the smallest
fan bases Gallup has measured since 1993.
What if we're missing out? What if baseball is
everything the black-and-white movies promise: a
time of family, sun-soaked bleachers, and choles
terol-laden, over-priced hot dogs? My friends and
I ventured to see the San Francisco Giants play
against the Arizona Diamondbacks (a longtime
Giants rival) in order to recapture the magic of
America's golden pastime.
Pulling off of 280 North in southern San Fran
cisco. the brown and green of the Santa Cruz
Mountains transitioning to the orange and black
of the Giants fans streaming towards AT&T stadi
um on the sidewalks of Mariposa Street. My friend
and I join the flow, collect our tickets from a
streamlined Will Call line and make our way up
two consecutive escalators to the view level.

Immediately, AT&T Stadium strikes us as a
well-oiled enterprise. The traditional stand selling
hot-dogs crowned with relish and mustard appears
in abundance, but so do stands selling garlic fries,
clam chowder and even Safeway prepackaged
sandwiches. For $8 you can purchase an ice cream,
although the plummeting temperatures make the
clam chowder far more appetizing.
After circling the outer ring for a few moments,
searching for our "view restricted seats." we walk
through a brief tunnel and enter the stadium inte
rior. Our seats, though relatively remote,provide us
with a sweeping view of not only the unnaturally
jade colored field but also of McCovey Cove, the
Bay Bridge and the marina. Beyond a giant.Bo-foot
sculpture of an overturned Coca-Cola bottle (with
playground slides underneath for children), we can
see sailboats and docked freightliners. When a pop
fly soars too high, there's a risk of confusing its
white blur with the underbelly of a passing seagull.
I feel as though we've stepped into an electric fu
sion of ballpark, theme park and oceanic postcard.
Of course, AT&T Park is relatively cutting-edge,
even outside of the ballpark community. It is dis
tinctive as the first privately financed ballpark in
Major League Baseball since 1%2. It's a "classic
urban ballpark with an old-time feel" conceived,
built and paid for by baseball fan Peter Magowan. It

opened in 2000.although the seven years have bare
ly touched it: walking to my seat last night, 1 could
have believed it was the night of the grand opening.
The Giants' game against the Diamondbacks un
folded with the characteristic drawn-out tempo fans
have grown to count on. In between plays, my friend
and I were able to talk to one another without
yelling, and if our attention strayed from the field for
too long, we could rejoin the game with only a glance
at the detailed scoreboard. While some fans yelled,
pounded their chests, stripped off their shirts and
jumped to their feet with each Giant's swing at the
plate, the stands were overwhelmingly serene. The
only (repeated) exceptions were the vendors —
with everything from churros to seeds to coffee —
who stood inches from our seats, hawking their
product a minimum of ten times before moving on.
While I don't know if the San Francisco Giants
symbolize the American spirit, it's clear that their in
dustry— as well as the Major League Baseball in
dustry that encompasses them — continues to cap
tivate its faction of fans. Their games are multi
faceted (where else can you slide out of a Coca-Cola
bottle?), and 1 can easily see why parents prefer to
bring their children to this sporting event as opposed
to rowdier alternatives. And for those of you among
the readers who would fall into the 37 percent of
American baseball fans, the Giants won, 4-2.
