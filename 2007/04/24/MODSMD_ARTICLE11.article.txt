The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation an
nounced yesterday that it has abandoned its plans to
build the Reagan Library at Stanford and will search
for a new location in Southern California.
The announcement came in the wake of increasing
faculty opposition to the library Faculty members that
the facility posed a threat to academic freedom by
linking Stanford with Reagan conservatism. The fac
ulty's opposition was spurred largely by a recent state
ment of Hoover Institution Director W.Glenn Camp
bell, who wrote in the 1986 I loover annual report that
the addition of the Reagan I .ibrary gave Stanford rea
son to "boast" of a "Reagan connection."
The foundation did not mention faculty opposi
tion in its terse statement yesterday, but said only that
it sought a location where a Reagan public affairs
center could be built adjacent to the library. "It is re
grettable that this could not be accomplished at Stan
ford University, the statement said.
