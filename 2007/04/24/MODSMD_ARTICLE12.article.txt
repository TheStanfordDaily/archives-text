## Boris Yeltsin, first Russian president, dead at 76 Democrat's actions helped bring down Soviet Union 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Boris Yeltsin, who kicked
the props < >ut from under the tottering Soviet
empire and then struggled to build a nation
from its wreckage, died Monday after seeing
many of his democratic reforms rolled hack.
The former Russian president was 76.
Larger than life during his tenure,
Yeltsin shrank from public view following
his retirement on New Year's Eve 1999,
and in recent years has rarely given inter
views. But the big. bumptious politician
with the soft pink features and wave of
white hair could be seen again Monday in
file footage on Russian television.
President Vladimir Putin spoke to the
nation some four hours after the an
nouncement of Yeltsin's death, which the
Kremlin said was due to heart failure.
Putin briefly praised Russia's first freely
elected president as a man "thanks to
whom a whole new epoch has started."
"New democratic Russia was born, a free
state open to the world;a state in which power
truly belongs to the people," Putin said.
Yeltsin will be buried Wednesday in
Moscow's historic Novodevichy cemetery,
the resting place of such diverse figures as
writer Anton Chekhov and former Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev. Putin post
poned his annual state of the state address
from Wednesday toThursday in deference.
Yeltsin was. according to Andrew
Kuchins of the Center for Strategic and In
ternational Studies in Washington, "a revo
lutionary leader at a revolutionary mo
ment." a reformer who battled the Commu
nist Party from the inside.an exultant wreck
er of the U.S.S.R.'s totalitarian regime.
But as president of Russia, he seemed
too willing to use force, too tolerant of cor
ruption. too eager to trust his gut _even
when it led to disaster.
He stood on top of a tank during the
1991 coup attempt by Communist hard
liners like a big game hunter celebrating
his kill, but two years later, he ordered
tanks to shell upstart members of parlia
ment. Me broke up the old Soviet Union,
but then invaded Chechnya when the re
gion joined the rush for independence.
He abolished the old KGB. but then
named a KCiB veteran. Putin, as his heir
apparent.
But what angered many Russians was
how Yeltsin the crusader against Soviet
corruption presided over a fire sale of
state-owned industries to Kremlin insid
ers. a move which created a small cadre of

Russian billionaires overnight.
Meanwhile, during his tenure, many or
dinary Russian citizens saw their savings
wiped out, their jobs evaporate, the socie
ty their parents and grandparents had cre
ated disintegrate.
" I le was one of us," said Galina Alexan
drovna, a Moscow resident, recalling the
heady days after the Soviet collapse.
"When we elected him, we all shouted.
Hurrah for Boris Yeltsin," but then Russia
started selling itself off and we the simple
people didn't like what was happening."
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
president, eulogized Yeltsin as one "on
whose shoulders are both great deeds for
the country and serious errors." according
to the news agency Interfax.
Yeltsin's greatest moments came dur
ing fitful flashes of inspiration and surges
of energy. From atop the tank, he led re
sistance to the attempted coup against
Gorbachev in August 1991, and spear
headed the peaceful end of the Soviet
state on Dec. 25 of that year.
11l with heart problems,and facing possi
ble defeat by a Communist challenger in his
1996 re-election bid. Yeltsin somehow
sprinted through the final weeks of the cam
paign. The challenge transformed the shaky
convalescent into a spry, dancing candidate.
When he boogied onstage with two
miniskirted women during that campaign,
some Russians laughed, while others
rolled their eyes.
11 is career, in fact, was often punctuated
by bizarre behavior that the public chalked
up to drinking. Red-faced pranks, missed
appointments, and inarticulate and contra
dictory public comments were blamed by
aides on jet lag. medication or illness.
Yeltsin was not one to apologize. "A
man must live like a great, bright flame and
burn as brightly as he can." Yeltsin has been
quoted as saying."ln the end. he burns out.
But this is better than a mean, little flame."
Brash and ambitious, Yeltsin rose
through the ranks of the Communist
Party. But he chafed against the party's
iron discipline and turned into one of its
most determined foes.
After he helped bring down the old
regime, Yeltsin couldn't be bothered with
the tricky matter of governing and was
quick to blame subordinates for Russia's
multiplying problems.
"He brought about the fairly peaceful
collapse of the Soviet Union, the disman
tling of the Communist Party," Kuchins
said."Then he inherited a large hairball of
a job that he wasn't well suited to do on a
day-to-day basis."
He seemed to be a democrat by in
stinct, in a nation that had never known

democracy. But as the years passed, he in
creasingly concentrated power in his own
hands. And when there was trouble, he
frequently resorted to force to quell dis
sent _ claiming only that only harsh meas
ures could keep the country together.
He sent tanks and troops in October
1993 to Hush armed hard-liners out of a hos
tile parliament after violence in the streets
of Moscow. And in December 1994, Yeltsin
launched the first of two of Russia's wars
against separatists in the southern republic
of Chechnya _ conflicts that would turn the
Chechen capital of Grozny into a wasteland
and cost the lives of tens of thousands.
Admirers contend that it was the trauma
of the U.S.S.R. s death throes, not Yeltsin's
leadership,that brought Russia to the brink.
"If not for the strong will of Boris Niko
layevich. we cannot rule out that after Gor
bachev. Russia could have plunged _ for
many, many years or even decades _ into
civil war," said Vyacheslav Kostikov, a for
mer press secretary.
Yeltsin pushed through free-market
reforms, creating a private sector and al
lowing foreign investment. In foreign pol
icy. he assured independence for Russia's
Soviet-era satellites, oversaw troop and
arms reductions, and warmly embraced
Western leaders.
Throughout his nearly decade-long lead
ership. he remained Russia's strongest bul
wark against Communism.
"What set him apart was that he very
often defeated his opponents, but he never
trampled on them," said Grigory Yavlinsky,

the head of Russia's liberal Yabloko party,
which under Putin has been marginalized,
"lie would knock an opponent off his
horse, but never destroy him. In his time
there were many shortcomings and even
crimes, but... there was never any physical
removal of political opponents in Russia,
and that was his personal contribution."
But there was another Yeltsin.
1 le was hesitant to act against rampant
crime and epic corruption _ beginning in his
own administration _ as both sapped public
faith and crippled the young democracy.
Millions were impoverished when wages
and pensions went unpaid for months.
In the course of the Yeltsin era, per capi
ta income fell by a staggering 75 percent,
and the nation's population fell by more
than 2 million. Vodka consumption soared.
Yeltsin was a master of Kremlin in
trigues, firing the entire government four
times in 1998 and 1999.The economy sank
into a deep recession in summer 1998, but
\eltsin rarely commented on the troubles
and never offered a plan to combat them.
In foreign affairs, he struggled to pre
serve a role for Russia, which for centuries
had defined itself as one of the great world
powers.
But he also struggled to preserve a role
for the former superpower to offset U.S.
global clout, and in 1999, he sent Russian
troops to Kosovo _ ahead of NATO peace
keepers _ to show that Moscow would not
be elbowed out of European affairs.
Yeltsin is survived by his wife. Naina,
two daughters and several grandchildren.

Boris Yeltsin clasps his hands amid 12, 000 cheering supporters while campaigning to
become Russia's first freely-elected president in Tula, Russia, Thursday, May 30, 1 991.
MOSCOW (AP) - Boris Yeltsin, who kicked
the props < >ut from under the tottering Soviet
empire and then struggled to build a nation
from its wreckage, died Monday after seeing
many of his democratic reforms rolled hack.
The former Russian president was 76.
Larger than life during his tenure,
Yeltsin shrank from public view following
his retirement on New Year's Eve 1999,
and in recent years has rarely given inter
views. But the big. bumptious politician
with the soft pink features and wave of
white hair could be seen again Monday in
file footage on Russian television.
President Vladimir Putin spoke to the
nation some four hours after the an
nouncement of Yeltsin's death, which the
Kremlin said was due to heart failure.
Putin briefly praised Russia's first freely
elected president as a man "thanks to
whom a whole new epoch has started."
"New democratic Russia was born, a free
state open to the world;a state in which power
truly belongs to the people," Putin said.
Yeltsin will be buried Wednesday in
Moscow's historic Novodevichy cemetery,
the resting place of such diverse figures as
writer Anton Chekhov and former Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev. Putin post
poned his annual state of the state address
from Wednesday toThursday in deference.
Yeltsin was. according to Andrew
Kuchins of the Center for Strategic and In
ternational Studies in Washington, "a revo
lutionary leader at a revolutionary mo
ment." a reformer who battled the Commu
nist Party from the inside.an exultant wreck
er of the U.S.S.R.'s totalitarian regime.
But as president of Russia, he seemed
too willing to use force, too tolerant of cor
ruption. too eager to trust his gut _even
when it led to disaster.
He stood on top of a tank during the
1991 coup attempt by Communist hard
liners like a big game hunter celebrating
his kill, but two years later, he ordered
tanks to shell upstart members of parlia
ment. Me broke up the old Soviet Union,
but then invaded Chechnya when the re
gion joined the rush for independence.
He abolished the old KGB. but then
named a KCiB veteran. Putin, as his heir
apparent.
But what angered many Russians was
how Yeltsin the crusader against Soviet
corruption presided over a fire sale of
state-owned industries to Kremlin insid
ers. a move which created a small cadre of

Russian billionaires overnight.
Meanwhile, during his tenure, many or
dinary Russian citizens saw their savings
wiped out, their jobs evaporate, the socie
ty their parents and grandparents had cre
ated disintegrate.
" I le was one of us," said Galina Alexan
drovna, a Moscow resident, recalling the
heady days after the Soviet collapse.
"When we elected him, we all shouted.
Hurrah for Boris Yeltsin," but then Russia
started selling itself off and we the simple
people didn't like what was happening."
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
president, eulogized Yeltsin as one "on
whose shoulders are both great deeds for
the country and serious errors." according
to the news agency Interfax.
Yeltsin's greatest moments came dur
ing fitful flashes of inspiration and surges
of energy. From atop the tank, he led re
sistance to the attempted coup against
Gorbachev in August 1991, and spear
headed the peaceful end of the Soviet
state on Dec. 25 of that year.
11l with heart problems,and facing possi
ble defeat by a Communist challenger in his
1996 re-election bid. Yeltsin somehow
sprinted through the final weeks of the cam
paign. The challenge transformed the shaky
convalescent into a spry, dancing candidate.
When he boogied onstage with two
miniskirted women during that campaign,
some Russians laughed, while others
rolled their eyes.
11 is career, in fact, was often punctuated
by bizarre behavior that the public chalked
up to drinking. Red-faced pranks, missed
appointments, and inarticulate and contra
dictory public comments were blamed by
aides on jet lag. medication or illness.
Yeltsin was not one to apologize. "A
man must live like a great, bright flame and
burn as brightly as he can." Yeltsin has been
quoted as saying."ln the end. he burns out.
But this is better than a mean, little flame."
Brash and ambitious, Yeltsin rose
through the ranks of the Communist
Party. But he chafed against the party's
iron discipline and turned into one of its
most determined foes.
After he helped bring down the old
regime, Yeltsin couldn't be bothered with
the tricky matter of governing and was
quick to blame subordinates for Russia's
multiplying problems.
"He brought about the fairly peaceful
collapse of the Soviet Union, the disman
tling of the Communist Party," Kuchins
said."Then he inherited a large hairball of
a job that he wasn't well suited to do on a
day-to-day basis."
He seemed to be a democrat by in
stinct, in a nation that had never known

democracy. But as the years passed, he in
creasingly concentrated power in his own
hands. And when there was trouble, he
frequently resorted to force to quell dis
sent _ claiming only that only harsh meas
ures could keep the country together.
He sent tanks and troops in October
1993 to Hush armed hard-liners out of a hos
tile parliament after violence in the streets
of Moscow. And in December 1994, Yeltsin
launched the first of two of Russia's wars
against separatists in the southern republic
of Chechnya _ conflicts that would turn the
Chechen capital of Grozny into a wasteland
and cost the lives of tens of thousands.
Admirers contend that it was the trauma
of the U.S.S.R. s death throes, not Yeltsin's
leadership,that brought Russia to the brink.
"If not for the strong will of Boris Niko
layevich. we cannot rule out that after Gor
bachev. Russia could have plunged _ for
many, many years or even decades _ into
civil war," said Vyacheslav Kostikov, a for
mer press secretary.
Yeltsin pushed through free-market
reforms, creating a private sector and al
lowing foreign investment. In foreign pol
icy. he assured independence for Russia's
Soviet-era satellites, oversaw troop and
arms reductions, and warmly embraced
Western leaders.
Throughout his nearly decade-long lead
ership. he remained Russia's strongest bul
wark against Communism.
"What set him apart was that he very
often defeated his opponents, but he never
trampled on them," said Grigory Yavlinsky,

the head of Russia's liberal Yabloko party,
which under Putin has been marginalized,
"lie would knock an opponent off his
horse, but never destroy him. In his time
there were many shortcomings and even
crimes, but... there was never any physical
