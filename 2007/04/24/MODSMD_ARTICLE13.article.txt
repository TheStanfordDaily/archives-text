## Spring cleaning Student Housing organizes drive in honor of Earth Day 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The timing of last weekend's Student 1 lousing
Spring Cleaning drive may have thrown off more
than a few students, but it was no coincidence.The
annual four-day donation drive — which usually
occurs at the end of spring quarter when students
move out of their residences — began early this
year, coinciding with Earth Day on Sunday.
Student Housing and Goodwill Industries of
Silicon Valley teamed up for the recent drive in an
effort to increase environmental awareness and
activism on campus. There will be another dona
tion drive at the usual time, in mid-June when stu

dents leave campus for the summer.
Donations for the drive, which began on Friday,
were accepted at all Housing Service Centers and
at four specified Goodwill drop-off locations
around campus, including the FiBI" basketball
court and the basketball court behind Toyon and
Branner.
"In March, Goodwill contacted Student 1 lous
ing to ask if we would like to sponsor an early
spring donation event." Associate Director of Stu
dent Housing Imogen Hinds said in an email to
The Daily. "The timing of the event was intended
to help raise awareness about the benefits of recy
cling and re-use and to offer students an earlier pe
riod — outside the end-of-quarter-rush — to

begin to clean out their rooms and apartments."
Organizers said the event was a success.
"Goodwill told us that the\ received about 80
bags of donated clothes prior to their final Monday
pick-ups and were very pleased with the response,"
Hinds said. "On Monday morning, many of our
Housing Service Centers reported that their bins
were overflowing from weekend drop-offs. These
items will be picked up shortly and are not includ
ed in Goodwill's preliminary tally."
Details about the end-of-quarter drive will be
available on the Student Housing Web site at
