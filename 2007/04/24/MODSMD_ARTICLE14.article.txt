## Editorial Board SLAC compromise welcome 
### 
Barry Goldwater, in his 1%4 speech ac
cepting the Republican nomination
for his ill-fated presidential campaign
against Lyndon Johnson, famously de
clared: "I would remind you that extremism
in the defense of liberty is novice. Let me re
mind you also that moderation in the pur
suit of justice is no virtue."
But what about extremism in pursuit of
moderation? That is the question that some
may be left pondering in the wake of the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition's spirited and
successful campaign to compel the Universi
ty to reform its living wage policy. In its rough
ly two-week mobilization effort, SLAC rolled
out many of the tried and true elements of
campus activism, including, most controver
sially, a nine-day fast by Stanford students and
community members. When a compromise
was reached Friday. SLAC was quick to de
clare victory — a triumph of passionate ac
tivists over soulless number-crunchers.
For all the heated public protest and
brinksmanship on display last week, however,
the agreement between SLAC and the Uni
versity is a study in reasoned compromise.
The University has agreed to bring its liv
ing wage policy more closely in line with
many of the recommendations made in
2004 by its own Presidential Committee on
Workplace Policies and Practices — com
missioned following an earlier round of ne
gotiations with SLAC — notably by includ
ing workers who work less than 30 hours a
week in the current living wage policy.This
change will guarantee that these workers be
paid a minimum of $11.15 per hour with
benefits or $ 12.59 per hour without benefits.
Despite the reticence the University may
have exhibited towards ennagina, with

SLAC's demands in previous years, the
President's Office (and particularly. Presi
dent Hennessy himself) seemed to make a
sincere effort to engage with activists this
time around. It seems obvious that the nine
day fast was a major reason that this partic
ular campaign enjoyed greater success in
convincing the University to change its pol
icy than did previous efforts.
On the other hand. Stanford's negotia
tors refused to budge in two important areas
by declining to extend the living wage to
unionized workers and workers employed
under contracts of less than $ 1 OO.O(K). By en
gaging with SLAC at the negotiating table
and agreeing to a moderate compromise,
the University can congratulate itself for
both improving the lives of many of its
workers and for defusing a potentially em
barrassing PR situation.
What the Stanford community witnessed
last week was an aggressive student activism
campaign which succeeded in convincing
the University to commit to some of the re
forms it had already espoused three years
before. Neither side "caved" to
"stonewalling" by the other, and both were
forced to moderate their positions.
Although it is unlikely that either the
University or SLAC are completely happy
with the outcome, the most important thing
to remember is that many Stanford workers
will find it a bit easier to provide for them
selves and for their families when the policy
change is implemented Sept. 1. Considering
the great job they do keeping this campus
beautiful and well run. this is a salutary con
clusion to the events of last week. We con
gratulate both SLAC and the office of the
president for effecting this change.
