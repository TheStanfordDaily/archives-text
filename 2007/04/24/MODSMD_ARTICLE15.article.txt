# Not saving it for anyone
## 
### 
During this year's Energy Bowl and
Water Derby, the annual event in
which Stanford students are chal
lenged to cut their energy and water use.
residents of Lagunita Court managed to in
crease their average energy consumption by
2 percent. Congratulations, Lag. 10 points to
you." I "m saving it for you" was the theme of
the Energy Bowl and Water Derby. Clever,
indeed. So what's up. Lag? Are you just a
slutty dorm who can't save anything for any
one?
Now. I live in Lag, so I can report from
the front lines of energy wasting and say
that yes indeed, the kids here flush every
time they pee. they use the dorm TV com
pulsively ("The West Wing" is big among
the pseudo-intellectuals), and they keep
their heaters on like heat is going out of
style. What the hell. Lag? However, in keep
ing with Lag Dining's motto. "It could be
worse" — Lag didn't manage to suck most
at saving energy. Pi Phi andTheta Delta Chi.
for instance, managed to raise their energy
use by 4 percent and 13 percent, respective
ly. I blame hair dryers.
Even Wilbur, with all its freshman enthu
siasm. couldn't muster an energy victory.
Due to no valiant energy-saving efforts
whatsoever, the complex pushed its con
sumption up by 1% during the Energy
Bowl. We'll never know what happened in
the Water Derby, though, because results
for the Derby were tragically scrapped after
the water usage measurements proved to be
largely screwed up across the dorm/house
spectrum. Unaware of this disastrous turn
of events, Rinconada suffered through an "if
it's yellow, let it mellow" policy. Sucks to be

you. Rinconada.
The winner of Best I louse category was.
somewhat surprisingly, not Synergy, which
managed to decrease its energy usage by a
mere I percent. Weak show. Synergy Do
you deserve your reputation? Anyway,
those who managed to suck least at saving
energy in the house category were Grove
Lasuen and Columbae, both of which re
duced their energy use by the un-sucky —
dare I say magnificent — amount of 26 per
cent. Clod knows how Grove Lasuen did it,
hut we all know how Columbae swung their
victory. I'm not saying they all slept togeth
er in a single bed to save on heating, but I
think their past activities will tell us a lot
about their aesthetic. Let's just remember,
for example, that there were reports last
year of group-soaping-up and showering
during the Water Derby. Hey, hey. Colum
bae.
The winners of the Best Dorm title in
the Energy Bowl (sans Water Derby)
were Kimball and Jenkins, both of which
reduced their energy use by 9 percent.
There is only one thing 1 have to say about
this: There's a dorm called Jenkins?
