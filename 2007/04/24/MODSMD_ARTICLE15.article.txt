# Not saving it for anyone

During this year's Energy Bowl and
Water Derby, the annual event in
which Stanford students are chal
lenged to cut their energy and water use.
residents of Lagunita Court managed to in
crease their average energy consumption by
2 percent. Congratulations, Lag. 10 points to
you." I "m saving it for you" was the theme of
the Energy Bowl and Water Derby. Clever,
indeed. So what's up. Lag? Are you just a
slutty dorm who can't save anything for any
one?
Now. I live in Lag, so I can report from
the front lines of energy wasting and say
that yes indeed, the kids here flush every
time they pee. they use the dorm TV com
pulsively ("The West Wing" is big among
the pseudo-intellectuals), and they keep
their heaters on like heat is going out of
style. What the hell. Lag? However, in keep
ing with Lag Dining's motto. "It could be
worse" — Lag didn't manage to suck most
at saving energy. Pi Phi andTheta Delta Chi.
for instance, managed to raise their energy
use by 4 percent and 13 percent, respective
ly. I blame hair dryers.
Even Wilbur, with all its freshman enthu
siasm. couldn't muster an energy victory.
Due to no valiant energy-saving efforts
whatsoever, the complex pushed its con
sumption up by 1% during the Energy
Bowl. We'll never know what happened in
the Water Derby, though, because results
for the Derby were tragically scrapped after
the water usage measurements proved to be
largely screwed up across the dorm/house
spectrum. Unaware of this disastrous turn
of events, Rinconada suffered through an "if
it's yellow, let it mellow" policy. Sucks to be

you. Rinconada.
The winner of Best I louse category was.
somewhat surprisingly, not Synergy, which
managed to decrease its energy usage by a
mere I percent. Weak show. Synergy Do
you deserve your reputation? Anyway,
those who managed to suck least at saving
energy in the house category were Grove
Lasuen and Columbae, both of which re
duced their energy use by the un-sucky —
dare I say magnificent — amount of 26 per
cent. Clod knows how Grove Lasuen did it,
hut we all know how Columbae swung their
victory. I'm not saying they all slept togeth
er in a single bed to save on heating, but I
think their past activities will tell us a lot
about their aesthetic. Let's just remember,
for example, that there were reports last
year of group-soaping-up and showering
during the Water Derby. Hey, hey. Colum
bae.
The winners of the Best Dorm title in
the Energy Bowl (sans Water Derby)
were Kimball and Jenkins, both of which
reduced their energy use by 9 percent.
There is only one thing 1 have to say about
this: There's a dorm called Jenkins?

Where? Why? Well, wherever they
are. they're getting free energy
saving devices and organic cotton
T-shirts as a reward for their ab
stemious energy habits. Lucky bas
tards.
The Annual Energy Bowl and
Water Derby is in its third year at
Stanford, and 1 must say it's a pretty
nifty idea. But it needs more publici
ty and, evidently, more enthusiasm.
It would also help if it were run like
a real Derby, with high stakes gam
bling and lanky women wearing sun
hats and sipping mint juleps by the
sidelines. But we can't have every
thing in life.
1 guess the place to start reinvig
orating the Energy Bowl and other
enviro-things is Environmental
Representatives (or E-Reps for
short), the members of dorm gov
ernment (ha) who are supposed to
keep a watchful eye on the ways in
which their dorm-mates are injur
ing the environment. They are sup
posed to send out emails about not
wasting things and motivate their
dorms to do things like the Energy
Bowl.
1 can't speak for everyone, but 1
can say that if West Lag has an E-
Rep. he/she is hiding under a rock
and certainly not sending emails. I
would take over, but do I have time
to bean E-Repwhen I'm working on
bitchy columns? No. But someone
does. So, where is that special some
one? And why are there not more of
them in other dorms? Privy as 1 am
to top-level Sustainability issues by
virtue of my membership in Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford. I
can say that E-Rep participation has
been embarrassingly lax and Energy
Bowl results have been somewhat
disappointing.
We Sustainability kids are willing
to admit that we didn't give the En
ergy Bowl and Water Derby as
much press as it deserved, hut our
efforts and your enthusiasm have to
meet somewhere in the middle. For
those of you who knew about the
Energy Bowl and kept on heating
your rooms at a steady 75 degrees,
shame on you. A big fat clump of
shame. For God's sake, it's so easy to
turn down the thermostat a few de
grees. put your computer on hiber
nate (which is good for the comput

er anyway) and unplug your cell
phone charger.
Come on. now. Just like someone
once told you every day should be
like Christmas, I'm telling you that
every day is the Energy Bowl and
Water Derby. And I expect some
better results in the official
Bowl/Derby next year. Sustainabili
ty will try to meet you halfway, but
you have to be at that halfway point.
1, however, will be drinking mint
juleps on the sidelines.

duced their energy use by the un-sucky —
dare I say magnificent — amount of 26 per
cent. Clod knows how Grove Lasuen did it,
hut we all know how Columbae swung their
victory. I'm not saying they all slept togeth
er in a single bed to save on heating, but I
think their past activities will tell us a lot
about their aesthetic. Let's just remember,
for example, that there were reports last
year of group-soaping-up and showering
during the Water Derby. Hey, hey. Colum
bae.
The winners of the Best Dorm title in
the Energy Bowl (sans Water Derby)
were Kimball and Jenkins, both of which
reduced their energy use by 9 percent.
There is only one thing 1 have to say about
this: There's a dorm called Jenkins?

Where? Why? Well, wherever they
are. they're getting free energy
saving devices and organic cotton
T-shirts as a reward for their ab
stemious energy habits. Lucky bas
tards.
The Annual Energy Bowl and
Water Derby is in its third year at
Stanford, and 1 must say it's a pretty
nifty idea. But it needs more publici
ty and, evidently, more enthusiasm.
It would also help if it were run like
a real Derby, with high stakes gam
bling and lanky women wearing sun
hats and sipping mint juleps by the
sidelines. But we can't have every
thing in life.
1 guess the place to start reinvig
orating the Energy Bowl and other
enviro-things is Environmental
Representatives (or E-Reps for
short), the members of dorm gov
ernment (ha) who are supposed to
keep a watchful eye on the ways in
which their dorm-mates are injur
ing the environment. They are sup
posed to send out emails about not
wasting things and motivate their
dorms to do things like the Energy
Bowl.
1 can't speak for everyone, but 1
can say that if West Lag has an E-
Rep. he/she is hiding under a rock
and certainly not sending emails. I
would take over, but do I have time
to bean E-Repwhen I'm working on
bitchy columns? No. But someone
does. So, where is that special some
one? And why are there not more of
them in other dorms? Privy as 1 am
to top-level Sustainability issues by
virtue of my membership in Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford. I
can say that E-Rep participation has
been embarrassingly lax and Energy
Bowl results have been somewhat
disappointing.
We Sustainability kids are willing
to admit that we didn't give the En
ergy Bowl and Water Derby as
much press as it deserved, hut our
efforts and your enthusiasm have to
meet somewhere in the middle. For
those of you who knew about the
Energy Bowl and kept on heating
your rooms at a steady 75 degrees,
shame on you. A big fat clump of
shame. For God's sake, it's so easy to
turn down the thermostat a few de
grees. put your computer on hiber
nate (which is good for the comput

er anyway) and unplug your cell
phone charger.
Come on. now. Just like someone
once told you every day should be
like Christmas, I'm telling you that
every day is the Energy Bowl and
Water Derby. And I expect some
better results in the official
Bowl/Derby next year. Sustainabili
ty will try to meet you halfway, but
you have to be at that halfway point.
1, however, will be drinking mint
juleps on the sidelines.

dorm/house did at saving energy.
