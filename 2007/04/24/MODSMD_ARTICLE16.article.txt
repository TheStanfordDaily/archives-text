Misquote in Kenney story

On Sunday, I was interviewed concern
ing Skip's suspension for the front page arti
cle "Kenney will stay." On Monday morn
ing, all the quotes I gave were misrepresent
ed. Every quote reportedly said by Shaun
Phillips ('O7) was actually by me.
Almost every swimming-related article
this year has had mistakes in it. Different
times and wrong names have been used all
year in the articles. I won't go into the cover
age of the swimming this season, but it is
funny that 2h straight Pac-10 titles and second
at NC'A As gets little coverage while Kenney's
suspension gets numerous front pages.
I would hope one of the goals of your
staff would be to provide accurate articles. I
am agitated especially because of the seri
ousness of this article. You write a story

about how Kenney was charged with omis
sions. and in the very article, you have a
major omission. I seriously think this was all
a big mistake, but when you are printing to a
large mass of people and are relied on for
true information, you must make sure the
information is correct.
I hope you take these points seriously. 1
am not asking for a reprint or anything, un
less you feel it is necessary. I am not trying to
put my name in the paper for popularity or
anything. I just want to get the point across
that if you are going to interview me about a
serious issue like this, try to get the informa
tion correct. I do enjoy getting interviewed
and contributing to the Daily, but I enjoy it
the most when the information is accurate.
Ihank you for understanding.
