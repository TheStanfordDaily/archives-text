# Douchebags for Jesus
## 
### 
A couple of douchebags holding
douchebag signs and wearing
douchebagT-shirts were out in White
Plaza last week talking about some incredi
ble douche clown they referred to as god.
I'll is god, svho bears no relation to the
fellow/lady/thing named God (who, I learned
in school, loves everybody and wants us all to
get along), hates on everyone except for
douchebags who preach his word. One of the
signs even had a list of people he sends
straight to hell. Drunkards and fornicators
were right at the top; there goes my whole
fraternity. Adulterers and god haters were
further down, right next to liars and thieves.
And at the bottom of the sign, written in big
ger print than all the others, these horrible
people who claimed to be in the business of
soul saving reminded everyone that of all the
world's sinners, homosexuals were the worst.
'ITiis is offensive for all kinds of reasons,
mainly because Jesus Himself was actually
pretty gay. He was a lot closer to his mom
than his dad. He threw aside the bounds of
normal society to follow his dream, which in
volved kicking it with 12 other dudes. They
were always walking and didn't eat very well,
thus creating gym culture and male eating
disorders.The ladies all loved Jesus like a big
sister because he was so in touch with his feel
ings.
Other religions have hyper-masculine
badass bad dudes as their central figure: Mo
hammed. conquering Mecca; the Old Testa

ment protagonists, Patriarchs and Judges and
Kings, quick with their wits, their swords and
their dicks (David was a stud); or even the
Buddha, who's quiet in that serene Jedi Mas
ter way, like he could probably turn the uni
verse inside out through sheer force of tran
scendence. Jesus just went around telling
people to treat other people the way you'd
want to be treated. We can agree that the son
of God and Man wasn't exactly an alpha
male. He also worked with lepers and taught
poor people, the first-century version of the
Peace Corps and Teach for America.
1 kid'cause 1 love, and because 1 believe in
a God who doesn't mind a few playful jabs at
his image, but does mind when his people
think that they can say a bunch of stupid
things in his name. In my personal vision of
God (colored by a Catholic upbringing, a
Presbyterian mother and several years of
fashionable agnosticism) God is a middle
aged man who understands failure and stu
pidity because he invented them. He can be
angry and jealous, prone to destructive ram

pages which psychiatrists would refer to as
"acting out." But he can also he kind and lov
ing. Like us humans, he has the capacity for
regret (He's never forgiven himself for for
getting to put the dinosaurs on Noah's Ark).
He only wants to do right by his kids, but
everything always seems to get worse. Even
after the long span of his life, he still isn't sure
if he's a good man who does bad things or a
bad man who's just kidding himself. He sees
a psychiatrist, hates his psychiatrist, loves his
psychiatrist. Actually, he's a lot like Tony So
prano.
1 don't think that's so weird. Frankly, 1
think some bombastic Huey Long-type
preaching his awesomeness while throwing
thunderbolts at gays, drug addicts and Mus
lims is pretty damned silly. I like my version
of God because he's not infallible, because he
can change, because, dare I say it, he can
evolve. Guys who hold up signs condemning
people they don't understand are throwing
the tirst stone, and that's plain bad manners.
Its because of Douchebags for Jesus that
1 lost interest in church a long time ago. The
last time 1 went to confession was eighth
grade, back when 1 had to make up a few sins
just so I didn't waste the priest's time.The last
time 1 went to church when it wasn't Christ
mas or Easter was under duress. When 1 came
to college. 1 tigured 1 was through with reli
gion. Now 1 m a senior. And when you're a

Ire and Vice
senior, you don't just feel four years
older. You feel four decades older.
Lately, I've been thinking about
going to church again. Not because
1 think Catholicism is particularly
stellar — women should be priests,
homosexuals should get married,
elderly virgins shouldn't regulate
my sex drive and John Paul 11
should rise from his grave just long
enough to slap some sense into
Benedict.
And yet. two months from the
real world. I find myself moving ever
closer to paranoid existentialism.
Not the fun existentialism, either:
"Like, dude, have you ever thought
about what would happen if colors
could smell fear?" Real,crippling ex
istentialism. How do 1 know 1 exist?
That the world exists? Why live
when you'll just die? And why do all
the hot girls 1 stalk on Facebook
block their profiles?

The last time 1 can remember
asking myself questions like this, I
was in seventh grade and the only
person 1 could ever talk to, the only
guy who understood me even when I
didn't, was God. I would tell him
stuff 1 would never tell anyone. 1
would beg him to protect the people
1 loved, and ask him to let them
know how much 1 loved them, be
cause 1 knew I'd never get around to
telling them myself. He didn't hate
anybody.
1 miss that guy, sometimes. Even if
he doesn't really exist, he was the
best imaginary friend I ever had.
I went to the bookstore and
bought a big poster board, some
highlighters and some duct tape. 1
wrote, "God loves homosexuals and
can't stand douchebags like this"
and taped it to a trash can right next
to the douchebags in question. 1
think that made God chuckle a little
bit.

Don 't worry: thanks to Catholicism,

ger print than all the others, these horrible
people who claimed to be in the business of
soul saving reminded everyone that of all the
world's sinners, homosexuals were the worst.
'ITiis is offensive for all kinds of reasons,
mainly because Jesus Himself was actually
pretty gay. He was a lot closer to his mom
than his dad. He threw aside the bounds of
normal society to follow his dream, which in
volved kicking it with 12 other dudes. They
were always walking and didn't eat very well,
thus creating gym culture and male eating
disorders.The ladies all loved Jesus like a big
sister because he was so in touch with his feel
ings.
Other religions have hyper-masculine
badass bad dudes as their central figure: Mo
hammed. conquering Mecca; the Old Testa

ment protagonists, Patriarchs and Judges and
Kings, quick with their wits, their swords and
their dicks (David was a stud); or even the
Buddha, who's quiet in that serene Jedi Mas
ter way, like he could probably turn the uni
verse inside out through sheer force of tran
scendence. Jesus just went around telling
people to treat other people the way you'd
want to be treated. We can agree that the son
of God and Man wasn't exactly an alpha
male. He also worked with lepers and taught
poor people, the first-century version of the
Peace Corps and Teach for America.
1 kid'cause 1 love, and because 1 believe in
a God who doesn't mind a few playful jabs at
his image, but does mind when his people
think that they can say a bunch of stupid
things in his name. In my personal vision of
God (colored by a Catholic upbringing, a
Presbyterian mother and several years of
fashionable agnosticism) God is a middle
aged man who understands failure and stu
pidity because he invented them. He can be
angry and jealous, prone to destructive ram

pages which psychiatrists would refer to as
"acting out." But he can also he kind and lov
ing. Like us humans, he has the capacity for
regret (He's never forgiven himself for for
getting to put the dinosaurs on Noah's Ark).
He only wants to do right by his kids, but
everything always seems to get worse. Even
after the long span of his life, he still isn't sure
if he's a good man who does bad things or a
bad man who's just kidding himself. He sees
a psychiatrist, hates his psychiatrist, loves his
psychiatrist. Actually, he's a lot like Tony So
prano.
1 don't think that's so weird. Frankly, 1
think some bombastic Huey Long-type
preaching his awesomeness while throwing
thunderbolts at gays, drug addicts and Mus
lims is pretty damned silly. I like my version
of God because he's not infallible, because he
can change, because, dare I say it, he can
evolve. Guys who hold up signs condemning
people they don't understand are throwing
the tirst stone, and that's plain bad manners.
Its because of Douchebags for Jesus that
1 lost interest in church a long time ago. The
last time 1 went to confession was eighth
grade, back when 1 had to make up a few sins
just so I didn't waste the priest's time.The last
time 1 went to church when it wasn't Christ
mas or Easter was under duress. When 1 came
to college. 1 tigured 1 was through with reli
gion. Now 1 m a senior. And when you're a

senior, you don't just feel four years
older. You feel four decades older.
Lately, I've been thinking about
going to church again. Not because
1 think Catholicism is particularly
stellar — women should be priests,
homosexuals should get married,
elderly virgins shouldn't regulate
my sex drive and John Paul 11
should rise from his grave just long
enough to slap some sense into
Benedict.
And yet. two months from the
real world. I find myself moving ever
closer to paranoid existentialism.
Not the fun existentialism, either:
"Like, dude, have you ever thought
about what would happen if colors
could smell fear?" Real,crippling ex
istentialism. How do 1 know 1 exist?
That the world exists? Why live
when you'll just die? And why do all
the hot girls 1 stalk on Facebook
block their profiles?

The last time 1 can remember
asking myself questions like this, I
was in seventh grade and the only
person 1 could ever talk to, the only
guy who understood me even when I
didn't, was God. I would tell him
stuff 1 would never tell anyone. 1
would beg him to protect the people
1 loved, and ask him to let them
know how much 1 loved them, be
cause 1 knew I'd never get around to
telling them myself. He didn't hate
anybody.
1 miss that guy, sometimes. Even if
he doesn't really exist, he was the
best imaginary friend I ever had.
I went to the bookstore and
bought a big poster board, some
highlighters and some duct tape. 1
wrote, "God loves homosexuals and
can't stand douchebags like this"
and taped it to a trash can right next
to the douchebags in question. 1
think that made God chuckle a little
bit.
