## Divestment vote: not so clear-cut 
### NABILL IDRISI, MELISSA MORALES LISA LLANOS 
We. the sponsors of the ASSU Senate res
olution to ensure investment responsibility
in Israel and Palestine, would like to take the
opportunity to respond to Wednesday's cov
erage of the bill ("ASSU rejects divestment,"
4/18/07) and clarify what really happened.
So. why didn't it pass exactly? Outspoken
opponents of the bill have claimed that ef
forts to pass this have been offensive to many
students, strongly intimidating those who
have considered this bill. I lowever. most stu
dents who read the bill — including most
senators — found it very difficult to under
stand the offensiveness of the final bill which.

as one senator who ended up abstaining
noted, "is so neutral and impartial and ad
dresses concerns of 'both sides." Indeed,
most of the abstainees have told us that they
didn't disagree with the bill itself. But they
chose to abstain for other reasons.
The primary reason, from what we've
seen, is because a very strongly-mobilized ad
vocacy group has used intimidation tactics
and consistently claims that organizations
such as the U.N. and Amnesty International
are "one-sided." These actions, unfortunate
ly. only detract from the main point of our
resolution, which is a human rights matter at
its core. We don't want to see our endowment
— to which we. as current Stanford students,
will probably be contributing to in a few

years being invested in companies that
protit I rum severe human rights abuses and
blatant violations of international law.
Another claim by opponents of the bill is
that the discussion has done nothing but sti
fle dialogue on campus. We firmly disagree
and point out that actions by these same crit
ics. in tact, have stilled debate. When we con
tacted several student groups to organize a
campus-wide town hall meeting —the least
that the senators could agree upon — Stan
ford Israel Alliance's president flat-out re
jected our invitation for dialogue, noting that
the whole idea of a town hall on divestment
rests on false premises and that "it is a dis-
