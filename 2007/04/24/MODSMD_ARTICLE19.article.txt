## Divestment vote: not so clear-cut 
### NABILL IDRISI, MELISSA MORALES LISA LLANOS 
We. the sponsors of the ASSU Senate res
olution to ensure investment responsibility
in Israel and Palestine, would like to take the
opportunity to respond to Wednesday's cov
erage of the bill ("ASSU rejects divestment,"
4/18/07) and clarify what really happened.
So. why didn't it pass exactly? Outspoken
opponents of the bill have claimed that ef
forts to pass this have been offensive to many
students, strongly intimidating those who
have considered this bill. I lowever. most stu
dents who read the bill — including most
senators — found it very difficult to under
stand the offensiveness of the final bill which.

as one senator who ended up abstaining
noted, "is so neutral and impartial and ad
dresses concerns of 'both sides." Indeed,
most of the abstainees have told us that they
didn't disagree with the bill itself. But they
chose to abstain for other reasons.
The primary reason, from what we've
seen, is because a very strongly-mobilized ad
vocacy group has used intimidation tactics
and consistently claims that organizations
such as the U.N. and Amnesty International
are "one-sided." These actions, unfortunate
ly. only detract from the main point of our
resolution, which is a human rights matter at
its core. We don't want to see our endowment
— to which we. as current Stanford students,
will probably be contributing to in a few

years being invested in companies that
protit I rum severe human rights abuses and
blatant violations of international law.
Another claim by opponents of the bill is
that the discussion has done nothing but sti
fle dialogue on campus. We firmly disagree
and point out that actions by these same crit
ics. in tact, have stilled debate. When we con
tacted several student groups to organize a
campus-wide town hall meeting —the least
that the senators could agree upon — Stan
ford Israel Alliance's president flat-out re
jected our invitation for dialogue, noting that
the whole idea of a town hall on divestment
rests on false premises and that "it is a dis-
service to the students to begin a di
alogue' on these terms." We and sev
eral other senators strongly disagree
and believe that such a town hall
with representatives of varying per
spectives would indeed be beneficial
to students.
Moreover, the idea was called "an
unfair and illegitimate premise for a
conversation about the complexities
ot the Middle East." By claiming that
the issue is too complex tor normal
discourse, they are again trying to
avoid considering the serious con
cerns about our endowment that
have been raised.
Accepting this standstill from
within the ASSU Senate, moreover,

only exacerbates the situation. Even
though we had received the green
light from the Vice President Lauren
Graham '07 to organize this town
hall, Mondaire Jones '09, the campus
advocacy chair, quashed the idea.
When I brought it up at a general
meeting, the Chair, Hershey Avula
08, was sympathetic towards the
SI As rejection of our invitation. The
ASSU Senate, as a representative
body of the undergraduate popula
tion, should be held more account
able to fulfilling desires of the stu
dent body (such as a fair and open
town hall), instead of playing to the
wishes of an organization for pre
sumably political gain.
Senators often decide to abstain
when they feel like they don't know
enough about the context of the bill
to make an informed decision. Nev
ertheless. the abstained votes are still
included in the requisite 2/3 vote for

the hill to pass. Observers really need
to look at the intentions and context
when considering the abstained
vote. In this case, the resolution has
been made out to be "too controver
sial" and deals with a topic "too com
plex" to really vote on clearly. In any
other context, however, the afore
mentioned reason for abstention
wouldn't apply for a bill that's been
on the table for discussion for two
and-a-half months. The SlA's at
tempts to detract conversation have
combined with the Senate's lethargy
in organizing a town hall to create
this context for abstention.
The title of the article last week
covering this bill made it seem like a
clear-cut majority voted against the
bill. The end-vote, however, was
more complicated than that. First of
all. among the voting members
themselves, there were a majority of
yes votes. Five senators voted ves —

only three voted no. The five other
members who had the right to ac
tively vote chose not to and ab
stained. So, in fact, the number of
senators who actively opposed the
bill was in the minority.
In spite of all this, we consider
what happened last TUesday to be a
success. People forget that divest
ment from South Africa took 25
years. During those years, similar ar
guments were brought up against it.
including that it would offend and di
vide student populations. Indeed,
those activists deeply invested in that
early movement would never have
thought that it would have ever suc
ceeded. But it did. And all great jour
neys require that first step.
