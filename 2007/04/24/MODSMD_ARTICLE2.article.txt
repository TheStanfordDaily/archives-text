## Ethnic identities questioned after Virginia Tech Korean community reacts to blame and guilt following massacre 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the aftermath of last week's Virginia Tech mas
sacre, the national Korean-American community has
reportedly suffered a backlash similar to that un
leashed against Muslims in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 attacks, but Asian Americans on campus largely
agree that they are being treated with respect and sym
pathy and credited the media's portrayal of the attack
as objective and fair.
A number of Facebook groups, such as "Cho Seung-
Hui does NOT represent Asians," are continuously
amassing new members, while a You Tube post with the
words "I belong in Korea" over Cho's face is receiving
hundreds of hits per day.
While the Virginia Tech shooter, Cho Seung-Hui,
was South Korean, other ethnic groups have expressed
empathy for Asians in the wake of last week's attack.
Ahmed Ashraf '07, vice president of the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, said he had similar fears be
fore the identity of the shooter was disclosed.
"I know that when I first heard about the Virginia
Tech tragedy. I was very, very nervous about the gun
man's background," Ashraf said in an email to the
Daily. "If a Muslim student were involved in the mas
sacre, it [would have] hit way too close to home."
Media coverage of the shootings has drawn an am
biguous reaction from Asian students and faculty
members at the University.
"This shows that race and ethnicity is still a key
source of collective identity in the United States," said
