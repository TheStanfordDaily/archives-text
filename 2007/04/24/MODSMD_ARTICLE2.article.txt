## Ethnic identities questioned after Virginia Tech Korean community reacts to blame and guilt following massacre 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the aftermath of last week's Virginia Tech mas
sacre, the national Korean-American community has
reportedly suffered a backlash similar to that un
leashed against Muslims in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 attacks, but Asian Americans on campus largely
agree that they are being treated with respect and sym
pathy and credited the media's portrayal of the attack
as objective and fair.
A number of Facebook groups, such as "Cho Seung-
Hui does NOT represent Asians," are continuously
amassing new members, while a You Tube post with the
words "I belong in Korea" over Cho's face is receiving
hundreds of hits per day.
While the Virginia Tech shooter, Cho Seung-Hui,
was South Korean, other ethnic groups have expressed
empathy for Asians in the wake of last week's attack.
Ahmed Ashraf '07, vice president of the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, said he had similar fears be
fore the identity of the shooter was disclosed.
"I know that when I first heard about the Virginia
Tech tragedy. I was very, very nervous about the gun
man's background," Ashraf said in an email to the
Daily. "If a Muslim student were involved in the mas
sacre, it [would have] hit way too close to home."
Media coverage of the shootings has drawn an am
biguous reaction from Asian students and faculty
members at the University.
"This shows that race and ethnicity is still a key
source of collective identity in the United States," said
Sociology Prof. Gi-Wook Shin."Non
white ethnic groups and females can
be self-conscious and extra careful
precisely because they are still mi
norities in American politics of iden
tity."
Others said they were pleased
with the focus on Cho's mental state,
rather than his ethnicity.
"The media has been pretty good
at being neutral,"said Kenny Kim'oB.
Co-president of the Korean Students
Association. "As a member of the
Asian-American community. I was
inclined to think of the worst possible
outcomes, but the discussion has now
turned more to Cho's mental health
than to his ethnic background."
"This, sadly, is not a new crime in
America and is not seen in new terms
now that the latest perpetrator is of
Korean origin." Shin added. "Experts
have compared him to the
Columbine shooters, saying that he

fits the same profile. This is a judg
ment about mental state and behav
ior patterns that have nothing to do
with race or ethnicity."
In South Korea, reaction to the
Blacksburg, Va. tragedy brought up
deeper, cultural issues.
Shortly after the shooter's ethnici
ty was revealed, the South Korean
government and media went into a
frenzy, debating whether Cho's ac
tions warranted an official national
apology.
Such a phenomenon has raised
discussion of collective guilt. Yet Kim
emphasized the importance of a
clear-cut distinction between guilt
and shame.
"Koreans are a unique race," he
said."We often blur the lines between
the nation and the people.Thus when
we found out that the shooter was Ko
rean. every Korean felt a bit of shame
that one of'us' committed a horrible
act."
" I lowever. this is not to say we feel
any guilt for what happened," he
added. "The act that Cho committed
is an isolated event and has no linkage
with him being Korean or Korean

American."
On campus, students and faculty
said they have faith in the communi
ty's power to overcome the blame
and guilt.
"This tragedy was not about Kore
an or Asian Americans, and 1 am sure
the Stanford community is well aware
of that," Shin said. "In a sense. Cho
himself was a victim and we have so
cial responsibility to make sure that
this kind of tragedy won't happen
again."
