manufacturing the tying run without a
hit — a walk, a sacrifice bunt, a balk by
junior reliever Eirik Davis and a sacrifice

fly knotted the score at 3-3.
In the 10th, junior Adam Sorgi
was able to knock in freshman
Adam Gaylord to start a five-run
Stanford rally that ended up put
ting the game out of reach.

tans are led bv McKimmy and Do-

Nato Giovanatto (.361. 5 MR) in
