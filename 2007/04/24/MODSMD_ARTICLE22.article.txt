ference) sports a 16-10 all-time record
against the Spartans' squad (21-22. 6- l >

Stanford will counter with sophomore
righty Missy Penna. who is 21-6 with a
2.17 ERA Penna picked up a win and a
save in the Cardinal's victories last week
end. allowing three runs but striking out
seven against UCLA and then taking
over for junior Becky McCullough with
3.1 innings of relief against Washington.

Penna gave up only one hit
against the Huskies.
Meanwhile. Stanford's fresh
man centerfielder Alissa Haber
is continuing to power the Car

average rose to .392 last week
end. and with a double to left
center field on Sunday, she con
tinued her hitting streak, which
now stands at 11 games (the
longest active streak in the Pac
-10). This hitting streak is
Haber's second to hit double
digits on the season.

Freshman shortstop Shan
non Koplitz is right behind
Haber in Stanford's batting
stats at .333, while junior third
baseman Michelle Smith and
freshman catcher Rosey Neill
have driven in 36 and 30 runs, re
spectively, to lead the Cardinal
in that category. Smith and Neill
also share the club lead in home
runs with six each.
Stanford will have to refocus
quickly after its game against
the Spartans, as Arizona and
Arizona State — the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the Pac-10. re
spectively — both visit the Car
dinal next weekend.
