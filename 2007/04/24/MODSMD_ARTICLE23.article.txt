Silver's goals came in the second half of play and helped lift Stanford to a 12-8 victory over the Spartans.
the squad all scored goals in the game,
and senior goalie Meridith McColl
stepped up to make eight saves as the
top-ranked Cardinal (23-1, 12-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) rolled
into the postseason by finishing the year
undefeated in conference play.
ITie Cardinal knew it would be up for
a challenge against No. 6 California (10-
10, 6-6 MPSF). The Stanford squad had
played the Bears once in the comfort of
its own pool, posting a 7-5 win in the
third-place game at the Stanford Invita
tional. But this time around, the Cardi
nal was slated to face its rivals in the hos
tile environment of Berkeley's Spieker
Aquatic Center.
The California women, bolstered by
the energy of their hometown crowd,
jumped out to a 2-1 lead after the first
period of play. But senior two-meter
Christina Hewko and the rest of the Car
dinal came roaring back in the second
period to tie the game. Hewko found the
back of the cage three times, and senior
two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
added another on Stanford's last posses
sion of the half to force a 5-5 tie.
Senior driver Katie Hansen put the
Cardinal ahead just over a minute into
the second half with her third goal of the
day.and sophomore scoring phenom
Lauren Silver built the lead to two with
3:33 left in the period.
But the Bears refused to quit, as
freshman driver Meghan Corso nailed a
long outside shot from 10 meters out to
bring her squad back within one before
converting a five-meter penalty shot less
than a minute later to tie the score with
6:46 remaining on the clock.
At that point, however, the Stanford
defense kicked things into high gear and
effectively shut down the California at
tack for the remainder of the game.
Hansen answered at 6:07 with her sec
ond goal of the game, and then it was
Hillman's turn to shine as the Cardinal
closed out the victory.
Hillman. who has stepped up for late
game heroics throughout the season,
provided two key insurance goals that
put the game safely out of the Bears'
reach. California All-American Elsie
Windes put back a rebound to bring her
team within two, but it was too little, too
late, as the Cardinal closed out its victo
ry in convincing fashion.
With the win, the Stanford women
achieved the distinction of being the
first Cardinal squad to win 20 straight
since 2001; that season's team won its
first 27 contests of the season before
falling in the NCAA Championship
match to rival UCLA.
On Saturday, the Cardinal battled the
visiting Spartans in a hard-fought physi
cal matchup. At the half. Stanford led by
just two goals, 4-2, as San Jose State
managed to stay within striking distance.
The two teams played an even third pe
riod. in which Gregorka notched her
only goal of the day.and heading into the
final frame, the score stood at 6-4. Hill
man scored early in the period to put
Stanford up by three, but the Spartans
stormed back to tie the score at 7-7 with
three unanswered goals of their own.
But at that point, Hewko and Hansen
decided to take care of business, com
bining to light up the San Jose State de
fense for four goals in the final five min
utes of game. Hansen paced the Cardi
nal offense with four goals on the game,
while Hewko added a pair and Gregor
ka contributed one. McColl posted eight
saves in the final home match of her ca
reer. and the Cardinal finished its con
ference schedule undefeated.
The Stanford women head to Arizona
State this weekend as the No. 1 seed in
the MPSF conference tournament.
