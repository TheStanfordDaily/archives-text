# Women swing to conference title
## Despite rain delays, Card defeats rival Cal to finish a perfect 8-0 in Pac-10 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Most tennis matches don't take eight
hours to complete. But due to treacherous
weather conditions, that's how long it took
for the Stanford women's tennis team to de
feat their rivals from California, 4-3, on Sat
urday afternoon.
The match was postponed twice because
of showers over Berkeley's Hellman Tennis
Center before it was finally moved to the in
door San Francisco Tennis Club courts. By
the time Cal's Zsuzsanna Fodor defeated
senior Anne Yelsey to push the final score
from 4-2 to 4-3. it was 7:45 p.m.
With all the inconveniences that the Car
dinal had to deal with, head coach Lele
Forood was just happy to escape with the
team's 17th straight victory.
"I'm proud of the team forgetting it done
when we had to." she said. "It was quite the
ordeal."
The win clinched the Pacific-10 Confer-

ence Championship for the Cardinal as it fin
ished with an unblemished 8-0 record in con
ference play. 1 laving wrapped up its regular
season schedule, the team is now 20-1 overall
on the year.
Freshman Lindsay Burdette clinched the
victory for the Cardinal after defeating Cal's
Cristina Visico, 6-4. 4-6. 6-2. Her win made
the score 4-2, eliminating any hopes of the
Golden Bears' hopes for a win.
Unlike the two previous matches, though,
Stanford was unable to romp past Cal by a

score of 6-1; the Bears put up much more of
a fight this time around.
Most notably, Stanford suffered losses at
its top two positions. Senior co-captains
Theresa Logar and Yelsey lost to Cal's No. 1
and 2 players, Susie Babos and Fodor. Babos
was the 2006 NCAA Singles champion, and
showed her strength in an impressive per
formance over Logar.
"I don't know if I've ever seen Babos play
better," Forood said. "She was very inspired
and a little angry ... those kinds of things are
going to happen on their home turf."
With Logar and Yelsey losing at the one
and two positions, the middle of Stanford's
lineup picked up the slack. Burdette and jun
iors Celia Durkin and Whitney Deason all
came up big for the Cardinal.
Durkin and Deason both defeated their
opponents in straight sets; and it was Bur
dette's victory that clinched the win for Stan
ford.
" ITie rest of the team really stepped up."
Yelsey said. "It was amazing to be able to
count on all those spots in the lineup. I'm re
ally happy with how deep we are; it's amaz
ing."
In defeating Cal, Stanford wrapped up
one of its toughest regular seasons in recent
years.The Cardinal suffered a rash of injuries
throughout the season and competed in nu
merous hard-fought matches, yet the team
still finds itself as the top-ranked team in the
nation.
Crucial components of the last three na
tional championship squads, both Forood
and Yelsey were proud of the way this year's
team has performed.
"I'm extremely proud of this team for the
record and performances we've put up this
year," Forood elaborated. "Maybe more so
than any team [I've coached] in a long time,
we've faced more adversity than we have
[beforej. For this team to only take one loss
in early February and to go through a Pac-10
schedule with three other top-10 teams unde
feated is just an awesome achievement."
Explaining that often at least two of the
team's eight members were injured, Yelsey
was also thrilled with her team's regular sea
son.
"The odds were so against us." she said.
"It's amazing if you look at the injuries, but
then it shows how much we want it...We have
what other teams don't have: experience."
"We've been in those tight situations and
we're pulling them out every single time,"
Yelsey added. "That type of experience is
something that no other team has right now."
With the regular season out of the way.
Stanford moves on to the Pac-10 Individual
Championship tournament. The tournament
will serve as little more than a tune-up for the
Cardinal, but it will be the team's last match
experience before the NCAA Champi
onships in May.
The Pac-10 Individual Championship
tournament startsThursdav morning in Ojai,
Calif.
