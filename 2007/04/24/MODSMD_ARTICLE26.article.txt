## Chun shines on day one 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year later,sophomore Mari Chun is
picking up right where she left off at the
Pacific-10 Conference women's golf
championships.
After finishing 11th in the 2006 Pac
-10 Championships, Chun tied for second
individually after yesterday's 2007 first
round, scoring a onc-under-par 71. Her
strong play on day one paced the No. 8
Stanford women's golf team to a tie for
fourth place with No. 15 Arizona (309;21
over par). The field of 10 is currently led
by top-ranked Arizona State (297; nine
over par), followed by No. 6 Southern
California (303) and No. 11 UCLA
(305).
Senior Lauren Todd and freshman
Angela King are currently tied for 23rd
individually, each with a seven-over-par
79. Senior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
has yet to shake off her recent
string of bad play, as she stands in
30th (80). Meanwhile, freshman
Catherina Wang finished the first
day of competition in 36th (83).
Arizona State's Anna
Nordqvist is currently leading the
pack with a four-under-par 68.This
is no surprise coming from the No.
2-ranked women's collegiate play
er in the nation. Chun, at second, is
sandwiched between Nordqvist
and USC's Paola Moreno, who fin
ished the day with an even-par 72.
The Cardinal looks to continue
its strong play during today's sec
ond round, which tees off at 9 a.m.
on the 6,1%-yard Broadmoor Golf
Club course in Seattle.
