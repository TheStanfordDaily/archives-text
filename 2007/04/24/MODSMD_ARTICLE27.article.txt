faced a minor setback when Cal's Laura
Cavallo notched two back-to-back goals to
give the Bears an edge. Not to be deterred.
Cardinal junior Daphne Patterson evened
things up right before the end of the half,
sending both teams to the locker room with
the score tied.
The second half started off with much the
same back-and-forth scoring as in the first.

Cal's Madeline Dale netted a goal just 1:54
after the whistle blew, only to have McClain
answer with her second goal of the game two
minutes later. Stanford decided it was time to
jump into action, scoring consecutive goals
and pulling ahead when a Piselli shot found
the back of the net.
The Bears were not done yet. however,
and by the time the clock had hit the seven
minute mark, they had once again evened the
score.
Whether it was the sentimental effect of
Senior Day, months of hard training or sim
ply great team camaraderie, something lit a
fire under the Cardinal for three straight
goals. Freshman midfielder Julie Christy
started the scoring streak with a goal at the
10:38 mark off an assist from Patterson. Pat
terson added her own goal three minutes
later, followed by Lindsay's second goal on
the day.
The Cal women desperately fought back

with two goals from Cavallo and Dani Zu
ralow.hut the Bears squad couldn't manage a
comeback against Stanford junior goaltender
Laura Shane. Over the last six minutes of
play, Stanford's Schmidt notched her second
goal of the game, while sophomore midfield
er Bess Siegfried made her first, ending the
game with a solid three-point margin for the
Cardinal.
The victory slates Stanford as the No. 3
seed for the MPSF tournament, but the team
must first battle UC-Davis, today at 4 p.m.
The Aggies are currently tied for fifth in the
MPSF,putting them in last place alongside St.
Mary's, which Stanford routed. 22-6. earlier
this season. The Aggies are led in scoring by
Megan O'Connor with 34 goals on the season
and Patrice Clark with 27. Stanford's leading
scorers, Schmidt and Patterson, have both
collected 19 goals this season.
