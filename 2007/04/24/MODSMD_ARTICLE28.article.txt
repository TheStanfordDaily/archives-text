## Disappointing finish for Cardinal California crushes Stanford hopes for NCAA Tournament appearance 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Given Stanford's near-success and improved results as
of late, fans would have hoped that the men's tennis team
could have closed out its season with a win, but the Card
dropped its final regular-season match to California on
Saturday.
Despite challenging top-10 teams like No. 9 Southern
California and No. 10 UCLA recently, No. 53 Stanford (8-
16. 2-5 Pacific-10 Conference) struggled against No. 39
Cal on Senior Day, ultimately losing 5-1.
Although the score was not the 7-0 shutout that the
Bears (14-9.4-3) posted in March. Stanford surely would
have liked to send off seniors Eric McKean and David
Ryan with a score slightly better than the actual result.
Saturday's dismal and cloudy weather suited the out
come of the match well. Due to predictions of rain later in
the afternoon, the match commenced with singles play,
which proved to be unfortunate for the Card, given the
positive results the team has posted in doubles this season.
As play began, most of the first sets were extremely
tight. However, the only Cardinal player able to pick up a
set was freshman Richard Wire at the second singles spot.
No. 73 Wire picked up the first. 6-3. against Cal's Tyler
Browne.
Of the remaining matches, four of those first sets were
lost by margins of a mere two games. At the first, fourth
and sixth singles positions, respectively, sophomore Matt
Bruch. McKean and Ryan all dropped their opening sets
with identical scores of 6-4. Sophomore Blake Muller also
narrowly lost the first set. 7-5. when he made an unforced
error on his forehand side.
Wire quickly blew through the next set. bageling his
opponent in the second to give the Card its first point of
the day. However, after this brief lead, the rest of the
matches went in favor of the Bears.

Singles
No. 1: Mouillon (C) defeated Bruch (S), 6-4, 7-5
No. 2: Wire (S) defeated Brown (C), 6-3, 6-0
No. 3: Heavey (C) defeated Muller (S), 7-5, 6-3

Cal's kullim Stewart led Ryan 5-0 in the second before
the senior managed to pick up one more game before
falling (">-4. 6-1. Moments later, when a shot sailed wide,
freshman Kevin Kaiser fell to Cal's Ken Nakahara, 6-0,6-
2.
With the Card trailing 1-2, Muller found himself down
a set and 3-5 in the second. After a relatively conservative
point, a backhand from the sophomore ended up in the
net to give the Bears a 3-1 edge.
Cal's Pierre Mouillon clinched the match when he de
feated Bruch in a tight, straight-set victory. Alter dropping
the first set. Bruch took an early break in the second to go
up 2-0. No. 32-ranked Mouillon battled back to even the
score, and with Bruch leading 5-4 in the second, the Bear
won the final three games to seal the fourth point and
Cal's victory.
After the outcome of the match had been decided, all
eyes turned to Court 4. where McKean faced Daniel
Sebescen, a gifted player in his own right. Last year, in the
first round of the Pac-10 individual tournament, the sen
ior from Yugoslavia stretched Bruch to three sets before
falling to the Cardinal. 6-4.1 -6.6-3.
On Saturday, the Yugoslavian narrowly nabbed the
first set against McKean before Stanford's senior captain
rallied back and won a 6-2 second set. I lowever. once the
superbreaker for the third set began. Sebescen began
painting the lines; the Bear led 6-2 and then 9-3 before
jamming McKean with a big serve on his forehand to close
out the breaker, 10-5.
In a ceremony following the match to honor McKean
and Ryan, the mood proved to be touching, yet the play-
