## Law lecturers explain new abortion decision Choice group looks to future of Roe v. Wade 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Supreme Court's decision to
uphold the federal Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act last week could
change the way federal courts tackle
abortion, Law professors Jane Schac
ter and Alan Morrison said at a
lunchtime event yesterday.
Stanford Law Students for Choice
invited Schacter and Morrison, who

are both experts in constitutional law.
to speak on the implications of Gonza
les v. Carhart, a 5-4 decision written by
Justice Anthony Kennedy '58.
The wording of the decision
marked a significant departure from
previous Supreme Court cases per
taining to abortion, the speakers said.
The difference could signal a real shift
in the attitude of the court toward
abortion, a possible indication that the
Roberts Court would be willing to
take steps to overturn the landmark
1 1 )73 Roe v. Wade case.
"The rhetoric has really tracked
the rhctoric and tactics ot the pro
lite political movement," Morrison
said.
The language ot the decision was
effective at provoking a response but
was sometimes internally inconsis
tent, the speakers said. For instance.
Schacter pointed out, the case focused
on "protecting women from their
own, inevitable sense of regret."
"That seems to me a call to disclose
information," she said, noting that the
decision allows Congress to directly
regulate abortion procedures in the
second trimester. "There's a mis
match between the problem that's
being described and the solution
that's being offered."
Morrison and Schacter agreed that
the case would probably change the
strategies of litigators in abortion
cases, rendering class-action cases less
probable because of the decision's
failure to insist on a sweeping protec
tion for women's health. In cases
where partial birth abortions will be
used in the future, doctors would have
to indicate that they had not begun
the abortion with that procedure in
mind.
ITie speakers also agreed that the
decision will probably not save a sin
gle fetus.
"'The only question is," Morrison
asked, "how are they going to be
aborted?"

Brad Chernin J.D. '09, a member of
Stanford Law Students for Choice,
said the event was scheduled so stu
dents could get the experts' opinions
on the case's significance and its
repercussions.
"It was basically a step backward
in the whole abortion rights move
ment." Chernin said of the decision.
"There is an urgency' to inform people
about what the decision says and what
it means for women and the abortion
rights movement."
The decision upheld a federal law
which banned partial birth abortion.
The same law had been overturned in
separate cases in the Eighth and
Ninth Circuits of the United States
Court of Appeals/The ban did not in
clude an exception protecting preg
nant women's health.
The Court's decision was long an
ticipated.
"We've been talking about this
case all year," said Dorotha Ocker
J.D. "08. president of Stanford Law
Students for Choice. "The decision
wasn't expected until June."
Jessica Haro "07, former president
of Stanford Students for Choice, at
tended the event, which she said was
helpful because of the legal perspec
tive it added to an issue that has been
largely political.
"I think this will definitely have a
cooling effect on any kind of second
trimester abortion," she said. "There's
this question now of intent. It's defi
nitely really scary."
