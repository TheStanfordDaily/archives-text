### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
Barack Obama, the junior sena
tor from Illinois since 2005, is the
early favorite among Stanford stu
dents and Prospective Freshman
who voted in a straw poll last
week.
One-hundred fifty students —
and 75 prospective freshmen —
voted for their favorite 2008 presi
dential candidate by tossing a

penny into a box with the candi
date's picture in a Stanford De
mocrats-sponsored poll.
Conducted in White Plaza, the
poll was open for three days and, if
they desired, students were able to
vote multiple times.
Among current students. Sen.
Barack Obama (D-IL) was the
clear favorite, winning 50 percent
of the vote. (Obama also garnered
a whopping 68 percent of the vote
in the Prospective Freshmen Poll.)
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY)came
in second with 27 percent of the
vote, with former Sen. John Ed-
wards (D-NC), Gov. Bill Richardson (D
-NM) and former Vice President A 1 Gore
trailing behind.
Debashish Bakshi '08, political director
of the Stanford Democrats, organized the
event, which went according to expecta
tions.
"1 expected Sen. Obama to do very well,"

said Bobby Lepore '07, president of the Stan
ford Democrats. "Gov. Richardson also per
formed well compared to how he's been far
ing in the national polls. It's probably safe to
assume that a higher proportion of Stanford
students know who he is compared to the
general population, if for no other reason
than that they saw him on The Daily Show."
"I was a little surprised by the somewhat
low showing for former Sen. Edwards," he
added. "There's been a lot of hype lately
about his candidacy having a lot of support
among young voters, but that doesn't seem
to hold true on campus."
Nellie Selander '07. former president and
current board member of the group, hopes
the straw poll events will continue.
"I like these events that are more fun
than super policy oriented," she said, refer
encing the club's sponsorship of a filibuster
to discuss filibuster policy.
Lepore said he wants to coordinate an
event with other student groups across cam
pus in an attempt to build student enthusi
asm about the upcoming election.
"We hope to use the results of the polls to
help us bring the students' favorite candi
dates to campus and to help guide our event
and meeting planning in the coming
months," said Beth D'Aunno '09, the Stan

ford Democrats field member, in an email to
The Daily.
Participants were also given information
on how to become a registered voter, includ
ing voter registration forms.

As the group heads to the State Democ
ratic Convention this weekend, Lepore said
he lias plans to organize a statewide straw
poll with other collegiate political groups.
"It the candidates sec college students as

likely voters,"he said, "they'll make special
efforts to reach out on the issues important
to us."
