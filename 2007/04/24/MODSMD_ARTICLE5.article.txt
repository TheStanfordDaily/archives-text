said. "We'll use this time to blend the works of
these two giants who share a common agenda.

Latinos could wield immense politi

"Tom Bradley ran for mayor of
LA in the early 705," he said."He did

Next time he got the votes of Hast LA
and he won again and again."
"That is King and Chavez's legacy.
Those who once picked cotton and
grapes in sovereign shame could now
pick presidents and governors."
Jackson reserved special heat for
those who would advocate an Eng
lish-only America.
"Most people in the world tonight
are yellow, brown, black, non-Christ
ian, poor, female, young and don't
speak English," he said. "That's the
world in which we live. And to glorify
one language for communication is
ignorance and retardation. Are you
telling us that we can't learn another
language? Is it a brain thing or an at
titude thing? It couldn't be a Christ
ian thing. Jesus did not speak Eng
lish."
In his far-ranging talk. Jackson
also talked about gun control. New
Orleans, his days in the civil rights
movements, his presidential cam
paigns in 1984 and 1988 and the im
portance of developing moral charac
ter.
"There's no intrinsic value in
color," he said. "You didn't decide to
be black or brown, or have your first
language be Spanish. But you can de
cide to have character."
Jackson closed the speech by
telling the audience about Chavez's
funeral and about its duty to remem
ber this man.
"The power of unearned suffer
ing. "Hie power of authenticity. The
power of genuineness. The power of
one who united his whole people." he
reminded the audience. "He lifted
this race of people on his shoulders!"
The Cesar Chavez Commemora
tive Celebration is a week-long, annu
