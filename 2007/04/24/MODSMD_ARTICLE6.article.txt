# Election debate rages
## Senate could reconsider rejection of runoff after members accuse Avula/Jones of pressure before vote 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When the Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted last week to overturn
Elections Commissioner Bernard
Fraga's call for a runoff between
ASSU executive-elect Avula/Jones
and the runner-up slate, Brett and
Lakshmi, it appeared that the last
chapter of this year's ASSU elections
was finally closed.
Some senators who voted against
the runoff are reconsidering their de
cisions, however, and are planning to
discuss concerns about last week's 12-
1 vote at the Senate meeting tonight.
Three senators told The Daily that
they felt pressured by 1 lershey Avula
'08 and Mondaire Jones '09 to vote
against the runoff, while Avula and
two other senators categorically de
nied the accusations.
In addition, outgoing ASSU Presi
dent Elizabeth Heng '07 and Vice
President Lauren Graham '07 said
they were told by several senators that
some of their colleagues did not feel
comfortable voting on short notice,
and that senators were contacted by
Avula or Jones and encouraged to
vote against the runoff prior to the
meeting.

"We feel that Avula and Jones ex
ercised inappropriate control over the
meeting environment by creating arti
ficial time pressure and incentives to
suppress debate," they wrote in a joint
statement prepared for The Daily last
night. "We agree with the senators
that it was unethical of Avula and
Jones to push the issue of voting on a
runoff in the way they did."
"It could have been beneficial for
Avula and Jones to rush the issue and
contextualize the discussion in a very
charged setting which might hamper
open dialogue and debate among the
senators," they continued in their
statement, available in full on The
Daily's Web site. "Avula and Jones'
resignation prior to the discussion cre
ated a misleading impression of im
partiality, and does not mitigate an in
appropriate ethical conflict of inter
est."
Contradicting accusations
Senator Nabill ldrisi '09 said that
then-ASSU Senate Chair Avula con
tacted him prior to the Apr. 17 meet
ing and told him to vote against the
runoff — a statement that was echoed
by some senators, but vigorously de
nied by others.
"He portrayed it as a very small
technicality and he encouraged me to
vote to overturn it," ldrisi said. "In
spite of me saying that I would prob
ably abstain he still encouraged me to
overturn the motion to have a runoff,
and I felt uncomfortable."
ldrisi said he was the second sena
tor Avula contacted upon discover
ing the possibility of a runoff, and
ldrisi said he talked to several other
senators who were also contacted,
ldrisi said that he planned to abstain
from voting, but again felt pressured
to vote against the runoff after a talk
with Jones just before last week's
meeting.
"I was going to abstain, but right
before the meeting started.
Mondaire called me up to talk to him
and he basically pointed out the
clause in the bylaws about the Un
dergraduate Senate [being able] to
overturn the runoff." he said. "ITiey
made me feel guilty in my wanting to
abstain."
Two other senators offered stories
strikingly similar to those of ldrisi,
Heng and Graham, but they declined
to comment on the record regarding

the pre-vote discussions, citing what
one described as a fear of personal
and social consequences in the tight
knit student government community
"There's a fine line," said one of
the senators. "[Avula and Jones] are
both my friends but we're also sena
tors together. It does create a bit of
moral ambiguity It would have been
fine if they had just told me 'this is an
issue, what do you think about that?'
That wasn't the case. There's a differ
ence between asking someone's
opinion and using your friendship to
expect their support"
Avula firmly denied that he at
tempted to sway senators to vote
against a runoff. I le said that he sim
ply called senators to let them know
he would be stepping down as Senate
Chair, because the bylaws do not per
mit an executive to hold a Senate po
sition. In the same conversations, he
told the senators that Fraga would
propose a runoff.
"I didn't put any pressure on any
of the senators," he said. "It was kind
of my job [to call them] since I was
transitioning out. After calling them
and telling them that [Jones and I]
would be transitioning out, I told
them this issue [of a runoff] would be
coming up. I didn't lead them one
way or another."
"In no way was I intending to sway
their vote," he added. "I was just

doing my duty."
Several senators came to Avula's
defense. Priyanka Goel '07 said that
Avula in no way pressured her to
vote in a particular manner.
"He did not urge me either way,"
she said. "I never felt pressured by
him. He just let me know that this was
going on. I think it's great that he let
me know so [that] prior to the deci
sion I was able to do my research. I
just wanted to make an informed de
cision."
After learning from The Daily
that several ASSU senators were say
ing that he and Jones exerted undue
pressure, Avula contacted senator
Valerie Villarreal '07, who called ITie
Daily in the pair's defense.
"Mondaire called me about an
hour before the Senate meeting and
said, 'Just so you know, this vote is
going to be going up.'" she said. "In
no way did he say 'You have to vote
xyz.' It was not at all coercive in na
ture. Knowing the integrity of Hcr
shey and Mondaire, I couldn't imag
ine them compromising that."
The GSC
Before the GSC voted unani
mously to overturn Fraga's call for a
runoff last Wednesday night, the
graduate legislative body also heard
impassioned arguments from some
of its members.

Prior to the vote, GSC member
Adam Beberg sent a stronglv-worded
email to other members of the council.
"I can give you a dozen reasons
why we don't want a runoff, no one
really does, not even the slate that
lost who said as much." he wrote in
the email, later obtained by The
Daily. "Founder's intent — we can
bring him to the meeting if we want
— is clearly to let it stand. Bottom
line, though, is we all missed this line,
and should have fixed it in Amend
ment A."
"So, heads up. we'll have to certify,
and then move — by 2/3 — to block
a new election being called," he
added. "All is right with the universe
once again."
In an email to the Daily yesterday,
he wrote, "We know the constitution
and bylaws and talk to the people
that wrote them all the time. There
was never any controversy at all ex
cept the one created by 'ITie Daily.
The vast amount of misinformation
was not at all appreciated either. Let
it go."
GSC member George Bloom,
who forwarded Beberg's email to the
GSC list, said that he felt the GSC's
discussion of the runoff was objective
and thorough.
"It was handled fairly and openly"
he said. "The email from Adam was
the only email that went out. There

was no secret information.There was
no amount of orchestration."
Another runoff discussion
ldrisi also said he was displeased
by what he viewed as a lack of discus
sion during last week's ASSU meet
ing regarding the larger implications
of voting against the runoff — a feel
ing shared by other senators who said
they will likely discuss their concerns
at tonight's meeting.
"The discussion seemed very or
chestrated in some sense and very
hastily carried out in that people very
quickly expressed their opinions suc
cessively and then it was pretty soon
thereafter put to a vote." he said.
Melissa Morales '09 said she felt
the discussion was too rushed by
what she saw as senators' desire to
discuss a vote on Israel divestment.
"The process was very rushed and
there was definitely not enough dis
cussion and dialogue about both the
actual constitutional rules of the
runoff and the consequences of the
precedent we're setting by not choos
ing to do the runoff," she said. "The
runoff vote seemed like more of an
afterthought when it really shouldn't
have been. It was an important deci
sion."
ldrisi also said he believed that ab
stentions are usually a very impor
tant part of a vote, and that the initial

decision against a runoff was mis
guided.
"The GSC concluding that ab
stentions aren't important enough to
include in the majority vote — it con
tradicts how we vote on bills week to
week." he said. "Abstained votes are
very much part of the total vote count
when we have to pass a bill by 2/3 ma
jority. By implicitly accepting one in
terpretation. we contradict ourselves
almost."
Avula told The Daily that he had
no qualms about the Senate dis
cussing the runoff a second time, but
he said he thought the first discussion
was thorough and non-controversial.
"We're fine with the [new] discus
sion," he said. "We think it's impor
tant [forj l he Senate and the legisla
tive bodies to discuss issues .is they
see fit. It's not in our description to
formally agree t»r disagree with the
Senate. We believe that the discus
sion did occur fairly and that a lot of
voices were heard."
"There seemed to be a really thor
ough discussion, five to 10 minutes at
least, and different voices and opin
ions were heard." he added. "Ulti
mately. the Senate appeared to come
to a relatively non-controversial de
cision. 12-1."
