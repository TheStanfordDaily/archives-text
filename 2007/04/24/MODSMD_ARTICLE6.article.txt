# Election debate rages
## Senate could reconsider rejection of runoff after members accuse Avula/Jones of pressure before vote 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When the Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted last week to overturn
Elections Commissioner Bernard
Fraga's call for a runoff between
ASSU executive-elect Avula/Jones
and the runner-up slate, Brett and
Lakshmi, it appeared that the last
chapter of this year's ASSU elections
was finally closed.
Some senators who voted against
the runoff are reconsidering their de
cisions, however, and are planning to
discuss concerns about last week's 12-
1 vote at the Senate meeting tonight.
Three senators told The Daily that
they felt pressured by 1 lershey Avula
'08 and Mondaire Jones '09 to vote
against the runoff, while Avula and
two other senators categorically de
nied the accusations.
In addition, outgoing ASSU Presi
dent Elizabeth Heng '07 and Vice
President Lauren Graham '07 said
they were told by several senators that
some of their colleagues did not feel
comfortable voting on short notice,
and that senators were contacted by
Avula or Jones and encouraged to
vote against the runoff prior to the
meeting.

"We feel that Avula and Jones ex
ercised inappropriate control over the
meeting environment by creating arti
ficial time pressure and incentives to
suppress debate," they wrote in a joint
statement prepared for The Daily last
night. "We agree with the senators
that it was unethical of Avula and
Jones to push the issue of voting on a
runoff in the way they did."
"It could have been beneficial for
Avula and Jones to rush the issue and
contextualize the discussion in a very
charged setting which might hamper
open dialogue and debate among the
senators," they continued in their
statement, available in full on The
Daily's Web site. "Avula and Jones'
resignation prior to the discussion cre
ated a misleading impression of im
partiality, and does not mitigate an in
appropriate ethical conflict of inter
est."
Contradicting accusations
Senator Nabill ldrisi '09 said that
then-ASSU Senate Chair Avula con
tacted him prior to the Apr. 17 meet
ing and told him to vote against the
runoff â€” a statement that was echoed
by some senators, but vigorously de
nied by others.
