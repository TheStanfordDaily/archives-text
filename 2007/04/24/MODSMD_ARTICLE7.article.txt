### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Students in bright blue T-shirts rallied in
White Plaza yesterday, serving free falafel. giv
ing speeches and dancing in honor of Israeli In
dependence Day. The celebration marked the
59th anniversary of the creation of the Jewish
state.
While the Stanford Israel Alliance-spon

sored event was a cause for merriment and com
memoration for many, it was a sobering re
minder of the tenuous relationship between Is
rael and Palestine for others. Students bearing
black T-shirts stood in silent protest, holding
signs to remind those passing by of the Palestin
ian population displaced by the creation of Is
rael.
"People should think more about the history
of Israeli Independence Day," said Sam Dubai
'08. "[We want people to] remember that there's
another side to the story that needs to be recog
nized."
Dubai was one of about 40 unaffiliated stu
dents who came to protest the event.
"We're protesting the idea of celebrating a day

which, whether or not you agree with the cre
ation of a Jewish state, had a huge, devastating
effect on the Palestinian population,"said Char
lotte Silver '09, co-president of Jews for Justice
in Palestine, a new student group that promotes
solidarity between Jews and Palestinians.
