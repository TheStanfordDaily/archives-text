## Celebration and protest of Israel Student conflict over rally for Israeli Independence Day 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Students in bright blue T-shirts rallied in
White Plaza yesterday, serving free falafel. giv
ing speeches and dancing in honor of Israeli In
dependence Day. The celebration marked the
59th anniversary of the creation of the Jewish
state.
While the Stanford Israel Alliance-spon

sored event was a cause for merriment and com
memoration for many, it was a sobering re
minder of the tenuous relationship between Is
rael and Palestine for others. Students bearing
black T-shirts stood in silent protest, holding
signs to remind those passing by of the Palestin
ian population displaced by the creation of Is
rael.
"People should think more about the history
of Israeli Independence Day," said Sam Dubai
'08. "[We want people to] remember that there's
another side to the story that needs to be recog
nized."
Dubai was one of about 40 unaffiliated stu
dents who came to protest the event.
"We're protesting the idea of celebrating a day

which, whether or not you agree with the cre
ation of a Jewish state, had a huge, devastating
effect on the Palestinian population,"said Char
lotte Silver '09, co-president of Jews for Justice
in Palestine, a new student group that promotes
solidarity between Jews and Palestinians.

Ibe event's organizers, however,
had a different take on the impor
tance ot Israeli Independence Day.
"Our goal, [despite] all the politi
cal controversy, [was that) we want
ed to celebrate the first-world coun
try that Israel is." said Carrie Mly
narc/yk '09, co-president of the Stan
ford Israel Alliance and co-chair of
the event. "We're providing an op
portunity to learn more about Is
rael."
Mlynarczyk maintained that the
goal of the event was not to stir up
controversy.
"There are a couple of people who
want to focus on the negatives," she
said, "but the whole point of this was
celebrating Israel and most of the
student body seems to have gotten
the message."
Andrew Ehrich '09, a speaker at
the event, agreed that the day was
about the positives.
"Yes it has its faults, but today
we're celebrating the fact that for the
past 59 years Israel has worked at
solving those problems towards a
peaceful Middle Hast," he said."l'm
saddened that so much energy is
spent demonizing the state of Israel,
[but] it's good that the campus
knows both sides of the issue."
"This is a really complicated
issue." said Sari Bourne '07. after
singing the Israeli National Anthem.
"Today for me is about sharing my
love for Israel. I'm not here to fight.
I'm here because I love this state and
I want peace for both of us."
"There [are] some issues 1 have
with Israel too," said Bourne, who
helped organize the event. "It's not
okay to criticize Israel's right to
exist. That's anti-Semitic. Today's
not about the conflict."
The event was not lacking in con
troversy. Kosha Dillz. an Israeli rap
group that performed at the event,
made references to bombs over
Gaza, said Omar Shakir '07. presi
dent of Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel (SCAI). Shakir
said that protesters were offended
by some of the rappers' lyrics and
gestures, who were hired independ
ently and are not affiliated with the
University.
"To be celebrating without even
acknowledging what happened is re

ally offensive," Shakir said.
"Our goal is to be here and to re
member the events of May 1948.
This is a day 750.000 refugees were
created." said Shakir. who estimates
the current number of Palestinian
refugees at close to five million.
"While some celebrate the cre
ation of a homeland, we stand here
to remember the destruction of the
indigenous society and a 59-year
subjugation of the indigenous popu
lation that resulted from that," he
added. "We're here to represent
them and to show the Stanford com
munity that today isn't merely a day
of celebration."
At the end of the lunch hour the
protesters marched silently through
White Plaza.
Mirra Schwartz '09, an attendee,
acknowledged the presence of the
protesters.
"I'm here for the falafel and also
for Israel," she said. "I'm definitely
conflicted. Most people here who
are educated are conflicted."
