## Journalist dies in Menlo crash Pulitzer winner was writing book on "the greatest game ever played" 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - David Halberstam,a Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer who chronicled the Vietnam War
generation, civil rights and the world of sports, was killed
in a car crash Monday, his wife and local authorities said.
He was 73.
Halberstam, of New York, was a passenger in a car
that w;is broadsided by another vehicle in Menlo Park,
south of San Francisco. San Mateo County Coroner
Robert Foucrault said. The cause of death appeared to be
internal injuries, he said.
The accident occurred around 10:30 a.m.. and Halber
stam was declared dead at the scene. Menlo Park Fire
Chief I larold Schapelhouman said.
The driver of the car carrying Halberstam and the per
son driving the car that crashed into his were injured, but
not seriously
Halberstam was being driven by a graduate journal
ism student from the University of California, Berkeley,
which had hosted a speech by the author Saturday night
about journalism and what it means to turn reporting into
a work of history. They were headed to an interview he
had scheduled with Hall of Fame quarterback Y. A.Tittle.
Halberstam was working on a book. "The Game,"
about the 1958 NFL championship between the Balti
more Colts and the New York Giants, often called the
greatest game ever played,said his wife, Jean Halberstam.
She said she would remember him most for his "un
ending. bottomless generosity to young journalists."
"For someone who obviously was so competitive with
himself, the generosity with other writers was incredible."
she said.
In an interview earlier this month with The Associat
ed Press, Halberstam recalled the zeal with which he and
his colleagues covered Vietnam.
"Maybe we were 28, 29, 26 and we had a great story,
which we knew and we had a lock on the truth because we
had such great sources. When for a variety of reasons — a
flawed,deeply flawed policy — the government starts lying.

that is when independent journalism really matters," he said.
Such reporting, he said, is a key component of democ
racy.
"The idea that somewhere before it is a big story that
there is some young person ... putting themselves on the
line morally, ethically, journalistically, that is a great
thing," Halberstam said."l mean, that is what a free soci
ety is about."
As word of Halberstam's death spread, tributes and
remembrances poured in for the veteran reporter whose
baritone matched the heft of his nonfiction narratives.
"He was a dear friend," said author Gay Talese, who
was at the Halberstams' home Monday night and was
best man at his wedding.
Halberstam was born April 10,1934, in New York City
to a surgeon father and teacher mother. His father was in
the military, and Halberstam moved around the country
during his childhood, spending time in Texas. Minnesota
and Connecticut.
He attended Harvard University, where he was man
aging editor of the 1 larvard Crimson newspaper.
He launched his career in 1955 at the Daily Times
Leader in West Point. Miss. 1 le spent only a year there be
cause the editor at the time thought 1 ialberstam was too
liberal, said Bill Minor, the Jackson, Miss., bureau chief
for The Times-Picavune of New Orleans.
Minor remained friends for decades with Halberstam,
who he said was not afraid to wear his social conscience
on his sleeve.
Halberstam went on to The Tennessean, in Nashville,
where he covered the civil rights struggle, and then The
New York Times, which sent him to Vietnam in 1962 to
cover the growing crisis there.
In 1964, when Halberstam was 30, he and Malcolm W.
Browne, of the AP. won Pulitzers for their coverage of the
war and the overthrow of the Saigon regime.
Halberstam later said he initially supported the U.S.
action there but became disillusioned.That was apparent
in his 1972 best-seller, "The Best and the Brightest," a
critical account of U.S. involvement in the region.
Neil Sheehan, former Saigon bureau chief for United
Press International and author of "A Bright Shining Lie,"
a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the war. recalled how
I lalberstam once called a general at home to get permis
sion to fly to the site of a U.S. defeat. At a briefing the next
day. a brigadier general scolded "pitiful, lowly young re
porters" for having the temerity to call a general at home.
"General, you do not understand," Halberstam re
sponded. according to Sheehan. "We are not corporals.
We do not work for y0u.... We will call a commanding
general any time at home we need to get our job done."
The general was flabbergasted, Sheehan said.
Halberstam "stayed the course and he kept the faith in
the belief in the people's right to know." said George
Esper, who spent 10 years in Vietnam with the AP and
was Saigon bureau chief when the city fell. "In the end,
and I think we can all be very proud of this, he was proven
right. Hie bottom line was that David was more honest
with the American public than their own government."

Halberstam quit daily journalism in 1967 and wrote 21
books covering topics such as foreign policy,civil rights and a
baseball pennant race. His 2002 best-seller,"War in a Time of
Peace ," was a runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction.
Halberstam's reporting from Vietnam was a major ir
ritant to the Kennedy administration, which had tried un
successfully to pressure the Times to transfer him from
the war zone.

Speaking at a journalism conference last year in Ten
nessee, he said government criticism of news reporters in
Iraq reminded him of how he was treated while covering
the war in Vietnam.
"The crueler the war gets, the crueler the attacks get
on anybody who doesn't salute or play the game." he said.
"And then one day, the people who are doing the attack
ing look around, and they've used up their credibility."

"And then one day, the people who are doing the attack
ing look around, and they've used up their credibility."

Menlo Park police investigate the scene of a fatal three-car accident Monday. David Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning journalist, who chronicled the Washington press corps, Vietnam and the world of sports, was killed in the crash.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - David Halberstam,a Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer who chronicled the Vietnam War
generation, civil rights and the world of sports, was killed
in a car crash Monday, his wife and local authorities said.
He was 73.
Halberstam, of New York, was a passenger in a car
that w;is broadsided by another vehicle in Menlo Park,
south of San Francisco. San Mateo County Coroner
Robert Foucrault said. The cause of death appeared to be
internal injuries, he said.
The accident occurred around 10:30 a.m.. and Halber
stam was declared dead at the scene. Menlo Park Fire
Chief I larold Schapelhouman said.
The driver of the car carrying Halberstam and the per
son driving the car that crashed into his were injured, but
not seriously
Halberstam was being driven by a graduate journal
ism student from the University of California, Berkeley,
which had hosted a speech by the author Saturday night
about journalism and what it means to turn reporting into
a work of history. They were headed to an interview he
had scheduled with Hall of Fame quarterback Y. A.Tittle.
Halberstam was working on a book. "The Game,"
about the 1958 NFL championship between the Balti
more Colts and the New York Giants, often called the
greatest game ever played,said his wife, Jean Halberstam.
She said she would remember him most for his "un
ending. bottomless generosity to young journalists."
"For someone who obviously was so competitive with
himself, the generosity with other writers was incredible."
she said.
In an interview earlier this month with The Associat
ed Press, Halberstam recalled the zeal with which he and
his colleagues covered Vietnam.
"Maybe we were 28, 29, 26 and we had a great story,
which we knew and we had a lock on the truth because we
had such great sources. When for a variety of reasons — a
flawed,deeply flawed policy — the government starts lying.

that is when independent journalism really matters," he said.
Such reporting, he said, is a key component of democ
racy.
"The idea that somewhere before it is a big story that
there is some young person ... putting themselves on the
line morally, ethically, journalistically, that is a great
thing," Halberstam said."l mean, that is what a free soci
ety is about."
As word of Halberstam's death spread, tributes and
remembrances poured in for the veteran reporter whose
baritone matched the heft of his nonfiction narratives.
"He was a dear friend," said author Gay Talese, who
was at the Halberstams' home Monday night and was
best man at his wedding.
Halberstam was born April 10,1934, in New York City
to a surgeon father and teacher mother. His father was in
the military, and Halberstam moved around the country
during his childhood, spending time in Texas. Minnesota
and Connecticut.
He attended Harvard University, where he was man
aging editor of the 1 larvard Crimson newspaper.
He launched his career in 1955 at the Daily Times
Leader in West Point. Miss. 1 le spent only a year there be
cause the editor at the time thought 1 ialberstam was too
liberal, said Bill Minor, the Jackson, Miss., bureau chief
for The Times-Picavune of New Orleans.
Minor remained friends for decades with Halberstam,
who he said was not afraid to wear his social conscience
on his sleeve.
Halberstam went on to The Tennessean, in Nashville,
where he covered the civil rights struggle, and then The
New York Times, which sent him to Vietnam in 1962 to
cover the growing crisis there.
In 1964, when Halberstam was 30, he and Malcolm W.
Browne, of the AP. won Pulitzers for their coverage of the
war and the overthrow of the Saigon regime.
Halberstam later said he initially supported the U.S.
action there but became disillusioned.That was apparent
in his 1972 best-seller, "The Best and the Brightest," a
critical account of U.S. involvement in the region.
Neil Sheehan, former Saigon bureau chief for United
Press International and author of "A Bright Shining Lie,"
a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the war. recalled how
I lalberstam once called a general at home to get permis
sion to fly to the site of a U.S. defeat. At a briefing the next
day. a brigadier general scolded "pitiful, lowly young re
porters" for having the temerity to call a general at home.
"General, you do not understand," Halberstam re
sponded. according to Sheehan. "We are not corporals.
We do not work for y0u.... We will call a commanding
general any time at home we need to get our job done."
The general was flabbergasted, Sheehan said.
Halberstam "stayed the course and he kept the faith in
the belief in the people's right to know." said George
Esper, who spent 10 years in Vietnam with the AP and
was Saigon bureau chief when the city fell. "In the end,
and I think we can all be very proud of this, he was proven
right. Hie bottom line was that David was more honest
with the American public than their own government."

Halberstam quit daily journalism in 1967 and wrote 21
books covering topics such as foreign policy,civil rights and a
baseball pennant race. His 2002 best-seller,"War in a Time of
Peace ," was a runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction.
Halberstam's reporting from Vietnam was a major ir
ritant to the Kennedy administration, which had tried un
successfully to pressure the Times to transfer him from
the war zone.

Speaking at a journalism conference last year in Ten
nessee, he said government criticism of news reporters in
Iraq reminded him of how he was treated while covering
the war in Vietnam.
"The crueler the war gets, the crueler the attacks get
on anybody who doesn't salute or play the game." he said.
"And then one day, the people who are doing the attack
ing look around, and they've used up their credibility."
