# Stepping to their own beat

Music and elaborate costumes might guide other forms of
dance, but as long as the Stanford Steppers have 10 fingers and
10 toes, they're all set.
Talk about resourcefulness: Quick hands and feet — mixed
with a contagious, explosive energy — were all the "Bomb
Squad" needed to impress prospective freshmen at last Fri
day's Black Community Welcome in Tresidder Union.
By combining clapping and stomping motions in exceeding
ly inventive ways, the Stanford Steppers have performed step,
a modern form of African dance, for audiences across campus
and in the local community since the team's founding in IWB.
According to co-director Shakisha O'Connor '07. the team was
created when two girls recognized the need for a low impact,
simple and unique activity amid the more serious a cappella
and dance groups around campus.
Members of the team are quick to differentiate what they
do from various forms of dance.
"1 don't consider us a dance group — 1 consider us a per
formance group," O'Connor said. "The thing is, there is some
level of skill needed for dancing and fluidity.The only thing re
quired for stepping is knowing how to coordinate your hands
and your feet.
"In step, a basic core of fundamental movements often un
derlies a seemingly complex performance. In place of the
pirouettes and contorted feats of flexibility that can character
ize other forms of dance, step uses the basic moves that seem to
characterize everyday human life: clapping and stomping. At
the heart of step is a tribute to rhythm and coordination.
"Going under the leg and clapping are pretty much the fun
damentals of stepping." continued O'Connor. "Other than
that, it's fair game for each step. There can be spinning, clapping
under someone else's leg. jumping, sliding... anything."
The prospect of keeping up with the Steppers' rapid rou
tines might seem daunting, but according to O'Connor,'Tf you
can stomp to a beat and remember a sequence, you can step."
ToTaualai Fonoti '06. the biggest distinguishing characteris
tic of step is that "you are both the dance and the accompany
ing music." Much of the enjoyment of watching a step perform
ance. after all,comes from listening to rhythms steppers create
for themselves: background music is entirely unnecessary.

"And unlike many other dances," noted Fonoti, "stepping is
an indication of how dynamic you are. It requires self-confi
dence and personal pride to step well."
While O'Connor has been stepping for almost 12 years, pre
vious experience is not necessary to he on the team. Nikki I lil!
*09 had never stepped before coming to Stanford, though she
had experience with jazz and tap dancing.
"1 was really nervous to try out," she admitted. "It took a
while to get the muscle memory — things like shifting your
weight correctly and getting used to the style of step."
The team of 16 steppers meets several times a week to dis
cuss upcoming events, review old steps and transition into
freshly choreographed routines.
O'Connor said that for her, the most challenging part of
being a Stepper was choreographing new routines.
"It's hard to find a way to keep the audience entertained."
she said, as she and co-director Chioma Anaebere '07 have to
come up with something innovative for every performance.
The team does not compete, according to O'Connor. "We're

trying to keep it a fun thing "she said."There's not a large num
ber of college step teams that are not Greek, so there's no av
enue for a regular college step team." Instead, the group focus
es on performances.
While O'Connor and fellow co-director. Anaebere. oversee
and coordinate choreography, all members of the team con
tribute to the process.
"In addition to making up steps ourselves." explained O'-
Connor. "during some practices we hold 'step workshops'
where the team splits up and makes up moves in small groups.
Ilien we put all the choreography together to make some in
teresting step routines."
Fonoti said that the Steppers' effectiveness as a group
comes not only from their choreography, but from the confi
dence and energy they exude onstage.
"Our audiences like us because they feel the high emotion
we put into our step." he said.

ty and energy. "The only thing required for stepping is knowing how to coordinate your hands and your feet," said one member.
