# Program lets users chat for charity
## Microsoft's instant messenging program to help non-profits 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The next time you whip out your "LOL"
and "GTG TTYL" chat lingo, it could he for a
charitable cause.
In March. Microsoft's instant messenging
(IM) client Windows Live Messenger
launched an initiative called "i'm," which sup
ports nine non-profit organizations. For every
IM sent using Windows Live Messenger. Mi
crosoft donates a portion of its advertising
revenue to charity. The more lMs. the more
money donated.
Here on campus. Microsoft Campus Mar
keting Ambassadors Ayo Jimoh "07 and Ar
mando Solis '09 are spreading the word.
"It's simple," said Jimoh. Once you down
load the latest version of Windows Live Mes
senger,"you just add a little tag to your screen
name that symbolizes the one of nine charities
you support." he explained. "There is no dif
ference to your chatting."
Jimoh. who also works as an ad salesperson
for The Daily, is supporting the National AIDS
Fund. Other non-profit organizations en

dorsed by the i'm initiative include American
Red Cross, Boys & Girls Clubs of America,
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, ninemil
lion.org. Sierra Club, Stopglobalwarming.org,
Susan G. Komen for the Cure and U.S. Fund
for UNICEF. According to the i'm initiative
website, each organization will receive a mini
mum of $100,000 at the end of the initiative's
first year, no matter how many I Ms are sent.
"[i'm is] a way for college students to give
to charity with their words instead of their
wallets," wrote Solis in an email to the Daily.
I le supports the American Red Cross.
"No other program [supportscharity] with
its IM client." Solis added.
How much will your individual IM conver
sations benefit the charities? The initiative's
Web site did not offer any specific answers.
"For competitive reasons, we can't share
the per-conversation amount of advertising
revenue that we will contribute," the Web site
reads. But the site is quick to assure users that
"every new conversation you have will lead to
money being donated to the cause you select."
Solis and Jimoh have been leaving flyers
and postcards explaining the i'm initiative
across campus. They are also hoping to con
nect with student groups,such as FACE AIDS.
'ITieir biggest marketing tactic so far. however,
has been going straight to dorms.
"We've been going door-to-door," said

Jimoh. "We're trying to get dorm contests to
gether where halls with the most downloads
would have their hall meeting food paid for."
As Microsoft Campus Marketing Ambas
sadors, Jimoh and Solis do receive a marketing
budget. If they also secure a certain number of
downloads, they will each receive a stipend.
Yet other students who aren't officially af
filiated with Microsoft are rallying behind the
i'm initiative. Nuritzi Sanchez '08 was one of
the first students to sign up. and now she is a
big advocate of the program.
"People use [IM] all the time — in class,
while procrastinating for homework. Why not
maximize utility by having those lMs [benefit]
the community in addition to serving you for
your own entertainment?" wrote Sanchez in
an email to the Daily. 1 ler charity of choice is
the Komen Fund.
Sanchez especially encourages students
with plans to study abroad to support i'm.
"While studying in Florence this past fall. I
realized that most Europeans use MSN to com
municate." she said. By supporting i'm,students
will be able to "network with people abroad,
maintain contact [and] make a difference."
Here or overseas, Jimoh encourages more
Stanford students to sign up for Windows Live
Messenger.
However, Sarah Johnson '09 said she thinks
the i'm initiative lacks pragmatism.

"To draw someone away from a popular
product like AIM, you'll need more incentive
than donating a few cents to charity," she said.
Johnson currently uses Adium hut has used
both AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and
older versions of MSN Messenger.
"There's also no value in switching [IM
clients] unless other people switch too," John
son added. "The only way that I can see i'm
succeeding is to make it a cross-platform chat
program."
Lauren I lofmayer'() ( ) agreed, and said that
she doesn't think she'll make the switch,
"liven though i'm is a good cause, I'm a devot
ed AIM user." she said. "I use IM to keep in
touch with my friends in college, and they all
use AOL."
Microsoft Campus Marketing Ambas
sadors have been keeping track of the number
of downloads for their schools.
"We're getting dominated by other schools,
like Vanderbilt," Jimoh said of Stanford.
"They might be bigger than us. but I don't
think they care more."
After all, this initiative is about charity —
hence the campaign's tagline: "i'm making a
difference."
