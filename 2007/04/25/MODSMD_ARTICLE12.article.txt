# Astronomers discover potentially habitable planet

### SETH BORENSTEIN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - For the
first time astronomers have discov
ered a planet outside our solar sys
tem that is potentially habitable,
with Earth-like temperatures, a find
researchers described Tuesday as a
big step in the search for "life in the
universe."
The planet is just the right size,
might have water in liquid form, and
in galactic terms is relatively nearby
at 120 trillion miles away But the
star it closely orbits, known as a "red
dwarf." is much smaller, dimmer and
cooler than our sun.
There's still a lot that is unknown
about the new planet, which could
be deemed inhospitable to life once
more is known about it. And it's
worth noting that scientists' require
ments for habitability count Mars in
that category: a size relatively simi
lar to Earth's with temperatures that
would permit liquid water. Howev
er. this is the first outside our solar
system that meets those standards.
"It's a significant step on the way
to finding possible life in the uni

verse." said University of Geneva
astronomer Michel Mayor.one of 11
European scientists on the team that
found the planet. "It's a nice discov
ery. We still have a lot of questions."
The results of the discovery have
not been published but have been
submitted to the journal Astronomy
and Astrophysics.
Alan Boss, who works at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington
where a U.S. team of astronomers
competed in the hunt for an Earth
like planet, called it "a major mile
stone in this business."
The planet was discovered by the
European Southern Observatory's
telescope in La Silla. Chile, which
has a special instrument that splits
light to find wobbles in different
wave lengths. Those wobbles can re
veal the existence of other worlds.
What they revealed is a planet
circling the red dwarf star. Gliese
581. Red dwarfs are low-energy, tiny
stars that give off dim red light and
last longer than stars like our sun.
Until a few years ago. astronomers
didn't consider these stars as possi
ble hosts of planets that might sus
tain life.

The discovery of the new planet,
named SSI c, is sure to fuel studies of
planets circling similar dim stars.
About 80 percent of the stars near
Earth are red dwarfs.
The new planet is about five times
heavier than Earth. Its discoverers
aren't certain if it is rocky like Earth
or if it's a frozen ice ball with liquid
water on the surface. If it is rocky
like Earth, which is what the prevail
ing theory proposes, it has a diame
ter about 1 1/2 times bigger than our
planet. If it is an iceball, as Mayor
suggests, it would be even bigger.
Based on theory, 581 c should
have an atmosphere, but what's in
that atmosphere is still a mystery
and if it's too thick that could make
the planet's surface temperature too
hot. Mayor said.
However, the research team be
lieves the average temperature to be
somewhere between 32 and 104 de
grees and that set off celebrations
among astronomers.
Until now, all 220 planets as
tronomers have found outside our
solar system have had the
"Goldilocks problem." They've
been too hot, too cold or just plain

too big and gaseous, like uninhabit
able Jupiter.
The new planet seems just right
— or at least that's what scientists
think.
"This could be very important."
said NASA astrobiology expert
Chris McKay, who was not part of
the discovery team."lt doesn't mean
there is life, but it means it's an
Earth-like planet in terms of poten
tial habitability."
Eventually astronomers will rack
up discoveries of dozens, maybe
even hundreds of planets consid
ered habitable, the astronomers
said. Hut this one — simply called
"c" by its discoverers when they talk
among themselves — will go down
in cosmic history as No. I.
Besides having the right temper
ature, the new planet is probably full
of liquid water, hypothesizes
Stephane Udry.the discovery team's
lead author and another Geneva as
tronomer. But that is based on theo
ry about how planets form, not on
any evidence, he said.
"Liquid water iscritical to life as
we know it." co-author Xavier
Delfosse of Grenoble I Jniversity in

France, said in a statement. '"Be
cause of its temperature and rela
tive proximity, this planet will most
probably be a very important tar
get of the future space missions
dedicated to the search for extra
terrestrial life. On the treasure map
of the Universe, one would be
tempted to mark this planet with
an X."
Other astronomers cautioned it's
too early to tell whether there is
water.
need more work to say it's
got water or it doesn't have water."
said retired NASA astronomer
Steve Maran. press officer for the
American Astronomical Society.
You wouldn't send a crew there as
suming that when you get there,
they II have enough water to get
back."
TTie new planet's star system is a
mere 20.5 light years away, making
Gliese 581 one of the 100 closest
stars to harth. It's so dim, you can't
see it without a telescope, but it's
somewhere in the constellation
Libra, which is low in the southeast
ern sky during the midevening iri the
Northern Hemisphere.
