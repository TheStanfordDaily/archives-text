# Ethanol poses hidden dangers
## Doubts surface about an alternative's future 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
A new study shows that develop
ing "green" fuel alternatives may put
those with asthma and other respira
tory diseases at a higher risk.
The research, which was devel
oped by Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson, in
dicates that more of the corrosive gas
ozone would be produced by the
combustion of ethanol than by the
combustion of gasoline.
"Ethanol is being promoted as a
clean and renewable fuel that will re
duce global warming and air pollu
tion." Jacobson said in a recent Los
Angeles Times article. "Hut our re
sults show that a high blend of
ethanol poses an equal or greater
risk to public health than gasoline,
which already causes significant
health damage."
The study specifically deals with

EB5. an alternative to gasoline which
is composed of 85 percent ethanol
and 15 percent gasoline.
According to Jacobson's report,
"under the base-case emission sce
nario derived, which accounted for
projected improvements in gasoline
and EB5 vehicle emission controls, it
was found that EB5 may increase
ozone-related mortality, hospitaliza
tion and asthma by about nine per
cent in Los Angeles and four percent
in the U.S. as a whole relative to 100
percent gasoline."
Still. Jacobson's research is open
to interpretation and debate.
"Almost anytime you do impact
assessment it's never a number; it's
always a range, especially for the fu
ture where we have no data," said Bi
ological Sciences Prof. Stephen
Schneider, a global warming expert
who has been a White House advisor
since the Nixon administration.
"I'm sure that he's right that
there's a significant health side ef
fect," Schneider added. "The difficul
ty when you do these [types of stud
ies is that] correlation is not neces
sarily causation. That doesn't mean

you can blow off the correlation."
Jacobson's research comes at a
time when ethanol is receiving wide
spread support as an alternative to
gasoline. President George W. Bush
and California state legislators have
both called for the production and
use of ethanol. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has also
expressed its support of EB5.
"The increased use of renewable
fuels, like EB5, will significantly re
duce greenhouse gas, benzene and
carbon monoxide emissions," said
EPA spokeswoman Jennifer Wood,
in the LA Times article.
Schneider said that he thought
encouraging the use of energy-effi
cient vehicles was a more effective
method of reducing greenhouse
gases than focusing on the produc
tion of ethanol and other "green"
fuel alternatives.
"Why don't they just stop those
big monsters?" Schneider said of
SUVs. "It's so much easier and
cheaper."
