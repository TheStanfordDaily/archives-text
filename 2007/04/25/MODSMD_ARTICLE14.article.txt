# Pro-life groups tackle 'media myths'
## Stud. for Life attend Bay Area conference 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Students for Life
(SSFL) and pro-life student groups
from other California universities
banded together at Belmont's Notre
Dame de Namur University on Sat
urday for the sixth annual Celebrate
Life Conference to learn more about
abortion and to dispel media myths
about pro-life views.
The conference, "Life. Camera.
Action!: Myths and the Media," fea
tured workshops and guest speeches
by notable pro-life activists, includ
ing University of Southern Califor
nia obstetrician Thomas Goodwin.
Participants were exposed to sev
eral aspects of the pro-life position.

including medical decisions and pro
life feminism, as well as common
media distortions, said SSFL Execu
tive Advisor Noelle Patno '07 in an
email to The Daily.
"The audience gained inspiration
and motivation from personal stories
of saving lives through pro-life ac
tivism." Patno said. "Resources and
ideas to be more effective in spread
ing the message about life issues and
in encouraging pregnancy resources
for women, among other helpful ac
tions. provided great take-away tools
to the participants."
Goodwin spoke about pregnant
women who were encouraged by
doctors to have abortions.
"He explained that, while most
doctors are not politically influenced,
some doctors encourage abortions
due to legal incentives," Patno said.
"Even if there is a small chance of
complications, these doctors feel the
need to discuss these options in order
to avoid being charged with a wrong

ful birth later. However, there ap
pears to be no 'wrongful abortion.'"
Goodwin highlighted the need for
people to get second and third opin
ions in order to make well-informed
decisions about the livelihood of
their children, said former SSFL co-
President Daniel Cervantes '07.
According to Patno, Goodwin
concluded that supporters of partial
birth abortions incorrectly frame the
procedure as necessary to protect a
women's health when such abortions
actually pose health risks.
"Too often, women are encour
aged to have abortions without all the
medical facts," Patno said. "The fetus
is not consistently treated as a pa
tient, which leads to inconsistencies
in care, from surgery done to correct
problems the unborn human may
have while in the womb to surgery
performed to destroy the human."
