diverse."
Last year's tech-heavy projects in
cluded renovating old computer

year.
"We have around 250 applicants

applying for 75 spots." said SEALNet
co-President Viet Minh Huynh '07.
Group leaders also said that many
of this year's project leaders will have
valuable experience in the region.
"Almost all of the leaders from the
past projects have returned to lead
