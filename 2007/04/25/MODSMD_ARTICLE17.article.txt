## Editorial Board Kenney suspension inadequate 
### 
On Friday. Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby announced that men's
swimming coach Skip Kenney will
serve a suspension of (S() days without pay for
punitively deleting the records of five for
mer swimmers. While Kenney has uncondi
tional! \ apologized and taken responsibility
for his actions, the suspension seems like a
slap on the wrist.out of sync with the serious
ness of his intentionally committed offense.
Assuming that Kenney begins serving
the suspension this week, he will be able to
return no later than July, just in time to host
his supposedly optional summer training
camp. Since the team is also currently out of
season, it is likely that his absence will have
a minimal impact. Kenney did have to miss
coaching the team at the NCAA champi
onships while the investigation was under
way. but the new suspension will have little
additional weight other than his loss of two
months of salary.
Perhaps this was intentional. Many cur
rent team members whom we have inter
viewed are happy to have Kenney return
("Kenney will stay." April 23). and an April
3 letter to the editor was submitted by a long
list of swimming alumni in support of retain
ing Kenney. Add this to his record of success
— and the conclusion in Bowlsby's investi
gation that Kenney did not violate any
NCAA regulations — and the decision not
to fire him is at the verv least understand

able. Bowlsby and the Athletic Department
have an interest in maintaining Stanford's
dominance in men's swimming. Kenney
says he is sorry, and it would be incredibly
surprising if he were ever to make similarly
poor choices in the future.
Ihe problem is that Kenney's actions
and the relatively light suspension both re
flect poorly on a university where academ
ics actually do come first. Kenney knowing
ly and maliciously removed the records of
swimmers lie was not getting along with,
and only admitted to doing so once he had
already been caught. Some of those affected
and their families are still calling for Ken
ney's resignation or firing, even if the cur
rent team and many alumni think the man is
a great coach.
Ihough we will not go as far as to say
Kenney should have been fired, a two
month off-season suspension is inadequate.
At a minimum. Kenney should be required
to take actions to reconcile with the young
men he tried to eliminate from the books.
I - veil if this is ultimately impossible, his
penance should go further than simply apol
ogizing meekly and laying low. Kenney's
petty and underhanded actions were com
mitted by someone in a position of trust, a
position strengthened by his long tenure. A
60-dav suspension without pay does not do
enough to express that such behavior will
not be tolerated in the future.
