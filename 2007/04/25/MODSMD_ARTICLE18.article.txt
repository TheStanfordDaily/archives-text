# I just don't think this is working out

The air was tense and brittle, like a
sal tine cracker. Heads of sweat trick
led down my face, alighting on my
cashmere sweater, staying as long as they
could before the soft fabricenveloped them
in a bittersweet embrace.
I lie room was red hot, but my chair w as
ice-cold. And I found the words escaping
from my lips:"We need to talk."
Ol course. I was speaking in that code
that all dejected lovers know, that eu
phemistic softening that marks an attempt
at delicacy at the end of something beauti
ful. I was overcome by a wave of melan
choly, and could not raise my eyes.
"1...1 just.. I just don't think it can work
out." I burst forth.
I le sat silently I saw the hint of a tear in
the corner of his bright blue eyes.
"I just think we should keep our options
open," I continued, sheepishly digging the
toe of my shoe into the carpet. 'Hie tear
leaked from the piping of his brow.
"So." I said, "do you want to tell every
one, or should I?"
After a prolonged and painful silence,
pregnant with unspoken meaning, he mum
bled, "Well, it's probably best if I told them
myself."
And it was decided: we would both be
OK with a triple next year.
"Drawma." they call it: drama resulting
directly from the awkwardness of choosing
a draw group. I had had my first taste, and it
1 elt remarkably similar to a rather uncom
fortable lovers' spat.
Who would have thought I would be
saying these things in a room filled with
nine guys, looking at the ground and talking
about housing options?
Yes. there were nine of us, and there are
eight spots in the typical group. We had to
let someone go. but we had to make sure we
could "just be friends" afterwards.

of the world rested on our shoulders. Feel

No matter that we could probably just
ride our bikes over to see each other next
year without much trouble (unless, for
some reason, one of us wanted to live in

friends anyway, or that we would still have
a chance of being together in classes.
We needed to figure this out. we needed
to find out immediately how we would split
this monster of a draw group. Someone had
the idea of splitting up into roommate pairs,
and we seized on it. But oh. cruel fate, you
knew all too well the disastrous path down
which we were heading at this point.
We decided to categorize our music
tastes, our sleeping habits, and our girlfriend
situations. I needed someone who shares my
somewhat sarcastic passion for 1980s glam
rock, who understands that occasionally, a
man must wake up at 4 a.m. (to do l)l)R. of
course) and go to bed at 10 a.m. I needed a
roommate who would be up for a bit of wife
