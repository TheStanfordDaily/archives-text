Biased photo frustrates
I was disappointed to learn that 'Ilie
Daily used a proudly and openly anti-Israel
photographer to cover the Israeli Indepen
dence Day celebration. As a consequence of
this, the picture in Tuesday's Daily unsur
prisingly showed the protestors rather than
the event itself. Ilie photographer in ques
tion not only advertised the protest on dorm
chat-lists (including my own), but also re
peatedly posts strong, offensive anti-Israel
remarks through chat-lists and through
comments on online Daily articles. Mem
bers of his current and former dorms have
complained about the offensive and ad
hominem nature of his anti-Israel diatribes.
I urge Ilie Daily to take more care in de
termining which reporters and photogra
phers cover political events in the future.

Alter such a successful celebratory event, it
is a shame to see all ol the focus on a small
group of protestors, especially when that
focus is determined by a photographer who
is partial to those protestors.

Editor's Note The photographer in question,
who is normally assigned to the sports desk
and had not been assigned to shoot the Israeli
Independence Day Celebration, did not tell
his editors that he had advertised the protest
on dorm chat lists or that he was involved
with pro-Palestinian groups on campus, al
though he disputes being "proudly and open
ly anti-Israel. Ihe Daily would not have run
his protest photos as staff-produced content
if editors knew about his involvement with
the protest.
