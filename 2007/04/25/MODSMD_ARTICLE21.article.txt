# Dante's ninth circle of Dell
## 
### 
This morning, in the middle of writing
my first paper of the quarter, my com
puter died. Well, died is such a positive
word for what my computer did. It started
rather innocuously with keys peeling off like
an anemic old lady's fingernails. I grew more
concerned when the frayed power charger
snapped its last taut wire.'lhen, in a brilliant
vote of absolute loathing, the motherboard
cracked itsell neatly in half right in front of
my very eyes.
I was astonished and bewildered by the
display —but strangely, the nice people at
Dell didn't seem surprised. At all.
I immediately called them (after three
years and countless replaced parts with my
cantankerous old computer. Dell's technical
support is number eight on my speed dial),
wrangled through the nine circles of voice
menu hell and when my customer service
representative finally dared to chirp out his
smug,"l li. how are you doing?" on the other
line. I took a deep breath and let it fly:
"I'm pretty okay, thanks. I low're you ?"
Yes. I somehow managed to keep it togeth
er and refrain from venting my anguished ac
ademic woes on the guy. I gritted my teeth
and was polite. After all, he knows and I
know that he works for a company that gets
its kicks out of screwing over the general
populace — what's the use in rubbing it in?
And while I will admit there may or may not
be a dent in my wall roughly the size and
shape of some pretty swollen knuckles, that's
neither here nor there. Amazingly, after
twenty minutes 011 the line he had shipped
out a new adapter and scheduled a same-day
service call. If I had asked nicely, he probably
would have sent over a Band-Aid for my
hand too. It's amazing what a nice warranty
you can afford if you divert funds awav from

product quality.
Once upon a time, in my callous youth. I
must admit I probably would not have met
the same situation with such grace. But my
mother always told me that you catch more
flies with honey than with vinegar. I person
ally find this to be an absurd adage (what
would a girl want with a fly — unless, of
course, it's attached to Adam Brody's jeans),
but the general notion makes a fair amount
of sense: it's nice to be nice, and sometimes it
gets your poor overworked computer a life
line to boot.
I think it's fair to say that most of us, at
some point or other, have had a nasty run-in
with a salesperson or technical support work
er. If you're already having a rough day and
get a defective product or inane corporate
policy thrown in the mix, well, something's
got to give. Sure, it may not be an employee's
fault, but if he didn't want to get yelled at,
why is he working for such a corrupt organi
zation? And why does he have such an ugly
face?!
During my brief but glamorous stint
working retail at a Hollywood Video, I was
on the opposite side of this exchange more
than a few times. Nary a day would pass with
out some distinguished customer, fresh off
the crippling disappointment of discovering
his favorite Tom Selleck film was checked

out, chucking an empty DVD cover at my
head and snarling that he was going to start
renting at Blockbuster. You can imagine our
chagrin.
I'very once in a while, some particularly
valued customer would ratchet it up a few
notches just to keep us on our toes. The gen
tleman, ior instance, who came in on a busy
Saturday night and waltzed straight up to the
counter. When I suggested he get in line, he
graciously elbowed a box of ballpoint pens
on the floor, whipped out his cell phone and
called the corporate office, all while snarling,
"1 can get you fired" — something 1 did not
know happened in real life.
But lor every customer service horror
story, there are a few genuinely pleasant ex
changes. Warm greetings, people who ask
how you are like they really care, possibly
even a thank you afterwards? If you stop and
count them, the number of exchanges we
have with anonymous shop clerks is ab
solutely staggering, and each one has the po
tential to be a pleasant interlude in the lives
of everyone involved. It's not that hard to be
nice to a stranger for five minutes, and if
you re having a terrible day, it might just fool
you into feeling a little better.
Hie guv I talked to at Dell, for example:
His name is Ryan, he's really psyched that
the Red Sox beat the Yankees, and once in
college he had a computer die on him just
like mine (albeit slightly less dramatically).
By the time he told me to have a nice dav. I
actually felt like I might.

K m doesn I really hate Dell products, she just
wishes her computer would coordinate its
work schedule with hers Send condolences
