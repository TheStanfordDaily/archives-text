# My first (borrowed) suit
## 
### 
I can still remember how uncomfortable I
felt the first time 1 wore a tie. I was proba
bly three years old and it was over i(X) de
grees outside. Ilierc I was, looking like a
complete goon, wearing a useless piece of
cloth around my neck that was both ugly and
deadly. To the outside observer I was not a
goon, but "a cute little boy who looks all
grown-up." Internally I was at the very limit
of my tolerance for discomfort, as demon
strated by my constipated facial expression
in the family photo. litis marked the begin
ning of my aversion to a professional dress
code.
Fast-forward to the present day. It was a
Ibursday night and I was frantically search
ing forasuit because I had a job interview the
next morning. I had never owned a suit, nor
had I ever wanted to own a suit, so the irony
of this frantic search was killing me. I finally
got mv hands on a suit that fit and arrived at

my interview only to discover the non-profit
company encouraged a "casual" work envi
ronment. ()nce again, there I was. feeling and
looking like a goon while my interviewers,
comfortable in their jeans, asked me about
my work experience. I quickly exaggerated
my computer skills ("Yeah. I write a column,
I must know how to type...") and walked out
of the interview pondering why I felt com
pelled to dress as if I worked on Wall Street.

M\ compulsion was obviously founded in
the idea that appearance is everything. In
order to be a professional, you need to dress
like one. At least that's what corporate
America and the Men's Wcarhousc, want
you to think.
.. I)o "! ct mc wron g. I'm all about looking
nice. I wear button-downs and slacks, and
VC C v»n S rown an affinity for ties over the
years. When I need to. I sport the fanciest of
rented tuxedos or the bluest of blazers. My
closet is filled with formal wear.The only dis
tinction is that my "formal wear" was pur
chased at Savers and smells like diapers.
Hut a suit is something completely differ
en A suit represents management.corpora
tions and politics. In fact, "suit" is synony
mous with Ihe Man. It is for these reasons -
and the tact that many suits cost as much as

my entire wardrobe — that I have
resisted the need to buy one. Why
do I need to wear trousers that per
fectly match a coat? Does that real
ly make me more professional?
Apparently, some businesses
agree with me. Lowering the dress
code is becoming a common trend
in many work places, and not just
for Hawaiian-shirt Fridays. After
all, the effects of comfort on per
formance are not to be underesti
mated. 1 don't know about you, but
when 1 go to take a final exam, 1 do
not wear a suit. 1 wear comfortable

clothing that is going to minimize
wedgies, pit stains, and other gar
ment distractions. Sure, a suit helps
you appear more professional on
the outside, but perhaps you are so
worried about spilling coffee on
your overpriced articles of clothing
that you are distracted from the
task at hand. Meanwhile. Mr. Com
fortable Joe. wearing soft cords and
a dress shirt, is feeling good and
working hard.
As 1 walked through the streets
of San Francisco in my borrowed
suit. 1 knew the casually dressed ar
chitects, cafe owners and non-prof
it employees were laughing at me. I
was so ashamed that 1 took off my
coat and hoped they didn't notice
it matched my pants perfectly. 1 re
turned to mv room and hurried to

take off the suit, hoping 1 would
never have to wear it again. Before
I could take off The Man. 1 re
ceived a call from the company
with which I had just interviewed;
they offered me a job. I was
shocked. It couldn't have been the
suit, could it? Whether it was the
suit or my exaggerated computer
skills. I will never know. What I do
know is that a suit will always re
main the standard of professional
dress, despite what 1 think. 1 just
hope 1 can remove the diaper smell
from the suit I will soon purchase
at Savers.
