## The best day of the NFL
### 
The best day of the NFL cal
endar is upon us.
The first three rounds of the
league's annual draft are set to
commence from Radio City Music
Hall in New York City this Satur
day, carried over the airwaves to
millions of homes nationwide by
ESPN and the NFL Network.
Once the last pick of the sev
enth round is announced on Sun
day, the experts will mull over the
results for days and pick the win
ners and losers — seemingly at
random — as every writer, radio
host and sports desk talking head
tries to predict the most unpre
dictable of all transitions in sport.
Because, in truth, not all of the
college stars of yesterday will soon
be the NFL stars of today. To be
sure, there will be plenty of Ail-
Americans who will flop and plen
ty of collegiate nobodies who will
go on to dominate Sunday games
for a decade. There are every year.
But that is only a part of what
makes the annual NFL Draft so in
triguing, and it is the part most dif
ficult to predict. Analysts and
league personnel who spend
months studying each year's par
ticular muddle of university talent
still make mistakes, and they make
them quite often.
That's whv it's futile to try and
