## The 						best day of the NFL 
### 
The best day of the NFL cal
endar is upon us.
The first three rounds of the
league's annual draft are set to
commence from Radio City Music
Hall in New York City this Satur
day, carried over the airwaves to
millions of homes nationwide by
ESPN and the NFL Network.
Once the last pick of the sev
enth round is announced on Sun
day, the experts will mull over the
results for days and pick the win
ners and losers — seemingly at
random — as every writer, radio
host and sports desk talking head
tries to predict the most unpre
dictable of all transitions in sport.
Because, in truth, not all of the
college stars of yesterday will soon
be the NFL stars of today. To be
sure, there will be plenty of Ail-
Americans who will flop and plen
ty of collegiate nobodies who will
go on to dominate Sunday games
for a decade. There are every year.
But that is only a part of what
makes the annual NFL Draft so in
triguing, and it is the part most dif
ficult to predict. Analysts and
league personnel who spend
months studying each year's par
ticular muddle of university talent
still make mistakes, and they make
them quite often.
That's whv it's futile to try and

anal\ze the NFL's yearly pick em
contest: because no matter how
hard you try. you'll still he wrong
— and quite often. It's also a fool
ish exercise because, really, the
draft can tell us so much more
about teams as they stand now
than it can about the incoming
rookies each year.
Depending upon which teams
pick which players and how fre
quently various positions are ad
dressed. fans league-wide should
have a better idea of where their
team and its rivals stand — and
they'll know it almost immediate
ly.
With that said, here are some
intriguing storylines to watch this
weekend:
Just how nuts is Al?
Raiders boss Al Davis has been
long noted for making savvy per
sonnel decisions that at one time
made the Oakland/Los Angeles
franchise among the best in the
NFL. But recently, the mastermind
has seemingly slipped.
After sending Jon Ciruden
packing to Tampa Bay, the Raiders
lost the following Super Bowl to
the Buccaneers, along with their
former coach. The Silver and
Black has been on a downward
spiral ever since, and holds the first
overall pick in this year's draft.
With most experts predicting
the selection of talented LSU
quarterback Jamarcus Russell, the
question remains: Would Al really
go for the hands-down best overall
player in the draft. Georgia Tech
receiver Calvin Johnson, instead?
Conventional wisdom says the
Raiders should take the quarter
back and be happy, but Davis has
never been a conventional guy. If
Al opts for Johnson in the first
round. Oakland could be a viable
destination for former Stanford
signal-caller Trent Edwards in the
second.
Has moneyball arrived on the grid
iron?
With the way the salary cap and
draft are in the NFL. top picks are
gradually becoming less and less
desirable for many teams.
Although a higher pick might

give a franchise the chance to se
lect a player it would rather have,
it also means paying that pick
more — a lot more. And under the
rules of the salary cap. paying a
draft bust big money is definitely
not an attractive option.
The fear of being wrong on a
prospect and stuck paying his fat
contract may have severely limited
trading near the top of the first
round in recent years. The last
truly blockbuster trade probably
came in 2004 when the Giants
traded up with the Chargers to ac
quire quarterback Eli Manning.
But the results there haven't
encouraged future swaps. Man
ning hasn't developed as quickly
as hoped, while the Chargers got
rich off of the bundle of picks they
received in return.
The Pacman Effect
Commissioner Roger Goodell's
new policy on dealing with NFL
troublemakers could influence
teams to stay away from prospects
with character concerns.
While this particular draft
would appear to be filled with
mostly solid citizens near the top,
guys like California runner Mar
shawn Lynch, Miami safety Bran
don Meriweather and UNLV cor
ner Eric Wright could all fall well
below where their first-round cal
iber talents would indicate.
Devil May Care Danny
Other than Davis (perhaps the
NFL's most controversial owner).
Daniel Snyder of the Washington
Redskins will probably be the
most scrutinized commander-in
chief in the league.
Under Snyder, the Redskins
have demonstrated a general dis
dain for the draft, and the team will
reap the consequences this year
after trading away numerous selec
tions over the years. After Wash
ington's first pick, at No. 6 overall.
Danny-boy will have to wait until
the fifth round to pick again.
All the more laughable, then,
are recent rumors that the 'Skins
would love to trade up and acquire
Johnson.' If it wanted the flexibili
ty to make a move like that, the
team shouldn't have held onto its
own picks — it should have been
working to acquire others a long
time ago.
