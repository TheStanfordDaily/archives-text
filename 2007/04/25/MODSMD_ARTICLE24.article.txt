# Card opens home stretch with 11-8 loss
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's pitching woes continued last night in
another marathon at Sunken Diamond. Two days
after being blown out by California, Stanford again
gave up double-digit runs in a loss to San Jose State.
The 11-8 loss — which clocked in at just under
four hours — was the Cardinal's first home loss to the
Spartans (25-17, 4-7 Western Athletic Conference)
since 2000. Stanford (16-21, 2-10 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), who beat San Jose State 8-3 in March, entered
last night's meeting with an eight-game win streak
over the Spartans dating back to 2002.
The Cardinal staff gave up 18 hits for the second
straight game, and seven of them came in a six-run
fifth inning. Stanford's team ERA is now up to 6.16
for the season, over a full run higher than its 4.55

mark from a year ago.
"It's frustrating, obviously," freshman reliever
Brandt Walker said of the pitching problems. "(As a
staff.] we can't think,' I need to keep us to two or three
runs in a start or I can't give up any runs here,' be
cause then you don't have the mentality or attack
needed to be successful."
The Spartans offense caught fire in the fifth with
back-to-back singles off junior righthander David
Stringer (0-2), setting the table for Donato Givonat
to. Entering the game with a team-high .368 batting
average, Giovanatto (2-4,2 RBI) smacked a two-run
triple to the wall in left-center. San Jose State then
tied the game at 5-5 on a single through the middle of
the infield by Kyle Bellows.

ting out of the inning, down 8-5.
"That one big inning killed us."
head coach Mark Marquess said. "We
didn't make any errors or walk any
body. we just couldn't stop them."
Junior righty Nolan Gallagher
could not find the strike zone in the
sixth inning, walking Bellows and
throwing a wild pitch with the bases
loaded to score Marcus McKimmy (4-
6.2 R). Karson Klauer finished off the
Spartans' scoring with an RBI single to
rightfield.stretching the lead to 11-5.
Things on the mound finally settled
down for Stanford when Walker made
his third appearance in 21 games.

Walker, relying on curveballs and fast
balls. pitched 2.2 scoreless innings, sur
rendering only one hit and striking out
the side in the eighth.
"When you look at our success, a lot
of it is keeping the hall down." Walker
said. "Most of the time, if you throw
low strikes, you can get outs."
The Cardinal jumped out to a two
run lead with four groundballs in the
first. With men on first and third and
one out, sophomore designated hitter
Joey August hit a single up the middle
to score sophomore centerfielder
Sean Ratliff (4-5, 3 R). In one of the
few bright spots for the Cardinal.
Ratliff set a new career-high with four
hits in the game.
Inheriting a 5-1 deficit from starter
Spencer Snodgrass, Brandon Hen
nessey (4-0) scattered four hits and
three runs over five innings for the win.
Down 11-5 in the bottom of the
sixth inning. Stanford got two runs

back on a single through the right side
of the infield by junior Adam Sorgi.On
the play, first baseman McKimmy and
second baseman klauer collided head
first in a freakish play as both lunged at
the ball.
Both players would stay in the
game on defense, but things turned
scary after the game. Klauer. who was
removed for a pinch hitter, required
the attention of paramedics due to re
ported problems with breathing and
passing in and out of consciousness.
Stanford continues its stretch of six
games in eight days with an afternoon
make-up game against Fresno State
(25-19,11-4 WAC).

"It was a tough loss, where we had
the lead, and I think it's good to come
back and play [as soon as possible]
Marquess said. "This time of the year,
it's better than practicing."
The Cardinal took both games in a
rain-shortened series against the Bull
dogs — 9-2 and 6-4 in a Sunday dou
bleheader — for Stanford's first two
season wins at home. Fresno State en
ters the game off a 9-1 loss to Santa
Clara last night.
First pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m.
today at Sunken Diamond.

Stanford continues its stretch of six
games in eight days with an afternoon
make-up game against Fresno State
(25-19,11-4 WAC).

"It was a tough loss, where we had
the lead, and I think it's good to come
back and play [as soon as possible]
Marquess said. "This time of the year,
it's better than practicing."
The Cardinal took both games in a
rain-shortened series against the Bull
dogs — 9-2 and 6-4 in a Sunday dou
bleheader — for Stanford's first two
season wins at home. Fresno State en
ters the game off a 9-1 loss to Santa
Clara last night.
First pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m.
today at Sunken Diamond.
