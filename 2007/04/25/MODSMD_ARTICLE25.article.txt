## Clinic brings together local coaches 
### BY CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON 
More than 50 bay area high
school and junior college
coaches assembled in the Ar
rillaga Family Sports Center
on Friday and Saturday for a
coaches' clinic hosted by the Cardinal foot
ball program. The event featured access to
two Cardinal practices and speeches by suc
cessful football coaches in the region.
Hie afternoon opened with a dinner at
Jimmy V's Sports Cafe where Jim Harbaugh
int roduced his coaching staff and offered the
program's knowledge to the area's high
school coaches. The staff uniformly ex
pressed the privilege of coaching at Stanford
and vowed to turn the program around.
1 larbaugh pointed out football alumni in
the room and paid special attention to a
member of the 1939 and 1940 Stanford
teams. After finishing 1 -7-1. the previous sea
son. the "Wow Boys" of 1940 went 10-0 and
beat Nebraska in the Rose Bowl. Harbaugh
said he hopes for a comparable turnaround
this season.
Ken Peralta from Marin Catholic High
School gave an energetic speech on building
character in a football program, and the
nightcap address was given by Dave Adolph,
a 21-year coaching veteran of the NFL.
Adolph served for two years as defensive
coordinator under Harbaugh at the Univer
sity of San Diego, spearheading a dramatic
improvement in the Toreros'defense. His 90-
minute address began with a discussion of
man-to-man defensive principles and ex
panded into a seminar on evaluating players.
1 le espoused a comprehensive grading sys
tem for players' game performances that en
courages honesty, accountability and a de
sire for improvement.
"Even if it's bad. they love getting their
grade sheet on Monday," Adolph
said.
The event did not go off without a
hitch but still ran smoothly The rain
cancelled Thursday practice was
moved to Friday afternoon, forcing
the clinic schedule back.
