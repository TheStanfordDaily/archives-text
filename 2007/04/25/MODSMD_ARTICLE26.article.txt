Stanford Softball notched 1 1 hits and allowed no earned runs to San Jose State
last night. Stanford next hosts Arizona State this Friday at home.
this season for the Cardinal (30-13,5-7 Pacific-10
Conference).
The Stanford offense generated 11 hits
against the Spartans (21 -24,6-9 Western Athlet
ic Conference). The Cardinal scored early with
one run in the second inning on a sacrifice fly by
senior left fielder Jackie Rinehart that drove in
sophomore Maddy Coon, who had led off the in
ning with a single to left.
It was the first of three straight run-producing
innings for the Cardinal. The team broke out for
three runs in the next frame for a 4-0 lead.
Coon grabbed the RBI this time, singling to
center field with runners on first and third to
score freshman Michelle Schroeder, a pinch-run
ner for junior third baseman Michelle Smith.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill then smacked a
single to left to score junior first baseman Erin
Howe. Coon then scored on a single by second
baseman Tricia Aggabao, although Neill and Ag
gabao both managed to get tagged out at second
in the play.
I"he Cardinal added one more run in the top
of the fourth. Freshman centerfielder Alissa
Haber reached first on a walk, and freshman
shortstop Shannon Koplitz doubled Haber
home.
Penna and Stanford had some nervous mo
ments in the fifth when two hit batters and a pair
of errors by Koplitz and Smith gifted three runs
to the Spartans.Those three unearned runs made
the game close at 5-3.
By that time, Spartans pitcher Roxanne Be
jarano had settled down and handcuffed the
Stanford offense. Her efforts would prove to be

irrelevant, however, as Penna retired the side in
order in the sixth inning and allowed only one hit
in the seventh to close out the Stanford win.
Haber went hitless on the night, snapping an
11-game hitting streak, the longest active streak
among Pac-10 players.
Stanford returns to action this weekend when
it hosts Arizona State on Friday evening before
playing a pair against Arizona.
