Last year. Stanford en
tered the seeond round
of the Pacific-10 ('onfer
ence women's golf cham
pionships in fifth place
and ended it in eighth. The
team would eventually fin
ish a disappointing seventh
out of 10 schools.
But yesterday the
Cardinal experienced deja
vu at Seattle in a dismal
second round that

dropped the team three spots,from
fourth to seventh (309-315 —624).
Top-ranked Arizona State
(597) continues to lead the field,
seven strokes ahead of No. 11
UCLA (604). No. 15 Arizona (613)
jumped up to third while No. 6
Southern California (614) dropped
two spots to fourth.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
sophomore Mari Chun's play re
mained consistent. Chun contin
ued her strong play from the first
round and held onto second place
individually (71-73 —144), four
strokes behind ASU's Anna
Nordqvist (140). Once again. Chun
is pacing the Stanford squad, after
finishing I Ith overall in last year's
