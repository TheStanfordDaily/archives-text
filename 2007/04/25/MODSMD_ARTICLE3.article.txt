# Kenney inquiry raises questions
## Alumni who had records deleted weren't consulted by Bowlsby 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Skip Kenncy may have
been away from the Stan
ford pool after allegations
of misconduct, hut for the
past month and a half, the
head men's swimming
coach was in hot water
during an investigation by
Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby.
Friday's announce-

nient to suspend Kenney for 60 days, with
out pay, concluded that investigation. But
the Athletics Department's conduct, along
with the decisions made by iis leadership,
are being questioned by the swimmers and
parents at the heart of the record-deletion
scandal that drew national attention. The
Athletics Department and several current
swimmers are defending the process as fair
and the sanction as just.
Off the blocks
Kenney was first approached about the
removal of swimmers' records from the
2006-2007 media guide by The Daily. On
Mar. 8. Kenney first denied any wronedo-

ing before admitting later the same day
that he had deleted records of swimmers he
had fallings out with.
Bowlsby immediately put Kenney on in
definite suspension and promised an inves
tigation. I'he first-year athletic director
called the situation "a matter of maintain
ing the integrity of the University's record"
and "something that all of us have responsi
bility for."
Out of the woodwork came allegations
beyond Kenney's public deletions of five
swimmers' records. Numerous sources re
vealed issues with NCAA compliance and
told stories of strained relations and fur
ther conflicts with a coach described as
strict and militant.
The Athletics Department received let
ters. emails, faxes and phone calls from a
variety of people about the long-time
coach. With the flood of comments and sto
ries pouring in. Bowlsby needed to decide
how investigators should deal with the nu
merous people involved in Kenney's 28
years on the Farm.
Into the depths
Bowlsby told The Daily that the large
volume of information had to be centered
around upon three focused points that
would determine Kenney's eventual pun
ishment. Those points were the expunged
records, potential violations of NCAA


Kenney
voluntary training rules and alleged
strains in coach-athlete relations.
Although the first of the three was left
for little interpretation (Bowlsby said
Kenney's actions showed "'a serious lack
ot judgment" in his Friday announce
ment), the latter two required looking for
the input of many more people, including
current and former swimmers, alumni and
parents.
Current swimmer Paul Kornfeld. a
sophomore, described the Cardinal men
being approached by Bowlsby.
its a tough situation, but we came to
gether and showed our support of Skip,"
kornfeld said. "I'm not sure how much in
fluence it had. but he took all our concerns
into consideration."
Senior captain Ben Wildman-Tobriner
noted that Bowlsby understood the im
portance of current swimmers' input, be
cause "as swimmers, we have the most im
portant angle on how Skip is as a coach."
Waiting back on deck
While current team members who will
still swim for Kenney said they were ap
proached, it appears that the former
swimmers who had their records deleted
the very people who prompted the re
view — were barely, if at all. consulted
during the process.
Both Michael McLean '06 and Peter
Carothers "08 told The Daily they were
not contacted by the Athletics Depart
ment. While senior associate athletic di
rector Earl Koberlein told The Daily on
Tuesday that all the swimmers "had a
voice" during the investigation, he ac
knowledged that the input of Carothers
and McLean was, in fact, limited to previ
ous complaints made by the pair.
"We did not talk with him." Koberlein
said of Carothers, "But we were aware of
his gripes and the problems he had with
Skip."
According to Koberlein. Carothers'
history included his dismissal from the
team and previous documented incidents
between him and Kenney. Still,Carothers
was disappointed by the way the review
was handled.
"If they had contacted me," Carothers
said, "it would have been a full. 100-per
cent investigation, which the University
had promised from the start."
Similarly. McLean's input came in the
form of over 40 pages of material mailed
by his parents. Mike and Diane McLean

said they were troubled by the lack of ac
knowledgement they received from Stan
ford athletics. The couple said they never
contacted by anyone at the University,
and they did not even receive a confirma
tion that the materials they sent were re
ceived.
"It would have been common courtesy
to acknowledge that they received our
mailings and were taking them into con
sideration," said Diane McLean.
Koberlein and Bowlsby confirmed that
their materials were considered. As for ac
knowledgement, Bowlsby said the
McLeans "were not contacted because 1
didn't believe there was anything more to
be gathered from them, other than what
we had received."
The three remaining swimmers were
contacted by the Athletics Department,
but only one, Richard Eddy '06, did not re
spond. The Daily was also unable to reach
Eddy for comment.
Breaking past the surface
As for those who were reached. Jason
Plummer '92 and Tobias Oriwol '06 were
given the chance to offer their two cents.
In a candid interview with The Daily,
Plummer described an hourlong phone
conversation with Koberlein.
Outspoken about his many issues with
Kenney, Plummer said that he felt his side
of the story was taken seriously, but "at no
stage did I feel my testimony or anything I
said was going to get Skip Kenney fired."
Angry testimony like Plummer's was
not alone in the investigation, according
to Koberlein.
But Bowlsby noted that "the majority
[of input] was highly favorable to Skip."
And as for those who had less than posi
tive relationships with Kenney, Bowlsby
added."Some of it in the end was attribut
able to their parts and some of it was at
tributable to his part."
McLean, in particular, put this to test.
In June 2005. the incoming Stanford sen
ior accepted a summer internship that
would keep him from participating in vol
untary summer practices. In August 2(X)5,
however, the team was about to head to
Baton Rouge, La. for a training McLean
was available for.
McLean was told by Kenney he could
not attend because of the missed summer
practices. The situation was close to be
coming an NCAA violation, and Kober
lein said he had to step in. McLean joined

the team in Louisiana, and the issue was
resolved.
Allegations of an NCAA violation by
McLean and his family were among those
brought up again in Bowlsby's investiga
tion. But in his decision. Bowlsby said that
the swim program has shown a history of
"flexibility with summer classes, intern
ships and swimmers going abroad."
In Friday's announcement, Stanford
said no NCAA violations were found.
Finishing the swim
While Wildman-Tobriner and Korn
feld both said they were glad to have Ken
ney return after he serves his two-month
suspension, Plummer was less enthused.
"The Athletics Department has put
winning in front of integrity and doing the
right thing; but frankly, everyone always
does," Plummer said.citing Stanford's em
phasis on winning championships and Di
rectors' Cups.
Kenney has contributed to both areas
as a head coach. As an 18-time Pacific-10
Conference Coach of the Year and six
time NCAA Coach of the Year, he has led
the Cardinal to 26 Pac-10 Championships
and seven NCAA titles.
Bowlsby admitted that both Kenney's
history of competitive success and his his
tory with members of the program had to
be considered.
"In coming to the decision." Bowlsby
said, "I looked both at his body of work
over the past 28 years and what I had gath
ered in speaking with various people."
While calling the investigation and de
cision process fair, Plummer criticized
Kenney's suspension as "the bare mini
mum they can do and say they did any
thing."
The 60-day suspension, begun Apr. 20.
concludes June 20 — a period Plummer
described as irrelevant to the rest of the
season, as it is in the middle of spring
training. The suspension also ends just be
fore the start of recruiting in July.
Considering the many conflicting in
terests — including those against Kenney
and those supporting continued success
for Stanford — Plummer said he wasn't
surprised by the investigation's result.
"When you chuck all that into the
recipe," he said."l suppose you get a two
month suspension without pay."

was available for.
McLean was told by Kenney he could
not attend because of the missed summer

While Wildman-Tobriner and Korn

suspension, Plummer was less enthused.
"The Athletics Department has put
winning in front of integrity and doing the
right thing; but frankly, everyone always

as a head coach. As an 18-time Pacific-10
Conference Coach of the Year and six
time NCAA Coach of the Year, he has led
the Cardinal to 26 Pac-10 Championships
and seven NCAA titles.
Bowlsby admitted that both Kenney's
history of competitive success and his his

be considered.
"In coming to the decision." Bowlsby
said, "I looked both at his body of work
over the past 28 years and what I had gath

Kenney's suspension as "the bare mini

Skip Kenncy may have
been away from the Stan
ford pool after allegations
of misconduct, hut for the
past month and a half, the
head men's swimming
coach was in hot water
during an investigation by
Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby.
Friday's announce-

nient to suspend Kenney for 60 days, with
out pay, concluded that investigation. But
the Athletics Department's conduct, along
with the decisions made by iis leadership,
are being questioned by the swimmers and
parents at the heart of the record-deletion
scandal that drew national attention. The
Athletics Department and several current
swimmers are defending the process as fair
and the sanction as just.
Off the blocks
Kenney was first approached about the
removal of swimmers' records from the
2006-2007 media guide by The Daily. On
Mar. 8. Kenney first denied any wronedo-

ing before admitting later the same day
that he had deleted records of swimmers he
had fallings out with.
Bowlsby immediately put Kenney on in
definite suspension and promised an inves
tigation. I'he first-year athletic director
called the situation "a matter of maintain
ing the integrity of the University's record"
and "something that all of us have responsi
bility for."
Out of the woodwork came allegations
beyond Kenney's public deletions of five
swimmers' records. Numerous sources re
vealed issues with NCAA compliance and
told stories of strained relations and fur
ther conflicts with a coach described as
strict and militant.
The Athletics Department received let
ters. emails, faxes and phone calls from a
variety of people about the long-time
coach. With the flood of comments and sto
ries pouring in. Bowlsby needed to decide
how investigators should deal with the nu
merous people involved in Kenney's 28
years on the Farm.
Into the depths
Bowlsby told The Daily that the large
volume of information had to be centered
around upon three focused points that
would determine Kenney's eventual pun
ishment. Those points were the expunged
records, potential violations of NCAA


Kenney
voluntary training rules and alleged
strains in coach-athlete relations.
Although the first of the three was left
for little interpretation (Bowlsby said
Kenney's actions showed "'a serious lack
ot judgment" in his Friday announce
ment), the latter two required looking for
the input of many more people, including
current and former swimmers, alumni and
parents.
Current swimmer Paul Kornfeld. a
sophomore, described the Cardinal men
being approached by Bowlsby.
its a tough situation, but we came to
gether and showed our support of Skip,"
kornfeld said. "I'm not sure how much in
fluence it had. but he took all our concerns
into consideration."
Senior captain Ben Wildman-Tobriner
noted that Bowlsby understood the im
portance of current swimmers' input, be
cause "as swimmers, we have the most im
portant angle on how Skip is as a coach."
Waiting back on deck
While current team members who will
still swim for Kenney said they were ap
proached, it appears that the former
swimmers who had their records deleted
the very people who prompted the re
view — were barely, if at all. consulted
during the process.
Both Michael McLean '06 and Peter
Carothers "08 told The Daily they were
not contacted by the Athletics Depart
ment. While senior associate athletic di
rector Earl Koberlein told The Daily on
Tuesday that all the swimmers "had a
voice" during the investigation, he ac
knowledged that the input of Carothers
and McLean was, in fact, limited to previ
ous complaints made by the pair.
"We did not talk with him." Koberlein
said of Carothers, "But we were aware of
his gripes and the problems he had with
Skip."
According to Koberlein. Carothers'
history included his dismissal from the
team and previous documented incidents
between him and Kenney. Still,Carothers
was disappointed by the way the review
was handled.
"If they had contacted me," Carothers
said, "it would have been a full. 100-per
cent investigation, which the University
had promised from the start."
Similarly. McLean's input came in the
form of over 40 pages of material mailed
by his parents. Mike and Diane McLean

said they were troubled by the lack of ac
knowledgement they received from Stan
ford athletics. The couple said they never
contacted by anyone at the University,
and they did not even receive a confirma
tion that the materials they sent were re
ceived.
"It would have been common courtesy
to acknowledge that they received our
mailings and were taking them into con
sideration," said Diane McLean.
Koberlein and Bowlsby confirmed that
their materials were considered. As for ac
knowledgement, Bowlsby said the
McLeans "were not contacted because 1
didn't believe there was anything more to
be gathered from them, other than what
we had received."
The three remaining swimmers were
contacted by the Athletics Department,
but only one, Richard Eddy '06, did not re
spond. The Daily was also unable to reach
Eddy for comment.
Breaking past the surface
As for those who were reached. Jason
Plummer '92 and Tobias Oriwol '06 were
given the chance to offer their two cents.
In a candid interview with The Daily,
Plummer described an hourlong phone
conversation with Koberlein.
Outspoken about his many issues with
Kenney, Plummer said that he felt his side
of the story was taken seriously, but "at no
stage did I feel my testimony or anything I
said was going to get Skip Kenney fired."
Angry testimony like Plummer's was
not alone in the investigation, according
to Koberlein.
But Bowlsby noted that "the majority
[of input] was highly favorable to Skip."
And as for those who had less than posi
tive relationships with Kenney, Bowlsby
added."Some of it in the end was attribut
able to their parts and some of it was at
tributable to his part."
