# Kenney inquiry raises questions
## Alumni who had records deleted weren't consulted by Bowlsby 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Skip Kenncy may have
been away from the Stan
ford pool after allegations
of misconduct, hut for the
past month and a half, the
head men's swimming
coach was in hot water
during an investigation by
Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby.
Friday's announce-

nient to suspend Kenney for 60 days, with
out pay, concluded that investigation. But
the Athletics Department's conduct, along
with the decisions made by iis leadership,
are being questioned by the swimmers and
parents at the heart of the record-deletion
scandal that drew national attention. The
Athletics Department and several current
swimmers are defending the process as fair
and the sanction as just.
Off the blocks
Kenney was first approached about the
removal of swimmers' records from the
2006-2007 media guide by The Daily. On
Mar. 8. Kenney first denied any wronedo-

ing before admitting later the same day
that he had deleted records of swimmers he
had fallings out with.
Bowlsby immediately put Kenney on in
definite suspension and promised an inves
tigation. I'he first-year athletic director
called the situation "a matter of maintain
ing the integrity of the University's record"
and "something that all of us have responsi
bility for."
Out of the woodwork came allegations
beyond Kenney's public deletions of five
swimmers' records. Numerous sources re
vealed issues with NCAA compliance and
told stories of strained relations and fur
ther conflicts with a coach described as
strict and militant.
The Athletics Department received let
ters. emails, faxes and phone calls from a
variety of people about the long-time
coach. With the flood of comments and sto
ries pouring in. Bowlsby needed to decide
how investigators should deal with the nu
merous people involved in Kenney's 28
years on the Farm.
Into the depths
Bowlsby told The Daily that the large
volume of information had to be centered
around upon three focused points that
would determine Kenney's eventual pun
ishment. Those points were the expunged
records, potential violations of NCAA
