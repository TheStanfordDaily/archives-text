When the lights finally came back on in
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) yesterday af
ternoon. the normally rock-hard ice cream in
the dining hall was just soft enough to eat.
Offices and residences located near the
lower Row lost power for four hours yester

day as utilities officials worked to restore elec
tricity. line lights came back on in most build
ings at about 6:30 p.m.
The utilities department found out about
the outage shortly after it occurred at 2:30 p.m.
from an automated alarm on a feeder from the
substation that supplies power to that portion
of campus. Utilities Manager Dean Murray
told The Daily. At that point, the power was
out in a number of buildings, including Braun
Hall, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Post Office,
the Student Services Office, the Haas Center,
Drell and Owen I louses and the FloMo and
Storey House residences.

"We've restored power to everybody but the
Haas Center, Student Services and Owen and
Drell," Murray said at 7:30 yesterday evening.
"We're in the process of investigating which of
those buildings is the potential culprit."
"We don't know the cause of the feeder
tripping offline," he added. "On high voltage, i t
takes time. We have to be careful."
Hie outage interrupted some students' af
ternoon study routines.
"At around two o'clock or two thirty, my
Internet stopped working," said Momo Liu
"07. "I went out into the hall and it was dark."
"Some of my friends had a midterm

tonight, and tlicy couldn't
work," she added.

and it wouldbetwoor three hoursbe
fore it would come back on. I decided
we'd do a barbeque outside because
the weather was nice."
"Everything that was cold was in ice,"
she added. "Our ice machine was full, so
we had no problem."lhe only other thing
we had was a little steam in the kitchen
so we could boil a little water for the
pasta and cook some vegetables."
Students said they heard a "poof'
as the power went out. For Sean
Daneshgar TO, the outage was a re
minder of the oft-forgotten impor
tance of electricity.
"I realized," he said, "how much
energy we really consume."
