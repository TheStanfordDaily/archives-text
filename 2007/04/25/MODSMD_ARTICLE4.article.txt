When the lights finally came back on in
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) yesterday af
ternoon. the normally rock-hard ice cream in
the dining hall was just soft enough to eat.
Offices and residences located near the
lower Row lost power for four hours yester

day as utilities officials worked to restore elec
tricity. line lights came back on in most build
ings at about 6:30 p.m.
The utilities department found out about
the outage shortly after it occurred at 2:30 p.m.
from an automated alarm on a feeder from the
substation that supplies power to that portion
of campus. Utilities Manager Dean Murray
told The Daily. At that point, the power was
out in a number of buildings, including Braun
Hall, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Post Office,
the Student Services Office, the Haas Center,
Drell and Owen I louses and the FloMo and
Storey House residences.

"We've restored power to everybody but the
Haas Center, Student Services and Owen and
Drell," Murray said at 7:30 yesterday evening.
"We're in the process of investigating which of
those buildings is the potential culprit."
"We don't know the cause of the feeder
tripping offline," he added. "On high voltage, i t
takes time. We have to be careful."
Hie outage interrupted some students' af
ternoon study routines.
"At around two o'clock or two thirty, my
Internet stopped working," said Momo Liu
