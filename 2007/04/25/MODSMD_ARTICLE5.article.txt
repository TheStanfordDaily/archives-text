## Politics trumps pop culture Poll says college students know more about gov't than they get credit for 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It naming a U.S. senator is no sweat, but you draw a
blank on last season's winner of American Idol, you are
not alone. Two-thirds of the college students surveyed in
a recent Tufts University study were could name a cur
rent senator, but only 15 percent were familiar with 2006
Idol winner Taylor Reuben Hicks.
Ilie study surveyed 500 college students aged 18-24 and
S(H) non-students of comparable age. The results showed
that, in addition to knowing more about politics than pop
culture, college students are twice as likely as their non
student peers to be involved in community activities.spend
more time reading and watching the news and are more
likely to have political discussions with family and friends.
"Students care more about politics than pop culture,"
a University of Virginia review of the survey declared.
The study's findings imply that students are. in fact,
quite knowledgeable and interested in the political
world, despite the image that the media often portrays.
Political science professors and student activists at the
University said they thought Stanford students would
have fared well on the Tufts survey.
"I agree that there is political con
sciousness on some college and uni
versity campuses, with Stanford being
probably among the most politically
active," said Political Science Prof.
Larry Diamond, who is also a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution. "I
think Stanford students would score
highly on political awareness."
However, Diamond also said
that, while students on campus are
informed about politics, they are also
knowledgeable about pop culture.
"That does not necessarily mean
they are geeks on pop cultural
awareness." he said. "Compare them
to Stanford professors, for example."

Political Science Prof. Rob Reich
said he was worried that students
might confuse civic responsibilities
with political ones.
"In my experience. Stanford stu
dents score off the charts on civic en
gagement." he said, "but I fear that
they may view it as a substitute for
political engagement." he said.
Stanford Democrats president
Bobby Lepore "07 had a different
opinion, saying he thought that most
students have at least a minimal level
of political awareness.
"1 think even the students who
might pay more attention to pop cul
ture than to the nitty gritty details of
what's going on in Washington real
ize fundamentally that politics mat
ter more than the latest celebrity
gossip." he said.
"Despite the fact that I like and
agree with the findings." he added, "1
think the methodology is sort of silly'.l'm

much more interested to see how many
students vote, how many have a sense
for what's at stake in the fight over stem
cell research or gay rights or poverty."
Despite his qualms about the sur
vey, Lepore said he thought the re
sults would prove that the younger
generation is more politically active
than often believed.
"1 do remember reading about a
study very recently that said that
people who watch Hie Daily Show
indThe Colbert Report are more in
formed about current events than
watchers or listeners of just about
any other news source, save NPR,"
he said. "1 think that probably pro
vides some more good evidence that
students in general are more in
formed than older people might give
us credit for."
