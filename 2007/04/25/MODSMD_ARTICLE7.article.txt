### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Members of Stanford's Soeiety of Black Scien
tists and Engineers (SBSE) participated in Satur
day's "A Walk for I ducat ion "in West Oakland's De
Fremere Park as part of a campaign to encourage
minority students from low-income communities to
pursue higher education.
"The organization has identified at-risk cities
with ;i predominantly African American population
hut alarming rates of low high school graduation
and college acceptance." said group president Sam
Alemayehu "07 in an email. "For most of the stu
dents. no one in their family has ever gone to col
lege.and finding a role model that will demystify the
myth is critical for their success."
Alemayehu said the program was geared to
wards communities whose students historically un-
derperform in school. Members
traveled door-to-door with financial
aid materials as well as information
about tutoring and mentoring pro
grams, colleges and scholarships.
Ramine Cromartie-Thornton *09
called the event a success and said
that participants talked to about fifty
residents.
"There was a mixed response,"
she said. "Some people were talking
because the materials were free, a lot
of people we talked to were adults
and said they would pass along the
information to the youths they knew.
At least 10 people were really inter
ested and encouraged us to keep
doing this."
One of the event's planners,
Sarah Adams '09. said she was happy
to have made personal connections
with community members.
"1 talked to one seventh grader in
particular for 15 to 20 minutes," she
said." It was very rewarding.These peo
ple have no resources, and 1 think our
efforts touched a lot of the residents."
Adams, who is Stanford's liaison to
the national NBSE organization, said
most participants agreed that they
achieved their objective of promoting
opportunities for higher education.
"I definitely think it was success
ful," she said. "There were six walks
across the country and a couple in
ternationally. It was well organized,

with each participant wearing
matching T-shirts and pins. We split
the groups on either side of the street
and distributed information about
basically everything you need to
know to go to college."
The participants said they were
proud of their contributions and ef
forts during the walk.
"I really felt 1 was giving back to
my community." Cromartie Thorn
ton said. "I am a Bay Area native,
and giving back to an area that nur
tured me and that I was familiar
with made it all worthwhile. It was
n't about me; it wasn't about the

group. It was about the people we
were trying to reach. Even if I
touched one person. 1 have a sense
of satisfaction knowing that our
time was useful."
Adams said she hopes more Stan
ford students will participate in next
year's version of the event.
"We live in the Stanford bubble,
so we don't always realize that there
is a lack of equal opportunities to
higher education." she said. "The ex
perience was really eye opening."
