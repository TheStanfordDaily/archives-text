April 26,1971:
Dawn Blast Rips
Lyman's Office
A powerful bomb explosion in the attic
of the President's office at 3:50 a.m. last
Friday morning tore a jagged two-foot hole
in the second floor ceiling. Hie explosion
narrowly missed injuring a campus securi
ty policeman making his rounds.
The policeman. George Curry, 39. was
on the second floor 30 feet away when the
blast occurred. Later investigation revealed
that only half the device had detonated.
No injuries were reported.
Early estimates of the damage were
roughly $25,000.
FBI agents investigating the blast Fri
day found a knapsack containing six Molo
tov cocktails in an attic across the Quad
from the site of the explosion.
Earlier that same night, a sniper fired
five shots at the Pacific Gas & Electric sub
station on Panama St. across from the
women's tennis courts. Two of the armor
piercing bullets punctured two 60-kilovolt
transformers, causing an oil leakage.
The leakage was temporarily stopped
by campus police and fire units. I lad it con
tinued, the temperature in the transform
ers would have risen until the electric cur
rent within the transformers burst out with
the force of a small explosion, disabling the
campus's central power source.
The Anti-War March: A Victim
of Reality
At -4 p.m. Sunday afternoon.a San Fran
cisco Examiner delivery truck wound its
way through the traffic down Fulton
Street, past the lines of hitchhikers. The
driver snarled at the crowds slowing his
route, and yelled to those walking home,
"Well, did you end the war yet?"
Nobody bothered to answer. For the
more than 150,000 tired peace demonstra
tors, the question did not deserve one. No
one ever really believed that their walking
through the streets of San Francisco would
bring an end to the war in Asia; it was like
any other peace march â€” enjoyable sym
bolic protest designed to influence Con
gress and soothe liberal consciences. Every
year since 1W>4. the marches have gotten
bigger and bigger, and the cries for peace
staler and staler. They are predictable, an
established part of the culture.
Saturday's outing seemed different. Al
though the crowd was enormous and the
message abundantly clear, the feeling was
gone, lost somewhere between the sunshine
and the cynicism. Hie spirit of the Moratori
ums, still alive for a portion of the crowd, was
very mueh a thing of the past for others.The
events of the past 17 mi >nths had taken its toll
on the idealism of countless young marchers.
"I'm here because the Vietnamese dig
it." said one girl almost apologetically. "I
know realistically marches like this never
really accomplished anything, but I figure
thev can't hurt, so here I am."
