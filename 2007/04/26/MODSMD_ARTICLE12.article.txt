In Nigeria this week, the opposition to the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP) are demanding that i

the results of the weekend's presidential elections to he (
thrown out and are calling for Nigerians to take to the

streets in protest. According to a team of European
Union monitors, Saturday's elections for the Niger- ,

ian president and parliament fell "far short of basic
international and regional standards for democratic

elections." The chief monitor declared that it was

one of the worst elections he had ever observed, not
ing a veritable mine of election fraud, including ex

amples of "ballot box stuffing, alteration of official result
forms, stealing of sensitive polling materials, vote buying and
underage voting."
ITie fact that Saturday's elections are widely viewed as
illegitimate represents a major stumbling block to Nigeria's
young democracy. Nigeria entered a prolonged period of mil
itary rule in l l >84, which destabilized the country for more
than a decade through a series of fraudulent elections and
coups. Mr. Obasanjo. in office since 1999. is the first civilian
elected to the office of president in this West African country,
which not only produces more oil than any other African
state, but is also the most populous on the continent. Given /

Nigeria's oil wealth, the spoils of political office
are considerable - perhaps a consideration

driving the current turmoil

France's first round of presidential elec

tions closed on Sunday with a victory for conser
vative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and the social

ist Segolene Royal. The turnout for Sunday's
vote was a record in France, with 84-85 % of

French citizens having voted. The winners of
this round are widely seen as part of a new gen

eration of French politician and a symbolic shift

from the leadership of the elderly

Jacques Chirac. Mr. Sarkozy, the
interior minister under Mr.

(Chirac, administered the office
with considerable controversy

during the riots in many subur

) ban French cities in autumn 2005.
I le lead the polls with 30.5 % of the

[electorate. Ms. Royal, who took
25.17 %,and who will be the first fe

' male President of France if victorious,
will now enter with Mr. Sarkozy into a

Y two-week period of intense campaigning
before the final vote is held on May 6. One factor

J seen as key in the next round of elections was the
centrist candidate, Francois Bayrou who was booted

from the race after the weekend. Since the beginning of the
week, both of the final candidates have ardently courted the
support of Mr. Bayrou. who took 18.4 % of the vote in Sun
day's election, as many analysts believe the election will go to
the candidate who can win over the most Bayrou voters. On
Wednesday Mr. Bayrou declined to support either candidate,
and instead sharply criticized both Mr. Sarkozy and Ms.
Royal.

At dawn on Tuesday, a militant group

" in an ethnically Somali section of east
ern Ethiopia laid siege to a Chinese oil

** field, killing 74 workers and destroy
ing the relevant infrastructure. Nine
Chinese nationals were killed by

members of the Ogaden National Liber
ation Front (ONLF). a separatist group

that demands autonomy for the Ogaden
and Darood ethnic groups in the region and

accuses the Ethiopian government in Addis

Ababa of human rights abuses. In addition to those killed.

seven Chinese were reportedly kidnapped by the group,
whose members claim to have fought alongside Somali sol
diers in the ongoing chaos in neighboring Somalia.
The attacks underscored both the increasing activities
of Chinese energy interests in the African continent and the
ongoing conflicts in the Horn of Alrica. Late in 2006 the
Ethiopian military, reportedly with some covert assistance
by U.S. special forces, helped to oust a radical Islamist gov
ernment that had seized power in the besieged Somali capi
tal of Mogadishu. This government, unrecognized by the
United States, was ousted with Ethiopian help. The Chinese
workers kidnapped and killed on Tuesday, meanwhile,
worked for a subsidiary of the state-owned energy giant
Sinopec. In recent years the Chinese government, in pursuit
of resources, has invested heavily in African states. In addi
tion to Ethiopia, the Chinese are pursuing major oil interests
in the coastal state of Angola in southwestern Africa. Hu
Jintao. the leader of China, recently completed a tour of
many African countries in which he concluded business
deals and met with, among others. President Omar al-Bashir
of the Sudan, with whom Mr. Hu is said to

have sway.
