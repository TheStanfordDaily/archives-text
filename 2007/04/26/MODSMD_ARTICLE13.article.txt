## Experts debate VA Tech response 
### 
BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) - The Vir
ginia Tech gunman unleashed 170
rounds on the classrooms of Norris Hall
during a nine-minute rampage. Thirty
people were killed in the building.
During that spree, police spent three
minutes rushing to the building and
then about five minutes carrying out
the complicated process of breaking
through the building's doors, which
Seung-Hui Cho had chained.
The five minutes police spent break
ing into the building proved to be cru
cial as Cho moved through Norris Hall
unimpeded, with police locked out.
Authorities eventually blew their way
into the building, and as they began to
rush toward the gunfire on the second
floor, Cho put a bullet through his head.
State police spokeswoman Corinne
Geller praised the officers' response
time, noting that had police simply
rushed into the building without a plan,
many would have likely died right
along with the staff and students.
"If you go in with your backs turned,
you're never going back." Geller said.
"There's got to be some sort of organi
zation."
Some police and security experts
question the five-minute delay, saying
authorities should have charged
straight into the melee.
"You don't have time to wait," said
Aaron Cohen, president of IMS Securi
ty ot I.os Angeles, who has trained
SWA I teams around the country since
2003. "You don't have time to pre-plan
a response, liven if you have a few guys,
you go."
At Columbine, no officers entered
the building until about 40 minutes
after the first l )l 1 call from the school.
Critics have said that decision might
have contributed to the death of a
teacher who bled to death from gun
shot wounds.
Tom Corrigan. former member of a
terrorism task force and a retired New
York City detective, said five minutes
seems like a long time when gunfire is
being heard, but he added it's tough to
second-guess officers in such a situation.
"I would have liked to have seen
them bust down the door, smash win
dows. go around to another door, do
everything to get inside fast," he said.
"But it's a tough call because these offi
cers put their lives on the line on a daily
basis and I am sure they did the best
they could."
Al Baker, a former 25-year veteran
in the New York Police Department,
echoed that sentiment, but said some
times officers have to do whatever is
necessary to enter a building â€”
whether it's throwing a rock through a
window or driving a car through the
door. He said the crucial issue is ensur
ing that officers have the proper train
ing and equipment.
"This is a seminal moment for law
enforcement as far as I'm concerned
because it proves that minutes are criti
cal," he said.
