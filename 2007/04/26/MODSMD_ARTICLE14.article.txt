## Editorial Board Bring Courseguide back 
### 
With the demise of the ASSU
Courseguide, Stanford students
have been denied a critical tool
for choosing their classes and holding their
professors accountable.
Until recently, the ASSU Courseguide
made publicly available the anonymous
evaluations that students gave their profes
sors at the end of each class. The
Courseguide was conceived and imple
mented over 30 years ago in a student-driv
en effort to promote transparency, im
prove teaching quality and empower stu
dents to make more informed decisions
about the classes they take.
Today, the future of the Courseguide is
in serious peril. The number of course list
ings has been dwindling for several years,
and those that remained were often hope
lessly out of date. ITie ASSU was partly to
blame for the decline, but the Registrar's
office put the last nail in the coffin this year
by moving course surveys from a paper
based system to an online system and re
fusing to release any data to the ASSU.
Without any survey data, the ASSU had no
choice but to close down the Courseguide
program. Students who visit
courseguide.stanford.edu are now redi
rected to cyber-oblivion.
The ASSU and the Registrar's office
have an oblitiation to bring Courseguide

hack. On this page two weeks ago. Prof.
Larry Diamond, who was one of the one of
the original architects of the ASSU
Courseguide during his time as a student,
explained why the guide is just as impor
tant now as ever. In his own words, "The
current policy (or lack thereof) is ill-con
sidered and indefensible." He argues that
Stanford has a moral obligation to provide
this 'most fundamental piece" of informa
tion to its students. We strongly agree.
ITie Registrar's office must provide the
ASSU with access to course evaluation
data without delay â€”their reluctance is in
excusable. For its part, the ASSU needs to
make revamping and re-implementing the
Courseguide site a top priority. The
newly-elected Avula/Jones executive
slate, after pledging changes to
Courseguide during their campaign,
should make good on their promise by
bringing the service back in time for fall
quarter 2007.
Even in the event that the Registrar
continues to withhold information, the
ASSU can still provide for this sorely
needed service by implementing its own
independent online survey.This would be
better than nothing and, when it comes to
enabling student choice in class selection,
the ASSU should not let Courseguide dis
appear.
