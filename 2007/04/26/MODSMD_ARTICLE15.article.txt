# Why growing up means becoming a serious cyclist
## 
### 
The sign of adulthood, that you are a
true grown-up, is being a serious
cyclist. In today's rapidly changing
world, modern-day middle-class men and
women everywhere are turning 30. don
ning tight Spandex outfits, and purchas
ing expensive road hikes.
These serious cyclists are everywhere
— you can't take a jog around the block,
bike to class, or drive off Stanford's cam
pus without passing a couple lone sharks
or sometimes an entire speeding pack of
whirring wheels and black butts. Palo
Alto is a veritable thoroughfare for their
wheeled kind — they inevitably make
you feel a little inferior as you are putzing
along on your 18-speed. squeaky-chained
Schwinn or perhaps jogging just above
walking speed when Swifty McZippy
burns by you. dangerously approaching
the highest recorded velocity for a two
wheeled vehicle. Swifty creates such a
sucking vortex of wind as he rockets with
in two centimeters of your left elbow that
the baggy t-shirt you are wearing is actu
ally sucked off your body, caught in the
eddy of wind behind his back wheel and
carried off quickly into the distance,
never to be reclaimed. And there you
stand, half-naked, watching as the serious
man cyclist becomes a dot on the horizon,
leaving you to reflect upon your brief en
counter with adulthood incarnate.
These resolute bikers do more than
deplete our supply of too-big. free Stan
ford t-shirts we get from working Home
coming Reunion weekend, they also give
us a peek inside what it will be like as an
adult.
Adults have fragile bodies — bum
knees, thrown-out backs and stiff hips.
Now out of their twenties, most cyclists
are too feeble to endure the joint-pound
ings of regular jogging, which we all know
is the cheaper, simpler, less time-consum
ing way to get a bit of cardio. They are
forced to turn to the low-impact world of
cycling out of necessity, not out of prefer
ence. Their bodies can no longer with
stand the previous knee-crushing sports
their former selves once enjoyed, a bleak
reality for which we should mentally pre
pare.
An interest in cycling also means that
you are adult enough to have extra cash
to buy a good road bike and all the need
ed accoutrements: an ultra-lightweight,
tiny aluminum bike pump that clips neat
ly onto the frame of your ultra-light
weight aluminum bike, special shoes that
clackety-clack on pavement so everyone
around you knows you are true
cyclist/adult, bright neon or primary-col
ored shirts with funny elastic back pock
ets (something to do with the physics of
air-flow) and a neatly compact spare tire

pack, useful for those 70 mile rides when
getting a flat could mean a five hour walk
in the rain to the closest phone. In all. an
adult's biking hobby will cost more than
you will spend in one year on groceries,
clothes, and cable comedy DVD box sets
combined. (And you thought running
shoes were expensive... the trademark of
a true child.)
Cycling is also very grown-up because
it shows a regimented commitment to fit
ness. 1 dabble in the health world, doing a
little yoga here, some weightlifting there.
But cyclists are serious, as adults so often
are. They adhere. Marine-style, to their
daily cycling schedule. They increase the
difficulty of their rides, purposefully pick
hilly streets, and try to better their times.
They wake up early and cycle, cycle after
dusk, and take cycling classes. I guess if
you are going to drop a few thou on some
bike stuff, you would have to get some
use out of it. If the choice was between
working out really hard five times a week
and getting monstrous calves or using the
money from my bike stuff to go on a trip
to Maui, I am not sure I'd pick legs over
leis. But then again. I'm not thirty yet, so
who is to say how my seemingly in
scrutable adult mind will cross that
bridge when it gets there?
Is it because we will have no other way
to dispose of our disposable income? Is it
because our metabolisms will slow down
so much that we will all gain weight, get
freaked out by our weight-gain and then
copy what everyone else is doing and buy
a bike? Was Lance that inspirational?
Maybe that is just what naturally hap
pens when you leave the Ivory Tower:
you keep a regular schedule, become se
rious-minded. and then buy padded
spandex.
I guess I will just have to wait for the
big threc-oh and then see if I'm asking
for a helmet or a TiVo as a birthday gift.
Until then, however. I will enjoy my sup
ple cartilage-o-plenty knees, my Ferrari
metabolism, my on-campus gym and my
neutral-colored work-out clothes. And
having the bike store fix my flat tires for
me.

All Katie knows about biking is that Lance
and Sheryl broke up. If you want to discuss tin
details, e-mail her at kttaylori" stanford.edu.
