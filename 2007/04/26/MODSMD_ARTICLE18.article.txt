# The 						shrill siren song of spring
## 
### 
I really love this time of year. The sky is
bright, my professors lecture stoned,
and therethe shrill yelling of "civil de
bate." Once again the ninjas and pirates
have emerged from their 11 month silent
protests and decided to verbally bomb
each other in White Plaza. It's totally
sweet, and by that 1 mean freaking annoy
ing.
I love how so many bright college stu
dents can come together and throw aside
their differences to act like third graders. I
forget who started protesting who first. If
you wanted to graph the day's events, it
would be a flow chart that resembles a
snake eating its own tail. An ex-ninja came
and spoke, supported by the pirates, and
then some reformed pirates came in to
bitch sponsored by the ninjas. 1 don't un
derstand a word either group is saying,
however, as 1 can't speak mumbled Japan
ese or limey-toothless I English. All I know
is that they are really upset, and I'm sup
posed to feel guilty about it.
But the ninjas and pirates are not the
only two groups flipping out. The Society
of Beards elections between the Viking
and lumberjacks have erupted in a hairy.

dirty, remnants-of-meals-eaten-still-stuck
in-face spew fest. Once again, the Viking
coalition only endorsed people with
horned helmets; thus, they only support
fellow Viking. It is hard to label them com
pletely Nordic-centric, but it would do
great things to their credibility if they en
dorsed a non-Viking. Still, they're the only
ones who annually get out the boats for the
election. Their monopoly was challenged
by the lumberjacks this year, who normal
ly stick to apathy and flannel. Their tiff
only serves as a distraction from the fact
that a large female bear, or "Osa" in Span
ish. has been eating everyone this year.
Man. I hate bears.
I'm pretty well versed in walking the

fine line between two volatile groups, es
pecially the line between ninjas and pi
rates. The pirates and ninjas have both
tried to claim me as their own. but due to
some negotiations and a Kennedy's ran
som of grog and sake, we reached some
kind of diplomatic immunity agreement.
The editorial board, however, did not un
derstand the subtleties of my agreement,
and once again have wandered into a
mine field with a blindfold and a roman
candle.
The edit board has run into trouble re
cently for being perceived as either pro-pi
rate or pro-ninja, but that's just silly. None
of the edit board's members are mammals,
and none of them have any experience get
ting booty. You have to be vaguely attrac
tive to be a columnist, otherwise, to the
edit "ew-that's-your-face?" board you go.
How people perceive consistency, aside
from their hideousness, is beyond me.
Guns and Roses had better chemistry.
However, the problems of this campus,
save perhaps poor grammatical structure,
cannot be traced to the edit board. Per-


Chr Holt
Holt's Harangue
sonally, I'm just happy their arti
cles stopped telling me how I
should volunteer my time during
summer break.
So while the bear problem
looms, the various groups are es
calating their conflicts. Bring out
the Brawny-man. because this is a
mess. Right now, some lumber
jacks are complaining they lost
because the rules were selectively
enforced — something about ap
propriate length of beard, I have
no idea.There is merit to this, be
cause the viking were equally
guilty of shaving the rules this
year.
Then there's this issue with one
group wanting to break away from
the ninjas or pirates. Someone is
trying to get the entire campus to
sever ties with Japan or the
Caribbean, but the campus is di
vided over this issue, and so mak
ing a decision one way or another
would be against the wishes of
many ninjas and/or pirates. And
they're already totally flipping
out, like whoa.
Meanwhile, Eric the Red ap
parently muscled some of the
lower-ranking viking into voting a
certain way, and now everyone,
lumberjack or otherwise, is drink
ing maple syrup tilled with hate.
It's anarchy: it's chaos: it's special
interest politics with exotic cut
lery.
To take a pause from my analy

sis. 1 have to say. all of you are
pretty lame right now. Like, not
sweet at all. You're flipping out in
a had way. You folks need to come
together and work things out. 1
hate hears, and they keep eating
people. The social scene on this
campus has become more pathetic
than a zombie wizard. 1 don't care
what your allegiance is, this bear
problem needs to be addressed.
Moreover, you ninjas and pirates
need to come to some sort of under
standing. a truce. This isn't some pi
rate ship or dojo, you can't just go
around calling each other "lame"
and "not-mammals" all the time.
Stop flipping out at each other.
Leave the old leud in Japan and the
Caribbean — you aren't going to
solve it here. You should realize
we're on this campus, and while it is
vital that we take active roles in our
world, it is also necessary to under
stand a sense of place and time. Not
everyone is out to steal your pirate
gold or handle your babes. Put down
the chainsaw nun-chucks, dude.
There are more problems than
bears on this campus, but we would
n't know because you guys are flip
ping out about the wrong stuff. We
need discussions and allegiances, not
divisive highly choreographed rum
hies in White Plaza. It Dr. McNinja.
Captain Morgan. Paul Bunyan and
Hric the Red all want to come and
talk to me. maybe we can work
something out. E-mail me. Get
pumped. It'll be sweet, and by sweet
I mean totally awesome.

of Beards elections between the Viking
and lumberjacks have erupted in a hairy.

dirty, remnants-of-meals-eaten-still-stuck
in-face spew fest. Once again, the Viking
coalition only endorsed people with
horned helmets; thus, they only support
fellow Viking. It is hard to label them com
pletely Nordic-centric, but it would do
great things to their credibility if they en
dorsed a non-Viking. Still, they're the only
ones who annually get out the boats for the
election. Their monopoly was challenged
by the lumberjacks this year, who normal
ly stick to apathy and flannel. Their tiff
only serves as a distraction from the fact
that a large female bear, or "Osa" in Span
ish. has been eating everyone this year.
Man. I hate bears.
I'm pretty well versed in walking the

fine line between two volatile groups, es
pecially the line between ninjas and pi
rates. The pirates and ninjas have both
tried to claim me as their own. but due to
some negotiations and a Kennedy's ran
som of grog and sake, we reached some
kind of diplomatic immunity agreement.
The editorial board, however, did not un
derstand the subtleties of my agreement,
and once again have wandered into a
mine field with a blindfold and a roman
candle.
The edit board has run into trouble re
cently for being perceived as either pro-pi
rate or pro-ninja, but that's just silly. None
of the edit board's members are mammals,
and none of them have any experience get
ting booty. You have to be vaguely attrac
tive to be a columnist, otherwise, to the
edit "ew-that's-your-face?" board you go.
How people perceive consistency, aside
from their hideousness, is beyond me.
Guns and Roses had better chemistry.
However, the problems of this campus,
save perhaps poor grammatical structure,
cannot be traced to the edit board. Per-

sonally, I'm just happy their arti

should volunteer my time during
summer break.
So while the bear problem
looms, the various groups are es
calating their conflicts. Bring out
the Brawny-man. because this is a
mess. Right now, some lumber
jacks are complaining they lost
because the rules were selectively
enforced — something about ap
propriate length of beard, I have
no idea.There is merit to this, be
cause the viking were equally
guilty of shaving the rules this
year.
Then there's this issue with one
group wanting to break away from
the ninjas or pirates. Someone is
trying to get the entire campus to
sever ties with Japan or the
Caribbean, but the campus is di
vided over this issue, and so mak
ing a decision one way or another
would be against the wishes of
many ninjas and/or pirates. And
they're already totally flipping
out, like whoa.
Meanwhile, Eric the Red ap
parently muscled some of the
lower-ranking viking into voting a
certain way, and now everyone,
lumberjack or otherwise, is drink
ing maple syrup tilled with hate.
It's anarchy: it's chaos: it's special
interest politics with exotic cut
lery.
To take a pause from my analy

sis. 1 have to say. all of you are
pretty lame right now. Like, not
sweet at all. You're flipping out in
a had way. You folks need to come
together and work things out. 1
hate hears, and they keep eating
people. The social scene on this
campus has become more pathetic
than a zombie wizard. 1 don't care
what your allegiance is, this bear
problem needs to be addressed.
Moreover, you ninjas and pirates
need to come to some sort of under
standing. a truce. This isn't some pi
rate ship or dojo, you can't just go
around calling each other "lame"
and "not-mammals" all the time.
Stop flipping out at each other.
Leave the old leud in Japan and the
Caribbean — you aren't going to
solve it here. You should realize
we're on this campus, and while it is
vital that we take active roles in our
world, it is also necessary to under
stand a sense of place and time. Not
everyone is out to steal your pirate
gold or handle your babes. Put down
the chainsaw nun-chucks, dude.
There are more problems than
bears on this campus, but we would
n't know because you guys are flip
ping out about the wrong stuff. We
need discussions and allegiances, not
divisive highly choreographed rum
hies in White Plaza. It Dr. McNinja.
Captain Morgan. Paul Bunyan and
Hric the Red all want to come and
talk to me. maybe we can work
something out. E-mail me. Get
pumped. It'll be sweet, and by sweet
I mean totally awesome.
