# The
						shrill siren song of spring
## 
### 
I really love this time of year. The sky is
bright, my professors lecture stoned,
and therethe shrill yelling of "civil de
bate." Once again the ninjas and pirates
have emerged from their 11 month silent
protests and decided to verbally bomb
each other in White Plaza. It's totally
sweet, and by that 1 mean freaking annoy
ing.
I love how so many bright college stu
dents can come together and throw aside
their differences to act like third graders. I
forget who started protesting who first. If
you wanted to graph the day's events, it
would be a flow chart that resembles a
snake eating its own tail. An ex-ninja came
and spoke, supported by the pirates, and
then some reformed pirates came in to
bitch sponsored by the ninjas. 1 don't un
derstand a word either group is saying,
however, as 1 can't speak mumbled Japan
ese or limey-toothless I English. All I know
is that they are really upset, and I'm sup
posed to feel guilty about it.
But the ninjas and pirates are not the
only two groups flipping out. The Society
of Beards elections between the Viking
and lumberjacks have erupted in a hairy.

dirty, remnants-of-meals-eaten-still-stuck
in-face spew fest. Once again, the Viking
coalition only endorsed people with
horned helmets; thus, they only support
fellow Viking. It is hard to label them com
pletely Nordic-centric, but it would do
great things to their credibility if they en
dorsed a non-Viking. Still, they're the only
ones who annually get out the boats for the
election. Their monopoly was challenged
by the lumberjacks this year, who normal
ly stick to apathy and flannel. Their tiff
only serves as a distraction from the fact
that a large female bear, or "Osa" in Span
ish. has been eating everyone this year.
Man. I hate bears.
I'm pretty well versed in walking the

fine line between two volatile groups, es
pecially the line between ninjas and pi
rates. The pirates and ninjas have both
tried to claim me as their own. but due to
some negotiations and a Kennedy's ran
som of grog and sake, we reached some
kind of diplomatic immunity agreement.
The editorial board, however, did not un
derstand the subtleties of my agreement,
and once again have wandered into a
mine field with a blindfold and a roman
candle.
The edit board has run into trouble re
cently for being perceived as either pro-pi
rate or pro-ninja, but that's just silly. None
of the edit board's members are mammals,
and none of them have any experience get
ting booty. You have to be vaguely attrac
tive to be a columnist, otherwise, to the
edit "ew-that's-your-face?" board you go.
How people perceive consistency, aside
from their hideousness, is beyond me.
Guns and Roses had better chemistry.
However, the problems of this campus,
save perhaps poor grammatical structure,
cannot be traced to the edit board. Per-
