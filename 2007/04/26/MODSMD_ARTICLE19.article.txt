## Who is a journalist? 
### ANTHONY SANCHEZ 
In the old days, it was easy to recognize
who was a journalist, one belonging to that
class of elite individuals who could bring
down a president with their powerful craft:
simply look for the notebook and the press
card stuck into the side of a fedora. But digi
tal technology has turned everything upside
down, and those days are long gone.That, and
no one wears fedoras anymore.
Now. with a digital camcorder, a comput
er. and an Internet connection, anybody can
be boat-rocker by capturing a Macaca mo
ment or bringing attention to Don Inius'
racist broadcast on their blog. So the ques
tion must be asked: just who is a journalist,
nowadays?
It is an important question in light of both
the jailing of videoblogger Josh Wolf (now
free after 226 days in jail) for refusing to com
ply with a subpoena for his unaired footage
of a 2005 demonstration, and the ongoing de
bate over a federal shield law to create a jour
nalistic privilege to protect the sources and

methods of journalism from compelled dis
closure. It is here that the definition of a jour
nalist begins to matter: to whom would this
journalistic privilege apply?
However, defining a journalist is no easy
task, and many have qualms about the very
prospect of inviting the government to define
a journalist. To them, the act is a form of li
censing. and therefore an affront to the First
Amendment.
As Floyd Abrams, a legendary First
Amendment lawyer who argued for a jour
nalistic privilege in the Supreme Court case
Branzburg v. Hayes, has said, "...merely de
termining the scope of the privilege (when
would it apply?) and identifying who would
receive it... [are] difficult matters at best."
Indeed, defining a journalist is risky business.
Any governmental definition of a journalist
could either be too narrow and exclusionary,
failing to account for changes and nuances
(such a freelancer or bloggers), or too broad,
with the unintended consequence of granting
a blanket testimonial privilege to anyone
who can claim to be a journalist.

For example, California's shield law.
which is codified in thestate constitution and
attempts to define a journalist, faces the
problem of exclusion. A journalist is defined
as "a publisher, editor, reporter, or other per
son connected with or employed upon a
newspaper, magazine, or other periodical
publication." It is these people, the law goes
on to say, who" shall not be adjudged in con
tempt...tor refusing to disclose the source of
any information procured while so connect
ed or employed for publication in a newspa
per, magazine or other periodical publica
tion. or for refusing to disclose any unpub
lished information obtained or prepared in
gathering, receiving or processing of infor
mation lor communication to the public."
Whether a freelancer who writes while
not connected to a news organization (like
Josh Wolf) or an individual who produces a
piece of journalism only once on his blog is a
journalist is not entirely clear by the state of
C alifornia s definition. Is a blog considered a
