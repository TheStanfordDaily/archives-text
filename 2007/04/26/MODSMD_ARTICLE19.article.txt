## Who is a journalist? 
### ANTHONY SANCHEZ 
In the old days, it was easy to recognize
who was a journalist, one belonging to that
class of elite individuals who could bring
down a president with their powerful craft:
simply look for the notebook and the press
card stuck into the side of a fedora. But digi
tal technology has turned everything upside
down, and those days are long gone.That, and
no one wears fedoras anymore.
Now. with a digital camcorder, a comput
er. and an Internet connection, anybody can
be boat-rocker by capturing a Macaca mo
ment or bringing attention to Don Inius'
racist broadcast on their blog. So the ques
tion must be asked: just who is a journalist,
nowadays?
It is an important question in light of both
the jailing of videoblogger Josh Wolf (now
free after 226 days in jail) for refusing to com
ply with a subpoena for his unaired footage
of a 2005 demonstration, and the ongoing de
bate over a federal shield law to create a jour
nalistic privilege to protect the sources and

methods of journalism from compelled dis
closure. It is here that the definition of a jour
nalist begins to matter: to whom would this
journalistic privilege apply?
However, defining a journalist is no easy
task, and many have qualms about the very
prospect of inviting the government to define
a journalist. To them, the act is a form of li
censing. and therefore an affront to the First
Amendment.
As Floyd Abrams, a legendary First
Amendment lawyer who argued for a jour
nalistic privilege in the Supreme Court case
Branzburg v. Hayes, has said, "...merely de
termining the scope of the privilege (when
would it apply?) and identifying who would
receive it... [are] difficult matters at best."
Indeed, defining a journalist is risky business.
Any governmental definition of a journalist
could either be too narrow and exclusionary,
failing to account for changes and nuances
(such a freelancer or bloggers), or too broad,
with the unintended consequence of granting
a blanket testimonial privilege to anyone
who can claim to be a journalist.

For example, California's shield law.
which is codified in thestate constitution and
attempts to define a journalist, faces the
problem of exclusion. A journalist is defined
as "a publisher, editor, reporter, or other per
son connected with or employed upon a
newspaper, magazine, or other periodical
publication." It is these people, the law goes
on to say, who" shall not be adjudged in con
tempt...tor refusing to disclose the source of
any information procured while so connect
ed or employed for publication in a newspa
per, magazine or other periodical publica
tion. or for refusing to disclose any unpub
lished information obtained or prepared in
gathering, receiving or processing of infor
mation lor communication to the public."
Whether a freelancer who writes while
not connected to a news organization (like
Josh Wolf) or an individual who produces a
piece of journalism only once on his blog is a
journalist is not entirely clear by the state of
C alifornia s definition. Is a blog considered a
"periodical publication"?
When I asked Kevin Bankston, a
staff attorney for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, whether or not
bloggers are journalists, he succinct
ly responded, "Yes. A blogger is a
journalist if they are doing journal
ism."
Bankston's response is an interest
ing one as it shifts the focus from the
question of who is a journalist, to the
question of "what is journalism?" I
asked Bankston if a good legal defi
nition of journalism existed. 1 le re
sponded that a flexible definition
came from a case in which the Ninth
Circuit and Second Circuit Federal
Courts of Appeals attempted to de
termine when to apply a First
Amendment journalists' privilege.
The courts determined that the
journalists' privilege applied when
"the person seeking to invoke the
privilege had 'the intent to use mate
rial - sought, gathered or received -

to disseminate information to the
public and [that] such intent existed
at the inception of the newsgather
ing process.' If both conditions are
satisfied, then the privilege may be
invoked."
Bankston argued that this defini
tion "correctly recognizes that what
the First Amendment protects here
isn't a person or a sector of the media
but the act of journalism." Further
more. he said, the decision discrimi
nates neither on the basis of whether
the person doing journalism is a pro
fessional or amateur, nor on the
basis of the medium used.
Bankston is on to something
here.The First Amendment does not
favor one class of individuals over
another. If anybody can do journal
ism at any time, then the entire de
bate of protecting journalism has
been mistakenly focused on the ex
clusionary, who part of journalism
rather than the what part of journal
ism.
The constant advent of new tech
nologies means that journalism is a
rapidly changing field. The defini
tion of a journalist, if codified under
the federal shield Law, must be flex
ible enough to allow for these
changes in the reporting business
and be rooted in what is journalism.
So who is a journalist? A journal
ist is simply someone who does jour
nalism â€” who gathers news and in
formation for the purposes of dis
semination to the public.
