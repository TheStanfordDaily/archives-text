a margin of just three strokes (1433;
seven under par).
Meanwhile, Southern California
went on to extend its lead by another
16 strokes yesterday and won the
tournament by 36 strokes — the
third-largest margin in history —
carding a 1389 (51 under par). The
margin was the largest since 2(X)0
when Arizona State won the title by
37 strokes, at 57 under par. USC's
cross-town rival. UCLA,claimed sec
ond-place honors scoring 1425 (15
under par).
"We were a little disappointed at
the conclusion of the tournament,"
junior Rob Grube said. "Unfortu
nately. we were just outplayed by the
Trojans. They had an amazing couple
of days for golf, and we will have to
bounce back and improve going in to
the NCAAs."
Individually. Grube led the Cardi
nal. turning in a score of 282 (six
under par) to cement a seventh-place
slot individually. Grube has four
round scores of 71.70,71 and 70 as he

proved to be the most reliable Cardi
nal golfer at the tourney; he also pro
duced 15 birdies and one eagle over
the four rounds.
"1 played solidly," Grube said. "1
feel these past few rounds weren't
great, but a lot of good things hap
pened for me. which helped me end
the tournament on a relatively good
note."
Trojan Jamie Lovemark took top
honors for the tournament with a
phenomenal performance at his first
ever Pac-10 Championships. The
freshman fired an overall score of
269 (19 under par) to win the tourna
ment by a margin of six strokes over
Arizona State's Niklas Lemke.
Just behind Grube in the Cardinal
ranks was senior Matt Savage, who
moved up nine places from the first
round to conclude the tournament in
a tie for 16th after shooting a one
under-par 71 in the final round. Sav
age greatly improved since the first
two rounds of the tournament to
ward an even-par 288 (70-76-71-71).
In addition, senior Zack Miller
jumped up six places since yesterday,
concluding the tournament in a tie
for 22nd with a two-over-par 290.
Miller had a rough second round, but
improved the following rounds with

a one-under-par fourth.
Freshman Joseph Bramlett and
sophomore Daniel Lim finished in a
tie for 28th place (292; four over par).
Bramlett improved throughout his
first Pac-10 Championship, carding
scores of 78,70.71 and 73, respective
ly. Lim jumped up five spots from the
second day after scoring an even-par
72 in the fourth round.
Rounding out the Cardinal per
formance was freshman Jordan Cox,
who jumped up eight spots from
Tuesday to conclude the tournament
in a tie for 41st (2%: eight over par).
Coming off such a performance,
the Cardinal golfers and their fans
will have to wait until May 7 to find
out who will compete at the NCAA
Regional tournament. May 17-19.
"We really wanted to start of the
NCAA process with a win," Grube
said. "Fortunately for us, the only
thing that matters is regional and
NCAAs. We w ill look to improve our
performance during practice in the
next few weeks, but we are really
looking forward to playing in those
crucial tournaments which will de
cide the outcome of our season."
