## Gymnasts leap into NCAAs 
### JENNIFER O'NEIL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a two-year absence from the
NCAA Championships. Stanford
women's gymnastics yet again has the
opportunity to capture its first national
title this weekend in Salt Lake City.
A disappointing third-place finish at
last year's regional competition left the
Card out of the running for a national
title, but this year's squad took the top
spot.
"Last year was painful; to come up
short like we did. it did something to the
team and to the staff." head coach Kris
ten Smyth said. " ITiey have such a fire
and determination, they are hungry to
compete."
Stanford is one ot just twelve NCAA
teams left in contention for the title, and
with that, Smyth said the hard part is
done.
"The girls have done an unbelievable
amount of work since the beginning of
season." she said. "The sacrifices they
have made and the commitment to their
team will finails be showcased at nation
als."
Hie team hopes to perform with the
consistency it has displayed all year.The
lead-offs on each event will set the tone
for the competition. Sophomore Kelly
Fee holds that responsibility on the bars,
while junior Lauren Elmore will get the
team going on beam and junior Alex
Pintchouk will start the floor exercise.
New and more difficult skills will also
be added to the Card's agenda for the
national competition, including a full-in
tumbling pass by Elmore.
"Nationals is the place where you re
ally fio for it." Smvth said. "We aren't

holding anything back."
I .ast year, although the team was held
back from competing in the NCAA
Championshitps. the Cardinal squad sat
in the stands to cheer on its teammate,
junior Tahitha Yim.vvho has competed in
the individual competition for the past
two years.The veteran national competi
tor will serve as a leader and support sys
tem for the Cardinal.
"Nobody loves competition more
than Tahitha Yim." Smyth said,"and this
year she will have the opportunity to ex
perience it with her teammates."
Yim has experience in a national set
ting, but the effort of the entire team will
make the difference in this competition.
"All we have to do is hammer out 24-
for-24 routines; that has been our focus
all year and we are not changing it just
because it is nationals," Smyth said. "We
are controlling what we can control."
Depth is something that will con
tribute to solid performances in all 24
routines for the Card.
"Hopefully we will make it to a sec
ond day. and with our depth we are able
to compete well on that second day,"
Smyth said. "It gives up some flexibility

on the lineup."
The team goes into the competition
with an unwavering season and an ac
complished coaching staff: Smyth is
leading Stanford to its fourth national
competition in six years, and assistant
coach Chris Swircek was recently named
the regional assistant coach of the year.
"The team is the greatest to work
with — their spirit and energy is infec
tious." Swircek said." 1 don't put on the
leotard and get out there. It's all the
team."
With that support, the Cardinal is ready
to perform at the level it has been work

ing toward all year.
"Tough teams compete on the last
day of the year, and now we are really in
the running to be in that position," fresh
man Stephanie Carter said. "1 think that
we might surprise some people, which is
going to make it that much more fun."
The first session for the Cardinal
starts today in Salt Lake City. Qualifying
teams from tonight will then compete in
tomorrow's "Super Six" competition for
the NCAA title.
