### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
With the regular season over and
another conference title in hand, Stan
ford women's tennis begins its postsea
son with the Pacific-10 Conference In
dividual Championships, today
through Sunday in Ojai, Calif.
The tournament is not a team event:
rather, it's a completely individual
event with separates singles and dou
bles brackets.
The singles draw will feature 32 of
the conference's best players. Each
team's top three players will be invited,
and there will be five at-large bids
given to deserving candidates.
The most dominant conference in
the nation,the Pac-10 boasts a plethora
of talented players that the Cardinal
will have to face. Among the list are
California's Susie Babos (No. 4 in the
nation, and the defending NCAA
champion), Zsuzsanna Fodor (No. 11)
and Nina Henkel (No. 23); Southern
California's Lindsey Nelson (No. l ))
and Sarah Fansler (No. 10); UCLA's
Riza Zalameda (No. 15): and Arizona
State's Nadia Abdala (No 2')). Cat's
Fodor is also the Pac-10 tournament's
defending singles champion.
It is unclear whether all these play
ers will be competing, due to possible
iniuries or other conflicts. In past years,
players have also elected to not play in
the tournament due to personal issues,
such as not wanting to risk injury or
wanting to rest before the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford's top three players are jun
ior Celia Durkin (No. 14) and senior
co-captains Anne Yelsey (No. lb) and
Theresa Logar(No. 12).
Most likely, the Cardinal will also
send a fourth player into the draw with

Head coach Lele Forood was very
confident of her players' chances in
taking home either the singles' or dou
bles' titles.
"I think that all of our players who
get into the Pac-10 draw have a legiti
mate chance to win it." she said.
We've had winners of that tourna
ment from all throughout the line-up
over the years." Forood added."A lot of
people on our team have a legitimate
chance to win it. That makes it intrigu
ing."
The doubles' portion of the tourna

the teams in the conference will be
sending two different pairs to compete.
Stanford plans to send its two doubles

NCAA Championships in May.
"This is the last actual competi

tion before we start the tournament
on the 1 lth,"Forood said."When we
get to those two first rounds of the
NCAA, we're going full blast."
As reigning Pac-10 doubles'
champion Yelsey explained, the
Pac-10 Championships are an im
portant and prestigious event. With
that said, they are still, more than
anything else, a warm-up for the
NCAA Championships.
"We all want to do well." she said.
"But it's more of a tune-up for
everybody to go out there. It's a fun
event, and there's not too much
pressure. It's match experience â€”
nothing more than that."
With the conclusion of this week
end's tournament, the Cardinal will
enjoy a two-week respite from
match play as it prepares to make a
run for Stanford's fourth straight
national title. May 12 marks the be
