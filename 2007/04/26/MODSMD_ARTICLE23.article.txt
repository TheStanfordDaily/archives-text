Nothing came easy for the No. 8 Stanford women's golf
team at the Pacific-10 Conference Championships. After
three grueling days of competition at the Broadmoor Golf
Club in Seattle, the Cardinal finished in sixth place out of 10
schools.
This was no easy task, however, considering the strength
of the Pac-10. which features five of the nation's top-15
squads. Stanford's three-day total of 935 fell 38 strokes short
of the newly crowned Pac-10 champs. Arizona State. It was a
commanding 18-stroke victory for the top-ranked Sun Dev
ils over No. 11 UCLA (915). Rounding off the top-five fin
ishers are No. 6 Southern California (921). No. 15 Arizona
(923) and California (926).
According to head coach Caroline O'Connor, the Cardi-

na 1 women didn't
play to their full capa
cities.
"We just didn't
play our best golf, not
that we played that
poorly," O'Connor
said. "Our scores
aren't representative
of our usual game. We
didn't make the
clutch putts that we
typically do, so we
didn't see the results
that we were expect
ing."

Stanford had en
tered the championships with momentum on its side. The
women recently won the Peg Barnard Collegiate for their
second tournament victory of the season, and had appeared
to shaken off the rust from the beginning of spring season.
"We played well a few weeks ago at home, and we just
played this week poorly," O'Connor said. "We're not accus
tomed to playing courses that long, and the course definite
ly exposed our weaknesses. We'll work on them the next two
weeks and on our short game as well, but I'm not displeased
with the way we played at all."
On a brighter note, the Cardinal was led throughout by
sophomore Mari Chun (71-73-75 â€” 219), who finished third
individually. Chun's performance resembled her 11th place
finish at the 2006 tourney in which she also paced the Cardi
nal attack. This time around, Chun fell one stroke short of
the leaders, UCLA's Tiffany Joh and Arizona State's Anna
Nordqvist. who tied at 218. Joh eventually won the Pac-10
title on a sudden death playoff on the 18th hole.
"Mari has played exceptionally well and she always fin
ishes well at big tournaments," O'Connor said. "She was def
initely ready both physically and mentally. She gave herself
the opportunity coming into the last few holes, but she just
wasn't able to capitalize.
"We're just so proud of her performance and we're look
ing forward to her playing in the regionals in a few weeks,"
O'Connor added.
Chun entered the final round one stroke behind then
leader Nordqvist. Although Chun never caught up. her out
look throughout the tourney was undoubtedly that of a
champion.
"I always try to do my best," Chun said. "My mindset on
the final day was basically the same as the first two, which
was trying to put myself in a good position on each hole. We
