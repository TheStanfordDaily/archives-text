# Chun third, Card sixth at Pac-10

### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nothing came easy for the No. 8 Stanford women's golf
team at the Pacific-10 Conference Championships. After
three grueling days of competition at the Broadmoor Golf
Club in Seattle, the Cardinal finished in sixth place out of 10
schools.
This was no easy task, however, considering the strength
of the Pac-10. which features five of the nation's top-15
squads. Stanford's three-day total of 935 fell 38 strokes short
of the newly crowned Pac-10 champs. Arizona State. It was a
commanding 18-stroke victory for the top-ranked Sun Dev
ils over No. 11 UCLA (915). Rounding off the top-five fin
ishers are No. 6 Southern California (921). No. 15 Arizona
(923) and California (926).
According to head coach Caroline O'Connor, the Cardi-

na 1 women didn't
play to their full capa
cities.
"We just didn't
play our best golf, not
that we played that
poorly," O'Connor
said. "Our scores
aren't representative
of our usual game. We
didn't make the
clutch putts that we
typically do, so we
didn't see the results
that we were expect
ing."

Stanford had en
tered the championships with momentum on its side. The
women recently won the Peg Barnard Collegiate for their
second tournament victory of the season, and had appeared
to shaken off the rust from the beginning of spring season.
"We played well a few weeks ago at home, and we just
played this week poorly," O'Connor said. "We're not accus
tomed to playing courses that long, and the course definite
ly exposed our weaknesses. We'll work on them the next two
weeks and on our short game as well, but I'm not displeased
with the way we played at all."
On a brighter note, the Cardinal was led throughout by
sophomore Mari Chun (71-73-75 — 219), who finished third
individually. Chun's performance resembled her 11th place
finish at the 2006 tourney in which she also paced the Cardi
nal attack. This time around, Chun fell one stroke short of
the leaders, UCLA's Tiffany Joh and Arizona State's Anna
Nordqvist. who tied at 218. Joh eventually won the Pac-10
title on a sudden death playoff on the 18th hole.
"Mari has played exceptionally well and she always fin
ishes well at big tournaments," O'Connor said. "She was def
initely ready both physically and mentally. She gave herself
the opportunity coming into the last few holes, but she just
wasn't able to capitalize.
"We're just so proud of her performance and we're look
ing forward to her playing in the regionals in a few weeks,"
O'Connor added.
Chun entered the final round one stroke behind then
leader Nordqvist. Although Chun never caught up. her out
look throughout the tourney was undoubtedly that of a
champion.
"I always try to do my best," Chun said. "My mindset on
the final day was basically the same as the first two, which
was trying to put myself in a good position on each hole. We
know that the postseason is impor
tant, so we try to peak at that time. 1
definitely look at it as a major tour
nament, so I give it all 1 have and
leave nothing behind."
Chun has performed in clutch sit
uations throughout her collegiate
career. Earlier this season, she won
the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational in
Sammamish. Wash.
"For some reason," Chun said,
"everything comes together at the
right moment."
However, the tournament was
not as smooth for the rest of the
squad. Fellow teammates and sen
iors Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
(80-80-77 — 237) and Lauren Todd
(79-78-82 — 239) finished 24th and
27th. respectively. Freshman Angela
King (241) tied for 30th, while fellow
freshman Catherina Wang tied for
43rd with a 251.
As the year comes to a close,
Stanford creeps closer to sending off
its four seniors, including
Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd.
"They've been our leaders the en
tire year," O'Connor said. "Jennifer
can play much better than she did
today, and Lauren's been playing so
unbelievably well.The putts weren't
falling for them, but both will be pre
pared physically and mentally going
into regionals."
Looking ahead, the Stanford ros
ter does not have any juniors on the
squad. Though the team appears
headed for a youth movement in the
upcoming years, the Cardinal is not
without leaders to replace
Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd.
"Certainly, 1 expect Mari to con
tinue her role as leader on and off
the golf course," O'Connor said.
"We're going to be a very young

team next year. It'll be interesting to
see who steps up. but we expect Mari
to be one of them."
Still, the season is not yet over for
the Card. Stanford will find out if it
has been selected for the 2007
NCAA Women's Golf Regionals on
Monday. If selected, the squad will
compete May 10-12 at one of three
sites to qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships at the Snow Canyon
Country Club in late May.
For now, the team is showing the
resiliency to bounce back and make
a statement with its game.
"I'm very pleased with their atti
tudes right now." O'Connor said.
"They're very positive and undis
couraged, and they're looking for
ward to a couple weeks of hard work
in the gym and on the golf course be
fore regionals."
