## Undefeated syncrho kicks off Nationals 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford synchronized swimming
has had a perfect season so far. but a
successful three days at the U.S. Na
tionals beginning today in Indi
anapolis would make the Cardinal's
year even better.
The Stanford women are coming
off an undefeated season and a third
straight Collegiate National title. At
the March competition, the Cardinal
swept the top spots in the trio, duet,
solo and team events to win by a mar
gin of 13 points over Ohio State.
But at the lUPUI Natatorium this
week, the Stanford swimmers will be
among more than KM) competitors in
the solo, duet and team events. Other
than being the top competition in the
country, the U.S. Nationals will also
unveil the ZOOS U.S. Olympic team.
Last year.current juniors Courte
nay Stewart and Sara Lowe were the
first collegiate duo to claim the na
tional duet title. Lowe also earned a
silver medal in the solo competition,
while Stanford placed second in the
team event and was second overall to
the Santa Clara Aquamaids.
While Lowe and Stewart were
themselves 2004 Olympians (for the
U.S. and Canada, respectively), this
year's competition will surely be in
tense as both teams and individuals
vie for the chance to be the best in
the nation, as well as represent it.
The competition starts churning
water today at 8:50 a.m.
