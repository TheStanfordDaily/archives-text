## Sweat-Free stages "sew-in" 
### DAVID STEINHARDT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition
held its second "sew-in" yesterday in White
Plaza in an effort to increase awareness
among the student body about the group's
goal of promoting a sweatshop-free Stan
ford. Yesterday's protest was also designed
to publicize a rally scheduled for May 1 in
White Plaza, when more than 30 student
groups plan to unite behind the Coalition's
cause.
The "sew-in" — during which students
created quilts by sewing together various
Stanford shirts — was organized to pro
mote the Coalition's goal of ensuring that
no University apparel is fashioned in
sweatshop conditions.
"We want to make the University re
sponsible for its actions." said Yang I .or '08.
"They should be the leader in making sure
everything we do is done in a just way.That
can start with making sure our clothing is
made in a just manner."
University officials, however, said that

Stanford already has a number of stringent
restrictions in place to ensure that its ap
parel is produced legally and ethically.
"The Stanford Bookstore has a Vendor
Labor Code of Conduet in place as a means
to enforce |its] commitment to purchase
products only from vendors and manufac
turers who maintain the highest ethical
labor standards for their employees," said
Director of Business Development Susan
Weinstein. The Code sets out in detail the
conditions under which the products it sells
must be produced and provides for a
process to monitor compliance with the
Code."
Yesterday's "sew-in" rides on the coat
tails of the recent Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC)-sponsored fast, when
about a dozen students and supporters
went on a hunger strike for around a week
to protest what they contested were holes
in the University's living wage policy. The
well-publicized fast ended Friday when
