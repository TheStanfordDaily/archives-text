## Sweat-Free stages "sew-in" 
### DAVID STEINHARDT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition
held its second "sew-in" yesterday in White
Plaza in an effort to increase awareness
among the student body about the group's
goal of promoting a sweatshop-free Stan
ford. Yesterday's protest was also designed
to publicize a rally scheduled for May 1 in
White Plaza, when more than 30 student
groups plan to unite behind the Coalition's
cause.
The "sew-in" — during which students
created quilts by sewing together various
Stanford shirts — was organized to pro
mote the Coalition's goal of ensuring that
no University apparel is fashioned in
sweatshop conditions.
"We want to make the University re
sponsible for its actions." said Yang I .or '08.
"They should be the leader in making sure
everything we do is done in a just way.That
can start with making sure our clothing is
made in a just manner."
University officials, however, said that

Stanford already has a number of stringent
restrictions in place to ensure that its ap
parel is produced legally and ethically.
"The Stanford Bookstore has a Vendor
Labor Code of Conduet in place as a means
to enforce |its] commitment to purchase
products only from vendors and manufac
turers who maintain the highest ethical
labor standards for their employees," said
Director of Business Development Susan
Weinstein. The Code sets out in detail the
conditions under which the products it sells
must be produced and provides for a
process to monitor compliance with the
Code."
Yesterday's "sew-in" rides on the coat
tails of the recent Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC)-sponsored fast, when
about a dozen students and supporters
went on a hunger strike for around a week
to protest what they contested were holes
in the University's living wage policy. The
well-publicized fast ended Friday when

Members of the Sweat-Free Coalition sewed a quilt made of Stanford apparel yesterday
in White Plaza. The group will rally on May 1 against sweatshop-produced apparel.
President John Hennessy agreed to
make multiple changes to the cur
rent living wage policy.
Many of the Coalition's demands
are similar to those made by SLAC.
"[We want to] ensure that our
University's clothing is made by
workers who are paid a living wage,
work in safe conditions, treated with
respect, and have the right to union
ize." Daniel Shih '09 said in an email
to The Daily. "Our demands are that
we should join the Worker Rights

Consortium (WRC) and the Desig
nated Supplier Program (DSP)."
The WRC and DSP are nonprofit
organizations that oversee factories
in an effort to ensure that they are le
gitimate. humane businesses. More
than 160 colleges and universities
nationwide have joined the organi
zations. including Harvard. Colum
bia and all the schools in the Univer
sity of California system.
While members have been meet
ing regularly with University ad
ministrators since Feb. 16, some feel
that Hennessy is waiting until the
end of the current academic year
before he makes a final decision on
the issue.
"By waiting to make a decision

until we are out of school, we feel
that this is a clear attempt to stall our
campaign and an act of bad faith,"
Shih said. "We feel that we have no
choice but to continue showing Pres
ident Hennessy that students care
about this issue and that our coali
tion will not relent until Stanford is
truly sweat-free."
Scott Frank "10 expressed opti
mism that the Coalition would ulti
mately prevail.
"We will win," he said. "We're
working underneath good programs,
and so many schools have already
adopted a no-sweatshop policy."
