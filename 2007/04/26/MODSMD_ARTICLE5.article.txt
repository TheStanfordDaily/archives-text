# "Taking back the night"
## Sexual violence against women troubling to organizers of tonight's rally 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
More than 100 people are ex
pected to gather tonight in White
Plaza for the annual Take Back the
Night inarch that aims to protest vi
olence against women. During the
international event, participants
walk by candlelight in a show of sol
idarity against the symbolic dark
ness of domestic violence.
The first such march in the Unit
ed States — in San Francisco
was held in iy7B. Stanford has par
ticipated for 16 years. While night
violence is not reportedly a signiti
cant problem on campus,organizers
of the event stressed the possibility
that a large number of unreported
assaults still occur.
"This year, there have been two
reported incidences of rape and sex
ual violence,but there are more that
go that unreported," Take Back the
Night coordinator Jillian Wong '08
said in an email to The Daily. "The

march is intended to

prevent such cases

of sexual violence
by bringing to- a

gether different
student groups.

faculty and
staff to show

that Stanford
is a community

that proactively i
takes a stand
against such vio
lence."

quad and end at the

nity Center on
Santa Teresa Street.

According to Wong,
this year's route fo

cuses on the places
many students fre

quently find them
selves after dark.

[Walking] around the

\N NOON quad at night alone can
anford Daily be a scary experience be
cause it is very dark and
because Stanford is an open cam
pus." Wong said." You can't tell who
may be following you — it could be
a student, a stranger or someone
you know."
Baran said that the event is held

at night because of the very real dan
gers some women face after dark.
"Nighttime is symbolic of the re
ality that our freedom has been in
hibited b\ some men's choice to use
violence." she said in an email. "We
are socialized as women to be afraid
of walking or jogging alone at night
or going to the movies or grocery
store when its dark for fear of what
could happen in the parking lot."
()rganizers also are focused on in
creasing awareness about domestic
violence and promoting a conversa
tion in the Stanford community that
thev hope will ultimately decrease

violence on campus.
"It is difficult to give women the
help they need after an assault if we
are unaware one has happened."
Contreras said in an email. "It is im
perative. therefore, that we make
known the various resources on
campus so that women know who to
go to if sexual violence occurs."
According to Baran.9s percent of
all domestic violence is committed by
men against women and women rep
resent 85 percent of sexual assault
survivors. While Take Back the Night
focuses primarily on the safety of
women, organizers stressed that both
men and women are encouraged to
participate.
"Men at Stanford have attended in
increasing numbers as allies of women
they love and care about — girlfriends,
sisters, mi >thers. friends whc > have expe

rienced sexual violence," Baird said in
an email. "We want to also acknowl
edge men who have survived sexual vi
olence as children or adults often at the
hands of other men."
Organizers said they expect a sig
nificant turnout from both genders
at tonight's event.
"As a woman. 1 do feel afraid of
walking by myself at night" Wong
said "However, [Take Back the
Night| is so empowering because it
has made me feel more secure know
ing that men and women alike do
support the safety of women in our
community — as seen by the large
attendance of the march last year and
by the desire of many student groups
on campus to participate this year."
