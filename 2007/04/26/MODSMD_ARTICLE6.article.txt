A representative from the School

pursuing an M.D. and Ph.D. in Edu

oversees the ASSU's annual elec

"This is kind of more cleaning
stuff up and getting the Elections
Commission going sooner," said
Adam Beberg, former GSC mem

ber and co-sponsor of the bill.
The meeting, the first led by
Bloom and Keating, proceeded not
without its share of bumps. Some
votes needed to be recounted, and
there was some confusion as to the
swearing in of a new member.
"As you can tell, we're still get
ting used to this," Keating said.
"Please be patient."
