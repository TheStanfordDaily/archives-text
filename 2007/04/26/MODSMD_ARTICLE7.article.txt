## ASB trips designed for long-term impact

I low do you measure the success of a serv
ice trip?
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) and
other service trips take students to communi
ties both near and far, often with the hope of
making an immediate difference. But the
trips often have longer term effects, instilling
more of a lasting desire to serve than creating
tangible results.
Service trips are usually only one part of
extended programs addressing issues rang
ing from rebuilding houses damaged by Hur
ricane Katrina to the lack of infant incuba
tors in Nepal, 112 or programs sponsored by the
I lasso Plattner Institute of Design, the trips
arc used as scouting missions to better under
stand the needs of communities that students
are trying to assist.
In Nepal.one of this year's featured desti
nations. students took a closer look at poor
villages with sky high infant mortality rates.
Most deaths are due to premature births, and
to try to help alleviate the problem, the class
is working on designing infant incubators at 1
percent of the current cost.

Classes that focus on a specific social cause
are common, and many students opt to join in
on the follow-up trips when they become
available.
Fourteen of the fifteen students who
took a student-initiated course covering
veteran's affairs chose to go on an affiliated
trip to Washington, DC. to meet with legis
lators as well as volunteer in the veteran
community.
"We turned a meeting with the Director of
Voluntary Services in the VA Central Office
into a brainstorming session on how to recruit
young volunteers," said Tamar Berger '07, one
of the trips leaders.
ITieir reception on the front lines, in the
volunteer community itself, was less inviting.
"They weren't really sure what to do with
us," Berger said. "When we arrived at the site,
there was an overwhelming interest to talk to
us about their facilities rather than have us
lend a helping hand."
Short-term volunteering portions of the
programs don't see as much success as longer
term advocacy. Student volunteers can be
awkward in foreign situations.
"I felt like we were hindering them more
than helping," said liana Segall '08 of the
school fence she and other students were sup
posed to help build in Guatemala for last
year's Hillel-sponsored spring break pro
gram.
Segall felt that the group was not abroad
long enough to make a meaningful impact, es
pecially when transportation costs were taken
into account.
"Spending $300 on plane tickets," she said,
"isn't as efficient as sending the money direct-

"I know that I learned a whole lot, and I went to
sleep every day feeling as though I had helped
someone in a concrete way."

Iv to the community."
In other situations, manual labor can be
more effective. When students traveled to
New Orleans over break, the volunteer organ
ization Project Hope was ready. The ASB
group spent most of its time clearing and re
building houses, and participants said they felt
like they made an impact.
"I know that I learned a whole lot. and 1
went to sleep every day feeling as though I
had helped someone in a concrete way," said
coterminal student Jason Kerwin '06, one of
the trip's leaders.
"I think we all felt we at least made a dif
ference," said fellow student participant
Isamarie Perez '09.
Hut Perez, who intends to apply for anoth
er ASB trip next year, says that she did not just
make a difference â€” the trip changed her
perspective on life.
"The interaction made it more real and
more personal than it was before." she said.
Inspiring participants to continue with
public service is one of the goals of ASB and
other service trip programs. Stanford Home-

JASON KERWIN, senior
less Action C oalition, for example,grew out of
ASB trips in previous years; this year's New
Orleans group is still working on advocacy
campaigns three weeks after their break
ended.
Indeed, in the words of the ASB Web site,
the main goal of the popular and sometimes
selective trips is "to expose students to com
plex social and cultural issues through direct
service and "to transform students into advo
cates of social change."
By that standard, the trips were a success.
Many said their participation helped provide
the guidance and encouragement needed to
jump-start volunteerism.
"ASB is a great opportunity for people
who are looking to get involved in public serv
ice but don t know what they want to do," said
Kerwin.
And while doubting her trip's short-term
effectiveness, Segall praised it overall.
"I think after doing something like that,"
she said, "it's hard never to do it again."
