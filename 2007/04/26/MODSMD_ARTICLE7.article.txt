I low do you measure the success of a serv
ice trip?
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) and
other service trips take students to communi
ties both near and far, often with the hope of
making an immediate difference. But the
trips often have longer term effects, instilling
more of a lasting desire to serve than creating
tangible results.
Service trips are usually only one part of
extended programs addressing issues rang
ing from rebuilding houses damaged by Hur
ricane Katrina to the lack of infant incuba
tors in Nepal, 112 or programs sponsored by the
I lasso Plattner Institute of Design, the trips
arc used as scouting missions to better under
stand the needs of communities that students
are trying to assist.
In Nepal.one of this year's featured desti
nations. students took a closer look at poor
villages with sky high infant mortality rates.
Most deaths are due to premature births, and
to try to help alleviate the problem, the class
is working on designing infant incubators at 1
percent of the current cost.
