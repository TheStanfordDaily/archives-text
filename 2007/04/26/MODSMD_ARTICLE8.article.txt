# New campus blog open to all students
## 
### RRHUL KANKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On any given day, a reader of the Unoffi
cial Stanford Hlog might find a first-person
account from one of the living wage fasters. a
discussion of the University's installation art
or political commentary from an opinionated
student. Since its launch on Feb. 10.blog.stan
ford.cdu has acquired a following, with 33
separate bloggers writing hundreds of posts.
500 unique visitors a day and I 1.000 unique
visitors since Feb. 28.
Galen Panger '07. founder of the Unoffi
cial Stanford Hlog. had no set content in mind
when he created the blog.
"It really comes from the idea that
people have ideas and thoughts and
cool things that they want to share."
he said,"and they should have the op
portunity to share in a Hogging for
mat where they can editorialize, post
as many photos and videos as they
want to and just talk about their
lives."
As an official student organiza
tion.joining is free and requires only a
simple registration. In just two
months, regular posters have devel
oped their own online identities.
Megan Miller'o6 decided to get an
account because, as the Arts in Stu
dent Life Coordinator, she needed
the kind of outlet that the blog pro
vides. She values the format for its
range of functionality.
"You can embed videos, photos,
podcasts. links to things, you can tag
words, you can make it a very re
source-heavy post." she said. "For in
stance, if I wrote a post about installa
tion art on campus, not only could I
embed photos of the art. but also links
to other universities that have done
the same sort of thing. So it's very
much drawing in from the web and
bringing other perspectives to our lit
tle Stanford world."
Frequent contributors said the
egalitarian blog served a different
role than The Daily.
"If there are issues like Virginia
Tech or the fast that went on for
SLAC, these are big campus issues
and the blog is a place for anyone,"
Miller said. "Anyone could post about
SLAC and what they feel about the

fast. And that's kind of what 1 feel is
different from The Daily. The blog is
very op-ed, and the mission of it is to
be an open forum."
"The Stanford Daily is constrained
by space limitations and values of
what is newsworthy," said Anthony
Sanchez '07, who uses the blog to pro
mote his K.ZSU news program. "So a
lot of people can't get their ideas out
there. The thing about the blog is that
people can put anything they want
out there."
"In a lot of ways it's unfiltered dis
cussion." said Troy Steinmetz '07. who
posts about student life and technolo
gy. "Any of the contributors can put up
whatever they like. We do have some
bloggers who have an agenda. We
have some people who were involved
in the elections. We have someone
who posts who's currently involved in
the living wage campaign. And that's
okay. You just recognize that everyone
has their own opinions and a lot of
times they're the ones who stimulate
the most discussion."
But the blog is not entirely without
editorial control. Panger says he is
committed to ensuring high-quality
content.
"And as the sort of self-appointed
editor-in-chief, if I think that a post is
just not any good, then I would re
move it and ask the person to fix it
and repost it."he said. "So far we
haven't had many problems with that.
I've only had to do that twice."
