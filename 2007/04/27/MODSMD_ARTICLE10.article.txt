# Crew falters against Cal in Big Row
## 
### 
Last Weekend's Big Row against
California turned into a big loss for
the Stanford crew teams. With the
only win coming from the women's
lightweight team, the Cardinal men's
and women's eight teams were left
behind by the Bears.
Starting the day at the Redwood
Shores Lagoon, the women's varsity
eight were outdone by the California
women, who defeated the No. 17
Cardinal by 4.5 seconds (6:38.3
against 6:42.8).
The No. 4 Stanford men were also
unable to finish strong against No. 2 Cal
in the eight. Racing on Stanford's prac

tice waters, the Cardinal and Bears
were even after 11(X) meters, marked
by the Redwood Shores bridge.
"It was a great race between two
great teams," men's head coach
Craig Amerkhanian said to GoStan
ford.com. "The boats were level
coming through the bridge, and
that's the kind of intensity you see
when these teams go head to head."
California pulled out the win.
though, by just 3.3 seconds (5:50.3
against 5:53.6).
The Stanford men's second varsi
ty eight and freshmen eight, as well
as the women's second varsity eight
and varsity four, were also defeated
by the Bears. The women's novice
team was the only to break past Cal.
News was better, though, for the
No. 3 Stanford women's lightweight
team, as it beat the Bears' light
weights by 11 seconds (7:20.9 against
7:31.9). The win came after the Car
dinal eight experimented against the
Cal third varsity open eight and lost
by only 3.4 seconds.
"Racing two times in an hour is a
tall order for any crew, and 1 felt the
crew did a nice job." women's light
weight coach A 1 Acosta said to
GoStanford.com.
While the Cardinal lightweights
head to Indianapolis to face No. 1
Wisconsin, No. 4 Georgetown and
No. 13 Ohio State tomorrow, the
Stanford men's and open women's
teams face Oregon State and Wash
ington State in Eugene, Ore. this
weekend.
