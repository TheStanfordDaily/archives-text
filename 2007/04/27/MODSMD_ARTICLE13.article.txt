## 
### 
Playing in the Southern Califor
nia setting of Ojai, Stanford women's
tennis kicked off the Pacific-10 Con
ference Individual Championships
yesterday with three of its players ad
vancing to today's quarterfinal
round of singles play.
Stanford sent an impressive total
of six players to the main singles
draw. That number is all the more
impressive because each team only
receives three individual bids, while
the remaining spots are composed of
five at-large bids rewarded to de
serving players. Freshman Lindsey
Burdette, sophomore Jessica
Nguyen and junior Whitney Deason
picked up three of the five bids that
were available to all nine conference
teams.
Cardinal players Anne Yelsey,
Theresa Logar. Nguyen. Durkin and
Burdette all advanced to the final 16
with strong performances in the first
round.
Deason was the only player who
didn't win. losing to Arizona's Juli
ette Mavroleon in straight sets. 6-2,
6-2. The matches all took place be
fore noon.
In a second wave of matches later
in the day, Yelsey and Nguyen suf
fered second-round losses to their
opponents Nina Henkel (Cal) and
Anca Anastasiu (USC). respectively.

Burdette, Logar and Durkin all
won — Burdette taking a close
three-set match against Cal's Suzi
Fodor (6-4. 6-7, 6-4); Durkin drop
ping Cal's Cristina Visico to win by a
score of 6-3.6-3; and Logar cruising
past Arizona State's Nadia Abdala
in two sets, 6-1.6-3.
In an interesting development.
Stanford's Burdette and Logar will
face off in tomorrow's quarterfinal
match. Neither was unavailable for
comment at the time of press, but the
matchup between the two team
mates and friends should have a
unique dynamic.
Doubles play begins tomorrow as
the Cardinal sends three squads —
Yelsey and Burdette. Nyugen and
Durkin and Logar and Deason — to
compete against the Pac-l()'s best.
