# The 						way to the stars

It will soon become apparent that humanity has come to an
impasse through which there is no obvious pathway The blind
following of market forces has brought the nations to a standstill
in their fierce battle for markets and profits. Some tread more
carefully as their economies falter, while others, especially the
newly rich, soldier on. intent on even greater riches and growth.
Slowly it is dawning on the more experienced that all is not well,
that the future looks bleaker than it should, that the everdreaded
slump may not be far-off, after all One might almost say that a
new realism is beginning to show itself.
In this situation there is only one way for the governments of
the world to go - a way so new, so imponderable it would seem,
that almost no thought has been given to its realization.
This new way is the cornerstone of Maitreya's advice to the
nations It is a way untried and yet so obvious in its efficacy that
men will be astonished by the success of their actions when it is
implemented. The way is sharing, the straightforward demonstra
tion of the oneness of men The principle of sharing brings into
manifestation the quality of divinity. When men share they will
reveal themselves as potential Gods. Nothing is so truly divine as
this great gesture of brotherhood. When men see this they will
enter into a new definition of themselves and will begin the estab
lishment of the Hra of Righteousness. So will it be.
W hen Maitreya* enters the lives of men and brings Mis coun
sel, a new chapter will open for men They will know that they are
not alone in this vast universe. Thev will know that there are manv

other worlds in which their Brothers work for them, saving them
from much harm. Maitreya will inaugurate the era of contact with
these their far off Brothers, and will establish a future of mutual
interaction and service. Thus will it be.
My friends, these are not idle dreams but the considered
words of One who Knows. Take heart, therefore, and be prepared
for this enlargement of your vision and capacity for service.
Maitreya will show you that the way to the stars is a feasible jour
ney of enlightenment. Me will show that the units of the one life
manifest themselves throughout Cosmos; that until now this
knowledge has been withheld from men but will provide a sure
path for future generations to follow.
Much depends, therefore, on men's response to Maitreya's
guidance. Men have indeed the choice: to remain as men stunted
in the growth of their magnificence, or to become what in Truth
they are, veritable Gods.
