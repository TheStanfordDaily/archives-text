## A 						moment of ensoulment? 
### 
When does life begin? Most
people seem to have an
opinion on the issue. After
all, "When does life begin?" seems
like a reasonable thing to ask. We see
personhood as an all-or-nothing
thing — something either is a person
or it isn't. If there are no degrees of
personhood, there should be a clear
moment when a new individual
comes into existence, a thunderclap
announcing a new life — "ensoul
ment," if you will.
But it's not the case. Every clear
line of "where life begins" collapses
under scientific inspection.
Let's take a look at the candi
dates. Conception seems to be a pop
ular choice for the beginning of life.
As this is the moment when two
genomes fuse to create a unique in
dividual, maybe a new soul is created
then.
But there are some problems
with this idea. According to Steven
Pinker in "The Blank Slate" (2002),
the moment of conception is not a
really a moment at all. Sometimes,
more than one sperm penetrates an
egg, and it takes time for the egg to
push out the extra DNA. Also, even
when only a single sperm enters an
egg, their genes don't mingle for at
least a day.TTien it takes another day
for the new genome to control the
embryo. So the "moment" of concep
tion is really up to two days.
But even if it's not really a mo
ment, the point at which a new
genome is created could still be the
point of ensoulment. But now we
have more problems. A new em

bryo can split and become twins,
triplets, etc. Did the Dionne quintu
plets scrape by with 1/5 of a soul
apiece?
In addition, every cell of an eight
cell embryo is capable of becoming
a full person. Does the embryo start
with eight souls, and then lose some?

quire all women to deliver octu

A weirder ensoulment dilemma
happens with genetic chimeras,
which are created when two em
bryos fuse to become one person.
The resulting individual ends up with
some cells of one genome and some
of another. Does a genetic chimera
have a double soul? One soul in
some cells, and another soul in the
rest?
Cloning throws one more wrench
into the ensoulment debate. Dolly
the cloned sheep was made with the
nuclear DNA from an adult ewe's
mammary cell. (That's actually why
she was called "Dolly," after Dolly
Parton.) The mammary cell's nucle
us was transferred to the enucleated
egg of a second sheep, which then de
veloped into an embryo.
Did Dolly have the same soul as
the donor of her DNA? Maybe

sheep don't have souls anyway, hut
consider this: Human cloning is al
ready technically possible. Should it
become a reality, every cell in a
human body will have the potential
to become a human being. When
would a cloned human's life begin?
Even with conventional non
clones. up to half of all fertilized eggs
don't implant into the uterus. They
are flushed out of a woman's body
with her next period — she probably
doesn't even notice.
It we believe life begins at con
ception, this is the biggest public
health crisis the world has ever
faced! For every person born, one
died in utero! Why isn't there more
research money going to save all
these children? For me. this reflects
that no one takes the idea that con
ception is the start of life too literal
ly.
Are there other definitions for
where life begins? The Catholic
Church used to hold that the soul en
tered the body at "quickening" —
that is. when a pregnant woman first
felt the movement of her fetus. This
isn't a clear line either. A woman
pregnant for the first time usually

feels these movements at about 20
weeks' gestation, while a woman
who's been pregnant before has
more relaxed uterine muscles, and
can feel movement as early as 14
weeks.
But a fetus is moving before the
pregnant woman realizes what's
going on. Early fetal movement is
often mistaken for hunger pangs or
intestinal discomfort. Mistaking en
soulment for gas seems particularly
funny.
So maybe quickening is out of the
running. No one seems to give it
much thought these days anyway.
How about viability as the point
where life begins? That is the basis
for most of the policy decisions in the
United States.
But the point of viability really
only measures the state of medical
technology. The world's youngest
surviving baby was recently born at
21 weeks, six days. Serious medical
heroics kept her alive, but she won't
be the last baby in a parade of ever
younger preemies.
So where does all this leave us?
With the uncomfortable realization
that there is no thunderclap of en

soulnient. We have to face the fact
that personhood is a matter of de
gree. Life begins gradually, over sev
eral months. It's decidedly unsatisfy
ing.
A little more nuance in our un
derstanding of personhood would
bring some balance to the abortion
debate. But even then, the science
doesn't deliver a clear policy.
Say we agree that a fetus is some
fraction of a person. What then? Is it
okay for a woman to have an abor
tion if the fetus is less than 50 per
cent of a person? Less than 40 per
cent? What if she's carrying twins,
and they are each 50 percent of a
person? Is abort.on then unaccept
able, since together the fetuses sum
to 100 percent of a person? Maybe
twins could only he aborted at the
developmental stage, where they
were each 25 percent of a person?
The situation gets ludicrous fairly
quickly.
1 hate to say it. but maybe in
some cases, science can only take us
so far.

But it's not the case. Every clear
line of "where life begins" collapses
under scientific inspection.
Let's take a look at the candi
dates. Conception seems to be a pop
ular choice for the beginning of life.
As this is the moment when two
genomes fuse to create a unique in
dividual, maybe a new soul is created
then.
But there are some problems
with this idea. According to Steven
Pinker in "The Blank Slate" (2002),
the moment of conception is not a
really a moment at all. Sometimes,
more than one sperm penetrates an
egg, and it takes time for the egg to
push out the extra DNA. Also, even
when only a single sperm enters an
egg, their genes don't mingle for at
least a day.TTien it takes another day
for the new genome to control the
embryo. So the "moment" of concep
tion is really up to two days.
But even if it's not really a mo
ment, the point at which a new
genome is created could still be the
point of ensoulment. But now we
have more problems. A new em

bryo can split and become twins,
triplets, etc. Did the Dionne quintu
plets scrape by with 1/5 of a soul
apiece?
In addition, every cell of an eight
cell embryo is capable of becoming
a full person. Does the embryo start
with eight souls, and then lose some?

seven people. Perhaps we should re
quire all women to deliver octu
plets!
A weirder ensoulment dilemma
happens with genetic chimeras,
which are created when two em
bryos fuse to become one person.
The resulting individual ends up with
some cells of one genome and some
of another. Does a genetic chimera
have a double soul? One soul in
some cells, and another soul in the
rest?
Cloning throws one more wrench
into the ensoulment debate. Dolly
the cloned sheep was made with the
nuclear DNA from an adult ewe's
mammary cell. (That's actually why
she was called "Dolly," after Dolly
Parton.) The mammary cell's nucle
us was transferred to the enucleated
egg of a second sheep, which then de
veloped into an embryo.
Did Dolly have the same soul as
the donor of her DNA? Maybe

sheep don't have souls anyway, hut
consider this: Human cloning is al
ready technically possible. Should it
become a reality, every cell in a
human body will have the potential
to become a human being. When
would a cloned human's life begin?
Even with conventional non
clones. up to half of all fertilized eggs
don't implant into the uterus. They
are flushed out of a woman's body
with her next period — she probably
doesn't even notice.
It we believe life begins at con
ception, this is the biggest public
health crisis the world has ever
faced! For every person born, one
died in utero! Why isn't there more
research money going to save all
these children? For me. this reflects
that no one takes the idea that con
ception is the start of life too literal
ly.
Are there other definitions for
where life begins? The Catholic
Church used to hold that the soul en
tered the body at "quickening" —
that is. when a pregnant woman first
felt the movement of her fetus. This
isn't a clear line either. A woman
pregnant for the first time usually

feels these movements at about 20
weeks' gestation, while a woman
who's been pregnant before has
more relaxed uterine muscles, and
can feel movement as early as 14
weeks.
But a fetus is moving before the
pregnant woman realizes what's
going on. Early fetal movement is
often mistaken for hunger pangs or
intestinal discomfort. Mistaking en
soulment for gas seems particularly
funny.
So maybe quickening is out of the
running. No one seems to give it
much thought these days anyway.
How about viability as the point
where life begins? That is the basis
for most of the policy decisions in the
United States.
But the point of viability really
only measures the state of medical
technology. The world's youngest
surviving baby was recently born at
21 weeks, six days. Serious medical
heroics kept her alive, but she won't
be the last baby in a parade of ever
younger preemies.
So where does all this leave us?
With the uncomfortable realization
that there is no thunderclap of en

soulnient. We have to face the fact
that personhood is a matter of de
gree. Life begins gradually, over sev
eral months. It's decidedly unsatisfy
ing.
A little more nuance in our un
derstanding of personhood would
bring some balance to the abortion
debate. But even then, the science
doesn't deliver a clear policy.
Say we agree that a fetus is some
fraction of a person. What then? Is it
okay for a woman to have an abor
tion if the fetus is less than 50 per
cent of a person? Less than 40 per
cent? What if she's carrying twins,
and they are each 50 percent of a
person? Is abort.on then unaccept
able, since together the fetuses sum
to 100 percent of a person? Maybe
twins could only he aborted at the
developmental stage, where they
were each 25 percent of a person?
The situation gets ludicrous fairly
quickly.
1 hate to say it. but maybe in
some cases, science can only take us
so far.
