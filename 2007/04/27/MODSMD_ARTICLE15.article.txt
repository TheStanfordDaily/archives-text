## A
						moment of ensoulment? 
### 
When does life begin? Most
people seem to have an
opinion on the issue. After
all, "When does life begin?" seems
like a reasonable thing to ask. We see
personhood as an all-or-nothing
thing — something either is a person
or it isn't. If there are no degrees of
personhood, there should be a clear
moment when a new individual
comes into existence, a thunderclap
announcing a new life — "ensoul
ment," if you will.
But it's not the case. Every clear
line of "where life begins" collapses
under scientific inspection.
Let's take a look at the candi
dates. Conception seems to be a pop
ular choice for the beginning of life.
As this is the moment when two
genomes fuse to create a unique in
dividual, maybe a new soul is created
then.
But there are some problems
with this idea. According to Steven
Pinker in "The Blank Slate" (2002),
the moment of conception is not a
really a moment at all. Sometimes,
more than one sperm penetrates an
egg, and it takes time for the egg to
push out the extra DNA. Also, even
when only a single sperm enters an
egg, their genes don't mingle for at
least a day.TTien it takes another day
for the new genome to control the
embryo. So the "moment" of concep
tion is really up to two days.
But even if it's not really a mo
ment, the point at which a new
genome is created could still be the
point of ensoulment. But now we
have more problems. A new em

bryo can split and become twins,
triplets, etc. Did the Dionne quintu
plets scrape by with 1/5 of a soul
apiece?
In addition, every cell of an eight
cell embryo is capable of becoming
a full person. Does the embryo start
with eight souls, and then lose some?
Every singleton that is born de
prives the world of an additional
