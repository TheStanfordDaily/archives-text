### JUSTIN POPE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said Thursday that ad
missions dean Marilee Jones - a cru
sader for reducing the anxiety
around college admissions - has re
signed for misrepresenting her aca
demic credentials to the university.
Jones, dean since 1997. has been a
highly visible campaigner for reform
ing the college admissions process.
She issued a statement saying she had
misrepresented her credentials when
she first came to work at M IT 28 years
ago and "did not have the courage to
correct my resume when I applied for
my current job or at any time since.
"I am deeply sorry for this and for
disappointing so many in the MIT

community and beyond who sup
ported me, believed in me, and who
have given me extraordinary oppor
tunities." she said.
MIT spokeswoman Fatti
Richards said Jones has at various
times claimed to have degrees from
Union College, Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute and the Albany Medical
College, but Richards had no imme
diate information on what degrees
Jones actually has or how the matter
was uncovered.
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion Daniel Hastings announced
Jones' resignation in an e-mail to MIT.
"This is a sad and unfortunate
event,"he said. "But the integrity of
the Institute is our highest priority,
and we cannot tolerate this kind of
behavior."
