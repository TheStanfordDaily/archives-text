### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Approximately 150 members of
the Stanford community joined to
gether in White Plaza last night for
Stanford's 16th annual Take Back
the Night (TBTN) walk.The march,
which takes place nationally each
year, seeks to raise awareness of sex
ual violence against women, partic
ularly at night.
The event kicked off with an
opening ceremony about 10 minutes
behind schedule, as a large cadre of
volunteers, including current and in
coming Public Health Educators
(PHEs), continued to distribute can
dles. route maps and cards listing re
sources for women suffering from re
lationship abuse and sexual assault.
Carole Pertofsky, director of
health promotion services at Vaden
Health Center, was the first speaker.
"We are here to understand how
many people create violence against
women in the world," she said to the
effusive crowd, which gave her a
loud ovation."ln the dark, under the
moon and stars, each of us is a light
for peace."
Pertofsky's image was literally
manifested as the circle of partici
pants held candles decorated by the
Sigma Psi Zeta sorority, whose na
tional philanthropy mission is to
spread awareness of sexual assault
issues and combat against domestic
violence, according to Jillian Wong
"08, the coordinator for the event.
In addition to Pertofsky and
Wong, the opening ceremony fea
tured a wide array of community
and student leaders, including Sally
Baird, from Sexual Assault Preven

tion at Vaden Health Services,
Nicole Baran "DO, the founder and
director of the Center for Relation
ship Abuse, PHE coordinator Dina
Contreras '06 and Jesse Wallin '08,
director of Men Against Violence.
The a cappella group Talisman also
performed at the ceremony.
The walk, which was led by the sis
ters of Pi Beta Phi, led the partici

pants around campus and concluded
at a reception at the Women's Center.
Student reaction to the walk was
very positive.
"I'm not afraid to walk alone at
night at Stanford, but 1 have been in
other places," said Subhanu Sama
rajiva "10. who heard about TBTN
from her PHE."I think this is a great
event for the community to join to

gether and express its support."
"We think it is a very important
message to send to the community
that sexual assault happens, and that it
is unacceptable," said Mark Liao '07,
vvhi) stood with his twin brother, James
Liao '07. in what marked the third
TBTN the brothers had attended.

Students and community members, bearing candles, gathered in White Plaza last night before embarking on the annual Take Back the Night
march. The walkers wove through campus in protest of violence against women and organizers hoped to increase awareness.
"I think [TBTN] is a great idea,"
agreed Mackenzie Price 'OS. the
PHE for Larkin. After glancing
around at the still-growing crowd,
however, she commented, "I wish
more people were here. The whole
idea of getting people together is
very empowering, but it can only
work if people decide to show up."
