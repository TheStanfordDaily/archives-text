# NFL DRAFT: Q&A with Trent Edwards
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
When former Stanford quarterback Trent Ed
wards '06 arrived on the Farm in 2002, USA
Today ranked him as the No. 1 incoming passer in
the nation. Now, even after four years without
The Axe, he's preparing to leave as perhaps the
third-most coveted collegiate quarterback in the
country.
In between were plenty of difficult years for
Edwards and Cardinal football. But if the "ex
perts" are to be believed, the injuries, struggles
and program-wide malaise that plagued Ed
wards' reputation in the intervening years may
be clearing. The latest rumors have the Detroit
Lions very interested in adding Edwards in the
second round, which would likely make him the
third quarterback taken in 2007, behind LSU's
JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady
Ouinn.
Edwards spoke with The Daily by telephone
on Tliesday, just hours after filming an interview
with ESPN's Jim Rome. Traveling the junket of
practices, coaches and press that come with
being an NFL recruit, Edwards shared his expe
riences.
The Stanford Daily: You have obviously been
putting a lot of effort into this whole NFL draft
process in recent months. Where's your mind at
now that the draft is so close at hand?
lYcnt Edwards. It's a goal that was set a long time
ago that I've been working towards. To actually
be less than a week away from (the draft) actual
ly happening is a very anxious feeling. I'm sure,as
we get even closer to it.the feeling will only grow,
but it's an exciting time. You get pulled in a lot of
different directions, but that obviously means
that people are interested, and that's what you
want. There are a lot of people that would want
to be in my situation, and I just try to think about
that every time things get hard.
TSI): Have there been any big surprises for you
going through this process of getting ready for
the draft?
TE: I think the one thing that suiprised me was,
at the Combine.it wasn't really just you working
out. You're part of a group of guys, and you're
running and throwing the ball with other guys. 1
