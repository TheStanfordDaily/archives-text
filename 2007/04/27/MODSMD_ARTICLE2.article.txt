# NFL DRAFT: Q&A with Trent Edwards
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
When former Stanford quarterback Trent Ed
wards '06 arrived on the Farm in 2002, USA
Today ranked him as the No. 1 incoming passer in
the nation. Now, even after four years without
The Axe, he's preparing to leave as perhaps the
third-most coveted collegiate quarterback in the
country.
In between were plenty of difficult years for
Edwards and Cardinal football. But if the "ex
perts" are to be believed, the injuries, struggles
and program-wide malaise that plagued Ed
wards' reputation in the intervening years may
be clearing. The latest rumors have the Detroit
Lions very interested in adding Edwards in the
second round, which would likely make him the
third quarterback taken in 2007, behind LSU's
JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady
Ouinn.
Edwards spoke with The Daily by telephone
on Tliesday, just hours after filming an interview
with ESPN's Jim Rome. Traveling the junket of
practices, coaches and press that come with
being an NFL recruit, Edwards shared his expe
riences.
The Stanford Daily: You have obviously been
putting a lot of effort into this whole NFL draft
process in recent months. Where's your mind at
now that the draft is so close at hand?
lYcnt Edwards. It's a goal that was set a long time
ago that I've been working towards. To actually
be less than a week away from (the draft) actual
ly happening is a very anxious feeling. I'm sure,as
we get even closer to it.the feeling will only grow,
but it's an exciting time. You get pulled in a lot of
different directions, but that obviously means
that people are interested, and that's what you
want. There are a lot of people that would want
to be in my situation, and I just try to think about
that every time things get hard.
TSI): Have there been any big surprises for you
going through this process of getting ready for
the draft?
TE: I think the one thing that suiprised me was,
at the Combine.it wasn't really just you working
out. You're part of a group of guys, and you're
running and throwing the ball with other guys. 1
was really picturing that the workouts at
the Combine would be a little bit more in
dividual and be a little bit more intense.
But honestly, it's quiet, the seats are empty
[at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis]. There
are obviously coaches and general man
agers there watching you. but there are
other groups working out, other people
switching in. It's really not what I antici
pated — that was probably the only sur
prise.
TSI): What was it like working out along
side some of the best talent from the colle
giate ranks? How do you think you meas
ured up against those guys?
TE: I actually enjoyed it. I enjoyed meet
ing the guys, and I'm a person that likes
watching other quarterbacks and watch
ing their mechanics to see what makes
them so accurate or able to throw the ball
so hard. So, I tried to just see the best of
those guys in my class throw the football
around. You hear a lot about them, but it
was just fun to see them in person and see
what they do best.
TSI): How is your health at this point?
Have you fully recovered from the broken
foot that ended your 2006 season with
Stanford?
TE: It's feeling really good right now. I
spent a lot of time rehabbing it right after
it happened in the months of November
and December and became best friends
with some physical therapists. It's really
paying off for me right now, because I
think we're five months out of it and I'm
not feeling any problems with my foot or
with any other part of my body.
TSI): Are there any places that you feel

STANFORD SPRING GAME
4/28 Stanford Stadium
GAME NOTES: Stanford football will take to the field
for its annual spring scrimmage, hopefully, in the
words of coach Jim Harbaugh, with "an enthusi
asm unknown to mankind." The team will divide up
into Cardinal and White squads and square off in a
contest sure to play a significant role in shaping the
team depth chart prior to this summer. Today will
mark the team's 14th and final practice of the
spring before tomorrow's intersquad competition.
Admission to the Cardinal and White game is free.

you would be most comfortable going, or
is it more of a 'wait and see' approach?
TE: It's more of a 'wait and see' thing. I'm
pretty open minded about it. There are
coaches that I've spoken with where I re
ally like the things they say and the offen
sive schemes they bring to the table. I'm a
big fantasy football fan, so I've watched a
lot of their players and their games and
the numbers they've put up. The coaches
I've been in close contact with that I real
ly have liked have been coach [Greg
Knapp with the Raiders and coach [Mike
Martz with the Lions. There are plenty of

other coaches that I did like as well, so I
think any situation would really fit me
well, and I'm trying to be pretty open
about it.
TSD: Specifically playing for a guy like
[Lions Offensive Coordinator] Mike
Martz, what would that be like working
under a coach who has been noted for de
signing and running one of the most ex
plosive offensive schemes in the NFL in
recent years?
TE: It's an exciting opportunity. If you
watch any of that on tape or look at it on
paper, the resume that he has, it compares
with the best of them. So, to be able to
work day in and day out with a guy like
that is the kind of opportunity that not a
lot of quarterbacks get. You just have to
take advantage of it and continue to com
pete. and hopefully that coach can really
help you out and allow you to progress.
TSI): How do you plan on spending Satur
day? Are you going to be following the se
lections or trying not to pay too much at
tention?
TE:The schedule for the day is: I'm going
to wake up pretty early and try to get out
and play some golf in the morning with my
agent and a couple of buddies. And then
I'm going to come back to the house and
hang out and watch and wait, really, is the
way I've been describing it. Sitting there,
it's going to be a long day; it's going to be
filled with a lot of emotion. But hopefully,
all that hard work is going to pay off real
soon.

coaches that I've spoken with where I re
ally like the things they say and the offen
sive schemes they bring to the table. I'm a
big fantasy football fan, so I've watched a
lot of their players and their games and
the numbers they've put up. The coaches
I've been in close contact with that I real
ly have liked have been coach [Greg
Knapp with the Raiders and coach [Mike
Martz with the Lions. There are plenty of

other coaches that I did like as well, so I
think any situation would really fit me
well, and I'm trying to be pretty open
about it.
TSD: Specifically playing for a guy like
[Lions Offensive Coordinator] Mike
Martz, what would that be like working
under a coach who has been noted for de
signing and running one of the most ex
plosive offensive schemes in the NFL in
recent years?
TE: It's an exciting opportunity. If you
watch any of that on tape or look at it on
paper, the resume that he has, it compares
with the best of them. So, to be able to
work day in and day out with a guy like
that is the kind of opportunity that not a
lot of quarterbacks get. You just have to
take advantage of it and continue to com
pete. and hopefully that coach can really
help you out and allow you to progress.
TSI): How do you plan on spending Satur
day? Are you going to be following the se
lections or trying not to pay too much at
tention?
TE:The schedule for the day is: I'm going
to wake up pretty early and try to get out
and play some golf in the morning with my
agent and a couple of buddies. And then
I'm going to come back to the house and
hang out and watch and wait, really, is the
way I've been describing it. Sitting there,
it's going to be a long day; it's going to be
filled with a lot of emotion. But hopefully,
all that hard work is going to pay off real
soon.

JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stonford Daily
Former Cardinal QB Trent Edwards has seen his draft
stock soar in recent weeks, and now looks poised to
be the third quarterback chosen in 2007.
When former Stanford quarterback Trent Ed
wards '06 arrived on the Farm in 2002, USA
Today ranked him as the No. 1 incoming passer in
the nation. Now, even after four years without
The Axe, he's preparing to leave as perhaps the
third-most coveted collegiate quarterback in the
country.
In between were plenty of difficult years for
Edwards and Cardinal football. But if the "ex
perts" are to be believed, the injuries, struggles
and program-wide malaise that plagued Ed
wards' reputation in the intervening years may
be clearing. The latest rumors have the Detroit
Lions very interested in adding Edwards in the
second round, which would likely make him the
third quarterback taken in 2007, behind LSU's
JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady
Ouinn.
Edwards spoke with The Daily by telephone
on Tliesday, just hours after filming an interview
with ESPN's Jim Rome. Traveling the junket of
practices, coaches and press that come with
being an NFL recruit, Edwards shared his expe
riences.
The Stanford Daily: You have obviously been
putting a lot of effort into this whole NFL draft
process in recent months. Where's your mind at
now that the draft is so close at hand?
lYcnt Edwards. It's a goal that was set a long time
ago that I've been working towards. To actually
be less than a week away from (the draft) actual
ly happening is a very anxious feeling. I'm sure,as
we get even closer to it.the feeling will only grow,
but it's an exciting time. You get pulled in a lot of
different directions, but that obviously means
that people are interested, and that's what you
want. There are a lot of people that would want
to be in my situation, and I just try to think about
that every time things get hard.
TSI): Have there been any big surprises for you
going through this process of getting ready for
the draft?
TE: I think the one thing that suiprised me was,
at the Combine.it wasn't really just you working
out. You're part of a group of guys, and you're
running and throwing the ball with other guys. 1
was really picturing that the workouts at
the Combine would be a little bit more in
dividual and be a little bit more intense.
But honestly, it's quiet, the seats are empty
[at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis]. There
are obviously coaches and general man
agers there watching you. but there are
other groups working out, other people
switching in. It's really not what I antici
pated — that was probably the only sur
prise.
TSI): What was it like working out along
side some of the best talent from the colle
giate ranks? How do you think you meas
ured up against those guys?
TE: I actually enjoyed it. I enjoyed meet
ing the guys, and I'm a person that likes
watching other quarterbacks and watch
ing their mechanics to see what makes
them so accurate or able to throw the ball
so hard. So, I tried to just see the best of
those guys in my class throw the football
around. You hear a lot about them, but it
was just fun to see them in person and see
what they do best.
TSI): How is your health at this point?
Have you fully recovered from the broken
foot that ended your 2006 season with
Stanford?
TE: It's feeling really good right now. I
spent a lot of time rehabbing it right after
it happened in the months of November
and December and became best friends
with some physical therapists. It's really
paying off for me right now, because I
think we're five months out of it and I'm
not feeling any problems with my foot or
with any other part of my body.
TSI): Are there any places that you feel

FOOTBALL

UP NEXT _
STANFORD SPRING GAME
4/28 Stanford Stadium
GAME NOTES: Stanford football will take to the field
for its annual spring scrimmage, hopefully, in the
words of coach Jim Harbaugh, with "an enthusi
asm unknown to mankind." The team will divide up
into Cardinal and White squads and square off in a
contest sure to play a significant role in shaping the
team depth chart prior to this summer. Today will
mark the team's 14th and final practice of the
spring before tomorrow's intersquad competition.
Admission to the Cardinal and White game is free.

you would be most comfortable going, or
is it more of a 'wait and see' approach?
TE: It's more of a 'wait and see' thing. I'm
pretty open minded about it. There are

sive schemes they bring to the table. I'm a
