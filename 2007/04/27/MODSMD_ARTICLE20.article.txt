## Pilot compost program to run at Tresidder First Stanford Dining spot to go biodegradable 
### JENNIFER LIU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting today, students eating at
Union Square in Tresidder have the
option of composting their trash in
stead of tossing it. just in time to cap
off Earth Week. As the first step in
the complete transition to
biodegradable service ware at Stan
ford Dining retail locations, the
compostables will include cups,
plates, containers, straws and nap
kins made from sugar cane, potato
starch and corn starch.
The adoption of compostable
food service ware and packages was

inspired in part by the yearlong ef
forts of Dawn kwan '09 and Day
oung Lee '09, who worked with the
non-profit organization World Cen
tric for the community writing com
ponent of their Program in Writing
and Rhetoric class last spring. Their
collaboration with the Palo Alto
based group, which advocates and
produces compostable service ware,
eventually produced cost-benefit
analyses of adopting compostable
service ware for MoonBean's and
Ciao!,the basement cafe in theTer
man Engineering building.
The idea was appealing to Ciao!
owner Giuseppe Carruba, whose
cafes are not affiliated with Stanford
Dining. Last November. Ciao!
began offering biodegradable serv
ice ware at an additional cost of 15
cents per meal.

"Ciao! was really a pilot pro
gram. and the response was great,"
Kwan said. "About one in three peo
ple would choose compostable serv
ice ware. The problem was that be
cause it was only a partial transition,
it was difficult to keep the compost
from being contaminated with non
biodegradable trash."
Stanford Dining's new program
will introduce biodegradable service
ware to all of its restaurants and
cafes in collaboration with Meeting
Services at Tresidder, the Alumni
Association. Residential and Dining
Enterprises and Peninsula Sanitary
Services Inc. (PSSI), which currently
collects compost from campus din
ing halls. According to Julie Muir,
PSSI community relations manager,
the trash collection component will
be temporarily limited to Tresidder

to minimize contamination.
"There are a lot of details in
volved with collecting compostables
from the public." she said. "It's dif
ferent at the dining halls because it's
possible to train a certain number of
staff members and to keep compost
dumpsters locked. But cafes require
a different set of considerations, so
we plan to use Tresidder as a model
before applying it to the CoHo and
other eateries."
Student volunteers will be sta
tioned at Tresidder to help separate
compostable waste for the first week
of the program. Muir said that a sim
ilar approach was used successfully
at the Arbuckle Cafe at the Gradu
ate School of Business — not affili
ated with Stanford Dining — when
it went fully compostable in January.
"Not everyone reads the signs,so
it was helpful to have students be
visible reminders in the beginning,"
Muir said. "But recently, people
have been throwing their com
postables into the recycling bin. I
think education will have to be a
constant presence because com
posting is such a new thing that it
will be a while before doing it be

comes normal."
She added that purchasing com
postable service ware, even if it ini
tially ends up in the landfill instead
of the compost heap, is an impor
tant step forward.
"Buying compostable supports
the market," she said. "These prod
ucts will continue to he produced, and
1 have no doubt that they will eventu
ally be used at all cafes on campus."
Lee agreed.
"People are much more ready to
consider using biodegradable service
ware," she said."And if Stanford Din
ing rolls it out, other cafes will have
an incentive — economic and other

wise — to follow it. When the pro
gram at Tresidder is successful, we'll
have a much stronger case to push."
Hie transition to biodegradable
service ware is part of Stanford Min
ing's larger Earth Week celebration
today that includes the introduction
of a weekly produce stand at Tresid
der and "Eat Local" barbecues at
Tresidder, The Alumni Cafe and
Olives.
The Stanford Produce Stand,
which will be open from noon until
5 p.m. every Friday during the grow
ing season, will offer fruits and veg
etables from local farmers and co
ops. Staffed by student volunteers

from Students for a Sustainable
Stanford, the stand will also be a
pick-up site for a Community Spon
sored Agriculture collaboration.
Stanford community members will
be able to pre-order their produce
and pick it up from the stand.
Hie "Eat Local" barbecues will
run from II a.m. to 2 p.m. As part of
the Earth Week Celebration, com
plimentary food samples will be
provided at the CoHo and in front
of Dinkelspiel Auditorium begin
ning at 11 a.m.
