## Quiet plea for acceptance LGBT community, friends observe Day of Silence 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITic campus-wide Day of Silence took place
yesterday as a soundless declaration of unity in an
effort to draw attention to the "silencing" of indi
viduals throughout the country. Participants in
the "Breaking the Silence" event, led by the I es
bian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resources Center (LGBT-CRC), refrained from
speaking through the day until 8:15 p.m.
"Silence was a sign of solidarity to symbolical
ly encompass all those who are gay, either closet
ed or out. who suffer verbal abuse," said partici
pant Arthur Alvarez 'OS.
A nationwide Day of Silence,organized by the
national Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education
Network (GLSEN), takes place each April to
bring awareness to the persistent harassment that
members of the LGBT community suffer. While
the national event took place on April 18. the
LGBT-CRC chose to observe its own Day of Si
lence this week, so that the various activities of
Admit Weekend would not diminish its impact.
At noon in White Plaza. LGBT-CRC mem
bers distributed more than a hundred T-shirts
that were made specially for the event. The shirts
featured the slogan "Break Free" on the front,
and stated that the wearer's silence was volun
tary, while "the silence of many queer and ques
tioning youth worldwide is not." Members also

distributed red bandannas and masking tape on
which participants could write a message of their
choosing.
"I felt it was positive," said Devan Burke '10.
"In remaining silent, more people acknowledged
me and wanted to know why I was silent, and 1
could point to the message on the back of the
shirt."
The Day of Silence concluded in the LGBT
CRC office with approximately a dozen partici
pants joining hands in a circle as one of the coor
dinators counted down to five on her fingers,
after which those present broke the silence with a
collective scream. Afterward, some of the mem
bers shared pieces of spoken word poetry high
lighting LGBT themes, while others sang
karaoke or simply reflected on their day of si
lence.

According to Ariella Tai (W. members of the
LGBT community are constantly silenced or in
timidated into silence as a consequence of be
longing to a controversial minority that is not al
ways met with acceptance.
"1 just think it's generally a good experience," she
said. "You can see people passing by and reading
our T-shirts and the look tin their faces change."
I"he Day of Silence was first organized by stu
dents from the University of Virginia in 1996, ac
cording to GLSEN, to bring their plight into the
public's awareness and counter the silencing in
fluence of anti-LGBT attitudes. One year later.
The Day of Silence attracted national interest,
and GLSEN became its official sponsor in 2(X)1.
