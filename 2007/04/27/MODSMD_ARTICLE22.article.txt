## Editorial Board Address campus tragedies 
### 
It is a tough line to walk: simultaneously
respecting those affected by tragedy and
reassuring the community in a time of
crisis. ITiis year has seen numerous exam
ples of the administration's sincere efforts
to negotiate that line with the handful of
student suicides and most recently with its
response to Stanford students on the Vir
ginia Tech shootings.
But in each of those cases, we wish the
administration would have spoken directly
to all of us, or in instances in which they did,
perhaps spoken sooner. An unknown num
ber of classmates have taken their lives this
year with no acknowledgement at all by the
administration. Last week, it was more than
24 hours until we received an official re
sponse to the Virginia Tech tragedy.
Undoubtedly, many factors go into the
process for announcing a death in the com
munity or responding to a tragedy at anoth
er school. In phone and email conversa
tions, Director of University Communica
tions Alan Acosta and Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman said that the
issue of family privacy rights should not be

overlooked.
While Acosta acknowledged that "there
are a number of things you have to do right
away" when dealing with tragedy, we don't
understand entirely how the University's
support network of Counseling and Psycho
logical Services, the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center or the Office of Religious Life assists
students who are merely trying to deter
mine if the rumor of their classmate's death
is true or not.'lTiis year alone, rumors of nu
merous suicides plagued the student body,
and in those times it was hard to find a stu
dent who really knew the truth of what was
happening at Stanford.
Boardman's email to the student body
the day after the Virginia Tech shooting was
appreciated. Students needed to hear his
support — we just wish it had come a little
earlier. Iliose who live and work here ex
pect Stanford to be there for them. The stu
dent body was never notified after some sui
cides. We do not expect a front-page story in
the Stanford Report from the administra
tion. but we do hope for a brief message to
acknowledge a friend has passed away.
