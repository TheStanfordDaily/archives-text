# Farm 2.0
## 
### 
Sometimes I wonder if there's anyone
alive who's actually seen the Stanford
campus. Several people have, of course,
seen part of the campus. But the whole
thing? I'm not even sure it's possible.
The reason for this viewing difficulty is
not the immense size of the Farm, but rather
the ongoing Borgification (that's homoge
nization for the culturally illiterate) that
renders vast swathes of our surroundings
hidden behind a hanging curtain of perpetu
al construction.
Naively, one might think all this building
of buildings is a good thing. The onward
march to Bigger. Better and more Buxom
(okay. I'm taking liberties with the latter
but I live in hope) is surely a sign of progress.
I'm told the Toyota company motto ex
presses a sentiment of continual revision,
change and advancement. Evidently, many
at the University think the same way: I guess
these folks are incapable of walking past a
pretty building without wondering what it
would be like if one knocked it down and re
placed it with something ugly.
Now, all the best authoritarians had their
artists and architects — from the Medicis
and Michelangelo to Adolf Hitler and Al
bert Speer to Ayn Rand and I loward Roark.
Why shouldn't Leland Stanford Jr. be the
same?
I was tempted to assign the role of
Michelangelo/Speer/Roarkc to one of our
illustrious donors (maybe an Arrillaga, a
Hewlett, a Packard or a faceless tech-fund
ed foundation), but somehow that doesn't
really fit.
No, instead the part of the architect is
played by a shadowy figure whose name re
mains unknown, but whose aesthetic (or lack
thereof) is being carved (well,actually assem
bled from pre-fabricated wall panels) into
our university for a presumable eternity.
Large tracts of London were devastated
in its eponymous "Great Fire Of and many
sites were rebuilt under the direction of a
single man: Sir Christopher Wren. As result,
wandering through parts of the City is an ex
perience dotted with deja vu. It's also quite
pleasant; the unifying elements blend with
their surroundings: accenting, highlighting
and generally showcasing the brilliance of
both the city and the man.
Presumably the unnamed fellow respon
sible for the Stanford rejuvenation after the
Great Influx of Alumni Money has a similar
idea. Each of the (many) new buildings
being put up is part of a unifying scheme.
Sadly, neither the talent nor the design is
quite up to scratch.
I"he repeated motifs are certainly distinc
tive. though. There's the uncanny resem
blance each building has to an enlarged
port-a-potty — you know, a box with ever
so slightly rounded features tacked on in a
desperate attempt to escape the dreary lack
of functional features.
Speaking of toilets, the bathrooms all
have the same fixtures — including the
amazing paper towel trashcan, carefully de
signed to be completely incapable of hold
ing paper towels.
Then, of course, there are the unreason
ably high ceilings, long corridors and uni
form gray color scheme. Incidentally, by
long corridors, I mean "Green Mile" long —
complete with genuine prison feel (institu
tional gray says "death is imminent" like
nothing else) and morbid fear.
While on the subject of prison, we must
n't forget the doors. Until the day I die. I will
never forget the sound of a new Stanford
door closing. Ibwuck, click, pop. topped off

with a gentle thud. It gives me shivers just
thinking about the brushed aluminum,
rounded handles (sharp edges = bad)
arranged in rows and receding into eternity.
Now that I think about it. I guess there is
an overarching design principle here. It's
sort of like elementary school architecture.
First, take some boxes and assemble into a
shape (that's the kindergarten step). ITien
round all the edges. After, paint it gray. Fi
nally, collect a gold star and a contract to re
peat the process again and again and again.
IJglification is certainly bucking the
urban planning Zeitgeist, but maybe there's
some advantage in standing out from the
crowd. I mean, if you were in charge of Stan
ford's development and commissioned
something as ugly as the GCC, presumably
the only way to cover up the error is to hail
it as a success and keep building in the same
vein.
There is. as always, a slim chance that I'm
mistaken. In 200 years from now, perhaps
Stanford will be hailed as an architectural
gem. a masterpiece designed by a master be
fore his time. Or not.

No gender bias should he read into my assign
ment of masculinity to the anonymous archi
tect — / would hold a female equivalent in just
as much contempt. / am most definitely not
available at navins^stanford.edu. PS. / stole
this idea from David Starr
