# Why Google will keep you unemployed

Picture this: Three years from now,
you've finally gotten the chance to in
terview for your dream job. You have a
flawless resume, near-godlike endorsements
from your references, and you're dressed to
resemble a young Republican, circa 1986. In
essence, you are the model of employability.
But there's a catch: Someone at the firm has
Googled you. and because of the results,
there's no way that you'll get a job with the
company. Not now, not three years from now,
not ever. No one will bother to tell you what
they found, no one will ask you for an expla
nation. and you will never know why you
were rejected.
When you were in college, you had a po
litical radio show with your friends. When
you were in college, someone took a picture
of you in your Exotic Erotic costume. When
you were in college, you had an article in the
campus newspaper about watching someone
do drugs while you were abroad.
Hiree years later, your prospective em
ployer discovered all of this in 10 minutes of
mouse-clicks. Long after you took down your
radio podcasts, sound-bites are still on
dreamboy237's webpage.That Exotic Erotic
picture of you wearing a trout, and only a
trout, somehow surfaced on the fourth page

of your image search results. Your article
about watching junkies shoot up is still your
third hit when you search for your name on
Google.
I had never bothered to think about the in
formation I was leaking onto the Internet until
my friend was Googled by his parents last
week. My friend's mother, who currently has
80 resumes of recent MBA graduates stacked
on her desk, informed my friend that she
would never consider hiring him. His search
results were far too controversial for her firm.
My friend's Google search results were
the sort that you would expect from a typical
college male, and may or may not have in
volved a picture of him wearing a hot dog
bun and strategically squirted ketchup. Does
this picture merit ridicule and jokes about

my friend's wiener? Cleary, yes. Does this
picture merit my friend's flat-out rejection
for a job? I don't think so, but his mother cer
tainly does.
My friend's search results led me to ask
other people if they knew what came up
when they Googled their name, and if they
were comfortable with the results. When 1
asked a fellow (and far more controversial)
columnist these questions, he retorted that
of course he knows what comes up — he
simply doesn't give a damn. According to his
logic, if a company doesn't hire him because
he wrote an expletive-riddled column in his
college days, he probably wouldn't want to
work for the company anyway.
But there is a problem with the "This is
me, and you can take it or leave it" mindset:
Attitudes change, interests transfer, but your
I'W R project about vibrators stays the same.
The idea of dropping the formalities in
the workplace is by no means new, especial
ly here. Hell, this is Silicon Valley.This place
is ruled by socially-limited dweebs who
couldn t learn the stuffy social codes of the
East ( oast it a date with Lara Croft depend
ed on it. If there exists a group of people in

the world who have challenged how
we're supposed to behave in the
workplace, they're lurking on Sand
Hill Road.
But don't be fooled — a few
nutty wonks at Xerox Park most
likely won't be interviewing you for
your next job. Although society has
traditionally allowed for geniuses to
be a bit off, you are probably not
smart enough to pass through on
your brilliance alone. You'll have to
check out with conservative Molly
McCurmudgeon from HR, who will

hate you not only for your loud pink
shirt and rumpled suit jacket, hut
also for your MySpace account that
has "Get Low" set as its homepage
song.
Hopefully, when our generation
rises to power, we will replace the
current workforce's uptight mental
ity with free espresso machines, of
fice happy hours and a general un
derstanding that the information
age makes it impossible to conceal a
liberal college pastime. However, in
the meantime, you had better hope
that you have nothing to hide.

Why bother googling Jackie when you
can e-mail her at jaberQstanford.edu?
So don 't do it. The results are boring.
Really bonne.
