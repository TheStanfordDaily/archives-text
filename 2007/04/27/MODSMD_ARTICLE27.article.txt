# Bad numbers, good people
## 
### 
From your student ID (04847828) and
your beloved PO box (16623) to your
SUNet password and your GPA (just
kidding), series of digits have a way of
snaking behind you as you trek across cam
pus. But for all the numbers that define the
Stanford experience, few are held more near
and dear to the heart than the randomly as
signed, computer-generated integers that
determine your housing destiny.
Yes. it's that time of year again. Rush is
over, bids have been handed out, and pledge
parties will start cropping up just as soon as
the brothers can get their hands on some ply
wood and chicken wire. Future staff mem
bers have nearly completed their application
process and anxiously await the day when
appointments are announced (May 3). And
everyone who has not gained housing immu
nity is trying to choose roommates while los
ing as few friends as possible. Indeed. Draw
is upon us.
As if navigating the drawmate selection
process was not daunting enough, the calen
dar of deadlines associated with Draw is
enough to send anyone packing in the direc
tion of a Dead Mouse. Today, for example,
priority applications are due. Last week, any
athlete going through disability draw had to
turn in their forms, too.
Although it's hard to believe that any
thing still comes out in paper form — and
before its electronic version, no less, on

Wednesday, May 9 at 5 p.m., the dreaded/de
sired numbers will be posted at housing of
fices across campus. The preservation of the
posting ritual, with all of its anxiety and line
cutting and celebration-alongside-misery, is
quite reassuring to an old timer like me. With
all of the new buildings and policies and reg
ulations on campus, the public unveiling of
Draw numbers is a throwback to an era when
life was neither simpler nor easier.
Ask any alum what their Draw numbers
were and I'll bet he or she will be able to list
them in chronological order. He'll probably
do it with more than a touch of negativity,
too. Consider it the unavoidable Fall of
Draw: We all begin in the innocent garden of
pre-assigned freshman housing, are tempted
by the fantasy of single or double digits, and.
with the bitter aftertaste of a year in a four
class dorm in our mouths, end in cynicism.
At this point, I suppose I should own up
to my own insanely lucky housing experi
ence. After a year in an all-frosh dorm with

co-ed halls, 1 spent three straight years on
the Row (with the exception of a summer in
a first-floor single in Roble). Before you
stop reading or send me Facebook hatemail,
let me say this: I did not sleep with anyone in
ResEd; I just got lucky in a few other ways.
I remember my first Draw moment of
truth like it was yesterday. While one group
of double-digited girls celebrated and a
quartet of boys bemoaned their 1982.1 stood
in Stern's courtyard in unresolved limbo. My
1276 neither sealed nor screwed my fate.
With only one drawmate, I could feasibly
end up on the Row or in Mirlo — aside from
making reasonably intelligent choices (i.e.,
not ranking Bob. Mars, and Lambda Nu the
top three, followed by Stern. Wilbur, and
Mirrielees), there was nothing I could do.
Although I lucked into 592 (now Phi Psi)
and my roommate lucked into the best in
house draw number (much like the eternal
application gauntlet we run here. Draw is a
seemingly endless process). I decided I'd re
lied upon the benevolence of the Row gods
long enough.The following year. 1 joined the
ranks of Draw-immune staffers and
watched the bloodbath from my secure po
sition as the Head Theme Associate in La
Maison.
I didn't avoid the headache entirely —
there weren't enough singles in the house
for every staffer to have one — but 1 did get
first-pick of the eligible rooms and first-dibs

on my random roommate. I walked away
with ihe sweetest double in the house and
the roommate... let's just say that in Draw
statistics, as in life, one out of two ain't bad.
As an UIA responsible for awarding pri
ority to hopeful future residents, I've also
had the wonderful privilege of experiencing
the Draw process from the other side of the
desk. And let me tell you. it's no picnic for
ResEd, either. Scores of emails containing
the same questions, most of which are an
swered explicitly on the application, lots of
panicked "please accept this even though
its one hour/day late" pleas, and only a sin
gle tangible bribe to show for it. At least it
was a good bottle of wine.
Last but certainly not least, my senior
yeai I drew with a friend who had a legiti
mate disability, rhe slightly less legit piece of
the process — she was abroad Fall quarter,
but they agreed to let her draw with us any
way, and give us all disability preference —
ackfired when I got put in Bob's disability
room (shocking) and subsequently kicked
out when she returned. Casa (Italiana. not
Aapata), however, is hardly a poor consola
tion prize.
Aside from reliving my own Draw dra
mas. this column does have a single point to
make. For all of the bitching and moaning we
do about Draw, no housing on this campus is

truly terrible. The water runs, the
electricity works and the common
areas are cleaned for you. Add in
utilities, garbage, and maintenance
fees and the rent, it turns out, is not
all that high. If you want some hous
ing experiences to complain about,
just wait for your first apartment.
