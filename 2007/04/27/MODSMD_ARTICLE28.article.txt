## Playoffs shine for the NBA 
### 
Sometimes I hate the NBA. I'll
be sitting on my couch, watch
ing a regular season game be
tween the Clippers and Magic and be
thinking to myself, "Isn't there any
thing else on TV?" The lack of ener
gy, excitement and defense can often
be snore-worthy — there might not
be a duller regular season among the
major leagues.
The NFL's regular season is in
tense — even, strangely, in the pre
season. And of course, college bas
ketball and football are crazy from
the second that they tip and kick off.
Even baseball, a game that was
designed to be boring, has its stretch
run. One hundred sixty-two games of
basically the same thing would nor
mally lull you to sleep, but the whole
month of September makes up for it.
As for the NBA? It's different.
At times, it seems like every night
of the NBA season is a grind. Fans go
to the games, but they stay quiet most
of the time. Players suit up and take
the floor, but their demeanor and
lack of excitement makes you think
that you're at a mausoleum instead
of a basketball game.
Sure, this regular season had its
moments. Leßron provided a high
light reel every night. Kobe scored 50
points in each of four consecutive
games and good friends Steve Nash
and Dirk Nowitzki battled each
other in one of the best regular-sea
son games in NBA history. Still, the
mediocrity of the NBAs regular sea
son is something I can't forget.
But as mediocre and as lifeless as
its regular season can be, the NBA
makes up for it with the playoffs.
The NBA playoffs are a thing of
beauty. It's when some of the tallest,
quickest, most athletic and agile peo
ple in the world decide to come to
play. The games are spirited, action
packed and actually meaningful.
In recent years, the playoffs have
produced unforgettable moments.
Tim Duncan's fade-away, 22-foot
bank shot was erased by Derek Fish
er's heave with only 3 seconds on the
clock. In a play that seemed nearly
physically impossible, Detroit's
Tayshaun Prince chased Reggie
Miller all the way down the court,
stuffing the Hall-of-Famer's layup.
And who can forget the Robert
Horry shot that buried the Kings in
the 2002 playoffs? It's a play that I've
run through with my friends on the
basketball court hundreds of times.
And I'm not even a Lakers fan.
As for this year's playoffs, I'm al
ready excited. There are just so many
questions that need to be answered.
Will Kobe be able to take on the Suns
single-handedly? Can Leßron lead
the Cavaliers to the finals? What
about the Warriors, a team that has
n't made the playoffs in over a
decade? How will they hold up?
The possible match-ups we might
see are mouth-watering: Just the
thought of Dallas and Phoenix going
at it during a seven-game series
should make even the most casual of
basketball fans drool with glee.
The playoffs remind me why I
watch the NBA in the first place.
They make me realize how great of a
game basketball is.The NBA slogan
"I love this game" sure is tacky, but
when the playoffs are in full gear, I
can see whnt they're talking about.
Even the corny theme songs the
League adopts every year (with past
greats such asllie Black Eyed Peas'
"Let's Get It Started" and Christina
Aguilera's "Stronger") get my blood
flowing.
So, I guess I really do like the
NBA after all. Or, at least we're still
working on our love-hate relation
ship. In Facebook terms, it's compli
cated.
As for my predictions, I like the
Mavericks out of the West and the
Cavaliers out of the East.
The Mavericks are the best team
in basketball and probably should
have won the title last year. As for the
Cavaliers pick, the only thing I can
say is that I am still a believer in the
Church of Bron-Bron.
"King" James will work wonders,
but in the end I'll take the Mavericks
in six, as Dallas owner Mark Cuban
will finally win that elusive first title.
