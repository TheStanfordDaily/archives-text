## CARD LOOKING FOR PAYBACK Reigning champion Beavers visit Diamond 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball, having struggled all
season to live up to expectations, is due for
an emotional kick-start. And with reigning
national champion Oregon State visiting
Sunken Diamond this weekend, the Cardi
nal could be in for just that.
Last season, the Beavers (32-8, 4-5 Pa
cific-10 Conference) swept the Cardinal
(17-21.2-10) out of the Corvallis Super Re
gional of the College World Series, defeat
ing Stanford in two games. As junior right
fielder Michael Taylor explained, Stan
ford's recent history against Oregon State
certainly leaves room for improvement.
"Last year, they kind of handed it to us
all throughout the year." he said. "We got
swept up there, embarrassed a little bit.
And then the regionals — the last game, we
were obviously embarrassed."
Indeed, the Beavers trounced the Cardi
nal in its final game of the year. 15-0. After
a tremendous late-season push, during

which Stanford went 14-5 to enter the best
of-three series in Corvallis, Ore., the defeat
was all the harder to stomach.
"So they're coming in tomorrow night.

and they're obviously a very talented,
very good team, but we're going to be
looking to stay focused and stay .
locked in,"Taylor said. " Play well — U

that's our first focus — but obvious
ly in the back of everyone's mind.

especially the guys who were
here last year, is to exact a

little bit of revenge and play well at home,
and kind of defend our home turf a little bit
against a team that handed it to us pretty
well last year."

The Cardinal will face an uphill
battle in that task as Oregon State
comes into the series leading the

Pac-10 and ranking eighth na
tionally in team ERA (3.04),
while limiting its opponents to

three or fewer runs in 24 of 40
games this season. In contrast.

Stanford has notched a team ERA of 6.05.
Before Wednesday's 7-2 non-conference
win over Fresno State, the Cardinal pitch
ing staff had allowed 30 runs over the pre
vious four games.
True-freshman right hander Jeffrey
Inman has been a key member of the Car
dinal's rotation this season, and will start
against the Beavers this Saturday. Inman
believes the team's misfortunes against
Pac-10 opponents in the pitching game can
be corrected with better focus.
"1 think we kind of lose our focus a little
bit in the games." he said. "We need to just
kind of incorporate the things we're learn
ing in practice into the games. Whether it's
keeping the ball down or having a better at
tack about you, we just need to come out
firing, all cylinders going."
The Cardinal has had difficulties at the
plate as well, leading Taylor to hope that a
renewed emphasis on fundamentals can
ramp up its run production.
"When you're struggling, you're kind of
reeling, looking for a lot of different things,
a lot of different solutions," he said. "So
hopefully, we can just keep things simple.
That's one thing that everyone talks about:
'When things aren't going well, get back to
the basics: keep it simple." And that's what
we've been trying to do. So if we can do that
against a very good pitching staff, we've got
an opportunity to be pretty successful."
Stanford's hopes in the Pac-10 have
taken a significant blow in recent weeks, as
the Cardinal will still be looking for its first
series win against a conference opponent
this weekend. After last season's remark
able turnaround from a 2-7 league record,
however, Oregon State coach Pat Casey
still believes his squad has to be wary as it
takes to the road.
"Stanford is one of the top programs in
the country." Casey told OSUbeavers.com.
"And it's always going to be a challenge to
play them — especially in their own ball
park. No matter what that record looks
like, they're a very dangerous team."

effort in all aspects of play to begin
to turn the season around with some
wins against a conference rival.
"We've got to be solid in all phas
es of the game," Inman said. "We've
been hitting a little better lately, but
pitching has got to come around.

We've had a couple of guys get some
experience in the past few games.
