## Comp. Sci. recruits women Thinning numbers in faculty and student ranks spurs outreach 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Universities nationwide have been making ef
forts to increase the number of women in com
puter science (CS). a field that has experienced a
precipitous decline in both the number and per
centage of female students in recent years.
Stanford is no exception to this dwindling of
female students, as only 13 percent of CS under
graduates are female this year, down from 24 per
cent in the 1999-2000 school year. In an attempt
to "debug" this trend at Stanford, faculty, staff
and students are taking action to recruit and re
tain the extremely low number of female com
puter scientists on campus.
Potential reasons for the decline of women in
CS, as described in a 2002 paper CS Prof. Eric
Roberts co-wrote with former students Marina
Kassianidou '02 and Lilly Irani "02, are the lack of
female role models and supportive peer commu
nities.
"Women tend to enter college with less com
puter science experience than men and tend to get
disproportionately discouraged by introductory
weeder' courses," said Ellen Spertus, associate
professor of CS at Mills College in Oakland. "Even
when they earn good grades in these classes, they
fear that they don't belong in CS and leave."
Hie president of Stanford Women In Com
puter Science (WICS) Zoe Chu. a CS graduate
student, believes that the "nerdy" stereotype of
CS students who code all day and night "discour
ages young female students, who don't feel that
they belong in the geeky, male-dominated field."
"We should let female students know that the
CS program is not all about coding," Chu said."Pro

gramming is the Ux)l to help us solve problems. In
fact, one of the most important characteristics for
computer scientists is creativity. It is essential to
break stereotypes and change the CS program in to
an encouraging environment by changing percep
tion of CS and adding more [female] perspectives."
Recognizing the need for a supportive environ
ment for female computer scientists, Stanford stu
dents organized WICS in October 2002. According
to Chu. the organization provides speaker series,
workshops, mentoring programs and social events
for female CS students. WICS also sponsors mem
bers who attend The Grace 1 lopper Celebration of
Women in Computing Conference,the largest con
ference for women in the technical field.
Other initiatives include offering an introduc
tory course aimed at exposing more students to
the field, increasing the number of role models at
every stage of the pipeline, working with bridge
programs that support young students in their
early years and providing additional research op
portunities through the Computer Science Un
dergraduate Research Internship. It is also par
ticipating in the Academic Alliance of the Na
tional Center for Women in Information Tech
nology to develop additional strategies.
In addition to supporting students once they
enroll. Stanford is focusing on female recruiting
tactics.
"We include women on all search committees
and work hard to identify qualified candidates
from underrepresented groups," said a group of
CS faculty and staff, led by Department Chair
Bill Dally and Director of Admissions Kathleen
DiTommaso, in an email to The Daily. "Despite
these efforts, our results in this area are poor and
we need to do more."
While the department hopes to recruit more
women, it is confident about the small number of
women who are currently studying CS at Stan
lord.
"There is some evidence at Stanford that we

are retaining the best women students," the group
said. "Despite the relatively low percentage of
women in the major overall, one third of this
year's graduates with distinction are women."
In expansion efforts, Roberts is convinced
that Stanford should focus on increasing the
number, as opposed to the percentage, of women
in the CS department.
"Stanford has a larger number of computer
science majors than most of our peer institutions
in comparison to the size of the student body
overall," he said. "As a result, we have graduated
a larger number of students — and a larger num
ber of women — than schools of a comparable
size. Moreover, national enrollment data suggest
that increasing the number of students has the ef
fect of increasing the percentage of women,
which has certainly held true at Stanford."
