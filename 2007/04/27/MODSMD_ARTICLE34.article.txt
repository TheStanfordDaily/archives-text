## GET KNOCKED UP 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION KNOCKER UPPER 
Judd Apatow made a lot of people fans with his
memorable show "Freaks and Geeks." He made an
entire industry take notice with 2()os's "The 40 Year
Old Virgin." Yet many thought his next film with a rel
atively starless cast was a recipe for disaster. Where
was Steve Carell? But "Knocked Up" proves that
Carell was not the only thing funny about "Virgin."
Apatow's latest project casts Seth Rogen in the lead,
reprising his role as a lovable stoner from the previous
film. Rogen's character, Ben Stone, is an unemployed
Canadian who lives with several like-minded losers
that dream of setting up a porn site dedicated to
celebrities. Alison (Katherine Heigl), meanwhile, is
on the fast track to success on E! television, and is just
celebrating a huge promotion when the two collide for
a fateful one night stand. The awkward nine months
that ensue are chronicled alongside the troubled mar
riage of Alison's sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann). and her
husband Pete (Paul Rudd).
Like in "Virgin," Rudd once again rattles off self
deprecating one-liners as his character espouses envy

over Ben's lifestyle while"enlightening him" on the
horrors of marriage. The chemistry between the two is
fantastic, and their banter is funnier than any star
studded buddy comedy in years. The potential flaw
with this movie is that it is constantly funny, both bit
ingly honest in its portrayals of relationships and
inanely weird at times. The jokes and story are well
paced and interlaced from the opening credits to the
scene where Ben and Pete go to Cirque de Soleil high
on mushrooms to the final scene in the hospital. The
problem is simply that during the over-the-top scenes,
the audience will be laughing so hard they'll actually
miss some of the clever dialogue that has become Ap
atow's trademark. Rogen and Rudd are stellar, but the
movie also features a series of cameos and minor char
acters that provide a constant flood of jokes. The au
dience was cheering every time the passive-aggressive
producing assistant came on camera and Pete and
Debbie's morbid little daughter was hilarious.
Apatow has made his trademark in poignant
comedies about human relationships that are
naively charming, and at times, irreverently funny.
