# Movies to prep you for real life, after Stanford
## 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION SENIOR 
In honor of this "Ode to Seniors" edition of
Intermission, I have been assigned the task of
discussing movies that concern graduating and
entering the real Svorld. After much contem
plation, I've decided that these flicks normally
fall into one of a few categories. They are dis
cussed below:
1. "I will go to law school or medical
school and it will be exciting" -

We've all heard the some
k times nausea-inducing
Jjk cliche that graduating is

just the beginning. For
.some, graduating is
merely the beginning
'I of a whole lot more
school. Grad School.
Law School. Medical
School. M.D. Ph.D.

yr MD/Ph.D. J.D. Have you
v ever noticed how movies
which detail the life of a law

112 student or a medical student al
ways make their lives seem really
exciting? Let's look at law school.
Hlle Woods gets to defend a mur
der suspect in "Legally Blonde"
(2001) as a first year law student
(did anybody ever check if the
* technicality that allowed EHe to
1 appear in court was actually
. . legit?). In "The Pelican Brief"

(1993), law student Darby Shaw writes a the
sis exposing a government conspiracy and
everybody wants to kill her. Fortunately, I'm
pretty sure that law school, medical school
and all other graduate programs are far more
mundane than these movies make them out
to be (though perhaps some
fordile will prove me wrong)
go?" Don't be depressed — I am sure that it
will be time well spent — but that description
sounds far more accurate.
2. "1 will wipe someone's ass to fulfill my
dreams and it will all be worth it" - Can you be
lieve how much "The Devil Weprs Prada"
(2006) glorified being somebody's servant and
being; treated like dirt? As many times as Andy
(Anne Hathaway) got spat on by Miranda
(Meryl Streep) in this film, her life still man
aged to seem ptelty cool. She got to travel. She
got an entire wardrobe of beautiful, free de
signer clothing. She became wiser and more as
sertive. Then, she left the hellish job with allof
her dignity in tow (which. I might add. is noth
ing like how the book ended where Andy did
not leave out of principle, but got fired for
telling Miranda in so many words to go &%*#
herself)- Finally, Andy managed to find her
true dream job which the film implies she never
would have gotten had she not gotten the life
experience from the almost-yearof almost-but
not-really hell.
3. "I will be an inspiring teacher" -
There are so many of these movies that they

' •deserve their own category. Touchers break
through to "tough" students (think "Stand
and Dfeiiver" (1988), "Dangerous Minlf"
(1995), the recent "Freedom WriteßJ
(2007)). Teachers teach students to apprejjtl
ate the arts (think Jack Black in "School m
Rock" (2003)). Then there's the fusion vari
ety: Teachers break through to "tougb" stu
dents using the arts (think Antorito Banderas
in "Take the Lead" (2006)). Are there tcach
ersf tklaren't inspiring? Ryai'Gosl.ijjPis high
on drup'%uring the recent indfc fltek ..'iHalf
Nelson" he still manages to benfe
spiring. Teach for Americans, you have yoja
work cut out for you!
4. "Uh oh. The world seems to be a rcfi#
ly corrupt place. Have 1 become corrupted
too?" - Is greed good? In movies such as "Rpil#
er Room" (2000) and "Wall Street" (I'WW
young hotshots get posh investment jobs lip
great pay, only to find out that the comjkiy
they are working for does things that are jm[ a
little bit morally and ethically unsound,
ly. the companies are flatout corrupt.'lftaase
these films (as well as various events covered in
the news throughout the past five years) did not
hammer out the point enough, insider trading is
wrong. Sojs accounting fraud. So is "pumping
and dumping". Stay honest '07.
5 . "My life has turned out shitty."-The
best representative in this category is "Amer
ican Beauty" (1999). Kevin Spacey is miser
able at his desk job. Annette Bening is a mis
erable realtor. This movie represents all that
wc do not want our lives to become. Howev
er. what I love about this movie is that a1(1993),

though we ail know Kevin Spacey's ultimate
fate, he demonstrates that it is never too late
to make changcs in your life (though he did
take that sentiment to a little bit of an ex-,
treme).
6. "We're disillusioned with life so' we're
merely gging to put in on hold while we figure
our shit out. |n the meantime, we'll find our
selves some love" - What movies ami talking
about here? Tree's obviously the 1967 classic
(which would be sacrile
gious to omit ja a column about movies con
cerning gradyMion), but let's look at some J
more contemporary flicks. In the mid '90s we
had "Reality Bites" (1994), where a pre-'
shoplifting Winona Ryder attempted to find
love and meaning in her life. Then there's
"Garden State" (2004), which I would say is our
generation's equivalent — where a depressed"
and confused Zach Braff goes home, recon
nects with old friends, finds love (in four days,
mind you), finds meaning, etc. Some people
loved this film and some thought it was incred
ibly overrated, but nobody can disagree that lis
tening to Frou Frou's "Let Go" (played promi
nently during the movie and all of its trailers)
won't inspire you to get off of your ass and ac-1
complish something!
Notice how there is no category in this col- !
umn entitled, ''Life is good, with just the right
amount of excitement." That is merely because
movies only go, for extremes. However v that's
the category that HI be shooting for. and I hope ,
to find many of you pursuing it with me come
mid June. Happy graduation!
