## John Butler: A 'Grand' new CD 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION BUTLER 
With a scraggly beard, matching tattoos
around both forearms and long blonde
dreads, John Butler looks the part of a hippy
musician.
John Butler has taken a seemingly impos
sible yet suitingly grassroots route to becom
ing an internationally recognized musician.
Born in California to an American mother
and an Australian father, Butler moved
Down Under at the age of 11 with his family.
Five years later he inherited his grandfather's
vintage 1930's Dobro guitar, now one of his
most prized possessions, on which he started
practicing open tuning, a common blues tech
nique that allows chords to be easily played
underneath a melody. Growing up,
practiced all types of music, ranging from
Celtic and Indian to reggae and follj blend
ing and borrowing sounds while slowly build
ing his own tastes. After Butler's first year at-.
Curtin University in Perth, where he was
studying to be an art teacher, he left school
at the age of 21 to "busk,"or play in public
spaces for tips, in the markets of nearby
Fremantle. i
In 1996, due to popular demand, Butler i
recorded an original cassette (which now
seems laughably quaint) of instrumental
entitled, "Searching for Heritage," which J
sold 3,500 copies. By 1998, John had formed*
the first of his trio (although multi
ple band members would later leave to start

their own bands) and used the profits of
his first humble recording to finance
The John Butler Trio's first CD,

"Three," which went platinum in
Australia and landed the group
squarely in the Australian inde-

pendent musical scene. After
"Three," the trio opened for $1
John Mayer and the Dave
Matthews Band around the Unit-

Ed States. With fellow Aussie band The
Waifs, the trio started the independent label
Jarrah Records, under which the band re
leased their second album "Living 2001-
2002," and 2003 CD "Sunrise Over the Sea,"
which won the Australian Performing Rights
Association "Song of the Year," "Best Inde
pendent Release", and "Best Blues and
Roots Album." (Butler also won "Best Male
Artist that year.) On March 27, the band re
leased it's latest album, "Grand National,"
with plans to tour in Europe and the United
States.

The trio's music is both popular

and exciting for
many reasons,

but per-

haps the greatest source of its allure and in
trigue lies in the rather indefinable sound.
"Grand National" mixes reggae, folk and
bluegrass influences into a jam band-meets
acoustic sound — a folksier Jack Johnson
melded with an indier 0.A.1L "Groovin'
Slowly" has a definitively regg Je. beat while
"Good Excuse" has strong bluegrass influ
ences. The bold "Gov Did Nothing" reeks
of jazz, and the CD's first single "Better
Than" is a relaxed foot-tappin' jam. Butler
seems to relish the band's conglomerate
sound and the confusion it poses for Bor
ders' poor CD-genre-filing employees.
g When asked about his

influences for the
album he
replied,

"People ask me what direction we are tak
ing on 'Grand National,' and I always just
say the direction was forward — elaborat
ing on our style rather that reinventing a
style, we are actually broadening it."
Butler's musical intermingling is coupled
with his very real talent. He is an astound
ingly gifted guitarist with some of the nim
blest hands — and longest nails —in the
business. (Check out the You Tube video in
which he performs the instrumental song
"Ocean." You have to see and hear his light
ening-fast fingers to believe it.) Layered on
top of Butler's musical stylings are his
unique lyrics, which range from poetical to
political. Butler decries complainers and
consumerism in "Good Excuse," urging us
to "Go take a step outside see what's shak
ing in, the real world." In "Nowhere Man"
he quite poignantly describes his lack of be
longing singing "All my life I've lived on the
outside/ and now I'm in, but in nowhere."
k "Gov Did Nothing" critiques the U.S.'s

government's response to Katrina while
"Fire in the Sky" is about living in a post
-9/1 1 world. Butler gets quieter on "Los
ing You," which is a touching love song,
sharply contrasting the appropriately ti
tled "Funky Tonight" which is both
about getting your funk on in the dance
sense and the passionate sense.
"Grand National" debuted at #1 in Aus-

Wtralia and stands as #110 on Billboards Top
200, and is listed as on Billboard's "Heat
seeker" chart as #1. Starting from John But
ler's humble roots as street performer, the

John Butler Trio have lost none of its
authenticity and creativity as it be
comes one of the few bands to
successfully bridge the indie-

commercial gap.
