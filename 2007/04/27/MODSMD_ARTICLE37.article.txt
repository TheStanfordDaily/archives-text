### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION GRADUATER 
You've made it. Four years after your freshman RA creepily
knew your name before you even arrived on campus, it is time to
leave — free yourself from the chains of Meyer, the lines at
Moonßean's and extreme expectations. Graduating, though, as
we all know, is a big deal. Along with the sheer euphoria comes
desperation and mourning for the ending of an era in your life.
What better way to express the schizophrenia than through a
Graduation Playlist! Nothing captures complex emotions better
than song. Especially "We Are the Champions," "School's
Out," "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)," "I Will Remem
ber You," "Time After Time," "I Don't Want to Miss A Thing,"
"Closing Time" and EVERY. OTHER. CLICHED. SONG.

GAH. These songs are what you really need ...
1. "Ventura Highway" — America
A free wind is blowing through your hair, niy friend. Liberation!
Finally!
2. "Send Me On My Way" — Rusted Root
This song embodies sunshine and joy — listen to it when you are
so pumped about graduating that your chest feels like it's going
to explode. Rusted Root will mellow you out.
3. "Best of What's Around" — Dave Matthews Band
For when the realization hits you that your friends are going to
be in every corner of the country because you are all that fabu
lous.

4. "We Go Together" — from Grease
Why don't we get an end-of-school carnival? With choreo
graphed spontaneous dancing and flying cars? Oh well, I guess
you'll have to fall hack upon your Stanford degree.
5. "Here Comes the Sun" — George Harrison
Just roll with the metaphor.
6. "Maps" — Yeah Yeah Yeahs
Tragically beautiful. For those moments you know that no one
will ever know vou the wav your Stanford friends have.
