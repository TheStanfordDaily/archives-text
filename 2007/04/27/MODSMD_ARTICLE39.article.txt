"Battle Royale" (Japan, 2000)
If a violent X-Box 2 action video game Is made
into a non-ani-

mated movie,
"Battle Royale"
is the product. In
Japan, the edu
cation system
lias gone out of
control: Students
not only disobey
their teachers
but also abuse
ihem. To teach
them a lesson,
the military gov
ernment intro
duces the Battle
Royale Act, ac-

cording to which a randomly chosen class is sent
off to a deserted island with limited supply of food,
water, a map and weapons. In a matter of three
days, the students are to kill each other until only
one of them remains. Refusal to participate and
failure to follow the rules result in an instant death.
What makes the movie interesting is that, it is not
twi > -dimensional as the video games: There are vi
olent and brutal killings like in any violent video
games but, "'Battle Royale" also has stories to tell.
"Salaam Bombay!" (India, 1988)
If Bombay evokes Bollywood movies

with songs and dances, and no palpable sto
rylines, you must watch this movie. This is a
movie about street children in Bombay
where they grow up with prostitution, drug
addiction and domestic violence. Mira Nair,
the director (of the recent "The Name
sake"), saves this movie from being a
human-rights documentary (I'm not saying
that such documentaries are bad) by sticking
true to the reality of street children and pre
senting a story as it is without pressuring the
audience with demands for change. Of
course, in the end, the movie will leave us
feeling selfish, worthless and challenged
about the knowledge of life, but it does not
ask for it.
"The Lives of Others" (Germany, 2006)
Communism and socialism fascinate me —
mostly because I don't understand them. In
East Germany, the lives of a playwright and his
stage actress wife are under the surveillance of
socialist government. Their apartment is wire
tapped and a secret service agent listens to
them for 24 hours trying to find a proof of any
affiliations with the right-winged West Ger
many. Predictably, the secret agent is drawn
into their lives but the atmosphere that is creat
ed by the repercussions of this fascination is
what makes the story unforgettable.
"Tampopo" (Japan, 1985)
If asked about food and orgasm in movies, one
quickly remembers Meg Ryan's role in "When
Harry Met Sally," but that is so because few have

watched this Japanese comedy. Who could have
thought that a live lobster provides you a sexual
pleasure and the cholesterol rich yolk of an egg
leads you to an orgasm? As hinted, the movie Ls
about food. Even though the main story is about a

woman learning to
make noodle soups for
business, there are side
stories (err, like the
eroticism of food), to
keep one entertained.
"The Spirit of the
Beehive" (Spain,
1973)
Ever wondered
what could have in
spired Guillermo del
Toro's "Pan's
Labyrinth"? Yes it is

"El Espiritu de la
Colmena." Like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006), this
movie is about the interplay between a fairy
tale and Spanish civil war but this is where the
similarity ends. Two young girls, after watching
a movie about Frankenstein, are fascinated by
the monster and decide to look for it. As the
search goes on. the world of the younger girl in
particular is engulfed by her own fantasy and
belief in the existence of Frankenstein. Howev
er, the strength of the movie lies not only in the
story but also in the captivating and haunting
eyes of that little girl which sparkle with a
child's innocence and curiosity.

"Oldboy" (South Korea. 2003)
This is a psychological thriller in every
sense of the word. On his daughter's birth
day, a man is kidnapped and imprisoned in
a room for 15 years. Upon his release which

is as mysterious as his imprisonment,
the man seeks nothing but vengeance.
In this quest, he enlists the help of a
young woman and indeed he succeeds
in finding his captor. But as he recalls
the relationship with the captor in the
past, the story takes a turn none could
have imagined. With twists that pro
pels the story forward instead of losing
it, this movie will leave you cursing
until your mouth goes dry. It is not your
typical hero-seeks-revenge-and-gets-it
movie.
"Children of Heaven" (Iran, 1997)
Think of "Little Miss Sunshine" (2006)

making you cry and you will get this movie
— even though that's a gross simplification and
you might not agree with me. There is no yel
low bus, no dysfunctional family and no beauty
pageant. However, there is an adventure — an
adventure of a young boy who loses his sister s
pair of shoes. His family is poor and can not af
ford to buy a new pair. He promises to lend his
shoes to the sister for school if she promises not
to tell their father. In the meantime he must ei
ther find the lost shoes or somehow get new
ones. The resulting cute and innocent sibling
love depiction is what will make you smile and
crv simultaneously.
