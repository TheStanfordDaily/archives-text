# W WATER POLO
## Polo surges toward MPSF title No. 1 Stanford looks to capture MPSF title "Every team is going to be coming after us like they've got nothing to lose." 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
If the members of the Stanford
women's water polo team had gone to
Vegas three months ago to place a bet
that they would be the No. 1 team in
the nation at the end of the regular
season, they likely wouldn't have got
ten very good odds.
Hut today,that bet would be paying
off rather handsomely. When the top
ranked Cardinal rolled into Tempe.
Ariz, for this weekend's Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federatioif tournament,
the squad was riding the momentum
of a 21-game winning streak that has
kept it atop the national rankings for
the last month.
Ilie Stanford women (23-1, 12-0
MPSF) have defied nearly every ex
pectation set for them this year. Com
ing off a third-place finish at the
NCAA Championships last season
and having lost three graduating sen
iors, the Cardinal wasn't expected to
stack up with powerhouse rivals
U( LA and Southern California dur
ing the 2007 campaign.
But after losing to USC in its third game of
the season, the Stanford squad proceeded to
knock off both the Women of Troy and the de
fending national champion Bruins twice apiece
over the remainder of the season. In doing so, the
team claimed the top spot in the rankings as well
as the No. 1 seed in the upcoming conference
tournament.
Nevertheless, the Stanford women refuse to
take their success for granted after ranking third
in the preseason polls.
"To me and the other girls on the team, hav
ing the No. 1 ranking is just a number," junior
driver Jackie Gauthier explained. "No one ex
pected us to be number one at this point. No one
expected us to go 12-0 in the conference. In the
preseason rankings, some people wanted to put
us fourth or even lower, so we still view our
selves as the underdogs with something to
prove."
After notching a thrilling overtime victory
over No. 2 UCLA two weeks ago, the Stanford

squad wrapped up its regular season with a pair
of wins over No. 6 California and No. 8 San Jose
State to finish undefeated in conference play. But
the Cardinal certainly didn't cruise to victory in
either match, as both the Bears and the Spartans
rallied to force a tie in the final frame before ul
timately falling in defeat.
According to Gauthier. the challenges her
team faced last weekend provided a strong point
of focus for the week of practice leading up to
MPSFs.
"In our last two games, we sort of let the other

Jackie Gauthier, junior

teams play their games," Gauthier said. "But we
really want to make sure that we keep things
going according to our tempo, and that we don't
let anyone get us out of our game plan."
As the top seed in the MPSFTournament.the
Cardinal earned a bye in the first round of com
petition. Stanford kicks off its weekend against
No. 9-seed Irvine this afternoon. The contest is
scheduled to begin at 12:40 p.m.
r Fhe Cardinal has played the Anteaters once this
year, winning by a score of 10-3. But the Stanford
women know that every minute of every game is

critical at this point in the season — no matter
who the opponent.
"[Head coach John Tanner] emphasized to
us that every game from here on out's about
ending another team's season," Gauthier said.
"Every team is going to be coming after us like
they've got nothing to lose, and every game
starts ()-() [regardless of the rankings]."
In order to defend its 2(X)6 conference title,
the Cardinal will likely have to go through either
No. 2-seeded UCLA or No. 3-seeded USC In the
last five years, Stanford has won the MPSFcham
pionship twice, holding a 1-1 record against the
Women ofTroy and a 3-2 record against the Bru
ins in conference tournament competition dur
ing that time.
Ihe winner of this weekend's tournament
will automatically earn a berth in the eight-team
field for the 2(X)7 NCAA Championships, set for
May 11-13 in Los Alamitos, Calif.
