# W WATER POLO
## Polo surges toward MPSF title No. 1 Stanford looks to capture MPSF title "Every team is going to be coming after us like they've got nothing to lose." 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
If the members of the Stanford
women's water polo team had gone to
Vegas three months ago to place a bet
that they would be the No. 1 team in
the nation at the end of the regular
season, they likely wouldn't have got
ten very good odds.
Hut today,that bet would be paying
off rather handsomely. When the top
ranked Cardinal rolled into Tempe.
Ariz, for this weekend's Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federatioif tournament,
the squad was riding the momentum
of a 21-game winning streak that has
kept it atop the national rankings for
the last month.
Ilie Stanford women (23-1, 12-0
MPSF) have defied nearly every ex
pectation set for them this year. Com
ing off a third-place finish at the
NCAA Championships last season
and having lost three graduating sen
iors, the Cardinal wasn't expected to
stack up with powerhouse rivals
U( LA and Southern California dur
ing the 2007 campaign.
