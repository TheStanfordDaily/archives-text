# So, you're entering real life: Sorry, its not like TV
## 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION TIVOER 
I'm currently a senior at Stanford.
I his means that 1 will be graduating in
about 1.5 months. While many of my
friends arc already employed at
Google (an insanely popular destina
tion for newly-minted Stanford
grads). or are headed off to graduate
school or medical school. I'm still not
entirely sure what I am going to do
with myself. 1 know that I want to
work, but the obvious question which
follows is where'? I have ruled out
Google, but a whole lot of options re
main. However, as I peruse through
job listings each day. I frequently find
myself wondering if any of the jobs
that I am considering will be any fun (I
know, this very well may be an unrea
sonable expectation).
All of this stress from the job
search made me start to consider the

jobs that characters have on TV. I re
alized that many of these jobs seem
far more appealing than the ones
that I have been looking at thus far.
Therefore, if I could have my pick
from the crop of TV jobs, 1 think that
the jobs possessed by the TV charac
ters listed below seem like the best
options:
Carrie Bradshaw as a newspaper
columnist on "Sex and the City" —
Carrie has to be the luckiest journalist
(if we can call it that) in the world. Her
sole source of income appears to be
her "Sex and the City" column which
appears in the fictional New York
Star once a week. Furthermore, her
column is about half the length ol the
one I have written here and as any
body who has seen the show knows,
consists mainly of rhetorical ques
tions. Though she sometimes com
plains of financial troubles, with the

income from her weekly half-column
she manages to afford an apartment
on the Upper Hast Side, as well as a
wardrobe complete with $40,000
worth of designer shoes (calculated
by Carrie herself) and an unspecified
amount of designer clothing. She is
also frequently spotted in trendy New
York restaurants and hotspots. Not a
bad life!
Michael Scott as the boss on "The Of
fice" — I know that some people
have aspirations of changing the
world through their work. If that is
your goal than Michael Scott's job is
not for you, as he practically does no
work at all. On one episode of this sea
son of "The Office," secretary Pam
had to detail Michael's hourly activi
ties during a day of work for Corpo
rate. On that particular day.the log
detailed that Michael did Bill Cosby
impressions and stood in a pretzel

line. He also took a nap. One might
wonder if Michael's job of doing noth
ing gets boring, however I feel confi
dent that I could find ways to keep
myself busy.
John Dorian, aka JD as a Doctor on
"Scrubs" — While there are many
shows with doctors on them, I think
that JD on "Scrubs" has the sweetest
deal (those guys on "Grey's," "ER"
and "Nip/Tuck" live through an un
healthy amount of drama). He's a
goofy but competent doctor, who
cares about his patients, but also
seems to enjoy life himself. JD's job
has also not robbed him of his imagi
nation. as he frequently finds himself
engaging in an inner monologue
which places him in bizarre fantasy
world situations (such as taking over
roles in "Star Wars." the "Wizard of
Oz" and "West Side Story"). Last but
not least, JD seems to have enough

time to end his evenings in a har with
his friends where he normally orders
an appletini — "easy on the tini," of
course.
"Bakery Owner" — Anybody who
watches the show "Weeds" knows
that main character Nancy Botwin is
actually a surburban pot-dealer (who
in the most recent season has also ven
tured into growing her own product to
increase profits). The bakery —or
fakery — is just her cover-business to
deal with paying taxes and such. I
have say, while there is obviously
the concern of partaking in illegal ac
tivities, Nancy makes drug-dealing
seem pretty fun, effortless and prof
itable. In fact, other people have al
ready been inspired by Nancy, as I re
cently read an article that detailed
how an increasing number of middle
class suburban homes have been dou
bling as marijuana farms.
