## 'Doing' seniors... 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Roxy is well aware that the Class of
2007 will soon be leaving us for... what?
Bigger and better things? Pardon her, but
after Stanford, Roxy just doesn't think
anywhere else could possibly, um, mea
sure up. And if you've been reading Roxy
for four years, you know exactly what she
means.
Don't get her wrong. Roxy would like
to take this moment to extend her fullest
and heartiest congratulations to this
year's graduating seniors. Indeed, from
the infinite depths of her hospitable
bosom she wishes you well. But. by leav
ing the glory days of college behind, all of
you will take one step closer to becoming
quite a different kind of senior.
There was once a time when Roxy,
just like everyone else who gets into
Stanford, was busy padding her resume
(although she was no longer padding
her bra) with time commitments such
as community service, extracurricular
activities and of course full-time
skanking. She managed to fulfill
two of these vital aspects of her life
simultaneously when she started
volunteering at an assisted living
community in her

hometown. Come on, seniors. With four
years of a Stanford education under your
belt, you should know which two.
Anyway, it was here that Roxy first en
countered the other kind of senior. Roxy
does have grandparents, yes, but this was
different. This was perverted, and really
quite strange.
Let Roxy be clear about at least one
thing here. You know how women live
longer than men? Let's use our Stanford
trained analytical ininds to apply that idea
to the assisted-living environment. You
guessed it — nursing homes basically
give "big-pimpin"" a whole new meaning.
These men knew it, too. They would
wink at Roxy when

she came in to call
their bingo
games or
serve them
wine from
boxes. Roxy's
not going to go
into detail, but
sometimes there
was touching in
volved. Accidental
ly, of course, but real
ly how many times
can a girl reasonably
expect to be "pardon
me, miss"-ed in a given
shift?
At first, Roxy was
totally

grossed out. The elderly people she got

to know were mostly very sweet, but
some of them did things like wet their
flowery dresses at the dinner table

and hurl insults and bingo chips at
each other during happy hour.

Roxy realizes she can't really use
the not liking to think about peo
ple having sex excuse on this ex
perienced group of readers, but.

please. Do you get the idea?
So, the thought of these bald,
overweight men getting as
much in the bedroom as the
employees did not particular
ly whet Roxy's appetite. These
people had emergency alert but-

I tons in their bathrooms, and, honestly,
» how much Viagra does one man go
through in this place? But then Roxy had
i a brilliant revelation. Here was living (or
i in any case, not yet dead) proof that, as
; she had been saying alter approximately
> the age of two, it really is all about sex!
I Come on! These people were paying
: thousands of dollars a month to stay in
this rest home. It was the Club Med of as
sisted living communities. These people
had to have done well in their working
> lives to land in here for a little post-retire
/ ment nookie.
1 Any math major knows where Roxy's

ous! Clearly, these men and women had
> worked all their lives just to earn enough
! money to get in to these places. Once
there, they sit back and enjoy the

sex
at all hours,

because, really, whal

else is there to do? Bingo gets old
after about .006 milliseconds, Roxy
would know.
So, seniors. Go ahead and climb
that corporate ladder. Kiss as much
ass as you can possibly stomach.
But Roxy knows what you're re
ally about, even if you can't
admit it. And it's not such a bad
fate, after all. Just make sure
you schedule your senile sexy
time around when the nurse
brings you your hourly doses
of pills. Roxy wouldn't want
you to scar her future re
placements.
