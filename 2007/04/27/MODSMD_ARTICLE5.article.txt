## DESERT RIVALS COME KNOCKING No. 16 Card hosts No. 4 Arizona, No. 7 ASU 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
ITie No. 16 Stanford women's Softball
team will play a three-game set at home
this weekend, facing the top two teams
in the conference as the Cardinal looks
to avenge a trio of losses earlier this sea
son.
No. 4 Arizona (34-9. 10-2 Pacific-10
Conference) rolls into town Friday night
before No. 7 Arizona State (44-11, 8-4)
arrives for a pair of games on Saturday
and Sunday. Stanford (30-13, 5-7) lost
both its previous games against the Sun
Devils, as well as its matchup against the
Wildcats while on the road two weeks
ago.
The teams from the Grand Canyon
State boast a frightening array of pitch
ing and offense. Arizona has two players
among the conference's top 10 in batting
average: senior outfielder Caitlin Lowe,
who is hitting .449, and senior middle in
fielder Chelsie Mesa, who bats .363. Al
though Lowe does not hit many doubles,
she gets in scoring position after virtual
ly every hit, courtesy of her 41-for-41
base-stealing record.
The Wildcats' senior shortstop
Kristie Fox is in charge of driving in Ari
zona's talented table-setters. Fox has 12
home runs and 48 RBI on the season and
is tied for fourth in the Pac-10 in both
categories.
Junior right-hander Taryne Mowat is
Arizona's staff ace. She sports a 26-7
record and a 1.62 FRA in 38 games this

season. Mowat has 331 strikeouts this
season â€” the second-most of any Pac
-10 pitcher.
Arizona St;ite counters with a set of
even more explosive players. Sopho
more outfielder Kaitlin Cochran is per
haps the most dangerous hitter in the
conference. She has the top hatting aver
age (.517) in the Pac-10 and has drawn
38 walks to boot. Cochran is also second
in the Pac-10 in doubles and third in
home runs, with 14 two-baggers and 13
homers on the season. Cochran's 4<S RBI
are only enough for second on her own
team, however, as senior third baseman
Bianca Cruz leads the Sun Devils and
the league with b2.

Freshman Shannon Koplitz and the No. 16 Cardinal
will square off against their Pac-10 rivals from the
desert this weekend. Stanford was swept by both
schools on its Arizona road trip two weeks ago.
ASU also has the top pitcher in
the conference. Junior Katie
Burkhart is 24-9 with a 0.98 ERA
and a whopping 358 Ks on the year.
Stanford head coach John
Rittman knows his team needs to
keep mistakes to an absolute mini
mum to defeat the visitors.
"We have to pitch well and play
defense, and we cannot give them
extra outs," Rittman said. "We were
ahead 2-1 against ASU [on Apr. 15],
but we fell apart defensively."
Rittman also identified clutch
hitting as an element that was sorely
lacking when Stanford made its dis
appointing road trip a couple weeks
ago. The Cardinal had several op
portunities to take charge of that
weekend's games, but failed to take
advantage.
"We left the bases loaded twice
against Arizona," Rittman said. "A
timely hit in either one of those in
stances opens up the game."
Freshman center fielder Alissa
Haber will be central to Stanford's
efforts to score against Arizona and
Arizona State. Haber is hitting .543
(25-for-46) with runners on base and
.464 (13-for-28) with runners in
scoring position, both team highs.

Junior third baseman Michelle
Smith and freshman catcher Rosey
Neill lead the club in RBI with 36
and 31, respectively.
Sophomore utility player Maddy
Coon could be called upon to pro
vide some offense as well. Despite
limited at-bats. Coon is third on the
Cardinal squad in RBI (20), and her
11 doubles puts her just behind the
team leader, Haber. Coon is also
second on the team (again behind
Haber) in slugging percentage at
.544.
Sophomore righty Missy Penna,
who is 22-6 with a 2.09 ERA, will be
charged with keeping the Wildcats
and the Sun Devils off the score
board. She will have to curb the
wildness that plagued her in Tues
day's game to succeed this weekend.
Although Penna did not give up an
earned run in Stanford's 5-3 victory
over San Jose State, she hit two bat
ters in a three-run fifth inning for
the Spartans.
Stanford holds a 15-21 all-time
record against Arizona State and a
4-41 record against Arizona. First
pitch is set for 7 p.m. tonight against
the Sun Devils; the games against
the Wildcats start at 1 and 1:30 p.m.
on Saturday and Sunday, respective
ly. All games are at Smith Family
Stadium.
