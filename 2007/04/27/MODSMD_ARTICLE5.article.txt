## DESERT RIVALS COME KNOCKING No. 16 Card hosts No. 4 Arizona, No. 7 ASU 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
ITie No. 16 Stanford women's Softball
team will play a three-game set at home
this weekend, facing the top two teams
in the conference as the Cardinal looks
to avenge a trio of losses earlier this sea
son.
No. 4 Arizona (34-9. 10-2 Pacific-10
Conference) rolls into town Friday night
before No. 7 Arizona State (44-11, 8-4)
arrives for a pair of games on Saturday
and Sunday. Stanford (30-13, 5-7) lost
both its previous games against the Sun
Devils, as well as its matchup against the
Wildcats while on the road two weeks
ago.
The teams from the Grand Canyon
State boast a frightening array of pitch
ing and offense. Arizona has two players
among the conference's top 10 in batting
average: senior outfielder Caitlin Lowe,
who is hitting .449, and senior middle in
fielder Chelsie Mesa, who bats .363. Al
though Lowe does not hit many doubles,
she gets in scoring position after virtual
ly every hit, courtesy of her 41-for-41
base-stealing record.
The Wildcats' senior shortstop
Kristie Fox is in charge of driving in Ari
zona's talented table-setters. Fox has 12
home runs and 48 RBI on the season and
is tied for fourth in the Pac-10 in both
categories.
Junior right-hander Taryne Mowat is
Arizona's staff ace. She sports a 26-7
record and a 1.62 FRA in 38 games this

season. Mowat has 331 strikeouts this
season â€” the second-most of any Pac
-10 pitcher.
Arizona St;ite counters with a set of
even more explosive players. Sopho
more outfielder Kaitlin Cochran is per
haps the most dangerous hitter in the
conference. She has the top hatting aver
age (.517) in the Pac-10 and has drawn
38 walks to boot. Cochran is also second
in the Pac-10 in doubles and third in
home runs, with 14 two-baggers and 13
homers on the season. Cochran's 4<S RBI
are only enough for second on her own
team, however, as senior third baseman
Bianca Cruz leads the Sun Devils and
the league with b2.
