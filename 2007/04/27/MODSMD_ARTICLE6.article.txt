# Alissa Haber
## The 						Freshman Phenom 
### SCOTT BLAND 
IHj he job of offensive catalyst usually falls
| to a savvy veteran on a college ball
club, but not always. Freshman center
fielder Alissa I laber is taking on there-
I sponsibility for the No. 16 Stanford
softball team. And she is emphatically making it
her own.
"I knew that I was coming into a team that's
always competitive," I laber said. "I knew that I
was going to be challenged to become a better
player."
By the look of it.the Newark, Calif.-native
has responded well to that challenge.
ITie No. 2 hitter in the Cardinal's batting
order, I laber is leading Stanford in a host of of
fensive categories. 1 ler .383 batting average is 54
points above the next best, freshman shortstop
Shannon koplitz. and Haber's team-high 12
doubles go a long way toward pushing her slug
ging percentage to the top of the squad's stat
sheet.
I laber's 34 runs scored puts her at the top of
the team. Still more impressive are her 11 runs in
conference play, an astonishing 28 per
cent of the team's total production.
Throw in four home runs (tied for sec
ond on the squad) and you get perhaps
the most dangerous all-around hitter in
the Stanford lineup.
1 laber is still a little surprised by it all;
she wasn't entirely sure that she had
nailed down a spot in the starting lineup
before the season, much less a place at
the top of the batting order.
Head coach John Rittman has taken
1 laber's great success in stride.
"Alissa was very highly recruited, so
we knew we were getting a special play
er when she decided to come to Stan
ford," Rittman said. "We've had a num
ber of great center fielders here, and
she's continuing in that long line."
Such praise is not simply a coach talk
ing about a pri7.ed player. The range of
tools that 1 laber has at her disposal is
staggering.
"She is very strong, she has tremen
dous bat speed and she has a good eye at
the plate." Rittman said. "She hits for
power, she hits for average and she can
utilize the short game â€” slapping and
bunting.That versatility opens holes in a
defense."
I laber's blend of skills has been caus
ing trouble for virtually every team that
Stanford has faced this year. She has al
ready put two double-digit hitting
streaks together, a 1 0-game effort in Feb
ruary and a more recent 11-game streak
that just ended against San Jose State on
Tuesday night. She has gotten a hit in all
but one of the Cardinal's Pac-10 games
and has reached base safely in 15 straight
contests.
That discerning eye in the batter's
box is something that the center fielder
has worked hard to improve over the
past few months, and it is paying divi
dends. Haber gets on base in nearly half
of her plate appearances and is one of
only two Cardinal players with more
walks than strikeouts. I laber thinks that

her time in the leadoff spot during Stan
ford's non-conference schedule helped
significantly in that regard.
" Leading off games, you try to take as
many pitches as possible and work the
count." Haber said. "At the beginning. 1
was being very aggressive. As I became
more and more comfortable. I started
taking more pitches and 1 brought that
with me to the second spot [in the
order)."
Haber's offensive accomplishments
are impressive enough in a vacuum, but
when one considers that she is also deal
ing with the difficulties of learning a new
position, 1 laber's phenomenal freshman
year takes on a new light.
"I played first base for most of my ca
reer," Haber said. "When 1 came here I
really had no formal training as an out
fielder. so the beginning was definitely
nerve-wracking."
Rittman and Haber agree that she is
making progress, but Haber herself says
that she is nowhere near the level she
wants to reach. One area that she is par
ticularly focused on mastering is the role
of the center fielder as the outfield gener
al.
"Center fielders are supposed to di
rect everything that's going on," Haber
said. "As a freshman, you don't always
have that authority, but I'm working on
being more authoritative."
And in a testament to her work ethic,
that is far from the only thing that Haber
is trying to improve. Despite her all-con
ference numbers and long hitting
streaks, she is still not satisfied with her
consistency so she wants to develop her
power even further. Her ability to recov
er quickly from slip-ups. whether in the
batter's box or the field, makes Haber es
pecially dangerous. She says remembers
her mistakes in order to learn from them,
not to dwell on them.
