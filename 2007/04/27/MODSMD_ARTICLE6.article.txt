## The
						Freshman Phenom 
### SCOTT BLAND 
IHj he job of offensive catalyst usually falls

club, but not always. Freshman center
fielder Alissa I laber is taking on there-
I sponsibility for the No. 16 Stanford
softball team. And she is emphatically making it
her own.
"I knew that I was coming into a team that's
always competitive," I laber said. "I knew that I
was going to be challenged to become a better
player."
By the look of it.the Newark, Calif.-native
has responded well to that challenge.
ITie No. 2 hitter in the Cardinal's batting
order, I laber is leading Stanford in a host of of
fensive categories. 1 ler .383 batting average is 54
points above the next best, freshman shortstop
Shannon koplitz. and Haber's team-high 12
doubles go a long way toward pushing her slug
ging percentage to the top of the squad's stat
sheet.
I laber's 34 runs scored puts her at the top of
the team. Still more impressive are her 11 runs in
