For the first time in two years, the

second session, finishing second to
Utah, with a team score of 197.2.
Freshman Carly Janiga placed
third in the all-around with a 39.5,
while junior Tabitha Yini placed
fourth with a 39.45.
Event highlights included Janiga's
9.9 first-place finish on the floor ex
ercise and junior LizTricase's third
place vault performance, scoring an
excellent 9.95. A solid 9.9 earned
sophomore Kelly Fee a third-place
finish on the balance beam.
The Cardinal has not been pres
ent as a team for the "Super Six"
since the 2004 season. The squad is
especially prepared for this year's
competition with its many talented
gymnasts on each event.
"With our depth, we are able to
compete well on that second day,"
head coach Kristen Smyth said earli
er this week. "It gives some flexibili
ty to the line up."
Stanford swings into tonight's
"Super Six" competition hoping to
bring home its first NCAA title.The
Cardinal will be challenged for it by
Georgia, Florida, Nebraska. UCLA
and Utah.
