## Jordan Hall Café 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION PEANUT SAUCE 
Anybody who has ever taken a
class around lunchtime in the Psy
chology Building, 420 (which should
he a good portion of the student
body seeing as I have had everything
from actual Psych lectures to I HUM
lectures to CS lectures in that build
ing). knows that starting at 11:30, a
line of seemingly intimidating length
stretches out of the door of the build
ing's basement.This line is, of course,
for the Jordan Hall Thai Cafe. If you
were unaware that a secret restau
rant was located in the basement of
the Psych Building, then judging by
the length of the line, you might think
that something was being given away
for free. While the food at the Thai
Cafe is not in fact free, a $5.(X) flat
rate for every dish offered there is a
pretty reasonable price. Additional
ly, the food is surprisingly good (and
I say surprisingly only because food
from a restaurant that has no visible
kitchen, but rather appears out of a
room in the Psych Building might
seem suspect to some until they have
tried it).
The beauty of the Thai Cafe lies in
two things:
1)lts simplicity. Again, all dishes
cost $5.00 (drinks are also available
and range in price from $.75 to
$1.25), and your biggest decision will
be choosing between soup (shrimp,
BBQ pork. BBQ chicken) and salad
(peanut sauce, shrimp. BBQ pork.
BBQ chicken, vegetarian — all are
noodle based). There are also spe
cials available (conveniently priced
at $5.00): when 1 ate there this past
Friday these included either a Chick
en or Vegetarian Saute (these were
over rice instead of noodles).
2)lts efficiency. While 1 stated
above that the line is so long that it
can appear intimidating, those who
have eaten at the Thai Cafe know
that the line actually moves very
quickly. Far more intimidating than
the length of the line is actually the
lady that operates the register at the
front of it.The line moves quickly for
a reason. Thai Lady (as some call
her) has managed to earn herself the
reputation as Stanford's Soup Nazi
equivalent. Much like there were
rules to order soup from the Soup
Nazi, there are rules at the Thai Cafe.
You're expected to have your money
ready (cash only) and know what
you want to order when you reach
the front of the line. 1 lere is how the
interaction occurs: You say what you
want, hand over the money. Thai
Lady yells out your order (in her
sweet but assertive sounding voice).

and then a man brings the food out
from what can only he described as a
magical room. The room is magical
because food is produced from it in
about 5 seconds. No joke. Merely sec
onds after the last syllable of your
order rolls off of Thai Lady's tongue,
the man will bring it out. It is a truly
impressive operation.
1 sampled two dishes at the Thai
Cafe this past Friday — the Shrimp
Noodle Salad and one of the specials,
the Chicken Saute. Of the two. 1 pre
ferred the Shrimp Noodle Salad,
though both were good. The salad
was served at room temperature. Be
sides the noodles (which were egg
noodles...a little thicker than your
average linguini) and the shrimp (of
which there were 5 pieces — 1 hate it
when something is classified as a
shrimp dish and then has 2 pieces of
shrimp in it — so this was a positive),
the salad contained peanuts and scai
lions — or green onions as some call
them. It was served over lettuce and
the sauce was "sweet and spicy". As
someone who doesn't like things too
spicy, I'd say that the degree of spici
ness was very non-threatening.
The other dish 1 sampled was the
Chicken Saute. Again, while both
dishes were good. 1 liked this one less
for several reasons. The saute was
definitely considerably spicier (a lit
tle too much so for me, though in the
spectrum of spiciness it probably
wasn't that terrible). Also, it just
looked less appetizing. The shrimp
noodle salad had the bright colors of
the pink shrimp, the green onions
and the red chilies from the sauce,
whereas the saute pretty much just
looked brown (from the sauce and
also just from the way cooked veg
etables sometimes are j. Perhaps I am
the only strange person that judges
food by some kind of a "prettiness
factor", but the saute just looked de
cidedly less appetizing to me. Grant
ed though, it tasted fine (as long as
you are ok with spice). Portion sizes
of all dishes are pretty generous.
While I didn't have a chance to sam
ple any of the soups, I have heard
good things about them.
