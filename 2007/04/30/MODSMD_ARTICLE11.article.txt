# Excursions
## An out-of-bubble experience 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION CITY SLICKER 
Walking down 21st Street toward the cam
pus center (the Mall) of UT Austin. I'm struck
by how fundamentally separate the "Texas"
and "Stanford" experiences are. My "younger"
sister deals with things in Austin that I've never
had to confront at Stanford, of which the most
obvious is a two-step card swipe to get into her
dorm (security filters). She's in the middle of
Texas's capital metropolis, and I'm nesting in
one of America's safest (and arguably cushiest)
suburbs. Our weekend activities — or options
— are equally different.
My sister Laura Anne lives life a little differ
ently I rom me. that is. First, Stanford's relative
isolation is conducive to "closed-campus-but
inclusive" activities. There are two guarantees
on a Friday night at Stanford: 1) there is some
thing "happening" on campus and 2) you can
participate. While University of Texas surely
has weekend parties, the social circles are
somewhat more select. In other words, you
don't have an open invitation to every fraterni
ty and sorority house on the UTexas campus.
With an undergraduate population bordering
on 5(),00() students, I understand the need to fil
ter — but the idea that some parties might not
be safe to attend (my impression) unnerved me.
Second, Stanford's relative isolation hinders
genuine community perforation. Sure, we launch
a Friday night exodus to University Avenue, but
the storefronts and social climate in downtown
Palo Alto have the authenticity of a movie set. In
Austin, you can expect to slip out of your student
identity and into an amorphous conglomerate
whenever you desire. Unless you're wearing
Nike shorts and a Texas T-shirt (the conspicuous
markers, my sister tells me. of a UTexas female),
you'll blend. For a wearied Stanford student (I
feel so full-time. I'm over-time), the concept of
blending entices. And if UTexas students and
Austin locals can merge without obvious distinc
tions on a Friday night, what's to keep a wayfar
ing Stanford student from joining the fusion? I
decided I wanted sample one Friday night as my
little sister experiences it.
We began the evening with a short drive off

campus ("campus" is so well integrated into the
greater city of Austin that I can't identify the
borderline) to a brightly lit. crowded Mexican
restaurant in Barton Springs. Chuys,catering to
Austin's official slogan — "Keep Austin
Weird" — thrives on the rare intersection of
sock hop and salsa, serving hearty helpings of
Americanized classic Mexican food. When we
arrived. I pulled aside the waiter. a Vin Diesel
look-alike with a Texan accent. "It's my sister's
birthday." I said. He shrugged. "Okay?" He
served us our burritos, gave us our checks, and
essentially flushed us out of the restaurant.
When the waitlist is half an hour long, there's
no time for birthdays. Ah. urban bustle.
Besides being one of several Texas locations
for Chuys. Barton Springs is also the home of a
sprawling suburban-style mall. UTexas stu
dents apparently appreciate local shopping as
much as their Stanford counterparts. Before we
draw a complete parallel, however, let me em
phasize the iivability of Barton Springs Mall. If
Stanford Shopping Center is a silk-upholstered
chaise lounge. Barton Springs is your
boyfriend's microfiber couch. Barton Springs
has price tags that don't make grown-ups cry.
miscreant youth loitering at exits and a movie
theater. (We ended up seeing "The Invisible",
but I'd rather not talk about it.)
Finally, after a brief drive along Red River,
we washed up at Spider House, a deceptively
named live-music bar. The sweltering heat of
Austin afternoon had mellowed to the sigh of
dusk, and we filed through densely packed
patio tables to four of the few vacant chairs. If
you've ever wondered if there truly is a place in
this country where twenty-somethings listen to
hard rock music ("that drummer looks like
Ryan from the OC." Laura Anne says, "if he
were collecting social security") and scribble
furtively on napkins, there is — Spider House
in Austin.Texas.
"Isn't it cute?" Laura Anne said, her face il
luminated by the glow of the flashing "BAR"
sign. While "cute" wasn't a word that had even
entered my consciousness, there was nonethe
less something charming about this place. The
place was so loud, we couldn't hear one anoth
er from across the table. Laura Anne and I had

to maintain our "argument voices" for the en
tirety of the night, but we managed a few suc
cessful exchanges. Ilie waitress had trouble
hearing us. too. Laura Anne asked for a latte.
and she leaned in so close her lip piercing was
almost grazing my little sister's forehead. "Do
you want any milk in that?" she asked. Laura
Anne looked rightfully puzzled.
I University of Texas tells its students, "What
starts here changes the world." which may be
true. My weekend in Austin certainly generated
some preliminary thoughts (and doubts) about
the urban lifestyle. I imagine the lives many of us
transition to post-graduation will be like the life
my little sister leads now. whether in Austin or
New York or San Francisco. For me. it's pleasant
to contemplate the cultural access 7(X).(XK) peo
ple congealed in 3(K) square miles not only al
lows. but uniquely produces. In fact, after three
days in Austin, I've become a bit of a fan. With
the right career incentives after Stanford, I
could easily sign on to Austin's brand of down
town life. I just hope the peeling paint on the
bathroom fixtures isn't a part of the package.
