## Rental truck filled with rotting fish 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
I UCSON, Ariz. â€” A putrid
prank went awry when authorities
found a rental truck filled with rot
ting fish, cow parts and pig organs
and evacuated residents of a Tucson
neighborhood, police said.
Four University of Arizona stu
dents had rented the truck and col
lected the smelly cargo intending to
dump it on someone's front lawn as a
prank, said Sgt. Mark Robinson, a
Tucson Police Department
spokesman.
Neighbors disgusted by the foul
odor emanating from the vehicle
called police Thursday and officers
found the truck packed with 10 city
trash cans. Robinson said. They also
found ammonia and bleach, which
prompted authorities to evacuate a
square block and call in a hazardous
materials team.
After testing the air and finding
oxygen levels were fine, police offi
cers moved in and discovered the de
composing contents in the trash cans.
TTie four students returned to the
scene during the police search and
confessed to renting the truck and

filling it up, Robinson said. The stu
dents were released after question
ing, but may later face charges, in
cluding theft of the trash cans, crimi
nal damage and disturbing the
peace.
