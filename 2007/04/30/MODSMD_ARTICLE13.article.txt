AN KEN Y. lowa — Several class
rooms at Des Moines Area Commu
nity College were evacuated after
college officials became nervous
about a suspicious package.
College officials called police and
postal inspectors after the box was
delivered Thursday. What they found
inside wasn't a bomb — it was a box
containing 500 condoms.
The package was sent to a teacher
of a human sexuality class, and was
sent by a person who had been a pre
vious speaker at the class, said Rob
Denson. the college's president.
