## Fiery blaze destroys I-80 ramp Traffic gridlock projected for weeks, state of emergency declared 
### MARCUS WOHLSEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
OAKLAND. Calif. — A pair of freeway inter
changes that skirt the east side of the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge were shut down Sunday after
flames from an overturned gasoline truck caused part
ot one overpass to collapse on the other, officials said.
Authorities said the accident on a maze of highway
ramps that provide access to the Bay Bridge and sev
eral other key freeways would cause the worst disrup
tion for Bay Area commuters since the 198 1 ) Loma
Prieta earthquake damaged the bridge itself.
State transportation officials said it could take
months to repair the damaged interchanges, and ad
vised motorists to use public transportation into and
out of San Francisco. They said that drivers who chose
to take alternate routes on Monday would face night
marish commutes.
"People are going to have to find a different way to
work and back home in the evening so we are asking
them to plan ahead and do their homework." said Jeff
Weiss, a spokesman for the California Department of
Transportation. "This isn't going to be fixed in a mat
ter of days."
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued an emergency
declaration Sunday in an effort to hasten cleanup and
rebuilding efforts. "This declaration will streamline
public contracting and environmental codes and pro
vide emergency funding to allow repair operations to
begin immediately" the governor said in a statement.
Schwarzenegger also authorized funding for free
public transit on Monday.
Although heat from the fire was intense enough to
weaken the freeway and cause the collapse that dam
aged a stretch hundreds of yards long, the truck's driv
er walked away from the scene to nearby gas station.
Officer Trent Cross of the California Highway Patrol
said.
Hie driver, James Mosqueda. 51, of Woodland,
called a taxi that took him to a nearby hospital with
second-degree burns. Cross said. No other injuries
were reported, and officials said a major public safety
disaster only was averted because the crash happened
so early on a Sunday.
"I 've never seen anything like it." Cross said of the
stretch of crumpled interchange that was twisted into
a mass of steel and concrete hundreds of feet long.
"I'm looking at this thinking. 'Wow. no one died —
that's amazing. It's just very fortunate."
Hie crash occurred around 3:45 a.m. on the
Mac Arthur Maze, a collection of interchanges on the
edge of downtown Oakland about a half-mile from
the Bay Bridge toll plaza. Although the bridge itself
was not damaged, the labyrinth of thrcv converging
freeways delivers traffic to and from San Francisco
and includes some of the Bay Area's most congested
routes.
State transportation officials said that while only
about 80.000 cars pass through the damaged inter
changes each day, the ripple effect could inconven
ience hundreds of thousands of motorists as drivers
are forced to find ways around the closed routes.
About 280.000 commuters take the Bay Bridge into
and out of San Francisco each day.
" Ibis will be one of the most problematic com
mutes in recent memory," San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom, speaking to reporters at the California De
mocratic Party convention in San Diego.
The tanker carrying 8,600 gallons of gasoline ignit
ed after crashing into a guardrail on the interchange

connecting westbound lanes of Interstate 80 to south
bound Interstate 880. A preliminary investigation in
dicates Mosqueda may have been speeding as he nav
igated the curving road, but neither alcohol nor drugs
appeared to be a factor in the crash. Cross said.
Mosqueda had a valid license and no history of
driving under the influence. Cross said. Mosqueda was
headed troni a refinery in Benicia to a gas station near
the Oakland Airport when the accident occurred, ac
cording to the CUP.
Heat from the flames exceeded 2,750 degrees and
caused the steel beams holding up the interchange
from eastbound 1-80 to eastbound Interstate 580
above to buckle and bolts holding the structure to
gether to melt, leading to the collapse. California De
partment of Transportation director Will Kempton
said.
Officials said that altogether a 250-yard portion of
the upper roadway was damaged. The cost of the re
pairs would likely run into the tens of millions of dol
lars. and the agency was seeking federal disaster aid.
Kempton said.
Witnesses reported flames from the blaze rose up
to 200 feet into the air. The charred section of col
lapsed freeway was draped at a sharp angle onto the
highway beneath, exposing a web of twisted metal be
neath the concrete.
Newsom said the crash appeared to be an accident
and that there was no evidence of foul play.
He said he had spoken to Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's administration and said he was as
sured the state would fast-track repairs, much as it did
after the IW4 Northridge earthquake. He did not
speculate about how long it might take to replace the
span but predicted massive disruption to San Francis
co Bay area traffic.
Aides were still working out details, but the decla
ration will make it easier for the state Department of
Transportation to issue contracts and avoid certain
environmental reviews.
"It allows these repairs to happen much quicker,"
said Adam Mendelsohn, the governor's communica
tions director.
Schwarzenegger announced he will survey the
scene this evening.
1 laving portions of a main artery severed brought
uncomfortably familiar images to the Bay Area. Dur
ing the 1989 earthquake,both the Bay Bridge and sec
tion of Interstate 880 near the site of Sunday's col
lapse fell and crushed rush-hour motorists, leaving 40
people dead.

OAKLAND. Calif. — A pair of freeway inter
changes that skirt the east side of the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge were shut down Sunday after
flames from an overturned gasoline truck caused part
ot one overpass to collapse on the other, officials said.
Authorities said the accident on a maze of highway
ramps that provide access to the Bay Bridge and sev
eral other key freeways would cause the worst disrup
tion for Bay Area commuters since the 198 1 ) Loma
Prieta earthquake damaged the bridge itself.
State transportation officials said it could take
months to repair the damaged interchanges, and ad
vised motorists to use public transportation into and
out of San Francisco. They said that drivers who chose
to take alternate routes on Monday would face night
marish commutes.
"People are going to have to find a different way to
work and back home in the evening so we are asking
them to plan ahead and do their homework." said Jeff
Weiss, a spokesman for the California Department of
Transportation. "This isn't going to be fixed in a mat
ter of days."
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued an emergency
declaration Sunday in an effort to hasten cleanup and
rebuilding efforts. "This declaration will streamline
public contracting and environmental codes and pro
vide emergency funding to allow repair operations to
begin immediately" the governor said in a statement.
Schwarzenegger also authorized funding for free
public transit on Monday.
Although heat from the fire was intense enough to
weaken the freeway and cause the collapse that dam
aged a stretch hundreds of yards long, the truck's driv
er walked away from the scene to nearby gas station.
Officer Trent Cross of the California Highway Patrol
said.
Hie driver, James Mosqueda. 51, of Woodland,
called a taxi that took him to a nearby hospital with
second-degree burns. Cross said. No other injuries
were reported, and officials said a major public safety
disaster only was averted because the crash happened
so early on a Sunday.
"I 've never seen anything like it." Cross said of the
stretch of crumpled interchange that was twisted into
a mass of steel and concrete hundreds of feet long.
"I'm looking at this thinking. 'Wow. no one died —
that's amazing. It's just very fortunate."
Hie crash occurred around 3:45 a.m. on the
Mac Arthur Maze, a collection of interchanges on the
edge of downtown Oakland about a half-mile from
the Bay Bridge toll plaza. Although the bridge itself
was not damaged, the labyrinth of thrcv converging
freeways delivers traffic to and from San Francisco
and includes some of the Bay Area's most congested
routes.
State transportation officials said that while only
about 80.000 cars pass through the damaged inter
changes each day, the ripple effect could inconven
ience hundreds of thousands of motorists as drivers
are forced to find ways around the closed routes.
About 280.000 commuters take the Bay Bridge into
and out of San Francisco each day.
" Ibis will be one of the most problematic com
mutes in recent memory," San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom, speaking to reporters at the California De
mocratic Party convention in San Diego.
The tanker carrying 8,600 gallons of gasoline ignit
ed after crashing into a guardrail on the interchange

connecting westbound lanes of Interstate 80 to south
bound Interstate 880. A preliminary investigation in
dicates Mosqueda may have been speeding as he nav
igated the curving road, but neither alcohol nor drugs
appeared to be a factor in the crash. Cross said.
Mosqueda had a valid license and no history of
driving under the influence. Cross said. Mosqueda was
headed troni a refinery in Benicia to a gas station near
the Oakland Airport when the accident occurred, ac
cording to the CUP.
Heat from the flames exceeded 2,750 degrees and
caused the steel beams holding up the interchange
from eastbound 1-80 to eastbound Interstate 580
above to buckle and bolts holding the structure to
gether to melt, leading to the collapse. California De
partment of Transportation director Will Kempton
said.
Officials said that altogether a 250-yard portion of
the upper roadway was damaged. The cost of the re
pairs would likely run into the tens of millions of dol
lars. and the agency was seeking federal disaster aid.
Kempton said.
Witnesses reported flames from the blaze rose up
to 200 feet into the air. The charred section of col
lapsed freeway was draped at a sharp angle onto the
highway beneath, exposing a web of twisted metal be
neath the concrete.
Newsom said the crash appeared to be an accident
and that there was no evidence of foul play.
He said he had spoken to Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's administration and said he was as
sured the state would fast-track repairs, much as it did
after the IW4 Northridge earthquake. He did not
speculate about how long it might take to replace the
span but predicted massive disruption to San Francis
co Bay area traffic.
Aides were still working out details, but the decla
ration will make it easier for the state Department of
Transportation to issue contracts and avoid certain
environmental reviews.
"It allows these repairs to happen much quicker,"
said Adam Mendelsohn, the governor's communica
tions director.
Schwarzenegger announced he will survey the
scene this evening.
1 laving portions of a main artery severed brought
uncomfortably familiar images to the Bay Area. Dur
ing the 1989 earthquake,both the Bay Bridge and sec
tion of Interstate 880 near the site of Sunday's col
lapse fell and crushed rush-hour motorists, leaving 40
people dead.
Newsom said Sunday's fiery crash showed how
vulnerable the Bay area's transportation network is.
