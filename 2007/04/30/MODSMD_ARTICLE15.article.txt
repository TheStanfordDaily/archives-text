## Editorial Board Kudos for Row composting 
### 
The extension to the Row of a pilot
composting program represents yet
another sensible step in the Universi
ty's efforts to promote sustainability on
campus. Coming on the heels of a sustain
able energy conference and the conversion
to biodegradable serviceware at selected
campus dining destinations, the new initia
tive caps a banner year for environmental
ism at Stanford.
Iliis latest expansion aims to translate
the success of composting programs in Stan
ford Dining halls to the 35 row residences,
which collectively house some 1.600 stu
dents. Under the auspices of the "Zero
Waste" initiative, compostable food waste
and organic material are collected by hash
ers and kitchen manager-trained students,
and deposited in specially marked organic
dumpsters around the row. Peninsula Sani
tary Services. Inc. (PSSI). a recycling and re
fuse collection company under contract
with the University, then transports materi
als to an off-site composting facility in San
Jose. Hie decomposed matter is later re
turned to Stanford for use in landscaping.
The row composting initiative is a collab
orative effort between Student Housing,
Residential Education, Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford. Student Organized Ser

vices (SOS), and PSSI. In part because suc
cessful models of composting have been in
place at Stanford Dining facilities and other
campus eateries since as early as 2003, row
composting to date has been largely suc
cessful. SOS has sought to train kitchen
managers, chefs, hashers, and students on a
continuing basis, with the expectation of full
participation by the end of spring quarter.
Composting has many worthy benefits. If
done properly, composting adds biodiversi
ty to soil structures, minimizes Stanford's
contributions to local landfill, and reduces
food waste. According to SOS. food waste
constitutes 16 percent of solid waste at Stan
ford. It all compostable and recyclable ma
terials were collected.says SOS. the Univer
sity might boast a landfill diversion rate as
high as 70 percent. What is more, the com
posting program allows many students who
might not otherwise take notice to learn
about composting and its benefits.
In combination with other green initia
tives undertaken by the University in recent
years, composting represents a meaningful
effort to cut down on avoidable waste and
positively impact the environment â€” par
ticularly at the local level. We support the
expansion of composting to the Row. and
encourage residents to participate.
