# A
						tale of two teams
## 
### 
I t's April, folks, and that means one thing:
Play ball! That's right,baseball season is
now in full swing, and while 3000 long,
largely unimportant miles separate me
from my beloved Fenway Park, the wonders
of the internet (a.k.a. MLB.TV) have
helped me stave off withdrawal symptoms
and keep me on top of all the action. In
short: Without baseball, 1 would go nuts.
But I sense that many readers are with
out a proper, enlightened appreciation for
the great game of baseball. I want to con
vince you that baseball isn't merely about,
well, baseball. It's about life. So Ill let you in
on a very important, very simple rule — a
maxim of sorts, a precept around which a
morally principled life may... nay, ought to
be centered. 11 ere goes.
There are two types of people in the
world: Red Sox fans and Yankees fans. And
that's really the whole of it.
See. the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry is not
only the greatest in professional sports, or
sports at any level for that matter, but it
teaches us valuable lessons about ethics,
morality, the meaning of life, and all that
good stuff. Hie Sox-Yankees rivalry teaches
us that moral relativism is a worthless doc
trine, because quite frankly, I am darn sure
of at least two foundational, absolute truths
by which our universe holds itself together:
Absolute Truth #l:The Red Sox repre
sent all that is good and pure in this world.
Absolute Truth #2: The Yankees and
Satan are one and the same.
Being part of the rivalry, as I have been
for twenty years, is a rollercoaster ride of
emotional ups and downs, but I couldn't
imagine life without it. And even if you
weren't born and raised in the pastoral set
ting of New Fngland (minus the avaricious,
Yankee-infested wasteland of Southwest
ern C onnecticut ),you can still have a ball of
a time rooting for the good guys. That's be
cause the Yankees so obviously SUC K. and
you shouldn't have any sympathy for a
tyrannical club that has rained terror on the
sport of baseball for a century.
Still, as an outsider, if you can't see your
self appreciating the life-affirming nature of
the rivalry, think about it this way. You all
like Stanford sports, right? If you don't,
then get out of my face. The rest of you
should recall the performance of Stanford
football this past fall.They stank something
awful. 1-11. Pretend you go to school at
Michigan, say. Ciiven the choice between
rooting for the 1-11 Cardinal, those lovable
underdogs, or the Kal Bears, who have been
a force in the Pac-10 ever since Cal lost its
hippie and became a mind-numbingly
mainstream state school, where would you
place your allegiances?
The answer is obviouslv STANFORD,

and if you choose Cal then you're basically
a lousy, cheerless cad too mentally weak to
grit it out during a losing spell. In other
words, you're an impatient Yankees fan.
Does the number 86 mean anything to you?
That's how many years the city of Boston
waited in between championships. If you
don't have the heart or the mental tough
ness to root for the hapless underdog be
cause you can't stand losing, then you
should find yourself a dismal seat in the
upper deck ot Yankee stadium and look
smug. And. as a result, like an idiot.
I realize that it is bad practice to judge
people. But I judge Yankee fans. If you are
walking down the street wearing a Yankee
cap. I will judge you. It the cap happens to
be pink, my stomach will curdle in disgust. If
the cap is fresh and you have not removed
the sticker. I will laugh at your sheeplike
trend-whoring. If you are proudly repre
senting the Boston B. I will give you an en
couraging smile, or nod approvingly. If you
are sporting one of the classic T-shirts sold
outside Fenway Park, on which amusing
statements like "Jeter Sucks A-Rod",
"Posada is a Little Bitch",or "Varitek is my
Drinking Buddy" are cheaply printed. I
might even hi-five you. Unless you arc vio
lently drunk, in which case I'll let you go
berserk on the luckless chap behind me
wearing the wrong cap.
But the purpose of my column isn't to
convince those of you who don't fall under
the heading of Class-A Moron to start fa
natically watching games. No. there is
something much greater at stake here, so
heed my words! Recall my first guiding
principle, and decide which type of fan
YOU are. If you have even the tiniest sem
blance of mental toughness, honor, and
self-respect — please join the proud ranks
of Red Sox Nation. If you fancy yourself a
profligate, heartless, unthinking sheep, buy
yourself a one-way ticket on the Bronx
bound #4 and stay out of my way. Yankees
fans, you live sad. immoral lives. You need
to change that. This is my Categorical Im
perative.

Alex is chortling with laughter at the sorry
state of the New York Yankees and their over
grown baby choke artist. A-Rod. Peel him
away from the TV at acoleytWp stanford.edu.
