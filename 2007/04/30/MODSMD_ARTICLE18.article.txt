# A 						lesson from our engineer friends
## 
### 
Although in the States, there's much
buzz around the democratic primar
ies. the presidential elections aren't
until next year. At Stanford, ASSU elections
have come and gone. But France is smack
dab in the middle of election season.
The first tour of the presidential elections,
where 12 candidates were narrowed down to
two. was last weekend. And now. Nicolas
Sarkozy — the right-leaning frontrunner
(who happens to be friends with my host
family. 1 use the term "friends" loosely) —
and Segolene Royal — a socialist and the
first woman to make it to the second tour —
are battling it out head-to-head until the mo
ment of truth on May 6.
But Sarkozy and Royal aren't the only
ones vying for control. Last week also marked
the start of the slightly less publicized,slightly
less important, but equally exciting ISEP stu
dent bureau elections. ISEP is the Institut Su
perieur d'Electronique de Paris and home to
the Stanford Center (which is, unfortunately,
located on the sixth floor with an elevator
that's reserved for faculty).
But these crazy engineers don't run their
elections like the rest of us. Instead of just
putting up banners and handing out tliers.
they divvied up the ISEP building and each
group of candidates transformed their sec
tion into a magical, campaign world.
The second floor — headquarters of the
"Cap'On" party (a clever word-play on A 1
Capone's name) — looked like a scene from
The Untouchables. The hallway was paved
with a red carpet made out of felt. Black cir
cle's containing gold outlines of A 1 Capone's
face were spaced out evenly along the floor.
The walls were covered with white lace and
three plastic kegs stood in the corner. One
was turned onto its side in a very prohibition
style manner. The lounge area had been
turned into a casino with a few tables set up
for blackjack and an odd contraption that
may or may not have been a miniature,
home-made shooting range. Black and white
pictures of engineers dressed as gangsters
and flappers lined the walls.
The opposing party — Accroc (I have no
idea what that stands for) — set up their
headquarters on the fourth floor. But. prob
ably due to the completely incomprehensi
ble nature of their party name and a notice
able lack of theme, the decorations lacked
the unity and coherence of Cap'On's prohi
bition-style digs. Instead of a red carpet, the
hallway was a felt, asphalt road with orange

cones lining the sides. Paper palm trees and
flowers were glued to the walls and pictures
of really fierce tigers inexplicably hung from
the ceiling.
Of course, the campaigns didn't stop at
elaborate decorations. While most politi
cians try to win over voters by vague and usu
ally unrealistic promises of "change" and
"improvement," the ISEP kids take the
much simpler approach of free food. All
week, the two groups crowded the building's
entry way, wearing matching shirts (Cap'On
wore red, Accroc wore black) and giving out
free candy bars, popcorn, sodas and, my all
time favorite, cotton candy. Accroc managed
to compensate for their lack of theme and
one-up Cap'On by giving out free leis as well.
Plus, each group had to throw a killer

party to show the student body their mad
event-organization skills. But these parties
weren't just in some dorm, or frat house or
even in the ISEP building. No, these crazy
politicians rented out clubs and, even though
each party had a 15-euro cover charge, man
aged to work out a deal for one-euro soft-al
coholic drinks and two-euro hard-alcoholic
drinks.
And while 1 have no idea what either
group plans to do to improve student rela
tions with ISEP's administrators, or how
many late-night eateries they hope to open
or even if increasing faculty diversity is on
their agenda, I'm confident that both are
committed (after all. it's not easy to redeco
rate an entire floor and make matching t
shirts), creative (Cap'On instead of Capone,
that requires innate artistic ability) and will
do exactly what they promised to do and the
only thing they, or any other student govern
ment. can do — throw awesome social
events and maybe occasionally give out
some free cotton candy.

If Vicky could vote, slw'd vote for Cup'On —
Al Capone beats tigers any day of the week
