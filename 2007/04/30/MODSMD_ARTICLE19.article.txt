## Study questions black diversity 
### CARA ANNA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK — Something in
the crowd made Shirley Wilcher
wonder. As a college graduate in
the early 19705, her black class
mates were like herself — born in
the United States, to American
parents. But at an alumni reunion
at Mount Holyoke College last
year, she saw something different
and asked for admissions data to
prove it.
"My suspicions were con
firmed," said Wilcher, now the ex
ecutive director of the American
Association for Affirmative Ac
tion. She found a rise in the num
ber of black students from Africa
and the Caribbean, and a down
turn in admissions of native
blacks like her.
A study released this year put
numbers on the trend. Among
students at 28 top U.S. universi
ties. the representation of black
students of first- and second-gen
eration immigrant origin (27 per
cent) was about twice their repre
sentation in the national popula
tion of blacks their age (13 per
cent). Within the Ivy League, im
migrant-origin students made up
41 percent of black freshmen.
Wilcher would like to know
why She asks if her cause has lost
its way on U.S. campuses, with the
goal of correcting American
racial injustices replaced by a
softer ideal of diversity — as if
any black student will do.
The study, published in the
American Journal of Education,
found no definitive answer as to
why the change is happening.
However,"folks I know personal
ly who have worked in admissions
have told me that they weren't
surprised," said Camille Charles,
a University of Pennsylvania pro
fessor who wrote the study with
three Princeton University pro
fessors.
The researchers looked at data
from a national survey of 1.028
freshmen at 28 top colleges and
universities in 1999. The eight
year-old material was used be
cause it was specially designed to
help find reasons for under
achievement by minorities at col
leges and universities.
In terms of student back
ground. it found few differences,
noting only that far more black
immigrant students had fathers
with college or advanced degrees
than did other black students.
But the authors suggested that
the reason for high proportion of
immigrant students may lie in
how the students are perceived.
"To white observers, black im
migrants seem more polite, less
hostile, more solicitous, and 'easi
er to get along with. " the study
said. "Native blacks are perceived

in precisely the opposite fashion."
That idea immediately found
detractors.
"I can't speak for white peo
ple. but that's crazy," said Adoma
Adjei-Brenyah, a Columbia Uni
versity student with college-edu
cated parents from Ghana.
The director of public policy
for the National Association for
College Admission Counseling
agreed. "1 reject the notion that
admissions officers are somehow
deliberately doing this," David
Hawkins said.
One legal expert explained the
bump in black immigrants by say
ing that now. decades since the
civil rights movement's peak, col
lege diversity is aimed less at cor
recting American racial injustices
and more at creating a variety of
perspectives on campus.
Besides, "how many colleges
and universities are looking to
stand up and say, Tm continuing
not to cure the problems of the
past?'" said Arthur Coleman, a
lawyer who co-wrote "Admis
sions and Diversity After Michi
gan: The Next Generation of
Legal and Policy Issues."
Students agreed the subject of
native vs. immigrant background
remains sensitive.
Last month, a Harvard Black
Students Association message
board asked, "When we use the
term 'black community," who is in
cludedinthisdescription?"Alively
debate ensued, with some posters
complaining that African students
were getting an admissions boost
without having faced the historical
sufferingofU.S.blacks.
Jason Lee, the Harvard
group's president, echoed anoth
er thought in the discussion.
"There's a historical sense that
black Americans are disrespected
by immigrants," he said. "Parents
don't want their kids to play with
them, don't want bad habits rub
bing off on them. There's a bit of
tension there."
But Adjei-Brenyah. the presi
dent of the African Students As
sociation at Columbia, argued
that drawing an admissions dis
tinction based on suffering under
slavery is false."lf you're going to
make a slavery case, people from
the Caribbean were also dis
placed and enslaved. How do you
begin to differentiate?" he said.
The issue of native vs. immi
grant blacks took hold at I larvard
in 2004. when professors Henry
Louis Gates and Lani Guinier
pointed out at a black alumni re
union that a majority of attendees
were of African or Caribbean ori
gin. Gates and Guinier cited de
mographic information in the
"Black Guide to Life at Har
vard." a survey of 70 percent of
black undergraduates published
by the BSA.
