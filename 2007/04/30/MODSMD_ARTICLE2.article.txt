## Students duped by bike prank Police deny posting notices fraught with typos, lies 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students who found warnings on their
bicycles Friday morning that police would
aggressively step up bike law enforce
ment seem to have been the victims of a

prank. The no
tices purported
to come from
the Stanford
University De
partment of
Public Safety
(DPS), but po
lice officials de
nied issuing any
such warnings.
The colorful
notices, hun
dreds of which
littered campus
Friday morning,
claimed that
new rules and
regulations
would be com
ing into effect
as of Apr. 27.
The notice
stated, "because
of an increase in
recent bicycle
accidents, Stan-

...the Stan
ford police
will be less
tolerant
towards
bicyclists...
FLYER, posted
on hundreds of

ford University administration in con
junction with the Stanford Department of
Public Saftey |sic| have imposed more
stringent regulations and policies on bicy
cle traffic laws. Out of concern for public
saftey |sic] the Stanford police will be less
tolerant towards bicyclists in violation of
traffic laws."
Specifically, the notice claimed
that lines tor bicycle-related traffic
violations would be doubled be
tween Apr. 27 and May 3. It also of
fered a bulleted list of traffic laws,
including one that read "bicycle
helmets must be worn at all times,"
which set off a flood of messages to
campus email lists.
DPS Lt. Larry St. Denis said the
notices were not issued by the DPS
and that he was unaware of any
change in policy. St. Denis also
added that the DPS does not have
the power to increase traffic fines,
although he did not rule out the
possibility that the notices had
been posted by another agency.
St. Denis also told I"he Daily
that some of the information con
tained in the notice did not reflect
current traffic laws.
"Bicycle helmets are only
mandatory if you're under 18" he
said.
The notice also claimed that
"headphones must not be worn
during transit on trafficked
streets," which is only partially cor
rect. According to St. Denis, a bicy
clist cannot have headphones in
both ears, but wearing a listening
device in one ear is not against the
law.
St. Denis added that the two
other items on the notice — "front
and rear bicycle lights must be at
tached and turned on before dusk"
and "bicycles must stop at all desig
nated stop signs and yield to on
coming traffic" — are legally accu
rate.
