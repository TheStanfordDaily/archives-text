## Schools now banning iPods 
### REBECCA BOONE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MERIDIAN. Idaho— Banning
baseball caps during tests was obvi
ous — students were writing the an
swers under the brim. Then, schools
started banning cell phones, realizing
students could text message the an
swers to each other.
Now. schools across the country
are targeting digital media players as
a potential cheating device. Devices
including iPods and Zunes can be
hidden under clothing, with just an
earbud and a wire snaking behind an
ear and into a shirt collar to give
them away, school officials say.
"It doesn't take long to get out of
the loop with teenagers," said Moun
tain View High School Principal
Aaron Maybon."They come up with
new and creative ways to cheat pret
ty fast."
Mountain View recently enacted

a ban on digital media players after
school officials realized some stu
dents were downloading formulas
and other material onto the players.
"A teacher overheard a couple of
kids talking about it." said Maybon.
Shana Kemp, spokeswoman for
the National Association of Sec
ondary School Principals, said she
does not have hard statistics on the
phenomenon but said it is not unusu
al for schools to ban digital media
players.
"I think it is becoming a national
trend," she said. "We hope that each
district will have a policy in place for
technology — it keeps a lot of the
problems down."
Using the devices to cheat is hard
ly a new phenomenon, Kemp said.
However, sometimes it takes awhile
for teachers and administrators, who
come from an older generation, to
catch on to the various ways the tech
nology can be used.
