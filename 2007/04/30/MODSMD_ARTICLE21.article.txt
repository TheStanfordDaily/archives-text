## Produce stand: fresh addition to Farm Stand praised by customers for quality of local-grown produce 
### LYNDA BROWNING 
Strawberries, kiwis, fava beans and rainbow
chard took center stage at Tresidder Union on Fri
day, as the first installment of Stanford Dining's Pro
duce Stand was a hit among organizers and buyers
alike.
There was a long line of customers waiting for the
noontime opening of the stand, which was nearly out
of its local produce when it closed five hours later.
While the stand offered plenty of farm-fresh
fruits and vegetables, it scarcely resembled a tradi
tional farmer's market. In fact, there were no farm
ers— at least not the sort of farmers students may
have been expecting.
Stanford Dining handled all the logistics.from as
sembling the stand to hiring student gardeners to
run the register. According to Stanford Dining offi
cials. this made it easier for growers to participate in
the program and allowed for a more efficient trans
portation of the produce from farms in Salinas.

And while the student gardeners at the produce
stand may not have grown the food themselves, they
were more than ready to talk about the program.
"The produce comes from an organization called
the Agricultural and Land-Based Training Associa
tion (ALBA) that Stanford Dining also works with
for food sourcing,"said Briana Swette' 10. one of the
student gardeners who worked at the stand.
A non-profit organization, A LB A trains aspiring
organic farmers and provides them with land: it also
distributes produce for a consortium of organic
farmers.
Student gardener Fadi Quran '10 explained the
mission of the produce stand, saying one of its goals
was to promote healthy living.
"We want to support the farmers, and we want to
provide people with local, organic food to support
healthier lifestyles," he said.
While a similar 2003 endeavor failed due to a lack
of student interest, Friday's produce stand had bare
ly enough food to satisfy demand — and definitely
did not have enough strawberries.
"The strawberries were the first to go — they
were gone in a flash,"said Emmett I lopkins,sustain
able foods coordinator for Stanford Dining."People
have definitelv been asking for fruit. But one girl

came hack lor a second bunch of radishes after fin
ishing the first in a math ckiss."
Officials attributed the event's success to an in
crease in health and environmental consciousness
amongst students, which has spurred interest 111 lo
cally-grown produce.
"We're at a higher level of awareness now." said
Stanford Dining's Senior Associate Director Eric
Montell. "People t;ilk about 'locavores.' There's
even a terminology around it. Student involvement
has given it a much greater richness."
The produce stand will be open on campus every
Friday from noon to 5 p.m. throughout the growing
season, and Stanford I fining officials expressed con
fidence in its potential.
"In the future, we hope to expand the operation
to include baked goods and other local foods." Exec
utive Director of Stanford Dining Rafi Taheriansaid
in an email to The Daily.
Students, too. were almost uniformly happy with
the produce stand and its mission.
"I think this is awesome, especially for students
without cars."said Dan Steele.a graduate student in
music. "They are at good prices too."

Student farmers worked the registers at the Stanford Produce Stand Friday afternoon in Tresidder, selling strawberries, kiwis, and a number of other fruit and
vegetables to loyal organic produce enthusiasts. Many touted the quality of the produce and appreciated the new Stanford Dining service.
