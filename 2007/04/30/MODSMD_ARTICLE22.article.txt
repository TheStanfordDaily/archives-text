## Girls drop MPSF title to Bruins 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
After cruising to the championship
match of the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration conference tournament, the Stan
ford women's water polo team suffered a
demoralizing 9-3 loss yesterday evening to
perennial rival UCLA.
Ihe No. 2 ranked Bruins (25-2) came
out firing, scoring the first five goals of the
match before senior driver Katie Hansen
got No. 1-seeded Stanford (25-2) on the
board late in the second period. Hansen
and sophomore Kira Hillman both scored
for Stanford in the second half, but
UCLA's four-goal lead at the half ultimate
ly proved insurmountable as the Cardinal
was defeated for just the second time this
season.
The Stanford women likely experienced
an unpleasant feeling of deja vu as their
contest against UCLA unfolded.The early
stages of the match developed similarly to
the two teams' semifinal showdown at the
NCAA tournament last year — in that
game, the Cardinal also got off to a slow
start offensively as the Bruius pounded
their way to a 3-0, first-period lead. Addi
tionally. in both games, the UCLA defense
managed to keep the Cardinal from mount
ing any serious threat in the second half of
play.
The good news for the Stanford squad is
that yesterday's loss to the Bruins came at
MPSFs — not at NCAAs. As the top team
in the nation heading into this past week
end's tournament, the Cardinal's perform
ance this season virtually assures them of
one of the three at-large bids for this year's
NCAA Championships. Stanford was un
defeated in conference play and had hand
ed the defending national champion Bruins
a pair of losses during the regular season, so

the Cardinal's chances of earning a spot in
the eight-team NCAA field are solid.
Nevertheless, yesterday's loss left a bit
ter taste in the mouths of the Stanford
women, who were unable to put the finish
ing touches on an otherwise impressive
weekend.
I laving earned a bye into the quarterfi
nals, the Cardinal opened on Friday against
No. 9-seeded UC-lrvine (18-13). It was all
Stanford early on. as four different mem
bers of the squad combined to put the Car
dinal up 4-0 after the first period of play. Ju
nior driver Jackie Gauthier kept Stanford's

momentum rolling by tallying a hat-trick
within a two-minute span, midway through
the second period.The Anteaters were able
to get past Stanford senior goalie Meridith
McColl during the second period.but at the
end of the half Stanford held the command
ing 8-2 lead.
The second half featured more offensive
fireworks as the Stanford women went on
to double their goal total from the break.
Hansen tacked on another pair of goals in
the third period to match Gauthier's three
goals. Sophomore driver Koree Blyleven,
recently returned from injury, netted three
goals in the fourth quarter, and the game
ended with the final score standing at 17-5
in favor of the Cardinal.
On Saturday, the Stanford women ad
vanced to take on No. 4-seeded Hawaii. As
the 16-10 final score attested, the game was
a high-scoring affair.The Cardinal trailed 4-
2 in the final minute of the first period, but

Gauthier brought her team back even by
stunning the Hawaii defense, finding the
back of the net on Stanford's last two pos
sessions of the period. Her goals came with
17 seconds and two seconds remaining on
clock, respectively.
But the second period was as uneven as
the first period was even, and Stanford
went on a 6-1 scoring run to take control of
the contest. Gauthier and Hansen both
solved Hawaii goaltender Meike de Nooy
twice in the period, and senior Christina
Hewko and freshman Kelly Eaton both
contributed goals to push the Stanford lead
to 10-5.
In addition. McColl posted nine saves on
the day. limiting the Hawaii offense to just
two goals in the critical second and third pe
riods of the game. Freshman goalie Kate
Heddleston got her first taste of postseason
