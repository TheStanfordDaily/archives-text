## Edwards, Okwo earn firstday NFL draff selections 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The wait was longer than many expected,
but former Cardinal quarterback Trent Ed
wards '06 did eventually get the call he had
been waiting for.
With the 92nd pick overall, the Buffalo Bills
ended Edwards' televised purgatory, snatching
him up with just seven more picks remaining
on day one of the 2007 NFL Draft. Edwards,
whose trying day was monitored closely by an
ESPN camera in his living room, was visibly re
lieved by the telephone call he received from
the Bills' organization just moments before his
selection.
Edwards was projected by many analysts to
be the third quarterback chosen behind LSU's
JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady
Quinn, but he was eventually the sixth signal
caller taken overall.
Over the course of the second and third
rounds, Edwards was interviewed on multiple
occasions by a panel of ESPN commentators,
which included former quarterback-turned
analyst Sean Salisbury, whom the Stanford
graduate impressed with his composure.
"[He's] my new favorite guy," Salisbury told
ESPN's viewers following Buffalo's choice.
Ironically, just moments later, a second for
mer Cardinal standout was selected: Line
backer Michael Okwo '06 went to the Chicago
Bears with the 94th overall selection. Okwo's
athletic abilities could make him a perfect fit
for Chicago's "Cover 2" defensive scheme,
which traditionally highlights the speed and in
telligence of its linebackers, while minimizing
the importance of height and bulk.
In the draft's second day, former Cardinal
safety Brandon Harrison '06 was selected by
the Houston Texans with a fifth-round choice;
he was the 144 th pick overall.
Last year, four former Cardinal players
were selected in the NFL Draft, which includes
255 overall picks. However, just one Stanford
player, linebacker Jon Alston '05. was selected
on that draft's first day.
