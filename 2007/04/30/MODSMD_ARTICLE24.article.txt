# Baseball misses OSU upset
## Card drops two to defending champion Beavers 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For a few minutes on Sunday, it
looked like Stanford baseball might
steal its first Pacific-10 Conference
series of the year with two late
comebacks on back-to-back days.
Down by three in the bottom of the
ninth, the Cardinal loaded the bases
against Oregon State closer Eddie
Kunz. bringing the potential win
ning run to the plate.
But Kunz — one day removed
from hitting freshman Toby Gerhart
in an almost identical situation en
route to a 9-7, extra-innings win for
Stanford — retired junior first base
man Randy Molina on a chopper,
sealing the Beavers' seventh win
against the Cardinal in the last eight
games, 8-6.
The Cardinal (18-23, 3-12 Pac
-10) also dropped Friday's series
opener against the defending na
tional champion Beavers, 13-7. Last
year. Oregon State (34-9,6-6) swept
Stanford and ended its postseason
run at the NCAA Super Regionals
in Corvallis, Ore.
Stanford lost its fifth straight
conference series despite scoring 22

runs against the Pac-10's top pitch
ing staff over the weekend. Junior
second baseman Adam Sorgi led the
Cardinal from the plate,going eight
for 13 in the series, with five RBI.
"To be honest, for the first time
all year 1 think it was a positive se
ries," Sorgi said. "We fell short. We
wanted to take the series, especially
from Oregon State... but we bat
tled."

Junior Erik Davis (2-1) took
Sundays loss after giving up a two
run home run over the centerfield
wall to Jason Ogata in the top of the
first inning. The Ogata homer was
one of three given up by Cardinal
pitching.
Jorge Reyes (3-0) kept his per
fect record intact allowing three
runs over six innings in the series fi
nale.

GAME NOTES: With eights hits arid five RBI
on the weekend against Oregon State,
second baseman Adarn Sorgi pushed his
team-leading batting average to .396.
Sunday's loss drops Stanford to 3-12 in
Pac-10 play, leaving the Cardinal in last
place in the conference. Stanford will close
out its six-game home stand with tomor
row's 6 p.m. start against the Santa Clara
Broncos.

Sandwiched between the two
losses, the Cardinal can take solace
in the signature win of its season —
Saturday's dramatic,9-7 win in extra
innings.
Trailing 7-6 with a 2-2 count in
the bottom of the 11th, junior
Michael Taylor launched a walk-off,
three-run homer off of reliever


DANIEL SCHULTZ/The Stanford Daily
Michael Taylor takes a swing against Oregon State this past weekend. The
junior outfielder won Saturday's 9-7 game against the defending champs
with a three-run walk-off blast over the left field wall.
Greg Kelm to deep left field.
Taylor's heroics came one at-bat
after the preseason All-American
grounded into a bases loaded, in
ning-ending double play in the bot
tom of the ninth, with the game
tied, 6-6. But on his second oppor
tunity, the only question off the bat
was whether the ball would stay
fair.
"We've had some emotional
games... but we've been on the other
end of it,"Taylor said."Having some
thing positive gives you a good feel
ing in your stomach when you go to
sleep at night and makes you excited
to come back to the ballpark."
"They've kind of had my number
over the last couple years, so 1 loved
(getting the game-winner]." Taylor
added. "1 relished it."
The game looked all but over for
the Cardinal after OSU's Jordan
Lennerton led off the top of the 11 th
with his second solo home run of the
game to straight-away centerfield off
junior Nolan Gallagher.
Gallagher (3-5), a starter at the
beginning of the season, pitched five
innings in relief of freshman starter
Jeff Inman. OSU's Anton Maxwell
(3-1) took the loss.

Head coach Mark Marquess was
ejected in the 10th inning for argu
ing with the umpires after three
consecutive Gallagher pitches ap
peared to be good enough for a
strikeout.
"1 ask the players not to argue,"
Marquess said after the game. "If 1
see something that's bad. 1 have to
stand up for them. He missed two ob
vious strikes, and that's not fair to
our pitcher who's out their working
hard."
After the ejection, Gallagher
gave up a potential RBI single to
right field, but Taylor came up with
the ball quickly and fired a strike to
sophomore substitute catcher Jason
Castro, who tagged out Joey Wong at
the plate.
"[That] was kind of the story of
the day: Guys picking each other
up." Gallagher said. "If one guy
screwed up. the next guy was picking
you up."
Stanford trailed 6-4 heading into
the bottom of the ninth, but forced it
to extra after Kunz — who entered
the game with a 1.95 ERA and eight
saves — went wild, walking two Car
dinal batters and hitting Gerhart.
In the series opener, Stanford
came back from an early four-run
deficit to tie the game at 4-4 in the
fourth, but starter Jeremy Bleich (1-
8) surrendered a three-run. bases
clearing double to Lennerton in a
five-run fifth.

Mitch Canham also cleared the
bases with another three-RBI dou
ble in the ninth, putting the Beavers
up by the final margin, 13-7. Pitcher
Blake Keitzman (1-0) earned his
first career victory in relief.
"There were a lot of walks, and we
had a couple errors, but we gave up
hits in big spots," Marquess said.
"And to their credit, they got the
bases loaded and scored six runs
with two swings of the bat."
Stanford continues its homestand
with its sixth game in eight days
against Santa Clara tomorrow. The
Cardinal has dropped both games to
the Broncos this season, 13-5 and 6-
3.
First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond.
