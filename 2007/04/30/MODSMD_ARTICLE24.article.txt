# Baseball misses OSU upset
## Card drops two to defending champion Beavers 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For a few minutes on Sunday, it
looked like Stanford baseball might
steal its first Pacific-10 Conference
series of the year with two late
comebacks on back-to-back days.
Down by three in the bottom of the
ninth, the Cardinal loaded the bases
against Oregon State closer Eddie
Kunz. bringing the potential win
ning run to the plate.
But Kunz — one day removed
from hitting freshman Toby Gerhart
in an almost identical situation en
route to a 9-7, extra-innings win for
Stanford — retired junior first base
man Randy Molina on a chopper,
sealing the Beavers' seventh win
against the Cardinal in the last eight
games, 8-6.
The Cardinal (18-23, 3-12 Pac
-10) also dropped Friday's series
opener against the defending na
tional champion Beavers, 13-7. Last
year. Oregon State (34-9,6-6) swept
Stanford and ended its postseason
run at the NCAA Super Regionals
in Corvallis, Ore.
Stanford lost its fifth straight
conference series despite scoring 22

runs against the Pac-10's top pitch
ing staff over the weekend. Junior
second baseman Adam Sorgi led the
Cardinal from the plate,going eight
for 13 in the series, with five RBI.
"To be honest, for the first time
all year 1 think it was a positive se
ries," Sorgi said. "We fell short. We
wanted to take the series, especially
from Oregon State... but we bat
tled."

Junior Erik Davis (2-1) took
Sundays loss after giving up a two
run home run over the centerfield
wall to Jason Ogata in the top of the
first inning. The Ogata homer was
one of three given up by Cardinal
pitching.
Jorge Reyes (3-0) kept his per
fect record intact allowing three
runs over six innings in the series fi
nale.
