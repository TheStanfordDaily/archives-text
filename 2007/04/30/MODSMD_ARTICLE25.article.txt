The defense ruled the day as Stanford held its
annual Cardinal-White spring football game in
Stanford Stadium on Saturday. The Stanford
teams recorded two interceptions and seven
sackedquarterbacks.
"It wasn't our best day offensively," new head
coach Jim Harbaugh told GoStanford.com.
When the defense wasn't putting pressure on
the quarterback.errant throws and dropped pass
es bogged down the Stanford offense. The trend
was the opposite of last week's scrimmage, when
the offense led the way. Starting quarterback T.C.
Ostrander completed 19 of 36 passes for lf>4
yards this weekend, plagued by drops, off-target
throws and pressure.
Redshirt freshman running back Tyrone Mc-
Graw provided the biggest spark of the day. tak

ing a handoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Redshirt
freshman cornerback Nick Sanchez and senior
defensive end Nick Macaluso were among sever
al impressive defenders; Sanchez picked off a
pass and made several strong tackles while
Macaluso harassed quarterbacks all afternoon
and registered two sacks.
McGraw appeared to injure a hamstring at the
end of his touchdown run and did not play the rest
of the day. Senior backup tailback Jason Evans
played sparingly and two-year starter Anthony
Kimble did not play due to injury. The running
back situation was so dire that by the end of the
game, Stanford was using two fullbacks, one oper
ating as a tailback, in an I-formation.
Positive signs included infrequent penalties
and a strong punting game, although the special
teams missed several field-goal attempts. All
units moved onto and off of the field briskly, with
out confusion or miscommunication.

In 25 possessions, the offensive units reached
the end zone four times. After McGraws touch

a one-yard run.and sophomore Tavita Pritchard
lofted a touchdown to redshirt freshman Stephen
Carr. Carr broke free from his defender on a post
route for the 36-yard score. Junior Kelton Lynn
added a 43-yard touchdown reception from
Pritchard to round out the scoring. An intercep
tion by the defense returned for a touchdown was
wiped off the scoreboard when officials ruled the
quarterback had been sacked prior to throwing
the ball.
The game followed a format that pitted the top
offensive and defensive units against each other;
the second-string offense and defense comprised
the second team for scoring purposes.
