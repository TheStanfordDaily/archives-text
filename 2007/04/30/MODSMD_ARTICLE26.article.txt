squeeze bunt on the next at-bat was
fielded cleanly by Penna, who
flipped to freshman Rosey Neill to
tag Roth out at home.
Stanford looked in position to
win when junior Tricia Aggabao was
walked in the bottom of the seventh
with the team's leading hitter, fresh
man Alissa Haber. coming up. But
since Aggabao was caught stealing at
second, the game went to extra in
nings. Senior Jackie Rinehart was
sacrificed to second base for the Car
dinal in the eighth, but was stranded
when the next two Cardinal batters
Hied out. Pinch runner Anna Beard
man got to third base in the bottom
of the ninth, but a groundout ended
the scoring oppor■unity.
The most suspenseful moment
came in the top of the 10th when Ari
zona's Chelsie Mesa stroked a ball
down the right-field line with the
speedy Caitlin Lowe on first. Um
pires ruled that Lowe left the base
early, putting her out and ending an
other opportunity. And in the 11th
and 12th innings. Penna got out of
two-on jams.
After three and a half hours of play,
coaches agreed to end it: Arizona
was flying out of the Bay Area soon
after. Whether the game would be
ruled a tie in the win-loss records
was undetermined at press time.
Saturday's victory was Stanford's
first win over Arizona (35-10, 11-3
Pac-10) since 2004,and only the fifth
in program history. Junior right-han
der Becky McCullough (9-7) started
for the Cardinal and performed su
perbly. retiring the first seven batters
she faced and not allowing a runner
past second base in the first four in
nings.
At the same time, Mowatt was
working on a no-hitter through four,
and it was McCullough who cracked
first in the top half of the fifth inning.
Hie Wildcats hit back-to-back sin
gles to start the inning, and then ad
vanced runners to second and third
on a sacrifice bunt. A sacrifice fly and

a single later, Arizona led 2-0 against
a Stanford offense that had only one
walk to show for its troubles.
The Cardinal got to Mowatt in
the next inning. Stanford loaded the
bases with one out. thanks to a pair
of walks and a single to center field
by senior shortstop Lindsay Key.
With Aggabao up to bat.junior Inn
Howe came home on a wild pitch
before Aggabao belted a foul ball
that was just feet from a home run.
On the next pitch. Aggabo ripped a
two-RBI single to right field, giving
Stanford a 3-2 lead. After hitting the
first batter of the sixth inning, Mc-
Cullough sent the next six hitters
back to the dugout to secure the
upset win.
Against Arizona State (45-13.9-6
Pac-10) on Friday, Penna (22-7)
pitched well for the Cardinal, but the
line-up simply could not stop Sun
Devils phenom Katie Burkhart.The
junior, who leads the Pac-10 in virtu
ally every pitching category, struck
out four and walked none over seven
shutout innings in the 2-0 Stanford
loss.
Penna gave up the only two runs
of the game in the top of the sixth in
ning. ASU led off the frame with an
infield single, and Penna got one out
on a grounder before hitting the next
batter.That brought up the Sun Dev
ils' Bianca Cruz, who drove in her
league-leading 63rd and h4th runs of
the year with a single to right. Penna
struck out the next two batters, but
the damage was done.
A bunt single by Aggabao and a
walk to I label in the next hall inning
preceded a minor controversy.
Freshman Shannon Koplitz lifted a
hit to shallow left center: I label ad
vanced past second, but was tagged
out trying to get back to the bag. Hie

Aggabao crossed the plate, taking

squeeze bunt on the next at-bat was
fielded cleanly by Penna, who
flipped to freshman Rosey Neill to
tag Roth out at home.
Stanford looked in position to
win when junior Tricia Aggabao was

man Alissa Haber. coming up. But
since Aggabao was caught stealing at
second, the game went to extra in
nings. Senior Jackie Rinehart was

dinal in the eighth, but was stranded
when the next two Cardinal batters
Hied out. Pinch runner Anna Beard
man got to third base in the bottom
of the ninth, but a groundout ended
the scoring oppor■unity.
The most suspenseful moment
came in the top of the 10th when Ari
zona's Chelsie Mesa stroked a ball
down the right-field line with the
speedy Caitlin Lowe on first. Um
pires ruled that Lowe left the base
early, putting her out and ending an
other opportunity. And in the 11th
and 12th innings. Penna got out of
two-on jams.
After three and a half hours of play,
coaches agreed to end it: Arizona
was flying out of the Bay Area soon
after. Whether the game would be
ruled a tie in the win-loss records
was undetermined at press time.
Saturday's victory was Stanford's
first win over Arizona (35-10, 11-3
Pac-10) since 2004,and only the fifth
in program history. Junior right-han
der Becky McCullough (9-7) started
for the Cardinal and performed su
perbly. retiring the first seven batters
she faced and not allowing a runner
past second base in the first four in
nings.
At the same time, Mowatt was
working on a no-hitter through four,
and it was McCullough who cracked
first in the top half of the fifth inning.
Hie Wildcats hit back-to-back sin
gles to start the inning, and then ad
vanced runners to second and third
on a sacrifice bunt. A sacrifice fly and

a single later, Arizona led 2-0 against
a Stanford offense that had only one
walk to show for its troubles.
The Cardinal got to Mowatt in
the next inning. Stanford loaded the
bases with one out. thanks to a pair
of walks and a single to center field
by senior shortstop Lindsay Key.
With Aggabao up to bat.junior Inn
Howe came home on a wild pitch
before Aggabao belted a foul ball
that was just feet from a home run.
On the next pitch. Aggabo ripped a
two-RBI single to right field, giving
Stanford a 3-2 lead. After hitting the
first batter of the sixth inning, Mc-
Cullough sent the next six hitters
back to the dugout to secure the
upset win.
Against Arizona State (45-13.9-6
Pac-10) on Friday, Penna (22-7)
pitched well for the Cardinal, but the
line-up simply could not stop Sun
Devils phenom Katie Burkhart.The
junior, who leads the Pac-10 in virtu
ally every pitching category, struck
out four and walked none over seven
shutout innings in the 2-0 Stanford
loss.
Penna gave up the only two runs
of the game in the top of the sixth in
ning. ASU led off the frame with an
infield single, and Penna got one out
on a grounder before hitting the next
batter.That brought up the Sun Dev
ils' Bianca Cruz, who drove in her
league-leading 63rd and h4th runs of
the year with a single to right. Penna
struck out the next two batters, but
the damage was done.
A bunt single by Aggabao and a
walk to I label in the next hall inning
preceded a minor controversy.
Freshman Shannon Koplitz lifted a
hit to shallow left center: I label ad
vanced past second, but was tagged
out trying to get back to the bag. Hie
umpires ruled she was out before
Aggabao crossed the plate, taking
the run off the scoreboard. Stanford
head coach John Rittman engaged in
a heated and lengthy discussion with
the officials, but was not ejected
from the game. The baserunning
miscue would be a harbinger of
questionable Cardinal baserunning
all weekend.
