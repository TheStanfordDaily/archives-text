JOHN SHEN/The Stanford Daily
Close to 100 Stanford students participated in the Global Day for Darfur rally in San Francisco yesterday.
Organized partly by Students Take Action Now: Darfur (STAND), the rally was one of dozens held across the
nation to mark the fourth anniversary of the Darfur genocide, which has claimed about 400,000 lives and
displaced more than two million from their homes. According to STAND coordinator Elissa Test '07, the
group gathered about 1,500 signatures on two different petitions one that called for multilateral sanc
tions and military intervention in Sudan and the other that called for China to exert its political and econom
ic leverage on the Sudanese government. While organizers called the event a success, fewer people showed
up for the demonstration this year than did last year, when more than 4,000 people stormed the Golden
Gate Bridge to link hands and engage in five minutes of silence to mourn the genocide's victims.
