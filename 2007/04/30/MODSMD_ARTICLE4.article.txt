# GSB dean averts lending scandal
## University defends Joss' independence, spot on Wells Fargo's Board of Directors 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As university administrators na
tionwide continue to receive a hail
storm of criticism for their cushy
connections with lending compa
nies, Graduate School of Business
(GSB) Dean Robert Joss told ITie
Daily that his position on the board
of directors at Wells Fargo does not
create an inappropriate conflict of
interest.
"1 have no involvement in any
issue of financial aid." Joss said. "1
don't even know all that much about
who's involved."
In a New York Times article earli
er this month. Joss was one of three
officials named as serving on the
management board of a major lend
ing firm in addition to holding a top
administration role at a university.
Joss, who earned his MBA and
Ph.D. from the University in 1%7
and has been dean of the GSB since
1999, defended his position at Wells
Fargo as ethical because he does not
have any control over financial aid
at the GSB or at the undergraduate
level.
He also told The Daily that he
maintains full disclosure with the
University about all of his business
relations and that administrators
have not objected to this arrange
ment.
"They're certainly aware that I
am a board member and that I don't
have any involvement with financial
aid or lending decisions," Joss said.
He added that he was surprised
that the connections between uni
versity administrators and student
lenders had gotten so much atten
tion in recent weeks.
'i mean, who would have thought

that something like student loans
would be so controversial." Joss said.
"I think it kind of shocked us all."
The scandal erupted four weeks
ago when New York Attorney Gen
eral Andrew Cuomo found that
lenders had illegally bribed steering
committee members at several uni
versities and requested more infor
mation from several others — in
cluding the University of Southern
California and New York's Colum
bia University.
That inquiry led to investigations
across the nation and has forced
many schools to more closely evalu
ate their lending processes.
Students who request federal stu
dent loans are typically required to
seek an outside private lender. To
help students in this process, many
universities designate as 'preferred'
a small number of lenders; they then
recommend these preferred lenders
to students.
The GSB's Financial Aid Office
maintains a list of five recommend
ed lenders, which it says are selected
based on a set of criteria ranging
from interest rates to customer serv
ice.
"The GSB has a competitive
process for recommended lenders
and Weils Fargo was not selected in
the most recent round and has not
been a recommended lender in the
GSB program for at least six years."
Director of University Communica
tions Alan Acosta said in an email to
The Daily.
After a series of legal settlements
and Congressional investigations
into improper arrangements be
tween several universities and stu
dent loan companies, The New York
Times publicized Joss' connections
with Wells Fargo in an Apr. 14 article.
Robert Shireman. executive di
rector of ITie Project on Student
Debt — a group that works to in
crease public understanding of stu
dent loans, — said that it is not un
common for business school admin
istrators to simultaneously serve on
the board of a lending company.
And though 'preferred' lists have
the potential to facilitate corrup

tion. Shireman said, it is still neces
sary for financial aid offices to help
students narrow the list of possible
lenders from the more than 2.(3<K)
available companies.
"I think it is going to be necessary
for financial aid offices to have an
answer to the question of' Where do
1 go to get my loans financed?"'
Shireman said.
In addition to his roles at the
GSB and Wells Fargo, Joss is also a
director of Shanghai Commercial
Bank. Agilent Technologies and the
Bay Area Council.
