## GSC sends reps, to Washington Student lobbyist will push for tax cuts 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students will soon
have a voice in the nation's capi
tal. when the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) sends representa
tives to Washington. D.C. to lobby
on their behalf.
The GSC has approved one
legislative representative — ap
plied physics student Dirk En
gland — to lobby for tax cuts. An
other representative, who would
advocate reforming regulations
governing international students,
may also make a lobbying trip,
pending approval from the coun
cil.
"The primary goal is to make
change, to go and push these bills
forward." said former GSC co-
Chair Paul Gurncy. who oversaw
much of the preparation toward
the lobbying effort.
On his trip to Washington next
week, Englund plans to meet with
several local representatives —
including Representative Anna
Eshoo (D-CA) and Senators l)i-

Anne Feinstein (D-CA) and Bar
bara Boxer (D-CA) — and other
lawmakers to advocate making
graduate stipends tax-free.
Though most graduate stu
dents nationwide receive a
stipend to cover some of the cost
of their education. Englund said
that they rarely receive enough.
And since l l )86, graduate stu
dents have had to pay taxes on
that already insufficient source of
income.
"We at the GSC think that to
strengthen America's global com
petitiveness in research and edu
cation." Englund said in an email
to The Daily. "Congress should
reverse this taxation and adopt
broad tax relief to make graduate
studies more attractive and acces
sible."
Specifically, Englund said that
provisions of 200 Is Economic
Growth Tax Relief Reconcilia
tion Act should be made perma
nent. 1 le also plans to push for
making the interest on student
loans tax-deductible and said he
will argue that room and board
should be classified as qualified
educational expenses.
