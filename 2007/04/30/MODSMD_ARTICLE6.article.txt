closest thing Stanford has to a monastery for its intellectuals.

This is where former Peruvian president
Alejandro Toledo does his thinking. In a

state ponders what's next. Mis unlikely rise
from penniless villager to Stanford Ph.D.
(1993) to president made headlines and
prompted the University to select him as its
commencement speaker in 2(H)3.
Since his five-year term ended last July,
the 62 year old has been making up for lost
time with his wife and daughter, traveling the
world to converse with allies and thinking
about what comes next.
In his first interview granted since step
ping down as president, given exclusively to

The Daily over two sessions last week,
Toledo reflected on his legacy and artic
ulated a comprehensive plan to battle
poverty.
"Government day-to-day is very
absorbing," he said. "It's been such a
soft landing that it is incredible. I'm
glad that I now have the time and space
to process and digest my thoughts."

years as chief executive of a country
with almost 30 million people.
While most his age would look to
retirement, Toledo talks energetical
ly about dedicating his life to the
"war" against poverty and for
democracy, two concepts which he
inextricably links when he talks
about his view of the world and of
Latin America.
"When I'm involved in this fight
as an Indian soldier. I don't feel too
tired," he said. "It is the cause I've de
cided to dedicate the rest of my life
to. \\ hat the hell."
When a national leader like Tole
do steps down. Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 said in an
email to The Daily, "it is essential
that he have a chance to 'decom
press.'"
Etchemendy said the University
was honored to have Toledo, the
only former head of state with an
appointment, "to reflect on his ex
periences and perhaps record those
reflections; to think about the future
and perhaps retool for new endeav
ors; and to share what he has
learned with students and col
leagues."
At one point during his presiden
cy, polls showed that Toledo's ap
proval rating hovered around 10
percent. Toledo said that after he
peacefully turned over power to his
successor last year, his popularity in
the country dramatically increased.
"I 'm not a good judge of my own
administration," he said. "Let histo
ry judge the results of what I did."
But while the former leader has
his vocal critics at home, including
successor Alan Garcia, Toledo has
been heavily praised by scholars in
the Ivory Tower.
Toledo recently accepted an
offer from Political Science Prof.
Larry Diamond to be a distin
guished scholar next year at the
Center on Democracy, Develop
ment and the Rule of Law, which is
part of the University's Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies (FSI).
Diamond, who is also a senior
fellow at the I loover Institution and
coordinator of the democracy pro
gram at FSl.said that Toledo is gen
uine. authentic and a truly historical

figure.
"He came through a very turbu
lent period in Peruvian politics." Di
amond said. "He's not just a figure
of the past. He's very determined to
have an impact on the future."
Toledo wore a collared blue shirt
with two buttons undone and a pair
of Armani Exchange blue jeans. His
black hair is graying a bit. but he's
still the firebrand he was on the
stump when he gets started about
something he wants to talk about.
He said that loyalists to rival Al
berto Fujimori worked overtime to
fight the man who led the coalition
that brought down the Peruvian
government.
"Fujimori never forgot what 1
did." Toledo said. "They made my
life impossible."
Toledo first contacted ITie Daily
to complain that an Associated
Press story, which had been printed
in this newspaper, inaccurately re
ported he was returning to Peru to
face fraud charges. No such charges
were filed, he said, and the rumors
were played up by his opponents in
a continuing effort to discredit him.
Toledo, the first indigenous man
elected president of Peru in the
modern era, said he inherited a
country with fragile democratic in
stitutions in the depths of recession.
"For people, it was difficult to
swallow that the person in the
palace is not one of them," he said.
"There were some doses of racism
and skepticism. It wasn't easy, but 1
stuck to it. 1 respect the press, but I
never changed my direction be
cause of fabricated news. In the end.
1 thank God that it paid off."
Last November, he went to
Nicaragua with former U.S. Presi
dent Jimmy Carter to supervise its
presidential election. Earlier this
month, he sent a letter to leaders
worldwide calling on them to ad
dress human rights abuses in Myan
mar (Burma). Two weeks ago, the
New York Democracy Forum
awarded Toledo with their Presi
dential Medal for his support of
democracy.
On May 24, he will receive the
Presidential Award from the Bay
Area Youth Fund, an institution
that promotes the first child of a
poor family to attend higher educa
tion. He's opened up a center to
support democracy and develop
ment, with offices in Spain and
Lima, Peru's capital.
He has even sold movie rights to

his story.
When asked if he'll run for presi
dent again in 2011, as some have
speculated, he says it would be pre
mature to weigh in.
"I'll tell you this much," he said
later in the interview. "I'm not fin
ished yet."
"One thing I'm proud of is that
whatever small contribution 1 made
was done within a framework of ab
solute respect to democratic princi
ples," he said. "And, damn, it has
been so hard."
He said sometimes that the free
press got on his nerves, but he never
cracked down. He said that he
worked largely within the con
straints of democracy in a develop
ing country during a time of turmoil
has made him popular among many
American scholars.
"1 consider him a dedicated de
mocrat," said FSI senior fellow and
Political Science Prof. Michael Mc-
Faul in an email to The Daily, "but
also someone who is trying to un
derstand the very complex relation
ship between democracy and devel
opment."
Toledo, a self-described disciple
of democracy, said that his beloved
form of government needs to deliver
results for the people in the develop
ing world. He said he worries as
Hugo Chavez, the leader of
Venezuela, riles up anti-American
and anti-democratic sentiment in
Latin America.
"The Chavezes of Latin America
are capitalizing on the fertile land for
the emergence of populism," he said.
"That land is fertile as a result of our
inability in the last 1 (K) years to re
duce poverty and put something con
crete to the meaning of democracy."
Papers — some in Spanish,others
in English — were spread out on the
desk of Toledo's cloistered office,
where he is writing two books. The
first is an update on a book he wrote
more than a decade ago about his life
story.The second will detail his plan
for fighting poverty.They are expect
ed to be released toward the end of
2008.
I lis wife, Eliane Karp, is lecturing
in the anthropological sciences de
partment at the University. Their
daughter will enter the economics
department's Ph.D. program in the
fall, with an emphasis on the eco
nomics of the environment.
Toledo said that he is trying to do
academic research with "deliberate
policy implications for the fight

against poverty." The war, he sug
gests, can be waged on four fronts.
First, he said government must be
willing to provide direct assistance to
the absolute poorest on the condi
tion that pregnant women get prena
tal care and take their children to be
vaccinated.
During his presidency, Toledo
said he instituted a program when he
was president that gave direct wel
fare to the poorest women because
they are thriftier than their spouses
and less prone to throw it away on al
cohol. But his policy team had to au
dible when the men started taking
the money from the women.
"We gave them whistles," Toledo
quipped. "Then all the women came
out and beat the hell out of the guy."
Second, he believes, investors and
government should support small
business and family enterprise with
micro-credit.
"Those poor people in the High
Andes." he said, "have shown that
they repay faster and better than the
big multinationals."
One minute, he is sitting calmly in
the library of the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sci
ences. The next, he jumps out of his
chair and paces excitedly in circles
around the small table. His smile
brims, voice raises and arms wave.
He talks so fast that his words, but
not ideas, start to jumble over one
another.

The third action he offers is long
term investment in nutrition and
health for small children.
"A mother who is malnourished,"
he said, "will produce a malnour
ished child."
The final ingredient in his recipe
for battling poverty is a long-term in
vestment in education infrastruc
ture, but this, he said, requires the
longest-term thinking.
"It takes 18 or 19 years to see the
results of that investment," he said,
noting that the gains of reforms he
put in place while president will not
be felt for decades."! made decisions
not for the next election but for the
next generation."
Toledo was seen as a disappoint
ment in some quarters when he left
office because even though the econ
omy grew at 6.5 percent during his
final year in the presidency, most Pe
ruvians continued to subsist on less
than $2 a day. After Toledo set his
own salary at $216,000 (he later low
ered it under public pressure), he
was derided as an elite.
Diamond complimented Toledo
for his commitment to democracy.
"I le's left of center but very con
scious of how you need to work
through the market mechanisms," he
said.
Toledo was born in Cabana, a
small Andean Indian village 12.000
feet above sea level. When he went to
study at the University of San Francis

co in the late 1960s tin a soccer schol
arship, he was the only one of 16 chil
dren in his family to attend college.
After struggling to learn English
as an undergraduate, he won admis
sion to the University's School of
Education and picked up a master's
degree while on the Farm (1972).
Later, he consulted for the World
Bank and lectured on economics.
After serving as an economics minis
ter and managing an institute on eco
nomic development, he threw his hat
into the race for president.
Critics considered his bid fanciful;
few thought he could win. He was
challenging Fujimori, an autocrat
who drew ire from the international
community for human rights abuses.
Hi is rags-to-riches success story,
Toledo said, is "a statistical error."
"By an accident, I am free," he
said with a twinkle in his eye. "1 am
free because I can choose. Millions of
people are not free because they are
sentenced to live in poverty. I want to
do the best I can to free my people."
Toledo's sees democracy being
undermined without reduction in
poverty.
"Freedom and democracy is not
just going to vote on Election Day,"
he said. "You cannot have democra
cy if you have a lot of noise in the
streets and in your stomach."
