## Entertainment Alas, poor Hulk 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION NERD 
I didn't grow up reading comic
books. I grew up devouring comic
books. I would read every issue of
"The Mighty Thor." of "Green
1 antern," of assorted Spider-Man
and Superman and X-men series (at
one point in the mid-90s, approxi
mately half the comics on the mar
ket had "X" in the title: "X-Men,"
"X-Factor," "Generation X," "X:
Miami"). Between first and ninth
grade, 1 filled fourteen gigantic
boxes with untold thousands of
comic books. At the time, 1 was
what sociologists refer to as a
"nerd." Now, in a pop culture mar
ketplace dominated by super-he
roes and graphic novels, it turns out
I was just way ahead of the game.
"Ghost Rider" is still minting
some money alongside "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "3(H)."
and it's not even summer yet. Su
perhero movies have become the
norm in I lollywood. It started a few
years ago. "X-Men" and "Spider-
Man" minted cash, but their quality
was questionable. The first "X-
Men" had a career defining per
formance by Hugh Jackman as
Wolverine — a slightly prettified
version of the runtish comic book
character that lost none of the orig
inal's fierce humor — and offered
viewers the opportunity to see lan
Mckellan and Patrick Stewart
throw great acting in each other's
faces, but it suffered from a prepon
derance of exposition at the ex
pense of character. "Spider-Man"
was much more fun, a candy-eyed
bouncy castle of a movie, but it
turned the Green Goblin into a
Power Ranger and tortured viewers
with some of the worst love dia
logue this side of "F.pisode 2."
Comic book movies could be good,
but they could also be "Daredevil"
— a dour "Spider-Man" clone that
started Ben Affleck's decline into
Affleckdom — or "League of Ex
traordinary Gentlemen," which
turned a near-perfect comic into
one of the most joyless adventure
films in history.
"Batman Begins" changed
everything. It had of one of the
greatest young directors in Holly
wood (Chris "Memento" Nolan),
one of the greatest young actors in
Hollywood (Christian Bale, playing
a heroic riff on his "American Psy
cho" yuppie demi-god), and a great
cast (IJam Neeson, Morgan Free
man. Michael Caine. Ken Watanabe
and Tom Wilkinson, all Oscar nom

inees or winners). Together they
created an aesthetic of brute real
ism far removed from "Batman &
Robin"'s Schwarzenegger-Silver
stone hvpercamp. throwing in a
great twist and a Batmobile that
could move with stealthy grace or
lumbering tank-like kineticism. just
like the movie itself.
Moving along, casting Robert
Downey, Jr., as Iron Man makes
grand sense. Iron Man's altar ego.
Tony Stark, is a genius driven to al
coholism by his own obsessive na
ture — a perfect role for Downey, a
mesmerizing actor who's been to
the bottom of several drug barrels
and keeps on fighting. But is it
wrong of me to feel just a little bit
anxious that Gwyneth Paltrow.who
used to be the world's next great ac
tress, is settling for the Katie
Holmes-Kirsten Dunst part, in this
case playing a secretary who I'm
sorry to report goes by "Pepper
Potts." And I love Terence Howard,
but is it too much to ask that after
his bitter, heartrending turns in
"Crash" and "Hustle & Flow," I lol
lywood finds him a better role than
"the best friend?"
And then there's Edward Nor
ton. One of the greatest actors of his
generation. In the span of a year, he
starred in "American History X"
and "Fight Club."and the charac
ters he plays,though quite different,
form a fascinating vision of Ail-
American psychosis. American's
frighteningly intelligent skinhead
got the buzz and the Oscar nod, but
in "Fight Club." Norton takes a
paranoid schizophrenic insomniac
worker drone — a man addicted to
other people's sorrow, a man who
literally can't even recognize him
self — and turns him into an every
man. "Fight Club" ends with Nor
ton and Helena Bonham Carter
staring out a window as skyscrapers
collapse: it's like the 90s staring at
September 11.
Norton's been a bit all over the
map since then — amazing in the
barely-released "25th Hour." ma
ture (with unconvincing accents)
in "The Illusionist" and "Kingdom
of Heaven." terrible or just plain
boring in "Red Dragon,""The Ital
ian Job" and the unfortunate
"Death to Smoochy." He co
starred with de Niro and Brando in
"The Score," and was better than
either of them. And now. he is
going to play the Hulk. Or rather,
he is going to play Bruce Banner,
the quiet scientist who takes up
screen time while the special ef
fects department gets ready for a

gigantic action sequence (the I lulk
battles Mutant Dogs! The Hulk
jumps into space!)
1 love E:d Norton. 1 love the
Hulk. 1 love the fact that we live in a
world where Ed Norton wants to
play the 1 lulk. But I also feel guilty,
bd Norton should be playing lago.
or Nick Carroway, or (heresy!)
some fantastic new character that
can capture our hearts and rede
fines the cinema (back in the ftOs.
Pacinoand Hoffman did that all the
time). 1 feel a certain blood-from-a
stone paranoia whenever I hear
that another amazing actor is play
ing a superhero — not because 1
don't trust the actors to deliver the
goods, and most certainly not be
cause the superheroes themselves
are inherently shallow. It's because
of the nature of these movies: ulti
mately, there has to be a fight scene,
usually several of them.
No matter how good Christian
Bale was as Bruce Wayne, sooner or
later the stunt man in the Bat-cos
tume had to start fighting evil min
ions. No matter how expertly Ed
Norton portrays the anxiety of

being Bruce Banner, he has to turn
into a big green special effect and
battle evil robots. No matter that
Robert Downey IS Tony Stark, he
has to put on that big metal cos
tume. Back in the old days, entire
movies could coast by on pure
charisma. Even Hitchcock noted
that most movies are successful
purely because of casting, and even
though his films are so technically
proficient, he knew that sometimes
he just had to put the camera in
front of Cary Grant's face and let
the magic happen.
All comic book movies, no mat
ter how finely produced, inevitably
depend on spectacle: Spider Man
careening through New York. Mag
neto uprooting the Golden Gate
Bridge. Ghost Rider riding up the
side of a building. Real human
emotion, by nature, has to lose out
to swooping camera movements
and magnificently ludicrous special
effects ("Spider Man 3" supposed
ly cost twice "Titanic"). Maybe 1
just wish that Ed Norton could find
a role more three-dimensional than
"alter ego."

cast (IJam Neeson, Morgan Free
man. Michael Caine. Ken Watanabe
and Tom Wilkinson, all Oscar nom

inees or winners). Together they
created an aesthetic of brute real
ism far removed from "Batman &
Robin"'s Schwarzenegger-Silver
stone hvpercamp. throwing in a
great twist and a Batmobile that
could move with stealthy grace or
lumbering tank-like kineticism. just
like the movie itself.
Moving along, casting Robert
Downey, Jr., as Iron Man makes
grand sense. Iron Man's altar ego.
Tony Stark, is a genius driven to al
coholism by his own obsessive na
ture — a perfect role for Downey, a
mesmerizing actor who's been to
the bottom of several drug barrels
and keeps on fighting. But is it
wrong of me to feel just a little bit
anxious that Gwyneth Paltrow.who
used to be the world's next great ac
tress, is settling for the Katie
Holmes-Kirsten Dunst part, in this
case playing a secretary who I'm
sorry to report goes by "Pepper
Potts." And I love Terence Howard,
but is it too much to ask that after
his bitter, heartrending turns in
"Crash" and "Hustle & Flow," I lol
lywood finds him a better role than
"the best friend?"
And then there's Edward Nor
ton. One of the greatest actors of his
generation. In the span of a year, he
starred in "American History X"
and "Fight Club."and the charac
ters he plays,though quite different,
form a fascinating vision of Ail-
American psychosis. American's
frighteningly intelligent skinhead
got the buzz and the Oscar nod, but
in "Fight Club." Norton takes a
paranoid schizophrenic insomniac
worker drone — a man addicted to
other people's sorrow, a man who
literally can't even recognize him
self — and turns him into an every
man. "Fight Club" ends with Nor
ton and Helena Bonham Carter
staring out a window as skyscrapers
collapse: it's like the 90s staring at
September 11.
Norton's been a bit all over the
map since then — amazing in the
barely-released "25th Hour." ma
ture (with unconvincing accents)
in "The Illusionist" and "Kingdom
of Heaven." terrible or just plain
boring in "Red Dragon,""The Ital
ian Job" and the unfortunate
"Death to Smoochy." He co
starred with de Niro and Brando in
"The Score," and was better than
either of them. And now. he is
going to play the Hulk. Or rather,
he is going to play Bruce Banner,
the quiet scientist who takes up
screen time while the special ef
fects department gets ready for a

gigantic action sequence (the I lulk
battles Mutant Dogs! The Hulk
jumps into space!)
1 love E:d Norton. 1 love the
Hulk. 1 love the fact that we live in a
world where Ed Norton wants to
play the 1 lulk. But I also feel guilty,
bd Norton should be playing lago.
or Nick Carroway, or (heresy!)
some fantastic new character that
can capture our hearts and rede
fines the cinema (back in the ftOs.
Pacinoand Hoffman did that all the
time). 1 feel a certain blood-from-a
stone paranoia whenever I hear
that another amazing actor is play
ing a superhero — not because 1
don't trust the actors to deliver the
goods, and most certainly not be
cause the superheroes themselves
are inherently shallow. It's because
of the nature of these movies: ulti
mately, there has to be a fight scene,
usually several of them.
No matter how good Christian
Bale was as Bruce Wayne, sooner or
later the stunt man in the Bat-cos
tume had to start fighting evil min
ions. No matter how expertly Ed
Norton portrays the anxiety of

being Bruce Banner, he has to turn
into a big green special effect and
battle evil robots. No matter that
Robert Downey IS Tony Stark, he
has to put on that big metal cos
tume. Back in the old days, entire
movies could coast by on pure
charisma. Even Hitchcock noted
that most movies are successful
purely because of casting, and even
though his films are so technically
proficient, he knew that sometimes
he just had to put the camera in
front of Cary Grant's face and let
the magic happen.
All comic book movies, no mat
ter how finely produced, inevitably
depend on spectacle: Spider Man
careening through New York. Mag
neto uprooting the Golden Gate
Bridge. Ghost Rider riding up the
side of a building. Real human
emotion, by nature, has to lose out
to swooping camera movements
and magnificently ludicrous special
effects ("Spider Man 3" supposed
ly cost twice "Titanic"). Maybe 1
just wish that Ed Norton could find
a role more three-dimensional than
"alter ego."

I didn't grow up reading comic
books. I grew up devouring comic
books. I would read every issue of
"The Mighty Thor." of "Green
1 antern," of assorted Spider-Man
and Superman and X-men series (at
one point in the mid-90s, approxi
mately half the comics on the mar
ket had "X" in the title: "X-Men,"
"X-Factor," "Generation X," "X:
Miami"). Between first and ninth
grade, 1 filled fourteen gigantic
boxes with untold thousands of
comic books. At the time, 1 was
what sociologists refer to as a
"nerd." Now, in a pop culture mar
ketplace dominated by super-he
roes and graphic novels, it turns out
I was just way ahead of the game.
"Ghost Rider" is still minting
some money alongside "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "3(H)."
and it's not even summer yet. Su
perhero movies have become the
norm in I lollywood. It started a few
years ago. "X-Men" and "Spider-
Man" minted cash, but their quality
was questionable. The first "X-
Men" had a career defining per
formance by Hugh Jackman as
Wolverine — a slightly prettified
version of the runtish comic book
character that lost none of the orig
inal's fierce humor — and offered
viewers the opportunity to see lan
Mckellan and Patrick Stewart
throw great acting in each other's
faces, but it suffered from a prepon
derance of exposition at the ex
pense of character. "Spider-Man"
was much more fun, a candy-eyed
bouncy castle of a movie, but it
turned the Green Goblin into a
Power Ranger and tortured viewers
with some of the worst love dia
logue this side of "F.pisode 2."
Comic book movies could be good,
but they could also be "Daredevil"
— a dour "Spider-Man" clone that
started Ben Affleck's decline into
Affleckdom — or "League of Ex
traordinary Gentlemen," which
turned a near-perfect comic into
one of the most joyless adventure
films in history.
"Batman Begins" changed
everything. It had of one of the
greatest young directors in Holly
wood (Chris "Memento" Nolan),
one of the greatest young actors in
Hollywood (Christian Bale, playing
a heroic riff on his "American Psy
cho" yuppie demi-god), and a great
cast (IJam Neeson, Morgan Free
man. Michael Caine. Ken Watanabe
and Tom Wilkinson, all Oscar nom

inees or winners). Together they
created an aesthetic of brute real
