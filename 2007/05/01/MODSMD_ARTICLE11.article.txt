# Spare me the draw-ma, I'm going Greek
## 
### 
The first round of housing hell is fi
nally upon the class of 2010. We
thought spring quarter would be
filled with sunshine, fountain-hopping
and bronzed Stanford students cavort
ing in the Oval — but oh, how wrong we
were. While the housed Greeks among
us may relax, secure in their knowledge
of their home for next year, the rest of us
don't sleep so soundly. To distract my
peers from their anxiety, 1 offer some
history on the buzzwords surround the
Greek system and housing.
Rush
Like most of Greek-speak, the word
itself is rooted in tradition. Earlier in
their history — when fraternities were
far more secretive — the process was
called tapping. A brother would ap
proach a potential new member in pri
vate, tap him in the shoulder, and offer
him an invitation.
As fraternities became more open,
so did new member recruitment. Hie
term rush emerged in the 1870s: At the
start of the school year, when the trains
pulled into the station, fraternities
would "rush" to meet the new fresh
men. While helping to carry their bags
— the equivalent of a Sigma Nu Super
Shuttle — the brothers would mark the
freshmen they wanted. If a young man

had been pinned with the colors of a
certain fraternity, he was off-limits to all
others.
A Mutual Selection Process
With our knack for abbreviations
here at Stanford, it's surprising that this
mouthful of a phrase still hasn't been
shortened. During recruitment, rushees
will hear this term at least a dozen times.
Recruitment, the word maintains, works
both ways: Both the fraternity and its
rushees are just trying to find other peo
ple with whom they'll feel comfortable.
Yet. no matter how many times they
hear it. not a single rushee — from the
heartbroken Theta Delt reject to the
most enthusiastic new Pi Phi —truly
believes it. "When they say 'mutual se
lection process."' a Kappa pledge told
me."it's like when a college says they're
looking for students who will be a 'good
fit.'" Expect to hear this term thrown
around with a good deal of sarcasm

and/or bitterness.
The Draw
The Draw, as most know, gets its
name from the paper slips students
used to "draw" in the old housing lot
tery. No one is quite sure just when this
single-syllable word became capitalized
so ominously.
Draw-ma
This Stanford-ism perfectly captures
the destruction of freshmen friendships
by the clique-forming mandated by the
Draw. Though it describes a serious
issue, the word itself is still lightly
mocking in its tone. Draw-ma entails
pettiness and tears, and it can leave
freshmen feeling isolated and hurt after
an otherwise amazing year. Softly jab
bing at the silliness of our housing fears,
the term offers a gentle reality slap. It
reassures us that it's no big deal, that
we'll maintain our old friends and that,
wherever we might end up — Roble or
Bob, EBF or (God help you) Roth —
we'll make new ones along the way, too.

Marissa pledged an unhoused sorority
and is drawing with all of her roommates.
They plan to get a draw number of 5 and
live in Hob. Contact her at maris
