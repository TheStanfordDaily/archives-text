# Using Mosquitos to Fight Malaria
## 
### RACHEL WHELAN 
Man-made mosquitoes that
are resistant to malaria have
an evolutionary advantage
over wild-type mosquitoes.
Using this, researchers have
engineered mosquitoes in the laboratory
that may soon be used to prevent the spread
of malaria in the countries that need it most.
Plasmodium, the parasite responsible for
malaria, needs two hosts to complete its life
cycle: a female Anopholes mosquito and a
vertebrate. Parasites enter a mosquito's
body when the insect drinks infected blood,
before moving to the mosquito's gut and
forming a cyst. When this cyst bursts, spores
are sent to the insect's salivary glands. When
the mosquito bites its next vertebrate, it will
leave the parasite behind-thereby spreading
malaria in a population.
So what gives malaria-resistant Anop
holes their advantage?
" Fhere's a fitness cost to being infected."
parasitologist Hillary Hurd explained to
MlT's Technology Review.
Infection by Plasmodium parasites im
pairs Anopholes' fertility. But previous ef
forts to make mosquitoes malaria-resistant
overtaxed their immune system, imposing
another fitness cost. In March, Johns Hop
kins professor Dr. Mauro Marrelli discov
ered a new method that promotes malaria
resistance while maintaining the evolution
ary advantage of resistance.

Dr. Marrelli and colleagues looked at
SMI. a small protein that keeps the parasite
from infecting the mosquito in the first
place.The SMI protein blocks the parasite's
access to the mosquito's gut so that the
mosquito's immune system never has to be
activated.
Dr. Marrelli and colleagues created ge
netically modified (GM) mosquitoes by in
serting into their genomes one copy of the
SMI gene. But in tracking the mosquito
population over several generations, it

would be difficult to identify which in
sects had been successfully modified-so

he inserted another gene to make

the modified mosquitoes' eyes

glow green

But would
Marrelli's gene
work?

To establish
malaria-resist-

ant mosquitoes
in the wild. Marel

li would need to at

least show that they

outcompeted normal

mosquitoes in the lab. And by

the ninth generation of his ex

periment. 70 percent of the mosqui-

toes carried the SMI gene versus 50 per

cent at the start of the experiment-demon
strating a clear evolutionary advantage.

Unfortunately, the SMI prevalence rate
in the population never climbed above 70
percent — most likely because getting
copies of the gene from both parents hurts
Anapholes' fit-

ness.
So is this the last we'll see of malaria?
"We're not anywhere near a field release
[of GM mosquitoes]," stated Jason Rasgon,
one of the researchers who worked on the
study, to the Associated Press.

Most importantly, the Plasmodium
parasite studied by Dr. Marrelli and his
team causes malaria in mice, not hu
mans. The next task for the researchers,
then, will he to create a mosquito re
sistant to human malaria.

In addition, outside of the labora
tory. the malaria-resistant mosqui-

toes" advan
tage is not

so signifi
cant. Only
a small pro
portion of
wild mosqui-

toes become
infected with

malaria; to suc-

ceed, GM mos
quitoes would

have to have an ad-

vantage over wild-type

mosquitoes even when
not exposed to malarial par-

asites.

And even if malaria-resistant mos
quitoes did become dominant, it's possible

parasites would evolve to overcome SMI, as
they have with many anti-malaria drugs and
insecticides. Ultimately, the researchers
project that it will he at least another 10
years before we see GM mosquitoes in the
wild.
Computer models propose that malaria
resistant mosquitoes would have to com
pletely wipe out a native wild-type mosquito
population in order to prevent the spread of
the disease. But once GM mosquitoes be
came established in a region, it would be
much more challenging for the parasite to
reappear there. The best solution for pre
venting the spread of malaria would be to
combine the introduction of GM mosqui
toes with other drugs, insecticides and vac
cines.
Every year, malaria is responsible for 300
million cases of illness and one million
deaths. The majority of malaria cases —90
percent are in sub-Saharan Africa, and the
vast majority of victims are children. There is
currently no vaccine for the disease and
most treatments are too expensive for peo
ple living in poor communities to obtain.The
work of Dr. Marrelli and his colleagues in
engineering malaria-resistant mosquitoes is
a promising first step towards ending this
devastating disease.
