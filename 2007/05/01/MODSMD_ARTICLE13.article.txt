# Brainy computing

### VAUGHAN MEYER 
ITie future of technology has been
found. Recent winner of the N1H Pio
neer award and bioengineering profes
sor Kwabena Boahen lias plans to rev
olutionize computer technology by
simulating the human brain. But he has
more than just plans; he has the will
and intelligence to make those plans
reality.
Born in the West African country of
Ghana. Boahen took his apart most of
the things in his house to try and satis
fy his innate curiosity. His first comput
er posed a problem — the need to un
ravel its puzzles nagged him incessant
ly, yet he was unwilling to risk taking it
apart. So he read and researched until
he figured out how it worked. And he
ended up "disgusted" by its inelegance.
Boahen continued his exploration
as an undergrad at John Hopkins Uni
versity. where he studied electrical en
gineering. There he started to learn
about the brain's functions and how it
stores information in neuron models.
In the brain. Boahen found the effi
ciency and elegance that he thought all
computers lacked. This discovery in
stilled a passion in Boahen to try and
make computers and electronics de
signed on biological systems.
Boahen went on to study Computa
tion and Neural Systems at CalTech,
which brought together students of bi
ology. engineering, math, and neuro
science in order to expose them to a
number of different disciplines. Boa
hen expressed his great faith in this
form of interdisciplinary study, noting

how "all the interesting stuff [happens]
at the interfaces" of the disciplines.
After eight years on the University
of Pennsylvania's bioengineering fac
ulty. this interest in interdisciplinary
and multidisciplinary study attracted
Boahen to Stanford and to the Clark
Center. I le lauded the Clark Center for
being "so big...so cutting edge" and
praised the new bioengineering de
partment specifically..
At the Clark Center. Boahen has
continued his working on designing a
computer that operates on the same
principles of the human brain. Ik
noted how most modern computers
operate on a 'brute-force approach'
that is not fulfilling all of our techno
logical needs, especially considering
current transistor problems. But by ac
cessing the extremely efficient design
of the human brain. Boahen hopes to
bypass these problems as well as accu
rately simulate how the brain works.
He recently won the very prestigious
NIH Pioneer Award for his work,
which will provide him and his team
with $4 million over five years to con
tinue their research.
Boahen described his life and his
work with a calm and precise manner
of speaking. He likes to laugh and did
so often during his interview with The
Daily. His voice quickens with excite
ment and passion when he starts talk
ing about his research. Talking to him.
you feel that no matter how many
questions you ask him. you will always
only sit on the shore of his ocean of
knowledge and curiosity.
Remarkably, Boahen mentioned

that he finds memorization difficult,
though he is very good at learning how
to do things. I lowever, he has never let
this inability hamper him. Instead,
when he needs to learn something in a
foreign discipline, such as when he
started study biology, he immerses
himself in it. He compared learning
that discipline's vocabulary to "learn
ing a [foreign] language." Iliis type of
study is not "formal," Boahen said, so
much as simply a manner of letting the
knowledge and jargon soak into one's
skin.
Toward the end of the interview,
Boahen emphasized understanding
the nature of problem solving as inte
gral to any form of successor discovery.
He said most people "don't think
about fundamental problems," but
rather that they only deal with those
problems' offshoots. Boahen said that
"if you think about the fundamental
problems and accept them" one can
make concrete, significant innovations,
not just in one's work, but also in one's
personal life.
When asked for some final words of
wisdom. Boahen offered two some
what paradoxical responses. He noted
that he has spent his life following his
'own unique path.' and then delineated
how that path has inadvertently
echoed paths of those whose came be
fore him. most notably his father's.
But. more than anything else. Boa
hen believes, "The passion has to come
first."
