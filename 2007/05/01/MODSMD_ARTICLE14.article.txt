## Editorial Board Reform the priority system 
### 
This week, many students are eagerly
awaiting to find out whether they got
their priority preferences. Priority ap
plications, due last Friday, range from short
essays on particular house themes to lan
guage requirements and house visits. Yet,
for many, priority becomes a way for stu
dents to game the system and secure desir
able housing with an otherwise undesirable
draw number.
The priority system is intended as a way
for students with particular interests to ex
press them within the residential education
system. A student with a strong interest in
French, for example, would be given the op
portunity to explore both language and cul
ture in La Maison Francaise. Similarly,
through priority, a student interested in
Asian-American identity and heritage
would be given the chance to engage with
these topics in a residential setting by living
in Okada.
Certain residences, like the Italian lan
guage-themed house, La Casa ltaliana,
should be commended for having legitimate
priority requirements, such as a year of lan
guage. Other dorms like Lantana and Kim
ball should be praised for emphasizing out
of-dorm-events in lieu of routine presenta

tions.
Needless to say, certain Stanford stu
dents will be deeply committed to their res
idence's theme and will attend related dorm
events. These people make the best priority
residents. I lowever. with bare bones priori
ty application requirements, many students
will dash off a 200-word essay or tour a
house and then will forget about being a pri
ority resident for the rest of the year. This is
sadly the case in many dorms and houses
across campus.
Stricter standards and greater account
ability among priority residents should be
instituted across the board. Because it's
impossible to kick someone out of hous
ing once they've been accepted, this ac
countability must take the form of more
intensive priority applications and re
quirements to separate those with legiti
mate interests in a theme from those stu
dents who are simply trying to secure
good housing.
Priority should not exist as a vehicle for
students to "beat the system" during their
unpreferred year. We hope that in the future
the priority system gets revamped, and
those students with actual interest in the
residence theme fairly earn their spot.
