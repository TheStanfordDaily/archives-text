# Fog over the water
## 
### 
Lake Lag was a real lake in the winter
of 2005. It was not very deep. You
could walk straight through it, if you
didn't mind taking a disinfectant shower or
suffering mutant syphilis. The water was
dirty, but from the porch of Lambda Nu
(before it was Jerry), all you could see was
a wide expanse of sky blue. It didn't look
very shallow from up there. You could grab
a lawn chair and set it out on the tiny half
dirt beach and open a good novel and
imagine you were anywhere but Stanford.
And in the evenings the lights outside of
Roble and Suites would reflect dark-or
ange off the surface of the lake, and the
world felt still.
Everybody always misses freshman
year. Part summer camp, part booze
cruise.part dormcest that feels so right
until it turns out so wrong, freshman year
looks innocent in hindsight: carefree, de
void of responsibility, bursting with possi
bility. Staring forward toward the best
years of our lives. In the all-frosh dorms
there was a vivid sense of living a great ad
venture, a new discovery around every cor
ner. another Row house throwing a party
(back when they threw parties), another
classroom, another fountain hop. Sopho
more year feels like waking up from a
beautiful dream to find that it's Sunday af
ternoon, you're still drunk with an arriving
hangover, you lost your keys and your left
shoe and your girlfriend's leaving you for
your grandfather. It feels backwards, direc
tionless, even empty. It feels desperately
close to real life.
But 1 loved my sophomore slump. It was
a weird and static year, full of long lazy
Futon days watching "King of the Hill,"
playing "Perfect Dark "on my old N64, fill
ing and emptying my Netflix queue (Now.
I barely ever watch movies that aren't re
quired). In the fall. 1 went jogging every
day, and in the evenings my roommate and
I went to the gym. I was going to the gym
six days a week.Then 1 got mono and spent
winter quarter beating San Andreas.
Sometimes I think I still have mono. That
would explain a lot.
I think what I miss most about that year
is the indecisiveness. 1 took the Film Soci
ety's Beginning Film Workshop, had a plan
for a long film that went nowhere. My
friend and 1 wanted to start a TV show. We
held auditions, no one came, school hap
pened. I finished off a year of Italian with a
pass-fail whimper, missing at least half the
last quarter, and then decided to go to
Berlin. I tried and failed to read "Mason &
Dixon." I flirted with a girl and could've
sworn we were together until we weren't.
I'm positive it's my fault, but I don't re
member why. I didn't do anything really
substantive that whole year. Except for
"Visions of the 1%05."
"Visions" was an introductory seminar,
the only time I ever dipped a toe into the
American studies kiddie pool. I took a lot
of IntroSems back in the day. They were
more interesting lectures, they satisfied a
bunch of GERs and they were full of cute
girls. On the first day of class, we had to ex
plain why we were interested in the '60s. I
said I wished I could have been alive in the
'60s. I didn't know shit about the,'6os. I can
remember Professor Gillam smiling a little

and nodding his head, probably thinking,
"Oh. this one is going to turn very cynical
very fast."
That class did turn me cynical, a little.
When you study the "60s. it's hard not to
come to the conclusion that pretty much
everyone was full of bullshit: the LSD
prophets, the naive idealists turning into
idiot rebels, the tottering liberals, the glut
tonous conservatives, the soldiers with ear
necklaces and the generals who gave them
medals. Before that class. I thought "Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas" was a fun book.
Now. I realize it's just an after-the-fact
tragedy, notes from the hell the '60s created:
the 70s.
1 remember when someone told me
that Hunter S.Thompson died in February
of sophomore year. That was the end of
youth, especially so soon after the elec
tion. For a few months all we ever talked
about at LBF was how we couldn't believe
it and how awful Bush was and how much
we all missed the '90s. After awhile it got
depressing and 1 stopped talking about
politics.
In the winter,the rain poured and the
Lake swelled. The winter nights were the
best. We bought a couple of inflatable
rafts, the cheap gray ones on the shelf at
Wal-Mart. We named them Duke and
Gonzo. It was best at night. You could go
out on the lake with a couple paddles and
a picnic basket full of cookies, chips,
beer. pot. Out there it was international
waters. "What are the cops going to do,"
we would say, "swim out and get us?"
And we floated along in the middle of a
five-foot lake, sipping a Miller Lite, three
of us crammed into Duke, watching the
light fog run over the surface of the
water.
