# The 						untold benefits of a full Lake Lag...
## It's corny, but it has to be said 
### 
Like all useful things, corn can be used
for both good and evil. Good ways in
which corn can be used include pop
corn. corn bread, corn on the cob and corn
starch biodegradable utensils. Evil ways in
which corn can be used include Cracker
Jacks, corn dogs and corn-based ethanol fuel.
At this moment, this alternative fuel is
being used for evil in the United States. Pres
ident Bush's State of the Union called for a
20 percent reduction in gasoline usage within
the next 10 years. Many Bush-ites have tout
ed ethanol-based fuel, popularly known as
EB5 because it contains 85 percent ethanol
and 15 percent gasoline, as the magical alter
native fuel that will simultaneously reduce
America's gasoline usage and its dependence
on Middle Eastern oil.
EB5 holds strong appeal, the sort of which
1 recently saw played out in a TV commercial
for an American company manufacturing
EB5. rhe commercial featured long pan-shots
of lush corn fields flourishing under blue,
smog-free skies. There were also shots of
beefy red pickups speeding confidently along
country roads and equally beefy ail-Ameri
can farmers standing in their ail-American
cornfields, promoting a fuel grown At I lonie.
Despite all the down-home appeal of a
fuel we can make ourselves, the case for
ethanol as a viable alternative fuel is tenuous
at best. A study done by Cornell Ecology
Prof. David Pimentel claims that the net
greenhouse gas output of ethanol (taking
into account the greenhouse gasses expend
ed in the growing and transportation of corn,
the distillation of ethanol, etc.) is actually
greater than that of gasoline, tragically, we
cannot just stuff ears of corn into the gas
tanks of our cars.
Pimentel's claim is, of course, contrary to
the information put out by the Bush adminis
tration's Department of Energy.This is. how
ever. the same administration that has. until
quite recently, promoted the "global warming
is just a theory, and maybe there are fairies in
the garden if you really believe" school of
thought, so I 'm hesitant to believe what the 1)
of E has to say on this matter. Regardless, I'd

like to sec it played out in a scientific way that
will hopefully resolve the "contested" status
of Wikipedia's article on EB5.
As though contributing to global warming
wasn't bad enough, a recent study by Stan
ford Civil and Environmental Engineering
Prof. Mark Jacobson found that expanded
use of the EB5 will actually increase smog-re
lated deaths in America. Well.'lTiat's depress
ing. But at least we have the Prius and other
hybrid vehicles to fall back on. We know they
expel smaller amounts of greenhouse gasses
than do normal gasoline-powered engines.
So why not invest all our time and energy
into hybrids?
Looking back on the EB5 commercial, I
couldn't help but think that the image of the
farmer in the field carried an unmistakable
message, perhaps one that illuminates the
reason for EBs's widespread appeal. What the
commercial seems to say is this: Not only will
EB5 reduce America's gasoline consumption
(aka reliance on those unreliable Middle
Eastern folk), but it will give work to our na
tion's noble farmers. So essentially, EB5
promises a nice sendup for the terrorists and
a boost to the American economy. Maybe
corn fields will be out next Silicon Valley. A
return to the wealth of the IWOs. I looray!
In comparison, it's easy to see how hybrid
vehicles such as the Prius seem unsexy to
America at large. For one. the top manufactur
er of hybrid vehicles sold in America is ... a
Japanese company. I'oyota recently climbed
the ranks of the auto industry and is now at
number one. beating out such good-old
manly-American-truck-companies as I ord
and GM. So. more hybrid vehicles looks like
more business for the Japanese and fewer jobs

for the Americans. 800. Unless, of course, the
United States starts making a bigger play in
the hybrid industry, but even that scenario is
unsavory. It lacks the job-creating promise of
EB5. and it seems that's what America is most
concerned with at the moment. More jobs.
When faced with choosing between an ex
panded American job market and the preser
vation of the polar caps. I'm inclined to
choose the polar caps. Although 1 guess if we
were to allow them to melt, that would create
still more jobs. Think of all the rescue work
ers and relocation staff who would be need
ed to address the larger-than-Katrina-sized
flooding of the coasts! See. global warming
creates jobs. So let's go ahead and burn that
American corn. You know. 1 hate to sound
apocalyptic, but with California taking the
desperate measure of planning to cut its
greenhouse gas emissions by SO percent by
2050. it's no stretch to say that we're living in
extreme, if not apocalyptic, times.
Right now (not soon, but now), we Amer
icans have to make hard choices. Now and in
the immediate future, we're going to be faced
with difficult decisions such as this one: jobs
or polar ice caps? Commercial cutbacks or
species extinction? Essentially, this genera
tion. or the ones to come? Promoters of EB5
and other dubious alternative fuels seem to
think that climate change can be combated
easily through a series of profitable econom
ic decisions. But like most easy answers. EB5
is a lot more complicated than it's cracked up
to be. It isn't a lasting solution,or even a solu
tion at all. At some point, we will have to tem
per America's economic growth in order to
decrease our greenhouse gas output.
Making what 1 believe to be the right
choice in these scenarios will be neither easy
nor without cost, but I do believe there is a
right choice. In thiscase.it involves recogniz
ing that the crops grown in the heartland may
be the next step towards the degradation of
the heartland. In short, we must not use corn
for evil.
