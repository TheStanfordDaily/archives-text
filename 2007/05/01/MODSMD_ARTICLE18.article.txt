# Letter to the Editor
## Give credit to sustainability efforts 
### 
We arc writing in response to Ruth Mc-
Cann's April 24 column regarding the re
cently concluded Energy Bowl and Water
Derby. We applaud her efforts as the "Queen
of Green" to champion sustainable causes
among Stanford students.
We agree with the author that publicity
and participation can be improved.and we are
committed to working with Students for a
Sustainable Stanford to help achieve that next
year. We also hope that The Daily will provide
better coverage of the contest in the future.
Though McCann offers some valid criti

eismsofthe Hnergy Bowl.wedonot want her
chastisement of the contest sponsors and
participants to detract from the real success
of the event. Overall, energy consumption
was reduced by 7 percent across all under
graduate residences which is a significant
achievement, especially given that last year's
base was down 10 percent in energy and
water usage from the previous year. We con
gratulate the contest winners. Kimball and
Jenkins (it's in the (iovernor's Corner Suites,
Ruth) for their V percent savings in the dor
mitory category and Columbac and Grove
Lasuen for their 26 percent savings in the
house category.

We also want the Stanford community to
be aware of another recent conservation
achievement that has not received Daily cov
erage. Stanford took high honors in two cate
gories in RecvcleMania.a national contest of
over 2(H) colleges and universities. Stanford
placed second in the "Gorilla Prize" category
which recognizes the school that recycles the
highest gross tonnage of materials during the
10-week competition. Stanford placed third
in "Targeted Materials-Paper" which recog
nizes paper recycling. Contest results are
posted at www.recyclenianiacs.org.
ITiough we can all continue to improve
our sustainabilitv efforts, students and the

entire Stanford community should he proud
of these conservation achievements. For its
part. Student I lousing is strongly committed
to implementing politics and practices that
preserve natural resources and reduce the
overall impact of Stanford residences on the
environment.
