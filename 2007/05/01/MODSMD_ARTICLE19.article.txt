## Bruch defends singles title Sophomores Matt Bruch, Blake Muller also win Pac-10 doubles 
### ELIZABETH PRATT 
Sophomore Matt Bruch may be outside the
top 125 in the national collegiate tennis rank
ings, but his opponents in last weekend's Pacif
ic-10 Conference Individual Championships
might have guessed otherwise.
At the 1071h tournament in Ojai. Calif.,
Bruch mowed down the field in the men's sin
gles championship competition, winning the
title without dropping a single set in his five
matches. Plagued by multiple injuries this sea
son, the sophomore found his title-winning
form at the championships and successfully de
fended his 2006 Pac-10 singles championship.
In doing so, Bruch won the Cardinal (8-16.2-5
Pac-10) its fourth straight conference singles
championship.
On his road to the title, Bruch eliminated
Arizona's Peter Zimmer. Washington's Andy
Kuharszky, Southern California's No. 67 kaes
Van't Hof, California's No. 30 Pierre Mouillon
and Washington's No. 87 Alex Slovic. Mouillon
had defeated him in dual-match play earlier
this season, but Bruch got his revenge in the
semifinals, taking out the Cal junior, 6-4,6-2.
"Matt did a great job," assistant coach David
I lodge said. "I was really proud of how the guys
pulled together as a team. too.They all fought
hard and competed hard."
Stanford fielded four players in the men's
singles championship; sophomore Blake
Muller, senior Eric McKean and No. 77 fresh
man Richard Wire all fell in the first round of
play. Freshman Paul Morrissey, sophomore Jeff
Zeller and senior David Ryan were entered in
the invitational singles competition. Zeller lost
in the first round, while Morrissey advanced to

the second round before dropping a 7-6 (6),6-3
contest to USC's Adam Loucks. Ryan won two
matches to reach the quarterfinals, but was
eliminated by eventual invitational champion
Jason McNaughton of USC.6-4.6-1.
Bruch s outstanding play was not limited to
singles competition, as he and Muller (the No.
12-ranked doubles tandem in the country)
rolled through the doubles championship
bracket and clinched the 2007 Pac-10 men's
doubles title with a 6-2,6-4 victory over USC's
Van't Hof and Robert Farah.
On their way to fulfilling head coach John
Whit lingers prediction that they would be "a
threat to win this tournament," the Stanford
duo also took out Arizona's Jason l.abrosse
and Peter Zimmer, Arizona State's Matt
Brooklyn and Wes Miller and UCLA's Math
ieu Dehaine and Jeremy Drean.
Dehaine and Drean were the defending
Pac-10 doubles champions, but Bruch and
Muller knocked them out with a solid, 8-5 tri

umph.
"Blake and Matt played really solid,"
Hodge said. "They set each other up well, and
they're getting better and better. They'll be a
tough team to beat at the NCAAs."
Because of their strong play and high rank
ing throughout the season. Bruch and Muller
will very likely be given a bid to play in the
NCAA men's doubles championship, hosted
by the University of Georgia, starting on May
17. The bracket will be released this Wednes
day. and the duo will look to continue their
title-winning form in Georgia and end the sea
son on a high note.
Wire and Morrissey also qualified as a team
for the doubles championship contest, but they
suffered a first-round loss to Arizona's Bruno
Alcala and Ravid Hazi,B-5.
In the invitational doubles competition,
Zeller teamed with UCLA's Andrew Hklov to
