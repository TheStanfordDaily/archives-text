## A 						new way to dispose of waste Compostable program in Tresidder and Lake House joins Toyon test effort 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
When compostable plates, clam shells, salad contain
ers and utensils were introduced at Tresidder's Union
Square Cafe on Friday, diners joined in a campus-wide ef
fort aimed at reducing food-related waste.
Dawn Kwan '09 and Dayoung Lee '09, lead organizers
of the project,spent Friday coordinating a team of volun
teers to help teach diners how to properly sort out com
postable material from trash.The volunteers, nicknamed
Fellow-Biocompostable Inspectors (FBI), wore green
clothing and guarded trash bins to keep out contami
nants.
"We're just helping out mainly with education of the
Stanford community to get in the habit of composting
properly," Lee said. "Setting up the system is not enough
it's only one part of the equation. A very important
part is getting people to adapt to this change effectively."
"Our main issue is [the program] has to be sustain
able," Kwan said. "When we had the volunteers there,
there was no problem of contamination."
She added that people were excited about the project
but unsure of exactly which materials were compostable.
Kwan said people often throw in creamers and soy sauce
packages, even though they are not actually biocom
postable.
"A major problem with composting is contamina
tion," Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS) member
Aluma Dembo '09 said in an email to The Daily. "One
plastic plate would cause the entire dumpster to be
thrown out."
The compostable service ware is made of unique,
biodegradable materials. The plates and clam shells are

made of sugar cane fiber extract, the utensils of potato
starch and the clear salad boxes and yogurt cups of corn
starch. ITiough the cost increases associated with using
these products is significant, Stanford Dining has not
raised its prices, Lee said.
"There are stickers on the dishware that say whether
it's compostable or not." she added. "A lot of things look
like plastic. If you're not sure, just put it in the trash for
now."
Dembo is also a lead student organizer for Row house
composting efforts.
"Composting in the Row house kitchens began this
winter with a pilot program in the Cowell Cluster: Terra,
ZAPTri Delt, Pi Phi and Kappa Alpha Theta," she said.
"It seems to have been a pretty big success, since they've
recently rolled out the second phase to the Lake houses:
Narnia, LBF, KA and Jerry."
Dembo also cited theToyon Eating Clubs as an exam
ple of a composting success story on campus.

Signs in Tresidder Union inform students about the new
composting program that was implemented last week in
Union Square Cafe, the CoHo, Olives and Alumni Cafe.
"At Toyon they managed to reduce their land
fill by about two-thirds its original amount," she
said. "Considering recent findings on the lack of
degradation within landfills, it's really great to get
as much out of them as possible."
Lizzie Suiter '07. kitchen manager at Jerry, said
the transition from dumping to composting has
been smooth and Dembo said student reaction to
the composting project has been largely positive.
"Personally I think it was a really easy transi
tion to [composting],"she said. "It doesn't smell. It
gets taken out every day. It is easily accessible for

students on the weekend. [The residents] don't
seem to notice the change, hut there is one. The
trash that we take out now has decreased signifi
cantly."
"I think that students have adopted really well to
the composting program," Dembo added, "as they
should, since it really is not that difficult of a con
cept. Instead of scraping your plate into the trash,
scrape it into the compost, two inches to the left."
Kwan and Lee said they plan to measure the
contamination in Iresidder compost bins in the
next few days. FBI members will be working
through the end of the week and large, instructive
neon signs have been posted near trash and com
post bins to help diners sort out the biodegradable
material from the garbage.
