# Lacrosse team lets Terriers rip out win
## Card can't match BU's second half surge 
### SARA LANNIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
rhe regular season came to a less-than-stellar close for
the Stanford women's lacrosse team this past weekend.
After traveling to the East Coast for a non-conference
match against No. 20 Boston University, the Cardinal came
up short against the Terriers' second-half scoring streak, los
ing 12-9.The trip left Stanford with a 6-8 final season record.
Hie victory over the Cardinal was the seventh straight
for BU. which ended its season 11-5. Before beating Stan
tord.the Terriers were fresh off a victory over University of
New I lampshire and an upset of No. 18 Dartmouth. Boston
currently ranks second in the America East Conference,
trailing behind Stony Brook. Also. BU freshman Traci

Landy had earned
the America East
Conference's
Rookie of the
Week honor for the
second time in
three weeks, thanks
to the seven goals
and five ground
balls she con
tributed in the
games against
Dartmouth and
Stanford.
The first half of
Sunday's game saw
back-and-forth ac
tion from both
teams. Boston initi
ated the scoring
with a goal by fresh
man Mckinley
Curro's only two
minutes into the
game. Stanford's
junior attacker
Daphne Patterson
was quick to retali
ate, however,
pulling off two con
secutive goals to

put Stanford up 2-I.The lead was short lived, as Curro and
one of her teammates answered with two goals of their own
to push the score to 3-2.
Patterson contributed another score to tie the game at 3-
3, only to see the Terriers whip two more halls past junior
goalkeeper Laura Shane. With only 2:55 left in the half, the
C ardinal defense managed to hold the Terriers at bay, giving
the Cardinal offense the protection it needed. Sophomore
midfielder Jamie Nesbitt notched her first and onlv point of
the game, while junior midfielder Megan McClain's goal
with only five seconds before the whistle blew brought Stan-

GAME NOTE) The Cardinal women were
able to keep pace with the No. 20 Terriers
for the first half of play, as the contest went
into the break with the score knotted at five
apiece. Despite allowing the Cardinal to
take a brief lead early in the second half, BU
eventually pulled away to claim the win. Ju
nior Daphne Patterson paced the Cardinal
offensive with three goals on the day, while

contest. The Stanford women next play in the

The Cardinal opened the scoring
in the second half with a beautiful as
sist from Patterson to freshman at
tack Dana Lindsay, which ended in a
goal to push the score to6-s.Unfortu
nately, the lead would be Stanford's
last for the day, as the Cardinal were
not prepared for the maelstrom the
BU women proceeded to unleash.
For the next 18 minutes the Terri
ers held Stanford scoreless as they
ruthlessly ripped six goals past Shane.
Three goals were courtesy of sopho
more Sarah Dalton, while two were
contributed by Landy. Dalton led the
scoring for BU with a total of six
points over the course of the game.
With just under nine minutes left in
the game, Boston had taken a deci
sive 11 -6 lead.
Despite being down by five, the-
Cardinal women fought valiantly
until the end. A second goal by Mc-
Clain, paired with a score by sopho
more midfielder Bess Siegfried, start
ed the Cardinal on the road to a
comeback, but Dalton s fifth goal of
the match-up signaled the end lor
Stanford's hopes. Cardinal freshman
midfielder Leigh Lucas's free posi
tion goal was the last goal of the game,
putting the final score at 12-9. Goal
tender Shane had eight saves in goal
for the Cardinal, while BU's Jenna
Golden recorded seven. Stanford
also edged out the Terriers 12-11 in
draws and ground balls.
Now back from the East C oast,
the Stanford women have work to do
for the rest of the week. On ITiursday,
the Cardinal will begin the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. for which they are currently
seeded third, behind Denver and
Oregon. The women's first game of
the tournament will be against St.
Mary's, which is currently the lowest
ranked team in the MPSF.
