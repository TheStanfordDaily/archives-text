In the days running up to the highly anticipated
Pacific-10 Conference Championships, the Car
dinal team had an action-packed weekend with
two track meets — one across the Bay in Berke
ley and one on its home turf at Cobb Track and
Angell Field.

Sunday proved the most exciting with
the Stanford-hosted Payton Jordan Cardinal

Invitational. In a hyped-up competi-

tion featuring world-class athletes

from Kenya, Australia and Mexi
co. the Cardinal held its own to

post seven first-place finishes.
Amonn the men's field events,

junior Graeme I loste recorded
the top mark in the pole vault

(5.20 meters). Redshirt junior

throw mark bv 0.13 meters to

56.29 meters, good enough
for second. Redshirt junior

Michael Macellari was
able to take first in the

shot put with a mark of
17.14 meters. Senior

Michael Robertson fin
ished with a mark of

59.10 meters in the
discus throw, which

was good enough to
garner him first place

even though it was
0.81 meters shorter

than his mark at the Cal-

ifornia Collegiate Chal-

lenge on Friday.
On the track, freshman Daniel Belchclockedin

completed a sensational run with his 3:41.51 time,
which puts him in 10th in Stanford's record books.

In the women's field events, junior Danielle Maier

ners, senior Ashley Freeman ran a speedy time of 2:07.14
in the 800 meters, good enough for a NCAA Regional
qualifying time.
For the men's team, Macellari won third in the shot put

the fact that the mark put him ninth in Stanford's record

al competitors, the Payton Jordan Cardinal
Invitational seemed to bring out the best
from the Stanford men and women on Sun

squad claimed seven first-place finishes
while also hitting eight NCAA Regional
Qualifying marks Cobb Track and Angell

Two days before the Cardinal Invitational, Stanford

their regional marks."

heaved the javelin 47.21 meters to win first place, while
sophomore Michaela Wallcrstedt finished third in the shot

For the men's team, Macellari won third in the shot put
with his season-best and NCAA Regional-qualifying
mark of 17.39 meters — more remarkable, however, was
the fact that the mark put him ninth in Stanford's record

al record." according to Floreal.

57.51 meters.

weekend." Floreal said. "The combi

the athletes found a way to do well. We
had some awesome performances."

to prepare this week for the Pac-10
