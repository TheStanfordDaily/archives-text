# Men's water polo rules the pool over women's swim
## Teams compete for first time in aquatic battle of the sexes 
### THE DAILY SPORTS STAFF 
Little more than bragging rights were at
stake when the men's water polo team
outswam the women's swim team during an in
house Friday meet.
But pride can be as important as a win or
loss to some.

The two teams, who often practice around
the same time and sometimes in the same pool,
have been heckling each other for weeks
about who might win the battle of the sexes.
Following the schedule of a traditional high
school swim meet — many of the men's water
polo players swam earlier in their careers, while
some of the women swimmers themselves
played water polo — the men and women bat
tled it out in sprints and relays.
Neither team is in season or fully condi
tioned. but both sides were confident they
could beat the other. Facebook invitations

went out and about a hundred people came on
a sunny Friday afternoon.
The women won the 200 freestyle,2oo indi
vidual medley, 500 freestyle and 100 breast
stroke. The men won everything else, taking
first, second and third in the 50 freestyle and
the 100 freestyle. The men also took first and
second in the sprint relays.
"1 wasn't really focusing on whether we won
or lost." redshirt freshman Ryan McCarthy
said. "It was great to get the aquatics teams to
gether. We're always in the pool by ourselves. It
was a friendly rivalry between us."

Even alums turned out for the first-ever
duel. Unstoppable sister combo Tara Kirk '04
and Dana Kirk '06, both Olympians, suited up
for the Cardinal women.
"Next year, we'll beat 'em in the longer
course events," said sophomore Laura Wad
den. who competed in the 500 freestyle and
joked that the men's strokes were not quite up
to par.
With the success of Friday's first-ever meet,
the men's swim team will play the women's
water polo team after the women compete in
the NCAA tournament this coming month.

Both the men's water polo team and the women's swimming team talked the talk heading into their swim meet showdown on Friday afternoon, but it was ultimately the men who walked the walk.
The water polo squad capitalized on its quickness in short distances to emerge victorious from the high-school-formatted swim meet.
