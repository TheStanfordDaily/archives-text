# BOSP to open in Madrid
## Starting in the fall, students will finally be able to study abroad in Spain 
### GEORGINA BLACKETT 
Four years after the Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP) an
nounced the possibility of launch
ing a program in Spain. Mexico or
India, one of the three has finally
become a reality. On Friday. BOSP
announced the long-awaited open
ing of a new program in Madrid.
Spain's capital city.
"Substantial numbers of Stan
ford students study in Spain now
with other universities," BOSP Di
rector Norman Naimark said in an
email to The Daily. "[The Madrid
program is for] those many students
who asked us for one."
The program will be open to stu
dents beginning next winter. Appli

cations will be available starting
today and will be clue May 25. The
Madrid program will operate in au
tumn. winter and spring quarters
starting academic year 2008-2009.
University Spanish faculty and
members of the Madrid academic
community will teach the program's
courses. All classes will be taught
primarily in Spanish and will offer
academic credit from appropriate
Stanford departments, in addition
to fulfilling various General Educa
tion Requirements (GERs). Re
quired Spanish courses will also be
offered at different levels to accom
modate students' varying degrees
of language proficiency.
The program — which man
dates satisfactory completion of the

University's first-year Spanish cur
riculum or equivalent proficiency
for enrollees — "will offer courses
in Iberian Studies, political science,
economics, history, Spanish lan
guage and literature, among other
fields." BOSP Outreach and Stu
dent Relations Manager David
John Boyer said in a release last
week.
"The courses given in Spain will
undoubtedly be located primarily in
the social sciences and humanities,"
Naimark said."but we have also had
success in other programs teaching
courses in Humßio and other sci
ence and engineering disciplines."
Science and engineering stu
dents hope the program will be more
"techie' -friendly than other BOSP
programs. Due to the high number
of classes required for many science
and engineering majors, "techies"
often do not have time to study
abroad.
"I always wanted to study abroad
in Europe," said engineering student
Mario Madrigal '09. "But with prod
uct design. I just can't fit in any lan
guage classes and so can't make the
language requirement."
"Since I already speak Spanish
fluently. I think Madrid will be per
fect," he said. "I just hope they offer
art classes so I can fulfill that part of
my major while abroad."
Unlike other overseas centers,
the Madrid program will not be
housed in a Stanford-run complex.
Instead, the program will be located

at the International Institute in
Madrid. While there, students will he
able to participate in a voluntary' lan
guage partner program; they will
also have access to the Institute's
vast library collections and will be
able to participate in all of the Insti
tute's events.
While Naimark acknowledged
the possibility of moving the pro
gram to a Stanford-run center in the
future, he said he supported the
choice of the International Insti
tute.
"The International Institute,
which has a long and distinguished
history of educating Americans in
Madrid, is a very good way to start
out our Madrid program," he said.
"It is possible that once we get our
feet on the ground in Madrid, we
could move to our own facility. But
we felt it was important to get start
ed. and this was an excellent way to
do so."
