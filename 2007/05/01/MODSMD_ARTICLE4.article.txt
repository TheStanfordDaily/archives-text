## Share of women on faculty increases 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University is claiming suc
cess in its ongoing effort to get more
women on the faculty, according to
Vice Provost for Faculty Develop
ment and Diversity Pat Jones.
Womeif make up about 43 percent
of the incoming faculty class but still
represent only 24.3 percent of over

all faculty.
"This has been ongoing for quite
a few years." Jones said. "This year
was particularly good at recruiting
untenured women."
Jones, in a presentation at the
April l l > Faculty Senate meeting on
the status of women faculty, said
that the percentage of female facul
ty at the University has risen from
17.8 in the last 10 years. While

women make up roughly 17 percent
of full-time professors, Jones said,
they represent more than one-third
of all assistant professors.
Jones attributed the higher num
ber of female assistant professors to
the fact that most applicants apply
ing for assistant professorships are
younger than those applying for
full-time positions. The majority of female appli
cants tend to he young.
"Because of age discrimination regulations, we
can't look at age." she said,"hut in untenured posi
tions most people applying are younger."
University administrators have heen working
for years to increase the number of women on the
faculty. In addition to the new childcare program
for untenured faculty members with young chil
dren. announced at the April 19 Faculty Senate
meeting, the University has created the Panel on
Gender Equity and Quality of Life in an effort to
examine the steps Stanford can take to attract more
female professors.
"The effort to further diversify our faculty is
among the most important priorities we have as an
institution," President John Hennessy said in an
email toTlie Daily."We have instituted a number of
programs over more than a decade to [give incen
tive toj our departments to recruit and retain

women and people of color."
While Jones insisted that the quality of the appli
cant is still the I Iniversity's primary concern when
hiring new faculty, she also explained that the ad
ministration is eager to bring in more women, par
ticularly in those departments traditionally staffed
by men.
Physical sciences and engineering are some of
the major departments where we have fewer
women. Jones said,"but that's true at every univer
sity, not just at Stanford."
According to Jones, the statistics of overall
women faculty at Stanford are comparable to those
of its peer institutions. While she claimed that the
current growth in the percentage of women faculty
isadmirable,she said she is also confident that there
is much more work to be done to narrow the gap
between men and women on the faculty.
Its all in a matter of getting more women into
thinking of faculty memberships as career choices."
Jones said. "What we're seeing is that the numbers
are slowly going up. We hope that more women will
enter into the pathway or pipeline towards academ
ic careers."
