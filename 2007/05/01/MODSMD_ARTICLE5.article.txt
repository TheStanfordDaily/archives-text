## Physicist decodes quarks 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Yale Physics Prof. John W. Harris
took attendees back to the beginning
of the universe at the I lewlett leach
ing Facility last night in a public lec
ture entitled "What is that Black
1 lole Doing in My Quark Soup?"
I iarris spoke as part of the Robert
1 lofstadter Memorial Lecture series,
which brings lecturers to campus to
speak about physics and the physics
of medicine.
In last night's talk, Harris ad
dressed the properties and formation
of the "soup" of quarks and gluons
that formed only a fraction of a sec
ond after the birth of the universe.
While there were not many stu
dents at the otherwise well-attended
lecture, advertisement for the event
sparked the interest of one under
graduate attendee.
"It's so neat that there are just a
bunch of random lectures here," said
Amy Kwon '10. "I was especially in
terested because the Introductory
Seminar I took last quarter dealt a lit
tle in cosmology"
Other audience members said
they appreciated Harris 1 ability to
simplify and contextualize a compli
cated subject.
"I think what was so great about
the lecture was that he took a topic
that was so complicated and ex
plained it in terms simple enough for
laymen to understand," said Moun
tain View resident Konrad Sosnow.
"He's a brilliant physicist and also a
brilliant communicator."
"It was oriented toward popular
understanding of physics."said I 'rank
Muennemann. who lives in San
Mateo County "His presentation had
no equations and only one graph, so
you didn't need a physics degree to
understand the lecture."
As part of his presentation, 1 larris
played a recording of Albert Ein
stein. in which the famous physicist
said that "very small amounts of
mass may be converted into a very
large amount of energy, and vice
versa." Einstein's theory applies to
Harris' observations oi high speed
collisions of atomic nuclei that occur
at a temperature of two trillion de
grees Kelvin — a number 100.000
times hotter than the core of the sun.
When the collision occurs, 400
protons and neutrons split into as
many as 8.000 particles of matter and
anti-matter. What is fascinating
about the substance that is formed.
Harris said, is that it Hows nearly per
fectly.
"it's thick, but it Hows," Harris
said."We were astonished."
According to current theory, this
thick, fluid substance is nearly identi
cal to the composition of the uni
verse in its earliest moments.
"We're interested in going back in
time and heating up matter to make

this quark and gluon soup that exist
ed 13.7 billion years ago," Harris said.
"Our main goal is to study it at high
er temperatures and really deter
mine its properties."
Harris and his colleagues con
ducted their experiments at the Rel
ativistic Heavy lon Collider, located
at the Brookhaven National Labora
tory in New York. Further experi
ments will be carried out at the more
powerful Large Hadron Collider in
Geneva, Switzerland.
ITie Robert Hofstadter Memorial
Lecture series was established by the
Physics Department in 1993, three
years after the renowned physics
professor passed away.
Hofstadter arrived at the University
in 1950 and received the 1961 Nobel
Prize in Physics.
"Hofstadter's teaching was char
acterized by the extreme clarity of his
lectures, which was much appreciat
ed by the undergraduates in the in
troductory physics series which he
often taught." read the program
handed out at the event.
Like Harris and his colleagues,
Hofstadter was interested in under
standing the composition of matter
and the structure of so-called "ele
mentary particles."
