## Childcare provided for young professors Improved options for young faculty families 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Junior faculty members often feel
pressure to choose between the de
mands of the tenure track and the lim
itations of their biological clocks. In
an effort to expand the options avail
able to such up-and-coming profes
sors, Provost John Etchemendy re
cently introduced a new financial aid
program for faculty families with
young children.
At the April l l ) Faculty Senate
meeting, Etchemendy introduced the
Junior Faculty Child Care Assistance
Program, targeted specifically at
young faculty members who are rais

ing families while simultaneously
working toward tenure appointments.
"During the seven years in which
junior faculty are working toward the
tenure decision, we expect than to es
tablish an international reputation as
one of the leaders in their field."
Etchemendy said at the meeting. "If
they fail to meet this expectation,
their position at Stanford is not con
tinued. yet these are the very same
years that coincide with the time that
many women most naturally start
families."
Iliis convergence of demands is
one of the reasons why the relative
number of women in academia re
mains low, according to Etchemendy,
who added that he believes that the
availability of affordable, available
childcare for untenured faculty with
young children "has demonstrably
higher stakes" than for any other
subset of the Stanford population.
Etchemendy also said that cur
rent childcare programs are inade
quate: Though several childcare
centers are available, there is a
shortage of spaces.
In an effort to offset childcare ex
penses. the new program will pro
vide a salary supplement for un
tenured assistant and associate pro
fessors who have children ages five
or younger. To qualify for eligibility,
the spouses of these faculty mem
bers must also have full-time jobs.
While officials in the Work Life

Office — which will oversee the
program — said that specific details
about eligibility and reimbursement
would not be available until later
this month.Etchemendy announced
at the meeting that he expected the
maximum reimbursement per fami
ly to range from $5,000 to $20,000,
depending on the income of the fac
ulty member.
"When Nobel laureate Rosalyn
Yalow spoke to a Women in Science
group at a major university many
years ago, her opening statement
was, 'The primary problem is child
care. Everything else is secondary,'"
Etchemendy said. "It's our hope
that this program will help address
that problem for Stanford's un
tenured faculty."
