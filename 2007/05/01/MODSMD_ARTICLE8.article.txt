## Value of census decreases 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The future of the U.S. Census — the
data set many Americans use to judge
themselves and their compatriots— is
in doubt, according to participants on
last night's panel "Censuses and Sur
veys: Still Useful for the Common
Good?"
Concerns about the privacy of per
sonal information plagued the 2(KK)
U.S. Census, according to panelists, and
this public distrust led to a precipitous
drop in the Census response rate,which
called the accuracy of government sta
tistics into question.
In order to remedy this erosion of
data quality, social scientists may soon
be forced to dig into other government
agencies' databases, such as the Inter
nal Revenue Service or Social Security
Administration, last night's speakers

said.This data, which contains sensitive
information, must he handled carefully
in order to avoid raising more privacy
concerns.
The panelists at last night's event in
the Green Library Social Sciences
Reading Room included Columbia
Prof. Kenneth Prewitt, former director
of the United States Census Bureau;
UC-Berkelcy Prof. Henry Brady, head
of that school's Survey Research Cen
ter; and Political Science Prof. Douglas
Rivers, founder and CI () of the Inter
net-based survey company Polimetrix.
Prewitt estimated that about 70 to
80 percent of what he calls the "nation
al statistical system" is based on survey
data, but said he thinks this number wiil
be halved in 20 years.
"Why is that?" he said. "The answer
is almost alwavs the increasing cost of
survey data. The sample cost of the
2010 Census will he close to $12 hillion.
up b\ five billion dollars in the past
decade.That is driven by how hard it is
to get people to answer questions,
fhere is across the survey industry a
response rate crisis."
Prewitt added that incomplete
questionnaires are increasing at "as
tronomical rates."
Brady said a convergence of factors
was responsible for the decline in re
sponse rates.
"Marketers haven't helped us at all
with their incessant pestering of peo
ple. 1 think trust in institutions has
gone down," he said. "Technology has
n't helped us that much with people
that now have caller ID and if they
don't know the number that's calling,
they don't return the call. Or they have
answering machines and it they don't
like who you are, they don't reply."
Rivets hypothesized that these fac

tors might be related to a general de
cline in social cooperation.
"Something like the Census that
has typically had extremely high levels
of voluntary cooperation is going
down," he said. "That's difficult to ex
plain, other than higher levels of social
distrust."
Much of the discussion revolved
around confidentiality issues inherent
in using administrative data for statis
tical purposes — issues that Prewitt
outlined in detail.
"I spent hours and hours trying to
explain to people 'send in your Census
form, because after you do. we don't
care about you. You just become a sta
tistical record.'" he said. "But adminis
trative data are primarily about partic
ular individuals. When the federal gov
ernment uses administrative data to
manage Social Security they actually
want to know who people are. what
their income history and ages are and

so forth."
In the end. Prewitt said,the blurring
of the line between administrative
data — like Social Security informa
tion — and statistical data would like
ly lead to a decrease in privacy and a
further decrease in public participa
tion in surveys.
"We're not surprised when admin
istrative data keeps our identity at
tached to it."he said. "But for statisti
cal data, we don't care about people's
identities. Therefore, we have drawn a
firewall between statistical data and
administrative data. Now that firewall
is being breached. It has to be. We're
going to have a period with much less
privacy and confidentiality. I cannot
tell whether we will get a public outcry
when these datasets are merged. 1 just
don't know."
