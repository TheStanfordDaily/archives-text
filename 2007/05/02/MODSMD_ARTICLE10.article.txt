## The 						not-sosecret lives of words "FLOCCINAUCINIHILIPILIFICATION," ANYONE? 
### 
Last Thursda> night. Stanford hosted a
fast-paced, grueling competition — a
new kind of sport. There would be
only one left standing at its end. and philos
oph> major Chris Simpson '08 was deter
mined to he that man.
The audience waited with bated breath
for his next task.
"A flat-topped flower cluster in which
the individual flower stalks arise from the
same point." read the moderator.
The look on Simpson's face said it all: He
was a goner, a goner in Stanford's first-ever
"define-a-thon." He chose a word at ran
dom.
"I'm sorry." the moderator said. "That is
incorrect. The correct response was an
umbel."
In a define-a-thon. each contestant is
read a definition, followed by a set of an
swers to choose from. Unlike in a spelling
bee. contestants do not simply have to spell
the word: they must understand what it
means.
The event, hosted in a corner of the Stan
ford Bookstore, attracted only a handful of
competitors and even fewer spectators. Ad
mittedly. I didn't expect all of Stanford to
share my passion for words and the event
was publicized only by a small sign outside
the bookstore — but still. Harvard man
aged to fill an auditorium with over 200 peo
ple. according to a Apr. 30 article in The New
York Times.

As a fuzzy. I take pride in my love of lan
guage. but as I sat watching the define-a
thon. I felt ashamed. Ashamed of Stanford,
for not caring enough about anything other
than the sciences. Ashamed of Stanford's
two contestants, neither of whom went be
yond a round that included such stumpers
as "gazebo" and "demagogue." But mostly.
1 was just ashamed of the people at Ameri
can Heritage — word lovers I thought
were like me — who thought up the whole
idea.
Because a word is not just a string of ran
dom symbols, nor is it a simple sign. Words
are living, breathing creatures with history
and personality. Knowing a word's defini
tion is like knowing your best friend
through her Facebook profile: It's a shallow,
superficial appreciation of a complex and
beautiful thing. The competition is an im
pressive feat of rote memorization, but like
a spelling bee. it entirely misses the beauty
of language.
Consider a word that arose in Harvard's

define-a-thon. Tintinnabulation, meaning
the ringing of bells, derives from the ono
matopoeic Latin verb tintinnare. which
means to clink or jingle. The obscure word
that gained some prominence only after it
appeared in a line of poetry by Edgar Allen
Poe:
Keeping rime, time. time.
In a sort of Runic rhyme.
To the tintinnabulation that so musically
wells...

Or take my favorite word of all time,
"floccinaucinihilipilification." which was
created when a high school student strung
together four Latin words, each meaning
"nothing." And not just the esoteric is fasci
nating: even the most common, everyday
words can be special. "Inspire" literally
means "to breathe in." as though the muses
themselves were breathing ideas into us.
Regardless of your major — fuzzy or
techie — take a moment to think about the
impact of language on your life The best

teachers are the ones who communicate the
concepts; the best lecturers are the ones
who move us with their words. Language is
a reflection of human intelligence, a product
of evolution, just like the jacaranda trees
blooming in the Quad, or the winged butter
flies that flutter past. It cannot be reduced to
a competition of fact-recitation — and it
never should.
