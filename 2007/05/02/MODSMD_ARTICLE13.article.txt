## Editorial Board Sell impounded bikes to new students 
### 
The reccnt wave of ominous pink bicy
cle flyers warning of doubled fines
and increased enforcement turned
out to be a fraud by geniuses incapable of
spelling "safety" (it was spelled "saftey"),
but one of the reasons it seemed believable
is that the Department of Public Safety does
in fact flyer and collect abandoned bikes.
While this policy is logical and helpful, the
process of reselling impounded bikes could
use improvement.
If a bike is left unattended and noticed by
Public Safety officials, it will be tagged with
a warning flyer and impounded if it is still
there after 14 days. Generally bikes are no
ticed because of missing parts, flat tires or
rusted chains. After 90 days of impound
ment. bikes are given to charity, destroyed
or sold at a special "Bicycle Re-Cycle" sale
for Stanford students, faculty and staff.
At the sale, everyone with a valid Stan
ford ID card can buy up to two bikes for the
blanket price of $27 each. Sounds like a
great deal, right? The problem is that ac
cording to the DPS website the next sale will
be October 25, 2007. The first day of the
2007 fall quarter is September 24, almost ex
actly a month before. It does not make any

sense to have a large, discounted bike sale a
month into the beginning of the year, a point
when most new students in the market for
bikes will already have found them.
While the Department of Public Safety
(DPS) did not respond to repeated queries
about why the sale takes place in October, it
is hard to believe that there would be any
reasonable motive for the current date, and
harder still to conclude that the date cannot
be changed.
The first week of school would be an ex
cellent time for the DPS to resell the bikes
it has collected, and the increased demand
at the time might even allow it to charge a
moderately higher price. Buying a used
bike on the cheap from a friendly represen
tative of the campus police would also help
new students get off on the right foot with
Stanford's often-maligned law enforce
ment.
Moving the impounded bike resale
would undoubtedly lure some prospective
buyers away from the Campus Bike Shop,
but an important resource is currently going
unutilized by the members of the Stanford
community who would be benefit most by
it.
