# Why there's a gash on my chin

id you consume any alcoholic
1 beverages before the incident?
JL/ Did you take any non-pre
scribed medication or inhale any chemical
stimulants? Were you under the influence of
ANYTHING?"
The nurse wrote down a string of no's,
shook her head, and left me to bleed in the
lobby. On the bottom half of my face was a
large piece of gauze, and on the top half was
a look of shame.
Once again, 1 had been brought to the
emergency room and once again. I had no
excuse for it.
There's an episode of "Beavis and
Butthead" (and 1 apologize for the refer
ence) in which Beavis acquires a six-pack of
beer, and the two teenagers drink their bev
erages on the steps of a convenience store. A
policeman approaches and asks them to
perform a series of sobriety tests. Instead of
touching his nose, Beavis touches his "nads."
and Butthead, in trying to say the alphabet
backwards, can only manage
"A...8....A....What comes before B?" before
convulsing wildly and spilling beer all over
his shirt.
The policeman is convinced that they're
drunk, until he lifts up the six-pack to reveal
it is in fact non-alcoholic beer. He memo
rably quips. "You guys aren't drunk, you're
just stupid!"
And that's just it. That's the story of my
life.
1 knew perfectly well at the time that to
try to surf on a Slip N' Slide was a bad idea.

But as I stood in the mouth of the beast,
ready to begin my journey, only one thought
flashed through my mind: "Man! Even if I
fall, this would make a great story!"
1 was doing well for the first three-fourths
of my hanging-10. But Slip N* Slides hide be
hind their fun exterior a sinister demonic
core, and this demon lashed out against me
as 1 received a 3" by 2" by .5" gash at mile
mark 0.76. As I stepped off the Slip N' Slide,
trying to play off the massive slash as a sim
ple scratch. 1 have to say that I regretted
what had just happened.
ITie same goes for my attempts to do a
marathon yoga session (5 yoga classes in one
day, because, no lie, I was in danger of fail
ing). my almost trip to the sperm bank (the
75 dollars was tempting, but they can find
you when they turn 18) and my skinny-dip
ping jump into 20 feet of water from 10 feet
off the ground (next to a sign reading "do
not jump here").
I don't know what causes this exactly, but
