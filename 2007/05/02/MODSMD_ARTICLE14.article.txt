id you consume any alcoholic
1 beverages before the incident?
JL/ Did you take any non-pre
scribed medication or inhale any chemical
stimulants? Were you under the influence of
ANYTHING?"
The nurse wrote down a string of no's,
shook her head, and left me to bleed in the
lobby. On the bottom half of my face was a
large piece of gauze, and on the top half was
a look of shame.
Once again, 1 had been brought to the
emergency room and once again. I had no
excuse for it.
There's an episode of "Beavis and
Butthead" (and 1 apologize for the refer
ence) in which Beavis acquires a six-pack of
beer, and the two teenagers drink their bev
erages on the steps of a convenience store. A
policeman approaches and asks them to
perform a series of sobriety tests. Instead of
touching his nose, Beavis touches his "nads."
and Butthead, in trying to say the alphabet
backwards, can only manage
"A...8....A....What comes before B?" before
convulsing wildly and spilling beer all over
his shirt.
The policeman is convinced that they're
drunk, until he lifts up the six-pack to reveal
it is in fact non-alcoholic beer. He memo
rably quips. "You guys aren't drunk, you're
just stupid!"
And that's just it. That's the story of my
life.
1 knew perfectly well at the time that to
try to surf on a Slip N' Slide was a bad idea.

But as I stood in the mouth of the beast,
ready to begin my journey, only one thought
flashed through my mind: "Man! Even if I
fall, this would make a great story!"
1 was doing well for the first three-fourths
of my hanging-10. But Slip N* Slides hide be
hind their fun exterior a sinister demonic
core, and this demon lashed out against me
as 1 received a 3" by 2" by .5" gash at mile
mark 0.76. As I stepped off the Slip N' Slide,
trying to play off the massive slash as a sim
ple scratch. 1 have to say that I regretted
what had just happened.
ITie same goes for my attempts to do a
marathon yoga session (5 yoga classes in one
day, because, no lie, I was in danger of fail
ing). my almost trip to the sperm bank (the
75 dollars was tempting, but they can find
you when they turn 18) and my skinny-dip
ping jump into 20 feet of water from 10 feet
off the ground (next to a sign reading "do
not jump here").
I don't know what causes this exactly, but

i Nat-ural Philosophy
if lve got a choice between doing
something stupid and having a story
to tell, and wisely abstaining, 1 invari
ably choose the former. Some part of
me thinks I'm an action hero, able to
do idiotic things but come through in
the end, with the hot chick and the car.
1 like to think, though, that it's not
just me: It's a sort of college disease.
One might think that here at
Stanford, such a disease would be
less prevalent. But au contraire, stu
dents here have much less common

sense than the average Joe. I'm not
alone in my foolish attempts to be
come a celebrity. In fact, we find even
more clever ways to be stupid. Be
fore entering college, 1 didn't know
what the explosive thermite was. 1
didn't know how far a two-liter bot
tle could shoot up into the air when
you put subliming dry ice into it. I
had never heard the sound of a
pumpkin hitting the ground from
atop a 6 story building, and 1 didn't
know the calculations necessary to
ensure that the resulting splat didn't
hit the nearby table at the bottom.
When you get a bunch of 18-24
year-olds together in one institution,
no matter how intelligent all of them
are, this kind of stupidity is bound to

happen. And injury is seemingly in
evitable in this situation — regret
table, but memorable, injury.
But! For the sake of our hospital
bills, our chins and our mothers, let's
all try to lay off the legend-making a
bit. It's possible to retain the element
of celebrity without creating life
threatening danger. Most of us may
lack a single grain of common sense,
but even animals know such simple
truths as You Do Not Stand Up On a
Slip IST Slide.

It may sound a hit hypocritical com
ing from him, hut Nat sees myself now
as at least a temporarily reformed
man. Write him with stupid college sto
ries at nat.hillard@stanford.edu.
