# Drawing a blank

Imagine an alternate universe where the
city of San Francisco uses an innovative,
"fair" program to assign its inhabitants
housing. It goes something like this: Families
or groups of friends join together and are
given a random number by the city council.
Based on that number, they rank prefer
ences of where they want to live. The best
housing in the city requires ridiculously low
numbers. Like Nob Hill? You'd better hope
you break the century mark.
The lottery does not discriminate, but
there are caveats. Those who prefer alterna
tive housing can get priority to live in special
themed houses. Others can join elite clubs
and are then guaranteed to live in that house
every year. If an inhabitant chooses to leave
San Francisco and return a few months later
they are randomly assigned a room despite
any number ranking. This could mean a
housing assignment to a quaint studio in
Noe Valley or a disheveled shack in
Bay view. It doesn't matter how long a per
son has lived in San Francisco, or what num
ber they received before, this system is com
pletely random.
Sound familiar? Before you say, i've
heard it all before," let me insist that this col
umn is not about our flawed draw system. In
fact, the draw system isn't so bad (although
this is coming from someone who will never
be forced to enter the draw ever again). In
stead. I use my imaginary world to illustrate
the strife of finding housing outside of Stan

ford. 1 would love to get together with some
friends, complain about receiving a high
number and leave the rest to the city council.
If I received a bad assignment I would ex
press my bitterness like any normal person:
by hoarding food from open kitchens. Find
ing housing in the real world, while more
fair, actually requires more effort.
First you must find a roommate. This can
be taxing, especially if you ignored my previ
ous advice and decided not to move back
home after graduation. line good news is
that if you decided to stay in the Bay Area
then your quest to find a living partner will
not be too difficult. It turns out so many of us
stick around that San Francisco might as
well be considered another Stanford cam
pus. except with less palm trees and more
hipsters. For those of you who decided to
take the Teach for America job in South
Dakota,you might have a harder time. While
your BFFs are finding their ideal apartment

in the Mission, you could be forced
to live with an actual stranger
(gasp!). There are hoards of Web
sites dedicated to finding that per
fect roommate, but the fact of the
matter is you never know what a per
son is like until you live with them.
The creepy roommate is every
body's nightmare. I"he roommate
that steals your underwear. The
roommate that claims to work at an
Internet start-up, but pays for every
thing in cash and returns each night
smelling like fish. The roommate
that spreads peanut butter on your
toes while you are sleeping then
wakes you up as he is licking it off.
(You thought you were having a
pleasant dream about your child

hood dog.) Your roommate swears
it's nothing sexual; he just really likes
feet, and peanut butter. There is
nothing you can do about these
roommates but move apartments
and long for the days of your draw
group.
The next step is to find a place to
live. Finding an apartment is like
finding deals on eßay: All you really
need are the internet and a little pa
tience. It also doesn't hurt to know
the right people. If you're lucky,
your friend of a friend's uncle's girl
friend's neighbor might be moving
out next month. Finding furniture is
another story. While your first in
stinct is to probably go on a shop
ping spree at IKE A, I recommend
garage sales and street corners. Go
ahead, search "free stuff" on
Craigslist. It's a goldmine, as long as
you are up to date on your Tetanus
shot.
Finally, there are the logistics.

Who's going to buy the microwave?
Do 1 have to pay for cable if 1 don't
watch TV? Why can't I cook naked?
Small details do not seem important,
but could easily lead to the spread of
discontent and/or syphilis.
When it all adds up. I suppose that
finding real-world housing is worth
the effort. While the process can be a
pain, the outcome can be great. Not
to mention that when you live in the
crap of Bayview you will be paying
significantly less than you would be
to relax in the splendor of Nob Hill
— something that can't always be
said for living variations on campus.
As for finding a roommate, just pray
that your friends will settle in the
same city. Or start numbering your
underwear.
