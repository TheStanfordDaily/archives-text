# Drawing a blank

Imagine an alternate universe where the
city of San Francisco uses an innovative,
"fair" program to assign its inhabitants
housing. It goes something like this: Families
or groups of friends join together and are
given a random number by the city council.
Based on that number, they rank prefer
ences of where they want to live. The best
housing in the city requires ridiculously low
numbers. Like Nob Hill? You'd better hope
you break the century mark.
The lottery does not discriminate, but
there are caveats. Those who prefer alterna
tive housing can get priority to live in special
themed houses. Others can join elite clubs
and are then guaranteed to live in that house
every year. If an inhabitant chooses to leave
San Francisco and return a few months later
they are randomly assigned a room despite
any number ranking. This could mean a
housing assignment to a quaint studio in
Noe Valley or a disheveled shack in
Bay view. It doesn't matter how long a per
son has lived in San Francisco, or what num
ber they received before, this system is com
pletely random.
Sound familiar? Before you say, i've
heard it all before," let me insist that this col
umn is not about our flawed draw system. In
fact, the draw system isn't so bad (although
this is coming from someone who will never
be forced to enter the draw ever again). In
stead. I use my imaginary world to illustrate
the strife of finding housing outside of Stan

ford. 1 would love to get together with some
friends, complain about receiving a high
number and leave the rest to the city council.
If I received a bad assignment I would ex
press my bitterness like any normal person:
by hoarding food from open kitchens. Find
ing housing in the real world, while more
fair, actually requires more effort.
First you must find a roommate. This can
be taxing, especially if you ignored my previ
ous advice and decided not to move back
home after graduation. line good news is
that if you decided to stay in the Bay Area
then your quest to find a living partner will
not be too difficult. It turns out so many of us
stick around that San Francisco might as
well be considered another Stanford cam
pus. except with less palm trees and more
hipsters. For those of you who decided to
take the Teach for America job in South
Dakota,you might have a harder time. While
your BFFs are finding their ideal apartment
