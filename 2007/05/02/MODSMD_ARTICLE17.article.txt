# Scooping up some soft-serve
## 
### 
Last week 1 started reading "Lolita,"
Vladimir Nabokov's classic novel
about an aging European pedophile
seducing his twelve-year-old stepdaughter.
Today I spent an hour eating ice cream, sur
rounded by braces-wearing, awkwardly gig
gling seventh-graders. Was the novel working
its magic already? Life imitating art? Some
downright dastardly plot of the cosmos?
No. the actual story is even more sinister:
1 was at an ice cream social with a Girl Scout
troop in Menlo Park, as part of a service
group. When I signed up for the club, I was
envisioning a group of fresh-faced Stanford
undergraduates crusading weekly to East
Palo Alto to spread joy in the otherwise grim
lives of a ragtag team of loveable orphans. We
would make s'mores with them, help them
identify local flora and fauna, teach them to
make trail signs leading to a glorious feminist
future.
Instead, we sat cross-legged on a stainless
white carpet, making low-fat premium-brand
sorbet sundaes with a Williams-Sonoma ice
cream scooper. Meanwhile, a 50-year-old ad
exec wearing designer yoga pants plied us
with questions about why we wanted to
spend our weekends hanging with tweens. At
one point she asked where we were all from.
When I told her Vegas she responded,
"Oh. I'm surprised you have schools good
enough to get people into places like Stan
ford." She gave me a thorough once-over.
"Well, good for Stanford for supporting that
kind of — diversity."
1 wanted to tell her. look. 1 graduated In
ternational Baccalaureate, speak Russian
and could probably kick her lipo-ed.tanning
boothed suburban ass all the way to the near
est Pottery Barn. That would have just been
proving her point, though: You can take the

girl out of the ghetto, but...
I choked down a spoonful of ice cream,
silent, and wondered when we would meet
the girls. In spite of their vulgar mothers, the
troop was made up of eight terrifically sweet
twelve-year-olds. It's easy to forget, hut kids
that age are extremely charming: rambunc
tious, egotistical, ambitious and only a tew
baby steps away from the puberty from
which only a few of them will ever recover.
Sadly, this brief window ol pleasantness
was immediately slammed shut — mommy
had more questions for the big girls. What are
our career aspirations? Are we just doing this
to pad our resumes? (She has a point: being a
20-year-old girl scout is pretty desirable to fu
ture employers.) Do we have any memories
of our scouting experiences we'd like to
share? In the background blared a ( D ol
progressive jazz played on chimes. I kid you
not.
As I examined the gauche art on the walls
and felt the plush carpet under my toes, this
whole endeavor gave off a stink more putrid
than the white gardenia Glade Plug-in be
side me. These girls in no conceivable way
needed charity from me or anyone else in the
free world. Meanwhile, we described to the
girls our brushes with community service —
ranging from selling enough cookies to take
a troop to India, to fundraising for three

legged dogs, to feeding s'mores to homeless
people for god's sake.
I low are we supposed to teach these mal
leable young adults the meaning of commu
nity service if the best we can muster is barg
ing into Menlo Park mansions and sucking
down sorbet? What we were proposing to do
was spread petit bourgeois culture like a
virus to these meek, innocent little girls. Best
case scenario, we perpetuate a cycle of vapid
community service.
1 sincerely hope this is not the best we can
do.
As we shook hands with Betty Yogapants
and filed out the door, she told us she would
love to see us at their troop Christmas party.
In this group of three parents and eight well
behaved girls, the leader could not think of a
single thing for us to do for the remainder of
this calendar year. The troop was accepting
our unnecessary charity as an act of charity.
When I got home, 1 took an hour-long
shower to scrub the stench of bourgeois out
of my pores and blared some indie-punk to
shake out the last windchime. The only foul
remnant of the encounter 1 couldn't exorcise
was the question of what I had been doing
there in the first place.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against
the Girl Scouts: they promote clean outdoor
living, foster a love for community service and
lordy lordy you haven't lived until you've tried
their Caramel Delite cookies. And while I per
sonally' did not last long in the hallowed Girl
Scout ranks (I managed to get kicked out of
both a Brownies troop and Catholic school in
the same memorable month of my youth). I've
always had a soft spot for what looks like a fun
after-school activity.
