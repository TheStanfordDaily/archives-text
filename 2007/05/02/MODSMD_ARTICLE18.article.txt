# Letter to the Editor
## Nakbah Day: Let's think critically for a second. 
### 
Everyone who is informed about the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict knows that its
tricky. There is no need for me to recount all
the human rights violations on both sides, the
historical claims by both parties to land, or
the suffering endured bv all: it's enough to
say that very few would describe the situa
tion as "simple" or "clear-cut."
Given all of the unambiguous human
rights situations in the world, from Sudan to
Haiti, Uganda to the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Nigeria to the jungles of Laos and
Myanmar. I am continually frustrated when
activists brush all of these cases aside in
favor of exclusive focus on anti-Israeli rhet
oric. No mention is ever made that Israel is
one of the only Middle Eastern countries
where women can vote, that Arabs are rep

resented in the Israeli parliament and the
Supreme Court or that Israel has accepted
more than I million refugees since 1989.
Also notoriously absent from anti-Israeli
rhetoric is the fact that Palestine is now
legally governed by an internationally rec
ognized terrorist organization.
Before I get a flood of angry emails. 1
want to be clear that I do not think Israel is
perfect, or even guilt-free when it comes to
human rights violations. But while the pro-
Israel demonstrators on campus continue to
call for cooperation and an end to the vio
lence. I keep receiving emails from anti Is
raeli activists equating Israeli independence
with Palestinian catastrophe — implying
that the very existence of an Israeli state is
wrong. There is never any mention of
progress when Israel makes a huge conces
sion like the withdrawal from Gaza, and it
makes me wonder if the constant activism
proclaiming Israeli human rights violations

is a conscious effort to hide the ones occur
ring on the other side.
All I am requesting is that we divorce our
selves from our emotions and think about
this situation rationally. Is it not clear by now
that the only solution is a carefully crafted
compromise that acknowledges the plight of
both sides? Have we still not learned that fur
ther polarization will simply impede the road
to peace? ITiis is not a simple situation, so
let's stop making it seem we are dealing with
one. 1 desperately want Palestinians to have
basic human rights and the right of return,
but I also want Israeli children to stop dying.
Since the peace talks broke down in 2(XX).
there have been over 100 suicide bombings
in Israel. Maybe if we start thinking critically
and promoting a dialogue, we can have fewer
deaths on both sides in the next 7 years.
