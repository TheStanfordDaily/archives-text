### JENNIFER O'NEIL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford gymnastics never fell, a feat that no
other team was able to match at the three-day
NCAA C hampionships this past weekend. And
though only four-tenths of a point separated
second and fifth place, the Card is content with
a fifth-place finish on a 196.825 score.

"When we
stood on the
floor behind
our fifth-place
banner, we
were only 20
feet away from

banner,"sophomore Kelly Fee said."Last year,
we were hundreds ot miles away ITiis meet was
a necessary step toward a future national title,
and we're all very pleased with our finish."
Six Stanford gymnasts, the most in school
history, walked away with 13 All-American
awards. Five Stanford gymnasts also qualified
for the individual event tinals.
The Card started in the prelims last Thurs
day night and placed second in its session to be
come one of the "Super six that moved on to
the final day of national team competition.
"We hit 24-for-24 routines on the day of pre
lims for first time since January, so it was amaz
ing to have the opportunity to compete on the
final day of the year." sophomore Nicole Oura
da said.
Stanford vaulted its way into the "Super Six"
with confidence and precision. High scores in
cluded junior Tabitha Yim's 9.9 and junior Alex
Pintchouk's 9.875. Stanford also posted a team
vault score of 49.225.
Halfway through the competition. Stanford
stood one-tenth of a point ahead of UCLA, just
like coach kristen Smyth had hoped.
"We definitely expected it to be a dog fight."

Smyth said. "To hang in with those kind of great
teams was outstanding."
The Card's performance on the balance in
the pre-lim competition was solid, and Stanford
went into Friday's routines with confidence. Ju
nior Lauren Elmore led off with a 9.8. and five
solid routines followed. A 49.25 on the beam
turned out to be the third-highest team score on
any event all night.
Stanford moved to the last event, the floor
exercise, knowing that one mistake could take
them out of the running.'lTie team stepped up to
the challenge and put together an outstanding
performance, highlighted by a 9.9 from fresh
man Carly Janiga and a difficult routine by El

more.
"Lauren has one of the hardest routines out
there;she completed a full twisting double back
in her first pass and had lots of bonuses
throughout the routine," Smyth said. "This was
the best floor rotation of any team that I have
coached."
At the end of the night, the Card stood
proud as it was awarded its fifth-place Ail-
Around title.
"1 can't even attempt to explain what I felt at
that moment," Yim said. "All the morning prac
tices, cardio, pressure sets — all the sacrifices
we made as a team went in to that moment.and
it was definitely worth the effort."

Five girls went on to compete in the individ
ual event finals on Saturday: Tricase and Janiga
on the vault; Ourada, Fee and Yim on the beam;
and Janiga and Yim on the floor.
Tricase chose to scratch from the vault finals
due to a flare-up in her shoulder from the two
days of competition beforehand. Janiga went on
to compete and scored a 9.75.
On the balance beam. Yim scored a 9.83375,
and Fee fought a wobble on her flight series to
earn a 9.75. Ourada, a gymnast who has only
competed on the beam seven times this season,
scored a 9.875 to earn a tie for third.

Sophomore Nicole Ourada hopes to stick the landing in a Feb. 9 meet against Oregon State, lowa State and San Jose State. Stanford landed in
fifth at the NCAA Championships this past weekend; Ourada tied for third on the beam in Saturday's individual competition.
"We are so proud of Nicole,"
Smyth said. "She has worked so hard
and come so far this season. She was
the very last one to compete in front
of an arena of K).(KK) people. She
stepped up when the pressure was on
and nailed her routine."
Janiga and Yim both scored
9.8875 to tie for eighth.
ITie Card will have every single
gymnast returning next year, plus
three new recruits and a healthy
freshman. Allyse Ishino — all giving
the women "incredible depth." ac
cording to Smyth.
With this year's return to the
NC'AA Championships (after a two
year hiatus), Stanford has shown that
it belongs at nationals and sees this
year as a great jump-off point for
next year.
"We proved all season long that
we're one of the best teams in the
country,and we're ready to build from
here," Tricase said. "Also, the experi
ence of competing in a Super Six is
embedded in our minds and is going
to be an invaluable asset to our men
tal game as we train for next vear."
