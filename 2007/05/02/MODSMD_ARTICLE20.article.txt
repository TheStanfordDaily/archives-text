# Santa Clara rips baseball, 16-8
## Card never recovers from Broncos' nine-run first 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford pitchers could not find
the strike zone last night. On the
rare occasion they did get it across
the plate, Santa Clara capitalized.
The Broncos tallied seven
walks, seven hits and nine runs â€”
in the top of the first inning. Stan
ford never recovered in its third
loss of the season to Santa Clara,
16-8. The Broncos (23-23) have
outscored the Cardinal (18-24. 3-
12 Pacific-10 Conference) 35-16
over those contests.
"Well. I think we've tried dang
near everything." associate head
coach Dean Stotz said of the strug
gling Stanford pitching staff.
"(Pitching) is just so contagious. Suc
cess breeds success, and getting hit
makes you a little gun shy. Then, the
ball doesn't finish the right way."
Nathan Faulkner (5-5, 2 RBI),
Tommy Mendica (3-4, 2 RBI) and
Carl Bacon (3-4, 2 RBI) led the
Santa Clara offense, but the Bron
cos got a lot of help from erratic
pitching.
After striking out the first batter
he faced, sophomore starter Austin
Yount (2-1) yielded three hits and a
walk, including an RBI single to
Medica,before being lifted with two
outs in the inning.
Freshman Brandt Walker re
verted to the form he showed in his
last Santa Clara outing when he

walked the bases loaded to start the
game and completed only 1.1 in
nings. Walker gave up three walks
and a hit without retiring a hatter.
Sophomore Max Fearnow finally
got out of the 30-minute inning on a
pop fly to center from (iahe AJcantar.
Sean O'Neill (2-1) earned the
win for Santa Clara, allowing nine
hits and six runs over five innings.

AT WASHINGTON STATE
5/5-5/7 Pullman, Wash.

Down 10-0, junior Michael Tay
lor (2-4.4 RBI) led a Stanford come
back with a two-run double off the
top of the centerfield wall in the
third and then added a two-run
homer well over the left-field fence
in the fifth.That brought Stanford to
its closest margin of the game, 10-6.
"I'm one of those guys who's al
ways trying to figure out. adapt and
find the swing that's going to be
most successful for me and what
kind of approach is going to be the
most successful over the long run,"
Taylor said. "It feels really good.
The longer I work with it.the more
I become comfortable and the more
it becomes mine."
But Santa Clara would respond
with a six-run outburst in the sixth.
Long (1-4. 4 RBI) hit a one-out
bases-loaded double off Cory Ban

nister to push the lead to 16-6.
Adam Sorgi went l-for-3 with
two RBI in his first game since
being named Pac-IO Player of the
Week for his performance last week
against Oregon State. It marked the
first time the junior received the
award in his career and the second
Cardinal player to be named this

season.
"We haven't really been pitching
well as of late," Sorgi said. "It's
tough because we have the talent to
do it, but for some reason we just
haven't been putting it together."
