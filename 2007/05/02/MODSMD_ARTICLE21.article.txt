## Michigan QB moves to Farm 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jason Forcier. the University of
Michigan's No. 2 quarterback, will
transfer to Stanford. Mike Eubanksof
Theßootleg.com reported on Mon
day.
Due to NCAA transfer rules,
Forcier will practice with the team
next fall, hut will not be able to play in
games. I le will have two seasons of el
igibility remaining, for the 2008 and
2009 campaigns.
Forcier sought a transfer in the
face of a playing-time bottleneck. Se
nior Chad Henne is a three-year
starter, while incoming freshman
Ryan Mallett is the second-rated
quarterback in the entire class of
2011.
The 6-foot-2,218-lb Southern Cal
ifornia-native is one of head coach
Jim Harbaugh's highest-profile re
cruiting catches to date. Harbaugh
had also recruited him as head coach
at the University of San Diego —
Forcier's father played quarterback
for the Toreros — but the lifelong
Michigan fan chose Ann Arbor in
stead.
"Leaving for Stanford, it's a com
bination of things: being a little closer
to home, and it's a great school where
I think I can push myself even farther
with my academics," Forcier toldThe-
F3ootleg.com.
I"he run-pass threat was a two-year
starter at suburban Los Angeles'
Mater Dei High School (USC star
Matt Leinart's alma mater) before
transferring to St. Augustine in San
Diego. In his senior season, Forcier
threw for 2.915 yards and 40 touch
downs, while rushing for 1,014 yards
and 16 touchdowns.
At Michigan, Forcier saw mop-up
action in five games in 2006. He com
pleted three passes for 30 yards and
rushed twice for 14 yards.

Starting quarterback T.C. Ostran
der will use his final year of eligibili
ty this fall. Junior Tavita Pritchard
and rising redshirt freshman Alex
Loukas will battle for the backup job
this fall. With the transfer, highly re
garded incoming freshman quarter
back/safety Kellen Kiilsgaard will
likely move to the defensive back
iield to patch up the Cardinal's de
pleted secondary.
Hie official announcement ends
months of speculation. On Mar. 26,
Michigan blogger Brian Cook post
ed on mgoblog.blogspot.com that

Forcier intended to transfer to Stan
ford. Eubanks confirmed the intent,
hut said he still needed to be admit
ted and file transfer paperwork.
Forcier was admitted to Stanford on
April 12 — his 21st birthday.
"I cannot wait to have a chance to
get started at one of the best institu
tions in the country," he said toThe-
Bootleg.com, "and also to play BCS
football with a new, up-and-coming
coach."
