# ROB GRUBE GOLF
## Staring down the pressure 
### BY ROXIE DICKINSON 
Rob Grube claims to have a
"superstition against su
perstitions." So. heading
into the crucial weeks he
fore the NCAA Regionals
and Finals for men's golf, the junior
seemed unaffected by the tough
competitions to come.
"You won't sec me wearing dirty
socks," he said. "But you're always
nervous. People who say they aren't
are lying.
"The most difficult part of golf is
dealing with the pressure." Grube
continued."! try to rationalize it. I try

to remember that it's just one putt
and that I've practiced and sank that
shot a million times before. I just try
to detach the NCAAs from the task
at hand."
Cirube's mental approach has
been working. I le seized top individ
ual honors at the CordeValle Classic
in November and the U.S. Intercolle
giate in mid-April. Recently, he
putted his way into one of the best
stroke averages in the nation, with a
71.4 per round.
"1 expected to play better, but I
did struggle at the beginning of the

year," Grube said. "I have been
working really hard to get back on
track. I'm glad that I am playing well
when it's beginning to matter."
Grube's intended major is Amer

ican Studies, but he plans to pursue a
professional golf career immediate
ly following his graduation from
Stanford.
"It has been my dream to go pro
ever since I was little." Gruhe said.
"As I've gotten older, it has become
more of a reality. It was a difficult de
cision to make because only a small
percentage of golfers actually make
it. My parents have been really sup
portive because they know how
much 1 love golf and how dedicated
I am to the sport."
Having arrived at Stanford the
same year as Grube, head coach
Conrad Ray has seen him develop
into a potent force 011 the green.
"The future is bright for Rob in
professional golf," Ray said. "He has
the mindset of a pro in that during
his college career he has been iden
tifying his weaknesses and making
them his strengths. He really has a
great work ethic, which is what it
takes to be successful. I like to joke
that he would better as the commis
sioner because of his interest in pol
itics. but I believe that Rob will be a
golfer to look for in the professional
world."
Grube started out playing little

league baseball and basketball, like
countless other kids across greater
Chicago during the Michael Jordan
era. But after run-ins with an over
bearing little-league coach, an eight
year-old Grube made the switch to
golf
"I 've been 011 a golf course ever
since." he said. "Most of my family
members attended East-Coast prep
schools, but I didn't want to spend
six months attempting to play golf in
ice, so 1 chose Robert Luis Steven
son School in California. We were
lucky because we got to play for free
at many of California's top courses
that surround the school."
The practice paid off. Today,
Grube is perhaps Stanford's top
golfer, and a strong contender to
take NCAA West Regional honors
two weeks from now in Tempe,
Ariz.
"Rob's golf game is peaking at
the perfect time." Ray said. "He is
confident with his swing and he has a
steady short game, which all makes
for a great all-around player. 1 have
some great things to look forward to
from Rob in the next couple of
weeks."
Grube, while excited for his indi
vidual prospects, is also confident
that the No. 2 Cardinal can bring to
gether its efforts for an excellent fin
ish.
'â– 'I*he tournament is so close," he
said. "We have a tough work sched
ule this week, but I liken this prac
tice right now to cramming for an
exam. A student is not going to get it
the night before, just like the team
won't become legendary golfers the
week before a tournament. Even
though our season's results aren't
factored into who will be the NCAA
champion, we will carry a lot of con
fidence going into the tournament
because it will be a culmination of a
year's worth of work."
