# Character ignored at NFL Draft
## 
### 
With another NFL Draft in
the books, the team grades
and fan reactions have al
ready begun to pour in from across
the country. The Internet age has
created a rash of pundits and prog
nosticators, and, of course, every fan
has an opinion.
But what you find out,as the NFL
rolls on, year after year, is that often
the pick everybody loved will never
be heard from again, while the guy
universally panned as a "reach" will
blossom into a solid starter. While
it's ludicrous to claim the draft is a
crap shoot, since the league's best
teams repeatedly find the top talent,
it seems evaluating the draft is just
that.
I could tell you that 1 thought the
Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco
49ers and Atlanta Falcons were the
biggest winners, but three years from
now that prediction will mean ab
solutely nothing. By then, maybe
Brady Quinn will have flamed out of
the league and Ted Ginn will have
risen to new heights as a truly elite
receiver for the Miami Dolphins,
confounding the popular predic
tions of many draftniks nationwide.
What we can take away from the
2007 draft, though, is that despite
Pacman. Michael Vick and pretty
much every player currently wear
ing a Bengals uniform, character is
sues still aren't being taken serious
ly. It was thought that maybe new
commissioner Roger Goodell's
hard-line stance on first-time of
fenders would sway teams away
from adding players with rap sheets
to their rosters. Maybe the league
would gradually start to weed out
the negative stories that had been
such a black-eye to its public percep
tion in recent years.
But did it actually happen' Not so
much.
Everywhere you looked this
weekend, players with questionable
character were being selected. And
not just by teams desperate to im
prove quickly, either.
The Denver Broncos, who look
like they're building a perennial con
tender behind rocket-armed Jay
Cutler and Champ Bailey, the best
corner in the league, selected a pair
of Florida defensive linemen who
had each been suspended at various
times during their careers for off
field incidents. First-round choice
Jarvis Moss was suspended from the
team once and fourth-rounder Mar
cus Iliomas twice.
Meanwhile, the New England Pa
triots, famous for their prominence
atop the league in recent years and
their supposed preference for high
character individuals, took on a pair
of possible head-cases. Miami safety
Brandon Meriweather, Bill Be
lichick's first-round selection,
played a prominent role in the
school's infamous brawl with FIU
and was involved in a shooting. The
gun was registered and the actions
were deemed by police to be in self
defense. but recent events have still
shown that guns and athletes gener
ally don't mix — at least not well.
But New England's coup de grace
was'its trade of a fourth-round pick
for Oakland's mercurial — scratch
that — flat-out crazy receiver.
Randy Moss.
You all know who Moss is. It
would be almost redundant of me to
point out his status as a known team
cancer and coach killer. Figuratively,
of course. He's never actually tried
to pull a Latrell Spreewell, as far as
we know.
Ilius dies the myth of'The Patri
ot Way.' It seems that,just like every
body else in the NFL. New E ; .ngland
is most interested in winning. And
while Boston fans may not like to
hear it. this has been the most Yan
kees-like offseason for any team
outside of the Bronx in some time.
Sure, the Patriots can't outspend
everybody else, because there's a
salary cap in football. But they can.
and have, out-franticked the rest of
the league. (And yes, I did make up
my own word there.)
Remember Jan. 21. when New
England faced, and failed, against'its
arch-rivals, the Indianapolis Colts.
Peyton Manning and Co. rode the
momentum of a 38-34 AFC Champi
onship win into the Super Bowl


Griffin
Rants and Raves
against Chicago and took home the
sport's ultimate prize.
Any other team would have tried
to lix'its flaws after coming a game
short of competing for the Super
Bowl. The Patriots tried to slaughter
them.
After adding every free agent
wide receiver east of the Mississippi,
the Patriots reached westward dur
ing to draft to pluck the game's most
underachieving weapon from its
most underachieving team. And the
Raiders' new coach. Lane Kiffin,

was only too happy to oblige.
It stank of the Yankees adding
slugger after slugger to an already
stacked lineup. It stank of arrogance
and carelessness. It stank of Stein
brenner.
And if you're a Pats fan, that has
to rankle, just a little bit.
But one thing is definitely cer
tain: No matter how many players
make it rain, and no matter how
many commissioner Roger Goodell
suspends, the common denominator
in the league is exactly what it al
ways has been — winning.

Denis Griffin is still waiting to he
drafted. If you'd like to help him com
mit a crime, contact him at
