## Etchemendy's email puzzles 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Fresh off last Friday's scam in which new bicycling
rules purportedly enacted by the Department of Pub
lic Safety were stapled to bikes campus-wide, students
were wary of an email they received yesterday from
Provost John Etchemendy about a forthcoming online
survey. Some even sent emails to dorm chatlists asking
if the letter was authentic.
Yesterday afternoon, Etchemendy confirmed that
it was.
The email in question began, "This is your Provost
speaking. Now. don't tell me you didn't know you had
a Provost. We met at New Student Orientation, and it
will hurt my feelings if you don't remember."
In an email to The Daily, Etchemendy noted that the
University ran a similar survey about four years ago.
"We also had some students who thought it was a
hoax, but on the other hand, we got a very high re
sponse," the provost said.
The response rate, he added, provided good data to
help the University "improve those things that needed
to be improved, and to praise those folks who deserved
praise."
"That's why we try to write an email message that
people will actually read and respond to," he said.
ITie message asked students to fill out a 20-minute,
online survey evaluating their experiences at the Uni
versity. The survey, which will be sent in approximate
ly one week, promised confidential responses and a
prize drawing for participants.
The email also informed students that the URL

would have "mit.edu" in it because the survey was
hosted on an MIT server.
This caused Anton Strenger '10 to doubt its authen
ticity. and he even wondered if the email was an MIT
prank or hack attempt.
Strenger said he thought the email was also a little
strange because it was addressed with the SUNet ID
"kramerla" in lieu of the one Etchemendy typically
uses.
Students looked up the ID in question in the Stan
ford Who online directory to discover that it belongs to
Lisa Kramer, a survey research specialist in the Deci
sion Support Systems department.
Still, however, this did not convince students that
the message was genuine.
Students in Toyon asked fellow resident Patrick
Cordova '09, an ASSU Undergraduate Senator, to
contact Kramer to determine whether or not the email
was a scam.
"She assured me that it was in fact an email on be
half of Provost Etchemendy, and just due to the tech
nology of the operation, the survey would be complet
ed using an MIT platform." Cordova said.
The tone of the email seemed suspicious to many.
One of the message's last lines was. "Seriously, please
fill out the survey... Do it for your university, do it for
your Provost."
"It seemed kind of informal," Strenger said.
"Maybe that is him being more casual and colloquial,
but it seemed very un-Provost-like. He used a lot of ex
clamation points."
