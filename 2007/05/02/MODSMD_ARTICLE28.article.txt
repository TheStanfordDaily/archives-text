The sub-headline of yesterday's
article. "BOSP to open in Madrid."
incorrectly stated that the new over
seas studies program in Madrid.
Spain would be open to students be
ginning next fall. The new program
will actually open next winter.
The penultimate paragraph of the

same article caused some confusion
in its wording. The new BOSP pro
gram will be housed at Madrid's In
ternational Institute rather than in a
Stanford-run facility, but officials
said they would consider moving the
program to a University-owned facil
ity in the future.
