### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Senator John McCain, a leading candidate for
the Republican nomination to he the next presi
dent, made a pilgrimage to the Hoover Institu
tion yesterday to address fellows and woo donors
with a speech that outlined for the first time his
plan to create a "League of Democracies."
Speaking before more than 150 people in an
underground auditorium adjacent to the 1 loover
Tower, the Arizona Republican took a hard line
stance on Russia and China,criticized unilateral
ism, and called on the democratic nations of the
world to "strike a new grand bargain for the fu
ture."
"New dangers have arisen, great powers are
emerging and seek to shift the international bal
ance of power, and we are in the midst of two
wars whose outcome will shape our future," he
said. "Today the talk is of the war on terror, a war
in which we must succeed. But the war on terror
cannot be the only organizing principle of Amer
ican foreign policy."
In more than 3.000 words of prepared text
that he read from a teleprompter, McCain did
not use the word "Iraq" once. But at a press con
ference after the address, the senator defended
the ongoing U.S. troop surge. It was the fourth

anniversary of President George W. Bush's"Mis
sion Accomplished" speech, and the same day
the president vetoed a Democratic hill that
would have created a timetable for withdrawal.
"1 would much rather lose a campaign than
lose a war," McCain said.
