## democracy agenda On trek to Hoover Institution, Republican hopeful reaches out for support with policy speech 
### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Senator John McCain, a leading candidate for
the Republican nomination to he the next presi
dent, made a pilgrimage to the Hoover Institu
tion yesterday to address fellows and woo donors
with a speech that outlined for the first time his
plan to create a "League of Democracies."
Speaking before more than 150 people in an
underground auditorium adjacent to the 1 loover
Tower, the Arizona Republican took a hard line
stance on Russia and China,criticized unilateral
ism, and called on the democratic nations of the
world to "strike a new grand bargain for the fu
ture."
"New dangers have arisen, great powers are
emerging and seek to shift the international bal
ance of power, and we are in the midst of two
wars whose outcome will shape our future," he
said. "Today the talk is of the war on terror, a war
in which we must succeed. But the war on terror
cannot be the only organizing principle of Amer
ican foreign policy."
In more than 3.000 words of prepared text
that he read from a teleprompter, McCain did
not use the word "Iraq" once. But at a press con
ference after the address, the senator defended
the ongoing U.S. troop surge. It was the fourth

anniversary of President George W. Bush's"Mis
sion Accomplished" speech, and the same day
the president vetoed a Democratic hill that
would have created a timetable for withdrawal.
"1 would much rather lose a campaign than
lose a war," McCain said.
Courting the Institution
The visit came less than a month after former
Secretary of State George Shultz, a distinguished

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) speaks to an audience
of about 1 50 at the Hoover Institution yesterday
at noon. The presidential hopeful has been en
dorsed by former State Sec. George Shultz.
fellow and moral leader of the Insti
tution. endorsed McCain in his bid
for president.
"John McCain is a passionate
leader who believes in the inherent
benefits of freedom and liberty,"
Shultz said when he made his en
dorsement. "He understands the
enormous threat terrorism poses to
our way of life and is prepared to
fight and win the war from the first
day he steps foot in office."
Shultz and the I loover Institution
were important to the successful can
didacy of George W. Bush. In 1999,
then Texas Governor Bush met cur
rent Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, who was then Stanford's
Provost. Several fellows played
prominent advisory roles in the pres
ident's campaigns.
Much like the Republican Party,
right-leaning I loover fellows are torn
between an eclectic mix of candi
dates. In February, Hoover Senior
Fellow John Cogan signed on as co
chair of former Massachusetts Gov
ernor Mitt Romney's economic advi
sory team and Senior Fellow Michael
Boskin joined former New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Presiden
tial Exploratory Committee.
Distancing from Bush
In his noon speech, McCain dis
tanced himself from the Bush admin
istration, saying he would never start

a war with too few troops and that he
would reach out to Democrats in
Congress. His proposal for a new
multilateral institution of democratic
states seemed to contrast with the
current president's penchant for uni
lateral action.
"When we fight a war. we must
fight to win." he said. "We cannot
build an enduring peace based on
freedom by ourselves. Nor do we
want to."
Hoover research Fellow Bill
Whalen said McCain was trying to
stake out a clear position in the Re
publican field.
"It was a policy speech, not a polit
ical speech, and you don't get too
many of those in campaign years." he
said. "He showed a serious sense of
gravitas. I le was talking about solu
tions and progress. That's presiden
tial."
McCain is in California for a de
bate tomorrow at the Ronald Rea
gan Presidential Library in Simi Val
ley. The longtime media darling is
hoping to reestablish his appeal
among independent voters by pro
moting a strain of conservative prag
matism.
"In order to regain his mojo. if
you will. McCain has to score points
with political independents,"
Whalen said. "He's trying to show
he's the same John McCain as he
was back in 2(KX)."
A League of Democracies
The centerpiece of yesterday's
talk was the commitment to making
a new League of Democracies,
which McCain said could pressure

authoritarian states to change their
ways and be more effective than the
United Nations.
"This would not be like the uni
versal-membership and failed
League of Nations of Woodrow
Wilson but much more like what
Theodore Roosevelt envisioned:
like-minded nations working to
gether in the cause of peace," Mc-
Cain said. "The new League of
Democracies would form the core
of an international order of peace
based on freedom. It could act
where the UN fails to act."
Political Science Prof. Larry
Diamond, a senior fellow at
Hoover and one of the world's
foremost experts on democracy,
called McCain's speech eloquent,
"in the tradition of Kennedy and
Reagan and Wilsonian interna
tionalism."
"I particularly like the potential
for it to authorize humanitarian in
tervention and common action to
defend democracy and human
rights when the UN Security Coun
cil cannot be mobilized to do so," he
said in an email to The Daily.
But analysts said the sketch pro
vided by McCain left many ques
tions unanswered, like who would
decide what countries are democra
cies. what would happen when a
country became repressive and how
would the international community
respond to an initiative spearhead
ed by the unpopular United States.
Organizations like the European
Union and the Organization of
American States already have lan
guage which requires member

states to be democracies.
"It's not enough just to fight au
thoritarianism and wave the flag of
democracy and human rights
around the world." Diamond said.
"Once we get democratic break
throughs. we have to figure out how
to make democracy work to deliver
just, accountable, effective govern
ment. McCain has virtually nothing
to say about that. And sadly, nei
ther, so far. do any of the other can
didates."
In his speech. McCain disputed
the idea that he was being overly
idealistic.
"It is the truest kind of realism."
he said. "Today, as in the past, our
interests are inextricably linked to
the global progress of our ideals.
The vision of a new era of enduring
peace based on freedom is not a
Republican vision. It is not a De
mocratic vision. It is an American
vision."
The Campa
Not far from campus, Romney
spoke with the Western Association
of Venture Capitalists. He was also
set to meet with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger last night in Sacra
mento.
After his speech. McCain headed
south to Orange County where he
was planning to tour a Vietnamese
market with Republican state assem
blyman Van Tran before heading off
to a fundraiser.
