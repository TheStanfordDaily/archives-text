## A 						CLIMACTIC BATTLE FOR CHAIR One vote proves decisive in Nho, Sharma Senate victory 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Tension boiled over at last night's nearly
three-hour ASSU meeting, which was the
first of the newly sworn-in ninth Under
graduate Senate. Much of the debate cen

tered on a possible schism between SOCC
endorsed candidates and Stanford Review
endorsed candidates; the Senate chair and
deputy chair narrowly claimed victory in
hotly contested votes; and. in a dramatic
moment. Senator Jonathan Kass '10 pro
posed revoking his vote for Eugene Nho'lo
as deputy chair.
Priyanka Sharma '09 was selected as
chair.defeating Patrick Cordova '09 in an 8-
7 vote. Eugene Nho 10 — whose campaign
video parodying the movie "300" on

You Tube helped him win the most votes of
any candidate for Senate — was ultimately
elected deputy chair, defeating Stuart
Baimel '09 in another 8-7 vote after an in
tense controversy and potential revote.
Chair elections
In the Senate chair elections, the two
candidates laid out their platforms. Sharma
promised to fight for OSA reforms, a South
Asian Studies department, sustain
abilitv and gender-blind housing. Cor
dova also promised to work for sus
tainability and mental health issues,as
well as faculty diversity, citing his con
cerns for gay faculty seeking tenure.
But it was the notion of a divided
Senate that proved most controversial
in the battle for chair.
"This year, my passion is a success
ful. united Senate," Sharma said.
"Apart from my personal skills and
goals, my position in the Senate also
aids my candidacy. I am not a SOC'C
or Stanford Review-endorsed candi
date."
Cordova, a Review-endorsed can
didate. said his endorsements by both
the Stanford Democrats and the Stan
ford Republicans, as well as The Stan
ford Review and The Stanford Pro
gressive qualified him for the top posi
tion in the Senate.
"Some have tagged me as a parti
san in this race," he said. "I was thrilled
to be endorsed by many different or
ganizations."
"I hope you all realize that I'm an
open-minded person." he added.
"This is not about me. this is not about
Privanka. this is about us."
Luukas lives "09. ASSU senator
and editor-in-chief of The Stanford
Review, defended Review-endorsed
candidates.
"The Stanford Review endorse
ments do not pin you into a camp,"he
said.
Sharma and Cordova participated
in a question-and-answer session that
touched on their leadership styles,
their advocacy for faculty and student
diversity and concerns about a torn
Senate.
"As we all know, there are two big
endorsements that are in the student
body." Sharma said. "The reason I did
not get these endorsements is that I did
not apply for these endorsements."
"I know I had a lot of endorse
ments, but the end of the day, they're a
lot of help for flyering," Cordova re
torted. "I was actually planning on ap
plying for the Students of Color Coali
tion. I'm 25 percent Hispanic."
Baimel opposed the assertion that
The Review endorsement was a polar
izing factor.
"I don't agree with your charac
terization of us as the big two en
dorsements," he said. "I would think
the second biggest endorsement is
the Stanford Democrats. We didn't
even push an agenda on people. We
asked them about OS A and very gen
eral things."
Though ASSU Vice President
Mondaire Jones '09 pointed out that
all votes should be public according to
the ASSU Constitution, the senators
agreed that votes should be cast by se
cret ballot, as they have in the past.

Deputy chair elections
After more than an hour of discus
sion, Sharma won the chair election.
But the debate was far from over, as
deputy chair candidates outlined their
platforms.
"My vision is a united Senate," Nho
said in his speech. "By united. I don't
mean homogeneous. People are going
to have different interests and differ
ent views. That is the beauty of democ
racy."
Baimel also defended his qualifica
tions, citing his interest in working
with the Faculty Senate, a traditional
duty of the deputy chair.
"1 applied for the SOCC endorse
ment and I was told that I missed the
deadline," he said. "That does not
mean that I am not interested in
SOCC issues."
"If I am the undergraduate repre
sentative to the Faculty Senate. I want
to make sure the Faculty Senate un
derstands our position on faculty di
versity," he added. "One thing I would
like to see is the ethnic groups work
better together."
Both Nho and Baimel said that
unity should be a key concern for the
Senate.
"I agree that you guys are all inde
pendent," Nho said. "If there's any
thing that ties the Review side togeth
er it is that they are afraid of what hap
pened last year. 1 know that they don't
want SOCC to be dominating this
year. 1 am not a SOCC senator but I
am also not Review [endorsed].
Frankly. 1 don't even want to mention
the two sides."
"I don't want to see 8-7 every single
time," Baimel added. "I want to see 15-
0 where we all agree to move forward
as unified Senate."
A revote
Baimel didn't get what he wished
for. In another 8-7 vote. Nho was se
lected as deputy chair.
The meeting then reached its cli
mactic moment, when Kass said he
was considering changing his deputy
chair decision.
"I'm starting to reconsider my vote
for the deputy chair," he said.
"It's a moot point." Jones retorted."l
would have been the tiebreaker and I
would have voted for Eugene anyway"
But Kass did not want to abstain.
He wanted to switch his vote to
Baimel.
"This is ridiculous." Jones said."lt's
a stunt."
"I'm really sorry, you guys," Kass
said. "I had two minutes to decide. 1
made a quick decision."
While senators scrambled to find
the procedure for repealing a vote,
Sharma interrupted, announcing that
Kass would let his initial vote stand if
the Senate agreed to make Baimel the

Faculty Senate representative.
Nho was skeptical.
"I think that's something for me
and [Baimel] to talk about," he said."l
am personally really shocked by
what's going on right now. If 1 believe
that Stuart is an ideal candidate for
Faculty Senate, I will gladly have a
place for him."
Some senators expressed their
confusion, and exasperation filled the
room.
"This is a circus." Kass said.'T don't
think this is necessarily the right thing
to do. In this case, 1 do not want to re
peal my vote."
Committee selection
Though the crisis was averted, an
other debate sprung up almost imme
diately.
Earlier this week. Jones asked sen
ators to rank their committee prefer
ences: he then compiled a list of com
mittee assignments. Last night, the
vice president put forth a bill that pro
posed the Senate move forward with
his assignments.
Some senators opposed the plan,
and argued that it was the chair's duty
to assign members to committees.
"As I understand," lives said, "it is
under the purview of the chair to as
sign committees."
"I did not submit [my] preferences
to Mondaire," said Tomas Vacek '10.
"There were two problems that have
been going on with the selection
process. It was first come, first serve. I
don't think it was appropriate to as
sign people that shouted out first. I
have been informed by some other
candidates that some people's prefer
ences have changed since then."
"I think you guys are trying to
make a big deal out of something,"
said ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08. "It's up to you guys."
Jones argued against the notion
that he was unfair in the committee as
signments, saying that he was merely
trying to save time, and the Senate
could change committees if they liked.
"I volunteered to collect that infor
mation and to formally present it,"
Jones said. "It's up to you guys."
"I don't think that the bill reflects
what we actually want to be on,"
Baimel said.
Sharma tried to calm down the de
bate.
"Everyone send me your top three
choices," she said, "I would just prefer it
if everybody sent in their preferences."
Sharma suggested that she would
work out the committee assignments
herself. More than two and a half
hours after it began, Sharma ad
journed the meeting.
