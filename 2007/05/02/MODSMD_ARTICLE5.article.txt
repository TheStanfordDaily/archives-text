## The 						livin' is easy at Camp Stanford 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hey seniors, hoping to fine tune your leisure
skills this quarter? Perfect your tan? Wallow in
the cushy Stanford Bubble for just a little while
longer? If so, then Camp Stanford is the place for
you. Geared for kids ages 20 to 25, this quarter
long glimpse into sweet, sweet summertime of
fers senior campers the traditional Stanford ex
perience — without the burden of silly educa
tional things like midterms and letter grades.
Here at Camp Stanford — the term used to
describe the lives of lucky seniors who have al
ready graduated, but are paying for campus
housing for the remainder of the academic year
— the possibilities are endless. Students
equipped with a Permit to Attend, at the mere
price of $2,760, are eligible to stay on campus to
(depending on their permit type) audit classes,
possibly work on an honors thesis and generally
slack off like it's their job.
"1 spend a lot of time in the hammock," con
fessed Monica Uddin '07, who graduated with a
Symbolic Systems degree at the end of winter
quarter. "1 watch a lot of TV, 1 knitted a scarf.
Sometimes I do psych studies...sometimes I
don't."
"Everyone is jealous," she added, with a
laugh.
To the bitter sophomore in Green Library
who's struggling to ignore the glare of California
sunshine on his laptop, there's nothing more ago
nizing than watching the Uddins of campus frolic.
Before you sleepless problem-setters retaliate,
though, consider the fact that most Stanford sen
iors curiously seem to make legitimate use of their
free time. Shifting from the chronic stress of CiPA
maintenance to absolute nothingness is apparent
ly harder than you might think.
"Some people go into it thinking they're
going to do nothing, but they don't," admitted Je
remy Schneider '07. a resident in Theta Delta
Chi. "It gets boring pretty fast."
Shiv Vcrma '07, a Peer Health Educator in
Branner I lull, has plenty to keep him busy.
"I'm not taking classes, but I'm working full
time in an internship for the Oakland A's. It's an
8 to 5 job every day," explained Verma, who
wakes up at 6 a.m. every morning for his com
mute to San Francisco. "At first some of my
friends were like/what are you going
to do with your time?' but now that I
have a full-time job. they cut me
some slack."
And as much as Uddin plays the
part of a carefree Stanford camper. '
her existence is far from aimless.
"1 was already admitted to law
school. so I know what I'm doing
[after Stanford]." she explained, ra
tionalizing her fun-filled quarter.
For Schneider, the decision to
participate in Camp Stanford was
largely an issue of "saving SI 1.000 in
tuition." After his last required
course was shifted from spring to
winter quarter, he was lucky enough
to be able to graduate early and
spend his last quarter watching
You Tube videos, trekking off cam
pus and doing research at the Med
ical School.
"My mentality is not that differ
ent [from other students'] except for
the fact that I'm not paying anything.
If there's a day w here I'm not as pro
ductive as I usually would have been.
I feel less guilty because I'm not
wasting money doing nothing."
Many seem to agree with Schnei
der, pointing out that Camp Stanford
is not unlike any other quarters spent
on campus, except for the fact that it's
much more low key without classes.
"It's pretty nice and chill." Said
Verma. "You get to hang out with

your buddies [during] your last days
on campus."
For these campers. Camp Stan
ford doesn't seem to be an extension
of spring break, but a well-earned
breather before the real work begins.
"Being on a university campus
w here everyone else is focused on ac

ademics." Schneider said."it's not the
best place to go nuts."
He's had his share of fun. but is
quick to assure."l haven't committed
anv felonies."
