### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford synchronized swimming entered last
weekend's U.S. Nationals perfect, off an undefeat
ed season and U.S. Collegiate title. They left Na
tionals even more perfect — adding three addi
tional titles to their collection.
The Cardinal became the first collegiate team
in history to sweep all three U.S. Nationals events
— solo, duet and team — in three days of the
country's top competition.
Hut that comes as no surprise from a team that
also swept all three events — trio, duet and team
— at the U.S. Collegiate Championships, won

Juniors Courtenay Stewart and Sara Lowe re
peated as duet champions, with a 95.584 total,
48.387 in their technical routine and 47. l l )7 in the
free.
"We work so well together, and this weekend
showed that," Stewart said.
The duo previously competed against each
other as Olympic opponents — Lowe on the U.S.
team and Stewart on the Canadian team in 2(X)4.
But they put aside their rivalry upon arriving at

Stanford three years ago to become
the first repeat duet champions in
collegiate history.
"It was weird working with her at
first, hut I think that now we have a
great relationship." Lowe said.
"We've pushed each other, and we're
good friends. I think I've really devel
oped as a swimmer because of her;
I've gotten stronger because she
pushes me to have a better swim."
That improvement also led Lowe
to individual gold in the U.S. Nation
als solo event. Topping both the free
(47.834) and technical (47.584) rou
tines for a 95.418 total, the Sunny
vale. Calif.-native added onto her col
legiate title. "Happy" with her swim.
Lowe was modest about the win, but

her duct partner was quick to praise.
"It's a huge accomplishment,"
Stewart said. "She couldn't have
swam any better, and she just im
pressed everyone — not only her
team, but also the judges, and even
other coaches."
But neither Lowe nor Stewart
were done yet. Both went on to com
pete with the rest of the Cardinal in
Saturday and Sunday's team events.
Although the eight-person event
came after their own extensive rou
tines. Lowe and Stewart both said
their teammates helped pull them
through.
"1 was exhausted, but the other six
people just brought so much energy
to Courtenay and me," Lowe said.
"There's such a thrill in pulling off a
trick that you couldn't do when you
only have one or two people."
The Cardinal pulled off its own
hat trick, topping Ohio State 95.668-
94.501 to take the team title.complet

ing the historic sweep with an excla
mation point. However, the Cardinal
was unable to capitalize on its three
wins to take the U.S. Nationals over
all title. Ihat honor went to the Santa
Clara Aquamaids, who by their sheer
number of team members were able
to put eight routine scores toward
their total, compared to Stanford's
three routines.
Still, the Cardinal women were
more than happy with their perform
ance this weekend, and Lowe was
proud that Stanford was able to
make a statement.
"We did a great job," she said. "1
think we showed everyone that we
can make it to the top of the sport and
compete with the best of the best, de
spite being a collegiate team."
Stewart agreed that making histo
ry "was a huge high" for a team that
has been climbing the ranks in a sport
previously dominated by club teams
like Santa Clara. The accomplish

ment. though, also leaves the Stan
ford swimmers precariously at the
top of the national competition.
"Being on top is the hardest spot
to be in: there's nowhere to head hut
down," Stewart said. "It'll be hard
knowing that we won everything this
season, and it'll require pressure and
motivation from within to win
again."
For now, Lowe said she is enjoying
the "icing on the cake" that the Na
tionals were for her season. She'll re
turn with Stewart and their team
mates next year, looking to three
peat the U.S. Collegiate and defend
their U.S Nationals titles.
"I don't know how we can do any
better — we literally had a perfect
season." I.owe said. "Hopefully, we
can have the same accomplishment
two years in a row."
