# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Theme houses debated 
### JESSICA FISHELL 
Students gathered in Tresidder
Union yesterday evening for a panel
discussion aimed at addressing the
pros and cons of ethnic theme dorms.
The goal of the program, which
was sponsored by the Black Student
Union (BSU), was to open the discus
sion to both sides of the issue, but a
majority of vocal attendees expressed
their support for ethnic theme dorms.
"I came because I lived in Ujamaa
freshman year, so 1 have a vested in
terest in the issue,"said Sammie Sachs
"09.
Allysia Finley i0 was the only stu
dent who voiced opposition to ethnic
theme dorms.
"I think there should be an open
dialogue on the issue," she said.
That was precisely the goal when
BSU intern Esosa Ozigbo' 10decided
to spearhead the event.
"1 want to inform students on both
sides of the issue, especially freshmen
who are probably still forming their
opinions of Stanford's traditions."
Ozigbo said.

The panel was moderated by As
sistant Dean of Students Jan Barker,
who is also a resident fellow at Uja
maa, the African American theme
dorm. Hie panel showcased four stu
dents' viewpoints, and three of last
night's participants are resident assis
tants (RA) in ethnic themed dorms.
Finley, who lives in Otero,said that
ethnic themed dorms are not neces
sary to interact with people from di
verse backgrounds.
Kinton loannides "07, an Ujamaa
RA, questioned the common pre
sumption that students of color are re
sponsible for bringing diversity to
campus.
"Black people are not responsible
for providing diversity on campus," he
said. "They're here as students."
Finley criticized ethnic themed
dorms because she said they force
multiracial students to assume a
monolithic racial identity. Other stu
dents said multiracial residents of eth
nic themed dorms are not forced to
assume a particular identity.
"No one is saying you have to pick
and confine yourself to one race,"
said Ujamaa RA LaTasha Crow '07.
"The dorms are places where you can
go to express your views, whatever
that might be."
Takeo Rivera '08 agreed. As an
RA in Okada, the Asian American
theme dorm, he sees how students in
teract differently when they live in

the ethnic themed dorms.
"It's a place to allow honest dia
logue." he said "It's a comfort zone
and a learning environment."
While she conceded that the
event made her think harder about
the issue, Finley said she still believes
that ethnic theme dorms are prob
lematic.
"This talk has changed my opinion
on several points," she said. "But I still
think that Residential] Education]
could do a better job incorporating
the rest of the community."
