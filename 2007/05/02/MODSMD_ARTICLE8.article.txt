## Boge dominates Jeopardy! Winning senior cheered on by friends in lounges 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
When "College Jeopardy!" con
testant Craig Boge '07 appeared on
the screen for the annual tourna
ment's quarterfinal round last night.
Grove Lauscn residents erupted in
celebration.
Boge. clad in flip-flops, shorts and
a white polo shirt,sat in the middle of
it all. smiling sheepishly as his friends
called his name and sporadically
yelled out commentary. When his op
ponents — Hayley Clatterbuck. a
senior from the University of Nebras
ka, and Brady Cassis, a Yale junior —

appeared on the screen, there was
some light jeering from the crowd.
Boge got off to a slow start in the
first round, hut quickly rebounded
when he correctly answered a $I,(XX)
question on state capitals. Cheers
erupted in the room as Boge
flew through a series of questions in a
category about celebrities' lives in
college.
Later, in the category "You See
'LA,'" Boge correctly answered that
another name for a lasso was a larint.
When a friend yelled, "How the hell
did you know that?" Boge grinned.
By the end of the first round. Boge
was in first place with $5,200. ahead
of Cassis' $3,800 and Clatterbuck's
$2,000.
I lis lead wavered in Double Jeop
ardy!, however. After Boge incor
rectly guessed that George Bernard
Shaw wrote "The Picture of Dorian
Gray" (which was actually penned by
Oscar Wilde) and Clatterbuck made
a late surge, the Stanford senior
dropped into third place. The room
groaned, but Boge remained stone
faced and revealed nothing about his
coming surge, during which he re
gained the lead after answering a
$2,000 question about Toni Morri
son's "The Bluest Eye."
When he broke $ 10,000 with more
than half of Double Jeopardy! to
play, the crowd seemed to relax, rally
ing only when Boge answered a par
ticularly difficult question. After
Clatterbuck missed a $2,000 question
about the capital of Queensland.
Australia. Boge buzzed in, only to
hesitate until the last moments of his
allotted time.
"What is ... Brisbane?" he an
swered tentatively.
Host Alex Trebek waited a mo
ment before declaring the answer
correct.
By the time Double Jeopardy!
came to a close, Boge had $19,600 to
his credit, while Cassis, his closest
competitor, had only $ t ).0(K). The
crowd issued a loud cheer when they
realized that Boge had the game won
irregardless of the outcome of Final
Jeopardy! His friends then showered
Boge with congratulatory claps and
hugs.
"Yeah, that was incredibly tight."
Boge said as commercials rolled be
fore the Final Jeopardy! question. "I
realized that 1 didn't even have to
try."
He was lucky. The final question,
in the category "Fictional Charac
ters," asked about the character
named in the first lines of Avn Rand's
"Atlas Shrugged." Boge. who wa
gered only $600. wrote "Who is

Atlas???"
"A good guess," Trebek dead
panned as the audience laughed.
Clatterbuck was the only contestant
to identify- John Gait as the correct
answer.
Despite Boges final misstep, last
night's viewers in Grove Lasuen
were in a celebratory mood as the
ending credits rolled and Trebek
shook the contestants' hands on
screen. Boge's friends curiously
asked what Trebek had said to him.
"He told me.'You took no prison
ers,"' a noticeably proud Boge an
swered.
He added that his dominant first
round performance was "a gigantic
relief."
"I had a big fear of being behind
and performing poorly," he said.

"Setting down my buzzer at the end
of Double Jeopardy! realizing that I
had nothing to worry about was
great."
As the winner of his quarterfinal
round. Boge earned an automatic
berth in next week's semifinals,
which will air at 7 p.m. on May 9. but
he could not talk about his future
performances due to a Jeopardy! reg
ulation that prohibits contestants
from revealing the outcome of the
show prior to broadcasts.
Should his fans show up again?
"If you want to," Boge said crypti
cally. before disappearing to play a
celebratory round of video games
with his friends.
