celebration.
Boge. clad in flip-flops, shorts and
a white polo shirt,sat in the middle of
it all. smiling sheepishly as his friends
called his name and sporadically
yelled out commentary. When his op
ponents — Hayley Clatterbuck. a
senior from the University of Nebras
ka, and Brady Cassis, a Yale junior —

appeared on the screen, there was
some light jeering from the crowd.
Boge got off to a slow start in the
first round, hut quickly rebounded
when he correctly answered a $I,(XX)
question on state capitals. Cheers
erupted in the room as Boge
flew through a series of questions in a
category about celebrities' lives in
college.
Later, in the category "You See
'LA,'" Boge correctly answered that
another name for a lasso was a larint.
When a friend yelled, "How the hell
did you know that?" Boge grinned.

was in first place with $5,200. ahead
of Cassis' $3,800 and Clatterbuck's
