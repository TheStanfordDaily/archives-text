## Army gives Univ. $105 mil. grant 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ DESK EDITOR 
The U.S. Army recently allocated
a five-year, $105 million grant to a
Stanford-led team to construct, staff
and develop a facility that will house
a high-tech research center for mili
tary equipment and materials.
This Army High Performance
Computing Research Center will use
cutting edge simulations to create in
novative designs and materials for
military vehicles, equipment, battle
field communications and computer
technologies. It will be staffed by re
searchers and engineers from a vari
ety of institutions, including Morgan
State University in Maryland, New
Mexico State University at Las
Cruces.the University of Texas at El

Paso and NASA.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Charhel Farhat, who will head the fa
cility, said that state-of-the-art simu
lations technology will help the cen
ter's researchers pave a path towards
innovation.
"Modeling and simulation today
play an equal role to theory and
physical experimentation in discov
ery-driven research." he said in a re
lease. "Using the most advanced,
high-performance computing re
sources, a research center of this
magnitude has great potential for in
novating technology and reducing
design-cycle time."
The center's research will likely
have tangible benefits for civilian
life.
"A lot of things that have been de

veloped for the military in the past
are used today for civilian needs,"
Farhat said. "Penetration mechanics
modeling and simulation codes, for
example, are used today to simulate
the crash of cars."
In addition to funding military re
search. $1.5 million of the grant will be
used to support an educational out
reach program for middle and high
school students.The center's member
institutions will work with these
schools as well as the Stanford Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth to bol
ster nationwide math, science, engi
neering and computing instruction.
The center's grant will be up for
renewal in five vears.
