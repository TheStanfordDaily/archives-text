### RACHEL KONRAD LISA LEFF ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BELMONT, Calif. â€” A sport
utility vehicle jumped a curb outside
a middle school Wednesday after
noon and plowed into a group of chil
dren waiting for a bus, seriously in
juring four of them, police and hospi
tal officials said.
The incident occurred around
12:30 p.m. as Ralston Middle School
was letting out for the day. Witnesses
said the car. a 2004 I ionda Pilot, was
in the school parking lot when it hit
the students and then rammed into a
tree before stopping.
Five to seven children were hit. in
cluding several who were trapped
under the SUV when it collided with
a concrete planter outside the school
gymnasium, said Belmont Police Lt.
Dan DeSmidt. Other students were
injured or shaken up as they tried to
escape the oncoming car, said
DeSmidt.
In all. 13 children and the SUV's
male driver were taken to area hospi
tals. according to Fire Chief Doug
Fry of the Bclmont-San Carlos Fire
Department. Seven were taken to

trauma centers presenting problems
that ranged from broken bones to in
ternal injuries. Fry said.
"All I can say is for some un
known reason the SUV lost control "
Fry said.
The SUV's driver was at the
school in Belmont, located about 25
miles south of San Francisco, to pick
up a student, although DeSmidt said
lie did not know his relationship to
the youngster.
hie Honda was registered to
Mauro 11. Yan and Lorenza Y. Yan.of
Redwood Shores, according to the
Department of Motor Vehicles. A
woman who identified herself as
Mauro Yan's wife but would not give
her name told the San Francisco
Chronicle that her 70-year-old hus
band was the driver and he thought
the SUV's brakes had failed.
At the scene, investigators
combed through debris spread over
a 30-foot-wide radius, including the
SUV's front grill and discarded
sneakers and backpacks. They noted
the absence of skid marks that would
have indicated the driver tried to
stop, but said it was too soon to draw
conclusions about what that meant.
"It certainly all falls into the in

vestigation. but at this point we have
no cause to believe it was an inten
tional act." DeSmidt said.
Parents and school staff members
who saw the students get hit used a
jack and their collective muscle to lift
the SUV off the trapped children, he
said. The youngsters may have es
caped getting crushed because of the
vehicle's relatively high clearance
and their comparatively small size.
"They are little kids and they can
fortunately fit under there." he said.
Head custodian and track coach
Andre Edwards said a student he
pulled from under the SUV was
bleeding but conscious.
"You don't think. You just react."
Edwards said.
Four 14-year-old boys were ad
mitted to Stanford Medical Center,
and later transferred to Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital at Stan
ford because of their ages, said Jon
nie Banks, a medical center spokes
woman. One of the boys had his liver
lacerated in two places and suffered
a broken leg: another boy required
20-to-30 stitches to close a deep lac
eration on his head and leg; a third
boy suffered a fractured pelvis and
the fourth a head injury. Banks said.
