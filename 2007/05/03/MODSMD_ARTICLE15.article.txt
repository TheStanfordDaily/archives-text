### 
LAS VEGAS (A.P.) — A Neva
da university regent wants to allow
campus employees to be deputized
and armed to respond with force to a
college shooting.
Regent Stavros Anthony, a Las
Vegas police captain, said he'll pro
pose the Nevada System of Higher
Education allow employees from
faculty members to maintenance
workers to be certified as reserve po
lice officers.
They could be armed because
state law allows police officers to
carry a gun on university system
property.
"From my standpoint, 1 see this as
kind of a win-win," Anthony told the

Las Vegas Review-Journal for a
Wednesday report. "You're allowing
institution employees to step up to
the plate and say.Tm for standing up
and defending oar institution."'
The proposal is receiving support
from university Chancellor Jim
Rogers, and Anthony said University
of Nevada, Las Vegas Police Chief
Jose Elique was enthusiastic about it.
"I think it's the system's invest
ment to take care of the safety of the
people on campus." Rogers said.
The proposal to give employees
police powers, he said, is a reaction to
last month's shootings at Virginia
Tech. in which a gunman killed 32
people and himself.
