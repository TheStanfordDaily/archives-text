## Editorial Board ASSU Senate abstentions let students down 
### 
An issue debated by a student govern
ment rarely attracts as much atten
tion as the outgoing ASSU Senate's
rejection of a watered down resolution call
ing for the University to reevaluate its in
vestments in Israel and Palestine. Divest
ment presented the Senate with a unique op
portunits to shape a decision —one way or
the other — with real, if only symbolic, sig
nificance.
Given the importance of the divestment
resolution, we are perplexed by the deci
sions ol five A SSI 1 senators (of 13 who were
eligible) to abstain from voting on divest
ment. Abstentions by public officials are
supposed to be uncommon in a democratic
system. Voters choose to support a candi
date partly on the basis of his or her cam
paign platform and governing ideals. Voters
subsequently expect their elected officials to
legislate and vote in a manner consistent
with the philosophies on which those in
power campaigned.
An abstention, absent an accompanying
rationalization, tails to convey any informa
tion about an elected official's beliefs on the
topic at hand. Constituents do not know
whether the official is skirting the issue due
to fear ol alienating some interest group,
whether she is trying to make a salient point
in a roundabout way or whether she is sim
ply too lazy or ambivalent to read up on the
bill.To pass the buck — particularly on such
a high-profile resolution as divestment — is
to default on the responsibilities that voters
have invested in an elected official.
There are, of course, some exceptional
situations in which an abstention is appro
priate. 112 or instance, ASSU senators com
monly abstain from funding bills for student
groups with which they have a conflict of in
terest.
In the case of divestment, the five sena
tors' rationales for abstaining were not read
ily clear but seem to fall along three lines of
reasoning, l-irst,at least one abstaining sena
tor felt that the divestment bill was too com
plex to vote on.This explanation is unsatis
factory. The call lor divestment was initiated
in late January and did not culminate in a
floor vote until mid-April— senators had

nearly three months and ample opportunity
to educate themselves.
Second, some senators may have chosen
to abstain to avoid alienating large portions
of the student body. It is understandable that
senators seek to ingratiate themselves with
diverse groups of students. Hut when the
time comes to vote, those who have the priv
ilege of serving their peers must be prepared
to make tough decisions.
A third possible justification reckons that
an abstention signified a senator's belief that
discussion of divestment from Israel has no
rightful place in the Senate, that divestment
transcends the scope of the ASSU. If this is
the case, a "no" vote would convey precisely
the same message without the ambiguity of
an abstention. In fact, due to a provision re
quiring "yes" votes from two-thirds of sena
tors in attendance to pass a resolution,an ab
stention was tantamount to a "no" vote in
terms of its impact on the ultimate outcome.
Whatever the abstaining senators' reason
ing. students deserve to know more.
Controversy over abstentions extends
beyond campus politics. U.S. Senator and
presidential candidate John McCain drew
criticism last week for abstaining from an
Iraq war appropriations bill that tied troop
funding to a deadline for withdrawal. In
skirting the issue. McCain may have avoided
a potentially crushing blow to his campaign,
lint his decision did little to enhance his
image.
Just as a U.S. senator ought to be present
for a major vote, so too should an ASSU sen
ator feel obliged to vote "yes" or "no" on an
issue as high profile as divestment. What is
more, ASSU senators — unlike their coun
terparts in Washington. D.C. — rarely run
for re-election. Because they are typically in
sulated from the demands of re-election,
senators should theoretically be free to vote
their consciences.
fortunately, the mass abstentions from
the divestment vote appear to be an anom
aly— which, given the innocuous nature of
most Senate bills, hardly comes as a surprise.
Hie incoming Senate would do well to en
sure that the recent abstentions do not be
come a precedent.
