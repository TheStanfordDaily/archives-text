# What I should have been taught in college

You all know him. He is an electrical
engineering and math double major.
I le never goes out. is already going a
little gray around the ears and has exactly
three long chin hairs, which he never shaves.
()i perhaps he has never looked in a mirror,
so it's hard to say it he has ever noticed that
he should shave. (Tweezing would really be
easier.) Everyone who has ever been in a
class with him whispers that he is silently
brilliant and is the best thing that has hap
pened to the EE department since they fig
ured out how to light the fuse box when the
electricity goes out. Then again, if you
added the time you spent on Facebook to
the time you spend at Pub Night, having
conversations and shaving, you might have
straight A-t-'s. too (or so rumor of his 4.3
GPA has it.)
Iliere are too many hims, however. Stu
dents who know nothing but how to prove
Stokes' theorem on General Manifolds or
resolve the twin paradox in special relativi
ty. (If you were to ask me about relativity. 1
would tell you we actually aren't sisters, we
just look alike.)
I am not the most well-rounded student
— I had never done a problem set until this
quarter (here's to CSIOS). I'll admit. I
should have had to take an applied science
course years before, just as Nerdy McChin-
Hair should have been forced to analyze lit
erature or buy a brush. We do have GERs.
which were created and imposed for this
exact purpose, to get us to take classes that
are informative and important yet not in
our particular area of study, but they aren't
enough. Our newly named but same-old
same-old general eds are a too-feeble nod
to the philosophy of well-rounded-students,
however. As a humanities major. I am re
quircd to take three science classes, a paltry
1/lhtli of my Stanford career, to cover the
rather broad subject that is science. Techie
students are required to enroll in three hu
manities classes and two classes on culture,
an equally brief attempt to cover the litera
ture, societies, histories, philosophies and
religions of the world. (And, of course, if
you play your GER cards right, a cross-cat
egorized class will, in fact, count as two re
quirements.)
We should be forced to learn so much
more! I should have had/1 wish I had/ we all
should have a solid background in Western
civilization. God knows I know next to

nothing about the Greeks and Romans
(Achilles had a bad ankle), although their
breath taking achievements are the impe
tus for nearly everything else to come in
Western culture. I wish I knew modern Eu
ropean history, not to mention classical
mythology. Everyone should have to take
an art appreciation class. We should take
two years of a foreign language. Language
isn't just a skill, it's a new way of thinking,
and one year barely gives you the skills to
haltingly ask how to find the bathroom.
Overseas study should be mandatory.
You know who needs to go abroad the
most? Those who don't. One of my greatest
regrets at Stanford is not taking a religion or
philosophy class. What is the difference be
tween a Lutheran and a Baptist? I have no
idea, just like I am equally clueless on
I lume's theories versus Kant's. Shouldn't I
know some basic theories on the meaning
of life? Teach me earth systems, llirn those
eight activity units into mandatory PE class
es.
Stanford, make us learn the stuff we
don t want to. Make us learn the things we
want to learn, too, but never did. Granted, I
was given the opportunity to enroll in what
ever classes I wanted — 1 could have signed
myself up tor that religion course. I am as
human as the next, though, and. in the end.
I won't do the things I know I should. We all
know how to be tit and lean.too,yet most of
us are still trying to lose that freshman 15,0r
five,or 50. Stick those vegetables in my face,
Stanford. Require me. strong arm me, and
don't let me graduate until I have a greater,
fuller understanding of my culture, history,
and environment.
I can hear the protests already.above the
pre-existing warbling moans against PWR
and 111 l JM — engineers don't have time to
dilly-dally in Santiago, and the passionate,
highly focused students won't be able to
