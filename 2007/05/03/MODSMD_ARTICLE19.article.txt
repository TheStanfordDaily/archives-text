# Draft day reflections
## 
### 
Ah, draft day. It's the most exciting time of
the year for a reason. Media pundits,
college students, and even government
officials watch this highly exhilarating pageant
of talent. Just seeing the story unfold on TV is a
real thrill.soyoucan imagine my excitement this
year when I was actually assigned to cover the
event. I'm talking, of course, of the Teachers'
Draft.
For those unfamiliar with the National
leacher 1 .eague's draft day, the rules are simple.
It's considered the most important day in educa
tion every year as high schools and grade schools
select the best and brightest teachers.
Recent rule changes are due in large part to
several private schools getting the best teachers
year after year.'lhankfully. with the draft system,
that common occurrence no longer happens.
The selection orders are decided by lottery;
schools that finished last year in the bottom per
centages of national testing get first picks. If
you've suffered several seasons of mediocre ac
ademia and may face the wrath of the No Child
Ix'ft Behind Act. then this is. well, pretty much
your last hope.
This has been a controversial year already.
Many have accused schools,particularly those in
celtic — sorry, central — parts of Boston, of
"throwing" the season, scrambling to lower their
scores by giving days off to the smart kids and
handing test takers not pencils, but crayons, line
thinking is the short-term losses will be made up
for by securing a high pick.quality teacher.
I traveled to New York to view the festivities.
Crowds throng the city streets, sporting their
school's colors. Inside, however, it's a different
story. Gaggles of principals and headmasters
congregate for the different schools, strategizing
their pick orders. It's a sea of tweed jackets and
sweaters.
Excitement builds as the first school goes on
the clock. The number one pick goes to the
East River I ligh Eagles (SJ,CA); as expected.

they went with a geometry teacher, addressing a
math department that has been sub-par all of
last year. John Fielding has had a spectacular col
lege career, ranking in the top of his class all four
years and setting records in grading turnover
and GPA. I lis returning skills are legendary —
he can return assignments at an average of 2.(i
hrs after deadline — just staggering. While the
cameras click, the new teacher proudly holds up
a tie with the school's emblem and his new park
ing pass.
Summit. New Jersey, has the next pick. Prin
cipal Leonard Fillmore is approaching the podi
um. all smiles. I le knows who he's getting. Yep.
it's Tiffany 1 lall.a former lawyer turned teacher
who wants to right her karma after years in the
celebrity litigation business. Fillmore has to be
happy with his pick, I iall can play both the work
horse history teacher and is a fine mentor to
young women. She was lights out for her debate
abilities during the skills combine.and isn't a bad
field hockey coach,either. A great pick.
Well, our first surprise of the evening at num
ber 5! Principal Sally Grace-Allen of Newsome
1 ligh (PA) has selected Victoria I lampton. a cu
rious choice to say the least.The Newsome fans
are booing, thinking this is another example of a
long line of poor draft choices. I lampton got her
master's in education and has experience tutor
ing. which the scouts love, but she struggles with
cheat stopping, giving up a whopping .3 in grade
inflation last year. There is far better talent still

on the board. I guess they're addressing a posi
tion need, but a trade would have suited them
better. Newsome fansean't be happy.They want
ed a Peter Keating, and instead it seems like
they're getting a Debra Lafave.
OuchlAndTim Beasley slips to the 12th pick.
Poor kid's been sweating all day. 1 guess those
character issues finally caught up with him. One
improperly cited source in a sophomore-year
paper and now Oakland Country Day is taking
him. 1 Ie stands to lose virtually hundreds of dol
lars. The number one pick last year was paid
roughly $20,(XX) a year, and the ninth pick
around $18.(XX). Beasley is probably going to be
talked down to closer to 18k. just so Oakland
can afford to have a history program this year.
This reminds me of a young rookie named
Leslie Dennison. who slipped from the 2nd to
3rd round two years ago over character issues
While TAing. she failed to properly grant points
to a student on an extra credit assignment, and
that slipup definitely cost her draft position.
Well it's been an exciting draft day this year.
Ihe NTL draft will continue with rounds 2-28
over the next few days. Before I sign off, I want
to address some critics, if 1 may. Some have dis
agreed with our obsessive reporting of an event
that glorifies dishonesty, moderate to laughable
amounts of money, and education. Many people
feel it is wrong that we glorify teachers around
this time of year, creating an image of college as
nothing but a feeder to teaching careers full ol
glitz and national acclaim. Yet. as imperfect as
the system is. it's not so bad. Imagine a system
where college was undermined for athletic
splendor and the media glorified not educators,
but athletes. What a dark world that would be.

C hris respectfully congratulates the student
athletes who were taken in the draft recently,
but questions our collective lionizing of sports
icons rather than educators Send complaints to
