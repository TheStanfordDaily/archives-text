# Stanford lab makes it a reality
## The 						Virtual Human Interaction Lab uses virtual reality to study human social behaviors 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
McClatchy Hall's room 453 houses a treadmill, a
30-foot pit. a dark alley, a conference room,a highway
and a police station in a space not much larger than
two dorm rooms squeezed together. I low? The room
is home to the Virtual Human Interaction Lab
(Villi.) where Communications Prof. Jeremy
Bailenson and a team of researchers are observing
human interaction in the realm of virtual reality.
A few computers and one $25,000 virtual reality
helmet create all of the virtual scenarios. While there
are many labs worldwide that use similar equipment,
the Stanford lab is fundamentally different because it
focuses solely on human reactions, behaviors and de
cisions in virtual space, whereas other labs focus on

military simulations or virtual surgery.
Jesse Fox. a doctoral student in communications,
manages the lab.
"What's unique about our lab is that we are firmly
rooted in the communication discipline," she said.
"We focus on transformed social interactions, or how
our interactions with other people or virtual humans
have changed based on technology. We're very much
a social science lab, answering questions about
human behavior that haven't been explored before."
Bailenson began working in virtual reality nine
years ago when virtual interaction was considered
implausible.
"The idea of people spending time in virtual space
was still science fiction," he said. "But now, with the
amount of time people are spending in Second Life
and MySpace and Facebook, we're realizing that peo

pie have second virtual identities.That's helped us get
more attention."
VHIL is now in its fourth year and has attracted a
good deal of media attention. Recent articles in the
San Francisco Chronicle, Wired Magazine and Busi
ness Week, as well as segments on CNN and the Dis
covery Channel, have propelled the lab into the spot
light.
"We've always been doing very important work,"
Bailenson said. "It just takes a little while for people
to find out you're on the map. We're finally starting to
get some recognition."
The situations that can be created in an artificial
world are almost limitless, leading to research in a va
riety of different areas. Currently, the lab is perform-

ing studies ranging from education
simulations and police lineup re-cre
ations to automotive safety.
Fox said she is interested in the
health applications of the technolo
gy. She said she recently finished a
study in which subjects were shown
an avatar (or virtual representation)
of a person running on a treadmill.
"We found that when people saw
the representation of themselves
running, they exercised more in the
24 hours following the experiment."
she said. "This may be useful for de
veloping programs or developing
online support for people who are
trying to lose weight."
"[The research] is also useful in
combating the obesity epidemic, es
pecially with children." she added.
"Kids love video games, and if we
can get them more personally in
volved by putting their avatar in a
virtual space, maybe they'd be en
couraged to exercise more."
Applications for the new technol
ogy do not end with health and exer
cise.
"We're doing stuff with the auto
motive industry about creating vir
tual characters in cars to help you

drive better in terms of detecting
when you're tired and trying to alert
you to problems on the road."
Bailenson said.
The lab is also working on virtual
demos to treat people for phobias,
including a fear of heights, and other
specific situations, said Grace Joo
Ahn.a doctoral student in communi
cations. VIIIE is considering work
ing with labs in France, Tahiti and Ja
maica to explore the possibility of an
international HIV/AIDS study.
The researchers are also tackling
issues such as sexism, racism and
ageism by placing subjects into virtu
al bodies different from their own.
"People react to avatars as if they
are real people." Joo Ahn said. "It's
amazing that they know they're in
virtual reality yet they react with
everyday social behavior. 1 would
like to apply the findings to situa
tions where people can learn from
virtual reality environments."
In the near future, Bailenson pre
dicts, people's virtual identities will
play a larger role in their lives.
"Soon your cell phone will be able
to track your facial expressions and
send them to someone else," he said.
"We're going to see people, no matter
where they are in physical space, be
able to pop into virtual space."
