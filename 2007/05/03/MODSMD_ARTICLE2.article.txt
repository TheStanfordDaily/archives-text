# Stanford lab makes it a reality
## The
						Virtual Human Interaction Lab uses virtual reality to study human social behaviors

McClatchy Hall's room 453 houses a treadmill, a
30-foot pit. a dark alley, a conference room,a highway
and a police station in a space not much larger than
two dorm rooms squeezed together. I low? The room
is home to the Virtual Human Interaction Lab
(Villi.) where Communications Prof. Jeremy
Bailenson and a team of researchers are observing
human interaction in the realm of virtual reality.
A few computers and one $25,000 virtual reality
helmet create all of the virtual scenarios. While there
are many labs worldwide that use similar equipment,
the Stanford lab is fundamentally different because it
focuses solely on human reactions, behaviors and de
cisions in virtual space, whereas other labs focus on

military simulations or virtual surgery.
Jesse Fox. a doctoral student in communications,
manages the lab.
"What's unique about our lab is that we are firmly
rooted in the communication discipline," she said.
"We focus on transformed social interactions, or how
our interactions with other people or virtual humans
have changed based on technology. We're very much
a social science lab, answering questions about
human behavior that haven't been explored before."
Bailenson began working in virtual reality nine
years ago when virtual interaction was considered
implausible.
"The idea of people spending time in virtual space
was still science fiction," he said. "But now, with the
amount of time people are spending in Second Life
and MySpace and Facebook, we're realizing that peo

pie have second virtual identities.That's helped us get
more attention."
VHIL is now in its fourth year and has attracted a
good deal of media attention. Recent articles in the
San Francisco Chronicle, Wired Magazine and Busi
ness Week, as well as segments on CNN and the Dis
covery Channel, have propelled the lab into the spot
light.
"We've always been doing very important work,"
Bailenson said. "It just takes a little while for people
to find out you're on the map. We're finally starting to
get some recognition."
The situations that can be created in an artificial
world are almost limitless, leading to research in a va
riety of different areas. Currently, the lab is perform-

At the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab, a study participant dons special head gear that allows him to enter a virtual world. The center, located in the Mc-
Clatchy communications building, is doing state-of-the-art research on health, racism, sexism and a variety of topics that can be tested through simulation.
