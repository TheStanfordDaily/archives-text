## Divestment defeated for good reason; let's move on together 
### CARRIE MLYNARCZYK MARK DONIG 
We were disappointed that Nabill Idrisi,
Melissa Morales and Lisa Llanos (Op-Ed,
April 24) insulted the intelligence of the
student senators and Daily readers by
questioning the student senators who
voted to defeat the divestment bill last
week. Those who voted "no" probably
have a deeper understanding of the Mid
dle East than others, and knew that the
bill represents flawed thinking that would
not lead to the stated aims. Perhaps those

who abstained simply understood enough
to know that the bill contained some half
truths. and excluded much relevant con
text relating to the situation, and we ap
plaud their abstention votes on that basis.
What is even more shocking, and dis
turbing. however, is the authors' refer
ence to the 25-year long struggle to se
cure divestment from South Africa.
There are two disturbing problems with
this:
First. Israel is not South Africa. The
Apartheid South African regime had no
desire or motivation to change its politi
cal structure before international pres

sure w;is applied. Hy stark contrast, Is
raelis themselves recently expressed their
willingness to make painful concessions
for peace with the Palestinians. In the last
election, current Israeli Prime Minister
I hud Olmert was voted into office on a
platform of withdrawal from Gaza and
the West Bank. Sadly, the Oaza with
drawal was met by rockets that were
launched from Gaza into civilian areas in
Israel, and the Palestinians elected a gov
ernment that does not recognize Israel's
right to exist and is led hy an organization
that is internationally recognized
as a terrorist organization. We
hope that moderate Palestinians
will receive the support they need
to chart a different course for the
future.
Second, and more importantly, we
are hopeful that 25 years from
now this conversation will he a
distant memory as it is our hope
that newly restarted negotiation
efforts will result in a thriving and
secure Palestinian state alongside
a thriving and secure state of Is
rael long before then. And. what a
disgrace it would be if we as a
campus community were to
squander our precious time and
energy for 25 more years talking
about a one-sided divestment
campaign, rather than use that
time and energy to support pro
ductive efforts for peace in the re
gion!
This past October, the Jewish
Students Association and the
Stanford Israel Alliance were
pleased that the Coalition for Jus
tice in the Middle East joined with
them to cosponsor an event that
brought representatives from
One Voice, a group that unites
Palestinians and Israelis who are
working together towards peace

in the region. We are thrilled that
this on-campus partnership was
successful and that these groups
came together for this program,
hut we were disappointed with the
low turnout from the segment of
the campus community that talks
about wanting peace for the Pales
tinians, but spends most of their
energy solely attacking Israel.
Did you know that this Septem
ber. hundreds of thousands of
youth activists in Palestine and Is
rael will be mobilizing their com
munities to support a two state so
lution? Ditl you know that there
exist organizations such as Ish
mael and Isaac that promote col
laborative productive projects be
tween the American Arab and
American Jewish community to
help promote peace between
Palestinians and Israelis?
How might the Stanford com
munity model itself after these ef
forts, and contribute to these ef
forts? How can we turn down the
volume on unproductive efforts
that one-sidedly vilify Israel and
consume so much of the precious
time and energy of Stanford stu
dents? How can we redirect that
time and energy towards mutual
projects that actually might make
a positive difference? Perhaps we
can have a Town Hall on that?
