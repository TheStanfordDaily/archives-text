### WES MATEO 
For Stanford women's
water polo's four sen
iors, next weekend's
NCAA Championships
will he a bittersweet last
hurrah. Iliey will lace up their
Cardinal caps for the last few
times, aiming to bring a national
title back to the Farm for the first
time in their careers.
Ihese four seasoned veterans

— driver Katie Hansen, two-meter Christina Hcwko, goalie
Meridith McColl and two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
— lead a Cardinal squad that is seeded No. 1 in the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since 2002, the year before the
four arrived at Stanford.
The top seed was no surprise to the quartet. In the water.

The top seed was no surprise to

quite literally do it all for
Stanford.

Hansen guides the of
fense from the perimeter,
controlling the pace of play
and providing a cannon of
a right arm that has pro
duced 173 career goals.
Mewko's scoring ability at
set has earned her two Ail-
American honors while
Gregorka anchors Stan
ford's field defense, shut-

ting down opponents' best
players at the two-meter mark. McColl. a four-year starter,
has only improved with age, at times single-handedly keeping
the Cardinal in tight games.
But despite their individual accolades, all four speak first
about their team.That attitude comes as no surprise to head
coach John Tanner, who praised his veterans.
