## Gregorka, Hansen, Hewko, McColl Senior Spirit Leads Polo 
### WES MATEO 
For Stanford women's
water polo's four sen
iors, next weekend's
NCAA Championships
will he a bittersweet last
hurrah. Iliey will lace up their
Cardinal caps for the last few
times, aiming to bring a national
title back to the Farm for the first
time in their careers.
Ihese four seasoned veterans

— driver Katie Hansen, two-meter Christina Hcwko, goalie
Meridith McColl and two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
— lead a Cardinal squad that is seeded No. 1 in the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since 2002, the year before the
four arrived at Stanford.
The top seed was no surprise to the quartet. In the water.

Hansen guides the of
fense from the perimeter,
controlling the pace of play
and providing a cannon of
a right arm that has pro
duced 173 career goals.
Mewko's scoring ability at
set has earned her two Ail-
American honors while
Gregorka anchors Stan
ford's field defense, shut-

ting down opponents' best
players at the two-meter mark. McColl. a four-year starter,
has only improved with age, at times single-handedly keeping
the Cardinal in tight games.
But despite their individual accolades, all four speak first
about their team.That attitude comes as no surprise to head
coach John Tanner, who praised his veterans.

Seniors Meridith McColl, Katie Hansen, Allison Gregorka and Christina Hewko huddle against San Jose State on Apr. 21. The
veteran quartet has led the Cardinal to the top seed in the upcoming NCAA Tournament.
"They're happy to fulfill their
roles; they do their jobs really well,
and they take great pride in that."
Fanner said. "But they also relish
being a part of something that is far
greater, so [they're] happy to be be
hind the scenes and don't need to
have attention."
Not surprisingly, the seniors'
leadership has extended outside the
confines of the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter. ITiey have guided this year's
squad toward an identity, creating

the same sense of unity that initially
drew them to Stanford.
"I feel like the people who end up
here are kind of a different breed in
general," Gregorka said. "We
choose to hang out with each other
out of the water, which certainly
isn't something everyone does, and 1
think that team dynamic [really] car
ries over into the water."
Tanner also attested to the suc
cess the four seniors have had in
uniting this team, forging them into
NCAA-title frontrunners.
"All four of our seniors bring
very distinct backgrounds and influ
ence on things away from the pool,"
he said. "I think any team is success
ful only as much as the members of

the team are committed to one an
other beyond just the games when
fans are there."
The team named Gregorka and
Hansen its captains, but Gregorka
said that leadership has been a col
lective effort.
"Yes. Katie and 1 are written
down as being the captains, but 1 feel
like all four of us have a very equal
role," she said. "I honestly think that
the four seniors have sort of made a
pact to lead it together this year."
Gregorka added that becoming a
senior has altered her perception of
the team.
"I've always looked up to the up
perclassmen, especially as a fresh
man and sophomore," she said.

"They knew the rules, the system,
the coaches and how to get everyone
involved and a part of the team.
Being one now is a little funny, espe
cially knowing that we are the oldest
and that is it our responsibility to
take on the role of being the leaders,
not only by example, but also by
being the enforcers, more or less."
Whatever formula McColl,
Hewko, Hansen and Gregorka have
applied this season, there's no doubt
as to its efficacy. So regardless of the
outcome next weekend, perhaps
that result will stand as most impor
tant of all.
