### MOHAMMAD ALI 
Until a few years ago, senior Feranmi
Okanlami had no idea he could he the
captain of Stanford track and field.
Okanlami claims to have been unath
letic until the third grade,and he didn't
even start the triple jump until sophomore year of
high school.
"My parents did not want me to play sports."
Okanlami said. "We're from a traditional Nigerian
family, where academics come before anything
else."
Sure enough. Okanlami attended boarding
school in Indiana from when he was 13 until he
moved to Stanford to continue his education. In
high school, he played lacrosse and golf, sang in the
chorus.danced, acted and played percussion.
After seeing him dunk, though.Okanlami's best
friend encouraged the high-school sophomore to
join the track and field team and compete in the
long jump, triple jump and high jump. The rest, as
they say, is history.
Okanlami has disciplined himself enough to be
a team leader on the field and inside the classroom.
With a place in the Stanford record books for both
the indoor and outdoor triple jump, he seems
poised to continue his success.
"I plan on breaking the record this year," Okan
lami said.
Hut the Cardinal senior's ambitions run deeper
than athletics. (irowing up with two doctors as par
ents. Feranmi discovered an emotional side to the
profession, which he's cultivated as a major in In
terdisciplinary Studies in I lumanities for pre-meds.
"I want to be a great physician so that I can see

the human side," said Okan
lami. who will he writing an
honors thesis this spring on
medical narratives.
Having taken medical ethics
and philosophy classes, Okanlami
felt prepared to apply for med
ical school this year as a
well-rounded candidate.
And he was successful:
Okanlami plans to at
tend either Yale Uni
versity School of
Medicine or Uni
versity of Michigan
Medical School.

Professional am
bitions aside, Okanlami recognizes the im
port a nee of track.

"It is part of who I am," he said. "Other people
have their specialties; this is just something I do. I
run."
Rather than being recruited like other athletes.
Okanlami came to visit Stanford on his own initia
tive and talked to head coach Edrick Moreal about
how to balance academic and athletic responsibili
ties.
"Coach convinced me that I would be a student
athlete. not an athlete-student." Okanlami said.
"The coaches respect that the players here are here
to get a degree."
Despite these assurances, Okanlami has had to
work hard to balance out sports and academics.
"You can't do everything and expect to do
