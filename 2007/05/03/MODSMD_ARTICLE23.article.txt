## Chemistry Rallies Women 
### JACK SALISBURY 
Building a 106-1 record over
four years obviously takes
a wealth of talent, dedica
tion and sound coaching.
But it takes more than that.
Plenty ol college programs around the
country, in all sports, have the elements of
championship success. Most come away
empty-handed, though. Just ask ()hio State.
Sometimes, you need that extra chem
istry. that extra camaraderie between team
mates to give you that final boost when your
team needs it most.
In winning the last three national titles,
it's safe to say that Stanford women's tennis
team has had all of the necessary elements.
Maybe more than anything else, though, the
Cardinal has gotten a boost from the close
ness between teammates, both on and off
the court.
One need look no further than a recent
match against an in-state rival. The match
was locked at 3-3, meaning that the final sin
gles match between senior co-captain Anne
Yelsey and her opponent would determine
the outcome of the whole match.
Yelsey explained the disparity between
the Stanford bench and the bench of her op
ponent.
"On our sideline, we were cheering as
hard as wecould;on the other side of the net.
the other team just wasn't doing that," she
said. "You just didn't think that the other
|bench| believed their player would win.
I bat's what it comes down to: We always be

lieve in each other."
Winning tight matches Ikis been a consis
tent theme for Stanford in a year when they
have battled injuries and illness for the
whole season. I br the Cardinal, 4-3 matches
have been commonplace; unlike most
teams.though, the girls relish the opportuni
ty to come through in the clutch for their
teammates.
"You have five other reasons to win that
match, besides just winning it for yourself,"
Ireshman Lindsay Burdette said. "You want
to win because everybody else is in the light
with you. We spend a lot of time together.
