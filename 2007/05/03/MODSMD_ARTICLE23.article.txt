## Chemistry Rallies Women 
### JACK SALISBURY 
Building a 106-1 record over
four years obviously takes
a wealth of talent, dedica
tion and sound coaching.
But it takes more than that.
Plenty ol college programs around the
country, in all sports, have the elements of
championship success. Most come away
empty-handed, though. Just ask ()hio State.
Sometimes, you need that extra chem
istry. that extra camaraderie between team
mates to give you that final boost when your
team needs it most.
In winning the last three national titles,
it's safe to say that Stanford women's tennis
team has had all of the necessary elements.
Maybe more than anything else, though, the
Cardinal has gotten a boost from the close
ness between teammates, both on and off
the court.
One need look no further than a recent
match against an in-state rival. The match
was locked at 3-3, meaning that the final sin
gles match between senior co-captain Anne
Yelsey and her opponent would determine
the outcome of the whole match.
Yelsey explained the disparity between
the Stanford bench and the bench of her op
ponent.
"On our sideline, we were cheering as
hard as wecould;on the other side of the net.
the other team just wasn't doing that," she
said. "You just didn't think that the other
|bench| believed their player would win.
I bat's what it comes down to: We always be

lieve in each other."
Winning tight matches Ikis been a consis
tent theme for Stanford in a year when they
have battled injuries and illness for the
whole season. I br the Cardinal, 4-3 matches
have been commonplace; unlike most
teams.though, the girls relish the opportuni
ty to come through in the clutch for their
teammates.
"You have five other reasons to win that
match, besides just winning it for yourself,"
Ireshman Lindsay Burdette said. "You want
to win because everybody else is in the light
with you. We spend a lot of time together.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
and that translates into us wanting to
do well for each other."
Off the court, the women share
just as strong ties.They bake for each
player on their birthdays and often
spend time together in the summer,
working on their game. In recent
years, the top-ranked team in the na
tion has traveled around the world
together, including trips to France,
Italy and the Cardinal's annual
Thanksgiving trip to I lawaii.
It also helps that Stanford rarely
ever loses as a team — the women
have won 106 out of their last 107
matches. Winning always tends to
breed camaraderie and bring team
members together.
And for this year's team in partic
ular. having only eight players has
added to the group's cohesiveness.
After losing four seniors from last
season and adding only one fresh
man. Stanford's bench is among the
shortest in the nation. Many other
programs feature line-ups with 10, or
even 12, players.
"This is the smallest team I've
ever been on." Yelsey said. "Eight
players is a huge thing to note. It's
created a different dimension that is

really cool."
Both Burdette and Yelsey agreed
that it all starts with recruiting the
right kind of players who comple
ment each other and fit in the Stan
ford environment.
"When [the coaches] recruit peo
ple, they make sure the personalities
fit on the team," Yelsey said. "Flayers
are here for a common goal. A lot of
coaches go out there and recruit any
body. They might just not be a good
fit on the team. A lot of people don't
take that into consideration. It all
starts with the recruiting."
In just a few weeks, the Cardinal
will face its biggest test of the year:
the NCAA Tournament. Most teams
would feel the pressure of trying to
win their fourth straight national
title in a 64-team tournament, but
the women are confident in each
other and intent on bringing home
the championship. The team's cohe
siveness may well come up big in the
tough matches Stanford expects.
"In the past, we've had some pret
ty dominating teams," Yesley said.
"This year, we've had a lot of close
matches. [The team's closeness]
helps you dig a little deeper. When
you're about to lose, knowing that
people are relying on you. you put in
your extra little bit."
