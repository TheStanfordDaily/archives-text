# Eric McKean, Dave Ryan
## Side By Side FRAT BROTHERS AND CHAMPIONS, BUT ABOVE ALL FRIENDS 
### ELIZABETH PRATT 
Seniors Eric McKean and Dave Ryan of
the men's tennis team have been friends
for over seven years and Sigma Nu
brothers for three, but not since their
freshman year of high school have they
been side-by-side on the court.
I ricnds since their days playing junior tennis,
the duo 111st played doubles together at the Cali
fornia state championships in 2(MX). They haven't
played ;»s a tandem since.
That was until this past weekend, when Ryan
and McKean teamed up for the invitational dou
bles contest at the Pacific- lOC'onferencc ('hampi

unships. In their last chance as Cardinal seniors,
they made an outstanding run to the finals before
falling to Washington's Derek Drabble and Andy
Kuharszky.
"We played really solid, and it helped to know
each other so well because we were comfortable
with each othei in stressful moments," Ryan said.
"It was pretty special to go out together,doing as
well as we did."
Pairing up for their final chance at a Pac-10
title, the duo also made a lasting impression on as
sistant coach David Hodge.
"I ric and Dave did great," Hodge said. "They

beat a very good Cal team, they beat
a very good USC team — they com
peted really well."
McKean, this year's team captain,
played at almost every spot on the
Cardinal's (8-16, 2-5 Pac-10) lineup
this season. At various times, he
played N0.2, No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5
singles, enjoying the most success at
No. 4. His singles record overall for
this season is 12-21: in dual matches,
he went 7-16.
In individual tournament play,
McKean s overall record is 5-4, in
cluding a run to the Round of 16 of
the ITA Northwest Regionals last
Fall. In doubles, he has teamed with a
number of other players at both the
No. 2 and No. 3 spots in the lineup.
Partnering with sophomore Jeff
Zeller, he defeated the 2006 Pac-10
doubles champions, Mathieu De
haine and Jeremy Drean of UCLA,
earlier in the season.
Ryan is quick to praise his long
time friend, noting his improved ag
gressiveness in four years with the
Cardinal.
"He's playing a bigger game
now," Ryan said. "He's been able to
play a more imposing game, dictat
ing with his serve and ground
strokes."
Another on-court attribute that
helps McKean is his competitive
ness.
"Eric never is okay with losing,"
Ryan added. "And regardless of the
overall match situation, everyone on
the team knows he wants to win as
bad as ever."
Ryan himself came to the Cardi
nal as a true walk-on in his sopho
more year. Three years later, he has
competed for the Cardinal in singles
at the No. 5 and No. 6 slots. His dual
match record is 2-7, but both of his
wins clinched team victories for
Stanford. And in the invitational sin
gles tournament at the Pac-10 cham

pionships last weekend, he stormed
to the quarterfinals before being
taken out by eventual champion
Jason McNaughton of Southern Cal
ifornia.
Citing both their accomplish
ments, Hodge had words of praise
for the team's seniors.
"Eric has done so much for us the
last four years, on the court and off
the court,"he said. "And Dave came
in as a true walk-on, which is really
hard to do — but he worked really
hard, and he's become a really legiti
mate Division-1 tennis player."
While good players and team
mates, Ryan and McKean are even
better friends. Off the court, McK
ean said Ryan's best personality trait
is his sense of humor.
"Dave is very witty and is the
complete opposite of a lfun-vacu
um,' as we say on the team," the sen
ior joked.
With their Stanford careers near
ing an end, the end of the Cardinal's
season has been a time for reflection
and regrets. Among the latter would
be Stanford's failed NCAA bid this
year.
"1 wish I would have won an
NCAA title," McKean said. "But I
know the guys will give it a good run
next year."
Ryan, though, has no regrets, hav
ing simply enjoyed the time he spent
with McKean and other teammates.
"[The past few years have]
helped me get better at focusing on
what I'm doing while I'm doing it:
and not having class bothering me
on the court or tennis bothering me
in class, I learned to get the most out
of each one of those things," he said.
This past weekend's run to a Pac
-10 doubles title is just one of those
experiences that McKean will also
cherish.
"It was quite fitting to end my
tennis career with Dave," McKean
said. "It was a blast getting to the fi
nals. and I'll never forget that last
tournament."
