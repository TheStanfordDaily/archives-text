a convincing, five-second win over the Beavers
(6:13.33 to 6:18.90); the men's junior varsity and
novice teams easily handled OSU by two sec

men's and women's eight teams in the Big Row.

lengths ahead. Stanford came in at 6:55.77 while
the Beavers finished in second (7:(X).30) and the
Cougars trailed behind (7:07.40).
"This week in practice, our boat really came
together and focused on making positive
changes that we felt on the water today," junior

pleased with our ability to jump into a solid and
sustainable rhythm right off the start."
The women's varsity four also conquered two
OSU teams and Washington State by a seven

for the women's second varsity eight, which
