# GRADUATE LIFE
## GSC votes to create pub night for grad students Two bar outings scheduled for May, trying something new 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's going to be like Pub Night, except for
dissertation-driven graduate students rather
than slacking seniors.
ITie Graduate Student Council (GSC)
voted last night to fund two off-campus
events this month at local bars, suggesting
that the practice could become something
more regular, like Thursday "Senior Nights"
for undergraduates.The events will be exclu
sively for graduate students.
Organized by the Graduate Student Pro
gramming Board (GSPB), one "Graduate
Pub Night" is scheduled for May 17 at the
Palo Alto bar Nola's while another outing is
tentatively scheduled for May 31. Bus trans

portation tor the night will be available from
campus and back, and students will enjoy
drink specials at Nola's. including $2 beers.
According to GSPB member and event
organizer Annemarie Baltay, the goal is to
have a night during which both on-campus
and off-campus graduate students can relax
and have a drink together.
And if all goes well, graduate student
leaders say pub nights might become a sta
ple of graduate life.
"We could make this regular, like seniors
have Senior Night." suggested GSC member
Fen Zhao.
Organizers said they might consider
moving the events, which are currently slat
ed forThursdays,toa different night. Adding
another off-campus event to Thursdays —
the same day as Senior Nights — could
prove problematic on the transportation
front.
The total expected cost for the
two nights is $1,291. of which the
GSC will pay half; the GSPB will
fund the remainder.
And with the intention to create
a graduate-only event, combining it
with Senior Night was not a consid
eration.
GSC member Adam Beberg
joked, "Don't go where they [sen
iors] are going."
