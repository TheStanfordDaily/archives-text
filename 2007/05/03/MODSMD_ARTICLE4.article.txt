## SU Wiki creators revamping site to get more visitors, editors 
### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Reeling from a lackluster start, the creators of the Stanford
Wiki — inspired by the popular user-driven online encyclope
dia Wikipedia— plan to give the Web site a facelift to boost
membership and increase networking opportunities.
The Stanford Wiki. which can be accessed at http://stan
ford.wikia.com. allows students to share information about
restaurants.classes, internships and more. Wikia co-founder An
gela Beesley said that new features will be added in the coming
months that will allow for blogging, networking and informa
tional opportunities.
Students will soon be able to access a "send to a friend" fea
ture that will enable them to encourage their friends to help edit
an article.
The site will also feature a new skin and a voting tool.ensur
ing that the most popular articles are prominently displayed, ac
cording to Wikia employee Angie Shelton MBA 'Oh.
The site's administrators hope these changes will boost the
site's popularity, which has been low since its inception.
"1 wouldn't call Stanford the most active Wiki we have,"
Shelton quipped.
Since the wiki relies on students to edit pages and provide in
formation, its lack of popularity equates to fewer editors.
Some students also criticized the site for not being user
friendly and lacking content that's
meaningful to many readers.
Students who want to edit arti
cles must first register their Uni
versity email address, which
Beesley said might be a time-con
suming "barrier to entry."
"I think if there is more infor
mation about, for example, class or
professor reviews, there would be
more of an incentive to use it," said
Victor Akabutu 10.
Shelton hypothesized that the
site's slow growth might be due to
limited advertising. To drive down
costs, Wikia does not spend any
money on advertising. It relies, in
stead, on word-of-mouth to spur
growth, she said.
Shelton added that the Stan
lord Wiki's success will depend on

students embracing the idea and
writing a majority of the articles to
improve the quality and quantity
of information on the site.
"If you have a passion about
Stanford," she said, "we are look
ing for you to help this Wiki grow
and thrive."
