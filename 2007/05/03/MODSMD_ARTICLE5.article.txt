### YONI TIETELBAUM 
Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina '76 spoke
about what it takes to be a leader and about the path to success
for women in the business world yesterday afternoon as part of
the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar lecture series.
A leader, according to Fiorina, is someone who sees possi
bilities.
"Everyone is afraid of something." she said. "As a leader, you
have to know that your colleagues and coworkers are afraid.
You have to know what they're afraid of and give them a vision
of something worth striving for."
She also said that leaders must be flexible and must have
the ability to work with many different types of people, priori
tizing talent over more superficial attributes such as gender or
race.
"Diversity is not a matter of fairness or equal opportunity
anymore," she said. "Diversity is about winning. We have to
leverage diversity, and we no longer have the luxury of bias."
During a question-and-answer session after the talk in Ter
man Auditorium. Fiorina — who headed HP from 1999 to
2005 — described her experiences as a woman in what is tradi
tionally considered a man's world.
"Out of the top company executives. 1 6 percent are women
and 14 percent are minorities, and those statistics haven't
changed for the past two years." she said. "It's no longer about
unprepared women. People fear people who are different
from them."
Dana Nguyen '07, co-president of event co-sponsor Stan
ford Women in Business, said that the group's priorities are
closely tied to Fiorina's background.
"She's one of the quintessential businesswomen that our
generation grew up seeing," she said. "We're really trying to
promote the idea that women can succeed in business and not
necessarily through the traditional routes of consulting and in
vestment banking."
After graduating from Stanford. Fiorina entered the busi
ness world as a secretary.
Rishi Mandal '07 said he was impressed by the former CEO's
philosophy.
"It puts her career into perspective," he said.
Fiorina said she Imped the Q&A session would prove a
two-way learning experience.
"It's an opportunity to share some things I've learned," she
said, "but it's also an opportunity for me to learn from what
students ask me, and what they're concerned about."
