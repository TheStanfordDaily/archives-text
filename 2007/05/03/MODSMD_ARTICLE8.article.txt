Saudis crack down on Islamic militants, arrest 172

The Saudi Arabian government took 172 suspected Is
lamic militants into custody in a wave of arrests that took
place over the course of several months and covered many
different parts of the Kingdom, it announced on Friday. An
Interior Ministry spokesman identified those arrested as
suspected members of the "deviant group." the official
Saudi designation for al-Qaeda militants and sympathizers.
Both citizens and foreign nationals were targeted by the po
lice action, a sweeping reaction against a campaign of bomb
ings and shootings launched hv Islamic militants in May
2003.
According to the spokesman, militants were targeting
Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, and were planning the as
sassination of certain government officials as well as a series
of attacks on military bases.The planned mode of attack was
a number of suicide strikes, possibly using aircraft in a man
ner similar to that of the September 11 hijackers. TTie Saudi
government revealed that some of the suspects had learned
to fly airplanes in a nearby "troubled country," but would
not specify whether this was Somalia. Iraq, Pakistan, or an
other state altogether. Although the government did not
specifically say that the suspects were al-Qaeda operatives,
the Saudis openly compared the planned attacks to those of
September 11. and reported that the subjects of the arrests
were "carrier of al-Qaeda ideology."
In a related story, the Pentagon reported that the U.S.
military had captured Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi. who has been
transferred to the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mil
itary officials say Abd al-Hadi al lraqi is a senior al-Qaeda
operative with close ties to Osama bin Laden. Before his
capture, he was allegedly plotting the assassination of Pak
istan's President Pervez Musharraf in addition to attacks on
coalition forces in Afghanistan.

Arms control rollback Putin's reply to Western criticism

In his annual state of the nation address last Thursday,
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia
should no longer observe a major arms control treaty that
has been in place since before the fall of the Soviet Union.
The Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, signed in
1990 and amended in 1999, is an agreement between Russia
and NATO regulating the number of conventional (non-nu
clear) weapons maintained by its member states. These in

elude military aircraft, tanks and other heavy weapons.
Debate centers around the 1999 amendments, intended
to reflect the new balance of international power in the
wake of the Cold War. Though Russia ratified the changes,
the United States and some NATO states, citing their dis
pleasure at Moscow's continued stationing of Russian
armed forces in the former Soviet satellites of Georgia and
Moldova, have not.
Putin proposed a moratorium — intermediate between
observing the treaty and withdrawing from it — until "all
NATO countries ratify it and begin to strictly abide by it."
Western experts are saying that this would provide the
Kremlin with the authority to build up troop levels on Rus
sia's border areas, although such a move seems unlikely due
to the high cost.
According to most analysts, the real cause of the Krem
lin's call for a moratorium on the CFE is its dissatisfaction
with Western criticism of Putin on democracy and human
rights, and above all its objections to a series of American
antiballistic missiles now being planned for construction in
Central Europe. The United States has finished agreements
with Poland and the Czech Republic to base a number of in
terceptor missiles in their territory to form part of a defense
shield in the event that an ICBM is launched from Iran.
Many in Russia, including Mr. Putin, have declared their
mistrust of U.S. intentions, saying that the interceptors are
intended not to counter Iran, but instead are directed at
Russia.
Because the missiles are not to be installed until well
after Mr. Putin's term in office expires, negotiations on this
issue are set to extend well into the luture.
