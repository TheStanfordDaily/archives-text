## Highway ramp to reopen within 10 days 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - A highway
ramp shut down by the collapse of an over
pass near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge won't have to he rebuilt from scratch
and could reopen within 10 days, the gover
nor said Wednesday
The ramp connecting two interstate high
ways was blocked Sunday morning when a
burning tanker truck brought down the over
pass. Crews finished clearing debris from the
collapse Tuesday.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the
ramp connecting westbound Interstate 80 to
southbound Interstate 880 could be fully
open to traffic in as little as seven days and as
many as 10.
"Progress on repairing the collapsed free
way connectors is moving at lightning speed,"
he said in a statement, after appearing at a
news conference in Sacramento with state
transportation officials.
Investigators found that the steel girders
holding up the lower ramp had warped but
remained structurally sound and could be
straightened. California Department of
Transportation spokesman Mob l laus said.
The overpass connecting eastbound Inter
state 80 to eastbound Interstate 580 was de
stroyed by the tanker explosion, however.

and will have to be replaced.
The state Transportation Department
does not know how long it will take to com
plete the larger reconstruction of Interstate
580, which connects San Francisco to its east
ern suburbs, said Director Will Kempton.
The Federal Highway Administration has
agreed to pay for much of the repairs to both
sections of freeway, Schwarzenegger said.
The state also will seek federal reimburse
ment for money it spent to make public tran
sit more available and to patrol roadways
during the repairs — already nearly $ l ) mil
lion.
The agency has not decided whether it also
will seek reimbursement from the owner of
the tanker truck, Sabek Transportation, or
driver James Mosqueda, Kempton said. The
agency typically does so when drivers damage
state highways, he said.
Meanwhile, California Highway Patrol
documents released Wednesday showed that
the company was cited at least six times for
safety violations since August 2(X)6. but that
the company had maintained a "satisfactory"
safety rating.
Sabek officials did not return calls seeking
comment tin Wednesday.
Traffic over the bridge into San Francisco

on Wednesday morning was at its worst since
the collapse, but rain and several minor acci
dents appeared largely at fault.
The gridlock feared by authorities has
failed to materialize, but detours along Oak
land streets have raised concern among resi
dents about the increased traffic and pollution.
Meanwhile, the Bay Area Rapid Transit
rail system reported record ridershipTuesday
with more than 375,000 passengers, up from
an average weekday ridership of 340,000.
The Associated Press also obtained a copy
of Mosqueda's 2005 application to the state
motor vehicles department to haul hazardous
materials. It showed he had reported that his
license was previously suspended or revoked,
but state officials had redacted the reason
why.
Mosqueda, 51, has criminal convictions
stretching from l l )Sl to l l )%.
He remained hospitalized in San Francis
co in fair but stable condition, but the hospi
tal would not relay calls from the AP to his
room.
No criminal charges or citations have been
issued as a result of the accident.The Califor
nia Highway Patrol said it is investigating the
driver, the company that owned the truck and
the vehicle's safety record.
