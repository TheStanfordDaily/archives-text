1 KILLER'S PARADISE |
A film screening and panel discussion
presented by
Chicana/o Studies. Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
Since 1999 more than two thousand women have been murdered in Guatemala,
with the numbers escalating every year. Yet, lawmakers and government officials
continue to turn a blind eye. Powerful and uncompromising, Killer's Paratf/se un
covers one of the most emotionally-wrenching hidden human rights abuses taking
place, while exposing the impunity allowed by an inept judicial system. With its
history of almost four decades of civil war, Guatemala is a troubled society but it
can also be seen as a microcosm of the pervasive violence and injustice against
women that exists in the world today.
