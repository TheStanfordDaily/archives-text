Battle of Pac-10's worst in Pullman, Wash
By DENIS GRIFFIN
DESK EDITOR
Sometimes, a long-distance road trip
can he just the kind of jolt a team needs
to snap out of a losing streak. Finding
themselves last in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and with a trip to Pullman, Wash, on
the horizon, Stanford baseball players
certainly hope that's true.
After struggling to notch just five
wins over their last 20 games, one would
expect Stanford (18-24, 3-12 Pac-10)
players and coaches to have reached a
state of desperation heading into this
weekend's series with Washington State
(21-20. 4-11). But as junior right fielder
Michael Taylor explained, the pressure
has been on for some time now.
"To be honest with you, at this point,
the panic button and the urgency is being
pushed as hard as it can be pushed," he
said. "We're trying to win every game —
we're fighting, we're clawing for every
possible game we can."
For the Cardinal, history is on the
line, as well as the three games them
selves. Before losing two of three games
to the Cougars in March of 2006, Stan
ford had not lost a game to Washington
State since 1978. The Cardinal was last
defeated in Pullman in 1970.
Stanford's recent run of futility has
stemmed largely from its statistically
worst pitching staff in the conference.
The staff has run up a 6.42 ERA — last
in the Pac-10 by a 1.23 margin.
At this point, associate head coach
Dean Stotz is at a loss for how to im
prove the Cardinal's pitching.
"You know, 1 think we've tried dang
near everything at this point," he said.
"There's a certain level of personal ac
countability towards it. It's so conta

Nevertheless, he was unwilling to lay all

Battle of Pac-10's worst in Pullman, Wash
By DENIS GRIFFIN
DESK EDITOR
Sometimes, a long-distance road trip
can he just the kind of jolt a team needs
to snap out of a losing streak. Finding
themselves last in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and with a trip to Pullman, Wash, on
the horizon, Stanford baseball players
certainly hope that's true.
After struggling to notch just five
wins over their last 20 games, one would
expect Stanford (18-24, 3-12 Pac-10)
players and coaches to have reached a
state of desperation heading into this
weekend's series with Washington State
(21-20. 4-11). But as junior right fielder
Michael Taylor explained, the pressure
has been on for some time now.
"To be honest with you, at this point,
the panic button and the urgency is being
pushed as hard as it can be pushed," he
said. "We're trying to win every game —
we're fighting, we're clawing for every
possible game we can."
For the Cardinal, history is on the
line, as well as the three games them
selves. Before losing two of three games
to the Cougars in March of 2006, Stan
ford had not lost a game to Washington
State since 1978. The Cardinal was last
defeated in Pullman in 1970.
Stanford's recent run of futility has
stemmed largely from its statistically
worst pitching staff in the conference.
The staff has run up a 6.42 ERA — last
in the Pac-10 by a 1.23 margin.
At this point, associate head coach
Dean Stotz is at a loss for how to im
prove the Cardinal's pitching.
"You know, 1 think we've tried dang
near everything at this point," he said.
"There's a certain level of personal ac
countability towards it. It's so conta
