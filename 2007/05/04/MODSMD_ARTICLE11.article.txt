## Factions split in committee battle Appropriations chair selection deadlocked by ASSU controversy 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU's Appropriations
Committee is the new battleground
for a division between senators en
dorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) and those sup
ported by The Stanford Review, ac
cording to senators who spoke with
The Daily last night. Hie eight
member committee — widely con
sidered the Senate's most important
— faces a split decision over its new
chair.
According to Senator Tomas
Vacek '10. when Vice President
Mondaire Jones *09 gave his recom
mendations to the Senate at Tues
day night's meeting, he included five
SOCC-endorsed senators on the
committee — a move that would

have given SOCC a majority on the
important sub-body.
After some discussion. Senate
Chair Priyanka Sharma "09 said she
would assign the committee mem
bers herself. She said last night that
she has not yet assigned senators to
anything hut Appropriations.
"1 just got the email with three
choices [from senators]," she said.
"Mostly everybody will get their
first choice."
SOCC-endorsed Senator
Corinne Prudhomme "09 said that
Sharma's new assignments put four
SOCC-endorsed senators and four
Review-supported senators on the
committee. The Appropriations
Committee now faces a 4-4 divide in
its vote for chair, a position that will
be held by either Vacek or Prud
homme.
"1 would say that in my opinion
that could be a possibility why the
vote was split but I don't know what
is going on inside the mind of each
person." Sharma said.
"The vote for chair of appropria
tions was split, but we did a secret

ballot so we don't know who decid
ed for who," Prudhomme added.
According to Vacek. the battle
for chair illuminates the deeper divi
sion between SOCC and The Re
view.
"Corinne Prudhomme was run
ning ansi she is a SOCC senator," he
said. "She received the full support
of all the SOCC senators on the Ap
propriations Committee. It was a 4-
4 decision between me and
Corinne."
Prudhomme criticized Review
supported senators for forming a
coalition, despite their claims that
they are independent-minded indi
viduals.
"[ln banding together] they go
back on what they said originally."
she said, "which is that The Review
is not a group, it's just people who
are replying back on a survey."
Both Review- and SOCC-en
dorsed candidates also earned en
dorsements from groups like the
Stanford Democrats and the Oueer-
Straight Alliance.
Senators have thus far been un

willing to budge on several compro
mises proposed by Sharma.
"There was a long debate about
whether any of the two [Vacek and
Prudhomme] wanted to step down."
Sharma said. "1 suggested the idea
of co-chairs, but some particular
people were against it."
Though Sharma suggested
Prudhomme could take a deputy
chair position, she said the divided
committee could not reach a con
sensus.
"As it worked out, as of now, the
situation has not been resolved," she
said."Having thought it all over.nei
ther of the two have decided to step
down. It's not decided whether
Corinne would be deputy chair or
someone else. There is no decision
about the chair right now."
T*he final decision about the new
chair will be made this afternoon.
"If [the committee] keeps a 4-4
vote," Vacek said, "it will be up to
Priyanka to break the tie."
