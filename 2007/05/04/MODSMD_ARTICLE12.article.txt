## Housing changes in store As Draw nears, students face a closed Roth, new deadlines 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Calling all students: if you are planning to
enter this year's Housing Draw, the deadline is
fast approaching. By Sunday, all Draw groups will
he finalized and individual entries must submit an
application by May 13. But as students cross their
fingers for the coveted top spot, which would give
them the right to first selection, they will likely
notice a few changes in this year's application
process.
Roth, the all-female Row house, will undergo
renovations this summer and as a result will not
open until winter quarter of 2008. Roble will offer
two more single rooms and Potter will no longer
be an academic theme house.
For the first time this year, students will re
ceive guaranteed housing if they apply by each
quarter's waiting list deadline.They are, however,
encouraged to apply by the May 13 deadline in
order to receive a better Draw number and be
given preference over other applicants.
"Previously, students had to apply by the

Draw deadline in order to be guaranteed in the
waiting list rounds," said Director of Housing As
signments Sue Nunan in an email to The Daily.
This year, students can also make changes to
their housing applications online rather than hav
ing to contact Housing to do so. Furthermore, res
idence charts that indicate exactly how many
spaces are available to upperclassmen for au
tumn quarter have been added to the Housing
Web site.
Student Housing has done its part to raise
awareness about the Draw process. Earlier this
month. Housing held two "Draw Forums" and it
has hosted information tables in different dining
halls. The office will also open for extra hours on
May 6 and May 13.
While many students express confusion and
frustration with the Draw, Executive Director of
Student Housing and Chief Housing Officer
Roger Whitney said the process has worked ef
fectively at the University for more than 30 years.
"[The Draw] has been an equitable means of
allocating the limited number of spaces available
within individual houses," he said. "[lt has been
good for] implementing the many assignment
policies established by University committees
over the years. No system that allocates a scarce
resource is perfect and universally liked."
Administrators did acknowledge, however.

that improvements could be made, and indicated
that they would utilize student input in the
process.
"We will be seeking ways to simplify the Draw
and to reduce perceptions that the system can be
'gamed,'" Whitney said.
Kelsey Holshouser 10 said she thinks the
Draw's relative fairness outweighs the annual
stress it causes.
"1 feel that the draw gives each person an
equal opportunity to get into the house they
want." she said. "So. it's not that a senior will nec
essarily have a better chance at living in a Row
house."
