## Energy building project warms up Eco-friendly plans shape new architecture 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
The Jerry Yang and Akiko Ya
mazaki Environment and Energy
Building — the 112 irst of four new Sci
ence & Engineering Quad buildings
and a frontrunner for eco-friendly
architecture — has finally broken
ground.
The new building is named after
Yahoo! Co-founder Jerry Yang "90
and his wife Akiko Yamazaki "90,
who recently donated $50 million
for its construction. It is scheduled
to open in November.
Located on the corner of Via Or
tega and Panama Street, the build
ing will use 50 percent less energy
and 90 percent less water than a tra
ditional building of comparable size.
It will also use natural ventilation
and lighting.
The building will be a hub for en
vironmental work on campus, hous
ing interdisciplinary programs like
the Woods Institute for the Environ
ment; the Civil and Environmental
Engineering Department; the Inter
disciplinary Graduate Program in
the Environment and Resources;
and the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West.
Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Richard Luthy. who is
also a senior fellow at the Woods In
stitute.said the new building will not
be quite as green as some of the Uni
versity's other eco-friendly struc
tures. such as the Leslie Shao-ming
Sun Field Station at Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, but will be effi
cient for a standard academic build
ing.
"It is pushing the envelope in
terms of a standard academic build
ing but it isn't quite the same as the

green building at Jasper Ridge,"
I .uthy said. "It has some of the same
features, though. We tried to maxi
mize natural daylight and natural
ventilation, which really lowers the
energy use. ITiere are photovoltaics
on the roof which will provide a
small amount of energy for the
building but they are there in part
for demonstration, evaluation and
testing."
Luthy said he hopes the occu

pants of the building will minimize
energy and water usage.
Occupants of the new Environ
ment and Energy Building will be
taught how the building works and
will be monitored to ensure they do
not undermine the building's eco
friendly ambitions.
The building will have floor fea
tures that will regulate internal tem
perature, for example. When left un
carpeted, the varnished concrete

floors will cool down at night and
help cool the building during the
day, especially in the summer.
"We will be monitoring energy
consumption, so people will be able
to see how much energy is used and
saved," Luthy said. "We will be able
to track consumption changes from
year to year."

The Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy building comes together at the corner of Via Ortega
and Panama Street. The structure, which will open in November, is built to conserve water and energy.
