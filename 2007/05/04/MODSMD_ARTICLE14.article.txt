## Editorial Board Publicize in-house draw process 
### 
This week, undergraduates will rank
their preferences for residences next
year. The housing discussions taking
place among Draw groups will inevitably go
beyond simply the merits of living on the
Row versus Governor's Corner. Most stu
dents weigh the pros and cons of a one-room
triple in a desirable residence with that of a
two-room double somewhere remote.
Because many houses provide a mix of de
sirable rooms, like singles, with less exciting
one-room doubles, the process by which
rooms are allotted is an important one. As of
now, some houses determine which students
will choose rooms first based on seniority.
Others depend solely upon one's regular
Draw number, with lowest (best) numbers
going first. Further, more will combine the
two. Finally, some houses operate randomly
and pick out of the metaphorical hat. How this
in-house draw is conducted is a major element
in room-conscious students' housing choices.
Or at least, it would be if that information
was publicly available. As it is. houses are not
obligated to publish in-house draw proce
dures in advance or inform interested stu
dents as to what this procedure will look like.

Imagine a rising sophomore, drawing
preferred, who must gauge his chances of
living in a desirable room within a residence
which may favor seniors entering the house
over him. He will probably choose towards
the bottom of the order. Or consider a stu
dent who thinks she can eke into a certain
residence which determines in-house draw
based upon regular Draw number.That stu
dent will end up getting last pick in the
house.The worst part is. these students often
have no idea how the in-house draw will
proceed until the day it happens.
This opaqueness is unacceptable, but for
tunately it is easily remedied. ITie simplest
option is for Residential & Dining Enter
prises to mandate that houses post their in
house draw procedures on the Residential
Education Web site before students have to
rank their housing preferences. That would
allow all students a fair chance to consider
what housing they want to pursue in light of
their room allocation procedures.
Hopefully this year will be the last in
which students have to blindly rank their
housing choices without knowing how
rooms are assigned.
