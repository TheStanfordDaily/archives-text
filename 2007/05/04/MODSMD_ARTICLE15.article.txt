# Date-A-Palooza
## 
### 
It's May! Flower petals clog the gutters of
Mayfield. freshmen have stopped caring
about IHUM, and The Claw has once
again become the bathtub of campus. In the
spirit of the moment. I think it's time to drop
my dire predictions of gloom and doom, and
introduce a clearly wonderful and well
timed concept: Date-A-Palooza.
The concept behind Date-A-Palooza is
fairly straightforward. Developed by my
friend, who we will call Matt for privacy's
sake, the goal of Date-A-Palooza is simply
to rack up as many dates as possible by the
end of the school year. Matt's justification
for such a bold campaign? "Reducing awk
wardness, both in the present and future."
Matt believes that "getting a job and try
ing to date — it's going to be awkward. You
might as well get used to the awkwardness in
a non-threatening environment. I figure
that after, say, ten dates, you should be a pro
at handling awkward dating situations. It's
about coping mechanisms — I am trying to
establish coping mechanisms for future, pos
sibly awkward scenarios."
Undeniably, there is a deep and mean
ingful campus-wide relationship with the
awkward. There are both pro- and anti-awk
ward Facebook groups. There is the awk
ward turtle hand gesture, along with the
awkward penguin dance of awkwardness.
I"he use of the word and the actual state of
being permeate our campus in an anxious
mist.
Most people seem somewhat content to
bathe in awkwardness without searching for
a cure. We take awkwardness, especially in
the avenue of wooing, as an insurmountable
roadblock.
But Date-A-Palooza offers hope. Matt's
faith in the amelioration of awkwardness
through repeated exposure is inspiring. Stu
dents of Stanford, here is my weekly call to
action: Embrace possible failure and short
comings, grow a metaphorical sack, and ask
someone out.

Now. I know that my calls to action often
go unheeded. When I begged that the Row
boycott Admit Weekend's dry policy by
being social during admit weekend, the only
event that I could find on campus involved
playing spin-the-bottle in Rains. When 1 im
plored you to reconsider the assumed role
of women in the bedroom, only my staunch
following of radical feminist readers who
live in the East Bay responded to my plea.
When I asked for the option to submit soft
copies instead of hard copies, I received six
angry letters from various TA's, but no
change. But this week's plea is different. It's
altruistic. It has the capacity for fun. It might
end with you getting laid.
I want you to overcome your fear of pos
sible rejection before you're shoved out into
the Real World. I lell./want to overcome my
fear of possible rejection. What are we so
afraid of, anyway?
I think a lot of our fear of dating stems
from the fact that most of us just haven't
done a lot of it. Co-ed dorms, bless their
hearts, make it very easy to by-pass the for
mal getting-to-know you phase. Instead,
most of us skip dinner and a movie and go
straight to the would-you-like-to-watch-a
movie-on-my-futon phase. Don't get me
wrong — this arrangement has its merits.
But I get the feeling that this tactic just won't
fly at work: Hey, Joe...why don't you stay
after hours and we can watch Apple trailers
on my laptop in the conference room? Now
