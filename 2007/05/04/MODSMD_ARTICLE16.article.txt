# School's out!
## 
### 
Oli wait. Not for undergrads. 0r...
graduate students in other depart
ments. Basically not for the rest of
the University, because you're on quarters.
Sorry.
Go Law School! Another year on the
hooks, and what a year it's been. Remember
that case we read about those two parties
that just couldn't resolve their conflict with
out resorting to the legal system? What a
tragedy And the HPA regulating CO2 emis
sions? Pffff. preposterous. And don't forget
that OJ book confession;good thing he's in
vested all his assets in his primary residence.
Am I right?
Sigh. Good times. In half seriousness
though, as the year winds down, I feel com
pelled to offer some reflections on time
spent and hopes for times to come. Rarely
am I sanguine, saccharine or seraphim, and
I don't plan to start now.
In the past year. I have made more mis
takes than in any other in my recollection.
(My record from fall 1998 â€” spring 1999
has been expunged.) I've seriously blun
dered in my academic.extra-curricular, per
sonal, professional, social, romantic, geo
political. zoological and sartorial endeav
ors. Not just little mistakes, either. I mean,
only a real buffoon could derail the Doha
round of trade talks in the afternoon and
still have the energy come 1 a.m. to fail to

make a move on a woman who invited him
to her place to watch "Love Actually."To be
fair, the Doha negotiations were complicat
ed. but the movie is called "Love Actually."
Maybe that's a sign, genius!
Hut a genius I surely am not. Far from it.
On the plus side. I will say that, as a man of
multiple monumental mistakes, I've be
come quick to forgive and a stranger to
grudges. If I keep my mind focused on the
best in people, I figure they're all the more
likely to do me the same favor, right?
As to the future,friends, what can we ex
pect? On a very sad note, we'll be deprived
of all the love,comfort and joy that the Law
School Class of'o7 gave us. Class 0f'07,1 felt
like I got to know almost 2 percent of you
on an incredibly personal level, and I'm not
sure how I'll get by without the daily expe
rience of not seeing you at the Law School
