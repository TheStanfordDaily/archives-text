## Reflecting on tragedy 
### JOHN HENNESSY 
On April 16,2007.0ur country suffered
a terrible tragedy when a troubled
student killed 32 members of the Vir
ginia Tech community.
Such tragedies are unfathomable.
Words, as eloquent and sincere as they may
be, fail to convey the shock and sadness we
all felt upon hearing that news.
At Stanford, 1 was struck by the deep
and sincere evidence of sympathy and con
cern throughout campus, from the moments
of silence at many meetings to the cards
signed in dining halls to the moving cere
mony at Memorial Church. Today, Stan
ford's condolences stand among those of
more than 300 other colleges and universi
ties on the Virginia Tech website. Ours is a
caring community, and that fact was never
so clear as it was on April 16 and the days
immediately thereafter.
Not surprisingly, 1 have been asked
about emergency protocols here at Stan
ford. I want you to know that in the wake of
the Virginia Tech tragedy, a group has been
convened by Vice President Randy Liv
ingston to review all of our emergency pro
tocols, as well as our methods of communi
cation. Stanford has had an emergency
management program in place for many
years. Hie emergency plan has evolved
from one primarily focused on earthquake
preparation and response and now includes
an "all hazards" approach. We practice an
nually for all types of emergencies, includ
ing intentional acts. In addition, we have
various methods available through which to
communicate with the entire campus, but
we are seeking to improve the speed and ef
ficiency with which we can do so. Our emer
gency protocols are good, but the realities
of today's society demand that they be even
better.

As important as they are, emergency
protocols are unfortunately after-event
procedures, and therefore only part of a
necessary dialogue. As has been made very
clear in the days following the tragedy at
Virgina Tech, the challenge of how society
addresses mental health issues is serious
and complicated. We pray that what hap
pened at Virginia Tech was a horrible aber
ration that will not be repeated anywhere.
We know in retrospect that more must be
done to recognize the warning signs of men
tal distress, including its potential for vio
lence. We know we must learn more about
how and when to intervene appropriately.
The deaths at Virginia Tech are a tragedy
of national proportions, but college cam
puses are experiencing smaller, quieter, yet
profoundly distressing tragedies every day
— young people who have chosen to take
their own lives. The Stanford community
has been no exception in this regard. Since
the beginning of the academic year, we
have lost several Stanford students. As we
think through the maze of mental health
challenges, we must also confront the prob
lem of suicide — openly, constructively and
with determination.
For many, the imponderability of suicide
may make us feel powerless to know where
to begin in addressing such a painfully per
sonal issue. So perhaps the place to start is
in the recognition that we all do indeed
have a role to play. A university is a deeply
intimate community — what touches one,
truly touches all. That means that as a com
munity we have a set of responsibilities to
each other. We have the responsibility to
understand, to comfort, to reach out and, in
some cases, to act.
Mental and emotional distress know no
bounds of gender, background or color. 1
am hopeful for a day when the stigma asso
ciated with depression and other mental

health problems — whether imposed br
others or one's self — dissipates and goes
the way of other misplaced fears and biases.
I lelping each other overcome that stigma is
an important first step.
This stigma, which often results in a re
luctance to seek help, implies an additional
responsibility: We must share a commit
ment to be compassionate, to not turn away
from seeing and acknowledging a difficult
circumstance, and then take the opportuni
ty to reach out to help — or even seek help
ourselves.
There are many resources available at
Stanford, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) at Vaden
Health Center, the Bridge Peer Counseling
Center, the Office for Religious Life, the
community centers and residence staff,
among others. But these resources can only
be brought to bear if they are engaged.
Last fall. Provost John Etchemendy ap
pointed a group to examine issues around
the psychological well being of our students
and assess the services we offer in this area.
Other colleges and universities are taking
similar measures in the face of an increas
ing demand for mental health and well
being services. Some of you will be asked to
participate in focus groups this spring or to
take an online survey, and 1 hope you will
choose to participate.
It goes without saying that one suicide is
too many, and we must look within our
selves to be certain that we are doing every
thing we can to prevent such tragedies. 1
have been gratified by the strength and
compassion of students, faculty and staff in
the last few weeks. I hope and believe we
can build on that to create an even healthi
er, safer and more caring community.
