There do you live?" and "what's
%/%/ your major?" may well be the
▼ T two most common questions
you'll ask and he asked during your four
years at Stanford, but as soon as you gradu
ate. the inquisition shifts into a very different
gear.
As anyone who's ever watched the au
thentic workplace depictions of "Grey's
Anatomy" or " Hie Office" should know, res
idence and area of study mean next to noth
ing in the real world. Rather, after two years
(Aug. 20()4-June 2006) and four weeks (Mar.
30-present) as a high school English teacher,
I've gotten used to constant questions about
my love life. No. I'm not married. No. I don't
have a boyfriend. No. the date 1 brought to
Winter Formal was only a friend (OK. he was
an ex-hook-up. but fourteen year-olds defi
nitely don't need that kind of an education).
Last Friday, however, on our school's
Community Service Day at a local farm, the
personal questions were taken to a whole
new level.
As we walked towards the malodorous
sheep barn we were about to muck out. the
parent chaperone gently pulled me apart
from the kids. "So, did 1 hear that you're ex
pecting?" she asked conspiratorially.
1 almost fell into the pile of manure in
front of us.
I am rWENTY-FOUR, for God's sake.
My biological clock has barely gotten used to
the notion of circulation, let alone started
ticking. Last I checked, it had just completed
lap # 1 around the dial, warming to the idea of
entering an honest-to-goodness relationship
with another human being. And by "another
human being," 1 mean a fully-grown male
adult (with emphasis on the "fully-grown"
piece of the description. Any possible leads
on such a rare find should contact me at the
email address below).
In some ways, the woman's question was
not entirely illogical. I am. after all. a mater
nity leave replacement, so it's reasonable to
assume that the words "pregnancy" and
"Lisa Mendelman" have been linked in con
versation. Moreover, just about every female
teacher at school seems to be carrying a fu
ture bundle of joy. Hell, one of the other ma

ternity leave subs is on the verge of taking a
maternity leave of her own. Lunchtime con
versation generally revolves around morning
sickness, random cravings, weight gain, and
water retention (particularly in the hands
and feet). Indeed, if the school is looking for
another way to promote safe sex, they should
just sit the students at the faculty table.
Blame it on the impending holiday (note
toself:sende-cardtoMomon May 13). Def
initely fair recompense for twenty-four-plus
years of love and nurturance), but materni
ty seems to be uppermost in everyone's
minds these days. First, there's been a
plethora of high-profile reviews and articles
about Linda Bennetts's controversial new
book.The Feminine Mistake, in which Ben
netts argues that women who forgo work for
children are making a huge (economic) mis
take.
Then this Tuesday's Daily featured a tan
dem of articles on the rise in the number of
female professorial hires and the new child
care funding program for junior faculty.
The latter report and new initiative are
good news for a woman who's about to apply
to Ph.D. programs, I suppose. Although my
wildest dreams feature a return to the Farm
as a professor, I know that will probably only
happen twice: once for my twenty-five year
reunion and once with my own future Stan
ford applicant (let's hope the numbers are
slightly more in his/her favor by then; I'm
going to have to get my act together soon
enough to beat the baby boom of the current
college population).
For years, I was critical of my mother's de
cision to work full-time (and then some). Our
house was no stranger to babysitters, al
though we definitely had our fair share of
strange ones. There was the one who read a

blank hook — for hours, the one who spilled
yogurt in the silverware drawer — and didn't
clean it up, the one whose child bit me... the
list is endless. But for all of the short-termers
who became family jokes, there were also an
impressive number of absolutely amazing
mainstays, many of whom I'm still in touch
with. Only when I started working myself did
I realize that, for all of my years of commen
tary about lost after-school time and home
cooked meals, I will make a version of the
same choice.
I don't feel as strongly as Bennetts — I
don't think women who choose children
over work are setting back feminism or in
herently at risk of becoming husband-para
sites — but 1 also don't want to choose. Per
haps my plan (teach and write until 1 have
children, give up teaching but keep writing
while they're young, return to teaching when
they're slightly older) is no less naive than
that of my male friend who wants to have
five (yes, HVE) children, a successful law
practice, and time to work out five days a
week. His envisioned daily schedule features
roughly six and a half hours of sleep and, so
tar as I can tell, no private time with his wife.
And then there's the question of who will be
getting the kids ready for him to take to
school every morning (he'll be working out
during this time) and who will prepare the
dinner the family will eat together every
night.
I have no answer to any of those ques
tions. But, at the moment, I don't have to. Al
though the tirst of my friends is due in August
(the first of my friends to marry, she is. for the
record. Mormon, and hence an outlier on the
bell curve of mating rituals), 1 am nowhere
near ready to hop on the baby-stroller
wagon. I want both kids and a career eventu
ally, but at least for now, the only things I'll be
giving birth to are a statement of purpose and
grades and comments for my 72 eighth
graders. I think that should be more than
enough to keep me busy and awake at all
hours of the night, at least for the foreseeable
future.

There do you live?" and "what's
%/%/ your major?" may well be the
▼ T two most common questions
you'll ask and he asked during your four
years at Stanford, but as soon as you gradu
ate. the inquisition shifts into a very different
gear.
As anyone who's ever watched the au
thentic workplace depictions of "Grey's
Anatomy" or " Hie Office" should know, res
idence and area of study mean next to noth
ing in the real world. Rather, after two years
(Aug. 20()4-June 2006) and four weeks (Mar.
30-present) as a high school English teacher,
I've gotten used to constant questions about
my love life. No. I'm not married. No. I don't
have a boyfriend. No. the date 1 brought to
Winter Formal was only a friend (OK. he was
an ex-hook-up. but fourteen year-olds defi
nitely don't need that kind of an education).
Last Friday, however, on our school's
Community Service Day at a local farm, the
personal questions were taken to a whole
new level.
As we walked towards the malodorous
sheep barn we were about to muck out. the
parent chaperone gently pulled me apart
from the kids. "So, did 1 hear that you're ex
pecting?" she asked conspiratorially.
1 almost fell into the pile of manure in
front of us.
I am rWENTY-FOUR, for God's sake.
My biological clock has barely gotten used to
the notion of circulation, let alone started
ticking. Last I checked, it had just completed
lap # 1 around the dial, warming to the idea of
entering an honest-to-goodness relationship
with another human being. And by "another
human being," 1 mean a fully-grown male
adult (with emphasis on the "fully-grown"
piece of the description. Any possible leads
on such a rare find should contact me at the
email address below).
In some ways, the woman's question was
not entirely illogical. I am. after all. a mater
nity leave replacement, so it's reasonable to
assume that the words "pregnancy" and
"Lisa Mendelman" have been linked in con
versation. Moreover, just about every female
teacher at school seems to be carrying a fu
ture bundle of joy. Hell, one of the other ma

ternity leave subs is on the verge of taking a
maternity leave of her own. Lunchtime con
versation generally revolves around morning
sickness, random cravings, weight gain, and
water retention (particularly in the hands
and feet). Indeed, if the school is looking for
another way to promote safe sex, they should
just sit the students at the faculty table.
Blame it on the impending holiday (note
toself:sende-cardtoMomon May 13). Def
initely fair recompense for twenty-four-plus
years of love and nurturance), but materni
ty seems to be uppermost in everyone's
minds these days. First, there's been a
plethora of high-profile reviews and articles
about Linda Bennetts's controversial new
book.The Feminine Mistake, in which Ben
netts argues that women who forgo work for
children are making a huge (economic) mis
take.
Then this Tuesday's Daily featured a tan
dem of articles on the rise in the number of
female professorial hires and the new child
care funding program for junior faculty.
The latter report and new initiative are
good news for a woman who's about to apply
to Ph.D. programs, I suppose. Although my
wildest dreams feature a return to the Farm
as a professor, I know that will probably only
happen twice: once for my twenty-five year
reunion and once with my own future Stan
ford applicant (let's hope the numbers are
slightly more in his/her favor by then; I'm
going to have to get my act together soon
enough to beat the baby boom of the current
college population).
For years, I was critical of my mother's de
cision to work full-time (and then some). Our
house was no stranger to babysitters, al
though we definitely had our fair share of
strange ones. There was the one who read a

blank hook — for hours, the one who spilled
yogurt in the silverware drawer — and didn't
clean it up, the one whose child bit me... the
list is endless. But for all of the short-termers
who became family jokes, there were also an
impressive number of absolutely amazing
mainstays, many of whom I'm still in touch
with. Only when I started working myself did
I realize that, for all of my years of commen
tary about lost after-school time and home
cooked meals, I will make a version of the
same choice.
I don't feel as strongly as Bennetts — I
don't think women who choose children
over work are setting back feminism or in
herently at risk of becoming husband-para
sites — but 1 also don't want to choose. Per
haps my plan (teach and write until 1 have
children, give up teaching but keep writing
while they're young, return to teaching when
they're slightly older) is no less naive than
that of my male friend who wants to have
five (yes, HVE) children, a successful law
practice, and time to work out five days a
week. His envisioned daily schedule features
roughly six and a half hours of sleep and, so
tar as I can tell, no private time with his wife.
And then there's the question of who will be
getting the kids ready for him to take to
school every morning (he'll be working out
during this time) and who will prepare the
dinner the family will eat together every
night.
I have no answer to any of those ques
tions. But, at the moment, I don't have to. Al
though the tirst of my friends is due in August
(the first of my friends to marry, she is. for the
record. Mormon, and hence an outlier on the
bell curve of mating rituals), 1 am nowhere
near ready to hop on the baby-stroller
wagon. I want both kids and a career eventu
ally, but at least for now, the only things I'll be
giving birth to are a statement of purpose and
grades and comments for my 72 eighth
graders. I think that should be more than
enough to keep me busy and awake at all
hours of the night, at least for the foreseeable
future.
