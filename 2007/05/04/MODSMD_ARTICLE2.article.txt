# Warriors fans, enjoy the ride

'm a Warriors fan.
Unlike most of you, I endured the
13-year drought of zero playoff ap
pearances, the empty stands and the
incident where Latrell Sprewell tried
to strangle P.J. Carlesimo during
practice. It's been a tough 13 years,
but we finally made it. We've shocked
the world. Dallas is dead.
Fine.
I'm not really the hardcore War
riors fan I wish I was. I'm only a lousy
handwagoner.
If you asked me who Mickael
Pietrus was two weeks ago. 1 proba
bly would have told you that he was
the scientist guy who had a dish
named after him. If you told me that
Baron Davis was clean-shaven, I
probably would have believed you.
But that stiil doesn't prevent me
from riding the Warrior bandwagon
all the way to NBA glory
In light of the Warriors 16-5 late
season run to earn a playoff spot and
their six game series victory over the
Mavs, front-runners like me are
everywhere. You can't escape War
rior mania. While writing this column
1 took a break to browse Facebook
and was bombarded by a plethora of
Warrior logos where faces should
have been.
Anywhere you go, you're bound
to hear talk about the Warriors.

you see that alley-oop from half
court? SICK."
"Could someone introduce Dirk
to Robert Horry?"
"1 can't believe it, man. After 13
years, we've finally won a series in
the playoffs!"
In a matter of a few weeks, the
franchise known for its futility has
become the Bay Area's hottest enti

Don't get me wrong. I don't have
any contempt for these newly

You see, there's nothing wrong
with being a bandwagoner. It's in
herently American. Nobody likes a
perennial loser. You think there's a
reason why the Royals' and the D-
Rays' attendance figures are lower
than, say, the Yankees?
Bandwagoning is a uniquely
American pastime; freedom fries
and Cadillacs have nothing on the
wagon.
You don't have to look any fur
ther than last year's World Cup to
see the disparity between us and the
rest of the world. When most coun
tries lose, fans are crushed. Suicide
rates skyrocket and national days of
mourning are held. When the US.
loses, we don't hesitate in finding our
next rooting interest. Just think of all
the France, Italy and Brazil soccer
jerseys you see.
It might not have the strongest
grounding in principle,but it's OK to
be a bandwagoner. It's only natural
for us.
And after all, without bandwag
oners, the sports merchandising in
dustry would be a mess. Before the
last few weeks of basketball, 1 had
probably seen a grand total of five
items of Warriors apparel, worn by
brave, brave souls. Now? If you don't
have your Warriors gear on, you're
stuck in last week.
Bandwagoning is a part of our
culture that isn't going anywhere. 1
recognize and proudly acknowledge
my status; there's no reason for us to
be ashamed.
And I understand that it's easy
for true fans to have contempt for
the American way of instant gratifi
cation. If you're one of the five die
hard Warriors fans on campus who
have followed the team closely for
years, you're enjoying the amazing
run. But at the same time, you're
thinking in the back of your head.
"Where were the rest of these fans
when Latrell was choking P.J.? I was
there."
And it's a completely legitimate
qualm. But give the rest of us a break
â€” we can't help the way we are.
So, to all the true fans: I commend
you for your persistence, dedication
and spirit. You deserve to enjoy the
success of your team.
As for the rest for us. the group of
bandwagoners that I willingly sub
scribe to: Enjoy the ride.
