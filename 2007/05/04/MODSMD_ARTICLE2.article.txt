# Warriors fans, enjoy the ride

'm a Warriors fan.
Unlike most of you, I endured the
13-year drought of zero playoff ap
pearances, the empty stands and the
incident where Latrell Sprewell tried
to strangle P.J. Carlesimo during
practice. It's been a tough 13 years,
but we finally made it. We've shocked
the world. Dallas is dead.
Fine.
I'm not really the hardcore War
riors fan I wish I was. I'm only a lousy
handwagoner.
If you asked me who Mickael
Pietrus was two weeks ago. 1 proba
bly would have told you that he was
the scientist guy who had a dish
named after him. If you told me that
Baron Davis was clean-shaven, I
probably would have believed you.
But that stiil doesn't prevent me
from riding the Warrior bandwagon
all the way to NBA glory
In light of the Warriors 16-5 late
season run to earn a playoff spot and
their six game series victory over the
Mavs, front-runners like me are
everywhere. You can't escape War
rior mania. While writing this column
1 took a break to browse Facebook
and was bombarded by a plethora of
Warrior logos where faces should
have been.
Anywhere you go, you're bound
to hear talk about the Warriors.
