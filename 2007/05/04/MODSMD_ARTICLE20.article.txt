### SARA LANNIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Women's lacrosse is off to the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation championship tourna
ment at UC-Davis today, with the Cardinal
gunning for its third consecutive conference
title. Stanford has only competed in the tourna
ment since 20()4, and now looks to defend its
title from five other opponents, most notably
Denver and Oregon.
Last year, the Cardinal (6-8, 3-2 MPSF)
faced Denver (15-2,5-0) in the championship
game. The Pioneers have been enjoying con
siderable success this season and are entering
the tournament with the coveted No. 1 seed.
Hie third-seeded Cardinal will face sixth-seed
ed St. Mary's (3-12,0-5) in Friday night's first
round.
Overall, Stanford holds a 13-0 record
against St. Mary's, having beaten the Gaels
with ease on several occasions. Their last
match-up cam on Feb. 16 and ended in a 22-6
blowout victory for the Cardinal.
That contest started strong for Stanford,
with freshman Lauren Schmidt scoring the
tirst goal only a minute and a half after the
whistle blew. The rest of the half saw the Car
dinal women go on an astonishing 13-1 scor
ing run, thanks in part to three goals by senior
Liz Piselli.The second half flowed as easily as
the first, with the Cardinal women scoring
eight more goals before the final whistle
sounded.
In total,six players scored multiple goals in
the last game against the Gaels, including three
from freshman Amanda Schwab and two each
from freshmen Dana Lindsey and Sarah Blah
nik, as well as junior Daphne Patterson.
Schmidt emerged as the game's leading scorer
with five goals. All have been key contributors
over the course of the regular season, adding a
combined total of 63 goals over 13 games.
The Gaels' leading scorers — Abbie Cole
man, Jen Utley and Amber Lister — have
combined for 12 goals and eight assists. Stan
ford's three leading scorers—Patterson,
Schmidt and junior Megan McClain — have

amassed 67 goals and 22 assists, while the entire
Cardinal team has earned 150 goals and 62 as
sists. The winner of Friday's game will play No.
2-seeded Oregon at 5 p.m. on Saturday, while
the loser will play either UC-Davis or Califor
nia at 1 p.m. on Saturday.
If the Cardinal wins its first match on Fridav,

it will face a tough adversary.The Ducks (11-6.
4-1 MPSF) defeated Stanford, 10-6. in their
first game of the season — the first time in
seven years that Stanford has lost its opening
game. Oregon pulled ahead on a b-0 scoring
run during the wet and nuiddy game against
the Cardinal, leaving Stanford too far behind

(MPSF CHAMPIONSHIP FIRST
ROUND)
(15-2, 5-0 MPSF)
Davis, Calif. 5 RM.
GAME NOTES; A win tonight would send Stanford to Satur
day's MPSF semifinal against No. 2-seed Oregon at 5
p.m. The third-seeded Cardinal has won the past two
years' of titles, but faces stiffer competition this season
from the Ducks and top-seeded Denver. The champi
onship match will be Sunday at 1 p.m.

to catch up.
In the Feb. 10 loss to Oregon, senior
Michelle DeChant and Schmidt were both
able to find the back of the net twice, while Pat
terson and Piselli contributed one goal apiece.
All four women are among the team's top six
scorers, and will be critical players if the Cardi
nal gets the chance to exact revenge on the
Ducks. Oregon's leading scorers over the
course of the season are Brooke Dieringer,
Kate Fleming and llsa Van den Berg. The trio
has combined for 88 goals and 33 assists. Over
all, the Ducks have garnered 197 goals and 110
assists.
The Cardinal has not faced the Ducks since
the first game of the season — in bad weather
conditions — and the team hopes to capitalize
on its second opportunity, if Stanford can bet
ter its record to 14-0 against the Gaels first.The
most intimidating team in the tournament is
clearly No. 17 Denver, which is eager to strip
Stanford of its title.The 2007 champions will be
crowned after Sunday's 1 p.m. game.
