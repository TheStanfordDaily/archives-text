## Town and Country gets new facelift 
### JENNY BAER SI AFF WRITER 
Extreme Makeover: Town and
Country edition. No. it's not the title
of a new reality television show, but it
is reality, as the nearby center has un
dergone a facelift since October.
The $25 million project is nearing
completion, however, and the new
center is expected to be completed
before the end of May. according to a
memo given to business owners ear
lier this week.
A prominent feature of the con
struction are the newly planted palm
trees that will decorate much of the
new center. Although much of the
rest of the facility will remain the
same, new features include more
seating areas, new store signs and a
reconfigured parking lot.

Business owners are eagerly
awaiting the project's conclusion, as
many shop owners have complained
of lost business and declining rev

enues. Rob Diaz, manager of Hobee's
Restaurant, said potential customers
think the restaurant is closed.
"More people will start coming
back in once it's all done," he said.
"I'm sure after it's over it's going to
be all right and everything will look
much better."
Others saw a silver lining in the
extended construction project.
Josh Kinder, who works at the
Orvis clothing store, said the con

struction was the best thing to hap
pen to his fishing skills. The large
spaces created by the project, he said,
have allowed him and Milo Lewis,
who is the materials coordinator at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, to practice casting outside.
Town and Country houses family
owned Palo Alto institutions such as
The Cheese House as well as fran
chises such as Hobee's and Peet's
Coffee & Tea, which are popular with
students.
"I've gotten some coffee at Peet's
a couple times and I've gone to
Hobee's after a long Friday night,"
said Vaughan Tuohy '08. "I like the
"60s decor."
