## CELLAR DWELLERS Battle of Pac-10's worst in Pullman, Wash 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Sometimes, a long-distance road trip
can he just the kind of jolt a team needs
to snap out of a losing streak. Finding
themselves last in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and with a trip to Pullman, Wash, on
the horizon, Stanford baseball players
certainly hope that's true.
After struggling to notch just five
wins over their last 20 games, one would
expect Stanford (18-24, 3-12 Pac-10)
players and coaches to have reached a
state of desperation heading into this
weekend's series with Washington State
(21-20. 4-11). But as junior right fielder
Michael Taylor explained, the pressure
has been on for some time now.
"To be honest with you, at this point,
the panic button and the urgency is being
pushed as hard as it can be pushed," he
said. "We're trying to win every game —
we're fighting, we're clawing for every
possible game we can."
For the Cardinal, history is on the
line, as well as the three games them
selves. Before losing two of three games
to the Cougars in March of 2006, Stan
ford had not lost a game to Washington
State since 1978. The Cardinal was last
defeated in Pullman in 1970.
Stanford's recent run of futility has
stemmed largely from its statistically
worst pitching staff in the conference.
The staff has run up a 6.42 ERA — last
in the Pac-10 by a 1.23 margin.
At this point, associate head coach
Dean Stotz is at a loss for how to im
prove the Cardinal's pitching.
"You know, 1 think we've tried dang
near everything at this point," he said.
"There's a certain level of personal ac
countability towards it. It's so conta

GAME NOTES: Stanford has lost six consecutive se
ries and currently stands at the bottom of the Pac
-10 rankings. This weekend's three-game set
against the Cougars, ranked second to last in the
conference, represents a chance for the Cardinal
to climb out of the cellar. Stanford has not lost to
Washington State in Pullman since 1970.

ting hit just kind of gets you a little gun
shy."
Nevertheless, he was unwilling to lay all
the blame for Stanford's struggles this
season on the squad's pitching staff.
"We haven't played great defense,
and we don't run great," Stotz said. "So,
it's not as dominant on one side of this as
it appears on the scoreboard some
times."
One recent bright spot for Stanford
has been the play of second baseman
Adam Sorgi, who was named the Pac-10
Player of the Week on May 1. Over the
span of five games from Apr. 24-30, Sorgi
batted .550 with .625 on-base and .700
