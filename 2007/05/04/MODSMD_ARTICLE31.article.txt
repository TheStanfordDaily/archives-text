## I had a grudge against Feist... 
### BRENDAN SELBY INTERMISSION GRUDGE HOLDER 
I first heard "Mushaboom," the break
out song from her first album "Let It Die"
(2004), during my brief stint as summer
sales assistant at Restoration Hardware. I
may have been organizing mocha-scented
candles; 1 may have been tri-folding 200

plush towels made from
vegetablc-dyed Turkish
cotton: Frankly, I try not
to remember.
But I do remember that
"Mushaboom," a lilting
ditty about a woman look
ing forward to buying her
first home, seemed to fit
right in to the genteel, de
cidedly un-Feisty atmos
phere of the store. And I
have unfairly held it
against her ever since.
That is, until 1 heard
"The Reminder," Feist's
splendid second album,
which came out this week.
Let's begin with her
voice. Even if you're are
one of the 12 people who
hasn't heard "Musha
boom" at a store or cof
fee shop, you'll also rec
ognize it if you're a fan
of Broken Social Scene,
the Canadian super
group to which Feist.

a.'k.a. Leslie Feist of Toronto, is a fre
quent contributor.
It's a very distinctive voice. Most of the
time, it has the beautifully muffled quality
of a French horn or a muted trumpet.
Smooth as silk. Every once and a while,
however, she pops the cork on that sucker
to release a burst of effervescent sound
that sparkles like good champagne. It's
quite a contrast, and it seems to be her
trademark.

Listen, for example, to the elimax of the
"12 3 4," the first single off "The Re
minder." For the first half of the song, she
sings in a honeyed, slightly mocking voice
about someone who seems to have sold
out: "1,2,3,4. 5,6,9 or 10 / Money can't
buy you back the love that you had then."
Then, at the end of the second chorus, she

belts out to an explosion of horns, "You
know who you are!" I don't know whether
it's an accusation or a satire of self-help ad
vice, but the line never fails to give me a
chill.
Indeed. Feist's tiny frame seems to con
tain many instruments. On "My Moon,
My Man." a standout track with a killer
piano baseline, she electronically blends a
sample of her voice in a way that sounds
like the piping of clarinets.

One of the most remarkable things
about "The Reminder" is its range.
There's something for everyone here,
folks. On "The Park." a wistful melody
about lost love is overlaid with sounds of
chirping birds. "Brandy Alexander" is a
traditional but well-executed pop ballad,
while "Honey, Honey" is clearly influ
enced by the sultriness of

1970s soul. Last but not
least, "Sea Lion Woman" is
a truly Feist-y rendition of a
Nina Simone classic about a
sexy, back-stabbing adul
tress.
The only tracks I didn't
like as much were the ones
that reminded me of Norah
Jones or some similar vari
ety of''adult contemporary"
lounge music. (Come to
think of it, that's the kind of
music they play in Restora
tion Hardware...) The first
track, "So Sorry," features
an unfortunate salt-shaker
beat and singers in the hack
ground crooning, "Oooh,
ooooh!"
It's a great album, how
ever. up there with the best
of the year. The songs are
subtle but unpretentious
fun. Even if you don't rush
out and buy it toda\. at least
go to YouTubc and check
out the video for "1 2 3 4,"

which features awesome spiral camera
work and what can only he described as
silly, multi-colored dancing in a ware
house. And Ms. Feist ain't so bad to look
at. cither.
All in all. it's enough to make you agree
with the anonymous poster on You Tube
who wrote: "may the reviewer of [Rolling
Stone magazine] get hit by a truck deliver
ing her cds to a local sam goody for only
giving her 3 stars."
