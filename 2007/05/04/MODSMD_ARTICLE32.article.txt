## Can't afford a movie ticket? Intermission takes you to the trailer park 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION TRAILER PARKER 
In my oh-so-humble-opinion, the best tool
for procrastination (well, the second-best, if you
count the ever-present Facebook) is
www.apple.com/trailers, which has dozens and
dozens of movie trailers available 24/7. The vast
majority of the movies you will never see, but
you can at least watch a two-minute snippet of its
best parts. For many of them, you won't be miss
ing much in the remaining hour-and-28 minutes
of filler. The only funny jokes will be the three
featured in the trailer.
One can spend hours watching two-minute
synopses of such priceless and eternal cinematic
masterpieces such as "Kickin' It Old School,"
which features Jamie Kennedy as a 1986 break
dancing champion who wakes up from 20-year
coma to find that everything has changed.
Cliches ensue — he needs to win a dance com
petition to win the heart of his lifetime love who
is engaged to his worst enemy. Seriously. They
would not make it unless you were going to
watch it, folks.
However, gems do occasionally appear: both
summer-blockbuster atrocities and truly com
pelling films. At least, atrocious and/or com
pelling trailers for these films.
After procrastinating much on a paper last
week, I ran through many trailers. A sampling of
the movie fare on offer in the next few months.
"Private Fears in Public Places." Alain Resnais, Dir.

This movie is very, very French. Paris is
snowing, the color palette is muted and the dia
logue hangs in the air. A piano slowly plays in
the background through the rapid scene
changes. Statements that sound banal — "The
problem with women — they don't understand
men's need for solitude" and "Life is strewn
with ordeals like this that paralyze us. Surely you
don't get over them either. That makes me very
happy" seem profound when set against this
background. There's no real sense of a plot in

this trailer, but the cine-

matography, at least, is v
superb. Evocative,
heavy, dim, this will '
eventually make it into
my computer's DVD
player.
"28 Weeks Later." Juan
Carlos Fresnadillo, Dir.

"28 Days Later" was a
surprise-hit zombie movie
from a few years ago. De
scribed as a "zombie movie
with a heart," it sacrificed

suspense and horror for

emotion and lamily. even more
: • 1-. la. 1 j nru* *

surprisingly, it worked. I his movie is set, I guess,
four months after the outbreak of zombie-ism,
when London has been cleaned up and the pop
ulation moves back. A broken family, the moth
er having been turned into a zombie and killed,
is reunited. But there is another outbreak, there
arc shots of crowds of people running across
fields and the military blows up London. There's
a quick shot of the father, pained, as he is run
ning, and one is immediately greeting with the
strong sense that the father is doomed. "Weeks"
seems to lack the originality of "Days."
"Ocean's 13." Steven Soderbergh, Dir.
Another iteration of the casino-heist-ensem
ble-cast franchise. "Ocean's 11" worked very

well, and "Ocean's 12" worked adequately, but
this one seems like another move downhill. The
plot-rigging A 1 Pacino's (replete with terrible
highlights) new casino in revenge for something
that isn't entirely clear-seems contrived. There's
the usual wit, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the rest
are all there, but it's hard to see the justification
for another "Ocean's" movie, especially with a
plot this bad.
"Sunshine." Danny Boyle, Dir.

Another of those

horribly overdone sci
ence-fiction film aspir
ing for realism. The
"Icarus 2" is a space-

craft heading to the
"dying sun" to
"reignite" it. whatever
that means. Predictable

uses of mythological ref-
I erences ensues. The nar
rator of the trailer and
one of the main stars is
that "Scarecrow" guy
from "Batman Begins."
The trailer is mostly quick-

cut scenes of people run-

ning through hallways and ad-

c? C J
vanced-looking glass-and-steel installments ex
ploding. None of this bodes well for the actual
film. That being said, if there is enough of a
human element, the film could save itself from
the dreaded o-word (overdone), but chances
seem slim.
"No Reservations." Scott Hicks, Dir.
Part of the description of the film on the trail
er page is as follows: "High-spirited and free
wheeling, Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart)
couldn't be more different from Kate [Cather
ine Zeta-Jones], yet the chemistry between
them is undeniable." The set-up is clear in the
first 30 seconds-Eckhart joins a perfectionist
Zeta-Jones in a high-powered kitchen, and Zeta

Jones inherits Olive from "Little Miss Sun
shine," or at least the actress who plays her. As
one might expect, every second of this film is
permeated with feel-good cliches and happy
music. Witness this priceless exchange: "'1 wish
there was a cookbook for life.' 'You know better
than anyone; the recipes you create for yourself
are the best.'" This movie seems to be straight
from a recipe, no substitutions.
"Transformers." Michael Bay, Dir.
1 wonder how much The Strokes paid for
Shia Laßoeuf to wear their t-shirt throughout
what appears to be the entire movie; it was prob
ably a lot. The band needs the publicity, appar
ently. The movie seems to have a "War of the
Worlds" feel, which makes sense considering
that Steven Spielberg is an executive producer.
It's unclear from the trailer what is happening in
the movie, but it opens on July 4. and the budget
is clearly impressive. It will either be a classic
summer blockbuster and pull in $300 million, or
it will Hop miserably; I'm leaning toward the for
mer, for the moment.
Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic about the
state of movies, especially when one is watching
overdone trailers that attempt to summarize a
two-hour film and reveal the ending (why, we
will never know) in all of two minutes. But at
least it's easier to avoid the bad ones.

summer blockbuster and pull in $300 million, or
it will Hop miserably; I'm leaning toward the for
mer, for the moment.
Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic about the
state of movies, especially when one is watching
overdone trailers that attempt to summarize a
two-hour film and reveal the ending (why, we
will never know) in all of two minutes. But at
least it's easier to avoid the bad ones.



In my oh-so-humble-opinion, the best tool
for procrastination (well, the second-best, if you
count the ever-present Facebook) is
www.apple.com/trailers, which has dozens and
dozens of movie trailers available 24/7. The vast
majority of the movies you will never see, but
you can at least watch a two-minute snippet of its
best parts. For many of them, you won't be miss
ing much in the remaining hour-and-28 minutes
of filler. The only funny jokes will be the three
featured in the trailer.
One can spend hours watching two-minute
synopses of such priceless and eternal cinematic
masterpieces such as "Kickin' It Old School,"
which features Jamie Kennedy as a 1986 break
dancing champion who wakes up from 20-year
coma to find that everything has changed.
Cliches ensue — he needs to win a dance com
petition to win the heart of his lifetime love who
is engaged to his worst enemy. Seriously. They
would not make it unless you were going to
watch it, folks.
However, gems do occasionally appear: both
summer-blockbuster atrocities and truly com
pelling films. At least, atrocious and/or com
pelling trailers for these films.
After procrastinating much on a paper last
week, I ran through many trailers. A sampling of
the movie fare on offer in the next few months.
"Private Fears in Public Places." Alain Resnais, Dir.

This movie is very, very French. Paris is
snowing, the color palette is muted and the dia
logue hangs in the air. A piano slowly plays in
the background through the rapid scene
changes. Statements that sound banal — "The
problem with women — they don't understand
men's need for solitude" and "Life is strewn
with ordeals like this that paralyze us. Surely you
don't get over them either. That makes me very
happy" seem profound when set against this
background. There's no real sense of a plot in

this trailer, but the cine-

matography, at least, is v
superb. Evocative,
heavy, dim, this will '
eventually make it into
my computer's DVD
player.
"28 Weeks Later." Juan
Carlos Fresnadillo, Dir.

"28 Days Later" was a
surprise-hit zombie movie
from a few years ago. De
scribed as a "zombie movie
with a heart," it sacrificed

suspense and horror for

emotion and lamily. even more
: • 1-. la. 1 j nru* *

surprisingly, it worked. I his movie is set, I guess,
four months after the outbreak of zombie-ism,
when London has been cleaned up and the pop
ulation moves back. A broken family, the moth
er having been turned into a zombie and killed,
is reunited. But there is another outbreak, there
arc shots of crowds of people running across
fields and the military blows up London. There's
a quick shot of the father, pained, as he is run
ning, and one is immediately greeting with the
strong sense that the father is doomed. "Weeks"
seems to lack the originality of "Days."
"Ocean's 13." Steven Soderbergh, Dir.
Another iteration of the casino-heist-ensem
ble-cast franchise. "Ocean's 11" worked very

well, and "Ocean's 12" worked adequately, but
this one seems like another move downhill. The
plot-rigging A 1 Pacino's (replete with terrible
highlights) new casino in revenge for something
that isn't entirely clear-seems contrived. There's
the usual wit, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the rest
are all there, but it's hard to see the justification
for another "Ocean's" movie, especially with a
plot this bad.
"Sunshine." Danny Boyle, Dir.

Another of those

horribly overdone sci
ence-fiction film aspir
ing for realism. The
"Icarus 2" is a space-

craft heading to the
"dying sun" to
"reignite" it. whatever
that means. Predictable

uses of mythological ref-
I erences ensues. The nar
rator of the trailer and
one of the main stars is
that "Scarecrow" guy
from "Batman Begins."
The trailer is mostly quick-

cut scenes of people run-

ning through hallways and ad-

c? C J
vanced-looking glass-and-steel installments ex
ploding. None of this bodes well for the actual
film. That being said, if there is enough of a
human element, the film could save itself from
the dreaded o-word (overdone), but chances
seem slim.
"No Reservations." Scott Hicks, Dir.
Part of the description of the film on the trail
er page is as follows: "High-spirited and free
wheeling, Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart)
couldn't be more different from Kate [Cather
ine Zeta-Jones], yet the chemistry between
them is undeniable." The set-up is clear in the
first 30 seconds-Eckhart joins a perfectionist
Zeta-Jones in a high-powered kitchen, and Zeta

Jones inherits Olive from "Little Miss Sun
shine," or at least the actress who plays her. As
one might expect, every second of this film is
permeated with feel-good cliches and happy
music. Witness this priceless exchange: "'1 wish
there was a cookbook for life.' 'You know better
than anyone; the recipes you create for yourself
are the best.'" This movie seems to be straight
from a recipe, no substitutions.
"Transformers." Michael Bay, Dir.
1 wonder how much The Strokes paid for
Shia Laßoeuf to wear their t-shirt throughout
what appears to be the entire movie; it was prob
ably a lot. The band needs the publicity, appar
ently. The movie seems to have a "War of the
Worlds" feel, which makes sense considering
that Steven Spielberg is an executive producer.
It's unclear from the trailer what is happening in
the movie, but it opens on July 4. and the budget
is clearly impressive. It will either be a classic
summer blockbuster and pull in $300 million, or
it will Hop miserably; I'm leaning toward the for
mer, for the moment.
Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic about the
state of movies, especially when one is watching
overdone trailers that attempt to summarize a

will never know) in all of two minutes. But at
least it's easier to avoid the bad ones.
