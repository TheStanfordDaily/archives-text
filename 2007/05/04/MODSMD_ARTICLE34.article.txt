## Kaiser Chief: Reinforcements for the British invasion 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION KAISER 
If you were lucky enough to have gone to
Coachella, the three-day music festival-meets-
Mecca in Indio, Calif., hopefully you were also
lucky enough to have caught the Kasier Chiefs,
one of the latest bands to cross the pond in the
so-called Third British Invasion, a recent im
port-o-mania including fellow Brits KT Tun
stall, Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse, Snow Pa
trol, James Morrison, Mika, Lily Allen, James
Blunt, Natasha Bedingfield and the Fratellis,
to name a few.
The Kaiser Chiefs, named after a South
African football team to which a former band
member belonged, are new-wave indie
punk/art rock band out of Leeds, England.
The Chiefs' rare ascent to stardom, breaking
into the UK's top 100 as a completely unsigned
band, is the reason why teenage boys play in
garages. Instead of just forcing girlfriends and
neighbors to listen to their jams, however, this
group of school friends has all of the UK and
the rest of the world taking note.
"Yours Truly, Angry Mob," Kaiser Chefs
second album after their debut record, "Em
ployment" in 2005, has already reached #1 on
the UK charts. Recently released in the U.S.,
their lead single off the album, " Ruby,"
peaked at #15 on the U.S. Modern Rock
charts. The group continues the upbeat Brit
pop/punk sound of their first record;
"Peanut," Kaiser Chiefs keyboardist Nick

Baines, noted, "We didn't go for a totally dif
ferent approach. We didn't make the same
record again. But. the band that made the
record was the band that toured with 'Em
ployment' for two years...We knew the direc
tion we were going in. This is just the next
chapter in our progression." Rather then
Madonna-style reinvention, Baines stated
their new album instead contains "more confi
dent concepts."

"Yours Truly" has been highly
anticipated, especially after the
band won Best Group, Best
British Rock Act and Best Live
Act (great live performances per
haps standing as the litmus test for
distinction merit) at the 2006 Brit
equivalent of the Grammys. So far
the first two singles off of "Yours
Truly," "Ruby" and "Everything
is Average Nowadays," currently
stand at #1 and #15, respectively,
on the UK charts, allaying fears of
the sophomore slump into which many new
bands fall. The bassist, Simon Rix stated that
his goal for the band was to not only have a hit
single, but to have that song linger at the top of
the charts for months, a challenge for the
music-ADD public. In a suitingly British way,
Rix cited The Beatles as a paradigm of single
longevity and its reflection on the durability of
the band, as well.
"Yours Truly" undeniably contains some
great songs. The mod-pop "Ruby" almost in

stantly compels a sing-along and its memo
rable riffs give the single the pop-iest feel on
the album. Their second single, "Everything"
is a higher speed, more punk-influenced song,
where the electric guitar echoes lead singer
Ricky Wilson as if it were back-up vocals. Un
like a lot of punk albums, however "Yours
Truly" isn't solely and blandly high energy.
The album's over-all up-beat sound is pep
pered with slower ballads and even a lamenta
tion of lost love. In "1
Can Do It Without
You," Wilson defiantly
states, "I can do it, I can
do it, I can do it, I can do
it without you," eventu
ally and woefully
adding, "But it wouldn't
be very good." Similarly
different, "Boxing
Champ" is a soulful,
Elton John-style, piano
heavy style ballad about

learning from the hard knocks.
Among the triumphs of the band's pop
sound and its intriguing slower variations,
though, exist some blah songs with blah lyrics.
I am not quite sure what "Learnt My Lesson
Well" is about as it marches along at a bit of a
Kaiser-Chief-cookie-cutter pace. In "Thank
You Very Much," Wilson sings the rather im
penetrable, "I just imagine that of you,/ And
there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do"
eight times over. Granted, every CD has its

non-single songs that don't go down in music
history, but perhaps with great songs like
'â€¢Ruby" and "Everything" I expect the filler
songs from this grass-roots success story band
to be more than filler.
If a few songs lack luster, you can't
help but be beguiled by the band's
charm. The Kaiser Chief's official Web
site (www.kasierchiefs.co.uk.) features
a quirky blog, where different band
members post random and witty goings
on, such as a hummingbird sighting and
toothbrush purchases, as well as non
musical video clips, including one of the
band jumping up and down in front of
their own billboard off the side of the
freeway.
With quaintly strong and at times almost in
comprehensible British accents to go along
with three of the five members' Beatle-style
mops, the Chiefs are a lovable five-some. As
this dynamic quintuplet produces more music,
however, I think they will be forced to rein
vent. Madonna took on the dance floor, the
Beatles embraced the sitar, and John Mayer
went blues. What will the Chiefs try? I'm not
sure, but I am enjoying their punk-pop main
stream sound for now and will be looking for
ward to whatever else is in store.
