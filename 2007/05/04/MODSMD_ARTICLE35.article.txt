# Forget the studio album, go see the Kaiser Chiefs at a Venue near you!

### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION HIPSTER 
Local hipsters and middle-aged
music fans eye each other suspicious
ly like two rival beasts forced to share
the same watering hole. Of Montreal

T-shirts and nose
rings on one

side, Bon Jovi

shirts
and

ding rings on the other. What would
draw such a dichotomous audience?
Simple: The Kaiser Chiefs were play
ing a show at the Warfield.
Described by many as "post
punk" and "new wave," the Kaiser
Chiefs draw young and old; parents
stood in the balcony while their kids
were on the floor; or, as witnessed
with one mother, vice-versa. Their di
verse audience can be traced to then
sound. The Kaiser Chiefs serve up
... L -x J1

poppy, somewhat dis-

guslingly

catchy
tunes
that

vary from the ready-made-chart-top
per "Ruby" to the somewhat mirthful
punk anthem "1 Predict A Riot."
They come by their connection to
the history of rock and roll naturally.
Without the Rolling Stones, the
Kaiser Chiefs would never exist. Or
rather, without Ricky Wilson's talents
being discovered while playing with a
Rolling Stone tribute band, the
Kaiser Chiefs would lack their em
blematic frontman.
I have a lot of respect for people
who start out in tribute bands and
then go on to actual rock 'n' rolf ac
claim, save perhaps Mark Wahlberg.
In general, these fans-turned-stars
have a deeper appreciation for their
fan base, because they were (and still
are) fans. So it's not really surprising
that Wilson jumps into the crowd with
a mic and introduces the band while in
the midst of a sea of fans. Nor is it pure
showmanship to dedicate an entire
mic to the audience during the sing
along of "Oh My God."
Wilson reminds people not of the
eccentric indie rock scene, but a

throwback to the spectacle of classic
rock bands. Wilson dances around the
stage, throwing the mic-stand like a
baton and even more incredibly —
without the hint of irony that perme
ates his music.
Between songs, he docs recognize
and acknowledge the staggering suc
cess his band has so recently achieved.
I lis Leeds accent is charmingly part of
the Chiefs up-tempo pop, belying the
lyrics' humorous or dark content.
When addressing the audience, his ac
cent is so muddled at points that 1
have no idea what he is saying, but a
lot of it is just blatantly and ironically
self-promotional. "We're the world
famous Kaiser Chiefs!" he declares.
Well, he's right, but it sounds more
like "kisserchits" when he says it like
that.
Early breaking out such hits as "I
Predict A Riot" and "Ruby" starts the
show off with energy. Nick Hodgson
on drums leads the backup vocals
with Simon Rix and Andrew White
coming in to create a glee club of
falsettos during such numbers as "Na

Na Na Na Naa" and "Everyday 1
Love You Less and Less." The audi
ence joins in as well, filling the concert
hall with a deafening "na na na.' If
you overlook how corny it is, it's in
fectious. And remember: It's easier to
remember the words when they are
gibberish.
Part of why the Kaiser Chiefs have
such rapport with their audience is the
amount of involvement they seek
from the fans. Wilson will climb into
the audience, give them a mic, and get
people to sing along with the ridicu
lously simple lyrics at times. One of
the highlights of the show was when
Nick Baines, the keyboardist, is intro
duced as the band's "clapping expert"
to help lead the audience in "Modern
Way." An over-the-top audience par
ticipation number ensues, only out
done by the second encore's chanting
chorus during "Oh My God."
While I'm a fan of their studio al
bums, I was skeptical of seeing them
live. But the Kaiser Chiefs are one of
the bands that is actually better
much better — live.
