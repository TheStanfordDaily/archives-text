# So cool they're frozen: The Arctic Monkeys in concert
## 
### DEAN SCHAFFER INTERMISSION ARCTIC DWELLER 
When I volunteered to cover
the Arctic Monkeys concert
on Tuesday at the Warfield, the

Intermission editors told me to write
500 to 700 words. Although this re

quirement seemed reasonable at the time, 1 can
now confidently say that 1 really only need two:
Boner Time.
Let me just start by saying this: I'm not a per
vert; I didn't make this phrase up. The Arctic
Monkeys' opening act. Be Your Own Pet, im
planted it in my mind when they announced the
title of their next song. You can guess the title,
I'm sure.
At first, I dismissed the term as irreverent
and decided that writing a song called "Boner
Time" irreversibly qualified Be Your Own Pet
(BYOP) as sophomoric and juvenile. But it's a
bit more complex than that.
Let me explain. BYOP is a pretty standard
Riot Grrrl punk band; they play hard, and they
play fast. The guitarist sticks to power chords
and occasionally rolls around on the floor, the
bassist doesn't play anything complicated, the
drummer plays fast but simple beats and the fe
male lead singer is ambiguously attractive (but
unambiguously angry). And they don't look old
enough to buy cigarettes. (I actually looked this
up — their average age is just over 18.) But. like
many other hardcore punks, they all have more
energy than five year-olds on speed. A lot of
speed.

Between singer Jemina Pearl's screams, con
vulsions and hardcore head-banging, 1 could
scarcely make out her lyrics, much less appreci
ate the music. In retrospect, though, I realized
something: The phrase "Boner Time" isn't just
potty humor — it's a juvenile joke about grown
ups which reflects mockery but also insecurity
and, at some subconscious level, admiration for
and envy of the proverbial Big Kids who do The
Dirty. BYOP reeked of a profound amateurism
that was callow but pregnant with a yearning for
coolness and credibility.
So why am I spending so much time on an ar
guably lackluster opening act? 1 know you prob
ably just want to read about the Arctic Monkeys.
Again, let me explain.
1 initially dismissed BYOP as a poor
choice to complement the headliner; now,
however, 1 realize that they were really the
perfect choice because they're simply an in
verted version of the Monkeys. BYOP want
to be the Big Kids; the Arctic Monkeys are
the Big Kids. BYOP frantically want sex and
violence and alcohol and drugs. The Arctic
Monkeys have reached the true pinnacle of
coolness — they've got all those things, but
they don't even want them.
Their lyrics tell of drunken scuffles and crazy
times, but also of boredom. They sing of being
interrogated by police for underage drinking
and not caring, of running away from the cops
"just for the laugh." Now with a second album
under their belt ("Favourite Worst Night
mare"), the Arctic Monkeys have grown up (in
other words, thev can finally buy their own alco

hoi in the States), but they still have the com
posed. nonchalant and disinterested attitude
that has been their hallmark since the beginning.
From their rumbling opener and new single,
"Brianstorm," to their traditional closer, "A
Certain Romance," the Monkeys put on a show
of old-style hipness: We're going to play, you're
going to like it and we're not going to care; hell,
our accents will prevent you from even under
standing what we're saying between songs, and
you'll still love us.
A steady stream of the group's trademark
fist-pumping, catchy-as-hell tunes kept the show
lively and energetic. Highlights included "D Is
for Dangerous," "This House Is a Circus" and
"Old Yellow Bricks" from their new album and

"View from the Afternoon." "I Bet You Look
Good on the Dancefloor," "Dancing Shoes"
and "When the Sun Goes Down" (complete
with a crowd sing-a-long at the beginning) from
their debut, "Whatever People Say 1 Am, That's
What I'm Not." Although the crowd lost some
of its fervent enthusiasm during the middle-set
doldrums, the group performed a solid set list
and wisely chose to avoid their slower tracks in
favor of tunes with memorable hooks and fast
tempos. Many of their songs sound somewhat
similar to one another, but the band pulled it all
off nicely.
The show didn't end with an encore, but 1
wasn't very surprised. Real Boner Time doesn't
either.
