# The
						Arctic Monkeys: 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' a passable sophomore effort
## 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION MONKEE 
The "Nightmare" the Arctic Mon
keys are suffering from is the curse of

their own success. "Whatever People
Say I Am. That's What I'm Not"
shook everyone awake to a new wave
of British music. The band made itself
a name for its punk-infused rock with

clever one-liners about prostitutes
and what it's like to be disillusioned
and young. You can also blame them
for the wave of imitator bands and
music moguls trying to find the next
Arctic Monkeys. So between their ini
tial release and their follow-up, there
have been two years and an entire
world of music that is trying to be like
them. So when "Favourite Worst
Nightmare" first hits you. you think
you've heard this before.
As a sophomore album, it's not a
terrible letdown. The band doesn't re
ally progress much here; the songs
aren't as fresh and they aren't as sur
prising this time around. "Bri
anstorm" gets things started right with
a toe-tapping portrait of another
weird character the band has encoun
tered. Like anything the Monkeys
write, you're not sure if you want to
meet the "scummy man" or the "in
novator" or any of the other strange
persons they encounter in the back al
leys and under piss-colored street

lamps. They're great ambassadors
to this world, providing a mirthful
and poignant analysis of their sur
roundings.
Taking on a broader scope in
their subject matter, this album is
noticeably darker, with "Fluores
cent Adolescent" providing the first
bouncy and seemingly light song of
the gritty list. They didn't exactly
sing about lollipops before, but ex
pect more in the vein of hookers and
the like with "D is for Dangerous,"
"Balaclava" and "If You Were
There. Beware." That said, there's
nothing that will be seemingly get
stuck in your head for days the way
"When the Sun Goes Down" can.
And aside for some rare moments,
there is nothing as poppy as "1 Bet
You Look Good On The Dance
Floor."
Sadly, this album actually expos
es the band's inexperience and their
greatest failing thus far: their song
composition. On their faster songs.

the guitar work and melodies be
come formulaic —as a punk fan
that's a critique that's hard for me to
even type. There are softer moments
here as well, hut their forte has al
ways been for quick lyrical sleight of
hand that makes them both trick
sters and poets. A solid release, but
they're tepid in their explorations
and something — perhaps originali
ty — is lacking.
