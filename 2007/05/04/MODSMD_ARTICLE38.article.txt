## Desert Storm 
### Joseph Bergen INTERMISSION DESERT WANDERER 
Normally my drives through the
Mojave Desert are fairly uneventful 1 roll
up m>' windows against the super-heated
air, crank up the A C and step on the gas.
Perpetually speeding toward a wavy water
mirage on the road's surface always just
out of reach, I know that if my car breaks
down—even if it's on a well-traveled
highway—that I'll probably end up a
bleached and desiccated skeleton on the
side of the road before the same time the
following day But this past Thursday, as 1
did last year, 1 set my course for the heart
of the desert and the ( oachella Music and
Arts Festival in Indio, California.
This year the festival was
expanded from two days to three in order to
accommodate 50% more rockin' out (and
probably 50$ more sweet, sweet profit).
In keeping with the Coachclia mantra
"to explore the unknown, challenge your
tastes, and whet your senses," there were
a plethora of musical acts performing
throughout the day and night continuously
across five stages Some acts you have

probably heard of, some your parents have
probably heard of and some that pretty
much no one has heard of.
This year was different than last
year, though, and it took me a while to
figure out what exactly it was. The water
was still a hefty $2, the sun still poured
down boiling heat, and the lines to get out
of the parking lots were still probably the
longest lines anyone had to wait through.
It came to me some time the second day
as I was throwing down a bottle of water
after a broiling Hot Chip show: Where
were all the hipsters? The sccnesters?
The tragically hip that had Hocked in
droves to the show last year? With their
"suffer for fashion" and "never wear
shorts" attitudes missing, I wasn't sure
where I'd look to for my next jagged
undercut 'do or western style llanncl
shirt.
To be fair, there were a
decent number of these kids crouched
around in little knots, more often i
than not sporting a Tiger Cub Scout
neckerchief. Hut their presence was
overwhelmingly overwhelmed (yes 1
did) by Norms. People just like you

and I. And if anything, just a bit on the
fratty side of things with red rolled up
bandanas around the head (a la Willie
Nelson) being the unspoken order of
the day. How boring. If 1 wanted to
be like myself, I would have stayed
in my two-room double in Potter and
watched Star Trek while eating Kicker
food. Believe me, it's not as awesome
as it sounds.
After having to make the
gut-wrenching decision to pass up
MSTRKRFT I weaseled my way into
the growing crowd for Kings of Leon
As the set started and I continued to
navigate my way through sticky, sweats
bodies for better position 1 looked up
to one of the giant jumbotron screens
Hanking the main stage and saw a rock
star. There he was, the lead singer and
guitarist, with long black hair, black jeans,
and heeled snakeskin boots. A sort of
updated Lynyrd Skynyrd, Kings of I .eon
played primarily from their latest album
to a receptive crowd. They were cooler
than me. They were cooler than you The\
were even cooler than your older brother
(and he's pretty cool). Who needs hipsters

when you have J
rock stars?
Then I
thought back to
the day before when
I saw the Arctic
Monkeys. They were c 001... I mean
as cool as someone still going through
puberty can be. These guys arc seriously
young. But aside from the fact that all
their songs started to blend together and
we couldn't understand a word through
their thick English accents, they managed
to conjure up quite the mosh pit. (Mosh
pit? I think that was 10 years ago, folks.)
In the end though, the popped collar of the
lead singer's polo just killed it for me. I
can't use that. 1 popped my collar once my
freshman year in 2(X)1 (yes, I'm ancient)
and the night did not end we 11... we'll
leave it at that.
Still thinking back, 1 remembered
Interpol's performance. Now lirstly, I'm
not really a fan of Interpol for some reason,
but endured being crushed and directly
in contact with no less than nine other
people while the roadies set up the gear
and the crowd shuffled impatiently. When

tne group came on, tney were wearing
black suits. While the lead guitarist was
wearing a semi-traditional single-vented
three-buttoned jacket, the bassist came out
wearing a maestro jacket with tails and
a vest. His newly mustachioed face was
somber as he pounded out his bass line
with a cigarette perched between his lips
and the ash managing to somehow stay
on far past what I've since calculated to
be statistically possible. Again, 1 couldn't
use Interpol's fashion. 1 don't wear three
buttoned suits (only two), and 1 certainly
don't wear one with tails.
The Kings of Leon show had
ended, I stopped remembering, and 1 again
vied for better position as The Arcade l ire
began to set up. When Arcade rushed the
stage with 10 members in all, the crowd
went wild. Without going into too much
detail, the show was amazing drawing on as
much old material as new from the opening
"Keep the Car Running," to the closing
"No Cars Go." But I got kind of hung

up 011 the lead
singer. I le looked
like an Amish
dude who forgot
his hat. Hip, but

not the hip I'm going for.
As I ran through thick crowds
towards the Justice set, I thought, "Maybe
rock stars aren't quite as cool as I was
thinking." And then I remembered Hot
Chip, the group I saw just before I noticed
the lacking of hipsters. There were five of
them up on stage, and if you had asked me
who I thought they were, I probably would
have said 1 thought they just shuffled out
of their offices at Google. They were
huge nerds. Despite the heat they were all
wearing jeans, one was wearing a comic
book-styled T-shirt, and another was
wearing an unbuttoned blue Hawaiian
shirt. I looked 011 in disbelief as the lead
singer opened his mouth for the first time

and a voice came out that
totally didn't match him came out. None
of this mattered though. For 50 minutes
they were at the head of a sweaty pulsating
mass of people playing ridiculously good
music. They were cool because they
weren't cool and they didn't care.
1 didn't have much time to dwell
011 this though because as 1 approached
the Sahara tent where Justice was playing
I could feel the chunky beats emanating
from the ground upward. Almost as good
as Daft Punk was last year... almost. But
1 danced more than should have been
physically able and it was probably terribly
embarrassing. Hut I don't care.
Oh, and Rage Against the Machine
was there. Whatever.

were even cooler than your older brother
(and he's pretty cool). Who needs hipsters

when you have J
rock stars?
Then I
thought back to
the day before when
I saw the Arctic
Monkeys. They were c 001... I mean
as cool as someone still going through
puberty can be. These guys arc seriously
young. But aside from the fact that all
their songs started to blend together and
we couldn't understand a word through
their thick English accents, they managed
to conjure up quite the mosh pit. (Mosh
pit? I think that was 10 years ago, folks.)
In the end though, the popped collar of the
lead singer's polo just killed it for me. I
can't use that. 1 popped my collar once my
freshman year in 2(X)1 (yes, I'm ancient)
and the night did not end we 11... we'll
leave it at that.
Still thinking back, 1 remembered
Interpol's performance. Now lirstly, I'm
not really a fan of Interpol for some reason,
but endured being crushed and directly
in contact with no less than nine other
people while the roadies set up the gear
and the crowd shuffled impatiently. When

tne group came on, tney were wearing
black suits. While the lead guitarist was
wearing a semi-traditional single-vented
three-buttoned jacket, the bassist came out
wearing a maestro jacket with tails and
a vest. His newly mustachioed face was
somber as he pounded out his bass line
with a cigarette perched between his lips
and the ash managing to somehow stay
on far past what I've since calculated to
be statistically possible. Again, 1 couldn't
use Interpol's fashion. 1 don't wear three
buttoned suits (only two), and 1 certainly
don't wear one with tails.
The Kings of Leon show had
ended, I stopped remembering, and 1 again
vied for better position as The Arcade l ire
began to set up. When Arcade rushed the
stage with 10 members in all, the crowd
went wild. Without going into too much
detail, the show was amazing drawing on as
much old material as new from the opening
"Keep the Car Running," to the closing
"No Cars Go." But I got kind of hung

up 011 the lead
singer. I le looked
like an Amish
dude who forgot
his hat. Hip, but

not the hip I'm going for.
As I ran through thick crowds
towards the Justice set, I thought, "Maybe
rock stars aren't quite as cool as I was
thinking." And then I remembered Hot
Chip, the group I saw just before I noticed
the lacking of hipsters. There were five of
them up on stage, and if you had asked me
who I thought they were, I probably would
have said 1 thought they just shuffled out
of their offices at Google. They were
huge nerds. Despite the heat they were all
wearing jeans, one was wearing a comic
book-styled T-shirt, and another was
wearing an unbuttoned blue Hawaiian
shirt. I looked 011 in disbelief as the lead
singer opened his mouth for the first time

and a voice came out that
totally didn't match him came out. None
of this mattered though. For 50 minutes
they were at the head of a sweaty pulsating
mass of people playing ridiculously good
music. They were cool because they
weren't cool and they didn't care.
1 didn't have much time to dwell
011 this though because as 1 approached
the Sahara tent where Justice was playing
I could feel the chunky beats emanating
from the ground upward. Almost as good
as Daft Punk was last year... almost. But
1 danced more than should have been
physically able and it was probably terribly
embarrassing. Hut I don't care.
Oh, and Rage Against the Machine
was there. Whatever.





Normally my drives through the
Mojave Desert are fairly uneventful 1 roll
up m>' windows against the super-heated
air, crank up the A C and step on the gas.
Perpetually speeding toward a wavy water
mirage on the road's surface always just
out of reach, I know that if my car breaks
down—even if it's on a well-traveled
highway—that I'll probably end up a
bleached and desiccated skeleton on the
side of the road before the same time the
following day But this past Thursday, as 1
did last year, 1 set my course for the heart
of the desert and the ( oachella Music and
Arts Festival in Indio, California.
This year the festival was
expanded from two days to three in order to
accommodate 50% more rockin' out (and
probably 50$ more sweet, sweet profit).
In keeping with the Coachclia mantra
"to explore the unknown, challenge your
tastes, and whet your senses," there were
a plethora of musical acts performing
throughout the day and night continuously
across five stages Some acts you have

probably heard of, some your parents have
probably heard of and some that pretty
much no one has heard of.
This year was different than last
year, though, and it took me a while to
figure out what exactly it was. The water
was still a hefty $2, the sun still poured
down boiling heat, and the lines to get out
of the parking lots were still probably the
longest lines anyone had to wait through.
It came to me some time the second day
as I was throwing down a bottle of water
after a broiling Hot Chip show: Where
were all the hipsters? The sccnesters?
The tragically hip that had Hocked in
droves to the show last year? With their
"suffer for fashion" and "never wear
shorts" attitudes missing, I wasn't sure
where I'd look to for my next jagged
undercut 'do or western style llanncl
shirt.
To be fair, there were a
decent number of these kids crouched
around in little knots, more often i
than not sporting a Tiger Cub Scout
neckerchief. Hut their presence was
overwhelmingly overwhelmed (yes 1
did) by Norms. People just like you

and I. And if anything, just a bit on the
fratty side of things with red rolled up
bandanas around the head (a la Willie
Nelson) being the unspoken order of
the day. How boring. If 1 wanted to
be like myself, I would have stayed
in my two-room double in Potter and
watched Star Trek while eating Kicker
food. Believe me, it's not as awesome
as it sounds.
After having to make the
gut-wrenching decision to pass up
MSTRKRFT I weaseled my way into
the growing crowd for Kings of Leon
As the set started and I continued to
navigate my way through sticky, sweats
bodies for better position 1 looked up
to one of the giant jumbotron screens
Hanking the main stage and saw a rock
star. There he was, the lead singer and
guitarist, with long black hair, black jeans,
and heeled snakeskin boots. A sort of
updated Lynyrd Skynyrd, Kings of I .eon
played primarily from their latest album
to a receptive crowd. They were cooler
than me. They were cooler than you The\
were even cooler than your older brother
(and he's pretty cool). Who needs hipsters

when you have J
rock stars?
