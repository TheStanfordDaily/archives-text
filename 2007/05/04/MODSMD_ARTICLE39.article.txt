## Zeni: So delicious, just try it 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION HONORARY ETHIOPIAN 
Before I even begin this piece, it's
important to get something out of
the way. This is by no means an im
partial food review. I've been going
to Zcni Ethiopian Restaurant on at
least a weekly basis for several years
now. While that doesn't exactly
make me the most objective of third
party observers, it also means 1 have
a good sense for the pros and cons of
this fine dining establishment.
I'm always impressed by how
many people I meet who've actually
given Ethiopian food a shot. That
said, there are still plenty who've
never even thought about what
Ethiopian food might be like (let
alone actually tried it eating it). Well,
I'm reaching out to those from both
groups here. If you've tried Ethiopi
an and liked it but somehow haven't
yet tasted Zeni, then trust me, you'll
like this place even better than wher
ever you went before. If you had
Ethiopian and didn't like it, eating at
Zeni might change your mind about
the cuisine (there are some particu
larly bad Ethiopian places around
here that, some might argue, are
barely even really Ethiopian to begin
with). And last, if you haven't tried
Ethiopian, well, you're in for a treat.

If you don't believe me, try to ex
plain this. Now, as wonderful as the
food at Zeni might be, the service is
— to put it mildly — less attentive
than what one would desire. (We
didn't even know the place offered
free refills until a year into eating
there, when one of us finally had the
audacity to walk up to the counter
and request more soda.) Your bill
will often not make its way to your
table unless you specifically nag a
waitress for it. And about five or six
times after we had driven all the way
down to San Jose to satisfy our crav
ing (sometimes hours before the
restaurant was scheduled to close),
we were turned away because the
staff said they were "out of injera"
for the night. (Note: Injera is a bread
like substance that you use to wrap
up and eat the various dishes served
— don't bring a knife and fork to an
Ethiopian place... you'll look like an
idiot!)
But despite these drawbacks —
which, quite frankly, would have
turned us away from any ordinary
restaurant long ago — we keep
going back to Zeni, time and time
again. Why? Simple. The food is the
arguably the best Ethiopian in the
country.
I'm not as much of an expert
when it comes to Zeni's vegetarian
dishes since 1 rarely eat anything

from which meat is absent. However,
my girlfriend (originally from
Ethiopia, so I'm pretty sure she's a
credible source) claims the shuro wot
(powdered chick peas in a berbere
sauce) is top-notch. Another quite
tasty dish is the yemisir wot (pureed
split red lentil in berbere sauce).
On the meat side of the spectrum,
Zeni's zilzil tibs (sauteed beef strips)
are fantastic. This is one of the more
user-friendly servings because it's
relatively easy to eat with injera
(compared to the other dishes, which
are mostly sauce-oriented), in the
event that this is your first time eat
ing Ethiopian and you're willing to
go the traditional route and forsake
utensils. It also isn't quite as spicy or
unusual to the American palette as
the other dishes might be at first. An
other delicious option is ktifo
(Ethiopian steak tartar with spices
and a butter sauce), which is much
yummier than the French renditions
of raw meat that I've encountered
(and for those of you who aren't as
inclined to stuff a chunk of raw meat
in your mouth, you can also order the
dish mild or well done, although be
forewarned that it tastes far better
the less it is cooked!).
Other good meat options include
the kei wot (beef in a spicy sauce) and
firfir (cubbed beef and injera mixed
with sauce and various spices). One

solid approach is to order the meat
combination, which is only $12.50
and features a combination of three
meat dishes that you select from a
list. It's practically enough to feed
two (provided both eaters aren't
completely starving) and should give
you a good array of eating options.
The best possible rendition of the
meat combination, in my humble
opinion, is getting kitfo, kci wot and
doro wot (chicken in a spicy sauce).
This combination is technically not
an option given how the menu is
structured, but we were able to pio
neer it a couple years back with a lit
tle initiative and persuasion on our
part. (Maybe this is how the In-N-
Out secret menu got started?) So if
you walk in and ask for a meat
combo "Stanford style," they'll
know that this is what you're asking
for. Pretty cool, eh?
In addition to the dishes I men

tioned above, there are dozens more
I haven't even touched upon, which
arc also scrumptious. And they're all
quite reasonably priced (it's easy to
leave the place only having spent
about $10 a person). So whether
you're a huge Ethiopian fan, only
somewhat acquainted with the cui
sine or completely unfamiliar with it,
this restaurant is a nice place to go. If
you give Zeni a shot, you won't re
gret it.
And, you might ask, what if you
end up not liking it, despite my
strong assertions to the contrary?
Well, I might not be able to guaran
tee your money back, but I'll be
more than happy to take your left
overs!
