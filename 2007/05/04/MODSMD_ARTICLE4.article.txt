# Rosey Neill
## Catching On Quickly 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN 
Softball is predominantly
a mental sport —just ask
freshman catcher Rosey
Neill. As starting hack
stop for the No. 15 Stan
ford Softball team, Neill has both
supported the pitching staff and
anchored the Cardinal defense
and offense in less than a full sea
son with the squad. Her secret?
Mind games.
Coming into Stanford, the La
guna Hills, Calif, native had started
every game of her four-year high
school career. ITtis year, Neill
picked up where she left off. start
ing 45 of Stanford's 46 games be
hind the plate. Early on against
Northwestern, Neill was forced to
break her consecutive game streak
as she battled a nasty case of food
poisoning.
Since then, however, Neill has
yet to disappoint with her near
flawless pitch calling, strong de
fense and uncanny patience at the
plate. On the season. Neill leads
the team with 27 walks and is sec
ond with 31 RBI. Her veteran-like
plate discipline and timely hitting
have certainly stood out. though

Freshman backstop
Neill works hard to stay a
step ahead, and its
paying off

her secret may be simpler than ex
pected.
"I've always been pretty decent
at picking good pitches to hit,"
Neill said. "Walking is just a func
tion of not swinging at balls. When
I was really young, I was told, if it
was a strike, hit it; if it's a ball,
don't,' and I've remembered it
ever since."
Aside from her offensive capa
bilities. Neill's strength lies in di
recting the Cardinal pitching staff
of sophomore Missy Penna and
junior Becky McCullough. At the
beginning of the year, assistant
coach Trisha Ford called the pitch-
es instead of the newcomer Neill.
"Coach Ford called the games until
a few weeks ago because she knows
our pitchers the best," Neill said. "As
the year progressed, she realized that I
knew how to take advantage of the
pitchers' strengths over a batter, so she
decided that it was time for me to start
calling games."
With the guidance of Ford. Neill
has blossomed into a first-class
catcher.
"Every so often. Coach Ford
would let me call games and I found
myself falling in the same mindset

that she uses," Neill said. "Every
coach I've played for has had a differ
ent way of calling pitches, and what 1
do now is a grouping of all of their
philosophies. Because Ford is a suc
cessful college pitching coach, her
mindset has helped me immensely."
Now, Neill calls games with the
confidence of a seasoned veteran.
While Penna and McCullough are
having career years, part of their suc
cess lies on Neill's shoulders — or
more accurately, her mind. As a stu
dent of the game, Neill gives the
squad a mental edge every time she

steps on the field.
"I love calling pitches for Stanford
Softball," she said. 'Every pitch I call
has a different function, it's fun play
ing devil's advocate and playing mind
games with the hitter. 1 try to stay
away from patterns, knowing they re
member what I did to them in their
last at bat."
Perhaps one of Neill's finest mo
ments behind the plate came during
last weekend's 3-2 victory over No. 4
Arizona. Neill and McCullough
teamed together to hold the potent
Wildcat offense to two runs and five
hits for the stunning upset. The victo
ry was less than surprising for Neill.
however.
"Arizona's thinking is very text
book in the way that they approach
an at bat," Neill said. "Playing with
that was really fun because in a situ
ation where a rise ball would be the
textbook pitch, I'd call a drop in and
they would strike out. I felt like we
kept them off balance the entire
game."
Even during the twelve-inning
marathon against Arizona the next
day. Neill hardly felt the pressures of
maintaining the shutout — she al
ready knew Arizona inside out.
"It wasn't nerve-racking calling
pitches for that game." Neill said. "I
did my homework. I watched tape on
Arizona.and I knew what 1 wanted to
throw them. I knew what Missy and
Becky were throwing well, and I felt
that as long as the pitch works, the
batter was not going to get a hit."
"Sunday [against Arizona] was a
moral victory," she added.

Beyond the mental aspects of the
job. the pitcher-catcher relationship is
one built on trust. Fortunately. Neill
has had no problem integrating into
the Stanford bullpen, especially with
the welcoming arms of Penna and Mc-
Cullough.
"It's a blast catching for those
two," Neill said. "They work really
hard, and it's the first time I've been
really good friends with the people
I'm catching. When they pitch, all
they need to think about is their me
chanics because they know that I will
block anything they throw at me.That
trust is really important and it's some
thing you can't manufacture."
Neill has helped the somewhat
shaky Stanford defense this season.
She boasts a .989 fielding percentage
with only four errors on the season.
She has also shown a strong arm and
good instinct in throwing out runners,
an extraordinary feat in college soft
ball. Last weekend. Arizona's Caitlin
Lowe, who is a perfect 44-for-44 on
stolen bases, tried to run on Neill.
Though Lowe escaped with another
bag. Neill barely missed breaking her
streak.
"I got pretty close to throwing
Lowe out, but I was so angry because
she left five seconds early," Neill said.
Indeed. Lxiwe ended up having to
exit the game after umpires called her
again on leaving the base early.
Neill is also leading the Pacific-10
Conference with three runners
picked off on the season, a by-prod
uct of her mental approach to the
game. One of her pick-offs came last
weekend against Arizona's K'Lee

Arredondo, who was Neill's team
mate last fall on the IJSA Junior Na
tional Team.
"Last weekend, Arredondo was
taking a huge lead-off [on| second
base," Neill said."l long-arm faked to
second, she broke for third and I
picked her off. 1 knew she was an ag
gressive runner from playing with
her, and it was fun picking her off."
With last weekend's trip. Neill is
confident in her team's abilities and
the rest of their season.
"1 feel like after this weekend, we
can beat anybody," Neill said. "We've
had a couple rough games, but after
this weekend and beating Arizona,
and almost [beating them again]
through 12 innings, we really came to
gether Team chemistry is really good
right now."
Just a freshman. Neill is primed to
have an amazing career with the
Stanford program. When asked
about her goals and aspirations as a
Cardinal backstop, she had high ex
pectations.
"When I was starting Softball,
they didn't have it on television."
Neill said. "I would watch baseball
catchers, and footwork on their
throws and how they block the plate,
but I never really tried to be like any
one. I tried to do what would make
me successful and carve my own
niche in Softball."
"1 don't want to be the mini ver
sion of anyone else," she added. "1
just want to be myself."

every game of her four-year high
school career. ITtis year, Neill
picked up where she left off. start
ing 45 of Stanford's 46 games be
hind the plate. Early on against
Northwestern, Neill was forced to
break her consecutive game streak
as she battled a nasty case of food
poisoning.
Since then, however, Neill has
yet to disappoint with her near
flawless pitch calling, strong de
fense and uncanny patience at the
plate. On the season. Neill leads
the team with 27 walks and is sec
ond with 31 RBI. Her veteran-like
plate discipline and timely hitting
have certainly stood out. though

Freshman backstop
Neill works hard to stay a
step ahead, and its
paying off

her secret may be simpler than ex
pected.
"I've always been pretty decent
at picking good pitches to hit,"
Neill said. "Walking is just a func
tion of not swinging at balls. When
I was really young, I was told, if it
was a strike, hit it; if it's a ball,
don't,' and I've remembered it
ever since."
Aside from her offensive capa
bilities. Neill's strength lies in di
recting the Cardinal pitching staff
of sophomore Missy Penna and
junior Becky McCullough. At the
beginning of the year, assistant
coach Trisha Ford called the pitch-
es instead of the newcomer Neill.
"Coach Ford called the games until
a few weeks ago because she knows
our pitchers the best," Neill said. "As
the year progressed, she realized that I
knew how to take advantage of the
pitchers' strengths over a batter, so she
decided that it was time for me to start
calling games."
With the guidance of Ford. Neill
has blossomed into a first-class
catcher.
"Every so often. Coach Ford
would let me call games and I found
myself falling in the same mindset

that she uses," Neill said. "Every
coach I've played for has had a differ
ent way of calling pitches, and what 1
do now is a grouping of all of their
philosophies. Because Ford is a suc
cessful college pitching coach, her
mindset has helped me immensely."
Now, Neill calls games with the
confidence of a seasoned veteran.
While Penna and McCullough are
having career years, part of their suc
cess lies on Neill's shoulders — or
more accurately, her mind. As a stu
dent of the game, Neill gives the
squad a mental edge every time she

steps on the field.
"I love calling pitches for Stanford
Softball," she said. 'Every pitch I call
has a different function, it's fun play
ing devil's advocate and playing mind
games with the hitter. 1 try to stay
away from patterns, knowing they re
member what I did to them in their
last at bat."
Perhaps one of Neill's finest mo
ments behind the plate came during
last weekend's 3-2 victory over No. 4
Arizona. Neill and McCullough
teamed together to hold the potent
Wildcat offense to two runs and five
hits for the stunning upset. The victo
ry was less than surprising for Neill.
however.
"Arizona's thinking is very text
book in the way that they approach
an at bat," Neill said. "Playing with
that was really fun because in a situ
ation where a rise ball would be the
textbook pitch, I'd call a drop in and
they would strike out. I felt like we
kept them off balance the entire
game."
Even during the twelve-inning
marathon against Arizona the next
day. Neill hardly felt the pressures of
maintaining the shutout — she al
ready knew Arizona inside out.
"It wasn't nerve-racking calling
pitches for that game." Neill said. "I
did my homework. I watched tape on
Arizona.and I knew what 1 wanted to
throw them. I knew what Missy and
Becky were throwing well, and I felt
that as long as the pitch works, the
batter was not going to get a hit."
"Sunday [against Arizona] was a
moral victory," she added.

Beyond the mental aspects of the
job. the pitcher-catcher relationship is
one built on trust. Fortunately. Neill
has had no problem integrating into
the Stanford bullpen, especially with
the welcoming arms of Penna and Mc-
Cullough.
"It's a blast catching for those
two," Neill said. "They work really
hard, and it's the first time I've been
really good friends with the people
I'm catching. When they pitch, all
they need to think about is their me
chanics because they know that I will
block anything they throw at me.That
trust is really important and it's some
thing you can't manufacture."
Neill has helped the somewhat
shaky Stanford defense this season.
She boasts a .989 fielding percentage
with only four errors on the season.
She has also shown a strong arm and
good instinct in throwing out runners,
an extraordinary feat in college soft
ball. Last weekend. Arizona's Caitlin
Lowe, who is a perfect 44-for-44 on
stolen bases, tried to run on Neill.
Though Lowe escaped with another
bag. Neill barely missed breaking her
streak.
"I got pretty close to throwing
Lowe out, but I was so angry because
she left five seconds early," Neill said.
Indeed. Lxiwe ended up having to
exit the game after umpires called her
again on leaving the base early.
Neill is also leading the Pacific-10
Conference with three runners
picked off on the season, a by-prod
uct of her mental approach to the
game. One of her pick-offs came last
weekend against Arizona's K'Lee

Arredondo, who was Neill's team
mate last fall on the IJSA Junior Na
tional Team.
"Last weekend, Arredondo was
taking a huge lead-off [on| second
base," Neill said."l long-arm faked to
second, she broke for third and I
picked her off. 1 knew she was an ag
gressive runner from playing with
her, and it was fun picking her off."
With last weekend's trip. Neill is
confident in her team's abilities and
the rest of their season.
"1 feel like after this weekend, we
can beat anybody," Neill said. "We've
had a couple rough games, but after
this weekend and beating Arizona,
and almost [beating them again]
through 12 innings, we really came to
gether Team chemistry is really good
right now."
Just a freshman. Neill is primed to
have an amazing career with the
Stanford program. When asked
about her goals and aspirations as a
Cardinal backstop, she had high ex
pectations.
"When I was starting Softball,
they didn't have it on television."
Neill said. "I would watch baseball
catchers, and footwork on their
throws and how they block the plate,
but I never really tried to be like any
one. I tried to do what would make
me successful and carve my own
niche in Softball."
"1 don't want to be the mini ver
sion of anyone else," she added. "1
just want to be myself."

Freshman Rosey Neill credits Stanford assistant Trisha Ford with helping devel

a mental sport —just ask
freshman catcher Rosey
