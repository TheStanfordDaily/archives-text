# TAXI'S: NOTHING TOO SPECIAL WHEN IT COMES TO GRABBING A BURGER
## 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION TAXI DRIVER 
1 know it's hard to believe that
there is actually a casual American
diner with moderate prices in Palo
Alto, but Taxi's Hamburgers on Uni
versity Drive is one such place. A little
out of place amid fancy Italian and
Thai restaurants. Taxi's is a great
place to go if you want a quick meal or
if you have any little children with
you.
Serving all types of hamburgers,
chicken sandwiches, milkshakes and a
few salads, the menu at Taxi's is most
definitely the stereotypical diner
menu. The prices range from around
five dollars to eight dollars per entree,
but take note that the hamburgers
and sandwiches do not come with
fries! A side order of fries can be or
dered, though, for $1.79. but, in my
honest opinion, the fries were not
worth the money. The chili hamburg-

cr was pretty good, though,
loaded with so much chili on top
that eating by hand would have
been a formidable task. The
chicken tenders were decent,
but my friend, a chicken tenders
expert, prefers the Lagunita
Late Nite chicken tenders much
more. In addition, each serving
only came with three small
chicken tenders. Not too great, I
know. The chicken sandwich,
which came on a whole-wheat
bun with lettuce, mayo and
tomato, is pretty much your typ
ical chicken sandwich â€” noth
ing much else to say about it.
Overall, all the food we tried
was pretty good to mediocre,
but never too special. Even the
banana split we ordered for
dessert in hopes of indulging in a
sweet treat that would make up
for the rest of the mediocre food
was just okay. The ice cream

tasted decent, and although the
requisite whipped cream,
peanuts, cherries and chocolate
syrup were all there, there was
nothing unique about the ba
nana split that would make it
something to talk about. Never
theless, if you are craving a tra
ditional banana split. Taxi's will
surely give you that!
In terms of the service, it was
once again, mediocre. Since you
order at the front counter before
you sit down, there is not much
waiter-table interaction. How
ever, when they messed up one
of our meals, they were quick to
fix it, so no real harm was done.
The atmosphere itself was quite
fun. with car decorations every
where, a nice flat screen TV and
countertops that remind you of
a true diner. There were plenty
of tables, although it felt a bit
stuffy in there. Perhaps the most

amusing part of
the night was
when I put a quar

tor in the jukebox at our table, expect
ing to be able to pick two songs with
that quarter, and nothing happened.
When we asked one of the servers
why it wouldn't work, he replied non
chalantly that they never work. Warn
ing: Do not put your money into the
jukeboxes even though there is a sign
on them to try them out!
So, if you really are craving a ham
burger and are in Palo Alto, or if your
little cousins are in town. I would sug
gest Taxi's for you. Otherwise. Mc-
Donalds. the Treehouse or even the
dining hall will suffice in giving you
the American-style food they pro
vide.
