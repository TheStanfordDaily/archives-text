## Fought a duel lately? Here's the soundtrack for it! 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION BURR 
These are days of tension. The
knowledge that 99% of all other col
lege kids are finishing up finals al
ready has us on edge. Compound this
with draw-ma, midterms, oppressive
heat, and your standard end-of-the-

year-crises, and it's not
surprising that you're

about ready to blow a
fnc#» Rut hpfnrp

I use. Bui oerore
you combust

when a
ninth

person leeches onto
your draw group, pause and consider.
What's the point in laying the verbal
smack down on this poor human
being? It won't end the midterms or
make the weather any cooler. No,
much better to solve the issue while
providing your comrades with greatly
needed entertainment. You see
where I'm going with this - a duel! I'm

not quite sure why duels have faded
from popularity over the years, but re
gardless, it is our Stanford-ian duty to
bring them back. And to help you get
started, here's some mood music.
"Eye of the Tiger" - Survivor
This isn't a song for dueling, but a
song for getting pumped

up, pre-duel.

Listen to it and think of
trumping your opponent.
Rocky-style. (NB: "Gonna
Fly Now" from Rocky I also
works here, and gives you the oppor
tunity to jump around in front of the
Cantor Art Museum, if you're up for
it.)
"Zorro's Theme" - James Horner
For the traditionalists among you,
for whom the word "Duel" inspires
images of sword-wielding heroes bat

tling evil opponents for the sake of
peace and the good of the people, this
is your song.
"Dueling Banjos" - Eric Weissberg
and Deliverance
The perfect song for a duel, espe
cially if you play the banjo (in this
case, you can play the song yourself
for an instrumental smack down). If
you

don't, well, you can duel
to the song anyway. Rec
ollections of Deliverance might
even help to instill fear in your oppo
nent.
"Canned Heat" - Jamiroquai
Should you choose to have a
Napoleon Dynamite-style dance-off
duel, this is your song. Take your op
ponent down with your moves. Just
remember to have your second ready
to step in, should you sprain your wrist

doing the worm.
"Voldemort" - Stuart Cassells
Lest you still mistakenly believe
that duels are only with swords, hark
back to the wizard duel! That's right,
challenge your arch nemesis to a

Harry-Voldemort show
down of magical skills. If
your wand

fails to work,
that's your problem.
"Through the Bamboo For
est" -Tan Dun
The perfcct mood piece for a mar
tial arts duel, a la Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon. If, however, you are
able to perform gravity-defying stunts
in the middle of a bamboo forest, you
have much cooler things going for you
than just your ability to duel.
Create your own duel song!

That's right - rap battle it out. 1
can't offer much musical inspiration
here since your originality is what will
bring down the house (around the
ears of your evil opponent). If this is
the route you choose, good luck to
you. Perhaps, if you're really amaz-

ing, someday you too will
find your music on a list

of "Songs for Duel
ing." There could be
no higher

honor.

This isn't to
say there aren't easier ways out there
to problem solve. After all. for some
issues, a quick sit-down chat or even
the flipping of a coin might be all
that's necessary. But for those with a
sense of flair, for those who want a lit
tle drama in their lives, for those who
want to go all Burr on some antago
nizing Hamilton out there - these
songs are for you.
