## Roxy does cowboy/ninja/bear in bed 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Roxy would like to say. first of all. that she'd
watch that. A cowboy, a ninja and a bear? Hell

yeah. Well, maybe not the bear so much.
Roxy has no particular beef against A

that school across the bay, but bears
arc a little too hairv even for her

practically non-existent stan
dards. But anyway. Roxv's

sure you understand why
she wouldn't mind

watching at least a
little of that ac
d

tion.
Actually, to

be perfectly hon
est, Roxy had

never heard of the game
until this glorious I-

nnssion issue.
She did a lit
tle research
online (Roxy
knows all

the best
sites, if i
you J
know"
what she

means), and
she lound that cowboy-

.v, U ., U w.ci —J
ninja-bear is "a variation ol
rock-paper-scissors where the

r « r ~.
players act the part rather than using their
hands."
As far as Roxy's concerned, rock-paper-scis

sors just rounded the bases from masturbation
(alone or together) to home plate, man. And
she's not gonna argue with that. I lowever, Roxy

would like to take this opportunity to walk
her readers through the advantages and
disadvantages of each option.

For example, rock-paper-

I scissors (read: masturbation) is easy
to, um, pull off pretty discreetly. In
the back of a crowded lecture hall, in an
elevator, in a dark movie theatre or pret-

ty much wherever you feel like it.
In contrast, cowboy-ninja-

bear requires a lot more
room and maybe

some planning
ahead. Did
you take

your
birth
W
control
pills

to avoid pop
ping out a very

hairy cowboy wearing a
ninja mask in nine months? Roxv hopes so.

""■j" "■ " u r"" ,u '
Also, cowboy-ninja-bear requires using your
entire body. You can't do that while wearingjust
anything. Make sure you don't wear something
that will cause you to sweat or get stuck in an
awkward position right in the middle of the ac
tion. Better yet. don't wear anything at all. The

bear is already going to be naked (oh, Berkeley),
and Roxy's sure you'll find ninjas and cowboys
quite accepting, Brokeback Mountain style.
Got all of that? Keep it in mind while Roxy
discusses the merits of each of the three tech
niques in both games. Really, when should you
stick with a simple rock, and when can you bust
out the cowboy? Read on. as Roxy reveals as
only she can.
She'll be honest; you can't accomplish much
with paper. A flat hand gets pretty boring after a
while, and it can really only be used on surfaces
that are relevantly flat. And that's no fun, unless
you want to get kinky. Also, the rock, contrary
to what they may tell you at Sigma Nu. is painful
and really not at all what women want. That
leaves us with scissors, which are useful for

any orifice or organ that needs as lit
tle lovin". It also has a passing re
semblance to the shocker.

which Roxy says, you'll
use at your own risk.
With cowboy-ninja-

bear you can he a little
more creative, be
cause it's harder to

predict individual de
sires in this fantasy
m realm. Is he into cow
■ boy while you're

" all about
ninja? Switch

it up, trade
off, do what
ever you
want to
do, but M
don't"

force yourself to conform to one mold too soon.
Your opponent will be able to guess exactly
what you're up to. Ah, forgot we were discussing
games, did you? Pervs.
Of course, Roxy's a fine one to talk, and she
knows this. She was thinking about sex the
whole time, too, naturally. She wishes you luck
in the application of the knowledge she's im
parted to you today, and, if you ever need to

know down the
line, she prefers
ninjas over cow
boys. And just re
member, it's all a
game.
