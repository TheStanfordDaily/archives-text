Washington, before
heading down to No.

of contests over the
weekend.

The Cardinal (31-14-
1, 6-8-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) is coming off a suc-

cessful weekend against the Arizona schools. Ihe
team lost a 2-0 game against No. 9 Arizona State
before coming back to claim a 3-2 victory over
No. 5 Arizona the next day. Stanford then battled
the Wildcats to a rare 0-0.12-inningtie on Sunday.
I lead coach John Rittman was encouraged by
last week's effort, especially the Cardinal's
pitching.
"I thought we improved in a lot of areas."
Rittman said. "We improved some of the prob
lems we've had with walks and hit batters.The
pitching gave us a chance to win each of those
games."
Sophomore Missy Penna (22-7) and junior
Becky McCullough (9-7) carried the team from

the mound last weekend. Penna pitched 19 in

innings draw against Arizona, allowing

Arizona.
The pitchers' efforts were stymied by excel
lent opposing pitching that tied down the Stan
ford offense,but Rittman was still enthused bv his
team's performance, noting that his hitters were
facing perhaps the strongest pitchers they will see
all year.
"We faced probably the two best pitchers in
the conference, at least statistically." Rittman said
of last weekend's competition.

against Washington (32-13,9-6 Pac-10).'ITie
Cardinal will need all the runs it can get
against the Huskies and UCLA (33-13,9-
6), which boasts a conference-best .315
team batting average.
Having met just two weeks ago. these
teams know each other well. Rittman
thinks Stanford can take UW and UCLA
down a peg by concentrating on funda
mentals.
"We haven't peaked yet," Rittman said.
"We still need to get timely hits. Washing
ton and UCLA are in winning streaks; we
need to go in and do the little things to win
games."
Stanford will be looking to junior sec
ond baseman Tricia Aggabao for some of
those timely hits. Aggabao was the only
Cardinal player to hit in all three games last
weekend — she was 3-for-6 while the rest
of the team went 4-for-89 — and she drove
in the game-winning runs against Arizona.
Strangely silent for the past few games
has been freshman center fielder Alissa
Haber. Rittman moved her back into the
leadoff spot for the ASU-Arizona series
but Haber did not get a hit on the weekend.

extending her hitless streak to four games,
which was preceded by a 12-game hitting
streak. Haber still leads the Cardinal in bat
ting average at .357.
RBI leaders Michelle Smith and Rosey
Neill also went hitless last weekend and will
have to start producing again if the pitchers
need any kind of significant run support
against Washington or UCLA.
They will be opposed by the Huskies'
Danielle Lawrie (21-8) and UCLA fresh
man Megan Langenfeld (10-1). Lawrie is
fifth in the Pac-10 with a 1.57 FRA. Stan
ford will have seen enough of strikeout
pitchers after last weekend, but the team
will have to face another one in Lawrie,
who has 335 punch-outs on the year. Lan
genfeld has come on strong of late. She
has yet to reach 100 innings on the year,
but her quality and 1.38 FRA are unques
tionable.
The Cardinal will also have to contend
with Washington's Dena Tyson and three
high-average hitters from UCLA at the
plate.Tyson is hitting and has 17 home
runs (second in the conference) in the 2007
season, while UCLA's Krista Colburn
(.407), Lisa Dodd (.388) and Jodie Legaspi
(.367) are all among the Pac-10's top nine
hitters. Legaspi is a power threat too, with
11 doubles and 11 homers.

need to go in and do the little things to win
games."
Stanford will be looking to junior sec
ond baseman Tricia Aggabao for some of
those timely hits. Aggabao was the only
Cardinal player to hit in all three games last
weekend — she was 3-for-6 while the rest
of the team went 4-for-89 — and she drove
in the game-winning runs against Arizona.
Strangely silent for the past few games
has been freshman center fielder Alissa
Haber. Rittman moved her back into the
leadoff spot for the ASU-Arizona series
but Haber did not get a hit on the weekend.

extending her hitless streak to four games,
which was preceded by a 12-game hitting
streak. Haber still leads the Cardinal in bat
ting average at .357.
RBI leaders Michelle Smith and Rosey
Neill also went hitless last weekend and will
have to start producing again if the pitchers
need any kind of significant run support
against Washington or UCLA.
They will be opposed by the Huskies'
Danielle Lawrie (21-8) and UCLA fresh
man Megan Langenfeld (10-1). Lawrie is
fifth in the Pac-10 with a 1.57 FRA. Stan
ford will have seen enough of strikeout
pitchers after last weekend, but the team
will have to face another one in Lawrie,
who has 335 punch-outs on the year. Lan
genfeld has come on strong of late. She
has yet to reach 100 innings on the year,
but her quality and 1.38 FRA are unques
tionable.
The Cardinal will also have to contend
with Washington's Dena Tyson and three
high-average hitters from UCLA at the
plate.Tyson is hitting and has 17 home
runs (second in the conference) in the 2007
season, while UCLA's Krista Colburn
(.407), Lisa Dodd (.388) and Jodie Legaspi
(.367) are all among the Pac-10's top nine
hitters. Legaspi is a power threat too, with
11 doubles and 11 homers.
