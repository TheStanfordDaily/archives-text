# SORGI SNAPS BACK INTO STELLAR FORM
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
To baseball players across the
country, the first day of a new
season presents opportunity
and excitement. But on opening
night in 200 ft. Adam Sorgi was
filled with frustration instead of opti
mism.
Coming off a breakout sophomore
year in 2(X)5. in which he led the team in
batting average, the California native
tound himself not on the field, but on the
operating table. During training, Sorgi
suffered a set of complications from a
torn labrum in his left shoulder — a
problem he had played with since high
school — and he could no longer put off
surgery.
"I'd dislocated my shoulder probably
twelve times since 1 had been here at
Stanford," Sorgi said. "It bothered me
my sophomore year, but not enough to
stop playing. [Before the 2(X)6 season] I
had an incident where one of the nerves
kind of died on me after another disloca
tion, so I had to get it fixed, and it's been
a long process back."'
The operation successfully repaired
Sorgi's shoulder, but it effectively ended
his season before it had even begun. For
someone who has been playing baseball
his entire life, watching from the dugout
was too much to handle.
"For the first half of the season, 1
couldn't even get myself to watch the
games," Sorgi said. "I took the quarter
off, and when I got back to school, 1 real
ly didn't feel like coming to the baseball
field because it was just so tough to see
my teammates out there playing and not
be able to go out there with them."
On opening day 2007, almost a year
to the day after the surgery, Sorgi started
his comeback. Unable to throw consis
tently without pain at shortstop, the
coaching staff penciled him in at desig
nated hitter against Cal State Fullerton.
I le struggled in his debut, going 0-for-3
with three strikeouts.
"We were hoping that he'd be healthy
enough to play because he really helps us
both defensively and. obviously, offen

sively," head coach Mark Marquess said.
"But tor the first third of the season, he
didn't come around as quickly as we had
hoped. It hurt him too much to throw,
and to be honest, 1 think it affected his
swing a little bit."
After the rocky start, steps were taken
to ensure success. To lessen the strain on
his arm, Sorgi was moved from shortstop
to second base. And in order to regain his
timing at the plate, he waited almost an-

other two months before coming back as
an everyday player on Mar. 24.
"I have to thank my teammates for
making the transition easy," Sorgi said."l
had a couple struggles in the beginning,
but they all welcomed me back and
made me feel really comfortable, which
has helped get me to where I am right
now."
So far, the extra wait has been worth
it. Since returning to the lineup on a daily
basis, Sorgi resumed the type of offen
sive production that earned him an All
Pac-10 honorable mention in his last full
season. He currently leads the team with
a .390 batting average, and last week
Sorgi was honored with his first Pac-10
Player of the Week award after going 11 -
for-20 at the plate with seven RBI.
"He's a clutch hitter," Marquess said.
"He'll pull the ball or hit the other way.
I le's really tough to defend because he
can use the whole field and you don't
know where he is going hit it."
"Right now I'm trying to see a lot of
pitches and make good barrel contact,
trusting that when I get on base the other
guys will drive me in." Sorgi said. "We've
had a tough time getting shut down by a
lot of pitchers getting complete games,
so 1 think if we get some pitchers to

throw some more pitches and get to the
bullpen, we'll have a little hit more suc
cess."
Even with the personal success, the
2(X)7 season has been a trying one for the
entire Stanford team.The perennial Pac
-10 power has struggled to a 3-12 confer
ence record and is still looking for its first
conference series win. As one of only
two players with four years of experi
ence on the Farm, Sorgi tries to relay this

Stanford second baseman overcomes injury to rise to
new heights offensively and lead the Cardinal

tradition to the younger players.
"Obviously we're having a tough
year, so I don't think a lot of people have
the perspective on what Stanford base
ball is and what it's all about winning
wise." Sorgi said."l tell the younger guys
to believe in the system and trust it. It's
going to turn around."
Currently. Sorgi remains undecided
about his future at Stanford. Drafted in
the 49th round of the 2003 MLB First-
Year Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies,
Sorgi still has a year of NCAA eligibility
left, but it the right situation comes
along, he feels ready to make the leap.
"1 can't control the draft, and I can't
control where 1 go." Sorgi said."lf a team
likes me and they pick me up.and 1 think
it's valuable enough to start my profes
sional career, I'm going to do that. If not,
1 know I have another year here at the
Farm to have some fun and hopefully get
back to the winning ways."
Hut no matter what uniform he wears
next year. Sorgi will carry the memory of
opening day 2006 and the season he
missed, appreciating his time on the dia
mond just a little bit more.
