## Organisms to model 
### 
Imagine a creature that changes
gender to avoid same-sex mating.
Or how about a creature that,
when starved, thickens its skin and
stays motionless for a month. These
strange creatures are de rigeur for bi
ologists.
Scientists count on model organ
isms to study all manner of biologi
cal processes and diseases. For ex
ample, the common ancestry of mice
and men means that mice can be
studied to learn about human can
cer. Mice and rats are familiar model
organisms, but scientific research
has some lesser-known heroes.
One such hero, favored by devel
opmental biologists, is C. elegans. This
tiny roundworm is only one millime
ter long. It is übiquitous in soil, espe
cially near rotting vegetation, and its
favorite snack is E. coli bacteria. And
by human standards, it's very weird.
First of all, there are no female C.
elegans. There are males, and there
are hermaphrodites. The hermaph
rodites can fertilize their own eggs,
because they have special sperm
holding tanks between their ovaries
and uteruses. As the eggs make their
way down to the uterus, they pick up
sperm and are fertilized.
This would be ideal, except for the
fact that a hermaphrodite has far
more eggs than sperm. Left to its own
devices, the hermaphrodite can fertil
ize a few hundred eggs, but its leftover
gametes go to waste.
So the hermaphrodite takes a
lover. A male C. elegans has a special
fan-shaped tail that he uses to deposit
some rather unconventional sperm.
These sperm aren't swimmers, like
the kind used by civilized humans. In
stead, C. elegans sperm are amoeboid
blobs that drag themselves by their
pseudopods up to the hermaphrodite
sperm tanks. Once there, they out
compete the hermaphrodite's own
sperm to fertilize up to 1000 eggs.
This works out just fine for most
worms. Unfortunately, a few have cer
tain awkward mutations that make re
production a bit difficult. Some of the
first mutations in C. elegans were dis
covered when scientists noticed two
so-called "vulvar mutants."
One is a horrifying mutant called
multivulva. (You can probably imag
ine what it looks like.) Frightening as
multivulva worms are. vulvaless
worms have an even bigger problem.
When they get pregnant, their off
spring are trapped inside.These babies
develop inside their parent, wriggling
around nauseatingly as they eat their
way out.
A less disgusting aspect of C. ele
gans biology is its life cycle. The
worm goes through four larval
stages, getting bigger and bigger

ALEX NARUHIKO CHEE/The Stanford Daily
until it reaches adult size.
If things go wrong, however, the
worm can opt out of development and
move into suspended animation. In
response to lack of food, temperature
changes, or overcrowding, C. elegans
changes into "dauer larvae."
Dauer larvae are small, and they
don't move around much. They can't
eat, because their mouths are sealed
shut. "Dauer" in German means "en
during", and indeed, the worms can
survive in this state for more than two
months, until conditions improve and
they resume normal development.
C. elegans is so hearty that it was
the only living creature to survive the
Columbia space shuttle disaster.
When the shuttle broke up, it was car
rying more than 60 scientific experi
ments, with animals including bees,
fish and spiders. The other animals
perished, but the C. elegans were
found in the rubble, swimming in
their Petri dishes inside a metal lock
er. totally oblivious to the tragedy.
Another model organism may
not have survived any shuttle crash
es, but if you like kegstands, you
should appreciate it.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the
kind of yeast responsible for the fer
mentation of beer. But the organism
is even more valuable to scientists. A
yeast cell is remarkably like a human
cell, and many human cell cycle pro
teins were discovered by first finding
their counterparts in yeast.
Yeast has two mating types,
called "a" and "CX" The fungus can
reproduce by pinching off smaller
clones, but it also likes to mix up its
genetic material. Special mating
pheromones let "(t" cells know
when "a" cells are near, and vice

versa.
ITien. each cell grows a special
projection called a shmoo (no joke)
in the direction of the opposite-gen
dered cell.The cells eventually fuse,
exchanging DNA.
Yeasts have emphatically rejected
the gender binary. Haploid yeast cells
are either type "a" or type "a", but
they can switch if they need to.
An "Ct" cell has the "CX" gene, but
it has also has a silent copy of the "a"
gene. When it wants to swap sexes,
special enzymes chop up the DNA
where the "Ct" gene was. and replace
that gene by copying the DNA from

the waiting "a" gene. Ingenious, right?
As strange as we might find them,
humans are not as removed from
these creatures as we might think. Sci
entists recently uncovered 150 genes
involved in C. elegans fat storage, and
100 percent of those had direct coun
terparts in humans.
And human cancer research has
an ally in yeast cells, which accumu
lates DNA damage much like human
cells. After all. we share 35 percent of
our genes with the lowly roundworm,
and 23 percent with the yeast.
Unfortunately, we missed out on
their sweet powers, like suspended
animation and gender-swapping. Sud
denly, 1 think humans got the raw end
of the evolutionary deal.

until it reaches adult size.
If things go wrong, however, the
worm can opt out of development and
move into suspended animation. In
response to lack of food, temperature
changes, or overcrowding, C. elegans
changes into "dauer larvae."
Dauer larvae are small, and they
don't move around much. They can't
eat, because their mouths are sealed
shut. "Dauer" in German means "en
during", and indeed, the worms can
survive in this state for more than two
months, until conditions improve and
they resume normal development.
C. elegans is so hearty that it was
the only living creature to survive the
Columbia space shuttle disaster.
When the shuttle broke up, it was car
rying more than 60 scientific experi
ments, with animals including bees,
fish and spiders. The other animals
perished, but the C. elegans were
found in the rubble, swimming in
their Petri dishes inside a metal lock
er. totally oblivious to the tragedy.
Another model organism may
not have survived any shuttle crash
es, but if you like kegstands, you
should appreciate it.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the
kind of yeast responsible for the fer
mentation of beer. But the organism
is even more valuable to scientists. A
yeast cell is remarkably like a human
cell, and many human cell cycle pro
teins were discovered by first finding
their counterparts in yeast.
Yeast has two mating types,
called "a" and "CX" The fungus can
reproduce by pinching off smaller
clones, but it also likes to mix up its
genetic material. Special mating
pheromones let "(t" cells know
when "a" cells are near, and vice

ITien. each cell grows a special
projection called a shmoo (no joke)
in the direction of the opposite-gen
dered cell.The cells eventually fuse,
exchanging DNA.
Yeasts have emphatically rejected
the gender binary. Haploid yeast cells
are either type "a" or type "a", but
they can switch if they need to.
An "Ct" cell has the "CX" gene, but
it has also has a silent copy of the "a"
gene. When it wants to swap sexes,
special enzymes chop up the DNA
where the "Ct" gene was. and replace
that gene by copying the DNA from

the waiting "a" gene. Ingenious, right?
As strange as we might find them,
humans are not as removed from
these creatures as we might think. Sci
entists recently uncovered 150 genes
involved in C. elegans fat storage, and
100 percent of those had direct coun
terparts in humans.
And human cancer research has
an ally in yeast cells, which accumu
lates DNA damage much like human
cells. After all. we share 35 percent of
our genes with the lowly roundworm,
and 23 percent with the yeast.
Unfortunately, we missed out on
their sweet powers, like suspended
animation and gender-swapping. Sud
denly, 1 think humans got the raw end
of the evolutionary deal.
