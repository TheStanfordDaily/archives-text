# Movie Review
## Too many holes in this spider's web 
### LAUREN OTERO INTERMISSION SPIDERWOMAN 
For those craving no-strings-attached action.
Director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 has disap
pointment written all over its spandex-clad char
acters. The special effects are there, hut so are the
classic one-liners, dialogue chocks full of life les
sons and the ongoing love story between Spider
man/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary
Jane (kirsten Dunst). Beyond the characteriza-

tions that defined the pre
vious two movies, Spider-
Man 3 offers several new
villains, including the
Sandman (Thomas
Haden Church) and
Venom (Topher Grace).
The Sandman unleashes
his powers when inflicting
destruction and evading
capture. Venom is partic
ularly unsightly, with an
uncanny resemblance to
one of the creatures from

the Alien movies.These newcomers serve up both
super-human powers and a thirst for destruction,
and yet somehow express distinctly human de
sires. In short. Spider-Man 3 attempts to fuse ac
tion with the sentimentality of a classic drama.
The film goes as far as to incorporate a reli
gious thread that for me undermined the pure fri
volity of Spider-Man the comic. When a film
promises action, explosions, fight scenes and com
puter enhanced special effects, sentimental plot
lines are only appreciated if they are well- execut
ed. For those expecting Spider-Man the greater
than-human action flick, not Spider-Man the life
altering drama/romance, be prepared for utter
disappointment. Lines such as "I'm not a bad per
son. I've just had bad luck." punctuated by the
quivering jaw line and tear filled eyes of one of
Spider-Man's foes, do not have the intended af
fect. While a film based on a comic book character
is expected to deliver a little cheese and the occa
sional contrived one-liner, Spider-Man 3 loses
points for delivering one too many. The film fails
to balance the frivolous with the profound.
Despite failures at substance and truly inspir
ing plot points, the film has its moments where the
larger-than-life acting and corny dialogue are an
asset rather than a detriment. At one point in the
film. Spider-Man comes to resemble an emo ver
sion of himself. Think Spidey a la Pete Wentz of
the band Fall Out Boy. Adorned in eyeliner, side
bangs and a snazzy getup, Maguire's hyperbolic
performance adds a much-needed comedic flare
unique to this chapter of the Spider-Man series.
Ultimately, Spider-Man 3 delivers a formulaic
comic-strip action film with enticing special ef
fects and a showdown between superhero and
mortal enemy. For those unwilling to forgive sug
arcoated sentimentalism, this film is not for you.
