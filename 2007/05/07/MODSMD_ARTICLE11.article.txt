## No fumbles at Jimmy V's Sports Cafe 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION GOOD SPORT 
Even if you don't look like a jock, you can still eat
like one. At Jimmy V's Sports Cafe, in fact,you can load
up on the same grilled fare as some of the best student
athletes in the country.
Due to its location in the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center on Campus Drive (opposite Maples Pavilion),
athletes frequent the cafe on their way to and from
practice. From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.. the cafe opens to the rest
of the public as well, with a variety of burgers, hot sand
wiches and drinks.
In short, the cafe excels at being ordinary. Walking in.
you might suspect you've taken a wrong turn and ended
up in a high school cafeteria, misled by the tiled floors,
fluorescent lights and conventional round tables. I"he
menu. too. will remind you of others; Jimmy V's sells
burgers and tuna melts, and every order can be upgrad
ed for a nominal fee to include a side (fries, onion rings
or a small salad) and a fountain drink. Upon entering,
my mother waxed nostalgic about Sports Cafe's striking
similarity to Luncheonette, a diner in Miami she visited
weekly with her mother en route to Five & Dime. Be
fore you reconcile Sports Cafe to complete diner obscu
rity, however, you should taste their burgers.
My mother considers herself somewhat of a burger
connoisseur after a lifetime of burger consumption. She
rarely finishes her burgers (my dad happily intervenes),
but she's tried at least half of them all — Houston's,
Fuddrucker's. Outback... you name it. At Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe, even she learned some new tricks. At the
counter, the server caught her off-guard with an exten
sive list of cheese options — "we've got everything,"
she told my mom. Later, at our private round-table for
two at the window, she devoured every last crumb —
cheese and all.
"It's ample," she said. While she acknowledged that
"hot and juicy" was a burger cliche, she applied it re
gardless. Cliche or no. Jimmy V's Sports Cafe makes a
hot and juicy burger.
For those less interested in burgers, the Sports Cafe
offers plenty of alternatives, from the equally hot and
juicy (hot chicken sandwiches, tuna melts, etc.) to the
decidedly cooler wraps and smoothies. The former
comes with a customizable form, allowing vou to choose

the meat (or cheese, if you want the vegetarian) and fill
ings that include everything from cream cheese to salsa.
I ordered the chicken salad variant with romaine let
tuce, red hell peppers, and avocado ($5.95). While I was
disappointed in the proportion of the wrap innards —
the "avocado" was a smear on the edge of the tortilla
and the red bell peppers were diced and sparse — the
wrap itself was hearty and neatly sliced into two man
ageable halves on the ceramic dish. In the future, I'll
pass on the chicken salad (any flavor the shredded
white meat had was easily overwhelmed by the glut of
fluid mayonnaise), but the turkey and pesto combina
tions looked promising. The smoothies, while less cus
tomizable. also offer slight deviation from the classic
flavor blends. What's more, the smoothies all have
names familiar to the Stanford student.The "Arrillaga,"
for example, fuses apple juice, strawberry, banana, blue
berry. peach and ice for only $3.95. The cafe also offers
hot entree specials (when I was there, they served roast
ed salmon, pasta with marinara sauce and rice) and full
Peets Coffee accoutrement.
While the dining experience is more 'diner' than
'cafe,' Jimmy V's dazzles with its mastery of old fa
vorites. Besides, even if Jimmy V's was shooting for ac
curacy with its name.'diner' sounds about as Stanford as
the golden bear. For burger fans. Jimmy V's Sports Cafe
is as good as it gets.
