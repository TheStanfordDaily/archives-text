## Editorial Board ASSU senators: Grow up 
### 
With the ASSU election fiasco seem
ingly behind us. we were disap
pointed to see divisive contention
rear its ugly head again —this time among
members of the newly sworn in senate.
Recrimination and polarization reigned
during last week's almost three-hour Senate
meeting. Amidst possible re-votes and the
narrowest of victories, the senators selec
tion of the chamber's chair and deputy chair
suggested a divide between Students of
Color Coalition-(SOCC) and Stanford Re
view-supported candidates. In reality, be
yond the hype of factionalism, senators who
are endorsed by either organization ex
pressed similar goals in their respective
platforms.
Was the contentious meeting an anom
aly. or are we witnessing the beginnings of a
two-party system on campus? Regardless,
actions from the past meeting set an alarm
ing precedent for Senate agendas to come.
The student body is left wondering whether

all meetings will be reduced to tight 8-7 vote
counts where two swing senators make the
difference.
If this pattern continues, the wishes of
seven senators — almost half the Senate —
will constantly be pushed to the side in favor
of that of the remaining eight. In such a case,
the Senate is rendered useless and will not
be able to enact any type of meaningful res
olution. This perpetuates the widely-held
student body conception of the ASSU Sen
ate as a do-nothing circus where antics and
theatrics trump reason and discourse.
Instead of polarizing and marginalizing
the institution, senators should work to
gether in the spirit of compromise. We don't
expect full unity, and we would be dis
pleased if the body became a unitary rubber
stamp, as it has sometimes been in the past.
If the ASSU Senate wants to claim the le
gitimacy that comes with representing us,
senators must move beyond childish bicker
ing.
