# Stuck in a rut
## 
### 
What do you do when life gets you
down? I've spent a lot of time late
ly thinking about this question. I
guess you could say I'm in a rut. Yes, a rut. A
major rut or a minor rut — I'm not sure
which. But it's one that I can't seem to shake.
I'm not known for being a sympathetic
fellow, which, if you think about it. is kind of
sad. It's even worse when I'm acting like an
Emo-tool myself — not much in the way of
sympathy comes this direction. Oh. deli
cious karma! But enough with feeling sorry
for myself, enough with the Emo antics
("Crawling in my skin." etc.). Plus, how can
I study for midterms when my bangs are so
long I can't see? Luckily. I've got a solution.
I'm talking about Bawls. I am sorely in
need of some Bawls.
Bawls are delicious. Refreshing. ITiey
have such a wonderful texture, perfectly
adapted to fit in the palm of one's hand.They
make me happy. They even sharpen my
motor skills to such a degree that I could
smoke any noob who tries to 1 v 1 me in War
craft 111. Bawls make me want to sing songs
of freedom.They make me want to shout out
and declare my love of Bawls to the world.
Hallelujah! Hooray for Bawls! I shall wor
ship thv sacred liquid, for it is my lifeblood in
times of need.
Sure, instead of feeding my addiction to
Bawls. I could do the "healthy" thing, and
you know, pick up a new sport, run around
our world-famously-second-largest-in-the
world campus a bit. go for a peaceful hike in
the wildfire-ravaged California wilderness,
take a dip in nearby Roble pool, or paddle a
kayak across scenic Lake La... Whoops,
scratch that option.
So what's so great about Bawls, you in
quire. Hie answer to that question can only
be revealed through firsthand experience.
Bawls require an intimate, personal connec
tion with their beholder. Nevertheless. I feel
compelled to share stories of my love for
Bawls with all the world, so that some of you
might turn to it in times of need.
Bawls were hard to come by when I first
discovered them.That was back in the sum
mer of '01. when I was filing medical records
at Mass. General Hospital by day and log
ging eight hours of Warcraft by night. Ah yes.
the good life. I had happened upon a War
craft forum (yes. we had the internet back
then) and was clicking about, my naive eyes
wide-open, when I saw a thread started by
one of my Warcraft idols: a guy named Cecil.
One portentous click and a few microsec
onds later (yes, we had cable), images began
to crystallize on my screen. A glowing blue
light, like a deity descended from cyber
heaven, in full pixilated splendor, shimmer
ing before me — all was revealed: BAWLS.

It was love at first sight.
Since then, my love has blossomed and
matured. Bawls has played such an instru
mental role in my young life, it's impossible
to overstate. I got stories to tell you. man.
Stories. Me and Bawls, we go way back. I re
member our first date, when Bawls gave me
the strength to help me pwn some noob on
Warcraft. I remember that time, up in Ver
mont. when my friends and I nearly killed
each other fighting over Bawls. I raced
around the room. Bawls in hand.jumping up
and down like a madman, hollering:
"MORI BAWLS. MORE FIGHTING." Or
when Bawls pulled me through the
insanity/inanity of college applications. Or
that time when my dad and roommate bond
ed over [my obsession with] Bawls during
Parents' Weekend freshman year. Yeah,
Bawls and me. we're pretty tight. Have you
ever biked ten miles down HI Camino at
night to get your Bawls fix? Yeah, only spe
cial 7-Elevens stock the stuff.
Oh. yes, I suppose I neglected to mention
a rather essential detail: Bawls has something
like 2.5 times more caffeine than coffee! So
it's like Red Bull, but way more delicious
(not to mention it comes in sexy blue bot
tles). And. most importantly of all. they sell it
at CoHo, which might explain why I'm be
grudginglv seated on this dilapidated sofa,
my ears violated by obnoxious hip-hop music
blaring in the background, as I poke away at
the keyboard in vain, struggling to condense
my overflowing love for Bawls into a space of
X()() words — a manifestly impossible task. I
could write a novel about Bawls.
But for now, the joy of Bawls will suffice
to get me out of this funk I'm in. Bawls is the
light at the end of the tunnel — due reward
for dedicated effort, whether in school. War
craft, or in pursuit of the Epic.
In fact, there's a bottle standing proud
right beside me. its glass body hued in shades
of a mystical cerulean, looking absolutely
regal — a symbol of hope. Peace, love, and
joy wrapped up in a 10 fl. oz. bottle.
Be happy. Drink Bawls.

Alex wants to he the campus rep for Bawls, so
he can feed his addiction for the low, low price
of FREE. If you want more in formation, in
