# The

I'm taking a week off classes (and column)
to go to the south of France. But in the
mean time, enjoy the musings of my good
friend and very talented writer, John Maas:
Have you ever heard of the Bois de
Boulogne? Or. perhaps a better question:
I lave you ever heard of the prostitutes of the
Bois de Boulogne? Apparently, they are
world-famous. I swear I remember them
being in I"he Da Vinei Code, and my Paris
guidebook refers in lurid detail to the cele
brated Brazilian transvestites who work the
Bois at night.
The Bois itself is maybe best known for of
fering more... genteel pleasures to the citi
zens of Paris. A person can come to the Bois
to boat on its lakes, hike on its trails.or ride its
miniature train among the trees and streams.
That's exactly what we did this past Tuesday,
having the day off and welcoming a change of
pace. In fact, the Bois is technically a British
— or "Angloehinoise." in the case of the cor
ner we visited — garden in style, so it pro
vides a welcome respite from the rigid for
mality of Paris's cultured parks. No gravel
here, no trees tormented into unnatural
shapes, just soft green lawns and clusters of
plants. It was an agreeable place to spend the
afternoon.
As the sun set. we decided to take our leave
of the Bois. Since this is Paris, the park is
laced with a number of broad, leafy avenues,
and we set off down the side of one towards
the entrance gates.The air was calm, the sky
warm and inviting... it was a beautiful

evening. And suddenly, to our left, we saw a
prostitute. It was as though she had emerged
from behind a tree trunk or something, like a
wood nymph, except wearing a bright pink
minidress. She ran a comb through her blond
wig and looked at us with pouty eyes. There
was no doubt as to her occupation.
We walked and saw another, another,
more. Sinuous figures with fabulously tacky
clothing, pacing and swaying. Like most
Parisians, they wore black — our first friend,
with her pink, was apparently an eye-pop
ping anomaly. Each had a little leaf-lined
glade set back from the road in which she
sashayed. In general, it felt like a perverted
reimagining of window shopping. If I remem
ber correctly, the French expression for win
dow shopping is literally "licking the win
dows." What a disturbing image that brings to
mind right now!
The great irony of all this, of course, is that
TUesday was May Day, the international cel
ebration of workers and the reason we had
the day off. On such a holiday France is sup
posed to close entirely, giving every laborer a

chance to rest. And indeed this is largely true,
even in a city like Paris; its international fla
vor gives way to its Frenchness for once.
Every non-essential store is closed, even big
chains, and only a handful of restaurants,
cafes, and grocery stores are open (although
the anxious reader will be glad to know we
were still able to buy food for a picnic). And
yet there in the Bois.what was to be, I'm sure,
a long and unpleasant workday was just be
ginning. Some professions don't get the day
off — police, bus drivers, pilots, and appar
ently at least one other as well.
I'm tempted to point out some kind of con
nection between the hard-working prosti
tutes and the contentious issue of the French
workweek, so prominent in the upcoming
elections,but I'll resist.To be honest, I'm not
quite sure what to make of those prostitutes.
Are they a scandal? Are they a sign of liberal
European attitudes? Apparently they're an
institution; is that better or worse than them
being a dirty secret?
1 should stop speculating. We left the pros
titutes behind that night and traipsed around
Paris, looking for a restaurant, dining out,
coming home to our host families or (in my
case) prison-esque dormitory mattress. But
coming home in any case. I doubt the workers
in the Bois de Boulogne got to do that until
well after sunrise, workers' holiday or not.
