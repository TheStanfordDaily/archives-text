## Yes, dialogue is good 
### TALA AL-RAMAHI 
As a representative of Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME), I
would like to thank and commend
Carrie Mlynarczyk and Mark Donig for ac
knowledging the fact that CJME has been
open to co-hosting events that foster mutual
understanding and cooperation on the Is
raeli Palestinian conflict ("Divestment de
feated for good reason." May 3). However. I
am a little disappointed that they have paint

ed the Stanford Israel Alliance as the pur
veyor of dialogue and peace while neglect
ing to mention the many attempts by both
Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI) and the ASSU to organize a town
hall meeting on divestment.
They also failed to mention that CJME
has recently presented the Stanford Israel
Alliance (SI A) with an opportunity to co
host an event by members of Combatants
for Peace, an NCiO that was co-founded by
ex-Palestinian combatants and ex-Israeli

soldiers who have renounced violence, and
are now working hand-in-hand in ending
the occupation through dialogue and
other non-violent means. Unfortunately,
SI A has refused that invitation because
CJME has signed SCAI's divestment peti
tion.
CJME is interested in dialogue. As a mat
ter of fact. Tim Gregory (CJMFi's financial
officer) and I have both been devoted mem
bers of a student-initiated dialogue group
called Seeking Harmony in Israel and Pales

tine. Dialogue is important, especially in un
derstanding the "other" side. It's important
to realize that both sides are emotionally
and personally invested in this conflict, a no
tion that is commonly lost between the rhet
oric of politicians and other so-called repre
sentatives of the Palestinian and Israeli peo
ples.
Dialogue alone, however, cannot achieve
everything that we hope for. CJME. just like
SIA and (surprise) SCAI, is committed to
achieving a just peace and an end to the oc

cupation through non-violent means. Di
vestment is one of those means, hut our deci
sion to sign SCAI's petition certainly does
not mean that we do not wish to genuinely
pursue dialogue.To vilify us and to sever ties
with us because of our decision is unfortu
nate and unproductive.
