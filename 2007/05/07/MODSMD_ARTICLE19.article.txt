## Stanford misses threepeat, 22-21 Rogby loses national title to Penn State 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a packed Steuber Rugby Stadium on
Saturday, one powerhouse hoisted the
USA Rugby collegiate championship tro
phy. and another saw its bid for a three
peat turned away. Penn State finally bested
Stanford in club women's rugby, riding
four consecutive tries to a 22-21 victory
over the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal, which had beaten the
Nittany Lions in the past two national fi
nals.
A furious comeback by Stanford in the
last 10 minutes turned a 22-0 deficit into a
one-point game, but the Cardinal simply
ran out of time.
"We got stuck on defense a lot; they had
the ball constantly, which we don't like,"
junior captain Melissa Smit said. "We did
well at the end. If we'd had another minute
or two. we could've pulled a win out of our
pocket."
Penn State set the tone early on with a
try just six minutes into the game; a
missed conversion gave the Nittany Lions
a 5-0 lead. Eighteen minutes later, the
lead increased to 10-0 as Stanford spent

GAME NOTES: Stanford failed to three-peat as the
USA Rugby champions. The past two years, the
Cardinal was able to hold off Penn State from the
title, 53-6 and 15-12. This year, after being down
22-0, Stanford's late-game comeback wasn't
enough to reclaim the championship.
the entire first halt defending its own
goal line.
With five minutes to go in the 40-
minute half, Penn State was awarded
a penalty try after the Cardinal was
called for killing the ball. Ibis time,
the conversion was good, running the
score to 17-0. Two more visits across
Stanford's goal line in the last minute
of the period resulted in no points,
thanks to a hold-up and a forward
pass call on the Nittany Lions.
Stanford had enormous difficulty
hanging on to the ball and making
passes, taking the team's talented
wings and fullback out of the game.
'ITie Cardinal could rarely move the
ball out of its own backyard, giving
Penn State frequent offensive oppor
tunities.
The second half opened much like
the first, with Penn State pounding
away in Stanford territory. The de
fense was breached again at the 56-
minute mark, with the Nittany Lions
converting to build a staggering 22-0
lead and shock the home crowd.

Stanford's offense, smothered for
the first 70 minutes of the game, came
alive in the final minutes to make it
close. A brilliant breakaway by senior
Carey Myslewski led to a try by
coterm Olivia Anglade, with the suc
cessful conversion trimming the score
to 22-7. Just three minutes later,
Myslewski struck again, taking a pass
near midfield all the way to the goal to
make it an eight-point game.
The team's ball-handling woes,
however, doomed the comeback as
mishandled passes ruined two prom
ising offensive sequences. Although
Stanford scored to nearly even it out
at 22-21, freshman Jessica Watkins
scored with no time remaining. Ibe
officials declined to put additional
time on the clock, deflating the stand
ing-room only crowd and awarding
Penn State the national champi
onship.
Penn State reclaimed the title it
won in 2004 before Stanford defeated
the Lions in back-to-back finals by 53-
6 and 15-12 margins. Hype began

building for this game with a You l übe
video prepared by Stanford team
members chronicling the past two
title matches. ITie stakes were con
firmed when both teams qualified on
Friday for the final — Stanford with a
45-10 win over UC-Davis and Penn
State with a 27-3 victory against New
Mexico State.
Several Cardinal players cried as
they received their second-place
medals. An almost completely shirt
less throng of Penn State fans flocked
from the stands to congratulate the
victors, while a loud. Cardinal-clad
crowd stuck around to support Stan
ford.
Smit says that despite the loss
there's still a lot to be proud of.
"We're really happy with the sea
son overall," she said. "We're the sec
ond team in the country, we accom
plished a lot and had a lot of players
step up...it's been a huge success."
