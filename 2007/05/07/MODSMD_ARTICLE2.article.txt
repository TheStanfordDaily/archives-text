## Wilbur'valet service' opens Plan aims to increase parking capacity amid construction 
### JANET KIM 
Beginning today, drivers who park their cars in
the Wilbur lot will participate in a University-man
dated valet service that aims to ameliorate the park
ing shortages caused by nearby construction.

Parking and Transportation Services (PIS) will
offer attendant-assisted parking in Lot 63, which
currently houses vehicles with

permit types A, C, EA and ES.
The service, available for valid
permit holders weekdays be
tween 9 a.m. and l ) p.m., will re-

quire those parking in the lot to
leave their kevs with attendants.

Drivers retrieve their
keys from the attendants by pre
senting claim checks. After 9

p.m.. keys will be kept in a lockbox
over night.

White flier alerting drivers to the
impending changes were placed under
windshield wipers of cars in the affected
area late last week.

Coming on the heels of a widely
distributed prank flier pretending
to announce new changes to Uni
versity bike laws, some students
expressed disbelief about the new
parking service.
A representative from the Wilbur
Housing Center, however, con
firmed that the attendant-assist
ed parking program was real.
The valet service is one
of several construction-related

parking changes that will occur
today. According to the P I'S Web site, there will he
no parking for the immediate future in front of the
Law School and Stern Hall.

Drivers with type A permits are encouraged to
park in the nearby Vaden. Gould. Florence Moore
orTresidder lots.or along Mayfield Avenue. Vehicles
sporting type EA permits can park in the Stern
Annex andToyon lots, or along Escondido Road.
