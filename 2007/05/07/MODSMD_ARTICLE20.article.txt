GAME NOTES: Sophomore right-hander Missy Penna
pitched a complete-game three hitter against UCLA
yesterday, giving up just one run in the fourth inning.
Penna also hit 2-for-3 on the day Alissa Haber's two
RBI in the win were her first in seven games, as the
freshman center field returns to form.
torn of the fourth inning; with one
out. the bases loaded and a 3-0 Stan
ford lead.coach John Kittnian chose
to trade the Bruin run for a sure out,
and it paid off.
Penna collected a come-backer
from the next batter and threw to
first to end the inning. Only one
UCLA batter got as far as first base
on a fifth-inning walk — for the
rest of the game.
Stanford's lead came courtesy of
Penna herself and freshman center
held Alissa llaber. With junior first
baseman Erin I lowe on second after
a single and a sacrifice by freshman
catcher Rosey Neill. Penna hit a sin
gle to right field, scoring Howe and
giving Stanford a 1-0 in the second
inning. Penna was 2-for-3 on the day.
After the Cardinal stranded a
pair of runners in the top of third,
llaber came through in the next in
ning. After batting in the lead-off
spot for several games, Haber was
moved to third place in the order by
Rittman, in light of her recent 1-for-
l l ) slump.The move paid immediate
dividends. Haber hit a double and
three singles to go 4-for-4. and her
fourth-inning single to right field
scored Penna and senior left fielder
Jackie Rinehart.
I laber's two RBI were her first in
seven games, when she drove in
Stanford's only run against Wash
ington on Apr. 22.
Junior third baseman Michelle
Smith drove Haber home after her
double in the seventh inning to pro
vide an insurance run for the Cardi
nal.
The Stanford offense just did not
have the answer for the opposing
pitching in their previous two
games. Washington's sophomore
pitcher Danielle Lawrie limited the
Cardinal to just three hits in 26 at
bats. while striking out 11. Mean
while. Penna's occasional control
problems were troubling. She gave
up only five hits, but she also walked
four and hit six batters, including
two of the three runners that were
on base when the Huskies' Ashley
Charters hit a grand slam in the
fourth inning to blow the game
open, 4-0.
Another bases-loaded situation
arose in the fifth, with only slightly
less damage resulting. Penna hit the

first two batters before being re
placed by junior Becky McC'ul
lough, who walked another batter
before giving up a pair of singles and
hitting another to bring the game to
its final score, 7-0.
Stanford had to travel from
Washington to UCLA for the next
day's game, but the team left its of
fense behind again in a 3-0 loss to the
Bruins.The Cardinal had four hits in
26 at-bats on Saturday, an improve
ment over the previous game, but
still nothing to write home about.
Penna held UCLA off for the
first five innings, but she finally ca
pitulated in the bottom of the sixth.
The Bruins' Tara Henry led off the
inning with a single and was sacri
ficed over to second base before
Jaisa Creps singled her home. The
next batter. Lisa Dodd.hit a two-run
homer to cap off the scoring for the
game. The Cardinal never advanced
a runner past second base.
Stanford returns to the field on
Tuesday night in a non-conference
game at UC-Davis before wrapping
up the Pac-10 season at home
against Oregon and Oregon State
next weekend.
