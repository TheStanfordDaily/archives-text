# Card battles Wazzu
## Baseball looks for first series victory against Cougars BASEBALL 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball, in last place in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, went on the road to
Pullman, Wash, this weekend to face its clos
est competitor: ninth-place Washington
State. After splitting the first two of three
games against the Cougars, the Cardinal is
still looking for its first Pac-ll) series victory
today, hoping to tie Wazzu in the league
standings.
Saturday marked Stanford's (19-25,4-13
Pac-10) first win in a series opener win
against a league opponent, as the Cardinal
downed the Cougars (22-21. 5-12) by a 6-4
margin. Stanford rode freshman Jeffrey
Inman's first complete game to just their
fourth conference win of the season.
Inman's record improved to 4-2. as the right
hander gave up just one earned run.
"I really didn't have all my pitches going
today, but 1 just let them get themselves out,"
Inman said to GoStanford.com. "I saw they
were swinging at everything, so I was just
trying to get my fastball over and trying to be
more efficient than I've been in my last cou
ple of outings."
Offensively, the Cardinal put on a power
ful show for the Pullman crowd and a televi
sion audience, as the game was broadcast on
FSN Northwest. Sophomore center fielder
Sean Ratliff knocked in four RBI with two
home runs, and junior Michael Taylor hit his
eighth homer of the season on a solo shot to
right center.
"We've been working on a lot of things as
a team." Taylor said to GoStanford.com.
"Those things are starting to pay off now.
Hitting is very contagious, and that's why
we've been able to score a lot of runs the last
couple of weeks."
With the improving Stanford offense —
which had notched double-digit hit totals in
nine straight contests following Saturday's
game — and Inman's strong outing, it was
Stanford's defense that kept things interest
ing for much of the game.The Cardinal gave
