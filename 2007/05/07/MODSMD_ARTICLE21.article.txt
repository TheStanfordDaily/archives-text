# Card battles Wazzu
## Baseball looks for first series victory against Cougars BASEBALL 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball, in last place in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, went on the road to
Pullman, Wash, this weekend to face its clos
est competitor: ninth-place Washington
State. After splitting the first two of three
games against the Cougars, the Cardinal is
still looking for its first Pac-ll) series victory
today, hoping to tie Wazzu in the league
standings.
Saturday marked Stanford's (19-25,4-13
Pac-10) first win in a series opener win
against a league opponent, as the Cardinal
downed the Cougars (22-21. 5-12) by a 6-4
margin. Stanford rode freshman Jeffrey
Inman's first complete game to just their
fourth conference win of the season.
Inman's record improved to 4-2. as the right
hander gave up just one earned run.
"I really didn't have all my pitches going
today, but 1 just let them get themselves out,"
Inman said to GoStanford.com. "I saw they
were swinging at everything, so I was just
trying to get my fastball over and trying to be
more efficient than I've been in my last cou
ple of outings."
Offensively, the Cardinal put on a power
ful show for the Pullman crowd and a televi
sion audience, as the game was broadcast on
FSN Northwest. Sophomore center fielder
Sean Ratliff knocked in four RBI with two
home runs, and junior Michael Taylor hit his
eighth homer of the season on a solo shot to
right center.
"We've been working on a lot of things as
a team." Taylor said to GoStanford.com.
"Those things are starting to pay off now.
Hitting is very contagious, and that's why
we've been able to score a lot of runs the last
couple of weeks."
With the improving Stanford offense —
which had notched double-digit hit totals in
nine straight contests following Saturday's
game — and Inman's strong outing, it was
Stanford's defense that kept things interest
ing for much of the game.The Cardinal gave

first conference series victory today against the sec
ond-to-last Cougars. The Cardinal has lost six
straight series, and with a win today could tie Wash

win against the Cougars was Stanford's first win in a
conference series opener.

on four errors; three of those were commit
ted by freshman shortstop Adam Gaylord.
Stanford failed to keep rolling on Sun
day, though, falling 8-6 in the second game of
the series.The Cardinal led 5-1 heading into
the bottom half of the fourth, but sopho
more lefty Jeremy Bleich was unable to get
out of the inning, giving up four runs over 3.2
frames. Juniors David Stringer and Nolan
Gallagher proved largely ineffective in re
lief, and the Cardinal offense was quiet most
of the game after scoring four runs in the
first two innings.
Meanwhile. Washington State reliever Je
remy Johnson largely shut the Cardinal down,
not allowing a hit over 2.1 innings of work. At
the plate, third baseman Paul Gran was a
force for the Cougars, going 5-5 with a home

Junior designated hitter Brendan
Domaracki and junior second base
man Adam Sorgi were offensive
bright spots for Stanford. Domarac
ki went 2-3 with three RBI and Sorgi
notched two RBI on 3-4 hitting in
the loss.The Cardinal fell just one hit
shy. though, of extending its streak of
double-digit hits to 10 games.
Ihe rubber match of the three
game series will be played at noon
today and broadcast on KZSU radio.
At stake for Stanford is a chance to
snap its streak of six straight series
losses as well as a separate streak of
six straight conference series defeats.
A win would also pull the Cardi
nal even with the Cougars for last
place in the conference standings.
Stanford would still be one game be

Trojans currently sit at seventh place
in the conference with a league
record of 6-9.
