WOMEN'S LACROSSE

The Stanford women's lacrosse
team successfully made history yester
day afternoon when it pulled off a 12-11
upset over top-seeded Denver in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament, claiming the conference
title for the third year in a row. The tour
nament began on Friday with a
blowout, 20-7 victory over St. Mary's
and was followed by an 8-2 defeat of
Oregon on Saturday. The Cardinal had
lost to both Oregon and Denver earlier
in the season, making the conference
championship even sweeter.
Friday's game against St. Mary's saw
goals from 13 different Cardinal play
ers. demonstrating the depth and effi
ciency of the Stanford offense. Fresh
man attack Dana Lindsay led the team
with four goals, followed by her senior
teammate Liz Piselli who had three. Ju
niors Daphne Patterson and Megan
McClain. sophomore Bess Siegfried
and freshman Lauren Schmidt each
notched two of their own.
'Ihe Cardinal took control from the
beginning, leaving for halftime with the
score already racked up at 13-3. After
adding seven more goals in the second
halt the Stanford women had easily
made it past the first round of the
MPS! Tournament, improving their
record to 7-8.
Saturday's game against Oregon
began with a goal by sophomore mid
fielder Maris Perlman. The score was
quickly answered only 26 seconds later,
leading many to believe that the Ducks
were not going to be an easy opponent.
However. Perlman ended all of her
team's doubts with a second goal, initi
ating a set>ring streak that would put the
halftime score at 5-1.
Piselli scored an astonishing five
goals over the course of the game, and
Patterson added one. As a side note, the
game ties Oregon's record of fewest
goals scored in a game. The only other
time the Ducks have scored a mere two
goals was against Northwestern during
their first season.
Sunday's game against Denver
marked the finish of a fantastic tourna
ment for the Cardinal. After losing to
the Pioneers. 12-8. in the regular season,
Stanford was ready and willing to get
even with its greatest conference foe.
Ihe women started out with a strong
first half, thanks to a pair of goals from
Schmidt.
Ihe scoring for the remainder of the
half was close until right before half
time. when Patterson scored two of her
four goals of the game, helping give her
team a 6-4 advantage before heading

into the locker room. Patterson led her
team in goals for the game, followed by
Piselli with three, McClain and Schmidt
with two and freshman Claire Hubbard
with one.

5/4 at Saint Mary's W 20-7
5/5 vs. Oregon W 8-2
5/6 vs. Denver W 12-11
GAME NOTES: Stanford's 12-11 victory over
Denver gave the team its third straight confer
ence title. The Cardinal will find out whether
or not it will be invited to the NCAA Tourna
ment during today's 6 p.m. selection show.
Stanford concludes its regular season with a
9-8 record, winning five of six games down
the stretch.

The second half clinched the victory
for the team: the Cardinal opened with
four unanswered goals in the first 11
minutes of the second half. Although
the Pioneers eventually broke the Car
dinal's streak with a combined four
goals from Kristie Leggio.Ali Fluryand
Lexi Sanders, it was not enough. Stan
ford held the Pioneers scoreless for the
last minute and a half of play to claim
the title.
1 .eggio scored six goals, roughly half
of her team's total, and was honored as
the MPSF Player of the Year for the
second straight year. Several Stanford
players were honored for their impres
sive performances in the tournament.
Piselli. Patterson and junior defense
man Katharine Fox were awarded as
All -Tou rname nt perfcirme rs.
Junior goaltender I .aura Shane did a
stellar job in the tournament, racking
up 2K saves over the course of three
days. I lei accomplishments earned her
the honor of the Most Valuable Player
at the tournament.
Because the MPSF conference is
too small to receive an automatic bid to
the NCAA Division 1 Tournament,
Denver, which was ranked No. 17 in the
country before this past weekend, is
waiting to see whether it will be invited.
It is unclear how the results of the
MPSF* Tournament will affect both the
Pioneers' and the Cardinal's chances of
receiving an invitation. The champi
onship bracket will be announced via a
selection show webcast today at 5 p.m.
If either team is selected, the first round
will take place next Saturday at a loca
tion that has yet to be announced.
