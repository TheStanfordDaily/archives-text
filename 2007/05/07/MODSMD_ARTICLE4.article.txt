## Jewish sorority approved for fall 15 women in first pledge class of unhoused AEPhi 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alpha Epsilon Phi (AEPhi), a tradi
tionally Jewish national sorority, recently
won committee approval from the Office
of Student Affairs to become the Univer
sity's sixth Inter-Sorority Council (ISC)
organization when it arrives on campus
next fall.
"We arc so excited to bring this to
Stanford, since we have been working on

getting approved for months." said Molly
Weiss '09, who plans to be an AEPhi offi
cer next year. "We really hope to have a
strong presence and become as well
known as the other five ISC" sororities."
AEPhi joins five other sanctioned
sororities at the University, of which
Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and
Delta Delta Delta are housed and Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Chi Omega are un
housed.
The traditionally Jewish sorority was
founded at Barnard College in 1909 by
Jewish students who felt excluded from
the Greek system because of their
religious affiliations. They estab
lished AEPhi as an organization
that did not discriminate on the
basis of race, religion or social
standing. Today, there are dozens
ot AEPhi chapters nationwide.
Stanlord's AEPhi organizers
expressed similar sentiments and
said they had similar reasons for
creating a chapter at the University.
"We felt that there was not a
place for Jewish women in the cur
rent Greek system on campus,"
Weiss said. "While there are cer
tainly Jewish women in the other
sororities, | AEPhi] will provide a
real home."
The approval process was not
easy, according to Weiss.
"It took the first two quarters to
find members who were really in
terested and committed," she said.
"Since then, we've had to work on
our proposal, present it to the com
mittee and write a constitution."
While the new sorority may
seem nearly identical in ideology
to AEPi. the campus' Jewish frater
nity. Weiss was clear that the
women of AEPhi "do not want to
be seen as simply the fraternity's
female counterparts."
Unlike the fraternity, AEPhi
will not be exclusively Jewish and
has several prospective members
who are not Jewish. The sorority's
organizers do, however, plan to
hold some events with AEPi, in ad
dition to other fraternities on cam
pus.
There are currently fifteen sis
ters in the chapter, and the sorority
expects a pledge class of at least
that many next year when it is eligi
ble to participate in the formal rush
process.
"Since AEPhi is a bit more spe
cial-interest, it is often smaller than
the other sororities," Weiss said.
"So. in addition to formal rush, we
will hold informal recruitment
throughout the entire year."
Students should expect AEPhi
to increase its visibility in the com
ing months. Weiss said interested
girls could stay in contact with a
member who would bring them in.
"You will see several events
sponsored by us," she said. "Some
will be Judaism related, and others
will not be. We really want to be
open to everyone who is interested."
