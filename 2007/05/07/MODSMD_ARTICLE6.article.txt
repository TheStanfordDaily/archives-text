# Disputes cloud sweat-free negotiations
## Sweat Free coalition touts rigorous factory oversight; University official offers more corporate-friendly alternative 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Representatives from the Stanford
Sweat Free Coalition met with the admin
istration for the sixth time in eight weeks
last Wednesday in a negotiation process
that appears to have no end in sight.
While student activists remain firmly
committed in their campaign to convince
the University's leaders to join the Work
ers' Rights Consortium (WRC), organiz

ers say that President John I lennessy has
not expressed support for the more en
forcement-oriented Designated Suppliers
Program (DSP), another initiative they
have been lobbying for.
Sweat Free Coalition co-coordinator
Dan Shih'o9said that I lennessy expressed
concern about the consequences of joining
the DSP at the Wednesday meeting be
cause of its stringent enforcement policies,
which he said the president worried would
be too difficult to implement.

In joining the DSP. the University
would force licensees that produce Stan
ford apparel to designate those factories as
DSP compliant. Because many licensees
produce the I Jniversity's apparel in a num
ber of different factories, however, they
would have to designate all of these facto
ries as abiding by DSP's stringent man
dates. As a result, suppliers focused on
keeping costs down could drop contracts
with the University in order to avoid the
scrutiny that comes with third-party moni

toring.
"Because of the DSP's emphasis on
consolidation," Shih said, "Hennessy was
concerned it would remove monitoring
from those factories where it was previous
ly occurring"
According to .Shih. I lennessy expressed
concern that the costs of making such
changes would be so great that licensees
would stop manufacturing Universi
ty apparel. As a result. Hennessy
said, independent monitoring of the
conditions in these factories would
also cease.
For its part, Shih said the Sweat-
Free Coalition remains firm in their
support of the DSP because of future
benefits for the hundreds of workers
in the DSP-compliant factories.
Another disputed issue at the ne
gotiation table has been the effec
tiveness of the WRC as a monitoring
group.
Stanford's Director of Business
Development Susan Weinstein has
said during the meetings that the Fair
Labor Association (FLA) is a more
valuable alternative to the WRC.
In an interview with The Daily,
Weinstein said the FLA does a better
job of including corporations in its
decisions, and thus would better en
sure factory compliance with its code
of working conditions.
"The FLA includes all parties
who must share in the solution to be
part of the discussion to develop a
plan," Weinstein said. "The WRC's
approach does not include licensees
and factory owners.These stakehold
ers are key to this process, since they
must ultimately adopt and monitor
compliance with any requirements. If
a recommended solution is unwork
able for them, it will fail to achieve its
goals."
Weinstein also said the WRC
monitors only apparel factories and
would therefore neglect 30 percent
of Stanford's licensed merchandise.
Shih argued the FLA's cozy rela
tionship with the companies it inves
tigates compromises its ability to im
partially investigate working condi
tions in their factories.
"We think that the FLA funda
mentally caters to businesses over
the rights of workers," Shih said. "We
think the FLA is a cover for compa
nies that want to appear sweat-free."

The WRC-FLA debate is one that
has raged across many college cam
puses after the WRC was created in
1999 by various university adminis
trations, students and labor rights ex
perts. To date, 194 colleges and uni
versities have joined the FLA, while
169 have joined the WRC.
The dispute came to a head at the
University of Oregon in 2(X)(). when
students objected to the University's
affiliation with the FLA and called
on administrators to join the WRC.
After a university-wide vote showed
overwhelming support for the WRC,
the Eugene, Ore. university Presi
dent David Frohnmayer announced
a switch to the WRC.
In response. University of Oregon
alumnus Phil Knight,co-founder and
former CEO of Nike, publicly an
nounced that he would never again
contribute to his alma mater; until
that point. Knight had contributed
$50 million to the university.
In a written statement. Knight ex
pressed his strong support for the
FLA and defended its enforcement
mechanisms.
"To accept the University of Ore
gon's endorsement of the WRC
would be to place my company, our
employees, our university-related
manufacturers and their employees
in unknown hands under undefined
monitoring that has no protocols, no
credibility, no role for the companies
whose businesses are being moni
tored, and no independence." he
said. "The bonds of trust, which al
lowed me to give at a high level, have
been shredded."
In August 2006, Knight con
tributed $105 million to the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, where
he received his MBA in 1962. It was
the largest gift ever made to a busi
ness school.
