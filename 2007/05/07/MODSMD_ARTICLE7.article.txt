first-ever "Greenfest" in White Plaza on Friday.
Sandwiched between an organic produce stand
and a dunk tank, several student groups and Uni

Hie event, sponsored by Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, was designed to peak student
interest in relevant projects.
"It's mainly to raise awareness and educate
people about sustainability on campus," said co
coordinator KevinTownsend 4 10. "Campus organ

Several groups and organizations offered free
gifts to students at the event. Procurement hand

grocery bags. Parking and Transportation Services
(PI'S) provided bike maps, transit schedules and
miniature Marguerites.
Angus Davol. coordinator of Transportation

"We call and email every new University staff
member personally and offer to plan their com
mutes." he said. "We'll do anything to get people
out of their cars."
Although P I S does not contact individual stu-
