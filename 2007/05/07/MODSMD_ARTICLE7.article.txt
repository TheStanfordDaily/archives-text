# STUDENT GROUPS
## First Greenfest held on Farm Giveaways, fliers and activities at Friday sustainability event 
### LYNDA BROWNING 
As calls for greater sustainubility intensify
around campus, students hosted the University's
first-ever "Greenfest" in White Plaza on Friday.
Sandwiched between an organic produce stand
and a dunk tank, several student groups and Uni
versity organizations promoted environmental
ism with posters, flier and free gifts.
Hie event, sponsored by Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, was designed to peak student
interest in relevant projects.
"It's mainly to raise awareness and educate
people about sustainability on campus," said co
coordinator KevinTownsend 4 10. "Campus organ
izations are doing a lot of great things. The prob
lem is that students don't know about it."
Several groups and organizations offered free
gifts to students at the event. Procurement hand
ed out free samples of biodegradable service
ware. Energy Crossroads gave away cloth-made
grocery bags. Parking and Transportation Services
(PI'S) provided bike maps, transit schedules and
miniature Marguerites.
Angus Davol. coordinator of Transportation
Demand Management at P I S, said his organiza
tion is deeply committed to individual outreach.
"We call and email every new University staff
member personally and offer to plan their com
mutes." he said. "We'll do anything to get people
out of their cars."
Although P I S does not contact individual stu-

dents, Davol said the department is
happy to provide off-campus stu
dents with written commute plans
upon request.
Lauren Finzer '09, a member of
the sponsor's Climate Crew, said she
still has 240 compact fluorescent
light bulbs she wants to give to stu
dents willing to replace the incan
descent bulbs in their desk lamps.
"[The bulbs] are important be
cause we need to put in place those
things that are efficient, cost-effec
tive and save the planet," she said.
"And we especially want to address
personal behavior."
The recent spate of environmen
tally-friendly efforts on campus —
including Stanford Dining's new
composting program at Tresidder
and weekly local produce stand; the
construction of the Jerry Yang and
Akiko Yamazaki Energy and Envi
ronment Building; the use of
biodiesel fuel in Marguerites; and
the Green Dorm project — are all
indicative of a greener Farm.
Julie Muir, operations coordina
tor for the University's garbage dis
posal at Peninsula Sanitary Services,
said environmental awareness is
spreading on campus because of re
cent student efforts.

"A lot of students are really excit
ed about composting," she said.
"This is the first time it's really
reached the public, although it's
been in effect behind-the-scenes
since 2003."
Stanford Dining has been com
posting kitchen-waste through
Peninsula Sanitary Services since
2003, for example, but only recently
made the jump to compostable serv
ice ware. .
While Greenfest was centered on
Stanford's own sustainability ef
forts, a few outside organizations
also attended the event. The Com
munity Agroecology Network came
from UC-Santa Cruz to promote
sustainable coffee and Ken Torke, a
representative from the City of Palo
Alto Wastewater Treatment Plant,
came to educate students about
mercury and pharmaceutical con
tamination of wastewater.
If mercury ends up in the waste
stream at the treatment plant,Torke
said, the incineration process will re
lease toxins into the atmosphere.
Torke also discussed the effects
of dumping pharmaceutical drugs
into sewer water.
"Estrogen and caffeine end up in
the bay." he said. "You end up with
fish with gender issues — so don't
dump your excess medicines down
the sink."
