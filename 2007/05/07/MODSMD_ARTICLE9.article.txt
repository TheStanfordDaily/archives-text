## Campus Arts The 						liveliest of arts 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION LIVELY ARTIST 
Stanford Lively Arts recently announced
its 2(X)7-2(K)8 season, and several prominent
performances highlight a higher "star
power" quotient for next year, ITiis is the
first full season led by new director Jenny
Bilfield, who was previously president of
Boosey and Hawkes, a music publisher. She
has promised to make Lively Arts pro
grams. which has always had problems at
tracting a critical mass of student perform
ance-goers. more accessible to the student
body. To that end. she formed the "Lively
Arts Street Team," created a new staff posi
tion specifically for student engagement
and promised more student-friendly per
formances and ticket prices (some events
can cost more than $50, even for students).
Because Lively Arts serves both the Stan
ford audience as well as the larger Bay Area
community, balancing the interests of di

verse audiences can be difficult.
A schedule of the 2007-2008 Lively Arts
season is now available online at http://livel
yarts.stanford.edu, although only the titles
of events are available. As a result, it is hard
to figure out the details of the events, apart
from the performers. Even with minimal de
tails, the upcoming season looks to be an im
pressive one. The most exciting event is the
season-opening performance (October 9),
w hen Philip Glass comes to town for a per
formance based on *' Book of Longing," a re
cent book of poetry by Leonard Cohen.
Glass will be on keyboard, Cohen will be on
video. Glass is recognized as perhaps the
foremost of the "modern" or "contempo
rary" composers. He is probably best known
in popular culture for the movie sound
tracks he scores for films like "The Fog of
War." "Notes on a Scandal" and"The
I lours," but is also often associated with
Stravinsky. He is arguably the most well
known living composer w ho does not corn-

pose "Star Wars"
music. It's un
clear what ex
actly the per
formance will
be (spoken
word? orches
tral?), but the

joint performance is
guaranteed to be interesting.
L.A. Theatre Works ar
rives later in the month, perform
ing their much-discussed "The
Pentagon Papers."This dramati
zation of a gripping period at the
end of the Nixon reign promises to
be compelling, especially because
Theatre Works is known for "radio
theatre." November brings Alarm

Will Sound, an innovative classical
music group known for premiering
irks by modern composers like Steve
:ich. They will be performing "Son of
hamber Symphony," a new work by John
idams, commissioned for Lively Arts.
In bringing Philip Glass, Alarm Will
Sound and several performances from
the kronos Quartet to Stanford, it
seems as if Lively Arts is emphasizing
modern classical music, an interesting
direction for Lively Arts to take. The
question of accessibility for the stu
dent population remains in question,
however.
January is clearly the centerpiece
month for the 2007-200N season.The
Kronos Quarter will be performing
"Sun Rings" with the Stanford
Chamber Chorale, in what has been

described as a
"multimedia per
formance." Renaissance

man Spike Lee will be speak
ing in Memorial Auditorium. Pianist
Christopher O'Riley. known to many
trendy indie kids for his piano-only covers
of Radiohead songs, will be performing —
although hopefully his performance will
not include interminable renditions of
"Everything In Its Right Place" and "Fake
Plastic Trees." And to top it all off, renowned
jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, will be per
forming with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Or
chestra at the end of the month.
After a heady January, the program de
creases both in moxie and pace, although
several notable performances remain. For
aficionados of string quartets, no less than
four (Emerson, St. Lawrence, Turtle Island
and Julliard) are performing from February
through April. In addition,accomplished pi
anist AlexToradze will be playing with the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra on Mar. 9,
and the day before will be performing solo.
Both performances are under a program
called "The Stravinsky Project." The versa
tile Elisa Monte Dance Company performs
on Apr. 14 and finally, the season caps off
with the Jin Xing Dance Company's collab
orative performance with the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and the Stanford
Symphonic Chorus.
All in all. the season is definitely a step
up from 2006-2007'5. Philip Glass. Spike

Lee. and Wynton Marsalis' appearances at
Stanford are much-awaited.The several in
novatively collaborative programs should
be unique and memorable performances,
especially the ones involving Stanford arts
groups. But Lively Arts still relies, it seems,
on string quartets and chamber music to fill
up the program, and while the prominence
of those groups is not objectionable, the
question remains of how much they interest
students.That being said, it should be an ex
citing year and student attendance should
be higher than ever, especially if ticket
prices are lowered. A larger Lively Arts
presence on campus is certainly welcome,
and with such a diverse list of performanc
es, it seems that Bilfield's ambition is on its
way to being realized.
