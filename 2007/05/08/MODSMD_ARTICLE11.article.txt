May 8,1945: V-E Day
"With momentous words literally
bouncing off the walls of the Daily
Shack every minute, and in a general ex
citement of phrases as 'unconditional
surrender,' 'total capitulation,' and fi
nally the war in Europe is over,' it
seems an appropriate time to bring in
some national news to calm you down.
"Although the war in Europe is defi
nitely in its final phases, the war in which
the United States is fighting, which by
the way, concerns every one of us. isn't
over by a long way. As a matter of fact
we are still in the middle of a long, hard
struggle that will require the utmost ef
fort on the part of everyone if we are
going to emerge really victorious in this
total war.
"Don't Forget Japan: Have you for
gotten the war with Japan? I'm sure
there are some Americans who think
the war with the Japanese far more im
portant than the war with Germany. If
you have any doubts as to that state
ment. ask some Marine who is sitting in
a foxhole on Okinawa right this minute.
1 le might confirm my suspicions.
"The war to that Marine is not a glob
al war. it is probably a war that takes
place in an area of about ten yards â€”
that little space that means life or death
to him.
"Strategy for Living: The war to him
is not grand strategy of great nations
striving to out-maneuver each other in
military might or power politics; it is
strategy of trying to outwit some enemy,
so that he may live.
"The horrors of the concentration
camp, although terrible and requiring
the punishment of the people responsi
ble for the atrocities, are not nearly as
important to that Marine as seeing his
buddy shot right in front of him, or los
ing a leg or arm himself.
"Save ( elebration: Ail of these things
are happening in the world right at this
minute, and in the general air of excite
ment over the fact that the news of the
German surrender might come any
minute, we should keep our celebra
tions until a few million guys in the
South Pacific can help us do it."
