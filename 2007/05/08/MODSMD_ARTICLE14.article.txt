### SUE LINDSEY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BLACKSBIJRG.Va. â€” I ike the
people of New York. ()klahoma ('it\
and Littleton, Colo., the Virginia
Tech community faces a difficult de
cision on what it will do with the
scene of a tragedy.
The classrooms and hallways of
the school's Norris Hall were lit

tercel with the bodies of 25 students
and five professors on April 16. plus
the body of gunman Seung-Hui Cho.
Student Brian Skipper wonders
how anyone can ever be expected to
learn in Norris Hall again.
"I won't go back in that building,"
says the 21-year-old junior from
Yorktown. who lost five friends in
Morris, including his faculty adviser.
G.V. Longanathan. "I couldn't see
people returning in there and just
going hack to normal."
Two other students were slain in
a campus dormitory.
The university has made no plans
beyond cleaning and repairing the
flat-roofed, oblong stone structure,
which has remained under police
guard since the killing spree.

However, faculty, students and
alumni have already weighed in with
suggestions for Norris' future,one of
more than 100 buildings on Virginia
Tech's 2,600-acre campus. Built in
the early l%os, it houses the depart
ment of engineering science and me
chanics.
Ideas for the building's future
range from returning it to use as
classrooms to making it a memorial
or even knocking it down.
There are examples around the
nation of how others have dealt with
sites of overnight infamy.
Every evening, the University of
Texas at Austin illuminates the clock

tower where sniper Charles Whit
man climbed to the 28th floor and
killed 16 and wounded 31 on Ann. I.
1966.
Before the attack, the 307-foot
tower had been a symbol of the
school for three decades. Its obser
vation deck reopened a year after
Whitman's attack, but it was
closed again in 1974 after four
people jumped to their deaths.
Tours are now available by reser
vation only.
Most of the killings in the 1999
massacre at Columbine 1 ligh School
in Littleton,Colo.,occurred in the li
brary. Officials built an atrium on

the site and placed a new library that
includes a memorial to the 12 stu
dents and one teacher killed by two
student shooters.
At Virginia Tech. Norris Mall is
still surrounded by chain-link fenc
ing topped by yellow police tape,
distinguishing it from the other
buildings made from the same local
ly quarried rusty gray "I lokie" lime
stone. Several second-floor windows
are open, their glass shattered by
Cho's bullets and by students who
jumped to escape the gunfire.
The decision on Norris 1 fall's fate
is ultimately up to Virginia Tech
President Charles Steger.
