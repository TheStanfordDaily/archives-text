## Editorial Board Madrid program offers new opportunities 
### 
The opening of a Stanford program in
Madrid is a superb addition to the
IJniversity's already-impressive
array of stud\ abroad options. Last week's
announcement by the Bing Overseas Stud
ies Program (BOSP) that the Madrid pro
gram will be open for winter quarter of
2008 makes official what many students
and facult\ have long known to be in the
works.
Spain is typically a top destination for
American students studying abroad, and
the absence until now of a Stanford pro
gram in the country was not for lack of inter
est. Spanish is the most popular foreign lan
guage taught to undergraduates at the Uni
versitv and many Stanford students have
chosen to study in Madrid. Barcelona or
Salamanca with programs run by other
schools. Man\ students who were consider
ing studying in Spain with a non-Stanford
program can now look forward to a sched

ule that fits better with Stanford's rather ec
centric academic calendar and credits that
transfer more readily.
Hie new center is also favorably situated
to deal with the complaint that some Stan
lord programs provide overly insular expe
riences. From its location within Madrid's
International Institute, Stanford's Spanish
outpost will facilitate interaction between
students from a variety of other schools
both American and European.
With the opening of the new program
comes a unique opportunity to revitalize
some other lagging aspects of the BOSH
Specifically, we would like to see class offer
ings that appeal to students in majors out
side of the humanities and social sciences,
which constitute the academic focus of most
of BOSP's Hurope campuses.
We eagerly await the opening of this wel
come addition to the University's overseas
network.
