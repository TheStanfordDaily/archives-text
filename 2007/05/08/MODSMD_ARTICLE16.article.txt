r 1 This school is a business" is what
we seniors say to each other all
JL the time, ruefully. It means our
administrators don't have to try to care
about us. It means all they have to worry
about is liability and the .01 percent
chance that something will happen to be
smirch our school's reputation and lower
our endowment below Moldova's GDP.
You are not allowed to have inflatable
kiddie pools on campus. Maybe just possi
bly. like lightning striking the same place
fifty billion times in a row. somebody
might drown in that kiddie pool. Baby
proof it. baby. There are no paper cuts at
Stanford.
But why does this school have to be such
an awful business? As much as the Board of
Trustees would like to forget, there are ac
tual people who actually live here. Some
$90 million was spent on building a new
football stadium last year. Nobody came.
That's the joke. They can't make good busi
ness decisions. They're not even good liars.
They're just spin doctors. Search through
The Daily Web site for administrative re
sponse letters and you will discover a mas
sive coordinated conspiracy to dry hump all
meaning from the fZnglish language. Words
and phrases are tortured into submission,
until one can almost hear the voice of Big
Brother droning in that implant in your
brain.
Diane Peck's recent letter, regarding
SLAC"s hunger strike, is a masterpiece. She
obfuscates: "Hundreds of employees... have
been beneficiaries of the University's living
wage policy.""Hundreds" is the best statistic
an employee of the greatest learning center
in the country could come up with. In real
person terms, that is roughly 200 to 999. She
dodges: "Even the lowest-paid of Stanford's
regular employees receive salaries and ben
efits significantly higher than living wage
polices that are in effect in various cities and
counties in the Bay Area." Which cities? An
tioch? Emeryville? And then sometimes she
just lies: "Fasting is not necessary for dia
logue to continue." Please. SLAC. don't
starve to death in front of our admits. The
smell of your rotting corpse might turn them
off.
"Intense feelings and strong opinions,"
Peck concludes, "cannot be the sole basis
for making decisions that affect the health
and well-being of the entire University."
What a sad thing to say If you are so devot
ed to a cause as to deny yourself suste
nance. with no thought of reward, then you
are too blinded by feelings and opinions
unlike Ms. Peck, a good citizen who holds
no opinions and feels only the lack of feel
ing.
Way back in November, this paper
published an article about the dissatis
faction voiced by the class of 2007 ("Se
nior discontent on the rise." Nov. 30.
2006). Jeff Wachtel. the senior assistant
to President Hennessy. said, "There are
lots of great and fun things that are hap
pening now that were not happening
many years ago and in many ways this is
a less restrictive environment." Interest
ed. I emailed Jeff and asked for an exam
ple. Just one example. He didn't respond.
I emailed him again. And again. Not be
cause I knew I was right but because I
wanted to be wrong. I want someone in
the administration to tell me how this

school is better now than it was 10 years
ago. and 1 want them to do it without re
ferring to admission statistics or our
bloated endowment. (Half a year later,
the lacebook group. "When 1 was your

It's fun to see what happens when some
one on the administrative side of the fence
messes up. Or rather, it's fun to see what
doesn't happen: any admission of guilt.

$90 million was spent on building a new
football stadium last year. Nobody came.
That's the joke. They can't make good busi
ness decisions. They're not even good liars.
They're just spin doctors. Search through
The Daily Web site for administrative re
sponse letters and you will discover a mas
sive coordinated conspiracy to dry hump all
meaning from the fZnglish language. Words
and phrases are tortured into submission,
until one can almost hear the voice of Big
Brother droning in that implant in your
brain.
Diane Peck's recent letter, regarding
SLAC"s hunger strike, is a masterpiece. She
obfuscates: "Hundreds of employees... have
been beneficiaries of the University's living
wage policy.""Hundreds" is the best statistic
an employee of the greatest learning center
in the country could come up with. In real
person terms, that is roughly 200 to 999. She
dodges: "Even the lowest-paid of Stanford's
regular employees receive salaries and ben
efits significantly higher than living wage
polices that are in effect in various cities and
counties in the Bay Area." Which cities? An
tioch? Emeryville? And then sometimes she
just lies: "Fasting is not necessary for dia
logue to continue." Please. SLAC. don't
starve to death in front of our admits. The
smell of your rotting corpse might turn them
off.
"Intense feelings and strong opinions,"
Peck concludes, "cannot be the sole basis
for making decisions that affect the health
and well-being of the entire University."
What a sad thing to say If you are so devot
ed to a cause as to deny yourself suste
nance. with no thought of reward, then you
are too blinded by feelings and opinions
unlike Ms. Peck, a good citizen who holds
no opinions and feels only the lack of feel
ing.
Way back in November, this paper
published an article about the dissatis
faction voiced by the class of 2007 ("Se
nior discontent on the rise." Nov. 30.
2006). Jeff Wachtel. the senior assistant
to President Hennessy. said, "There are
lots of great and fun things that are hap
pening now that were not happening
many years ago and in many ways this is
a less restrictive environment." Interest
ed. I emailed Jeff and asked for an exam
ple. Just one example. He didn't respond.
I emailed him again. And again. Not be
cause I knew I was right but because I
wanted to be wrong. I want someone in
the administration to tell me how this

school is better now than it was 10 years
ago. and 1 want them to do it without re
ferring to admission statistics or our
bloated endowment. (Half a year later,
the lacebook group. "When 1 was your
age. Stanford was fun." has swelled with
new members.)
It's fun to see what happens when some
one on the administrative side of the fence
messes up. Or rather, it's fun to see what
doesn't happen: any admission of guilt.
ResEd uppity-up Augie Galvan was ac
cused of taking kickbacks from
Michaelsen's. a Nevada company, for using
his position to press dorms into using
Michaelsen's for booking their ski trips
("Snow trip perks raise questions," May 3.
2006). The man insisted that he had not
abused his authority — difficult to believe
after he slipped out one night late in the
summer. Then-ResEd Director Jane Ca
marillo did not confirm or deny that the al
legations were true, which almost certainly
means that they were ("Row official re
signs." August 17,2006).
Our University let him scamper off, thus
setting a good example for all us future
white-collar criminals. Camarillo declined
to comment, saying. "It is not appropriate
to discuss any individual employee as it
would not be appropriate for me to discuss
any particular student due to confidentiali
ty."
Lady Jane — who banned dorms from
using house funds to purchase alcohol,
who banned drinking in frosh common
rooms, who banned secret snowflake from
dining halls, who banned until there was
nothing left to ban but ban itself — de
parted quickly and quietly weeks later.just
before winter quarter started. Apologists
claim that Camarillo was unfairly criti
cized. that she had to make the tough deci
sions. that ultimately she had to run this
school like a business. Business justifies
everything.
That is beyond idiotic. It's important that
we all learn that now. because we will be
subjected to the stupefying powers of bu
reaucracy throughout our lives.and bureau
cracy encourages the sort of corporatized
stupidity that has infested our administra
tion Bureaucracy is not designed to make
sense: it's designed to imitate sense, using
the word vomit that passes for language
among lawyers and moneymen. Bureaucra
cy writes stupid letters, lets minor func
tionaries bend the truth until its back
breaks and protects corrupt paper-pushers
from public scrutiny.
Everyone knows that freshmen drink
every weekend on this campus, but bureau
crats cannot afford to believe in facts. Facts
are not good business.
