# Speed addiction
## 
### 
American driving habits are like our
hamburgers: gratuitous and disgust
ing. but also slightly delicious. In my
homeland of Connecticut, for example, peo
ple literally drive to the ends of their drive
ways to pick up the morning paper, and they
practically jump at the chance to make a six
hour drive to Maine. Here in California, an
hour-long daily commute to work is normal,
and it's not unheard of to live about four feet
from a major freeway.
Ah. the wonders of laziness. Ah. the mar
vels of urban sprawl. Such things surely con
tribute to our nation's driving addiction, but
I believe that the origins of our fuel mania
can be traced to something else, something
dark and deep-seated. 1 have a great and epic
theory about our veritable compulsion to
drive, and it is this: we want to go fast.
Speed, in its many varieties, is universally
and effortlessly popular. For some reason, we
are more than willing to accept the attendant
dangers of going fast. Roller coasters, for ex
ample, would have no appeal if we didn't like
to be shunted around at lightning speeds in
tiny, roofless carts. We take perverse delight
in speed and danger, and perhaps this delight
stems from the wonderfully visceral feeling
of moving at a high velocity. 1 suppose that
rocketing along in a steel-covered vehicle re
assures us. on some sort of instinctual animal
level, that no cheetah is going to catch and eat
us. That's always comforting.
Ilie sensation of speed manages to be si
multaneously exciting and oddly soothing.
During my infancy, my parents used to re
move me from my crib when 1 was particular

ly restless. They would bundle me up. put me
in the car and drive around until 1 fell asleep.
There was something about the motion of the
car that lulled me into passivity, and there's
still something about sitting in the backseat
of a speeding car that induces a feeling of
calm. Perhaps its the relinquishing of control
that soothes us. the knowledge that while
we're passengers, we can temporarily stop
worrying about where we're going or how.
Being a passenger is like riding in the side
car of a motorcycle. Sure, the sidecar is fun,
but it's the place to which sidekicks, clowns
and children are relegated. On the whole, it's
best to be in the driving seat. And it's best to
be driving alone. In our highly urbanized
world, in which we're often shoved together
into tiny spaces,privacy is valuable. What bet
ter privacy than having a car of one's own?
The car is a tiny steel room in which you have
access to four comfy chairs, several cuphold
ers. a sound system and climate control. The
modern American housewife probably has
more control over her surroundings when
she's driving alone than when she's at home
with her husband and kids.
Driving alone is also a means to get the

hell out of wherever you are. If you're frus
trated, you can always zoom off down the
freeway and revel in the fact that you could
relocate to L.A. if things got unbearable.
Such freedoms are tempting indeed. Leaving
a dragging party certainly seems more ap
pealing if you know you have a speedy vehi
cle outside that can take you home at a mo
ment's notice. 1 laving to return from a party
by bike or by Marguerite, however, puts one
at the mercy of the unpredictable forces of
the universe. It is certainly better to have a
car, certainly better to be a speedy, au
tonomous being who can go where she pleas
es, when she pleases.
When considering these various appeals
of the automobile, it seems to me that driving
itself is an act of physical pleasure and an ex
ertion of personal autonomy. No wonder we
drive so much. Given this kinship we've fos
tered with the automobile, it seems that our
nasty driving habits will be hard to break,
which means that significantly cutting our
CO2 emissions will be harder than it sounds.
I know it sounds vaguely New-Age-ish. but 1
think we all need to get in touch with our
driving urges and begin to understand exact
ly why we drive. I know this is a job for a team
of psychologists, but it seems evident enough,
at least to me, that driving isn't just a matter
of expedience or necessity â€” it's a bodily
and psychological pleasure. And it is only
through understanding our beastly urges that
we can tame them.
