## Building lasting bridges of tolerance

-1 first witnessed the power of philanthropy to
effect positive change within the community
while interning at the Walter and Elise I laas
Fund's Jewish Life Program through a Stanford
Sand Hill Fellowship last summer. The Jewish
Life Program heavily focuses on outreach to the
broader Hay Area community. During my in
ternship. I primarily focused on two projects: de
veloping opportunities for Muslim-Jewish rela
tions and dialogue, and reviewing applicants for
the Post 9/11 Civic Engagement Fund, a collab
oration of eight Bay Area foundations seeking
to fight discrimination by supporting Muslim.
Arab and South Asian organizations. The
volatility of the times, and the extreme tension
caused by the Hezbollah-Israeli war added a
definite sense of urgency to my work.The effec
tiveness of dialogue became increasingly intan
gible, yet evermore significant and essential.
Ihere are many organizations across the
United States in which Muslims and Jews
come together, realizing that while individuals
may not see eye to eye on many issues, they
still hold in their hearts a dream for peace and

a deep respect for the "other's" humanity. I
know Stanford's Jewish and Muslim commu
nities can also come together in harmony —
to eat together, to talk together, and to share
and learn from each others' customs and ob
servances. Why'' Because we already have.
On Oct. 2,2006, at the conclusion of Yom
Kippur and during the month of Ramadan,
approximately 200 students joined together at
Tresidder to break their fast. As a chair of the
Jewish Student Association, I partnered with
Adnan Majid '07, of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University, and Jon Canel TO. of II il
lel. to co-plan and organize a " Ramadan/Yom
Kippur Joint Break Fast." While speaking to
all who had attended. I marveled with delight
at our success. Before me was a sea of Jews,
Muslims and friends from all backgrounds,
eating and talking together.
Later in October. Arab and Jewish stu
dents came together again at the "One Voice"
event I spearheaded with sponsorships by the
Jewish Student Association. Stanford Israel
Alliance and Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East. Despite significant political differ
ences among sponsoring organizations, stu

dents still engaged with each other.The group
Seeking Harmony in Israel and Palestine,
which lala Al Ramahi 07 mentioned in her
editorial ("Yes, dialogue is good." May 4).
grew out of that evening.
We can heal our campus community from
the trials of this year by making a lasting com
mitment to effectively and respectfully work
together, as we already have. Dialogue is
strongest when it leads to purposeful action,
and in some way touches more people than
just the participants. Our Break Fast has in
spired students at other schools. While a single
event like this on our campus is wonderful, it
is simply not enough. One of the greatest dif
ficulties surrounding Muslim-Jewish relations
and dialogue is sustainability. Let us face the
challenge and create a respectful campus en
vironment where we come together with
strength, passion and drive to build lasting
bridges of understanding and tolerance.
