## Laporta touts Barca activism Futbol Club Barcelona president proud of team's humanitarianism 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Joan Laporta may be the president of one of
the world's most decorated and successful soccer
teams, hut he can speak about the club for hours
without focusing solely on its many trophies.
Laporta, the president of Futbol Club
Barcelona, talked to an overflowing crowd at Ar
rillaga Family Sports Center for two-and-a-half
hours last night about his organization's role in
global sports and society.
FC Barcelona, or "Barca" as it is affectionately
known by its fans, won both the Spanish premier
league title and the European Champions Cup in
2006, cementing its status as one of the top teams
in the world. Hie club has attracted a huge global
following among soccer fans and has over 155
thousand dues-paying members across the world.
But there is far more than soccer to this club, as
evidenced by Barcelona's telling motto, "mes que
un club" ("more than a club" in Catalan). That sim
ple phrase is both a

symbol of pride and a
call to action for La
porta and his adminis
tration.
"To be 'more than
a club' is a virtue, but
at the same time it is a
great responsibility,"
Laporta said.

To be'more than a
club' is a virtue,
but at the same
time it is a great
responsibility
JOAN LAPORTA,

Barcelona's role and goals as a social institution. It
has served as a flagship for Catalan nationalism
since the 1930s and is now try ing to extend that in
fluence globally. Barca under Laporta has under
taken historic initiatives that are unprecedented
for a professional soccer team, including an agree
ment to wear the logo of the United Nations Chil
dren's Fund (UNICEF) on the front of the team's
jerseys.
Barcelona solidified its identity as "more than a
club" in the l%()s. when the team championed
Catalan freedom and identity during a period of
intense oppression by the centralist regime of
Francisco Franco. Because of its affiliation with
Catalan nationalism, the police and sympathetic
referees did their best to punish the team during
matches, but that only strengthened the link be
tween Barcelona and democratic social values.
"On the field, the club was not doing so well,"
Laporta said. "But off the pitch, we became
stronger."
That strength continued to build over the years
until the logical leap from concentration on Cata
lan affairs to involvement in global causes.The in
stitutions of soccer are in a unique position to af
fect the world, as Laporta noted by pointing out
that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, has
207 member nations,compared to 192 in the Unit
ed Nations.
"Football makes an incredible amount of
money these days, and it is only right that part of
the money goes to less fortunate people," 1 .aporta
said.
In the first few years of Laporta's administration,
Barcelona organized and hosted fundraising matches to
benefit the victims of the 2«KM South Asian tsunami and
was very actively involved in international anti-racism
campaigns. Last summer. Barcelona formed what La por
ta described as an unprecedented and "pioneering global
alliance with UNICEF" to financially support, and
prominently advertise, the cause of the children's advoca
cy foundation.
Whereas most European soccer teams get huge sums
of money for wearing a sponsor's logo across the front of
their shirts, FC Barcelona players wear the UNICEF
symbol across their chests, much to Laporta's pride. The
club also donates 1.5 million euros per year to the foun
dation.
IJNICEF's emblem is the only logo to grace the
team's shirt-front in all of Barcelona's 108-year existence.
That sacrifice of tradition for a higher cause is a hugely
important step to Laporta.
"We are positioning the social identity of the club." La
porta said."We are ourselves as 'more than a club' in the
world, [not just in Catalonia]."
As part of the team's partnership with UNICEF,
Barcelona is sponsoring the development of education
and sports centers in a host of African and Latin Ameri
can nations, including Senegal, Cameroon, Brazil and
Mexico. Laporta also announced the impending opening
of a center in Swaziland for HIV-positive children.
"|FC Barcelona has an obligation] according to our
culture, according to our history and according to out
place in the world." he said.
There have been small bumps in the road as Laporta
has tried to widen the club's goals. Laporta said that he
and his fellow directors thought long and hard about
Barcelona's relationship with Nike when they negotiated
their deal with IJNICEF.The sportswear giant has been
\\ idely criticized tor its labor practices.especially those re
garding children. But Laporta noted that Barcelona's
sponsor is not on IJNICEF's list of "trouble companies"
and that Nike is required, under the terms ol its contract
with the club, to donate 50 million euros to the humani
tarian F( Barcelona Foundation over the next six years.
I 'ltimatcly.it there was one thing that attendees could
take away from Laporta's talk.it was the infectious en
thusiasm with which the Barcelona president discussed
his club's humanitarian work. He takes obvious pleasure
in the good causes that Barcelona is promoting.
As passionate as Laporta is about the efforts that
Barcelona is making to spread its democratic and social
values throughout the world, he is just as excited by the
trail the club is blazing for others in the world of profes
sional soccer to follow.
"The most important (part] is the message that FC
Barcelona is launching to the world." Laporta said. "We
have to make people aware that football can bring joy
and hope.
"We are saying to less fortunate people that they are
not alone."

To be'more than a
club' is a virtue,
but at the same
time it is a great
responsibility
JOAN LAPORTA,

Barcelona's role and goals as a social institution. It
has served as a flagship for Catalan nationalism
since the 1930s and is now try ing to extend that in
fluence globally. Barca under Laporta has under
taken historic initiatives that are unprecedented
for a professional soccer team, including an agree
ment to wear the logo of the United Nations Chil
dren's Fund (UNICEF) on the front of the team's
jerseys.
Barcelona solidified its identity as "more than a
club" in the l%()s. when the team championed
Catalan freedom and identity during a period of
intense oppression by the centralist regime of
Francisco Franco. Because of its affiliation with
Catalan nationalism, the police and sympathetic
referees did their best to punish the team during
matches, but that only strengthened the link be
tween Barcelona and democratic social values.
"On the field, the club was not doing so well,"
Laporta said. "But off the pitch, we became
stronger."
That strength continued to build over the years
until the logical leap from concentration on Cata
lan affairs to involvement in global causes.The in
stitutions of soccer are in a unique position to af
fect the world, as Laporta noted by pointing out
that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, has
207 member nations,compared to 192 in the Unit
ed Nations.
"Football makes an incredible amount of
money these days, and it is only right that part of
the money goes to less fortunate people," 1 .aporta
said.
In the first few years of Laporta's administration,
Barcelona organized and hosted fundraising matches to
benefit the victims of the 2«KM South Asian tsunami and
was very actively involved in international anti-racism
campaigns. Last summer. Barcelona formed what La por
ta described as an unprecedented and "pioneering global
alliance with UNICEF" to financially support, and
prominently advertise, the cause of the children's advoca
cy foundation.
Whereas most European soccer teams get huge sums
of money for wearing a sponsor's logo across the front of
their shirts, FC Barcelona players wear the UNICEF
symbol across their chests, much to Laporta's pride. The
club also donates 1.5 million euros per year to the foun
dation.
IJNICEF's emblem is the only logo to grace the
team's shirt-front in all of Barcelona's 108-year existence.
That sacrifice of tradition for a higher cause is a hugely
important step to Laporta.
"We are positioning the social identity of the club." La
porta said."We are ourselves as 'more than a club' in the
world, [not just in Catalonia]."
As part of the team's partnership with UNICEF,
Barcelona is sponsoring the development of education
and sports centers in a host of African and Latin Ameri
can nations, including Senegal, Cameroon, Brazil and
Mexico. Laporta also announced the impending opening
of a center in Swaziland for HIV-positive children.
"|FC Barcelona has an obligation] according to our
culture, according to our history and according to out
place in the world." he said.
There have been small bumps in the road as Laporta
has tried to widen the club's goals. Laporta said that he
and his fellow directors thought long and hard about
Barcelona's relationship with Nike when they negotiated
their deal with IJNICEF.The sportswear giant has been
\\ idely criticized tor its labor practices.especially those re
garding children. But Laporta noted that Barcelona's
sponsor is not on IJNICEF's list of "trouble companies"
and that Nike is required, under the terms ol its contract
with the club, to donate 50 million euros to the humani
tarian F( Barcelona Foundation over the next six years.
I 'ltimatcly.it there was one thing that attendees could
take away from Laporta's talk.it was the infectious en
thusiasm with which the Barcelona president discussed
his club's humanitarian work. He takes obvious pleasure
in the good causes that Barcelona is promoting.
As passionate as Laporta is about the efforts that
Barcelona is making to spread its democratic and social
values throughout the world, he is just as excited by the
trail the club is blazing for others in the world of profes
sional soccer to follow.
"The most important (part] is the message that FC
Barcelona is launching to the world." Laporta said. "We
have to make people aware that football can bring joy
and hope.
"We are saying to less fortunate people that they are
not alone."
