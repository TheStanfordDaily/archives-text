### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Joan Laporta may be the president of one of
the world's most decorated and successful soccer
teams, hut he can speak about the club for hours
without focusing solely on its many trophies.
Laporta, the president of Futbol Club
Barcelona, talked to an overflowing crowd at Ar
rillaga Family Sports Center for two-and-a-half
hours last night about his organization's role in
global sports and society.
FC Barcelona, or "Barca" as it is affectionately
known by its fans, won both the Spanish premier
league title and the European Champions Cup in
2006, cementing its status as one of the top teams
in the world. Hie club has attracted a huge global
following among soccer fans and has over 155
thousand dues-paying members across the world.
But there is far more than soccer to this club, as
evidenced by Barcelona's telling motto, "mes que
un club" ("more than a club" in Catalan). That sim
ple phrase is both a

symbol of pride and a
call to action for La
porta and his adminis
tration.
"To be 'more than
a club' is a virtue, but
at the same time it is a
great responsibility,"
Laporta said.

To be'more than a
club' is a virtue,
but at the same
time it is a great
responsibility
JOAN LAPORTA,

Barcelona's role and goals as a social institution. It
has served as a flagship for Catalan nationalism
since the 1930s and is now try ing to extend that in
fluence globally. Barca under Laporta has under
taken historic initiatives that are unprecedented
for a professional soccer team, including an agree
ment to wear the logo of the United Nations Chil
dren's Fund (UNICEF) on the front of the team's
jerseys.
Barcelona solidified its identity as "more than a
club" in the l%()s. when the team championed
Catalan freedom and identity during a period of
intense oppression by the centralist regime of
Francisco Franco. Because of its affiliation with
Catalan nationalism, the police and sympathetic
referees did their best to punish the team during
matches, but that only strengthened the link be
tween Barcelona and democratic social values.
"On the field, the club was not doing so well,"
Laporta said. "But off the pitch, we became
stronger."
That strength continued to build over the years
until the logical leap from concentration on Cata
lan affairs to involvement in global causes.The in
stitutions of soccer are in a unique position to af
fect the world, as Laporta noted by pointing out
that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, has
207 member nations,compared to 192 in the Unit
ed Nations.
"Football makes an incredible amount of
money these days, and it is only right that part of
the money goes to less fortunate people," 1 .aporta
said.
