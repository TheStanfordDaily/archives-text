## Cardinal mauled by Cougars Baseballl drops rubber match, still looking for first series victory in Pac-10 play 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a season where almost nothing has
gone right tor Stanford baseball. Monday's
rubber match of a three-game series at
Washington State was an especially crush
ing defeat.
Stanford (l ( )-2f>.4-14 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) dropped its seventh straight Pac-10
series and seventh consecutive series over
nil with a 4-2. come-from-ahead loss to the
( ougars (23-21.6-12). Hie game had all the
characteristics of a low-scoring pitchers
duel early on. with Stanford junior right
hander Erik Davis retiring 18 of the first 21
batters he faced. Davis allowed no runs
through the first six innings of play.
"I was throwing all m\ pitches for
strikes, getting ahead of hitters, and the de
fense was playing really well behind me,"
Davis said."And that's when you start play
ing good baseball â€” when you're feeling
good and everyone else is playing good."
*Hi e Cardinal offense, meanwhile, came
out swinging, with freshman light fielder
Toby Gerhart hitting a leadoff home run to
right to start the game; it was his second
blast of the year.
Stanford manufactured a second run in
the sixth, as sophomore center fielder Sean
Ratliff bunted for a single, advanced to sec
ond on a single by junior light fielder
Michael Taylor and scored on a pair of sac
rifices.
That would be all the offense head
coach Mark Marquess' squad was able to
muster, however, as Jayson Miller, Wash
ington State's starter, showed fantastic con
trol over 7.1 innings. Miller gave up just six
hits and walked none, while striking out
four, for the Cougars.

"We didn't do much." said Marquess of
his team's effort against Miller. "He did a
good job. I le mixed his pitches well and had
a really good change. We got a couple of
hits off him, but other than that he did a
good job. We had a couple of opportunities,
but he came with the big pitches when he
needed to."
Davis,meanwhile,ran into trouble in the
seventh inning. The junior got two outs
without difficulty, but then issued a walk,
three singles and hit a batter, resulting in
three runs for the Cougars. Although that
would prove to be enough for the win.
Washington State nevertheless tacked on
an extra insurance run in the eighth on a
single and double.
"They got the big hits when they needed
them," Marquess said to GoStanford.com.
"You have to give them credit. They got
those big hits they needed in that seventh
inning. It was big."
The loss knocked Davis' record back
even at 2-2 with a 5.18 ERA, after allowing
three earned runs over seven innings, with
four strikeouts and just the lone walk in the
seventh. It was that one crucial walk in the
top of the seventh that seemed to bother
Davis the most following the game.
"It's obviously frustrating," he said.
"You get the first two guys out, but it's kind
of like a cardinal rule of baseball: you've
got to get that third guy. You can't go out
there and give up a walk."
Finding itself suddenly behind, the Car
dinal would go on to leave five men on base
over the final two frames. With one out in
the eighth, the three and four hitters in the
Stanford lineup looked like they would
come through again, as Ratliff and Taylor
delivered a pair of one-out singles. After a
foul out, senior third baseman Ryan Sea-
