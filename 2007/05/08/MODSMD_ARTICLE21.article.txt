and ()regon State.
Histor\ is on Stanford's side in
its matchup against Davis — the
Cardinal is 4-0 all-time against the
Aggies larlier this season. Stan
ford defeated Davis 7-1 in the final
game of the Stanford Invitational
II That victory capped off a 3-1
weekend in which the hosting Car

Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
was credited with the victory after
allowing one run on four hits in
seven innings of work to continue
her dominance of the Aggies. Last
season, Penna also earned her first
career no-hitter against Davis in an
11-0 victory.
On the season. Penna has been
overwhelming in the circle. She is
currently building upon career
highs with a 23-9 record, a 2.13
LRA and 264 strikeouts. On the of
fensive end. freshman centerfielder
Alissa Haber is leading the Cardi
nal offense with a scorching .366 av

centage of .542 on the season.
On Sunday against the Bruins.
Penna allowed just one run on three
hits in seven innings, while Haber
notched a career-high four hits and
drove in two runs for the victory.
With the win.Stanford took the sea
son series against UCLA, two
games to one. Stanford's record
now stands at 32-16-1 overall (7-10-
1 in the Pacific-10 Conference),
while UCLA dropped to 34-15 (10-
8 Pac-10).
Despite its current status as a Di
\ision-I provisional program, Davis
is not an opponent to be taken light
ly. After a dismal 2006 campaign in
which they finished 15-39. the Ag
gies have already doubled their win
total this season.Their lineup is an
chored by the complete offensive
threat of sophomore Deanna
Menapace. who is batting .331 with

10 doubles. 10 MRs and 22 w;ilk«s on

Hancock, who owns a 15-12 record
with a 2.04 ERA and IX4 strikeouts.
Vying for their 33rd win til the
season, the members of the Cardi
