for the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships, three members of the Cardinal

score of anyone in the Pac-10. A shot
put foul, though, doomed Hustedt to
sixth out of 11. with 6849 points. Ari
zona's Jake Arnold finished on top with
7755 points.
On the first day of the multi-event
championships. I lustedt scored his best
in the jump events. A 7.43-meter long
jump won him the top spot with 918

points: he also went on to earn a sec
ond-place finish in the high jump (2.04
meters) for 840 points.
Fourth-place finishes in both the
100-meter (11.16 seconds for 825
points) and 400-meter (50.00 seconds
for 815 points) races complemented the
highs. hut a foul in the shot put proved
to be Hustedt's downfall. Lacking the
400-plus points each of his competitors
earned in the event. Hustedt was in
eighth after the first day and in need of
a comeback.
A first-place finish in the 110-meter
hurdles (14.4 seconds for 918 points)
was a worthy start on Sunday, and the
junior also went on to take second in
the pole vault (4.75 meters for 834
points). But seventh-place earnings in
the discus throw, and 1500 meters for a
ninth-place finish in the javelin throw,
weren't enough. Hustedt managed to
climb only two spots in the rankings.
Meanwhile, Cardinal freshman
Kara Bennett was able to finish 12th
(441(i points) in her first Pac-IO Cham
pionship heptathlon. Sophomore Lau

Event Championships this weekend. A foul in the shot put event left Hustedt in need of a major come
back heading into the final day of competition, and the junior was only able to make up two spots over
all. Meanwhile, freshman Kara Bennett claimed 12th in her first Pac-10 Championship heptathlon, her
strongest performance coming in the high |ump. In that event, she hit the 1.72-meter mark, which was
good for third-place. Sophomore Lauren Stewart also entered the heptathlon competition, but she with
drew from the field after the long jump on Sunday.

10 going into the event, withdrew after
Sunday's long jump.
Saturday's start proved difficult for
Bennett when she came in last for two
events (the 100-meter hurdles and 200-
meter dash), and she placed 13th out of
15 competitors in the shot put.The high
jump proved a breakthrough for Ben
nett. who scored third on a 1.72-meter
mark for points.
Stewart was in the middle of the
field for many of Saturday's events
(eighth in the 200 meters.seventh in the
100-meter hurdles and ninth in the shot
put), hut she failed to record a mark in
the high jump. Sunday's king jump was

more successful with a fifth-place finish
(5.77 meters for 780 points), hut Stew
art soon withdrew.
After her teammate's departure.
Bennett was able to pick up fourth in
the javelin (39.19 meters for 652

advance her more than two spots.
