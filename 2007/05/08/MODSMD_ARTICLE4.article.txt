### JORDAN CHAZIN 
Hie Tresidder Memorial Union ceiling is cov
ered with ornate dresses supported by large pink
crosses. Some are simple and dignified. Others
are less traditional. One is smeared with red
paint — it looks like blood at first glance — ask
ing the question, "What have you done to my
baby girl?"
The question resonates starkly as a focal
point in an exhibit intended to memorialize the
unsolved murders of women in the border city of
Juarez, Mexico. "ReDressing Justice." the visual
complement to next week's conference "Femini
cide = Sanctioned Murder: Gender. Race and Vi

olence in Global Context." opened yesterday
and will be on display through the end of June.
Presented by Chicano/a Studies and the Cen
ter for Comparative Studies in Race and I thnic
ity, the organizers aim to raise awareness about
"violence against women on an epidemic scale."
according to the conference's Web site. Ihe dra
matic display was featured at Sweden's Museum
of World Culture earlier in the year.
"When the exhibit was first created, there
were about 400 crosses and dresses, each one of
them individually made in honor of the 400 vic
tims from Ciudad Juarez," said Spanish Prof.
Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano. who or
ganized the event.
Ciudad Juarez is located in the
Mexican state of Chihuahua, just
over the American border from El
Paso, Texas. According to non-gov
ernmental organizations such as
Amnesty International, hundreds of
women in the border city — many
of them workers in foreign factories
— have gone missing in recent
years.
In many cases, their bodies are
found days after their loved ones re
port them missing. Often, there is
evidence of sexual assault. Many of
the cases remain unsolved.
Despite the gravity and serious
ness of next week's conference,
which will begin Wednesday and
last until Saturday, Yarbro-Bejara
no expressed hope that the week's
events would increase awareness
about both the atrocities across the
border and about gender violence
in general.
"We will have films.candle light
ings, panel discussions and guest
speakers, some of whom are family
members of the women who were
murdered," she said. "This confer
ence will help us bring about justice,
while examining gender violence
through a lens of ethnic and class
studies."
