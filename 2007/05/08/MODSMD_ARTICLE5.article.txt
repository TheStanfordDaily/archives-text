## Hopes for cyber wizard in future 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Imagine you want to plan a meeting.
You tell a program on your computer and it
looks up available rooms,checks attendees'
schedules, books the meeting and notifies
everyone, all without your help. Or maybe
you want to buy a car. So the same software
looks up necessary insurance require
ments, compares vehicle prices and starts
the paperwork with the DMV.

These situations are not quite as far-fetched
as it seems, due to the work occurring in the
computer science department's Logic
Group. Computer Science Prof. Michael
Genesereth and Charles Petrie. a senior re
search engineer, are part of a group work
ing to develop software that would locate
and integrate services on the Internet.
Like a cyberspace wizard, the software
would eliminate much of the planning in
volved in tasks such as buying a car
i)i booking a vacation. The new soft
ware would eliminate the need for
humans to look up and complete the
necessary steps and would automate
the process by finding the necessary
services and linking them together,
essentially creating a super-service.
Ibis is an idea that is still in the
prototype stage, the demonstration
stage," Genesereth said. "It isn't in
the release stage yet. You're not
going to see this revolutionize the
use of the Web in the next three to six
months, but maybe over the next

"This software could
affect anybody.
Consumers probably
have the most to
gain."

couple of years."
Genesereth explained that this
concept of service integration al
ready exists in some places on a small
scale, like Amazon.com, hut that the
new program would be more compli
cated.
"What is different about our proj
ect is that it is composing the services
from multiple sources." he said. "This
is being done over the Internet."
One of the main challenges is en
abling the software wizard to under
stand what the services do and mak
ing the preconditions and effects
clear.
"The key is describing the servic
es and their effects in a semantic
way." Genesereth said. "Semantic
annotation is crucial, a way to say to
the world what the service does in a
way the wizard can understand."
He added that the new software
has the potential to simplify a num
ber of different tasks, ranging from
planning meetings to coordinating
relief efforts after a natural disaster.
Genesereth also said the new
software would have far-reaching ef
fects that would have an impact on
both the consumer and business
worlds.
"This software could affect any
body." Genesereth said. "Consumers
probably have the most to gain from
this but will probably be targeted
later, after businesses."

Charles Petrie, a senior tesearch assistant in the Computer Science Logic Group, has plans to create a cyberspace wizard, through which computers will be
able to negotiate with one another without human assistance.
