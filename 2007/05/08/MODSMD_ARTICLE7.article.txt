# Close scrutiny on applicants
## Common App asks about misdemeanors 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Admissions officers at elite
schools like Stanford don't just look
at Cil'A. SAT and AP scores when
they pour over thousands of applica
tions every year. They also care
about character and wonder whethei
the person they are considering is a
good "match" for their school.
"We obviously look at academic
records and their records overall."
said Richard Shaw, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions. "But we are
also quite interested in their overall
progress in school and if there are
any blips in the progress."
When the facts don't check out or
performance doesn't remain up to
par. the University can revoke offers
of admission.
"We might be reviewing 10 to 15
[students out] of the total class where
we have concern." Shaw said. "Last
year we took pretty serious action on

four of them. But we do take seri
ous action and that's the message."

New questions about an
applicant's past
This year, the Common Ap
plication — which Stanford
will adopt next year — added
a question at the bottom of ■
the last page asking students '
it they have ever been convict
ed of a misdemeanor. While
the Common App did in- 4
elude a question about J
felonies in previous years, the ™

question about less serious crimes
was ;i new addition to the 2006-2007
document.
The application also inquires
whether applicants have been sus
pended, expelled or put on probation
at any secondary school. Stanford's
application has included the same
questions for some time, with an ad
ditional question about whether a
student has "had a criminal charge
sustained against you in a juvenile
proceeding." On the 2006 applica
tion. Stanford made its language
broader when it added a question
about whether a student has "violat
ed an 1 ionor Code."
It misconduct is reported (either
011 the application or after students
have been admitted), the University
reserves the right to deny or rescind
admission to otherwise qualified stu

dents.
The scrutiny of applicants' legal
backgrounds highlights the impor
tance of being well-rounded in the
admissions process. Shaw says that
Stanford's policies toward miscon
duct have always been striet. and the
University's policies will remain the
same through the transition from the
current Stanford-specific applica
tion to the Common App.
Shaw noted that each high school
treats "misconduct" differently, mak
ing it necessary to evaluate each stu
dent's case on an individual basis.Hie
reasons for disciplinary action can
vary from misuse of the Internet to
vandalism to simply skipping class.
"[The type of infraction] obvious
ly is something we might take into
account," said Shaw of applicants
who require special attention.
"Some students might be expelled
[for] things like plagiarism or aca
demic dishonesty — those are pretty
serious."
As a result of the variance in
cases of misconduct, the University
makes sure to hear the student's side
of the story as well.
"We always ask the student to get
back to us and give us some reason
why these things occur," he said.
Indeed, on the application, stu
dents w ho acknowledge being disci
plined in the past are told they must
"explain fully on a separate sheet."
Some applicants don't disclose
their backgrounds
Shaw acknowledged that students
and their families are not always
straightforward with the University
about these sensitive issues.The dean,
who came from Yale to the Farm in
2005, said that staff in his office usual
ly discover misconduct by searching
for media coverage about the student
or. occasionally, from other students
at the school who tip them off.
Even with the help of the media
and information from inside sources,
the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion doesn't catch every misde
meanor, suspension or felony.
One male undergraduate, for in
stance. said he was expelled from
high school for selling marijuana,
but the University never found out
about his checkered past. By the
time he began applying for college.

he said, the charges had been sealed
by a court, and because he was a
minor at the time of the incident, all
history of the case had been re
moved from his official record.
"The court realized I was a smart
kid with potential." he said. "I had to
meet with people. 1 did community
service. 1 stopped doing that stuff
and started thinking."
The student was granted
anonymity by The Daily because of
the offense's sensitive nature and his
continuing efforts to sta\ away from
drugs.
"I absolutely think 1 deserve to be
here." he added. "I'm completely
ambitious. I'm getting good grades. 1
honestly do regret [what 1 did]. I put
my mom through hell. I didn't need
that — 1 had everything. The reason
I did it was because 1 was unhappy. 1
was rebellious."
If he had been open with the Uni
versity. he said, "there's no way in
hell I would be here."
The University retains its right to
revoke offers of admission even
after students have been accepted.
"Some students get in trouble
[after acceptance] too — after being
admitted they are suspended or have
some kind ol disciplinary infrac
tion." Shaw said. "We can withdraw
their admission — that happens. We
can ask them to stay out a year —
which often happens."
Admissions reviews transcripts
Acceptance is also contingent
upon finishing high school in good
academic standing.
Drops in grade point average
may elicit a warning letter and. Shaw
said,"would be perhaps a suggestion
of senioritis."
A female member of the class of
2009 said she received a warning
email after her CPA dropped from a
4.56 to a number still above 4.0.
"1 had two jobs." said the student,
who was accepted early and granted
anonymity because of the stigma
that comes with low grades. "I wasn't
as motivated."
"It was really traumatizing." she
said. "If my admission actually got
rescinded it would have been really,
really hard to tell my parents."
"It's really just a good idea,"
Shaw said,"to maintain a strong aca
demic and extracurricular personal
record to the end of your school
year."

really hard to tell my parents."
"It's really just a good idea,"
Shaw said,"to maintain a strong aca
demic and extracurricular personal
record to the end of your school
year."

Admissions officers at elite
schools like Stanford don't just look
at Cil'A. SAT and AP scores when
they pour over thousands of applica
tions every year. They also care
about character and wonder whethei
the person they are considering is a
good "match" for their school.
"We obviously look at academic
records and their records overall."
said Richard Shaw, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions. "But we are
also quite interested in their overall
progress in school and if there are
any blips in the progress."
When the facts don't check out or
performance doesn't remain up to
par. the University can revoke offers
of admission.
"We might be reviewing 10 to 15
[students out] of the total class where
we have concern." Shaw said. "Last
year we took pretty serious action on

four of them. But we do take seri
ous action and that's the message."

New questions about an
applicant's past
This year, the Common Ap
plication — which Stanford
will adopt next year — added
a question at the bottom of ■
the last page asking students '
it they have ever been convict
ed of a misdemeanor. While
the Common App did in- 4
elude a question about J
felonies in previous years, the ™

question about less serious crimes
was ;i new addition to the 2006-2007
document.
The application also inquires
whether applicants have been sus
pended, expelled or put on probation
at any secondary school. Stanford's
application has included the same
questions for some time, with an ad
ditional question about whether a
student has "had a criminal charge
sustained against you in a juvenile
proceeding." On the 2006 applica
tion. Stanford made its language
broader when it added a question
about whether a student has "violat
ed an 1 ionor Code."
It misconduct is reported (either
011 the application or after students
have been admitted), the University
reserves the right to deny or rescind
admission to otherwise qualified stu

dents.
The scrutiny of applicants' legal
backgrounds highlights the impor
tance of being well-rounded in the
admissions process. Shaw says that
Stanford's policies toward miscon
duct have always been striet. and the
University's policies will remain the
same through the transition from the
current Stanford-specific applica
tion to the Common App.
Shaw noted that each high school
treats "misconduct" differently, mak
ing it necessary to evaluate each stu
dent's case on an individual basis.Hie
reasons for disciplinary action can
vary from misuse of the Internet to
vandalism to simply skipping class.
"[The type of infraction] obvious
ly is something we might take into
account," said Shaw of applicants
who require special attention.
"Some students might be expelled
[for] things like plagiarism or aca
demic dishonesty — those are pretty
serious."
As a result of the variance in
cases of misconduct, the University
makes sure to hear the student's side
of the story as well.
"We always ask the student to get
back to us and give us some reason
why these things occur," he said.
Indeed, on the application, stu
dents w ho acknowledge being disci
plined in the past are told they must
"explain fully on a separate sheet."
Some applicants don't disclose
their backgrounds
Shaw acknowledged that students
and their families are not always
straightforward with the University
about these sensitive issues.The dean,
who came from Yale to the Farm in
2005, said that staff in his office usual
ly discover misconduct by searching
for media coverage about the student
or. occasionally, from other students
at the school who tip them off.
Even with the help of the media
and information from inside sources,
the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion doesn't catch every misde
meanor, suspension or felony.
One male undergraduate, for in
stance. said he was expelled from
high school for selling marijuana,
but the University never found out
about his checkered past. By the
time he began applying for college.

he said, the charges had been sealed
by a court, and because he was a
minor at the time of the incident, all
history of the case had been re
moved from his official record.
"The court realized I was a smart
kid with potential." he said. "I had to
meet with people. 1 did community
service. 1 stopped doing that stuff
and started thinking."
The student was granted
anonymity by The Daily because of
the offense's sensitive nature and his
continuing efforts to sta\ away from
drugs.
"I absolutely think 1 deserve to be
here." he added. "I'm completely
ambitious. I'm getting good grades. 1
honestly do regret [what 1 did]. I put
my mom through hell. I didn't need
that — 1 had everything. The reason
I did it was because 1 was unhappy. 1
was rebellious."
If he had been open with the Uni
versity. he said, "there's no way in
hell I would be here."
The University retains its right to
revoke offers of admission even
after students have been accepted.
"Some students get in trouble
[after acceptance] too — after being
admitted they are suspended or have
some kind ol disciplinary infrac
tion." Shaw said. "We can withdraw
their admission — that happens. We
can ask them to stay out a year —
which often happens."
Admissions reviews transcripts
Acceptance is also contingent
upon finishing high school in good
academic standing.
Drops in grade point average
may elicit a warning letter and. Shaw
said,"would be perhaps a suggestion
of senioritis."
A female member of the class of
2009 said she received a warning
email after her CPA dropped from a
4.56 to a number still above 4.0.
"1 had two jobs." said the student,
who was accepted early and granted
anonymity because of the stigma
that comes with low grades. "I wasn't
as motivated."
"It was really traumatizing." she
said. "If my admission actually got
rescinded it would have been really,
really hard to tell my parents."
"It's really just a good idea,"
Shaw said,"to maintain a strong aca
demic and extracurricular personal
record to the end of your school
year."
