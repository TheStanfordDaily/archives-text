## Common App asks about misdemeanors 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Admissions officers at elite
schools like Stanford don't just look
at Cil'A. SAT and AP scores when
they pour over thousands of applica

at any secondary school. Stanford's
application has included the same
questions for some time, with an ad

student has "had a criminal charge

proceeding." On the 2006 applica

broader when it added a question
