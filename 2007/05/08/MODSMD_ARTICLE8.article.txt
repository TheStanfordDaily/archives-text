## Panel discusses ethics of genetic engineering Discussion of parents' control over children 
### CARLEE BROWN 
A panel on the ethics of genetic
engineering held yesterday after
noon turned into a heated discussion
about both medical technologies and
the problems of "hyper-parenting."
Hie event, co-sponsored by the
Center on Ethics and the Program in
Ethics and Society, featured 1 larvard
Prof. Michael Sandel.
The discussion was focused on the
ethical problems of using biomedical
technologies to determine and
choose from the genetic material of
human embryos, a predicament
Sandel discusses in his book, "The
Case Against Perfection: Ethics in
the Age of Genetic Engineering."

Sandel was joined by Law Prof. 1 lank
Greely'74 and Pediatrics Prof. David
Magnus Ph. D.'93 on the panel.
"These are three of the greatest
minds on this issue — not just for the
nation but for the globe," said Center
on Ft hies Director Deborah Rhode,
who is also a professor at the Law
School. "This issue has enormous pol
icy implications about the society we
live in and the world we will inherit."
Sandel spoke about some com
mon objections to embryonic genetic
engineering, such as the issue of sex
discrimination by predetermining a
child's gender,but he focused on mat
ters not currently on the public's
radar screen.
In particular,Sandel s;iid that love
for children should be unconditional
and that parents should accept the
qualities that their children naturally
acquire, rather than choosing them
through genetic engineering.
Parents already shape their chil
dren in [ways other than) genetic
molding, by sending them to tennis

camp and through SAT prep." Sandel
s aid. "I think they are very similar
forms of'hyper-parenting.'"
Though Greely and Magnus both
largely agreed with Sandel, they
nevertheless took issue with some of
his points. Their discussion of
whether genetic engineering is al
ways wrong and about the problems
of hyper-parenting seeped into the
audience, which was largely com

posed of professors. Still, the stu
dents in the crowd found the issue
intriguing.
"It was a very interesting topic,"
said Brooksie Riley "OS. "I think that
this is an important and growing issue
that most students would find inter
esting — particularly people that
were kids of hyper-parents."
Political Science and Classics Prof.
Josiah Ober, a member of the steer

ing committee of the Program in
Ethics and Society, underscored the
importance of the discussion.
"The next generation will have to
deal with this issue front and center,"
he said." ITiis is what Ethics and Soci
ety does — it sees the movement of
science and confronts those issues."

the Age of Genetic Engineering which was based on Harvard Professor Sandel's book and asked questions about issues such as parents' choices to predetermine the sex of their children.
