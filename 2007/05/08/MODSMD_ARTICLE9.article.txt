## Abilities of invasive plant species revealed Researchers express need to control invasive plants 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study in the department of bio
logical sciences has shed a startling new light
on the ability of invasive plant species to
thrive in foreign environments.
The study, which was published in the

April 2f> issue of "Nature," showed that inva
sive plants are more capable of adapting to
low-resource habitats than previously be
lieved. heightening the already serious threat
that invasive species pose to the planet's
ecosystems.
'I Tie lead author of the study, biological sci
ence postdoctoral scholar Jennifer Funk said
she believes that her team's findings may
demonstrate that limiting access to resources
such as water, nutrients and sunlight may not
be enough to deter the spread of invasive
plants. When these foreign species are left

unchecked they often drive out native plants
and come to dominate their adopted ecosys
tems.
"Invasive species can displace native
species which can then lead to ;i cascading ef
fect on other organisms, such as the insects,
birds and mammals that depend on the native
plants for food." Funk said in an email to The
Daily. "Invasive species can also alter ecosys
tem processes, such as nutrient and water cy
cling, fire regimes and forest productivity."
Invasive plant species enter for
eign habitats when their seeds are in
troduced into the area either by natu
ral process — such as strong winds or
accidental pollination — or human
action. Once in the ecosystem, these
species often flourish and wipe out the
indigenous plants in the competition
for resources.
Invasive species represent about

60 percent of the total plant species on
the Hawaiian Islands more than
any other area on the planet.
"Invasive plants are really one of
the biggest environmental threats of
the 20th century." said Biological Sci
ences Prof. Chris Held, director of the
Carnegie Institution's Department of
Global Ecology.
Ihe damage to the planet's ecosys
tems caused by invasive plant species
has been more costly than that caused
by global climate change, according to
Field. In the future.he warned,climate
change and invasive species could
combine to produce the ultimate ho

mogenization of global plant species.
Field stressed the importance of
I Link's study in illustrating the chal
lenges presented by the threat of inva
sive plants.
"Before, people thought you
would only get invasions when there
were extra resources lying around,"
Field said. "I think the main message
from the stud\ is that there isn't a one
size-fits-all (solution for invasive
species]."
As the threat of invasive plant
species continues to pose a challenge
for ecologists and researchers, finding
new ways o! containing the spread of

these species will be central to deter
ring threats to ecological diversity and
balance.
For her part. Funk offered a grim
outlook on the future of controlling
invasive species.
"I think that physical removal.cut
ting and spraying with herbicides, is
the only viable method of contain
ment," she said. "Obviously, preven
tion, curtailing horticultural introduc
tion and seed dispersal, is the most ef
fective tool against invasives."
