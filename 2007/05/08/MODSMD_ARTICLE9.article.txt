## Abilities of invasive plant species revealed Researchers express need to control invasive plants 
### ANDREW VALENCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study in the department of bio
logical sciences has shed a startling new light
on the ability of invasive plant species to
thrive in foreign environments.
The study, which was published in the

April 2f> issue of "Nature," showed that inva
sive plants are more capable of adapting to
low-resource habitats than previously be
lieved. heightening the already serious threat
that invasive species pose to the planet's
ecosystems.
'I Tie lead author of the study, biological sci
ence postdoctoral scholar Jennifer Funk said
she believes that her team's findings may
demonstrate that limiting access to resources
such as water, nutrients and sunlight may not
be enough to deter the spread of invasive
plants. When these foreign species are left

unchecked they often drive out native plants
and come to dominate their adopted ecosys
tems.
"Invasive species can displace native
species which can then lead to ;i cascading ef
fect on other organisms, such as the insects,
birds and mammals that depend on the native
plants for food." Funk said in an email to The
Daily. "Invasive species can also alter ecosys
tem processes, such as nutrient and water cy
cling, fire regimes and forest productivity."
