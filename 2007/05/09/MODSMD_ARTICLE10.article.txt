# Halo-ers battle for glory
## 
### LINUS LIANG 
Chairs were pushed aside to
make room for high definition
projectors, wide screens TVs, and
ten Xboxs last night as Wallenberg
Hall was transformed from a
classroom into a virtual play
ground.
On the agenda?
Outwitting, out-dodging, and
out-surviving 23 of Stanford's best
video gamers to earn the crown as
the campus Halo 2 champion.
Along with glory and bragging
rights, the winner would receive a
brand new Xbox 360.
That was Josh Liptzin '08, a com
puter science major. After finishing
his last midterm, the Halo regular
was ready for another challenge.
"I came out winning on all
ends," Liptzin said.
Liptzin said that he usually plays
online on his roommate's Xbox 360.
Now he has one of his own to prac
tice on.
Even though the tournament
was in the middle of midterm sea
son, it was attended by numerous
students from all majors. Spon
sored by Microsoft, the event in
cluded copious amounts of pizza, a
give-away every twenty minutes,
and even a live DJ.
Contestants in the tournament
were divided in groups of eight.
They played in a private room —
according to the event's organizers,
in order to spare contestants who

were "destroyed" the shame of em
barrassment. The lop four with the
most kills in each round moved
onto the next stage.
Organizers were pleased with
the results and hope to make this an
annual campus event.
