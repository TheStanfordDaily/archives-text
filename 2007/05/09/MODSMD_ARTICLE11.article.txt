## Editorial Board Stanford should help defray grad costs 
### 
As Stanford seniors ascend the steps
to the commencement stage to re
ceive their diplomas this June, one
problem they won't have to worry about is
being weighed down by heavy wallets. One
of the less noted aspects of graduation sea
son is that it winds up being rather pricey.
Between cap and gown rentals, formal tick
ets and yearbook costs,seniors can expect to
spend something to the tune of $200 to par
take in the various festivities and memora
bilia in their honor.
This might seem like a minor point in
comparison to the roughly $40,000 charged
to undergraduates every year for tuition
and boarding, but it is noteworthy in that
all seniors, regardless of their economic cir
cumstances, are expected to pay out of
pocket for these expenses. Factor in the
transportation and lodging costs for family
and well-wishers coming to see our gradu
ating seniors off, and it all adds up to a fair
ly substantial sum â€” one which may be
prohibitive to students of more modest
means.

The University Financial Aid Office con
siders graduation expenses within the cate
gory of personal costs and, therefore, does
not provide any extra financial support to
help.This is a broadly defensible position, as
students are not required to participate in
any of the events associated with gradua
tion. Still, at least as far as the commence
ment ceremony itself, we might ask whether
we want financial concerns to discourage
participation in something as important as
graduation. Commencement is a deeply
meaningful event and one in which all stu
dents who have earned a degree should feel
free to participate without guilt or hesita
tion.
Given these considerations, we advise
the University to look into ways of provid
ing financial assistance for students who
might be discouraged from participating
otherwise.This gesture would help Stanford
continue working toward its goal of being a
community that welcomes all students, re
gardless of their social or economic back
grounds.
