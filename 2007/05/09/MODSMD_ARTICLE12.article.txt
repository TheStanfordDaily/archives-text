# Everybody cut footloose
## 
### 
If all the ridiculous advice that adults
give children were compiled in a huge
didactic tome, the longest entry in the
index would be for the letter "U" — "U"
for underpants. Just how obsessed are we,
as a society, with undergarments? If you
get nervous speaking in front of a crowd,
just imagine them in their underpants.
Make sure you're wearing clean panties
just in case you get into an accident
(wouldn't want the doctor to think you
had negligent parents as he amputates
your leg). And my personal favorite ad
vice: "Never let them see you with just
your socks on."
This last one seems like plain old com
mon sense. There is no more absurd sight
in the world than a man who, while disrob
ing, removes his pants and shirt and stands
pitifully near-naked in black trouser socks.
The real heart of the advice, though, is in
its metaphorical heft. A naked man is infi
nitely vulnerable; one in socks, ludicrous.
This phrase is a reminder to keep yourself
covered at all times and costs to avoid em
barrassment.
But like Santa Claus, this is a case
where your parents are feeding you misin
formation. Warning people to do their ut
most not to appear ridiculous threatens
the inviolable rule of human conduct that
people are, in fact, utterly ridiculous.
Worse, it denies us our right to failure.
From the very beginning of our academic
lives, we are shoved into cozily suffocating
little niches and, over the course of endless
midterm report cards and parent-teacher
conferences, watch in horror as our
strengths and weaknesses are paraded in
front of us like doe-eyed desperate mod
els.
Bobby is good at biology; Susan's Span
ish is sloppy; poor little Irving will never
be an astronaut. As children, we form our
conceptions of who we are by how we per
form in relation to our peers. As slightly
bigger children here at Stanford, not much
has changed.
A recent Columbia study headed by
Carol Dweck examined the effects that
different types of praise had on children
in New York public schools. The general
swing of the thing was that several stu
dents were given tests easy enough for
even the paste-eaters to ace. When the
testers told the children the results, a
randomly selected half of the kids were
praised for their hard work, and the
other half were lauded for innate intelli
gence.
After this, the students were offered
their choice of two intelligence tests: one
similar to the exam they had all just
aced, and one that tried out a whole new
skill set. Most of the "hard-working" stu
dents chose to broaden their horizons by
scoping out the new test, while a huge
majority in the "innately intelligent' test
group opted to take the exam that previ
ous experience reassured them they
could ace.
One of the huge findings of the study

was that children who are pigeonholed as
being naturally intelligent became ab
solutely panic-stricken in situations that
threatened to knock down their whiz-kid
titles. They passed on chances to exercise
and increase their intelligence because
they were too scared to be caught with
just their socks on.
While your average Stanford under
graduate is hopefully beyond the point
where a gold star siicker can make or
break his self-perception, 1 think the im
plications of this study are visible all
around us. The vast majority of us were si
multaneously revered and reviled as "the
smart kid" in high school. We wrote bril
liant essays on books we d never read,
took college-level chemistry classes on a
whim, took naps during the SAT II Writ
ing and still knocked out that perfect 800
— we lived up to other people's expecta
tions and did so brilliantly.
The problem with this mentality is that
once we reach a level where our intelli
gence is no longer in question, we might
be too afraid of cracking our veneer of in
vincibility to push our limits. We don't
want to fail because we don't want anyone
else to see us earnestly and non-ironically
trying. Sure, anyone will tell you that
Babe Ruth had the highest strikeout aver
age in baseball, but he also had the high
est slugging average. So much of our per
sonalities are built in opposition to failure
that we can't run the risk of opening our
selves to it.
When I first came to Stanford, I person
ally fell in the naked/sock trap more times
than I can count — skipping office hours I
desperately needed, slacking off on busy
Sunday nights, studying for Russian
midterms with vocab drinking games —
and saw others around me doing the same
thing. Hut after three years of trial and
(much, much) error, I've come to realize
the benefits of the occasional recreational
failure: doing something not because you
know you'll be good at it, but because you
just wanted to try it. There's something to
be said for a series of uncalculated risks, of
every once in a while ripping off your
clothes, hitching up your socks and show
ing your vulnerability to whoever cares to
see it.
Just make sure to wear clean under
wear when you do. You know. In case of an
accident.

Kot is personally hoping that this column is
a spectacular failure. Let her know whether
she achieved this goal at
