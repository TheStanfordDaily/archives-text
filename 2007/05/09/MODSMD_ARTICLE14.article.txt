# Staying in touch, literally
## 
### 
In seventh grade, my "girlfriend" broke up
with me over AOL Instant Messenger. 1
still remember her words: "we r ovr,
TTYL :)." After this traumatic experience, 1
resolved never to use AIM again. When 1
came to college, 1 decided to give AIM an
other chance because I figured it might be a
good way to stay in touch with my friends
from home. With a new screen-name, and a
new beginning, 1 started using AIM like it
was my job.
But I slowly discovered that, despite
spending hours online, I really didn't know
how my friends were doing. I laughed at
clever away messages and knew everyone
was always "good," but I couldn't tell you
what my friends were studying or if they
were living on campus. As you might remem
ber, I cannot type. Whenever someone asked
me a question, I would reply with the easiest,
shortest answer possible — even if it was a
blatant lie.
Them: "Hey KP! How r u?"
Me: "Good, u?" (Desired response: "I'm
OK; my throat started to hurt this weekend,
so I think I'm coming down with something.
I'm also working on this paper that was due
yesterday, and I'm a little stressed....")
Them: "gr8!" (The next week they trans
fer schools because they're so unhappy.)
Is this any way to converse with some
one? By the end of the year. I hated AIM so
much I deleted it from my computer and
never looked back. Now, as graduation ap
proaches, I face the same dilemma. My
friends will spread around the globe and I,
once again, will need a way to keep in touch.
Modern technology certainly makes com
munication much easier than it was for our
parents' generation. While no longer the

frontier of new technology, the cell phone is
a good place to start. I purchased my first one
when I arrived at Stanford. I was immediate
ly captivated by my new ability to call any
one, anytime, from anywhere.
Although 90 percent of the time 1 only
used this luxury to call a friend at 4 a.m. to
slur "I love you," cell phones definitely help
disseminate important information ("Dude,
the test came back negative!"). Most of the
time, though, they only lead to interrupted
conversations and too many new voicemails.
If you screwed yourself by signing a two
year contract with the crappiest phone serv
ice on the planet (i.e., Sprint), then you'll
have to resort to using the Internet. Come on
— who doesn't love the occasional mass
email? If you're lucky, one person you know
will construct a great list of email addresses
that can be used by everyone to send out up
dates on his life — not to mention the latest
chain letter. Personally, I like to send a ficti
tious update and let friends guess which
events are actually true. It keeps things spicy.
I can't write an article about social net
working without mentioning the glorified
birthday-reminder Web site, Facebook. So
much has already been written about this site
that I'll spare readers another diatribe. I'll
simply say that if a long-lost friend relied en

tirely on my Facebook profile to understand
what was happening in my life, he or she
would likely conclude (#1) I have very few
friends and (#2) I go to the beach every
weekend.That's absurd considering only one
of these conclusions is accurate (Hint: I
haven't been to the beach all quarter).
Finally, some may turn to such fancy
modes of communication as blogs or person
al Web sites. These public domains are per
fect for those who like to be, well, public. Un
fortunately, their fatal flaw is that they re
quire proactive friends who visit the site on a
regular basis. A worst-case scenario is the
guy who sends a mass email with a link to his
personal blog every month. I'm actually no
longer his friend.
In the end. my favorite way to stay in
touch will always be a phenomenon that has •
become severely underappreciated: person
al interaction. It's crazy, 1 know. You're prob
ably asking, "Why plan a reunion when you
can just chat online?" One answer: spring
break 2(X)8! (more like, "spring long-week
end 2(X)8!"). When you grow up or experi
ence college with someone, it's funny how
months apart can seem like mere hours once
you're back together. I can learn more in a
five-minute conversation than 1 can in a
year's worth of instant messages.
A gathering of distant friends will remain
my ultimate goal, but, in the meantime. 1 sup
pose technology will suffice. And by "tech
nology" I mean writing inaccurate mass
emails and leavinu drunken voicemails.
TTYL.
