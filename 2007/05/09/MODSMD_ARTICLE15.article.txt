# Happiness is so 1992
## 
### 
After a long and tiring midterm exam
several days ago, I happened to look
down near my feet and find a Rice
Krispies Treat. There it was, in its package,
waiting for me, waiting to say a helpful.
"Dude, it's alright. You totally rocked it." It
was just sitting there; I have no idea how it
got there, but who cares? I can only assume it
was placed there by a kind and attractive
woman who was dropping the hint that she
would like to sleep with me.
1 went outside, in the perfect weather, and
the trees dropped some sort of seed pod on
my head, as if to reiterate: "These seed pods
are totally for you." Reading under a tree,
eating my Rice Krispies Treat and feeling the
world revolve around me, I thought, "Man,
this is happiness."
It's unfortunate that happiness now is so
passe. I saw a YouTUbe video the other day
that highlighted the commercials of 1992.
Everyone was so happy! There were happy,
singing old people and happy, singing cars
and yes, even happy, singing yogurt trees
(whatever a yogurt tree is). In fact, in nearly
every commercial, the actors broke out into
song — be it over TV dinners, coffee or cere
al. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the
commercial lineup of 1992 included a happy,
singing canister of genital itch cream.
TV today is flooded with commercials ad
vertising sex appeal, manliness and The Cool.
This is all well and good because these are the
permanent fixtures of the commercial com
munity, but when's the last time you saw a
musical, happy TV commercial? The best
we've got is "HEAD ON: Apply directly to
the forehead!" which has taken on a musical
quality of its own.
Our modern musical landscape offers a
bit more variety. You can choose between the
angsty, whiny suburban teenagers of rock
and the bombastic, egotistical ravings of cur
rent rap culture. 1 hate to say it, but our last
bastion of musical happiness unfortunately
lies in country music. "She was fine and she
was ready, in the back of my '59 Chevy!" cer
tainly brings to the table a bit of lighthearted
joy, albeit at the expense of the objectifica
tion of women and the destruction of the
English language.
What's to blame for all of this? No, it's not
the uncertainty of the modern world or the
disruption of the family. That all started long
ago. It's not the oppression of the bourgeoisie

or the fact that we're all so sexualized. Leave
those explanations to the old people.
Ilie explanation here lies in the figure of a
skinny teenager in all black clothing, with
hair parted over his eyes and his shirt torn, a
guy whose pants are tighter than Janet Jack
son's, and who can shoot web out of his track
marked wrists: Emo Spiderman.
Emo Spiderman is the very definition of
what is wrong with our society today."He's so
torn and deep, like a flower that's been sitting
in a vase for too long.""l le's moody and he's
upset!" But,just like "real-life" emos, his sor
row and angst are more than a bit ill-placed,

given that lie's got the beautiful Kirsten
Dunst and kickass superpowers, made even
more kickass by his black suit.
When did sadness become the "deep"
emotion? When did it become cool to have
unspoken internal angst — for guys to wear
eyeliner? The Emo movement has done
nothing but bad things for our society, leav
ing in its wake bratty kids with nothing better
to do than pretend to have layers to their
shallow, store-bought personalities.
And that's why it was all the more mirac
ulous that 1 found happiness the other day
with a Rice Krispies Treat and a tree. Happi
ness may be passe, especially in the realm of
column-writing. But what I felt yesterday, in
the middle of a hurricane of work, was a cer
tain happy calm. And 1 can only hope that
Emo Spiderman didn't encourage any of you
to forget what that feels like.

Nat was encouraged by his happiness to "clou
hie bag" it yesterday when he gave blood. Share
