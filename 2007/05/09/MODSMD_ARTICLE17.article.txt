## A 						worthy Warriors' tale 
### 
We're covering new ground
in my column this week:
the strange, strange world
of the NBA.
In another week, before the
Golden State Warriors took the
world by storm, 1 would doubtless
be writing about just how utterly
awkward and trite that staged rein
troduction of Roger Clemens to
the Bronx was. Or maybe I would
write about the latest Bonds polls
which, shockingly, show that whites
and blacks in America have differ
ent opinions on the San Francisco
Giants' divisive slugger.
But that was before Baron
Davis stole my sports-loving heart
with a gritty 20 points and 10 re
bounds on one leg in Game Six
against the Dallas Mavericks.
How much more fun is it to
watch Stephen Jackson, knowing
that he very well could snap at any
moment? Jackson has done it be
fore, and. by the end of these play
offs. I'm sure he'll do it again,earn
ing his third ejection of the post
season.
The Warriors' story reminds us
all why we watch sports. From their
fast, explosive style of play to their
engaging personalities, the cun
ning "Who, me?" attitude of their
mastermind coach and the roaring,
frenzied energy of their Oakland
fans, the Warriors are the story to
know in the sports world right now.
Personally, I've never been a
huge fan of the NBA before. My
home town. St. Louis, isn't exactly
a hotbed of professional hoops,
and the annual NBA Finals drama
was always swallowed up by an en
thusiasm for Cardinals baseball or
Blues hockey.
And really, it never seemed as
though we were missing much any
way. Victories by Shaq and Kobe or
the boring San Antonio crew year
in and year-out were enough to
turn anyone away.
Now. I finally get it. The drama
of postseason basketball is so thick
that the stories practically write
themselves. Jackson's role in the
Brawl at the Palace looms large
over his postseason ejections this
year. Baron Davis' inability to stay
healthy during the regular season
made his first-quarter exit in the
opening series' Game Six all the
more painful to watch.
And. of course, there was the
Don Nelson dynamic, as the dis
gruntled former employee took on
his old boss (Mark Cuban), the
teacher took on his pupil (Avery
Johnson) and Frankenstein decon
structed the monster he built (Dirk
Nowitzki). And all the while. Nel-


Griffin
Jtonts and Roves
lie's public demeanor was the stuff
of legend.
The coach pulled out all the
stops with his mind games.
The Mavs were apparently so
good that Golden State would be
lucky to win a single game. Nel
son's team was really just happy to
be there. And, of course, it was
only a matter of time before Dirk
started playing like an MVP again.
All the while, you knew that be
hind the "woe is us" words, Nellie
was laughing — he had just the
matchup he wanted, even if no one
else realized it. There's never been
a more powerful motivational
technique in sports than the "us
against the world" mentality thai
began to spread through the War
riors' locker room, helped by some
Charles Barkley banter.
And, amazingly, after one loss
to the Jazz in Salt Lake City, it'}
happening all over again. Listen tc
the national media and you'll soor
be convinced that the Warriors
days in the postseason are nunv
bered. Carlos Boozer. Jerry Sloar
and Deron Williams apparent!)

have the Warriors' number after
the Jazz's Game One. 116-112 vic
tory.
No one mentions Golden State
was just one missed three (by
Stephen Jackson) away from prob
ably winning that game. No one
mentions that the Jazz was barely
able to scrape by on its home court
in Utah and will soon experience
the maddening fury of Oakland.
I'll admit that I'm new to this
whole NBA thing, but the Warriors
have made believers out of me. Can
the Spurs or Suns stop them in the
conference finals? Sure. ITiose are
teams with ridiculous amounts of
talent and experience behind them
while Golden State is on its first
postseason foray in over a decade.
But the frantically energetic edge of
the Warriors will be too much for
Utah.
Nellie has come close already,
and there's no way he won't steal
at least one game in Salt Lake City.
And there's no way the Warriors
are losing at Oracle Arena.
Golden State is moving on, and
for that, every sports fan should be
grateful — if they can get me to
pay serious attention to the NBA,
something special is going on.
