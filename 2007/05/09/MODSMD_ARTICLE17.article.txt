## A
						worthy Warriors' tale 
### 
We're covering new ground
in my column this week:
the strange, strange world
of the NBA.
In another week, before the
Golden State Warriors took the
world by storm, 1 would doubtless
be writing about just how utterly
awkward and trite that staged rein
troduction of Roger Clemens to
the Bronx was. Or maybe I would
write about the latest Bonds polls
which, shockingly, show that whites
and blacks in America have differ
ent opinions on the San Francisco
Giants' divisive slugger.
But that was before Baron
Davis stole my sports-loving heart
with a gritty 20 points and 10 re
bounds on one leg in Game Six
against the Dallas Mavericks.
How much more fun is it to
watch Stephen Jackson, knowing
that he very well could snap at any
moment? Jackson has done it be
fore, and. by the end of these play
offs. I'm sure he'll do it again,earn
ing his third ejection of the post
season.
The Warriors' story reminds us
all why we watch sports. From their
fast, explosive style of play to their
engaging personalities, the cun
ning "Who, me?" attitude of their
mastermind coach and the roaring,
frenzied energy of their Oakland
fans, the Warriors are the story to
know in the sports world right now.
Personally, I've never been a
huge fan of the NBA before. My
home town. St. Louis, isn't exactly
a hotbed of professional hoops,
and the annual NBA Finals drama
was always swallowed up by an en
thusiasm for Cardinals baseball or
Blues hockey.
And really, it never seemed as
though we were missing much any
way. Victories by Shaq and Kobe or
the boring San Antonio crew year
in and year-out were enough to
turn anyone away.
Now. I finally get it. The drama
of postseason basketball is so thick
that the stories practically write
themselves. Jackson's role in the
Brawl at the Palace looms large
over his postseason ejections this
year. Baron Davis' inability to stay
healthy during the regular season
made his first-quarter exit in the
opening series' Game Six all the
more painful to watch.
And. of course, there was the
Don Nelson dynamic, as the dis
gruntled former employee took on
his old boss (Mark Cuban), the
teacher took on his pupil (Avery
Johnson) and Frankenstein decon
structed the monster he built (Dirk
Nowitzki). And all the while. Nel-
