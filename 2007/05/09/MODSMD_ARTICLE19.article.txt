# No. 16 Softball knocks out Aggies, 11-5
## Card ends non-conference season with a bang 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford Softball team
powered past UC-Davis in its final
non-conference game of the regular
season yesterday afternoon, winning
by a score of 11-5.
Junior righthander Becky McCul
lough (10-7) got the victory in relief
for sophomore righty Missy Penna,
who was pulled in the second inning
after racking up four walks and a hit
batter after only four outs.
Junior third baseman Michelle
Smith hit a pair of home runs and
had four RBls, and freshman center
fielder Alissa Haber continued to
shine in the batting order's third
spot, going three-for-four with a
triple and an RBI.
The Cardinal (33-16-1) built up a
4-0 lead before Davis (30-25-1) had a
chance to come to the plate. Aggies
pitcher Lindsey Tognetti gave up a
single to Smith between hitting
freshman right fielder Shannon Ko
plitzand walking junior second base
man Tricia Aggabao.
A fly ball to left field off the bat of
sophomore Maddy Coon looked as
though it would end the inning, but
the Davis outfielder dropped it. With
two outs, the Stanford baserunners
had taken off on contact, and all three
scored. Coon crossed the plate from
second on a single by junior Erin
Howe before senior shortstop Lind
sey Key flew out to end the inning.
The Cardinal looked as though it
might need every one of those first
inning runs in the bottom of the sec
ond. Penna gave up a single and then
walked two in a row to load the bases
with no outs; she then walked home a
run after forcing a pop-out from
Davis pinch-hitter Sarah Axelson.
Stanford coach John Rittman re
sponded by bringing in McC'ullough,
who struck out the next batter look
ing on a 3-2 pitch before getting a fly
out to end the inning. As it turned

looks to its remaining Pac-10 regular-season

to .500 in the league with games against the
Ducks and the Beavers this weekend. Satur
