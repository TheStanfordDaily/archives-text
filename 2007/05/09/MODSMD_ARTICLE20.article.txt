# Men's Tennis
## Getting back the swing 
### ELIZABETH PRATT 
hen the Stanford men's tennis team
took on California in Pacific-10
Conference play on Mar. 10. the
group looked different from the
team that played the Golden Bears
in 2006. In an occurrence that is extremely rare in col
lege tennis today. Stanford's stx-man singles lineup
solely included players who had not started in the pre
vious season.
With several players graduating, leaving the team or
suffering major injuries, the responsibility to represent
the Cardinal this season rested mainly on the shoulders
of the team's relatively unseasoned players. And despite
the challenges of match play and the pressure to live up
to past years, the players gained one of the most valuable
assets, experience.
"All of the elements were there for this season to be
successful, but a couple things didn t go our way," sopho
more Jeff Zeller said. "But the experience we gained
from this year is only going to help us, and it's going to
make us a lot more successful come next season."
Stanford finished 8-16 overall and 2-5 in the Pac-10
for the season, which many would coasider a disappoint
ment after last war's 18-4.6-1 Pac-10 record. Still, the
Cardinal looks at this year as one that ran make the team
stronger.
"I feel like (the season] was a growing experience."
sophomore Blake Muller said. "I know that the fresh
men learned a lot this year. 1 know 1 learned a lot too. It'll
be a great inspiration for next year.''
Much of the team's inspiration will come from what
head coach John Whitlinger called this season's low
point: not earning an invitation to the 2007 NCAA team
championships.
"Not getting your name called |for the tournament] is
disappointing.'' Whitlinger said, 'i don't plan on going
through that again."
Since the inception of the NCAA tournament, the
Cardinal has received a bid to the team championships
every year except 1982 and 1987. Stanford has the most
successful men's collegiate tennis program in history,
having won a record 17 national titles.The most recent of
those came in 2000.
"(Missing the tournament] is tough, but going for
ward. I think, it's a motivator." Zeller said. Hie guys are

going
to work harder

to get us into the position we want to be in next year,
which is competing for a national title."
Dick Gould, the director of Stanford tennis who also
coached the men's team to numerous championships be
tween 1968 to 2004, thinks this year's squad is bouncing
back well.
"You always learn from hard times, and they come
when you least expect them " Gould said. "That's the
way things work in this world."
Whitlinger. a Stanford tennis standout who won
NCAA singles, doubles and team titles during liis time
on the squad, emphasized that the championships are
only one measurement of achievement. While he knows
the NCAAs are an important part of a season, he also
said that many other factors define success.
"It's the progress made every day and how they ma-

ture as individuals — there's so much
more that goes into the team and into
development than wins and losses.'
Whitlinger said.
Zeller agreed with his coach, and the

sophomore thinks his teammates are
not only tougher on the court after this sea
son's challenges but also more confident.
"I think everyone is happy with the progress that
we've made." he said. "If you ask any guy on the team,
they'll say they are a much better tennis player now than
they were in the beginning of the year."
Though much of the Cardinal s development came
at the expense of its win-loss record, the season was not
without its highlights. Whitlinger cited senior Dave
Ryan's match-clinching victory against Santa Clara,
the win over No. 26 Miami at the ITA Indoor Nation
als in FebruarV (where the Card, at the time, was
ranked 28th). and the team's outstanding success at
this year's Pac-10 Individual Championships as no
table points in the season.


Muller. Zeller and their coach all
showed appreciation for the rest of
the Stanford squad. Muller praised
the team's "great camaraderie," and
Zeller enjoyed the team's chemistry
and work ethic.
Gould idenfitied another upside to
the Stanford program this season.
"We have two great coaches: John
Whitlinger and [assistant coach]
David Hodge, who are the best coach
ing combination in the country." he
said. "With their leadership, you're
going to see tremendous success in
the years ahead."
Despite the team's failure to re

ceive a hid. NCAA success is still with
in the Cardinal's reach this season.
Sophomore Matt Bruch. the 200(->
and 2(M)7 l'ac-10 singles champion,
will compete in the NCAA singles
championships beginning May 23.
Additionally, Bruch and Muller were
selected to compete in the NCAA
doubles championship, starting May
24. The duo will try to win the title
most recently earned for Stanford in
2CX)4 by Sam Warburg and KC Cork
ery.
"1 got to watch the individual
championships last year, and I re
member milking it one of my person
al goals to be in them," Muller said.
"Obviously, the team is what matters
most, but to be in the individuals is
great."
