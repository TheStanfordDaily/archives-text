## A 						Friendship's Course 
### BY ANTHONY NGUYEN 
Even before entering Stanford, seniors Lau
ren Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
knew that they were going to anchor the
now-No. 11 Stanford women's golf team
for years to come. What they didn't know
was that they would soon become close friends as
well, forging their friendship on and off the golf
course.
Seniors in high school, Todd and Tangtiphai
boontana first met during a spring break tourna
ment in Arizona. At dinner, the two struck up con
versation knowing that they would soon be team
mates for the Card.
"The first thing I remember Lauren telling me
was,i'm a very sarcastic person, so if I throw out any
sarcastic phrases please don't hold it against me,"'
Tangtiphaiboontana said.
As Tangtiphaiboontana recounted theii lirst ex
change of words.Todd chuckled in embarrassment.
"I was expecting the worst in terms of sarcasm,
but Lauren wasn't that bad at all." langtiphaiboon
tana assured her teammate.
In their freshman year, the two could not hang
out much outside of practice and competition, hav
ing to deal with the time pressures of school and ath
letics. Still, their lifelong friendship would begin that
year.
"We definitely got along from the get-go,"
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "Freshman year was
great, but sophomore year, we took off. We got real
ly close and it caught on from there."
Since then, the duo has forged a unique, sister
like bond that transcends that of mere teammates.
"We know what to say at the right time," Todd
said." We're good motivators for one another. We're
very competitive with each other, but not in a bad
way. If I'm not going to win anything, I want |the
winner] to be Jennie."
Tangtiphaiboontana expressed the same senti
ments when asked about her second-half of the tan
dem.
"Lauren is a great teammate — we're both very
competitive and supportive at the same time," she
said.'i didn't know Lauren well before coming into
Stanford. 1 didn't think I would actually have a best
friend on the team."

This year, the two are setting career lows in most
statistical categories. Todd and Tangtiphaiboontana
boast stroke averages of 74.0 and 74.7 per round, re
spectively. Both have also played a team-high 26
rounds this season.
While Tangtiphaiboontana has been steadily
lowering her stroke average, Todd experienced an

off-year last season. As a junior,

Todd's 76.2 stroke average was the

highest it had ever been.

This year,Todd lowered her av
erage to 74.0, second-lowest on

'
the team, next to sophomore Mari
Chun. Todd credits her vast im

provement to many factors, and

among those is Tangtiphaiboontana.

Todd said that her teammate became an

other putting and short-game instructor for
her, helping to decrease Todd's number of
putts per round in her short game.

"Jennie has an incredible short game,"
Todd said. "She makes putts when she has to

make them. So, I've picked up a lot of things that
she has done."

Tangtiphaiboontana is also learning from her
friend as well. Noting Todd's ability to stroke the
ball,Tangtiphaiboontana tweaked her swing, which
has led to where she is today as a player.
Spending the last four years together has
brought Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd very close,
each knowing that they had an accountable partner
in the other.
"It's so much easier knowing every time I go to
work out, every time 1 go to practice and every time
I step on the field, thai my friend is going to be
there,"Todd said.
Their experiences on the team have also been
similar.Though having played at the collegiate level
for many years, both players hadn't realized their
abilities to play at the pro-level until earlier this sea
son.
"Last year, when 1 played at nationals, it was the
first time in my career where 1 was in contention for
the individual title "Tangtiphaiboontana said."Usu
ally I've never been in that position, especially at the
national level, so to me, it was a wake-up point."

"l thought to myself,"Maybe I am
an actual good player, maybe 1 can
compete with all these girls turning
pro,"'she added. "It was a good confi
dence booster coming into this year."
Todd shared a similar anecdote,
fitting for the both.
"At the Stanford Intercollegiate
last fall. 1 was in the final group and
it was pretty close," Todd said. "1
played good golf, hung on. and it was
the first time I thought that 1 could
compete with those girls, compete at
the highest level of college golf. I hit
some good strokes going down the
stretch, and it felt good doing so

under pressure."
Despite their success these last four
years, all good things must come to an
end. As the year comes to a finish, the
Stanford squad creeps closer to part
ing with its two longtime leaders.
Even more so, Tangtiphaiboon
tana and Todd come closer to parting
with each other.
Though both will be playing in the
Women's U.S. Open Oualifiers later
this year, their paths will diverge for
the first time in a while.
After the season finishes,Todd will
be working for Health Care Partners
in Los Angeles and will eventually
head home to Phoenix. Ariz, for her
commercial real-estate license. She
hopes to soon turn pro and play out of
her hometown.
Tangtiphaiboontana. on the other
hand, is first scheduled to play in Thai

land this summer. Later on. she too
will work for a health-care consulting
company, though in San Francisco —
hundreds of miles away from Todd.
Eventually, Tangtiphaiboontana is
looking at entering medical school.
When asked about keeping in
touch post-Stanford. Todd had no
qualms about their friendship.
"I definitely have faith that we'll
stay close," Todd said. "I hope to be
back in the Bay Area one day, and I
know she'll settle down here. 1 have
faith in our bond."
Offering another incentive, Todd

added, "We have to stay close — Jen
nie is going to he one of my brides
maids."
With June around the corner, the
transition to life without each other is
larger than reality for the two players.
But after the last four years, it appears
as though nothing can break their
bond.
"We travel in a pair," Tangtiphai
boontana said. "You get one, you're
going to get the other."

dence booster coming into this year."
Todd shared a similar anecdote,
fitting for the both.
"At the Stanford Intercollegiate
last fall. 1 was in the final group and
it was pretty close," Todd said. "1
played good golf, hung on. and it was
the first time I thought that 1 could
compete with those girls, compete at
the highest level of college golf. I hit
some good strokes going down the
stretch, and it felt good doing so

under pressure."
Despite their success these last four
years, all good things must come to an
end. As the year comes to a finish, the
Stanford squad creeps closer to part
ing with its two longtime leaders.
Even more so, Tangtiphaiboon
tana and Todd come closer to parting
with each other.
Though both will be playing in the
Women's U.S. Open Oualifiers later
this year, their paths will diverge for
the first time in a while.
After the season finishes,Todd will
be working for Health Care Partners
in Los Angeles and will eventually
head home to Phoenix. Ariz, for her
commercial real-estate license. She
hopes to soon turn pro and play out of
her hometown.
Tangtiphaiboontana. on the other
hand, is first scheduled to play in Thai

land this summer. Later on. she too
will work for a health-care consulting
company, though in San Francisco —
hundreds of miles away from Todd.
Eventually, Tangtiphaiboontana is
looking at entering medical school.
When asked about keeping in
touch post-Stanford. Todd had no
qualms about their friendship.
"I definitely have faith that we'll
stay close," Todd said. "I hope to be
back in the Bay Area one day, and I
know she'll settle down here. 1 have
faith in our bond."
Offering another incentive, Todd

added, "We have to stay close — Jen
nie is going to he one of my brides
maids."
With June around the corner, the
transition to life without each other is
larger than reality for the two players.
But after the last four years, it appears
as though nothing can break their
bond.
"We travel in a pair," Tangtiphai
boontana said. "You get one, you're
going to get the other."

Even before entering Stanford, seniors Lau
ren Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
knew that they were going to anchor the
now-No. 11 Stanford women's golf team
for years to come. What they didn't know
was that they would soon become close friends as
well, forging their friendship on and off the golf
course.
Seniors in high school, Todd and Tangtiphai
boontana first met during a spring break tourna
ment in Arizona. At dinner, the two struck up con
versation knowing that they would soon be team
mates for the Card.
"The first thing I remember Lauren telling me
was,i'm a very sarcastic person, so if I throw out any
sarcastic phrases please don't hold it against me,"'
Tangtiphaiboontana said.
As Tangtiphaiboontana recounted theii lirst ex
change of words.Todd chuckled in embarrassment.
"I was expecting the worst in terms of sarcasm,
but Lauren wasn't that bad at all." langtiphaiboon
tana assured her teammate.
In their freshman year, the two could not hang
out much outside of practice and competition, hav
ing to deal with the time pressures of school and ath
letics. Still, their lifelong friendship would begin that
year.
"We definitely got along from the get-go,"
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "Freshman year was
great, but sophomore year, we took off. We got real
ly close and it caught on from there."
Since then, the duo has forged a unique, sister
like bond that transcends that of mere teammates.
"We know what to say at the right time," Todd
said." We're good motivators for one another. We're
very competitive with each other, but not in a bad
way. If I'm not going to win anything, I want |the
winner] to be Jennie."
Tangtiphaiboontana expressed the same senti
ments when asked about her second-half of the tan
dem.
"Lauren is a great teammate — we're both very
competitive and supportive at the same time," she
said.'i didn't know Lauren well before coming into
Stanford. 1 didn't think I would actually have a best
friend on the team."

This year, the two are setting career lows in most
statistical categories. Todd and Tangtiphaiboontana
boast stroke averages of 74.0 and 74.7 per round, re
spectively. Both have also played a team-high 26
rounds this season.
While Tangtiphaiboontana has been steadily
lowering her stroke average, Todd experienced an

off-year last season. As a junior,

Todd's 76.2 stroke average was the

highest it had ever been.

This year,Todd lowered her av
erage to 74.0, second-lowest on

'
the team, next to sophomore Mari
Chun. Todd credits her vast im

provement to many factors, and

among those is Tangtiphaiboontana.

Todd said that her teammate became an

other putting and short-game instructor for
her, helping to decrease Todd's number of
putts per round in her short game.

"Jennie has an incredible short game,"
Todd said. "She makes putts when she has to

make them. So, I've picked up a lot of things that
she has done."

Tangtiphaiboontana is also learning from her
friend as well. Noting Todd's ability to stroke the
ball,Tangtiphaiboontana tweaked her swing, which
has led to where she is today as a player.
Spending the last four years together has
brought Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd very close,
each knowing that they had an accountable partner
in the other.
"It's so much easier knowing every time I go to
work out, every time 1 go to practice and every time
I step on the field, thai my friend is going to be
there,"Todd said.
Their experiences on the team have also been
similar.Though having played at the collegiate level
for many years, both players hadn't realized their
abilities to play at the pro-level until earlier this sea
son.
"Last year, when 1 played at nationals, it was the
first time in my career where 1 was in contention for
the individual title "Tangtiphaiboontana said."Usu
ally I've never been in that position, especially at the
national level, so to me, it was a wake-up point."

"l thought to myself,"Maybe I am
an actual good player, maybe 1 can
compete with all these girls turning
pro,"'she added. "It was a good confi
dence booster coming into this year."
Todd shared a similar anecdote,
fitting for the both.
"At the Stanford Intercollegiate
last fall. 1 was in the final group and
