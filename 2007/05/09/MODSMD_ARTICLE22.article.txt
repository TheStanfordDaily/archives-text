## Astronomer sees Mayan culture in stars 
### ROXNA IRANI 
Anthropologist and Archaeoas
tronomer Timothy King M.A. '04
spoke to a packed audience yester
day evening in Pigott Hall to explain
how Maya astronomy reflects the
rich culture of its people.
King, who also received his Ph.D.
from the University last year, pre
sented his latest research findings
about ancient Maya depictions of
constellations, meteor showers and
eclipses.
"The sky is the only universal
topic across all cultures," King said.
"It therefore provides for an ex
tremely interesting cross-cultural
study."
Mayan astronomers maintained
an extremely detailed record of their
findings in codices made from hark
paper. King said, but only four
codices survived the 16th century
Spanish missionaries, who burned
them because they believed the writ
ing was the devil's work.
King discussed Mayan and Euro
pean constellations to demonstrate
how cultural paradigms influenced
differing interpretations of the cos
mos.
Students said they found the pro
gram informative because it re
vealed the beliefs of a foreign cul
ture.
"We always look at the cosmos
through the lens of Western civiliza

tion when really the Mayans seemed
to have a much more lyrical and pre
cise way of tracking the stars," said
Josh Wong "10. " Ihe way King laid
out the facts made me appreciate
how absolutely brilliant the Mayan
nighttime narratives really were."
"It was very interesting to see an
other culture's interpretation of the
niuht skies," said Nick Casev '05.

King urged his audience to better
appreciate the skies as he finished his
presentation.
"Look up," he said. "As long as
humans have been humans, they've
looked up. I want my audience to do
the verv same."
