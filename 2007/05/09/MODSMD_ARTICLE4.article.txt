## Unexpected debate over SOCA funding Senators move prompts procedural questions 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ASSIJ Senator Patrick Cordova '09
took an unorthodox measure to obtain
funding for a Stanford Organizing Com
mittee in the Arts (SOCA) program dur
ing last night's Undergraduate Senate
meeting.
Cordova, a former SOCA co-chair, in
troduced SOCA representatives Bria
Long '09 and Mei l.i '09.The pair spoke
to senators about their search for addi
tional funding for SOCA on Display, a
program that l.i said "aims to provide
gallery spaces on campus for students to
showcase artistic abilities."
The speeches by Cordova, Long and
Li were met with confusion from other
senators, who were unsure about the kind
of money SOCA was applying for and
why they were at the meeting.The atmos
phere grew tenser still when Li explained
that SOCA on Display could achieve
"long term sustainability" for its program
via funding from Absolute F : un. a discre
tionary fund controlled by the executives.
ASSIJ Vice President Mondaire Jones

'09 told the group that their ap
pearance before the Senate
was "unnecessary" because
groups seeking that sort of
funding typically meet with ex
ecutives to pitch their causes.
To get the Absolute Fun
money, Avula and Jones would
submit a proposal to President
John Hennessy. Pending their
approval, the money could be
dispersed to the group.

"|ASSU President] Her
shey [Avula '08] and I would have been
happy to sit down and meet with you,"
Jones said. "It makes more sense for
SOCA to schedule a meeting with us. so
that we can figure out how they might fit
into our Absolute 112 un proposal or find
other sources of funding for them."
Cordova said he wanted SOCA mem
bers to make an appearance before the
Senate because he felt the group had
been slighted by past ASSU representa
tives. Cordova remained persistent, even
after Jones said that he and Avula would
have met with SOCA if they had ex
pressed interest.

"This was a way to ensure that you
will," Cordova said.
The sophomore emphasized that he
had invited representatives from the
group because he wanted to make sure
that prior commitments by the outgoing
executives were upheld.
"My concern was that if a promise had
been made, it shouldn't have been lost
because of change of executive," Cordo
va added. "I can't speak to what [former
ASSIJ Vice President ] Lauren Graham
f*o7l said, but I feel that this program
should be made a priority even if there
was no promise."

Cordova said his motivation was to
make sure the art's group found ade
quate funding, regardless of the source.
"If they don't go through Absolute
Fun," he said, "it's fine with me."
Executive Cabinet
The meeting ended on a tense note.
Cordova asked Jones to explain how he
and Avula had selected their executive
cabinet, pressing Jones for details about
the number of applications received and
the number of people who had been inter-

Jones explained that he and Avula
had evaluated candidates on a
number system, and given inter
views to those who received a par
ticular score.
Appropriations Committee
Before the meeting concluded,
Senator Tom Vacek ' 10 said he was
frustrated with a quote given to the
Daily by Senate Chair Priyanka
Sharma's '09 for Monday's paper.
He said that the quote unfairly
characterized him as less than
qualified to be the appropriations
chair.
"I picked the best person for the

job," Sharma told The Daily on
Sunday after deciding on Corinne
Prudhomme "09 as chair of the ap
propriations committee. "It's not
just a finance position; it's a leader
ship position too. It's eight people
on the committee and it takes good
personal skills for the committee to
work well."
"I was disappointed and felt
that the quote did not reflect the
situation accurately and properly,"
Vacek said last night.
"I stand by my comment," Shar
ma responded. "There was an issue
of co-chairs raised and they felt
that the quote did not address that
situation. The question I was
swering was why I made the choice
I made, and the content [of the
quote] is still correct in that sense."
