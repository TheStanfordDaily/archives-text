# HPACs on razor's edge
## RAs, Univ. staff left to fill advising role 
### NIRAJ SHETH LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Go ahead — add your friendly
dorm HPAC to the endangered
species list. They may very well soon
be extinct.
In a pilot program beginning next
year, some undergraduate resi
dences— including several with
freshmen — will lose a staff member
dedicated to academic advising. ITie
University hopes that this change
will replace an inconsistent system of
peer mentoring with a larger role for
advising professionals and faculty.
Unaffected dorms will retain
Head Peer Academic Coordinators
(HPACs) and Head Peer Mentors
(HPMs) while others will increase
the number of Residence Assistants

(RAs) to fill the vacancy. At the same
time, the role of Academic Directors
(ADs) — full-time staff who super
vise residential academic advising
for entire dorm complexes — will he
expanded.
The change comes as a result of
increasing concern among adminis
trators and faculty that the academic
advising provided by HPACs and
HPMs in dorms is often inadequate,
but some current staff members
worry that eliminating these posi
tions could negatively impact the ac
ademic advice students receive in
their dorms.
"Throughout the history of the
program, there have been concerns
about the inconsistent quality of ad
vising that HPACs deliver" Under
graduate Advising and Research
(UAR) Director Susie Brubaker-
Cole said in an email to The Daily.
"We have also seen many, many in
stances of peer advisors providing in
accurate or short-sighted advice that
has led to. in the best cases, sub-opti
mal academic decisions by residents
and. in the worst cases, fairly serious
academic consequences."
Brubaker-Cole cited several Uni
versity and national studies that
show that "peer advising is common
ly identified as a weakness in the cur
rent system." In particular, she said
peer advisors often fail to refer stu
dents to academic advisors despite
being specifically trained to do so or
to have deeper conversations about
broader academic choices.
HPM roles will be eliminated in
Florence Moore Hall. Toyon and
three of the six Stern Hall dorms:
Larkin. Burbank and Donner. ADs
will oversee residential advising in
FloMo, Stern and Toyon. One RA in
Toyon — a dorm that currently has
two HPACs — will have "special li
aison responsibilities" to UAR. Res
ident Fellows (RFs) in Serra, Twain
and Casa Zapata — the remaining
three houses in Stern — opted to re
tain the HPM position for another
year.
Peer academic advisors on staff in
residences without an academic di
rector (AD) are called HPACs while
the ones in dorms with an AD are
HPMs.
Among student staff, the changes
have been greeted with mixed reac
tions. Some, like Rinconada HPM
Sal Bonaccorso '08, are concerned
about the consequences of losing a
"point person" for academic advis

ing in dorms.
"[Next year] if you do have an ac
ademic problem, there's not one per
son that residents can go to," Bonac
corso said. "It's really useful to have
a point person for academic pro
gramming and academic advising."
Others expressed concern that
the type of peer academic advice stu
dents get from HPACs might be ir
revocably lost.
"While academic directors are in
credibly knowledgeable and well
equipped to advise students, they
probably aren't as familiar with the
ins-and-outs of taking your first
Chem 33 midterm as a fellow student
is," Alondra HPAC Chris Aakre '08
said in an email. Aakre will be retun
ing to the dorm next year as an RA.
But some staff members said that
eliminating the HPAC position
could change staff dynamics for the
better.
"Overall, [it will bej better for the
team to do it that way since then is
sues of rank and pay don't get in
volved," said Cardenal RA Peter
Durning '07. "At least as it works in
Flo Mo. HPACs often do as much as
RAs."
RAs say they expect to take over
for HPACs by adding academic pro
gramming to the list of events and ac
tivities they already coordinate and
academic advising to the list of serv
ices they provide for residents.
The impact of the change will be
less severe for RFs, who are respon
sible for managing the entire staff.
"As a staff, we're going to have to
pay more attention to academic pro
gramming since no one on the staff
will have that express responsibility,"
said East FloMo RF Greg Watkins in

an email to The Daily. "It doesn't
have a big impact on our RF role.
Losing a staff member completely
would have had a big impact, but our
HPACs have been replaced with an
additional RA in each dorm."
UAR's announcement of the de
cision to cut back on the number of
HPAC positions available next year
came after many students had al
ready decided to apply for the posi
tions.
"A lot of people had intended to
apply as HPACs for next year,"
Durning said, "and found out at the
last minute they couldn't and had to
rework their applications."
Brubaker-Cole agreed imple
mentation has unfolded more slowly
than UAR officials had wanted but
that Residential Education (ResEd)
stepped in to resolve the application
dilemma.
"ResEd was very helpful in help
ing us to remedy this by agreeing to
allow HPAC applicants to apply for
both RA and HPAC/HPM positions,
which is not normally allowed," she
said.
Even as dorm staff members fig
ure out how to cope without HPACs,
further changes to residential advis
ing beyond next year could still be in
the works.
"This is a continuation of changes
to the HPAC/HPM program that
have been taking place over the past
three to four years," Brubaker-Cole
said. "TTiis is something we're very
interested in continuing to pursue as
a part of the residential and advising
landscape.
