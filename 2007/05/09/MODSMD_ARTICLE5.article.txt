Go ahead — add your friendly
dorm HPAC to the endangered
species list. They may very well soon

freshmen — will lose a staff member
dedicated to academic advising. ITie
University hopes that this change
will replace an inconsistent system of
peer mentoring with a larger role for
advising professionals and faculty.
Unaffected dorms will retain
Head Peer Academic Coordinators
(HPACs) and Head Peer Mentors
(HPMs) while others will increase
the number of Residence Assistants

(RAs) to fill the vacancy. At the same

(ADs) — full-time staff who super

for entire dorm complexes — will he
expanded.

increasing concern among adminis

advising provided by HPACs and
HPMs in dorms is often inadequate,
but some current staff members
worry that eliminating these posi
