## Trustees weigh increased spending of endowment University programs may get funding boost 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
ITic University's endowment is
growing much faster than it is being
spent, according to Board of
Trustees Chair Burt McMurty.
Given the continuing double-digit
growth rates in the endowment fund
each year, the Board will consider
increasing endowment payouts at
its June meeting.
In an interview with The Daily
yesterday, McMurty described sev
eral of the major issues that the
Board considered during a four-day

retreat in late April, one of which
was the University's low level of
spending relative to its target en
dowment payout.
"Between 1982 and now." he
said, "we have been spending less
than the endowment has been grow
ing."
He explained that the University
tries to spend (or pay out) about five
percent of its endowment each year.
Given that the endowment in
creased by 19.5 percent last year and
has consistently experienced dou
ble-digit growth rates in the last
decade. McMurty suggested that the
University could increase its pay
out.
If the Board does decide to in
crease the endowment's payout rate
when it meets in June, McMurty
said, the University could divert
some of its general funds to various
student and faculty programs.
"I'm quite sure that some of that
payout will be distributed to finan
cial aid," he said."How that is going
to be divided between domestic and
international students has yet to be
decided."
For the first time this year, the
University offered full financial aid
for students whose parents earn an
nual incomes below $45,000 and re
duced the expected family contribu
tion for those with annual incomes
between $45,000 and $60,000. While
McMurty said he hoped these new
changes would boost the Universi
ty's socioeconomic diversity, he em
phasized the need for an increase in
financial aid for middle-income
families.
He also addressed the glaring de
ficiencies in Stanford's financial aid

program for international students
a program that is not need-blind.
"Our current situation is less
than desirable," McMurty said. '"A
lot of able foreign undergraduate
students cannot attend Stanford be
cause they cannot afford to do so."
The growth in the endowment
also motivated the Board to reevalu
ate the endowment payout's contri
bution to the University's overall
budget. McMurty said Stanford
spends less from its endowment fund
(about 20 percent of total operating
costs come from the endowment)
than peer institutions (some of
which spend twice that proportion).
"Harvard and Yale have an en
dowment payout in the 305," Mc-
Murty said. "Princeton has one
that's in the low 405."
Although McMurty said that
Stanford would not aspire to
achieve such high levels of endow
ment payout, the Board would con
sider a moderate increase.
McMurty also said that the Uni
versity's low reliance on endow
ment payout made it increasingly
dependent on funding from the fed
eral government, which he said pro
vides 36 percent of Stanford's annu

al budget.
The University's endowment
was approximately $15.3 billion last
June — making it the third largest
in the country, behind only Harvard
and Yale. It has grown at an annual
rate of 14.8 percent over the last 10
years.
At the retreat, which was held at
Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe
from Apr. 22 to Apr. 25.the Board
also reevaluated the University's
recent expansion and the impact of
the construction of a number of new
buildings on campus. McMurty ex
pressed enthusiasm at the emphasis
the University has placed on sus
tainable design, touting the energy
and water efficiency of the Jerry
Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Envi
ronment and Energy Building,
which is currently under construc
tion.
The Board also considered the
growing impact of globalization on
the University and appointed a task
force to study its ramifications for
Stanford both domestically and
abroad.
