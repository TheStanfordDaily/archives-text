# PAGE TWO PRESENTS:
## Draw-ing the short straw The 						Daily discusses fairness with Philosophy Prof. Marc Pauly 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
At 5 p.m. today, students will crowd around
residence offices and stand on their toes to get a
peek at their assigned Draw numbers. Those
who see low numbers will celebrate next year's
housing prospects; some who have repeatedly
received high numbers will resign themselves to
an unfavorable residence. Others will raise the
issue of fairness.
Once students have submitted their housing
preferences, what is the fairest way to decide who
should live where? And how does the current
Draw mechanism meet or fail to meet various
criteria for fairness ?
Philosophy Prof. Marc Pauly sat down with
The Daily in an attempt to answer these ques
tions. He called for a University-wide discussion
about what students, alumni and administrators
value regarding their residential experiences.
The Stanford Daily: Given what the current
Draw situation considers — preferences of res
idences. Draw group size, priorities, and gender
— what makes a fair or optimal assignment?
Mart- Pauly: 1 actually don't know what a fair or opti
mal assignment is. That's the question that we as a Uni
versity should be discussing 'ITie Draw is something
that's already decades old. and I think from the very be
ginning when it was implemented it was never really put
to the University community, you know: what do we
think actually is a fair assignment? What are the things
that we care about? I think that's the kind of value-ori
ented discussion that we still need to have, and then
based on that we should just go with what we think are
criteria of fairness.
It's clear that there are a couple of things that immedi
ately come to mind that one would consider desirable.
One is that you would want an assignment sueh that there
are no two people who would like to exchange residences.
Say you're assigned to Terra and I'm assigned to Kairos,
and 1 actually prefer your residence and you prefer mine.
'ITien we would really like to switch assignments, and ide
ally that shouldn't be possible.
Another thing that 1 think students worry a lot about
is strategizing — so you want a mechanism where it's not
advantageous to just lie about what your preferences
are. So a mechanism that induces honesty from the stu
dents is certainly something that's desirable. And the
current mechanism does that to some extent, but there
are other issues. Like, since you can only list eight pref
erences, what preferences are you going to list? Well,
that will depend on what Draw number you get, what
houses drew in the previous years — so there are other
elements of strategizing that haven't been discussed in
the formal literature yet.
So the strategizing issue, this kind of optimality in
which everyone is happiest with their current assignment,
those are some of the things that, in a discussion about

"The problem with the lottery system is that it is, of course, fair in
the long run, but since you're only here for three years,
there isn't much of a long run."
MARC PAULY,philosophy professor

what one would like, would certainly come up, and then
it's a question of, can we get everything that we want si
multaneously or not?
If you get rid of Draw groups and some other extra
hells and whistles, then the current system is based on
the Gale-Shapley algorithm. That algorithm has been
studied quite a lot in the literature because it's also been
used for assigning residents to hospitals — an intern
matching program. There's a national program where if
I want to be a doctor in residence at a hospital. I can list
my preferences, and the hospitals also list their prefer
ences for doctors. 'ITien the question is, how do you
match those two groups who both have preferences?
There's a national program that does that, and the way
that is done is also with this Gale-Shapley algorithm. So
what we do here,at the very basis, is something very sim
ilar.
TSI): Do you think it's possible to have a system that
would give us all of the things that we want?
MP: No — from the formal literature in social choice
we know that already very basic,simple requirements end
up being in conflict. So my expectation is that this will hap
pen here as well.
Hut 1 would still hope that we would have a discussion
as to how important we see each of these criteria to be. Be
cause some of the choices that are maybe made for this

hospital/doctor residence matching program — maybe
they're appropriate for that situation hut not for us, and
we should maybe make different choices.
TSD: What are some benefits and drawbacks to the
current system?
!\IP: It's certainly positive on the strategizing side, at
least in the sense that 1 don't think it's beneficial for stu
dents to lie about what their preferences are. On this opti
mally side, the current system is not what we call Pareto
optimal. There are algorithms that we know of that are
both strategy-proof and Pareto-optimal, but they have
other drawbacks, and then the discussion is, well, is it okay
to accept those other drawbacks?
TSI): What would these other drawbacks be?
MP: A drawback of another system would be a lack of
stability — let me explain it with the doctors and the resi
dences. What happened there was that a couple of
decades back, the people found out — before the system
was redone — that doctors and hospitals would enter into
side agreements.They didn't trust the assignment mecha
nism. and they would say. well, we don't know what the
mechanism does, but if you're a hospital and I'm a doctor,
well. I 'd like to work with you and you'd like to have me,
so let's just forget the mechanism and have an arrange
ment on the side. And the mechanism was designed to
prevent this because they wanted a system in which there
would never be a situation where if I'm assigned to a hos
pital. I would actually prefer another hospital and that
hospital would also prefer me because then I would rather
make a side arrangement.
Sd this kind of a stability property was deemed to be
very important for this kind of mechanism, and the cur
rent housing Draw has that kind of a property.That means
that it will never happen that I'm assigned to a particular
residence, but there's another residence for which I actu
ally would have the right to get into and would prefer, but
I'm not assigned there.
Of course, the Stanford housing Draw's also not
mandatory participation, but there is no danger for stu
dents to enter side arrangements with dorms because the
dorms are only allowed to accept students via this process,
whereas the hospitals can do whatever they like. So that's
a case where I think the situation with this hospital match
ing program and the Stanford Draw — they're just differ
ent situations, and we need to see whether the important
considerations with the hospitals are also issues with the
housing Draw.
TSD: What specific things could the University be
thinking about changing, depending 011 discussions?
MP: One of the things that was already mentioned in
the article that got me interested in this was the question
of the importance of seniority in housing assignment. We
might say maybe we just make it probabilistically more
likely that seniors will get better Draw numbers than
sophomores or something like that.
A related idea would be to somehow compensate peo
ple for bad Draw numbers. You might say. if I got a bad
Draw number for my sophomore year, then I'm going to

he more likely to get a good Draw number my junior year.
TSl):That would make it much less transparent, I feel.
MP: Yeah, right.so then you're going to have a trade
off. The problem with the lottery system is that it is, of
course, fair in the long run, but since you're only here
three years, there isn't much of a long run. So somehow
weighing the lottery in a different way would be an op
tion.
And another thing I think really needs to be consid
ered is this issue of allowing students to list more than just
eight choices, so that's another element of what I call
strategizing. If you're limited to eight choices, you really
need to think, what's my Draw number? And given your
Draw number you will only select a particular window of
your overall preferences.
And a very important issue 1 think is. what do we give
people to choose from? 1 still think that students really
care not so much about the residences but whether they
have a single or a double. But that's not what we let them
choose among. At the moment we let them choose resi
dences, so then what often happens is, they're thinking,
what residences will make it likely for me to get a single?
All that depends on what the in-house draw is, so there's
a lot of thinking ahead that goes on on the side of the stu
dents. which you might forego if you said, well, let's just
have students choose rooms immediately. That's a system
that Princeton, for example, has.
But here again there's a value discussion — do we
want that as a University? Maybe if you talk to alumni
they look back they think, well you know at the time I re
ally liked that single, but what really mattered afterwards
was the fact that I lived in Casa Zapata or something. So if
that's what it is, then maybe we should hammer that into
the heads of the students and say, you know, yes we under
stand you care about singles, but it's not what should mat
ter to you.
TSI): Do you have any advice for students currently
going through the Draw?
MP: Well, I was an undergraduate here as well, so 1 was
in FloMo my freshman year,and then I was in Castano my
sophomore year and Kairos my junior and senior years.
And the best year 1 had was when 1 lived in a double in
Kairos, so certainly the single or not single in the end did
n't matter. Living in a co-op was really nice, with the com
munity atmosphere, and 1 really liked this idea of a small
dorm. And back then. I drew into Kairos unpreferred. So
Draw numbers can change, and when giving the eight
preferences, one shouldn't be guided too much by what
the Draw numbers were last year because they may
change.

Say you're assigned to Terra and I'm assigned to Kairos,
and 1 actually prefer your residence and you prefer mine.
'ITien we would really like to switch assignments, and ide
ally that shouldn't be possible.
Another thing that 1 think students worry a lot about
is strategizing — so you want a mechanism where it's not
advantageous to just lie about what your preferences
are. So a mechanism that induces honesty from the stu
dents is certainly something that's desirable. And the
current mechanism does that to some extent, but there
are other issues. Like, since you can only list eight pref
erences, what preferences are you going to list? Well,
that will depend on what Draw number you get, what
houses drew in the previous years — so there are other
elements of strategizing that haven't been discussed in
the formal literature yet.
So the strategizing issue, this kind of optimality in
which everyone is happiest with their current assignment,
those are some of the things that, in a discussion about

"The problem with the lottery system is that it is, of course, fair in
the long run, but since you're only here for three years,
there isn't much of a long run."
MARC PAULY,philosophy professor

what one would like, would certainly come up, and then
it's a question of, can we get everything that we want si
multaneously or not?
If you get rid of Draw groups and some other extra
hells and whistles, then the current system is based on
the Gale-Shapley algorithm. That algorithm has been
studied quite a lot in the literature because it's also been
used for assigning residents to hospitals — an intern
matching program. There's a national program where if
I want to be a doctor in residence at a hospital. I can list
my preferences, and the hospitals also list their prefer
ences for doctors. 'ITien the question is, how do you
match those two groups who both have preferences?
There's a national program that does that, and the way
that is done is also with this Gale-Shapley algorithm. So
what we do here,at the very basis, is something very sim
ilar.
TSI): Do you think it's possible to have a system that
would give us all of the things that we want?
MP: No — from the formal literature in social choice
we know that already very basic,simple requirements end
up being in conflict. So my expectation is that this will hap
pen here as well.
Hut 1 would still hope that we would have a discussion
as to how important we see each of these criteria to be. Be
cause some of the choices that are maybe made for this

hospital/doctor residence matching program — maybe
they're appropriate for that situation hut not for us, and
we should maybe make different choices.
TSD: What are some benefits and drawbacks to the
current system?
!\IP: It's certainly positive on the strategizing side, at
least in the sense that 1 don't think it's beneficial for stu
dents to lie about what their preferences are. On this opti
mally side, the current system is not what we call Pareto
optimal. There are algorithms that we know of that are
both strategy-proof and Pareto-optimal, but they have
other drawbacks, and then the discussion is, well, is it okay
to accept those other drawbacks?
TSI): What would these other drawbacks be?
MP: A drawback of another system would be a lack of
stability — let me explain it with the doctors and the resi
dences. What happened there was that a couple of
decades back, the people found out — before the system
was redone — that doctors and hospitals would enter into
side agreements.They didn't trust the assignment mecha
nism. and they would say. well, we don't know what the
mechanism does, but if you're a hospital and I'm a doctor,
well. I 'd like to work with you and you'd like to have me,
so let's just forget the mechanism and have an arrange
ment on the side. And the mechanism was designed to
prevent this because they wanted a system in which there
would never be a situation where if I'm assigned to a hos
pital. I would actually prefer another hospital and that
hospital would also prefer me because then I would rather
make a side arrangement.
Sd this kind of a stability property was deemed to be
very important for this kind of mechanism, and the cur
rent housing Draw has that kind of a property.That means
that it will never happen that I'm assigned to a particular
residence, but there's another residence for which I actu
ally would have the right to get into and would prefer, but
I'm not assigned there.
Of course, the Stanford housing Draw's also not
mandatory participation, but there is no danger for stu
dents to enter side arrangements with dorms because the
dorms are only allowed to accept students via this process,
whereas the hospitals can do whatever they like. So that's
a case where I think the situation with this hospital match
ing program and the Stanford Draw — they're just differ
ent situations, and we need to see whether the important
considerations with the hospitals are also issues with the
housing Draw.
TSD: What specific things could the University be
thinking about changing, depending 011 discussions?
MP: One of the things that was already mentioned in
the article that got me interested in this was the question
of the importance of seniority in housing assignment. We
might say maybe we just make it probabilistically more
likely that seniors will get better Draw numbers than
sophomores or something like that.
A related idea would be to somehow compensate peo
ple for bad Draw numbers. You might say. if I got a bad
Draw number for my sophomore year, then I'm going to

he more likely to get a good Draw number my junior year.
TSl):That would make it much less transparent, I feel.
MP: Yeah, right.so then you're going to have a trade
off. The problem with the lottery system is that it is, of
course, fair in the long run, but since you're only here
three years, there isn't much of a long run. So somehow
weighing the lottery in a different way would be an op
tion.
And another thing I think really needs to be consid
ered is this issue of allowing students to list more than just
eight choices, so that's another element of what I call
strategizing. If you're limited to eight choices, you really
need to think, what's my Draw number? And given your
Draw number you will only select a particular window of
your overall preferences.
And a very important issue 1 think is. what do we give
people to choose from? 1 still think that students really
care not so much about the residences but whether they
have a single or a double. But that's not what we let them
choose among. At the moment we let them choose resi
dences, so then what often happens is, they're thinking,
what residences will make it likely for me to get a single?
All that depends on what the in-house draw is, so there's
a lot of thinking ahead that goes on on the side of the stu
dents. which you might forego if you said, well, let's just
have students choose rooms immediately. That's a system
that Princeton, for example, has.
But here again there's a value discussion — do we
want that as a University? Maybe if you talk to alumni
they look back they think, well you know at the time I re
ally liked that single, but what really mattered afterwards
was the fact that I lived in Casa Zapata or something. So if
that's what it is, then maybe we should hammer that into
the heads of the students and say, you know, yes we under
stand you care about singles, but it's not what should mat
ter to you.
TSI): Do you have any advice for students currently
going through the Draw?
MP: Well, I was an undergraduate here as well, so 1 was
in FloMo my freshman year,and then I was in Castano my
sophomore year and Kairos my junior and senior years.
And the best year 1 had was when 1 lived in a double in
Kairos, so certainly the single or not single in the end did
n't matter. Living in a co-op was really nice, with the com
munity atmosphere, and 1 really liked this idea of a small
dorm. And back then. I drew into Kairos unpreferred. So
Draw numbers can change, and when giving the eight
preferences, one shouldn't be guided too much by what
the Draw numbers were last year because they may
change.

At 5 p.m. today, students will crowd around
residence offices and stand on their toes to get a
peek at their assigned Draw numbers. Those
who see low numbers will celebrate next year's
housing prospects; some who have repeatedly
received high numbers will resign themselves to
an unfavorable residence. Others will raise the
issue of fairness.
Once students have submitted their housing
preferences, what is the fairest way to decide who
should live where? And how does the current
Draw mechanism meet or fail to meet various
criteria for fairness ?
Philosophy Prof. Marc Pauly sat down with
The Daily in an attempt to answer these ques
tions. He called for a University-wide discussion
about what students, alumni and administrators
value regarding their residential experiences.
The Stanford Daily: Given what the current
Draw situation considers — preferences of res
idences. Draw group size, priorities, and gender
— what makes a fair or optimal assignment?
Mart- Pauly: 1 actually don't know what a fair or opti
mal assignment is. That's the question that we as a Uni
versity should be discussing 'ITie Draw is something
that's already decades old. and I think from the very be
ginning when it was implemented it was never really put
to the University community, you know: what do we
think actually is a fair assignment? What are the things
that we care about? I think that's the kind of value-ori
ented discussion that we still need to have, and then
based on that we should just go with what we think are
criteria of fairness.
It's clear that there are a couple of things that immedi
ately come to mind that one would consider desirable.
One is that you would want an assignment sueh that there
are no two people who would like to exchange residences.
