# PAGE TWO PRESENTS:
## Draw-ing the short straw The
						Daily discusses fairness with Philosophy Prof. Marc Pauly 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
At 5 p.m. today, students will crowd around
residence offices and stand on their toes to get a
peek at their assigned Draw numbers. Those
who see low numbers will celebrate next year's
housing prospects; some who have repeatedly
received high numbers will resign themselves to
an unfavorable residence. Others will raise the
issue of fairness.
Once students have submitted their housing
preferences, what is the fairest way to decide who
should live where? And how does the current
Draw mechanism meet or fail to meet various
criteria for fairness ?
Philosophy Prof. Marc Pauly sat down with
The Daily in an attempt to answer these ques
tions. He called for a University-wide discussion
about what students, alumni and administrators
value regarding their residential experiences.
The Stanford Daily: Given what the current
Draw situation considers — preferences of res
idences. Draw group size, priorities, and gender
— what makes a fair or optimal assignment?
