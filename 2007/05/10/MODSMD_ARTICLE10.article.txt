"The task force on fraternities and
sororities issued a statement yesterday
saying that fraternities and University
housing policies don't mix.
"There is a strong sentiment that
subjective selectivity and University
housing are incompatible and the task
force is considering alternatives to the
current situation, according to a state
ment released last night.
"The statement said the task force is
"still questioning the place of the subjec

location ol resources to such groups."
rhe task force will not make a more
specific recommendation until it hears
