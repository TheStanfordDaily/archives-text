Churches in five big U.S. cities plan to protect
illegal immigrants from deportation, offering
their buildings as sanctuary if need be, as they
pressure lawmakers to create a path to citi
zenship for the nation's estimated 12 million
illegal immigrants.
On Wednesday, a Catholic church in Los
Angeles and a Lutheran church in North I lol
lywood each sheltered one person, and
churches in other cities plan to do so in com
ing months as part of the "New Sanctuary
Movement."
"We want to put a human face to very
complex immigration laws and awaken the
consciousness of the human spirit," said Fa
ther Richard Estrada of Our Lady Queen of
Angels Catholic Church in Los Angeles.
Organizers said churches in more than 50
cities nationwide were planning to join the

sanctuary effort.They don't believe immigra
tion agents will make arrests inside the
churches.
The US. Immigration and Customs En
forcement agency has not tried to arrest Elvi
ra Arellano, an illegal immigrant who has
taken shelter at a Methodist church in Chica
go since August. Her son is a U.S. citizen and
he has lobbied in the Mexican legislature on
behalf of families that would be split if par
ents are deported.
ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice declined
to say whether agents would attempt to arrest
others who take sanctuary in churches, al
though she noted agents had the authority to
arrest anyone violating immigration law.
Anti-illegal-immigration groups called the
sanctuary effort misguided.
The faith groups "don't seem to realize
that they are being charitable with someone
else's resources, and that's not charity," said

Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, which favors limits on
immigration.
"We {Ire talking about illegal immigrants
taking someone else's job, filling up the class
room of someone else's child." he said.
The sanctuary effort is loosely based on a
movement in the 1980s, when churches har
bored Central American refugees fleeing
wars in their home countries. Organizers of
the current movement include members of
the Jewish. Muslim, Catholic and other
faiths.
Participating churches in San Diego. Seat
tle. Chicago and New York won't initially
house illegal immigrants. Instead, leaders will
provide legal counsel, accompany them to
court hearings and prepare plans to house
them in churches if authorities try to deport
them.
Hie plans come as immigration reform

legislation has been stalled since last summer,
and tens of thousands of illegal immigrants
have been detained and deported in stepped
up immigration raids in recent months.
At Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic
Church in downtown Los Angeles on
Wednesday, more than 30 priests, pastors,
imams and rabbis blessed two illegal immi
grants during a raucous ceremony attended
by 300 people.
A Mexican man will be sheltered at the
church, and another from Guatemala will be
housed at San Pablo's Lutheran Church in
North Hollywood.
The Guatemalan, a gardener who only
gave his lirst name as Juan, said he worried
about what might happen to his young daugh
ters it he was deported. Both girls are U.S. cit
izens because they were born in the U.S.
"1 want to ask the politicians to see the suf
fering of the immigrant families." he said.
