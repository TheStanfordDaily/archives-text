## Former Zambian president convicted of embezzling $46 million 
### PETER DURNING 
The former president of the
southern African state of Zambia
was found guilty on Friday of steal
ing vast amounts of public funds
while in office. Frederick Chiluba,
the country's first democratically
elected leader, was head of state
from 1991 to 2001. The British court
harshly condemned Mr. Chiluba,
saying that the former president
"had the benefit of this largesse at
the expense of the people of Zam
bia" at "a time when the vast major
ity ot Zambians were struggling to
live on one dollar a day and could
not afford more than one meal a
day."
While the Zambian president's
total salary for his ten years of office
was only $105,000. Mr. Chiluba em
bezzled a total of $46 million. Much
of the money was spent on the
leader's personal wardrobe, includ
ing a reported $1.2 million spent in a
single Swiss clothing and jewelry
boutique. Mr. Chiluba was tried in
Great Britain by the High Court of
London along with 19 deputies from
his term ot ottice because, according
to the Zambian attorney general's
office, much of the money that he
stole w;is laundered in the United
Kingdom.
Ibc verdict brings to a close the
latest chapter in Mr. Chiluba's case.
Though he originally possessed legal
immunity from prosecution, it was
removed by the legislature in a deci
sion upheld in February 2003 by the
Zambian Supreme Court. At the
time. Mr. C hiluba and his supporters
believed the courts would endorse
their appeal and grant them immuni
ty from corruption charges. When
the appeal failed. Mr. Chiluba was ar
rested and a long process of case
building began, shifting back and
forth from Lusaka to London, de

pending on the state of the evidence
and the political atmosphere in Zam
bia.
ITie Republic of Zambia, formed
from the territory of Northern
Rhodesia, gained its independence
in !%4 when it separated from what
eventually became the nation of
Zimbabwe. The Victoria Falls, one
of Africa's most famous landmarks,
is shared between the two states
today. Ruled by a single party for
nearly 30 years. Zambia began a
democratic period with Mr. Chilu
ba's 1991 election victory. But the
standards of his reelection in 1996
were questioned by international
observers, and his term in office, as
Friday's verdict illustrates, was char
acterized by extreme government
corruption in the face of his nation's
great poverty.
Mr. Chiluba tried to change the
constitution so that he could run for
a third term in 2001, but he failed and
instead endorsed the current presi
dent, Levy Mwanawasa. who was re
elected in 2006. Contrary to many
expectations at the time, Mr.
Mwanawasa has been far from a
faithful puppet of the outgoing
Chiluba government and has instead
made anti-corruption a priority of his
rule.
Regarding the corruption
charges against the former head of
state. President Mwanawasa has said
in the past that he would give Mr.
Chiluba a presidential pardon if he
admitted to the crimes and paid
back 75 percent of the fraudulently
obtained wealth. At this point, how
ever, the British government will
probably seize Mr. Chiluba s assets
in the event that he does not comply
with the court's order to repay 85
percent of the stolen sum within 14
days.
