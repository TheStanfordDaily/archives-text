## Editorial Board Beyond Browne 
### 
I n the latest scandal to hit British
tabloids. BP's CEO John Browne
.stepped down last week under alle
gations that he may have lied to investi
gators in an attempt to cover up a love
affair with another man. The press
missed the point. Lord Browne of Mad
ingley, as he is formally known, was
never found guilty of any wrongdoing,
and more than that, the recent flurry of
media attention overshadowed the story
of this man's struggle to act responsibly
and prevent climate change at one of the
world's largest oil companies.
Browne, a Stanford GSB alum, had
planned to resign in mid-June from the
top post at BP. Two weeks ago Browne
stopped by campus to deliver a speech
outlining his vision for preventing cli
mate change. We were impressed with
what Browne had to say. Browne de
scribed how. under his leadership, BP
has invested heavily in renewable ener
gy sources and funded half a billion dol
lars to research biofuels at Lawrence
Berkeley Labs. Browne implemented
an internal cap-and-trade system that
reduced BP's carbon dioxide emissions
and he called for the creation of a new
International Climate Change regulato
ry agency that would enforce a similar
system to limit carbon emissions world
wide. Finally. Browne was behind BP's
recent brand name change from
"British Petroleum" to "Beyond Petro
leum."
Some have argued that when oil
companies paint themselves green, as

HP has attempted, they do the world a
disservice and merely dupe consumers
in a giant publicity stunt. Others have
encouraged universities, including
Stanford, to refuse research money
from oil companies and thus divorce
themselves from this supposedly insidi
ous endeavor. We strongly disagree. In a
time when funding opportunities for re
newable energy alternatives are hard to
find and few in the government are talk
ing seriously about climate change, we
welcome anyone willing to talk about
the issue and provide money and action
to back it up. Climate change is too ur
gent of a problem to wait, and today's
publicity stunt may become tomorrow's
norm. We see no problem with raising
the public's expectations for clean and
environmentally friendly energy.
It would be foolish to think that
Browne transformed BP from a dirty oil
company to a progressive, renewable,
squeaky-clean energy source. On the
contrary, BP has a dismal environmental
record — critics jokingly refer to the
company as "Broken Pipe" after its
many damaging oil leaks. Moreover, ru
mors suggest that Browne was pushed
out because some shareholders didn't
find his clean energy initiatives prof
itable enough. Even so. Browne deserves
praise for demonstrating in a very public
way that even oil companies can. and
must, play an active role in curbing emis
sions and fighting climate change. Hope
-1111 ly his efforts won't be buried behind
the latest scandal.
