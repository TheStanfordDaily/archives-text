# Am I in high school again?
## 
### 
Did you hear Jessie got into UCSF
med school? James is going to
Yale Law — of course he would
get in.
Spring is the time when blossoms rain
from the heavens along Mayfield Ave.,
bikini-clad co-eds gratuitously tan in
public spaces, and showy shirtless foot
ball players act overly macho. It is also
when "What are you doing next year?"
begins to bear the weight of judgment
and critique, future plans are revealed,
and once again top universities become a
brand of self-worth.
Cue flashback to senior year of high
school. As our four-year romp in the Le-
Land-o-Plenty draws to a dramatic
close, it seems that I have turned into
Michael J.. Marty McFlying myself fours
years back to those days of brown
paper-bagged textbooks, jerky driving,
acne, tsunami-soggy French kisses and
free education. It truly seems as if I've
gone back to the future. We cram for
standardized tests, puff up our resumes,
apply to school, and then judge our ac
quaintances and friends by their stuffed
(or not-so-stuffed) mailboxes. We be
come acutely nostalgic about the im
pending dissemination of our friend
group, and persistently swear to make
the best out of this last month we have
together. From "make the best." our vo
cabulary snowballs into one large lexi
con of entirely vague, romantic abstrac
tions: we leave "forever changed."
"ready to make a difference." and "ea
gerly awaiting our next journey."
We take buddy pictures for the year
book. donate to the elass gift fund and
take the bus to senior formal. Who knew
I would end up nervously asking some
one to a dance, four years after I thought
the last one of my life was out of the
way? Soon, our families will gather, we'll
get weepy, hear generalized truths from
a moderately-famous speaker about the
subject of life and possibly how we are
the hope for the future, ft seems like I
have done it all before.
I am as sentimental as the next, and
there is no way I am not dancing my lit
tle heart out at my (last?) formal, or do
nating my $20.07 to the class of *07. All
these eerie similarities, however, leave
me to wonder — have things changed at
all? Rory. Dawson and Screech all re
mained about the same when Gilmore
Girls. Dawson's Creek and Saved by the
Hell tackled the college years. As this
graduation unexpectedly parallels the
last one more and more, it seems that, for
once.TV got it right. I, too, am trapped in
a too-long-running TV series — my plot
material has been recycled.
In so many ways things are about the
same as they were in high school: I still
wonder who this Katie Taylor is. I am

constantly stumbling upon and redefin
ing my interests. I assumed my life-call
ing would naturally reveal itself to me in
a timely and obvious fashion — one
higher education later, and I am still left
wondering what in fact I would like to do
professionally. Google? Grad school?
Adventure? What if 1 never find the one
thing that is meant for me? And are we
so sure there is only one?
Although, remarkably, 1 feel the
same sense of confusion about my life. 1
still thought some things would be dif
ferent this time around. As college grad
uation looms, however. I can't help but
get a potent sense of deja vu. All the she
got-ins. lie-got ins leave me to think we
are just as preoccupied with name
recognition as we naively were four
years prior. Our pre-grad obsession with
post-grad plans has slowly spiraled into
a Ph.D.-M.D.-J.D. or bust creed that
leaves me anxious, heavy-hearted, and
annoyed. Jessie is not a genius because
she is going to UCSF. James isn't bril
liant because lie got into Yale. They are
hard-working, dedicated, intelligent stu
dents for whom more schooling was the
right decision. College was an obvious
step for most of us. but now. when there
is no longer an unambiguous path to
take, labeling our friends by their grad
school both oversimplifies their
achievements and falsely links their
merit to their post-grad plans.
In any case, all of these stories of elite
schools are strikingly similar to gam
bling tales. You hear only about Study
McSmart's med school acceptance, just
as you only seem to hear how much your
old roommate won in Vegas — no one
mentions the multiple rejection letters
or the net hundred dollar loss from play
ing slots in the Luxor lobby.
I bet a vast majority of us will do
something intriguing, wonderful, and im
portant. whether we already have a job
lined up or a grad school waiting. Until
then. I'll try to reassure myself things
have in fact changed (including myself)
during my four year stay at Stanford.
()h. hey, 1 heard your mom is taking us
dress-shopping at the mall, what time
should I be ready?
