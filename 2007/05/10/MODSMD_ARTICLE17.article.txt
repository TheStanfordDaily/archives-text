# Existentialist pizza
## 
### 
I was somewhere on the road in New Jer
sey delivering pizzas when I began to
doubt my purpose in this world. 1
thought aloud how I may not be destined
for greatness, and time was running out to
change my life. Maybe 1 wouldn't be this
great novelist or world-renowned thinker.
Maybe I would write bad screenplays for
crappy superhero movies and only get in
vited to do spots on Jimmy Kimmel Live. I
could feel the large pepperoni and medium
cheese pizzas on the seat next to me cool
ing. much like the cheesy, fatty future I so
dreamed of.
Now. five years later, I once again am
questioning my purpose. Where am I?
Where am I going? If someone orders a
vegetarian and sausage pizza, does that
mean there's no God? Why does everyone
walk away when I ask these questions?
When such problems confront the human
mind, they think back to times of mental
clarity. That summer where 1 worked for a
pizza delivery service I felt more alive,
thought clearer, and felt life's bigger ques
tions confronting me. And that was not just
because the pizzeria had loose mob ties.
I think my crisis was triggered by some
thing benign. 1 knew 1 was having doubts
about going to college, leaving suburbia,
and my own future. I remember the staff
meeting the day I was informed that my en
tire existence was a lie. We were no longer
"pizza delivery boys" or "guys" or "men."
That's sexist, and diminutive. We were now
"culinary deliverance mechanisms," which
only made me more depressed. 1 wasn't a
boy: I was a tool.
Driving around, surrounded by strip
malls. I began to wonder if the world cared
for my higher purpose. When the
QuickChek girls made me sandwiches, did
they understand that they were not making
a sandwich for a mere delivery person, but
for a future success story? Would they see

that I was a person of destiny by how I gig
gled at the Maxim magazine covers by the
register'.' Would they know my greatness by
the way I ordered the number 5? What if I
asked for mayo on the side?
Then, a curious thing happened. While
making a delivery for twenty pizzas (a big
order). I found myself at a dead end. I was
at the address, but it did not exist. Or
rather, perhaps it did before and no longer
existed. ITiis poor woman, by the name of
"Amanda Fakename" was lost from this re
ality. As I stared at the brick wall with graf
fiti and trash cans. I thought to myself: this
could be me. 1 could be at this dead end.
forgotten and decorated with poorly
spelled expletives. The world could just
pave over me, forget I even existed. 1 re
jected the idea of "I order delivery, there
fore I am." I needed something more,
something certain.
Hut then it hit me. I raced back to my car
and watched as the hoodlums made off
with my pizzas. I realized that while I could
count on my existence and my values, only
trusting that the world existed wasn't
enough. I lost my pizzas, but I gained a
valuable lesson about the world's different
system of beliefs. Rather, if I ignored the
rules of others, and refused to acknowledge
their differing consciousness, my boss was
totally going to kick my ass for losing so
many pizzas.
1 turned to my co-workers for support.

How did (hey continue to exist, thinking
their lives were important, when clearly
theirs were not as important as mine? Ini
tially. they did not help. 1 believe it was he
cause they did not speak English very well.
Eventually, John, who I guess is Juan in his
native language, explained that while exis
tence itsell might be meaningless, he gets
by with the thought that someday, far in the
future, when he delivers a pizza.it will be to
a stripper. She will sleep with him and give
him a 30% tip, and they would live happily
ever after. He also told me he was Italian,
not Mexican, and I was an idiot.
I took Juan's advice to heart. I too
sought my own meaning, my own reason to
exist. It would probably not involve strip
pers from the turnpike, though. So I went
to college. I realized that people can con
tinually look for meaning in their lives and
hope that their existence will carry on even
after the mafia has done a very good job of
chopping it into little bits and feeding it to
the geese. But that shouldn't stop me from
living with what little time I have. You eat
the pepperoni pizza today even if you have
gas tomorrow. I believe it was Sartre who
said. "The pepperoni should not arrest
your existence."
When my boss told me that I should
look for other employment opportunities, I
knew what he meant. I was destined for
better things, and though I didn't know
what they were yet, I would find out soon. I
thanked him lor serving as a guiding force
in my resolution of an existential crisis.
I hough he would be destined to culinary
squalor, and possibly a creative death at
the end ot season 5.1 would soar high and
remember his name. Which, hopefully, will
come to me at any second.
