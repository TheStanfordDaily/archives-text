## Sizing up the West Regional Cardinal up against eight top-25 teams in NCAA first round 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
If you thought the Pacific-10 Conference
Championship field was tough, you haven't
seen what the No. 14 Stanford women's golf
team will face this weekend.
Starting today, the Cardinal matches up
against 21 squads at the 2007 NCAA West
Regional. Eight of those teams are ranked in
the top 25 of the latest Golf World/NGCA
Coaches Poll. In comparison, the perennial
ly strong Pac-10 boasts only five teams in the
same range.
Stanford is seeded sixth in the tourney,
and the recently crowned Pac-10 Champ,
top-ranked Arizona State, holds the No. 1
seed. The Sun Devils are accompanied by
No. 4 Pepperdine, No. 7 Florida, No. 11 Ok
lahoma State, No. IN New Mexico, No. 20
Denver and the host. No. 15 Brigham
Young.
However. Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor isn't very concerned with the
strength of the Cardinal's opponents.
"In this tourney, our competitor is really
the golf course," O'Connor said. "It's a dif
ferent type of golf because you're not going
head-to-head against the different teams.
You're just going head-to-head against the
course, and our focus right now is managing
ourselves out there."
Even if it were a head-to-head deal, the
Card would be well prepared. Pac-10 oppo
nents in the field include ASU, California
and Washington State, and each has tested
the Cardinal many times this season.
"We play in the most competitive confer
ence in the country," O'Connor said. "The
schedule that we play is one of the most dif
ficult in the country."
Three top individuals from across the
West will also the join the regional field, in
cluding Kay Hoey of Long Beach State. Jen
nifer Shipley of Fresno State and Lehua
Wise of New Mexico State.
The regional is at the par-71, 6,234-yard
Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club in
St. George. Utah. A total of 18 holes will be
played over a span of three days. As O'Con
nor mentioned, the course will be Stanford's
main opponent.
"It's pretty much a target golf course,"
O'Connor said. "If you're not in control of
your ball out there, you can certainly end out

in the lava rocks or out in the desert. You've
got to know your target golf tees and
yardages."
"Our goal is to just break par," she added.
"The trouble here lies in different spots. Our
focus is hitting our targets and moving the
ball from point A to point B."
The top eight squads and top two individ
uals from the West will advance to the 2(X)7
NCAA Division I Women's Golf Champi
onships, May 22-25 at the LPGA Interna
tional Golf Course in Dayton Beach, Fla.
This year's appearance at the regional
marks Stanford's 15th consecutive selection
since the 1993 season. Last year. Stanford
finished fourth at the Regional, led by then
freshman Mari Chun, who tied for 13th indi
vidually.
The Cardinal eventually finished 13th at
the NCAA Championships, with Duke tak
ing home the team title. At the Champi
onships, then-junior Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana paced the Cardinal attack, tying
for lbth individually â€” the best NCAA fin
ish of her collegiate career.
This year, the Cardinal boasts an intimi
dating lineup of youth and experience. That
experience is a by-product of two longtime
leaders, seniors Lauren Todd and
Tangtiphaiboontana.
"They've been very solid and steady for
us all year," O'Connor said. "Jennie and
Lauren have been such strong emotional
leaders and tremendous captains for the
team."
Meanwhile, the youthful element is pro
vided by freshmen Catherina Wang and An
gela King.
Sandwiched in the middle is perhaps
Stanford's strongest golfer. Mari Chun. The
sophomore leads the squad with a team-low
73.6 stroke average per round. She also
holds seven top-25 and five top-10 finishes
this season.
Chun's accolades include a first-place
finish at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational,
second at the PING/ASU Invite,third at the
Topy Cup and third at the Pac-10 Champi
onships.
"Mari's had an outstanding year as well,"
O'Connor said. "Those three [Todd,
Tangtiphaiboontana and Chun] will be lead
ing the way."
Recently, the trio was named to the All-
Pac-10 Second Team.

GAME NOTES: Twenty-one teams each were se
lected to compete in the three NCAA regionals.
Stanford will be up against eight top-25 teams
at this weekend's West Regional. The top eight
teams will advance to the 2007 NCAA Division
I Championships in Florida. Stanford is seeded
sixth behind top-ranked Arizona State, Pepper
dine, Florida, Oklahoma State and Brigham
Young. This is Stanford's 1 6th straight appear
ance at the regional.

"Being in the top crop of players in our
conference says a lot about your abilities,"
O'Connor said. "I'm very pleased with their
performances year round."
"My expectation is for them to continue
their spectacular play and to lead us through
this tournament," she added.
At the moment, things appear in the Car
dinal's favor, according to O'Connor.
"We have had a positive energy this en
tire week," she said. "'Hie Pac-10 Champi
onships exposed our weaknesses, and
we've learned a lot about ourselves and the
team from that event. We've worked hard
the last 10 days or so working on our
game."
Judging from today's practice round, the
Card looks to advance yet again to the
NCAA Championships.
"We've had a fantastic round of practice
today," O'Connor said."Everyone was strik
ing the ball well.our putting was really good.
The energy is definitely good right now."
