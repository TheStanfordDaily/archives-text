# Pitching concerns arise against Oregon
## Penna struggles as Card turns to final three games 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford soft ball team has a
chance to pull its conference record up to .500
in this week's season finale, beginning with a
match-up against No. 20 Oregon this evening,
followed by No. l l ) Oregon State on Friday
and Saturday.
The Cardinal (33-16-1, 7-10-1 Pacific-10
Conference) would need to sweep the week
against the Oregon schools to finish with an
even Pac-10 record for 2007.
Although the offense re-emerged after a
trying 2K-inning scoreless streak against Ari
zona and Washington over the past few weeks,
the pitching brilliant two weeks ago against
Arizona St;ite and Arizona — has come back
into question the last few days.
Ihe Cardinal's staff ace, sophomore
righthander Missy Penna (23-9), was lifted
from Stanford s non-conference game against
IJ( -Davison I uesday after walking four bat
ters and hitting another through just 1 1/3 in
nings.
Wild pitching also haunted Penna against
Washington, and in Saturday's game against
IJC LA. In 10 innings of work against the two
clubs. Penna hit five batters, walked eight
more and threw three wild pitches.
Penna is certainly capable of brilliant pitch
ing. though, and she showed that just last Sun
day with a complete-game three-hitter to beat
UCLA. Junior righthander Becky McCul
lough (10-7) has also shown that she can turn
it on in the clutch, after coming in to put out
the fire and get the win against Davis earlier
this week.
But pitching is one issue the Cardinal
would rather not have going into the week
end. Stanford has won precious few blowouts
this year and has often relied on Penna to
carry the team.
If more potent offense is needed to pick up
the slack, then Stanford might be heating up at
just the right time after jumping all over
Davis's pitching for 11 runs two days ago.
Junior third baseman Michelle Smith's two
homers against the Aggies were the club's first
since Apr. 1 Freshman center fielder Alissa
Haber, the team batting leader at .366, is also
settling back into her groove, batting behind

GAME NOTES: Stanford, with a record of 36-16-
1 overall and 7-10-1 in the Pac-10, heads into
its final weekend of regular-season play. The
Cardinal closes the regular season with three
games against Pac-1 0 opponents. Oregon
took one of two in the teams' last meeting.
Oregon State defeated Stanford 2-1 on Mar.
30 in Corvallis, Ore. Three wins this weekend
would not only mean a .500 record in the Pac
-10, but it could also move Stanford closer to
ward securing a 1 Oth straight invitation to the
NCAA Championships.

Smith. I laber has gone 7-for-8 in her first two
games at the three-spot.
Oregon (40-16,5-13 Pac-10) is the bottom
dweller of the conference, but the .714 team
split with the Cardinal up north during March,
beating Stanford 8-0 in the first game and los
ing 15-4 in the second.
Freshman Jennifer Sailing leads a high
powered Oregon offense that collectively bats
.309. Sailing is hitting .4% with 12 home runs
and 65 RBIs — tied for tops in the Pac-10 —
on the year. Sari-Jane Jenkins is also in the top
eight in league batting (.372) and has the most
doubles (16) of any player in the conference.
Righthanded junior Alicia Cook leads the
Ducks from the mound with a 19-3 record and
a 1.92 ERA, although it was Melissa Rice who

took both the win and the loss against the Car
dinal earlier this season.
This is the final home weekend in the ca
reers of two Stanford players: left fielder Jack-

Ie Rinehart and shortstop I.indsey Key.They
will he recognized on Saturday's Senior Day.
