# Piot gives grim AIDS appraisal
## UNAIDS director tabulates the tragedy's toll as HIV spreads through the developing world 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
"We are still in the middle of a cri
sis." Executive Director of UNAIDS
Peter Piot told a crowd of about 200
people in Kresge Auditorium last
night. "Eight thousand people are
dying every single day from AIDS."
And unless the virus is brought
under control, he said, many devel
oping countries can forget about
their futures altogether.
In remarks punctuated with sta
tistics, the United Nations'AlDS tsar
gave a sobering perspective on the
fight against HIV/AIDS sprinkled
with a few encouraging signs for the
future.
AIDS, according to estimates he
provided, is the fourth leading cause
of death in the world, and the first
among people ages 15-50. There are
12 million AIDS orphans in Africa
alone.
The global health expert argued
that the IIIV/AIDS epidemic should
be included in the same breath as cli
mate change, mass poverty and nu
clear war—issues which capture the
public's attention.
"The truth is that after 25.26 years
since AIDS was discovered, the end
of this epidemic is nowhere in sight,"
he said. "This is not a short-lived phe
nomenon. We didn't think in the long
run because there was a crisis on our
hands. We need young people in the
fight against AIDS because it is not
going to be over tomorrow."
Roughly 65 million people have

been infeeted sinee 1981. The epi
demic originated in eastern and
southern Africa, hut the virus has
permeated the globe.
"There are countries in southern
Africa where 30 to 40 percent of the
adults are HIV-positive," Piot said.
"Just imagine what that would be in
California — 10, 20 million people
living with HIV."
Numbers like these are especially
devastating in poor countries with
failing health systems, Piot said. He
also noted that the epidemic is
spreading alarmingly quickly in the
former Soviet Union and India.
What started as a disease associat
ed with middle-class gay men is now
a universal problem. Women are in
fected five or six times as often as
men,according to UN estimates.
HIV/AIDS has a devastating im
pact on society as well as the humans
it afflicts.
"AIDS does to society what HIV
does to the human body — it weak
ens the immune system just as it
weakens the resiliency in a society,"
he said. "It weakens the ability to
cope and to deal with difficult
things."
1 le added that as an exceptional
disease,AlDS requires an exception
al response.
"There is enormous stigma and
discrimination attached to the dis
ease. and that's what makes it so
unique," Piot said."lt's about sex and
drugs; that's what makes it so diffi
