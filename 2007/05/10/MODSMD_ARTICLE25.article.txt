# Men's crew focuses on "the big race"
## Cardinal races against Cal and Washington in Pac-10s 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's crew enters the final leg of
its season this weekend, facing its season
long top rivals No. 1 Washington and No. 3
California at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships this Sunday.
" ITiis is it — this is the big race," said sen
ior Donny Simkin, a member of the men's
varsity eight. "There's no race after this race,
as far as we're concerned right now. We've
been working toward this all season; May 13
has been the date all along, and we've been
focused on it. We're understandably excit
ed."
Stanford rowing has developed quickly
over the past few years, and after taking sec
ond in the varsity eight and third in the sec
ond varsity eight last year, this weekend
could finally give it the Pac-10 Champi
onship.
California snatched gold from last year's

Cardinal varsity eight. The cross-bay rivals
have again proven a challenge for Stanford in
this season, defeating the Cardinal in a sec
ond straight Big Row on Apr. 21.Then-N0.4
Stanford faltered against then-No. 2 Cal. and
didn't win any of its races.
The men's varsity eight was even with the
Cal boat at the 1,100-meter mark (out of
2,000), but the Bears pulled out a win by 3.3
seconds (5:50.3 against 5:53.6) on Stanford's
regular practice course, the Redwood Shores
Lagoon.
The men's second varsity eight and fresh
man eight also lost, each by margins of six
seconds or more.
Stanford did upset the Bears earlier this
season, when it hosted the Windermere Clas
sic. At No. 2. the Cardinal then outranked
California, and overcame the Bears and No.
8 Wisconsin to advance to the final.
Racing for the Windermere title, Stanford
met its greatest challenge of the weekend as
well as its greatest challenge this Sunday: top
ranked Washington.
The undefeated Huskies defeated the
men's varsity eight by 6.1 seconds at Winder
mere and also left the second varsity and
novice teams to silver, sweeping all six of

their finals among the men's and women's
events.
With that kind of experience and reputa
tion preceding both Washington and Cal.
Simkin acknowledges that this weekend will
be full of challenges.
"We know they're fast." he said. "Wash
ington is undefeated and they're dominant.
Cal is also very fast."
A different format will add to the compet
itive element at the Pac-10 Championships.
Rather than the usual dual format, as at the
Windermere and Big Row, there will be six
lanes for the Pac-10.
"It's going to require a different strategy
with the wide, six-lane race," Simkin said.
"It's a lot harder to psychologically break a
team when they have someone else right next
to them that they can look at. race against
and eventually catch up with."
Those prospects have forced the Cardinal
to develop a "championship race plan." ac
cording to Simkin. that goes with many in
tense weeks of practice leading up to the Pac
-10.
The No. 3 Bears and No. 1 Huskies are
both daunting forces within the conference
and nationally, but No. 6 Stanford expects to

he right up there with them, regardless of
what the coaches in charge of rankings be
lieve.
"We fully expect to he up and down a seat
with them." Simkin said."We're confident that
this is going to come down to less than half a
boat length — it's going to be a close one.
"We're confident in ourselves, we're con
fident in our speed, but we're also confident
in the speed of our competitors." he added.
The Pac-10 Championships will also fea
ture No. 18 Oregon State and Washington
State, each of which the Cardinal beat two
weekends ago in Eugene, Ore.
Nevertheless, Simkin said that on Sunday,
"It's going to be anybody's race."
"Undoubtedly, unquestionably, this is the
fastest set of Pac-10 teams there has ever
been, and the greatest depth there has ever
been among all the teams," he added.
In the end. the Pac-10 title will wind up in
the hands of the crew that comes best-pre
pared for the day's races, beginning at 8 a.m.
But even on Sunday afternoon, it won't be
the end of the rowing season for many Pac-10
teams. The IRA Regatta is a month away,

tion preceding both Washington and Cal.
Simkin acknowledges that this weekend will
be full of challenges.
"We know they're fast." he said. "Wash
ington is undefeated and they're dominant.
Cal is also very fast."
A different format will add to the compet
itive element at the Pac-10 Championships.
Rather than the usual dual format, as at the
Windermere and Big Row, there will be six
lanes for the Pac-10.
"It's going to require a different strategy
with the wide, six-lane race," Simkin said.
"It's a lot harder to psychologically break a
team when they have someone else right next
to them that they can look at. race against
and eventually catch up with."
Those prospects have forced the Cardinal
to develop a "championship race plan." ac
cording to Simkin. that goes with many in
tense weeks of practice leading up to the Pac
-10.
The No. 3 Bears and No. 1 Huskies are
both daunting forces within the conference
and nationally, but No. 6 Stanford expects to

what the coaches in charge of rankings be

"We fully expect to he up and down a seat
with them." Simkin said."We're confident that
this is going to come down to less than half a
boat length — it's going to be a close one.
"We're confident in ourselves, we're con
fident in our speed, but we're also confident
in the speed of our competitors." he added.
The Pac-10 Championships will also fea

State, each of which the Cardinal beat two
weekends ago in Eugene, Ore.
Nevertheless, Simkin said that on Sunday,
"It's going to be anybody's race."
"Undoubtedly, unquestionably, this is the
fastest set of Pac-10 teams there has ever
been, and the greatest depth there has ever
been among all the teams," he added.
In the end. the Pac-10 title will wind up in
the hands of the crew that comes best-pre
pared for the day's races, beginning at 8 a.m.
But even on Sunday afternoon, it won't be
the end of the rowing season for many Pac-10
teams. The IRA Regatta is a month away,
