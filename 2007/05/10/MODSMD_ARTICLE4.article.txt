## GSC awash in leftover cash Newly-sworn in council puts off decision on how to spend reserves 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Apparently, swimming in cash is not always the
most enviable situation to be in. especially when the
money belongs to someone else.
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) found itself
in that position last night as it heard GSC Financial
Officer Huan Robertson report that a sizeable
amount of the funds it had collected from graduate
students remained in the coffers, unused.
Of the $258,000 the GSC collected from the gradu
ate student general fee this academic year. $76,000 is
allocated for programming purposes initiated by the
GSC. So far. the council has tapped that funding
source for several purposes, including subsidizing the
( altrain Go-Pass program and funding the Interna
tional Foods Fx press, a Marguerite service to an inter
national food market in Cupertino.
According to Robertson, however, approximately
$10,000 of that money — which could be used tor sim
ilar purposes — remains unused.
"We've taken it from the (graduate) population to
use it as such." he said, "so we should make sure we
spend it."
Robertson added that refunding the excess money
to graduate students would not be the best solution,
since the refund would amount to little more than a
dollar per head.
Ibis is not the first year the GSC has collected
