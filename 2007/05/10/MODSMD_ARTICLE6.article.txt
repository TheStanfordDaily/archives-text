Sixty years ago. in a relatively lesser

desegregation order and showed a screen
ing of the Hmmy Award-winning documen
tary Mcndez Westminster: For All the
Children/Para Todos Los Ninos" in Trcsid
der Oak West.
The documentary focused on the events
surrounding the 1947 decision, which
prompted the desegregation of schools
throughout the Southwest.
"I'm Mexican American and its part of
my history." said Bernard Fraga '08. "My
grandfather was forced to go to Mexican
schools in Texas. To me. this is one of the
great untold stories about civil rights in this
nation."
