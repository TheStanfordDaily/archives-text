## Film narrates untold civil rights tale 60th anniversary of court ruling to integrate schools 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
Sixty years ago. in a relatively lesser
known but important chapter of the civil
rights movement, the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled that segregating Mexican
and Mexican-American students into sepa
rate schools from white students was un
constitutional.
Last night, the Center for Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity and I I Cen
tro Chicano sponsored a celebration of the
desegregation order and showed a screen
ing of the Hmmy Award-winning documen
tary Mcndez Westminster: For All the
Children/Para Todos Los Ninos" in Trcsid
der Oak West.
The documentary focused on the events
surrounding the 1947 decision, which
prompted the desegregation of schools
throughout the Southwest.
"I'm Mexican American and its part of
my history." said Bernard Fraga '08. "My
grandfather was forced to go to Mexican
schools in Texas. To me. this is one of the
great untold stories about civil rights in this
nation."
Beginning in 1919 with the es
tablishment of the first Mexican
only school in Orange County, seg
regation of Mexican students
spread throughout the Southwest.
Then, in 1947, a California farmer
named Gonzalo Mendez chal
lenged racial segregation in
schools and took the Westminster
School District to court after his
children were denied enrollment at
the white-only elementary school.
Sylvia Mendez. Gonzalo
Mendez's daughter, is now in her
seventies. She watched the film
again last night and answered
questions afterwards. She said she
is proud of the progress her parents
set in motion. She credited them

with helping to further the civil
rights movement. She said that
children are inherently good and
that social factors are responsible
for other forms of intolerance.
"Children are not born bigots."
she said. "They are not born with
hatred. It is instilled in them."
The film's producer. Sandra
Robbie, said she was inspired to
create the movie after growing up
in southern California.
"I was sitting on my mom's
counter [with the newspaper| read
ing about segregation that went on
just outside my house." said Rob
bie. who grew up in the Westmin
ster School District, unaware of the
area's past. "None of this was in the
history books. 1 knew this was a
story that my children had to know,
that all children had to know."
The Mendez ruling catalyzed a
flurry of civil rights activism across
the country. A year after the deci

sion, school districts nationwide
began to desegregate schools for
Asian-American and Native-
American students. Soon after
wards. California Governor Earl
Warren, who would later become
Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, signed into law a bill that
made California the first state to
effectively desegregate all of its
school districts. The decision creat
ed a precedent and laid the ground
work for the Brown vs. Board of
Education, which ordered schools
to desegregate with "all deliberate
speed."
Robbie emphasized the impor
tance of the Mendez case.
"The American civil rights
struggle is not just about blacks in
the South." she said. "It's about
each and every one of us."
