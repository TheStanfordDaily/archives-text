## SEEKING BLOOD Collection today, tomorrow part of Blood Center's expanded outreach effort 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By the time you finish reading this arti
cle, 30 people in the U.S. will have died in
need of blood, at a rate of 1 person every 2
seconds.
According to John Williams, the Donor
Recruitment Manager for Stanford Blood
Center, about 5 percent of the U.S. population
is eligible to donate blood do so. But in the re
gion surrounding Stanford, a mere 2 percent
of the eligible population donates. What about
on the Farm?
"Not enough," Williams said."Anecdotally,
we don't get as many donations as most other
colleges."
Blood drives occur almost monthly at
Stanford; they are usually held in resi
dences or at the Stanford Hospital, but stu
dents can donate any day at Stanford Hos
pital. Stanford's Blood Center supplies
more than 35,000 pints of blood a year to
hospitals.
The blood drives held this week —
today's at Governor's Corner in the Robin
son lounge, tomorrow's in Florence Moore
Hall — are part of an expansion of the Blood
Center's role. Though they used to only col
lect blood once or twice a year, they will be
holding seven different blood drives in the
next six months.

Tiffany Wang '10 is one such donor in the
growing blood donation campaign.
"After donating at the blood drive last
quarter, I wanted to make sure there was an
other blood drive in Governor's Corner," she
said. "It is so convenient for all the residents to
participate."
Donor recruitment has been far from easy.
Wang cited two main impediments to getting
more people to donate.
"A lot of people are uncomfortable with
the idea of having a needle inserted into
them "she said.
Another common reason given. Wang said,
is that "people don't have time."
But Wang and Williams both stressed that
blood donation required minimal time com
mitment.
"In reality," Wang said."the blood drive is
very last and somebody could donate right
after dinner for about half an hour."
But not everyone is eligible to donate.
Donors must meet a minumum weight thresh
old (minimum 110 pounds) and have a good
medical history.
After effects like fainting sometimes
occur.
"It's hard to say if it's psychological or
physical," Williams said."But the staff are very
sensitive to this."
