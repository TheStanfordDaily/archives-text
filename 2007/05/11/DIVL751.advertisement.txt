Organic materials suitable for composting represents up to 70% of materials
landfilled each year. Composting rather than landfilling organics reducing the pro
duction of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more efficient than carbon
dioxide at trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere. Plus, compost puts valuable
nutrients back into our soil. Organics currently represents 25% of what Stanford's
Recycling Program diverts from the landfill. Look for that number to grow as we
continue to expand food waste collection programs on campus.
