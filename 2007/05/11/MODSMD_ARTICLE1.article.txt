Cardinal Water Polo
Fight to the Finish
Polo out to capture first NCAA Championship title since '02
By WES MATEO
DESK EDITOR
Long before the Cardinal's loss to UCLA in the
conference tournament championship on Apr. 29,
an unsubstantiated rumor had gone around the
water polo community that the Bruins have a prac
tice routine they refer to as "Stanfords."
What exactly the drill entails seems shrouded in
mystery to everyone outside of the UCLA pro
gram. When asked, even members of the Stanford
squad are unsure — but they do have an idea.
Cardinal players described a furious sprint
nearly the entire length of the pool, culminating
with an abrupt stop just a few meters short of the
wall. The drill's name, therefore, constitutes what
Stanford senior goalie Meridith McColl character
ized as a "[mocking] poke at our inability to finish
the season."
And with another season coming to an end at
this weekend's NCAA Tournament in Los Alami
tos, Calif., eyes are on the Cardinal yet again, and
the possibility of their pulling another "Stanford."
"1 don't know the story [behind the routine] for
sure," McColl said, noting that her team hasn't won
an NCAA title since 2(X)2, despite fielding strong
teams every year. "Teams never expect Stanford to
finish at the end of the season. When the polls came
out at the beginning of the season, we had the best
players, hands-down. But we were still ranked
third, so we'd love to prove everyone wrong."
Senior two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
voiced a similar interpretation of UCLA's routine.
"Don't know if it's true or not. but 1 think that it
tries to say that that's how we play — we go all out
and then die at the very end," she said."But I real
ly don't know whether it's actually true."
Regardless of whether or not the rumor holds
any veracity, McColl said that the Cardinal has
used it as motivation through the season.
A wake-up call came for the women after they
were defeated by the Bruins two weeks ago in the
championship match of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament. After jumping out
to an early 5-0 lead, UCLA cruised to a 9-3 upset
over the top-seeded Cardinal, earning the Bruins
an automatic berth in this weekend's NCAA Tour
nament.

GONE TO THE DOGS
By BLAIR CRITCHLOW
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
In a baseball season fraught with disap
pointments, Stanford's conference record has
to be near the top of the list. Picked by the pre
season coaches' poll to finish third in the
standings, the Cardinal is winless in all six Pa
cific* 10 Conference series this season.
With only two series remaining in confer
ence, the opportunities for that elusive series
win are dwindling. Ibis weekend. Stanford
(19-24. 4-14 Pac-10) gets a shot to break the
streak at home against Washington (25-21,8-
7).
"I definitely don't want totakean'o-fer' for
my senior year." said the Cardinal's sole sen
ior. Ryan Seawell. "But we're not thinking
about the past. We're playing for pride right
now."
Stanford has recent history on its side with
six straight wins against the Huskies, dating
back to the 2005 season, but Washington
comes to the Bay Area with momentum. ITie
Huskies are winners of five of their last six
games. And the team recently got an emotion
al lift when it set a new Pac-10 attendance
record for a single game with 10.421 fans. Last
Friday's record-setting night was the first-ever
college baseball game played at Safeco Field,
home of the Seattle Mariners.
Known for their team athleticism, presea

fense. liague entered the season with a school
record .394 average and is currently riding a
16-game hitting streak — another Washington
record. Burgher provides a base stealing
threat for the 1 luskies. going a perfect 15-for
-15 in base-stealing attempts this year.
On the mound,reliever Nick I lagadone has
been the Huskies' most consistent pitcher,
notching a 1.99 ERA with nine saves and a 5-1
record.
