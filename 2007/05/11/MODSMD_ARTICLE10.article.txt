## Fossilized skeletons in the closet 
### 
Are you in the market for a
12,000-year-old mammoth
skeleton?
John Hebior has one in his base
ment. It's a particularly complete
specimen, with interesting evidence
of prehistoric man reflected on its
skeleton. The bones have cut marks,
which mean the animal was proba
bly butchered by prehistoric people
after getting stuck in the mud. Its
bones slowly fossilized, and it rested
inconspicuously under John
Hebior's Wisconsin cornfield for
over 12.000 years. The fossil was dis
covered by researchers in 1994, and
Hebior has been trying to sell it ever
since.
"1 just want some funds for my
grandkids' college," he told re
porters.
It's tougher to sell a mammoth
than you might imagine. A surprising
reason is the fall of the Soviet Union,
which loosened restrictions on sell
ing the region's many mammoth fos
sils. The mammoth market is saturat
ed. which is making the selling tough
for Hebior.
Hebior tried to auction it off once
before, with bidding starting at
$250,000. No one snapped up the fos
sil. Museums don't generally have
that much money, and sometimes
ask for corporate sponsorships to
pay for prize exhibits.
The Field Museum in Chicago
used this strategy to acquire a di
nosaur called "Sue."The controversy
surrounding Sue makes Hebior's
struggle to sell his mammoth look
positively tame.
Sue is the largest and best pre
served T. rex ever discovered. After
Sue died, her body was swept down
stream in a rush of muddy water.
When her remains were dug up, she
was swept into another whirlpool.
This one was all about love, money,
jail time and FBI raids.
It all started with a flat tire. In
1990, Peter Larson and a team of pa
leontologists were in South Dakota,

looking for fossils to dig up and sell
to collectors.The team got a flat tire,
and most headed to a nearby town to
get it fixed.
Sue Hendrickson. Larson's then
girlfriend. stayed behind to take a
walk through some land belonging
to cattle rancher Maurice Williams.
She noticed several large bones pok
ing out of a sandstone cliff. She
called up her team, and as they
began uncovering the bones, they re
alized they had found of the most
complete T. rex skeletons ever dis
covered.
The crew enthusiastically dug up
the bones, and named the monster
"Sue" after its discoverer. They paid
Williams $5000 for the fossil and
whisked it back to their offices. lire
group began preparing the bones for
display, giving public lectures and
welcoming a flood of tourists.
Then came the FBI raid.
Thirty-five officers with guns sur
rounded the warehouse containing

Sue's bones.They seized documents,
photos and business records
along with 10 tons of solid rock and
65-million-year-old bone.
The Larson group was in trouble.
It turns out that even though the fos
sil hunters had had permission from
the landowner Maurice Williams, the
property was actually held in trust to
the Federal Government.
Williams is a Cheyenne River
Sioux, and putting land in trust is a
common practice on reservations,
since it allows landowners to avoid
property taxes. Since the land was in
trust to the government, the tribe
claimed Larson didn't have the right
to take Sue without government per
mission.
What followed was the longest
criminal trial in South Dakota's his
tory. The original sale was declared
void. Larson was sent to jail and Sue
was sent back to Williams.
The rancher decided to put the di
nosaur up for auction at Sotheby's,
and the scientific community was en
raged. If a wealthy collector snapped
up the priceless fossil, how could sci
entists learn from it? 1 low could the
public view it?
The Field Museum in Chicago

desperately wanted to prevent this.
To get enough money to buy Sue. the
museum scraped together funds
from the California State University
system. McDonald's and Walt Dis
ney Parks. Bidding on Sue opened at
$500,000, and the museum walked
away with the dinosaur for
$8,362,500.
But sometimes getting a fossil
into a museum doesn't end the con
troversy. The National. Museum of
Kenya has an incredible collection of
hominid fossils, including an amaz
ingly complete Homo erectus skele
ton called the Turkana boy.
Ibe museum is under renovation,
and evangelical church leaders are
pressing for it to re-open with a
"change in focus."They want the cru
cial fossils relegated to a back room,
and a notice to visitors saying that
evolution is not a fact.
"1 did not evolve from the
Turkana boy," said one bishop indig
nantly.
Tlie controversy must seem like
quite a shock to bones that have lain
quietly for thousands of years.
The hassle is enough to sour some
people on the whole thing. Hebior.
for one, is getting exasperated.
Amazingly, he has (mother mam
moth somewhere under his 36-acre
farm. The mammoth he has for sale
today was discovered by accident.
Researchers at a farm near the
Hebior's were diguing for fossils

when the Hebior family showed
them a large bone they had found
years ago. It had been forgotten, lying
by a shed since John 1 lebior's son
found it while plowing a field in the
l l )70s. The researchers recognized
the bone as part of a mammoth, and
began digging under Hebior's corn.
They uncovered the fossil that
llebior is now trying to sell.
But tests show that the bone
I lebior's son found is from a differ
ent mammoth. I lebior isn't in a hurry
to dig that one up.
"I'd like to sell this one first," he
told reporters, gesturing toward his
basement.
