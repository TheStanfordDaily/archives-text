## Fossilized skeletons in the closet 
### 
Are you in the market for a
12,000-year-old mammoth
skeleton?
John Hebior has one in his base
ment. It's a particularly complete
specimen, with interesting evidence
of prehistoric man reflected on its
skeleton. The bones have cut marks,
which mean the animal was proba
bly butchered by prehistoric people
after getting stuck in the mud. Its
bones slowly fossilized, and it rested
inconspicuously under John
Hebior's Wisconsin cornfield for
over 12.000 years. The fossil was dis
covered by researchers in 1994, and
Hebior has been trying to sell it ever
since.
"1 just want some funds for my
grandkids' college," he told re
porters.
It's tougher to sell a mammoth
than you might imagine. A surprising
reason is the fall of the Soviet Union,
which loosened restrictions on sell
ing the region's many mammoth fos
sils. The mammoth market is saturat
ed. which is making the selling tough
for Hebior.
Hebior tried to auction it off once
before, with bidding starting at
$250,000. No one snapped up the fos
sil. Museums don't generally have
that much money, and sometimes
ask for corporate sponsorships to
pay for prize exhibits.
The Field Museum in Chicago
used this strategy to acquire a di
nosaur called "Sue."The controversy
surrounding Sue makes Hebior's
struggle to sell his mammoth look
positively tame.
Sue is the largest and best pre
served T. rex ever discovered. After
Sue died, her body was swept down
stream in a rush of muddy water.
When her remains were dug up, she
was swept into another whirlpool.
This one was all about love, money,
jail time and FBI raids.
It all started with a flat tire. In
1990, Peter Larson and a team of pa
leontologists were in South Dakota,

looking for fossils to dig up and sell
to collectors.The team got a flat tire,
and most headed to a nearby town to
get it fixed.
Sue Hendrickson. Larson's then
girlfriend. stayed behind to take a
walk through some land belonging
to cattle rancher Maurice Williams.
She noticed several large bones pok
ing out of a sandstone cliff. She
called up her team, and as they
began uncovering the bones, they re
alized they had found of the most
complete T. rex skeletons ever dis
covered.
The crew enthusiastically dug up
the bones, and named the monster
"Sue" after its discoverer. They paid
Williams $5000 for the fossil and
whisked it back to their offices. lire
group began preparing the bones for
display, giving public lectures and
welcoming a flood of tourists.
Then came the FBI raid.
Thirty-five officers with guns sur
rounded the warehouse containing
