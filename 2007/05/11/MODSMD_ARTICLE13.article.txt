## 1,745 sign with SU Ten percent of applicants offered admission; 7 in 10 of those admitted accept spot in '11 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Come September, the members of
the Class of 2011 will be the newest ad
ditions to the Farm. All 1,745 of them.
With 70.8 percent of the 2.465 admit
ted students choosing to enroll at the
University, next year's freshmen will
be a part of one of Stanford's largest
incoming classes.
It has been a year of records in the
Admissions office. The 23,956 appli
cants were the most ever received and
the 10.29 percent admission rate was
the lowest in the University's history.
This year's yield rate — 70.8 percent
— is also among Stanford's highest.
"This is a fantastic year." Dean of
Undergraduate Admission Richard
Shaw said. "It is higher than many
years if not one of the highest in histo
ry. It is up nicely from the past years
and our response rate was higher than
we expected."
As a result of the high matriculation
rate, only 20 transfer students were ac
cepted.
The official matriculation rate will

not be released until the end of the
summer due to what Shaw calls "melt"
— the period during which students
are taken off of waiting lists and
change their minds about their higher
education destination.
"The report on the final class really
doesn't happen until the end of the
summer towards orientation because
we will have to see who ultimately ar
rives on campus," Shaw said.
He added that the official yield rate
would not change very much from
where it stands ( now. saying that there
is usually only about a 20-student
change.
Shaw attributed the high matricula
tion rate to the close interactions
Prospective Freshmen had with under
graduates and staff during last month's
Admit Weekend.
"Admit Weekend makes a differ
ence, you bet," he said. "And, it was a
very wonderful one. The involvement
of the staff was great, so
students] got the essence of what we
are all about, which is the undergradu

ate experience.
"Also, the admitted students
have had very positive engagement
with the wonderful undergradu
ates, RoHos and Hollos," he
added.
Shaw also said that admissions
officers increased their personal
contact with applicants this year.
Aside from visiting all 50 states,
staffers traveled the world, visiting
Latin America, Asia and Europe.

"We are-doing more in terms of
outreach and simply bringing good
information to students nationwide
and worldwide," Shaw said.
Why does the admissions director
think so many students decided on
Stanford this year?
"Because this is the greatest place
in the world to be," he said. "And
they have discovered that.The entire
Stanford community has been very
receptive to the new students, and 1
think they feel a great level of com
fort in coming here, and that is
good."
