## Jacobson ties to ethanol disputed University, professor argue that no oil money tainted study 
### LYNDA BROWNING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study by Civil and En
vironmental Engineering Prof.
Mark Jacobson that was critical of
ethanol as an alternative fuel
source has drawn criticism from
The Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights (FTCR), which
alleged that Jacobson*s report was
"tainted by Exxon-Mobil ties.'"
University researchers and Exxon-
Mobil officials, however, have pro
vided counter-evidence to FTCR's

claim, calling the allegations base
less.
Jacobson's study concluded that
ethanol, which is increasingly cited
as an alternative to fossil fuels,
"may be a greater overall public
health risk than gasoline."
FTCR' official John Simpson
questioned Jacobson's research
because of the professor's previ
ous affiliation with the Global Cli
mate and Energy Project
(GCHP), a Stanford research
project sponsored by Exxon-
Mobil. Toyota, Schlumberger and
General Electric. Jacobson's re
cent ethanol study was not funded
by Exxon-Mobik it was a GCEP
grant for an earlier study about
hydrogen fuel cells that worried


Jacobson
Simpson.
"The American Petroleum Indus
try complained about [the earlier
study],' Jacohson said. "1 don't see
how it could possibly have been bi
ased."
GCEP Project Director Lynn Orr
and Exxon-Mobil representative
Gantt Walton both said that the en
ergy giant has no influence over the
direction of individual research proj
ects.
"The claims made by the con
sumer advocacy group are complete
ly baseless,' Walton said. "We have
no control over the research with
GCEP."
Simpson, FTCR's Stem Cell Pro
ject Director, said he was still con
cerned about any link to Exxon-
Mobil, no matter how distant.
"I'm essentially concerned that
the overall well has been poisoned,"
Simpson told The Daily. "The sci

ence in that specific study could or
could not be valid. Because Stanford
takes $100 million from Exxon-
Mobil, it's very difficult for people
on the outside to take research that
comes out of the University at face
value."
"Stanford has essentially become
part of Big Oil U," he added. "This al
lows the research agenda to be inap
propriately set by the oil companies.
The focus is on the broader picture,
not on the specific suggestions in Dr.
Jacobson's research."
According to Orr, GCEP project
proposals go through a rigorous
two-phase peer-review process. In
the first phase, proposals are re
viewed by at least three discipline
specific experts. In the second
phase, a jvider audience reviews the
proposals. At this point, technical
experts from the sponsor compa
nies can provide feedback. After
considering the reviews from both
phases, GCEP staff decide which
projects will be in the final proposal
package.
This package is then presented to
a committee of sponsor representa

tives for lump-sum approval or re
jection.
"With GCEP. I have no idea
where my funding came from," Ja
cobson said. "It could have come
from Exxon, one of the other spon
sors, or a communal pot."
"It's like me submitting work to
the Department of Energy or the
National Science Foundation," Orr
said. "I come up with the idea, but
they decide whether to fund it."
As for the friticism, Jacobson said
he-is concerned that the press release
will affect the way his research is per
ceived in the broader energy com
munity.
"It's just really irritating," he
said. "My whole career is built
around helping people, and trying
to reduce people's suffering from
air pollution. My study clearly
states that neither gasoline nor
ethanol are good for you. I'm in
support of things that don't kill
people — renewables that don't
emit pollution."
