## Jacobson ties to ethanol disputed University, professor argue that no oil money tainted study 
### LYNDA BROWNING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study by Civil and En
vironmental Engineering Prof.
Mark Jacobson that was critical of
ethanol as an alternative fuel
source has drawn criticism from
The Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights (FTCR), which
alleged that Jacobson*s report was
"tainted by Exxon-Mobil ties.'"
University researchers and Exxon-
Mobil officials, however, have pro
vided counter-evidence to FTCR's

claim, calling the allegations base
less.
Jacobson's study concluded that
ethanol, which is increasingly cited
as an alternative to fossil fuels,
"may be a greater overall public
health risk than gasoline."
FTCR' official John Simpson
questioned Jacobson's research
because of the professor's previ
ous affiliation with the Global Cli
mate and Energy Project
(GCHP), a Stanford research
project sponsored by Exxon-
Mobil. Toyota, Schlumberger and
General Electric. Jacobson's re
cent ethanol study was not funded
by Exxon-Mobik it was a GCEP
grant for an earlier study about
hydrogen fuel cells that worried
