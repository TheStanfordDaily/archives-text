### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Rumors that the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OS/Y) was forcing
fiSO Lomita residents to change the
name of their annual Fxotic Erotic
party swept campus earlier this
quarter, and while 680 Residential
Assistant Lindsay Schauer '07 dis
pellyd this myth, she added that
there will be one big change this
year: Tickets.
Students must now pick up tick
ets for the May 18 party in White
Plaza between noon and 1 p.m.
Monday through Friday of npxt
week. Schauer said the new policy

was a joint decision between house
staff. Residential Education and
the OSA, afid that 680 staff had ad
vocated for tickets for some time.
"[Tickets are] going to change
the atmosphere of the party out
front hopefully in a positive way;"
she said. "Previously we've had
problems with the crowd. [A ticket
policy is] going to make people
more confident to get in and will
make people want to show up
early."
She said students will need a
ticket and their student II") to enter
the party before 11 p.m., after
which time security will let students
in on a space-available basis.
Schauer also said there will'be a
strict no-heckling policy at this
year's party.
"Heckling has kind of been a
problem in recent years," Schauer
said." I"he trats and some other peo
ple will come and set up couches and
bring beer and signs and sit along the
walk, and put up numbers rating
girls,cost umes,on a scale of one to 10
or having megaphones."
She said she agreed with the Uni
versity's push to end heckling;
Schauer said last year's party was
shut down because of interference
from outsiders with security person
nel.
"The University has said "this
will not continue unless we put caps
on what goes on in the frats around
your house,'" she said. "The Uni
versity thinks it's really important
that they be responsible and coop
erate, or we couldn't have our
party."
As tor the name-change rumors.
Exotic Erotic is safe.
"There's been a lot of concern
about the names of parties recent

ly," Schauer said. "Parties can't pro
mote sex or alcohol consumption or
drugs. We were thinking that people
were probably going to have a prob
lem with Exotic Erotic, but they ac
tually didn't. It was such a tradi
tion."
