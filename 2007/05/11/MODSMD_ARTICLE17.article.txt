### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
When Senator John McCain (R
-AZ) came to campus last week, he
was the first 2008 presidential candi
date to visit the University. With the
election looming less than 18
months away. Public Affairs officials
said they believed Stanford is an at
tractive venue for candidates and
raised the possibility that the Uni
versity could host ;i presidential de
bate.
"I think Stanford is already excep
tionally well known, and as an institu
tion we are committed to the free ex
change of ideas." said Senior Associ
ate Vice President of Public Affairs
Larry Morton. "You will find that we
have had a range of candidates, and we
don't show any favoritism."
Ilorton said Stanford is in a unique
position to attract candidates as the
election nears. ()ne of the I Jniversity's
biggest advantages is its proximity to
Silicon Valley, which is home to high
profile campaign members and
donors of nearly every major candi
date.
Morton added that the influence of
political groups on campus such as the
Young Democrats and Young Repub
licans is also important. Also, since
California is moving up the date of
its primary, he said, there will likely
be a record number of debates in the
Golden State.
According to Executive Direc
tor of Public Affairs Elaine I nos.
the University is just as likely to

attract Democrats as Republicans.
She added that Stanford could
host a debate, but that she was un
sure ot the likelihood of such art
event.
"There are so many variables
that come into play."she said."l sus
pect as the campaign moves on,can
didates will come forward.but as to a
full-on debate with all the candi
dates. I can't say."
