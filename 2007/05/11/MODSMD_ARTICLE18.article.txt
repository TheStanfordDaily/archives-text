## Editorial Board Reward teachers 
### 
A Harvard task force has called for a
new focus on teaching, and not just
research, for professors at the uni
versity.
I hed.i Skocpol, a well known sociologist
and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts
and Sciences, chaired the group and wrote
that I larvard needed to find professors who
could perform dual roles as leading re
searchers and excellent educators within
the classroom.
While many professors enjoy teaching.
Skocpol told the New York limes, they
often "don't feel the institution values it or
rewards it or cares about it." ITiere is more
pressure on professors to perform in their
academic lields. publishing articles and
studies, than to make sure their teaching
methods are working in the classroom.
Class size can be part of the problem.
Here, as at Harvard, students can generally
go through much of their coursework with
out ever getting to know a professor, and
there are quite a number of large lecture
courses which students must sit through to
fulfill a requirement, regardless of the
teaching appeal of the lecturer.
Hiankfully. we are not lagging behind
Harvard in coming to the conclusion that
change is necessary, and many efforts, such
as the creation of Introductory Seminars
and Sophomore College, have been success
fully aimed at encouraging closer interaction
between professors and undergraduates.
Still, the institutional problems remain.
Teaching evaluations play a part in tenure

decisions, hut publishing well received arti
cles and doing cutting edge studies is more
likel\ to result in hoth the initial hiring and
later tenure. Sadly, leaders in their field are
not necessarily the best communicators of
basic principles in any subject, and students
often suffer through a brilliant professor's
incredibly ineffective attempts at teaching.
ITie opportunity to learn from and work
with some amazing researchers is certainly
valuable, but the pedagogical disconnects
can mean students do not learn material as
well as they might with a more engaging in
structor.
As we have argued before, restoring a
transparent and effective system lor course
evaluations is a step toward a solution. Nat
urally we do not necessariK want to fire
anyone who is not unequivocally adored in
lectures, but the ability for students, faculty
and administrators to read reviews creates
pressure for improvement. Sheer publicity
will be an incentive for professors do their
best, and if award winning researchers are
consistently getting bad teaching reviews,
departments and administrators can identi
fy faculty who might benefit from a work
shop on teaching methods.
All of this is not to say that there are no
great teachers at Stanford. But we need to
raise the number and make it commensu
rate with the number of great scholars,
l eaching quality makes an enormous differ
ence for the overall experience of students,
and we ought to do all we can to make sure
the quality is high.
