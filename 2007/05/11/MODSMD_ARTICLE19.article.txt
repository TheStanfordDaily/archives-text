# For my mom
## 
### 
My mom visited me in my dorm room
last week. 1 looked at her sitting
cross-legged on my bed, reading my
college essays, showing me purses she liked
on EBay, and 1 was struck so hard and so
abruptly by how much I love her that I al
most started crying.
As I watched my mom pull out of the
driveway, I thought about the memories of
her that I carry of in my head — the tastes,
sounds, smells and images that belong to her
and only her.
Late afternoon belongs to my mother —
it has something to do with the light at that
time of day. She looks shimmery in that
light. I can see her with her streaky blond
hair piled high and lumpy. She sings off-key
to old Broadway show-tunes as she zips
around town, getting the dry-cleaning and
lugging "economy-sized" bags of lam's
Puppy ( how into her glossy white Cadillac
with the VFRSNO license plate. Dinner
will be ready by five in the afternoon, so that
our family has time to digest the food before
bedtime, and we'll eat outside to look at the
garden.
Hospital lobbies belong to my mother. 1
remember waiting to meet her at work, and
watching her walk toward me — she's pol
ished to the core; her thin hair is precisely set
and brushed (it will be flat by the time her
decaf, venti. two-Splenda Americana is fin
ished). I ler make-up is applied mechanical
ly: Lip liner first, then lip color, then gloss:
bone shadow on the brow-bone, taupe on
the lid, chestnut in the crease, and nutmeg
liner along the top and bottom lash line;con
cealer instead of base, and one. two, three
swipes of blush across the apples of her
cheeks. Maura from Saks took time to teach
her exactly what to apply and where to do it.
And it isn't going to change one millimeter,
thank-you-very-much. I ler jade ring. IS
karat gold from the 19305, mainland China,
matches the gold bracelet that dangles
loosely from her left hand — "In Italy, Jack
ie, all the women let their bracelets slide up
and down their arm it's considered very
chic." A thin waft of Chanel Allure floats in
her wake as she strides to meet me. She's
wearing a fuchsia power-suit and Farragamo
shoes that have been re-soled twice because
nothing, not even her shoes, can keep up
with her.
The sound of bare feet on terrazzo

floors belongs to my mother, my first and
best professor. It's my junior year of high
school, and she's in her nubby velvet
bathrobe, the one with worn-down patches
and four generations of puppy demolition
that she's had since I was four. It's late. I'm
lost — do I use a colon or a semi-colon?
What's the better word: Toward or to
wards'.' Who cares about Hawthorne? Be
sides you. Mom. She flips through "A Glos
sary of Terms." and finds nothing. The dog
eared copy of her "compilation of key con
cepts" is whipped out. and she triumphant
ly shows me her findings. She yawns her lit
tle girl yawn, sips her decaf, and shuffles
down the hallway, her feet sticking to the
cool stone floor.
The smell of hair clipper oil belongs to
my mother. She's on the kitchen floor with
the dogs, wearing leggings from K-mart
and a hideous men's polo shirt. "Bought
on sale. Jackie! I got a great deal. Do you
want one? I've already bought four for
your brother..." Deftly, she flips Joey over,
all eighty pounds of poodle fury, and dips
the clippers in the oil. Joey winces at the
electric whirring of the clippers, and tries
to make a grand escape. My mom, arms
like steel traps, coos, "Who is my baby?
Who is going to be so proud of his new
haircut?" Joey escapes two hours later,
completely bald, save for a few hard-to
reach tufts of hair around his crotch and
between his toes. My mom has me sweep
massive piles of poodle hair into trash
bags, but we miss a lot of it, and the kitchen
smells like hair clipper oil and Cheetos for
about a week. For some reason, Joey
smelled like Cheetos when he needed a
bath.
Happy Mother's Day, Mom. I will
love you forever.
