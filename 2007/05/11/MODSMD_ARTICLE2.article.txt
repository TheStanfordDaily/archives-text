# Cardinal Water Polo
## Fight to the Finish Polo out to capture first NCAA Championship title since '02 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Long before the Cardinal's loss to UCLA in the
conference tournament championship on Apr. 29,
an unsubstantiated rumor had gone around the
water polo community that the Bruins have a prac
tice routine they refer to as "Stanfords."
What exactly the drill entails seems shrouded in
mystery to everyone outside of the UCLA pro
gram. When asked, even members of the Stanford
squad are unsure — but they do have an idea.
Cardinal players described a furious sprint

nearly the entire length of the pool, culminating
with an abrupt stop just a few meters short of the
wall. The drill's name, therefore, constitutes what
Stanford senior goalie Meridith McColl character
ized as a "[mocking] poke at our inability to finish
the season."
And with another season coming to an end at
this weekend's NCAA Tournament in Los Alami
tos, Calif., eyes are on the Cardinal yet again, and
the possibility of their pulling another "Stanford."
"1 don't know the story [behind the routine] for
sure," McColl said, noting that her team hasn't won
an NCAA title since 2(X)2, despite fielding strong

teams every year. "Teams never expect Stanford to
finish at the end of the season. When the polls came
out at the beginning of the season, we had the best
players, hands-down. But we were still ranked
third, so we'd love to prove everyone wrong."
Senior two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
voiced a similar interpretation of UCLA's routine.
"Don't know if it's true or not. but 1 think that it
tries to say that that's how we play — we go all out
and then die at the very end," she said."But I real
ly don't know whether it's actually true."
Regardless of whether or not the rumor holds
any veracity, McColl said that the Cardinal has

used it as motivation through the season.
A wake-up call came for the women after they
were defeated by the Bruins two weeks ago in the
championship match of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament. After jumping out
to an early 5-0 lead, UCLA cruised to a 9-3 upset
over the top-seeded Cardinal, earning the Bruins
an automatic berth in this weekend's NCAA Tour
nament.

vator," McColl said. "Last year
when we lost to UCLA (in the
NCAA semifinals], it was two
weeks too late for us to do any
thing about it. ITiis year we got
[that motivation] at MPSFs, so
we've had time to grow from it."
Gregorka added that the team
has taken the loss in stride and is
determined to use the experience
to its advantage.
"[Losing two weeks ago]
showed that we can't take every
thing for granted, and that we re
really going to need to fight for
what we feel we deserve," she
said. "We weren't as sharp as

usual, and we were doing things
we don't usually do. [Since then,]
we've been trying to focus on tac
tical offense and defense, and
sharpening a couple of things
up."
Despite hilling at the MPSF
tournament, Stanford still earned
the No. 1 seed for the NCAA
Championship Tournament,
thanks to its two victories over
UCLA earlier in the year.
"We spent all season making a
case for ourselves, and one game
doesn't break that," McColl said.
"I don't think anyone believes
that one game showed what
we're capable of. Losing to
UCLA was good for us in a way,
because in our minds we now
have something to prove, and we
thrive on having that underdog
mentality."
"It's exciting to be the No. 1

seed [at NCAAs] because our
team definitely has that poten
tial," McColl continued. "But we
won't let it get to our heads, and
we won't take any team lightly.
We're certainly not resting on our
laurels because we can't —we
still have something to prove."
