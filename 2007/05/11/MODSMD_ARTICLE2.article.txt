# Cardinal Water Polo
## Fight to the Finish Polo out to capture first NCAA Championship title since '02 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Long before the Cardinal's loss to UCLA in the
conference tournament championship on Apr. 29,
an unsubstantiated rumor had gone around the
water polo community that the Bruins have a prac
tice routine they refer to as "Stanfords."
What exactly the drill entails seems shrouded in
mystery to everyone outside of the UCLA pro
gram. When asked, even members of the Stanford
squad are unsure — but they do have an idea.
Cardinal players described a furious sprint

nearly the entire length of the pool, culminating
with an abrupt stop just a few meters short of the
wall. The drill's name, therefore, constitutes what
Stanford senior goalie Meridith McColl character
ized as a "[mocking] poke at our inability to finish
the season."
And with another season coming to an end at
this weekend's NCAA Tournament in Los Alami
tos, Calif., eyes are on the Cardinal yet again, and
the possibility of their pulling another "Stanford."
"1 don't know the story [behind the routine] for
sure," McColl said, noting that her team hasn't won
an NCAA title since 2(X)2, despite fielding strong

teams every year. "Teams never expect Stanford to
finish at the end of the season. When the polls came
out at the beginning of the season, we had the best
players, hands-down. But we were still ranked
third, so we'd love to prove everyone wrong."
Senior two-meter defender Alison Gregorka
voiced a similar interpretation of UCLA's routine.
"Don't know if it's true or not. but 1 think that it
tries to say that that's how we play — we go all out
and then die at the very end," she said."But I real
ly don't know whether it's actually true."
Regardless of whether or not the rumor holds
any veracity, McColl said that the Cardinal has

used it as motivation through the season.
A wake-up call came for the women after they
were defeated by the Bruins two weeks ago in the
championship match of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament. After jumping out
to an early 5-0 lead, UCLA cruised to a 9-3 upset
over the top-seeded Cardinal, earning the Bruins
an automatic berth in this weekend's NCAA Tour
nament.
