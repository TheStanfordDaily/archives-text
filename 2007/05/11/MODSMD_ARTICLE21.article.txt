# Baby, you can drive my car
## 
### 
In the glory days, what happened in Vegas
stayed in Vegas. But starting this past
Monday, at least one notorious piece of
Sin City's culture made its way to Stanford
campus.
In case you missed the memo or the Daily
article, the school that has long since brought
you palm-tree-lined streets and for-credit
courses in golf, polo, and sailing, not to men
tion sushi in the dining halls (ok. in Wilbur),
now provides its popped-collar students with
valet parking.
Okay,soit's only temporary and it's just in
one lot (also Wilbur... perhaps Arroyo will
draw in the single-digits this year. Or not).
But still. Am I the only one who's disturbed
by this development?
I"hc phrase "valet parking" conjures up
two distinct images in my mind. One involves
shiny new luxury coupes, an expansive coun
try club, and a wedding waltz playing in the
background. The other features whirling
neon lights, a near-solid haze of cigarette
smoke, and the constant bells and whistles of
coin-and-card-swallowing slot machines.
These are the only places where valet park
ing seems normal. And any place that con
tains an EiffelTower. an Empire State Build
ing, and an Egyptian pyramid within two city
blocks is clearly not normal to begin with.
Even in Vegas, where I know valet parking
is part of the over-the-top. everyone's-a-win
ner-when-you re-dropping-hundreds-to
play-with-laminated-paper culture, I feel un
comfortable handing my keys over. My car is
an extension of my personal space; getting
back in it to find the driver's seat relocated to
the rear, the steering wheel down to the
ground, and the radio blasting hip-hop is jar
ring (and makes me particularly aware of my
vertically-challenged stature). The last time I
relinquished the keys, my Civic Hybrid came
back with a blinking message on the dash
board: "Check Fuel Cap." I've unscrewed
and rescrewed and hit the reset button at

least twenty times. I fell. I've even refilled the
tank at this point.The three little words still
won't go away.
Personal space issues aside, the real rea
son I'm uncomfortable with valet parking is
because of its socioeconomic implications.
It's one thing to hand my keys over when I
take my car to Lozano's — getting my car
washed professionally is a service 1 can't per
form on my own (trust me: I've spent entire
Saturday afternoons spraying, wiping, and
vacuuming, and my car NEVER looks that
shiny). Same thing with taking my car in to
the shop.
Parking, on the other hand, is something
that comes with the territory/luxury of driv
ing. Sure, there are plenty of times when it's
less than fun. Palo Alto on a Friday night, for
example. Or San Francisco at pretty much
anytime of day/night/year. And there are a
number of particularly sweat-inducing road
challenges, such as maneuvering into a tight
spot, preferably parallel, between an oversize
Lexus SUV and a Boxster (this is a regular
issue at MenloSchool in Atherton. where I'm
currently a teacher. We share a parking lot
with the students, but it's not hard to tell
which cars belong to the faculty. They're the
scratched ones more than two years old).
Still, for all of the times I've missed the pre
views and openers after spending thirty min
utes circling the block, the idea of paying
someone else to do the dirty work just seems
a bit too spoiled for my tastes.

Speaking of payment, there's also the issue
of tipping. Is the expectation that the Wilbur
valets will he tipped for their services? I can't
imagine so. But even when it's explicitly a
complimentary service, there's always that
awkward moment when they hand you the
keys. And you give them a gracious smile in
return. It's hard to imagine they don't walk
away thinking unhappy thoughts.
I'm aware that parking on this campus,
which probably hasn't been plentiful since
Henry Ford introduced his Model-T. just got
harder. In addition to Monday's closure of
400 parking spaces near the Law School and
Stern, where the Munger Graduate Resi
dences will be built, the Med School lost 500
spaces — on the same day — to its own con
struction project. The "attendant assistance"
now available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the
Wilbur lot is intended to offset the inconven
ience caused by the Munger construction
work; once all the regular spaces are filled,
the valets will park cars in the aisles (1 can't
imagine how this will work in terms of re
trieval of the un-valet-parked cars, but I'm
sure they've got it covered).
As someone who currently only comes to
campus twice a week, and still gets annoyed
at the tourists slowly circling the Oval (hello!
Its almost all permit parking, people!), I
know I m far trom feeling the pain of these
parking complications — but I'm not ques
tioning the necessity of a solution. I'm ques
tioning the choice of this particular solution.
At moments like this. I wonder WWBS? As
in: what would Berkeley (or anyone looking
for yet another example of Stanford's
wealth-dripping expenditures) say? I'm fair
ly certain it would be highly critical and en
tirely accurate.

of tipping. Is the expectation that the Wilbur
valets will he tipped for their services? I can't
imagine so. But even when it's explicitly a
complimentary service, there's always that
awkward moment when they hand you the
keys. And you give them a gracious smile in
return. It's hard to imagine they don't walk
away thinking unhappy thoughts.
I'm aware that parking on this campus,
which probably hasn't been plentiful since
Henry Ford introduced his Model-T. just got
harder. In addition to Monday's closure of
400 parking spaces near the Law School and
Stern, where the Munger Graduate Resi
dences will be built, the Med School lost 500
spaces — on the same day — to its own con
struction project. The "attendant assistance"
now available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the
Wilbur lot is intended to offset the inconven
ience caused by the Munger construction
work; once all the regular spaces are filled,
the valets will park cars in the aisles (1 can't
imagine how this will work in terms of re
trieval of the un-valet-parked cars, but I'm
sure they've got it covered).
As someone who currently only comes to
campus twice a week, and still gets annoyed
at the tourists slowly circling the Oval (hello!
Its almost all permit parking, people!), I
know I m far trom feeling the pain of these
parking complications — but I'm not ques
tioning the necessity of a solution. I'm ques
tioning the choice of this particular solution.
At moments like this. I wonder WWBS? As
in: what would Berkeley (or anyone looking
for yet another example of Stanford's
wealth-dripping expenditures) say? I'm fair
ly certain it would be highly critical and en
tirely accurate.
