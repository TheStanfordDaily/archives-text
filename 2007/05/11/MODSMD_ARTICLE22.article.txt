## Getting it right at East Palo Alto Charter School 
### JENNIFER CAROLAN 
Georgetown and Howard are just two
■of the colleges on the agenda for local
eighth grade students preparing for
an East Coast adventure in June. College is
the culture here —eighth graders and eight
year olds alike boldly declare which universi
ties they hope to attend.
With prestigious colleges already planned
for their futures, and Ivy League pennants
adorning their classroom walls, it may not
seem surprising that students here academi
cally outperform many of their K-9 counter
parts throughout the country. But Hast Palo
Alto Charter School (I PACS| is a free pub
lic school located in a city largely passed over

by the economic booms that have enriched
the rest of Silicon Valley. Notorious nation
wide lor its academic failures, the city of East
Palo Alto has come to cherish HPAC'S as an
educational lighthouse. The demand is so
great th;it each grade from K- 1 ) has a wait list
and the school will expand through the 12th
grade in coming years.
In a time when the government is scram
bling to understand what works in education,
more and more analytical eyes are turning to
study fiPACS. And by all measures, the
school is remarkably successful. California
ranks its schools through a system called the
"similar schools ranking." Ihis means that a
school is measured by how well it is living up
to its potential based on its challenges. Chal

lenges are factors experienced by students
that might correlate with test scores,like eth
nicity. English fluency and family income. By
this definition, EPACS faces many chal
lenges. Yet when compared with 256 similar
k-9 schools, EPACS tops all schools in the
state, ranking first in mathematics and third
in English-language arts.
Replicating successful educational mod
els docs not always guarantee positive re
sults, but the EPACS model can be repro
duced in any school around the country. It is
a simple model with a dual focus on provid
ing high-quality instruction and creating in
novative learning experiences for students.
While faddish school reforms have cycled
through neighboring schools, leaving a wake

of poor test scores and disjointed initiatives,
ft PACS has kept its focus on learning,steadi
ly improving student achievement outcomes.
Providing a rigorous and rich educational
experience begins in the classroom. At
EPACS, school resources are used in a man
ner that reflects this philosophy. Like the
high value bestowed to engineers at Google,
the work of teachers is highly valued at
EPACS. Principal Allison Leslie prioritizes
improving instruction and providing support
for her teachers. With a tight budget and lots
of need, she chose to spend money on in
structional coaches who work with small
groups of struggling students, rather than a
new computer lab. Empowering educators is
part of the culture at EPACS-Leslie herself is

a former EPA( S teacher who became princi
pal in 2004.
The hardworking and humble EPACS
staff is quick to credit the school's success in
part to the enormous amount of help re
cruited from outside school walls. For exam
ple, Stanford alum and current EPACS ad
ministrator Mike Herman founded Stan
ford's ( lose the Gap program, which con
nects eager Stanford undergrads to EPACS
students for one-on-one literacy tutoring.
Another example: EPACS fifth graders
work with the National Wildlife Refuge,
using GPS devices to canvas the marshes of
San Francisco Bay to track" predators of the
Clapper Rail, an endangered bird.
Community partnerships like these
have made the individualized ap
proach to education that EPACS
strives for possible, enhancing the
learning experience for students.
How does EPACS rally these
community resources when the dis
trict school, less than 2 miles away,
has a fraction of the services? "it
goes back to the staff who takes ini

tiative and teacher, leaders who see
and hear about resources and go
after them," explains Leslie. The
EPACS staff is selected by how well
they fit in with EPACS culture,
rather than the number of education
classes on their transcripts. Leslie
looks for teachers who will act as
change agents, who have their eyes
on the "bigger picture of education."
For EPACS teachers, reforming edu
cation begins in the classroom.
What the EPACS example proves
is that creating a coherent school cul
ture focused on teaching and learn
ing caivyield far greater achievement
outcomes for students than top

down mandated reforms that lack a
direct connection to improving in
struction. Instead of seeking out the
next silver bullet in education.policy
makers ought to take a hard look at
exemplary schools like 1- PACS to un
derstand that improving our schools
begins with removing bureaucratic
barriers and empowering educators.
