### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihis weekend, the Stanford track and field
team will enjoy a home advantage for the Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships at Cobb
Track and Angell Field. And in a meet like
this, with the best of the best from all around
the Pac-10 coming to the Farm in pursuit of
championship glory, anything can happen.
"I have mixed reviews about running at
home, said Stanford head coach Edrick Flo
real."! think whether a person does better at
home will depend on each individual team
member. Some will draw from Iriends and
family being around, and some will have an
added pressure."
"Running at home is almost like practice,
almost too common." he continued. "A good
thing about going away to a meet is that once
you step off the bus. you know that you are in
the enemy's territory and that it is time to
work."
Last week's multi-event portion of the
Pac-10 Championships were a success for the
Cardinal. Freshman Kara Bennet finished
12th in the heptathlon and was the only Stan
ford woman to finish all seven events. She ex
celled in the javelin throw, earning a mark of
39.19 meters for 652 of her 4416 points total.
Junior Josh Hustedt came back from be
hind to seize a sixth-place finish in the de
cathlon. which earned the men a three-point
edge coming into this weekend's events.
11 ustedt had a great showing on the second day
of his competition, running himself to a victory
in the 110-meter hurdles race, with a time of
14.44 to earn l >lB of his 6849 points total.
The men's and women's teams have
demonstrated different strengths and confi
dence levels over the course of the season, but
Floreal asserted that both teams have a
chance at victory this weekend.
"The women's team is a little stronger than
the men," Floreal said. "But on the men's side,
no teams scores a lot of points during the con
ference championship, so it is anyone's meet.
Both teams will be competing with USC and
ASU for the top spot in the championship. It
will be interesting to see where we stack up."
The No. 15 Stanford women's track team
looks to top No.l Arizona State with its
strength, high jumps and long-distance speed.
Junior Melissa Yunghans has thrown the far
thest distance in the shot-put event on the
women's team, throwing 15.36 meters. Yung
hans. as well as senior Sally Mills, who has the
season discus record (47.16 meters), will look
to lead the Cardinal women in the throwing

department.
Among the jump events, junior Erica
McLain has found her way to the top of the
Stanford rankings and will look to score well
in the long jump (20-7/6.27 m) and the triple
jump (45-7.75/13.91 m).
The women's main strength, though, will
he running. Stanford cross country was
ranked second nationally this past season,
and the team will look to contribute quite a
few first-place finishes.
Senior Jakki Bailey is a top-notch sprinter
and will lead the Cardinal in the 100- and the

200-meter races, with records of 11.50 and
23.66 seconds, respectively. Junior distance
runner Arianna Lambie has the Pac-10's top
time in the 5,000-meter race with a 15:31.34
record. Lambie will also compete in the 1,500
meters (4:15.75).
Lindsay Allen leads the women in the
3.000-meter steeple race with a time of
10:21.85.The junior came in third at last year's
Pac-lOs and will look to improve upon last
year's performance.
In general, the women's team has high
spirits going into this weekend's events and

looks forward to the tough competition.
"We are hungry to bring down ASU"
Lambie said. "We lost by two points last year
to them, and they won the indoor nationals.
We will give them a run for their money. 1 feel
really committed to performing as well as I
can for the team.
"My season has been going as well as any
season has ever gone for me," she continued.
"This will be a demanding meet for everyone
because we must compete in at least two
events under the championship-level pres
sure."

"In the heat of the battle, I'd rather have a
team that truly cares about each other," Flore

all year to build a sense of team unity and have
achieved this goal. The most important thing
for us is supporting each other, and 1 think that
this will pay dividends this weekend."
