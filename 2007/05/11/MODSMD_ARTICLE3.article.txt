GAME NOTES: The No. 1 Cardinal women will go
for their fourth consecutive national title, starting
today against the Hornets. Should the Stanford
squad advance, it will face the winner of the BYU-
Oregon matchup. The Cardinal is 100-11 in the
postseason since 1982, when the NCAA adopted
the current format of tournament play.

mento State over the years, sized up the Cardinal's competition.
"'lTiey have some good girls at the top of their lineup." Yelsey said,
"and they'll be a touch team to play, especially for the regional
[round]."
"They are a legitimate team," freshman Lindsay Burdette added.
The winner of today's 1 p.m. contest will face the winner of the
Oregon-BYtJ match, taking place at 10 a.m. today.The Cardinal has
up a lot of experience against Pac-10 rival Oregon, but is relatively
inexperienced against the Cougars. With that said, Yelsey stressed
that Stanford's opponents, at this point in the NCAA Champi
onships. are irrelevant.
"It doesn't really matter who's on the other side of the net," she
said. "We've had really good preparation up to this point — that's
what matters."
ITiis weekend's first- and second-round matches mark the he
ginning of the 64-team tournament set to conclude in Athens, Ga.
in the coming weeks. Despite the vast field of tennis teams from
around the country competing in the tournament. Stanford has
taken the title the past three years and is in good position to cap
ture a fourth.
"I think we have the skills and the talent and the camaraderie to
win another title," Yelsey said. "We have the team to do it."
With the top-heavy structure of NCAA women's tennis, only a
few other teams figure to have a legitimate shot at capturing the
title. Burdette listed Georgia. Georgia Tech and Pac-10 foes UCLA
and Southern California as possible teams to watch out for.
In preparing for the tournament, Stanford head coach Lele
Forood has kept her team on a strict regimen, simulating intense,
match-like conditions. Both Yelsey and Burdette agreed that the
last week and a half of practice has been highly beneficial in
preparing the Cardinal.
"Everybody's kind of in that tournament mode," Yelsey said.
"We're all trying to be at the top of our game. Every practice is very
intense, very efficient and high-energy. Everything kind of clicks."
"We definitely have really come together this week," Burdette
added. "We're in playing mode."
The Cardinal is also thrilled to finally be at health. Sophomore
Jessica Nguyen,hampered much of the past year by leg injuries,ap
pears to be l(X)-percent for the start of the tournament.
\fter the conclusion of the team championships, members of
the Stanford team will also compete in the NCAA Individual
Championships.
The Cardinal's No. 1 Theresa Logar, junior Celia Durkin. Bur
dette. Yelsey and Nguyen will all suit up for the singles bracket of
the individual tournament, beginning near the end of this month.
In the doubles bracket of the individual championships, the
teams of Durkin/Logar and Burdette/Yelsey will represent Stan
ford. Although the Durking/Logar duo is seeded higher, Yelsey has
experience in previous years of the doubles bracket, previously
reaching the semifinals and finals of the tournament.
Distinguishing between the team and individual champi
onships. Yelsey explained that the team title is exponentially more
important.
"It's great to be able to have those individual results, but its all
about the team," she said.
Burdette, caught up in the emotions and excitement of being a
freshman.emphasized the singularity of the team NCAA Champi
onships.
"It's actually one of the coolest things I've ever done." she said.
"There's so much history being at Stanford. ITiere are four grand
slams every year: every time you turn around, there's another one.
This is once a year — it's really special."
