## Cast is only redeeming aspect of 'Georgia Rule' 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION GEORGIAN 
"Georgia Rule" (2(X)7) begins and ends on
a highway outside a small town in Idaho. In
the opening scene we see a mother and
daughter fighting. In the closing scene we see
a reconciliation. In between these two scenes
is a modest story about two generations of
mothers struggling to understand their
daughters' isolation. The film has a similar
tone to other movies directed by Gary Mar
shall ("Pretty Woman" and "Runaway
Bride") but its subject matter is more serious.
The result, buoyed by its talented lead actress
es, is palatable but never really convincing.
The actresses 1 mentioned include Jane
Fonda (Academy Award winner in 1972 and
1979). Felicity Huffman (Academy Award
nominee in 2(K)6) and Lindsay Lohan (urn,
yeah). Lohan plays Rachel, a rebellious
teenager who is hauled off to spend summer
in Idaho as punishment for her increasingly
dysfunctional behavior. Before long. Rachel
confides in the town veterinarian that she was
molested by her step father. The revelation
forces Rachel's mother Lilly (Huffman) to re
turn to Idaho to discover the veracity of
Rachel's claim. While in Idaho, Lilly also con

fronts her own estranged mother, Georgia
(Fonda).
It's not difficult accepting Lohan as a trou
blesome, over-sexed teenager who enjoys
flirting with men twice her age and perform
ing oral sex on the locals. Lohan is convincing
because she's talented and because the char
acter she's playing doesn't seem too removed

from her public image.
Indeed the young actress
received a warning letter
from studio CEO James
G. Robinson during pro
duction of "Georgia
Rule," citing her for "dis
courteous, irresponsible
and unprofessional" con
duct. During a break in
production. Lohan was
also (allegedly) involved

in a drunken incident at a photo .shoot in Dis
neyland.
That Rachel is played by someone remote
ly competent is crucial to "Georgia Rule," a
movie that continually toys with our loyalty to
the character. At certain points, Rachel is
portrayed as a troubled victim. At others, she
is a manipulative teenager bent on disrupting
her mother's happiness. Lohan plays both

sides well. It's a particularly impressive feat
given her character is supposed to he rather
cultured. So cultured in fact that she can rec
ognize Bach, answer Jeopardy questions
about poetry and read seven novels in two
weeks. This is certainly not the Lohan we
know from reading tabloids!
Nevertheless, despite Lohan's appeal, I

suspect audiences will be
frustrated hy the way
Rachel's allegation is han
dled. Too often the issue
seems resolved, only to be
thrown back into doubt sev
eral scenes later. Choosing
Cary Elwes ("The Princess
Bride" and "Twister") to
play Rachel's stepfather
was a wise decision given
the handsome actor has

played both nice guys and sleazy guys in the
past.
However, the film is mostly undermined
by a screenplay that explores serious issues
with a certain sense of detachment. Consider
Lilly's alcoholism. It's important to the film's
back-storybut it's too often played for laughs.
A scene with a disgusted Georgia scrubbing
out Lilly's vodka bottle before trashing it, in

particular, is repeated. And when Georgia
agrees to purchase alcohol for her troubled
daughter, it doesn't seem like an important
moment in their relationship. It seems more
of a joke highlighting how "cool" grandma
can he.
Speaking of grandma, it's nice to see Jane
Fonda back in movies. This is only her second
film in 17 years. Her last movie was "Monster
in Law" (2(M)5), a limp comedy costarring Jen
nifer Lopez. Though Fonda is appealing in
"Georgia Rule," it's not a great part for the
aging actress who deserves more challenging
roles. The same can be said for 1 luffman who
gained recognition two years ago playing a
transsexual in "Transamerica."
The two actresses help make "Georgia
Rule" watchable. But they cannot overcome
a script that stifles any emotional attachment
to its characters. During the film's closing
scenes I thought I caught a friend of mine
shedding a tear. Walking out of the cinema, 1
asked if this was the case. The response was a
defiant "no." In fact, she later told me that she
much prefers the mother-daughter relation
ship on "Gilmore Girls" which aired during
the screening we attended. Thankfully TiVo
meant she didn't miss out on the episode.
Rating: 2.5 stars out of 5
