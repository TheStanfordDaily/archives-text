# The 						Ex' is no 'Garden State,' but Braff is amusing

### BRENDAN RANDOLPH MARTEN INTERMISSION EX 
Maybe it's because I like Zach Braff, Amanda Peet and
Charles Grodin (I'm neutral on Jason Bateman). Or maybe
it's because 1 was looking for a movie that was light — some
thing that wouldn't make me ... oh. how do I put this, wait.

1 know... "think."
At any rate, "The
Ex" really hit the
spot. While it's no
"Garden State,"
it's a light and fun
flick that goes
down easy.
The premise of
the film is that
Tom Reilly (Braff)
and his wife Sofia
(Peet) are about to
have a baby. Sofia,
an ambitious New
York lawyer, is
supposed to stay
home with the
child once it is

born, while Tom will bring home the bacon with his immi
nent promotion to "head lunch chef." Unfortunately, the
promotion doesn't exactly go as planned and Tom ends up
getting himself fired instead, leaving the couple with only
one option — moving back to Ohio to take a job with the ad
vertising agency where Sofia's father (Charles Grodin)
works.

Once back in
Ohio, things get in
teresting since it
turns out that Tom
will be working
under Chip (Jason
Bateman), who
went out with Sofia
back in high school.
. . and is still ob
sessed with her
years later. As both
Tom and Sofia find
themselves becom
ing increasingly un
happy with their re
spective situations
in the new home
town, it starts to

JJ JBr
take a toll on their relationship.
To be honest, one of the movie's strengths is its brevity.
Clocking in at only 89 minutes, the film ends right about
when you're ready for it to be over. There isn't enough sub
stance of depth to eanjy it much beyond an hour and a half,
so it's fortunate that those in the editing department were
wise enough' to keep it short. More is not always better.
Braff is perfectly cast as a weak-willed yet sensitive and car
ing husband, and Bateman in terms of both vil
lainy and creepiness as a former-cheer-leader turned high
flying ad exec. Grodin delivers a memorably quirky perfor
mance as Sofia's obsessed dad. but the
movie's storyline doesn't give as much attention to Peet's
character as might be desired. And while Tom and Sofia cer
tainly encounter marital problems in the course of the plot,
the development of these issues seems somewhat lacking
and superficial.
jBA.II in all, "The Ex" is a decent way to spend an hour and
a half. There are certainly some laughs, but given the
strength of the cast, it's hard to escape,the feeling that it
could have been much more. That being said, ii also could
have been much, much less. So I'd say go ahead and give it
a shot... especially if someone else is picking up the tab. If
you're unsure, though, there's no reason to rush out to the
theater now. It'll still be just as funny when it's sitting on the
shelf at Blockbuster this August.
