## Best mother/daughter movies, and a few exceptions 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION EBERT 
In honor of the rapidly approach
ing Mother's Day holiday this Sun
day, 1 have constructed a list of some
of the best mother/daughter films
available. These are generally movies
that feature a strong mother/daugh
ter relationship, although I've let a
few exceptions slip in as well.
In no particular order:
"Stepmom" (1998) — Jackie
I larrison (Susan Sarandon) is dying
of cancer. She is scared that her chil
dren will let new stepmom Isabel
Kelly (Julia Roberts) replace her.
Then the children jump on a bed
singing "Ain't No Mountain High
Enough," Jackie knits a blanket
with everyone's pictures sewn on it

and there's a final family photo at
the end (so nobody forgets floor
dying Jackie). I may mock it. but
watching this movie with your
mother will certainly make you
both cry.
"Freaky Friday" (2003) — Dare
I put 1 Lindsay Lohan movie on a
"best of" anything list? It seems that
I have. I actually found this movie to
be reasonably cute, especially since
it features a pre-alcoholic, pre
anorexic, pre-cocaine-using Lind
say. T his is your typical role-swap
ping film in which the mother and
daughter learn to appreciate one an
other to a new degree by literally liv
ing in each others' shoes. Ignore the
parts where the mother-in-thc
daughter's-body flirts with the
daughter's love interest, as I find
that to he a little bit disturbing.

"Forrest Gump" (1994) —
Mama Gump has to he the best
mother ever. Not only is she full of
wisdom ("Life is like a box of choco
lates..."). but when she tells her son
with a 75 IQ that he is "no different
than anybody else," she makes us
believe her. While this movie does
not feature a mother/daughter rela
tionship, I will defend to the death
its presence on this list. 1 can't think
of a better film for a mother and a
daughter to watch together.
"Heartbreakers" (2001) — This
movie features a mother (Sigourney
Weaver) and a daughter (Jennifer
Love Hewitt) who "work" together as
con artists. While their lifestyle of scam
ming rich men to steal their money is
morally reprehensible, it's sweet how
this mother and daughter are able to
work together on a daily basis.

"The Princess Diaries" (2001)
— The main relationship in this
film is not between mother and
daughter, but between grandmoth
er and granddaughter. Close
enough! Queen Clarisse (Julie An
drews) teaches awkward, gangly
Mia (Anne Hathaway) how to be a
princess (which entails learning
how to drink tea properly and
learning how to use a flat iron, as
princesses cannot have frizzy hair),
while Mia teaches Clarisse how to
have fun. That's (grand)mothers
and (grand)daughters exhibiting
mutualism at its best!
"The Joy Luck Club" (1993) —
Watch this one — which features
the stories of four women born in
the U.S. and their often turbulent
relationships with their mothers —
if vou want to not-so-subtly hint to

your mother that she's too over
bearing. However, also
to keep in mind that if your motner
acts this way, it's only because she
loves you. We hope.
Stay away from:
1. "Heavenly Creatures" (1994) —
This is actually a good movie, but
murdering your mother is not with
in the spirit of the holiday...
2. "Sophie's Choice" (1982) —
This is another good movie that isn't
thematically appropriate. Would
you want your mother to choose be
tween you and your siblings?
3. "Because 1 Said So" (2007)
Diane Keaton should have known
better. This movie was just
awful.
