### DEVMIN PALIHAKKARA INTERMISSION MOM-RELATED MOVIE-GOER 
It might be surprising, though not too un
charitable, to claim that movies have found

no more than three traditional roles for
mothers — the one whose child is in
danger ("Bambi," "Ifiginea," Jodie Fos
ter's recent career); the one whose love
of her children is handicapped by cir
cumstance and misfortune ("A Woman
Under the Influence," "Kramer vs.
Kramer," "You Can Count on Me"); the
one who drags her kids around the screen
to symbolize the third dimension of her
character, or in the case of Julia Roberts,
simply win an Oscar.
Retort: Mrs. Robinson ("The Gradu
ate," 1967) fits none of the above cate
gories. "The Graduate" however, does
not aim to portray a mother — Mrs.
Robinson's maternity is however nothing
more than a plot device. Furthermore,
there may, admittedly, be a few candi-

dates that do not precisely fit the above
framework — for instance, where does
Mommie Dearest place? But these few ex
ceptions should not discharge movies of
their comfort in pigeon-holing mothers.
This constraint however, should in no
"way deter you from your Mother's Day tra
dition of turning to movies to remind your
self of how much your mother loves you. I
am not, I must admit, absolutely convinced
of its value and plan to watch "Murphy's
Law" after calling up my mom. But that is

my fat misfortune. For there are movie
gems about mothers that will delight you for
ages and make you re-think your relation
ship with that someone who has probably
loved you a bit more than you gave her cred-

it for.
1. "Terms of Endearment" (1983) —
Since the last sentence betrayed me for the
hopeless sap that I am, let me get this out of
the way. Sappy it most definitely is — unin
hibited in its emotion fondling, but one that
(miraculously) leaves you feeling clean after
the experience. For that alone it deserves
praise. The mothers in the movie are played
flawlessly by the husky-voiced Debra
Winger and the intriguing Shirley
MacLaine. Together the women hold their
own against one of Jack Nicholson's best
performances. The dialogue is elegant and

the beach-driving scene is movie legend.
2. "All About My Mother" (1999) — A
masterpiece of our times and one of the best
loved foreign films ever, Pedro Almodovar
(the madman of Spanish cinema) carves an
unforgettable experience that stems from a
mother's loss of her son. In less skilled hands
this would have resulted in two hours of
flashbacks leading up to a shot of the moth
er laying flowers at her son's grave. Almod
ovar has no time for such drivel. Manuela,
the mother in question, goes in search of the
transvestite father of her son, nurses an
HIV-positive nun (Penelope Cruz) and
finds employment with the actress indirectly
responsible for the death of her son. For
once, in movies, it is argued that a mother's
capacity for love extends far beyond the con
fines of her offspring.
3. "Sansho Dayu" (1954) — arguably,
the pinnacle of Japanese cinema and unar
guably one of the most heart-breaking films
ever made. The main focus of this movie is
the wife of a governor who is exiled with her
children. In the exploration of unimaginable
tragedy that follows her, the director, Keinji
Mizoguchi, allows us time to witness the
echo of her haunting singing, her graceful
hobbling along the seashore (she loses her
leg quite violently) and one of the most dev
astating reunions ever imagined in litera
ture.
4. "Mildred Pierce" (1945) —A classic
story that portrays a mother's love set in
19405-noir, the film delivers Joan Crawford
as a mother bent upon improving the lot of
her children, blind to the ingratitude that

they show her. The film combines the mag
nificent Ms. Crawford with mystery, murder
and heartbreak.
5. "400 Blows" (1959) — In a more gal
lant mood, I would not have suggested this
title, seeing that the relationship between
the mother and her son is too complex for
simple heartstrings. For instance, the son
fakes the death of his mother in order to win
the sympathy of his schoolmaster. The
mother retaliates by sending him to a correc
tional facility. In spite of this all, "400
Blows" is a charming film and a personal fa
vorite. Of all the films mentioned here, it is
