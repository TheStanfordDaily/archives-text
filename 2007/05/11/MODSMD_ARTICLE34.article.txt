### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION PERSONAL SHOPPER 
Mother's Day is only two days away. For every one of you who bought your mom a gift
in February and sent it to her a week ago. there are probably 100 of you who have no clue
what to get your mom or didn't even realize that Mother's lsav is already upon us. This list
1 is for you. While your mom might receive the gift a little late, that's far better than being for
gotten. I lopefully this list can generate at least some ideas for moms of all shapes and sizes.
your m0m....

... makes Martha Stewart look like a summer camp craft counselor: Send her aluminum foil, your unwashed laun
dry. and a giant tub of paste and then ask her to make sugar cookies out of them. Bam!
...has a green thumb: Send her seed packets of her favorite plants. If that doesn't seem like enough, search for a funky
watering can. Target.com actually has some good ones.
...kills every living plant that she touches: Get her a garden gnome. I personally find these a little eerie, but at least

there'll be something living in your mom's garden. Until someone tries to

steal the creepy dude, that is. Oh well.

.cries every time you come home: Find a picture of the two of you

and put it in a cute frame. Extra points if it's a picture from your
fifth birthday party. Guaranteed tear jerker.

...lives close to Stanford: Take her out to brunch. Nothing's bet
ter than some quality time over hash browns. Even better?
Make your mom brunch, kid style. Remember when you'd
"cook" your mom a bowl of rice krispies, put it on a tray with
some burnt toast and bring it to her in bed? Those were the days.
Sure she'll be grossed out, but she'll smile for the memories. Aw

....would hangout at Moonßean's as opposed totheCoHo: Purchase
her some tea from teaforte.com. Both the quirky, pyramid shape of the
tea hags and their delicious contents are guaranteed to delight.

... likes to cook: Get her a set of personalized spatulas from williams-sonoma.com. Nothing says"I
love you" like a set of spatulas, especially if you have them inscribed with "1 love you."

..likes to eat: Bake her something! Ask your friends in co-ops, row houses or Mirieleesif you
can make use of their kitchens. If you're lazy or only know how to use an Easy Bake Oven.
Amazon.com will help you order every kind of food imaginable. In two clicks you can order

your mom some baklava and a jar of Mister Mustard

Hot Mustard. Mmmm

...likes Oprah: Get her something from Oprah's list
of Favorite Things, the "O List" if you will (just
Google it). Unfortunately (but not surprisingly)

Oprah's favorite things are pretty expensive, but
there are a few good deals hidden in there. The cate-

gories range from food to technological gadgets, so there is

something for everyone. I'd be wary of the clothes category, though

No one should have that much cashmere in their wardrobes. Nor own 10 velour sweat suits. Yikes.

...enjoys reading: Do not buy her the first bargain book you see at Borders, no matter how pretty the pictures are. It

you don't know what kind of books your mom likes,
, . u :.. .i 4 l :

maybe you should just get her a nice book-

mark. Or, if she doesn't have much time

for reading, consider getting her a
subscription to a magazine.

...likes Oprah AND reading:

Duh. Check out the list of
reads from Oprah's
Book Club. Most of

her chosen books

even come in Oprah
versions with spe
cial Oprah-ap-

proved book jack
ets and Oprah
generated read
ing questions.
No, but seriously,
she has pretty
good taste for the
most part. You

won't find the "Da
Vinci Code" on this
list.

.spends more time on

her laptop than you do:
Check out the gadgets at

funusb.com. They're all lun and they are all powered by a USB drive (surprise!). They have everything from

heated gloves to an aromatherapy oil burner. I kid you not.

.has a sweet tooth but also likes flowers: Instead spend-

ing lots of money on a bouquet of roses, go with a

cookie bouquet instead. Not only are these adorably

decorated sugar cookies absolutely delicious, but

they also don't require water or confusing pack-

ets of soggy plant food. http://www.cookiesby-

design.com/

....wears her "Stanford Mum" T-shirt at least
onee a week: Send her a paper you got an "A"
on or your best problem set along with a set of
snazzy Stanford magnets. This way she am

proudly display your work where it belongs: on
the refrigerator. With any luck, your new achieve- v

ment might edge out the state capitals test that's
been hanging out on the fridge door since second

grade. Oh Boise.

...is more athletic than Sporty Spice: Get her an armband for
her svelte iPod. Or, make her a fun workout mix CD. Think more
Paula Abdul and less Belle and Sebastian.

...loves your siblings more than you: Re-wrap the crappy present she gave you for your last birthday.
And then send it to her. Oh, snap!
...is a Mom: Get her a card. 1 haven't once met a mom who doesn't enjoy a good card. And I've met a

lot of moms in my day. Try to actually spend time looking through them rather than just deftly choosing gj
a cheesy one. General rule of thumb: If the card looks like a bottle of Pepto Bismol mated with a flower
patch, put it down. Now. On second thought, maybe you should just make a card. ou could even use this ar-

tide to make a collage (see, it's useful after all!).

...thinks Mother's Day is a capitalist scam: Celebrate! You're off the hook. But
you really should scud her something. Like maybe one ol those atiocious pink
i cards. It would be...ironic.

' ...understands that you are a poor and/or lazy college student: just call her on
Mother's Day. If you actually have a conversation with her rather than rushing

off after a chorus of "I'm fine," "I have SO much to do" and"I need sleep." she

will probably appreciate the gesture even more.

...has a green thumb: Send her seed packets of her favorite plants. If that doesn't seem like enough, search for a funky
watering can. Target.com actually has some good ones.
...kills every living plant that she touches: Get her a garden gnome. I personally find these a little eerie, but at least

there'll be something living in your mom's garden. Until someone tries to

steal the creepy dude, that is. Oh well.

.cries every time you come home: Find a picture of the two of you

and put it in a cute frame. Extra points if it's a picture from your
fifth birthday party. Guaranteed tear jerker.

...lives close to Stanford: Take her out to brunch. Nothing's bet
ter than some quality time over hash browns. Even better?
Make your mom brunch, kid style. Remember when you'd
"cook" your mom a bowl of rice krispies, put it on a tray with
some burnt toast and bring it to her in bed? Those were the days.
Sure she'll be grossed out, but she'll smile for the memories. Aw

....would hangout at Moonßean's as opposed totheCoHo: Purchase
her some tea from teaforte.com. Both the quirky, pyramid shape of the
tea hags and their delicious contents are guaranteed to delight.

... likes to cook: Get her a set of personalized spatulas from williams-sonoma.com. Nothing says"I
love you" like a set of spatulas, especially if you have them inscribed with "1 love you."

..likes to eat: Bake her something! Ask your friends in co-ops, row houses or Mirieleesif you
can make use of their kitchens. If you're lazy or only know how to use an Easy Bake Oven.
Amazon.com will help you order every kind of food imaginable. In two clicks you can order

your mom some baklava and a jar of Mister Mustard

Hot Mustard. Mmmm

...likes Oprah: Get her something from Oprah's list
of Favorite Things, the "O List" if you will (just
Google it). Unfortunately (but not surprisingly)

Oprah's favorite things are pretty expensive, but
there are a few good deals hidden in there. The cate-

gories range from food to technological gadgets, so there is

something for everyone. I'd be wary of the clothes category, though

No one should have that much cashmere in their wardrobes. Nor own 10 velour sweat suits. Yikes.

...enjoys reading: Do not buy her the first bargain book you see at Borders, no matter how pretty the pictures are. It

you don't know what kind of books your mom likes,
, . u :.. .i 4 l :

maybe you should just get her a nice book-

mark. Or, if she doesn't have much time

for reading, consider getting her a
subscription to a magazine.

...likes Oprah AND reading:

Duh. Check out the list of
reads from Oprah's
Book Club. Most of

her chosen books

even come in Oprah
versions with spe
cial Oprah-ap-

proved book jack
ets and Oprah
generated read
ing questions.
No, but seriously,
she has pretty
good taste for the
most part. You

won't find the "Da
Vinci Code" on this
list.

.spends more time on

her laptop than you do:
Check out the gadgets at

funusb.com. They're all lun and they are all powered by a USB drive (surprise!). They have everything from

heated gloves to an aromatherapy oil burner. I kid you not.

.has a sweet tooth but also likes flowers: Instead spend-

ing lots of money on a bouquet of roses, go with a

cookie bouquet instead. Not only are these adorably

decorated sugar cookies absolutely delicious, but

they also don't require water or confusing pack-

ets of soggy plant food. http://www.cookiesby-

design.com/

....wears her "Stanford Mum" T-shirt at least
onee a week: Send her a paper you got an "A"
on or your best problem set along with a set of
snazzy Stanford magnets. This way she am

proudly display your work where it belongs: on
the refrigerator. With any luck, your new achieve- v

ment might edge out the state capitals test that's
been hanging out on the fridge door since second

grade. Oh Boise.

...is more athletic than Sporty Spice: Get her an armband for
her svelte iPod. Or, make her a fun workout mix CD. Think more
Paula Abdul and less Belle and Sebastian.

...loves your siblings more than you: Re-wrap the crappy present she gave you for your last birthday.
And then send it to her. Oh, snap!
...is a Mom: Get her a card. 1 haven't once met a mom who doesn't enjoy a good card. And I've met a

lot of moms in my day. Try to actually spend time looking through them rather than just deftly choosing gj
a cheesy one. General rule of thumb: If the card looks like a bottle of Pepto Bismol mated with a flower
patch, put it down. Now. On second thought, maybe you should just make a card. ou could even use this ar-

tide to make a collage (see, it's useful after all!).

...thinks Mother's Day is a capitalist scam: Celebrate! You're off the hook. But
you really should scud her something. Like maybe one ol those atiocious pink
i cards. It would be...ironic.

' ...understands that you are a poor and/or lazy college student: just call her on
Mother's Day. If you actually have a conversation with her rather than rushing

off after a chorus of "I'm fine," "I have SO much to do" and"I need sleep." she

will probably appreciate the gesture even more.
