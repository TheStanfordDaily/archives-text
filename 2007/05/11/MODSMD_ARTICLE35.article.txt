## Turning into your mom: Trust Natalie, it happens to the best of us 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION MOM 
I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but
it was definitely way too soon. I've turned
into my mother.
1 mean, it was hound to happen, right?
We're close, I'm an only child, etc, etc. I just
didn't expect to perform identity theft until
later in life. Like crap-l-need-to-start-dving
mv hair later in life.
The startling realization that I was slowly
becoming my mother first dawned on me to
ward the end of high school. 1 was at the mall
with a friend and I was sitting outside of a fit
ting room, wailing for her to try on some
clothes. While 1 was waiting. I overheard a
middle-aged woman wondering which outfit
she should purchase to wear for her son's
wedding. She caught my eye and 1 smiled.
One minute later we were discussing the mer
its of the pistachio pant suit over the navy
blue sheath. Just as she was telling me about
how scared she was that her first son was fi
nally getting married, my friend walked out of
her fitting room. As 1 waved good-bye to the
nice lady, confident that she would choose the
pant suit after our heartfelt discussion, my
friend stopped me in my tracks.
"Who were you talking to? Do you even
knowher," she hissed into my ear with a look
of horror.
(I was familiar with that look. It was the
same one I had given my mother every time

she decided to break The Random Stranger
Rule: Thou shalt not strike up conversations
in public with people thou knowest not. She'd
be walking around Target, searching for
some toothpaste, and five seconds later, she'd
be engaged in conversation with a woman
who had just gotten uivorced and was break
ing down in the cosmetics aisle. When these
random people wrote down their phone num
bers or asked my mom for a hug, I'd hide in
the corner, completely embarrassed that this
gregarious weirdo was my mother. Hadn't
she learned not to talk to strangers? These
people didn't even have candy).
"Nope, but I do now." I replied to my
shocked friend. So much for The Random
Stranger Rule. Good-bye, sweet youth.
I think moments two and three of the moth
er metamorphous occurred in grocery stores.
Not only did I find myself looking for a man
ager any time there was some squashed pro
duce on the ground (someone could slip!),
but 1 also found myself breaking Article I of
The Random Stranger Rule: Do not engage
in personal conversation with the cashiers
and bag bin s. How many times had I pretend
ed to be fascinated with some celebrity's
crack addiction as my mom chatted with the
cute boy behind the counter? I never under
stood my mom's justification: "They're
bored, Natalie. Nobody talks to them." I
thought she just enjoyed watching me squirm.
But these days 1 do it, too (and not because
the bag boys are cute, mind you. Most them

are still waiting for their voices to change).
Now that I'm farther away from my mom,
it's only getting worse. I've definitely noticed
more warning signs since coming to college (it
didn't help that my freshman dormmates jok
ingly called me "Mom"). Take losing things,
for example. To say that my mom goes nuts
when she loses something is a gross under
statement. I still remember that time that I al
most got my first tardy in elementary school
because my mom lost a pair of scissors and
wouldn't leave the house until she hunted
them down. At first I'd try to help her find
whatever she'd lost, but then I'd just give up
and tell her it would turn up eventually, right?

Bad idea. Only after losing a few things of
my own while at Stanford have 1 come to

realize how misplacing something can put
an annoying blemish on even the best
planned day (especially if you were raised
by a crazy person). Just ask any of my
friends how annoying 1 got when 1 lost my
copy of "Civilization and its Discontents"

for one day during freshman year. Or
how I turned into Oscar McGrouchy
face a few weeks ago when I couldn't find
my camera.

The scariest warning sign has emerged
only recently. My current roommate is a bit
scatterbrained at times (1 love you. Susie) and
forgets to do things like take out the trash or
return a few dining hall cups that we had in
our room. One day. 1 was taking out the recy
cling and gave out a little sigh. She overheard

me and said, "If you just asked me to do it, 1
totally would. I just forget sometimes."
"Oh no, it's fine," 1 replied. But my first
thought was, "I shouldn't have to ask you!"
And my second thought was, "Get out of my
head. Mom!"
Although I'm somewhat startled every
time I find myself morphing into my mom. I
guess I'm finally starting to be OK with it.
After all, if 1 have to be like somebody,
there's really no other person I'd rather be

like. I'm just hoping the

gray hairs will hold off

P'";
for little bit longer.
Sigh.
