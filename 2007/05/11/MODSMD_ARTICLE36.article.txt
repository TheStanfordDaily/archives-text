# WHEN YOUR MUSICAL TASTE COLLIDES WITH MOM'S
## 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION MOTHERLY MUSIC LOVER 
My mother took me to GWAR when 1 was
four years old. I am pretty sure I still have the

flier on ray wall back
home. She's an old '80s
metalhead and while nor
mal parents were yuppie
ing it up, my mom was
giving the finger to the
system and teaching her
second child all about
rock 'n' roll. While other
little girls were getting
ballerina-themed birth
days:! got punk bands
playing at my party. The
short version of this story
is that my mother is about
100 times cooler than 1
could ever hope to be.
Her youth was spent at
cheap concerts in the
Cow Palace before the
days of $4 waters, while

112 V | • 1
my youth was spent wishing I were at a concert
while writing innumerable AP English papers
and being class president. My mom was kicked
off the checrleading squad while I have never
even had detention. When I was 13, she decid-

Ed that we should go to
Ozzfest. In case that did
n't sink in, I didn't ask
my mom to take me to
Ozzfest. No, she an
nounced one day that
we were going to go see
Ozzy Osbourne and
Marilyn Manson. Oz
zfest was my first con
cert that 1 remember
anyway, and it was with
my mom.
With this kind of in
fluence. it is almbst im
possible to rebel against
your mother. There is
nothing I can do that
shocks her because she
has seen it all. 1 never
had the urge to listen to

music she hated or to sneak
out of the house. Our rela
tionship is still based on mu
tual respect, and lest you
think she is some kind of
"friend mom," I will point
out that 1 only got to go to

Ozzfest and the other gigs I attended in high
school when I had straight As. There were
rules in my house, and they were respected, but
ray mom also believed in having a good time
and exposing her kids to good music. Plus, she
married my stepdad — who, besides being a
classically trained musician, has also been in
one of the raunchiest rock bands you've ever
seen. He's since given up on that raunchy stuff
only to decide to join an "outlaw" country
band that my mom now manages. (This was all
information I received when my parents
picked me up during Parents Weekend and
while I was trying to find time to not be study
ing)
I'm still envious of my mom and her life ex
periences. She says she is living vicariously
through me. but it's closer to the other Way
around. This is often reflected in my taste in

music, which to this day includes everything
from Beethoven to my secret love of Nine Inch
Nails. My mom and I have gone through devel
opmental stages in our musical taste together.
She and I like the same type of music (though
I now listen to indie rock and my mother now
listens to more country). My first opera was
also with my mom and she bought my first CD
(which was Sublime, not Britney Spears).
When I was little, 1 was in awe of my mom;
as I have reached adulthood, this awe has
turned into a sort of adult friendship based on
the common tastes we share. Granted, it's a
friendship in which my mom calls me when I
am on the way to a concert to make sure I got
there safely and to remind me that the home
less in Berkeley are dangerous, but at least we
can go to shows together and make fun of
preppies on TV.
