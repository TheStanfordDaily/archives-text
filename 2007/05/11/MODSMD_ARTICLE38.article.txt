# MIKA: From shy to fly!
## 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION CARTOONER 
British pup singer-songwriter Mika's
unique style has drawn comparisons to a
broad range of other musicians, includ-

ing David Bowie and fellow Brits

Elton John, Freddie Mercury
and Robbie Williams. At the

ripe age of 23, Mika's debut
and self-proclaimed "coming

of age" album. "Life in Car
toon Motion," reveals not

only this young singer's

spot-on pop sensibility, but
also his five-octave range
voice and impressive song
writing skills.

Mika, originally

Michael Penniman, was
born in Lebanon to an
American father and

Lebanese mother. His family
moved to Paris and later Lon
don. Due to a traumatic
hostage situation with his fa
ther in the Kuwaiti U.S. Em-

bassy. his family's frequent moves and

bullying at school, Mika stopped talking
and was home-schooled by his mother
for a year. Embracing music, he began
formal music training, and even look
lessons from a Russian opera profession
al. 11c eventually performed at the Royal
Opera House, also creating a jingle for
Orbit gum and music for British Air
ways. After a single year at the Royal
College of Music in London, Mika left to
pursue his music career, releasing the EP
"Relax. Take It Easy" in 2006, and fol
lowing it up in February 2007 with his
debut album "Cartoon Motion."
Once a shy child. Mika has become an
international personality known for his
charisma, showmanship and singer/song
writer talent. "Cartoon Motion" has
gone platinum in the UK. and his lead
single. "Grace Kelly" has been #1 for five
weeks. Featuring implausibly catchy
beats, quirky and insightful lyrics, and an
overall very distinct sound, "Cartoon
Motion" has catapulted Mika into the in
ternational music scene. In fact, the
struggle to maintain his unique sound
against the pressures of record compa
nies is the subject of his single "Grace

Kelly." He sings "1 tried to be like Grace
Kelly/ But all her looks were too sad./ So
1 tried a little Freddie/ I've gone identity
mad./1 could be brown. 1 could be blue, I
could be violet sky,/1 could be hurtful, I
could be purple,/1 could be anything you
like." (Mika refers to Oueen's Freddie
Mercury, whose influence is perhaps
most obvious in his music.)
As in Grace Kelly. Mika's lyrics are
playful, fun and memorable, but also in
trospective, sad, and even sarcastic at
times, providing "Cartoon Motion" a
full, varied range of moods and sounds
that many pop albums lack. The foot-tap
ping "Big Girl (You arc Beautiful)"
lauds the bigger-boned, pizza-eating
women of the world. In the mournful, vi
olin-filled "Any Other World." Mika
sings about disillusionment, while the
quiet, waltz-tempo "Over My Shoulder"
is about loneliness. In the 'Yellow Sub
marine"-meels-"Eleanor Rigby" ballad
"Billy Brown." Mika sings about the
married Billy Brown who has a gay affair
and ultimately leaves both wife and lover
for the beaches of Mexico â€” the upbeat
brass background and simple, falsetto

chorus drip with irony. On the statements
made in his lyrics, Mika remarked you
can "tell the truth in song and people are
less pissed off that if you were to say it to
their face."
To these wide-ranging songs, add a de
cidedly experimental clothing style,
bizarre music videos, a vibrant creative
cartoon album cover, and incredible en
ergy, and an intense sense of showman
ship. When asked about hison-stage style
he responded, "Am 1 a showoff? Yeah. I
want to pull as many tricks as 1 can.
whether it's vocally or musically or just
gimmick-wise...confetti cannons that last
for 20 minutes."
Whether I get showered in color paper
or not, Mika's talent shines through both
recorded and live in song after song. The
impressively articulate, humble and tal
ented singer has put forth a tour-de-force
debut album that most bands would hope
for at any point in their career, let alone
right at the beginning.
