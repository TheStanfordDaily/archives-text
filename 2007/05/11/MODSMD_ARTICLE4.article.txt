## GONE TO THE DOGS 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a baseball season fraught with disap
pointments, Stanford's conference record has
to be near the top of the list. Picked by the pre
season coaches' poll to finish third in the
standings, the Cardinal is winless in all six Pa
cific* 10 Conference series this season.
With only two series remaining in confer
ence, the opportunities for that elusive series
win are dwindling. Ibis weekend. Stanford
(19-24. 4-14 Pac-10) gets a shot to break the
streak at home against Washington (25-21,8-
7).
"I definitely don't want totakean'o-fer' for
my senior year." said the Cardinal's sole sen
ior. Ryan Seawell. "But we're not thinking
about the past. We're playing for pride right
now."
Stanford has recent history on its side with
six straight wins against the Huskies, dating
back to the 2005 season, but Washington
comes to the Bay Area with momentum. ITie
Huskies are winners of five of their last six
games. And the team recently got an emotion
al lift when it set a new Pac-10 attendance
record for a single game with 10.421 fans. Last
Friday's record-setting night was the first-ever
college baseball game played at Safeco Field,
home of the Seattle Mariners.

GAMI NOTES: Stanford is still looking for its first senes win
against a Roc-10 opponent and will get its second-to-last
chance against Washington. The Cardinal currently owns a
six-game win streak against the Huskies, having notched a
series sweep in each of the past two years. Freshman Jeff
Inman is slated to get the start Fnday night and is the only
regular starter for Stanford currently in possession of a win
ning record (4-2).

Junior right hander Erik Davis came up just short against Wash
ington State on Monday in a 4-2 loss. The Cardinal will need
more solid pitching this weekend to topple Washington.
a 5-1 record.
"They get some of the best ath
letes in the Northwest," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"They'll be very tooled with guys
who hit for power, throw hard and
have a little speed. They have been
inconsistent at times this season,
but they probably have some hopes
of making postseason play."
Meanwhile, Stanford continues
to struggle with its pitching staff.
The Cardinal is last in the confer
ence in ERA (6.31) and opposing
batting average (.315). In contrast,
Washington — seventh in the con
ference with a 4.92 ERA — is al
most a full run-and-a-half better.
"For whatever reason — and if
we knew the reason, we would
change it — we're giving up an im
mense amount of hits per innings
pitched," Marquess said. "If you
look over the past 30 years at our
numbers, they are all almost the
same. We pitch about 500 innings
and give up about 500 hits, but we're
nowhere close. We're at least 100
hits over [that mark]."
Looking for answers, junior Erik
Davis thinks the Cardinal's biggest
problem is a tendency to let people
on base early.
"The biggest problem so far is
we've let too many leadoff batters
on," Davis said. "When you start the

inning off with nobody out and a
guy on, I think they score like 70
percent of the time. When we've
been able to throw well, it's because
we've gotten that leadoff guy out."
Stanford can also build on two
solid pitching outings from this past
weekend against Washington State.
Freshman Jeff lnman pitched a
complete game for a 6-4 win on Sat
urday, while Davis threw 6.2 innings
of shutout baseball before giving up
three runs in the seventh inning of a
4-2 loss.
lnman (4-2,5.10) will once again
take the hill tonight against Jason
Erickson (3-1, 3.18). Lefty Jeremy
Bleich (1-8, 6.07) takes on Elliott
Cribby (1-1, 5.59) on Saturday,
while Sunday's starting pitchers
have yet to be announced.
With only 11 games remaining,
Stanford must finish 9-2 to avoid its
first losing season since 1993. The
Cardinal is also guaranteed to finish
under .500 in conference for the
second straight year.
"With other teams who have
struggled like we have this year, you
could tell that a lot of them have
given up and were just going
through the motions," Davis said.
"But we haven't given up. We go out
and fight. It's big for us, because it
shows some of our team's character
as a whole, and that's something to
be proud of."
First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
tonight at Sunken Diamond.

GAMI NOTES: Stanford is still looking for its first senes win
against a Roc-10 opponent and will get its second-to-last
chance against Washington. The Cardinal currently owns a
six-game win streak against the Huskies, having notched a
series sweep in each of the past two years. Freshman Jeff
Inman is slated to get the start Fnday night and is the only
regular starter for Stanford currently in possession of a win
ning record (4-2).


TAYLOR CONE/The Stanford Daily
Junior right hander Erik Davis came up just short against Wash
ington State on Monday in a 4-2 loss. The Cardinal will need
more solid pitching this weekend to topple Washington.
a 5-1 record.
"They get some of the best ath
letes in the Northwest," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"They'll be very tooled with guys
who hit for power, throw hard and
have a little speed. They have been
inconsistent at times this season,
but they probably have some hopes
of making postseason play."
Meanwhile, Stanford continues
to struggle with its pitching staff.
The Cardinal is last in the confer
ence in ERA (6.31) and opposing
batting average (.315). In contrast,
Washington — seventh in the con
ference with a 4.92 ERA — is al
most a full run-and-a-half better.
"For whatever reason — and if
we knew the reason, we would
change it — we're giving up an im
mense amount of hits per innings
pitched," Marquess said. "If you
look over the past 30 years at our
numbers, they are all almost the
same. We pitch about 500 innings
and give up about 500 hits, but we're
nowhere close. We're at least 100
hits over [that mark]."
Looking for answers, junior Erik
Davis thinks the Cardinal's biggest
problem is a tendency to let people
on base early.
"The biggest problem so far is
we've let too many leadoff batters
on," Davis said. "When you start the

inning off with nobody out and a
guy on, I think they score like 70
percent of the time. When we've
been able to throw well, it's because
we've gotten that leadoff guy out."
Stanford can also build on two
solid pitching outings from this past
weekend against Washington State.
Freshman Jeff lnman pitched a
complete game for a 6-4 win on Sat
urday, while Davis threw 6.2 innings
of shutout baseball before giving up
three runs in the seventh inning of a
4-2 loss.
lnman (4-2,5.10) will once again
take the hill tonight against Jason
Erickson (3-1, 3.18). Lefty Jeremy
Bleich (1-8, 6.07) takes on Elliott
Cribby (1-1, 5.59) on Saturday,
while Sunday's starting pitchers
have yet to be announced.
With only 11 games remaining,
Stanford must finish 9-2 to avoid its
first losing season since 1993. The
Cardinal is also guaranteed to finish
under .500 in conference for the
second straight year.
"With other teams who have
struggled like we have this year, you
could tell that a lot of them have
given up and were just going
through the motions," Davis said.
"But we haven't given up. We go out
and fight. It's big for us, because it
shows some of our team's character
as a whole, and that's something to
be proud of."
First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
tonight at Sunken Diamond.
