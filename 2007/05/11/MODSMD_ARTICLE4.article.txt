In a baseball season fraught with disap
pointments, Stanford's conference record has
to be near the top of the list. Picked by the pre
season coaches' poll to finish third in the
standings, the Cardinal is winless in all six Pa

ence, the opportunities for that elusive series
win are dwindling. Ibis weekend. Stanford
(19-24. 4-14 Pac-10) gets a shot to break the
streak at home against Washington (25-21,8-
7).

my senior year." said the Cardinal's sole sen
ior. Ryan Seawell. "But we're not thinking
about the past. We're playing for pride right
now."

six straight wins against the Huskies, dating
back to the 2005 season, but Washington
comes to the Bay Area with momentum. ITie
Huskies are winners of five of their last six
games. And the team recently got an emotion
al lift when it set a new Pac-10 attendance
record for a single game with 10.421 fans. Last
Friday's record-setting night was the first-ever
college baseball game played at Safeco Field,
home of the Seattle Mariners.

-15 in base-stealing attempts this year.
