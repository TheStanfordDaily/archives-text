## DUCKS DOWN CARD No. 20 Oregon tops No. 16 Stanford, 5-4, in extra innings 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 16 Stanford Softball team will finish
below .S(X) in the Pacific-10 Conference after
losing to No. 20 Oregon last night. Stanford
dropped the extra-innings game. 5-4. despite
out-hitting the Ducks 12-7.
Senior left fielder Jackie Rinehart and junior
second baseman Tricia Aggabao each went 3-
for-4, but their efforts were not enough for the
Cardinal. Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
struck out nine but also walked five and hit a
batter in addition to surrendering seven hits.
ITie Cardinal (33-17-1,7-11-1 Pac-10)came
agonizingly close, but could not muster a run in
the bottom of the eighth inning after Oregon
(41-16. 6-13) took the lead to start the extra
frame. With one out and runners on first and
third. Ducks lett fielder Lovena Chaput
smoked a double to the right field warning
track, scoring Neena Bryant.
Penna retired the next two batters to give
the Cardinal a chance in the bottom frame, and
her offense responded. Sophomore designated
player Maddy Coon hit a single to center before
freshman right fielder Shannon Koplitz forced
an error from the Oregon shortstop with a hard
grounder.
After a grounder moved Coon to third,
freshman catcher Rosey Neil I smacked a line
drive to right that looked like it could end the
game, but it fell a few feet foul. A few pitches
later. Neill grounded into a game-ending dou
ble play.
Stanford has only two regular-season games
left — not enough to get to 11 conference wins
and even its record.
Last night's game started with a bang, with
the scoreboard reading 4-3 Stanford after just
two innings, before settling down in the middle
frames. Penna threw a wild pitch with runners
on second and third to give Oregon a 1 -0 lead to
start the game, but the Cardinal came storming
back in the bottom of the first. Rinehart. Ag

Coon then hit into a fielders-choice, forcing
Smith out at second, but scoring Aggabao from
third. Haber followed her home to make it 3-1
after an error by Oregon second baseman Suzie
Barnes.
But Oregon would answer, scoring one run
ner from first on a double to deep right-center
field, and then capitalizing on a two-out error
by senior shortstop Lindsey Key with a runner
on second. Key had to rush her throw after col
lecting a little suuib to the left side, and missed

GAME NOIES: The Cardinal is assured of a losing season
after dropping a one-run decision in extra innings against
the Ducks. Stanford ace Missy Penna walked five and also
struck a batter, while giving up seven hits, despite showing
some flashes of dominance as she struck out nine. This
weekend's home games against the Beavers will be the
last last for the Cardinal this season, as seniors Jackie
Rinehad and Lindsay Key will face their final competition at

After a pair of rare, scoreless in

leadoff batter in an inning got on
base. The base-runner, Sari-Jane

ular season tonight and tomorrow

the top of the seventh inning with an
RBI double to right-center field.

in the Pac-10 at .272, one point
