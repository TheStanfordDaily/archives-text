# Crew looks to top Bears, Southern Cal in Pac-10
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford women's crew teams will each
have a chance at a championship title this week
end in Rancho Cordova. Calif. Racing on the
Lake Natoma course, the women's lightweight
team will look for an easy victory at the Pacific
Coast Rowing Champions on Saturday, while
the varsity women's team faces a much more
challenging field the next day in the Pacific-10
Conference Championships.
"Things have built up beautifully to [the Pac
-10]." said varsity head coach Yasmin Farooq.
"'Our training program was designed so that we
could be at our best by this time of year, and 1
think we are."
Sunday morning, the No. 18 Cardinal will
square off against five other Pac-10 teams
among the top 20 nationally: top-ranked South
ern California, No. 8 California, No. 18 UCLA,
No. 16 Washington and No. 20 Oregon State.
Of the teams, Stanford has bested both the
Bruins and Beavers — at the San Diego Crew
Classic and at a dual match in Eugene, Ore. two
weekends ago — but has yet to conquer the

Lady Trojans and Bears. Both teams left the
Cardinal in third in San Diego, while Cal also
defeated the women in April's Big Row.
The Bears have a strong reputation among
both the Cardinal and the entire rowing com
munity. having won three straight conference ti
tles and last year's national title.
"Cal had a slow start to the season, but
they're a national power and they've come
back, showing that we can't underestimate
them." Farooq said.
At last year's Pac-10 Championships, all four
Stanford teams advanced to the finals, but only
the varsity four could snatch a medal — bronze.
The varsity eight started off with the lead in its
race, but fell to third and lost that standing mid
way through to Washington and Washington
State. The Cardinal finished fifth, just 4.4 sec
onds ahead of UCLA. California took the top
spot.
Ibis year, however, USC is expected to be
the team that sets the standard at the Pac-10
Championships. No. 1 in the nation, the Lady
Trojans will likely leave the real competition for
second place, especially with national champi
onships on the horizon.

"USC is No. l.so how the rest of the Pac-10
does relative to them is going to determine how
many berths we get to the NCAA." Farooq said.
No. 18 Stanford may not have the accom
plishment of USC or Cal, but Farooq is confi
dent in her "up-and-coming" team's abilities,
especially in light of its improvements through
out the season.
"You can definitely say that Stanford is com
ing in as the underdog, but it's a wonderful place
to be." Farooq said.
Farooq also mentioned how that "up-and
coming" status has been recognized among the
Pac-10 rowing community with the varsity
eight's third seed for the weekend, ahead of
many teams that the Cardinal ranks below na
tionally.
"Still, we're going to have to throw down two
solid races on Sunday." she added.
One day before then, the No. 3 lightweight
women's team will most likely have an easier
time at the Pacific Coast Rowing Champi
onships. also on Lake Natoma. Stanford's top
competition for the PCRC will be California

GAME NOTES The Cardinal women's crew team will
go for a conference title this Sunday against Ore
gon State, UCLA, USC, California and Washing
ton. Stanford will hope to unseat its archrival Cal,
which has won the conference for the past three
seasons, and captured a national championship
last season. The Cardinal's lightweight squad will
also have chance to capture a Pacific Coast Row
ing Championship on Saturday, facing off against
the Golden Bears and Loyola Marymount, most
notably.

Women's crew will face a tough challenge this weekend as it takes on defending national champion California and the top-ranked Women of Troy this weekend in the Pac-10 Championships.
and Loyola Marymount.
The Cardinal has soundly beaten
both teams this season — California
by 11 seconds in the Big Row and
LMU by IS seconds in the Winder
mere Classic. Unsurprisingly, light
weight head coach A 1 Acosta is excit
ed for the weekend's prospects.

"LMU has gotten faster as the
season has progressed, but we're still
confident," he said. "I'd just say that
we're cautiously optimistic."
With that attitude, the Cardinal is
approaching the PCRC as a check
point at the end of its season, in
preparation for the real competition
to come: The IRA Regatta in June,
where it will face top-ranked Wiscon
sin and No. 2 Princeton (both of
which the Cardinal has lost to this
season).
A win with a bit of a challenge this

weekend will give Stanford the drive
to step it up as the national champi
onships near.
"After every race, you hope to
come out of the water with a little
something to work on. something
that didn't go so well," Acosta said.
"•This weekend will show us if we did
everything we could in preparation,
and if not. it'll make us ready to go for
the IRA."
