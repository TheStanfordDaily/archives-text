# Nash is simply the best
## 
### 
The NBAs best player is also
one of its smallest.
Standing at 6-foot-3 (Let's not
forget the two or so inches that are
mysteriously added after measure
ment), and looking more like a jani
tor than an NBA point guard, Steve
Nash isn't your most likely candidate
for the league's Most Valuable Play
er Award.
At least that's what most voters
this year thought when they voted
Nash's former teammate. Dirk Now
itzki, as this year's MVP. (ESPN
leaked the story yesterday, explain
ing that the award will be announced
this coming TUesday.)
And all of those who didn't vote
for Nash wouldn't be too hard
pressed to change their decisions.
After all. Nash is the anti-star in the
Wade-Bryant-Leßron era.
He doesn't travel with a posse
numbering in the double digits, he
lacks good hygiene — licking his
hands and then touching the ball
every time he runs down the court
and, well, he's Canadian.
Nash didn't jump straight into the
stratosphere of popularity the way
most of the N BA's current crop of su
perstars did. 1 le spent four years just
down the road at Santa Clara, under
Coach Dick Davey. refining his clas
sic point-guard game. In college.
Nash shined in the obscure West
Coast Conference, but never made
headlines.
He was great in college — one of
those four-year guys who put his
hours in, progressed and made him
self a fine player. To most, it seemed
like a fine college player was the
most that Nash would ever be. After
his first four mediocre seasons in the
NBA, the short, unhygienic Canadi
an wasn't exactly spectacular.
But what's great about Nash is
that he doesn't need his youth, flash
or ridiculous athleticism to beat you.
The older he's gotten, the better he's
become. Nash hasn't started produc
ing like an All-Star until the last few
years; like a fine wine, the 33-vear-old
just keeps getting better with age.
Playing with giants who are big
ger. faster and stronger than him.
Nash captured the NBA's MVP
award last season in leading the high
powered Phoenix Suns' attack. And
don't be fooled: Dirk may be winning
the award this year, but it belongs to
Steve.
Nash's influence on the Suns' at
tack is invaluable. Just watch a quar
ter of a Suns' game and you'll realize
how mediocre Phoenix would be
without its nifty point guard. He
turns the decent, athletic players
around him into stars. Look at the
development of otherwise scrubs in
players like Leandro Barbosa. Raja
Bell and Boris Diaw, for example.
The Suns are the kind of team you're
going to be telling your grandchil
dren about, and Nash is the master
mind behind all of the madness.
Take away Nash from the Suns
and you have a kinetic mess. Take
away Dirk lrom the Mavs and you
have a team that would still cruise
into the playoffs — and in the West
ern Conference, no less.
As a point guard. Nash isn't the
greatest at any one thing. Allen Iver
son is a better dribbler, Jason Kidd
might be a more adept passer and
Chauncey Billups might be more of a
clutch shooter. But Nash under
stands the game. He sees things be
fore they happen, and then, ensures
that they do happen.
I could spend the rest of this col
umn bashing Dirk and how he
