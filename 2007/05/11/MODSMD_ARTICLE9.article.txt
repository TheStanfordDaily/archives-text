# GOLF BRIEF
## Golf jumps out to early lead at NCAA tourney 
### 
Going head-to-head yesterday with
the par-71, 6,234-yard Entrada golf
course in St. George, Utah seemed to
greatly benefit the No. 14 Stanford
women's golf team. With a new frame of
mind, the Cardinal finished the first
round leading all 21 teams at the 2007
NCAA West Regional.
Stanford's first-round tally of 287
(three over par) gave it a four-stroke
edge over the host. No. 15 Brigham
Young,as well as No. 11 Oklahoma State
(291). Rounding out the top eight are
No. 4 Pepperdine (292). No. 1 Arizona

State (294), UC-lrvine (295). No. 18
New Mexico (298) and No. 20 Denver
(299).
Of the eight west-regional teams
ranked among the nation's top 25. only
No. 7 Florida (309) is in danger of not ad
vancing to the NCAA Championships.
Florida is currently nine strokes back of
the final advancing spot.
Among individual scores, Stanford
senior Jennifer Tangitphaiboontana is
currently in sole possession of second
place with a two-under 69. Tangitphai
boontana currently trails Oklahoma
State's Pernilla Lindberg (68) by just
one stroke.
Fellow senior Lauren Todd ended
the first round tied for 10th with a one
over 72. while sophomore Mari Chun
and freshman Catherina Wang each trail
Todd by a stroke (73). This slim margin

dropped both into a tie for 18th.
Rounding off the Cardinal lineup is
freshman Angela King, who scored an
eight-over-par 79 to tic for 73rd.
At the other two NCAA Regional
competitions, the rest of the Pacific-10
Conference is dominating, as expected.
In the Central, Southern California
holds a six-stroke lead over Indiana
University and Texas Christian. Mean
while. in the East, UCLA is maintaining
a three-stroke advantage over the rest of
the pack.
Though Stanford's four-stroke lead is
encouraging, the Cardinal now faces the
burden of maintaining it over the next
two days of competition. Nonetheless, it
appears as though Stanford is hitting on
all cylinders at just the right time.
