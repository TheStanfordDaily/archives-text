## Reading for Recreation 101: your new summer class 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION 
As the hours of sunlight in
crease and upper brain stem ac
tivity withers proportionately,
summer makes its indisputable
debut. Within a month, much of
our academic stress will dissipate,
to be replaced by the new stress
of summer jobs, family life and
blistering sunburns. 1 imagine
you'll remain literate over the
course of the summer (some of us
will even be rereading our C'S
readers to recapture the magic of
105). but 1 suggest you take the
opportunity to savor some of the
literature the English Depart
ment or your IHUM class might
overlook. The world — starting
with your local Barnes & Noble
— has plenty to offer. I've com
piled a few of my favorite recre
ational readings to prod you
along the path.
1) Carlos Ruiz Zafon's "Shadow
of the Wind": If you haven't read
Ruiz Zafon's Spanish bestseller.

you missed the
boat. Consider
ing that Ruiz
Zafon wrote the
original in his na
tive Spanish, it's
hard to rational
ize how the world
of young protag
onist Daniel

Sempere could possibly he de
scribed so vigorously in English.
Mid-century Barcelona explodes
on the page as a hackdrop for Ruiz
Zafon's elaborate mystery, begin
ning with the mysterious book
burning of the relatively unknown
writer Julian Carax. We watch

Daniel mature as he is innocently
co-opted by Carax's puzzle. While
he plays devoted detective, the
stor\ is every hit as much about him
as it is about enigmatic Carax and
his lost love.
2) Tobsha Learner's "The Witch
of Cologne ": Ruth has Elazar Saul

— cr
walks a fine line
as a Jewish mid
wife in 17th cen
tury Catholic
Cologne. In fact,
her precarious
role is such that a
successful deliv
ery results in ac
cusations of
witchcraft, while

failure would result in her death. As
the Spanish Inquisition encroaches
on Cologne and a lifelong enemy of
her late mother heads up the initia
tive, Ruth loses everything. She
does, however, find love in the
process, and more importantly gains
a name for herself as a scientist as
well as a midwife. Learner's plot is
so intricately woven that no simple
summary could do it justice; you'll
have to read it. If you do pick up a
copy, though, don't blame me for
the dirty parts. I didn't write them,
and 1 did warn you.

3) Karen Ya
mashi t a ' s
"Through the Arc
of the Rain For
est": The fact that
I first encoun
tered Yamashita
in an STS class
doesn't make the
read any less fla-



vorful. In fact, appreciating the lay
ered complexity of Yamashita's
magical realism is a key component
to enjoying her work. "Through the
Arc" is peppered with the absurd,
from a male protagonist with a plas
tic ball spinning in front of his fore
head to Amazonian monkeys shoot
ing each other with machine guns.
You'll smile within the pages, and
then reflect once the cover's closed:
the perfect summer read.

4) Eugenia
Price's Georgia
Trilogy: If we
can't read rich.
Southern-set his
torical romances
in the dog days of
summer, when
can we partake?
Within tins dubi
ous sub-genre of

"real literature," Price is the best.
Hie first book, "Bright Captivity."
opens with the celebration of Anne
Couper's eighteenth birthday in St.
Simon's, Georgia. Who better to
crash the party than the British sol
diers, fresh arrivals for the oilier
shindig going on in that era — the
War of 1812? Without ruining the
story (admittedly, it isn't that origi
nal to begin with — but don't let that
deter you). Anne relates particularly
well to a British soldier. The story
continues with "Beauty from Ashes"
and "Where Shadows Go." None of
the three are less than 550 pages.
5) Anton Myrer's "Once an
Eagle": I've been saving the best for
last. This book catalogs the life of
Sam Damon, an "ordinary Ameri
can" who is first defined and then de

stroyed by his connection with the
military. Damon enlists in World War
II as a small town teenager, and his
experience on the European front
earns him the near-worship of his
community upon his return. He de
cides to continue his career in the
military in large part because he has
no other competing idea of w hat to
Jo. Nlyrer. a war veteran himself, fol
lows Damon through World War II
and the Korean

Conflict, painting
a tragic portrait
of a dignified
man trapped by
honor and habit.
For those who
might construe
"Once an Eagle
as the literary
equivalent of
"The Fourth of

July." meant as a sharp critique of the
military. Myrer deviates from expec
tation. Ultimately. Damon is the
most convincing soldier-hero I've
ever encountered in fiction. The
most harrowing scenes involve his
inflexible honor: he persuades his
best friend, for example,to return to
the front and not to desert — only
to watch him die days later. 1 had a
friend (okay, my brother-in-law)
read this book. He started it on a
plane ride to a family vacation in
Germany, and he finished it hiding
from his brother and sister in the
hotel bathtub later that night. It's
that good.
These five books, some of my fa
vorites for one reason or another,
should get you started. If you run out
of ideas (or simply don't enjoy the
historical-fiction-skew of my recom
mendations). solicit advice from a
bookseller. 1 used to work ai Barnes
& Noble. Besides the 40% off
Christmas-time discount, the best
thing about working there was con
necting people with a book they
truly might enjoy.

piled a few of my favorite recre
ational readings to prod you
along the path.
1) Carlos Ruiz Zafon's "Shadow
of the Wind": If you haven't read
Ruiz Zafon's Spanish bestseller.

you missed the
boat. Consider
ing that Ruiz
Zafon wrote the
original in his na
tive Spanish, it's
hard to rational
ize how the world
of young protag
onist Daniel

Sempere could possibly he de
scribed so vigorously in English.
Mid-century Barcelona explodes
on the page as a hackdrop for Ruiz
Zafon's elaborate mystery, begin
ning with the mysterious book
burning of the relatively unknown
writer Julian Carax. We watch

Daniel mature as he is innocently
co-opted by Carax's puzzle. While
he plays devoted detective, the
stor\ is every hit as much about him
as it is about enigmatic Carax and
his lost love.
2) Tobsha Learner's "The Witch
of Cologne ": Ruth has Elazar Saul

— cr
walks a fine line
as a Jewish mid
wife in 17th cen
tury Catholic
Cologne. In fact,
her precarious
role is such that a
successful deliv
ery results in ac
cusations of
witchcraft, while

failure would result in her death. As
the Spanish Inquisition encroaches
on Cologne and a lifelong enemy of
her late mother heads up the initia
tive, Ruth loses everything. She
does, however, find love in the
process, and more importantly gains
a name for herself as a scientist as
well as a midwife. Learner's plot is
so intricately woven that no simple
summary could do it justice; you'll
have to read it. If you do pick up a
copy, though, don't blame me for
the dirty parts. I didn't write them,
and 1 did warn you.

3) Karen Ya
mashi t a ' s
"Through the Arc
of the Rain For
est": The fact that
I first encoun
tered Yamashita
in an STS class
doesn't make the
read any less fla-



vorful. In fact, appreciating the lay
ered complexity of Yamashita's
magical realism is a key component
to enjoying her work. "Through the
Arc" is peppered with the absurd,
from a male protagonist with a plas
tic ball spinning in front of his fore
head to Amazonian monkeys shoot
ing each other with machine guns.
You'll smile within the pages, and
then reflect once the cover's closed:
the perfect summer read.

4) Eugenia
Price's Georgia
Trilogy: If we
can't read rich.
Southern-set his
torical romances
in the dog days of
summer, when
can we partake?
Within tins dubi
ous sub-genre of

"real literature," Price is the best.
Hie first book, "Bright Captivity."
opens with the celebration of Anne
Couper's eighteenth birthday in St.
Simon's, Georgia. Who better to
crash the party than the British sol
diers, fresh arrivals for the oilier
shindig going on in that era — the
War of 1812? Without ruining the
story (admittedly, it isn't that origi
nal to begin with — but don't let that
deter you). Anne relates particularly
well to a British soldier. The story
continues with "Beauty from Ashes"
and "Where Shadows Go." None of
the three are less than 550 pages.
5) Anton Myrer's "Once an
Eagle": I've been saving the best for
last. This book catalogs the life of
Sam Damon, an "ordinary Ameri
can" who is first defined and then de

stroyed by his connection with the
military. Damon enlists in World War
II as a small town teenager, and his
experience on the European front
earns him the near-worship of his
community upon his return. He de
cides to continue his career in the
military in large part because he has
no other competing idea of w hat to
Jo. Nlyrer. a war veteran himself, fol
lows Damon through World War II
and the Korean

Conflict, painting
a tragic portrait
of a dignified
man trapped by
honor and habit.
For those who
might construe
"Once an Eagle
as the literary
equivalent of
"The Fourth of

July." meant as a sharp critique of the
military. Myrer deviates from expec
tation. Ultimately. Damon is the
most convincing soldier-hero I've
ever encountered in fiction. The
most harrowing scenes involve his
inflexible honor: he persuades his
best friend, for example,to return to
the front and not to desert — only
to watch him die days later. 1 had a
friend (okay, my brother-in-law)
read this book. He started it on a
plane ride to a family vacation in
Germany, and he finished it hiding
from his brother and sister in the
hotel bathtub later that night. It's
that good.
These five books, some of my fa
vorites for one reason or another,
should get you started. If you run out
of ideas (or simply don't enjoy the
historical-fiction-skew of my recom
mendations). solicit advice from a
bookseller. 1 used to work ai Barnes
& Noble. Besides the 40% off
Christmas-time discount, the best
thing about working there was con
necting people with a book they
truly might enjoy.
