## Reading for Recreation 101: your new summer class 
### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION 
As the hours of sunlight in
crease and upper brain stem ac
tivity withers proportionately,
summer makes its indisputable
debut. Within a month, much of
our academic stress will dissipate,
to be replaced by the new stress
of summer jobs, family life and
blistering sunburns. 1 imagine
you'll remain literate over the
course of the summer (some of us
will even be rereading our C'S
readers to recapture the magic of
105). but 1 suggest you take the
opportunity to savor some of the
literature the English Depart
ment or your IHUM class might
overlook. The world — starting
with your local Barnes & Noble
— has plenty to offer. I've com
piled a few of my favorite recre
ational readings to prod you
along the path.
1) Carlos Ruiz Zafon's "Shadow
of the Wind": If you haven't read
Ruiz Zafon's Spanish bestseller.

you missed the
boat. Consider
ing that Ruiz
Zafon wrote the
original in his na
tive Spanish, it's
hard to rational
ize how the world
of young protag
onist Daniel

Sempere could possibly he de
scribed so vigorously in English.
Mid-century Barcelona explodes
on the page as a hackdrop for Ruiz
Zafon's elaborate mystery, begin
ning with the mysterious book
burning of the relatively unknown
writer Julian Carax. We watch

Daniel mature as he is innocently
co-opted by Carax's puzzle. While
he plays devoted detective, the
stor\ is every hit as much about him
as it is about enigmatic Carax and
his lost love.
2) Tobsha Learner's "The Witch
of Cologne ": Ruth has Elazar Saul

— cr
walks a fine line
as a Jewish mid
wife in 17th cen
tury Catholic
Cologne. In fact,
her precarious
role is such that a
successful deliv
ery results in ac
cusations of
witchcraft, while

failure would result in her death. As
the Spanish Inquisition encroaches
on Cologne and a lifelong enemy of
her late mother heads up the initia
tive, Ruth loses everything. She
does, however, find love in the
process, and more importantly gains
a name for herself as a scientist as
well as a midwife. Learner's plot is
so intricately woven that no simple
summary could do it justice; you'll
have to read it. If you do pick up a
copy, though, don't blame me for
the dirty parts. I didn't write them,
and 1 did warn you.

3) Karen Ya

of the Rain For

read any less fla-
