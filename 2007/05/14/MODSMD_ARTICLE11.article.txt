## Dan Handler writes "Adverbs" brilliantly 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION GRAMMARIAN 
Daniel Handler's latest novel

"Adverbs" is a book
about love, and reading it
is a little like falling in
love as well. The book is
by turns thrilling, contus
ing, poignant, aggravat
ing. hilarious and ulti
mately enthralling.
Most readers are fa
miliar with I landler only
as Lemony Snicket. the
author of "A Series of
Unfortunate Events,"
one of the smartest and

funniest lines of young adult fiction
on the market. However, over the
past few years. Handler has been
making a name for himself in the

adult market too —his last two
novels are being adapted into films,
and "Adverbs" has been winning
rave reviews.

The book is a se
ries of seventeen inter
woven short stories, the
subjects and tones of
which vary, but which
share common charac
ters, themes and motifs.
Each story is titled an
adverb (cute, huh?)
and describes a differ
ent way that you can
love: "Immediately,"
"Wrongly." and "Not
Particularly'" are a few

notable examples.
One of the first things you'll no

tice in these stories is that Handler
can really turn a phrase. He has a
dazzling and often circuitous mas
tery of language that sends you reel
ing. Each of the stories in "Ad
verbs" has at least a few solid belly
laugh moments. How can you find
fault with the author who notes:
"She looks at the guy and says the
name of her comic strip like you
might say the name "Adolf Hitler' it
somebody said. Who's that Ger
man guy who was in charge of all
the Nazis?'
Underlying the stunning word
play, though, is an awareness of
human emotion and relationships
that roots the most absurd of one
liners in deep pathos. The chapter
"Briefly," for example, ties a man's
mental breakdown on a golf course
to the primal and universal experi
ence of rapturous teenage lust.
And "Soundly," one of the book's
most luminous pieces, describes
the platonic love between two
friends, one of whom is dying, in
tragic-comic heart-wrenching
strokes.
One of the most satisfying as
pects about this novel is how will
ingly it transcends traditional rules
of the genre. At a recent reading at
Stanford, Handler addressed the
pitfalls of being a novelist in an in
creasingly television-oriented soci
ety. and suggested that the new

breed of writers must continually
create ways to keep their medium
separate and thriving.
This novel does precisely that:
the narrative is driven by half
truths and intentionally mislead
ing statements, creating a mystery
narrative. The point of view shifts
from story to story, characters
reappear in unlikely settings, mul
tiple characters have the same
name, and — violating all known
laws of novel-writing—Handler
frequently breaks the fourth wall,
not in the role of the narrator, but
as the author himself. It it sounds
to you like the novel is confusing,
chaotic and a little convoluted,
don't be alarmed: it absolutely is.
The reader can do much detective
work stitching together the
chronology of the narrative and
identities of the characters, but
Handler throws enough continuity
into the collection to make this
work satisfying and ultimately re
warding.
The interweaving of the separate
narrative chunks is exceedingly
clever — and in the end, the novel's
greatest flaw is that it is perhaps too
clever. Handler comes off as a bril
liant writer who smugly estimates his
own brilliance and occasionally
overburdens the narrative with un
necessary references or dead-end
motifs.
But in spite of this. "Adverbs" is
smart and entertaining, stuffed with
likeable (and similarly-named) char
acters. and it gives hilarious and
touching examples of the many
facets of love in our lives.
