## Not just for kids: an analysis of the Hollywood Cape Machine 
### VICTOR FUSTE COMIC ANALYST 
Comic hook fans like myself have a bitter
sweet relationship with I lolly wood these days.
On one hand, nothing is more exhilarating
than watching the polychromatic heroes leap
out of the pages of our childhoods onto the sil
ver screen. On the other hand, that very nos
talgia makes even the most miniscule of
changes to each property's respective mythos
tantamount to blasphemy. (Case in point, the
collective brick shat by the internet fanboys
when Sony announced that Spider-man was to
have organic web-shooters.) There is nothing
worse than seeing Hollywood mangle your
most beloved of superheroes. But despite the
fickle nature of fans. Hollywood continues to
produce comic book- based films. In light of
the recent overwhelming box-office success of
critically panned films like "Ghost Rider" and
"Spider-Man 3," perhaps an investigation as to
why comic book movies are so popular with
Hollywood is in order.
If the banality of the 1 lollywood product in
recent years is any indication, things in Tinsel
town run on equal parts formula and pre
dictability. You see it in the preponderance of
sequels that choke up the multiplexes during
the summer months — "Pirates of the
Caribbean 3.""Rush I lour 3," and "Harry Pot
ter 5" are only the most recent of examples,
f-.ver since the entertainment industry discov
ered that the superhero was a profitable block
buster vehicle with "Superman: The Movie"
over thirty years ago. tights have been the
name of the game. I lowever.it has only been in
the last ten years or so that these superhero
movies —particularly with heroes from the
Marvel universe — have become super lucra
tive franchises, spawning merchandising and li
censing opportunities galore.
I"he main reason? The stories. Comics as
we know them arguably get their start with Su
perman's first appearance in Action Comics
#1 in 1938,and Hollywood is still using his ori
gin story over seventy years later. Characters
like Batman. Spider-man and the X-men have
nearly a half century's worth of stories ripe for
exploitation. All any of the major studios need
to do to cash in on the trend is to buy the cre
ative license to the character and to hire a
screenwriter (probably David Goyer) to
translate it for the screen.This summer's "Fan
tastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer" is
based on a story by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby
done way back in 1966. If Hollywood is still
doing stories from the 60s, we'll be seeing
many more comic based movies in the years to

come. Why? Comics are movie-ready stories.
They are full of the necessary ingredients for a
successful movie — action, romance and
memorable characters. There is such a ready
pool of material, it is a veritable goldmine.
Comic book movies also tap into a cinema
of spectacle. The concept of the superhero is
particularly suited to the idea of "bigger is bet
ter" — especially from the technical stand
point. Special effects wizardry breathes life
into these (literally) two-dimensional charac
ters and in return, the characters allow for
greater exploration into SFX technologies. For
instance, though "Ghost Rider" was one of the
worst movies ever to be produced, the effects
that turned Nicolas Cage into a burning
skulled spirit of vengeance were groundbreak
ing and a treat to watch. Audiences go to see
these films to see what these characters would
look like in the real world — the suspension of
disbelief necessary for the films has been min
imized by the imaginations of the special ef
fects companies that make even the most fan
tastical things believable.
In a world where everything can be pack
aged and sold, the superhero movie is a mar
keting homerun. First off, these characters al
ready have an established audience which is
guaranteed to camp outside the local theater
for opening day tickets. Comic book fans are
some of the most rabid fans out there — only
heroin addicts and Yankees fans are as fervent
about their passions. Secondly, the characters'
likenesses can be plastered on everything from
lunchboxes to Band-aids and because of the
prevailing cultural awareness of these charac
ters. the image on the box of whatevers' will
boost both the sales of the product and.
retroactively, ticket sales. Deals struck by the
marketing departments from the studios dis
seminate their products into every conceivable
purchasable item and niche market so that, be
fore you know it, you have handed over your
money, thereby feeding the machine and fund
ing the further perpetuation of these products.
Marketability of a film isn't just about corn
Hakes and Pop Tarts, though. It's also about
who you can sell. When you attach a recog
nized name like F.dward Norton as the Incred
ible Hulk or Tobey Maguire as The Amazing
Spider-Man, star power combines with super
powers for surefire hits. Studios will often mar
ket a film based solely on the talent associated
with it but because names like The Fantastic
Four are already embedded in the cultural lex
icon, it is like having an extra big name celebri
ty to place on the marquee.
LJnlike the latest Spielberg or Tarantino
flick, these movies appeal to an extremely

wide demographic.Take "Spider-Man 3" as an
example. It made $59 million opening day and
$426 million worldwide in its first week alone.
Why? Because the love story appeals to young
women and the action sequences appeals to
men (especially those aged 18-39). Kids want
to go because Spider-Man is on their cereal
box. Parents want to go because they grew up
reading comics. Twenty-to thirty-year old vir
gins want to see it because they can't get a girl
friend and want to sublimate their sexual re
pression into watching two hours of men in
tights. Everyone wins. Especially Sony.
But this isn't entirely a bad thing. The suc
cess of comic franchises like "Spider-Man" al
lows studios to tap lesser-known comic proper
ties.The single frame of Alan Moore's psychot
ic anti-hero Rorschach inserted into an inter
net-exclusive trailer for Zach Snyder's "300"
set the internet aflame with rumors about
"Watchmen."Though my own personal desire
is to never see the "'Citizen Kane' of comics"
turned into a film because it is untranslatable
(it is a commentary on form),if there is even an
inkling of interest, chances are it will be made.
Who knows what countless comics, main
stream or underground, are out there waiting
