## Editorial Board The 						100 days 
### 
In American politics, presidents are often
judged by their actions during the first
KM) days of their administrations. Ihis
"1(X) days" — the first six percent of their
four-year-long term — is a time of intense
activity as untried executives work hard to
prove their relevance to the electorate and
set the tone for their administrations.
Proving their importance is an issue that
ASSU senators know a lot about. The
young organization (Priyanka Sharma
chairs what is only the ninth Undergraduate
Senate in Stanford's long history) seems to
still be struggling to make itself relevant to
the vast majority of the student body.
Senators and executives lament that
their failures are exaggerated by sensation
alist news coverage while their victories go
unsung. ASSU stories are often buried in
the back pages of The Daily during the year,
and although most students can probably
credit last year's executives with at least one
accomplishment, considerably fewer can
name something that the Senate has done
for the undergraduates that make up its
constituency.
Every year for about a month, elections
help raise the profile of the oft-ignored stu
dent government. This spring,however.the
drama has continued as intense debates
over chair assignments have exposed the
nascent rifts that many predicted would ac
company a non-majority SOCC-endorsed
Senate. While some have argued that high
lighting these divisions is counterproduc
tive. the fact that they exist is cause for
some celebration rather than anger. It

means that multiple viewpoints are being
represented.
Students who feel that the Senate is not
the domain of a single organization are
more likely to care about what it does.
ASSU coverage has proliferated this year,
not just in the pages of The Daily but also in
the newly-created Unofficial Stanford Blog
and The Review, which is run by newly
elected Senators Luukas lives and Stuart
Baimel. Comments on the online media
show that students are more actively engag
ing with the Senate and its agenda.
Student leaders who lament the apathy
of the student body: This is your best chance
to change our minds. More eyes are focused
on you than ever before at this time of year.
Rather than waste the remainder of the
quarter with proto-partisan bickering, seize
the opportunity to do something substan
tive. Move forward with real changes be
fore the year expires and a long summer
causes the undergraduate community to
once again forget that is has a Senate.
The most important issues you champi
oned are not divisive ones. There is near
universal consensus on OSA and new Old
Union reform. If the Senate acts quickly on
these issues, it will set a unified tone for the
rest of the year and establish a reputation as
an organization with the power to really ac
complish things.
Because each Senate only serves for a
year, the "Hundred Days" of the Ninth Un
dergraduate Senate are more like a month.
Take that time to convince the electorate
that vou matter.
