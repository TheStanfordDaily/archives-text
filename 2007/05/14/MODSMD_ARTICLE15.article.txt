# Life as a train
## 
### 
Last week, three friends and 1 decided to
take a six-day vacation to the south of
France. Hut being poor college students, we
needed to cut down costs. And what better
way to save money than to travel exclusive
ly by train. Not only is it cheaper than flying,
but if you take night trains, you can also
avoid paying for hotels. Unfortunately, trav
eling by train has its downside.
The first in a series of travel disasters was
a seven-hour night train from Bordeaux to
Marseilles. In accordance with our thrifty
trip-planning, we opted for reclinable seats
ovei bunk beds. Big mistake. And to top it all
off. of the train 's many bathrooms, only one
had running water and only one had soap.
Unfortunately, they were not one and the
same. So a simple procedure like washing
one's hands involved getting soap from one
bathroom and carrying it across the train to
the other.
When we finally got to Marseilles.it was
5 a.m.. we were cranky and everything was
closed. Not wanting to spend four hours
hanging around the station, we decided to
go to Avignon. We had originally booked
tickets to Avignon for the following day. but
assumed that switching them shouldn't be a
problem. Mistake number two. Apparently,
the ticket salesman in Paris had given us
some kind of ridiculous travel itinerary, put
ting five different trips over the span of four
days all on one ticket. When the saleswom
an in Marseilles saw the tickets, she called

over her boss, who threw his hands in the air
and yelled. "Oh la la la la la la." And 1
thought that was just a stereotype. I ie was so
shocked that he actually made photocopies
of the tickets to show his friends. After much
confusion, during which the boss tried to tell
us that there was a mistake, the tickets were
no good and we would have to pay for
everything all over again, we were able to
change our Avignon ticket for only 10 extra
euros.
We hoped the relatively short, one-hour
train to Avignon would be without incident.
We were wrong. As the conductor checked
tickets, he approached a woman sitting in
front of us. Before he had a chance to open
his mouth, she began shouting something in
an incomprehensible mix of French and
English.The phrases "Never in the evening!
Iliis is scandalous! I am tired!" kept pop
ping up in her hysterics. Three conductors
gathered around, trying to calm her down
