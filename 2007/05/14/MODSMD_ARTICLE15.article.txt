# Life as a train
## 
### 
Last week, three friends and 1 decided to
take a six-day vacation to the south of
France. Hut being poor college students, we
needed to cut down costs. And what better
way to save money than to travel exclusive
ly by train. Not only is it cheaper than flying,
but if you take night trains, you can also
avoid paying for hotels. Unfortunately, trav
eling by train has its downside.
The first in a series of travel disasters was
a seven-hour night train from Bordeaux to
Marseilles. In accordance with our thrifty
trip-planning, we opted for reclinable seats
ovei bunk beds. Big mistake. And to top it all
off. of the train 's many bathrooms, only one
had running water and only one had soap.
Unfortunately, they were not one and the
same. So a simple procedure like washing
one's hands involved getting soap from one
bathroom and carrying it across the train to
the other.
When we finally got to Marseilles.it was
5 a.m.. we were cranky and everything was
closed. Not wanting to spend four hours
hanging around the station, we decided to
go to Avignon. We had originally booked
tickets to Avignon for the following day. but
assumed that switching them shouldn't be a
problem. Mistake number two. Apparently,
the ticket salesman in Paris had given us
some kind of ridiculous travel itinerary, put
ting five different trips over the span of four
days all on one ticket. When the saleswom
an in Marseilles saw the tickets, she called

over her boss, who threw his hands in the air
and yelled. "Oh la la la la la la." And 1
thought that was just a stereotype. I ie was so
shocked that he actually made photocopies
of the tickets to show his friends. After much
confusion, during which the boss tried to tell
us that there was a mistake, the tickets were
no good and we would have to pay for
everything all over again, we were able to
change our Avignon ticket for only 10 extra
euros.
We hoped the relatively short, one-hour
train to Avignon would be without incident.
We were wrong. As the conductor checked
tickets, he approached a woman sitting in
front of us. Before he had a chance to open
his mouth, she began shouting something in
an incomprehensible mix of French and
English.The phrases "Never in the evening!
Iliis is scandalous! I am tired!" kept pop
ping up in her hysterics. Three conductors
gathered around, trying to calm her down


Degtyareva
Vraisemblable
and asking for her ticket. She did not
have one and continued to scream.
Finally, shrugging their shoulders,
they left her alone. As she got off the
train at the next stop, she turned to
us and said in English. "Sorry about
the noise. Pay and shut up. that's
what they want you to do."
The following few trains — to
Aries. Cannes. Nice, Monaco
passed without incident. Except
none had either soap or running
water. But, being more experienced
travelers now, we came prepared
with sanitizing gel and large bottles
of water.
And then we decided to go to Italy
for dinner. Mistake number three. We
bought roundtrip tickets to Ven
timiglia, a small coastal town on the
French/Italian border. The train was
short, cheap and passed through the
corniches of the Riviera, giving us
breathtaking views of the Mediter
ranean. We had a wonderful evening
and ate delicious pasta and gelato in a
restaurant overlooking the beach.
Then, as we got back to the station to
catch the last train back to Nice, we

noticed the word "soppresso"flashing
next to our train. To our great dismay,
the French railway workers had gone
on strike and all of the trains back to
Fiance were cancelled. Suddenly, our
two-euro train turned into a 100-euro
cab. Ah, French socialism at its finest.
I .uckily, the strike was resolved in
time for our next and final train from
Nice back to Paris. Another night
train and again without beds, this one
was slightly more comfortable, as ap
parently we were the only ones dumb
enough to spend 11 hours in reclin
able seats and so had most of the train
to ourselves. But then, one of the only
other passengers, who looked home
less, came over and asked us for cake.
We pretended not to speak French,
clutched our suitcases, and fell asleep
fearing for our safety.
But apart from the various travel
glitches, gallivanting through
Provence, swimming on a secluded is
land off the coast of Cannes, sharing
in the glamour and royalty of Mona
co and tanning on the idyllic beaches
of Nice were well worth it. Plus, it's
hard to complain about any vacation
that ends with a trip back to Paris.
