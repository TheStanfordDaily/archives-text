# Why the SNRP rules

I'm one of those people who gives up eas
ily. Name an activity, and I've probably
tried it out for size, made a decent run at
it.and then quit. Soccer, piano, the French
language, college classes that force me to
exert myself beyond a minimal level — you
name it and I've dumped it.
So you probably wouldn't fancy me a
crossword puzzle fanatic. Crossword puzzles
are strenuous tests of both mental muscle
and the ability to recall useless knowledge
about tributaries of European rivers, actress
es from movies my parents are too young to
have seen, and snooty French phrases. In
short, solving a really devilish crossword is
akin to self-mutilation. Add to the mix the
fact that I'm a notorious quitter, and you've
got yourself a mismatch.
Yet. somehow. I've managed to transcend
the mismatch. You wouldn't expect it. but the
truth is I'm addicted to the darn puzzles. So
much si), in fact. I dare say crosswords are all
/ have to live for. As the spring quarter work
load sets in. I begin to pine for summer (while
it's sunny out. all I want to do is frolic), a glo
rious respite when midterms and papers jet
off to Hawaii and stay far. far awav for three

solid months of boozing and cruising. As for
me, I'll be free to lounge around the un-air
conditioned slice of heaven known as Man
zanita Park and devote my full attention to
remembering the names of more exhilarat
ingly obscure French tributaries.
Naturally, you ask me what sort of cross
word puzzles 1 do. Under normal circum
stances, I would proudly respond. "Why, the
Times, of course." And you, being from South
ern California, would probably say. "Oh. the
LATimes?"Then I would invariably scoff and
inwardly chortle,"The LA Times? Who reads
that nonsense? Those hacks are entirely re
sponsible for Tupac's botched murder case!"
No, silly, the New York Times crossword
puzzle, edited by Will Shortz,enigmatologist

extraordinaire! The amateur puzzle-solver's
main event. The middle-aged professional's
joie de vivre on Sundays — due reward for a
week's worth of drudgery whose novelty
wore off a year or two after you walked the
Wacky Walk, when all you value in life is your
expensive New York Times newspaper sub
scription (though you live in San Francisco),
your breakfast in bed. and your Toyota Prius.
The l imes crossword puzzle is an American
institution. It's one I'm proud to be a part of.
I forgot to mention one small little detail.
I probably won't be doing the New York
Times crossword puzzle anymore. Even
though it was, for over a year, the delight of
my life at Stanford, that pleasure may soon
be gone. And 1 bet all of you,being avid Daily
consumers, know where it's going. It's going
straight to Special Fees Hell.
The Stanford News Readership program
failed to get Special Fees for a whole host of
reasons, many of which have already been
bandied about in the Daily to various degrees
of zeal. Blame it on the grad students (we
pompous B-school students have our own
