# Op-Ed
## An open letter to President Hennessy 
### 
Dear Dr. I lennessy.
'bank you for your op-ed piece May 4 on pre
venting future tragedies such as Virginia Tech. It was
forwarded t<> me by one of your students who suf
fered the loss of a friend, my son Patrick Wood.
Patrick graduated from Stanford in 2005 with dis
tinction in math. He loved the school, had many
triends there, and was even treated for depression
there. In January before he graduated.he was hospi
talized for. ;is he explained to me. "having thoughts

pital for five days, but proclaimed that he was OK.

trist in charge at the hospital agreed that Pat was
OK and should be permitted to return to school as
long ;is he continued therapy. I le saw a therapist and
a psychiatrist on campus and renewed his medica
tion I lis mood was up and down, but he continued
an active social life and good communication with
us I le was excited ;ibout an internship ;it Siemens in
Berlin. Gerni;iny, which he began after graduation.
He had applied for the internship through the Stan
ford ( enter in Berlin. I le suspended his therapy for
the summer with plans to return in September for
the computer science co-term program, but he loved
Berlin too much to leave just yet. Another friend
from Stanford was arriving to work in the American
Embassy there, and so Patrick obtained a leave of
absence and continued to work at Siemens through
the fall.
All the while, he made many friends, spoke and

wrote fluent German, went to concerts with col
leagues at Siemens, and maintained close contact
with the Stanford Center. He could often be heard
playing the piano there just as he had done at I laus
Mitt. I le wrote about a "mini-depression" before he
came home to Connecticut for Christmas vacation.
We thought ;i medication refill would be the answer.
His twin sister and older brother were home, along
with cousins, aunts, and uncles. It was the usual busy
but tun time. Pat later told friends it was "relaxing"
and that it was good to get away from the city for a
while. On December 27th. he went to New York City
to see another good friend from Stanford. He re
turned to Berlin on the 28th. In January he wrote
about a "mini-breakdown." We had many emails. I
called, but could not contact him by telephone. His
last email to me was on January 26th. Humboldt
I niversity had requested additional information on
his application as a grad student there. He took it as
rejection, told me he might be returning to Stanford,
and asked me to wish him luck. He answered no
more emails after that. He saw friends on the week
end of the 28th and 2 ( )th. He did not return phone
calls after Tuesday the 31st. His friend, who worked
;it the American Embassy and who lived a block
away, became worried. He called and went to Pat's
apartment several times the following weekend. He
called the Stanford Center on Monday morning.
ITiey called the police to break into the apartment.
By that evening, the police found Pat. He had died
of carbon monoxide poisoning on TUesday, January
31st.

Patrick was one of many graduates that June. He
was one of many more who were going on to gradu
ate school. The school cannot be responsible for
every student on campus or every new graduate. I
am under no illusions about who was responsible for
his treatment and for what he did. It was Patrick
alone who decided to stay in Germany, who decided
to suspend treatment, and ultimately who decided
that suicide would relieve his depression. I have
tried to retrace his steps continuously in my mind
ever since we were notified on February 6,2006. On
that day. his friend and others from the Stanford
Center identified him. They called a Stanford resi
dential housing director in Palo Alto, and he called
us. Both the Stanford School in Berlin and Palo Alto
had memorial services for him in February and
March of last year. As you can see, the school was
very much involved in both the life and in the death
of my son.
Please do not mistake my comments for blame.
Maybe no one could have prevented his loss, but I
have learned that it is the very nature of his disease,
and of Cho's at Virginia Tech, that should cause us to
be hyper-vigilant. Students who are depressed, even
brilliant and loving students like Pat. cannot func
tion reliably because the source of their decision
making process is under attack. They are making
flawed decisions because the very same mechanism
used to make these decisions is malfunctioning.
There is an anatomical difference between a healthy

ceremony, prior to his January 2006 suicide in Germany.
brain and a depressed brain. It is a
detectable, visible difference, and
yet it is only a part of the brain, for
many decisions appear "normal." It
is those normalities which lulled me
into thinking that Pat would get
help, that he would take care of him
self, that he would certainly see how
magnificent he was. that he had just
graduated from Stanford with a 3.9
average and a major in math, that
his friends loved him. that he had
had the best childhood we could
provide, that he had the brightest
future of anyone. How could he not
be happy? The answer is because
depression does not operate on the
same assumptions.
1 have had to change my own no
tions of well-being because they
failed Pat. He did not get help in
Germany because he could not.The
decisions he needed to make were
not possible with the oppression and
pain he was feeling. Although he was
physically able to get to a doctor or
call a therapist.just as he had done at
Stanford, those functions needed
motivation, and it was his motivation
which had been destroyed. All the
drive, the talent, the brilliance that
had won him a full scholarship to
Pomfret School, that had gotten him
perfect SAT's, that had made him a
valedictorian, that had made him a
merit scholar, that had gotten him
into Stanford, that won him a schol
arship there, that had gotten him into
the Krupp Internship program in
Germany and then into Siemensâ€”
all the motivation he needed to
achieve academic and social success
was no match for this disease. I le had
sought treatment, and it had not
worked, so he turned inward until he
isolated his thoughts, his wants, and
his pain, until he was feeling nothing
but the sense of control which sui
cide brings.
1 think your comments about
psychological services are a wel
come response. Pat's life was saved
the first time he had major depres
sion and was hospitalized by one of
the counselors on campus, and 1 am
deeply grateful. Hut 1 would hope,
in the wake of Pat's agonizing loss
and the frightening possibility of
another Virginia Tech. that we come
away with a few additional realiza

tions. I have spent every day trying
to do the same thing.
Mainly I hope that we under
stand that suicide victims are not in
sane. They function as well as they
need to function. Almost everything
about Pat was normal on the out
side. even the relationship problem
that preceded his death.
A truth I have learned too late is
that we have to go to them. Pat
needed someone to take him for
help. Just because he did it the first
time didn't mean he would do it
again. As a matter of fact, there was
less chance he would get help be
cause he was weakened from the
first depressive episode.
Because 1 have learned that de
pression is a terminal illness. 1 would
hope that we could change the
meaning of the term from a sad
dened state of mind, to the danger
ous. insidious threat that it is. Most
people who commit suicide have
been depressed and have attempted
it beforehand. As 1 think Patrick and
the Virginia Tech incident made
abundantly clear, we are ill
equipped to detect the severity of
the disease and. therefore, the likeli
hood that these victims will com
plete a suicide. Anatomical detec
tion would give us empirical data
that we need to make a more accu
rate diagnosis, certainly more accu
rate than relying on a patient to rate
himself on a depression scale as is
now commonly the case. I low many
other diseases have to be self-diag
nosed when a patient is least able?
And finally, a thought about
treatment. A newspaper article last
year pointed out that patients who
were "cured" had to endure an aver
age of four combinations of medica
tion and therapy before finding one
that succeeded. That means a great
deal of trial and error at a time when
any failure can be misconstrued as a
reason for hopelessness and self
harm.
The implications for a university
are complex. How much do you
reach out, especially if the patient
does not seek treatment? 112 low do
you know the severity of the depres
sion? If we are relying on averagely
intelligent people to pick up on the
cues, we will never succeed. 1 know
because I am one of those failures. I
will hate myself forever for what 1
did not know about depression, for
what 1 missed, for what 1 did not do
for my son. but 1 also know that
there are a lot of people saying the

same thing about Cho. They are all
blaming themselves.just as i am. be
cause what passes for non-threaten
ing behavior before suicide be
comes pockmarked with danger
signs afterward. I should have gone
to Berlin. 1 should have called his
friends. I should have done a lot of
things and so should they who knew
Cho. But we don't because we don't
know they are necessary. We don't
know they mean life or death, and
we will not know until we have reli
able detection.
Maybe the lesson that arises
from Patrick, a favorite son of Stan
ford. is that students within Stan
ford programs should be better
monitored no matter where they
are. Whether they are in Palo Alto
or Germany, follow-up and care
(and this is most important) should
be initiated by the school. Why? Be
cause seriously depressed students
are less likely to seek treatment.
They consider themselves to be de
fective instead of legitimately sick
because that's what depression
does. It convinces them that there is
no hope, and therefore no cure, but
that is really depression talking. We
have to break through that. We have
to go to them, physically and men
tally. If you go to the website for The
American Federation for Suicide
Prevention,you will see their advice
for preventing suicide. The suicidal
person cannot be expected to inde
pendently seek treatment. Some
body must take them.
If we can come away with any in
sight from Patrick and C'ho.it is that
follow-up was woefully lacking. 1
shudder to mention their names in
the same sentence, but similar ques
tions in their aftermaths compel me.
Why didn't the school follow up on
Pat's treatment in Germany even
though he was in a Stanford intern
ship program? The answer: Stan
ford was relying on Pat, and so was
I. That cannot continue. When stu
dents become patients, the school
must monitor them as long as they
are connected to the school and
wherever they are connected. De
pressed students â€” even the best,
like Pat â€” are simply not capable.
Depressed students don't seek
treatment because they are, not sur
prisingly. depressed. This is how de
pression kills, and in the process, it
robs functioning until there is very
little on which to rely. How do we
know when that functioning is
gone? We don't, and that is why it is

up to lis to know more. It is simply in
our own best interest to detect and
treat more actively and accurately. If
1 have come away with anything
from the loss of my beautiful son it
is this: Depression will kill anybody,
but the burden is on usto know
whom.
When Pat graduated in 2005,0ur
whole family came to Stanford to
wish him well: my husband and I
from Connecticut, his older brother
Colin and Colin's friend Julie from
Washington State, his twin sister
l.ibby from Vermont,and his grand
parents Dr and Mrs. David Rimer
from Los Angeles. We all came to
congratulate him, and we were im
pressed with the beautiful cere
monies and meaningful events, but
as 1 read your op-ed piece, the mem
ory of meeting you at graduation
stood out the most. You seemed like
a caring person, even during the
brief moments in which we had our
photograph taken with you. We
commented afterward how wel
coming you and your wife had been,
even though you were probably ex
hausted from shaking hands and
posing for several hours. And now I
write to ask you to bring that caring
sensibility to the forefront of this
issue. Suicide is the second leading
cause of death for college students.
It weakens parents' confidence in
the safety of their children on cam
pus â€” parents, who, by the way, are
already feeling excluded from the
well-beings of their children be
cause of confidentiality. We cannot
see grades, get psychiatric records,
get tuition bills directly, or inter
vene on students' behalf. Every
thing is left up to the student, and, as
we have seen with Patrick and Cho.
we risk too much isolation.
Again, thank you for your inter
est in this issue, and thank you for
promoting the psychological well
being of your students. 1 appreciate
your focusing Stanford's public at
tention on these avoidable catastro
phes. Patrick loved Stanford dearly.
I le was grateful for the services you
did provide, and now. in his stead,
we are grateful for your continuing
efforts to protect our children.
1 invite you to visit the memorial
blog set up for Patrick by his Stan
ford friends at: http://patrickwood.

He had applied for the internship through the Stan

the summer with plans to return in September for
the computer science co-term program, but he loved
Berlin too much to leave just yet. Another friend
from Stanford was arriving to work in the American
Embassy there, and so Patrick obtained a leave of
absence and continued to work at Siemens through

that suicide would relieve his depression. I have
tried to retrace his steps continuously in my mind
ever since we were notified on February 6,2006. On
that day. his friend and others from the Stanford
Center identified him. They called a Stanford resi

us. Both the Stanford School in Berlin and Palo Alto
had memorial services for him in February and
March of last year. As you can see, the school was
very much involved in both the life and in the death
of my son.
Please do not mistake my comments for blame.
Maybe no one could have prevented his loss, but I
have learned that it is the very nature of his disease,
and of Cho's at Virginia Tech, that should cause us to
be hyper-vigilant. Students who are depressed, even
brilliant and loving students like Pat. cannot func

making process is under attack. They are making
flawed decisions because the very same mechanism
used to make these decisions is malfunctioning.
There is an anatomical difference between a healthy

ceremony, prior to his January 2006 suicide in Germany.
brain and a depressed brain. It is a
detectable, visible difference, and
yet it is only a part of the brain, for
many decisions appear "normal." It
is those normalities which lulled me
into thinking that Pat would get
help, that he would take care of him
self, that he would certainly see how
magnificent he was. that he had just
graduated from Stanford with a 3.9
average and a major in math, that
his friends loved him. that he had
had the best childhood we could
provide, that he had the brightest
future of anyone. How could he not
be happy? The answer is because
depression does not operate on the
same assumptions.
1 have had to change my own no
tions of well-being because they
failed Pat. He did not get help in
Germany because he could not.The
decisions he needed to make were
not possible with the oppression and
pain he was feeling. Although he was
physically able to get to a doctor or
call a therapist.just as he had done at
Stanford, those functions needed
motivation, and it was his motivation
which had been destroyed. All the
drive, the talent, the brilliance that
had won him a full scholarship to
Pomfret School, that had gotten him
perfect SAT's, that had made him a
valedictorian, that had made him a
merit scholar, that had gotten him
into Stanford, that won him a schol
arship there, that had gotten him into
the Krupp Internship program in
Germany and then into Siemensâ€”
all the motivation he needed to
achieve academic and social success
was no match for this disease. I le had
sought treatment, and it had not
worked, so he turned inward until he
isolated his thoughts, his wants, and
his pain, until he was feeling nothing
but the sense of control which sui
cide brings.
1 think your comments about
psychological services are a wel
come response. Pat's life was saved
the first time he had major depres
sion and was hospitalized by one of
the counselors on campus, and 1 am
deeply grateful. Hut 1 would hope,
in the wake of Pat's agonizing loss
and the frightening possibility of
another Virginia Tech. that we come
away with a few additional realiza

tions. I have spent every day trying
to do the same thing.
Mainly I hope that we under
stand that suicide victims are not in
sane. They function as well as they
need to function. Almost everything
about Pat was normal on the out
side. even the relationship problem
that preceded his death.
A truth I have learned too late is
that we have to go to them. Pat
needed someone to take him for
help. Just because he did it the first
time didn't mean he would do it
again. As a matter of fact, there was
less chance he would get help be
cause he was weakened from the
first depressive episode.
Because 1 have learned that de
pression is a terminal illness. 1 would
hope that we could change the
meaning of the term from a sad
dened state of mind, to the danger
ous. insidious threat that it is. Most
people who commit suicide have
been depressed and have attempted
it beforehand. As 1 think Patrick and
the Virginia Tech incident made
abundantly clear, we are ill
equipped to detect the severity of
the disease and. therefore, the likeli
hood that these victims will com
plete a suicide. Anatomical detec
tion would give us empirical data
that we need to make a more accu
rate diagnosis, certainly more accu
rate than relying on a patient to rate
himself on a depression scale as is
now commonly the case. I low many
other diseases have to be self-diag
nosed when a patient is least able?
And finally, a thought about
treatment. A newspaper article last
year pointed out that patients who
were "cured" had to endure an aver
age of four combinations of medica
tion and therapy before finding one
that succeeded. That means a great
deal of trial and error at a time when
any failure can be misconstrued as a
reason for hopelessness and self
harm.
The implications for a university
are complex. How much do you
reach out, especially if the patient
does not seek treatment? 112 low do
you know the severity of the depres
sion? If we are relying on averagely
intelligent people to pick up on the
cues, we will never succeed. 1 know
because I am one of those failures. I
will hate myself forever for what 1
did not know about depression, for
what 1 missed, for what 1 did not do
for my son. but 1 also know that
there are a lot of people saying the

same thing about Cho. They are all
blaming themselves.just as i am. be
cause what passes for non-threaten
ing behavior before suicide be
comes pockmarked with danger
signs afterward. I should have gone
to Berlin. 1 should have called his
friends. I should have done a lot of
things and so should they who knew
Cho. But we don't because we don't
know they are necessary. We don't
know they mean life or death, and
we will not know until we have reli
able detection.
Maybe the lesson that arises
from Patrick, a favorite son of Stan
ford. is that students within Stan
ford programs should be better
monitored no matter where they
are. Whether they are in Palo Alto
or Germany, follow-up and care
(and this is most important) should
be initiated by the school. Why? Be
cause seriously depressed students
are less likely to seek treatment.
They consider themselves to be de
fective instead of legitimately sick
because that's what depression
does. It convinces them that there is
no hope, and therefore no cure, but
that is really depression talking. We
have to break through that. We have
to go to them, physically and men
tally. If you go to the website for The
American Federation for Suicide
Prevention,you will see their advice
for preventing suicide. The suicidal
person cannot be expected to inde
pendently seek treatment. Some
body must take them.
If we can come away with any in
sight from Patrick and C'ho.it is that
follow-up was woefully lacking. 1
shudder to mention their names in
the same sentence, but similar ques
tions in their aftermaths compel me.
Why didn't the school follow up on
Pat's treatment in Germany even
though he was in a Stanford intern
ship program? The answer: Stan
ford was relying on Pat, and so was
I. That cannot continue. When stu
dents become patients, the school
must monitor them as long as they
are connected to the school and
wherever they are connected. De
pressed students â€” even the best,
like Pat â€” are simply not capable.
Depressed students don't seek
treatment because they are, not sur
prisingly. depressed. This is how de
pression kills, and in the process, it
robs functioning until there is very
little on which to rely. How do we
know when that functioning is
gone? We don't, and that is why it is

up to lis to know more. It is simply in
our own best interest to detect and
treat more actively and accurately. If
1 have come away with anything
from the loss of my beautiful son it
is this: Depression will kill anybody,
but the burden is on usto know
whom.
When Pat graduated in 2005,0ur
whole family came to Stanford to
wish him well: my husband and I
from Connecticut, his older brother
Colin and Colin's friend Julie from
Washington State, his twin sister
l.ibby from Vermont,and his grand
parents Dr and Mrs. David Rimer
from Los Angeles. We all came to
congratulate him, and we were im
pressed with the beautiful cere
monies and meaningful events, but
as 1 read your op-ed piece, the mem
ory of meeting you at graduation
stood out the most. You seemed like
a caring person, even during the
brief moments in which we had our
photograph taken with you. We
commented afterward how wel
coming you and your wife had been,
even though you were probably ex
hausted from shaking hands and
posing for several hours. And now I
write to ask you to bring that caring
sensibility to the forefront of this
issue. Suicide is the second leading
cause of death for college students.
It weakens parents' confidence in
the safety of their children on cam
pus â€” parents, who, by the way, are
already feeling excluded from the
well-beings of their children be
cause of confidentiality. We cannot
see grades, get psychiatric records,
get tuition bills directly, or inter
vene on students' behalf. Every
thing is left up to the student, and, as
we have seen with Patrick and Cho.
we risk too much isolation.
Again, thank you for your inter
est in this issue, and thank you for
promoting the psychological well
being of your students. 1 appreciate
your focusing Stanford's public at
tention on these avoidable catastro
phes. Patrick loved Stanford dearly.
I le was grateful for the services you
did provide, and now. in his stead,
we are grateful for your continuing
efforts to protect our children.

blog set up for Patrick by his Stan

Dear Dr. I lennessy.
'bank you for your op-ed piece May 4 on pre
venting future tragedies such as Virginia Tech. It was
forwarded t<> me by one of your students who suf
fered the loss of a friend, my son Patrick Wood.
Patrick graduated from Stanford in 2005 with dis
tinction in math. He loved the school, had many
triends there, and was even treated for depression
there. In January before he graduated.he was hospi
talized for. ;is he explained to me. "having thoughts
of suicide I le was committed to the Stanford hos
pital for five days, but proclaimed that he was OK.

trist in charge at the hospital agreed that Pat was
OK and should be permitted to return to school as
long ;is he continued therapy. I le saw a therapist and
a psychiatrist on campus and renewed his medica
tion I lis mood was up and down, but he continued
an active social life and good communication with
us I le was excited ;ibout an internship ;it Siemens in
Berlin. Gerni;iny, which he began after graduation.
He had applied for the internship through the Stan
ford ( enter in Berlin. I le suspended his therapy for
the summer with plans to return in September for
the computer science co-term program, but he loved
Berlin too much to leave just yet. Another friend
from Stanford was arriving to work in the American
Embassy there, and so Patrick obtained a leave of
absence and continued to work at Siemens through
the fall.
All the while, he made many friends, spoke and

wrote fluent German, went to concerts with col
leagues at Siemens, and maintained close contact
with the Stanford Center. He could often be heard
playing the piano there just as he had done at I laus
Mitt. I le wrote about a "mini-depression" before he
came home to Connecticut for Christmas vacation.
We thought ;i medication refill would be the answer.
His twin sister and older brother were home, along
with cousins, aunts, and uncles. It was the usual busy
but tun time. Pat later told friends it was "relaxing"
and that it was good to get away from the city for a
while. On December 27th. he went to New York City
to see another good friend from Stanford. He re
turned to Berlin on the 28th. In January he wrote
about a "mini-breakdown." We had many emails. I
called, but could not contact him by telephone. His
last email to me was on January 26th. Humboldt
I niversity had requested additional information on
his application as a grad student there. He took it as
rejection, told me he might be returning to Stanford,
and asked me to wish him luck. He answered no
more emails after that. He saw friends on the week
end of the 28th and 2 ( )th. He did not return phone
calls after Tuesday the 31st. His friend, who worked
;it the American Embassy and who lived a block
away, became worried. He called and went to Pat's
apartment several times the following weekend. He
called the Stanford Center on Monday morning.
ITiey called the police to break into the apartment.
By that evening, the police found Pat. He had died
of carbon monoxide poisoning on TUesday, January
31st.

Patrick was one of many graduates that June. He
was one of many more who were going on to gradu
ate school. The school cannot be responsible for
every student on campus or every new graduate. I
am under no illusions about who was responsible for
his treatment and for what he did. It was Patrick
alone who decided to stay in Germany, who decided
to suspend treatment, and ultimately who decided
that suicide would relieve his depression. I have
tried to retrace his steps continuously in my mind
ever since we were notified on February 6,2006. On

need to function. Almost everything
about Pat was normal on the out
side. even the relationship problem
that preceded his death.
A truth I have learned too late is
that we have to go to them. Pat
needed someone to take him for
help. Just because he did it the first
time didn't mean he would do it
again. As a matter of fact, there was
less chance he would get help be
cause he was weakened from the
first depressive episode.
Because 1 have learned that de
pression is a terminal illness. 1 would
hope that we could change the
meaning of the term from a sad
dened state of mind, to the danger
ous. insidious threat that it is. Most
people who commit suicide have
been depressed and have attempted
it beforehand. As 1 think Patrick and
the Virginia Tech incident made
abundantly clear, we are ill
equipped to detect the severity of
the disease and. therefore, the likeli
hood that these victims will com
plete a suicide. Anatomical detec
tion would give us empirical data
that we need to make a more accu
rate diagnosis, certainly more accu
rate than relying on a patient to rate
himself on a depression scale as is
now commonly the case. I low many
other diseases have to be self-diag
nosed when a patient is least able?
And finally, a thought about
treatment. A newspaper article last
year pointed out that patients who
were "cured" had to endure an aver
age of four combinations of medica
tion and therapy before finding one
that succeeded. That means a great
deal of trial and error at a time when
any failure can be misconstrued as a
reason for hopelessness and self
harm.
The implications for a university
are complex. How much do you
reach out, especially if the patient
does not seek treatment? 112 low do
you know the severity of the depres
sion? If we are relying on averagely
intelligent people to pick up on the
cues, we will never succeed. 1 know
because I am one of those failures. I
will hate myself forever for what 1
did not know about depression, for
what 1 missed, for what 1 did not do
for my son. but 1 also know that
there are a lot of people saying the

same thing about Cho. They are all
blaming themselves.just as i am. be
cause what passes for non-threaten
ing behavior before suicide be
comes pockmarked with danger
signs afterward. I should have gone
to Berlin. 1 should have called his
friends. I should have done a lot of
things and so should they who knew
Cho. But we don't because we don't
know they are necessary. We don't
know they mean life or death, and
we will not know until we have reli
able detection.
Maybe the lesson that arises
from Patrick, a favorite son of Stan
ford. is that students within Stan
ford programs should be better
monitored no matter where they
are. Whether they are in Palo Alto
or Germany, follow-up and care
(and this is most important) should
be initiated by the school. Why? Be
cause seriously depressed students
are less likely to seek treatment.
They consider themselves to be de
fective instead of legitimately sick
because that's what depression
does. It convinces them that there is
no hope, and therefore no cure, but
that is really depression talking. We
have to break through that. We have
to go to them, physically and men
tally. If you go to the website for The
American Federation for Suicide
Prevention,you will see their advice
for preventing suicide. The suicidal
person cannot be expected to inde
pendently seek treatment. Some
body must take them.
If we can come away with any in
sight from Patrick and C'ho.it is that
follow-up was woefully lacking. 1
shudder to mention their names in
the same sentence, but similar ques
tions in their aftermaths compel me.
Why didn't the school follow up on
Pat's treatment in Germany even
though he was in a Stanford intern
ship program? The answer: Stan
ford was relying on Pat, and so was
I. That cannot continue. When stu
dents become patients, the school
must monitor them as long as they
are connected to the school and
wherever they are connected. De
pressed students â€” even the best,
like Pat â€” are simply not capable.
Depressed students don't seek
treatment because they are, not sur
prisingly. depressed. This is how de
pression kills, and in the process, it
robs functioning until there is very
little on which to rely. How do we
know when that functioning is
gone? We don't, and that is why it is

up to lis to know more. It is simply in
our own best interest to detect and
treat more actively and accurately. If
1 have come away with anything
from the loss of my beautiful son it
is this: Depression will kill anybody,
but the burden is on usto know
whom.
When Pat graduated in 2005,0ur
whole family came to Stanford to
wish him well: my husband and I
from Connecticut, his older brother
Colin and Colin's friend Julie from
Washington State, his twin sister
l.ibby from Vermont,and his grand
parents Dr and Mrs. David Rimer
from Los Angeles. We all came to
congratulate him, and we were im
pressed with the beautiful cere
monies and meaningful events, but
as 1 read your op-ed piece, the mem
ory of meeting you at graduation
stood out the most. You seemed like
a caring person, even during the
brief moments in which we had our
photograph taken with you. We
commented afterward how wel
coming you and your wife had been,
even though you were probably ex
hausted from shaking hands and
posing for several hours. And now I
write to ask you to bring that caring
sensibility to the forefront of this
issue. Suicide is the second leading
cause of death for college students.
It weakens parents' confidence in
the safety of their children on cam
pus â€” parents, who, by the way, are
already feeling excluded from the
well-beings of their children be
cause of confidentiality. We cannot
see grades, get psychiatric records,
get tuition bills directly, or inter
vene on students' behalf. Every
thing is left up to the student, and, as
we have seen with Patrick and Cho.
we risk too much isolation.
Again, thank you for your inter
est in this issue, and thank you for
promoting the psychological well
being of your students. 1 appreciate
your focusing Stanford's public at
tention on these avoidable catastro
phes. Patrick loved Stanford dearly.
I le was grateful for the services you
did provide, and now. in his stead,
we are grateful for your continuing
efforts to protect our children.

Dear Dr. I lennessy.
'bank you for your op-ed piece May 4 on pre
venting future tragedies such as Virginia Tech. It was
forwarded t<> me by one of your students who suf
fered the loss of a friend, my son Patrick Wood.
Patrick graduated from Stanford in 2005 with dis
tinction in math. He loved the school, had many
triends there, and was even treated for depression
there. In January before he graduated.he was hospi
talized for. ;is he explained to me. "having thoughts
of suicide I le was committed to the Stanford hos
pital for five days, but proclaimed that he was OK.
mostly bored, and didn't belong there. Hie psychia
trist in charge at the hospital agreed that Pat was
OK and should be permitted to return to school as
long ;is he continued therapy. I le saw a therapist and
a psychiatrist on campus and renewed his medica
tion I lis mood was up and down, but he continued
an active social life and good communication with
us I le was excited ;ibout an internship ;it Siemens in
Berlin. Gerni;iny, which he began after graduation.
He had applied for the internship through the Stan
ford ( enter in Berlin. I le suspended his therapy for
the summer with plans to return in September for
the computer science co-term program, but he loved
Berlin too much to leave just yet. Another friend
from Stanford was arriving to work in the American
Embassy there, and so Patrick obtained a leave of
absence and continued to work at Siemens through
the fall.
All the while, he made many friends, spoke and

wrote fluent German, went to concerts with col
leagues at Siemens, and maintained close contact
with the Stanford Center. He could often be heard
playing the piano there just as he had done at I laus
Mitt. I le wrote about a "mini-depression" before he
came home to Connecticut for Christmas vacation.
We thought ;i medication refill would be the answer.
His twin sister and older brother were home, along
with cousins, aunts, and uncles. It was the usual busy
but tun time. Pat later told friends it was "relaxing"
and that it was good to get away from the city for a
while. On December 27th. he went to New York City
to see another good friend from Stanford. He re
turned to Berlin on the 28th. In January he wrote
about a "mini-breakdown." We had many emails. I
called, but could not contact him by telephone. His
last email to me was on January 26th. Humboldt
I niversity had requested additional information on
his application as a grad student there. He took it as
rejection, told me he might be returning to Stanford,
and asked me to wish him luck. He answered no
more emails after that. He saw friends on the week
end of the 28th and 2 ( )th. He did not return phone
calls after Tuesday the 31st. His friend, who worked
;it the American Embassy and who lived a block
away, became worried. He called and went to Pat's
apartment several times the following weekend. He
called the Stanford Center on Monday morning.
ITiey called the police to break into the apartment.
By that evening, the police found Pat. He had died
of carbon monoxide poisoning on TUesday, January
31st.

Patrick was one of many graduates that June. He
was one of many more who were going on to gradu
ate school. The school cannot be responsible for
every student on campus or every new graduate. I
am under no illusions about who was responsible for
his treatment and for what he did. It was Patrick
alone who decided to stay in Germany, who decided
to suspend treatment, and ultimately who decided
that suicide would relieve his depression. I have
tried to retrace his steps continuously in my mind
ever since we were notified on February 6,2006. On
that day. his friend and others from the Stanford
Center identified him. They called a Stanford resi
dential housing director in Palo Alto, and he called
us. Both the Stanford School in Berlin and Palo Alto
had memorial services for him in February and
March of last year. As you can see, the school was
very much involved in both the life and in the death
of my son.
Please do not mistake my comments for blame.
Maybe no one could have prevented his loss, but I
have learned that it is the very nature of his disease,
and of Cho's at Virginia Tech, that should cause us to
be hyper-vigilant. Students who are depressed, even
brilliant and loving students like Pat. cannot func
tion reliably because the source of their decision
making process is under attack. They are making
flawed decisions because the very same mechanism
used to make these decisions is malfunctioning.
There is an anatomical difference between a healthy

ceremony, prior to his January 2006 suicide in Germany.
brain and a depressed brain. It is a
detectable, visible difference, and
yet it is only a part of the brain, for
many decisions appear "normal." It
is those normalities which lulled me
into thinking that Pat would get
help, that he would take care of him
self, that he would certainly see how
magnificent he was. that he had just
graduated from Stanford with a 3.9
average and a major in math, that
his friends loved him. that he had
had the best childhood we could
provide, that he had the brightest
future of anyone. How could he not
be happy? The answer is because
depression does not operate on the
same assumptions.
1 have had to change my own no
tions of well-being because they
failed Pat. He did not get help in
Germany because he could not.The
decisions he needed to make were
not possible with the oppression and
pain he was feeling. Although he was
physically able to get to a doctor or
call a therapist.just as he had done at
Stanford, those functions needed
motivation, and it was his motivation
which had been destroyed. All the
drive, the talent, the brilliance that
had won him a full scholarship to
Pomfret School, that had gotten him
perfect SAT's, that had made him a
valedictorian, that had made him a
merit scholar, that had gotten him
into Stanford, that won him a schol
arship there, that had gotten him into
the Krupp Internship program in
Germany and then into Siemensâ€”
all the motivation he needed to
achieve academic and social success
was no match for this disease. I le had
sought treatment, and it had not
worked, so he turned inward until he
isolated his thoughts, his wants, and
his pain, until he was feeling nothing
but the sense of control which sui
cide brings.
1 think your comments about
psychological services are a wel
come response. Pat's life was saved
the first time he had major depres
sion and was hospitalized by one of
the counselors on campus, and 1 am
deeply grateful. Hut 1 would hope,
in the wake of Pat's agonizing loss
and the frightening possibility of
another Virginia Tech. that we come
away with a few additional realiza

tions. I have spent every day trying
to do the same thing.
Mainly I hope that we under
stand that suicide victims are not in
sane. They function as well as they
need to function. Almost everything
about Pat was normal on the out
side. even the relationship problem
that preceded his death.
