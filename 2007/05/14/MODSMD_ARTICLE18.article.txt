# Op-Ed
## An open letter to President Hennessy 
### 
Dear Dr. I lennessy.
'bank you for your op-ed piece May 4 on pre
venting future tragedies such as Virginia Tech. It was
forwarded t<> me by one of your students who suf
fered the loss of a friend, my son Patrick Wood.
Patrick graduated from Stanford in 2005 with dis
tinction in math. He loved the school, had many
triends there, and was even treated for depression
there. In January before he graduated.he was hospi
talized for. ;is he explained to me. "having thoughts
of suicide I le was committed to the Stanford hos
pital for five days, but proclaimed that he was OK.
mostly bored, and didn't belong there. Hie psychia
trist in charge at the hospital agreed that Pat was
OK and should be permitted to return to school as
long ;is he continued therapy. I le saw a therapist and
a psychiatrist on campus and renewed his medica
tion I lis mood was up and down, but he continued
an active social life and good communication with
us I le was excited ;ibout an internship ;it Siemens in
Berlin. Gerni;iny, which he began after graduation.
He had applied for the internship through the Stan
ford ( enter in Berlin. I le suspended his therapy for
the summer with plans to return in September for
the computer science co-term program, but he loved
Berlin too much to leave just yet. Another friend
from Stanford was arriving to work in the American
Embassy there, and so Patrick obtained a leave of
absence and continued to work at Siemens through
the fall.
All the while, he made many friends, spoke and

wrote fluent German, went to concerts with col
leagues at Siemens, and maintained close contact
with the Stanford Center. He could often be heard
playing the piano there just as he had done at I laus
Mitt. I le wrote about a "mini-depression" before he
came home to Connecticut for Christmas vacation.
We thought ;i medication refill would be the answer.
His twin sister and older brother were home, along
with cousins, aunts, and uncles. It was the usual busy
but tun time. Pat later told friends it was "relaxing"
and that it was good to get away from the city for a
while. On December 27th. he went to New York City
to see another good friend from Stanford. He re
turned to Berlin on the 28th. In January he wrote
about a "mini-breakdown." We had many emails. I
called, but could not contact him by telephone. His
last email to me was on January 26th. Humboldt
I niversity had requested additional information on
his application as a grad student there. He took it as
rejection, told me he might be returning to Stanford,
and asked me to wish him luck. He answered no
more emails after that. He saw friends on the week
end of the 28th and 2 ( )th. He did not return phone
calls after Tuesday the 31st. His friend, who worked
;it the American Embassy and who lived a block
away, became worried. He called and went to Pat's
apartment several times the following weekend. He
called the Stanford Center on Monday morning.
ITiey called the police to break into the apartment.
By that evening, the police found Pat. He had died
of carbon monoxide poisoning on TUesday, January
31st.

Patrick was one of many graduates that June. He
was one of many more who were going on to gradu
ate school. The school cannot be responsible for
every student on campus or every new graduate. I
am under no illusions about who was responsible for
his treatment and for what he did. It was Patrick
alone who decided to stay in Germany, who decided
to suspend treatment, and ultimately who decided
that suicide would relieve his depression. I have
tried to retrace his steps continuously in my mind
ever since we were notified on February 6,2006. On
that day. his friend and others from the Stanford
Center identified him. They called a Stanford resi
dential housing director in Palo Alto, and he called
us. Both the Stanford School in Berlin and Palo Alto
had memorial services for him in February and
March of last year. As you can see, the school was
very much involved in both the life and in the death
of my son.
Please do not mistake my comments for blame.
Maybe no one could have prevented his loss, but I
have learned that it is the very nature of his disease,
and of Cho's at Virginia Tech, that should cause us to
be hyper-vigilant. Students who are depressed, even
brilliant and loving students like Pat. cannot func
tion reliably because the source of their decision
making process is under attack. They are making
flawed decisions because the very same mechanism
used to make these decisions is malfunctioning.
There is an anatomical difference between a healthy
