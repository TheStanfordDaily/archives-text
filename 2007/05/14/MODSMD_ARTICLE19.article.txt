## Polo's title hopes dashed Comeback not enough to claim championship in 5-4 loss to Bruins 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Squaring off for the NCAA Champi
onship yesterday afternoon, both the Stan
ford and UCLA women's water polo teams
knew that early momentum would be the key
to the game. In the teams' first three meet
ings of the season, the squad that scored first
was ultimately the victor on each occasion â€”
and yesterday's title match proved no differ
ent.
With energy levels high and a palpable
tension in the air. the second-seeded Bruins
took first blood midway through the first pe
riod en route to building a commanding 3-0
lead. The Stanford defense eventually man
aged to contain the UCLA onslaught, and
the Cardinal attack came to life in the final
period of play, as the top-seeded Stanford
women clawed their way back to within a sin
gle goal of the Bruins.
But sophomore Lolo Silver's bid to tie the
score in the waning moments of the game
came up just short, as the Bruins held on to
claim their third consecutive national cham
pionship by a narrow 5-4 margin.
"Coming in. we knew we needed to take a
lead early." Stanford head coach John Tanner
said. "UCLA is a very emotional team that
plays great with a lead, and giving up a three
goal deficit is no way to close the lid on such
an incredibly talented and emotionally
charged team."
UCLA junior Courtney Mathewson put
the Bruins on the board with a power-play
goal with 3:11 remaining in the first, and jun
ior Jillian Kraus followed two minutes later
by burying a shot from the perimeter to put
the Bruins up 2-0. The UCLA lead grew to
three as the Stanford offense continued to
struggle to find any rhythm whatsoever. Sil-

ver gave the Cardinal a small burst of mo
mentum by sneaking a shot from the right
wing past Bruin goalie Emih l eher.bringing
the score to 3-1 at the half.
But neither team was able to muster much
offense in the third period, as the lone scoring
highlight came when Mathewson notched
her second goal of the game to push the
UCLA lead back to three.
As the final period began, the Stanford
women were playing as much against the
clock as they were playing against the Bruins.
But senior Katie Hansen won the opening
sprint for the first time of the match, and Sil
ver capitalized on the opportunity by rifling a
long shot from eight meters away and into
the top right corner of the cage.The Stanford
bench exploded a minute later when Silver
scored her third of the game on a perfectly di
rected lob over Feher's head, bringing the
score to 4-3.
UCLA head coach Adam Krikorian im
mediately called a timeout to slow things
down, and the strategy worked as Mathew
son responded with what eventually proved
to be the game-winning goal on the Bruins'
next possession. Stanford sophomore Kira
1 lillman converted a six-on-five advantage at
5:38. but that was all the UCLA defense
would surrender for the remainder of the
game.
The Cardinal had one final shot in the last
minute of the game as Tanner called a time
out to set up his team's final play. But after
cutting around a screen from senior Christi
na Hewko, Silver was unable to get off a
strong shot under pressure from UCLA de
fender Kacy Kunkel. The ball bobbed up to
the cage, where Feher scooped it up to seal
the UCLA victory.
"[Silver] played a great game, so 1 figured
[their final play] was going to be something

[Silver]. We're fortunate the ball slipped
away because it's a game of inches, and if it
hadn't slipped away, maybe they would have
drawn an ejection or maybe it would have
gone into the goal."
Despite outplaying the Bruins in both
ends of the pool in the second half, the .Stan
ford squad was left to wonder what might
have been had they executed earlier in the
game.
"Missing on our first two power-plays and
going down by three was a lot to come back
from." Tanner said. "But. I was proud of our
defensive effort and tenacity in the second
half. I was a little too conservative on defense
[at the start |. but when 1 turned our two
meter defenders loose to press in front of the
goal. UCLA really had no offense to speak
of. And if we had nailed down that six-on-five

we fought 'til the end and we left it all
