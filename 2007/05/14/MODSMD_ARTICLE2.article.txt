## Card wins first Pac-10 series Baseball takes rubber match over Washington, 10-7 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball had been waiting a long
time for its first Pacific-10 Conference series
victory of the season, after losing all seven for
the year. But with Sunday afternoon's 10-7 vic
tory in the rubber match over Washington, the
Cardinal finally snapped its skid with a solid,
all-around effort capped by a persistent offen
sive performance.
Junior right-handed starter Erik Davis laid
a solid foundation for Stanford (21-27, 6-15
Pac-10) in Sunday's game against the I luskies
(26-23,9-9), going 6.2 innings and allowing just
one earned run. Still, after the Cardinal scored
four runs through the first four innings of play,
it seemed that old habits might doom Stanford
once again.
In the top half of the fifth inning, with two
outs, the Huskies scored three unearned runs.
A fielding error by freshman shortstop Adam
Gaylord, a walk, a hit batsman, a series of two
passed balls and a wild pitch played key roles
in the rally.
"The thing that hurt us there is we made an
error when they hit the ball to short," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "If we don't make
an error there, they don't score at all...And
we've done that a lot this year, and it's really
hurt us; but fortunately, 1 think the key thing is
that we came back and we kept scoring."
What separated this game from all the pre
vious disappointments for the Cardinal was
the tireless work of its offense. Davis' ability
to bounce back after a rough inning was also
crucial.
In the bottom half of the fifth, it was sopho
more centerfielder Sean Ratliff and junior
right fielder Michael Taylor who keyed the of
fense for Stanford.The pair is tied for the team
lead in starts and at-bats this season, and
Ratliffs lead off double followed by Taylor's
triple down the left field line was exemplary of
why Marquess has had so much faith in the duo
now batting 3-4 in the heart of the Cardinal
order.
"It's always big when your pitcher's strug
gled a little bit — he threw great all day and just
had a little hiccup there in the fifth," Ratliff said
of the inning. "Mike [Taylor] and I were talking
about it actually when we were in the outfield,
saying we've got to come back, we've got to put
a couple of runs up here and put some water on
the fire here."
Davis went on to pitch a scoreless sixth in
ning and allowed just one run through the first
two outs of the seventh before sophomore
Austin Yount came in to finish the game.
"1 was able to get ahead of guys and able to
get the leadoff guys, and I just mixed up my
pitches well," Davis said. "We just kept these
guys off balance, and it kind of looked like they
quit out there a little bit. That's a tribute to our
pitching staff and to our hitters putting up
runs."
Hie Cardinal dropped the series opener
against Washington on Friday night, 7-5. Stan
ford came charging out of the gate to open the
game 3-0, thanks largely to the efforts of Taylor,
who knocked in two RBI with a double and
later scored after a ground ball advanced him
to third and a sacrifice fly brought him home.
But Washington started to chip away at the
Cardinal's lead in the second, scoring a pair of
unearned runs on another fielding error by
Gaylord, a walk and a pair of singles.
Stanford again gave the Huskies a pair of

easy runs in the sixth, as left fielder Ty Ras
mussen was hit by a pitch from freshman starter
Jeff Inman. A single advanced Rasmussen to
third and a wild pitch put a second runner in
scoring position. Both runners would eventual
ly score on a passed ball and a sacrifice fly.The
Cardinal left six runners on base over its final
four frames at the plate as Washington took the
victory.
Saturday's 8-6 victory for Stanford evened
the series at one game apiece, as the Cardinal
scored five runs on six hits in the eighth inning
to snap a 3-3 tie.The I luskies made things inter
esting in the ninth with an RBI double and a
monster home run to left, crushed by designat
ed hitter Trevor Petersen. But Yount came in to
get the last out as Stanford held on for the win.
"It is a good feeling because we haven't
given up at all." Davis said. "And we knew
sometime or another, things would start turn
ing. And hopefully, this is the sign of some
things to come."
It was a relief to finally get the first Pac-10
series victory for the team.
"It's big," Ratliff added."lt came a little bit late
for our tastes, but it's good to get one under
your belt and start getting ready for the end of
the season and going down to USC. But we re
ally needed one right here."
Stanford heads down to Southern Califor
nia later this week for its final regular-season
series beginning Friday against the Trojans.

sive performance.
Junior right-handed starter Erik Davis laid
a solid foundation for Stanford (21-27, 6-15
Pac-10) in Sunday's game against the I luskies
(26-23,9-9), going 6.2 innings and allowing just
one earned run. Still, after the Cardinal scored
four runs through the first four innings of play,
it seemed that old habits might doom Stanford
once again.
In the top half of the fifth inning, with two
outs, the Huskies scored three unearned runs.
A fielding error by freshman shortstop Adam
Gaylord, a walk, a hit batsman, a series of two
passed balls and a wild pitch played key roles
in the rally.
"The thing that hurt us there is we made an
error when they hit the ball to short," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "If we don't make
an error there, they don't score at all...And
we've done that a lot this year, and it's really
hurt us; but fortunately, 1 think the key thing is
that we came back and we kept scoring."
What separated this game from all the pre
vious disappointments for the Cardinal was
the tireless work of its offense. Davis' ability
to bounce back after a rough inning was also
crucial.
In the bottom half of the fifth, it was sopho
more centerfielder Sean Ratliff and junior
right fielder Michael Taylor who keyed the of
fense for Stanford.The pair is tied for the team
lead in starts and at-bats this season, and
Ratliffs lead off double followed by Taylor's
triple down the left field line was exemplary of
why Marquess has had so much faith in the duo
now batting 3-4 in the heart of the Cardinal
order.
"It's always big when your pitcher's strug
gled a little bit — he threw great all day and just
had a little hiccup there in the fifth," Ratliff said
of the inning. "Mike [Taylor] and I were talking
about it actually when we were in the outfield,
saying we've got to come back, we've got to put
a couple of runs up here and put some water on
the fire here."
Davis went on to pitch a scoreless sixth in
ning and allowed just one run through the first
two outs of the seventh before sophomore
Austin Yount came in to finish the game.
"1 was able to get ahead of guys and able to
get the leadoff guys, and I just mixed up my
pitches well," Davis said. "We just kept these
guys off balance, and it kind of looked like they
quit out there a little bit. That's a tribute to our
pitching staff and to our hitters putting up
runs."
Hie Cardinal dropped the series opener
against Washington on Friday night, 7-5. Stan
ford came charging out of the gate to open the
game 3-0, thanks largely to the efforts of Taylor,
who knocked in two RBI with a double and
later scored after a ground ball advanced him
to third and a sacrifice fly brought him home.
But Washington started to chip away at the
Cardinal's lead in the second, scoring a pair of
unearned runs on another fielding error by
Gaylord, a walk and a pair of singles.
Stanford again gave the Huskies a pair of

easy runs in the sixth, as left fielder Ty Ras
mussen was hit by a pitch from freshman starter
Jeff Inman. A single advanced Rasmussen to
third and a wild pitch put a second runner in
scoring position. Both runners would eventual
ly score on a passed ball and a sacrifice fly.The
Cardinal left six runners on base over its final
four frames at the plate as Washington took the
victory.
Saturday's 8-6 victory for Stanford evened
the series at one game apiece, as the Cardinal
scored five runs on six hits in the eighth inning
to snap a 3-3 tie.The I luskies made things inter
esting in the ninth with an RBI double and a
monster home run to left, crushed by designat
ed hitter Trevor Petersen. But Yount came in to
get the last out as Stanford held on for the win.
"It is a good feeling because we haven't
given up at all." Davis said. "And we knew
sometime or another, things would start turn
ing. And hopefully, this is the sign of some
things to come."
It was a relief to finally get the first Pac-10
series victory for the team.
"It's big," Ratliff added."lt came a little bit late
for our tastes, but it's good to get one under
your belt and start getting ready for the end of
the season and going down to USC. But we re
ally needed one right here."
Stanford heads down to Southern Califor
nia later this week for its final regular-season
series beginning Friday against the Trojans.

Rightfielder Michael Taylor speeds across the base path against Washington on Friday. Taylor
and the Cardinal captured their much-needed, first Pac-10 series victory this past weekend.
Stanford baseball had been waiting a long
time for its first Pacific-10 Conference series
victory of the season, after losing all seven for
the year. But with Sunday afternoon's 10-7 vic
tory in the rubber match over Washington, the
