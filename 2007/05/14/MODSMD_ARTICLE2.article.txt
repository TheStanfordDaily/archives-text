## Card wins first Pac-10 series Baseball takes rubber match over Washington, 10-7 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball had been waiting a long
time for its first Pacific-10 Conference series
victory of the season, after losing all seven for
the year. But with Sunday afternoon's 10-7 vic
tory in the rubber match over Washington, the
Cardinal finally snapped its skid with a solid,
all-around effort capped by a persistent offen
sive performance.
Junior right-handed starter Erik Davis laid
a solid foundation for Stanford (21-27, 6-15
Pac-10) in Sunday's game against the I luskies
(26-23,9-9), going 6.2 innings and allowing just
one earned run. Still, after the Cardinal scored
four runs through the first four innings of play,
it seemed that old habits might doom Stanford
once again.
In the top half of the fifth inning, with two
outs, the Huskies scored three unearned runs.
A fielding error by freshman shortstop Adam
Gaylord, a walk, a hit batsman, a series of two
passed balls and a wild pitch played key roles
in the rally.
"The thing that hurt us there is we made an
error when they hit the ball to short," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "If we don't make
an error there, they don't score at all...And
we've done that a lot this year, and it's really
hurt us; but fortunately, 1 think the key thing is
that we came back and we kept scoring."
What separated this game from all the pre
vious disappointments for the Cardinal was
the tireless work of its offense. Davis' ability
to bounce back after a rough inning was also
crucial.
In the bottom half of the fifth, it was sopho
more centerfielder Sean Ratliff and junior
right fielder Michael Taylor who keyed the of
fense for Stanford.The pair is tied for the team
lead in starts and at-bats this season, and
Ratliffs lead off double followed by Taylor's
triple down the left field line was exemplary of
