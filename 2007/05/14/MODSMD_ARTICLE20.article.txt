# Card rolls in opening rounds
## Stanford advances to Georgia in pursuit of fourth straight title 
### JACK SALISBURY DHSK EDITOR 
Cruising through first- and second-round play of
the NCAA Championships. Stanford women's tennis
successfully began its quest for a fourth straight na
tional title this past weekend. With home-court ad
vantage at the Tauhe Family Tennis Center, the Car
dinal had little trouble in disposing of opponents
Sacramento State (4-1) and Brigham Young (4-0).
"We did exactly what we set out to do." said fresh
man Lindsay Burdette, competing in her first cham
pionship action. "We wanted quick wins with as little
energy expended as possible. It was about working on
our stuff and paying attention to detail. It was really
good."
Despite missing juniors Celia Durkin and Lejla
1 lodzic due to injuries, Stanford rolled past the Sacra
mento State Hornets on Friday. The Cardinal started
the match off well, winning the doubles point, and
then finished off Sac State in the singles portion.
Sophomore Megan Doheny was the only member of
the Cardinal to lose a match; Burdette, sophomore
Jessica Nguyen, junior Whitney Deason and senior
Anne Yelsey all won their matches in convincing
straight sets.
Senior Theresa Logar was in a battle with the Hor
nets' No. 1 Katrina Zheltova, but the individual
match was called once Stanford had clinched the
overall match with a 4-1 lead.
Saturday's match against B YU brought the Cardi
nal even less trouble. Stanford defeated the Cougars
4-0. taking the doubles point and winning every

GAMf NOTES After its weekend victories, Stanford owns a 19-
match winning streak. If the Cardinal women defeat Vanderbilt on
Fnday, they are set to face the winner of the Southern Califor
nia/Miami match in the quarterfinals. Three other Pac-10 teams
(UCLA, USC and Col) also advanced to the Round of 16; with
four teams still remaining, the Fbc-10 is the most-represented of
the conferences

match in straight sets.
As Burdette explained, Sacramento State and
BYU actually presented more of a challenge than
some of the Cardinal's past early-round opponents.
"It's been a joke in years past," she said. "This
weekend we played really good players and we
played really well. We usually work at the end of the
NCAA Tournament, hut this year we played very
well to begin with."
For the Round of 16, the Cardinal is set to face
Vanderbilt, which comes off defeating Tennessee in
the second round. Stanford has already had a chance
to see Vanderbilt this season: the Cardinal had its way
with the Commodores at the ITA National Team In
doors, beating them 6-1 back in early February.
The second time around against Vanderbilt could
be different.but Burdette was confident in her team's
chances.
"They are a solid team, but I don't think they have
the firepower to beat us." she said.
If Stanford wins Friday's match, there's a strong
possibility that it will face Pac-1() rival Southern Cal
ifornia, a team that has already tested the Cardinal
this year.
With its opening-round victories, Stanford travels
tomorrow to Athens, Ga. for the rest of the NCAA
Championships which take place on the University of
Georgia campus.
Stanford will spend the next two weeks in Athens
for both the Team and Individual NCAA Champi
onships. with the team championships concluding on
May 22 and the individual championships finishing

on May 28.
The team will be well-represented in the singles
and doubles brackets of the individual champi
onships. Several members of the Cardinal squad were
invited to the singles bracket; senior co-captain
Theresa Logar. Yelsey. Durkin. Burdette and Nguyen
will all vie for a singles title.
In the doubles bracket. Stanford will be represent
ed by the duos of Burdette/Yelsey and
Nyugen/Durkin.
The girls' victories against Sacramento State and
BYU pushed the No. 1 Cardinal's overall record to
22-1. The team is currently on a 19-match winning
streak; Stanford has not lost since early February
when it fell to Georgia Tech. snapping an 89-match
winning streak that spanned over three years.
Stanford may have a chance to get revenge against
the Yellow Jackets in the finals of the team champi
onships, provided that both teams get that far. NCAA
tennis tends to be top-heavy, though, so it's a viable
possibility that the Cardinal will have a chance to
avenge its early-season loss in the finals.
At this point, however, the Cardinal is not looking
past any opponents. Under the business-like mental
ity of co-captain Yelsey and her bubbly, fellow co
captain Logar, Stanford is taking the NCAAs on a
match-by-match basis.
"It's a different state of mind," Burdette said of
the team's entry into the Round of 16. "It's go-time. It
(the championship] is what we've worked for."
