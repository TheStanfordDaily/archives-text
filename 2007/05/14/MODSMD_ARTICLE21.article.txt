# Softball suffers losing weekend
## Women drop three to Oregon schools, receive NCAA Regional bid for Thursday 
### SCOTT BLAND ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITERS 
The final regular-season weekend of the year was far from
the strong finish the No. 16 Stanford Softball team had envi
sioned. After dropping a game to No. 20 Oregon on Thursday
night, the Cardinal lost a pair, 8-5 and 9-2, to No. 19 Oregon
State over the next two days.
The Cardinal (33-19-1, 7-13-1 Pacific-10 Conference) en-

tered the three-game
set with the chance to
finish at .500 and as
high as fourth place in
the Pac-10. But Stan
ford squandered the
opportunity, especial
ly against the Pac-10's
bottom-feeding
Ducks, losing 5-4. The
Cardinal ended up
having to settle for
sixth place instead.

Cardinal and claim

much work to do in
preparation. Satur
day's loss marked the
second straight game
in which Stanford
out-hit its opponent
but failed to escape
with a 'W.' The Cardi

vantage in hits, but
left 11 runners on
base to Oregon

the team's offensive

GAME NOTES: No. 16 Stanford entered the week
end with a chance at finishing .500 for its Pac
-10 season, but lost it with upsets to the confer
ence's bottom two teams. The Cardinal ended
up with a 33-19-1 overall, 7-13-1 Rac-10
record—good for sixth in the conference. Fortu
nately, it was enough for Stanford to receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA Regional for its 10th
straight appearance. Thursday's Fresno State
game at Smith Family Stadium follows a match
between LSU (52-10) and Cal State-Northridge
(23-21) at 3 p.m.

done the day before against Oregon, Stanford's first three hit
ters — senior left fielder Jackie Rinehart, junior second base
man Tricia Aggabao and freshman center fielder Alissa Haber
— loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the first in the
Friday match-up with Oregon State. But the Cardinal failed to
press its advantage and came out of the inning with only a 1-0
lead after freshman right fielder Shannon Koplitz walked in a
run three batters later.
Another dagger to Stanford's hopes was the resurgence of
its error-prone defense, allowing extra outs. Prior to this week-
end, the Card had committed just
one error in the last 54 innings, and
none in their last 34. On Thursday,
the Ducks scored an unearned run in
the second on senior shortstop Lind
say Key's error, breaking the error
less streak.
Stanford was forced to pay in the
middle innings. Junior pitcher Becky
McC ullough allowed only one hit
and one walk over the first three in
nings before things began to unravel
in the top of the fourth. With one
out. another error from Key let Ore
gon State through the door, and two
consecutive singles loaded the bases.
Beaver freshman Alana Ford pinch
hit lor second baseman Paige Lowe,
and the move paid off as Ford
launched a grand slam to center
field, giving OSU a 4-1 lead.
The Cardinal cut the deficit to
two in the bottom of the inning when
Haber plated junior first baseman
Erin Howe with a sacrifice fly, but
Oregon State came back with more
power in the fifth, doing in the Car
dinal for good. This time it was soph
omore DeAnn Young who hit the
home run, a two-run shot to left that
followed a leadoff single. Ford also
hit a triple to drive in her fifth run of
the day. making it a 7-2 game.
Haber and junior third baseman
Michelle Smith nearly got the Cardi
nal back in the game, hitting back
to-back bases-loaded singles, while
sophomore designated player
Maddy Coon scored another with an
RBI groundout. But OSU tacked on

another run in the seventh with an
RBI double, bringing the game to its
final score of 8-5.
The next day marked the final
regular-season home game for sen
iors Jackie Rinehart and Key, who

were honored in a pre-game Senior
Day ceremony. Rinehart and Key
have sported the Cardinal uniform
for over 200 games throughout their
collegiate careers. Though Key is
known primarily for her defense.

Rinehart finished her campaign in
the top 10 for career hits, triples,
runs, stolen bases, at hats and games
played. Rinehart is also one of only
five players in Stanford history to
finish with a career batting average

over .300.
The festivities were short-lived,
however, as Beavers pitcher Hri
anne McGowan held the Cardinal to
just three hits — all singles —on
the way to a disappointing 9-2 defeat
on Senior Day. This time, it was the
Beavers who loaded the bases with
no outs, and they got two runs out of
it on an RBI groundout and a single
to second base.
Stanford tied the game at two in
the bottom of the first, after Coon
singled, stole second and scored on
an RBI single by freshman catcher
Rosey Neill. Neill later followed
Coon home on a wild pitch.
But Oregon State ended the
game in the top of the fifth inning.
The Beavers loaded the bases again,
this time with one out, and although
Stanford pitcher sophomore Missy
Penna managed to get one more out
after that, OSU drove home four
runs after an infield single and a hit
batter made it a 6-2 game; the bases
were left loaded for sophomore Ste
fanie Ewing, who hit a two-RBI sin
gle off of McCullough. Penna's re
placement.
OSU tagged McCullough for an
other run in the sixth to bring the
game to its 9-2 final score and end
the Cardinal's regular season on a
sour note.
Stanford will get another chance
in the playoffs, however. The Cardi
nal received a post-season bid yes
terday and will open the first round
of the NCAA Tournament at home
on Thursday against Fresno State
(46-16).
Earlier this season, a double
header between the two squads was
postponed due to inclement weath
er. Though Stanford is 11-6 all-time

against Fresno State and also elimi
nated them in last year's regional,
the Bulldogs have already upset top
ranked Arizona State (6-1) and Cal
ifornia (2-1) this season.
Looking back on the season.
Stanford exceeded expectations
after pre-season polls had picked the
Cardinal to finish eighth in the Pac
-10. This year, an amazing eight teams
from the perennially strong Pac-10
were selected to the NCAA Tourna
ment. the most of any conference.
The winner of the first-round
matchup will advance to face either
lOth-seeded LSU (52-10) or Cal
State-Northridge (23-21).

GAME NOTES: No. 16 Stanford entered the week
end with a chance at finishing .500 for its Pac
-10 season, but lost it with upsets to the confer
ence's bottom two teams. The Cardinal ended
up with a 33-19-1 overall, 7-13-1 Rac-10
record—good for sixth in the conference. Fortu
nately, it was enough for Stanford to receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA Regional for its 10th
straight appearance. Thursday's Fresno State
game at Smith Family Stadium follows a match
between LSU (52-10) and Cal State-Northridge
(23-21) at 3 p.m.

done the day before against Oregon, Stanford's first three hit
ters — senior left fielder Jackie Rinehart, junior second base
man Tricia Aggabao and freshman center fielder Alissa Haber
— loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the first in the
Friday match-up with Oregon State. But the Cardinal failed to
press its advantage and came out of the inning with only a 1-0
lead after freshman right fielder Shannon Koplitz walked in a
run three batters later.
Another dagger to Stanford's hopes was the resurgence of
its error-prone defense, allowing extra outs. Prior to this week-
end, the Card had committed just
one error in the last 54 innings, and
none in their last 34. On Thursday,
the Ducks scored an unearned run in
the second on senior shortstop Lind
say Key's error, breaking the error
less streak.
Stanford was forced to pay in the
middle innings. Junior pitcher Becky
McC ullough allowed only one hit
and one walk over the first three in
nings before things began to unravel
in the top of the fourth. With one
out. another error from Key let Ore
gon State through the door, and two
consecutive singles loaded the bases.
Beaver freshman Alana Ford pinch
hit lor second baseman Paige Lowe,
and the move paid off as Ford
launched a grand slam to center
field, giving OSU a 4-1 lead.
The Cardinal cut the deficit to
two in the bottom of the inning when
Haber plated junior first baseman
Erin Howe with a sacrifice fly, but
Oregon State came back with more
power in the fifth, doing in the Car
dinal for good. This time it was soph
omore DeAnn Young who hit the
home run, a two-run shot to left that
followed a leadoff single. Ford also
hit a triple to drive in her fifth run of
the day. making it a 7-2 game.
Haber and junior third baseman
Michelle Smith nearly got the Cardi
nal back in the game, hitting back
to-back bases-loaded singles, while
sophomore designated player
Maddy Coon scored another with an
RBI groundout. But OSU tacked on

another run in the seventh with an
RBI double, bringing the game to its
final score of 8-5.
The next day marked the final
regular-season home game for sen
iors Jackie Rinehart and Key, who

were honored in a pre-game Senior
Day ceremony. Rinehart and Key
have sported the Cardinal uniform
for over 200 games throughout their
collegiate careers. Though Key is
known primarily for her defense.

Rinehart finished her campaign in
the top 10 for career hits, triples,
runs, stolen bases, at hats and games
played. Rinehart is also one of only
five players in Stanford history to
finish with a career batting average

over .300.
The festivities were short-lived,
however, as Beavers pitcher Hri
anne McGowan held the Cardinal to
just three hits — all singles —on
the way to a disappointing 9-2 defeat
on Senior Day. This time, it was the
Beavers who loaded the bases with
no outs, and they got two runs out of
it on an RBI groundout and a single
to second base.
Stanford tied the game at two in
the bottom of the first, after Coon
singled, stole second and scored on
an RBI single by freshman catcher
Rosey Neill. Neill later followed
Coon home on a wild pitch.
But Oregon State ended the
game in the top of the fifth inning.
The Beavers loaded the bases again,
this time with one out, and although
Stanford pitcher sophomore Missy
Penna managed to get one more out
after that, OSU drove home four
runs after an infield single and a hit
batter made it a 6-2 game; the bases
were left loaded for sophomore Ste
fanie Ewing, who hit a two-RBI sin
gle off of McCullough. Penna's re
placement.
OSU tagged McCullough for an
other run in the sixth to bring the
game to its 9-2 final score and end
the Cardinal's regular season on a
sour note.
Stanford will get another chance
in the playoffs, however. The Cardi
nal received a post-season bid yes
terday and will open the first round
of the NCAA Tournament at home
on Thursday against Fresno State
(46-16).
Earlier this season, a double
header between the two squads was
postponed due to inclement weath
er. Though Stanford is 11-6 all-time

against Fresno State and also elimi
nated them in last year's regional,
the Bulldogs have already upset top
ranked Arizona State (6-1) and Cal
ifornia (2-1) this season.
Looking back on the season.
Stanford exceeded expectations
after pre-season polls had picked the
Cardinal to finish eighth in the Pac
-10. This year, an amazing eight teams
from the perennially strong Pac-10
were selected to the NCAA Tourna
ment. the most of any conference.
The winner of the first-round
matchup will advance to face either
lOth-seeded LSU (52-10) or Cal
State-Northridge (23-21).

Senior Jackie Rinehart takes a big cut against her Oregon State opponents. The Cardinal ended up dropping two
games to the No. 1 9 Beavers, but despite the rough weekend, received an NCAA Regional bid against Fresno State.
The final regular-season weekend of the year was far from
the strong finish the No. 16 Stanford Softball team had envi
sioned. After dropping a game to No. 20 Oregon on Thursday
night, the Cardinal lost a pair, 8-5 and 9-2, to No. 19 Oregon
State over the next two days.
The Cardinal (33-19-1, 7-13-1 Pacific-10 Conference) en-

tered the three-game

ford squandered the
opportunity, especial
ly against the Pac-10's
bottom-feeding
Ducks, losing 5-4. The
Cardinal ended up
having to settle for
sixth place instead.
