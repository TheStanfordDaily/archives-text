# Softball suffers losing weekend
## Women drop three to Oregon schools, receive NCAA Regional bid for Thursday 
### SCOTT BLAND ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITERS 
The final regular-season weekend of the year was far from
the strong finish the No. 16 Stanford Softball team had envi
sioned. After dropping a game to No. 20 Oregon on Thursday
night, the Cardinal lost a pair, 8-5 and 9-2, to No. 19 Oregon
State over the next two days.
The Cardinal (33-19-1, 7-13-1 Pacific-10 Conference) en-

tered the three-game
set with the chance to
finish at .500 and as
high as fourth place in
the Pac-10. But Stan

opportunity, especial

bottom-feeding
Ducks, losing 5-4. The
Cardinal ended up
having to settle for
sixth place instead.

two games were

GAME NOTES: No. 16 Stanford entered the week
end with a chance at finishing .500 for its Pac
-10 season, but lost it with upsets to the confer
ence's bottom two teams. The Cardinal ended
up with a 33-19-1 overall, 7-13-1 Rac-10
record—good for sixth in the conference. Fortu
nately, it was enough for Stanford to receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA Regional for its 10th
straight appearance. Thursday's Fresno State
game at Smith Family Stadium follows a match
between LSU (52-10) and Cal State-Northridge
(23-21) at 3 p.m.

ters — senior left fielder Jackie Rinehart, junior second base
man Tricia Aggabao and freshman center fielder Alissa Haber
