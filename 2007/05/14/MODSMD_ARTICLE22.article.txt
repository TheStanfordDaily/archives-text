# Calif, air quality shows improvement

### JULIA GUTH 
California's air quality has improved sub
stantially. but there is still room for progress,
Robert Sawyer, chair of the California Air
Resources Board (CARB), told a group
comprised mostly of faculty and alumni on
Friday.
An emeritus professor of energy at UC-
Berkeley. Sawyer '57 outlined the steps
CARB has taken to improve air quality in
( alifornia since l l >4o. including reducing the
presence of particulates and smog in the at
mosphere. lie also voiced his excitement at
California's landmark program to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
"Air quality is improving in California,"
Sawyer said. "There's no question about it."
CARB is responsible for regulating
motor vehicle emissions, consumer product
air pollution and toxic air contaminants.
Sawyer, who has been its chair since 2005,
said the regulatory board's focus on combin
ing government policy with actual science
has produced significant results.
"We, as an agency, need to keep up with
the -science," he said. "Our understanding of
science is constantly changing, and our regu
lations must reflect this change."
During the hour-long lecture, which was
sponsored by the Mechanical Engineering
Department and the Global Climate and En
ergy Project (GO P). Sawyer cited ozone
and particulate matter as the biggest air qual
ity problems.specifically in Southern Califor
nia and the San Joaquin Valley. I le attributed
the increased air pollution in those regions to
population expansions.

Sawyer also cited increases in particulate
matter in the atmosphere as a direct cause of
the heightened incidence of a number of
health disorders.
"More people are dying from cardiovas
cular disease, probably because of exposure
to particles." he said.
Yet in the face of population growth.
Sawyer insisted that CARB has improved air
quality on the whole.The agency, he said, has
installed a "stringent" smog check program.
In 1998, the board amended the state's Low-
Emission Vehicle (LEV) regulations, effec
tively tightening the fleet average standards
and requiring automakers to reduce emis
sion levels each year through 2010.
A registered Democrat, Sawyer praised
California's Republican Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger for his dedication to envi
ronmentalism and for appointing him to
serve on CARB.
"After a career as a university professor
working on air quality problems, it was an un
expected and unique opportunity," he said.
Schwarzenegger recently called on
CARB to regulate and enforce the Califor
nia Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.
which creates a state-wide cap-and-trade
program to reduce greenhouse gas emis
sions.
"The magnitude and responsibility of this
new undertaking is a real challenge." Sawyer
said. "It's a lot more for us to do here at the
agency."
Calling global warming "the SOO-pound
gorilla that has been attacking (his] agency."
Sawyer warned that California may suffer
from the effects of global warming more than

any other state. Over the last 100 years, the
average temperature in California has in
creased 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit and the sur
rounding ocean level has risen seven inches,
he said.
Sawyer projected that global warming's
effects on California would most immediate
ly be felt through water loss.
"California's water supply is snow pack,
and we depend on its gradual release of
water between April and July," he said. "F rur
ther decreases in the water runoff will not be
good for the state of California."
Sawyer expressed hope that global health
and the threat of destroying the planet for fu
ture generations would compel politicians to
address the crisis.
"It's a grandchildren thing," he said. "We
don't know what the consequences of global
warming will be, but it could be catastrophic.
So I worry about this, especially for my
grandchildren."
Afterwards, those who attended the lec
ture praised Sawyer for his actions as chair of
CARB. One audience member commended
Sawyer's attempt to establish higher environ
mental quality standards in China, drawing
applause from the rest of the crowd.
Fivan Hughes, an energy consultant with
Menlo Park-based Biomass Energy Re
search Association, touted Sawyer's contri
butions to the state of California.
"1 am very impressed with what Sawyer
has done in science and regulations." 1 lughes
said, "including his dedication on the green
house gas issue."
