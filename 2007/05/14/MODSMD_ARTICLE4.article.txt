Ilie smell of eucalyptus trees mixed
with the scent of sizzling fry bread this
weekend as 30.000 people participated in
the 36th Stanford Powwow.The Powwow,
an annual celebration of Native Ameri
can culture and heritage, was sponsored
by the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation and ran from Friday until yester
day, in what is traditionally the largest stu
dent-run powwow in the nation.
Held in Eucalyptus Grove, the event
featured three days of near-constant
dancing, singing and drumming. Each day,
vendors sold savory food and tented

booths offered arts and crafts. On Satur
day morning, attendees took a break from
eating and shopping to participate in the
powwow's annual 5K fun-run.
Anthony Marquez'o6, a Navajo coter
minal student, has been involved with the
powwow since his freshman year at Stan
ford.
"It's a lot of work." he said. "We start
planning as soon as school starts."
Marquez explained that about 30 stu
dents are in charge of everything from ar
ranging for event security to hiring em
cees to approving booth applications.
The powwow's main attraction are the
dozens of performances spanning the

whole weekend. Nearly 200 competitors
from all over the country participated,
vying for thousands of dollars in prize
money.
"We call them powwow chasers," Mar
quez said. "It's a lifestyle for them. Hiey
drive around with their families and com
pete."
For the Jingle Dress dance, women
sporting seven rows of ringing bells on
their dresses danced a traditional Ojibwa
dance. The men's competition included
Ciourd Dancing.a ceremonial dance from

the Southern Plains. Men and
women swapped costumes and roles
in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender Community Resources
Center-sponsored Switch Dance
Contest.
The powwow also hosted over 100
booths, with Indian tacos, fry bread
topped with sugar and even Thai-
Chinese cuisine all for sale. The arts
and crafts offerings ranged from
dreamcatchers to t-shirts.
Nathan Lefthand, a booth owner
from Monterey, said he has spent
eight years traveling to powwows all

over the Southwest selling hand
crafted jewelry.
At the Stanford powwow, Left
hand teamed up with a gourd artist
friend who was selling painted fruits
alongside Lefthand's jewelry.
"Friday is typically a slow night,"
Lefthand said. "But we'll sell lots of
jewelry for Mother's Day."
Lefthand was impressed with the
this weekend's powwow, which he
called "California's biggest and
best."
Marquez was also proud of what
the Stanford powwow accomplishes.
"It's the biggest student-run event
on campus," he boasted, "from the
smallest community on campus."
