# Teen stressors diagnosed
## Pushy parents may create unhealthy stress in teen lives 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The so-called 'Stanford Duck Syndrome*
could partially be a result of students' pushy par
ents, according to School of Education Lecturer
Denise Clark Pope.
The "Duck Syndrome' — a common
metaphor for stressed-out students who appear
calm on the surface — actually begins in high
school. Pope told The Daily. The founder of the
SOS: Stressed Out Students Program. Pope
spoke as part of the group's fourth annual con
ference at the University, which took place on
Friday and Saturday.
Kresge Auditorium was filled to capacity
with an audience primarily of educators, parents
and counselors from local public and private
schools. They wanted to hear a student panel
and keynote addresses from adolescent psy
chology and education experts Madeline Levine
and Wendy Mogel.
In recent years, Levine told the crowd, the

high school- and middle school-aged
adolescents she sees in her practice
have become increasingly normal
looking — a far cry from the obvious
problem-children of previous
decades. Like those experiencing the
'Stanford Duck Syndrome," these
students appear well-adjusted.
Levine placed blame for part of
the problem on pressures created by
parents who insist that their children
succeed at the highest level.
'What I'm seeing is some incredi
bly perverted knowledge of what it
means to push a kid." she said. "This
notion that children are supposed to
be good at everything they do is so
unbelievably wrong."
The pressure parents put on kids
to succeed in everything they do —
school, social life, extracurricular —
can push students to mask deeper

problems with a facade of happiness.
"But metaphorically or not
metaphorically," Levine said, "when
you roll up [students'] sleeves they're
bleeding underneath."
On Mother's Day weekend,
Mogel emphasized the role parents
can have in pushing their kids toward
stress by sometimes "helping" too
much, a phenomenon she called "the
dark side of parental devotion."
"Good parenting feels like neg
lect," she said.
Following the Friday evening
event, which was open to the public,
smaller sessions were held on Satur
day for teaching teams from Bay
Area middle and high schools. ITie
sessions included several workshops
and seminars designed to help with
implementing practices that de
crease the stress associated with edu
cation.
Parent and substitute teacher
Diana Chambers of Half Moon Bay
attended the event out of concern for
her sixth-grade daughter and others in
similar situations.

"In elementary school. [students|
love to learn and then it suddenly be
comes about the grades," she said. "1
saw all these people were concerned
about these issues."
Yvonne Wun. Anna Derugin and
Parn Merchant, parents of students at
Burlingame High, attended for simi
lar reasons, and thought the speakers
made good points.
"We have a real interest in this
right now." Wun said. "We wish more
of our parents could have heard."
Hie SOS event originated in part
because of similar concern for Stan
ford students, who struggle in the af
termath of pressures placed on them
in middle and high school.
"[SOS] started way back at Vaden
Health Center where one of the coun
selors read my book and called and
said.'We want to do some sort of inter
vention. and can you help us,'" Pope
said. "We wanted to do something
preventative and proactive "
