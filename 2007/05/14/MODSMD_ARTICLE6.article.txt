## Boge places 2nd in 2007 Jeopardy tour 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Plagued by slips of the tongue, had luck
and a quick-fingered opponent, Craig Boge
'07 had to settle for second place in the 2(X)7
College Jeopardy! Tournament, despite a
strong performance in last week's two-day
final round.
Hie finals, which aired in a two-part se
ries on Thursday and Friday, saw Boge deliv
er uneven performances.
In the first round.he trailed UCLA soph
omore Cliff Galihcr for most of the game.
Though both Boge and Notre Dame fresh

man Christine Kennedy were within strik
ing distance of Galiher's lead, back-to-back
Double Jeopardy! missteps set Boge back
$4.5(X). At the same time, a series of quick
answers raised Galiher's score to $22.6(X),
compared to Boge's $10,900 and Kennedy's
$5,200 at the end of Double Jeopardy!
A tricky Final Jeopardy! question, how
ever. allowed Boge to surge back into con
tention. From the category "The Computer
Age," came the clue 'This term still had
'work' on the end when Vinton Cerf &
Robert Kahn. two of its creators, used it in a
key 1974 paper." While Kennedy and Gali
her both answered incorrectly. Boge. much

to his own surprise, correctly an
swered "What is the Internet?" He
had been shaking his head before
host Alex Trebek deemed the an
swer correct.
Boge's correct Final Jeopardy!
answer bumped his one-day total
up to $16.(XX). and Galiher's incor
rect guess brought him down to
$18,100. while Kennedy became a
non-factor with $.V2(X). Suddenly, Boge was
a mere $2.1 (X) from Galiher's lead. The
crowd gathered in Grove Lasuen. where
Boge lives, erupted in cheers.
Early in Friday's second round, it seemed

as if the previous day's surprise ending had
provided Boge with the momentum he
needed toclairn the SKX).(KK) first prize. Gal
iher — who had been so dominant the dav

before — found his score dipping
into the red, while Kennedy only
buzzed in intermittently. Boge,on the
other hand, buzzed in quickly and ef
ficiently and was in high enough spir
its to joke with Trebek about his golf
skills at the first commercial break.
"Now, with a name like Craig
Boge [pronounced 'bogey'], it's obvi
ous that you are a golfer," Trebek
quipped. "The question is, are you a
good golfer?"
"Well, it really depends on the
day," Boge replied, drawing some
laughs from the crowd. "There are
some days when it's going pretty
good and I'm pretty happy.There are
other days when 1 hit people, houses,
golf carts..."
"So I could assume that you are
not a member of the Stanford Uni
versity golf team?" Trebek followed
up.
"You would be very correct,"
Boge said.
"Good," Trebek deadpanned. "1
enjoy being correct."
Iliis exchange, however, kicked
off a gloomy second half for Boge.
Galiher regained his calm and
buzzed back with measured efficien
cy to take back the lead. The Stan
ford senior did not give up and kept
on Galiher's heels throughout Dou
ble Jeopardy!, but when he incor
rectly responded to a $2,000 Daily
Double! question, Boge was out of
contention. Galiher entered Final
Jeopardy! with $18,000, compared to
Boge's $9,000, thereby cementing
his victory before the final question
was even asked. (Because the cham
pion was determined by his cumula
tive score over the two-day final,
Galiher was assured of victory given
his $2,100 advantage in the first
round.)
Because the final question
which asked the participants to iden
tify the historical document that read
"Prudence...will dictate that govern
ments long established should not be
changed fur light and transient caus
es" — had no bearing on the out
come of the game (save the battle for
second place, which Boge had essen
tially locked up), the senior wagered
$2.(K)7 — "for all of the seniors." He
grinned as Trebek pronounced his re
sponse, "What is the Declaration of
Independence?" correct. Both Gali
her and Kennedy incorrectly identi
fied the document in question as the
Constitution.

When Trebek awarded Boge the
$50,000 second-place prize money.
Grove Lasuen residents gave their
housemate a standing ovation that
lasted more than three minutes.
"Thank you," Boge said as the ap
plause died down. "Thank you so
much for coming out to see this, for
coming to watch me get the wrong
answers."
The crowd chuckled.
Though he admitted he regrets
not having the mathematical fore
sight to keep himself in contention
longer, Boge said he was thrilled with
his time on the game show.
"It's been an absolutely fantastic
experience," he said.
