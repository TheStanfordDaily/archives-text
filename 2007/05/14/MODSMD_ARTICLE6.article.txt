Plagued by slips of the tongue, had luck
and a quick-fingered opponent, Craig Boge
'07 had to settle for second place in the 2(X)7
College Jeopardy! Tournament, despite a
strong performance in last week's two-day
final round.
Hie finals, which aired in a two-part se
ries on Thursday and Friday, saw Boge deliv
er uneven performances.
In the first round.he trailed UCLA soph
omore Cliff Galihcr for most of the game.
Though both Boge and Notre Dame fresh

man Christine Kennedy were within strik
ing distance of Galiher's lead, back-to-back
Double Jeopardy! missteps set Boge back
$4.5(X). At the same time, a series of quick
answers raised Galiher's score to $22.6(X),
compared to Boge's $10,900 and Kennedy's
$5,200 at the end of Double Jeopardy!
A tricky Final Jeopardy! question, how

tention. From the category "The Computer
Age," came the clue 'This term still had

$18,100. while Kennedy became a
non-factor with $.V2(X). Suddenly, Boge was
a mere $2.1 (X) from Galiher's lead. The
crowd gathered in Grove Lasuen. where
Boge lives, erupted in cheers.
