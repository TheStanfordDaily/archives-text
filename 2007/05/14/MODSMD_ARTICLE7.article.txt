## Dershowitz calls for a shift in dialogue 
### JAMES HOHMANN ANDREW LEIFER 
Noted Harvard Law Prof. Alan Dershowitz
decried the state of dialogue surrounding the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict on college campuses
during a speech last night in a less-than-half-full
Memorial Auditorium.
"In the place of debate, we have name-calling,
dehumanization, polemics and simply the nam
ing of things in extreme ways," he said." ITiat's not
at all conducive to peace. All I'm doing today is
calling for nuance. I'm calling for an improve
ment in the debate."
Through a 50-minute speech and 40-minute
question-and-answer session. Dershowitz of
fered a measured criticism of Israeli policy while
strongly arguing that the Jewish state was being
unfairly singled out for criticism among its neigh
bors in the region.
A graduate of Yale l aw School. Dershowitz
was the youngest professor in Harvard Law
School's history, when he joined the school's fac
ulty at the ace of 25. Today, he is considered one
of the nation's top civil liberties and
criminal defense lawyers.
In his lecture, Dershowitz was es
pecially pointed in his disdain for
campus divestment campaigns, in
cluding the recent failed proposal at
Stanford. The professor argued that
these campaigns were "filled with ig
norance" and were merely venues for
students to propagate misinformation
about the situation in the Middle
East.
"They serve no purpose at all but
simplify the problem," he said. "Stan
ford will not divest from Israel. It's too
smart. It knows it's not in its econom
ic self-interest. It's also immoral, and
Stanford is a moral institution."
The event, which was free to stu
dents and community members, was
jointly sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. Hillel at Stanford,
the Jewish Student Association and
the Stanford Israeli Alliance.
"We are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of
the world's population, and we get a
disproportionate amount of atten
tion." Dershowitz said.
Dershowitz compared the treat
ment of Arabs in Israel to African
Americans in the United States, say
ing it was "very unsatisfactory, im
proving considerably, but not nearly
improving enough."
His visit prompted a protest by
eight students affiliated with Amnesty
International, who claimed that Der
showitz supports legal exceptions for
torture. The students were dressed in
orange jump suits and had trash bags
pulled over their heads. For about 30
minutes, they sat in a line on the stairs
of Memorial Auditorium with their
heads pointed toward the ground
while three Amnesty volunteers
handed out flyers.
"I found out that Dershowitz was
coming and knew about his stance on
torture so I got some guys together
and signed up with Amnesty," said
Imran Akbar'o7.the lead organizer of
the protest."lt worked out pretty well
I think."
Akbar said that he worried pro
testers might be mistaken as Guan
tanamo Bay detainees, but he ac
knowledged that Dershowitz does
not support the holding of enemy
combatants at the U.S. Naval base in
Cuba.
In his speech Dershowitz said that
he does not support torture, but he
does believe that if torture is going to
happen it must happen in a transpar

ent and verifiable matter.
"In principle, killing one terrorist
to save lots of lives is a tradeoff worth
making," he said. "Don't confuse my
descriptive statement that torture is
occurring with a normative statement
that torture should occur."
Dershowitz also had advice for
students.
"Learn more about the Middle
East." he told The Daily in an inter
view after his speech. "Listen to both
sides. Don't listen to the extremists.
Look at the issue broadly, contextual
ly and conceptually. I lave meetings.
Get together with Palestinian and Is
raeli students."
Dershowitz has been in an ongo
ing feud with Norman Finkelstein, a
controversial professor at DePaul
University in Chicago whose bid for
tenure has brought national atten
tion. Finkelstein spoke on campus in
January in an event sponsored by the
Students Confronting Apartheid by
Israel (SCAI). Dershowitz followed
upon his stinging opinion piece in The
Wall Street Journal on May 4 by at
tacking Finkelstein's scholarship and
views.
"The difference between Finkel
stein and I is when you hear Finkel
stein speak, it is the end of a dialogue."
he said. "When you hear me speak. I
want it to be the beginning of a dia
logue."
Dershowitz said that labeling the
situation in Israel as apartheid is "ab
surd."
Omar Shakir '07, the president of
SCA I, effectively called Dershowitz a
wolf in sheep's clothing. SCAI. under
Shakir, has led the charge for divest
ment from Israel in theASSU Senate.
"I lis inability to be more up front
was couched as nuance but he's de
ceptively trying to justify his extreme
thoughts," Shakir said."He's very ma
nipulative in the way he words things.
He's an excellent lawyer, but if you
look at the views he expresses, they're
very much out of the mainstream."
Carrie Mlynarczyk '09. Co-presi
dent of the Stanford Israel Alliance,
said she appreciated Dershowitz'scall
for an end to name-calling and over
simplification.
"I hope this is the turning point,"
she said, "where we can stop talking
about the divisive measures and start
working toward peace."
Law School Dean Larry Kramer,
who moderated the question-and-an
swer session.said he was impressed by
the respect the audience showed the
speaker.
"The questions were hard."
Kramer said, "but the questions were
civil."

Cuba.
In his speech Dershowitz said that
he does not support torture, but he
does believe that if torture is going to
happen it must happen in a transpar

ent and verifiable matter.
"In principle, killing one terrorist
to save lots of lives is a tradeoff worth
making," he said. "Don't confuse my
descriptive statement that torture is
occurring with a normative statement
that torture should occur."
Dershowitz also had advice for
students.
"Learn more about the Middle
East." he told The Daily in an inter
view after his speech. "Listen to both
sides. Don't listen to the extremists.
Look at the issue broadly, contextual
ly and conceptually. I lave meetings.
Get together with Palestinian and Is
raeli students."
Dershowitz has been in an ongo
ing feud with Norman Finkelstein, a
controversial professor at DePaul
University in Chicago whose bid for
tenure has brought national atten
tion. Finkelstein spoke on campus in
January in an event sponsored by the
Students Confronting Apartheid by
Israel (SCAI). Dershowitz followed
upon his stinging opinion piece in The
Wall Street Journal on May 4 by at
tacking Finkelstein's scholarship and
views.
"The difference between Finkel
stein and I is when you hear Finkel
stein speak, it is the end of a dialogue."
he said. "When you hear me speak. I
want it to be the beginning of a dia
logue."
Dershowitz said that labeling the
situation in Israel as apartheid is "ab
surd."
Omar Shakir '07, the president of
SCA I, effectively called Dershowitz a
wolf in sheep's clothing. SCAI. under
Shakir, has led the charge for divest
ment from Israel in theASSU Senate.
"I lis inability to be more up front
was couched as nuance but he's de
ceptively trying to justify his extreme
thoughts," Shakir said."He's very ma
nipulative in the way he words things.
He's an excellent lawyer, but if you
look at the views he expresses, they're
very much out of the mainstream."
Carrie Mlynarczyk '09. Co-presi
dent of the Stanford Israel Alliance,
said she appreciated Dershowitz'scall
for an end to name-calling and over
simplification.
"I hope this is the turning point,"
she said, "where we can stop talking
about the divisive measures and start
working toward peace."
Law School Dean Larry Kramer,
who moderated the question-and-an
swer session.said he was impressed by
the respect the audience showed the
speaker.
"The questions were hard."
Kramer said, "but the questions were
civil."
