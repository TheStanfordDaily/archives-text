## Campus Arts Double, double toil and Terman 
### EMMA TROTTER INTERMISSION BARD 
If you missed StanShakes' performances of
Macbeth last weekend, you might want to consid
er flying to Scotland to see them perform in the
Fringe Festival in Edinburgh this August. I grew up
watching Shakespeare performed by CalShakes. a
professional group not affiliated uith the school
across the bay and I'm comfortable saying that at
this point in my life I'm something of a Shake
speare snob. So I'm happy to report that the per
formance of Macbeth that 1 went to last Friday
showed every bit of professionalism and originali
ty that I've come to expect.
The show was perhaps stolen a little by Leah
Schwartz's Lady Macbeth, whose glowering
stares, glittering smiles and passionate kisses cap
tivated me even as she slipped into madness. Her
confused husband was played b\ David Terca.
who really came into his element as his character
was consumed by ambition. Other particularly
impressive performances came from Zach
Chotzen-Freund (Macduff) and Lila Kalaf
(I lecate/Lady Macduff).
Ihe entire cast remained onstage for most of
the show, sitting in a semicircle at the back and
sides of the stage, some facing away from the ac
tion and some toward. I"he costumes were mostly
black, brown and white, with a clear contrast be
tween King Duncan's pure white costume and the
Macbeths' completely black attire. As the death
toll mounted throughout the play, the characters
who had killed smeared bloody handprints on a
white sheet pinned to the center of the wall in the
back of the stage.
Ihe stage was the shallow, rectangular pond
below Terman Engineering Building, an interest
ing choice to say the least. The water had been
drained away, but that still left the open-air stage
vulnerable to the hustle and bustle of a fairly cen
tral part of campus. Throughout the play.the head

lights of cars turning from Lomita onto Santa Ter
esa swung eerily across the stage. Lights flicked on
and off in Terman. At one point, a golf cart drove
the length of the stage on the terrace above.
All of this did not detract at all from the play,
but instead added to its spookiness. Most of us
studied Macbeth in high school, where we got lost
in its myriad issus.such as foul versus fair, and am
bition and guilt. Hut enjoyment of Macbeth is not
restricted to English majors, and the StanShakes
production really succeeded in reminding the au
dience that the story is actually quite scary, full of
ghosts,betrayal and murder.
And. of course, witches. If you saw the posters
or programs for the play, you might have noticed
the three masks decorating the otherwise stark,
black bills. In the play, the witches, played by Fa
reez Giga. Julia Meltzer and Jillian Keenan, wore
masks while performing the otherwise traditional
undulating dances around the cauldron (some
times to Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon."
which I was neutral about, though 1 could imagine
it annoyed Shakespeare traditionalists). Another
interesting casting solution here, however, was
that the witches also played roles in the court as
Lennox. Ross and Angus respectively. The mask^

played a particularly fascinating role in a later
scene, which involved all six of those characters as
well as Macbeth and Hecate.
The set also contributed to the creepy image. On
either side of the stage was a strange type of forest
constructed from plywood A-frames.chicken wire,
black cloth and some sort of tree branch, all lit in
red and casting interesting shadows onto the stage.
I lowever. aside from this creepy effect, the set was
not used to its full advantage;characters only inter
acted with the "trees" in the final scenes where
Malcolm's army storms Macbeth's castle.
Some points that detracted from the play were
the mediocre sound effects, which mostly consist
ed of repetitive knocking and bells. Also, parts of
the play which Shakespeare inserted for comic re
lief. such as the drunken porter scene, failed to
draw much laughter from the audience, perhaps a
side effect of an otherwise admirable and success
ful attempt to take the play very seriously. Over
all. however. I commend StanShakes on a job ex
tremely well done. It was well worth braving the
chilly night to watch this play (One audience
member was heard to remark, "We need alco
hol...to warm up"). Break a leg in Scotland this
summer.
