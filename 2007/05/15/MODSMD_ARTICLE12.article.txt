# Students find Google a haven, source of frustration
## Highly popular employer requires up to 12 interviews 
### ELLEN TRUXAW 
As students scramble to finalize summer or
career plans, talk of jobs and internships is
common. One of the most prized and talked
about employers is Google, the tech behome
th based in Mountain View.
Why do so many students apply for jobs at
the Web company founded in 1998 by Stan
ford graduate students Larry Page and Sergey
Brin? When asked, potential candidates list a
number of alluring reasons that include the
chance to be on the cutting edge of technolo
gy and work with intelligent coworkers in a
fun workplace. ITiey also are drawn by the
stock options, numerous domestic and inter
national offices and the free Naked Juice in
the Google Cafe. Others say they apply simply
because all their peers do.
Some of these applicants, who seek posi
tions in all fields from enginnering to market
ing to human resources, discover a Google
that lives up to its hype. For others, the process
fails to meet expectations.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, getting one's hands

on a job at Google isn't easy. Although job list
ings are easily accessible on Google's and the
Career Development Center's Web sites, the
interview process is not as simple. Students de
scribe the interview process as long and disor
ganized, with some sitting through up to
terviews over several weeks.
"Google is really interested in having great
people, and that really does require that they
go through several iterations of interviews,"
said Belsasar Lepe '09, who worked at Google
for two years.
Google did not return calls seeking com
ment over the last week. Current employees
are not allowed to speak with the press without
permission from the the company. However,
Google's Web site states that it is "aggressively
non-discriminatory and favors ability over ex
perience." Moreover. Google recruiters seek
"energetic, innovative thinkers who care
equally about doing great work and develop
ing a culture that's great for all our employees."
Second-year computer science graduate
student Linus Liang, the campus Microsoft
ambassador and an occasional Daily contribu
tor, said that recruiters at the Mountain View
based company poorly communicated his in
terview dates.
"Google has a "you want us more than we

need you' attitude," said Liang.
Sergey Levine '09, who interviewed at
Google, harbored similar feelings about the
firm's attitude.
"At Google, and to a lesser degree at Mi
crosoft. I got a lot of nonsense questions like,
if you drop a ball from a 30-foot building and
it hits a gerbil...'," said Levine. "People who
consider themselves well-educated will take
offense because they should be asked stuff
about computer science, not little riddles that
they got in math club in high school."
Current Yahoo! employee Jenny Qiu "05 was
also turned off by Google's recruiting process.
She explained that because Google was "vague"
about the project she would be working on. she
decided to take a clearer offer from Yahoo!.
The lucky applicants who manage to sur
vive Google's interview process enter what
Lepe described as "a heaven of sorts."
"Once you're in," he said,"l'd be very sur
prised to find people who have qualms with it.
because it's really a great place."
Like any other job. a position with Google
has its ups and downs.
Fortune magazine ranked the company,
which receives 1.300 resumes daily, as the
number one place to work for in 2007 earlier
this year. In the 2006 Universum Survey, un

dergraduates and business-school students
both ranked the company second in its Ideal
Employer Ranking.
These rankings come in spite of employees'
extended hours and work schedules. Lepe de
fended them, saying they were part of the
company's hardworking dynamic.
Google workers "aren't nine-to-fivers," he
said."l'd go into the office on weekends to do
some work and I could always see four or five
other people working there.That was nice."
Liang had a different take.
"If you're going to work for somebody, you
should also have your own life," he said. "I feel
like if you work at Google, you won't really
have that life."
While a job with Google may not be a good
tit (or some applicants, Lepe firmly believes
that the company offers unique benefits.
"Google knows how to take care of its own,"
he said. "It's everything you hear about."
