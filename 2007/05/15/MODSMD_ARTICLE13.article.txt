## Richardson pitches energy policy in Mountain View NM governor stresses energy independence

MOUNTAIN VII W.Calif. (AP)
- Democratic presidential contender
Rill Richardson, previewing the na
tional energy strategy he will unveil
this week,on Monday proposed dra
matic increases in automotive fuel
economy in the next 10 years and
the near-elimination of industrial
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The New Mexico governor and
former U.S. energy secretary called
for "an Apollo program" that would
vault the nation into a massive under
taking to wean itself from fossil fuels.
He also said he would encourage
shared sacrifice, but was quick to add
that under his vision Americans could
keep their SUVs. Those big vehicles
would get better gas mileage, he said.

"We need to become energy-in
dependent." Richardson told about
200 employees of search-engine
giant Google Inc. at its Mountain
View headquarters Monday. "Hav
ing our dependence on foreign oil is
not worth it."
Richardson said he would reduce
U.S. imports of foreign energy from
65 percent to 10 percent; require
that 20 percent of all electricity gen
erated in the United States come
from such power sources as wind or
solar by 2020; and mandate a 90 per
cent greenhouse gas-emission re
duction hv 2050.
And he called for "a massive pub
lic and private investment _ yes. tax
dollars _ in promoting renewable
technologies."
Richardson, who was energy sec
retary in the C linton administration,
was disdainful of President Mush's
announcement Monday that his ad

ministration will decide how to reg
ulate pollution from new motor ve
hicles by the time he leaves office.
Rush signed an executive order di
recting federal agencies to craft reg
ulations that will "cut gasoline con
sumption and greenhouse gas emis
sions from motor vehicles."
The new rules could help Rush
implement his plan to reduce gas
consumption by 20 percent over 10
years.
"It's insufficient," Richardson
said of Rush's plan."lt's weak. It has
no mandates. It's all voluntary."
Richardson said the notion of
sacrifice has been missing during the
Rush administration. He added,
however, that he would not urge
Americans to "stop heating your
home."
"I'd say be more careful, every
body pitch in _ kids, companies, citi
zens," Richardson said. He would en

courage purchases of energy-efficient
appliances, lighting and cars, he said.
"I don't mean sacrifice in a nega
tive way," he said. "1 think sacrifice
(would be) for the common good to
become less energy (dependent) to
countries that jeopardize our na
tional security _ OPEC countries."
Richardson is to outline the com
plete energy proposal on Thursday
in Washington.
Several Democratic presidential
candidates have sought to make en
ergy a centerpiece of their cam
paigns. One, Miliary Rodham Clin
ton. also has called for an "Apollo
program" on energy.
Richardson is the third presiden
tial candidate to submit to a grilling
by employees of Google. Clinton
visited in February, Republican John
McCain earlier this month.
Like the others, Richardson
fielded a scries of questions, first

from moderator Elliot Schrage, a
vice president; then from rank-and
file stall members who queued up at
a microphone. Their questions
ranged from the Iraq war to health
care to genocide in Darfur.
ITie forum prompted an unusual
exchange when a questioner
quizzed Richardson about federal
farm legislation and how it may pro
mote the consumption of junk food.
Richardson began by confessing
he didn t know the answer, then
gave a rambling answer about for
eign policy.
What was the answer you would
have wanted me to give?" he finally
asked, before directing an aide to get
the questioner's contact information.
Find me afterward," the aide,
Adam Steinhorn, shouted to ques
tioner.
"No. no. no. YOU find HER."
Richardson ordered his aide.
