						league of his own: McCain and democracy 
### 
Presidential hopeful John McCain laid
out his vision for American foreign
policy earlier this month, calling for a
return to internationalism and multilateral
ism in a speech at the Hoover Institution.
We are honored that Arizona's senior sena
tor would choose Stanford as the backdrop
upon which to sketch his proposals, but
some ot the ideas he laid out seem to be sim
plistic, pedantic and far-fetched. They have
no business in 21st century American for
eign policy.
For the most part, McCain's vision repre
sents a refreshing return to an America that
values its transatlantic alliances, upholds its
commitments to the Geneva Conventions
and places a premium on supporting free
dom, democracy and civil liberties — even
if this means criticizing our strategic part
ners. McCain's speech culminated, howev
er, in a call for the creation of a "League of
Democracies" that would "form the core of
an international order of peace based on
freedom." It is this initiative that leaves
much to be desired.
The Republican, at the front of the pack
in the race to lead the party, argued that
like-minded democracies could join togeth
er to reinforce NATO and supplant the
United Nations as a legitimate internation
al body that would be critical of human
rights abuses and would support fledgling
democracies across the globe. In theory, this
is an excellent idea; in practice, it is unlikely
to work.The devil lies in the details: Who de
cides which nations are admitted? How
democratic does a democracy have to be?
When a nation backslides out of democracy
(like Russia), who will strip that nation of its
representation? Even if these questions
could be worked out, a new international
body would struggle to find ground not al
ready covered by the UN, NA TO or the GB.
McCain failed to mention that a league

of democracies already exists and that it suf
fers from all of the problems just described.
Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine Al
bright formed the Community of Democra
cies seven years ago with similar intentions.
You probably haven't heard of the Commu
nity of Democracies because — surprise —
it hasn't done anything. Chances are Mc-
Cain's League of Democracies won't be any
different.
Hie aging presidential candidate would
be better off focusing on using American
clout to pressure offending nations, even
those nations with oil. to clean up and im
plement reforms for good governance, ac
countability and human rights. I le even al
luded to this earlier when he encouraged
the formation of a U.S. "diplomatic corps
that understands stability does not mean
supporting dictatorship." We have heard
this language from the current administra
tion before and it proved to be empty rhet
oric. Perhaps McCain will follow through on
his word.
In many ways McCain's speech closely
resembled the one delivered in Chicago a
week prior by fellow candidate and Senator
Barack Obama (10-111.). Both men empha
sized multilateralism and a new leadership
role for America. A call for a League of
Democracies is one of the few concrete
ways that McCain has chosen to differenti
ate himself from Obama and other candi
dates.
Unfortunately McCain has staked his
foreign policy agenda on an initiative that is
weak, unoriginal and ultimately misguided.
The I.eague of Democracies is a strikeout. It
is better for the U.S. to get serious about
pressuring nations to shape up on its own
before it goes slapping together redundant
international institutions. As such, we hope
McCain drops the call for a democratic
league of his own.
