# Degrade me
## 
### 
God, I love being degraded. I love to
be bought, used and trashed. This is
what your fork would say to you if it
could talk. That is. if your fork were
biodegradable.
A biodegradable fork looks like a little
fork that could. It's not quite as sharp or
shiny as your standard white plastic utensil,
but it's sturdy and beige and gets the job
done. You may. in fact, have seen some
biodegradable forks as of late. It seems that
these snazzy items of cutlery are taking the
campus by secret storm. I say secret because
for the most part, these utensils, plates and
takeaway cartons have slid into place slyly
and without fanfare.They've been the prod
uct of student initiatives, dining hall efforts
and cafe participation. All of this is well and
good, but the effort has been unfortunately
disjointed.
But before we address the disjointed
ness, these little beacons of environmental
ism deserve some fanfare, and indeed some
explanation. Stanford's biodegradables un
fortunately seem to be the cause of great be
wilderment. While I was lunching at Tresid
der yesterday, a young man accidentally bit
into his biodegradable fork. He swallowed,
gasped and turned to his friend."l ate it."he
said. "I ate it accidentally. Will I be alright?"
Yes. poor soul. You will be alright.
Not only are people baffled, apparently,
about how to use their biodegradables, but
they're also confused about how to get rid of
them. This is not their fault. The main thing
to be understood about biodegradables is
this: They need to be composted. If thrown
into a normal trash bin, they will be burned
(bad news) or put into a land fill, where they
won't be able to biodegrade (also bad news).
At the Tresidder eateries, a noble week
long campaign was recently waged by stu
dents endeavoring to educate their peers
about the new biodegradable plates and
utensils. These intrepid souls stood next to
newly installed composting bins and exhort
ed their fellow students to dispose of their
waste properly. A whole slew of things can
be composted in Tresidder. including food
waste and napkins, as well as the new
biodegradable products.
Biodegradables are also coming to a
boozed-up party near you. thanks to the ef
forts of the diligent Kathv Cooper (R a stu
dent who has managed to locate biodegrad
able cups as replacements for iconic Red
Cups, which are non-recyclable and are
wasted in the thousands every weekend.
These biodegradable replacement cups
have made successful appearances at Sigma
Nu and Sigma Chi parties, and Kathy is con
tinuing her efforts lo phase them in
throughout the Row.These cups need mere
ly be put in the Row houses' compost bins,
and they'll biodegrade quietly and virtuous
ly. At last, the opportunity to add a bit of
self-righteous environmentalism to a

drunken night of debauchery!
However, not every location on campus
that provides biodegradables has a com
posting bin or instructions about how to
compost. There's really no use purchasing
biodegradables, which are slightly more ex
pensive than regular utensils, it you're not
going to also have a compost bin and edu
cate people about how to use it. It's a waste
of time and money. The necessary compost
bins are notably absent from both LateNite
and the Col 10.
I can't be mad about this, because at least
they're trying to phase in the biodegrad
ables. but I do know that integrating them
into our campus eateries would be easier if
we had someone in charge of it all. So far.
the initiative to use biodegradables has
come mainly from students, who played a
huge part in introducing these products to
Tresidder and other campus eateries. Stan
ford Dining has also taken up the cause.
Right now. the University is burgeoning
with sustainability movements. There's the
Woods Institute, land use programs, recy
cling programs and sustainability coordina
tors who are scattered throughout like liber
ally thrown confetti. But what good does
scattering do for anyone when what we real
ly need is cohesion?
No matter how diligently the students
who are trying to make these biodegrad
ables work, time and money are going to be
lost if we don't get a central force behind
this. Which is why I was surprised and most
of all pleased to hear that the University re
cently decided to create a central sustain
ability office that will hopefully be opera
tional at the start of the next school year.
Hopefully, this office will coordinate with
students to provide the invaluable service of
pulling it all together and setting some offi
cial standards of accountability. Your little
bio-spoon isn't going to degrade itself.
And in case you were interested: Gentle
reader, you can pick up biodegradable uten
sils. plates, etc. at locations such as Ciao
Cafe. Arbuckle Cafe. Tresidder. the CoHo,
the 750 pub. l ag LateNite. and others. You
can purchase morally upright cups from
World Centric, and you can learn more
about biodegradable gear at biodegrad
ablestore.com
