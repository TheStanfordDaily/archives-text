# My teacher

### 
My mom has read pretty much every
thing I have ever written, and no
matter what it is — an essay about
"The Great Gatsby,"a short story written in
first-person slang, a resume — she always
tells me how much she likes it. She's written
me a response email about every single one
ol my columns. She asked me if the village bi
cycle was an allegory for the campus dating
scene. She assured me that I didn't have
manorexia. She always supports the rabble
rousing stuff, though she's quite worried that
Nanci I lowe will kick me out before gradua
tion. She's my number one fan. Except that
she's always asking me to tone down the lan
guage. Mom. this one's for you.
Back before I was born, my mom was a
teacher. That might explain where she got
her infinite patience, which came in handy all
too often while I was growing up. Like all lit
tle kids. I was weird, selfish and unbearably
annoying. 1 didn't like sports, didn't make
friends easily, didn't like doing much of any
thing other than watching TV. I could be a
real brat. I was a picky eater, so I was hell at
restaurants. Until 1 was six, the only fish I
would eat was salmon. She conned me into
trying trout by explaining that it was "white
salmon." Sometimes the best way to teach
someone is to tell a little lie.
My mom has done everything. She was on
yard duty during lunchtime in my elementary
school. She would guest-teach our science
class on those special days when we got to dis
sect things (which meant that each year, like
clockwork, our fridge filled up with pig fetus
es, which is even more awesome than it
sounds). In high school,she was the president
of the Mother's Guild; she judged at my de
bate tournaments and she read over all my es
says, checking for spelling and content. When
I went to Stanford, she joined the Parent's
Club and. besides working on Admit Week
end and Alumni Weekend and practically
every other special event under our blessed
NorCal sun. she comes to campus once a week
delivering birthday cakes that faraway par
ents order for their undergrade Every couple
of months one of my friends will tell me that
my mom just brought them a birthday cake.

She taught me to love the written word by
reading me stories every night. When I was
maybe five or six. 1 started to tiptoe into my
big brother's room and listen to the grown
up stories she'd read to him, out of books that
didn't have pictures, like "The Twenty-One
Balloons." In seventh grade, my English
teacher got mad at me because I was reading
adult books like "Jurassic Park" and "Star
Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Bacta
War" (yup. two colons).
But more than just reading, my mom
taught me how to think. She was raised Pres
byterian. but she led Sunday School at our
Catholic church the whole time I was grow
ing up. She explained the complexities of re
ligion— why my science teacher taught us
about evolution while our religion teacher
taught us about I den. how the Church can
be right about some things but wrong, or just
misinformed, about others. She gave me a
brain that distrusts easy answers.
1 wasn't a bad kid. I never got into fights
and was deathly afraid of making my teach
ers angry. But I was lazy. When I think back
on high school, my defining memory is my
mom storming in front of the TV set during
one of my marathon "Final Fantasy VII "ses
sions. shutting off the TV and telling me that
it wasn't enough for me to just be smart. I had
to find something that I loved to do enough
to put in more than the bare minimum of ef
fort. She wanted to light a fire under me. I
didn't really understand what that meant.
Now. I think it's probably the best thing any
one ever told me.
Every family has its bad spells. I've been
responsible for most of the worst. At the end
of the summer 0f2005,1 got pulled over at six
in the morning with a blood-alcohol-concen

(ration high enough to murder infants. I
called my parents from a jail cell. "Mom," 1
said. I think my mouth made a few more
words, hut it was hard to make them out with
all the embarrassed sobbing and the abject
shame. She Hew down that night and picked
me up from the police station. A month later,
having lost my license and developed a hor
rifically annoying back pain which medical
science still hasn't quite solved, I told her I
thought I was going crazy. She asked me if I
was sleeping well and eating right. Gee, I
said. I guess not. Sometimes the easy answers
are the best answers.
Part of the fun of growing up is learning
that your parents are real people, not just
parents. For many years I took my mom for
granted, not realizing what a unique and,
honestly.cool human being she was. She sees
more movies than I do. It's not uncommon
for her to describe a Dutch film about World
War II during our weekly phone calls. She
got a new computer and went to all those ge
nius classes Apple gives you. and now she
knows more about computers than I do. She
I list learned how to text message. She never
stops moving, never stops trying to explore
some new corner of the world.
I 'm so proud of you. Mom. You inspire me
to be a better person. Your chocolate chip
cookies have become famous on my high
school debate team, in my freshman dorm,
and among the hungry boys of Kappa Sigma.
You make the world a better place,every day
in every way. Thank you for raising me so
well, for showing me how to care about peo
ple. for making me (with love, and some
times, when I was lazy, with force) apply my
self to academics and for always supporting
me even when I was a chubby little kid read
ing comic books and begging for a Nintendo,
llianks for helping me through the bad times
so I could find my way to the good. Thanks
lor teaching me how to be me. I'm still learn
ing. And you're still teaching.

My mom has read pretty much every
thing I have ever written, and no
matter what it is — an essay about
"The Great Gatsby,"a short story written in
first-person slang, a resume — she always
tells me how much she likes it. She's written
me a response email about every single one
ol my columns. She asked me if the village bi
cycle was an allegory for the campus dating
scene. She assured me that I didn't have
manorexia. She always supports the rabble
rousing stuff, though she's quite worried that
Nanci I lowe will kick me out before gradua
tion. She's my number one fan. Except that
she's always asking me to tone down the lan
guage. Mom. this one's for you.
Back before I was born, my mom was a
teacher. That might explain where she got
her infinite patience, which came in handy all
too often while I was growing up. Like all lit
tle kids. I was weird, selfish and unbearably
annoying. 1 didn't like sports, didn't make
friends easily, didn't like doing much of any
thing other than watching TV. I could be a
real brat. I was a picky eater, so I was hell at
restaurants. Until 1 was six, the only fish I
would eat was salmon. She conned me into
trying trout by explaining that it was "white
salmon." Sometimes the best way to teach
someone is to tell a little lie.
My mom has done everything. She was on
yard duty during lunchtime in my elementary
school. She would guest-teach our science
class on those special days when we got to dis
sect things (which meant that each year, like
clockwork, our fridge filled up with pig fetus
es, which is even more awesome than it
sounds). In high school,she was the president
of the Mother's Guild; she judged at my de
bate tournaments and she read over all my es
says, checking for spelling and content. When
I went to Stanford, she joined the Parent's
Club and. besides working on Admit Week
end and Alumni Weekend and practically
every other special event under our blessed
NorCal sun. she comes to campus once a week
delivering birthday cakes that faraway par
ents order for their undergrade Every couple
of months one of my friends will tell me that
my mom just brought them a birthday cake.

She taught me to love the written word by
reading me stories every night. When I was
maybe five or six. 1 started to tiptoe into my
big brother's room and listen to the grown
up stories she'd read to him, out of books that
didn't have pictures, like "The Twenty-One
Balloons." In seventh grade, my English
teacher got mad at me because I was reading
adult books like "Jurassic Park" and "Star
Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Bacta
War" (yup. two colons).
But more than just reading, my mom
taught me how to think. She was raised Pres
byterian. but she led Sunday School at our
Catholic church the whole time I was grow
ing up. She explained the complexities of re
ligion— why my science teacher taught us
about evolution while our religion teacher
taught us about I den. how the Church can
be right about some things but wrong, or just
misinformed, about others. She gave me a
brain that distrusts easy answers.
1 wasn't a bad kid. I never got into fights
and was deathly afraid of making my teach
ers angry. But I was lazy. When I think back
on high school, my defining memory is my
mom storming in front of the TV set during
one of my marathon "Final Fantasy VII "ses
sions. shutting off the TV and telling me that
it wasn't enough for me to just be smart. I had
to find something that I loved to do enough
to put in more than the bare minimum of ef
fort. She wanted to light a fire under me. I
didn't really understand what that meant.
Now. I think it's probably the best thing any
one ever told me.
Every family has its bad spells. I've been
responsible for most of the worst. At the end
of the summer 0f2005,1 got pulled over at six
in the morning with a blood-alcohol-concen

(ration high enough to murder infants. I
called my parents from a jail cell. "Mom," 1
said. I think my mouth made a few more
words, hut it was hard to make them out with
all the embarrassed sobbing and the abject
shame. She Hew down that night and picked
me up from the police station. A month later,
having lost my license and developed a hor
rifically annoying back pain which medical
science still hasn't quite solved, I told her I
thought I was going crazy. She asked me if I
was sleeping well and eating right. Gee, I
said. I guess not. Sometimes the easy answers
are the best answers.
Part of the fun of growing up is learning
that your parents are real people, not just
parents. For many years I took my mom for
granted, not realizing what a unique and,
honestly.cool human being she was. She sees
more movies than I do. It's not uncommon
for her to describe a Dutch film about World
War II during our weekly phone calls. She
got a new computer and went to all those ge
nius classes Apple gives you. and now she
knows more about computers than I do. She
I list learned how to text message. She never
stops moving, never stops trying to explore
some new corner of the world.
I 'm so proud of you. Mom. You inspire me
to be a better person. Your chocolate chip
cookies have become famous on my high
school debate team, in my freshman dorm,
and among the hungry boys of Kappa Sigma.
You make the world a better place,every day
in every way. Thank you for raising me so
well, for showing me how to care about peo
ple. for making me (with love, and some
times, when I was lazy, with force) apply my
self to academics and for always supporting
me even when I was a chubby little kid read
ing comic books and begging for a Nintendo,
llianks for helping me through the bad times
so I could find my way to the good. Thanks
lor teaching me how to be me. I'm still learn
ing. And you're still teaching.
