## Golf rolls at Regional, headed for NCAAs Tie for first place sends Stanford squad into championships 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Over the weekend, the No. 14 Stanford women's golf
team proved all of its doubters wrong by proving it too
could compete and win against the cream of the crop.
All it took was the right moment, and perhaps the right
mindset.
After three grueling days of competition, the Stanford
women finished the 2007 NCAA West Regional with a
share of the team title. With the tie for first place, the Car
dinal advances to the NCAA Division 1 Women's Golf
Championships held May 22-25 at the LPGA Interna
tional Legends Course in Daytona Beach. Fla.
Stanford will be among the 24 teams advancing, in
cluding six individual participants. As a testament to the
depth of the Pacific-10 Conference, an incredible five
teams — a full half of the Pac-10 — have qualified for the
Championships.
In the West Regional. Stanford took first while top
ranked Arizona State came in third. In the Central Re
gional. No. 8 Southern California came out on top. while
No. 16 Arizona took fifth. Finally, in the East Regional,
No. 9 UCLA came in second behind the defending na
tional champion. No. 2 Duke.
The path to victory was not easy for Stanford. In fact,
it required a tremendous final day to catch up to No. 11
Oklahoma State.

Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club in St. George.
Utah, the Card found itself six strokes behind the surging
Cowgirls.
But with a three-under 287 final round, Stanford had
done what it hadn't in a while: won the big one against
some of the nation's top teams. The Cardinal women's
three-round total of 874 (287-300-287) gave them a two
stroke victory over third-place finisher Arizona State
(294-296-286—876).
From the regional competitions, the top-eight teams
and top-two individuals advance to the championships.
Rounding off the top eight from the West are No. 20 Den
ver. No. 15 Brigham Young, UC-lrvine, No. 4 Pepperdine
and No. IS New Mexico. A notable omission from the ad
vancing teams is No. 7 Florida, which fell two strokes shy
of the mark.
Once again, Stanford was led by sophomore Mari
Chun, whose one-over 214 (73-72-69) tied her for third in

GA iiOK By combining to shoot a three-over-par 287 on the final
day of competition, the Stanford women charged into a tie for first place
at the NCAA West Regional this past weekend in St. George, Utah. The
Cardinal finished with a team score of 874-—good enough to earn a
spot in the 24-team field at the NCAA championships. Sophomore Mari
Chun paced the Stanford squad with a three-round score of 214, which
placed her in a tie for third among the individual participants.

Wang (73-73-74), who both finished with a final tally of
220 (seven over par). Fellow teammate and senior Lau
ren Todd (72-76-77) ended in 24th with a 12-over 225,
while freshman Angela King (79-79-72) tied for 48th with
a 230.
What separated this tournament from any in the past
was Stanford's ability to finish strong. Prior to the West
Regional, the Cardinal seemed to have fallen into a habit
of jumping out to an early lead before faltering in the
later rounds.
That wasn't the case last weekend as a mighty team ef
fort from all five golfers combined to set a different tone.
Emerging as a future team leader, Chun shot her best
round on the final day with a two-under 69. Tangtiphai
boontana bounced back from a terrible second round to
post a one-over 72. Even the freshman King contributed
with a one-over 72 — notably better than her previous
rounds of 79 each. Wang, another freshman, concluded on
a strong note with a three-over 74 on the final day of play.
It seems that a different mindset fueled the Stanford
charge as well. By going head-to-head against the course
itself rather than head-to-head against the other teams,
Stanford seemingly settled upon an effective approach to
its game.
Hie only question remaining now is whether or not
Stanford can bring the NCAA Championship back home
to the Farm by repeating its recent, inspired effort in Day-
