# Men's crew can't pace Pac-10 rivals
## Cardinal enters three races, earns three bronze medals 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 6 Stanford men's crew team fell
into order behind No. 1 Washington and No.
3 California this past weekend at the Pacific
-10 Conference Championships. After a dis
appointing finish, though, the Cardinal is
looking to break that order in time for the
IRA Regatta in June.
Racing on Lake Natoma in Rancho Cor
dova, C alif., this past weekend, Stanford was
looking to top the Bears yet again after beat
ing its cross-bay rival at the San Diego Crew
Classic a month ago. Also in the Cardinal's
sights were the undefeated I luskies.
In Sunday's final, though, the Cardinal
just couldn't pull it off, taking bronze behind
Washington and Cal (who finished first and
second, respectively) in all three of its events:
the varsity, second varsity and novice eights.
"We're disappointed that we didn't have
more speed, that we didn't demonstrate the
speed we're capable of in the final," said sen
ior Donny Simkin. a member of the varsity
eight.
Hie varsity team — composed of Simkin,
seniors Nate Rooks and Kevin Baum, soph
omores Mark Murphy and Alex Osborne,
juniors Silas Stafford, Dave Creighton and
Ottavio Siani and sophomore coxswain
Ariel Dixon —in particular was a disap
pointment for Stanford. The Cardinal, with a
time of 5:53.0, finished 6.8 seconds behind
leading Washington (5:46.2) and 5.2 seconds
behind Cal (5:47.8).
lor head coach Craig Amerkhanian, the
problems were immediate.
"I was really disappointed with our varsi
ty eight, especially' when we gave up two sec
onds in the first 500 meters." he said. "It's a
2.000-meter race, so that's a substantial
deficit to make up against two top teams like
Cal and Washington."
Simkin also pointed out the team's poor
performance throughout the race. After
weeks of preparation, Stanford just couldn't
realize its game plan, and ii couldn't realize
its potential.
"We have the speed — we just didn't
demonstrate it at all this weekend." he said.
"We have the potential to race both of
them, and we have the potential to beat
both of them."
As for why the Cardinal didn't execute,
Simkin was less certain.
"I don't think anything in particular
went wrong, we just couldn't find our
rhythm or what we like to call our free
speed," he said. "Some people got into bad
habits from previous races, but there was
nothing really tangible; no palpable mis
take."
In the coming weeks, Simkin said the
team will have to switch things up, trying out
new combinations of its current varsity
eight lineup, which has lasted since the
team's first races this season.
"When you have the same lineup for the
entire season, there starts to be, not a com

placency. but a staleness to what you do:
people fall into old habits," Simkin said.
"Hopefully,by moving people into different
positions and giving them a different role in
the eight, we can realize that speed we
have."
The Cardinal will also consider new
blades and a change of shell for its boat, but
according to Simkin, "it'll all be some win
dow dressing-type things to build up our
confidence."
"At this point in the season there's not a
lot you can do to get faster." he added.
"There's not much we can change, but
hopefully the changes will make the things
we do work on [in terms of speed] more im
mediate."
And with the IRA Regatta — the na
tional championship event —just over two
and a half weeks away. Stanford will need to
put its speed to the test and ensure that it
comes through when it again faces Cal and
Washington, as well as East Coast schools
like No. 2 Harvard, No. 4 Yale and No. 5
Brown.
"We just rowed to the worst of our po
tential [this past weekend]," Simkin said.

GAME NOTES The highly anticipated Pac-10 Champi

Washington didn't turn out the way the members of
the Stanford men's team had hoped it would, but the
Cardinal still performed well enough to bring home
three bronze medals from Lake Natoma in Rancho
Cordova, Calif. Competing against what head
coach Craig Amerkhanian called "the nation's
toughest rowing conference," each of the three
boats Stanford entered placed third, ahead of every
one except the Bears and the Huskies.

"We have the potential to race quickly, and
we have the potential to race slowly. Right
now. the discrepancy is just too wide."
