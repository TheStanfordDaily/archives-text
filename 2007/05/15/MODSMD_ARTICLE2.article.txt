# Panel discusses future of the newspaper
## Industry leaders analyze role of news in a changing world 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Journalists and readers concerned with
the fate of the printed newspaper packed
into Cubberley Auditorium last night eager
to hear a panel of media executives answer
a pressing question: Can newspapers sur

vive in the new world of journalism?
"Other forms of media are usurping
America's need for a daily newspaper," said
visiting Journalism Prof. Joel Brinkley, who
moderated the event and offered conven
tional wisdom about the withering state of
the business. "They're in trouble across the
country...And those problems are more dire
than most people know.
All four panelists said they thought the
newspaper would survive and agreed that a
healthy newspaper was important, but none
claimed to know with certainly what the

medium will look like decades down the
road.
Google's vice president in charge of
search products and user experience, Maris
sa Mayer '97 M.S. '99, suggested that the fu
ture of journalism may lie in the hands of My-
Space and Facebook reporters, who would
write first-hand reports that could be edited
and aggregated by citizen journalists.The fu
turistic idea, which she attributed to Google
CEO Eric Schmidt, drew some incredulous
laughs from a mostly older audience.
"Our users want information that's verv

urgent, like breaking news," she said."So for
us it's very important to have that informa
tion in our index, so we can include it in our
products."
The 41st annual Carlos Kelly McClatchy
Memorial Symposium was sponsored by
the McClatchy Company, whose CEO Gary
Pruitt was a panelist last night.
"There's a big print audience still in exis
tence here," Pruitt said. "That's not the pro
file of a dying industry."

A panel of news industry executives including (from left to right) Harry Chandler, heir to the Chandler fortune; Bill Keller, executive editor of the New York Times; Marissa
Mayer, a vice president of Google; and Gary Pruitt, CEO of The McClatchy Company discussed the future of print journalism Monday night in Cubberley Auditorium.
An optimistic Pruitt stressed the
importance of a thriving press in a
democratic government.
"I ; rom the early days of our coun
try. democracy and journalism have
been partners." he said. "The stakes
are very high here."
Hill Keller, executive editor of The
New York limes, said that newsgath
ering helps the people keep track of
what government and institutions are
doing.
" ITiere is stuff going on out there,"
he said."and if we don't understand it.
it's not |list the newspaper industry'

that suffers."
Pruitt and Keller pointed out that
the newspaper industry must be will
ing to adapt to new technology. Pruitt
reminded the audience that newspa
pers have survived the popularity of
the telegraph, radio and television,
even though analysts once warned
each would harm the traditional print
newspaper.
"We just need to be adaptable." he
said, citing Charles Darwin, "and
we've clearly done that throughout
history."
"We face a wrenching transition,"
Keller added,"and at the end of it our
newspapers may or may not be paper,
but. as the saying goes, they will still be
black, white and read all over."
Only Mayer and Pruitt stayed
until the end of the event; Keller and

I iarry Chandler, an heir to the Chan
dler family fortune from Hie I .os An
geles Times, left early to catch (lights.
Chandler, whose family largely
sold its stake in the Tribune Co. to bil
lionaire Sam Zell last month, de
scribed himself as "more pessimistic
than what you've heard."
"The bad news is pretty clear," he
said. "The newspaper business model
is pretty out of whack, and 1 don't
even know what a whack is. I think
we're five to 10 years away from find
ing where the stasis is. and there will
be a lot of pain before we get there."
Chandler also suggested media ti
tans consider privatization of the
media, outsourcing reporting jobs to
India and holding editors to business
benchmarks — ideas he acknowl
edged were highly controversial.

"Television has done this for
years, "lie said."lt'scalled ratings,and
people live by them."
Pruitt described journalism's "cen
tral mission" as four-fold.
"It is our duty to speak the truth
about power," he said, "hold govern
ment accountable, build community
cohesion and give voice to the voice
less."
Keller tried to soothe those who
will have the wherewithal to think
positively about the long term while
adapting to the changing business
model of the industry.
"Newspapers that resist the panic
around them," he said,"and stay true
to their mission will endure."
