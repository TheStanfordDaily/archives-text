# Panel discusses future of the newspaper
## Industry leaders analyze role of news in a changing world 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Journalists and readers concerned with
the fate of the printed newspaper packed
into Cubberley Auditorium last night eager
to hear a panel of media executives answer
a pressing question: Can newspapers sur

vive in the new world of journalism?
"Other forms of media are usurping
America's need for a daily newspaper," said
visiting Journalism Prof. Joel Brinkley, who
moderated the event and offered conven
tional wisdom about the withering state of
the business. "They're in trouble across the
country...And those problems are more dire
than most people know.
All four panelists said they thought the
newspaper would survive and agreed that a
healthy newspaper was important, but none
claimed to know with certainly what the

medium will look like decades down the
road.
Google's vice president in charge of
search products and user experience, Maris
sa Mayer '97 M.S. '99, suggested that the fu
ture of journalism may lie in the hands of My-
Space and Facebook reporters, who would
write first-hand reports that could be edited
and aggregated by citizen journalists.The fu
turistic idea, which she attributed to Google
CEO Eric Schmidt, drew some incredulous
laughs from a mostly older audience.
"Our users want information that's verv

urgent, like breaking news," she said."So for
us it's very important to have that informa
tion in our index, so we can include it in our
products."
The 41st annual Carlos Kelly McClatchy
Memorial Symposium was sponsored by
the McClatchy Company, whose CEO Gary
Pruitt was a panelist last night.
"There's a big print audience still in exis
tence here," Pruitt said. "That's not the pro
file of a dying industry."
