Brown's title winning run in the 1,500-meter event.

records weren't everything in a challenging
weekend for the Cardinal.
"Ihe numbers fail to show how much heart
all the men and women put out there." the co
captain said. "It was frustrating to come up
short of the [Pac-10] title. To see that the
women were able toscore 134 points,even with
the little spurts of bad luck that we had, makes
me really proud of what everyone did over the
weekend."
Ihc men entered the final day's events in sixth
place with a score of 26 points. During day one
of the meet, senior Michael Robertson had a
school record-shattering throw of 205-09
(62.71 m) in the discus event and ended in sec
ond place. Meanwhile, junior Graeme Hoste
lilted himself to fourth place in the pole vault
event with his season-best mark of 17-06 1/2
feet (5.35 meters).
The women's squad was in fourth place
after the first day of competition with a score of
31.33. But the Cardinal came back during day
two to overcome both UCLA and Southern
California during the final events and secure
second place.
On Saturday,the first Cardinal woman to win a
Pac-10 title was junior Teresa Mc Walters, who
dominated the field with her time of 35:10.62 in
the 10.000-meter run. McWalters. also a cross
country runner,saw the two sports' differences
in her race.
"When Amy [Hastings of Arizona; 2nd
place finisher) and I broke away with five kilo
meters to go. that gave me a lot of confidence,"
she said."l felt really comfortable and smooth.
I kept feeding off of the energy. I like to think of
cross country as blood and guts â€” you don't
have to be particularly quick, you just need to
have guts and heart. On the track, though, it
seems more strategic."
Also on Saturday, junior Erica McLain
launched her way across the pit to finish second
in the women's long jump, posting her season
best distance of 21-02 1/2 feet (6.49 meters).
Mcl.ain extended her performance into Sun
day's events, successfully defending her title in
the women's triple-jump competition by earn
ing her fifth career Pac-10 championship with
an American collegiate record mark of 46-05
I /4 feet (14.15 meters).
Mcl Klin's triple-jump distance was only five
meters off of the (Jlympic "A" standard, and the
junior talked about her plans to participate in
the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
"[Mv triple-jump length) sets me up really
well, not only for NCA As,but also for trying to
make the Olympics, "Mcl.ain said."My parents

Junior Russell Brown distanced himself from the pack in the 1,500-meter event this weekend,
catching glimpses of his competitors only when he took time to glance up at the Jumbotron.
