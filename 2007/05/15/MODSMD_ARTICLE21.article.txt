# Cardinal out to tame Broncos
## Baseball looks to ovoid being swept by Santa Clara 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
riiesday-nigbt matchups against Santa Clara
have been unusually tough for Stanford base
ball this entire season. Looking to build on a se
ries win over Washington this past weekend the
Cardinal gets its last crack at the Broncos this
year tonight at Stephen Schott Stadium.
What has made the difference in the season
series thus far has been Santa ( lara's ottensive
production — the Cardinal (21-27. 6-15 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) has been outscored 35-16 bv
the Broncos in three straight losses. Over that
span. Santa Clara is averaging over 13 runs per
nine innings against six Stanford pitchers.
Sloppy defense in crucial situations has also
hurt Stanford. The Cardinal has committed
four errors in the season series versus Santa
Clara, leading to three runs which were all ei
ther go-ahead or insurance runs.
In the two teams last meeting two weeks
agoat Sunken Diamond,the Broncos (25-28,9-
12 West Coast Conference) jumped out to a 9-
0 lead in the top of the first inning and never
looked back, eventually winning 16-8. Nathan
Faulkner set a career high for hits in a game by
going a perfect five-for-five at the plate.
But Stanford is coming off its own offensive
explosion, as the squad had 16 hits in Sunday's
rubber-match win over Washington, 10-7. Led
by junior Michael Taylor (3-4), six Stanford
players had multi-hit games. The weekend also
brought Stanford's first Pac-10 series victo, • of
the year, and its first in seven chances.The Car
dinal's last conference series victory came
against Washington during the same weekend
of last season.
"It was good to get the series win," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess told
GoStanford.com. "Our guys have kept work
ing throughout the season, and this is a bit of a
reward for that work."
On the season, Taylor is four for 11 with a
home run and four B1 against the Santa Clara
staff, while sophomore centerfielder Sean
Ratliff leads the U im with seven hits in 15 at
bats.
The Broncos rank in the middle of the WCC
in both batting average (.284. sixth) and E : .RA

(4.34, fourth).
Santa Clara has not swept a season series
from the Cardinal since winning all three
games in 1974.
Tuesday's probable pitching matchups have
yet to be announced, but the Cardinal has used
a different starter in each of its three games
against the Broncos — freshman Brandt Walk
er, junior David Stringer and sophomore
Austin Yount.
ITiis is the second-to-last Tuesday-night
game of the season for Stanford, which will
play a three-game set this coming weekend
against Pacific. Not including an exhibition
game against Japan's Rikkyo University, Stan
ford is an even 4-4 in midweek games this year.
Stanford must finish 7-1 to avoid finishing
under .500 on the season for the first time since
1993.
First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m. tonight.
