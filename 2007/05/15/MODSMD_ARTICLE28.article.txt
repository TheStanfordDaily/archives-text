Nf W YORK I irst impressions sometimes cre
ate lasting images, and so it is with Chelsea Clinton '01.
l or many. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's
daughter is still a curly-haired 12-year-old with braces
and a shy smile â€” the first "first kid"since Amy Carter
to spend her formative years in the White House.
Chelsea Clinton now is a 27-year-old single woman
working in the financial sector in New York City. With
her mother's trailblazing quest to win the presidency in
2008. the nation could see Chelsea Clinton return to the
White 1 louse in a very different role.as an occasional vis
itor or perhaps even a bride at a White I louse wedding.
Chelsea Clinton has kept a low profile since her
mother joined the presidential field in January. She
has yet to speak publicly about the prospect of becom
ing "first kid" a second time.
Hut those who know her describe an exceptionally
bright and grounded young woman who will decide
for herself what role to play in her mother's campaign.
"She's not a child living in the White House any
more. so it's entirely different this time." said Lisa Ca
puto. who was Hillary Clinton's press secretary in Bill
Clinton's first term. "But Chelsea is such a poised
young lady in her own right, if anyone has the maturi
ty to deal with the situation, it's her."
Even so. the Clintons are mindful of their daugh
ter's privacy and have been determined to protect her
from the campaign fishbowl. Requests for interviews
with Chelsea Clinton for this story were declined.
"She is an adult, so she gets to make those decisions
for herself." Hillary Clinton said in an Associated
Press interview in lowa last weekend when asked
what her daughter might do in the campaign.
Former President Clinton recently said the family
was determined to let Chelsea live as normally as pos
sible for as much of the campaign.
"She has got her own life to live. She works. She
does her own range of other activities." Clinton said in
a CNN interview. "She cares a lot about politics and
she wants her mom to win. But she has got a life to live
and we don't want to interrupt that."
To be sure.Chelsea Clinton has not been absent total
ly from her mother's efforts. She recently joined her par
ents onstage at a campaign fundraiser in Manhattan, but
did not address the audience. Hillary Clinton often de

scribes how being a mom has shaped her candidacy.
Advisers say Chelsea Clinton probably will step up
appearances later in the campaign as she did in 2000.
during the closing months of her mother's first Senate
race in New York.
Neel Lattimore. who as an assistant to then-first
lady Hillary Clinton helped shield Chelsea from the
media during her teenage years, said Chelsea will de
cide for herself what level of privacy she can expect
during the campaign.
"She'll merit protection based on her own ac
tions.-' 1 attimore said. "The wider you open the door,
the more you put yourself in a situation where you
lose the privacy you want. She really values her per
sonal privacy, so that's why she can be with her mom
and campaign with her mom but not speak if she
chooses."
For now Chelsea is busy with her work at Avenue
Capital, a $12 billion New York-based hedge fund run
by Marc l.asry, a longtime Clinton donor. Avenue
Capital employees have contributed more than
$30,000 to Miliary Clinton's presidential bid so far.

Chelsea often is spotted around New York with her
boyfriend. Marc Mezvinsky, an investment banker
and the son of former Democratic Reps. Ed Mezvin

Pennsylvania.
Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky have known
each other since they were teenagers in Washington.
