## Gender gap in sciences narrows at California universities 
### BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO — The gap between women and
men receiving doctorates in science and math from Cali
fornia universities is narrowing, state data shows.
The number of women earning doctoral degrees in
computer science, the physical sciences, mathematics and
engineering has jumped about 30 percent over the past
decade, according to a Sacramento Bee analysis of state
higher education trends.
Between 1994 and 19%. 527 women received doctor
ates in those disciplines from the University of California
system, according to the California Postsecondary Edu
cation Commission.
From 2003 to 2005. the most recent years available,
the number rose to 681. shrinking the men-to-women
gender gap in the UC system from 4.8 to 1 a decade ago
to 3.5 to 1.
In California's private colleges, the number of women
earning doctorates in those four fields jumped about 30
percent between 1993-1995 and 2002-2004.
ITie state's numbers outstrip national trends, where
the number of women earning doctorates in math, com
puter science,physical science and engineering increased
by almost 20 percent from 1997 to 2004, according to the
National Science Foundation.
Experts and students attribute the increase to a
"snowball effect," with women scientists and teachers
staking out territory in traditionally male-dominated dis
ciplines to create a friendlier academic climate for other
women.
"The more you see positive female role models in our
institutions, the more you are going to see yourself ... in
those disciplines." said Kirsten Sanford. president of the
Sacramento Valley Chapter of the Association for
Women in Science.
