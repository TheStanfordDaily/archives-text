# STUDENT GROUPS
## Workshop to relieve stress Effort to help students 'relax' comes with adamant fervor 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Student volunteers for The Art of Living radi
ate enough enthusiasm for the battle on stress that
their advertisement for meditation and breathing
techniques may be mistaken for proselytizing.
The official student group, which is the Stan
ford chapter of the United Nations-chartered
non-governmental organization (NGO) of the
same name, is hosting an on-campus workshop
that begins today and runs through the end of the
week. Organizers promise that any student or
community member can get a prescription for a
more relaxed life — provided they are willing to
shell out the $200 registration fee.
"The number one predictor of well-being is a
sense of connectedness and belonging," said Psy
chology Ph.D. candidate Emma Seppala. one of
the leaders of the Art of Living group at Stanford.
"Stress is a state of extreme self-focus. On a daily
basis we aren't able to attend to others."
"Psychology has very little to offer as far as
pragmatic tools aside from going to the mental
health clinic," she added.
Providing practical techniques to reduce stress
is what Art of Living was founded to accomplish.
Started 25 years ago by the Indian guru Sri Sri
Ravi Shankar. the foundation has chapters in 140
countries on six continents and is dedicated to em
powering everyone — from students at elite col
leges and corporate executives to downtrodden
workers and terrorists.
Art of Living members at Stanford assert that
the workshop is precisely what the campus needs.
"Stress has gotten worse and
worse on campus with all the sui
cides and everything," Seppala said.
"Fifty percent of students experi
ence some form of stress or anxiety."
Art ol Living teacher Dinesh
(ihodke. a founder of the youth
NC iO World Alliance for Youth Em
powerment. Hew in from India to
teach the "YESI+" workshop at
Stanford, (ihodke agreed that the
sessions are the answer to the stress
that university students feel.
In the months leading lip to the
conference, the leaders of Stan
ford's Art of I.ivinggroup have been
leading short meditation sessions
designed to inspire students to take
the course. These sessions have
taken place in dorms, in the Gradu
ate Community Center and even
during a I rosh Council session.
Some ol the sessions have dif
fered from what was expected.
When chemistry graduate student
Dchanti Sengupta, one of the lead
ers ol the Art ol Living at Stanford,
showed up to present before Frosh
Council, her audience was sur
prised.
"It w.is strange in that we expect
ed stress relief techniques, whereas
they presented on a meditation style
and a more philosophical approach
to handling stress." said Anna Ho
*04. the administrator in the Fresh

man Dean's Office responsible for
Frosh Council, in an email.
Art of Living sessions have also
included some meditation and
breathing techniques, such as
breathing slowly with closed eyes.
Another involved placing two fin
gers on the bridge of the nose and
closing the right and left nostrils in
turn, allowing air to flow on alter
nating sides.
The techniques are designed to
reduce stress and bring inner peace,
according to Seppala, who added
that they work wonderfully.
"People in the psych department
come up and ask me.'What are you
on?"' she said. "My life has become
so much more peaceful."
For his part. Ghodke is so certain
of his workshop's success that he as
serts that attendance should be
mandatory. Attending the work
shop. he said, is more important than
anything else.
"If [students] are busy, all the
more reason they should do some
thing like this," Ghodke said. "At a
university [in India], no matter who
comes through they have to take a
[computer science] course.This kind
of training is even more fundamen
tal. more basic and it is kind of ig
nored."
"Everybody's seeking, but in
seeking they tend to go to the wrong
things," he added." Ihis is an invest
ment which reflects on everything a
student does."
