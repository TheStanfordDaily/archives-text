## Workshop to relieve stress Effort to help students 'relax' comes with adamant fervor 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Student volunteers for The Art of Living radi
ate enough enthusiasm for the battle on stress that
their advertisement for meditation and breathing
techniques may be mistaken for proselytizing.
The official student group, which is the Stan
ford chapter of the United Nations-chartered
non-governmental organization (NGO) of the
same name, is hosting an on-campus workshop
that begins today and runs through the end of the
week. Organizers promise that any student or
community member can get a prescription for a
more relaxed life — provided they are willing to
shell out the $200 registration fee.
"The number one predictor of well-being is a
sense of connectedness and belonging," said Psy
chology Ph.D. candidate Emma Seppala. one of
the leaders of the Art of Living group at Stanford.
"Stress is a state of extreme self-focus. On a daily
basis we aren't able to attend to others."
"Psychology has very little to offer as far as
pragmatic tools aside from going to the mental
health clinic," she added.
Providing practical techniques to reduce stress
is what Art of Living was founded to accomplish.
Started 25 years ago by the Indian guru Sri Sri
Ravi Shankar. the foundation has chapters in 140
countries on six continents and is dedicated to em
powering everyone — from students at elite col
leges and corporate executives to downtrodden
workers and terrorists.
Art of Living members at Stanford assert that
the workshop is precisely what the campus needs.
