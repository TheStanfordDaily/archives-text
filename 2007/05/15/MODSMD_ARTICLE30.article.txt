### BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
After months of heated debate. University of Califor
nia faculty overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to ban
university researchers from taking tobacco company
money.
The assembly of UC's Academic Senate voted 43-4 last
Wednesday, with three absentions, against a proposal
brought by members of the university's governing board
to sever financial ties between the tobacco industry and
faculty research.
Supporters argued that the tobacco industry's reputa
tion for downplaying the health effects of smoking taint
ed studies it funded. But opponents, including top UC
administrators, said it would be a mistake to forfeit an
entire industry's support because of its perceived moral
character.

"All of us are torn between hating the tobacco indus
try and wanting freedom of research, but I think I come
down on the side of freedom of research," UCLA com
parative literature Professor Kathleen Komar said dur
ing a half-hour debate that preceded the vote at a meet
ing in Oakland.
The Academic Senate's position will be forwarded to
the UC Board of Regents, which is scheduled to consider
the proposal in July and is expected to accept the assem
bly's advice.
The regents put off making a decision when the issue
came before the board in January, saying they wanted a
better idea of where campus faculty stood.
