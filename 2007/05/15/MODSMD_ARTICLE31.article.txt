# Colleges turn to student bloggers for unvarnished view of student life
##

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Michael Chandler is a college
student who's had it with parking tickets at Ball State
University.
"1 swear that's where most of BSU's money comes
from." Chandler groused recently on his blog. "They
hand'em out left and right, without a care in the world."
Far from getting irritated. Ball State University in
Muncie, Ind.. welcomes the blog. The school promotes
the interactive online diary and several other unfiltered
student blogs directly on its home page as a recruiting
tool.
Colleges seeking a competitive edge are increasingly
enlisting and sometimes paying student bloggers to
chronicle their lives online.
The results run the gamut from insightful to boring,
but the goal is the same: to find a new way to win the at
tention of the MySpace generation.
"We found it a much freer, less constricting, far more
believable way of letting prospective students glimpse
what was going on on campus," said Seth Allen, dean of
admissions at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.
Universities balance giving the bloggers the freedom
to speak their mind while maintaining some control over
content.
Some, such as Dickinson, read postings before allow
ing them on the Web site to guard against offensive lan
guage. Others, like Ball State, say that defeats the pur
pose.
Prospective students can easily compare students'
thoughts with comments on online networking sites like
MySpace or Facebook.com, said Nancy Prater, Ball
State's Web coordinator.
"It that doesn't match what they're saying on our
blogs, there's a disconnect," Prater said.
Colleges from Colgate University in upstate New
York, a small liberal arts campus, to the University of
Texas, one of the country's largest universities, now in
clude links to student bloggers on their home pages.
The emergence of the blogs is the next step in the evo
lution of admissions recruiting, said Barmak Nassirian,
associate executive director for the American Associa
tion of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
