## Cause of low school ratings: principals Lack of "coaching" cited for faults in California public school system 
### JORDAN CHAZIN 
Stanford's Institute for Research on Education Policy
and Practice (IREPP) recently completed a comprehen
sive study called "Getting Down to Facts," which com
bined 23 independent reports to analyze the reasons be
hind the California public school system's poor perform
ance and examined the state's school governance and fi
nance systems.
The quality of public school principals was a primary
focus of the 18-month study, and Education Prof, l.inda
Darling-Hammond co-authored one of the 23 reports,
called "Leadership Development in California," with Ste
lios Orphanos, a graduate student in the School of Educa
tion. They focused on the direct correlation between the
quality of a school's performance and the leadership back
ground of the school's principal, finding that schools with
poor academic records typically had principals with inade
quate leadership training.
The researchers cited a lack of personalized principal
training, known as "coaching," as the reason for Califor
nia's poor public school ratings. The California School
Leadership Academy (CSLA),a program that was former
ly used to train principals, was cut in 2(X)3 due to a lack of
funding..
Ryan Kawamoto, assistant to California State Assem
blymember Michael Feuer, has helped develop a leader
ship bill that would create a new coaching program.
"There is a split of ideology regarding the current pro
grams of leadership training." he said. "Some believe that
they work line, but others are calling for something similar
to what we had back with the CSLA."
"Darling-Hammond's research has been very helpful
to us during this policy-making process," he added. "We
see now that certain aspects of the CSLA, such as coach
ing, were empirically beneficial to improving leadership
performance."
The Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning
(CFTL) has taken Darling-Hammond's lead by imple
menting proactive steps with the goal of turning around
California's school system. CFTL
plans to launch a state-wide initia
tive early in 2(M)H.
This initiative, according to
CTT'L director Margaret Gaston.

will focus on acquiring reliable re
sources and funding to collect a suf
ficient data pool for further research
on improving performance.
"It could take as long as seven
years to see the effects of this initia
tive reflected in principal perform
ance rates." she said. "It is urgent
that we start as soon as possible, be
cause we have no time to lose."
Solomon Rivera, executive direc

tor of the Californians for Justice Ed
ucation Fund ((T.I), said the school
system is weakest in areas predomi
nantly inhabited by low-income fam
ilies.
"Only 12 percent of students in
Long Beach, California, are taking
classes at the college-prep level," he
said. "In schools with strong and
well-qualified staffs, those figures
are closer to 70 or HO percent. We're

experiencing a crisis characterized
by inequity."
Rivera said that while strong
principals can be important to a
school's success, they are really just
one piece in a much larger puzzle.
"There is too much failure," he
said. "We're in a crisis."
