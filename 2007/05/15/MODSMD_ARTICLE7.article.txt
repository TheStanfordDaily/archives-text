background.
"I have noticed a consistent
participation of native and her
itage speakers in classes offered
through the Spanish Depart

ment." Surwillo said in an email.
"Moreover, because the Spanish
major is so flexible, many of these
students who might plan on tak
ing a course or two end up com
pleting a major or. sometimes, a
minor."
The Spanish Department cur
rently offers three specialized
course sequences designed specif
ically for students with a Spanish

itage" speakers are very eager to
further their language capabili
ties. said Spanish and Education
Prof. Guadalupe Valdes.
"Students who enroll in |these]
classes grew up with Spanish at
home but may have taken another
foreign language in high school." she
said in an email. "At Stanford, they
are often eager to expand their ex
isting abilities in order to use the
language professionally."
In addition to enhancing the lan
guage skills of native speakers, the
department also promotes these
courses as effective ways for Ph.D.

Spanish students to learn to teach
the language.
While native speakers can enroll
in these specialized courses. Surwil
lo noted that a number of upper di
vision courses also include students
with proficiency in two or even three
languages including Spanish.

Charitini Douvaldzi, native speakers

make up between 10 and 20 pereent
of all undergraduates in the German
Department, while that number is
higher among graduate students.
As demand among native speak
ers who want to further their lan
guage proficiency has increased, for
eign language departments across
the country have instituted more
specialized programs to meet these
students' needs. If the demand con
tinues to grow. Valdes said, "her

itage" programs — such as those in
the Spanish Department — will
likely be expanded into other lan
