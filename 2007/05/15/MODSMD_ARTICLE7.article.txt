### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
Native speakers till an increas
ingly significant portion of col
lege-level language classes at
Stanford, according to members
of various foreign language de
partments.
Spanish Prof. Lisa Surwillo re
ports that nearly one-quarter of
all graduating Spanish majors
come from a Spanish-speaking
background.
"I have noticed a consistent
participation of native and her
itage speakers in classes offered
through the Spanish Depart

ment." Surwillo said in an email.
"Moreover, because the Spanish
major is so flexible, many of these
students who might plan on tak
ing a course or two end up com
pleting a major or. sometimes, a
minor."
The Spanish Department cur
rently offers three specialized
course sequences designed specif
ically for students with a Spanish
speaking background.These "her
itage" speakers are very eager to
further their language capabili
ties. said Spanish and Education
Prof. Guadalupe Valdes.
