### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With flu season come and
gone, most students think of
spring as a season free from ill
ness. But as in years past, a recent
outbreak of conjunctivitis —
more commonly known as pink
eye — has joined the caterpillars
in nature's campaign to irritate

students looking to enjoy the
warmth and sunshine.
"We have had 78 visits since
Apr. I that have resulted in the di
agnosis of conjunctivitis." s;nd
Vaden Director of Medical Ser
vices Robyn Tepper in an email.
"Last year during this time we had
74 visits for conjunctivitis."
A number of additional stu
dents have called Vaden or have
visited their Peer Health Kduca
tor (PIIli) hut have opted not to
visit the health center.
