## Spring brings pink eye infections to campus 78 cases reported by students since Apr. 1 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With flu season come and
gone, most students think of
spring as a season free from ill
ness. But as in years past, a recent
outbreak of conjunctivitis —
more commonly known as pink
eye — has joined the caterpillars
in nature's campaign to irritate

students looking to enjoy the
warmth and sunshine.
"We have had 78 visits since
Apr. I that have resulted in the di
agnosis of conjunctivitis." s;nd
Vaden Director of Medical Ser
vices Robyn Tepper in an email.
"Last year during this time we had
74 visits for conjunctivitis."
A number of additional stu
dents have called Vaden or have
visited their Peer Health Kduca
tor (PIIli) hut have opted not to
visit the health center.
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation
of the conjunctiva, a membrane
which covers the back of the eyelid
and the white of the eye. It can be
caused by bacteria, viruses, an aller
gic reaction or a reaction to chemi
cals. In its viral and bacterial forms,it
is highly contagious and is often
transmitted after infected individu
als touch their eyes. It is usually
short-lived.
In the case of a bacterial infec
tion, treatment for conjunctivitis in
cludes antibiotic eye drops. Some
doctors recommend that contact
lenses not be worn during infection,
and eye makeup should be thrown
out and replaced. Students can be
treated at Vaden, and staff with eye
care benefits through the Vision Ser
vices Plan (VSP) qualify for primary
eye care treatment of conjunctivitis
through a VSP member doctor.
Allergic, bacterial and viral con
junctivitis are all infecting students
on campus,Tepper said. Cases often
appear in clumps, originating in dif
ferent dorms at different times.

"'line PHEs are often our first
source of information when there is
a cluster of illnesses on campus,"
Tepper said. "They play a key role in
education and prevention,since they
can reach many students quickly.
They can also inform students about
home treatment and when it is time
to come to Vaden for further evalua
tion."
Mohini Rustag '07. the PHE in
Casa Zapata, said that although her
dorm recently saw a number of cases
of allergic conjunctivitis, she had not
yet seen any contagious cases.
Rustagi outlined some home care
tips for treating pink eye.
"The worst thing you can do is
rub the eye because this makes the
inflammation worse — the infection
can easily spread to your other eye."
she said in an email."The best things
you can do include washing your
hands regularly and avoiding eye
makeup."
"For severe cases," she added,
"you can use warm or cool com
presses on the closed eyelids or. de
pending on whether it is a bacterial
or viral infection, get a prescription
for eye drops."
