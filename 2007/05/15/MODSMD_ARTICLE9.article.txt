## Finding language in gesture Researchers find origins of speech in ambiguous meaning of body motions

primate relatives, two Fniory researchers
found that human language began not ver
balh hut as a system of gestures.
The fossil record falls silent when it comes
to explaining the origin of human language,
so researchers often turn to modern human
and primate behavior to fill in the blanks. All
primates can communicate with facial ex
pressions and vocalizations, but only the
youngest species-chimpanzees, bonobos,
orangutan, humans, and gorillas-can gener

expose our palms, we could be asking for
money, food or help.
lint do primates exhibit similar situation
al behaviour? Chimpanzees and bonobos ex
hibited IS different facial/vocal signals and
31 gestures over several hundred hours of
being videotaped by Amy Pollick and Frans
de Waal. While both chimps and bonobos had
the same exact facial/vocal displays in the
same situations, the use of gestures varied
wildly based on social context, both within
and between species.
For example, knowing that a chimp
screams when intimidated allows you to pre
dict that a bonobo will also scream when in
timidated. But gestures aren't so specific:
When a bonobo holds out a hand during a
fight he is asking for backup: during meal
time an open-handed bonobo is asking for
food.
The conclusion was that facial expressions
and vocalizations are hard-wired and tied to
specific emotions, while gestures are not —
they have to be first learned and then constant
ly interpreted based on the social context.
The need for gestures to be learned ties
them to culture. In the midst of their study.
Pollick and de Waal found both bonobo and
chimp groups using old gestures in original
ways. One bonobo started to clap its hands
while grooming a fellow bonobo and soon all
members of the group had taken up a groom
inn behavior never before seen in anv other

bonobo population in the world.The tenden
cy for apes to imitate each other thus leads to
cultural transmission of a "'regional dialect."
Gestures also enable a wide range of new
capacities, such as deception. For example, al

periencing completely different emotions.
Interestingly, apes use the same brain re
gions for gesture perception that humans use
for speech perception. Gesture perception in
apes and speech perception in humans are
both lateralized in the left hemisphere: il ges
turing founded modern language, it would
explain why the vast majority of both apes
and humans are right-handed.
Even though chimpanzees and bonobos
are equally related to us. bonobos prove a
better model for early human language.
Bonobos actually use the same gestures in a
wider variety of situations than chimpanzees
do. implying that bonobos have a more com
plex communication system and greater sym
bolic understanding. A conversation be
tween bonobos looks more like a dialogue
than a conversation between chimps. For ex
ample, in a fight between two males, each will
take turns when screaming at the other. Also,
like infants, bonobos will make small sounds

to call others? attention to aspects of their
environment. Finally, bonobos are more cul
turally diverse when it comes to gestures. If a
chimp in one of the captive groups used a
gesture in one particular social context, you
could generally predict that a chimp from the
second group would use the same gesture
when put in the same position. But this was
not true for bonobos.
Previous theories about the evolution of
human language were based on gradual im
provements of animal vocalizations. But now
researchers think that the brain regions re
sponsible for language first developed be
cause gestures took on contextual-not simply
intrinsic-meaning. The brain regions then
used for gestures became adapted to speech.
Gestures make an especially good candidate
for the evolutionary jumping-off point to
human language because silent gestures
would have been more useful than vocaliza
tions for essential activities like hunting prey.
So if chimpanzees and bonobos use ges
tures to communicate, does this imply that
they too have language?
"The apes are doing a lot of things, but
they are not using these gestures as symbols."
de Waal told Live Science. Gestures, Pollick
continues,are only a "stepping-stone towards
communication," since the gesture itself is not
related to its own meaning. Humans could
have hurdled the gap between gestures and
sign language by inventing gestures that di
rectly symbolized objects and ideas.
I low does the fundamental difference be
tween gestures and facial expressions come
across in spoken language today? "We have
control over speech, but nonverbal things
such as our tone of voice when we are laugh
ing or screaming-we don't have a lot of con
trol over." de Waal told Live Science. Ges
tures are still incredibly important because
they make us more likely to pay attention to
and remember what is communicated, and
they also give us another way to interpret this
information. Our proclivity for gesturing
while speaking on the phone to someone
who can't even see us emphasizes how natu
ral this behavior is.

"The apes are doing a lot of things, but
they are not using these gestures as symbols."
de Waal told Live Science. Gestures, Pollick
continues,are only a "stepping-stone towards
communication," since the gesture itself is not
related to its own meaning. Humans could
have hurdled the gap between gestures and
sign language by inventing gestures that di
rectly symbolized objects and ideas.
I low does the fundamental difference be
tween gestures and facial expressions come
across in spoken language today? "We have
control over speech, but nonverbal things
such as our tone of voice when we are laugh
ing or screaming-we don't have a lot of con
trol over." de Waal told Live Science. Ges
tures are still incredibly important because
they make us more likely to pay attention to
and remember what is communicated, and
they also give us another way to interpret this
information. Our proclivity for gesturing
while speaking on the phone to someone
who can't even see us emphasizes how natu
ral this behavior is.
