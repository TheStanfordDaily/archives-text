Since 1999 more than two thousand women have been murdered in Guatemala,
with the numbers escalating every year. Yet, lawmakers and government officials
continue to turn a blind eye. Powerful and uncompromising, Killer's Paradise un
covers one of the most emotionally-wrenching hidden human rights abuses taking
place, while exposing the impunity allowed by an inept judicial system. With its
history of almost four decades of civil war, Guatemala is a troubled society but it
can also be seen as a microcosm of the pervasive violence and injustice against
women that exists in the world today.
