# Dweck: passion and poise
## Despite early successes, Stanford students don't coast, says psych professor 
### VAUGHAN MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What the hell is wrong with Stanford students? Do we sutler
from a glut of talent? A fear of failure? An aversion to chal
lenge? Is there something in the water?
Psychology Prof. Carol Dweck has spent much of her career
doing research on talent, hard-work and failure. Her research,
among other things, speaks directly to Stanlord students and
their neuroses. Dweck s work links intimately with her own per
sonal experiences and allows her cunning insights into passion,
natural gifts and dedication.
In the sixth grade, Dweck s teacher seated the students by
their IQ scores (Dweck was seated at the head ot the class). In
tentionally or not, this teacher sent the message that certain 12-
year olds would be successful in school due to natural endow
ment while others might as well start selling crack because that
was the most they could hope for given their second-rate genet
ics.
In hindsight. Dweck realizes that this experience made her
start "thinking about students' performance [and] whether they
were oriented towards learning."
As she grew up and continued as a student,"success and fail
ure loomed large," Dweck said. She had always done well in
school and found scholastic achievement very important.
Eventually, an image of Dweck as academically intelligent
and successful inadvertently built around her, and she became
a little protective of this image. When she became a graduate
student, she wanted to examine the significance and power be
hind these ideas of success, failure and conception of self.
This interest found expression in her graduate research,
where she asked the question "how [do] students cope with
failure."

Dweck looked at grade school children to see how they
would respond to a difficult task, in which success was unlikely,
if not nearly impossible. Most children became angry or unre
sponsive. Many of the kids who thought of themselves as smart
became the most upset.Two little boys, however, became excit

ed and engaged. Dweck thought she was giving them failure;
they saw it as an opportunity to learn.
"If I have ever had role models," Dweck said.softly and sim
ply, "it was those two little boys."
These studies showed Dweck how success and talent can act
as a limitation, or a form of psychological hand-cuffs. People
who succeed early in life, often due to inborn talent, before the
pay-offs of hard work and dedication show up, have to deal with
their image of intelligence and success.
This image can lead to a fear of failure and belief that they
should succeed without blood, sweat and tears. Dweck noted
specifically with regards to Stanford students that worrying
about how smart you are keeps you from appreciating the
great people around you, their mysteries, passions and individ
ual wisdom.
Now. as a professor in the psychology department. Dweck
continues this work. But even though her work is relevant and
ground breaking (Stanford Magazine profiled her in its
March/April 20()7 issue), she projects an aura that is much too
calm for the worries about success that used to plague her. She
is a little woman, who has a softness to her that asks the inquir
er to start the conversation, but that willingly and earnestly
meets him or her halfway.
Dweck described the passions that led her to continue schol
arly pursuits, first as a student and then as a professional.
"I love research," she said."I love formulating hypotheses...
I love the data...l love writing about my research."
She also said that she found that "science can be very social."
She enjoys how scientific research lets her collaborate with stu
dents, post-docs and colleagues.
Dweck also has a very specific, very strong message for Stan
ford students, who may be said to have suffered from a glut of
talent and early success:
"Every one was at the top of their high school, probably feel
ing smart. Many Stanford students don't feel smart anymore,"
she said. "1 want them to know that [this] experience is widely
shared. Almost nobody coasts by and does welL.Everyone puts
in a lot more effort than you think or than they show...The im
portant thing in your time here is to find something you love
and work at it as hard as you can."
