## Televangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 
### SUE LINDSEY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) — The Rev.
Jerry Falwell collapsed at his campus of
fice and died Tuesday after a career in
which the evangelist used the power of
television to transform the religious
right into a mighty force in American
politics. He was 73.
Hie founder of the Moral Majority
was discovered without a pulse at Lib
erty University and pronounced dead
at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl
Moore. Falwell's physician, said he had
a heart condition and presumably died
of a heart rhythm abnormality.
Driven into politics by the 1973
Supreme Court ruling that established
the right to an abortion, Falwell founded
the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the
conservative lobbying group's greatest
triumphs came just a year later, when
Ronald Reagan was elected president.
Falwell credited the Moral Majority
with getting millions of conservative
voters registered, aiding in Reagan's
victory and giving Republicans control
of the Senate.
"I shudder to think where the coun

try would be right now if the religious
right had not evolved," he said when he
stepped down as Moral Majority presi
dent in 1987.
Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robert
son. himself a one-time GOP candidate
for president, declared Falwell "a tower
of strength on many of the moral issues
which have confronted our nation."
The rise of Christian conservatism
— and the Moral Majority's full-throat
ed condemnation of homosexuality,
abortion and pornography — made
Falwell perhaps the most recognizable
figure on the evangelical right, and one
of the most controversial ones, too.
Over the years, Falwell waged a land
mark libel case against Hustler maga
zine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy
parody ad. and created a furor in 1999
when one of his publications suggested
that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies"
character Tinky Winky was gay.
Matt Foreman, executive director of
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force,
extended condolences to those close to
Falwell. but added: "Unfortunately, we
will always remember him as a founder
and leader of America's anti-gay indus
try. someone who exacerbated the na

tion's appalling response to the on
slaught of the AIDS epidemic, someone
who demonized and vilified us for polit
ical gain and someone w ho used religion
to divide rather than unite our nation."
In a statement, President Bush said he
and First Lady Laura Bush were "deeply
saddened" by the loss of a man who
"cherished faith, family and freedom."
"One of his lasting contributions was
the establishment of Liberty Universi
ty, where he taught young people to re
main true to their convictions and rely
upon God's word throughout each
stage of their lives," Bush said.
As a student, Falwell was a star ath
lete and a prankster who was barred
from giving his high school valedictori
an's speech after he was caught using
counterfeit lunch tickets.
He ran with a gang of juvenile delin
quents before becoming a born-again
Christian at 19. Me turned down an offer
to play professional baseball and trans
ferred from Lynchburg College to Bap
tist Bible College in Springfield. Mo.
"My heart was burning to serve
Christ." he once said in an interview. "I
knew nothing would ever be the same
again."
