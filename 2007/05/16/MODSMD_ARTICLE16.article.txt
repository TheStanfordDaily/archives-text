## Lawyers brandish terrorist label Federal prosecutors compare envtl. arsonists to KKK By JEFF BARNARD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
### 
EUGENE. Ore.—Defense attorneys expressed
outrage Tuesday when federal prosecutors com
pared Earth Liberation Front arsonists who were
trying to stop old growth logging and the slaughter
of wild horses to Ku Klux Klansmen who burned
black churches in the South.
"I cannot sit idly by and hear what these defen
dants did compared to acts of the Ku Klux Klan
burning empty churches," when the KKK also
burned a church where four young black girls died,
and was involved in lynchings and murders,defense
attorney Amanda Lee said in U.S. District Court.
The exchange came in a hearing where federal
prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken to
declare the string of 20 arsons in five Western states
by a cell of the Earth Liberation Front and Animal
Liberation Front to be terrorist acts, qualifying the
defendants for longer sentences under federal
guidelines.
The six men and four women have pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and arson in connection with
fires set from 1996 through 2001 that did $40 million
in damage to a Vail, Colo., ski resort, national forest
ranger stations, meat packing plants, research labo
ratories, lumber company offices,a tree farm and an
SUV dealership.
Aiken said because each of the defendant's
crimes and circumstances is different, she was un
likely to rule before next TUesday. when the first of
the defendants. Stanislas G. Meyerhoff, is to be sen
tenced.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Peifer argued
that the fires _ those at private businesses as well as
government facilities—qualified as terrorism under
the law. because they were intended to coerce the
government to change its policies on logging,selling
wild horses for slaughter, and genetic engineering.
" Ibis is a classic case of terrorism, despite their
protests of lofty humane goals," Peifer said. "It was
pure luck no one was killed or injured by their ac
tions."
Defense attorneys replied that the fires do not

qualify as terrorism because the defendants took
great care to be sure no one was killed or injured.
"If that is the standard, then the Ku Klux Klan
did not commit terrorism," when they burned
empty black churches during the civil rights up
heaval in the South in the 19605, Peifer said.
Defense lawyers noted that never before has any
of the 1,200 fires attributed to the two radical
groups nationwide qualified a defendant for extra
time in prison because it was considered a terrorist
act.
The sentencing recommendations the prosecu
tion offered as part of the plea agreements already
consider the terrorism enhancement, prompting
defense attorneys to argue it is more about fulfilling
U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' descrip
tion of the defendants as domestic terrorists than
applying the law.
" Ibis is a political case," defense attorney Marc
Friedman said.
Lee said the informant who cracked the case,cell
member Jacob Ferguson, was involved in more ar
sons that any of the defendants, and it was "unbe
lievable" that he could be allowed to remain free
while any of the defendants was imprisoned as a ter
rorist.
"I pray my government is not making deals with
real terrorists like it made with Jacob Ferguson,"
she said.
Peifer denied he or Assistant U.S. Attorney Kirk
Engdahl had been in contact with the U.S. Justice
Department in Washington, D.C., over applying a
terrorism factor to sentencing.
" ITiis is not a political prosecution," he said, but
acknowledged the prosecution's sentencing recom
mendations are unlikely to change if the terrorism
enhancement is granted, because defendants get re
duced time based on their cooperation with investi
gators.
Defense lawyer Bill Sharp said a history of legis
lation creating the terrorism enhancement clearly
shows Congress meant it to be applied to cases
where people were killed, such as the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing.
Peifer discounted defense arguments that apply
ing the terrorism enhancement would send defen
dants to a maximum security prison where they
would have severely restricted contact with friends
and family, decreasing their chances of working
their way back into society when they were re
leased.
I le cited cases of others to whom the terrorism
enhancement was applied serving their time in
medium security prisons.
Operation Backfire is the biggest prosecution
ever of environmental extremists, and has turned
on its head the prevailing idea that arsonists have
generally acted alone, said Brent Smith, director of
the Terrorism Research Center at the University of

Arkansas.
Three other defendants remain fugitives and
two are awaiting sentencing in Seattle.
