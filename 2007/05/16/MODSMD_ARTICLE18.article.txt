## Editorial Board Treat misdemeanor disclosure with care 
### 
The University's adoption of the Com
mon Application for the Class of
2012 brings with it a provision that
requires applicants to report and explain
misdemeanors. While the Office of Under
graduate Admissions has a legitimate inter
est in knowing the criminal histories of stu
dents who want to matriculate here, admis
sions officers should not let minor misde
meanors have too strong an impact on their
decisions.
In practice, the requirement to report
misdemeanors does little tochange the Uni
versity's admissions policy. Stanford's own
application has long included a question
about whether a student has "had a criminal
charge sustained against [him] in a juvenile
proceeding"—effectively mandating dis
closure of misdemeanors. This language was
expanded for the newly admitted Class of
2011 to include broader "violations of an
Honor Code."
Nonetheless, the codification of the re
quirement to divulge misdemeanors could
entice admissions officers to disqualify an
otherwise outstanding candidate for admis
sion on the sole basis of a petty infraction. In
the extreme case, the Admissions Office
could adopt a de facto policy by which a mis
demeanor constitutes automatic grounds for
rejection. As admissions officers surely have
the good sense to know, such an overly sim
plistic guiding principle would be a mistake.
There are a host of reasons why a misde
meanor should not necessarily preclude
consideration of a qualified applicant.
While many misdemeanors — such as most
driving under the influence charges — truly
reflect poorly on one's character and judg
ment. others are decidedly less egregious.
What is more, classifications of niisde

meanors vary by state,creating a situation in
which students from different states are
held to different standards. Some students
who have been convicted of misdemeanors
have since gotten their act together and. in
deed. might be even be better off for it. Lim
barrassing but minor brushes with the law
are often channeled toward positive ends
and can lead the perpetrator to work for
positive change in the community. Finally,
an intransigent bias against minor misde
meanors in admissions decisions, if well
known. would create an incentive for appli
cants to lie.
Each of these potentially mitigating fac
tors merits consideration when contemplat
ing the appropriate role of a misdemeanor
in an admissions decision. Stanford has a
right and a responsibility to consider the
moral character of its admitted students and
to assess their likelihood of upholding the
University's Fundamental Standard. But
admissions officers ought to approach less
er misdemeanors with open minds, and a bit
of charity. In this context, the written expla
nation for misdemeanors or other viola
tions required by the Common Application
becomes all the more important.
There is no indication that the Admis
sions Office would consider a blanket poli
cy to preclude strong applicants whose legal
records contain minor blemishes. Yet in an
office that only admits one in ten students,
the potential exists for expedient disqualifi
cation of applicants who have been convict
ed of misdemeanors but are otherwise on
par with those who warrant a spot at the
school. I"he Admissions Office should exer
cise caution to prevent minor brushes with
the law from disproportionately influencing
its decisions.
