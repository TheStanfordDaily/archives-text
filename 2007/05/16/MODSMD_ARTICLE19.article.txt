# Heil Harry Potter
## 
### 
Every moment, a treacherous peril
threatens to destroy the civilization
that we all — well, it not love, then at
least have gotten used to. No. I 'm not talking
about Putin's nuclear antics or the hotbed of
brutality roiling in the Middle East. I'm talk
ing about Harry Potter. More specifically,
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the
last book in the septology.due to be released
in a little over a month.
And while rumors and potential spoilers
have been flying around for months. I am
here to give you the final solution to the se
ries. Harry Potter is evil.
Not the series, of course. Frankly, any
novel that can pack a bookstore to capacity
at midnight and encourage kids to trade
their TiVo remotes for actual literature —
in summer, no less! — deserves all the acco
lades we can heap on it. I'm talking about
the actual character 1 larry Potter within the
diegetic Hogwartsian world.
In case you're not up to date with I log
warts mythology, here's the sitch: The
supreme evil overlord Voldemort has come
back to life, rousing a ragtag team of homici
dal Death-Raters to enact his despicable
scheme. 1 larry has taken part in no less than
two secret organizations expressly designed
to stop Voldemort by force, if necessary.
(Hint: It will almost definitely be necessary.)
And above all we know that either or possi
bly both Voldemort and his bespectacled
teenage counterpoint will be slain by the
end of the epic battle.
'ITie inevitable last showdown is a clear
cut battle between good and evil, and every
one wants to know which side will reign
supreme. Ever since the end of book six. Pot
ter-philes have been promoting theories
that make speculation on the Kennedy as
sassination look like simple arithmetic.
Might Harry and Voldemort merge into a
zen-likc form of perfect good and perfect
evil? Will they both be killed? Neither?!
The one thing none of us have bothered
to call into question is whether we really
even have a handle on what good and evil
mean.
Enter my theory. For the past six novels,
readers have developed an eerie sympathy
with the lovably disheveled title character.
We've groaned at his failures, cheered at his
narrow escapes — we've even gone through
puberty with him. And because we have
closely followed his suffering (which is only
a slightly more whimsical rendition of our
own academic and romantic woes), we as
sume that he. like us. is good.
But while this makes solid emotional
sense, does it really stand up to factual
scrutiny?
Throughout the series, the ostensible vil
lain. Voldemort. is maligned by a small
handful of I logwartsstudents and their fam
ilies — but where is our objective establish
ing shot? Harry, at the intellectual behest of
kindly old authoritarian Dumbledore.
blindly trusts the biased information tossed

at him by a few sources. Then, riding the
tides of charisma and personal mythology,
he trains a group of slavishly devoted fol
lowers in the arts of war.
Charismatic leader, desire to overthrow
the current regime, the occasional rhetori
cally overburdened speech — Rowling
might as well have called I logwarts students
the Blackcapes.
Imagine the pandemonium if Rowling
were to reveal in the final book that the
characters we have rooted for all along are
not what we have imagined them to be, but
agents fighting for a side that is less clearly
"good" than we have been led to believe.
Okay, I'll admit this is probably not how
the seventh book is going to end, and the
kind people over at Mugglenet are probably
sharpening their wands as we speak, but at
the very least, the idea is evocative. Readers
feel confident in their ability to locate objec
tive characteristics of good and evil in a fic
tional world that has no spectrum or nuance.
In reality, good and evil are nebulous
concepts and we would never pigeonhole a
human as being one or the other as eonfi
dently as we can in literature. In this time
building up to the last novel. Rowling has.
perhaps unintentionally, left her millions of
fans in a dangerous moral position: We arc
all piqued for violence, slavering for the
gory dissemination of a (fictional) human
life, and completely confident that we can
determine whether or not this death is an
ethical one. We may allow ourselves to be
come convinced that our shallow under
standing of the mythical concepts of good
and evil is sufficient to make this terrible
judgment.
Granted, this is not literally a life or death
situation, but until I'm proven wrong. I will
continue to hope that Rowling will pull the
rug out from under our collective feet and
show us that we may not be as prepared to
judge others as we like to imagine. To the
readers who are emotionally involved in this
series, the final novel is a chance to teach an
unforgettable lesson about the ambiguity of
morality, the banality of evil.
J.K. Rowling, creator of The Boy Who
Lived has a chance to become The Woman
Who Blew All Of Our Minds. And I. for
one. hope she does it.
Kat is not really a die-hard llarrv /'otter fun,
contrary to appearances, hut if there were a
Ravendawsorority on campus, she'd definite
ly rush it. Send your own Hook Seven theories
