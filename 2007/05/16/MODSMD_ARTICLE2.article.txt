Do you remember what you ate for breakfast on
Monday? Taking you some time to dredge it up? Last
night in Jordan Hall. UC-lrvine Prof. Elizabeth Lof
tus spoke about the unreliability and vulnerability of
memory during a Symbolic Systems Department

sponsored presentation on false memories.
"False memory" is the term researchers use to de
fine an imaginary situation or experience from an in
dividual's past that a person remembers having oc
curred. In many cases, false memories are embedded
in a subject's mind through suggestion or persuasion,
a phenomenon known as "repressed memory recov
ery" that often occurs during psychotherapy.
According to Loftus. the human mind's vulnera
bility to false memory impression is far greater than
often believed.
