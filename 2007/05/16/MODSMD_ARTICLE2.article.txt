## Unearthing false memories Prof. Loftus explores the roots and repercussions of memory failures 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
Do you remember what you ate for breakfast on
Monday? Taking you some time to dredge it up? Last
night in Jordan Hall. UC-lrvine Prof. Elizabeth Lof
tus spoke about the unreliability and vulnerability of
memory during a Symbolic Systems Department

sponsored presentation on false memories.
"False memory" is the term researchers use to de
fine an imaginary situation or experience from an in
dividual's past that a person remembers having oc
curred. In many cases, false memories are embedded
in a subject's mind through suggestion or persuasion,
a phenomenon known as "repressed memory recov
ery" that often occurs during psychotherapy.
According to Loftus. the human mind's vulnera
bility to false memory impression is far greater than
often believed.

UC-lrvine Prof. Elizabeth Loftus unveils her latest research findings on false memories in Jordan Hall at a
speaker event sponsored by the symbolic systems department. Students expressed mixed opinions on the
event.
"Exposing people to misinformation
about incidences that they perhaps did ex
perience can [significantly change] the de
tails," she said.
Loftus cited examples of researchers
using suggestive methods to imprint sub
jects with memories ranging from getting
lost in a mall as a child to being physically
molested by Pluto the dog at Disneyland.
The procedure is often successful — 20
to 40 percent of participants in the "lost-in
the mall" scenario recalled an event that
never actually occurred.
Such false memories often have tragic
consequences — "eyewitness error" is a
leading cause of imprisonment of wrongful
ly-accused criminals, Loftus said. She also
linked false memories to women who go
through psychoanalysis that makes them be
lieve that they have repressed memories of
being sexually molested by family members.
"There's no real scientific evidence,"

Loftus said, "that we can take years of bru
talization and bury them in the subcon
scious."
Despite their setbacks, however, Loftus
expressed measured optimism about false
memories. She cited one experiment in
which participants were duped into thinking
they had memories of disliking strawberry
ice cream as children.These findings, Loftus
said, could lead to new weight-loss pro
grams to combat rising obesity.
Doug Morrison '09 said the presentation
made him rethink his views on eyewitness
testimony.
"1 thought it was really good stuff." he
said. "It convinced me that you can't trust
eyewitnesses as much as our legal system
currently does."
Ryan Mead '07 said he enjoyed the pres
entation but thought the research echoed
much of what he had heard before.
"[Loftus' findings] seemed pretty credi
ble," said Mead." 1 've taken classes that pre
sented similar findings and so it wasn't real
ly news to me."
