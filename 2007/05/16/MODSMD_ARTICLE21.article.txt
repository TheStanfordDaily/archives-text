# In defense of Stanford Duck Syndrome
## 
### 
They say Stanford is a school of ducks:
calm on the top. busy on the bottom.
We calmly avoid discussing the amount
of work we have to do. maintaining a calm de
meanor in the face of a daunting array of
problem sets, projects and extracurriculars.
liut under the surface, we're feverishly pad
dling our webbed appendages, struggling to
stay afloat.
F"his image is everywhere. According to
The Stanford Daily, a psychologist came in
the other day to kresge Auditorium to speak
about stress management. Her talk chiefly
concerned the impact of the "Stanford Duck
Syndrome" on our student body.
SI )S appears on the website Princeton Re
view. in the "Students Say" section. It finds
mention inThe Unofficial Guide to Stanford
University and The Insider's Guide to Col
leges.The phrase gets l ) 7 independent hits on
Google, and it has even made its way into
I Jrban Dictionary.
The general perception of this phenome
non is negative: IK denying our problems, we
exacerbate them. Through not mentioning
the work we've got to do. we arrogantly imply
that we can get by without assistance. And
through refusing to acknowledge our fever

ish paddling, we end up paddling our way
into oblivion.
But before we delve into the psychologi
cal consequences of this pressing issue. I have
but one question:
Where the hell are all the ducks?
II I held out a handful of breadcrumbs at
the average student gathering,a mere minor
ity of students would waddle over to get
them. I rarely see the remnants of our pellet
like feces on the steps of Meyer Library. No.
we're animals of a different breed here, and
our food of choice is nectar. Our wings beat
at SO flaps a second, and we're quick to point
this out by hovering in place.
We are a school of hummingbirds, flap
ping our wings at max speed for the benefit of

anyone who happens to pass us by. The other
birds look on as we hum away, nervously and
anxiously sipping our sugar water in several
second bouts.
I can't tell you how many times my din
nertime conversations have revolved exclu
sively around work. I hear the hum of wings
as we exasperatedly interject the number of
essays, problem sets and pages of reading
we've got to do before a certain deadline. 1
see in talk of extracurriculars the anxious
movements of a creature whose heart beats
1.260 times a minute.
Sure, there are a number of people who do
tit the duck phenotype. I don't know what
they do or how they get things done, because
they're always talking about other things. Hut
to some degree, the Stanford I lummingbird
Syndrome affects us all.
It is tor this reason that I say simply, bring
on the ducks. I honestly don't care how many
essays you've got to do. how many problem
sets you have or which class you're taking is
the hardest. Sure, we should talk about it at
some point â€” I mean, after all, we are in
school, lint the incessant humming has got to
