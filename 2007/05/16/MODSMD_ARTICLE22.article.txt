# Nature? Where do I press play?

### 
I do not consider myself to have an addic
tive personality. That being said. I will
fully admit I have a new. unrelenting ad
diction: Watching a BBC nature series called
"Planet Earth." If you haven't already seen
this show. I am confident it will change your
life. As episodes examine various ecosystems
around the world, you will witness scenes so
incredible you will wonder how they cannot
be fake. A great white shark the si/e of a
truck leaps out of the water to catch a seal. A
rare bird does a courtship dance more amaz
ing than any dance move you've seen on
MTV.The narrator.Sir David Attenborough.
says the words "wild ass" in a serious. British
accent. It's all hard to believe.
Luckily I am not alone in my new addic
tion. The buzz about this show has spread
across campus faster than pink eye,and it has
turned just about everyone into nature
lovers. As for myself. I would like to think 1
have always been a nature lover. I fell. I back
pack through secluded forests. I camp on re
mote beaches. I bury my own crap in the
woods and then carry my used toilet paper

for days.
Like most nature buffs. I do this because
I've always believed one must travel hours
from civilization to witness anything remote
ly close to the awesomeness filmed in "Plan
et Earth." Yet as I watched the final episode
for the second time I realized that I was being
ignorant.There 1 was.captivated by a life-like
nature DVD in my dimly-lit dorm room,
when there was an abundant assortment of
real-life nature right outside my door.
In case you're wondering. I'm not going to
give you a sermon about humans' impact 011
the environment. I'll leave that to the experts

(a. k. a. earth systems majors). 1 simply believe
it is ironic that it takes an extremely high
quality film lor many of us to appreciate the
natural world. Imagine a time-lapse shot of a
million caterpillars descending from trees
and transforming into moths, if this were a
scene in Planet Earth, myself and others
would likely be blown away. Yet, as this was
happening across campus, 1 rarely stopped to
appreciate the phenomenon.
You can brush me off as a hippie, but I
promise you that I shower at least five times
a week and I only get naked for special occa
sions (like birthdays, vacations and lliurs
days). I simply want to remind readers that at
Stanford we are surrounded by gorgeous ex
amples of life. I know that most of you are too
busy to plan a day hike or travel to a nation
al park. Instead, I recommend just pausing
the next time you run the Dish at sunset. You
know that intense hill about halfway through
where you really want to stop anyway? Go
ahead, take a break and look around. It truly
