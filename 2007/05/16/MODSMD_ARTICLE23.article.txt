## Students find ways around gambling laws Playing continues despite more federal enforcement 
### KRISTI TOUSIGNANT THE MARYLAND DIAMONDBACK 
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK. Md. â€” De
spite legislation passed in Congress last fall ban
ning credit card, check and electronic fund
transfers to gambling sites,student gamers show
no sign of folding. Instead, they are finding ways
around the new legislation through under
ground sites and alternative payment methods.
Freshman business major Mark loli got his
start on the professional Magic Card circuit at
age 16. He used his $b.(K)() winnings from the
collectible fantasy card game to jump-start his
poker career and now makes an average of
$2().()()() a semester gambling online.
"It's fun because it's a rush," loli said. "I
never know what's going to happen. 1 like that.
It's a high."
While he sinks most of the cash into the
stock market, loli splurges the rest of the
money on expensive alcohol, vacations and
treating his friends to dinner. This summer he
plans to set up his operation in an office in his
house with four computer screens and friends
to help out at $10 an hour.
"1 like waking up every day not knowing if
I'm going to be worth more or less money," loli
said.
Online gambling continues in part because
enforcement has not officially been put in
place. It is expected that official rules will be
enacted later this year resulting in stricter en
forcement of the laws.
Still, when legislation first passed banning
money transfers to gambling sites, avid gam
blers like loli were shocked and have scram
bled to find ways of coping. Freshman Joel Bid
nick was afraid for his gambling future because

he uses his winnings to substitute what would
otherwise be income from a part-time job.
"1 was terrified initially," Bidnick said. "If
they were going to do away with online gam
bling completely, it would cost me a lot of
money."
Students quickly pooled their knowledge to
find ways around the new rules, switching from
major sites like PartyFoker.com, which now
blocks all U.S. players, to sites like Bodog.com,
Pokerstars.com and Fulltiltpoker.com. Instead
of directly transferring money from bank ac
counts to the gambling sites, students are
forced to use other payment methods, includ
ing Western Union, C VS cards. Visa check
cards. FedEx checks or even phone deposit
cards in place of credit.
According to Bidnick, Poker Stars.com will
even send you a debit card to use on their site. In
desperate circumstances, the website also offers
a one-time-use-only scheme in which gamers
adopt the name of a Puerto Rican counterpart
to whom they then send the necessary money.
"It's sketchy, but it was the only way for a
while." Bidnick said. According to Michael Os
borne. executive director of the Compulsive
Gambling Center in Baltimore, credit card
companies are even making transactions look
legitimate by recording them with generic titles
on credit card bills.
That way it is impossible to tell if the card
was used at an online gambling site. The new
methods, however, slow down the process,
sometimes taking as long as a month and a half
for students to cash out. where before the max
imum was five days.
Osborne, who has expressed alarm at the
growing number of young people addicted to
gambl ing online, reporls no decrease in the num
ber ofcollege-age students seeking treatment. If
anything.he says,there has been an increase.
"The online gambling ban is nothing but a
farce," Osborne said. However, the River City
Group, a key organizer of marketplaces for
business-to-business services in l-gaming, in
sists the number of players and sites have de
clined after the law was passed. Director of
Publishing at the River City Group Mark
Balestra said.
"The main change is that larger companies
have stopped targeting U.S. players."
According to Sue Schneider, the President and
CEO of the River City Group, the projected
revenue for 2007 went down by $4.4 billion
after the legislation was passed. Without regu
lations in place at this point, students show no
sign of quitting any time soon.

"1 don't think I'll ever stop playing poker,"
loli said. "I'll play until I can't see. After school
I plan to play poker, get a job on the stock mar
ket for live years, then retire and take my wife
and travel the world."
