# Grand jury takes testimony
## DeAnza rape allegations prompt secret hearing 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN JOSE — A criminal grand jury ques
tioned its first witnesses Tuesday in the case of
an alleged rape of a 17-year-old girl by De Anza
College baseball players at a party in March.
Two baseball players — sophomores Chris
Skinner and Spencer Maltbie — were seen
waiting outside the grand jury's courtroom ac
companied by their parents and defense
lawyers, the San Jose Mercury News reported
on its Web site.
Maltbie was there with his father, network
television golf commentator Roger Maltbie.
All of the parties declined to comment, with
prosecutors and sheriff's investigators declin
ing to confirm the existence of a grand jury in
vestigation.
Authorities began investigating athletes and
other students at the Cupertino community
college, located about 40 miles south of San
Francisco, after a birthday party for one of the
players where the alleged attack occurred.
The party was held at the home of De Anza
infielder and sophomore Steve Rebagliati, 20,
in the Burbank District, an unincorporated
part of San Jose.
Flight ball players were suspended from the
team after the alleged rape was reported.
Sheriff's investigators took DNA samples
from an unspecified number of partygoers, in
cluding some players. Separately, the sheriff's
department has said it is looking into a second
woman's claims that she was raped in the same
house during a party in December.
No one has been charged in either case.
