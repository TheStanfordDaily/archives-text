## Broncos beat Stanford trounces Santa Clara, 14-4 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball patiently let Santa
Clara pitchers walk themselves into
trouble in last night's third inning, and
with two swings of the bat. the Cardinal
took advantage.
Junior right fielder Michael Taylor
broke a 3-3 tie with a two-run home run
well over the left-field fence and junior
catcher Brian Juhl added a pair of insur
ance runs on his bases-loaded double in
a decisive, five-run third. Aided by five
walks :tnd two hit batsmen, Stanford
matched its highest run total of the year
in the 14-4 blowout.
The Cardinal (22-27.6-15 Pacific-10
Conference) avoided a season sweep by
the Broncos with the win and exacted a
measure of revenge after being
outscored 35-16 through the first three
games of the series, l iven after the loss,
Santa Clara (25-29, 9-12 West Coast
Conference) won the season series for
the second time in three years, 3-1.
"[The win isj extremely important,"
junior right hander David Stringer told
KZSU after the game. "This season has
been pretty frustr ing. We just haven't
been able to put i .ings together. [Fin
ishing strong] is essential for us so we
can take some momentum into next
year."
Stringer (1-2) pitched a career-high
seven innings for his lirst win of the sea
son. scattering seven hits and allowing
only one unearned run. Formerly the
Stanford closer, the Palo Alto-native
entered in relief of struggling junior
starter Nolan Gallagher in the second
inning.
"I just try to take the same mindset
into every time 1 pitch."' Stringer said to
KZSU."When I'm not closing, m\ job is
to just keep the score where its and
keep my team in the game. Obviously,
on a night like tonight when we put up
early runs, it's a lot easier for me to set
tle down."
Bronco starter Sean O'Neill (2-3),
who had defeated Stanford twice this
year already, took the loss in his shortest
start against the Cardinal this year (2.1
IP). In a game that seesawed back and
forth early on, O'Neill was knocked out
of the game by Taylor's third-inning
home run and the Santa Clara pitching

G/ ME NOTES The Cardinal rolls into its se
ries with Pacific riding a three-game win
streak, due, largely, to a suddenly hot of
fense. Over the past three games, Stan
ford has scored 32 runs, after scoring just
1 3 in the three games prior to the out
burst. Senior third baseman Ryan Seawell
has scored six runs and knocked in six RBI
on six hits over the span. Cardinal hitters
will have a good chance of prolonging
that success against the Tigers, as Pacific
pitching has racked up a team ERA of
6.31 this season.

Reliever Justin Kuehn induced jun
ior second baseman Adam Sorgi to
groundout for the second out of the in
ning, but then struggled to find the
strike zone,especially early in the count.
Kuehn walked three straight Stanford
batters and threw a wild pitch to load
the bases before he gave up the two-run
single to Juhl (2-5. 3 RBI). Daniel De-
Marco was equally wild, hitting the first
batter he faced to load the bases and
then walking sophomore left fielder
Joey August to force home an inherited
base runner.
Through the first two innings, both
teams passed momentum back-and
forth with each plate appearance. Stan
ford opened the game with a manufac
tured run in the top of the first. After
