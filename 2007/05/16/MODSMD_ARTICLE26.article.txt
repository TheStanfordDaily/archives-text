# Joseph Bramlett Men's Golf
## This is why I'm hot 
### BY ROXIE DICKINSON 
In just his first season playing golf for the Cardi
nal, Joseph Bramlett has gotten off to an excep
tionally quick start. After notching an individ
ual victory in the Puerto Rico Classic on Feb.
27. the freshman putted his way into the Pacif
ic- 10 All-Conference Team. And at the same time.
Bramlett is making history, ranking seventh for Stan
ford's season-low stroke average record (71.5) as he
heads into the NCAA West Regional this Thursday.
Adding to his already impressive list of accom
plishments, the true-freshman earned six top-10 indi
vidual finishes, largely contributing to Stanford's 11
top-five finishes on the season. Just this week. Bram
lett recorded the low score of the day. a 66, at the US
Open local qualifier held at Half Moon Bay.
With all those accomplishments, one would think
they've gotten to Branilett's head, but according to
the Saratoga, Calif.-native, it's actually gotten to his
iPod.
"When I won in Puerto Rico. I listened to' This is
Why I'm Hot'," Bramlett said."! haven't listened to
it since, but I listened to it today and I did great. I
think I'm going to start listening to that song before
NC'A As. It just keeps me up."
Branilett's first sport was golf and it stuck. I lis fa
ther. Mario, had been developing a love for golf when
his son was born, and was soon taking him to practice.
"[My dad] gave me a plastic golf club to play with
at first,' Bramlett said. "We used to go out to the soc
cer field when I was two to hit shots with him. We al
ways played golf together."
Though he went on to play basketball in middle
school. Bramlett felt the accomplishment he found in
golf would always draw him back to his first sport.
"Basketball wasn't quite the same as golf." he
said. "Basketball is a team sport, but with golf, it was
all up to me how good I wanted to be."
Bramlett credits his parents for their involvement
and support throughout his life. ITiey emphasized
building a solid academic foundation when he was
voung so that he could always fall back on his aca-

demic degree if golf didn't work out.
"My mom used to drive me to all
of my tournaments, and my dad got
me started." Bramlett said. "I could
always go to my dad for advice — he
guided me along. A lot of kids dream
about playing professional sports
when they were little, but my dream
never faded away. My parents really
helped me with that."
Bramlett's mind has been on golf
ever since, and when asked about his
favorite Stanford memory, the first
thing that came up was the Cardi
nal's victory at the University of
I lawaii-llilo Invitational.The event
marked a major milestone for the
freshman, who finished fourth indi
vidually.
"Oh. man." Bramlett said."l was
so hyped, so excited! W hen we won
in I lawaii. we were a couple behind
Oklahoma State going into the final
round. It ended up that we tied, but
we had a lower fifth score and we
took the tournament. The media
loves those guys and it was really
nice to beat them on the final day."
Bramlett's first individual win in
Puerto Rico was a somewhat differ
ent story. Despite Bramlett's indi
vidual heroics. Stanford was unable

to seize the team victory from Geor
gia. which won the tournament by
just one stroke.
"It was up and down," he said."lt
was exciting at the time because I
birdied the last hole and 1 made a big
comeback on the guys that I was
playing with, but I finished early and
I only knew that we had lost by one
as a team in the end. It was disap
pointing that we lost, my individual
(title] aside. Looking back on it.it
was cool that I won. but disappoint
ing because 1 really wanted to get
those guys [Oklahoma State], since
the only time we get to meet them is
during nationals."
Still. Bramlett is quickly develop
ing as a leader for the Cardinal, and
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray
had nothing but praise for Bram
lett's performance, expecting big
things out of him in the future.
"Joe just came off of a wonderful
day at the LIS Open qualifying tour
nament." Ray said, "lie has been a
solid contributor for us all year. Hie
great thing about Joe is that he is
very consistent and smart on the golf
course — he plays like he is a senior.
All of his characteristics on the
course add up to the great player
that he is. I look forward to seeing
how he fares at the NCAAs."
After entering the program hear
ing that Stanford had failed to win a
tournament for the past several
years. Bramlett was encouraged by

his team's early results. Hie Cardinal
came out of the gate strong, though,
winning the Gopher Invitational on
Sept. 17 to start the year.
"We've had a really good sea
son." he said. "Stanford hadn't won a
tournament in a while, and it was
nice to start the season ott with a
win. Our first win seemed to carry us
through the season. I knew we'd
have a good team coming in at the
beginning of the year, but it's hard to
expect to play this well."
Bramlett will face his first NCAA
Regional tournament this week
against the top teams in the country.
When the pressure of such a large
and crucial tournament was men
tioned. Bramlett laughed, showing
his enthusiasm.
"My favorite part of golf is the
competition and the pressure that
happens at the tournaments." he
said. "I love the pressure — that's
why we practice. If you're not com
peting for something, then the game
becomes meaningless.
"The best feeling is when some
thing is on the line." Bramlett con
tinued. "Basically, when I practice,
the competition is all I try to envi
sion. We play because we want to
win. We have to make those tough
shots sometimes, and when you are
able to. it's just amazing."

27. the freshman putted his way into the Pacif
ic- 10 All-Conference Team. And at the same time.
Bramlett is making history, ranking seventh for Stan
ford's season-low stroke average record (71.5) as he
heads into the NCAA West Regional this Thursday.
Adding to his already impressive list of accom
plishments, the true-freshman earned six top-10 indi
vidual finishes, largely contributing to Stanford's 11
top-five finishes on the season. Just this week. Bram
lett recorded the low score of the day. a 66, at the US
Open local qualifier held at Half Moon Bay.
With all those accomplishments, one would think
they've gotten to Branilett's head, but according to
the Saratoga, Calif.-native, it's actually gotten to his
iPod.
"When I won in Puerto Rico. I listened to' This is
Why I'm Hot'," Bramlett said."! haven't listened to
it since, but I listened to it today and I did great. I
think I'm going to start listening to that song before
NC'A As. It just keeps me up."
Branilett's first sport was golf and it stuck. I lis fa
ther. Mario, had been developing a love for golf when
his son was born, and was soon taking him to practice.
"[My dad] gave me a plastic golf club to play with
at first,' Bramlett said. "We used to go out to the soc
cer field when I was two to hit shots with him. We al
ways played golf together."
Though he went on to play basketball in middle
school. Bramlett felt the accomplishment he found in
golf would always draw him back to his first sport.
"Basketball wasn't quite the same as golf." he
said. "Basketball is a team sport, but with golf, it was
all up to me how good I wanted to be."
Bramlett credits his parents for their involvement
and support throughout his life. ITiey emphasized
building a solid academic foundation when he was
voung so that he could always fall back on his aca-

demic degree if golf didn't work out.
"My mom used to drive me to all
of my tournaments, and my dad got
me started." Bramlett said. "I could
always go to my dad for advice — he
guided me along. A lot of kids dream
about playing professional sports
when they were little, but my dream
never faded away. My parents really
helped me with that."
Bramlett's mind has been on golf
ever since, and when asked about his
favorite Stanford memory, the first
thing that came up was the Cardi
nal's victory at the University of
I lawaii-llilo Invitational.The event
marked a major milestone for the
freshman, who finished fourth indi
vidually.
"Oh. man." Bramlett said."l was
so hyped, so excited! W hen we won
in I lawaii. we were a couple behind
Oklahoma State going into the final
round. It ended up that we tied, but
we had a lower fifth score and we
took the tournament. The media
loves those guys and it was really
nice to beat them on the final day."
Bramlett's first individual win in
Puerto Rico was a somewhat differ
ent story. Despite Bramlett's indi
vidual heroics. Stanford was unable

to seize the team victory from Geor
gia. which won the tournament by
just one stroke.
"It was up and down," he said."lt
was exciting at the time because I
birdied the last hole and 1 made a big
comeback on the guys that I was
playing with, but I finished early and
I only knew that we had lost by one
as a team in the end. It was disap
pointing that we lost, my individual
(title] aside. Looking back on it.it
was cool that I won. but disappoint
ing because 1 really wanted to get
those guys [Oklahoma State], since
the only time we get to meet them is
during nationals."
Still. Bramlett is quickly develop
ing as a leader for the Cardinal, and
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray
had nothing but praise for Bram
lett's performance, expecting big
things out of him in the future.
"Joe just came off of a wonderful
day at the LIS Open qualifying tour
nament." Ray said, "lie has been a
solid contributor for us all year. Hie
great thing about Joe is that he is
very consistent and smart on the golf
course — he plays like he is a senior.
All of his characteristics on the
course add up to the great player
that he is. I look forward to seeing
how he fares at the NCAAs."
After entering the program hear
ing that Stanford had failed to win a
tournament for the past several
years. Bramlett was encouraged by

his team's early results. Hie Cardinal
came out of the gate strong, though,
winning the Gopher Invitational on
Sept. 17 to start the year.
"We've had a really good sea
son." he said. "Stanford hadn't won a
tournament in a while, and it was
nice to start the season ott with a
win. Our first win seemed to carry us
through the season. I knew we'd
have a good team coming in at the
beginning of the year, but it's hard to
expect to play this well."
Bramlett will face his first NCAA
Regional tournament this week
against the top teams in the country.
When the pressure of such a large
and crucial tournament was men
tioned. Bramlett laughed, showing
his enthusiasm.
"My favorite part of golf is the
competition and the pressure that
happens at the tournaments." he
said. "I love the pressure — that's
why we practice. If you're not com
peting for something, then the game
becomes meaningless.
"The best feeling is when some
thing is on the line." Bramlett con
tinued. "Basically, when I practice,
the competition is all I try to envi
sion. We play because we want to
win. We have to make those tough
shots sometimes, and when you are
able to. it's just amazing."
