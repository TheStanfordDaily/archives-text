# Cheaters prosper in NBA
## 
### 
The NBA playoffs have been
everything they've ever been
cracked up to be this year.
From the high-flying drama of the
Warriors' upset over the Mavericks,
to the dominance of the Pistons and
the clash of Western-Conference
powerhouses San Antonio and
Phoenix, every minute has had its
fair share of drama, and every team
has had hope. (Okay.every team but
the Wizards. Sue me.)
And that's why David Stern has
never looked more idiotic than he
does right at this moment.
If you saw the final minutes of the
action-packed, series-tying Game 4
in San Antonio, as the Suns topped
the Spurs, you witnessed one of the
greatest cheap shots of all time. And
by great. 1 mean effective and repre
hensible at the same time.
With the Suns pulling away, en
route to their come-from-behind
104-98 victory. Spurs forward Robert
Horry, in a naked act of aggression,
made perhaps one of the most despi
cable fouls in recent NBA history,el
bowing the Suns' All-Star point
guard Steve Nash in the face and hip
checking him out of bounds. And as
Nash lay stunned at the foot of the
scorers' table, all Hell broke loose.
Phoenix's reaction was both pre
dictable and tragic, as players on
court huddled around Horry in a
baseball-style shoving match, while
the Suns' bench leapt to its feet. But
forwards Boris Diaw and Amare
Stoudemire went one step further, or
literally several steps, as they each
initially moved to defend their strick
en teammate. Diaw thought better of
it quickly, and took just a half step
onto the court before returning to
the bench, while Stoudemire had to
be restrained by teammates and
coaches. Neither actually made it to
the fracas that had erupted near the
scorers' table at mid-court.
But the damage was done.
And for their non-roles in the
"fight" at San Antonio, the NBA sus
pended both Diaw and Stoudemire
for Game 5. Horry received a two
game suspension for his cheap shot
at Nash and his role in the subse
quent. irritable confrontation on
court. But the Spurs can survive
without Horry. Without Diaw and.
especially, Stoudemire, the Suns are
dead in the water for tonight's Game
5 in Phoenix.
The league has long had a clear
policy that players who leave the im
mediate vicinity of the bench during
a fight will be suspended, no matter
the circumstances.
And so it is that the Spurs won
Game 5 before it even started â€” all
it took was sacrificing every shred of
decency and honor to their names,or
at least Robert I lorry's. Once known
as the master of the last-second,
game-winning shot, Horry's name
should now be synonymous with
dirty play that pays off.
That's why the NBAs ruling is id
iotic in this case. To be sure, the
league needs to prevent on-court
riots, and that's what the rule is de
signed to do. But in this case, that's
not the message commissioner
David Stern and his underlings are
sending.
Here, they're telling anyone who
will listen that provoking your oppo
nents will be counted against them.
Here, they're declaring open season
on the teams that play with passion,
as opposed to teams like the Spurs,
who have revealed themselves as of
late to be a cold-blooded (see:
Horry, Robert ),whiny (see: Duncan.
Tim), dirty (see: Bowen. Bruce)
bunch of cheap-shot artists who also
happen to be pretty good at basket
ball. I have to believe that they've
lost themselves a lot of casual fans
this postseason, and I'm one of
them. Before, I admired the Spurs
for their old-school approach to win
ning championships, centering on
defense and solid play in the post.
No more.
Now. I admire the Suns' fire. Even
if it was stupid, it was human. I can't
blame Stoudemire and Diaw from
letting their emotions get the best of
them to race to the defense of Nash.
Of course, it would have been better
if they'd stopped and thought, but
young men in pressure-filled envi
