# Dependent care cut
## Decision to discontinue health care plan leaves spouses, children behind 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jenny Shemwell was starting to
worry, it was December 2006, four
months after her husband, Jon. began
his graduate studies at Stanford, and
Shemwell had not secured health cov
erage for herself or for her young
daughter Grace. With cold and flu sea
son underway,Shemwell considered lo
cating health insurance a top priority
for her family but found the task daunt
ing.
A year earlier, Shemwell would
have had no trouble finding health cov
erage for herself and Grace — they
could have simply opted to join Stan

ford's Dependent Health Care Plan.
But with the program's cancellation in
September 2006, finding health insur
ance transformed from a simple
process into an ordeal that took nearly
half a year for the Shemwells and a few
other graduate student families.
For some of those affected. Stan
ford's decision to cancel the plan raises
questions about whether the Universi
ty has an obligation to ensure that
everyone living within its extended
community has access to health cover
age.
"The University wants us all to have
insurance but they don't feel like it's
feasible or affordable to help us,"
Shemwell said. "So it's nothing."

In a system of increasingly expen
sive and complex health coverage op
tions. Stanford maintains that as an em
ployer and institution of higher learn
ing. it is committed to providing stu
dents with means and benefits suffi
cient for the care and maintenance of
their families.
"We understand the pressures and
difficulties that students have in this
area." Vaden Health Center Associate
Director Amy Baldwin said in an email
to The Daily. "Our staff in the In
surance Office is deeply concerned and
cares a great deal about this issue."
Irumped by the high price of health care and
a renewed determination to cut costs, the Univer
sity's commitment has fallen short for as many as
100 families.
Graduate student families are a small corner
of the Stanford community, represented by only
a single member of the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC).
"I'd really like to see a dependent health care
program come back," said GSC co-Chair Kristi
na Keating, a former member of the council's ad
vocacy committee. "It doesn't come up at the
GSC meetings a lot. but for the people that it's an
issue for. it's an issue all the time."
"If we need to maintain a diverse community,"
she added, "we need to make sure that depend
ents are welcome."
Even before the April 2(X)6 announcement
that the Dependent Health Care Plan would be
cancelled five months later, the program was liv
ing on borrowed time. Students were speculating
as early as 2001 that the plan would be cancelled,
according to a review of materials posted on the
GSC's health care advocacy Web site.
Speculation began when Stanford Hospitals
and Clinics announced that it would stop partici
pating in Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) contracts, including the ones serving
Stanford students and their dependents. As a re
sult. Baldwin acknowledged, the premiums on
health plans using the Hospitals and Clinics'
services increased.
At that time, the Dependent Health Care Plan
served approximately 10 percent of graduate stu
dents' spouses, according to a survey that the Grad
uate Health Care Task Force released in 2(X)4.
The end result was a series of subsidies award
ed to students in order to make health care more
affordable.These,according to Baldwin, included
a $150 award to each dependent family member.
Despite the subsidies, however, premiums
continued to climb. During the 2003-2004 aca
demic year, they were reported by students to
have been as low as $150 per month. By 2005-
2006. they were $475 per month for a spouse and
$790 per month for a spouse and one child, even
after applying the University's subsidy.
Premiums increased rapidly in part because,
as they went up. the membership pool narrowed
to those students least likely to be accepted by
other programs — individuals whose medical
costs were high because of chronic health condi
tions or because of care-intensive situations like
pregnancy. I"he plan was abolished because the
premiums were projected to increase by 50 per
cent for the 2006-2007 school year. At its cancel
lation, about 100 individuals were enrolled in the
plan, and as a result, the response was quieter
than it had been in previous years.
"It makes sense that it can't sustain itself," said

If you have kids or if you
have a pregnant spouse,
private insurance is pretty
much not affordable.

Matt Andrews, grad student
education graduate student Matt Andrews,
whose wife and two children were enrolled in the
plan.
Despite the Dependent Health Care Plan's
high premiums, hassles and costs actually in
creased for many of the families who had been
enrolled after the program was terminated.
One Ph.D. student in the social sciences, who
was granted anonymity due to the stigma at
tached to chronic health conditions, reported
medical bills totaling approximately $9,600 in
out-of-pocket medical expenses since the De
pendent Health Care Plan was cancelled. Both
her husband, who is also a student, and her son
have severe chronic health problems.
"It looks to me that Stanford is reducing its re
sponsibilities for student health care," she said.
"It gets more expensive every year."
Although costs were high under the Depen
dent HealthCare Plan,she said, the switch to out
side health insurance carriers was worse.
"[The plan] was definitely better than having
insurance on the private market," she said. "It
was better than dealing with a company that had
no institutional relationship with me. If I disput
ed an insurance charge, having Vaden as an advo
cate was very helpful."
Andrews, who has previously represented stu
dents with families on the GSC. concurred.
"If you have kids or if you have a pregnant
spouse, [private insurance] is pretty much not af
fordable." he said. "The other population that
was hurt is people who move to Stanford. You
talk to people who were three months without
health insurance."
The Shemwells were one such family.
"[My husbands] first paycheck didn't come
until mid-October." Shemwell said. "By the time
I actually got the paperwork finished, it was mid-
November. Around the end of December, they fi
nally accepted [my daughter Grace] to Medi
cal's no-cost program."
Although both Grace Shemwell and her
brother now have full medical coverage, the in
surance Jenny found for herself is emergency
only.
"My current insurance covers nothing, and 1

have a $4.(MX) deductible," she said. "1 pay $90 a
month for the security of knowing that I'm not
going to lose more money if I have a major med
ical mishap. Everything else is out-of-pocket."
Stanford students and their dependents are
offered access to both private and public health
insurance providers. Emphasis is placed on "no
cost" programs like Medi-Cal. Healthy Families
and Healthy Kids, which provide full preventa
tive care insurance to children and have no de
ductible.
But Andrews said the lack of options outside
of California's state plans might deter some from
coming to Stanford.
"The biggest problem [with the state pro
grams]," he said, "is that international students
don't qualify."
Xuehua Zhang is a fifth-year graduate student
from China who is studying in the School of
Earth Sciences.
"It's really difficult to find out [about insur
ance]," she said. "The only way you find out is by
networking with other Chinese students. You
find out what the cheap options are."
"One candidate [prospective student] who
was here was really concerned about insurance
for three children," she added.
In the near future, Baldwin promised, Vaden
will work with the GSC Health Care Task Force
to try to fix some of the problems facing students
trying to find health insurance for their families.
"We believe it is important for all students and
their families to have adequate health insur
ance." said Baldwin.
According to Baldwin and Keating, the first
step will be to improve outreach by making more
information about the system available. In addi
tion, another version of the 2004 survey on what
plans students are using will obtain more up-to
date information about the needs of graduate
students and their dependents.
If Keating can pull together a large enough
pool of interested families, some students hope
that a University-sponsored health insurance
plan for dependents might be resuscitated. Ac
cording to Keating, providing coverage to de
pendents is not optional.
"I'm Canadian," Keating said. "1 think that
health care is one of those things that is provided
for everyone. I think the University needs to pro
vide good health care for its entire community."
For both Keating and Shemwell, ensuring that
students' families understand their options is a
top priority.
"We are trying to find a way to get information
out [for] new people coming to Stanford as a pub
lic service," Shemwell said. "It would have been
nice for someone to tell me."

pregnancy. I"he plan was abolished because the
premiums were projected to increase by 50 per
cent for the 2006-2007 school year. At its cancel
lation, about 100 individuals were enrolled in the
plan, and as a result, the response was quieter
than it had been in previous years.
"It makes sense that it can't sustain itself," said

If you have kids or if you
have a pregnant spouse,
private insurance is pretty
much not affordable.

Matt Andrews, grad student
education graduate student Matt Andrews,
whose wife and two children were enrolled in the
plan.
Despite the Dependent Health Care Plan's
high premiums, hassles and costs actually in
creased for many of the families who had been
enrolled after the program was terminated.
One Ph.D. student in the social sciences, who
was granted anonymity due to the stigma at
tached to chronic health conditions, reported
medical bills totaling approximately $9,600 in
out-of-pocket medical expenses since the De
pendent Health Care Plan was cancelled. Both
her husband, who is also a student, and her son
have severe chronic health problems.
"It looks to me that Stanford is reducing its re
sponsibilities for student health care," she said.
"It gets more expensive every year."
Although costs were high under the Depen
dent HealthCare Plan,she said, the switch to out
side health insurance carriers was worse.
"[The plan] was definitely better than having
insurance on the private market," she said. "It
was better than dealing with a company that had
no institutional relationship with me. If I disput
ed an insurance charge, having Vaden as an advo
cate was very helpful."
Andrews, who has previously represented stu
dents with families on the GSC. concurred.
"If you have kids or if you have a pregnant
spouse, [private insurance] is pretty much not af
fordable." he said. "The other population that
was hurt is people who move to Stanford. You
talk to people who were three months without
health insurance."
The Shemwells were one such family.
"[My husbands] first paycheck didn't come
until mid-October." Shemwell said. "By the time
I actually got the paperwork finished, it was mid-
November. Around the end of December, they fi
nally accepted [my daughter Grace] to Medi
cal's no-cost program."
Although both Grace Shemwell and her
brother now have full medical coverage, the in
surance Jenny found for herself is emergency
only.
"My current insurance covers nothing, and 1

have a $4.(MX) deductible," she said. "1 pay $90 a
month for the security of knowing that I'm not
going to lose more money if I have a major med
ical mishap. Everything else is out-of-pocket."
Stanford students and their dependents are
offered access to both private and public health
insurance providers. Emphasis is placed on "no
cost" programs like Medi-Cal. Healthy Families
and Healthy Kids, which provide full preventa
tive care insurance to children and have no de
ductible.
But Andrews said the lack of options outside
of California's state plans might deter some from
coming to Stanford.
"The biggest problem [with the state pro
grams]," he said, "is that international students
don't qualify."
Xuehua Zhang is a fifth-year graduate student
from China who is studying in the School of
Earth Sciences.
"It's really difficult to find out [about insur
ance]," she said. "The only way you find out is by
networking with other Chinese students. You
find out what the cheap options are."
"One candidate [prospective student] who
was here was really concerned about insurance
for three children," she added.
In the near future, Baldwin promised, Vaden
will work with the GSC Health Care Task Force
to try to fix some of the problems facing students
trying to find health insurance for their families.
"We believe it is important for all students and
their families to have adequate health insur
ance." said Baldwin.
According to Baldwin and Keating, the first
step will be to improve outreach by making more
information about the system available. In addi
tion, another version of the 2004 survey on what
plans students are using will obtain more up-to
date information about the needs of graduate
students and their dependents.
If Keating can pull together a large enough
pool of interested families, some students hope
that a University-sponsored health insurance
plan for dependents might be resuscitated. Ac
cording to Keating, providing coverage to de
pendents is not optional.
"I'm Canadian," Keating said. "1 think that
health care is one of those things that is provided
for everyone. I think the University needs to pro
vide good health care for its entire community."
For both Keating and Shemwell, ensuring that
students' families understand their options is a
top priority.
"We are trying to find a way to get information
out [for] new people coming to Stanford as a pub
lic service," Shemwell said. "It would have been
nice for someone to tell me."

Jenny Shemwell was starting to
worry, it was December 2006, four
months after her husband, Jon. began
his graduate studies at Stanford, and
Shemwell had not secured health cov
erage for herself or for her young
daughter Grace. With cold and flu sea
son underway,Shemwell considered lo
cating health insurance a top priority
for her family but found the task daunt
ing.
A year earlier, Shemwell would
have had no trouble finding health cov
erage for herself and Grace — they
could have simply opted to join Stan

ford's Dependent Health Care Plan.
But with the program's cancellation in
September 2006, finding health insur
ance transformed from a simple
process into an ordeal that took nearly
half a year for the Shemwells and a few
other graduate student families.
For some of those affected. Stan
ford's decision to cancel the plan raises
questions about whether the Universi
ty has an obligation to ensure that
everyone living within its extended
community has access to health cover
age.
"The University wants us all to have
insurance but they don't feel like it's
feasible or affordable to help us,"
Shemwell said. "So it's nothing."

In a system of increasingly expen
sive and complex health coverage op
tions. Stanford maintains that as an em
ployer and institution of higher learn
ing. it is committed to providing stu
dents with means and benefits suffi
cient for the care and maintenance of
their families.
"We understand the pressures and
difficulties that students have in this
area." Vaden Health Center Associate
Director Amy Baldwin said in an email
to The Daily. "Our staff in the In
surance Office is deeply concerned and
cares a great deal about this issue."
Irumped by the high price of health care and
a renewed determination to cut costs, the Univer
sity's commitment has fallen short for as many as
100 families.
Graduate student families are a small corner
of the Stanford community, represented by only
a single member of the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC).
"I'd really like to see a dependent health care
program come back," said GSC co-Chair Kristi
na Keating, a former member of the council's ad
vocacy committee. "It doesn't come up at the
GSC meetings a lot. but for the people that it's an
issue for. it's an issue all the time."
"If we need to maintain a diverse community,"
she added, "we need to make sure that depend
ents are welcome."
Even before the April 2(X)6 announcement
that the Dependent Health Care Plan would be
cancelled five months later, the program was liv
ing on borrowed time. Students were speculating
as early as 2001 that the plan would be cancelled,
according to a review of materials posted on the
GSC's health care advocacy Web site.
Speculation began when Stanford Hospitals
and Clinics announced that it would stop partici
pating in Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) contracts, including the ones serving
Stanford students and their dependents. As a re
sult. Baldwin acknowledged, the premiums on
health plans using the Hospitals and Clinics'
services increased.
At that time, the Dependent Health Care Plan
served approximately 10 percent of graduate stu
dents' spouses, according to a survey that the Grad
uate Health Care Task Force released in 2(X)4.
The end result was a series of subsidies award
ed to students in order to make health care more
affordable.These,according to Baldwin, included
a $150 award to each dependent family member.
Despite the subsidies, however, premiums
continued to climb. During the 2003-2004 aca
demic year, they were reported by students to
have been as low as $150 per month. By 2005-
2006. they were $475 per month for a spouse and
$790 per month for a spouse and one child, even
after applying the University's subsidy.
Premiums increased rapidly in part because,
as they went up. the membership pool narrowed
to those students least likely to be accepted by
other programs — individuals whose medical
costs were high because of chronic health condi
tions or because of care-intensive situations like
pregnancy. I"he plan was abolished because the
premiums were projected to increase by 50 per
cent for the 2006-2007 school year. At its cancel
lation, about 100 individuals were enrolled in the
