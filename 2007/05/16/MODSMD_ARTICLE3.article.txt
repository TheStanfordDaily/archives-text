# Dependent care cut
## Decision to discontinue health care plan leaves spouses, children behind 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jenny Shemwell was starting to
worry, it was December 2006, four
months after her husband, Jon. began
his graduate studies at Stanford, and
Shemwell had not secured health cov
erage for herself or for her young
daughter Grace. With cold and flu sea
son underway,Shemwell considered lo
cating health insurance a top priority
for her family but found the task daunt
ing.
A year earlier, Shemwell would
have had no trouble finding health cov
erage for herself and Grace â€” they
could have simply opted to join Stan

ford's Dependent Health Care Plan.
But with the program's cancellation in
September 2006, finding health insur
ance transformed from a simple
process into an ordeal that took nearly
half a year for the Shemwells and a few
other graduate student families.
For some of those affected. Stan
ford's decision to cancel the plan raises
questions about whether the Universi
ty has an obligation to ensure that
everyone living within its extended
community has access to health cover
age.
"The University wants us all to have
insurance but they don't feel like it's
feasible or affordable to help us,"
Shemwell said. "So it's nothing."

In a system of increasingly expen
sive and complex health coverage op
tions. Stanford maintains that as an em
ployer and institution of higher learn
ing. it is committed to providing stu
dents with means and benefits suffi
cient for the care and maintenance of
their families.
"We understand the pressures and
difficulties that students have in this
area." Vaden Health Center Associate
Director Amy Baldwin said in an email
to The Daily. "Our staff in the In
surance Office is deeply concerned and
cares a great deal about this issue."
