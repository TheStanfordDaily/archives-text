# Crew closes with Trojans, tops Cal at Pac-10s
## 
### ERIK ADAMS 
Despite entering Sunday's Pacific-10
Conference Crew Championships ranked
No. 18 in the country, with three top-10
teams in the water, the Stanford women's
varsity eight pulled off two upsets to come
away with the silver medal. It was the team's
highest finish at the Pac-lOs since taking
home the gold in 2002; it was also a signifi
cant improvement over last year's fifth
place finish in the event.
The upstart Cardinal was unable to keep
pace for some time with the favorite top
ranked Southern California, which finished
first with a 6:39.8 time and remains unde
feated — but Stanford's closest competition
came in a heated battle for second with No. 8
California.
In a dramatic finish, both Stanford and
Cal were able to surge past a tiring No. 10
UCLA squad in the final stages of the race.
The two teams matched each other stroke
for-stroke until the final moment, as the Car
dinal edged the Bears by 1.2 seconds to fin
ish with a time of 6:43.3 and claim second.

rhe eiuhts realized that they had to fin

ish in the top two to ensure an NCAA bid,"
head coach Yasmin Farooq said. "The plan
was always to be at our best for the Pac-lOs,
and we seem to be peaking at the right time."
Stanford had not finished ahead of its
Bay-Area rivals this year, but defeated Cal
twice on the day, winning the heat and com
ing out on top again in the final. The Bears
are the defending national champions and
they have won three consecutive Pac-10 ti
tles before this year.
The Cardinal's final time was also just 3.5
seconds behind (JSC. which is the closest any
team has come to the Trojans this year.
Rounding out the top five with USC,
Stanford and California in the varsity eight
were No. 10 I(!LA (6:48.7) and No.2oOre
gon State (6:50.5).
The Cardinal also benefited from solid
performances from its second varsity eight
team, which won the Petite final a full 5.5
seconds ahead of UC-Davis.The varsity four
also finished fifth in a field of nine.
Stanford's combined scores were enough
to place it fifth in the final team standings
with 51 points,behind USC.CaI. Washington
and UCLA, respectively.

Next up for Stanford will be the NCAA
Championships. May 25-27 in Oak Ridge,
Tenn.There, the Cardinal will face its tough
est competition yet, according to Farooq.
The field is full of perennial contenders
like the Ivy League's Harvard. Brown.
Princeton and this year's champion Yale, as
well as Notre Dame, which has already de
feated the Cardinal this year. Stanford will
also see familiar foes California, USC and
UCLA, but there are some tough newcom
ers on the NCAA scene as well.
"We have never faced Minnesota, but
they are having just a phenomenal year," Fa
rooq said.
Still, the coach believes her team is em
bracing the challenge with confidence.
"We feel that we are in a great position
coming in and we have the benefit of getting
to race USC several times this year." she
said. "We are really looking forward to com
peting with these other great teams and
showing them what we can do."
Stanford's experience with the national
favorite will certainly help, but to win, the
Cardinal will still need to find a way around
the Trojans, something no one has been able

to do this year.
While the Pac-10 Championships proved
difficult for Stanford on Sunday.just one day
earlier the Cardinal women's lightweight
team swept the Pacific Coast Rowing Cham
pionships.
Both the varsity lightweight teams won
easily, with the four finishing in 8:00.7 to top
Humbolt State (8:18.8), UC-San Diego
(8:24.0), Pacific (8:30.4) and California
(8:38.1).The Cardinal eight finished in 7:21.2
over Loyola Marymount (7:49.2); the PCRC
victory in the eight was Stanford's fifth in the
last six years.
Head coach A 1 Acosta was pleased with
the performance and congratulated his ath
letes on being "focused and committed
enough to get this result."
The Cardinal lightweights will look to
carry the momentum they gained in their
dominating PCRC victory into the IRA Re
gatta at the start of June. There they will
match up with much tougher competition
than they saw in the PCRC, including No. 1

Next up for Stanford will be the NCAA
Championships. May 25-27 in Oak Ridge,
Tenn.There, the Cardinal will face its tough
est competition yet, according to Farooq.
The field is full of perennial contenders
like the Ivy League's Harvard. Brown.
Princeton and this year's champion Yale, as
well as Notre Dame, which has already de
feated the Cardinal this year. Stanford will
also see familiar foes California, USC and
UCLA, but there are some tough newcom

"We have never faced Minnesota, but
they are having just a phenomenal year," Fa

"We feel that we are in a great position
coming in and we have the benefit of getting

showing them what we can do."

The Cardinal lightweights will look to

dominating PCRC victory into the IRA Re
