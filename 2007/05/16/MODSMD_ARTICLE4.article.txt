# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students avoid the pump 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Frustrated by surging gas prices, stu
dent activists at Stanford joined a na
tionwide boycott of gas yesterday in a
long-shot effort to put a dent in the Mid
dle Eastern oil industry and force com
panies to lower their prices.
A similar "No-Gas" effort in 1999
had little success, but advocates of this
year's protest said they hoped to inspire
a new generation of activists through
various Internet resources including
MySpace, Facebook and mass emails.
Stacie Chan '10 does not have a car
on campus, but that didn't stop her from
joining a "No Gas" Facebook group to

show her support for the movement.
Chan said she believes new social net
working sites will increase the move
ment's chances for success.
"Many events like this have taken
place in the past through chain emails
hoping to achieve the same thing," she
said. 'But because Facebook is such a
huge network, hopefully this collabora
tion will have a greater effect."
Most economists agreed that the
one-day effort would not have an im
pact on gasoline prices.
In spite of skepticism, students re
solved to protest pump prices, while oth
ers sought to raise awareness about the


BECKY WRIGHT/The Stanford Daily
negative environmental conse
quences of America's dependence
on foreign oil.
ASSU Senator Patrick Cordova
'09 said he thought the boycott
would be an effective tool to in
crease activism about the issue.
"I feel as if abstaining from the
purchase of gas on a specific day is
an excellent way for young people
who are a large part of the motorist
market to be committed to the
cause," he said.
Others said they thought the event
was just another idealist-inspired at
tempt that failed to address the fun
damental problems associated with
fuel demand and dependence.
"Long-term demand won't
change due to fluctuations on a
day-to-day basis," said William Vi
jvcrberg '10. "Because people are
still driving and using gasoline as
they normally would, the event has

little economic impact."
For his part, Cordova lauded the
event as a way to unite a genera
tion.
"1 am not making any predictive
statements about the event,"he
said, "but 1 certainly think that any
positive movement that has the
right idea doesn't hurt, and I ap
plaud the organizers for their
work."
