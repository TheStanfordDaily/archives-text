## Housing design earns victory Stanford team will donate prize money to non-profit 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
A six-person Stanford team recently won
the Bank of America Low Income Housing
Challenge for their innovative design for low
income apartment housing for homeless and
other economically at-risk individuals.
During the competition, Universities in
Northern and Central California paired up
with developers to come up with a building

The project is judged on several factors, in

that was actually available. We wanted to pick

town San Francisco that was walking distance
from Coit Tower and the Ferry Building and
provided a view of the Bay Bridge. The site
is currently owned by the San Francisco Re
development Agency and is earmarked for
use as affordable housing.
Cantor lauded the site for its broad appeal.
"It is an awesome place to live regardless
of your income level," Cantor said. "The loca
tion set the site apart because it is a place
everyone wanted to live."
Teams from UC-Berkeley and Cal Poly.
San Luis Obispo also participated in this
year's competition. The win is the first for
Stanford since 2(X)3.
The winning design included two five
story buildings around a courtyard. The proj
ect would house 150 people in 44 two- and
