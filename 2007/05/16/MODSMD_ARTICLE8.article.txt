ITiis year."five" is the new "one."
No Draw group or individual expe
rienced the thrill of the most covet
ed number in the 2007 Draw. The
most enviable number in this year's
Draw was five, and it was given to a
group of five freshman girls from
Donner.
In the hours after the Draw num
bers were posted last Wednesday af
ternoon. there were rumors, emails
and Facebook status messages that
claimed the best number, but noth
ing conclusive.
Was it possible that no one got
number one?
Since the numbers are assigned
randomly, it is possible. Fewer
groups than numbers means not all
numbers are given out each year.
When they saw their number, the
lucky Donner girls didn't know it
was the best in the Draw, but they
were still excited. As soon as Diana
Ajuria '10 saw her group's number,
she rushed to inform her draw
mates.
"When I saw Diana had called
me [right after the 5 p.m. posting], 1
knew that was a good sign." said
Caitlin Hewitt '10. who was in class
