ITiis year."five" is the new "one."
No Draw group or individual expe
rienced the thrill of the most covet
ed number in the 2007 Draw. The
most enviable number in this year's
Draw was five, and it was given to a
group of five freshman girls from
Donner.
In the hours after the Draw num
bers were posted last Wednesday af
ternoon. there were rumors, emails
and Facebook status messages that
claimed the best number, but noth
ing conclusive.
Was it possible that no one got
number one?
Since the numbers are assigned
randomly, it is possible. Fewer
groups than numbers means not all
numbers are given out each year.
When they saw their number, the
lucky Donner girls didn't know it
was the best in the Draw, but they
were still excited. As soon as Diana
Ajuria '10 saw her group's number,
she rushed to inform her draw
mates.
"When I saw Diana had called
me [right after the 5 p.m. posting], 1
knew that was a good sign." said
Caitlin Hewitt '10. who was in class
when the numbers were posted.
"1 found out The Daily was looking for
number one," said Ajuria,"! thought, we're not
number one, but can we still be in the paper?"
Deciding their housing preferences wasn't
hard, even as newcomers to the Draw. "Peo
ple told us that we'd be the laughingstock if
we chose anything but Bob." said Angie
McPhaul'lo.
"We thought about putting 717 Dolores,
but we got over that pretty fast," she said.
"People reminded us there was a hill."
Indeed, suggestions and comments were
coming from all sides as the news of their
number spread around parts of campus.
Dorms were buzzing with chatter and patrons
at the Art Library were passing along the gos
sip over books.
Fame can be a bit intimidating, especially
for a group of freshmen.
"Every one always hates us," said McPhaul.
But having the best number isn't all bad.
"There was one person who offered to throw
us a parade," she said.
Aside from parades and the obvious bene
fit of first choice in next year's on-campus
housing, getting the lowest number has its
perks.
"We had someone offer to come wash our
sheets so he could visit us in Bob," said Jessica
Havlak *10. "People don't have to wash our
sheets to come visit. They can just be our
friends."
Housing declined to release the names of
the student(s) who received the last number
in the draw. One official told The Daily that
the office didn't want to "exploit the misfor
tunes of others."
