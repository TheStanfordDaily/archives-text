## Rising tension in Somalia as bomb kills soldiers, Ethiopia debates pullout 
### Peter Durning 
A roadside bomb north of Mo
gadishu. the capital of Somalia, killed
four African Union (AU) soldiers and
wounded five more when it detonated
next to their patrol convoy on Wednes
day. ITie attack was the most deadly
strike yet against the force of 1 .MX) Ugan
dan troops that arrived in the Somali cap
ital in March and came just a day after the
Somalian President Abdullahi Vusuf dis
cussed peacekeeping operations with
Uganda's leader. Yoweri Museveni.
The Ugandan forces are participat
ing in a peacekeeping mission spon
sored by the African Union, a body of
53 African states that aims to promote
unity, prosperity and good governance
among the beleaguered continent's di
verse nations. The Ugandans are due to
be joined by a proposed force of more
than 6.000 that will take over security
duties from the Ethiopian military,
which has occupied neighboring Soma
lia since the end of 2006. However, the
remainder of the 8.000 African Union
peacekeepers is not likely to be in place
for many more months, according to
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and
Stanford graduate Jendayi Frazer '85.
The involvement of the African
Union in the troubles of Somalia repre
sents the latest attempt to bring order to
a country that has endured more than a
decade of chaotic violence and instabil
ity. Created from colonial territories of
Britain and Italy in 1960, Somalia was
aligned with the Soviet Union under
the leadership of Siad Barre in 1970.
When Mr. Barre was killed by rival
clans in 1991, none of the Somali fac
tions then dominant could agree on a
successor, leaving Somalia effectively
without a government for 16 years.

During this period of anarchy, Somali
militias shot down two Blaekhawk heli
copters involved in the U.S. military's
attempts to capture Mohammad Farrah
Aidid.
Last fall, a militia operated by the
Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) pushed
out many of these warlords and took con
trol of large parts of southern Somalia, in
cluding Mogadishu. ITie UIC formed out
of the consolidation of the many small,
local Islamic courts that were set up in the
principally Muslim state to combat the
frequent thievery and extortion that had
taken hold of the lawless country. The
UIC is believed to contain both moder
ate and hard line elements — in some
cases it has only championed the restora
tion of peace and stability in Somalia
while at other times the organization has
closed soccer stadiums and removed for
eign music and films from radios and the
aters. The United States has accused the
UIC of having links to Islamist terrorist
organizations — claims that the UIC has
denied.
In response, with the sanction of
Washington, the military of Christian
majority Ethiopian ousted the UIC in
December 2006.placing a rival, interna
tionally recognized government in
power. 'ITie government formed in
Kenya two years before but had little to
no power until the Ethiopian invasion.
The Ethiopian government has also
claimed that the Islamists were armed
by Ethiopia's arch-nemesis, Eritrea, fu
eling international worries about a re
gional conflict in the I lorn of Africa.
With the defeat of the UIC, Ethiopia
has expressed a desire to withdraw, but
both the U.S. and the African Union
have urged Ethiopia to keep its soldiers

in Somalia until they are entirely re
placed by the forces of the AU.
The successes and failures of the AU
units in Somalia will represent an impor
tant benchmark for its potential to serve
as a stabilizing force in the African conti
nent. Launched in 2002, the African
Union replaced the Organization of
African Unity, which kept a policy of
non-interference in the affairs of mem
ber states. The AU, in contrast, aims to
use more active intervention to achieve a
set of long-term goals, which include a
central bank, a human rights court and a
single currency for all of Africa by 2023.
African Darfur force in jeopardy

In the meantime, however, the AU's
main peacekeeping mission outside of
Somalia is falling into serious jeopardy.
Officials from both the African Union

and the United Nations are now report
ing that the AU's peacekeeping force in
Sudan's Darfur region is on the verge of
collapse due to equipment and funding
shortfalls, the hostility of the Sudanese
government in Khartoum and an in
crease in attacks from Khartoum
backed janjaweed militias that have left
several AU troops dead. Many mem
bers of the international community
have not delivered promised financial
or military assistance to the AU's
peacekeeping mission. Even as the Su
danese government has renewed air
strikes against civilian targets in Darfur.
the AU's mission is finding itself in
creasingly incapable of funding its
troops, and soldiers have had to borrow
food and such basic supplies as soap
from humanitarian organizations and
U.N. employees.
