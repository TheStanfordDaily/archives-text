Prof. Stan Lai's work is hack on the
Stanford stage.
Atter making headlines with the
English-language premier of "Secret
Love in Peach Blossom Land" at the
University this winter. Lai's "Sand on
a Distant Star" will make its English

language debut tonight in a perform
ance organized by the Asian Ameri
can Theater Project (AATP).
"lt'sa comedy,"said Linda Serrato'o7.
the play's director."but it deals with ideas
of loneliness, abandonment and hope."
Lai is an award-winning play
wright and director from Taiwan.
"'Sand' [deals) with hopes, fears
and illusions that are very universal,"
Lai said in an email to The Daily.
According to "Sand on a Distant Star"
producer ViolettaTaing '08, AATP's mis
sion has changed in recent years.
"The original mission [was] to en

courage Asian-American talent in
the arts and to portray Asian-Ameri
cans in non-typical roles," she said.
"Our mission this year has really just
been to encourage people to become
involved in theatre. As a small group
I think we're a little less intimidating
(to) maybe someone who's never
acted before."
Taing said this change is reflected
in the project's decision to perform
"Sand on a Distant Star."
"Instead of having specific cultural
themes, it's appealing to everybody."
she said. "We thought it'd be good be

cause we'd be able to (have) a diverse
cast, rather than a totally Asian cast."
"Sand on a Distant Star" will run
in Kresge Auditorium starting today
and continue through Sunday. From
today through Saturday,the play will
begin at 8 p.m. On Sunday, the pro
duction will be at 2:30 p.m.
