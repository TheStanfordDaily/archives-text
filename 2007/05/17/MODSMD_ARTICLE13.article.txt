## Editorial Board Vote no on tobacco ban 
### 
This afternoon, the Faculty Senate
will consider and potentially vote
on a proposal that would ban
Stanford researchers from accepting
fundiini from tobacco companies. Such
a polic\ might seem like an obvious
move at first, but a more careful exami
nation ol the ban's potential impact
leads us to urge the Senate to vote
against it.
The most important fact in the de
bate is that tobacco-supported research
is an incredibly small portion of the
grants Stanford receives. Only John P.
Cooke, director ol the Medical School s
vascular medicine and biology pro
gram, receives tobacco-related funding,
and it makes up less than 20 percent of
his research budget. Cooke has also
agreed to stop receiving the tunding in
June due to the controversy, but he is
still one of the most outspoken oppo
nents of the proposed ban.
The case against tobacco funding has
been led In Professors 11 ank (ireely *74.
Robert Jaekler and Robert Proctor,
professors of law, medicine and history
respectively. Their argument has four
basic points: tobacco companies are
awful and have twisted research in the
past; some "legitimate" sources of I uncl
ing will not give grants to an institution
receiving tobacco money; that research
integrity is threatened because many
medical journals will not publish stud
ies done with tobacco money; and final
ly that peer institutions like Harvard
and Johns Hopkins have already adopt

cd similar bans and that we look bad in
com parison.
bach nl these points has legitimate
grounding. But overall, the precedent
set by allowing top-down administra
tion of faculty research is more worri
some. President John Ilennessy said
that "this is a political message" and
added that he worries "about whether
or not that is a wise change in our poli
cy."
Very few people in acadeinia defend
tobacco companies, and if indeed it is
difficult to get published after accept
ing grants from tobacco companies, sci
entists will lose credibility by using re
sources from the industry. In that case,
no mandate is needed. Instead, re
searchers should be able to rely on the
veracity of their own data for legitima
cy.
We have already argued the same po
sition in October 2006. when the Uni
versity of California's Hoard of Regents
proposed a similar ban for the IJC sys
tem. The proposal followed a District
Court ruling by Judge Gladys Kesslcr
which found tobacco companies guilty
of racketeering charges and condemned
their "zeal" for profits at the direct cost
of killing customers. Once again, we
agree with Judge Kessler's vilification
of the tobacco industry, but feel a ban
on all tobacco monies sets a dangerous
precedent that could damage academic
freedom. Last week, the IJC Academic
Senate voted 43-4 against the ban. Now
our Faculty Senate should do the same.
