Convenience wise, having the Internet
in life would mean I would never get lost.
In fact, there would be no possible way to
get lost, since there would always be a

red line connecting me to my destination,
and a red. floating triangle above the
three restaurants in my price range at my
point of destination. Also, I would he

could plan my California road trip, map
out a jog and find out where Kazakhstan

for the life-Internet to preemptively re
call all the things I do a lot. lust as Mo/il
la already remembers my friend's email
addresses with the stroke of one, two
keys max, this recall would apply to
everything as well. As I am getting myself
a salad and reach for the parmesan
cheese, bwamino! my plate is instantly
filled with a perfectly tossed Caesar. If I
had reached for the candied walnuts in
stead of the parm. the lile-Internet would
have known I was making my usual fruit
and nut salad and complete that salad al
gorithm instead. You could use this fea
ture. too. when you can only remember
the beginning of a story or the opening to
a joke — the rest is just conveniently
filled into your brain. You'd never be a
bad joke-teller again.
I could save a lot on gas. thus also help
ing save the world, too. if all my favorite
places were located right next to one an
other on my life toolbar. I need to go to
Safeway, get some brew-dawgs, work on
my fitness and then wish my mom a
happy mother's day? l uckily, Safeway is
right next to Irnie's. which is convenient
ly located next to the Stanford gvm and.
fortunately, is neighbors with my house
in Sacramento. If I start becoming a reg
ular customer at the Nuthouse, that's
fine. I can drag it in between the gym and
the grocery store.
And this is just the start. If life were
like the Internet, you would always have
perfect spelling, grammar and pronunci

be automatically compared against every
similar product.constantly supplying you
with the best buy. You could also know all
the lyrics to every song on the radio. I

011 its understanding of my general man
tastcs. If (iood Sense of 11umor is taken. I
will know that "Women who dated (iood
Sense also dated: Dimples, f'auxhawk and
Sincerc( iuy." Of course it would be able
to check baecbook profiles for dating sta
tus and sexual orientation.
Convenience wise, having the Internet
in life would mean I would never get lost.
In fact, there would be no possible way to
get lost, since there would always be a

red line connecting me to my destination,
and a red. floating triangle above the
three restaurants in my price range at my
point of destination. Also, I would he
ahle to grab the air with my hand and see
the close-up and long shots of my route.
Willi just using fist fills of the Heavens. I
could plan my California road trip, map
out a jog and find out where Kazakhstan
really is. I like.
Similarly timely would be the capacity
for the life-Internet to preemptively re
call all the things I do a lot. lust as Mo/il
la already remembers my friend's email
addresses with the stroke of one, two
keys max, this recall would apply to
everything as well. As I am getting myself
a salad and reach for the parmesan
cheese, bwamino! my plate is instantly
filled with a perfectly tossed Caesar. If I
had reached for the candied walnuts in
stead of the parm. the lile-Internet would
have known I was making my usual fruit
and nut salad and complete that salad al
gorithm instead. You could use this fea
ture. too. when you can only remember
the beginning of a story or the opening to
a joke — the rest is just conveniently
filled into your brain. You'd never be a
bad joke-teller again.
I could save a lot on gas. thus also help
ing save the world, too. if all my favorite
places were located right next to one an
other on my life toolbar. I need to go to
Safeway, get some brew-dawgs, work on
my fitness and then wish my mom a
happy mother's day? l uckily, Safeway is
right next to Irnie's. which is convenient
ly located next to the Stanford gvm and.
fortunately, is neighbors with my house
in Sacramento. If I start becoming a reg
ular customer at the Nuthouse, that's
fine. I can drag it in between the gym and
the grocery store.
And this is just the start. If life were
like the Internet, you would always have
perfect spelling, grammar and pronunci
ation. financially, every purchase would
be automatically compared against every
similar product.constantly supplying you
with the best buy. You could also know all
the lyrics to every song on the radio. I
would also be able to track the passing of
the time in my room because the sky
would turn darker as nicht neared...
