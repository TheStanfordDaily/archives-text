# Your high school reunion
## 
### 
Dear member of the class of 2002:
It's time for your fifth year high school
reunion!
("an you really believe it's been five
years? Why just the other day it seems
iike we were all eating lunch together and
talking about where we wanted to go to
college. I'.xccpt. that is. for Jimmy Kitch
er. who was talking about Harry Potter
(still is!). My. how times have changed.
I'iiclosed you will find our annual
fundraising drive letter. With all of the
memories that you've shared at .
wouldn't it be nice to give back so that fu
ture generations can enjoy the ex
perience? John Post, who heads alumni
donations, wants us to remind all of you
that anyone who donates over $100 gets
the school emblem emblazoned 011 a com
memorative towel.
We're certainly excited about this re
union. Your reunion chairs. Katie Meyer
and Tun Gainesworth 111. are hard at
work ensuring this will be the best re
union ever! Hie opening festivities occur
011 Friday. when we will have a catered
lunch out by the old soccer fields. We'll
have a mixer with faculty members and
that cute girl you had a crush on in bio
class will show up with her husband
around 4:30. You'll leave shortly therc
a Iter.
We've rented out the local hotel to
continue the party into the night. The
prestigious Madison Hotel has been gra
cious enough (thanks. Jim *99!) to allow

us to use their ballroom for the evening.
Hveryone will hand you a eard that says
"consultant" but no one will be able to ex
plain what that means. We'll have light
cocktails and the headmaster will address
us on the importance of community Also,
we will be accepting checks or credit card,
if you feel like your trip down memory
lane loosens your purse strings. Really, no
pressure though. Perhaps you want to
give money in the name of your favorite
teacher, classmate, or just to spite that
smug member of 2001. Persons who do
nate over $500 get the school emblem 011
a commemorative keychain.
On Saturday, we invite all alums to
come watch our lacrosse team compete
against the hated Mountainville I.ions.
Come support your classmate, led Bax
ter. who is coaching our Blue Bears to vic
tory! lie's mellowed out a great deal in
the last live years, but still possesses that
competitive spirit we all love! We know
you and led had a querulous relationship,
but you really should let bygones be by
gones. I doubt he still remembers the

nickname he gave you.
Afterwards, there will be tour of the
new facilities on campus. has man
aged to purchase new pools, a new art
wing, and even an aquarium! Join Jean
Haight. who hasn't left the state in a
decade, as she shows you all the new
things has to offer! The class of
2001 is rumored to be donating money to
build a new fountain, and they've said
some pretty mean things about your
mother recently.
We know that many of you arc won
dering why you should be coming back to
the reunion. Perhaps you're busy with
your new job, or are traveling, or have
family obligations. But even if you are
still finishing up a degree in an impracti
cal subject and haven't secured a job, we
encourage you to drop by the reunion.
Evan Silverstein is working for Goldman
Sachs and has assured us that lie has sev
eral contacts in the business that would
be happy to hire a secretary with your
background in writing. You write little
humor essays, right?
If you absolutely can't attend, you can
still make your presence felt by sending in
this update form on your life. Your class
mates are curious as to what you've been
up to these past few years. Are you going
for a law degree (like Todd Hanson), ex
ploring Mayan ruins (you go Janice
Mendel!), or enrolled in medical school?
We want to know! If you've left no for-


Molt
Holt's Harangue
warding address and not notified
us of transferring colleges, this
would be a great time to let us
know. Hie class of 2001 has al
ready raised over $50,000 for
their alma mater, and I just know
that we can beat them! Go Blue!
Some brief class notes: Mary
Smith '02 and Ned van Ness "02
are tying the knot this June, in a
small ceremony (so don't tell
those who weren't invited, like
Chaz Bunker'o2). Sally Durning
just had a baby (congrats!), but is
still really sensitive about her fat
body. Our prom king. Nav Taylor,
is now a queen. We're very happy
for him in her new lifestyle. Gosh:
we all thought nerdy Steven
Phillips would grow up to be a
millionaire. But nope, he still
speaks Hlvish and lives with his
parents (and greetings to his ham
sters, "Linux", and "Kirk". Hey
little guys!) Gil Washington has
turned his hobby into a career,
and is now a hitman. Finally,
Henry Stackpole. Yuki Miyazaki

and Montgomery "Mail Dog"
Johnson finally dealt with their
superiority complexes. Now that
they've been accepted to their top
choice of business schools, they
really are superior! Congrats to
them!
Hie class of 2001 had nearly per
fect attendance at the reunion, and
they've donated nearly twice as
much as we have. Come on people,
you hated those assholes. Ok. we
didn't want to have to say this, but
the class of 2001 kidnapped our
children and our holding them ran
som. Did 1 say "our" children? 1
meant your children. Iliey've kid
napped your future children using a
time machine they donated to the
school, llic only way to beat these
bastards is to donate to the class ol
2002 fund, (live now. your children
need you. Fveryone who donates
time machines become mil
lennial members, and that means
they get both the kcychain and the
towel.
We look forward to seeing you
in a few short weeks! Go Blue!

Chris will be listed as "where

Dear member of the class of 2002:
It's time for your fifth year high school
reunion!
("an you really believe it's been five
years? Why just the other day it seems
iike we were all eating lunch together and
talking about where we wanted to go to
college. I'.xccpt. that is. for Jimmy Kitch
er. who was talking about Harry Potter
(still is!). My. how times have changed.
I'iiclosed you will find our annual
fundraising drive letter. With all of the
memories that you've shared at .
wouldn't it be nice to give back so that fu
ture generations can enjoy the ex
perience? John Post, who heads alumni
donations, wants us to remind all of you
that anyone who donates over $100 gets
the school emblem emblazoned 011 a com
memorative towel.
We're certainly excited about this re
union. Your reunion chairs. Katie Meyer
and Tun Gainesworth 111. are hard at
work ensuring this will be the best re
union ever! Hie opening festivities occur
011 Friday. when we will have a catered
lunch out by the old soccer fields. We'll
have a mixer with faculty members and
that cute girl you had a crush on in bio
class will show up with her husband
around 4:30. You'll leave shortly therc
a Iter.
We've rented out the local hotel to
continue the party into the night. The
prestigious Madison Hotel has been gra
cious enough (thanks. Jim *99!) to allow

us to use their ballroom for the evening.
Hveryone will hand you a eard that says
"consultant" but no one will be able to ex
plain what that means. We'll have light
cocktails and the headmaster will address
us on the importance of community Also,
we will be accepting checks or credit card,
if you feel like your trip down memory
lane loosens your purse strings. Really, no
pressure though. Perhaps you want to
give money in the name of your favorite
teacher, classmate, or just to spite that
smug member of 2001. Persons who do
nate over $500 get the school emblem 011
a commemorative keychain.
On Saturday, we invite all alums to
come watch our lacrosse team compete
against the hated Mountainville I.ions.
Come support your classmate, led Bax
ter. who is coaching our Blue Bears to vic
tory! lie's mellowed out a great deal in
the last live years, but still possesses that
competitive spirit we all love! We know
you and led had a querulous relationship,
but you really should let bygones be by
gones. I doubt he still remembers the

nickname he gave you.
Afterwards, there will be tour of the
new facilities on campus. has man
aged to purchase new pools, a new art
wing, and even an aquarium! Join Jean
Haight. who hasn't left the state in a
decade, as she shows you all the new
things has to offer! The class of
2001 is rumored to be donating money to
build a new fountain, and they've said
some pretty mean things about your
mother recently.
We know that many of you arc won
dering why you should be coming back to
the reunion. Perhaps you're busy with
your new job, or are traveling, or have
family obligations. But even if you are
still finishing up a degree in an impracti
cal subject and haven't secured a job, we
encourage you to drop by the reunion.
Evan Silverstein is working for Goldman
Sachs and has assured us that lie has sev
eral contacts in the business that would
be happy to hire a secretary with your
background in writing. You write little
humor essays, right?
If you absolutely can't attend, you can
still make your presence felt by sending in
this update form on your life. Your class
mates are curious as to what you've been
up to these past few years. Are you going
for a law degree (like Todd Hanson), ex
ploring Mayan ruins (you go Janice
Mendel!), or enrolled in medical school?
We want to know! If you've left no for-


Molt
Holt's Harangue
warding address and not notified
us of transferring colleges, this
would be a great time to let us
know. Hie class of 2001 has al
ready raised over $50,000 for
their alma mater, and I just know
that we can beat them! Go Blue!
Some brief class notes: Mary
Smith '02 and Ned van Ness "02
are tying the knot this June, in a
small ceremony (so don't tell
those who weren't invited, like
Chaz Bunker'o2). Sally Durning
just had a baby (congrats!), but is
still really sensitive about her fat
body. Our prom king. Nav Taylor,
is now a queen. We're very happy
for him in her new lifestyle. Gosh:
we all thought nerdy Steven
Phillips would grow up to be a
millionaire. But nope, he still
speaks Hlvish and lives with his
parents (and greetings to his ham
sters, "Linux", and "Kirk". Hey
little guys!) Gil Washington has
turned his hobby into a career,
and is now a hitman. Finally,
Henry Stackpole. Yuki Miyazaki

and Montgomery "Mail Dog"
Johnson finally dealt with their
superiority complexes. Now that
they've been accepted to their top
choice of business schools, they
really are superior! Congrats to
them!
Hie class of 2001 had nearly per
fect attendance at the reunion, and
they've donated nearly twice as
much as we have. Come on people,
you hated those assholes. Ok. we
didn't want to have to say this, but
the class of 2001 kidnapped our
children and our holding them ran
