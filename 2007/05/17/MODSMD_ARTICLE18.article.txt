## Transfers will be missed 
### DAVID LOUK 
I read with great dismay in the May 11
edition of Hie Daily that, amongst the in
coming class of new students for fall
2007. a mere 20 transfer students will be
among them. With an estimated 1.400
transfer students who applied, this is an
acceptance r.ite of 1.4%, or one third of
Yale I aw's.
As a former transfer student to Stan
ford (thankfully, a "massive" 70+ trans
fers were admitted my year) and transfer
community coordinator for 2005's New
Student Orientation, I cannot deny hav
ing a personal interest in this issue. Nev
ertheless. I believe the dwindling number
of transfer students admitted to Stanford
is harmful not just to the prospective

transfers who hope to make their aca
demic home at the Farm, but to the Uni
versity itself.
From my personal experience as a
transfer, befriending many fellow trans
fers. and witnessing countless others at
orientation and thereafter. I believe
transfers make a disproportionate contri
bution to the University. Many freshmen
arrive at Stanford burned out from the
overload of extracurricular activities and
service work that got them into the Uni
versity. As a result, many effectively opt
out from involvement in the University's
multitude of opportunities outside the
classroom during their four years on the
Farm. Although I hesitate to generalize. I
have found that transfers understand
how valuable their undergraduate cduca

lion is. and. having a precious few years at
Stanford, tend to jump right in and make
the most of their time.
More importantly, these students
bring a wealth of experience from their
time at other universities. Although I am
the lirst person to sing the praises of
Stanford to everyone I meet (and I'm not
exaggerating), aspects of the Stanford ex
perience can he improved, and transfers
have invaluable insight into areas where
it is perhaps not as strong as it could be.
Losing these unique voices affects the
university's abilitv to improve upon it
self.
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Julie I.ythcott-Haims has done
an admirable effort of including
transfer students in new student
programming, right down to em
phasizing the latter part of her
title in the responsibility Stanford
has id all its new students. Yet the
University sends a different mes
sage to prospective transfer stu
dents by admitting a mere 20 out
of 1.400 applicants.
Stanford has no transfer quota.
Instead, the I Jnivcrsity waits until
the prospective freshmen return
their acceptance letters and cal
culates exactly how main fresh
men will be arriving in the fall.
Thcn.thcN begin to admit transfer
students, il any free spots remain.
As a result, the transfer accept
ance rate varies from year to year
depending on the freshmen yield
(111 remember correctly, one year
fairly recently. Stanford accepted
no transfer students due to an un
expectedly high yield).
As a result of this policy, the
message Stanford sends to trans
fers is that thev are second-class

applicants, worthy of admission
only il enough prospective* fresh
men turn down the opportunity. I
can see no other way to construe
tlie admissions policy.
Ultimately. 1 believe this deci
sion hurts Stanford more than it
hurts the prospective transfer stu
dents win) aren't given the oppor
tunity to become part of the Car
dinal family. Iliey will no doubt
find other universities to attend
and contribute to.
In the race for the ever-impor
tant U.S. News and World Reports
ranking spots. I hope the admis
sions office remembers that al
though a high freshman yield and
low acceptance rate may make
the University sound good on
paper, it's the students them
selves— the freshmen as well as
the transfers — that give the Uni
versity the vibrancy, diversity and
quality that make it such an ap
pealing place to be. .Inst ask the
1,380 prospective transfers who
won't be lucky enough to experi
ence it.
