## Transfers will be missed 
### DAVID LOUK 
I read with great dismay in the May 11
edition of Hie Daily that, amongst the in
coming class of new students for fall
2007. a mere 20 transfer students will be
among them. With an estimated 1.400
transfer students who applied, this is an
acceptance r.ite of 1.4%, or one third of
Yale I aw's.
As a former transfer student to Stan
ford (thankfully, a "massive" 70+ trans
fers were admitted my year) and transfer
community coordinator for 2005's New
Student Orientation, I cannot deny hav
ing a personal interest in this issue. Nev
ertheless. I believe the dwindling number
of transfer students admitted to Stanford
is harmful not just to the prospective

transfers who hope to make their aca
demic home at the Farm, but to the Uni
versity itself.
From my personal experience as a
transfer, befriending many fellow trans
fers. and witnessing countless others at
orientation and thereafter. I believe
transfers make a disproportionate contri
bution to the University. Many freshmen
arrive at Stanford burned out from the
overload of extracurricular activities and
service work that got them into the Uni
versity. As a result, many effectively opt
out from involvement in the University's
multitude of opportunities outside the
classroom during their four years on the
Farm. Although I hesitate to generalize. I
have found that transfers understand
how valuable their undergraduate cduca

lion is. and. having a precious few years at
Stanford, tend to jump right in and make
the most of their time.
More importantly, these students
bring a wealth of experience from their
time at other universities. Although I am
the lirst person to sing the praises of
Stanford to everyone I meet (and I'm not
exaggerating), aspects of the Stanford ex
perience can he improved, and transfers
have invaluable insight into areas where
it is perhaps not as strong as it could be.
Losing these unique voices affects the
university's abilitv to improve upon it
self.
