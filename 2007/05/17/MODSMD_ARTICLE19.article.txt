## Ready for Regionals Pitchers' duel against Fresno State possible tonight 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 18 Stanford softball team
begins its postseason run against No.
23 Fresno State tonight at home, with
Smith Family Stadium a site for the
2(X)7 NCAA Regionals.
The Cardinal (33-19-1,7-13-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) is coming off a
disappointing season finale, losing
three straight to Oregon and Oregon
State. Still, despite this past week
end's letdown and the Cardinal's
seeding in a regional that includes
No. 3 LSU and scrappy underdog Cal
State-Northridge, Stanford head
coach John Rittman and his squad
believe that they are well-equipped
for their 10th consecutive NCAA ap
pearance.
"We're matched up in what might
be the toughest region this year when
you look at all of the teams, their
records and their accomplishments"
Rittman said. "But we're prepared.
We've been through the rigors of a
Pac-10 season, and we have a lot of
postseason experience."
That experience has given Stan
ford some measure of familiarity with
its first opponent. The Cardinal was
slated to play Fresno State (46-16) in
a March doubleheader, but the
games were washed out. However,
the team does know the Bulldogs
from last year's NCAA Regional,
hosted by Fresno.
"It's a little ironic because last
year they got rained out here during
the season and we went there for re
gionals; and this year we got rained
out there, and they come here for re
gionals." Rittman said.
Stanford beat Fresno 9-3 and 3-0
last spring to advance from the re
gional. after losing to the Bulldogs on
the second day of the double-elimi
nation round-robin.
The Cardinal can breathe a sigh of
relief, however, since it won't face
Fresno's former shortstop Christina
Clark this year. Clark, who graduated
last spring, hit .430 and led the Bull
dogs in every meaningful offensive
category for the 2005-2006 season.
However. Rittman believes that
Fresno is still a dangerous team.
"They may have lost [Clark] to
graduation, but thev are still a very ef

ficient offensive team." he said."And.
their pitcher is a year wiser and more
experienced."
That pitcher, sophomore Robin
Mackin, shutout Stanford as a post
season rookie last year, and she fol
lowed up that campaign with an im
pressive 35-9 record and 1.41 ERA
this season. Twelve of those victories
were shutouts.
Mackin is backed up in a big way
by the balanced offense Rittman
mentioned. While no one player's
numbers are as spectacular as Clark's
from last year, the Bulldogs' lineup

boasts five regulars who are hitting
.325 or better. Junior Jenna C'ervan
tez has hit 12 home runs to go with
her .370 average; junior Kristin
Sylvester (.366) and sophomore Mer
ryann Barr (.345) have and 42
RBI, respectively, to lead the team.
Stanford counters with a young
lineup that has been streaky, but can
certainly score runs. Freshman Alissa
Haber has settled nicely into the third
spot in the batting order, going 10-
for-17 with five RBI and four runs
scored over the last five games, and
team RBI leader junior Michelle

GAME NOTES: The Bulldogs visit Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium tonight with a 46-16
overall record and 15-3 record in the WAC.
Seven of their players are batting more than
300 and it is the team's 26th straight ap
pearance in the NCAA Tournament. Stan
ford (33-19-1, 7-13-1 Ptac-10) hosts one of
16 regionals this year. Also in the West Re
gional are Louisiana State (52-10) and Cal
State-Northridge (23-21 -1).

Smith has driven in seven runs in that
same period.
Pitching will likely be the begin
ning and the end of Stanford's post
season. When its pitching staff is on.
the Cardinal can beat anyone, as the
team showed in its 3-2 victory over
defending champions Arizona last
month.
The staff ace, sophomore Missy
Penna,certainly has the stuff — she is
23-11 with a 2.39 ERA and 276 strike
outs — but she has been alarmingly
wild in many of Stanford's losses this
season. Most recently, Penna walked
10 batters in her last 13 innings, and
hit five batters over the same period.
If she can curtail her walks and
stymie opposing offenses like she
consistently did just a few weeks ago,
the Cardinal could go far.
The winner of the double-elimina
tion Stanford regional will advance to
play against the winner of the
Brigham Young regional in one of the
eight Super Regionals taking place
next week.That round will be the last
step before the Women's College
World Series in Oklahoma City, May
31-June 6.

Right fielder Shannon Koplitz has a .283 batting average and eight doubles
this season. The freshman has yet to face Fresno State this year as a two-game
series between the teams was rained out earlier this season.
