# GSC reviews survey results
## COUNCIL EXCITED ABOUT DIVERSE RESPONSE RATE 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) discussed initial results of the
Graduate Student Life Survey —
which queried students on issues rang
ing from housing to academics to di
versity— at its meeting last night.
While full results will not be available
until the summer at the earliest, the
Council was pleased with how the ap
proximately 1,7(X) respondents repre
sented the graduate population.
According to survey coordinator
Hanna Muenke. survey respondents
included a "good balance between
men and women" and an "even split of
on- and off-campus students." Re
spondents also proportionately fol
lowed the distribution of students
across schools, with the highest num
ber of respondents coming from the
School of Engineering, which is home
to the plurality of graduate students.
The Council hoped this represen
tative data would yield crucial infor
mation about the concerns of an often
disconnected graduate student popu
lation, data that could then be used to
better tailor reforms and policies.

But it may be some time until the
results are made public.
"I need to do some of the cleaning
and get things sorted out," Muenke
said. "It's just a big data set with lots
of respondents."
ITie GSC also approved funding
for a Block Party that will be held at
various graduate residences on May
25. While the Council's budget for
2(X)7-2(X)8 includes a line item for next
year's Block Party, organizers mistak
enly assumed that the current budget
had also allocated funding for an
event this year, which it had not. The
motion to draw $2,(XX) from the Coun
cil's reserves passed by consensus.
Also, in a change to minutes from
last week's meeting. GSC Finance
Committee Chair Euan Robertson
clarified the state of the Council's ex
cess funds. While approximately
$ 10.CXX) still remains in the coffers,
Robertson added that the extra
money "is good for this time of year"
but reiterated his suggestion from last
week "to spend as much of it as possi
ble."
