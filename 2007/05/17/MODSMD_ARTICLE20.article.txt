# Golf enters NCAAs
## No. 2 Cardinal top seed in West Regional 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a disappointing fourth
place finish at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's golf team is looking to
step up its game at the NCAA West
Regional,today through Saturday in
Tempe, Ariz.
The Cardinal snagged the covet
ed top seed in the tournament, fol
lowed in order by UCLA, UNLV,
Southern California and East Ten
nessee State to round out the top
five.
"We feel really good going into
the NCAAs," Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray '97 said. "I would've
liked to have finished higher at the
Pac-lOs, but we just didn't play Eu
gene Country Club very well this
year."
The Cardinal takes on a com
plete field of 27 teams — nine of
those are among the nation's top 25
— and six individuals at the Karsten
Golf Course this weekend. The 10
top-scoring teams and the top two
individuals not among those teams
will go on to compete in the 2007
NCAA Championships, which will
be held May 30-June 2 at Golden
Horseshoe Golf Club in Williams
burg, Va.
The Stanford golfers and Ray
have repeatedly said that competing
well in the NCAAs is a primary goal
for the team and a culmination of
what they have been working for all
season. And at the regional, the Car
dinal will be relying on the confi
dence it has gained in a thoroughly
successful season.
Stanford has finished in the top
five at all 11 of its events this season,
earning an astounding six tourna
ment titles — at the Gopher Invita
tional. Prestige at PGA West.Corde
Valle Classic, UH-Hilo Invitational,
Ashworth Collegiate and U.S. Inter
collegiate. The Cardinal's latest win
(in the U.S Intercollegiate) was here
at the Farm. Stanford's six team vic
tories is the most since the Tiger
Woods era of the mid '90s.
Iliree Stanford golfers have also
won individual titles this year: senior

Zack Miller (at the Gopher Invita
tional and the Prestige), junior Rob
Grube (CordeValle Classic and U.S.
Intercollegiate) and freshman
Joseph Bramlett (Puerto Rico Clas
sic).
In addition, each of the team's
golfers has competed in an event
this year, making Stanford one of
the deepest squads in the country —
a definite advantage for the
NCAAs.
The Cardinal golfers have also
received many Pac-10 honors as of
late. Senior Matt Savage. Miller and
Grube all made the cut for the first
team All Pac-10 selection. Bramlett
was chosen for the second team,
while sophomore Daniel Lim re
ceived an honorable mention.
Four of these golfers have also
made the Stanford record books for
season-low stroke average. Savage is
tied for third with Woods (his 1995
season) with 71.3, followed by
Grube, who is tied for fifth with 71.4.
Bramlett is in seventh with 71.5, and
Miller is tied for ninth with 71.8.
And. as a result of his hard work

GAME NOTES. Twenty-seven teams and six in
dividuals will play in the desert heat, today
through Saturday. No. 2 Stanford leads the
field as the top seed and is followed by
UCLA, UNLV, Southern California and East
Tennessee State. Host Arizona State is the
seventh seed. The top 10 teams and two in
dividuals not on those teams will advance to
the NCAA Championships. Stanford finished
14th at last year's regionals in Arizona with
an 860 (-4) in three rounds.
this season, Ray was selected as the
Pac-10 Coach of the Year. In just his
third year at the helm. Ray has
helped turn the Stanford golf pro
gram around, and he now hopes that
the NCA As will be a suitable conclu
sion for a successful year.
"The guys feel really good about
the tournaments that we've had so
far and how we stack up against Pac
-10 and regional competition," Ray
said. "Everyone is committed to han
dling our business, controlling our
own game and the results will hap

pen as they should this week."
The individual golfers are also
confident in their abilities going into
today's first round. Savage claimed
that there is a certain amount of pres
sure, as well as excitement,going into
the last NCAA regional of his Stan
ford career.
"We had a real solid practice
round." Savage said. "We all played
well and each guy is feeling good
about his game. The season's been
awesome so far. It proved to us that we
can play with anyone in the nation."

"But now is when the tourna
ments begin to matter," he contin
ued. "We like to be the team to beat.
There is pressure to perform, but I
think we all look at it as a motivator,
not something to be nervous about.
We are all really excited to play to
morrow and hopefully bring home
the win."
The Cardinal tees off with UCLA
and UNLA at 11 a.m. today.
