# Toby Gerhart Stanford Baseball
## Double Time 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
For Toby Gerhart, the learning curve has been
steep. The freshman outfielder is the latest in a
long line of Stanford two-sport athletes, splitting
his time between the diamond and the gridiron.
And in his first year playing for the Cardinal, perhaps
the toughest task for Gerhart has been dealing with disap
pointing seasons in both sports.
Stanford's 1-11 football record was disastrous enough

to spell the end of Walt Harris' tenure at the helm of the
program after just his second year. And unless Cardinal
baseball can finish out its season with a record of at least
6-1 down the stretch, the team will finish just its second
losing season in the 30 years since head coach Mark Mar
quess "69 took over the program.
Gerhart knows it's been a rough start to his collegiate
career, but.nevertheless, he has faith that he and his team
mates can grow and learn from their trials this year.
"I think we have a lot to learn from both these years —
football and baseball," he said. "Maybe I'm just bad luck.

1 don't know. That's what I think it might be right now. I
think I've lost more games here than 1 did in my whole ca
reer for high school.
"We've had to overcome a lot of adversity for both
sports, and like coach Marquess said the other day. you
can't get in the habit of losing." Gerhart continued.
"When things don't go right, it's easy to just kind of give
up. And I think, really, both teams have not let that hap
pen. have been working really hard to get better each
week — even if the results haven't shown that. And next
year should be a lot different, for both sports."

Ihat positive, competitive outlook is a big
part of what led Gerhart to Stanford. ITie
Norco, Calif.-native knew he wanted to be a
two-sport college athlete, and Stanford has
had many.
As a testament to the Cardinal's flexibility,
Gerhart wears No. 7 in football, the same
number as Stanford's most famous double
threat athlete. John Hlwav.
"That's one thing, right from the get-go
when 1 was being recruited by schools, was the
ability to pla\ two sports." Gerhart said. "Stan
ford had a huge history of it. Coach Marquess
did it himself; lie's had many players do it for
him. so he's had a lot of experience with it.
Other schools, they said Yes. we can do it.' but
there wasn't that connection or history of it. so
that definitely helped with Stanford."
Marquess believes his freshman outfielder
measures up well against the Cardinal's repu
tation.
And he should know. The veteran coach,
who has twice led his teams to College World
Series Championships, played both football
and baseball at Stanford in the late l%os.

"I think he stacks up well as a two-sport
athlete, and we've had some great ones here."
Marquess said. "He's a legitimate college
baseball player, a legitimate pro-draft player.
1 le played a lot of football as a freshman in a
tough situation. The football people are very
happy with him. and they should be. And
we're very happy with him."
Despite his tremendous athleticism and a

"If he wasn't competitive, he'd be
lifting weights and taking it easy in
football and relaxing. But he wasn't made
that way''

competitive streak that drew raves from his
coach. Gerhart's first season of Cardinal base
ball has been marred somewhat by injury.
The true-freshman broke his arm during a
February series against Texas and claims that
only recently has he gotten back to where he
was prior to the break. Coupled with the
stresses of spring football practice, where Ger
hart was expected to learn a new offensive sys

tem under head coach Jim Harbuagh.the past
few months have been busy, to say the least.
But the speedy outfielder and offensive
power back has, nevertheless, shown signs of
positive things to come.
In late April, during a three-game set
against defending national champion Oregon
State, Gerhart scored four runs on five hits. He
has scored 12 of his 16 runs on the year since
Apr. 24. And while Gerhart hasn't had many
opportunities this year, he is a perfect 3-3 on
steal attempts and has shown a lot of speed on
the basepaths.
Still, overall, the true-freshman clearly ex
pects a lot of himself, and he isn't satisfied yet.
"I think I'm doing alright—just alright,"
Gerhart said."Nothing special. It's been tough
because at the beginning of the season I was
just starting to get back into it. starting to feel
comfortable, and then 1 break my arm. I've
been back three or four weeks now.so I'm just
starting to feel comfortable again, and the sea
son's almost over. It's been tough to get into a
groove and get going."
Marquess was not surprised by his first

year player's high expectations.
"He's probably disappointed," Marquess
said."He thinks he can do a lot better, but con
sidering the time he's been out. he's getting
better, and he's getting more comfortable with
his swing. He's learning, but that set him back
quite a bit. He's picked it up and he's playing
better each game."
For both sports in which Gerhart competes
for the Cardinal, his continued emergence as a
player will be a much-welcomed develop
ment. But with the freshman's work ethic and
spirited attitude on the field. Marquess is con
fident in his potential.
"1 think the key ingredient to whatever
two-sport athlete you have is the thing that
he'll bring to it," Marquess said." Because, if he
wasn't competitive, he'd be lifting weights and
taking it easy in football and relaxing. But he
wasn't made that way. I think he's wired to
compete."
Two branches of the Stanford athletic de
partment certainly hope he's right.
