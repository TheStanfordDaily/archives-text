# Toby Gerhart Stanford Baseball
## Double Time 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
For Toby Gerhart, the learning curve has been
steep. The freshman outfielder is the latest in a
long line of Stanford two-sport athletes, splitting
his time between the diamond and the gridiron.
And in his first year playing for the Cardinal, perhaps
the toughest task for Gerhart has been dealing with disap
pointing seasons in both sports.
Stanford's 1-11 football record was disastrous enough

to spell the end of Walt Harris' tenure at the helm of the
program after just his second year. And unless Cardinal
baseball can finish out its season with a record of at least
6-1 down the stretch, the team will finish just its second
losing season in the 30 years since head coach Mark Mar
quess "69 took over the program.
Gerhart knows it's been a rough start to his collegiate
career, but.nevertheless, he has faith that he and his team
mates can grow and learn from their trials this year.
"I think we have a lot to learn from both these years —
football and baseball," he said. "Maybe I'm just bad luck.

1 don't know. That's what I think it might be right now. I
think I've lost more games here than 1 did in my whole ca
reer for high school.
"We've had to overcome a lot of adversity for both
sports, and like coach Marquess said the other day. you
can't get in the habit of losing." Gerhart continued.
"When things don't go right, it's easy to just kind of give
up. And I think, really, both teams have not let that hap
pen. have been working really hard to get better each
week — even if the results haven't shown that. And next
year should be a lot different, for both sports."
