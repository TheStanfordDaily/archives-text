Arrillaga Plaza.
The Bears and the Cardinal compete in 26
sports, with points for the trophy awarded for
every match between the rivals. With 135 points
at stake, 70 points are needed to win.The format
is similar to another Lexus Gauntlet competi
tion between UCLA and Southern California.
(The Bruins clinched the title in April.)
Departing quarterback Trent Edwards will
also be honored at Monday's ceremony with a
scholarship for sportsmanship.
