Despite some struggles as a team
this season, the Stanford men's ten
nis team earned Pac-1() honors this
week. Sophomore Matt Bruch and
freshman Richard Wire were named
to the Second-Team All-Pac-10
Conference on Wednesday.
Bruch earned the honors for the
second straight year. He recently
won his second straight league sin
gles title as well. He will play in sin
gles competition at the NCAA
Championships next week in
Athens, Georgia.
The sophomore star suffered in
juries this season hut Wire was there
to fill in at No. 1. Wire closed out
many key wins and was only one of
two freshman to have all conference
honors.

Junior Rob Grube was a First Team All-Pac-10 selection this season. He is one of three Cardinal golfers who have won
a tournament title this year, a sign of the Stanford team's depth.
