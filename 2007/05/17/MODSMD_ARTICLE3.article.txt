## Nobels take on D.C. in fight for funding Prize winners argue for more fed. research money

James Stewart wasn't the only
outsider to take Washington, D.C.
by storm.
Prof. Roger Kornberg and Prof.
Andrew Fire, who both won the
Nobel Prize last year, "went to
Washington" earlier this month.
Their mission: get more congres
sional support for science research.
On May 2. Kornberg — a struc
tural biologist who won the Nobel
for chemistry — and Fire — a

met with the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transporta
tion to lobby for federal money. The
pair was joined by last year's other
American Nobel Prize winners in

'ITiis month's hearing comes at a

Pryor (D-AR). a committee mem

Health (NIH) budget doubled be

tween 1999 and
2003 hut has since remained flat.
"There is a simple answer to
[funding problems scientists face],"
Kornberg told the committee. "Re
store what is lost and then maintain
a steady and reliable budget after
that time. That will create a climate
of reliability so researchers are not
afraid their grants will get cut."
He added that under current
constraints on the NIH budget —
the largest funding source for basic
scientific research in the country —
virtually none of the work done by
the six Nobel Prize winners could
have been funded.
kronberg said he supported in
creasing the NIH budget.
"We are asking for a tiny fraction
of the money spent in Iraq," he told
The Daily after the meeting. "We
