## Nobels take on D.C. in fight for funding Prize winners argue for more fed. research money 
### SCOTT BOLKAN 
James Stewart wasn't the only
outsider to take Washington, D.C.
by storm.
Prof. Roger Kornberg and Prof.
Andrew Fire, who both won the
Nobel Prize last year, "went to
Washington" earlier this month.
Their mission: get more congres
sional support for science research.
On May 2. Kornberg — a struc
tural biologist who won the Nobel
for chemistry — and Fire — a
pathologist and geneticist who won
the Nobel for medical research
met with the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transporta
tion to lobby for federal money. The
pair was joined by last year's other
American Nobel Prize winners in
the sciences.
'ITiis month's hearing comes at a
time when federal funding for scien
tific research is dramatically lower
than in recent years. Senator Mark
Pryor (D-AR). a committee mem
ber, said the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) budget doubled be

tween 1999 and
2003 hut has since remained flat.
"There is a simple answer to
[funding problems scientists face],"
Kornberg told the committee. "Re
store what is lost and then maintain
a steady and reliable budget after
that time. That will create a climate
of reliability so researchers are not
afraid their grants will get cut."
He added that under current
constraints on the NIH budget —
the largest funding source for basic
scientific research in the country —
virtually none of the work done by
the six Nobel Prize winners could
have been funded.
kronberg said he supported in
creasing the NIH budget.
"We are asking for a tiny fraction
of the money spent in Iraq," he told
The Daily after the meeting. "We


Kornberg


Fire
spend 300 million dollars a day in
Iraq. What we are talking is plus-or
minus one day's expenditure in
Iraq. It will make all the difference."
In his written testimony. Rom
berg explained how minor reduc
tions in funding can have dispro
portionate effects on basic scientif
ic research. When funding drops,
Romberg said, research scientists
are discouraged from taking risks
because of the danger of losing the
grant money that is vital to sustain
ing their research.
The Senate committee members
largely said they agreed with the
scientists' sentiments. A week be
fore the hearing, the Senate passed
the America Competes Act — a
measure aimed at increasing Amer
ican investment in scientific re
search and improving education in
math, science and engineering.
"Across the aisle there is pretty
much general agreement on the
value of science," Fire told THe

Daily, "but the question is how to
find resources for basic research
under current restraints."
Romberg stressed the impor
tance of government funding as a
complement to private donations.
1 le said the private sector plays a
vital role in the development of ap
plied science but that private
donors cannot invest in basic re
search. which would force them to
take on long-term ventures involv
ing considerable risk, Romberg said
only the government can fill this
role.
Pryor. the senator, wondered
how much ethical concerns in scien
tific research — such as environ
mental risks and stem cell research
— combined with congressional
and executive-imposed limits affect
scientists.
"There have to be limits on re
search." Fire responded. "Ihere are
societal rules that have to be fol
lowed and made at a governmental
level. Scientists must work within
these limits and constraints of soci
ety."
