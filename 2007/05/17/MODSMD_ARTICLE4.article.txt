## Bavarian minister pitches green tech. Top Calif. energy official says U.S. lags behind 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
Bavaria's state economic minis
ter told a crowd of more than 100
local businessmen and academics
gathered in the Faculty Club last
night that California and Bavaria
should work together to develop
the alternative energies of the fu
ture.
"If we can succeed in networking
our technological skills even more
effectively, this can only be to our
advantage," said the minister,
Erwin Huber. "We will make our
energy supply more sustainable. We
will make our companies strong for
facing up to the new competitors in
India and China. We will secure
promising jobs."
An hour-and-a-half panel dis
cussion with eight business leaders
last night was the highlight of
Huber's two-day swing through
the Bay Area. The minister talked
with Bavarian and American busi

nesspersons about greater techno
logical exchanges and about sup
porting more "green" technolo
gies.
Bavaria, Germany's largest and
southernmost state, is home to
Bavarian Motor Works — better
known as BMW. The company has
developed a prototype of its yet-to
be-released Hydrogen 7 model, a
car that company spokesmen said
will revolutionize hybrid vehicles.
For almost two hours before the
panel began, attendees could test
drive the car in the area around
Tresidder Union.
John Geesman, the commission
er of the California Energy Com
mission, said that America is play
ing "catch up" with Bavaria on
clean energy, lie said that good tax
incentives and regulatory polices
are conducive to alternative fuels.
"They've perfected a linkage be
tween their energy system and
economy," Geesman told The Daily.
"They've got some excellent ideas."
The region, which is not en
dowed with natural energy re
serves, developed nuclear power
during the Cold War. According to
Huber. 83 percent of Bavaria's
electricity supply is produced with
out carbon dioxide.
"Research is very expensive,"
lluber said in an interview before
the event."To make networks in re

search that make exchanges of ex
perience and technology is useful
for both of us."
After the talk, the minister
rushed to make a late flight to
Washington. DC., where he has
meetings today. Hut most visitors
— many speaking in German —
sipped on German beer and talked
about the relationship between the
two regions.
