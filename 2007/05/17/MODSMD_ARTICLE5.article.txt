## Tobacco vote today Family Senate to debate controversial funding 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Faculty Senate will vote
today on a controversial resolution
that would bar tobacco companies
from funding University-spon
sored research projects.
The resolution — which was in

troduced by Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bernd Girod at the Senate's
Apr. 1 ( ) meeting — proposes that
"Stanford University will not enter
into sponsored research agree
ments with companies that make or
market tobacco products."
Faculty and administrators
butted heads over the issue at their
meeting last month, as opponents
argued that prohibiting tobacco
funded research could lead to a
slippery slope for the banning of
more research. Proponents of the
measure said that the University
has a moral obligation to disassoci
ate itself from the tobacco indus
try. which they said manipulates
University research for its own
ends.

The resolution's supporters in
clude Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo and Law Prof. Hank Greely
'74, one of the proposal's co-sign
ers. Opponents include President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy.
Hennessy decried the resolu
tion. calling it "a political mes
sage." while Medical School Dean
Philip Pizzo said that he supported
the proposal on ethical grounds.
The Faculty Senate will convene
at 3:15 this afternoon in room ISO
of the I.aw School.
