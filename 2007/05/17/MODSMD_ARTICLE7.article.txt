## New rules help score top rating October restrictions on access by drug reps. helps bolster "A" grade 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
The School of Medicine has received top hon
ors in a national survey that evaluates schools
based on their regulations that protect against
conflicts of interest in their interactions with phar
maceutical companies. Stanford earned an "A" in
the survey, sharing the top spot with five other
graduate programs.
UC-Davis. the University of Pennsylvania.
Yale, the University of Michigan and the Univer
sity of Vermont also garnered top scores in the
"PharmFree Scorecard." The results were re
leased last week by the American Medical School
Association (AMSA).the largest medical student
group in the United States.
Stanford's high score may in part be due to
stricter regulations implemented at the Medical
School last October under the Stanford Industry
Interactions Policy.
According to Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo. medical school interactions with the phar
maceutical industry can be contaminated by gifts,
monetary incentives and marketing strategies that
blur the boundary between academia and indus
try.
The Industry Interactions Policy mandates
tighter restrictions on interactions between Med
ical School affiliates and pharmaceutical compa
nies. Industry representatives — especially sales
persons— are barred from patient areas.
The new regulations also ban personnel from
accepting gifts from drug companies. According to
a survey published by the New England Journal of
Medicine last month, almost 95 percent of Ameri
can doctors accept gifts from the drug industry.
The policy also restricts educational events spon
sored by pharmaceutical companies. It further man
dates the disclosure of relationships with the phar
maceutical industry, as well as the training of stu
dents and staff about potential conflicts of interest
arising from interactions with the industry.
The group, which had an intern
compile the data in September and
October of last year, plans to com
plete the survey again in the fall.
"It is important that we work to
keep our medical schools and

teaching hospitals free of the influ
ence of pharmaceutical compa
nies," said AMSA National Presi
dent Jay Bhatt in a news release.
"PharmFree medical students he
come PharmFree doctors and that
commitment to evidence-based
medicine benefits our patients and
our colleagues."
