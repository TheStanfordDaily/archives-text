## Tobacco funding ban fails Faculty Senate votes 21 to 10 against restrictions on research 
### NICK PARKER MANAGING EDITOR 
A divided Faculty Senate voted 21-10 yester
day against a controversial resolution that would
have banned tobacco companies from funding
University-sponsored research projects.
The measure — which proposed that "Stan
ford University will not enter into sponsored re
search agreements with companies that make or
market tobacco products" — pitted faculty and
administrators against one another at yesterday's
meeting.
Proponents of the resolution argued that the
University had a moral responsibility to dissoci
ate itself from the tobacco industry, which they
said manipulates University research for its own
ends.
"This research is very effectively used by the

tobacco industry to increase the rate of smoking."
said Pathology and Genetics Prof. Andrew Fire
who won the Nobel Prize last year.
By sponsoring tobacco-funded research.
Drama and Classics Prof. Rush Rehm Ph.D.'Bs
argued, the University is providing "a legitimiza
tion of an industry that is spreading death and dis
ease throughout the world "
The resolution's opponents, however, said
they believed that barring tobacco companies
from funding University-sponsored research
would lead to a "slippery slope" for further re
search bans and would infringe upon academic
freedom.
"I believe quite firmly that this funding ban is
not about research, but about issues of academ
ic freedom," said Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. *82.
President John Hennessy said he opposed the
resolution on the grounds that its passage would
have a negative impact on academic freedom.
By supporting the measure. Hennessy told the
Senate, "you would undercut the ability of the
Provost and myself to support your rights to aca

demic freedom."
The president cited the US. Departments of
Energy and Defense, as well as energy giants BP
and Exxon-Mobil — all of which provide large
amounts of funding to the University — as po
tential sources of funding that could he affected
by the precedent set in prohibiting tobacco-fund
ed research.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Jeffrey Koseff M.S. '78 reminded senators that
outside sources provide the bulk of funding for
University-sponsored research projects.
"To suggest that one's freedom to do research
is not going to be hindered by limiting potential
outside sources of funding is simply wrong he
said.
Law Prof. Hank Greely '74. a staunch support
er and co-signer of the resolution, said that the
University's moral obligation to divorce itself
from tobacco companies should trump any
threats to academic freedom, which he said have
not arisen at other institutions that have banned
tobacco-funded research.
"The tobacco industry has
caused, is causing and will continue
to cause incredible human carnage
around the world." Greely said. "We
should not help them. We should do
the right thing."
Greely cited a number of institu
tions — such as the medical schools
at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the Uni
versity of Arizona and The Ohio
State University — as examples of

places where the prohibition of to
bacco industry funding has not led to
further bans on other sources of
funding. Stanford would have been
the first institution to initiate a Uni
versity-wide ban on tobacco money.
In the end. however, the resolu
tion's opponents had their way, as
the measure was defeated in a deci
sive yet divided vote.
"I felt very strongly that a change
in the policy would undermine aca
demic freedom," 1 lennessy said after
the meeting. "There are a few things
we protect above all else at this Uni
versity and those include academic
freedom arid freedom of expression.
The minute you infringe upon those.

you can run into trouble."
"I think tobacco companies are
evil and filled with bad people," he
added, "but I think you have to
worry about academic freedom un
raveling."
For his part, Cireely expressed
chagrin after the meeting, but he did
recognize a silver lining in the reso
lution's failure.
"1 was disappointed," he said,
"but 1 wasn't surprised. I'm glad we
had this discussion. I hope it pushes
forward discussion among the facul
ty about morality."
