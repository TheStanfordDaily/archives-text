## Burbank preps for frosh crop 
### MHANCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Come September, Burbank will join Larkin
and Donner as the newest all-freshman residence
in Stern Hall. As a result of a record-high matricu
lation rate for incoming freshman — 70.8 percent
of admitted students chose to enroll for next year
— the University has had to make some last
minute housing rearrangements before the upper
classmen housing draw comes to a close.
Last week. Residential and Dining Enterprises,
in collaboration with the Offices of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and the Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education, decided that con
verting Burbank to an all-freshman dorm was the
best plan to accommodate for the thirty to forty
extra freshmen next year.
According to Executive Director of Student
Housing and Chief 1 lousing Officer Rodger Whit
ney, the University already had long-term plans to
create more all-freshmen dorms in Stern and
Wilbur in the future, making this a welcome
change. Because it is traditionally unpopular with
upperclassmen in the draw. Burbank was the most
natural choice for conversion.
"Only about 70 percent of freshmen who re
quest assignments to an all-frosh house can be ac
commodated within the existing configuration of
four-class and all-frosh houses," Whitney said in an
email."Adding an all-frosh house will increase the
chances of incoming freshmen receiving their pre
ferred housing choices."

In addition to Burbank's shift from a four-class
dorm. Kimball 1 {all will now house all transfer stu
dents. Due to the unexpectedly large number of in
coming freshmen, the University decreased the
number of transfers this year from 60 to 20 stu
dents, and placing all transfers in one house will fa
cilitate and foster the development of this small
group on campus.
"The consolidation of all transfer students in
Kimball Hall should support the opportunity to
develop a strong sense of community among
transfer students," said Director of Housing As
signment Sue Nunan in an email. "[lt] should en
hance their housing experience and ability to bond
with their peers."
Currently-enrolled students will be affected by
the housing changes as well.'l wain and Soto, which
housed transfers in the past, will become tradition
al four-class dorms. Roth House, which will be
closed for renovations in the fall, will reopen win
ter quarter. Vacancies will be created in the winter
with the openings of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram in Madrid and the renovated housing facili
ty at the Stanford in Washington program.
"The increase in yield reflects positively on
Stanford's reputation among high school seniors."
Whitney said. "Freshman transfer students and
continuing upperclass students should all benefit
from the changes we are making in student hous
ing in response to the increased freshman yield."
