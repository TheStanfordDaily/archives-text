## Thefts plague natl. science buildings Latest burglary prompts heightened University response 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Early Sunday morning, an improvised security
camera set up by graduate students working in
the Hansen Experimental Physics Lab (HEPL)
captured the image of a thief who may be con
nected to the string of burglaries that have taken
place in a cluster of natural sciences buildings
nearby. The video prompted Francisco LePort. a
fourth-year graduate student in physics, to distrib
ute an open letter calling for President Hennessy
to tighten security at HEPL.
The video showed an unknown man in the
doorway of Prof. Mark Kasevich's lab in HEPL's
End Station 111. which was shrouded by a plastic
sheet to keep out dust. With his body obscured by
the plastic, the thief put on a construction work
er's helmet, shrouded his face and then walked
into the lab. where he tilted the camera towards
the ceiling and proceeded to steal valuable elec
tronics testing equipment.
This theft, the latest in a string of burglaries,
prompted LePort. who also works in End Station
111, to call for action.
"In my opinion, the University is not doing
enough to protect us." reads one paragraph of the
letter, which was also distributed over physics-re
lated lists. "At least eight thefts have occurred in
the past several months.'lTiere are probably many
more 1 am not aware of. Consider the possibility
that one of us runs into this thief the next time he
visits one of our buildings. The consequences
could be fatal."
LePort's petition arose from concerns he had
about his personal safety.
"I work in that building daily. All of April we
were running 24 houv shifts, and I was there
overnight." he told The Daily. "At one
point I was there when an actual theft
occurred. 1 was sitting on the tloor
right above when the guy comes
down, breaks in and does whatever
he's doing. I'm lucky that I didn't go
down and check on some sort of in
strument."
LePort claimed that the Universi
ty's visible response to the thefts has
been minimal.
"The response I've seen consists of
promoting intelligence about the
thetts, making sure that doors are
locked and nothing is propped open
over the weekend," he said. "For
about a week, a security guard was
roaming the physics department after
one of" the thefts, but that's about it.
That security guard has since disap
peared."
As ol Wednesday, LePort had not
received a reply from the President,
though he did get reassurances from
the Chief of Police and the Office of
Risk Management.
"They've assured me and I'm sure
it's true, that statistically speaking, if
the guy runs into people he's not
going to hurt anyone and that the
chances of running into him are pret
ty low," he said. "I le seems to avoid
people and come when no one's
around. But 1 don't want to bet any
thing."
Jeff Wachtel,senior assistant to the
President, explained that the Univer
sity has been taking the case seriously,
though he refused to speak in
specifics in order to avoid jeopardiz
ing the ongoing investigation.
"We're taking the steps very seri
ously.The Department of Public Safe

ty has been conducting an investiga
tion and there is enhanced monitoring
of the building," he said. "The safety of
our students is our first priority."
Michael Killian, facilities manager
for 11EPL,estimated for the Palo Alto
Daily News' May 16 article on the
thefts that the facility has lost
$4(X),(XX) worth of equipment in at
least eight break-ins since September.
TTie objects taken tend to be scientific
equipment, such as spectrum analyz
ers, oscilloscopes and voltmeters,
which can be used in a variety of elec
trical endeavors. When contacted by
Ihe Daily on May 17 for further com
ment, Killian said that he has been
asked by University administrators
not to discuss the thefts with any
members of the press.
In addition to the thefts at HEPL,
the Stanford University Department
of Public Safety's Public Bulletin
recorded six burglaries at Ginzton
Labs, five at the Durand Building,
three at the Gilbert Biological Sci
ences Building, three at Herrin Labs,
two at the Varian Physics Building
and two at the Mudd Chemistry
Building since Feb. 13. Although some
of these burglaries focused on laptops
and personal items, scientific equip
ment was also taken from all of the
buildings.
Citing the ongoing investigation,
the Stanford police department re
fused to comment on the thefts.
To report any suspicious activity in
the building, immediately call 91 1 (9-
911 from a University phone or (650)
329-2413 from a cell phone).To report
information about the thefts or other
helpful information, contact Detec
tive Mark Trueblood from SUDPS at
