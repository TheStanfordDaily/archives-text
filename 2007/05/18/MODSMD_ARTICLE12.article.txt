## Thefts plague natl. science buildings Latest burglary prompts heightened University response 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Early Sunday morning, an improvised security
camera set up by graduate students working in
the Hansen Experimental Physics Lab (HEPL)
captured the image of a thief who may be con
nected to the string of burglaries that have taken
place in a cluster of natural sciences buildings
nearby. The video prompted Francisco LePort. a
fourth-year graduate student in physics, to distrib
ute an open letter calling for President Hennessy
to tighten security at HEPL.
The video showed an unknown man in the
doorway of Prof. Mark Kasevich's lab in HEPL's
End Station 111. which was shrouded by a plastic
sheet to keep out dust. With his body obscured by
the plastic, the thief put on a construction work
er's helmet, shrouded his face and then walked
into the lab. where he tilted the camera towards
the ceiling and proceeded to steal valuable elec
tronics testing equipment.
This theft, the latest in a string of burglaries,
prompted LePort. who also works in End Station
111, to call for action.
"In my opinion, the University is not doing
enough to protect us." reads one paragraph of the
letter, which was also distributed over physics-re
lated lists. "At least eight thefts have occurred in
the past several months.'lTiere are probably many
more 1 am not aware of. Consider the possibility
that one of us runs into this thief the next time he
visits one of our buildings. The consequences
could be fatal."
LePort's petition arose from concerns he had
about his personal safety.
"I work in that building daily. All of April we
were running 24 houv shifts, and I was there
