### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Diana Clough 07 was not sup
posed to be commissioned as a lieu
tenant in the U.S. Army until next
month.
But then Lt.Col.Shari L.Corbett,
the commander of Santa Clara Uni
versity's Reserve Officers' Training
Corp (ROTC) detachment, received
a phone call asking if Clough could
make it to Washington. D.C. for a
Thursday ceremony at the White
I louse with the president.
Less than 10 hours later, Clough
was on a red-eye flight from San
Francisco to Washington.
Yesterday, in an elegant East
Room ceremony. President George
W. Bush welcomed her and Secretary
of Defense Robert Gates swore her
in as an officer in the world's most
powerful military force.
"Seeing the president walking
down the hallway toward us was just

amazing," Clough said. "Everyone
probably felt like they were going to
faint. It was cool to be within arm's
reach."
While many of her classmates
prepare for office jobs or graduate
school, Clough is preparing to take
command of troops in the field. After
winning a four-year scholarship her
senior year of high school, the inter
national relations major has under
gone extensive training and proven
herself ready to serve.
"She's very forward thinking, but
you should never Teed her candy be
cause she's full of energy." said Cor
bett, Clough's commanding officer.
"She's peppy all the time. We ask that
people not feed her candy before 7
a.m."
The president commended the
Clough and the other participating
students for their hard work during
his speech at the event.
"When your roommates slept in,
you got up at dawn for a three-mile

run."he said. "While others spread
out on the grass on a sunny day. you
marched in formation. And when
your friends called it a night and
headed out to the town, you stayed
back to shine your shoes and iron
your uniform in preparation for the
next day's inspection."
"I felt like he was talking about
me the entire time, which is really in
sane," Clough said."The speechwrit

ers and the people who do the fact
checking called. The fact finders
asked us if we get credit and com
mute to the school."
Speaking from the family's Re
ston. Va. home — in the outskirts of
the nation's capitol — mother Bren
da Clough said that the highlight of
the ceremony was when she got

President George W. Bush welcomes top ROTC cadets at a White House
ceremony in the East Room yesterday afternoon. To the left of Bush is a
smiling Lt. Diana Clough '07, who will be deployed to Germany as an MR
kissed on the cheek by President
Bush.
"1 was sitting in the front row, and
after he gave his speech, he shook all
the hands around and then gave me a
kiss and said you must be very
proud." dough said.
Since Stanford bans ROTC de
tachments on campus, Clough has
commuted to Santa Clara several
times a week for four years. She be
came battalion executive officer at
Santa Clara,graduated from airborne
and air assault training programs and
won top rankings for marksmanship
and physical prowess.
This year, about 4,(XX) graduating
college seniors will commission into
the Army. Clough's decorated service
record and strong performanee in
drills places her among the top 50
cadets in the country, according to
Corbett.
She wanted to serve in the in
fantry, but by law women are still not
allowed to serve in front-line combat
roles. (Men make up 78 percent of her
Santa Clara detachment.) So she took
the next best thing, which will still
allow her to stay close to the action:
She will become a military policeman.
About 50 Navy midshipmen and
Army cadets were sworn in yesterday
afternoon. Clough represented Cali
fornia.
Many of the cadets, including Clough.

were still in high school on Sept. 11.
2001.
"We chose to serve when the U.S.
was already at war." Clough said.'it's
different than Vietnam when people
were conscripted. Our generation
knows they'll be deployed, and they
chose to serve."
Clough will be the only current
member of her family to serve in the
military. Her mom acknowledges
she's a little frightened that her
daughter has signed up for military
service in wartime, but she said she
was extraordinarily proud of how se
riously she takes her commitment.
"She can do things you see in
movies," said Brenda Clough. "She
can do very James Bond-y things like
parachute or repel out of helicopters
while carrying a rife. It's very frighten
ing."
Clough will report for duty on
June 20, three days after receiving her
Stanford diploma. She will train at
Fort Lewis in the state of Washington.
From there, she is slated for deploy
ment to Kaiserslautern, Germany
which the troops call "K-town" —
home to the 21st theater support
command.
Hie ROTC's four-year, full tuition
scholarship and monthly stipend re
quire a commitment to serve for four
years after graduation.
"For most of you, an ROTC schol

arship helped pay for your college ed
ucation," Bush told the group of
cadets at yesterday's ceremony. "The
American people provide these funds
willingly. And in return they ask one
thing — when their sons and daugh
ters are put in harm's way, they will be
led by officers of character and in
tegrity"
But Clough hopes to spend her entire
career in the Army and dreams of
raising a family.
"I'll probably be in it for life," she
said."lt's like walking through a door
way. 1 can't see going back. It's hard to
start a family, but I know people who
have made it work."
After Clough's successful experi
ence at Santa Clara, her brother de
cided he wanted to come out here too.

He will attend Santa Clara and has
been offered a four-year scholarship
to the school. He found out that he
would get the honor on the same day
his sister found out she would get
commissioned at the White House.
Clough is an Olmstead Scholar,
has trained with the British military
and was on an elite ranger challenge
team that trekked across the New
Mexico desert in a reenactment of the
Bataan Death March. She attended
33 days of training last summer at Fort
Lewis, Wash, and graduated third of
47 in her regiment.
On Wednesday night, she missed a
charity date auction that she had or
ganized. Someone at the event donat
ed $120 for the chance to take her on
a date.
Even with the rigorous demands of
physical and leadership training at a
different university, Clough main
tained a 3.98 grade point average.
"She has a few A minuses," said
Corbett,"and that's about it."
A poster of Angelina Jolie in the
2(X)1 movie "Tomb Raider" hangs
over Clough's bedroom in Reston, Va.
"I realized that she is better toned
than Angelina Jolie," said Brenda
Clough. "How does this happen?"
"The Army," she said, answering
her own question.
