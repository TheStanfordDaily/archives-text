### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Last night, students gathered in
White Plaza for a candlelight vigil
in remembrance of indigenous
women murdered in Mexico,
Guatemala and Canada. The vigil
kicked off a two-day conference
entitled "Feminicide = Sanctioned
Murder: Race, Gender and Vio
lence in Global Context."
The conference, which will take
place today and tomorrow in
Tresidder Union, intends to ex
plore ways to bring about justice
for the murdered women. Featured
speakers include Elena Poniatows
ka. Rita Segato and Marcela La
garde, who joined students for the
vigil yesterday.
At the vigil, which was entirely
student-run. participants gathered
around a small altar covered in can
dles and bouquets of pink roses and
lilies. The words "Stop Feminicide"
and "Ni Una Mas" were written on
the altar.
In accordance with the tradition
established at conferences at other
schools, students read the names of
the murdered women aloud to
honor them.
"Some of them don't even have
names, because they couldn't be
identified," said Edgar Chavez '09.
communications chair of
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), which co
sponsored the vigil.
According to conference litera
ture, the ongoing deaths of poor
and working women in Mexico,
Guatemala and Canada have
reached epidemic proportions.
In just one Mexican city, more
than 400 women have been mur
dered over the last 14 years while
over 600 have been reported miss
ing. In Guatemala, more than 700

women are killed every year. Re
cently. a conference in Canada re
vealed that over 100 indigenous
women have also been murdered
there in recent years.
"1 thought it was important to
show solidarity with what's going
on." Chavez continued. "Stanford
students aren't very aware of this
issue, but it's been very difficult in
areas along the Mexico-US border."
Luz t£. Reyes '07, who helped or
ganize the vigil and was a member
of the conference's steering com
mittee. felt that Stanford students
would partieipate despite a lack of
awareness.
"1 think Stanford students in
general are really motivated to
ward social justice," she said. "This
is a momentous opportunity for
students to be involved in this issue,
which has received a lot of atten
tion in the media lately."
"Especially the Latino students
are pulled toward it. because these
women are like us." she added.
Reyes said that she was sad
dened by the fact that the Mexican
government has taken few steps to
stop the violence against women
for the last 10 years. These feelings
motivated her to help plan the vigil
"We wanted to do something
that showed student support and
involvement in the issue." she said.
According to Reyes, the confer
ence received a lot of support from
the University. Reyes called Span
ish Prof. Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano
"the spearhead of the entire con
ference."
The conference, which was or
ganized by the department for
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity, will bring together the
most knowledgeable experts on the
recent murders, including mothers
ot murdered and disappeared
women, activists, academics, writ
ers and journalists, human rights
lawyers, artists and filmmakers.
