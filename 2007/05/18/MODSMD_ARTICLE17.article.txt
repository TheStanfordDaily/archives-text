# Love, life, and punctuation
## 
### 
If I hail to trace the love affair/obsession
hack to its origins. I suppose it began in
high school, somewhere around tin
time I wrote my first newspaper column, ti
tied "Love. Life, and Lisa." Blame it on th<
ear-gratifying melody (one. pause, t\\"
pause, three) or the satisfying substanc I
three individual pieces of evidence or de
tail. Or chalk it up to eye-gratifying beauty
and the blindness of true love. Hie bottom
line is that, for reasons still unclear to mi I
have a deep, abiding affection for tii part
lists.
In the interest of full disclosure, and be
cause I generally like to explore the psycho
logical underpinnings of my affections I
will admit to my slightly obsessive-compul
sive. indiscriminant love of lists in general
Particularly at times like the present, when
I'm doing about five different things at any
given time (i.e.. right now, when I'm simul
taneously monitoring my class, keeping
tabs on my email, and writing this column),
my life consists of many, many Post-Its. Se
riously. I have them everywhere- on my
desk at school, on my desk at home, in my
car.on (and sometimes in) my fridge, atop
my other Post-Its. When it gets particulai ly
bad, I have Post-Its to remind me to take
the appropriate Post-Its with me when I
head out the door in the morning. I've tried
shopping with my school to do list. It does
n't work very well.
But I digress. This column is not about
my affinity for/reliance upon brightl\ col
ored sticky pads. This column is about my
very specific love of lists of three. In theeru
dite and inane world of I uglish grammai.
these are also known as "serial lists \t
least that's what Wikipedia just told me.Tin
truth is that,even after one brilliant quarter
ofWCT (that would be PWR before it was
renamed and turned into a mandatory two
quarter sequence),four years as a fairiy sui
cessful English major, and two-plus years as
an English teacher. I actually know verv lit
tie grammar. Very, very little. In tact, the
bulk of my "knowledge" comes from the
words (imperatil. subjonctit ) I picked up in
my high school French class. And just be
cause I can translate the latter to "subjunc
tive" doesn't mean I have any idea what it is
in English.
For most of my life. I disguised my gram
matical ineptitude by following what
"sounded" right to my avid reader's visual
ear. But then 1 became a teachei and suil
denly it wasn't enough to |List sa\ that list
of three sound better/look right with tw
commas in them. That's when I broke out
"Eats. Shoots, and Leaves" and started real
izing what a grammatical black hoi we li\
in. Not that I go around pointing out mis
written signs or correcting peoples use ol
good/well or I/me; English Lovers are not
to be confused with Grammar Nazis, and I
for one. am thrilled when people actually
write out entire words (be it/ ez to abbr
evrythng in txt msgs. so why bother writin .■
any other way?).
All of this is to say that, although I hav
long-since been a user (and occasion.ii
abuser) of the Oxford comma. I had nevi r
heard of it when my mom asked me about
the term last weekend Consultin

Wikipedia, I learned that, in addition to
being .1 now-defunct hand from
(iainesville, Florida and a song by a New
York indie band, Vampire Weekend (which
is how i x mom learned of the term — her
11iend's daughter's boyiriend's dog is in the
band 01 something), the Oxford comma is
"the comma used immediately before a
grammatical conjunction (nearly always
and oi or, sometimes nor) that precedes the
last item in a list of three or more items."
And si i I lie dawn broke. After all of
these years, the love ol my life finally has a
name. And, apparently, a fair amount of
controversy surrounding it. Proponents
argue that it mimics speech (the pause be
fore ill--- "and") and clarifies meaning; op
poru ni nd that it's redundant and oc
casionally introduces ambiguity. The
Daily's style guide does not include its use
(a fact which has caused my editors serious
grief; my columns are generally close to
with the notable exception of
the rst Oxford comma, which is woven

Pearls of wisdom
If I hail to trace the love affair/obsession
hack to its origins. I suppose it began in
high school, somewhere around tin
time I wrote my first newspaper column, ti
tied "Love. Life, and Lisa." Blame it on th<
ear-gratifying melody (one. pause, t\\"
pause, three) or the satisfying substanc I
three individual pieces of evidence or de
tail. Or chalk it up to eye-gratifying beauty
and the blindness of true love. Hie bottom
line is that, for reasons still unclear to mi I
have a deep, abiding affection for tii part
lists.
In the interest of full disclosure, and be
cause I generally like to explore the psycho
logical underpinnings of my affections I
will admit to my slightly obsessive-compul
sive. indiscriminant love of lists in general
Particularly at times like the present, when
I'm doing about five different things at any
given time (i.e.. right now, when I'm simul
taneously monitoring my class, keeping
tabs on my email, and writing this column),
my life consists of many, many Post-Its. Se
riously. I have them everywhere- on my
desk at school, on my desk at home, in my
car.on (and sometimes in) my fridge, atop
my other Post-Its. When it gets particulai ly
bad, I have Post-Its to remind me to take
the appropriate Post-Its with me when I
head out the door in the morning. I've tried
shopping with my school to do list. It does
n't work very well.
But I digress. This column is not about
my affinity for/reliance upon brightl\ col
ored sticky pads. This column is about my
very specific love of lists of three. In theeru
dite and inane world of I uglish grammai.
these are also known as "serial lists \t
least that's what Wikipedia just told me.Tin
truth is that,even after one brilliant quarter
ofWCT (that would be PWR before it was
renamed and turned into a mandatory two
quarter sequence),four years as a fairiy sui
cessful English major, and two-plus years as
an English teacher. I actually know verv lit
tie grammar. Very, very little. In tact, the
bulk of my "knowledge" comes from the
words (imperatil. subjonctit ) I picked up in
my high school French class. And just be
cause I can translate the latter to "subjunc
tive" doesn't mean I have any idea what it is
in English.
For most of my life. I disguised my gram
matical ineptitude by following what
"sounded" right to my avid reader's visual
ear. But then 1 became a teachei and suil
denly it wasn't enough to |List sa\ that list
of three sound better/look right with tw
commas in them. That's when I broke out
"Eats. Shoots, and Leaves" and started real
izing what a grammatical black hoi we li\
in. Not that I go around pointing out mis
written signs or correcting peoples use ol
good/well or I/me; English Lovers are not
to be confused with Grammar Nazis, and I
for one. am thrilled when people actually
write out entire words (be it/ ez to abbr
evrythng in txt msgs. so why bother writin .■
any other way?).
All of this is to say that, although I hav
long-since been a user (and occasion.ii
abuser) of the Oxford comma. I had nevi r
heard of it when my mom asked me about
the term last weekend Consultin

Wikipedia, I learned that, in addition to
being .1 now-defunct hand from
(iainesville, Florida and a song by a New
York indie band, Vampire Weekend (which
is how i x mom learned of the term — her
11iend's daughter's boyiriend's dog is in the
band 01 something), the Oxford comma is
"the comma used immediately before a
grammatical conjunction (nearly always
and oi or, sometimes nor) that precedes the
last item in a list of three or more items."
And si i I lie dawn broke. After all of
these years, the love ol my life finally has a
name. And, apparently, a fair amount of
controversy surrounding it. Proponents
argue that it mimics speech (the pause be
fore ill--- "and") and clarifies meaning; op
poru ni nd that it's redundant and oc
casionally introduces ambiguity. The
Daily's style guide does not include its use
(a fact which has caused my editors serious
grief; my columns are generally close to
with the notable exception of
the rst Oxford comma, which is woven
! il > '>1 m\ body and mind).
Wikip dia also notes that my favorite little
s\ i ! is also tailed the Harvard comma.
s iik wonder: when will Stan
i >wn punctuation mark? Person
id lik to propose the coinage of
*; ■ iril dash A byproduct of the ever
ultt sking Stanford Duck Syndrome,
the Stanford dash occurs in the many multi
li phrases we utilize on this politically
correct, overcommitted campus. Consider
the following examples: I'm a history-Eng
lisli Poli Sci major.This summer,'l'm going
to be mi l Ml surf instructor-sculptor in
Costa Rica. Ibnight, I'll bestudying-email
ing IMing-drinking, and definitely not
sleeping.
As I envision it.the Stanford dash offers
a means ol integrating our fragmented
identities, the metaphorical sticky gum that
promises to hold <>nr many-Post-It-noted
lives together. In fact, I now realize, there is
something equally unifying about the Ox
ford comma, the little curlicue that visually
adjoins otherwise disparate lists <>t three.
\ with the othet lorms of attraction in my
life, apparently my punctuation predilec
tions follow a trend.
i I w vet unlike the other attractions
speth need to date, I'm fairly certain
that my lov< .iii.in with the Oxford comma
ill in ver dissipate, disintegrate, or disap
pear.
Scratch that ! veil after five years on the
St inlord dating scene (if that's not an oxy
iiiron).the romantic in me still believes in
the uncomplicated simplicity of the Ox
l ord-less adage I rue love never dies.
