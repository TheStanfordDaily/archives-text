Co-captain Anne Yelsey explained, the match is now outdoors
and the Commodores are a new team.
"It's going to be completely different," she said. "But we're
confident going in. If we take care of business, we're going to win."
The Commodores are led by two Amandas, No. 19 Amanda
Fish and No. 28 Amanda Taylor. They will challenge senior There
sa Logar and Yelsey in singles, and also form Vanderbilt's top
ranked doubles duo.
The Commodores swept Murray State and Tennessee to ad
vance to this morning's match.
Stanford, meanwhile, was still adjusting to the three-hour time
change and the wet, humid conditions since flying into Atlanta on
Tuesday. The team practiced twice on Wednesday, hitting balls
and getting a feel for the University of Georgia facilities.
Both Yelsey and Logar, seniors present for the last three title
runs, are anxious for a fourth.
"1 think were really ready for this," Logar said. "I've got very
high hopes for this team championship. We've accomplished a lot
this year so far, but we have a lot more to accomplish, and I think
we're ready."
"There's no difference [between this year's team and those
of past years]." Yelsey added. "We've gone into the tournament

the last three years with so much
confidence, knowing that we can
do it."
And the women have plenty
reason to think the way they do.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 1
in the nation and is probably the
odds-on favorite to win it all. Even
so, their Georgia hosts, as well
Georgia Tech and Pacific-10 Con
ference rivals IJCLA and Southern
California have the firepower to

compete with the Card.
USC and Stanford wins on Fri
day would pit the two Pac-10 pow
ers against each other on Sunday,
re-uniting rivalries between not
only the squads, but also USC's
Lindsey Nelson and the Cardinal's
Logar.
But after the teams' last match
on Apr. 14. in which the Cardinal
won 4-3 and the senior defeated
Nelson 6-4. 6-4, Logar was confi
dent looking ahead to the likely
quarterfinal match.
"We've played them before and
we've beaten them both times." she
said. "We know their team really
well."

Stanford's senior firepower will
help push it through this weekend,
hut also in the Cardinal's corner is
head coach I.ele Forood, who this
week earned her third Pac-10
Coach of the Year award.
With that, the women of the
tennis team took everything in
stride on the eve of their attempt
at a fourth straight team title. On
the way back from a Wednesday
night banquet as they spoke with
I he Daily, they sounded jovial and
loose, ready for whatever they may
face in the upcoming rounds.
