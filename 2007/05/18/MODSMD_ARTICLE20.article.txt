# The 						first transgender Prom Queen
## 
### 
Fresno, Calif, is ;i city that voted over
whelmingly for Bush, both in 2000 and
2004. Fresno is a place that still has
cow-tipping and high school parties in the fig
fields. Fresno is a place where we needed se
curity guards at our synagogue during the
1 ligh I loly Days to prevent bad things from
happening. And as of last Saturday, Fresno is
a place that picked a transgender student
named Johnny Vera to be Prom Queen.
Vera goes to Roosevelt High School, and
proudly stands at 6'4" in heels. During his
speech last Friday in the high school quad.
Vera told the crowd,"For me, it's about more
than a crown. It's about saying to people.
'Come out and be who you want to be.' You
have to say,'l am who 1 am. and I'm proud of
who 1 am. My spirit will never be down on the
floor."" Vera is the first reported transgender
student to win the title of Prom King or
Queen in the United States.
Vera's win comes a month after Cinthia
Covarrubias, a transgender student at rival

high school Fresno High, was nominated for
Prom King. Covarrubias lost, hut not after
swirling up a storm of national controversy
over gender-specific rules for Prom King and
Queen. Initially, Covarrubias' nomination
was transferred to a nomination for Prom
Queen, but after a teacher complained about
the legality of this decision, Covarrubias was
re-assigned to compete for King.
I have never been so surprised by my
hometown. Where did this apparent toler
ance come from? 1 certainly don't remember
it from my adolescence — I grew up being

called "Jackie Jewenstein." For my high
school's Multi-cultural Day during my junior
year. I was asked by a school administrator if
1 could make bagels to "share my people's
culture." Yoin Kippur didn't count as an ex
cused absence, and I am pretty sure that it
still doesn't. 1 still remember the time that a
cheerleader came up to me between classes
and told me. "Your people should live in Is
rael because when the Apocalypse comes,
they will rise up and light for the non-sinners.
And kill the Arab terrorists." I am fiercely
proud of my hometown, but a hotbed of po
litical progressivism it is not.
But is it politics and progressivism that led
Vera and Covarrubias to their prom court
nominations? Most reporters are spinning
the story this way. but I don't quite buy it.
Conversely. I also don't think that these
events are a fluke and that Vera's win could
have happened anywhere. There is some-


Bernstein
Sick Sad World
thing special about Fresno.
In San Francisco, transgender
students have specific support net
works. High schools commonly
have LGBT clubs.There is a notice
able amount of activism within the
community when it comes to trans
gender rights. If you're questioning
your gender identification, there is
a community that you can easily
join.
Things are a little different in a
place like Fresno. There was no
LGB T where 1 went to school, but
rather the Gay-Straight Alliance.
And the club's only members were
pseudo-progressive outcasts who
went to UC Berkeley and never re
turned. My hit»h school had maybe

three openly gay people w hen I went
there. ITiis is at a school with 2.7(H)
students. And 1 don't think that my
school was just uncharacteristically
"free of deviance."
In a place like Fresno, if you are
different, you have to hide it. Or you
have to embrace your difference so
fiercely and unquestioningly that no
one will dare to oppose you. Vera
and C ovarrubias chose to embrace
their difference. This is the real rea
son that they were nominated by
their peers for Prom Queen and
King.
These two students' nominations
have less to do with the politics of
gender, and more to do with the pol
itics of high school. High school is
notorious for being a time of low
self-confidence, and insecure stu
dents often gravitate toward confi
dent students. There's a reason that
the quarterback almost always wins
Prom King — he's in a position that

requires confidence. People can see
his confidence, and they want it. Or
they at least want to he near it. Wear
ing stilettos and lipstick to school
when your parents named you John
ny requires confidence, as well.
I am proud to have come from a
town whose high schools have open
ly rewarded fearlessness in being dif
ferent. But for national reporters to
transform Vera and Covarrubias'
story into a tale of gender politics
changes their stories. As someone
who knows my hometown and still
remembers high school politics, 1
don't think that Johnny Vera won
Prom Queen because it was a politi
cal statement to vote for him. Johnny
Vera won Prom Queen because of
his supreme self-assurance and lead
ership. And because he looks wicked
in a pair of heels.
