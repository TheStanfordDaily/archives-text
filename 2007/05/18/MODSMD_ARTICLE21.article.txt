# Wash your language

I'm a convert. I've changed. I won't go back
from whence I came Before I got to law
school, I was known to be the funniest
brown man within a rock throw's reach. My
friends used to call me Jairam NarSayan-feld.
People wore diapers around me because they
constantly feared spontaneous laughter-in
duced se I f-m icturition.
Then I came to a land where the hegemon
ic eye of big brother demanded political cor
rectness at every turn. (1 was going to write "big
sister." but stopped lest people think it a pejo
rative comment about husky women, whom I
love without exception). Ilie PC way people
talked in sunny California's best law school
seemed so unnecessary, so strained, so upper
class New England liberal elitist Democrat. A
bit too complicated and fancy-pants for a
down-to-earth, rural, small-town, humble "Joe
six-pack" like myself.
But up with them I was swept.probably as a
result of my relative lack of sophistication.
Nowadays I am rcflexively viscerally offended
by all remarks that can be tortuously construed
as offensive to any minority, majority,ethnicity,
race, sexual preference, gender or person who
rejects the "forced binary" of gender, kingdom,
phyla or species.

Ilie only thing I can make fun of nowadays
is myself, probably Southerners, maybe reli
gion and.of course.conservatives. But since I'm
a Mormon Neo-con from below the Mason-
Dixon line, the latter are subsumed under the
former.
Although I have become pretty anal about
my oral discharges, I've also realized that there
seems to be one time that you can actually
make jokes on taboo topics: If you're poking
fun at someone who has been gutted by the
media for doing the same.
Example: About three weeks ago one of my
professors offered to take us to the Stanford
"CoMo" after our last class. When a fellow law
student corrected him. he responded. "1 guess
I'm just trying to avoid saying the word i lo\"
I lilarious. no? Well it would've been if you

were there. You see, even though Don Imus'
shamelessly crude and unfunny remarks got
him run out of business, making a clever on
the-spot timely reference to his remarks got
hella laughs.
Another comment heard from a female
friend some years hack: "I was trying to bal
ance my checkbook, but then I realized that 1
should just get a man to do it since my brain
wasn't made lor it." On face, a bit off-putting,
right? Except this comment came soon after
Larry Summers' fantastic verbal slip — taken
out of context, to his credit — claiming that
women might avoid the sciences because of in
nate biological predispositions. (By the way,
Larry, my research isn't complete yet, but it
also seems like women have an innate aver
sion to South Indian law students. Ill keep you
posted.)
lb be tail, most people who make jokes
about women or minorities do so with the firm
belief that they aren't bigots, that in reality their
comments are making fun of those who are big
oted. I Unfortunately. this is oftentimes not the
case, and more importantly, prejudice is incred-

ibly subtle and subconscious (I bet 110
one caught the bias in NBA referees'
foul calls). As a result, the more careful
among us insist on unequivocally re
pudiating the discrimination that has
plagued our history and that continues
to haunt our present.
I think that's the reason why we can
muck those who make comments that
we find unpalatable. In doing so, we
are clearly separating ourselves from
the damaging views that are expressed

therein and establishing that we ik > not
condone them.
When I was a youth, my signature
joke was of the "How many (insert
group to he disparaged here] does it
take to [insert simple task here]?" va
riety. (For those of you who don't
know, it takes a lot.) Yet — to he per
fectly honest — even though the
world undoubtedly shed a silent tear
when Jairam NarSayanfeld lost his
most hilariously ribald material,
maybe on balance it gained some
thing more important.
