# Men's golf survives heat, currently fifth
## Top 10 advance out of West Regional 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's golf
team had a tough time yesterday in
the first of the NCAA Regionals'
three rounds.The Cardinal, which en
tered as the West Regional's top seed,
suffered through a grueling 18 holes
and 100-degree temperatures in
Tempe, Ariz, only to emerge tied for
fifth.
Still, with the top ten schools ad
vancing to the NCAA Champi
onships. Stanford likes where it stands
just fine.
"I feel pretty good about the way
things went today," head coach Con
rad Ray said. "There are three rounds
in this tournament, and if we can do
what we did today in the next two. we
will be in good shape."
It may seem that the leaderboard
is suffering from dyslexia, but it's true:
No. 33 South Carolina is in second,
just five strokes behind the leader. No.
8 UCLA. And yes. No. 19 Arizona
State and unseeded New Mexico are
tied for third — ahead of Stanford. In
a championship golf tournament —
especially one in l(H)-degree heat —
anything can happen.
Zack Miller leads the Cardinal and
is tied for seventh overall. The senior
shot a five-under-par 67, notching an
unbelievable two eagles and two
birdies. Only three strokes separate
Miller from individual leader Erik
Mores of UCLA.
Two strokes behind Miller is junior
Rob Grube, tied for 21st individually
at a three-under-par 69. Following
him is senior Matt Savage, who scored
a 70 on the strength of four birdies.
"I played pretty well but I did
leave quite a few strokes out there."
Savage said. "In general, we had a
solid first round. The heat was tough

out there today but tomorrow's early
tee time will give us a chance to go
low. If we all continue to keep our
scores low. hopefully we can move up
the leaderboard."
Freshman Joseph Bramlett shot a
one-under-par 71 in his first NCAA
tournament, while sophomore Daniel
Lim's 72 brings up the rear.
No Stanford golfers ended on the
wrong side of par. despite the wind
and the pressure of the looming
NCAA Championships. Two rounds
remain to be played today and tomor
row. though, and could bring more
challenges for the Cardinal.

"I think today was a good start to
the tournament." Miller said. '"We
were out in the sun for about five
hours because we had to tee off in the
afternoon. Tomorrow will be a lot
more conducive to low scoring be
cause we will be teeing off in the
morning. Hie heat is just another ele
ment that we have to think about be
cause the climate at Stanford is radi
cally different than Arizona. I think
that the guys were a little disappoint
ed. but tomorrow is another day."
