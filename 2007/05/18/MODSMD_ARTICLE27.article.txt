# SPECIAL EVENT
## Speaker calls attention to Uganda atrocities 
### BEN STOLL 
Twenty students filled the Lane
1 listory Corner basement last night as
Daniella Boston, executive director
of uNight for the Children of Uganda,
spoke about the longest-running con
flict in Africa today as part of an
ASSU Speakers Bureau event.
The war in northern Uganda, which
began in 1986. has caused more than
250,000 deaths and has displaced 95
percent of the population.
"The mortality rate of northern
Uganda is three times that of Darfur,"
Boston said. "When you think of
Uganda, no one really knows about it."
Boston discussed the Lord's Resis
tance Army (LRA), the group fight
ing the war against the Ugandan mili
tary. The LRA is often characterized
as a fanatical, religiously motivated
force, while its actual motives are less
clear, she said.
According to an article written by
Boston,2s,ooochildren have been ab
ducted by the LRA in its habit of kid
napping children and pressing them
into service as child soldiers.
"At this point, they are fighting for
their mere survival," Boston said.
"They have no choice but to recruit
children."

However, Boston said, govern
ment protection camps — which she
referred to as concentration camps in
which a vast majority of the popula
tion lives — are actually the greatest
source of suffering in northern Ugan
da.
"There are one thousand people a
week dying in concentration camps"
she said. "The camps were set up to
protect the people against the rebels,
but now they have become the prob
lem themselves."
Boston did emphasize that a solu
tion is not out of reach, as LRA and
Ugandan government representa
tives are currently negotiating a peace
agreement in Sudan.
But even when the fighting stops,
nearly the entire population of north
ern Uganda will have to be resettled.
"It's the social, cultural, physical
destruction of the society that is so
damaging," she said.
Boston ended with a call to Stan
ford students to become involved in
her organization.
"There needs to be a call by us,"
she said, "to increase the pressure to
dismantle the camps."
