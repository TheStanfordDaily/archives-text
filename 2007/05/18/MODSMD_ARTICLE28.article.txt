# Bush condemns schools without ROTC programs

### JAMES HOHMANN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Only two Stanford seniors, includ
ing Diana Clough "07, will be commis
sioned into the Army through the Re
serve Officers' Training Corps
(ROTC) this year. Decades ago.
dozens would sign up to serve. But dur
ing the brouhaha over Vietnam in the
early 19705, the University's Faculty
Senate banned ROTC detachments
from forming on campus.
So for four years, Clough has need
ed to find a way to Santa Clara Uni
versityâ€” about a 30- minute trip,
each way. When she couldn't drive her
freshman year, she depended on oth
ers to get to drills, labs and training ses
sions. As an older cadet, now the
leader of the Santa Clara battalion,
she has tried to make it more conven
ient for younger participants to attend
required programs.
Bush said that students at schools
without ROTC live "a split existence
where your life as a cadet or mid
shipmen is invisible to most of your fel
low students."
Clough said that the President's
speech writers met with her before yes
terday's White I Jo use ceremony in the
East Room.
"1 felt like he was talking about me
the entire time, which is really insane,"
Clough said."The fact finders asked us

if we get credit and commute to the
school."
Based, at least in part, on the con
versation with Clough and cadets at
other elite schools, the President's
speech explicitly criticized universities
like Stanford for not allowing ROTC
chapters on campus.
"It should not he hard for our great
schools of learning to find room to
honor the service of men and women
who are standing up to defend the
freedoms that make the work of our
universities possible," Bush said to ap
plause. "To the cadets and midship
men who are graduating from a col
lege or university that believes ROTC
is not worthy of a place on campus,
here is my message: Your university
may not honor your military service,
but the United States of America
does.
Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to
President John Hennessy, said that the

University's ban on ROTC and its pol
icy of not accepting credit for ROTC
classes at other schools does not mean
that administrators or the community
at-large do not support the cadets.
"ROTC is often overlooked as a
form of government service," he said.
"We're very interested in training the
leaders of tomorrow not just for pri
vate sector jobs but also for work in the
public sector."
Wachtel said that 1 lennessy and
Prof. William Perry, formerly a U.S. sec
retary of defense, held a lunch in the
fall to honor ROTC students on cam
pus.
He added that any change in the
current policy would need to be sanc
tioned by the Faculty Senate.
"People have talked about it infor
mally," he said, "but there hasn't been
any formal movement."
Clough said that the University
misses out on "a vital chance to influ-

ence the student leaders of tomorrow."
"Stanford is really into producing
future leaders in every area, but they
don't include the military, which is in
teresting considering the times we're
in." she said, noting that national lead
ers like former Secretary of State Colin
Powell got their start in ROTC pro
grams.
Lt. Col. Shari L. Corbett. a profes
sor of military science at Santa Clara
University and commander of the
ROTC detachment, said that Califor
nia is considered a growth region by
the ROTC. But she said for a school
like Stanford to get a chapter,students
would need to demonstrate enough in
terest in committing to military service.
"To get a program," she said, "you
have to enough people that add to the
mission."
