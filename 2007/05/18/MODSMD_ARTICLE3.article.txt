Fresno State's sophomore right-hander lim
ited the Cardinal (33-20-1) to just four singles
and never let a runner past second base. She
struck out five straight Stanford batters in the
second and third innings to stifle the hosting
Cardinal just after Fresno (47-16) put its runs on
the board.

Smith said of Mackin. "And she has good move

make adjustments and take advantage of the
hard ground, but we didn't do that."

was superb, but suffered through early trouble.

wall, putting Barr on second base.
Penna plunked the next Bulldogs batter be

bases with no one out. Penna then forced Ash

Barr scored, to the delight of the large and vocal
contingent of traveling Fresno State supporters.
Fresno State's Shannon Garvin turned the

Junior first baseman Erin Howe turned an
inning-ending double play after Garvin's
groundout, catching a Bulldog runner trying to

chance for a comeback came in the

Fresno State's sophomore right-hander lim
ited the Cardinal (33-20-1) to just four singles
and never let a runner past second base. She
struck out five straight Stanford batters in the
second and third innings to stifle the hosting
Cardinal just after Fresno (47-16) put its runs on
the board.
"She throws hard." third baseman Michelle
Smith said of Mackin. "And she has good move
ment and a good mix of pitches. We needed to
make adjustments and take advantage of the
hard ground, but we didn't do that."
Stanford sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
was superb, but suffered through early trouble.
Fresno's designated player, sophomore Mer
ryann Barr. led off the top of the second with a
sinking line drive to the outfield. Stanford sen
ior left fielder Jackie Rinehart sprinted in after
the ball, but she lunged just too far.The ball car
omed off the heel of her glove and rolled to the
wall, putting Barr on second base.
Penna plunked the next Bulldogs batter be
fore giving up a single to Mackin to load the
bases with no one out. Penna then forced Ash
ley White to senior shortstop Lindsey Key. but
the grounder was too soft to get the runner at
home. Key had to settle for the force at first and
Barr scored, to the delight of the large and vocal
contingent of traveling Fresno State supporters.
Fresno State's Shannon Garvin turned the
same trick in the next at-bat. giving the Bull
dogs a 2-0 lead.
Junior first baseman Erin Howe turned an
inning-ending double play after Garvin's
groundout, catching a Bulldog runner trying to
advance on the play, but the damage had been
done.
"I thought our pitcher did a great job getting
out of that," Rittman said."We got some ground
balls, but we couldn't make the plays at the
plate."
Penna ended the night with five hits allowed
and seven strikeouts. But she wasn't perfect —
she hit two batters in the first two innings — on


SAMMY ABUSRUR/THe Stonford Daily
Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna was near-perfect, yielding just two runs last night against Fresno State. But the
Bulldogs' Robin Mackin threw a scoreless seven innings, and the Card now sits on elimination's doorstep.
a night when the level of Fresno
State's play demanded near-perfec
tion.
The Cardinal spent the rest of
the game trying to play catch-up,
hut to no avail. Stanford put two
runners on base with just one out in
the second, only for Mackin to start
her run of five straight strikeouts.
Henna stole second with two outs in
the bottom of the fifth, but Rinehart
grounded to the shortstop to end
the frame.
Stanford's last meaningful
chance for a comeback came in the
sixth inning. Freshman ccnterfield
er Alissa I laber.who had earlier hit
a ball to the centerfield warning
track, was hit in the leg by Mackin's
first offering. After Smith popped
out to short, sophomore designated
player Maddy Coon lifted a ball to
deep right. ITie ball looked like it
might have had the distance, but a
strong wind blowing toward home
plate turned the potential homer
into a routine fly ball, ending the in
ning.
Mackin retired the side in order
in the seventh to end the game, with
a pop-up. a groundout and her
eighth strikeout.

"Offensively, we had some op
portunities and just didn't get the
timely hits," Rittman said.
Mackin turned in a similar per
formance in the first game between
Fresno State and Stanford in last
year's NCAA Regionals. She tossed
a three-hit shutout and struck out
seven in that match-up.363 days he
