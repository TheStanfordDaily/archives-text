saw two very good pitchers just going at it."
Fresno State's sophomore right-hander lim
ited the Cardinal (33-20-1) to just four singles
and never let a runner past second base. She
struck out five straight Stanford batters in the
second and third innings to stifle the hosting
Cardinal just after Fresno (47-16) put its runs on
the board.
"She throws hard." third baseman Michelle
Smith said of Mackin. "And she has good move
ment and a good mix of pitches. We needed to
make adjustments and take advantage of the
hard ground, but we didn't do that."
Stanford sophomore pitcher Missy Penna
was superb, but suffered through early trouble.
Fresno's designated player, sophomore Mer
ryann Barr. led off the top of the second with a
sinking line drive to the outfield. Stanford sen
ior left fielder Jackie Rinehart sprinted in after
the ball, but she lunged just too far.The ball car
omed off the heel of her glove and rolled to the
wall, putting Barr on second base.
Penna plunked the next Bulldogs batter be
fore giving up a single to Mackin to load the
bases with no one out. Penna then forced Ash
ley White to senior shortstop Lindsey Key. but
the grounder was too soft to get the runner at
home. Key had to settle for the force at first and
Barr scored, to the delight of the large and vocal
contingent of traveling Fresno State supporters.
Fresno State's Shannon Garvin turned the
same trick in the next at-bat. giving the Bull
dogs a 2-0 lead.
Junior first baseman Erin Howe turned an
inning-ending double play after Garvin's
groundout, catching a Bulldog runner trying to
advance on the play, but the damage had been
done.
"I thought our pitcher did a great job getting
out of that," Rittman said."We got some ground
balls, but we couldn't make the plays at the
plate."
Penna ended the night with five hits allowed
and seven strikeouts. But she wasn't perfect —
she hit two batters in the first two innings — on

Sophomore pitcher Missy Penna was near-perfect, yielding just two runs last night against Fresno State. But the
Bulldogs' Robin Mackin threw a scoreless seven innings, and the Card now sits on elimination's doorstep.
