Dear Reader,
Today we run the sixth issue in our series of career guides. For the last few months, our business team has spearheaded a joint effort with the Career Development Center to draw upon the
vast resources of Stanford University in the production of this guide. We're proud of the opportunities and advice outlined within this special supplement. The sectors outlined in this guide offer
many exciting areas for involvement. We hope this provides a valuable survey with ideas for further inquiry.
Sincerely,

James Hohmann
President, The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation
