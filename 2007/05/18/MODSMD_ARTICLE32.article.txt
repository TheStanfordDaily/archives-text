When I went back to Boston for
Christmas this year, it might as
well have been Northern
California: the weather, which is
usually about 20 degrees plus wind
chill around that time, never
dropped below 60 degrees.
Everyone in Boston, known for
the Puritan endurance of frigid
long winters and huge snowfalls all
the way through April, was
stunned and oddly silent without

(www.fsdinternational.org) pro
vided me local and national NGO
contacts in Argentina, which have
all offered me amazing opportuni

order to help them continue their
work. At Sierra Club (www.sierr
aclub.org), 1 received invaluable
advice on how to get into the
world of environmental non-prof

its - one strong recommendation
was participating in Green Corps, a
year-long paid training program
that offers hands-on training in
grassroots organizing.
More than anything, these
internships have shown me the
incredible optimism and enthusi
