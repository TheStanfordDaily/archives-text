# Fighting the Green Fight

### CAROLYN MANSFIELD 
When I went back to Boston for
Christmas this year, it might as
well have been Northern
California: the weather, which is
usually about 20 degrees plus wind
chill around that time, never
dropped below 60 degrees.
Everyone in Boston, known for
the Puritan endurance of frigid
long winters and huge snowfalls all
the way through April, was
stunned and oddly silent without
the fierce weather to complain

about. Though I missed my couple
weeks of snow and skiing, 1 did get
one concession out of the vaca
tion: my dad, who generally gripes
about the fact that he's paying so
much for me to get a degree in
Anthropology and Tree-hugging,
finally admitted that he was glad
someone was trying to do some
thing about this weird global
warming situation.
For the past two summers, I
have interned in the crunchy world
of environmental NGOs: first with
the Earthwatch Institute in Boston

helping organize volunteers trips
that aid scientific and conservation
research, then last summer in
Argentina through the Foundation
for Sustainable Development
coordinating community-based
environmental awareness, and
finally this past winter with the
Sierra Club in San Francisco work
ing with their national media team
on local and countrywide cam
paigns. Earthwatch (www.earth
watch.org) introduced me to the
world of environmental volun
teerism and philanthropy - proof

that working in the environmental
field isn't all Birkenstocks and
chaining yourself to ancient red
woods. My work with Foundation
for Sustainable Development
(www.fsdinternational.org) pro
vided me local and national NGO
contacts in Argentina, which have
all offered me amazing opportuni
ties to return after I graduate in
order to help them continue their
work. At Sierra Club (www.sierr
aclub.org), 1 received invaluable
advice on how to get into the
world of environmental non-prof

its - one strong recommendation
was participating in Green Corps, a
year-long paid training program
that offers hands-on training in
grassroots organizing.
More than anything, these
internships have shown me the
incredible optimism and enthusi
asm these people have for their jobs
each day. The work environments
were supportive, personal, and
relaxed: most people wore jeans to
work and talked openly and with-
out pretension about their lives and ambi
tions. And every day on the job, there was
some new task or campaign that felt impor
tant, because in many cases with NGO work,
if one group doesn't step up and do it, it just
won't get done. Admittedly, none of these
jobs has been very profitable in the econom
ic sense (another complaint of my father's),
but that's the great news about entering the
"green" field right now: with the recent
worldwide momentum around the issues of
global warming, for-profit opportunities in
the field are opening up: businesses need
environmental consultants, renewable ener
gy is a buzzword, ecotourism is booming,
politicians are starting to put green issues on
their agendas, and much more. And after
working with such dedicated and passionate
coworkers and seeing real progress come out
of their efforts, I can't imagine any other sort
of career - as my charismatic Argentine boss
once said, "I've spent thirty years working
under one belief: that a better world is possi
ble. I can't imagine money or fame being any
more satisfying than the feeling that I'm help
ing make those changes." Plus, I've got to
make sure that 20 years down the line, my
kids will be able to suffer just as much as 1 did
through the bitter winters back east.
