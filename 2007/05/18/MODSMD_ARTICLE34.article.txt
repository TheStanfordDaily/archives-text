Yousra Tilden
Design and Construction Administration
South Bay Water Recycling Program
MS Civil Engineering—Water Resources,
Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)
Pump Stations Reliability project
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
•Design of the Silver Creek Development three
Pump Stations
•Design of Oracle Building Storm Water
Detention Basin
•Design of the relocation of the Hetch Hetchy
Pipelines across the Guadalupe River and
Coyote Creek
•Design and Construction Administration of the
SBWRP 60-inch, 15,000 feet long Transmission
Pipeline
•Program Management of the Pajaro Valley
Water Management Agency 48-inch, 22.2 miles
long Import Pipeline.

"Do what you like to do is the
secret of success."
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I have stayed in contact with my old bosses and
have been fortunate to make great friends along
the way. It is a very small community that I am
working with and it is important to keep a good
relationship with everyone around you. The best
way to get a new job is through networking and
getting the people who are in the business to
help you find that next job for you.
Robert Ellgas
Technical Manager for the San Francisco
Presidio Environmental Restoration Project
Shaw Environmental, Inc.
BS Engineering, Stanford University
MS Water Resources Engineering, Harvard
University
PhD Environmental Systems Analysis,
Harvard University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
Member of Ecology House (now Terrahouse)
theme coop. House Financial Manager for a
year. Participated in House-sponsored environ
mental awareness activities around campus.
Organized and facilitated first environmental
education class at Stanford. Member of Tau Beta
Pi (engineering honor society). Student counselor
for transfer students. Favorite classes were
CE160 (Water Resources Planning), CE170 (Man
and His Environment), CE171 (Environmental
Planning), EDU190 (Directed Research in
Education—the environmental education class I
mentioned above), OR152 (Introduction to
Operations Research) and SP1 11 (Third Year
Spanish).
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
I transferred to Stanford from Caltech as a
junior. Thus, my career plans had two years to
mature before the transfer. At Caltech, I first
majored in mathematics, then population biolo
gy, then environmental engineering. I transferred

to Stanford with an environmental engineering
focus to my interdisciplinary program in General
Engineering under Prof. Ralph Smith called
"Resource Strategy". The program was a broad
brush approach for understanding resource pro
duction, consumption, and environmental
impact. I thought that my career would somehow
relate to the nascent field of environmental
impact analysis.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
My basic interest in environmental sciences and
engineering did not change throughout my time
at Stanford, and upon graduation I still believed
I would somehow be working in the field of envi
ronmental impact analysis, such as in preparing
environmental impact statements/reports.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
In the summer before and after my junior year,
and throughout my junior year and part of my
senior year, I worked as the Student Relations
Representative for Bank of America at Stanford
Shopping Center (I had worked for Bank of
America since high school graduation). I had
many interesting experiences in this job; an
example was when a relatively wealthy student
inquired about the bank's investment policies in
South Africa (during these times of increasing
apartheid awareness) before he decided to open
his accounts with the bank, and I did a lot of
research to come up with the information he
wanted (incidentally, it did not bode well for the
Bank). After graduating in April 1974, I found a
unique and interesting job as a live-in assistant

that directly relates to your academic back
ground. Many companies look more to strong
motivation, broad interests and communication
skills rather than course preparation that exactly
matches their needs."

gardener in an Atherton mansion as I awaited an
assignment in the Peace Corps. I found this
opportunity on the job posting bulletin board in
Tressider Union.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a rural works construction
engineer with the U.S. Peace Corps in the Fiji
Islands. I transferred my Peace Corps service to
Honduras after a year in Fiji to work for another
two years as Honduras' first environmental plan
ner, which was more suited to my academic
preparation and interest, and was a unique
opportunity with responsibilities that would other
wise be unavailable to me for many years in the
United States. Finding these jobs was not hard: I
merely applied to the Peace Corps and was
accepted.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
Peace Corps was a gratifying and maturing expe
rience for me (unlike for many volunteers), but
my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.
Any advice for students?
The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran
scripts for evaluating probability of success.
Conversely, do not be discouraged if you cannot

find a job that directly relates to your academic
background. Many companies look more to
strong motivation, broad interests and communi
cation skills rather than course preparation that
exactly matches their needs.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a senior manager in an environmental con
sulting firm specializing in hazardous waste site
investigation and remediation. I direct both tech
nical and administrative staff in meeting client
project needs (this usually means meeting project
deadline and budget constraints). I also have
responsibility for developing business with both
existing and potential clients primarily in the utili
ties sector. A typical project would be where an
environmental regulatory agency has imposed a
cleanup order on our client. The client is then
legally obligated to develop and implement
plans for establishing the nature and extent of
soil or groundwater contamination at their site,
and after so doing, cleaning up the contamina
tion. The client hires us to meet their regulatory
obligations at minimum cost.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
I have already mentioned my first assignment
after Stanford was the Peace Corps. After the
extreme adversities I faced in the Peace Corps
(as Peace Corps volunteers commonly face), I felt
I could do practically anything--a feeling that
was to be constantly tested in an 8 1/2-year
doctoral program (my thesis committee disband
ed after my fifth year, and I had to complete vir
tually a new thesis in the next 3 1/2 years). After
finally finding my first permanent environmental
consulting job several months after being award
ed my doctorate, I successfully managed a num
ber projects of the $300K magnitude and pub
lished a couple articles in technical journals. This
led to a second job of increased responsibility
managing projects up to $IMM in magnitude
and working more directly with a variety of client
representatives (including legal counsel). I also
provided expert witness testimony on two contro
versial cases. After five years with this firm, and
based on my academic specialty of statistics, I
free-lanced for two years with clients who needed

my expertise. I then accepted a first assignment
with my current company, Shaw Environmental,
Inc., as the Technical Manager for the San
Francisco Presidio Environmental Restoration
Project, where I directed approximately 50 pro
fessional staff. This led to additional program
management assignments with key clients, where
I have been responsible for projects up to
$2.3 MM. In addition, I continue to provide
expert witness testimony, including testifying
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I might be unusual in that "networking" per se
has not been critical to my success. It seems that
most of my accomplishments were self-inspired,
although they have also been recognized by key
individuals. However, throughout my career,
there have been people who I have admired,
who served as mentors, and with whom I devel
oped satisfying relationships. Such individuals
have been particularly important during setbacks
(and there have been several setbacks!). I now
formally serve as a mentor in Shaw's mentor-pro
tege program, where I work with several staff on
helping them develop both technical and man
agement skills as they advance in our profession.

while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?

When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
ChemEng 20 (Intro to Chemical Engineering);
ChemEng 180 (Chemical I entered Stanford as a
declared chemical engineer but I originally want
ed to design my own major in "biochemical engi
neering" or "biotech engineering" that would
focus on applying chemical and mechanical
engineering principles (i.e., pharmacokinetics
and advanced materials selection) to solving bio
logical problems like cancer and asthma.
Biomedical engineering wasn't offered at
Stanford at the time and I was more into the
chemistry side than the biology side anyway. To
support this, I tried to take the Humßio track
while being a dual chemical and mechanical
engineering student (which was a huge mistake!).
I settled in as a true ChemE in my junior year
and decided to minor in mechanical engineer
ing.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
Once I completed a few courses in the Chemical
Engineering track, I realized that was where my
true passion lay. I'm a process-oriented guy and
so the ChemE major fit in very well with the way
my mind works. I'm really into the diagramming
and specification writing and figuring out how
you get from raw ingredients to finished prod
ucts.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I made it a point during my time at Stanford to
spend my summers doing non-engineering tasks.
I felt that I would spend a good portion of my
life doing the actual engineering work so my col
lege summers should be spent doing exciting,
interesting things with friends and family or I
made it a point to have "purposeful inactivity". I
described it as "Stanford Abroad for Engineers"
since the great programs that Stanford has for
Distance Learning don't really fit into the techie

curriculum. My choice had some benefits and
some setbacks. The good thing was that it
allowed me to detox myself from all of the
physics, chemistry, and engineering and focus on
non-engineering educational pursuits or commu
nity service (tutoring, coaching a little league
team) or just sleeping until noon and then play
ing video games until it was time to go play bas
ketball with friends. I also had the opportunity to
meet new people and just travel around the US
visiting friends I met at Stanford or family mem
bers in other states. The disadvantage is having
to explain to future employers during interviews
and at job fairs come senior year that you made
the decision to forgo engineering internships to
reconnect with the rest of the world.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after college was as an unpaid men
tor/tutor at the local YMCA in San Diego, CA. In
May 1998, I decided that I wasn't ready to start
the full grind as a degreed engineer just yet. I
turned down numerous chemical engineering job
offers from Bechtel, Schlumberger, and Proctor &
Gamble to take off the first six months after
graduation. I spent the summer/fall visiting fami-

My main advice for students is to use the
tools that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or
peers or family or community leaders/profes
sional engineers to shadow. It takes a well
rounded person to succeed in today's work
climate and everyone needs to be able to
communicate effectively with vendors or
clients or co-workers.

ly in Arkansas and teaching kids math, chemistry,
and ecology. It was the smartest career choice I
have made to date. So I started looking for a job
in January 1 999 and landed my first engineering
job after graduation as a chemical engineer at
General Atomics in San Diego, CA. General
Atomics uses a high temperature, high pressure
water process to destroy chemical weapons and
hazardous wastes. I found the job by sending
resumes online to everywhere you could imag
ine, by replying to every ChemE ad in all the
major newspapers, and attending multiple inter
views until I decided on General Atomics
because of the great opportunities I'd have there
to showcase my talents.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
At GA, my duties as a chemical engineer mostly
included preparing technical documentation,
reviewing process flow diagrams, vendor selec
tion for pumps and process subsystems, model
ing chemical reactions using computer software,
spare parts inventory, operation of a Supercritical
Water Oxidation (SCWO) reactor, producing
budgets and timelines, and I had the coolest
time preparing a marketing video for the plant
designed for destroying stockpiles of WWII
chemical agents stored near Lexington, Kentucky.
This included drafting a script, preparing a story
board, and directing video production company.
I had the best time because it was way more
than I expected!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
My career has been punctuated by me being in
the right place at the right time! At General
Atomics, the management was focused on bring
ing their main technology, SCWO, to the fore
front and so they put most of the staff on that
project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience
using all types of computer software, and my
technical writing skills. My interdisciplinary acad
emic background has given me the ability to per
ceive and understand not only the scientific side
of a given situation, but also the "human" aspect,
which is vital for effective problem solving. My
eagerness to accept new challenges is also an
asset that has benefited my career development.
Stanford presented me the opportunity to work in
cross-disciplinary teams so I'm open to all kinds
of ways of looking at a problem. My learning
and implementation of new technologies and my
experiences in the ChemE track of reorganizing
and reanalyzing data and database functions has
helped me to achieve improved yield manage
ment and operating efficiency for all of my pro
jects. But my greatest gift from Stanford is my
technical writing skills. I have been given a lot
more responsibilities because in the industries
I've worked in (hazardous wastes and now
renewable energy), being able to clearly express
what was done and what I saw is invaluable. All
of the copious note-taking and report writing at
Stanford has helped me carve out my own niche
in every company that I have been associated
with. My current boss, who is a non-engineer,
appreciates me being able to relay all of the
technical mumbo-jumbo we do in a way that
does not make him feel like I'm teaching an
upper division mathematics course on string the
ory.
Any advice for students?
My main advice for students is to use the tools
that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or peers
or family or community leaders/professional
engineers to shadow. It takes a well-rounded
person to succeed in today's work climate and
everyone needs to be able to communicate
effectively with vendors or clients or co-workers.
Also, students should think clearly about what
they want to do on a day-to-day basis and direct
their searches along those lines. I am a number
crunching, document drawing, techno-junkie. I

hate extended computer programming and cus
tomer service work and nonspecific tasks so I
found a job that fit my likes and avoided the stuff
that I disliked.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a chemical engineer at Changing World
Technologies and carry around a lot of different
hats since we're such a small company (less than
50 employees). Many of the tasks I described
above are still what I do today. For CWT, my pri
mary role is more of the analytical observer, new
idea researcher, and emerging technologies
reporter. I am also, more or less, the "Assistant
Technology Officer", to our CTO who lives in
Tacoma, WA. I will occasionally run an experi
ment manually at our pilot plant in Philadelphia
but more often than not, I'd rather have a techni
cian run the experiment, I observe his/her
progress, and then have him/her forward me all
of the information and I can "tell the story" my
way. For lack of a better term, I'm the official
CWT "documentarian". CWT was featured in the
May 2003 issue of Discover Magazine (full arti
cle at http://www.discover.com/may 03/
featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.

you study? What were your favorite classes?
Member of Ecology House (now Terrahouse)
theme coop. House Financial Manager for a
year. Participated in House-sponsored environ
mental awareness activities around campus.
Organized and facilitated first environmental
education class at Stanford. Member of Tau Beta
Pi (engineering honor society). Student counselor
for transfer students. Favorite classes were
CE160 (Water Resources Planning), CE170 (Man
and His Environment), CE171 (Environmental
Planning), EDU190 (Directed Research in
Education—the environmental education class I
mentioned above), OR152 (Introduction to
Operations Research) and SP1 11 (Third Year
Spanish).
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
I transferred to Stanford from Caltech as a
junior. Thus, my career plans had two years to
mature before the transfer. At Caltech, I first
majored in mathematics, then population biolo
gy, then environmental engineering. I transferred

to Stanford with an environmental engineering
focus to my interdisciplinary program in General
Engineering under Prof. Ralph Smith called
"Resource Strategy". The program was a broad
brush approach for understanding resource pro
duction, consumption, and environmental
impact. I thought that my career would somehow
relate to the nascent field of environmental
impact analysis.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
My basic interest in environmental sciences and
engineering did not change throughout my time
at Stanford, and upon graduation I still believed
I would somehow be working in the field of envi
ronmental impact analysis, such as in preparing
environmental impact statements/reports.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
In the summer before and after my junior year,
and throughout my junior year and part of my
senior year, I worked as the Student Relations
Representative for Bank of America at Stanford
Shopping Center (I had worked for Bank of
America since high school graduation). I had
many interesting experiences in this job; an
example was when a relatively wealthy student
inquired about the bank's investment policies in
South Africa (during these times of increasing
apartheid awareness) before he decided to open
his accounts with the bank, and I did a lot of
research to come up with the information he
wanted (incidentally, it did not bode well for the
Bank). After graduating in April 1974, I found a
unique and interesting job as a live-in assistant

gardener in an Atherton mansion as I awaited an
assignment in the Peace Corps. I found this
opportunity on the job posting bulletin board in
Tressider Union.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a rural works construction
engineer with the U.S. Peace Corps in the Fiji
Islands. I transferred my Peace Corps service to
Honduras after a year in Fiji to work for another
two years as Honduras' first environmental plan
ner, which was more suited to my academic
preparation and interest, and was a unique
opportunity with responsibilities that would other
wise be unavailable to me for many years in the
United States. Finding these jobs was not hard: I
merely applied to the Peace Corps and was
accepted.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
Peace Corps was a gratifying and maturing expe
rience for me (unlike for many volunteers), but
my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.
Any advice for students?
The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran
scripts for evaluating probability of success.
Conversely, do not be discouraged if you cannot

find a job that directly relates to your academic
background. Many companies look more to
strong motivation, broad interests and communi
cation skills rather than course preparation that
exactly matches their needs.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a senior manager in an environmental con
sulting firm specializing in hazardous waste site
investigation and remediation. I direct both tech
nical and administrative staff in meeting client
project needs (this usually means meeting project
deadline and budget constraints). I also have
responsibility for developing business with both
existing and potential clients primarily in the utili
ties sector. A typical project would be where an
environmental regulatory agency has imposed a
cleanup order on our client. The client is then
legally obligated to develop and implement
plans for establishing the nature and extent of
soil or groundwater contamination at their site,
and after so doing, cleaning up the contamina
tion. The client hires us to meet their regulatory
obligations at minimum cost.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
I have already mentioned my first assignment
after Stanford was the Peace Corps. After the
extreme adversities I faced in the Peace Corps
(as Peace Corps volunteers commonly face), I felt
I could do practically anything--a feeling that
was to be constantly tested in an 8 1/2-year
doctoral program (my thesis committee disband
ed after my fifth year, and I had to complete vir
tually a new thesis in the next 3 1/2 years). After
finally finding my first permanent environmental
consulting job several months after being award
ed my doctorate, I successfully managed a num
ber projects of the $300K magnitude and pub
lished a couple articles in technical journals. This
led to a second job of increased responsibility
managing projects up to $IMM in magnitude
and working more directly with a variety of client
representatives (including legal counsel). I also
provided expert witness testimony on two contro
versial cases. After five years with this firm, and
based on my academic specialty of statistics, I
free-lanced for two years with clients who needed

my expertise. I then accepted a first assignment
with my current company, Shaw Environmental,
Inc., as the Technical Manager for the San
Francisco Presidio Environmental Restoration
Project, where I directed approximately 50 pro
fessional staff. This led to additional program
management assignments with key clients, where
I have been responsible for projects up to
$2.3 MM. In addition, I continue to provide
expert witness testimony, including testifying
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I might be unusual in that "networking" per se
has not been critical to my success. It seems that
most of my accomplishments were self-inspired,
although they have also been recognized by key
individuals. However, throughout my career,
there have been people who I have admired,
who served as mentors, and with whom I devel
oped satisfying relationships. Such individuals
have been particularly important during setbacks
(and there have been several setbacks!). I now
formally serve as a mentor in Shaw's mentor-pro
tege program, where I work with several staff on
helping them develop both technical and man
agement skills as they advance in our profession.

When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
ChemEng 20 (Intro to Chemical Engineering);
ChemEng 180 (Chemical I entered Stanford as a
declared chemical engineer but I originally want
ed to design my own major in "biochemical engi
neering" or "biotech engineering" that would
focus on applying chemical and mechanical
engineering principles (i.e., pharmacokinetics
and advanced materials selection) to solving bio
logical problems like cancer and asthma.
Biomedical engineering wasn't offered at
Stanford at the time and I was more into the
chemistry side than the biology side anyway. To
support this, I tried to take the Humßio track
while being a dual chemical and mechanical
engineering student (which was a huge mistake!).
I settled in as a true ChemE in my junior year
and decided to minor in mechanical engineer
ing.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
Once I completed a few courses in the Chemical
Engineering track, I realized that was where my
true passion lay. I'm a process-oriented guy and
so the ChemE major fit in very well with the way
my mind works. I'm really into the diagramming
and specification writing and figuring out how
you get from raw ingredients to finished prod
ucts.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I made it a point during my time at Stanford to
spend my summers doing non-engineering tasks.
I felt that I would spend a good portion of my
life doing the actual engineering work so my col
lege summers should be spent doing exciting,
interesting things with friends and family or I
made it a point to have "purposeful inactivity". I
described it as "Stanford Abroad for Engineers"
since the great programs that Stanford has for
Distance Learning don't really fit into the techie

curriculum. My choice had some benefits and
some setbacks. The good thing was that it
allowed me to detox myself from all of the
physics, chemistry, and engineering and focus on
non-engineering educational pursuits or commu
nity service (tutoring, coaching a little league
team) or just sleeping until noon and then play
ing video games until it was time to go play bas
ketball with friends. I also had the opportunity to
meet new people and just travel around the US
visiting friends I met at Stanford or family mem
bers in other states. The disadvantage is having
to explain to future employers during interviews
and at job fairs come senior year that you made
the decision to forgo engineering internships to
reconnect with the rest of the world.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after college was as an unpaid men
tor/tutor at the local YMCA in San Diego, CA. In
May 1998, I decided that I wasn't ready to start
the full grind as a degreed engineer just yet. I
turned down numerous chemical engineering job
offers from Bechtel, Schlumberger, and Proctor &
Gamble to take off the first six months after
graduation. I spent the summer/fall visiting fami-

tools that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or
peers or family or community leaders/profes

rounded person to succeed in today's work
climate and everyone needs to be able to
communicate effectively with vendors or
clients or co-workers.

ly in Arkansas and teaching kids math, chemistry,
and ecology. It was the smartest career choice I
have made to date. So I started looking for a job
in January 1 999 and landed my first engineering
job after graduation as a chemical engineer at
General Atomics in San Diego, CA. General
Atomics uses a high temperature, high pressure
water process to destroy chemical weapons and
hazardous wastes. I found the job by sending
resumes online to everywhere you could imag
ine, by replying to every ChemE ad in all the
major newspapers, and attending multiple inter
views until I decided on General Atomics
because of the great opportunities I'd have there
to showcase my talents.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
At GA, my duties as a chemical engineer mostly
included preparing technical documentation,
reviewing process flow diagrams, vendor selec
tion for pumps and process subsystems, model
ing chemical reactions using computer software,
spare parts inventory, operation of a Supercritical
Water Oxidation (SCWO) reactor, producing
budgets and timelines, and I had the coolest
time preparing a marketing video for the plant
designed for destroying stockpiles of WWII
chemical agents stored near Lexington, Kentucky.
This included drafting a script, preparing a story
board, and directing video production company.
I had the best time because it was way more
than I expected!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
My career has been punctuated by me being in
the right place at the right time! At General
Atomics, the management was focused on bring
ing their main technology, SCWO, to the fore
front and so they put most of the staff on that
project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience
using all types of computer software, and my
technical writing skills. My interdisciplinary acad
emic background has given me the ability to per
ceive and understand not only the scientific side
of a given situation, but also the "human" aspect,
which is vital for effective problem solving. My
eagerness to accept new challenges is also an
asset that has benefited my career development.
Stanford presented me the opportunity to work in
cross-disciplinary teams so I'm open to all kinds
of ways of looking at a problem. My learning
and implementation of new technologies and my
experiences in the ChemE track of reorganizing
and reanalyzing data and database functions has
helped me to achieve improved yield manage
ment and operating efficiency for all of my pro
jects. But my greatest gift from Stanford is my
technical writing skills. I have been given a lot
more responsibilities because in the industries
I've worked in (hazardous wastes and now
renewable energy), being able to clearly express
what was done and what I saw is invaluable. All
of the copious note-taking and report writing at
Stanford has helped me carve out my own niche
in every company that I have been associated
with. My current boss, who is a non-engineer,
appreciates me being able to relay all of the
technical mumbo-jumbo we do in a way that
does not make him feel like I'm teaching an
upper division mathematics course on string the
ory.
Any advice for students?
My main advice for students is to use the tools
that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or peers
or family or community leaders/professional
engineers to shadow. It takes a well-rounded
person to succeed in today's work climate and
everyone needs to be able to communicate
effectively with vendors or clients or co-workers.
Also, students should think clearly about what
they want to do on a day-to-day basis and direct
their searches along those lines. I am a number
crunching, document drawing, techno-junkie. I

hate extended computer programming and cus
tomer service work and nonspecific tasks so I
found a job that fit my likes and avoided the stuff
that I disliked.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a chemical engineer at Changing World
Technologies and carry around a lot of different
hats since we're such a small company (less than
50 employees). Many of the tasks I described
above are still what I do today. For CWT, my pri
mary role is more of the analytical observer, new
idea researcher, and emerging technologies
reporter. I am also, more or less, the "Assistant
Technology Officer", to our CTO who lives in
Tacoma, WA. I will occasionally run an experi
ment manually at our pilot plant in Philadelphia
but more often than not, I'd rather have a techni
cian run the experiment, I observe his/her
progress, and then have him/her forward me all
of the information and I can "tell the story" my
way. For lack of a better term, I'm the official
CWT "documentarian". CWT was featured in the
May 2003 issue of Discover Magazine (full arti
cle at http://www.discover.com/may 03/
featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.

Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)

If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I have stayed in contact with my old bosses and
have been fortunate to make great friends along
the way. It is a very small community that I am
working with and it is important to keep a good
relationship with everyone around you. The best
way to get a new job is through networking and
getting the people who are in the business to
help you find that next job for you.

My first job was as a rural works construction

my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.
Any advice for students?
The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran
scripts for evaluating probability of success.
Conversely, do not be discouraged if you cannot

find a job that directly relates to your academic
background. Many companies look more to
strong motivation, broad interests and communi
cation skills rather than course preparation that
exactly matches their needs.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a senior manager in an environmental con
sulting firm specializing in hazardous waste site
investigation and remediation. I direct both tech
nical and administrative staff in meeting client
project needs (this usually means meeting project
deadline and budget constraints). I also have
responsibility for developing business with both
existing and potential clients primarily in the utili
ties sector. A typical project would be where an
environmental regulatory agency has imposed a
cleanup order on our client. The client is then
legally obligated to develop and implement
plans for establishing the nature and extent of
soil or groundwater contamination at their site,
and after so doing, cleaning up the contamina
tion. The client hires us to meet their regulatory
obligations at minimum cost.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
I have already mentioned my first assignment
after Stanford was the Peace Corps. After the
extreme adversities I faced in the Peace Corps
(as Peace Corps volunteers commonly face), I felt
I could do practically anything--a feeling that
was to be constantly tested in an 8 1/2-year
doctoral program (my thesis committee disband
ed after my fifth year, and I had to complete vir
tually a new thesis in the next 3 1/2 years). After
finally finding my first permanent environmental
consulting job several months after being award
ed my doctorate, I successfully managed a num
ber projects of the $300K magnitude and pub
lished a couple articles in technical journals. This
led to a second job of increased responsibility
managing projects up to $IMM in magnitude
and working more directly with a variety of client
representatives (including legal counsel). I also
provided expert witness testimony on two contro
versial cases. After five years with this firm, and
based on my academic specialty of statistics, I
free-lanced for two years with clients who needed

my expertise. I then accepted a first assignment
with my current company, Shaw Environmental,
Inc., as the Technical Manager for the San
Francisco Presidio Environmental Restoration
Project, where I directed approximately 50 pro
fessional staff. This led to additional program
management assignments with key clients, where
I have been responsible for projects up to
$2.3 MM. In addition, I continue to provide
expert witness testimony, including testifying
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I might be unusual in that "networking" per se
has not been critical to my success. It seems that
most of my accomplishments were self-inspired,
although they have also been recognized by key
individuals. However, throughout my career,
there have been people who I have admired,
who served as mentors, and with whom I devel
oped satisfying relationships. Such individuals
have been particularly important during setbacks
(and there have been several setbacks!). I now
formally serve as a mentor in Shaw's mentor-pro
tege program, where I work with several staff on
helping them develop both technical and man
agement skills as they advance in our profession.

When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
ChemEng 20 (Intro to Chemical Engineering);
ChemEng 180 (Chemical I entered Stanford as a
declared chemical engineer but I originally want
ed to design my own major in "biochemical engi
neering" or "biotech engineering" that would
focus on applying chemical and mechanical
engineering principles (i.e., pharmacokinetics
and advanced materials selection) to solving bio
logical problems like cancer and asthma.
Biomedical engineering wasn't offered at
Stanford at the time and I was more into the
chemistry side than the biology side anyway. To
support this, I tried to take the Humßio track
while being a dual chemical and mechanical
engineering student (which was a huge mistake!).
I settled in as a true ChemE in my junior year
and decided to minor in mechanical engineer
ing.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
Once I completed a few courses in the Chemical
Engineering track, I realized that was where my
true passion lay. I'm a process-oriented guy and
so the ChemE major fit in very well with the way
my mind works. I'm really into the diagramming
and specification writing and figuring out how
you get from raw ingredients to finished prod
ucts.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I made it a point during my time at Stanford to
spend my summers doing non-engineering tasks.
I felt that I would spend a good portion of my
life doing the actual engineering work so my col
lege summers should be spent doing exciting,
interesting things with friends and family or I
made it a point to have "purposeful inactivity". I
described it as "Stanford Abroad for Engineers"
since the great programs that Stanford has for
Distance Learning don't really fit into the techie

curriculum. My choice had some benefits and
some setbacks. The good thing was that it
allowed me to detox myself from all of the
physics, chemistry, and engineering and focus on
non-engineering educational pursuits or commu
nity service (tutoring, coaching a little league
team) or just sleeping until noon and then play
ing video games until it was time to go play bas
ketball with friends. I also had the opportunity to
meet new people and just travel around the US
visiting friends I met at Stanford or family mem
bers in other states. The disadvantage is having
to explain to future employers during interviews
and at job fairs come senior year that you made
the decision to forgo engineering internships to
reconnect with the rest of the world.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after college was as an unpaid men
tor/tutor at the local YMCA in San Diego, CA. In
May 1998, I decided that I wasn't ready to start
the full grind as a degreed engineer just yet. I
turned down numerous chemical engineering job
offers from Bechtel, Schlumberger, and Proctor &
Gamble to take off the first six months after
graduation. I spent the summer/fall visiting fami-

My main advice for students is to use the
tools that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or
peers or family or community leaders/profes
sional engineers to shadow. It takes a well
rounded person to succeed in today's work
climate and everyone needs to be able to
communicate effectively with vendors or
clients or co-workers.

ly in Arkansas and teaching kids math, chemistry,
and ecology. It was the smartest career choice I
have made to date. So I started looking for a job
in January 1 999 and landed my first engineering
job after graduation as a chemical engineer at
General Atomics in San Diego, CA. General
Atomics uses a high temperature, high pressure
water process to destroy chemical weapons and
hazardous wastes. I found the job by sending
resumes online to everywhere you could imag
ine, by replying to every ChemE ad in all the
major newspapers, and attending multiple inter
views until I decided on General Atomics
because of the great opportunities I'd have there
to showcase my talents.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
At GA, my duties as a chemical engineer mostly
included preparing technical documentation,
reviewing process flow diagrams, vendor selec
tion for pumps and process subsystems, model
ing chemical reactions using computer software,
spare parts inventory, operation of a Supercritical
Water Oxidation (SCWO) reactor, producing
budgets and timelines, and I had the coolest
time preparing a marketing video for the plant
designed for destroying stockpiles of WWII
chemical agents stored near Lexington, Kentucky.
This included drafting a script, preparing a story
board, and directing video production company.
I had the best time because it was way more
than I expected!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
My career has been punctuated by me being in
the right place at the right time! At General
Atomics, the management was focused on bring
ing their main technology, SCWO, to the fore
front and so they put most of the staff on that
project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience
using all types of computer software, and my
technical writing skills. My interdisciplinary acad
emic background has given me the ability to per
ceive and understand not only the scientific side
of a given situation, but also the "human" aspect,
which is vital for effective problem solving. My
eagerness to accept new challenges is also an
asset that has benefited my career development.
Stanford presented me the opportunity to work in
cross-disciplinary teams so I'm open to all kinds
of ways of looking at a problem. My learning
and implementation of new technologies and my
experiences in the ChemE track of reorganizing
and reanalyzing data and database functions has
helped me to achieve improved yield manage
ment and operating efficiency for all of my pro
jects. But my greatest gift from Stanford is my
technical writing skills. I have been given a lot
more responsibilities because in the industries
I've worked in (hazardous wastes and now
renewable energy), being able to clearly express
what was done and what I saw is invaluable. All
of the copious note-taking and report writing at
Stanford has helped me carve out my own niche
in every company that I have been associated
with. My current boss, who is a non-engineer,
appreciates me being able to relay all of the
technical mumbo-jumbo we do in a way that
does not make him feel like I'm teaching an
upper division mathematics course on string the
ory.
Any advice for students?
My main advice for students is to use the tools
that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or peers
or family or community leaders/professional
engineers to shadow. It takes a well-rounded
person to succeed in today's work climate and
everyone needs to be able to communicate
effectively with vendors or clients or co-workers.
Also, students should think clearly about what
they want to do on a day-to-day basis and direct
their searches along those lines. I am a number
crunching, document drawing, techno-junkie. I

hate extended computer programming and cus
tomer service work and nonspecific tasks so I
found a job that fit my likes and avoided the stuff
that I disliked.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a chemical engineer at Changing World
Technologies and carry around a lot of different
hats since we're such a small company (less than
50 employees). Many of the tasks I described
above are still what I do today. For CWT, my pri
mary role is more of the analytical observer, new
idea researcher, and emerging technologies
reporter. I am also, more or less, the "Assistant
Technology Officer", to our CTO who lives in
Tacoma, WA. I will occasionally run an experi
ment manually at our pilot plant in Philadelphia
but more often than not, I'd rather have a techni
cian run the experiment, I observe his/her
progress, and then have him/her forward me all
of the information and I can "tell the story" my
way. For lack of a better term, I'm the official
CWT "documentarian". CWT was featured in the
May 2003 issue of Discover Magazine (full arti
cle at http://www.discover.com/may 03/
featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.

Yousra Tilden
Design and Construction Administration
South Bay Water Recycling Program
MS Civil Engineering—Water Resources,
Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)
Pump Stations Reliability project
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
•Design of the Silver Creek Development three
Pump Stations
•Design of Oracle Building Storm Water
Detention Basin
•Design of the relocation of the Hetch Hetchy
Pipelines across the Guadalupe River and
Coyote Creek
•Design and Construction Administration of the

Pipeline
•Program Management of the Pajaro Valley
Water Management Agency 48-inch, 22.2 miles
long Import Pipeline.

"Do what you like to do is the
secret of success."
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I have stayed in contact with my old bosses and
have been fortunate to make great friends along
the way. It is a very small community that I am
working with and it is important to keep a good
relationship with everyone around you. The best
way to get a new job is through networking and
getting the people who are in the business to
help you find that next job for you.

What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
Member of Ecology House (now Terrahouse)
theme coop. House Financial Manager for a
year. Participated in House-sponsored environ
mental awareness activities around campus.
Organized and facilitated first environmental
education class at Stanford. Member of Tau Beta
Pi (engineering honor society). Student counselor
for transfer students. Favorite classes were
CE160 (Water Resources Planning), CE170 (Man
and His Environment), CE171 (Environmental
Planning), EDU190 (Directed Research in
Education—the environmental education class I
mentioned above), OR152 (Introduction to
Operations Research) and SP1 11 (Third Year
Spanish).
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
I transferred to Stanford from Caltech as a
junior. Thus, my career plans had two years to
mature before the transfer. At Caltech, I first
majored in mathematics, then population biolo
gy, then environmental engineering. I transferred

to Stanford with an environmental engineering
focus to my interdisciplinary program in General
Engineering under Prof. Ralph Smith called
"Resource Strategy". The program was a broad
brush approach for understanding resource pro
duction, consumption, and environmental
impact. I thought that my career would somehow
relate to the nascent field of environmental
impact analysis.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
My basic interest in environmental sciences and
engineering did not change throughout my time
at Stanford, and upon graduation I still believed
I would somehow be working in the field of envi
ronmental impact analysis, such as in preparing
environmental impact statements/reports.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
In the summer before and after my junior year,
and throughout my junior year and part of my
senior year, I worked as the Student Relations
Representative for Bank of America at Stanford
Shopping Center (I had worked for Bank of
America since high school graduation). I had
many interesting experiences in this job; an
example was when a relatively wealthy student
inquired about the bank's investment policies in
South Africa (during these times of increasing
apartheid awareness) before he decided to open
his accounts with the bank, and I did a lot of
research to come up with the information he
wanted (incidentally, it did not bode well for the
Bank). After graduating in April 1974, I found a
unique and interesting job as a live-in assistant

gardener in an Atherton mansion as I awaited an
assignment in the Peace Corps. I found this
opportunity on the job posting bulletin board in
Tressider Union.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a rural works construction
engineer with the U.S. Peace Corps in the Fiji
Islands. I transferred my Peace Corps service to
Honduras after a year in Fiji to work for another
two years as Honduras' first environmental plan
ner, which was more suited to my academic
preparation and interest, and was a unique
opportunity with responsibilities that would other
wise be unavailable to me for many years in the
United States. Finding these jobs was not hard: I
merely applied to the Peace Corps and was
accepted.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
Peace Corps was a gratifying and maturing expe
rience for me (unlike for many volunteers), but
my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.

The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran

When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
ChemEng 20 (Intro to Chemical Engineering);
ChemEng 180 (Chemical I entered Stanford as a
declared chemical engineer but I originally want
ed to design my own major in "biochemical engi
neering" or "biotech engineering" that would
focus on applying chemical and mechanical
engineering principles (i.e., pharmacokinetics
and advanced materials selection) to solving bio
logical problems like cancer and asthma.
Biomedical engineering wasn't offered at
Stanford at the time and I was more into the
chemistry side than the biology side anyway. To
support this, I tried to take the Humßio track
while being a dual chemical and mechanical
engineering student (which was a huge mistake!).
I settled in as a true ChemE in my junior year
and decided to minor in mechanical engineer
ing.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
Once I completed a few courses in the Chemical
Engineering track, I realized that was where my
true passion lay. I'm a process-oriented guy and
so the ChemE major fit in very well with the way
my mind works. I'm really into the diagramming
and specification writing and figuring out how
you get from raw ingredients to finished prod
ucts.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I made it a point during my time at Stanford to
spend my summers doing non-engineering tasks.
I felt that I would spend a good portion of my
life doing the actual engineering work so my col
lege summers should be spent doing exciting,
interesting things with friends and family or I
made it a point to have "purposeful inactivity". I
described it as "Stanford Abroad for Engineers"
since the great programs that Stanford has for
Distance Learning don't really fit into the techie

curriculum. My choice had some benefits and
some setbacks. The good thing was that it
allowed me to detox myself from all of the
physics, chemistry, and engineering and focus on
non-engineering educational pursuits or commu
nity service (tutoring, coaching a little league
team) or just sleeping until noon and then play
ing video games until it was time to go play bas
ketball with friends. I also had the opportunity to
meet new people and just travel around the US
visiting friends I met at Stanford or family mem
bers in other states. The disadvantage is having
to explain to future employers during interviews
and at job fairs come senior year that you made
the decision to forgo engineering internships to
reconnect with the rest of the world.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after college was as an unpaid men
tor/tutor at the local YMCA in San Diego, CA. In
May 1998, I decided that I wasn't ready to start
the full grind as a degreed engineer just yet. I
turned down numerous chemical engineering job
offers from Bechtel, Schlumberger, and Proctor &
Gamble to take off the first six months after
graduation. I spent the summer/fall visiting fami-

My main advice for students is to use the
tools that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or
peers or family or community leaders/profes
sional engineers to shadow. It takes a well
rounded person to succeed in today's work
climate and everyone needs to be able to
communicate effectively with vendors or
clients or co-workers.

ly in Arkansas and teaching kids math, chemistry,
and ecology. It was the smartest career choice I
have made to date. So I started looking for a job
in January 1 999 and landed my first engineering
job after graduation as a chemical engineer at
General Atomics in San Diego, CA. General
Atomics uses a high temperature, high pressure
water process to destroy chemical weapons and
hazardous wastes. I found the job by sending
resumes online to everywhere you could imag
ine, by replying to every ChemE ad in all the
major newspapers, and attending multiple inter
views until I decided on General Atomics
because of the great opportunities I'd have there
to showcase my talents.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
At GA, my duties as a chemical engineer mostly
included preparing technical documentation,
reviewing process flow diagrams, vendor selec
tion for pumps and process subsystems, model
ing chemical reactions using computer software,
spare parts inventory, operation of a Supercritical
Water Oxidation (SCWO) reactor, producing
budgets and timelines, and I had the coolest
time preparing a marketing video for the plant
designed for destroying stockpiles of WWII
chemical agents stored near Lexington, Kentucky.
This included drafting a script, preparing a story
board, and directing video production company.
I had the best time because it was way more
than I expected!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
My career has been punctuated by me being in
the right place at the right time! At General
Atomics, the management was focused on bring
ing their main technology, SCWO, to the fore
front and so they put most of the staff on that
project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience
using all types of computer software, and my
technical writing skills. My interdisciplinary acad
emic background has given me the ability to per
ceive and understand not only the scientific side
of a given situation, but also the "human" aspect,
which is vital for effective problem solving. My
eagerness to accept new challenges is also an
asset that has benefited my career development.
Stanford presented me the opportunity to work in
cross-disciplinary teams so I'm open to all kinds
of ways of looking at a problem. My learning
and implementation of new technologies and my
experiences in the ChemE track of reorganizing
and reanalyzing data and database functions has
helped me to achieve improved yield manage
ment and operating efficiency for all of my pro
jects. But my greatest gift from Stanford is my
technical writing skills. I have been given a lot
more responsibilities because in the industries
I've worked in (hazardous wastes and now
renewable energy), being able to clearly express
what was done and what I saw is invaluable. All
of the copious note-taking and report writing at
Stanford has helped me carve out my own niche
in every company that I have been associated
with. My current boss, who is a non-engineer,
appreciates me being able to relay all of the
technical mumbo-jumbo we do in a way that
does not make him feel like I'm teaching an
upper division mathematics course on string the
ory.
Any advice for students?
My main advice for students is to use the tools
that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or peers
or family or community leaders/professional
engineers to shadow. It takes a well-rounded
person to succeed in today's work climate and
everyone needs to be able to communicate
effectively with vendors or clients or co-workers.
Also, students should think clearly about what
they want to do on a day-to-day basis and direct
their searches along those lines. I am a number
crunching, document drawing, techno-junkie. I

hate extended computer programming and cus
tomer service work and nonspecific tasks so I
found a job that fit my likes and avoided the stuff
that I disliked.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a chemical engineer at Changing World
Technologies and carry around a lot of different
hats since we're such a small company (less than
50 employees). Many of the tasks I described
above are still what I do today. For CWT, my pri
mary role is more of the analytical observer, new
idea researcher, and emerging technologies
reporter. I am also, more or less, the "Assistant
Technology Officer", to our CTO who lives in
Tacoma, WA. I will occasionally run an experi
ment manually at our pilot plant in Philadelphia
but more often than not, I'd rather have a techni
cian run the experiment, I observe his/her
progress, and then have him/her forward me all
of the information and I can "tell the story" my
way. For lack of a better term, I'm the official
CWT "documentarian". CWT was featured in the
May 2003 issue of Discover Magazine (full arti
cle at http://www.discover.com/may 03/
featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.

Design and Construction Administration
South Bay Water Recycling Program
MS Civil Engineering—Water Resources,
Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)
Pump Stations Reliability project
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
•Design of the Silver Creek Development three
Pump Stations
•Design of Oracle Building Storm Water
Detention Basin
•Design of the relocation of the Hetch Hetchy
Pipelines across the Guadalupe River and
Coyote Creek
•Design and Construction Administration of the
SBWRP 60-inch, 15,000 feet long Transmission
Pipeline
•Program Management of the Pajaro Valley
Water Management Agency 48-inch, 22.2 miles
long Import Pipeline.

"Do what you like to do is the
secret of success."
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I have stayed in contact with my old bosses and
have been fortunate to make great friends along
the way. It is a very small community that I am
working with and it is important to keep a good
relationship with everyone around you. The best
way to get a new job is through networking and
getting the people who are in the business to
help you find that next job for you.

What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
Member of Ecology House (now Terrahouse)
theme coop. House Financial Manager for a
year. Participated in House-sponsored environ
mental awareness activities around campus.
Organized and facilitated first environmental
education class at Stanford. Member of Tau Beta
Pi (engineering honor society). Student counselor
for transfer students. Favorite classes were
CE160 (Water Resources Planning), CE170 (Man
and His Environment), CE171 (Environmental
Planning), EDU190 (Directed Research in
Education—the environmental education class I
mentioned above), OR152 (Introduction to
Operations Research) and SP1 11 (Third Year
Spanish).
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
I transferred to Stanford from Caltech as a
junior. Thus, my career plans had two years to
mature before the transfer. At Caltech, I first
majored in mathematics, then population biolo
gy, then environmental engineering. I transferred

to Stanford with an environmental engineering
focus to my interdisciplinary program in General
Engineering under Prof. Ralph Smith called
"Resource Strategy". The program was a broad
brush approach for understanding resource pro
duction, consumption, and environmental
impact. I thought that my career would somehow
relate to the nascent field of environmental
impact analysis.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
My basic interest in environmental sciences and
engineering did not change throughout my time
at Stanford, and upon graduation I still believed
I would somehow be working in the field of envi
ronmental impact analysis, such as in preparing
environmental impact statements/reports.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
In the summer before and after my junior year,
and throughout my junior year and part of my
senior year, I worked as the Student Relations
Representative for Bank of America at Stanford
Shopping Center (I had worked for Bank of
America since high school graduation). I had
many interesting experiences in this job; an
example was when a relatively wealthy student
inquired about the bank's investment policies in
South Africa (during these times of increasing
apartheid awareness) before he decided to open
his accounts with the bank, and I did a lot of
research to come up with the information he
wanted (incidentally, it did not bode well for the
Bank). After graduating in April 1974, I found a
unique and interesting job as a live-in assistant

skills rather than course preparation that exactly
matches their needs."

gardener in an Atherton mansion as I awaited an
assignment in the Peace Corps. I found this
opportunity on the job posting bulletin board in
Tressider Union.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a rural works construction
engineer with the U.S. Peace Corps in the Fiji
Islands. I transferred my Peace Corps service to
Honduras after a year in Fiji to work for another
two years as Honduras' first environmental plan
ner, which was more suited to my academic
preparation and interest, and was a unique
opportunity with responsibilities that would other
wise be unavailable to me for many years in the
United States. Finding these jobs was not hard: I
merely applied to the Peace Corps and was
accepted.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
Peace Corps was a gratifying and maturing expe
rience for me (unlike for many volunteers), but
my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.
Any advice for students?
The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran
scripts for evaluating probability of success.
Conversely, do not be discouraged if you cannot

find a job that directly relates to your academic
background. Many companies look more to
strong motivation, broad interests and communi
cation skills rather than course preparation that
exactly matches their needs.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a senior manager in an environmental con
sulting firm specializing in hazardous waste site
investigation and remediation. I direct both tech
nical and administrative staff in meeting client
project needs (this usually means meeting project
deadline and budget constraints). I also have
responsibility for developing business with both
existing and potential clients primarily in the utili
ties sector. A typical project would be where an
environmental regulatory agency has imposed a
cleanup order on our client. The client is then
legally obligated to develop and implement
plans for establishing the nature and extent of
soil or groundwater contamination at their site,
and after so doing, cleaning up the contamina
tion. The client hires us to meet their regulatory
obligations at minimum cost.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
I have already mentioned my first assignment
after Stanford was the Peace Corps. After the
extreme adversities I faced in the Peace Corps
(as Peace Corps volunteers commonly face), I felt
I could do practically anything--a feeling that
was to be constantly tested in an 8 1/2-year
doctoral program (my thesis committee disband
ed after my fifth year, and I had to complete vir
tually a new thesis in the next 3 1/2 years). After
finally finding my first permanent environmental
consulting job several months after being award
ed my doctorate, I successfully managed a num
ber projects of the $300K magnitude and pub
lished a couple articles in technical journals. This
led to a second job of increased responsibility
managing projects up to $IMM in magnitude
and working more directly with a variety of client
representatives (including legal counsel). I also
provided expert witness testimony on two contro
versial cases. After five years with this firm, and
based on my academic specialty of statistics, I
free-lanced for two years with clients who needed

my expertise. I then accepted a first assignment
with my current company, Shaw Environmental,
Inc., as the Technical Manager for the San
Francisco Presidio Environmental Restoration
Project, where I directed approximately 50 pro
fessional staff. This led to additional program
management assignments with key clients, where
I have been responsible for projects up to
$2.3 MM. In addition, I continue to provide
expert witness testimony, including testifying
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I might be unusual in that "networking" per se
has not been critical to my success. It seems that
most of my accomplishments were self-inspired,
although they have also been recognized by key
individuals. However, throughout my career,
there have been people who I have admired,
who served as mentors, and with whom I devel
oped satisfying relationships. Such individuals
have been particularly important during setbacks
(and there have been several setbacks!). I now
formally serve as a mentor in Shaw's mentor-pro
tege program, where I work with several staff on
helping them develop both technical and man
agement skills as they advance in our profession.

project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience
using all types of computer software, and my
technical writing skills. My interdisciplinary acad
emic background has given me the ability to per
ceive and understand not only the scientific side
of a given situation, but also the "human" aspect,
which is vital for effective problem solving. My
eagerness to accept new challenges is also an
asset that has benefited my career development.
Stanford presented me the opportunity to work in
cross-disciplinary teams so I'm open to all kinds
of ways of looking at a problem. My learning
and implementation of new technologies and my
experiences in the ChemE track of reorganizing
and reanalyzing data and database functions has
helped me to achieve improved yield manage
ment and operating efficiency for all of my pro
jects. But my greatest gift from Stanford is my
technical writing skills. I have been given a lot
more responsibilities because in the industries
I've worked in (hazardous wastes and now
renewable energy), being able to clearly express
what was done and what I saw is invaluable. All
of the copious note-taking and report writing at
Stanford has helped me carve out my own niche
in every company that I have been associated
with. My current boss, who is a non-engineer,
appreciates me being able to relay all of the
technical mumbo-jumbo we do in a way that
does not make him feel like I'm teaching an
upper division mathematics course on string the
ory.
Any advice for students?
My main advice for students is to use the tools
that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or peers
or family or community leaders/professional
engineers to shadow. It takes a well-rounded
person to succeed in today's work climate and
everyone needs to be able to communicate
effectively with vendors or clients or co-workers.
Also, students should think clearly about what
they want to do on a day-to-day basis and direct
their searches along those lines. I am a number
crunching, document drawing, techno-junkie. I

hate extended computer programming and cus
tomer service work and nonspecific tasks so I
found a job that fit my likes and avoided the stuff
that I disliked.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a chemical engineer at Changing World
Technologies and carry around a lot of different
hats since we're such a small company (less than
50 employees). Many of the tasks I described
above are still what I do today. For CWT, my pri
mary role is more of the analytical observer, new
idea researcher, and emerging technologies
reporter. I am also, more or less, the "Assistant
Technology Officer", to our CTO who lives in
Tacoma, WA. I will occasionally run an experi
ment manually at our pilot plant in Philadelphia
but more often than not, I'd rather have a techni
cian run the experiment, I observe his/her
progress, and then have him/her forward me all
of the information and I can "tell the story" my
way. For lack of a better term, I'm the official
CWT "documentarian". CWT was featured in the
May 2003 issue of Discover Magazine (full arti
cle at http://www.discover.com/may 03/
featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.

Yousra Tilden
Design and Construction Administration
South Bay Water Recycling Program
MS Civil Engineering—Water Resources,
Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)
Pump Stations Reliability project
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
•Design of the Silver Creek Development three
Pump Stations
•Design of Oracle Building Storm Water
Detention Basin
•Design of the relocation of the Hetch Hetchy
Pipelines across the Guadalupe River and
Coyote Creek
•Design and Construction Administration of the
SBWRP 60-inch, 15,000 feet long Transmission
Pipeline
•Program Management of the Pajaro Valley
Water Management Agency 48-inch, 22.2 miles
long Import Pipeline.

"Do what you like to do is the
secret of success."
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I have stayed in contact with my old bosses and
have been fortunate to make great friends along
the way. It is a very small community that I am
working with and it is important to keep a good
relationship with everyone around you. The best
way to get a new job is through networking and
getting the people who are in the business to
help you find that next job for you.

Harvard University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
Member of Ecology House (now Terrahouse)
theme coop. House Financial Manager for a
year. Participated in House-sponsored environ
mental awareness activities around campus.
Organized and facilitated first environmental
education class at Stanford. Member of Tau Beta
Pi (engineering honor society). Student counselor
for transfer students. Favorite classes were
CE160 (Water Resources Planning), CE170 (Man
and His Environment), CE171 (Environmental
Planning), EDU190 (Directed Research in
Education—the environmental education class I
mentioned above), OR152 (Introduction to
Operations Research) and SP1 11 (Third Year
Spanish).
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
I transferred to Stanford from Caltech as a
junior. Thus, my career plans had two years to
mature before the transfer. At Caltech, I first
majored in mathematics, then population biolo
gy, then environmental engineering. I transferred

to Stanford with an environmental engineering
focus to my interdisciplinary program in General
Engineering under Prof. Ralph Smith called
"Resource Strategy". The program was a broad
brush approach for understanding resource pro
duction, consumption, and environmental
impact. I thought that my career would somehow
relate to the nascent field of environmental
impact analysis.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
My basic interest in environmental sciences and
engineering did not change throughout my time
at Stanford, and upon graduation I still believed
I would somehow be working in the field of envi
ronmental impact analysis, such as in preparing
environmental impact statements/reports.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
In the summer before and after my junior year,
and throughout my junior year and part of my
senior year, I worked as the Student Relations
Representative for Bank of America at Stanford
Shopping Center (I had worked for Bank of
America since high school graduation). I had
many interesting experiences in this job; an
example was when a relatively wealthy student
inquired about the bank's investment policies in
South Africa (during these times of increasing
apartheid awareness) before he decided to open
his accounts with the bank, and I did a lot of
research to come up with the information he
wanted (incidentally, it did not bode well for the
Bank). After graduating in April 1974, I found a
unique and interesting job as a live-in assistant

motivation, broad interests and communication
skills rather than course preparation that exactly
matches their needs."

gardener in an Atherton mansion as I awaited an
assignment in the Peace Corps. I found this
opportunity on the job posting bulletin board in
Tressider Union.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a rural works construction
engineer with the U.S. Peace Corps in the Fiji
Islands. I transferred my Peace Corps service to
Honduras after a year in Fiji to work for another
two years as Honduras' first environmental plan
ner, which was more suited to my academic
preparation and interest, and was a unique
opportunity with responsibilities that would other
wise be unavailable to me for many years in the
United States. Finding these jobs was not hard: I
merely applied to the Peace Corps and was
accepted.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
Peace Corps was a gratifying and maturing expe
rience for me (unlike for many volunteers), but
my first U.S. career-related job was after the first
year of my doctoral program at Harvard. I hap
pened to be in the right place at the right time:
an environmental consulting firm owned by the
professors in my environmental systems analysis
graduate department had the need for someone
who spoke fluent Spanish to obtain data in the
rural areas of Peru on energy production and
consumption as part of a U.S.-Peru comparative
energy assessment being conducted under con
tract to Brookhaven National Laboratory. My
environmental engineering background at
Stanford, my service in the Peace Corps, and my
fluency in Spanish immediately landed me the
four-month assignment. It was more than I could
have expected so early in my career. I even got
some time off to trek in Machu Picchu!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
Finding my first job in environmental consulting
after obtaining my doctorate was a frustrating
experience. First, I wanted to return to California,
and applying for jobs in California from
Massachusetts was not easy. Second, I did not
have direct working experience in hazardous
waste management, which was the focus of my
doctoral program, yet I was already at too high
a level based on my academic credentials to
obtain entry-level field work positions. After
about 20 "you have excellent qualifications, but
at this time we do not have a position that
matches your capabilities", one relatively young
and small firm took the risk on me and hired me
as a Project Manager. The risk was well calculat
ed and I served them well for three years. This
experience was a springboard for two additional
career advancements over the next nine years
into my current position as Senior Project
Manager and Sector Lead for Shaw
Environmental, Inc.
What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
It is hard to pinpoint specific "skills/experiences"
from Stanford that have been important in my
career development, but generally, a degree
from Stanford (as well as from Harvard) has
been a key to opening many doors throughout
my career. Fortunately, the classes I took in envi
ronmental sciences and engineering at both
Stanford and Harvard have been very useful in
preparing me for many of the technical chal
lenges in my profession. However, it seems that
conquering "administrative" or "management"
challenges during my career could only come
with post-graduate time and experience.
Any advice for students?
The best advice I can offer to current students is
to do as well as you can in your classes, because
most first job opportunities (not to mention grad
uate school opportunities) rely partly on tran
scripts for evaluating probability of success.
Conversely, do not be discouraged if you cannot

find a job that directly relates to your academic
background. Many companies look more to
strong motivation, broad interests and communi
cation skills rather than course preparation that
exactly matches their needs.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.?
I am a senior manager in an environmental con
sulting firm specializing in hazardous waste site
investigation and remediation. I direct both tech
nical and administrative staff in meeting client
project needs (this usually means meeting project
deadline and budget constraints). I also have
responsibility for developing business with both
existing and potential clients primarily in the utili
ties sector. A typical project would be where an
environmental regulatory agency has imposed a
cleanup order on our client. The client is then
legally obligated to develop and implement
plans for establishing the nature and extent of
soil or groundwater contamination at their site,
and after so doing, cleaning up the contamina
tion. The client hires us to meet their regulatory
obligations at minimum cost.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
I have already mentioned my first assignment
after Stanford was the Peace Corps. After the
extreme adversities I faced in the Peace Corps
(as Peace Corps volunteers commonly face), I felt
I could do practically anything--a feeling that
was to be constantly tested in an 8 1/2-year
doctoral program (my thesis committee disband
ed after my fifth year, and I had to complete vir
tually a new thesis in the next 3 1/2 years). After
finally finding my first permanent environmental
consulting job several months after being award
ed my doctorate, I successfully managed a num
ber projects of the $300K magnitude and pub
lished a couple articles in technical journals. This
led to a second job of increased responsibility
managing projects up to $IMM in magnitude
and working more directly with a variety of client
representatives (including legal counsel). I also
provided expert witness testimony on two contro
versial cases. After five years with this firm, and
based on my academic specialty of statistics, I
free-lanced for two years with clients who needed

my expertise. I then accepted a first assignment
with my current company, Shaw Environmental,
Inc., as the Technical Manager for the San
Francisco Presidio Environmental Restoration
Project, where I directed approximately 50 pro
fessional staff. This led to additional program
management assignments with key clients, where
I have been responsible for projects up to
$2.3 MM. In addition, I continue to provide
expert witness testimony, including testifying
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
If you have not already addressed this; how
has networking or being mentored
shaped/helped your career?
I might be unusual in that "networking" per se
has not been critical to my success. It seems that
most of my accomplishments were self-inspired,
although they have also been recognized by key
individuals. However, throughout my career,
there have been people who I have admired,
who served as mentors, and with whom I devel
oped satisfying relationships. Such individuals
have been particularly important during setbacks
(and there have been several setbacks!). I now
formally serve as a mentor in Shaw's mentor-pro
tege program, where I work with several staff on
helping them develop both technical and man
agement skills as they advance in our profession.

When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
ChemEng 20 (Intro to Chemical Engineering);
ChemEng 180 (Chemical I entered Stanford as a
declared chemical engineer but I originally want
ed to design my own major in "biochemical engi
neering" or "biotech engineering" that would
focus on applying chemical and mechanical
engineering principles (i.e., pharmacokinetics
and advanced materials selection) to solving bio
logical problems like cancer and asthma.
Biomedical engineering wasn't offered at
Stanford at the time and I was more into the
chemistry side than the biology side anyway. To
support this, I tried to take the Humßio track
while being a dual chemical and mechanical
engineering student (which was a huge mistake!).
I settled in as a true ChemE in my junior year
and decided to minor in mechanical engineer
ing.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
Once I completed a few courses in the Chemical
Engineering track, I realized that was where my
true passion lay. I'm a process-oriented guy and
so the ChemE major fit in very well with the way
my mind works. I'm really into the diagramming
and specification writing and figuring out how
you get from raw ingredients to finished prod
ucts.
What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I made it a point during my time at Stanford to
spend my summers doing non-engineering tasks.
I felt that I would spend a good portion of my
life doing the actual engineering work so my col
lege summers should be spent doing exciting,
interesting things with friends and family or I
made it a point to have "purposeful inactivity". I
described it as "Stanford Abroad for Engineers"
since the great programs that Stanford has for
Distance Learning don't really fit into the techie

curriculum. My choice had some benefits and
some setbacks. The good thing was that it
allowed me to detox myself from all of the
physics, chemistry, and engineering and focus on
non-engineering educational pursuits or commu
nity service (tutoring, coaching a little league
team) or just sleeping until noon and then play
ing video games until it was time to go play bas
ketball with friends. I also had the opportunity to
meet new people and just travel around the US
visiting friends I met at Stanford or family mem
bers in other states. The disadvantage is having
to explain to future employers during interviews
and at job fairs come senior year that you made
the decision to forgo engineering internships to
reconnect with the rest of the world.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after college was as an unpaid men
tor/tutor at the local YMCA in San Diego, CA. In
May 1998, I decided that I wasn't ready to start
the full grind as a degreed engineer just yet. I
turned down numerous chemical engineering job
offers from Bechtel, Schlumberger, and Proctor &
Gamble to take off the first six months after
graduation. I spent the summer/fall visiting fami-

tools that are at their disposal. Be it alumni or

clients or co-workers.

ly in Arkansas and teaching kids math, chemistry,
and ecology. It was the smartest career choice I
have made to date. So I started looking for a job
in January 1 999 and landed my first engineering
job after graduation as a chemical engineer at
General Atomics in San Diego, CA. General
Atomics uses a high temperature, high pressure
water process to destroy chemical weapons and
hazardous wastes. I found the job by sending
resumes online to everywhere you could imag
ine, by replying to every ChemE ad in all the
major newspapers, and attending multiple inter
views until I decided on General Atomics
because of the great opportunities I'd have there
to showcase my talents.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
At GA, my duties as a chemical engineer mostly
included preparing technical documentation,
reviewing process flow diagrams, vendor selec
tion for pumps and process subsystems, model
ing chemical reactions using computer software,
spare parts inventory, operation of a Supercritical
Water Oxidation (SCWO) reactor, producing
budgets and timelines, and I had the coolest
time preparing a marketing video for the plant
designed for destroying stockpiles of WWII
chemical agents stored near Lexington, Kentucky.
This included drafting a script, preparing a story
board, and directing video production company.
I had the best time because it was way more
than I expected!
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
My career has been punctuated by me being in
the right place at the right time! At General
Atomics, the management was focused on bring
ing their main technology, SCWO, to the fore
front and so they put most of the staff on that
project. When I came in, I was assigned to work
on one of the lesser, low-profile projects that
required that we destroy all of the miscellaneous
wood, plastics, and wastes associated with the
chemical agent-filled rockets and drums. I was
bummed at first because I wanted to be in the
limelight with the main technology instead of get
ting rid of wooden crates and old decontamina
tion suits but my project allowed me to do a
whole lot more than my counterparts. I got to
pick wood shredding equipment and plastics
grinders and take about six vendor site trips
around the country to test various systems. My
immediate supervisor was very bad at using a
computer so I got to write everything and he just
redlined it. My peers in the company were pretty
much stagnant, watching a computer screen
monitoring a fully-automated system. I, however,
got to do all of the budgeting, technical and
safety review, and my thorough work on this first
project allowed me to be promoted after just 2
years to be the engineering task lead for design
ing a chemical agent neutralization system.
I left GA after 3 years to move to Ohio to be
with my then girlfriend (now wife) who had just
finished her degree at Stanford, but less than a
month after my move, one of my old mentors
from GA gave me a call about the company that
I now work for. He said that Changing World
Technologies could use a young, go-getter like
myself and that he could arrange for me to inter
view with the CWT management. I interviewed
and was offered a job one week later! My girl
friend was not happy about it since we had been
dating long distance for a year at that point
already but CWT was an opportunity that I could
not afford to miss. Mentoring has been key to my
career development and it is so essential that

young students learn to network with people who
are in the positions that they might want to be
someday.

The most important skills that I've carried with me
from Stanford are my adaptability, my experience

featoil.html), the June 2003 issue of Money
Magazine, various newspaper articles, and were
named one of Scientific American's "50
Contributors to Scientific Advancement" in
December 2003 and are creating a buzz in the
scientific and political community. Using our pro
prietary Thermal Conversion Process (TCP), we
can convert near about any carbon-rich waste
stream (old tires, municipal sewage, plastics,
dead turkey parts, agricultural wastes, medical
wastes, biological agents and pathogens like
anthrax and mad cow disease) into valuable
resources, namely, high-grade oil, fuel gas, min
erals, fatty acids, and fine carbon particles like
the kind you'd find in your HP printer. Our first
plant (a 200 TPD joint venture with ConAgra
Foods for processing turkey feathers, bones,
blood, fats, guts, etc.) is operating in Carthage,
Missouri and we have ten more plants 'in the
pipeline' for the next few years. Besides pursuing
our agricultural ventures with ConAgra, we're
currently in talks with the City of Philadelphia in
processing their municipal sewage sludge, with a
major tire company to process their post-con
sumer tires, and with a major automotive corpo
ration to handle their auto shredder residue.
