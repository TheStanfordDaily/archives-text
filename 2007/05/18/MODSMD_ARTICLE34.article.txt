Yousra Tilden
Design and Construction Administration
South Bay Water Recycling Program
MS Civil Engineering—Water Resources,
Stanford University
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join
clubs or student organizations? What did
you study? What were your favorite classes?
I was not involved in any activity. As a graduate
student, at least for me, I spent much less time in
school than I used at my undergrad school. My
favorite classes were Closed Conduit Design and
a class I took which dealt with perception and
personalities and such. A very interesting class
that had nothing to do with engineering.
When you first started at Stanford, did you
have any thoughts about your career plans?
If so, what were those thoughts?
By the time you are a graduate student you
would hope that you have a good idea what
your career plans are. I wanted to specialize in
hydraulics and water resources and that is why I
chose that masters degree.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve
while you were at Stanford?
hey did not change but I became 100% percent
sure that I would not like to go into research or
teaching.

What did you do with your summers? Did
you work? Did you have any interesting
experiences? How did you find those experi
ences?
I was in Stanford for one year (Sept-June). The
summer before I was going to undergrad school
and the summer after I started working.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job was as a junior engineer. One of my
Stanford professors announced it in class and I
contacted the company owner and the rest is his
tory.
What did you do at your first job? Was it
what you expected?
It was a very small company (2 people, including
me). I had the opportunity to do everything from
entering data, answering the phone to doing
design and preparing Environmental Impact
Reports. It was not what I expected but it gave a
good flavor of what engineering is all about. I
think young engineers, in general, think that they
will be designing the Golden Gate Bridge the
day after they leave school and do not realize
that there is a lot of other things that you area
not taught in school that you need to learn and
do in order for an engineering project to be
done. There is a lot of writing and communica
tion.
How did your career evolve after that? How
did your experiences lead to other opportu
nities?
The work that I did at my first job helped me in
focusing on water resources projects and my
second job was more geared towards that. By
having years of experience all of a sudden you
are considered a expert in your field and my
experiences have led to me getting projects, and
later jobs that I am interested in.

What skills/experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I think the skill that is most helpful is communi
cation skills and working as a team member.
Any advice for students?
Keep your options open and do not limit your
self. Just because you got your degree in some
thing does not mean you cannot excel and be
successful in very different facets. Do what you
like to do is the secret of excellence.
Can you provide a brief description of the
work you do and examples of typical
task/projects.
I am a civil Engineer working as a project
manger. My responsibilities include project man
agement, planning, design and construction
administration of water resources projects. For
example I am responsible for the design and
construction management of two sewer pipelines
under Highway 87. I am also responsible for
design and construction administration of the
South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWRP)
Pump Stations Reliability project
Can you provide a brief chronology of your
career - probably the major projects or turn
ing points?
•Design of the Silver Creek Development three
Pump Stations
•Design of Oracle Building Storm Water
Detention Basin
•Design of the relocation of the Hetch Hetchy
Pipelines across the Guadalupe River and
Coyote Creek
•Design and Construction Administration of the
SBWRP 60-inch, 15,000 feet long Transmission
Pipeline
•Program Management of the Pajaro Valley
Water Management Agency 48-inch, 22.2 miles
long Import Pipeline.

secret of success."
