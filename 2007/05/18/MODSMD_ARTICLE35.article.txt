# Energy Efficiency Engineering: Hobby and Career?
## 
### 
Nearly 40% of all energy consumed in the U.S. is used by
buildings, accounting for carbon dioxide emissions approxi
mately equal to the combined emissions of Japan, the U.K.,
and France. As of 2001, about 70% of all buildings were over
22 years old. In this age of sophisticated building controls and
energy efficiency, these facts highlight our responsibility to

reevaluate energy use in old buildings, optimize building con
trols, and reengineer building systems whenever feasible.
"One of the questions 1 routinely asked myself was, how can
I use my engineering skills to tackle energy efficiency and cli
mate change challenges, beyond my days at Stanford?" says
Abhijit Rao (MSME '06). Abhijit is one among the growing
team of Stanford graduates working at Cogent Energy, a lead
ing provider of energy engineering services in the Southwest.
Another member, Michael Daukoru (MSME '07), says"I
wanted to work in consulting because it offers variety, and that
makes every day at work a new challenge."
Working as an engineering consultant in the energy efficien
cy service industry can be extremely rewarding as one learns to
wear many hats and is constantly challenged. Generally speak
ing an energy consultant's work can be divided into three
broad areas - energy audits, design and commissioning.
Very simply put, an energy audit is a study of all systems
that utilize energy in a facility and identify opportunities to
reduce the energy use. These can range from a preliminary sur
vey of a dairy, to complex optimization studies necessitating a
3D model of a 5,000,000 sq. ft campus which can easily take 24

hours to run. Design projects entail developing drawings and
specifications to upgrade to upgrade inefficient mechanical and
control systems to optimize their performance. Commissioning
is the process of ensuring that the installed building systems
operate per their design intent and may include measurement
and verification to ensure persistence of energy savings.
This brief glimpse into energy engineering reveals the chal
lenges that new graduates face in their attempts to become ener
gy professionals. A good resource is the Pacific Energy Center
(www.pge.com/pec), which conducts a series of seminars for
energy professionals. This is a good place not only for learning
but also for networking with industry experts. Also, interested
students should take steps to get licensed with the State, since
this improves their eligibility for employment with a consulting
firm.
