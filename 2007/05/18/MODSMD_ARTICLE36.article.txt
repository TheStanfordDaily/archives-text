# Get an education to be green
## 
### Connie Blaszczyk MONSTER STAFF WRITER 
"Creating a sustainable economy and
society requires a complex mix of ecologi
cal content knowledge, political ability,
legal savvy, financial understanding and
managerial skill," says Kevin Doyle,
national director of program development
for the Environmental Careers
Organization (ECO), a national nonprofit
group offering paid internships and fellow
ships since 1972.
In other words, it takes a well-stocked
village of educated professionals to create
and sustain a healthy environment. While
some have a very specific knowledge-set,
many environmental jobs require a broader
knowledge base, says Lisa Yee-Litzenberg,
a career counselor to more than 350 gradu
ate students at the University of Michigan,
School of Natural Resources and
Environment.
According to Yee-Litzenberg, "It's
important to have a well-rounded skill-set,"
including:
• Teamwork Skills: An ability to work with
multidisciplinary teams (such as scientists,
policy leaders, business leaders, etc.).
• Strong Communication Skills: An ability
to convey complex or technical issues to the
general public. Experience with TV, radio
and print media is helpful, too.
• Creative Problem-Solving Skills: When
something goes wrong (and it can), you
need to be able to switch gears quickly and
creatively.
• Bridge-Building Skills: A demonstrated
ability to build effective working relation
ships with partner organizations — includ
ing unlikely allies.
• Time-Management Skills: An ability to
successfully manage multiple projects.
• Project-Management Skills: Developing
and implementing a project plan, managing
and motivating staff, fundraising and expe
rience developing a budget are key skills.
• A Capacity for Vision: This refers to both
short- and long-term organizational vision.
• Leadership Skills: Past experience serving
in leadership roles inspires confidence in
your ability to take on new leadership
roles.
• Technical Skills: A relevant set of techni
cal skills (such as GIS mapping, ecological
design, watershed planning, plant identifi
cation, life-cycle analysis, etc.) through
your educational background and profes
sional training.
Graduate Degrees for Green
"Fortunately, many universities have
developed interdisciplinary, professionally
focused master's programs to educate pro
fessionals and leaders who can create sus
tainability results in the real world," says
Doyle.
Doyle specifically mentions four mas
ter's programs that earn high marks from
leading employers.
• School of Natural Resources and
Environment, University of Michigan
• The Nicholas School of the Environment

at Duke University
• Yale School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies
• Bren School of the Environmental
Science, University of California, Santa
Barbara
"No matter which school you select, do
yourself a favor and check out the curricu
lum and structure of these professionally
oriented degree programs," he says.
What About an MBA?
Another rapidly emerging possibility for
aspiring sustainability leaders is a green
MBA. Business schools throughout the
nation are adding green classes and profes
sional tracks, according to ECO.
Doyle notes that a few leaders at the
master's level include Stanford, Notre
Dame, George Washington, Michigan,
North Carolina, Cornell, Wake Forest and
UC Berkeley. "But things are changing for
the better so quickly that it's really hard to
create a meaningful ranking," he adds. No
matter which B-school you choose, all seri
ous students who want to pursue environ
mental careers should get involved with the
campus chapter of Net Impact, a nonprofit
networking group aimed at helping business
students, professors and schools go green.
For those with a more focused interest in
fields like fisheries, wildlife management
and ecology, Doyle urges students to check
out the rapidly growing field of conserva
tion biology — either as a separate field or
as focus within a traditional disciplinary
degree program.
Undergrad Programs
If you're interested in undergraduate
environmental studies programs, the best
ones are all members of the Council of
Environmental Deans and Directors
(CEDD). The organization's Web site
offers a green careers brochure that con
tains a long list of green job titles and other
online resources.
Find Your Career Focus
What are you going to do with your
degree once you have it? How can you con
nect the dots between what you studied and
a paycheck?
Yee-Litzenberg recommends students
follow their passion and then narrow their
interest area based on their experience and
skills. For example, she likes to hear stu
dents be as specific as possible about their
career goals: "I would like to work for a
nonprofit organization in California doing
advocacy work to protect endangered
species" or "I would like to use my business
background to work for a global environ
mental consulting firm to create energy
efficiency solutions."
Yee-Litzenberg also suggests you iden
tify three or four organizations that fit
your search criteria, and then create the
means to get your foot in the door,
whether it be through an internship,
alumni contact, event, application for a
specific job, etc. It may be helpful to
identify a staff person within the organi
zation and then set up a 20- to 30-minute
informational interview, either in person
or on the phone, to learn more about the
organization and the person's specific
role. Yee-Litzenberg advises you stay in

touch with these contacts, adding them to
your network to make sure they know
about your career interests and how to
get in touch with you should a job oppor
tunity become available.
Finally, you'll need to customize your
resume and cover letters for each position
you want to apply for, highlighting your
most relevant skills and experiences.

"It's very exciting to see the environ
mental field opening up so many possible
career choices," says Yee-Litzenberg.
"Today, we are seeing environmental
careers in many different disciplines includ
ing science, policy, law, business and more.
If you have a passion for the environment,
follow your heart and you can find a
rewarding career in this field."

sional tracks, according to ECO.
Doyle notes that a few leaders at the
master's level include Stanford, Notre
Dame, George Washington, Michigan,
North Carolina, Cornell, Wake Forest and
UC Berkeley. "But things are changing for
the better so quickly that it's really hard to
create a meaningful ranking," he adds. No
matter which B-school you choose, all seri
ous students who want to pursue environ
mental careers should get involved with the
campus chapter of Net Impact, a nonprofit
networking group aimed at helping business
students, professors and schools go green.
For those with a more focused interest in
fields like fisheries, wildlife management
and ecology, Doyle urges students to check
out the rapidly growing field of conserva
tion biology — either as a separate field or
as focus within a traditional disciplinary
degree program.
Undergrad Programs
If you're interested in undergraduate
environmental studies programs, the best
ones are all members of the Council of
Environmental Deans and Directors
(CEDD). The organization's Web site
offers a green careers brochure that con
tains a long list of green job titles and other
online resources.
Find Your Career Focus
What are you going to do with your
degree once you have it? How can you con
nect the dots between what you studied and
a paycheck?
Yee-Litzenberg recommends students
follow their passion and then narrow their
interest area based on their experience and
skills. For example, she likes to hear stu
dents be as specific as possible about their
career goals: "I would like to work for a
nonprofit organization in California doing
advocacy work to protect endangered
species" or "I would like to use my business
background to work for a global environ
mental consulting firm to create energy
efficiency solutions."
Yee-Litzenberg also suggests you iden
tify three or four organizations that fit
your search criteria, and then create the
means to get your foot in the door,
whether it be through an internship,
alumni contact, event, application for a
specific job, etc. It may be helpful to
identify a staff person within the organi
zation and then set up a 20- to 30-minute
informational interview, either in person
or on the phone, to learn more about the
organization and the person's specific
role. Yee-Litzenberg advises you stay in

touch with these contacts, adding them to
your network to make sure they know
about your career interests and how to
get in touch with you should a job oppor
tunity become available.
Finally, you'll need to customize your
resume and cover letters for each position
you want to apply for, highlighting your
most relevant skills and experiences.

"It's very exciting to see the environ
mental field opening up so many possible
career choices," says Yee-Litzenberg.
"Today, we are seeing environmental
careers in many different disciplines includ
ing science, policy, law, business and more.
If you have a passion for the environment,
follow your heart and you can find a
rewarding career in this field."
