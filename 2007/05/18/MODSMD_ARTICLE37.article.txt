# Green and growing: environmental jobs
## 
### CONNIE BLASZCZYK MONSTER STAFF WRITER 
What's the good news for green job seek
ers this Earth Day? Environmental career
opportunities are thriving in numerous sec
tors and around the globe. Why is the envi
ronment driving so many jobs? In a word:
Mainstreaming.
Once thought of as more "crunchy gra
nola" than "big business," green products
and services are becoming a significant part
of the mainstream economy in agriculture,
transportation, energy, consumer goods -
you name it. Even traditional business
careers like sales and marketing take on a
green hue when the product is wind energy
or organic food.
Are you looking to get in on some of the
environmental action? If so, you'll want to
check out the five growth areas below, as
recommended by Kevin Doyle, coauthor of
The ECO Guide to Careers that Make a
Difference and national director of program
development at the Environmental Careers
Organization, a nonprofit started in 1972
that features a wide variety of environmen
tal internships and fellowships. "These
opportunities are just the tip of a massive
iceberg of jobs," says Doyle. "And unlike
our real icebergs, this one isn't threatened
by global warming. It's fed by it."
Wind Power
This industry has been around since the
'70s, but it's just now hitting the market in a
bigger way, given the rise of energy costs. A
2007 report from Clean Edge finds wind
power revenues expected to rise from $17.9
billion in 2006 to $60.8 billion in 2016.
Wind power jobs are not your father's
environmental career. From wind resource
assessor (the person who finds windy loca
tions) to wind turbine installation and main

tenance personnel (those who keep the pro
pellers turning), these jobs were way under
the radar screen until recently.
And then there is the science behind the
technology, including atmospheric physics,
climatology and meteorology. A back
ground in these disciplines is useful, particu
larly if you have a master's degree in meteo
rology, because it could lead to jobs in wind
power meteorology (scientists who map out
atmospheric models) and wind power fore
casting (another term for wind resource
assessor).
If you have a degree in engineering, grid
integration positions (people who connect
wind energy to the overall energy grid) are
an option. Training in mechanical or electri
cal engineering will allow you to parlay your
skills into wind power with minimal addi
tional education or simply through on-the
job training. Or, you can find a certificate
program at a growing number of local col
leges.

opportunities, check out the American
Wind Energy Association.
Financing
Alternative Energy
Green energy isn't only blowing in the
wind, of course. Solar power, carbon man
agement, hydrogen, fuel cells, energy con
servation and biofuels are quickly becoming
household names, and money is flowing into
all of them. If you're fresh out of business
school and looking for opportunities that
are green in both the environmental and the
economic sense, there's no better place to
go than alternative energy.
Well-known investment houses like
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have
placed big green energy bets, and they are
joined by independent venture capitalists

and specialty hedge funds. These jobs
attract folks who are concerned about the
environment and have the analytical skills
and industry knowledge needed to put bil
lions of dollars on the line.
One good source for tracking these
investments is the Clean Tech Venture
Network.
Green Building
Green building practices are a global
phenomenon; Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) building
practices are now accepted worldwide.
According to the US Green Building
Council, the number of accredited profes
sionals in this country alone has grown from
527 in 2001 to more than 36,000 today. The
Council predicts that the 2007 green build
ing market will account for at least $12 bil
lion, and others feel this estimate may be
conservative.
Not surprisingly, the green building
industry is affecting the education of archi
tects. Most of the best architecture degree
programs offer a green focus. But the green
building industry has opened doors for
other professionals as well, including con
struction managers, landscape architects,
materials engineers and more.
Since buildings are an important contrib
utor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
the likely passage of federal GHG emission
reduction legislation will drive the already
rapid growth in green building into hyper
mode. Those with the right backgrounds
and certifications will be in serious demand.
Urban and Regional
Planning
Sustainability is at the center of the environ

mental movement, and urban planners are
smack in the middle of our global push for a
more sustainable society and economy.
Planners do it all -- they coordinate building
permits, ally key stakeholders, organize
resource analysis, etc. Although many plan
ners have technical specialties, the field ulti
mately requires a savvy understanding of
how economics, politics, science and design
must work together.
Environmental studies majors are often
planners at heart, and an interdisciplinary
undergraduate degree can certainly get you
started. However, if you're serious about rising
in the field, you'll probably want to get a mas
ter's degree in planning. For more informa
tion, visit the American Planning Association.
Land Trusts and
Brownfield
Redevelopment
Land trusts primarily seek to protect eco
logically sensitive places, like forests, beach
es, wildlife habitats, wetlands and open
spaces that continue to be lost at a rapid
pace. Brownfield redevelopment, mean
while, mainly looks to reclaim contaminated
and/or abandoned properties, such as old
industrial sites in cities and abandoned
mines in the countryside. Brownfield profes
sionals transform these liabilities into usable
community assets that can reinvigorate sag
ging neighborhood economies.
Job opportunities in both areas have
exploded over the past decade, and include
executive directors, preserve managers, real
estate and tax experts, education managers,
fundraisers, environmental clean-up special
ists and community coordinators.

Trust Alliance and the National Brownfield
Association.
