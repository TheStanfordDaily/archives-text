### Connie Blaszczyk MONSTER STAFF WRITER 
You know you want to do work that does good for the
environment. The good news is there are plenty of opportu
nities out there.
Monster Worldwide data shows a steady increase in the
number of environmental job postings since 2005, particular
ly for engineers, protection technicians and specialists.
This growth has been fueled by economic trends, with
many jobs offered in the public sector, including such bureaus
as the Environmental Protection Agency.
And you no longer need a background in science to join
the green job brigade, either. The next decade will see an
increase in green job opportunities in law, conservation and
urban planning, according to the Environmental Careers
Organization (ECO).
Feeling a little overwhelmed by the possibilities? Take a
closer look at the positions as described by ECO to determine
the path you might pursue.
Environmental Engineers
1 here's currently a huge demand for environmental engi
neers in both the public and private sectors. These jobs, usu
ally in water, waste-water or air-quality management, are
often listed with one of the 3,000-plus environmental engi
neering consulting firms that make up this thriving market.
Analysts attribute a number of factors to this growth: an
improved economy, particularly in the southern and western
United States, more infrastructure construction and the rise
in foreign markets (China and India for starters). Another

trend that will help keep up the pace for the next decade is
the retiring Baby Boomer demographic.
Median Salary: $71,800
Entry-Level Salary: $50,702
Environmental Scientists
These folks fulfill a very specific need that's primarily in
the public sector but shifting inexorably toward scientific con
sulting firms and technical contractors that work with govern
ment and industry.
Another reason for the growing demand is the decreasing
number of students who are choosing to major in this field.
And tighter immigration laws for foreign students looking to
study in the US add to the problem. The result is an overall
deficit of qualified and experienced scientists.
It's possible to enter the field of environmental engineer
ing or environmental science with a bachelor's degree.
However, if you want to advance significantly, you'll need to
go to grad school.
Median Salary: $55,000
Entry-Level Salary: $34,000
Urban and Regional Planners
The need for good urban planners is fueled by the growth
of large urban areas as well as a need for regional planning in
suburban and outlying areas. ECO finds that 70 percent of
urban and regional planners work in local government.

Median Salary: $57,560
Entry-Level Salary: $36,000
Conservation Scientists/Foresters
While the current job outlook shows slow growth for
these fields, they will likely pick up as Baby Boomers enter
retirement. Working from federal labor statistics, the ECO
finds that 33 percent of conservation scientists and
foresters work with the federal government â€” 21 perccnt at
a state level and 11 percent with local government. Thirty
five percent are employed by private industry and consult
ing firms.
Median Salary for Conservation Scientists: $56,515
Entry-Level Salary for Conservation Scientists: $33,000
Median Salary for Foresters: $51,938
Entry-Level Salary for Foresters: $32,000
Environmental Lawyers
The outlook forecasts steady growth for environmental
law opportunities, with 60 percent of the nearly 80,000 envi
ronmental lawyers currently in private practice.
Median Salary: $103,130
Entry-Level Salary in Public Interest: $40,000
Entry-Level Salary in Government: $46,000
Entry-Level Salary Business/Industry: $71,000
