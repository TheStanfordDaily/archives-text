# Stern lets game down

£ £ r | 1 he ball never lies."
It's one of the oldest sayings in
playground basketball.
Vou have a question about whose
ball it is? Shoot for it. The ball never
lies.
You're calling a foul on that last
play? We'll shoot, then. The ball
doesn't lie.
The karmic saying almost seems
to be a joke at times; we take it non
chalantly when we talk about it. but
deep down, maybe we really do be
lieve that the ball never lies. At least
I do. After all. it's really just a sports

guy's way of saying that the universe
will unfold as it should.
So when the Phoenix Suns took
the court during Wednesdays Game
5 against the Spurs, it was only natu
ral to think they would pull out the
victory. After the NBA and David
Stern made a horrible decision in
suspending Boris Diaw and Amare
Stoudemire for one game each, com
promising the integrity of not only
their league hut the game itself as
well, it was only natural to root for
the Suns.
I sat on my couch, watching the
game and repeating the mantra —
"The ball never lies." — to my

friends. I really did believe it at the
time.
And after Nash and his comrades
played inspired defense to take a
double-digit lead. I was sure that the
universe was acting out in the spirit
of justice. The Suns' fans, organiza
tion and players were not going to be
stopped by the ugly bureaucracy we
know as the NBA.
But Bruce Bowen came up big.
