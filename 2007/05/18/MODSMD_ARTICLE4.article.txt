# Stern lets game down

£ £ r | 1 he ball never lies."
It's one of the oldest sayings in
playground basketball.
Vou have a question about whose
ball it is? Shoot for it. The ball never
lies.
You're calling a foul on that last
play? We'll shoot, then. The ball
doesn't lie.
The karmic saying almost seems
to be a joke at times; we take it non
chalantly when we talk about it. but
deep down, maybe we really do be
lieve that the ball never lies. At least
I do. After all. it's really just a sports

guy's way of saying that the universe
will unfold as it should.
So when the Phoenix Suns took
the court during Wednesdays Game
5 against the Spurs, it was only natu
ral to think they would pull out the
victory. After the NBA and David
Stern made a horrible decision in
suspending Boris Diaw and Amare
Stoudemire for one game each, com
promising the integrity of not only
their league hut the game itself as
well, it was only natural to root for
the Suns.
I sat on my couch, watching the
game and repeating the mantra —
"The ball never lies." — to my

friends. I really did believe it at the
time.
And after Nash and his comrades
played inspired defense to take a
double-digit lead. I was sure that the
universe was acting out in the spirit
of justice. The Suns' fans, organiza
tion and players were not going to be
stopped by the ugly bureaucracy we
know as the NBA.
But Bruce Bowen came up big.

the Suns in a remarkable Spurs
comeback. The Phoenix crowd was
deflated and left with an empty, hol
low feeling, void of the justice we
had envisioned for Nash and com
pany.
And that's not to say that I think
the Spurs are to blame for this whole
mess. They're just playing their
game and working the system.
Bruce Bowen might be the dirti
est player in the game, jump-kicking
people in the throat and bloodying
opponents, but he understands how
the NBA works. You can't blame
Manu Ginobili for flopping across
the floor like a fish — it's his Argen
tinean soccer instincts creeping up
on him. And you surely can't blame
Tim Duncan for all of his lamenting,
face contortions and puppy-dog
faces throughout a single game. He
employs his funeral act to perfec
tion. knowing that he's going to get
the calls when he needs them.
And that's what's wrong with the
NBA today. Like a lot of other
sports institutions, the league has
degenerated into nothing more than
a bureaucratic system. What makes
the game great gets lost in all the
mess.
The Suns-Spurs series should
have been a classic. There are great
players on each team, a myriad of
storylines and ultimately, great bas
ketball to be played. Yet the NBA
had to screw that up by unfairly sus
pending Diaw and Stoudemire,
while handing the Spurs' Robert
I lorry a two-game suspension.
And you know what the worst
part is? The fans can't do anything
about it.
Sure, plenty of fans have made
vows to quit watching the NBA and
leave the league forever, but they'll
come back. ITiey always do.
Right now, though, we're stuck
with the product that the NBA exec
utives throw at us. Somehow, some
way. they do their best to try and
ruin some of the best athletes in the
world playing the best game in the
world (yeah, 1 said it). And Stern
and his cohorts are great at their
jobs.
As fans, I think we're all just tired
of the evil people in sports. The
George Steinbrenners, the David
Sterns and the higher-ups of the
world They compromise the integri
ty of the game, leaving us fans cring
ing and complaining at every junc
ture They do what they do because
they know they can.
"The ball never lies."
At least 1 can hope.
