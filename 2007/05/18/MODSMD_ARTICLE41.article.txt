### TAYLOR PHILLIPS INTERMISSION STREET SENSE 
Dear Stanford,
You all have been missing something. Something crazy.
Something to fill your Thursday nights. I mean. The Row is
obviously a great place to party, Uj always has something fun
going on, and Branner has gotta be the best frosh dorm for
random parties and general hanging out. But what about
those pesky Thursdays? No class on Friday; It would be com
pletely lame to go to bed before 1:00 in the morning, but
there's not a lot going on — no Exotic, no Erotic. What do
you do?
I've struggled with this dilemma all year, but I've finally
found the answer. Attention all! Need a Thursday night
hotspot? Visit The Stanford Daily. They fill your boring
classes with hilarious Op-Eds, make your sex life better with
advice from the Roxy Sass, but who knew they were hiding
still more entertainment from us non-Daily students? Thurs
day night is where it's at. The Daily staff pulls out all the
stops, and Mayhem becomes a much better descriptor of
Thursdays than Mondays.
Thursday night is the Intermission staffs night — they
rule the roost, spreading their Intermission excess, their fun.
their sass. Free food, free laughs, what could be better? Oh,
well perhaps the ridiculous quotes on the quote board (I am
NOT A HO!), maybe the making fun of the creepy surveys
from Boardman. the ones that look like kindergarten color
ing projects for depressed people. Rap music by some dude
named Jeezy that talks about mini vans? You're basically in
party heaven: people running around, yelling, laughing, and
then comes the piece de resistance: Beer Scream. Cold
Moose Tracks ice cream and cold beer, a better pair than PB

and J. The madness starts all over again, just a little tipsier,
and a little more fun.
So, liow'd I discover this diamond in the rough? Some
dumb IHUM project (but really, are there any good IHUM
projects?) made me spend my past week watching people on
campus, studying them, basically acting like a complete nerd
just to find out "the identity politics of Stanford groups."
Identity my butt — we're in college, aren't we supposed to be
figuring that out still? So there 1 was, trying to find my IHUM
"subjects" one bored Thursday night, when my RA Betsy
(Intermission Extraordinaire) led me to The Daily. And
thank God for that.
Okay, okay, so yes they work really hard and have a great
paper and all that jazz. But it's kinda like mom's cookies —
isn't it the love that makes them so great? Or better yet, it's
like dad's Vesper nightcaps. There's gotta be a kick to make
things fun — a kick that Thursday nights on campus has been
desperately needing. The Daily and Intermission are ready
to give us that kick. It's the fun, the camaraderie, the all-out
craze these Daily people have that makes their paper great.
(As for Intermission in particular, maybe we should add "in
sanity" to that list of special ingredients.) And I, for one, am
glad. I'm glad The Daily can let loose and not take itself so se
riously. We do that all week in class — shouldn't Thursday
nights be our time to enjoy?
So thanks. The Daily and Intermission — thanks for giv
ing us that extra kick in the morning before class, that extra
Intermission punch to send us off into our weekend. And
thanks especially for kicking my Thursday nights. Now, I've
just gotta get an IHUM paper out of this somehow...
With Love,
Your Frosh Ethnographer
