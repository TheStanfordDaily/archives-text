## Trailer Park: So you won't waste your money on bad movies 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION TRAILER PARKER 
Movie trailers are a tricky business. They
have about 2.5 minutes to convince us that the
featured movie is the funniest, scariest, gritti
est, generally most awesome film of the mo
ment that deserves our immediate time and
money. This means that they are not above
picking the only two funny scenes in an other
wise awful movie in an attempt to convince us
that it is in fact a good movie. They'll also be
completely misleading about the plot if advan
tageous (best recent example: "In the Land of
Women" was advertised as a romantic drame
dy for teenyboppers that like Adam Brody,
but it was more about his relationships with his
dying grandmother and a woman with cancer
than young love). Lucky for you, I've taken
the time to critique the trailers of a few up
coming films and attempt to identify both the
winners and the stinkers:
1. "Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix," Trailer 2: You might be thinking to
yourself that you've already seen the trailer
for the next Harry Potter film some time ago.
I've seen that trailer too. As a matter of fact,
it's on my iPod, and I watch it every so often
for inspiration. However, this new trailer
(which was available on Apple.com, the best
source of trailers, as of May 9 and which 1 first
saw before "Spiderman 3") puts the first one
to shame. It was also the best part of seeing
"Spiderman 3." This trailer takes the first trail
er and expands upon it. Instead of only seeing
Cho Chang lay a kiss on Harry, we first see her
telling him seductively, "You're a really great
teacher, Harry!" Explains everything! The
trailer also gives more footage of Harry train
ing Dumbledore's Army — including Harry
convincingly reminding everyone that,
"Every great wizard in history starts off as
nothing more than we are now." I love how
Harry is slowly becoming an inspiring leader.

1 hope 1 can contain myself until July 13!
2. "Ratatouille": This appears to be the next
brilliant movie from Pixar. The trailer clever
ly begins with a rat stealing a piece of cheese
off of a plate from a Parisian restaurant only to
be pursued and chased by a number of restau
rant employees before freeze framing him in
the air (where knives and broken dishes are

flying at him) where he declares.

"This is me. I think

it's apparent

that 1 need to

rethink
my life
a little."
You see,

the basic
premise of

" R a t a -

touille" is that

a rat named Remy
a) is a food snob

and b) desires to
be a chef. "I like |
good food. 1 don't

want to eat
garbage," he
tells his fa-

ther. Who thinks of these things?! It seems too
cute to be bad.
3. "License to Wed": "Jim Halpert is in a
movie!" That's what I said to myself when I
first saw this trailer and I was excited. Briefly.
Unfortunately, it seems that Jim Halpert, or

more accurately John Krasinski, the actor who
plays Jim Halpert on the TV show "The Of
fice," has chosen a dud of a movie to star in.
Based on this trailer (and I hope I'm wrong,
because I like Jim), this movie seems plain
dumb. The basic premise is that before Ben
(Krasinski) and Sadie (Mandy Moore) can get
married, they need to get permission from

Sadie's longtime and
somewhat uncon

ventional minis
ter, Reverend

Frank
(Robin
Williams).
Williams
thus sub
jects them
to endless

tasks to test
their com
mitment to

one anoth
er that are
supposed
to seem
funny. Un
fortunate-
ly, if the

funniest
scene
that
they
could

drum up

to end the

trailer was having

one of those dolls they give you in Home Eco
nomics (you know, to teach you that parenting
is difficult) squirt water-pee in Ben's face, 1 am
left deeply concerned for the quality of the en
tire film...
4. "The Bourne Ultimatum": I have to tell
you, I did not love the second film in the

Bourne series, "The Bourne Supremacy." Ac
tually, 1 didn't even love the first one — I
thought it was slightly better than your aver
age action flick. Both movies were pretty
much elaborate two hour chases with a whole
lot of fighting and a little bit of romance
thrown in (and every so often a little backsto
ry). Thus, the trailer for "The Bourne Ultima
tum" begins by easily summing up the first two
movies in these three fragments: his identity
erased, his loved one murdered, his past
stolen. Then, it proceeds to promise us more
of what we have already seen: a buff (or more
so than average) Matt Damon punching peo
ple, shooting guns and running... a lot. Finally,
at the end of the trailer Bourne declares. "1 re
member everything"! I'm optimistic that this
line is implying that this movie will attempt to
fill the many gaping plotholes remaining from
the first two films. If not, at least the trailer
promises that true to Bourne form, Matt
Damon will do some serious ass kicking.
5. "Evan Almighty": In this follow-up to
2003's Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey,
weatherman Evan Baxter (played by yet an
other "The Office" cast member, Steve
Carell) has inexplicably become a congress
man. You've just got to accept that fact, as it's
the most plausible event that occurs in the
trailer. Next, God (Morgan Freeman) appears
to instruct him to build an ark because a flood
is coming. While Evan tries to reject this, he
slowly begins morphing into Noah (who looks
a lot like Moses — I guess all biblical figures
look the same) and becomes unable to reject
his calling. Animals in the obligatory biblical
two-pairing also begin following him around.
"It might be something fun for the family", he
tells his wife, as he recruits his children to help
him build the ark. Part "The Santa Clause",
part "Dr. Dolittle", this movie looks slightly
silly, but I still have high hopes. I believe Steve
Carell can do no wrong!

ment that deserves our immediate time and
money. This means that they are not above
picking the only two funny scenes in an other
wise awful movie in an attempt to convince us
that it is in fact a good movie. They'll also be
completely misleading about the plot if advan
tageous (best recent example: "In the Land of
Women" was advertised as a romantic drame
dy for teenyboppers that like Adam Brody,
but it was more about his relationships with his
dying grandmother and a woman with cancer
than young love). Lucky for you, I've taken
the time to critique the trailers of a few up
coming films and attempt to identify both the
winners and the stinkers:
1. "Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix," Trailer 2: You might be thinking to
yourself that you've already seen the trailer
for the next Harry Potter film some time ago.
I've seen that trailer too. As a matter of fact,
it's on my iPod, and I watch it every so often
for inspiration. However, this new trailer
(which was available on Apple.com, the best
source of trailers, as of May 9 and which 1 first
saw before "Spiderman 3") puts the first one
to shame. It was also the best part of seeing
"Spiderman 3." This trailer takes the first trail
er and expands upon it. Instead of only seeing
Cho Chang lay a kiss on Harry, we first see her
telling him seductively, "You're a really great
teacher, Harry!" Explains everything! The
trailer also gives more footage of Harry train
ing Dumbledore's Army — including Harry
convincingly reminding everyone that,
"Every great wizard in history starts off as
nothing more than we are now." I love how
Harry is slowly becoming an inspiring leader.

1 hope 1 can contain myself until July 13!
2. "Ratatouille": This appears to be the next
brilliant movie from Pixar. The trailer clever
ly begins with a rat stealing a piece of cheese
off of a plate from a Parisian restaurant only to
be pursued and chased by a number of restau
rant employees before freeze framing him in
the air (where knives and broken dishes are

flying at him) where he declares.

"This is me. I think

it's apparent

that 1 need to

rethink
my life
a little."
You see,

the basic
premise of

" R a t a -

touille" is that

a rat named Remy
a) is a food snob

and b) desires to
be a chef. "I like |
good food. 1 don't

want to eat
garbage," he
tells his fa-

ther. Who thinks of these things?! It seems too
cute to be bad.
3. "License to Wed": "Jim Halpert is in a
movie!" That's what I said to myself when I
first saw this trailer and I was excited. Briefly.
Unfortunately, it seems that Jim Halpert, or

more accurately John Krasinski, the actor who
plays Jim Halpert on the TV show "The Of
fice," has chosen a dud of a movie to star in.
Based on this trailer (and I hope I'm wrong,
because I like Jim), this movie seems plain
dumb. The basic premise is that before Ben
(Krasinski) and Sadie (Mandy Moore) can get
married, they need to get permission from

Sadie's longtime and
somewhat uncon

ventional minis
ter, Reverend

Frank
(Robin
Williams).
Williams
thus sub
jects them
to endless

tasks to test
their com
mitment to

one anoth
er that are
supposed
to seem
funny. Un
fortunate-
ly, if the

funniest
scene
that
they
could

drum up

to end the

trailer was having

one of those dolls they give you in Home Eco
nomics (you know, to teach you that parenting
is difficult) squirt water-pee in Ben's face, 1 am
left deeply concerned for the quality of the en
tire film...
4. "The Bourne Ultimatum": I have to tell
you, I did not love the second film in the

Bourne series, "The Bourne Supremacy." Ac
tually, 1 didn't even love the first one — I
thought it was slightly better than your aver
age action flick. Both movies were pretty
much elaborate two hour chases with a whole
lot of fighting and a little bit of romance
thrown in (and every so often a little backsto
ry). Thus, the trailer for "The Bourne Ultima
tum" begins by easily summing up the first two
movies in these three fragments: his identity
erased, his loved one murdered, his past
stolen. Then, it proceeds to promise us more
of what we have already seen: a buff (or more
so than average) Matt Damon punching peo
ple, shooting guns and running... a lot. Finally,
at the end of the trailer Bourne declares. "1 re
member everything"! I'm optimistic that this
line is implying that this movie will attempt to
fill the many gaping plotholes remaining from
the first two films. If not, at least the trailer
promises that true to Bourne form, Matt
Damon will do some serious ass kicking.
5. "Evan Almighty": In this follow-up to
2003's Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey,
weatherman Evan Baxter (played by yet an
other "The Office" cast member, Steve
Carell) has inexplicably become a congress
man. You've just got to accept that fact, as it's
the most plausible event that occurs in the
trailer. Next, God (Morgan Freeman) appears
to instruct him to build an ark because a flood
is coming. While Evan tries to reject this, he
slowly begins morphing into Noah (who looks
a lot like Moses — I guess all biblical figures
look the same) and becomes unable to reject
his calling. Animals in the obligatory biblical
two-pairing also begin following him around.
"It might be something fun for the family", he
tells his wife, as he recruits his children to help
him build the ark. Part "The Santa Clause",
part "Dr. Dolittle", this movie looks slightly
silly, but I still have high hopes. I believe Steve
Carell can do no wrong!
