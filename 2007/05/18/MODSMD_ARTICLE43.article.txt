# Flicks shows 'Pan's Labyrinth': Delivers eye candy and gore
## 
### MARCO HERNANDEZ INTERMISSION THESEUS 
Guillermo del Toro, producer of such cinematic gems as
"The Hulk" and "Hellboy" (who doesn't remember those fine
movies?), finally redeems himself with the fairy tale "Pan's
Labyrinth." This movie takes place in 1944 Spain, years after
the Spanish Civil War of the 19305. The plot cleverly inter
weaves a fairy tale with gruesome depictions of military abuse
and warring factions.
But don't be fooled by the "fairy tale" moniker, because
this is no Disney fantasy, by far. The story's main character, an
11 year-old girl named Ofelia, the woods to find
dilapidated remains that later turn out to be a labyrinth. There
she meets the first of several magical characters. Pan the faun.

Pan sets up a series of challenges for Ofelia. none exactly fit for
a pre-teen. Ofelia's tasks would make plenty an adult wet their
pants.
The movie relies on special effects to depict mythical creatures
and fantasy terrains. Although some of the effects seem more suit
able for a television movie than for the big screen — read: not amaz
ing — most of the effects are decent enough to pass as convincing.
Shoddy special effects aside, del Toro pens a screenplay that more
than makes up for any shortcomings. The fairy tale that Ofelia lives
serves as a metaphor for the struggle that took place after the Span
ish Civil War, where the military set up a fascist government. Life
isn't sweet, even in an alternate reality where Ofelia thinks herself
to be a long-lost princess.
One of the movie's many fortes is the cast. Although most
American audiences more than likely will not recognize the

actors — I didn't — they all deliver amazing performances.
From the heroine Ofelia, to the subversive maid, to the ruth
less military commander/Ofelia's new stepfather, you never
have to stop to complain about corny performances or
whether the star of the movie was doing coke at Coachella and
feuding with Paris Hilton.
"Pan's Labyrinth" is closer to another one of del Toro's
Spanish-language "The Devil's Backbone" in their levels of
gruesomencss and takes on the supernatural. Unlike his stabs
at commercial American cinema, "Pan's Labyrinth" delivers
story that is aided by visual adornment but is not dependent
on it. With this new movie, del Toro shows the world stage that
he can produce a pretty awesome movie, something he didn't
pull off with his English-language flicks. This movie is definite
ly a must-see.
