# The 						Lost Episodes of Mystery Science Theater
## 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION CROW 
The show had a good ten-year
run and managed to catch some ol'his
tory's lost atrocities set to film. Among their
many episodes, they cover a short about the bene
fit of springs and a movie about Raul Julia's experience
as a baboon. But 1 wish they were still around to butcher some
contemporary film and TV blunders.

5) Sfeamboy
An anime by
the same director
as Akira, this one is my
token anime entry. Really,
Dragon Ball Z or any popular se
rialized show could make this list, but
for a feature length, "Steamboy" demon
strates the many things that don't translate well
to American audiences — like a ludicrous plot and
poor sense of character development. When a building
turns into a flying castle and Robert Louis Stevenson (yes. the
author) leaps to the rescue, you can't help but wonder if it was steam
the writers were breathing.

6) Jurassic Park 3
An all
star cast of B
list celebrities
tried to save a kid from
dinosaurs or something on
an island. If you thought the sec
ond one was lacking in plot, they didn't
even bother with a script with this dud.
Thankfully, the movie is only an hour long, which
begs the question: someone actually edited this crap?

1) Sahara
Ar
guably
the biggest dud
in movie history, it's
now the center of an ongo
ing legal mess. Too many
screenwriters, an overblown budget
and Clive Cussler all add up to create a sit
ting duck for satire. For incurring too many pro
duction costs, wardrobe must have been cheap be
cause the protagonist almost never wears a shirt.

7) Hulk
It's no
Puma Man,
but it'll do. I'd also
consider putting Bat
man and Robin or Spider
man 3 here, but those are too
campy and lighthearted to generate
more than obvious laughs. The villains in
this film include mutant puppies and a really evil
lake. But worse, Ang Lee's pitiable and laboriously
paced film is hilarious because it takes itself seriously.

2) Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon
I
love this
movie. But the
plot makes no sense
and there are some dramatic
turns — like when after stabbing a
man, Zhang Ziyi starts making love to him,
that you just kind of scratch your head. 1 think
Tom Servo would be able to fill in where the dubbing
leaves things ambiguous — like all of it.

I've
been forced
to watch this
show by people who
believe WASP angst is
great television. Now, to get my
revenge. 1 want to see Crow com
pare Lorelai's love interests to the
Brawny Man or Scott Wolf. Also, maybe
Mike can explain why the grandparents look like
those creepy robots from old Duracell commercials.

8) Gilmore Girls

3) Unbreakable
Ah hell, 1
think any film by
M. Night Shyamalan
could make this list. The
plot of this one fits perfectly
with a much beloved MST3K. film:
an everyday Joe becomes a superhero.
Sounds a lot Mitchell to me.

9) Donnie Dcirko
if
you re
leased this
movie in the
'80s. it would be a
sitting duck. Now, it's
become an underground
hit, but that doesn't mean it's
not full of ludicrous moments and
awkward cinematic decisions. The
premise itself is amazing: it's about time,
space, reality, and a giant... bunny rabbit?

4) The matrix
(Reloaded and
Revolutions)
Perhaps
this is too easy.
Perhaps it would too
easy for Crow to compare the
Architect to Colonel Sanders. Perhaps
Mike would insert Keanu Reeves dialogue
with surfer lingo. Yet, perhaps they'll make the third
installment viewable.

10)3osie and
fhe Pussycats
Intend
ed to capture
that crowd of young
teenagers who liked
"She's All That" and that jaded
group who hated popular culture like
"She's All That," this film is intended to be
both satirical and a 90 minute commercial. It's
hard to mock satires, but Josie is so devoid of inten
tionally funny moments that it is begging to be MSTK3Ked.
Watch Rachel Leigh Cook lip-sync.
