## BE ROYALTY AT SIAM ROYAL 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION ROYALITY 
After being closed for renovation
for the past three months, Siani
Royal, an authentic Thai restaurant
on University Drive, has recently re
opened and definitely looks better
than ever. Moving the kitchen to the
back, the restaurant is about double
the size it used to be. with the same
high ceilings it used to have, but also
now a very roomy seating area. With
so much space, the restaurant was re
freshing to be in, and even on a Tues
day night, it was busy enough that the
restaurant did not look too empty
with the great amount of tables there
are now for service.
When you approach the restaurant
from University Drive, all you see is a
clear window and a run-down blue
sign that says "Siam Royal." Howev
er. don't let this plain, stark exterior of
the restaurant fool you. When you
walk into Siam Royal, you can tell by
the walls, floors, and other decora
tions that this restaurant has under
gone serious renovation. The differ
ent artwork and paintings on the wall,
although not matching very well, ac
tually seemes to flow together very

nicely. My favonte decorations added
to the restaurant are the three

huge, brightly colored hand
fans hanging on the

D""D
walls. In addition,
the contempo

rary and

makes the din-
ing experience an

aesthetically pleas- i
ing one. One of the

best parts of the restau
rant was that upon enter

ing it smelled delicious in a
fresh way, not in the fried way

that characterizes some Thai
and Chinese restaurants. The skylight
in the center of the room was also a
very nice feature of the restaurant.

ing up the room with the appropriate
amount of sunlight.

In regards to the
food, which is what
we ultimately

came for,
Siam

oval

Y provided
us with the

r great Thai
food they are

known for. and in

a much nicer setting.
In addition, the prices

were amazing for Palo
Alto, ranging from around $7 to $8
for your average entree; the prices
are very reasonable for the quality of

the food. I would suggest the curry
dishes, as these are the restaurant's
specialties, or, if you are new in the
Thai food world, the Pad Thai with
chicken is an excellent dish to try.
Very mild, the Pad Thai had a deli
cious peanut sauce to it, and the
chicken mixed in was of great quali
ty. The Tom Kah Gai (chicken co
conut ) soup was also pretty good, al
though you definitely do not neeff
more than a cup (the bowls are
huge)! We also tried the noodle dish.
Pad See Ew Chicken, which al
though a little bland, was healthy
tasting and perfectly pan fried (in
fact, the noodles that were a little
burnt were the most delicious). The
service was also very quick and
friendly. We were in and out of there
in less than an hour, and our water
glasses were always full!
If you want to save some cash and hit
up a great tasting and now great look
ing restaurant, 1 would suggest Siam
Royal to you. It is for sure the cheap
est of the Thai restaurants I have been
to in Palo Alto, and the food is up to
par with the rest. The only bad thing
used to be the dingy atmosphere, but
with that changed. Siam Royal is a
good catch!
