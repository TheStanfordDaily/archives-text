An FAQ for the MST3K
newbie

0: So what's this MST3K thing?
A: Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Q: Mystery Science...
A:... Theater 3000.
0: That's a weird name. Why is it called Mystery Science Theater
3000? Are there 2999 other Mystery Science Theaters?
A: The answers were, unfortunately, lost when the stone tablet
that would have provided the key to deciphering the language of
the founders of the cult was broken. Just kidding. It doesn't real
ly have any significance, besides sounding vaguely like the title of
one of the crappy movies it would make fun of.

Q: I've heard that it has a "cult-like" following. Does this mean
"cult-like" in the Kool-Aid sense, or in "The Skulls" sense? Be
cause "The Skulls" was pretty cool.
A: "The Skulls," while a fine film, was actually about a secret so
ciety, and MST3K fans (called MiSTies by the supremely nerdy,
including myself) have no particular attachment to powdered
children's beverages. Its quirkincss appeals to a specific demo
graphic of people — the kind who hate staying quiet during
movies — that's pretty self-selecting. After the show was can
celled by the Sci-Fi channel, this haggard band of survivors, like
so many orphaned by the arbitrary cancellations of their shows,
banded together over the Internet.
Q: So what's this thing about?
A: Essentially, this guy Joel (who was later replaced by Mike) is
trapped on a satellite (known as the Satellite of Love or SoL) by
an evil scientist and forced to watch terrible movies. The only way
for him to keep his sanity is to mock the movies mercilessly with
the robots he built. Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo.

Q: Robots?
A: Just go with it. The background of the show isn't really that im
portant to its enjoyment, and while a recurring story will occasion
ally pop up in the short segments they show before the actual
movies (at one point, the new evil scientist — Dr. Forrester —
ends up in ancient Rome with the telepathic "Brain Guy" and
Bobo the monkey, and it takes a while to sort it all out), it's just as
easy to skip over them.
Q: "Brain Guy"? Bobo?
A: The evil scientist 's henchmen. Bobo is based on one of the
characters from Planet of the Apes — a talking, "intelli
gent ape, and "Brain Guy" is your standard horror movie
fare — an evil, telepathic alien who carries his brain around
in a pan.
Q: I'm confused.
A: Don't worry about it. Just pop in "Delta Knights" and enjoy.
You'll figure it out pretty quickly.
