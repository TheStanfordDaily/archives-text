## An eye experience: 'Cassadaga' by Bright Eyes 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION CASSANDRA 
Conor Oberst, front-man of the indie
band Bright Eyes has the emo look down: he
wears plaid, is poetic and soft-spoken and has
long, generally greasy hair that falls into his
eyes when he sings.
Oberst started recording music at age 14
as the singer/guitarist of Commander
Venus. When the band disbanded in 1998,
the then-18 year-old Oberst focused com
pletely on Bright Eyes, a side acoustic guitar
project he had been working on for three
years. That year, Oberst released A Collec
tion of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-
1997, and with members from Neutral Milk
Hotel and Of Montreal, released Letting of
Happiness. Fevers and Mirrors was re
leased in 2000, followed by Oh Holy Fools
in 2004 and the simultaneous dual release of
I'm Wide Awake It's Morning and the elec
tronica-slanted Digital Ash in a Digital Urn
in 2005. Cassadaga, released April 11,2007,
has been touted as the band's most mature
alhum yet.
Bright Eyes began as Oberst and his gui
tar. and in fact Oberst sometimes, rather con
fusingly. plays solo shows under his band's

name. Bright Eyes consists, however, of re
cent permanent band member,
trumpeter/piano player/organist Nate Wal
cott, and producer/one-man band Mike
Mogis who sings back-up vocals as well as
plays the mandolin, dobro, guitar, pedal steel,
vibraphone, bass, ukulele, lap steel, baritone
and glockenspiel. (Mogis has also produced
and played with The Faint. Rilo Kiley, Cur
sive, The Good Life, Lullaby for the Working
Class and Jenny Lewis). A rotating melange
of back-up band members (including, coolly,
a female drummer) play everything else, in
cluding the violin, clarinet, flute, oboe, and
percussion.
This incredible array of instruments used
on "Cassadaga" allows the album to jump
from upbeat bluegrass, to orchestral love
song to melancholy Dylan-esque ballads.
Tying these diverging elements together is
Oberst's famously splintered and aching
voice and his cerebral, often witty, sometimes
meandering lyrics. On "Four Winds," the first
single of Bright Eyes' latest album, the song
opens with a full minute of a melodic, foot
tapping, violin-heavy bluegrass instrumental
until Oberst begins with some of the most
controversial lyrics on the album, including
"The Bible is blind. The Torah is deaf. The

Qur'an is mute/ If you burned them all to
gether you'd get close to the truth." As an ac
knowledgement towards the lyrics' inflam
matory nature, the meta music video accom
panying "Four Winds" shows the band per
forming the song as a mullet-sporting, conser
vative-looking audience boos, throws trash at
the band members and grows increasingly
upset until the song ends and the band rushes
off-stage.
Not all of Oberst's songs are as political,
however. The orchestral "Make A Plan to
Love Me" features a dreamy and yearning fe
male chorus and is about longing to be loved,
while the piano-heavy ballad "Classic Cars"
laments life regrets. "Middleman." as song
about compromising, opens with the smooth
moaning of a lap steel and raining layers of
percussive bells and tambourines as the hon
est-meets-cynical Oberst sings, "Now every
dream gets whittled down, just like every fool
gets wise." The quiet, moving, "No One
Would Riot For Less" is an about a soldier
leaving his lover to fight â€” angelic female vo
cals glide over a building orchestral back
ground as Oberst reaches the chorus, "So
love me now/ Hell is coming,' Kiss my mouth/
Hell is here." In my favorite song on the
album, the very country, dobro-filied "I Must

Belong Somewhere," Oberst offers a catalog
of things that should be left as they are. In
perfect Oberst style, he lists both good and
bad, creating simultaneously an idyllic pic
ture of urban life and a heavily ironic social
commentary. He sings, "Leave the bright
blue door on the whitewashed wa11... Leave
the joyful air in that rubber ball, today-
Leave the restless ghosts in his old hotel/
Leave the homeless man out in that card
board cell," ultimately raising his voice to de
clare, "Everything it must belong some
where/ 1 know that now. that's why I'm stay
ing here."
Despite Oberst's thought-provoking
lyrics and Bright Eyes' unique blend of folk,
rock and indie-pop. many of the songs on
"Cassadaga" never spread their wings into
full-fledged songs. Near a capella tracks, too
similar-sounding songs, and a cacophonous
overly long introduction track are peppered
in between the thoughtful, melodic, affecting
songs that made Bright Eyes famous. "Cas
sadaga" has a lot to offer, you will just have to
skip over a bunch of tracks to get there.

Somewhere," "Middleman," and "Make a
