# New Moon is a light touch and a good sound

### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION SENIOR CITIZEN 
Pick an Elliott Smith song at random and
you'll have no problem teasing out hints of ad
diction. confession, depression or suicide. But if
Smith's themes are typical, his songs are any
thing but. Unlike the vast herd of self-styled
singer-songwriters. Smith never failed to imbue
depression with lyricism; anger with self-reflec
tion — his songs arc powerful, intimate intelli
gent, and complex. Three and a half years after
a headline-grabbing suicide, Smith's New Moon
reminds us that his legacy is in his songwriting.
not his sadness.
Throughout his career. Smith obeyed an un
written set of musical rules and tendencies —
this is part of why he has such a characteristic
sound. From the hushed acoustics of Roman
Candle and the self-titled Elliott Smith to the
massive pop-orchestras of Figure 8 and the frac
tured distortion of From a Basement on the Hill,
the songwriting never changed much. On New
Moon, we instantly recognize Smith's unexpect
ed chord progressions, his playful harmonies
and melodic turns.
Emotionally, we feel just as much at home in
this new release. Here again is the old familiar
tension between what Smith says and the way he
says it, the characteristic complexity of alien

ation made warm in the multi-tracked intimacy
of repetition, the way Smith can couch substance
abuse in a folksy lullaby that draws you irre
sistibly in.
Culled from recording sessions in the mid
19905, the songs on New Moon didn't make it
onto 1995's Elliott Smith or the 1997 Either/Or.
But you wouldn't know it from the sound of
them. For a collection recorded in the heart of
Smith's career, these songs are merely very
good. For a two-disc B-side compilation and an
artist's second posthumous release, they are un
believable.
Like the self-titled album and Either/Or.
New Moon is largely acoustic and quiet, but it
still covers a lot of ground stylistically. The hard
driving "Big Decision" and "Almost Over"
evoke Smith's Heatmiser days, "Pretty Mary k"
and "Going Nowhere" are almost painfully
hushed and melancholy, "New Monkey" is play
fully upbeat, and "All Cleaned Out hints at the
grand orchestral ambitions of XO and Figure 8.
New Moon isn't quite a coherent album, but
even these diverse songs are bound together by
Smith's characteristic sound.
For Smith devotees and new listeners alike.
New Moon is full of songs worth your time.
"All Cleaned Out" will leave you wondering
why Smith never took that tiny extra step and
cut a song that could be called radio-friendly.

and an early version of
"Miss Misery" lets you
inside a creative process
that consistently yielded
self-contained and emo
tionally resonant three
minute compositions.
The organ-drenched Ei
ther/Or by all rights
should have been the
title track on its name
sake album, and a beau
tifully stripped down
"See You Later" is as
melodic as anything by
Lennon or McCartney.
And for anyone who
ever wanted to hear El-

liott Smith play "Mad World," his cover of Big
Star's middle-school-innocence "Thirteen" is
one better.
In "Whatever (Some Folk Song in C)". Smith
asks, "If you're all done like you said you'd be /
What are you doing hanging out with me?" He's
probably singing about heroin, but he might as
well be singing about his music. It's a legitimate
question: why listen to something that's so con
sistently and overwhelmingly melancholy? It's
complicated, and it's simple.
Smith is in many ways a bridge between pop

ular music and the underground, and his music is
not quite like any other. He was always been
willing to use the tropes of popular music to ex
plore thematic material that will never make it
to the mainstream. While the lyrics push you
away, the intimacy of his voice and guitar pull
you closer to those lyrics, maybe uncomfortably
close. There's a tension here you don't get in
other music, and it's deceptively seductive —
that's the complicated part.
The simple part is that New Moon is very,
very pretty.
