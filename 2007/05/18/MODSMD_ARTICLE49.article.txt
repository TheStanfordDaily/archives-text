## Roxy feefs you up...in bed 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Ladies, you all know the drill. Especially if
there's alcohol in his system, he's going to fall
asleep after you do the deed. It could be the
most mind — (and everything else) blowing
sex of your life, but odds are he'll be out like
a light within sixty seconds. He might not
even pull out first, which probably leaves you
crushed under a sweaty dead weight reeking
of beer.
Roxy doesn't know whether or not this is a
problem for you. Personally, she makes it her
business to leave as soon as she gets what she
wants from the evening. Who needs all this
cuddling and spending the night in each
other's arms crap? It's going to be way awk
ward to sneak out the next morning. Why not
simply cut and alter
counter?
Oh yeah. Some people (um, girls) actual
ly en joy the warm fuzzy after party of the ban
gin' bask Roxy just doesfPt understand it.
She Can never sleep well out of her own bed.
Toss iu*t?lmher sticky body to pull away her
covers in the middle of the night? Count
Roxy out.
She recognizes, however, that it's impor
tant for evervone to figure out what thev

want, not only before and during, but after
sex as well. How often do Stanford students
sit down to ponder this, let alone discuss it
with their partners? Roxy is guessing not
much, and she thinks that should change. For

C7
now, let's focus on fulfilling your needs

after sex.
Ask yourself a couple of ques

tions, such as "What do I need
physically after I have sex?

What about emotionally? What

do 1 do if those two interests con
flict?"

For example, Roxy is pretty sure it's bi

ologically encoded in humans to fall asleep
after sex. There's just something relaxing
about pleasurable exercise, and hell, you're
already in bed. She knows what they say:
guys want to sleep, girls want to cuddle. But
at one point in his
lorymen and wotnerTfmt went to sleep after
getting down to business.
Nowadays, it's more complicate
expected of us after sexual encounters? If it's
a one-night stand, it's pretty likely that you
two haven't discussed what's going to happen
and after. And even if you're in a committed
relationship, sometimes it can seem too un
comfortable to discuss the subject with your
partner. However, once you've figured out

which
of

your
needs*

post-sack
session are

most important. Roxy en
courages you to do just that.

Roxy's a big fan of getting what she wants.
Trust her, life is easier that way. Just ask for
what you desire, and odds arc pretty high that
if you are nice and polite enough, you'll get it.
Ah, she knows what you're thinking. Guys,
you don't want to sound callous and unfeeling

when
you tell

her you just
want to go to

sleep. Girls, you

don't want to sound

needy when you suggest

cuddling and talking about the
I

wonderful experience for half an

hour or so. Then, you might kinda gross

him out by saying you have to go pee so

you won't get one of those pesky urinary tract
infections.
What to do, Roxy wonders. Work it out, of
course! We got into Stanford because people
expect us to solve the problems of the modern
world. As usual, Roxy thinks that sex is a
great place to start. Reach some sort of com
promise. It's a skill you learned in kinder
garten and you'll need for the rest of your life.
May Roxy suggest watching MST3K togeth
er?
