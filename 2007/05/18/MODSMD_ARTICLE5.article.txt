# Baseball looking for the ever-elusive W
## Card looks to rebound in series with Pacific 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Players often only pay lip service
to the idea of playing hard through
the end of a frustrating season. But
fresh off a three-game win streak.
Stanford baseball has shown that it's
not packing up for the summer just
yet.
This weekend, the Cardinal (22-
27. 6-15 Pacific-10 Conference) has

a chance to get three games closer to
.500 against a Pacific team that it has
historically dominated. Stanford
holds a 46-f»-l all-time record
against the Tigers and won both
games last year. 2-1 and 14-8.
"We've always tried to win. but
there's a tendency to get snowballed
by bad circumstances," junior out
fielder Michael Taylor said. "There's
been an appreciable change in the
mood of the team over the last little
streak because you're a little more
upbeat when you're winning ball
games and coaeh Marquess is a little
happier, so it makes practices and
everything else in vour life and the

game easier."
Over the last five games, the
biggest difference has been Stan
ford's arms going longer more con
sistently. In Tuesday's game against
Santa Clara, junior David Stringer
stabilized the team with seven in-

nings of relief without an earned run. Since a loss at
Washington State on May 7, Stanford's ERA is 4.20
— almost two full runs below its 6.14 season mark.
"It always comes down to pitching," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "Normally, when you feel
good after a game, it means you pitched well. If you
won 13-12. you don't feel as good as if you won 2-1
because you know you didn't pitch effectively."
Those playing behind the mound credit a more
aggressive approach.
"As a defense, you can live with a guy getting hit
— that's just part of the game — but sometimes
you can be lulled to sleep when guys walk a lot of
people or get in running counts,"Taylor said. "It's
that much easier to play behind a pitching staff
that's coming in and throwing strikes and [junior]
Erik Davis. Stringer, and [sophomore] Jeremy Ble
ich have been throwing strikes early."
Offensively. Stanford continues to produce. The
Cardinal has scored double-digit runs in its last two
games and matched its season-high of 14 on lues
day. Taylor has led the way with four homers and a
.421 average in the last dozen games.
Stanford's best contact hitter, junior Adam
Sorgi.is hitting .391 on the season, and if he plays in
all of the remaining games, will be eligible for Pac
-10 and NCAA leaderboards.
Eour years into the job at Pacific, former MLB
and Stanford third baseman Ed Sprague is having
his most difficult year in Stockton. Sprague. who
played under Marquess on both of Stanford's
NCAA Championship teams,won 30 games in each
of the past two seasons. But in 2007. the Tigers (13-
40, 1-17 Big West) have managed just one win in
conference.
"I've coached against former players before like
David Esquer at C'al and Eddie," Marquess said.
"Eddie was a great player, a major-league player
with a World Series ring and a gold medal. He's a
real special baseball player who comes from a base
ball family."
Hampered by preseason suspensions. Pacific has
struggled in both phases of the game. The Tigers'
poor ERA (6.31) is very similar to the Cardinal's,
but they have also struggled from the plate, hitting
only .267 as a team. Junior infielder Justin Baum
has been one of the few offensive bright spots, hit
ting a team-high .361 with eight home runs.
"They've had a rough year, like we've had a
rough year, but they lost four or five players for dis
ciplinary reasons before the season, which is really
almost impossible to overcome." Marquess said.
"But they're still a tough team that's played in a
couple tight games and won at UCLA."
TTie series will be somewhat unique in that the
games are split between Stanford and Stockton. In
Friday night's opener, freshman Jeff Inman (4-3.
5.02) will take on lefty Curtis Pasnia (I -6.4.63) be
fore fireworks night at Sunken Diamond. l irst
pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will go to Stockton.
Calif, with Bleich (1-8, 5.88) starting against Cole

Sophomore Erik Davis — who has started the
last three Sundays without being announced until
the weekend — has officially been named Sunday's

penultimate home game of the season. Senior
