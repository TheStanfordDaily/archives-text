"Males stopped wearing color in the early
nineteenth century."
"Space is so weird. Space is wild, wacky stuff."

"We drew a circle on the map

r
of who would be killed

immediately."
"I realize this is a really

hard question, how long do

you think humans will

survive on
\ earth?"

"Let me say
some more
things, be
cause I

haven't filled
my word quota
for today."

"A cow was executed for infanticide."
"The wolf was condemned to be hanged,
dressed in a chestnut wig and long white
beard."
"If each beam of light from the sun weighed
many tons, wouldn't that hurt a lot?"
"One of the primary founders of eugenics.
And biometrics."
"You're not required to agree with that."
"We'll just move to another planet and trash
that too, leaving a trail of dead worlds in our
wake."
"I'm just asking you to think about what you
think, here."
"I used to be in a mushroom club."
"Are we the them?"
"Never mind. This is too deep of a question."

"Blonds are going extinct soon, I think."
"There are probably some people who can't
have children because... no one would

want to be with them. I'm not talking
about anyone in this room."

"Just to make this a little more
creepy, the entire town went deaf

because of incest."

"Rednecks I feel like sort of
stay in one region."

"I could provide you with a
shovel to dig your hole, but I don't think you
need one?"
"Maybe some of you had a tail. Or have one."
i have a cat that neither feels magnanimity
nor ennui."
"The amount of energy in this room is stagger
ing. You could easily power. 1 don't know, a

flashlight?"
"That guy was so tight. I was salivating."

'Like I have to give you permission to I
blurt something out."

-Q?
, "This class is asymptotic; we never
reach an answer."
"And sheep are dumb as posts."
\ "Yeah, but so are some people."
