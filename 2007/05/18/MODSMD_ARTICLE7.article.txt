## The
						grisly career options for my corpse 
### 
Would you like to he cremat
ed after you die? To rne, it's
more appealing than heing
buried,since I don't relish the idea of
moldering away in a dark box. At
least with cremation, a quick blaze
reduces your dead body to some in
offensive powder, and your relatives
can peacefully scatter your remains
by your favorite lake. (Unless you're
related to Keith Richards, in which
case he'll snort them instead.)
But drug-addled rock stars aren't
cremation's biggest drawback. Last
month, an Australian scientist called
for an end to the practice. The rea
son? Cremation is terrible for global
warming.
Humans are made of carbon
atoms, and burning human bodies re
leases that carbon intotheair.lt turns
into carbon dioxide, the greenhouse
gas responsible fot most of global
warming. The average corpse releas
es over 100 pounds of CO2. and that
doesn't even include the carbon

dioxide from burning up caskets.
But that's not the worst of it. To
take one body from ashes to ashes, a
crematory oven blazes at 850 degrees
Celsius for an hour and a half. That
means lots of fuel, and lots of C'o2
pouring into an already over
whelmed atmosphere.
I've been contemplating the dis
posal of my corpse for some time, and
1 had pretty much decided on crema
tion. But now I'm not so sure. I feel
bad enough about all the environ
mental havoc I'm wreaking by driv
ing a car. If 1 choose cremation, my
corpse will still be polluting the Earth
