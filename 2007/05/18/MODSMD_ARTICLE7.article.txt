## The 						grisly career options for my corpse 
### 
Would you like to he cremat
ed after you die? To rne, it's
more appealing than heing
buried,since I don't relish the idea of
moldering away in a dark box. At
least with cremation, a quick blaze
reduces your dead body to some in
offensive powder, and your relatives
can peacefully scatter your remains
by your favorite lake. (Unless you're
related to Keith Richards, in which
case he'll snort them instead.)
But drug-addled rock stars aren't
cremation's biggest drawback. Last
month, an Australian scientist called
for an end to the practice. The rea
son? Cremation is terrible for global
warming.
Humans are made of carbon
atoms, and burning human bodies re
leases that carbon intotheair.lt turns
into carbon dioxide, the greenhouse
gas responsible fot most of global
warming. The average corpse releas
es over 100 pounds of CO2. and that
doesn't even include the carbon

dioxide from burning up caskets.
But that's not the worst of it. To
take one body from ashes to ashes, a
crematory oven blazes at 850 degrees
Celsius for an hour and a half. That
means lots of fuel, and lots of C'o2
pouring into an already over
whelmed atmosphere.
I've been contemplating the dis
posal of my corpse for some time, and
1 had pretty much decided on crema
tion. But now I'm not so sure. I feel
bad enough about all the environ
mental havoc I'm wreaking by driv
ing a car. If 1 choose cremation, my
corpse will still be polluting the Earth

after I'm gone. I guess it's fitting, but
I'd rather find a better way of dealing
with my last remains.
So what else is there? For answers,
1 pulled a favorite book of my shelf.
In "Stiff,"science author Mary Roach
writes about the variety of career op
tions available to corpses.
One of the first chapters describes
Roach's visit to a body farm. Cadav
ers in all states of decay are perform
ing a service to criminal forensics. To
answer the question of when a per
son died, investigators have to an
swer questions like: How fast does a

body decompose in the sun versus in
the shade? Does it matter if the body
is clothed? What happens to a body
underwater? By recreating these sce
narios with donated cadavers, re
searchers at the body farm answer
important forensic questions.
Roach's descriptions of decompo -
sition are pretty gross. She describes
the maggots that swarm one body as
a "rice grain mosh pit." which sounds
to her like crackling Rice Krispies.
Ew.
Believe it or not, there's a much
worse sound associated with human
decomposition. In life, intestinal bac
teria are hard at work breaking down
the food we eat. As they work, these
bacteria produce gas. a metabolic
byproduct that living humans elimi
nate in a familiar way.

But dead bodies can't do that, and
their bacteria go on producing gas
that has nowhere to go. The result:
bloat. The human torso swells enor
mously. Sometimes it bursts, with a
sickening ripping noise.
But all that happens to bodies left
at the mercy of the elements. Surely,
embalming and burial have eliminat
ed something as barbaric as torn tor
sos?
Maybe not. It's hard to read about
embalming protocols without winc
ing. The first cringe-worthy devices
are little things called "eye caps." Eye
caps are like contact lenses with small
sharp spikes, inserted under a per
son's eyelids. Once a decedent is fit
ted with these babies, there's no way
he can alarm mourners by snapping
open his eyes. Nor can he open his
mouth, since his lower jaw is tightly
sutured to his nostrils by way of his
mouth. A heavy-duty needle assists
in the stitching up of more private
orifices. It's not fun to think about.
Are there any other choices for a
person's last remains? Organ dona
tion is certainly noble, but it's impos
sible to ensure. Donating your body

to science is productive, hut might
not entail exactly what you had in
mind.
Mary Roach visited a particular
lab where plastic surgeons were hon
ing their skills by performing rhino
plasties and face-lifts on the severed
heads of the recently deceased. In ad
dition. auto manufacturers some
times use donated bodies as true-life
crash test dummies.
These uses may be a bit disturb
ing, but they are of medical and scien
tific importance. What happens to
some donated skin, on the other
hand, is of more questionable med
ical significance. Skin that isn't used
in. say, skin grafts for burn victims,
can be used for things like penile aug
mentation.
1 don't want my skin to end up
augmenting someone else's penis,
and 1 get pretty upset thinking about
the possibility. 1 know I won't he
around to care, and as someone who
takes pride in seeing such matters in
the cool light of reason, I'm a bit em
barrassed that it makes a difference
to me.
All this musing and 1 still don't
know what's best for my own corpse
disposal. But I guess it won't be cre
mation.
