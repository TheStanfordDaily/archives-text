# Stansky 'blitzes' talk on London bombing campaign
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
History Prof. Peter Stansky called
the London Blitz, the German air as
sault on civilian targets in the British
capital during World War 11. the
"essence of terror in its modern form"
in a lunchtime lecture yesterday. The
aerial bombardment, which raged
from September 1940 to May I'M I and
killed approximately ftfMXX) British
civilians, is also the subject of Stansky's
forthcoming book. "The First Day of
the Blitz: September 7,1940."
Stansky's talk, the most recent in
stallment in the history department's
"I lot Dates in I listory" lecture series,
focused on the context and implica
tions of the German bombing of Lon
don during the early stages of World
War 11. The history professor cited
diary entries and statistics to argue
that despite the British reputation for
maintaining a "stiff upper lip" in the
face of adversity, the Blitz had a pro
found effect on the civilian morale of
the only major power left actively re
sisting Hitler's drive for world domi
nation.

German bombers pounded Lon
don for 56 consecutive nights at one
point during the Blitz, relenting only
on November 2 because adverse
weather conditions hindered visibility.
"There was virtually no defense,"
Stansky said, noting that Nazi
bombers got through to civilian tar
gets despite British technological ad
vantages like the newly-invented
radar system and the most advanced
models of fighter planes.
But Stansky's conclusion was
hopeful. He demonstrated that the
civilian population of London per
formed far better under the stressful
conditions of the Blitz than authori
ties and pundits predicted. Although
officials estimated that 1.5 million
Britons would die in a sustained Nazi
air attack, he said, only 60,(KK) per
ished in the bombing campaign.
Morale, although shaken by the reg
ular wailing of air-raid sirens, did not
crack under the assault
"Flawed as humans are and im
perfect as their responses are," he
said, "terror bombings don't always
achieve their objectives."
