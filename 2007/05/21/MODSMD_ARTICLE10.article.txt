### Snooper INTERMISSION PEEPING TOM 
Grove's Special Dinner
Guy: I lang on. I have to go take
tequila shots with my dad...
Girl, to her friend: I want to be used
for my sexuality, not for my per
sonality. 1 have friends for that.
Friend: Obviously!
Curly-haired brunette, after the tequi
la shots: I love the word 'sassy.' It's so
glorious. And 'snarky.' So great. It's

like snotty and saucy had babies.
Exotic Erotic
Girl wearing a hath towel: Some
times small boobs are hotter, like
right now. They're just like, "Hey.
Pokin' out a little."
Girl wearing two scarves, tied less
than securely: I have the hiccups! 1
can't walk when 1 have the hiccups,
I get terrible stomach cramps!
Guy wearing another scarf: Well,
baby, I'd carry you if I were, you
know, wearing actual clothes.
Girl, confidently: 1 know.
Guy wearing a toga: My feet are
large, but I'm in charge. Let's set
the record straight.
Girl wearing... not much: Look!
You can see my boob freckle!

Chi Theta Chi
Guy wearing a
howler hat ap
proaches two
girls wearing
sundresses: You
a 11... you all look
like you're com-

ing straight out
of a 1964 Sock Hop. But you know
what? You know what? It works.
You two look like soul vixens.
Guy waiting for Girl Talk to come on
stoge:This is terrible. 1 feel like a sardine.
Girl I: Yeah, but at least sardines
have olive oil.
Girl 2: Eww, don't remind me of
Exotic Erotic's dance f100r...
Post-GirlTalk, guy eating
pho.'Throw some D's on that bitch'
â€” that song's about cars? I
thought D's stood for like... penises.
