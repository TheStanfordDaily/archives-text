## Editorial Board Save the HPACs 
### 
A mainstay of the Stanford freshman
year experience, the Head Peer Aca
demic Coordinator (HPAC), may
become a relic of the past. The University
recently announced that, in an effort to ad
dress inconsistent advising at the under
graduate level, several residences will enact
a pilot program next year to eliminate this
staff position. While individual HPACs may
be hit or miss, removing them altogether is a
negative step in reforming the advising pro
gram at Stanford.
The University should be commended
for addressing the often-criticized advising
program for undergraduates and for ex
panding the role of faculty and staff mem
bers, such as the Academic Director, in stu
dent life. Nevertheless, the removal of the
HPAC position eliminates a powerful stu
dent voice from the dorm setting.
Students often find it easier to approach
a peer or an upperclassman in asking for ac
ademic advice relating to specific classes,
majors, and course loads, especially since
these students can directly relate to Stan
ford's current academic environment, and
because they are much more accessible. In
particular, freshmen feel more familiar and
comfortable with HPACs because they live
with these individuals and see them on a
fairly regular basis.
An academic director or academic advi
sor may be able to provide valuable long
term information as far as possible career
choices, but they are not the best people to
approach when debating whether to take
the bio or humbio core, or whether to take
stats 60 during the winter or spring quarter.
Many of these advisors never studied at
Stanford, and therefore will not be as famil
iar with the ins and outs of classes or the in
tricacies of the quarter system.
Additionally. Resident Assistants (RAs)
will have to fill in the gaps left by the elimi
nation of the 11PAC position, putting pres
sure on these staff members to tackle aca
demic concerns. Also, there will not neces
sarily be one specific staff member living in
the residences to handle academic ques
tions. ITie HPAC was at least a point-person

to coordinate advising-related events with
in the dorm, as well as the one visible staff
member in the residences dedicated to giv
ing academic advice. Though individual
HPACs can still be hit or miss, they do un
dergo a fair amount of training that pre
pares them to handle student concerns re
garding academics. This is not even includ
ing the practical knowledge HPACs offer in
being si udents themselves and having taken
some of the same classes as the people ask
ing them for advice. If it is bad career advice
that the administration is worried about,
then this should be made clear to the
HPACs. Elimination of the position alto
gether will not solve the problem.

Hiring more University advising staff to
