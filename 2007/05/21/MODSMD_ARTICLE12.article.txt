# Fighting the man

You'd probably say it was a good thing
that it took nearly my entire freshman
year to figure out that, here at Stan
ford. Community Service is code for Law En
forcement. Last year 1 represented the height
of naivete, as far as the officers in tan were
concerned. I think back in amazement to all
those times 1 plugged along on my bike with
no light, whizzing by sketchy SU Vs and pick
up trucks emblazoned with 'Community Ser
vice' stickers on their imposing white hulls,
when I could have been stopped, ticketed,
and probably made some officer's day. l.ast
year, the idea of a police presence on campus
simply didn't occur to me.
Now it's the end of my sophomore year,
and things are different. I've had more than
my fair share of run-ins with the Community
Service officers. No. I haven't gotten arrested.
My record is squeaky clean. But the end re
sult of my interaction with the cops, even as
the innocent,civil party, is that I'm now in a
perpetual state of paranoia â€” not exactly the
warm, fuzzy feeling the Platitudes tell me to
feel when in the presence of John Law.
My first run-in was ridiculously stupid,
and is one I'm willing to bet many ofyou have
also experienced. One fair night, biking to
wards Tresidder, I was nabbed by an officer
hiding in the shadows near Roble forest.lTie
man was perfectly amicable. He asked me
about my academic life, which turned out to
be his way of segueing into self-deprecation:
"Economics is a good major. You can do a lot
with it. Look at me. I was a criminology major
and look what I'm doing pulling over col
lege students on bikes at 9 p.m. on ;i Thurs
day." I'm not an Econ major. but I appreciat
ed his honesty. Nonetheless, being slammed
with a fix-it ticket sort of precluded an\ sym
pathy from my end.
A few weekends ago, I was walking to
wards the Row on a Friday night, carrying a
bottle of seltzer water in hand. Now. being in
a constant state of paranoia, I was 100% sure
I would get pulled over, because, you know,
seltzer water looks suspiciously like vodka or
gin (or Sprite, Sierra Mist,or tap water). Sure
enough, less than fifteen seconds later, my vi
sion was blinded by the Light of the Law
(that's a Mag Lite), and I found myself ex
plaining to another one of our uniformed
friends that I was carrying a bottle of perfect
ly harmless Seltzer water, and that I didn't
want any trouble, sir. He had to sniff it a cou
ple of times to make sure. Eventually, he left
me to mull over the significance of his parting
words: "This is your campus."
My campus, huh. I'm not try ing to rabble
rouse. muckrake, or start a revolution. It just
seems strange to me that an increasing per
centage of my life is spent worrying about the
Community Service officer waiting around
the corner. I grant that it's an irrational fear.

since I 'm not doing anything warranting any
disciplinary measures, but there is something
unsettling about being watch-dogged at your
every step.
Parties like Exotic Erotic (and even, to
some extent, the shindig at Chi Theta Chi)
exemplify the new standard set by the Uni
versity and its relationship with the CS dept.
(that's Community Service to you, mister!).
Did anyone have fun this past Friday? If
standing in long lines guarded by uniformed
officers is your thing, maybe you had a blast.
But otherwise, the most entertainment I had
on Friday was watching the makings of a
fight shape up outside of Exotic Erotic, and.
before nary a punch was thrown, listening to
a group of four or five security forces as they
quickly mobilized into action: "What? A
fight'.' I'm there!" and "Right behind you
Jimmy!"
Everyone likes to feel safe. No one likes it
when people get mugged on the Stanford
campus, or when a laptop thief raids a dorm.
No one likes it when the Physics Department
gets busted into what seems like every other
week. We all appreciate the effortsof the men
and women who go out and try to stop crime.
Still, although I'm no expert in matters of
Criminal Justice. I'm left wondering: what
good comes out of patrolling the Row every
weekend night, accosting every dumb kid
holding a reddish looking cup. and thereby
cultivating a culture of perpetual unease?
I love how my opinions are. in the eyes of
the responsible, adult-in-charge world, the
trifling, confused views of a naive little kid
who doesn't know how good he has it. But
that's missing the point. I got along fine my
freshman year without being mugged or
stabbed, and where were the cops pulling me
over for a WWII (walking while hydrating)
then? I'm not alone in noticing a definite
trend on campus, one that points towards an
increasing police presence with no comple
mentary - subsidence of serious crime. It's
hard to make too much out of the slightly
outdated stats on the CS dept. website, so I
won't attempt to. But I'd be interested if any
one else were to weigh in on the matter.

A lex is 11 big fan of seltzer water. He loves it al
most us much as Bawls or the club soda from
the dining hall. Email him at acoleyo9(p\stan
