# Iche liebe Berlin
## 
### 
I spent my last evening in Berlin singing
bad karaoke with "the number one boss
man" of StudiVZ.net — the German ver
sion of Facebook. We were invited to the un
official office party, thrown by the boss man
himself, by my friend's German friend, who
works in customer service. The beer was
good; the people were friendly: the party,
much like the city itself, was crazy cool.
It was the perfect end to a perfect week
end in a perfect city. Although Berlin is at
least 700 years old,everything about it — the
architecture, the food, the people, the
nightlife — feels edgy, modern and young.
Unlike Paris — which, in its quest to retain
tradition and culture, is like a museum repli
ca of a city stuck in the 18th century — Berlin
is alive and constantly evolving.
Of course, a part of that modernity, no
doubt, is simply out of necessity. With large
parts of the city demolished during the Sec
ond World War only to be followed by Soviet
occupation, the city had no choice but to re
build and to redefine its identity. But instead
of trying to copy the old or completely eras
ing the remains of the past. Berliners created
an unexpected harmony of past and present.
The city is riddled with half-ruined pre
war buildings that have been perfectly inte
grated into their very post-modern surround
ings. A perfect example is the kurfursten
damm.a chic, commercial boulevard in West
Berlin that looks like a weird mix between
the Champs-Elysees and Times Square. In a
square in the middle of the boulevard stand
the remains of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial
Church.The neo-Romanesque church, which
was built in the late 1890s, was destroyed by
air raids during WWII, with only a section of
the belfry tower remaining. The belfry now
stands in ruins, with a gaping hole in the back,
the tip of the tower broken off and visible fire
damage throughout. An absolutely, unques
tionably modern grey tower with a shining
gold cross flanks the remains, serving as the
replacement for the destroyed sections of the
church. This initially jarring medley of old
and new. ruined and whole, pervades the en
tire city, helping it to retain its culture while
still acknowledging that, yes. this is the 21st
century. Something Paris has yet to do.
But apart from just looking really damn
cool, the city's day-to-day life itself reflects
this hip,edgy culture. From something as sim
ple as having a tram that runs all night (a lux
ury when you're coming from Paris) or being
able to buy a delicious Doner kebab at 3 a.m.
for less than two euros to unbelievably edgy
and artsy nightlife, the city's focus is on the
young. At the risk of sounding cliche, it
changes with the times, instead of trying to
impose a stifling facade of tradition.
E:ven the most youthful bars in Paris, un
less I've just been going to the wrong places,
have an oddly orderly feeling about them.
They're hip, but in that sense of hip where
bouncers do a "wardrobe check" before let
ting you in and the cocktails arc absurdly
overpriced. The ones that are even the least

bit "grungy" are inevitably Irish pubs. In
Berlin, all rules go out the window. There's a
bar, for instance, called "The Hole." It's hid
den in a basement and the only way in is to
literally climb through a hole in the ground.
And then there's Tacheles, an indescrib
ably crazy art project/bar and club complex
in East Berlin. Originally built to house small
businesses and boutiques, the five-story
building was taken over by the Nazis in the
'30s and became the central office of the SS.
After being heavily damaged during WWII,
the building fell into the hands of the Free
German Trade Union Federation and was
left to deteriorate. It was scheduled for dem
olition to make way for new construction, but
was saved by an artists' group. Now it's an
indie artist's haven.
The courtyard contains several makeshift
bars, including one that's inside the frame of
an old Volkswagen van. In the center are large
steel letters used as seats, and the backs of
several abandoned cars stick out of the sand
in a corner. In the building itself, the first floor

is a nightclub, while the third and fifth floors
have bars. The other floors and staircases,
which are used as artists' studios, are com
pletely empty, save the occasional piece of a
rusty bike and endless graffiti. The bar on the
top floor — the only one of the two I entered
— is small, with flashing blue lights and worn
in couches.The wall overlooking the street is
missing (probably a result of the bombings),
giving you a clear view of the courtyard and a
blank white wall, where both indie and main
stream movies are projected. It is,perhaps,the
coolest bar I have ever visited.
And as much as 1 love Paris. Berlin is per
haps the coolest city 1 have ever visited. Paris
is more beautiful and stately, of course, but it
feels like its fate has already been decided. It
was once home to the artists and to innova
tion, but now all we can do is admire what's
already there. In Berlin, on the other hand,
even for the short weekend I was there, I felt
like 1 was taking part in the city's history.
Leaving nearly broke my heart. But fortu
nately, at the end of the Studi VZ office party.
Felix, one of the guests, invited us to come
back to Germany this summer. We start in
Berlin, he said, then I take you to Munich.
Hamburg, and the greatest city in Germany:
my hometown, Frankfurt. From there, we go
to Gambia.

century. Something Paris has yet to do.
But apart from just looking really damn
cool, the city's day-to-day life itself reflects
this hip,edgy culture. From something as sim
ple as having a tram that runs all night (a lux
ury when you're coming from Paris) or being
able to buy a delicious Doner kebab at 3 a.m.
for less than two euros to unbelievably edgy
and artsy nightlife, the city's focus is on the
young. At the risk of sounding cliche, it
changes with the times, instead of trying to
impose a stifling facade of tradition.
E:ven the most youthful bars in Paris, un
less I've just been going to the wrong places,
have an oddly orderly feeling about them.
They're hip, but in that sense of hip where
bouncers do a "wardrobe check" before let
ting you in and the cocktails arc absurdly
overpriced. The ones that are even the least

bit "grungy" are inevitably Irish pubs. In
Berlin, all rules go out the window. There's a
bar, for instance, called "The Hole." It's hid
den in a basement and the only way in is to
literally climb through a hole in the ground.
And then there's Tacheles, an indescrib
ably crazy art project/bar and club complex
in East Berlin. Originally built to house small
businesses and boutiques, the five-story
building was taken over by the Nazis in the
'30s and became the central office of the SS.
After being heavily damaged during WWII,
the building fell into the hands of the Free
German Trade Union Federation and was
left to deteriorate. It was scheduled for dem
olition to make way for new construction, but
was saved by an artists' group. Now it's an
indie artist's haven.
The courtyard contains several makeshift
bars, including one that's inside the frame of
an old Volkswagen van. In the center are large
steel letters used as seats, and the backs of
several abandoned cars stick out of the sand
in a corner. In the building itself, the first floor

is a nightclub, while the third and fifth floors
have bars. The other floors and staircases,
which are used as artists' studios, are com
pletely empty, save the occasional piece of a
rusty bike and endless graffiti. The bar on the
top floor — the only one of the two I entered
— is small, with flashing blue lights and worn
in couches.The wall overlooking the street is
missing (probably a result of the bombings),
giving you a clear view of the courtyard and a
blank white wall, where both indie and main
stream movies are projected. It is,perhaps,the
coolest bar I have ever visited.
And as much as 1 love Paris. Berlin is per
haps the coolest city 1 have ever visited. Paris
is more beautiful and stately, of course, but it
feels like its fate has already been decided. It
was once home to the artists and to innova
tion, but now all we can do is admire what's
already there. In Berlin, on the other hand,
even for the short weekend I was there, I felt
like 1 was taking part in the city's history.
Leaving nearly broke my heart. But fortu
nately, at the end of the Studi VZ office party.
Felix, one of the guests, invited us to come
back to Germany this summer. We start in
Berlin, he said, then I take you to Munich.
Hamburg, and the greatest city in Germany:
my hometown, Frankfurt. From there, we go
to Gambia.
