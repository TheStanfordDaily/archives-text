# STUDENT GROUPS
## Relay for Life raises funds, awareness for cancer research Fewer students attend this year than in past 
### JULIA GUTH 
Forty tents dotted Rohle Field this
weekend, as more than 500 people par
ticipated in Relay For Life, an annual
event sponsored by the Stanford
Chapter of the American Cancer Soci
ety's (ACS) Colleges Against Cancer
program. Although the group raised
more than $55,000, the event was
smaller than those held in previous
years, event organizers said.
A total of 55 teams — many
formed by dormitories and nearby
high schools — pledged to have at
least one member walking or running
the field at all times during a 24-hour
period that began at noon on Satur
day. The event — designed to cele
brate cancer survivors and raise
money for cancer research — lasted
24 hours in order to represent cancer
patients' and survivors' daily fight
against the disease.
Turnout at the event was noticeably
lower this year in comparison to years

past. Event co-Chair Ana Pena *09,
who has worked with Relay For Life
since her freshman year in high school,
attributed the attendance drop to the
timing of the event.
"The turnout was low because we
didn't get Greek life teams due to
Rush activities," she said.
Despite turnout concerns, organiz
ers worked to keep the participants'
spirits high throughout the event.
Relay for Life featured performances
by a number of student groups, includ
ing Everyday People, Ihe Band and
Occam's Razor. There were also
games, such as bobbing for apples and
Relay Olympics, and movies that
played throughout the night.
A favorite among many of the par
ticipants was the Luminaria ceremony,
during which participants lit candles in
decorated paper bags to honor loved
ones affected by cancer.
"The Luminaria ceremony was
touching," said Patricia Arty '10. the
Otero team captain. "The slide show
of the survivors and those who passed
away from cancer got us very emo
tional."
Pin-Yi Ko '09, the coordinator of
the Luminaria ceremony, said the
group wanted to provide participants
with an intimate perspective on deal
ing with cancer.
"It's one thing to have statistics
thrown at vou." she said. "But to see

pictures sent in from family members
of cancer victims, it makes you really
want to make a difference."
Some of the students at the event
offered their own personal experi
ences as cancer survivors. Otero team
member Kate McGrath '10. who was
diagnosed with acute lymphocytic
leukemia three years ago, expressed
her gratitude towards those who
worked to make Stanford's Relay For
Life possible.
"The hard work of the volunteers
and the fundraising and the research
by ACS is making a difference in the
lives of all those touched by cancer."
McGrath said.
Joe Oehmke '10, who was diag
nosed with 1 wing's Sarcoma in 2(X)3,
stressed his desire to reach out to can

cer survivors at the event.
"Relay For Life helps me remem
ber everything I went through and to
give thanks to the people who helped
me." he said. "1 was blessed to have a
great support system, but not every
body has that."
Participants from nearby high
schools also attended the event. Karen
Tobey. the community service director
at the all-girls Castilleja School, spoke
of her students' excitement at partici
pating in the annual event.
"Once you've done it once, you
want to repeat it," Tobey said while
briskly walking the track. "Everyone
can connect to the cause."
