## On the winning track 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Over the last two weeks, Stan
ford's rotation has been rounding
into top form. Behind strong outings
in back-to-back games by sophomore
Jeremy Bleich and junior Erik Davis,
Stanford won two out of three against
a struggling Pacific team for the Car
dinal's second straight series win.
After dropping the Friday-night
series opener 13-7. the Cardinal (24-
28, 6-15 Pacific-10 Conference) re
bounded to win the next two games
11-2 and 10-5, respectively. Stanford's
all-time record against Pacific (14-42.
1-17 Big West) is now 48-7-1.
Davis (4-2) — a mid-season addi
tion to the rotation — is completing
a personal comeback after being hit
by a line drive in the face last summer
in Cape Cod League play.The Moun
tain View native won his second
straight series-clinching game by not
allowing an earned run over seven in
nings.
"1 don't really care what day 1
pitch." Davis said."But I like pitching
on Sundays. 1 feel that I'm at an ad
vantage over the other two pitchers
because I'm able to sit and chart the
hitters for three straight days and
kind of know their tendencies."
The right-hander set a new career
high with seven strikeouts. His three
most crucial punch-outs came in the
fourth inning of the scoreless game.
Zach Chamberlain hit a lead-off
triple to begin the inning, but was
stranded by the middle of the Tiger
lineup — Justin Baum (2-4, 1 RBI),

GAME NOTES: Stanford's Sunday win over Pa
cific clinched the team's second straight se
ries victory. In its best stretch of the season,
the team has won five of its last six games.
The Cardinal will finish its regular season
with a three-game set against Southern Cali
fornia this weekend.

Jason Haar and Greg Murray —
who all went down swinging.
"I was just trying to limit it to one
run." Davis said. "Once 1 got up 0-2
on the first guy. I thought,' Okay, I'm
going to strike this guy out." After I
struck out the second guy. it got into
my mind that if we throw up a zero it's
going to he big for our offense and it's
most likely [that] we'll win the game
because of the emotion that comes
from that big spot."

The Stanford bats responded to
the momentum shift almost immedi
ately. Haar (2-3) thought he got out of
the fourth inning unscathed as he
started towards the dugout after
throwing a 3-2 pitch to sophomore
Cord Phelps that was called a hall.
One pitch after the two-out walk,
sophomore Jason Castro — who en
tered the game hitting .14 l ) —hit a
two-run homerun to right field.
After the Tigers scored an un
earned run in the top of the sixth, the
Cardinal blew the game open with
eight straight hits once again on two

outs. The eight-run outburst again
hinged on Castro (2-3, 3 RBI), who
hit an RBI single off the glove of div
ing shortstop Josh Powers. Junior
Michael Taylor provided the excla
mation point on the inning and his se
ries with a three-run home run well
over the left-field wall.
"We've hit better, really, the last
month," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "The weather conditions help a
little bit. It's hotter, so the ball travels
farther and the ground's harder, but

we had averaged 12 to 13 hits a game
recently. We've done a much better
job."
In Saturday's game at Stockton,
lileich (2-8) controlled the Pacific of
fense, scattering seven hits and two
runs, while striking out seven. Die
win was the sophomore's first com
plete game of his career and his first
win in 11 starts. Uleich's last victory
came on l-'eb. 25 against Kansas.
"It's been a rough season,so it felt
good tn pitch well and gel a complete
game," lileich told (ioStanford.com.
"I was relaxed and really let the game
come to me instead of trying to force
things. As a result. 1 was able to get
out of some key situations."
Stanford provided all the offense
lileich would need via the long ball.
Sophomore Sean Ratliff (3-5,5 RBI)
hit two home runs in a game for the
third time this season. One of Shin
lord's leaders in all offensive cate
gories, Ratliff led off the scoring with
a solo shot in the fourth off Cole

Akins (2-3) and then added a three
run home run in a six-run ninth in
ning that put the game out of reach,
11-2.
Pacific took the 1-0 series lead on
Friday behind a dynamic offensive
performance of its own, racking up
17 hits. Hie Tigers got to freshman
Jeff Ininan (44) early on, scoring
seven runs in the first three innings
for starter ('urtis Pasma.
Chamberlain (2-4) and Baum (2-
4) hit back-to-back doubles in a four
run third that stretched the lead to 7-
3. John Joines (3-4, 4 Rlil) singled
home the eventual winning run in
the fifth off sophomore reliever
Austin Yount.
Stanford will play its last home
game tomorrow night against UC-
Davis.'lhe Cardinal still has a shot at
avoiding its first losing season since
1993. but needs to win all four of its
remaining games in order to achieve
that goal.
".500 is a goal,but we just want to
take it one game at a time because 1
think, after last weekend, we got
eaught looking ahead a little bit and
that's why we lost on Friday night,"
Davis said. "Anybody can beat us
and we can beat anybody, so we just

need to take every game one at a
time."

Over the last two weeks, Stan
ford's rotation has been rounding
into top form. Behind strong outings
in back-to-back games by sophomore
Jeremy Bleich and junior Erik Davis,
Stanford won two out of three against
a struggling Pacific team for the Car
dinal's second straight series win.
After dropping the Friday-night
series opener 13-7. the Cardinal (24-
28, 6-15 Pacific-10 Conference) re
bounded to win the next two games
11-2 and 10-5, respectively. Stanford's
all-time record against Pacific (14-42.
1-17 Big West) is now 48-7-1.
Davis (4-2) — a mid-season addi
tion to the rotation — is completing
a personal comeback after being hit
by a line drive in the face last summer
in Cape Cod League play.The Moun
tain View native won his second
straight series-clinching game by not
allowing an earned run over seven in
nings.
"1 don't really care what day 1
pitch." Davis said."But I like pitching
on Sundays. 1 feel that I'm at an ad
vantage over the other two pitchers
because I'm able to sit and chart the
hitters for three straight days and
kind of know their tendencies."
The right-hander set a new career
high with seven strikeouts. His three
most crucial punch-outs came in the
fourth inning of the scoreless game.
Zach Chamberlain hit a lead-off
triple to begin the inning, but was
stranded by the middle of the Tiger
lineup — Justin Baum (2-4, 1 RBI),

GAME NOTES: Stanford's Sunday win over Pa
cific clinched the team's second straight se
ries victory. In its best stretch of the season,
the team has won five of its last six games.
The Cardinal will finish its regular season
with a three-game set against Southern Cali
fornia this weekend.

Jason Haar and Greg Murray —
who all went down swinging.
"I was just trying to limit it to one
run." Davis said. "Once 1 got up 0-2
on the first guy. I thought,' Okay, I'm
going to strike this guy out." After I
struck out the second guy. it got into
my mind that if we throw up a zero it's
going to he big for our offense and it's
most likely [that] we'll win the game
because of the emotion that comes
from that big spot."

The Stanford bats responded to
the momentum shift almost immedi
ately. Haar (2-3) thought he got out of
the fourth inning unscathed as he
started towards the dugout after
throwing a 3-2 pitch to sophomore
Cord Phelps that was called a hall.
One pitch after the two-out walk,
sophomore Jason Castro — who en
tered the game hitting .14 l ) —hit a
two-run homerun to right field.
After the Tigers scored an un
earned run in the top of the sixth, the
Cardinal blew the game open with
eight straight hits once again on two

outs. The eight-run outburst again
hinged on Castro (2-3, 3 RBI), who
hit an RBI single off the glove of div
ing shortstop Josh Powers. Junior
Michael Taylor provided the excla
mation point on the inning and his se
ries with a three-run home run well
over the left-field wall.
"We've hit better, really, the last
month," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "The weather conditions help a
little bit. It's hotter, so the ball travels
farther and the ground's harder, but
