## On the winning track 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Over the last two weeks, Stan
ford's rotation has been rounding
into top form. Behind strong outings
in back-to-back games by sophomore
Jeremy Bleich and junior Erik Davis,
Stanford won two out of three against
a struggling Pacific team for the Car
dinal's second straight series win.
After dropping the Friday-night
series opener 13-7. the Cardinal (24-
28, 6-15 Pacific-10 Conference) re
bounded to win the next two games
11-2 and 10-5, respectively. Stanford's
all-time record against Pacific (14-42.
1-17 Big West) is now 48-7-1.
Davis (4-2) — a mid-season addi
tion to the rotation — is completing
a personal comeback after being hit
by a line drive in the face last summer
in Cape Cod League play.The Moun
tain View native won his second
straight series-clinching game by not
allowing an earned run over seven in
nings.
"1 don't really care what day 1
pitch." Davis said."But I like pitching
on Sundays. 1 feel that I'm at an ad
vantage over the other two pitchers
because I'm able to sit and chart the
hitters for three straight days and
kind of know their tendencies."
The right-hander set a new career
high with seven strikeouts. His three
most crucial punch-outs came in the
fourth inning of the scoreless game.
Zach Chamberlain hit a lead-off
triple to begin the inning, but was
stranded by the middle of the Tiger
lineup — Justin Baum (2-4, 1 RBI),

GAME NOTES: Stanford's Sunday win over Pa
cific clinched the team's second straight se
ries victory. In its best stretch of the season,
the team has won five of its last six games.
The Cardinal will finish its regular season
with a three-game set against Southern Cali
fornia this weekend.

Jason Haar and Greg Murray —
who all went down swinging.
"I was just trying to limit it to one
run." Davis said. "Once 1 got up 0-2
on the first guy. I thought,' Okay, I'm
going to strike this guy out." After I
struck out the second guy. it got into
my mind that if we throw up a zero it's
going to he big for our offense and it's
most likely [that] we'll win the game
because of the emotion that comes
from that big spot."

The Stanford bats responded to
the momentum shift almost immedi
ately. Haar (2-3) thought he got out of
the fourth inning unscathed as he
started towards the dugout after
throwing a 3-2 pitch to sophomore
Cord Phelps that was called a hall.
One pitch after the two-out walk,
sophomore Jason Castro — who en
tered the game hitting .14 l ) —hit a
two-run homerun to right field.
After the Tigers scored an un
earned run in the top of the sixth, the
Cardinal blew the game open with
eight straight hits once again on two

outs. The eight-run outburst again
hinged on Castro (2-3, 3 RBI), who
hit an RBI single off the glove of div
ing shortstop Josh Powers. Junior
Michael Taylor provided the excla
mation point on the inning and his se
ries with a three-run home run well
over the left-field wall.
"We've hit better, really, the last
month," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "The weather conditions help a
little bit. It's hotter, so the ball travels
farther and the ground's harder, but
