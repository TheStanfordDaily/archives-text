GAME NOTES: Stanford's match against
UCLA marks the third time the teams have
met this year; the Cardinal narrowly won
the first two, each by 4-3. Going into
today's match, Stanford currently holds a
21 -match winning streak. With another win
today, the women will face either rival Cal
or No. 2 Georgia Tech in the finals.

advanced the Cardinal to a Sunday
quarterf inal match-up against Miami.
Interestingly enough, Stanford de
feated the Hurricanes in the finals of
last years NCAA Championships.
As Brennan explained before
hand, this year's Miami team present
ed a different challenge from Vander
bilt in that the I lurricanes had a star
at the front of their lineup: Audra
Cohen.
Although Cohen (whom Brennan
called one of the best players in the
NCAA) had her way with Stanford's
No. 1 senior Theresa Logar in straight
sets, it wasn't enough for the Hurri
canes. The Cardinal emerged from
the match with another 4-1 victory,
outclassing the Miami competition by
winning the doubles point and domi
nating the rest of singles play.
I .ogar's loss against Cohen was in
dicative of how dominant the Cardinal
has been in advancing to the semifinals
it was the first time Stanford lost a
single team point in the entire 64-team
tournament.
In beating Miami, Stanford
reached the semifinal round for the
25th time in the last 26 years. And iron
ically enough, the team will now face a
familiar opponent in Pac-10 rival:
UCLA.
'Ihe two teams face off for the third
time this year; needless to say, the
stakes are a bit higher this time
around.
UCLA, ranked No. 12 in the na
tion. wasn't the most likely candidate
to reach tennis's version of the Final
Four. Ihe Bruins made it to today's
semifinal showdown with a surprising
4-3 victory over a perennial power
house. No. 4 Florida.
Although UCLA is led by fresh
man Yasmin Schnack and junior Riza
Xalameda, senior Alex MeGoodwin
was the hero in the gutty victory over
the Gators. MeGoodwin captured a

tie-breaking victory in her match, pro
pelling the Bruins into today's show
down with Stanford.
Joining Stanford in the Final Four
are archrival ("aland (ieorgia 'lech. A

sure an interesting final match-up for
tomorrow — Stanford would face ei
ther the hated Bears or the rival Yel
low Jackets, the very team that ended
the Cardinal's historic 89-match win
ning in early February.
Cal 's surprising 4-1 win over (ieor
gia yesterday cemented the Pac-10's
dominance; three of the four teams re
maining in the championships are
from the conference.
Brennan was pleasantly surprised
with the strength the Pac-10 has shown
in the postseason.
"1 think it's great." he said. "I;very
one likes to think the SIX is a stronger
conference, but we're starting to prove
that the Pac-10 is the top conference in
the country."
Although no players were avail
able for comment at the time of press,
beating UCLA for a third time this
season will be no easy task tor the
Card. As both coaches and players
have mentioned in the past, it's never
easy beating anyone three times in a
season.
In general, though, the Cardinal is

more focused on its own play than it is
on that of its opponents.
"I don't think we care much about
who we play," Brennan said.
1 )espite all the pressure the women
face in trying to capture a fourth
straight national championship, team
co-captain Yelsey said that the atmos
phere around the squad is focused, yet
loose.
"It's a really, really cool and calm
mood," she said. "We're having a good
time; people aren't stressed out and it's
a fun atmosphere."
And with his team on the verge of
capturing another title, Brennan
couldn't help but gush over the Cardi
nal's accomplishments this season.
"'lhis was probably the year where
we had the most adversity," said Bren
nan. who is in his 12th year on the Stan
lord staff. "We had a lot of challenges
facing us with injuries and illness. It
was one of those years where we could
easily have had three or four losses.
"For us to come out of the season
with only one loss and to be at the
doorstep with a really solid team, it's
really exciting," he added." lhis is why
you do it... it's been an unbelievable
year."

Card. As both coaches and players
have mentioned in the past, it's never
easy beating anyone three times in a
season.
In general, though, the Cardinal is

more focused on its own play than it is
on that of its opponents.
"I don't think we care much about
who we play," Brennan said.
1 )espite all the pressure the women
face in trying to capture a fourth
straight national championship, team
co-captain Yelsey said that the atmos
phere around the squad is focused, yet
loose.
"It's a really, really cool and calm
mood," she said. "We're having a good
time; people aren't stressed out and it's
a fun atmosphere."
And with his team on the verge of
capturing another title, Brennan
couldn't help but gush over the Cardi
nal's accomplishments this season.
"'lhis was probably the year where
we had the most adversity," said Bren
nan. who is in his 12th year on the Stan
lord staff. "We had a lot of challenges
facing us with injuries and illness. It
was one of those years where we could
easily have had three or four losses.
"For us to come out of the season
with only one loss and to be at the
doorstep with a really solid team, it's
really exciting," he added." lhis is why
you do it... it's been an unbelievable
year."

Vanderbilt put up its best fight, but

advanced the Cardinal to a Sunday
quarterf inal match-up against Miami.
Interestingly enough, Stanford de
feated the Hurricanes in the finals of
last years NCAA Championships.
As Brennan explained before
hand, this year's Miami team present
ed a different challenge from Vander
bilt in that the I lurricanes had a star
at the front of their lineup: Audra
Cohen.
Although Cohen (whom Brennan
called one of the best players in the
NCAA) had her way with Stanford's
No. 1 senior Theresa Logar in straight
sets, it wasn't enough for the Hurri
canes. The Cardinal emerged from
the match with another 4-1 victory,
outclassing the Miami competition by
winning the doubles point and domi
nating the rest of singles play.
I .ogar's loss against Cohen was in
dicative of how dominant the Cardinal
has been in advancing to the semifinals
it was the first time Stanford lost a
single team point in the entire 64-team
tournament.
In beating Miami, Stanford
reached the semifinal round for the
25th time in the last 26 years. And iron
ically enough, the team will now face a
familiar opponent in Pac-10 rival:
UCLA.
'Ihe two teams face off for the third
time this year; needless to say, the
stakes are a bit higher this time
around.
UCLA, ranked No. 12 in the na
tion. wasn't the most likely candidate
to reach tennis's version of the Final
Four. Ihe Bruins made it to today's
semifinal showdown with a surprising
4-3 victory over a perennial power
house. No. 4 Florida.
Although UCLA is led by fresh
man Yasmin Schnack and junior Riza
Xalameda, senior Alex MeGoodwin
was the hero in the gutty victory over
the Gators. MeGoodwin captured a

tie-breaking victory in her match, pro
pelling the Bruins into today's show
down with Stanford.
Joining Stanford in the Final Four
are archrival ("aland (ieorgia 'lech. A
('ardinal victory over l)( 1 A will en
sure an interesting final match-up for
tomorrow — Stanford would face ei
ther the hated Bears or the rival Yel
low Jackets, the very team that ended
the Cardinal's historic 89-match win
ning in early February.
Cal 's surprising 4-1 win over (ieor
gia yesterday cemented the Pac-10's
dominance; three of the four teams re
maining in the championships are
from the conference.
Brennan was pleasantly surprised
with the strength the Pac-10 has shown
in the postseason.
"1 think it's great." he said. "I;very
one likes to think the SIX is a stronger
conference, but we're starting to prove
that the Pac-10 is the top conference in
the country."
Although no players were avail
able for comment at the time of press,
beating UCLA for a third time this
season will be no easy task tor the
Card. As both coaches and players
have mentioned in the past, it's never
easy beating anyone three times in a
season.
In general, though, the Cardinal is

more focused on its own play than it is
on that of its opponents.
