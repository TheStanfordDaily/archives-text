## Pub night mix-up leads to discontent Seniors and grad students crowd Nola's in snafu 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mixing graduate students with un
dergrads usually works as well as
blending oil with water. But put them
together in an overcrowded Palo Alto
bar hosting simultaneous events, add
in long lines and missing wristbands,
and voila: the mixture is a recipe for
disaster.
Senior Night and Graduate Pub
Night were held at overlapping ven
ues in Palo Alto late Thursday night,
leading many students who attended
to complain about overcrowding and

long lines.
()rganizers of Senior Night — bet
ter known as "Pub Night." the semi
regular senior outing to loeal bars —
said they were not informed until too
late that graduate students would also
be at Nola's,one of the places they had
booked for themselves. But since or
ganizers do not reserve Senior Night
venues for exclusive use. they had no
choice but tosharc the space with hun
dreds of graduate students.
Graduate Pub Night organizers ad
mitted some lapses in planning, but
promised the oversights would be
ironed out in the future as the event is
held more regularly
"'lhat was an oversight on our
part," said Annemarie Baltay, one of
the graduate organizers. "We should
have double-checked to make sure
that undergrads wouldn't be there."
Seniors were caught by surprise by
the number of graduate students at
Nola's.
Utsav Sethi '07, like many other
seniors, left Nola's and Old Pro — the
official Senior Night venues — for
other bars in Palo Alto soon after ar
riving.
"1 was pretty disappointed, and it
was crowded." he said. "Pretty much
everyone felt that way. There were a
lot of non-seniors there. A lot of peo
ple were looking forward to it, since it

was the second-to-last Senior Night
and all."
Meanwhile, graduate students, en
joying their first Pub Night since au
tumn quarter, showed up en masse,
causing their own logistical problems.
Organizers estimated that over 2(X)
graduate students — up from 50 in
the fall — attended the event at
Nola's, spurred in part by graduate
student-only drink discounts that
event organizers arranged with the
bar beforehand.
"It was way more people than I ex
pected." Baltay said.
The large turnout also outstripped
the drink-discount wristbands. As a
result, many students demanded dis
counts from the bar despite lacking a
wristband to prove their eligibility.
Bartenders, unable to determine who
was a graduate student and who was

not, refused to grant the special prices
to anyone without a wristband.
"We can't give out discounted
drinks to just anybody," said John
Mylod. a manager at Nola's. "When it
comes to the wristbands, you have to
be able to take care of that stuff. You
can't expect us to do it for you."
As the year winds down, organiz
ers for both events say that a similar
conflict is unlikely to occur in the fu
ture. And if they never meet up again,
it will suit both parties just fine.
"Ideally, we wouldn't want to go to
the same place," Baltay said. "Let the
senior class have their fun and let grad
students have their fun."
The next Graduate Pub Night is
scheduled for May 31 at Nola's.
