Stanford's annual semi-nude and fully-risque
Fxotic P'rotic party drew hundreds of students to
680 l.omita on Friday night. But unlike previous
years — when rowdy students forced the Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS) to shut down the
party — this year's event was tightly monitored to
ensure that the festivities did not get out of hand.
"'lhe staff of 680 has done a tremendous job of
planning this event," said Ralph Castro, alcohol
and drug educator for Health Promotion Services
at Vaden I lealth ( enter, who helped to oversee the
party."As I University administration, we want to be
liere to help them and support them in makingsure
this is a successful event. 'Ihis is a high-risk event
with a large number of people on campus."
'Ihis year's party-goers had to pick up tickets in
the week preceding the event, and those who neg
lected to do so were forced to wait until 11 p.m. —
an hour after the party began — to enter the
soiree.

According to Associate Director of Residential
I Education Nate Boswell, who has monitored I w
otic Krotic for the past four years, the event's or
ganization resulted in a smoothlv-run party. I le
added that there was no increase in police pres
ence or security measures from last year's event.
"We just set up a little bit earlier and tried to be
a little more proactive." he said. "'lhis event is con
sidered a high-risk party, but the student stal l and
the administration have worked very, very, very
hard this year to actually make sure this was a safe
event for everybody."
Many students at the party told 'Ilie Daily that
the tempered selling was clearly noticeable.
Natalie Ramirez'o7. who went to Hxotic Frolic
as a freshman three years ago. said she was "trau
matized" by that year's party. In 2004.1 • xotie Parot
ic was shut down at midnight, when students tore
down a fence and entered 680 l.omita without
DPS consent.
"I didn't go the last two years because I just did
n't want to deal with it." Ramirez said Friday night,
"but this definitely seems like a good setup."

In preparation for the event, the (>ll ice of Stu
dent Activities briefed the staff and residents of
6801 omita a week in advance on their obligations
for the night of the party. Most of the house's resi
dents were assigned shifts as "sober monitors," on
duty to quell any problems.
Increased I Jniversity involvement at this year's
party did not stop revelers from sporting the cre
ative. scanty outfits characteristic of I 'xotie Frotic
— which mandates a maximum of one article of
clothing for men and two for women.
While many male students wore the traditional
Speedo, one wore i Borat-style green swimsuit.
Some girls, meanwhile, wrapped themselves in col
ored Saran wrap, but two adventurous women duct
taped old issues ol" 1 Tie I )aily over their bodies.
"It's an experience," said Fun Hyde '10. who
wore a bathrobe. "It's my first year; I've got to
check it out. I can't go around next year saying that
I didn't check it out this year."

Hundreds of students attended 680 Lomita's Exotic Erotic party on Friday. This year, attendees were required to pick up tickets for the party in the week
preceding the event, and the Office of Student Activities was heavily involved in ensuring that the party ran smoothly and was safe for students.
