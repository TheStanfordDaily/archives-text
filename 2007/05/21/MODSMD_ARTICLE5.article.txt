### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore pitcher Missy
Pcnna carried Stanford soft ball to
the final day of Regionals with two
shutout wins on Friday, but it
proved too much to ask her to sum
mon the magic for another day
No. IS Stanford (33-21-1) fell to
No. 3 I.SU in the regional final on
Saturday. 11-5. after beating Cal
State-Northridge 3-0 and No. 23
Fresno State 1-0 the day before to
stave off elimination.
Penna pitched every scoreless
inning of the two victories, but the
effort had taken its toll by the time
the I.SU game rolled around. Ihe
Tigers (55-10) scored in every in
ning except the third and nailed
five home runs against Penna to
break out for 11 runs after scoring
just four in the two previous games
combined.
Stanford's offense also woke up
and doubled its offensive produc
tion in the regional (alter four runs
in the previous three games), but it
was not enough for the Cardinal.
Junior right-hander Becky McCul
lough pitched the last two innings
for Stanford after Penna stepped
down.
"I think Missy did an outstand
ing job of giving it everything she
had." Stanford head coach John

Rittman said. "Obviously, she ran
out of gas, and some of their hitters
stepped up."
I SlPs Rachel Mitchell led the
Tigers' charge with a booming solo
homer in the first inning before
knocking a grand slam beyond the
right-field fence in the second.
Mitchell, who hit the Tigers' game
winning home run in extr.i innings
against Fresno State the day be
fore. was named the Regional
MVP
l.eslie Klein put I.SU up for
good in the fourth inning with a
two-run homer that made it a 7-5
game. Quinlan Duhon and Andrea
Smith led off the fifth and sixth in
nines with solo home runs
