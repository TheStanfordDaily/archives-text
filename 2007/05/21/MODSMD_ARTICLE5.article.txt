### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore pitcher Missy
Pcnna carried Stanford soft ball to
the final day of Regionals with two
shutout wins on Friday, but it
proved too much to ask her to sum
mon the magic for another day
No. IS Stanford (33-21-1) fell to
No. 3 I.SU in the regional final on
Saturday. 11-5. after beating Cal
State-Northridge 3-0 and No. 23
Fresno State 1-0 the day before to
stave off elimination.
Penna pitched every scoreless
inning of the two victories, but the
effort had taken its toll by the time
the I.SU game rolled around. Ihe
Tigers (55-10) scored in every in
ning except the third and nailed
five home runs against Penna to
break out for 11 runs after scoring
just four in the two previous games
combined.
Stanford's offense also woke up
and doubled its offensive produc
tion in the regional (alter four runs
in the previous three games), but it
was not enough for the Cardinal.
Junior right-hander Becky McCul
lough pitched the last two innings
for Stanford after Penna stepped
down.
"I think Missy did an outstand
ing job of giving it everything she
had." Stanford head coach John

Rittman said. "Obviously, she ran
out of gas, and some of their hitters
stepped up."
I SlPs Rachel Mitchell led the
Tigers' charge with a booming solo
homer in the first inning before
knocking a grand slam beyond the
right-field fence in the second.
Mitchell, who hit the Tigers' game
winning home run in extr.i innings
against Fresno State the day be
fore. was named the Regional
MVP
l.eslie Klein put I.SU up for
good in the fourth inning with a
two-run homer that made it a 7-5
game. Quinlan Duhon and Andrea
Smith led off the fifth and sixth in
nines with solo home runs

Sophomore Missy Penna unwinds on Fresno State hitters during Stanford's
1 -0 victory in the regional this past Friday. Despite the efforts of Penna and
her teammates, LSU ended the Cardinal's season with an 1 1 -5 win.
"It was a game of momentum
shifts, and they had a lot of big hits,"
Rittman said.
The Cardinal managed to keep
pace with LSU in the early innings
before the Tigers' barrage of homers
put them beyond reach. After
Mitchell's solo shot in the first. Stan
ford came back in the bottom of the
inning with a three-run blast to left
center by sophomore third baseman
Maddy Coon, making it 3-1. Cardi
nal.
Mitchell gave LSU a 5-3 lead with
her grand slam in the second, but
Stanford tied it up in the third. A pair
of LSU errors turned into a pair of
Cardinal runs, as junior Tricia Ag
gabao and freshman Alissa Haber
scored after leading off the inning
with a single and a double, chasing
LSU starter Lmilv Turner.
With 1 labcr and Aggabao on sec
ond and third respectively, junior
cleanup hitter Michelle Smith
cracked a line drive to left field.
LSU's Jazz Jackson came in for the
ball, but missed the catch around her
ankles, allowing Haber to move up
and Aggabao to score. The LSU
shortstop then booted a sharp
grounder from Coon. Ilaber scored,
but freshman Michelle Schroeder,
pinch-running for Smith, was cut
down at the plate for the first out of
the inning. The Cardinal went in
order after that to end the threat.
"| We're] not ready to end our sea
son — you never are." Rittman said.
"But, I 'm very proud of our team and
the way we fought."
It was a disappointing end to a re
gional that had a lot of bright mo
ments for the Cardinal. After losing
the opening game to Fresno State, 2-
0. Stanford rebounded to win a dou
ble header the next day.
Penna struck out eight and al
lowed only two hits in the first game
(against Cal State-Northridge) be
fore taking her near-flawless pitching
to another level against the Bulldogs.
She allowed only three hits and had
11 Ks against the high-octane Fresno
State offense, including a pair of
back-to-back, swinging strikeouts
with the bases loaded to end the top
of the fifth inning.
"Missy pitched extremely well
and got in a rhythm." Rittman said.
"She's very strong and she can go all
day, so we knew that if we got by the
first [gamej and got her in rhythm, we
would be in pretty good shape for the
second one."
Penna helped her own cause by
scoring two of Stanford's four runs
on the day.
Two of the Cardinal's three runs
against Northridge were the result of
savvy base-running. In the fifth in
ning, junior first baseman Erin Howe

screened the CSUN shortstop near
second base after Penna hit a hard
grounder to the left side. The short
stop. Micah Putnam.saw the hall late
and ended up booting it into the out
field. allowing I lowe to score.
Two at-bats later, after senior left
fielder Jackie Rinehart hit an infield
single to move Penna to third. Put
nam again deflected the ball into the
outfield, this time on a stolen base at
tempt by the speedy Rinehart. Penna
scored easily.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill
rounded out the scoring with a solo
home run to straightaway center
field in the sixth.
Howe injured her right knee after
crashing into the Northridge catcher
while scoring in the fifth and had to
be carried off the field. The extent of
her injury is not yet known.
Stanford's lone run against Fres
no State also came courtesy of a de
flection. With Penna standing on sec
ond in the top of the third. Aggabao
smacked a ball right back at Fresno's
pitcher Robin Mackin. who could
only redirect the ball into right field,
allowing Penna to score.
Penna scored the run in between
dominating stretches of pitching.
After three singles in the fifth loaded
the bases and broke up her no-hitter.
Penna retired eight of the next nine
batters (four on strikeouts) to ice the
game and secure another victory for
the Cardinal.
"I was just trying to think about
one pitch at a time," Penna said of her
virtuoso performace.
This is the second straight year
that Stanford has knocked Fresno
State out of the NCAA Tournament.
Last year, the Cardinal beat the Bull
dogs twice on the final day of compe
tition to advance to the Super Re
gionals. This year, however, it could
n't do the same.

put them beyond reach. After
Mitchell's solo shot in the first. Stan
ford came back in the bottom of the
inning with a three-run blast to left
center by sophomore third baseman
Maddy Coon, making it 3-1. Cardi
nal.
Mitchell gave LSU a 5-3 lead with
her grand slam in the second, but
Stanford tied it up in the third. A pair
of LSU errors turned into a pair of
Cardinal runs, as junior Tricia Ag
gabao and freshman Alissa Haber
scored after leading off the inning
with a single and a double, chasing
LSU starter Lmilv Turner.
With 1 labcr and Aggabao on sec
ond and third respectively, junior
cleanup hitter Michelle Smith
cracked a line drive to left field.
LSU's Jazz Jackson came in for the
ball, but missed the catch around her
ankles, allowing Haber to move up
and Aggabao to score. The LSU
shortstop then booted a sharp
grounder from Coon. Ilaber scored,
but freshman Michelle Schroeder,
pinch-running for Smith, was cut
down at the plate for the first out of
the inning. The Cardinal went in
order after that to end the threat.
"| We're] not ready to end our sea
son — you never are." Rittman said.
"But, I 'm very proud of our team and
the way we fought."
It was a disappointing end to a re
gional that had a lot of bright mo
ments for the Cardinal. After losing
the opening game to Fresno State, 2-
0. Stanford rebounded to win a dou
ble header the next day.
Penna struck out eight and al
lowed only two hits in the first game
(against Cal State-Northridge) be
fore taking her near-flawless pitching
to another level against the Bulldogs.
She allowed only three hits and had
11 Ks against the high-octane Fresno
State offense, including a pair of
back-to-back, swinging strikeouts
with the bases loaded to end the top
of the fifth inning.
"Missy pitched extremely well
and got in a rhythm." Rittman said.
"She's very strong and she can go all
day, so we knew that if we got by the
first [gamej and got her in rhythm, we
would be in pretty good shape for the
second one."
Penna helped her own cause by
scoring two of Stanford's four runs
on the day.
Two of the Cardinal's three runs
against Northridge were the result of
savvy base-running. In the fifth in
ning, junior first baseman Erin Howe

screened the CSUN shortstop near
second base after Penna hit a hard
grounder to the left side. The short
stop. Micah Putnam.saw the hall late
and ended up booting it into the out
field. allowing I lowe to score.
Two at-bats later, after senior left
fielder Jackie Rinehart hit an infield
single to move Penna to third. Put
nam again deflected the ball into the
outfield, this time on a stolen base at
tempt by the speedy Rinehart. Penna
scored easily.
Freshman catcher Rosey Neill
rounded out the scoring with a solo
home run to straightaway center
field in the sixth.
Howe injured her right knee after
crashing into the Northridge catcher
while scoring in the fifth and had to
be carried off the field. The extent of
her injury is not yet known.
Stanford's lone run against Fres
no State also came courtesy of a de
flection. With Penna standing on sec
ond in the top of the third. Aggabao
smacked a ball right back at Fresno's
pitcher Robin Mackin. who could
only redirect the ball into right field,
allowing Penna to score.
Penna scored the run in between
dominating stretches of pitching.
After three singles in the fifth loaded
the bases and broke up her no-hitter.
Penna retired eight of the next nine
batters (four on strikeouts) to ice the
game and secure another victory for
the Cardinal.
"I was just trying to think about
one pitch at a time," Penna said of her
virtuoso performace.
This is the second straight year
that Stanford has knocked Fresno
State out of the NCAA Tournament.
Last year, the Cardinal beat the Bull
dogs twice on the final day of compe
tition to advance to the Super Re
gionals. This year, however, it could
n't do the same.

Saturday. 11-5. after beating Cal
State-Northridge 3-0 and No. 23

five home runs against Penna to
break out for 11 runs after scoring
just four in the two previous games
combined.
Stanford's offense also woke up
and doubled its offensive produc
tion in the regional (alter four runs
in the previous three games), but it
was not enough for the Cardinal.
Junior right-hander Becky McCul
lough pitched the last two innings
for Stanford after Penna stepped
down.
"I think Missy did an outstand
ing job of giving it everything she
had." Stanford head coach John

Rittman said. "Obviously, she ran
out of gas, and some of their hitters
stepped up."
I SlPs Rachel Mitchell led the
Tigers' charge with a booming solo
homer in the first inning before
knocking a grand slam beyond the
right-field fence in the second.
Mitchell, who hit the Tigers' game
winning home run in extr.i innings
