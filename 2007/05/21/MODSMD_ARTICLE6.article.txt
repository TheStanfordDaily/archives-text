## Interdisciplinary fellowships created 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students seeking fund
ing for their interdisciplinary re
search will soon be one step closer to
jumping financial hurdles, as Presi
dent John I lenncssy announced the
establishment of the Stanford Inter
disciplinary Graduate Fellowships
program at last Ihursday's Academ
ic ('ouncil meeting.
An anonymous donor has alreadv
pledged $25 million towards the pro
gram. and the University hopes to
eventually raise enough mones to
fund 100 fellowships.
While many graduate students re
ceive money from their departments

or from outside companies and gov
ernment agencies interested in their
work, students in interdisciplinary
fields — who do not necessarily be
long to a department or do not pur
sue work in which outside groups are
interested — may struggle to find
funding.
"Ihe increasing presence of stu
dents doing interdisciplinary re
search who often have less access to
traditional department-based fund
ing or external agency funding has
created new needs for research fund
ing for our students," I lenncssy said.
Doctoral students who plan on
pursuing interdisciplinary research
— either through Stanford's several
interdisciplinary research centers or

through an individually designed
program — can begin applying lor
the first fellowships next year, and
the grants will be disbursed in au
tumn of 2008.
Ihe program will be modeled on
the existing Stanford Graduate Fel
lowships program, which provides
three years of tuition support and a
stipend for select students in the sci
ences and in engineering. 'Ihat pro
grain. which awards 100 fellowships
each year, is supported by a $200 mil
lion endowment.
Ilenucssy's announcement was
met with enthusiasm from the gradu
ate community.
" litis program will give students
,n) opportunitN to do research they
otherwise would not be able to do,"

s;iiJ (iraduatc Student Council co-
Chair Kristina Keating. "It's a great
announcement,and we're ver\ excit
ed about it."
At Thursday's meeting, I lennessy
also announced that $2.5 billion has
been raised for the $4.3 billion Stan
lord ('hallenge initiated last year. I le
called the effort "the most successful

campaign in the I niversity's history"
lite president also said that His
tory Prof. A 1 Camarillo will take up
the newly created position of special
assistant to the President for faculty
diversity.
