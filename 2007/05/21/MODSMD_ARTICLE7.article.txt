## Sarah Silverman: charmingly offensive 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Star comedian Sarah Silverman once again demon
strated she — and she alone — need not follow the rules
of a politieally-correet universe.
In her eoyly self-depreeating style. Silverman joked
about topics ranging from rape to her boyfriend Jimim
Kimmel to sex. Hut no matter the material, the packed
audience at Memorial Auditorium consistently gasped at
first with umbrage.only for laughter to win out and save
Silverman from a Don Imus-like fate.
"I went out with a half-black guy. who dumped me be
cause I'm such a fucking loser," she said before pausing
in mock self-reflection. "Wow. I just heard mysell say
that I'm such a pessimist. I le's half-white."

In hgr stand-up routine on Sunday So'ah
Silverman pretends to make tove with seme Baby Be!
cheese.
Silverman knows how thin her tightrope is. and
she is acutely aware of the stakes should she tall, as
she did with the punch line "I love chinks"on a 2(X)1
episode of "Late Night with Conan O'Brien." earn
ing the wrath ot Asian-American groups. So last
night, while she did plenty to offend — dropping the
worst racist and homophobic slurs in the book or
joking that she thought African infants with bloated
stomachs were pregnant not starving — she also
sensed the need to stop herself mid-joke.
"What did Mercedes do?" she asked of the auto
mobile company s aiding the Nazis during World
War 11. "They helped facilitate a genocide of people
who would ultimately become their best customers.
As any Jew can tell you. that's bad business sense."
That's punchy, but it's PG-rated compared to her
1 lolocaust routine's previous ending: "If black peo
ple were in Germany during World War 11. the I lolo
caust would have never happened. (Pause). Or not
to Jews."
"TTiat movie ]300"?" she said. "Turns out how
they got that title was they measured how gay it was.
(Pause.) On a scale of one to 10."
Critics argue that Silverman can so easily
stretch the rubber band of cultural sensitivity with
out it snapping in her face because of her celebrity
and good looks; her supporters cite her intelligence
and pure intentions. But for Silverman, who was
surprisingly candid in a 20-minute question-and
answer following the show, it's a simple equation.
"I don't find many things offensive if it's funny
enough," she said. "If it's funny enough, it's Ok."

She's onto something here. Perhaps the audi
ence craves a safe place to relax their guard and
laugh whenever cultural hypersensitivity de
grades into absurdity. Because many people con
sider her sufficiently funny, Silverman provides
that cover. And besides, she's liberal and pretty
cute.
"I thought it was funny," third-year applied
physics graduate student Fen Zhao said. "I think she
uses comedy as a satire for other issues."
Whatever her magic in a bottle is. Silverman isn't
letting it out.
"I don't want to dissect it," she said. "That's for
you to do, There's an elephant in the room."
Ultimately, Silverman sensed the audience was
so comfortable that she unleashed her sharp tongue
on students in the front row. Scott Schonfeld "08
started his question with,"As a Jewish male myself,"
only for Silverman to induce uproarious laughter
with " Vou didn't need to say that."
She twice complimented a sophomore's breasts
and the student was flattered.
"Honestly, because she was one of Maxim's top
-100 hottest women. I guess I was a little honored,"
said Siri. who asked The Daily not to print her last
name. "It she were ugly. 1 would be like,'Oh, she's
just jealous.' Or if she were a man I'd feel objectified,
but because she's neither of those I think she gets
away with those jokes."
Silverman mostly tested new material in prepa
ration for the MTV Movie Awards, which she will
host on June 3. but filled out her routine with lines

from her movie "Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is
Magic" and her Comedy Central series "The
Sarah Silverman Program." She played three
songs on the guitar, including "Jesus is Magic,"
"You're Going to Die Soon" and"I Love You
More."
Comedian Steve Agee delivered surpris
ingly strong material in his 10-minute opening
act.
"Today in Haiti the weather was 85 de
grees with a 96 percent chance of AIDS." he
cracked.
But between Agee's bright moments
were too many stumbles and awkward paus
es. He was so tongue-twisted at one point,
he had no choice but to admit it: "Holy shit,
I'm rambling."
The ASSU Speakers Bureau arranged
Silverman's visit in conjunction with the
Jewish Students Association. Stanford Stu
dents in Entertainment, the Stanford Comedy
Club and FLiCKS. Silverman briefly met with
leaders of these groups in a post-show recep
tion in the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The Stanford Chaparral managed to
crash the after-party, where they declared
Silverman an inspiration and awarded her a
golden hammer.
"She's a pretty good influence on most of
us." said publisher Doug Renter'o7. "She has
a really good understanding of the space of
humor."
