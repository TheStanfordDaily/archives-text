## An email interview with Sarah Silverman 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION COMEDIAN 
Storming through mass media
recently, Sarah Silverman has been
a solid stand-up comedian for years.
Famous for her role in The Aristo
crats, now Ms. Silverman stars in the
Sarah Silverman Program on Com
edy Central. She's made a name for
herself as one of the most incisive
and hilarious personalities in mod
ern comedy, and also one of the
most controversial. Ms. Silverman
doesn't just employ stereotypes
about race, sex, and reality in her
standup, she inverts them, carves

them up. and ultimately is so adept
in her verbal swordsmanship that
she will either leave her entire audi
ence laughing or completely of
fended; in all likelihood, probably
both.
Ms. Silverman performed some
of her latest standup material yes
terday at Memorial Auditorium. As
a prelude to her appearance on
campus, she agreed to be inter
viewed via e-mail. She reflects on
her 2005 concert film Jesus is Magic,
her working relationship with
Jimmy Kimmel, and her own
philosophies on writing.

Intermission: Who do you consider
your major influences?
Sarah Silverman: My parents, Steve
Martin. Garry Shandling, Fred
Rogers. Jimmy Kimmel. Ruth Gor
don.
I: Do you and Jimmy have a rivalry
going over whose jokes are funnier,
or do you two trade jokes?
SS: We bounce stuff off each other.
I le's so. so prolific — he does a dif
ferent hour-long show every night.
It's nuts!

I: What gave you the idea for
"Jesus is Magic?"
SS: I was doing it as a stage show
and thought it would be cool as a
traditional concert movie — and
could potentially he even more
cinematic than just a camera
shooting a stage.
I: You often talk about difficult
topics like race, depression, and
sex. What attracts you to these
topics?

SS: Their boobs.
I: How has the transition been to a
somewhat sketch format in "The
Sarah Silverman Program"?
SS: It's actually a narrative [style].
We're writing episodes now — it's
totally different from stand-up. It's
an opportunity to be more subtle
(and absurd...) The days are gruel
ing but super fun — there are al
ways big belly laughs each working
day.
I: What's the difference between
writing stand-up and writing your
own show?
SS: On the show it's much more col
laborative. We all sit around and fig
ure out the stories and it's a lot more
fun. Though with stand-up. you can
find out immediately if something
works...
I: Do you have any writing routines?
SS: I never really did. I mean, if I
have a deadline, I always tend to
pull through, but otherwise I mostly
write jokes as they come to me. But

now, with the show, we have a rou
tine — we write everyday from
10:30 until about 7:30.
I: You said you would not marry
until gays are allowed to. which is a
very bold political statement in our
times. What do you think of comedi
ans' role in advocacy? For example,
is there a responsibility for comedi
ans, as social critics, to advocate
change?
SS: 1 think holding comedians re
sponsible for anything is a bad idea.
The onus is really on the people at
large. Americans are treated like in
fants in terms of what is allowed on
public airwaves. 1 think 1 just said
three totally different things. I'll be
honest, I'm distracted by television
right now...
I: You've been very open about your
history of depression and your use
of Zoloft, so what do you make of
scientologists' condemnation of
psychiatry?
SS: I don't think twice about it. Like
any religion, they believe what they

believe and that's fine by me, but
I'm not into that shit. 1 think all reli
gion is kind of retarded. I don't need
the threat of going to hell to be a
nice person or to treat people kind
ly or to have empathy.
I: Any shot "Greg the Bunny" will
come back from the dead?
SS: 1 think they're doing it on IFC,
where it was originally. Much better
there. The original IFC show was
BRILLIANT.
I: Any advice for teenagers and col
lege kids who are thinking about
becoming comedians?
SS: Sure.There's no one way to do it.
The only important thing is get on
stage as much as possible, anywhere
you can and write constantly. Keep
paper and pen on you all the time,
you never know when or where
you'll think of something.
1: Does Jimmy [Kimmel, former co
host of "Win Ben Stein's Money"]
prefer you or Ben Stein in the sack?
SS: It's a tie.
