## Magnetic properties of carbon identified 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center (SLAC) have defied years of scientif
ic consensus by successfully proving that carbon
contains its own magnetic properties, according
to a study in the May 4 issue of "Physical Review
Letters." While many experts in the field had at
tempted to confirm the element's magnetic prop
erties in the past, they had been unable to do so
until now.
Hendrik Ohldag.lead author of the study and a
staff scientist at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory (SSRL), worked in conjunction
with specialists from SLAC, Germany's Universi
ty of Leipzig and the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory to perform the experiment. Ohldag

said that the findings should alter the scientific and
technological perceptions of carbon.
"It will forever change the perception of the el
ement," Ohldag said. "[Before], if you looked at
carbon, you would never think about its magnetic
properties. Now you will have to remember the
magnetic properties any time you use it."
Carbon is one of the most abundant materials
on Earth and is the foundation of biological life.
But until now magnetism, a property generally
linked with only a few types of metals — includ
ing nickel, iron and cobalt — was excluded from
carbon's list of physical properties. Prior at
tempts by researchers to link magnetism to car
bon were widely disregarded and attributed to
the presence of other magnetic substances in the
sample.
"We have proven for the first time that a carbon

sample can be magnetic without having dirt or
anything in it," Ohldag said.
Now that carbon's magnetic properties have
been established, Ohldag said, the implications for
industries and technologies which utilize carbon
based materials are enormous. For designers of
computer microchips and nanotechnologies —
many of which use magnetization as a method of
embedding codes and information — the new dis
covery has the potential to open new doors to
technological improvements.
"One can now look more closely into nanode
vices," Ohldag said, "and see how they can make
more sophisticated nanodevices that are magnet
ized."
