## Educated mothers work more Wealth not a factor in decision to stay at home 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
What determines a mother's de
cision to work after having children?
According to a recent Council on
Contemporary Families study, her
post-childhirth career choices are
not directly related to her husband's
socioeconomic level. The Council
found that educated women are ac
tually more likely than their less-ed
ucated counterparts to work while
raising children, even though such
women are generally wealthier.
"[A woman's] own education af
fects whether [she is] employed
much more than [her] husband's in
come level." said Sociology Prof.
Paula England, one of the authors of
the study. "Women with more educa
tion have access to more interesting,
more meaningful and higher-paying
jobs. [ITie more your] education
level increases, the more you have to
give up by not being employed."
The study's data showed that
well-educated women are likely to
be employed even though they tend
to marry equally educated men with
high-paying jobs. The percentage of
married mothers who work does not
decrease as their husbands' wages
increase.
"The education level of women
totally trumps the income level of
their husbands," England explained,
noting that educated women tend to
marry educated men, leaving them
in financial situations where they
can choose not to work.
According to the study, mothers
with husbands in the bottom 25 per
cent of male earnings are the most
likely to stay at home and raise their
children, and less then half of
women in this socioeconomic sector
worked in 2006.
While mothers with low-earning
husbands are often the most in need
of the financial support of a second
salary, the high cost of childcare
forces them stay at home and forego
a second family income.
"Low educated women are liter
ally in a situation where they can't
afford to work," England said.
England and her co-authors
found that there has not been a sig
nificant decrease in working
women. According to the data that
England collected, the percentage of
working mothers has leveled out
since 1990.
For those women who choose not
to work temporarily after having
children, reentering the workforce is
not easy. England said that compa
nies could use government help to
make jobs more compatible with the
busy schedule of all working parents,
regardless of income level.
"Virtually every other industrial
ized country provides childcare sub
sidized by taxes, like public educa
tion," England said. "That means all
women who want to work can afford
to."
The study also noted that the role
of men in child rearing has increased
slightly in recent years. However,
this increase does not offset the in
crease in working mothers.
"We need a cultural change."
England said. "We had a cultural
change [and now] people accept that
women have the same rights to a ca
reer as men, but I don't think we've
had a cultural change where we rec
ognize that men need to be co-pri
mary childcare givers. I'd advocate
for a culture where men are expect
ed to take over half of the tradition
ally female jobs, like childcare."
