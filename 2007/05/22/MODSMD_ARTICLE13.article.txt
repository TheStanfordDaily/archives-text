## Calif. reviews voting systems 
### TAMARA BARTLETT DAILY CALIFORNIA (U-WIRE) 
BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Two professors, one each
from the University of California-Berkeley and
Davis campuses,were chosen earlier this month to
lead an independent review of voting machines
used in California elections.
ITie review, which has been called the "top to
bottom review," will review every part of the vot
ing system from the hardware to software and
every piece used,said Nicole Winger, a spokesper
son for California Secretary of State Debra
Bowen.
David Wagner, an assistant professor of electri
cal engineering and computer science at UC
Berkeley, and Matthew Bishop, a computer sci
ence professor at UC Davis, were named the prin
ciple investigators for the review.
Both Wagner and Bishop said they do not want
to speak about the project at this time.
Winger said the review is expected to start to
wards the end of the week of May 14 and is sched
uled to end in July.
The review will first begin with a document re
view of the machines.which will examine the man
ufacturer's documentation that is given when ap
proving a particular vendor. Winger said.

Following the document review, the investiga
tors will perform a source code review to identify
any security vulnerabilities in the voting machine
system.
The final stage will then be the "red-team test
ing." which Winger described as an "open-ended,
hands-on effort to find any errors in software."
Winger said the comprehensive review process
is designed to trace any flaws in the voting systems
that could potentially cause errors in the elections.
"The teams (conducting the review) are look
ing for vulnerabilities that could affect the accura
cy or reliability of elections in California," Winger
said.
Fight voting systems have been slated to un
dergo the review including models from Diebold
and Sequoia systems.
Winger said the independent, comprehensive
review is very unique.as it has not been performed
in California before and she said she was not fa
miliar with any other states' secretary of state's of
fices that had conducted a similar review.
In choosing the review's leaders. Winger said
Bishop and Wagner were selected due to their
level of experience in the computer sciences field.
" ITiey're highly respected experts with sound
reputations," she said.
