## Editorial Board Hitting the SPOT 
### 
A Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip
(SPOT) is one ol the best ways for stu
dents to get to know each other before
starting here as cither freshmen or trans
fers. I lie program, launched in 2003. runs
five-day trips with a wilderness or com
munity service focus in the week before
New Student Orientation. Many stu
dents fondly recall their SPOT experi
ence and often arrive on campus with the
beginnings of a social network — a
major benefit during the awkward days
ol NSO It is a shame that only transfer
students and incoming freshmen from
the eastern half of the United States are
able to enjoy the fun and bonding oppor
tunities offered by these outings.
lliese limits were understandable in
the program's infancy. SPOT planners
had to gauge interest and handle the ini
tial administrative difficulties of creat
ing a new pre-Stanford experience.
Rather than deal with 1.600 potential ap
plicants. program directors found it rea
sonable to limit the program to a more
manageable participant pool. By this
point, however. SPOT is well on its way
to becoming, an institution — one which

future Stanford students from all geo
graphic locations should have the oppor
tunity to enjoy.
Hie other justification offered for
SPO'l 's I.ast Coast bias is the claim that
these students have a harder time transi
tioning to college in California. This is a
debatable argument, as students from all
backgrounds have transitional problems
that accompany the departure to college.
Traveling to a new city and leaving be
hind family and friends is just as trau
matic an experience for freshmen from
Seattle or Reno as it is for those from
New York.
Hie pre-orientation program offers
its participants the opportunity to hike
in the California baekcountry or im
merse themselves in the local communi
ty beyond the University itself. Fit her
way. SPOT provides a rare chance to get
outside of the Stanford bubble that
would benefit all students, regardless of
their home state. As the program enters
its fifth year this fall, administrators
should consider expanding its infrastruc
ture and staff to support applications
without geographical limitations.
