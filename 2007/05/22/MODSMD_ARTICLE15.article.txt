<■ l *\ \ Tho is Ayn Rand?"
Although 1 didn't know
V T her personally, I'm inclined
tosa\ that Ami Rand was a big know-it-all
who wasn't the least bit ashamed that she
knew ii all. And indeed I wouldn't expect
anything less from a woman who had a 6-
I'oot l'lower arrangement in the shape of a
dollar sign by her graveside.
A particularly choice display of her
know-it-all-ism recently came to my atten
tion. She once wrote:
"I'.cology as a social principle ... con
demns cities, culture, industry, technology,
the intellect, and advocates men's return to
'nature.' to the state of grunting subani
mals digging the soil with their bare
hands."
As a devout fan of the environment. I'm
inclined lo dismiss her immediately. I don't
mean to go all ad hominem. but this is the
same woman who spat upon charity and
feminism and probably kicked kittens with
steel-toed boots in her spare time. But I
can't help but feel that this Ayn Rand char
acter might deserve a little consideration,
simply because (and I hate myself for say
ing this) that eco-hating quote of hers con
tains a little bit of a point. That seedling of
a point is the all-too-true observation that
people no longer feel natural in nature, or
at least I never have.
It's embarrassing and strange to say that
I don't feel at home in the natural world,
because didn't we start off our evolution
ary journeys swinging through trees? And
yet we've lost touch,or at least I have, with
all the primal calls that might once have
made us feel at home among the monkeys
in the forest. I've always felt guilty about
this, but I've also always suspected that
most of my fellow humans feel the same
way.
Iliis sneaking suspicion that I wasn't the
only one to feel uncomfortable in her own
caterpillar-filled backyard began at a
young age when I realized that those love
ly Cioodall-ish older ladies who led my
kindergarten class on walks through the
Audubon were freaks of nature, precisely
hccati.sc they nature so much. These
women (you must know the sort) — with
their canvas hats, woman-mustaches and
old-timey pleated khakis — never
seemed to mind getting their socks soaked
in frog spawn-laden puddles of mud or let
ting centipedes crawl all over themselves
for the benefit of kindergarten education.
Ilicse inscrutable ladies seemed to me to
be the embodiment of virtue, modern-day
s,nuts il you will, because they could stand
to exist in the swamp that is nature. Never
theless. my classmates and I were always
glad to escape their clutches, change into
warm clothes, and eat C'heetos next to a
heating vent.
I think feeling of unease in one's sur
roundings is what our beloved Ms. Rand
was getting at. Her whole ecology-phobia
is based on the firm conviction that life
with technology is infinitely preferable to
life without technology, which would pre
sumably involve such uncivilized activities
as orgies, berry eatingand 110 novel writing.
I think it's not unreasonable to assume that
dear Avnnie didn't feci at home in nature.

and we have that in common, tragically.
I've tried very, very hard to like hiking, but
it just gives me the same feeling I get when
I dry-swallow a pill.
Iliis visceral discomfort that some of us
feel with our 'natural' surroundings is one
that comes of a technological upbringing,
in which breast-milk substitute can be pur
chased in cans and nose hair can be clipped
with a clever machine. Survival, for us. en
tails very different things than once it did.
In modern life (let's take I'til/i Fiction as
our model for modern life), understanding
the crucial differences between coke and
heroin is much more pertinent than. say.
knowing the best strategies for engaging in
hand-to-hand combat with a cougar. No
wonder we feel uncomfortable in the
wilderness.
It's clear that we don't have to choose
between unbridled technological progress
and naked foraging, but it's nonetheless
worthwhile to look a little closer at Ayn's
eco-phobia in order to understand more
about the politics of environmentalism. Al
though she was certainlv an embodiment
of a fierce kind ol libertarianism. darling
Ayn was also arguably a shade neocon
esque before being .1 neocon was even
fashionable. Her whole anti-government
charity bent sounds like pure neocon ideol
ogy. and I can imagine that dollar sign
shaped floral arrangement popping up at
( heney's funeral. And this is what leads me
to wonder whether Rand's brand ofgreen
hatingcould shed some light on the current
administration's antipathy for the environ
mentalist movement.
Ayn's beliefs about agency were firm.
(iod helps those who help themselves. But
(iod is dead, so I guess the laws of the uni
verse help those who help themselves. So 1
suspect that Rand would tell the polar
bears to start getting their own asses off
those melting ice caps, proclaiming as they
go."1 swear by the ice caps and my love (if
them that I will never live for the sake of
another bear, nor ask another bear to live
for mine." I think Cheney would like the
polar bears to do the same thing. And I

haters would like to paint things the way
Rand did: It's us against nature. I • it her we
have progress, or we have an o/.one layer.
I it her we have fun. or we have animals.
And I hope if you're a green-hater (and
some of you are), you can recognize the

Rand that I see running through the cur

little sickening.

can't help but feel that this Ayn Rand char
acter might deserve a little consideration,
simply because (and I hate myself for say
ing this) that eco-hating quote of hers con
tains a little bit of a point. That seedling of
a point is the all-too-true observation that
people no longer feel natural in nature, or
at least I never have.
It's embarrassing and strange to say that
I don't feel at home in the natural world,
because didn't we start off our evolution
ary journeys swinging through trees? And
yet we've lost touch,or at least I have, with
all the primal calls that might once have
made us feel at home among the monkeys
in the forest. I've always felt guilty about
this, but I've also always suspected that
most of my fellow humans feel the same
way.
Iliis sneaking suspicion that I wasn't the
only one to feel uncomfortable in her own
caterpillar-filled backyard began at a
young age when I realized that those love
ly Cioodall-ish older ladies who led my
kindergarten class on walks through the
Audubon were freaks of nature, precisely
hccati.sc they nature so much. These
women (you must know the sort) — with
their canvas hats, woman-mustaches and
old-timey pleated khakis — never
seemed to mind getting their socks soaked
in frog spawn-laden puddles of mud or let
ting centipedes crawl all over themselves
for the benefit of kindergarten education.
Ilicse inscrutable ladies seemed to me to
be the embodiment of virtue, modern-day
s,nuts il you will, because they could stand
to exist in the swamp that is nature. Never
theless. my classmates and I were always
glad to escape their clutches, change into
warm clothes, and eat C'heetos next to a
heating vent.
I think feeling of unease in one's sur
roundings is what our beloved Ms. Rand
was getting at. Her whole ecology-phobia
is based on the firm conviction that life
with technology is infinitely preferable to
life without technology, which would pre
sumably involve such uncivilized activities
as orgies, berry eatingand 110 novel writing.
I think it's not unreasonable to assume that
dear Avnnie didn't feci at home in nature.

and we have that in common, tragically.
I've tried very, very hard to like hiking, but
it just gives me the same feeling I get when
I dry-swallow a pill.
Iliis visceral discomfort that some of us
feel with our 'natural' surroundings is one
that comes of a technological upbringing,
in which breast-milk substitute can be pur
chased in cans and nose hair can be clipped
with a clever machine. Survival, for us. en
tails very different things than once it did.
In modern life (let's take I'til/i Fiction as
our model for modern life), understanding
the crucial differences between coke and
heroin is much more pertinent than. say.
knowing the best strategies for engaging in
hand-to-hand combat with a cougar. No
wonder we feel uncomfortable in the
wilderness.
It's clear that we don't have to choose
between unbridled technological progress
and naked foraging, but it's nonetheless
worthwhile to look a little closer at Ayn's
eco-phobia in order to understand more
about the politics of environmentalism. Al
though she was certainlv an embodiment
of a fierce kind ol libertarianism. darling
Ayn was also arguably a shade neocon
esque before being .1 neocon was even
fashionable. Her whole anti-government
charity bent sounds like pure neocon ideol
ogy. and I can imagine that dollar sign
shaped floral arrangement popping up at
( heney's funeral. And this is what leads me
to wonder whether Rand's brand ofgreen
hatingcould shed some light on the current
administration's antipathy for the environ
mentalist movement.
Ayn's beliefs about agency were firm.
(iod helps those who help themselves. But
(iod is dead, so I guess the laws of the uni
verse help those who help themselves. So 1
suspect that Rand would tell the polar
bears to start getting their own asses off
those melting ice caps, proclaiming as they
go."1 swear by the ice caps and my love (if
them that I will never live for the sake of
another bear, nor ask another bear to live
for mine." I think Cheney would like the
polar bears to do the same thing. And I
think the worst of the modern-day eco
haters would like to paint things the way
Rand did: It's us against nature. I • it her we
have progress, or we have an o/.one layer.
I it her we have fun. or we have animals.
And I hope if you're a green-hater (and
some of you are), you can recognize the
same vein of insanity running through
Rand that I see running through the cur
rent political atmosphere. It's more than a
little sickening.

If yon like Ayn Hand, well ... ros/i. l.mad
