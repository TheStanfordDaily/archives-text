# The
						dead

Suicide is so much less embarrassing
than homicide. Can you imagine the
shitslorm maelstrom that would engulf
our pretty campus if someone shot five peo
ple? Shot them so their blood splattered
across the tables of Stern dining hall. Or
their blood covered the pull-out desks in the
chem building. Or their blood filled the
fountains until the water sprayed dnrk bitter
red. Five Stanford students dead.
Hell, it doesn't have to be five. Make it
three. Make it one.'Hunk of the black cloud
that would descend on our lives. Our own
little Virginia lech. The blood, damn it.the
fucking blood! Pouring out of open wounds.
Choked out of lungs that will never breathe
again. On our campus. On our hands. Mow
ing out of pale bodies until the heart |iist
stops pumping, tired, empty.
Fortunately, people don't kill other peo
ple at Stanford. Iliey just kill themselves. No
one ever talks about the suicides, but every
one talks about how no one ever talks about
the suicides. "Can you believe," we shake
our heads, "four suicides at Stanford in one
year, and nobody notices, nobody cares."
Someone says."l heard there were five."
"That's what I'm talking about."
Stanford is killing people. We shouldn't
hold that against Stanford. Ihere is so much
joy here. Ihere are thousands of students
who live happy lives of quiet desperation,
for whom suicide is never more than a pass
ing fancy, the dream of an eternal vacation
from one's own brain.
But for a school that prides itself on its
happicst-place-on-earth reputation, one
suicide is a misfortune. Five is just awkward.
To a high school senior, Stanford is the anti-
Cornell: happy people living happy lives
under the happy, happy sun. And now there
is a suicide epidemic. Intelligent young peo
ple — who have worked hard their whole
lives to get here, who have so much to look
forward to — are eliminating themselves
from the humanity continuum. Asphyxia
tion. It's not a good way to go.
Ihcse people would have been great.
Leaders of the world. And now they are
memories tinged in eternal sadness, lake
them off of Face book. Cross them off your
Christmas list. Destiny has clipped whatev
er wings they might have grown.
Some people have expressed distaste for
the I Iniversity's handling of the suicides. A
couple weeks ago. Hennessy wrote a letter
to the editor. (In case you missed it. Board
man emailed you a link a lew days later.)

11 alt of the letter was about Virginia Tech.
That event was a tragedy beyond all reckon
ing. But it has nothing to do with Stanford.
Campus security is not the issue we should
be debating. I saw eight police cars in twen
ty minutes last Saturday, and witnessed one
brave officer fearlessly charging a danger
ous minor for drinking quietly in public. A
libertarian might argue that the overregula
tion on this campus is the problem. 1 will just
point out that no one is killing us except our
selves.
Iliey're trying they're best, though, like
bumbling parents desperately devoted to
children they will never understand. Iliey
designed a cute Campus Climate Question
naire with a stress tree and a stress quilt.
Iliey had a mental health fun day in White
Plaza, with free massages. Fverywhere you
look there's a pamphlet for the Bridge. It's
all utterly useless, but they're trying. It's the
thought that counts, even if they appear to
think we're in second grade.
Our school's not to blame. It's us. It's who
we are. It's the curse of our overworked gen
eration. If you're here, then odds are you've
spent the better half of your life attaining
perfection. Fxtracurriculars, AP tests, tro
phies,student government.student newspa
pers. singing, dancing, studying, sleeping
only when your body could hold out no
longer against the dark unconsciousness. I
always assumed that sort of life was over
with high school; that once you got to col
lege things slowed down. For most people,
college is even more intense than high
school: more work, more coffee. Our par
ents used science to make us the perfect
worker bee study bots — but you can't just
turn that off. If anything, you become even
more type-A with age. We want it all. We
binge on work, we binge on play, we binge.
But it's never enough. We get to Stan
ford, which is supposed to be the fulfillment
of all our dreams, and it isn't enough. We
need a good med school, a good law school,
a great job, the love and respect of our peers

and our betters. My shrink described to me
how kids like us — perfectionists, go-get
ters. workaholics—live our lives walking
up an eternal slope without ever turning
back. We never see how high we've come, we
only see how much higher we still have to
go. And we gel depressed because there is
no plateau: the mountain just gets steeper.
It doesn't help that the whole world is
going to shit. Or rather, that we are more
aware than any previous generation of how
shitty the world has always been. It calls to
mind something A.I said a couple of weeks
ago on "Tlie Sopranos." I low can you not be
depressed? Mow can any sane person ap
proach the world with anything less than
horror and distaste and loathing? When A.I
attempted suicide on the most recent
episode, I found myself begging the Lord to
spare him — as if he carried the fate of us all
on his shoulders, as if whatever happened to
him was going to happen to us eventually.
111 e pessimism is everywhere. The '90s
arc seven years gone. Any dream of para
disc on earth is gone with them.'Hie planes
flew into the towers. And that didn't even
matter. ('an you imagine? 9/11 doesn't even
matter. It's a blip in the radar. People were
suffering before; people are still suffering.
Our world is broken, dying. We killed it.
Global warming is God's next flood. Wipe
the slate clean. Maybe the cockroaches will
do better.
()r so we think.sometimes, when the sun
shine feels cold, when death feels so close.
You know what? There's a way out. And you
don't need CAPS or the Bridge or the Of
fice of Religious Life. You have to fail, and
you have to want to fail. Skip a class, or miss
a meeting. Whatever you think you have to
do. do the exact opposite. Try to become
everything you're afraid of becoming: fat.
stupid, alone. Admit weakness, bind some
one who makes you happy and tell them
everything that makes you hurt. I specially
the stupid shit. Because suicide,in the end. is
stupid. I .iving is the appropriate response to
life. We owe it to our honored dead to learn
from their mistakes. We owe it to them to
live every day like it's the start of forever.
And we owe it to them to try to change our
life il our life isn't working for us.
