## GOLF TEAMS READY FOR NCAAS Course sets up well for women 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
T"his is what the No. 14 Stanford
women's golf team has prepared for
all season with every swing, putt and
drop of sweat on and off the course.
Today, the Cardinal women make
their 19th consecutive appearance
at the 2(X)7 NCAA Women's Golf
Championships in Daytona Beach,
Fla.
Held at the par-72, 6,351-yard
Legends Course at the LPGA Inter
national, the championships will fea
ture 24 of the nation's top squads
and six individual golfers, all of them
vying for the top prize in collegiate
play. The field includes nine teams
ranked in the top 10 and 20 teams
ranked in the top-25 in the most re
cent Golf World/NGCA Coaches
Poll.
Five Pacific-10 Conference
squads qualified for the tourney in
cluding the Pac-10 Champs, top
ranked Arizona State, No. 8 South
ern California, No. 9 UCLA and No.
16 Arizona.
Twelve years ago, Arizona State
captured back-to-back-to-back
championships. This year, the Sun
Devils have the difficult task of
denying No. 2 Duke its third consec
utive N( 'AA title.
TTiough faced with a tough field
of competitors, this is exactly what
Stanford wants, according to head
coach Caroline O'Connor.
"We've been preparing for this
all year long," O'Connor said. "One
of our goals at the beginning of the
year is to be one of the top teams in
the country and it's difficult to quan
tify that."
"As hard as we've worked in the
gym for the last nine months, physi
cally we're in really good shape,"she
added. "By being in good physical
shape, that'll greatly help our mental
standpoint."
Fortunately, the Card also has a
lot of momentum on its side.coming
off a resounding victory at the
NCAA West Regional. The
women's strong play in the final
round of the tourney clinched a
share of the team title and secured a
spot in this year's championships.
Their victory came at the Snow
Canyon Country Club in St. George,
Utah, a golf course that meshed well
with Stanford's style of play. ITie
Legends Course will be no different,
according to O'Connor.
"Everyone feels really good com
ing off a big win at regionals, and
we're coming into a golf course that
sets up again well for our golf team."
she said. "You have to really execute
on this course, and one of our
strengths is ball control. Our short
game last week was spectacular, and
if we make a few adjustments out
here, we're ready to go."
Another key to the Stanford vic
tory was a strong mental approach
that had seemed to disappear during
the spring season. Besides going
head-to-head against the golf
course, the Cardinal played inspired
golf in the final round enabling it to
catch up to Oklahoma State.

NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
Â®
b 22 2b Daytona Beach, Fla.
NOTES: Stanford makes its 19th straight
appearance at the NCAAs this year as
one of 24 teams to hit the course.
Among Stanford's competitors are Ari
zona, Arizona State, USC and UCLA.
The Cardinal is paired up with the Tro
jans and Duke in the first and second
rounds today and Wednesday. The
women will play 72 holes of stroke-play
golf over four days, starting at 8 a.m.
today.

"In a team competition like this,
we try to beat the course every day
and at every competition." O'Con
nor said. "We have to take it one day
and one shot at a time. If we try to
beat par on this goll course, we'll be
in good position."
Stanford is not without its own
arsenal of players. In fact, the depth
of its lineup has carried the team for
most of the season, giving hope for
the squad's first top-10 finish since
2001 and possibly an even higher
showing.
"We have the depth that we
haven't had in some time, and that's
one of our greater strengths." O'-
Connor said. "We've showed that off
in recent weeks. Our entire lineup

has the ability to shoot even-par or
better."
The Cardinal lineup is led by sen
ior captains Lauren Todd and Jen
nifer Tangtiphaiboontana in their
final collegiate tourney. Following
them is sophomore phenom Mari
Chun, who leads the team with a
73.3 stroke average. Rounding off
the five are freshmen Catherina
Wang and Angela King, who are
both gaining valuable postseason
experience for the future of the pro
gram.
"Mari's playing extremely well
right now." O'Connor said. "Lauren
and Jennie have continued their
outstanding play as well, and the
freshmen have had a few postsea
son tournaments under their belts
now with confidence at this level."
Last year, the squad tied for 13th
at the NCAA Championships, led
by then-junior Tangtiphaiboontana
who tied for 16th individually. The
Cardinal's best-ever finish at the
championships was as runner-up in
2000.
On the season. Stanford has fin
ished in the top 10 in all 10 of its
tournaments, including five top-five
finishes. The Cardinal also boasts
three tournament victories at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational. Peg
Barnard Collegiate and NCAA
West Regional.
Given the squad's track record
this season and the countless hours
poured into the game,any finish out
side of the top 10 could be seen as a
sub-par end to the season for the
Cardinal.
Stanford tees off today's first
round at 12:30 p.m. with USC and
Duke.
