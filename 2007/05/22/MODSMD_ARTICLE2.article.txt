# KATRINA ART
## Project raises Katrina awareness 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Almost two years after Hurricane Katrina
devastated the Gulf Coast, many people be
lieve that "everything's fine."
But according to New Orleans native
Sarah Woodward '09, ' Hie Big Easy" is still
far from the spirited city it once was. In an ef
fort to raise reduced awareness about the
issue, Woodward memorialized the city's loss
es and its continued struggles through an in
teractive art installation she constructed near
Green Library on Saturday.
As a freshman who entered Stanford only
weeks after the storm hit. Woodward strug
gled to cope with the devastation back home.

After returning to Louisiana the following
summer and assisting with rebuilding efforts,
she felt a personal responsibility to bring the
New Orleans story to California. She applied
in the fall for grant money from the Chappell-
Lougee Scholarship program and embarked
on what would become a yearlong project.
"1 wanted to give an impression." she said,
"of the uncertainty and anxiety that goes with
still living in the area."
The display near Green consists of multi
ple panels,each depicting a piece of the devas
tation. Woodward called upon her memories
— the miles of flattened houses, her friends
who lost their homes and belongings, the
smell of rotting food in the streets — to in
spire her work.

"I've tried to show what it's like," she said,
"for me and my family and my friends — our
experience, not a national broadcast of what's
going on."
Woodward noted that her artwork is only a
representation of the tragedy.
"There's no way to describe it without
being there," she said, "and there's no way to
show pictures of how had it was."
As the hurricane's two-year anniversary
approaches. Woodward hopes that in addition
to shedding light on New Orleans' broken
state, her artwork will spur campus dialogue
about the federal government's lackluster re
lief efforts.

"I think that it will get a lot of people
thinking," said Haley Minniek *09, Wood
ward's roommate. "I think that's what
Sarah's goal is — to just get as many people
as possible to think about Katrina and [to
bring] it out of obseurity."
Woodward's projeet was selected as one
of only a lew dozen to receive Chappell-
Lougee grant money. Ihe program, which is
meant to fund undergraduate research in the
humanities,social sciences and arts, is offered
only to sophomores.
"[Sarahs] proposal was intellectually sat

isfying and demonstrated her understanding
of the nature of memoriali/ation and how
her work intersects with other memorials
and installations." said Rcnee Courey,senior
associate director of Undergraduate Advis
ing and Research, in an email to Ihe Daily.
" The connection between her vision and
the practical elements of its realization was
very strong." she wrote. "We are delighted
with the interactive aspects of her project
and how it allows the Stanford community to
honor the people of New Orleans."
"She's totally created a community con

versntion about something that's been tor
gotten." said ( ourtnc\ khademi "10. who at
tended the Alternative Spring llreak trip to
New ()rleans in March.
Woodward hopes the installation will re
main on display throughout the summer.
"I don't want this project to be the end."
she said." I want it to open discussion.'lliere's
a lot to talk about and a lot to figure out for
the future."
