# No. 2 men finish seventh
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
With many of the nation's top
teams sharing the course at
Tempe, Ariz., the No. 2 Stanford
men's golf team found itself
crowded out of the top spots at
the NCAA West Regional tour
nament this past weekend.
The top-seeded Cardinal fin
ished the last day with a score of
831 (33 under par) for a seventh
place finish in the tournament â€”
just enough to guarantee the
team's advancement to the four
day NCAA Men's Golf Champi
onships next week.
"It was pretty stressful being
the number one seed in the tour
nament. especially on a course
where we knew that we had to go
low to qualify for nationals,"
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The guys really stepped it
up where they needed to, espe
cially in the final round."
Unexpectedly, No. 36 South
Carolina fired an 820 (44 under
par) to seize top honors and
upset the tournament's many
top-ranked teams.

The Southern California
schools were also a force to be
reckoned with as UCLA fought
for first-place glory but came up
two strokes short, finishing sec
ond with 822 (42 under par),
while USC clocked in two strokes
behind its cross-town rival to
take third with 824 (40 under
par). Rounding out the top six
were Arizona State (824), Van
derbilt (826) and Arizona (828).
Following up the Cardinal was
the wild-card, unranked New
Mexico (833) squad, while Wake
Forest (839) and East Tennessee
State (839) tied for ninth. All
nine teams will be competing
with the Cardinal next week for
the NCAA Championship.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal in his first NCAA appearance
was freshman Joseph Bramlett,
who jumped 13 places and came
through in the clutch for the Car
dinal.
The freshman finished in a tie
for tenth after turning up the heat
in the last two days of the tourna
ment. Bramlett pillaged the
course on the last day. taking
eight birdies in his final round.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will be one of 30
teams participating in the NCAA Men's Golf
Championships at the Golden Horseshoe
Golf Course. The field includes five Rac-10
teams and more than 150 players. The Car
dinal shot a 14-under-par 274 on Saturday
to advance into the Championships. The
team was led by freshman Joseph Bramlett,
who moved from 23rd into a tie for 10th in
dividually. This is only the second time in the
last 10 years that Stanford has made the
NCAA Championships.

He notched scores of 71, 67 and
66 to give a 12-under-par 204,
making up over a third of the
Cardinal's 33 under-par strokes.
"I think Joseph really came
through big for us," Ray said. "He
had an awesome performance.
He has been consistent in the last
few tournaments he has played,
especially coming off his low
score round in the U.S. Open
qualifier last weekend. He has
definitely been feeling good
about his game lately."
Sophomore Daniel Lim and
senior Zack Miller contributed
their fair share to the Cardinal
score, ending in a tie for 36th,
each with a seven-under-par 209.
Miller had his best round on
the first day of the tournament,
notching a low five-under-par 67.
He also had three eagles and nine
birdies over the three rounds.
In contrast to Miller, Lim's
best round came on the third day,
when he notched seven birdies to
emerge with a six-under-par 66.
Senior Matt Savage concluded
the tournament just three strokes
behind his teammates, posting a
four-under-par 212 in a tie for
53rd. Rounding out the Cardi
nal's decisive advancement to the
NCAA Finals was junior Rob
Grube who finished in a tie for
71st with a two-under-par 214.
Grube's performance came up
disappointing after a seventh
place individual finish at the Pa
cific-10 Conference Champi
onships.
All of the Stanford golfers
chipped in some great perform
ances last weekend but they will
need to make their forceful pres
ence known next week. May 30-
June 2, in order to overcome the
top teams in the nation. This will
be the Cardinal's second appear
ance in the NCAA Champi
onships in the past three years.
"It is great to be able to move
on to nationals," Ray said. "Each
of the guys has a fight in them that
we saw this weekend. Next week
we are going to have to play our
best kind of golf in order to take
on the top teams in the country."
