# CARD PLAYS FINAL HOME GAME
## Chance to gain momentum against UC-Davis tonight 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Without the possibility of a post
season run. Stanford baseball's 2007
season is guaranteed to end before
this time next week. But coming off
of four wins in the last five games, the
Cardinal still has four more shots to
build hope for next year.
Tonight. Stanford (24-28.6-15 Pa
cific 10 Conference) is scheduled to
play its final home game of the year
against UC-Davis (22-30).
Menlo Park, Calif.-native Ryan
Seawell will be honored before his
last game at Sunken Diamond with
the traditional "Senior Night" cere
mony.
As the team's only senior. Seawell
is hitting .294 with four homeruns
and 15 RBI in his final year on the
1 arm. Considered one of the Cardi
nal's faster position starters, the third
baseman has only been caught steal
ing once in six tries this year.
It could also be the last game at
Stanford for redshirt junior Adam
Sorgi. Sorgi arrived in 2004. but has a
year of NCAA eligibility remaining
after missing all of last season due to
a shoulder injury.
Arguably the Cardinal's best con
tact hitter, Sorgi has said he may start
his professional career if he gets
enough interest in the draft, but has
left open the option to return.
"1 can't control the draft — I can't
control where 1 go," Sorgi said earli
er thisseason.' lf a team likes me and
they pick me up, and I think it's valu
able enough to start my professional
career, I'm going to do that. And if
not. I know I have another year here

at the Farm to have some fun and
hopefully get back to the winning
ways."
UC-Davis is currently classified
as an independent school completing
its transition to Division I. The Ag
gies played their first predominately
Division-! schedule in 2005, and will
join the Big West conference in 2008.
In 2(JOh. UC-Davis took both games
in a home-and-away series against
the Cardinal,3-0 and 8-3.
Daniel Descalso, a junior from
San Carlos, Calif., leads the Aggies
with a .395 average and four home
runs. The team's bench rotation has
been very short all season with only
14 players recording at bats this sea
son. But despite the lack of depth at
the plate, the Aggies have hit a very
respectable .312 on the season.
Over the last two weeks. Stanford
has won two weekend series in a row
for the first time since beating
Kansas and California between Feb.
25 and March 4.
Stability in all phases of the game
has made the difference for Stan
ford. I"he offense has averaged 10.5
runs this past week, while a Cardinal
pitcher has thrown at least seven in
nings in three of the last four games.
Stanford will close its season this
weekend with a conference series
against Southern California (26-25,
8-12 Pac-10). The Cardinal dropped
2-of-3 to the Trojans in a non-confer
ence series at Sunken Diamond in
March. With wins in each of its last
four games, the Cardinal can finish at
.500 to avoid its first losing season
since 1993.
First pitch against the Aggies is
scheduled for 6 p.m. tonight at

Sunken Diamond.

GAME NOTES: Before Stanford finishes its reg
ular season against Southern California this
weekend, the Cardinal faces the Aggies
tonight at home. Davis went 2-2 this past
week and defeated Stanford twice last sea
son, 3-0 and 8-3. Aside from wanting to
get back at the Aggies, the Cardinal wants
to get back on the winning track. Stanford
will finish under .500 for the season — the
first time since 1993 — unless it manages
wins in all four remaining games.


MASURA OKA/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore righthander Max Fearnow's ERA in 1 8 games (7.71) represents the struggles that the Cardinal have en
countered this season. The team likely has just four games left to try and end the season on a high note.
