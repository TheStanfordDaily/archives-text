# SPECIAL EVENTS
## Panelists think about future of print edition Newspapers face uphill battle, speakers agree 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
As the print version of the news
paper becomes obsolete and media
companies become less profitable,
"how will we pay for the journalism
we need?"
That was the question posed in a
symposium sponsored by the Knight
Fellowships Program last night.
After 90 minutes of discussing the
issue in Kresge Auditorium, it was
apparent that there's no easy-to
agree-upon answer. But the panelists
did come to one consensus: newspa
pers are in bad shape.
In a sometimes testy conversation
during which panelists cut each other
off,an Internet executive, a media in
dustry analyst, the founder of
Salon.com and an editorial writer for
The San Jose Mercury News offered
diverging outlooks for the future of
the newspaper.
"It's a scary world for all the tradi
tional media," said Vindu Goel, an
editorial writer and blogger for The
Mercury News, who moderated the
event. "It's clear that the traditional
business model won't keep work
ing."
Lauren Rich Fine, a publishing
analyst, blamed the drop-off in clas

sified advertising for the precipitous
decline of the newspaper. Newspa
pers used to have a virtual monopoly
on selling ads for real estate, jobs and
cars. Now people go online.
"It isn't so much that readers
aren't interested in journalism," said
Fine, sitting with the others in chairs
that formed a semi-circle with a small
mahogany table at their feet. "This
industry has been asleep at the wheel
selling advertising."
David Talbot, founder of news
commentary Web site Salon.com,
chastised newspaper management
for not taking risks and being cre
ative. He decried cutbacks in news
room staff size as counterproductive
and said that even august papers like
The Chicago Tribune are looking
more and more like mid-level subur
ban papers.
"You can't have a shriveled prod
uct with cutbacks and cutbacks and
cutbacks and still expect people to
read," he said. "The newspaper in
dustry is still in a death spiral. It's not
investing enough in the future."
The panelists also discussed con
cerns about the bid by Rupert Mur
doch's News Corp. to buy The Wall
Street Journal. Talbot and Goel wor
ried about Murdoch's reported track
record of kowtowing to the Chinese
government at the price of journalis
tic integrity.
Pitching his company like a
salesman. Lem Lloyd, vice presi
dent of Yahoo!'s recently formed
Newspaper Consortium, said the
sales tool his company is marketing
will help newspapers "leverage"
their Web sites to make more
money.The consortium, announced
last November, partners more than
150 daily papers with the search
giant to personalize ads that read
ers see when they log onto news
Web sites.

"Newspapers, through the
Yahoo! deal, will be able to under
stand more about their site so they
can serve up the right ad, at the right
time, to the right audience." he said.
"Newspapers are ironically in a very
good place because local online ad
dollars are going locally."
Lloyd suggested that companies
aggressively hire ad salespeople to
stay competitive and push their lo
cally-tailored online product.
But Talbot strongly disagreed,
saying newspapers should stop giv
ing their content away to readers
without charging a subscription fee.
"Early on what happened was
that big newspapers made bad deals

with some of the Internet portals."
he said. " They devalued their own
content. At this point, it's getting the
genie back in the box. For one thing,
[newspaper companies] have to
swallow hard and say we're not
going to sell our stuff cheap any
more."
Talbot said that his online maga
zine, Salon.com, has successfully
charged what amounts to a volun
tary paid subscription.The number
of subscribers paying the monthly
fee, he acknowledged, dropped as
people realized that the site was not
about to go out of business.
"The challenge from the begin
ning was, 'what was our business

model going to be?'" he said, refer
ring to when the site was founded in
1995."Advertisers hadn't even heard
of the Internet, let alone an online
magazine."
Fine said newspapers can suc
ceed by focusing on producing local
news that is interesting to readers,
not necessarily by charging for con
tent. She cited the Cleveland Plain
Dealer's effort to cover high school
football with a special section in its
print edition and Web site, which
asked readers which games should
be covered.
"People's habits are changing."
she said. "Increasingly people are
going online. Consumers have a

choice.They look at the front page. If
they don't like it. they don't buy it."
Talbot said newspapers remain
in "crisis" and said he hoped man
agers could start to find the way
out.
"What I see is that newspapers
were slow to innovate, slow to re
spond to these challenges." he said.
"We've seen a decline in the quality
of the newspapers over the years.
Less space devoted to investigative
reporting. You don't have the voic
es of the columnists. They've be
come banal, tepid and bland."

saying newspapers should stop giv
ing their content away to readers
without charging a subscription fee.
"Early on what happened was
that big newspapers made bad deals

with some of the Internet portals."
he said. " They devalued their own
content. At this point, it's getting the
genie back in the box. For one thing,
[newspaper companies] have to
swallow hard and say we're not
going to sell our stuff cheap any
more."
Talbot said that his online maga
zine, Salon.com, has successfully
charged what amounts to a volun
tary paid subscription.The number
of subscribers paying the monthly
fee, he acknowledged, dropped as
people realized that the site was not
about to go out of business.
"The challenge from the begin
ning was, 'what was our business

model going to be?'" he said, refer
ring to when the site was founded in
1995."Advertisers hadn't even heard
of the Internet, let alone an online
magazine."
Fine said newspapers can suc
ceed by focusing on producing local
news that is interesting to readers,
not necessarily by charging for con
tent. She cited the Cleveland Plain
Dealer's effort to cover high school
football with a special section in its
print edition and Web site, which
asked readers which games should
be covered.
"People's habits are changing."
she said. "Increasingly people are
going online. Consumers have a

choice.They look at the front page. If
they don't like it. they don't buy it."
Talbot said newspapers remain
in "crisis" and said he hoped man
agers could start to find the way
out.
"What I see is that newspapers
were slow to innovate, slow to re
spond to these challenges." he said.
"We've seen a decline in the quality
of the newspapers over the years.
Less space devoted to investigative
reporting. You don't have the voic
es of the columnists. They've be
come banal, tepid and bland."
