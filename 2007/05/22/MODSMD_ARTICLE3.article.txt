## Panelists think about future of print edition Newspapers face uphill battle, speakers agree 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
As the print version of the news
paper becomes obsolete and media
companies become less profitable,
"how will we pay for the journalism
we need?"
That was the question posed in a
symposium sponsored by the Knight
Fellowships Program last night.
After 90 minutes of discussing the
issue in Kresge Auditorium, it was
apparent that there's no easy-to
agree-upon answer. But the panelists
did come to one consensus: newspa
pers are in bad shape.
In a sometimes testy conversation
during which panelists cut each other
off,an Internet executive, a media in
dustry analyst, the founder of
Salon.com and an editorial writer for
The San Jose Mercury News offered
diverging outlooks for the future of
the newspaper.
"It's a scary world for all the tradi
tional media," said Vindu Goel, an
editorial writer and blogger for The
Mercury News, who moderated the
event. "It's clear that the traditional
business model won't keep work

Lauren Rich Fine, a publishing
analyst, blamed the drop-off in clas

decline of the newspaper. Newspa
pers used to have a virtual monopoly
on selling ads for real estate, jobs and
cars. Now people go online.
"It isn't so much that readers
aren't interested in journalism," said
Fine, sitting with the others in chairs
that formed a semi-circle with a small
mahogany table at their feet. "This
industry has been asleep at the wheel
selling advertising."
David Talbot, founder of news
commentary Web site Salon.com,
chastised newspaper management
for not taking risks and being cre
ative. He decried cutbacks in news
room staff size as counterproductive
and said that even august papers like
The Chicago Tribune are looking
more and more like mid-level subur
ban papers.
"You can't have a shriveled prod
uct with cutbacks and cutbacks and
cutbacks and still expect people to
read," he said. "The newspaper in
dustry is still in a death spiral. It's not
investing enough in the future."
The panelists also discussed con
cerns about the bid by Rupert Mur
doch's News Corp. to buy The Wall
Street Journal. Talbot and Goel wor
ried about Murdoch's reported track
record of kowtowing to the Chinese
government at the price of journalis
tic integrity.
