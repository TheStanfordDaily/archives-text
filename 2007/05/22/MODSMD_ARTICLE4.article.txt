# Duplicate draw numbers assigned
## 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new number-generating program
mistakenly issued duplicate Draw num
bers to 81 groups this year, adding addi
tional worries to an already complex
process for the 135 affected students.
After consulting with the ASSU Un
dergraduate Housing Advisory Commit
tee, I lousing Assignments opted to notify
students who received duplicate numbers
by email last Friday, after the deadline for
listing housing preferences had passed.
Students were assured that their housing
assignments would not be affected by the
mistake.

"This situation occurred because of
some enhancements we made this year to
the computer process that issues the num
bers," said Director of Housing Assign
ments Sue Nunan.in an email to The Daily.
"Unfortunately, our careful testing of the
enhancements did not reveal any anomaly
until after actual numbers had been is
sued."
Only one of the affected students con
tacted Student Housing with additional
questions, which Nunan said indicated that
most students seemed unconcerned by the
news.
Scott Schonfeld '08, one of the students
assigned a duplicate number, said he felt
that Housing was too quick to brush away
students' worries.
"It seemed nebulous because they basi
cally said.'Don't worry about it,'"Schonfeld
said. "The email stressed that this wouldn't
have any bearing on my number but the re
ality is that it has to. It bumps up my number
one space or two spaces."
"If there was a mistake in the program
that assigns random numbers, who knows
what mistakes there are in the Draw pro
gram itself." said Rafe kinsey '08, a student
who has worked with Philosophy Prof. Marc
Pauly to study the Draw. "I think this shows
the importance of having experts working
on making sure that these resources work
properly."
Pauly said that a mistake in the number

generator could have an impact on the fair
ness of the Draw if the numbers generated
were non-random.
"If there are biases introduced at that
level the fairness of the overall system will
be impacted," Pauly said. "The only ques
tion is whether that happened."
I lousing emphasized that it has used sta
tistical analysis to double check that no such
bias occurred.
"The randomness of the Draw numbers
was not affected by this situation," Nunan
said. "The completely separate Draw pro
gram and process that assigns students to
housing was also not affected in any way by
the random number generator process."
Pauly also said that the mistake raises
worries about the opaqueness of the system.
"Historically, what happened is similar to

something like the tax system." Pauly said.
"[The Draw] was implemented in a simple
form and then in the course of its history
people came to add more features."
"For me the main lesson from this whole
error in the Draw numbers." he said."is that
it is just another argument for really simpli
fying the process."
For Schonfeld, worries about fairness
after the mistake center primarily on his
strategy in selecting housing preferences.
"I structured all my rankings to reflect
the confidence that I had in my number," he
said. "We weren't notified early enough in
the process, and I could have been really
screwed."
