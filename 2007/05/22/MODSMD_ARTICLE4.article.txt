# Duplicate draw numbers assigned
## 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new number-generating program
mistakenly issued duplicate Draw num
bers to 81 groups this year, adding addi
tional worries to an already complex
process for the 135 affected students.
After consulting with the ASSU Un
dergraduate Housing Advisory Commit
tee, I lousing Assignments opted to notify
students who received duplicate numbers
by email last Friday, after the deadline for
listing housing preferences had passed.
Students were assured that their housing
assignments would not be affected by the
mistake.

"This situation occurred because of
some enhancements we made this year to
the computer process that issues the num
bers," said Director of Housing Assign
ments Sue Nunan.in an email to The Daily.
"Unfortunately, our careful testing of the
enhancements did not reveal any anomaly
until after actual numbers had been is
sued."
Only one of the affected students con
tacted Student Housing with additional
questions, which Nunan said indicated that
most students seemed unconcerned by the
news.
