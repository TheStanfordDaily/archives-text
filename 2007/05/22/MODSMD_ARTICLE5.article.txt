## Committee supports vote on Exxon Mobil shares Oil company criticized over pro-environment marketing 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Board of Trustees Advi
sory Panel on Investment Responsibility
(APIR) voted last week to support a joint
shareholder resolution that will call on
Exxon Mobil to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
ITie vote, held by the APIR — a com
mittee affiliated with the Board of
Trustees — came as a response to growing
alumni frustration over an Exxon Mobil
publicity campaign that used Stanford's
name to portray the energy company as

environmentally friendly.
The APIR voted to support Resolution
15, which Exxon Mobil shareholders will
decide on at an annual meeting on May
30. The resolution is being co-filed by 41
shareholders, including several faith
based organizations. It calls on Exxon
Mobil to look into ways that would quan
titatively reduce greenhouse gas emis
sions at a reasonable cost.
"Exxon is one of the smartest companies
on the planet," said Kirk Miller M.S. '89,
who organized the alumni campaign."lf [it]
really [puts] effort into addressing climate
change issues, it's possible that real climate
change solutions could come forth."

Prof. Mark Jacobson said he was a bit
more pessimistic that a shareholder res-
olution could have a lasting effect
on a big oil company like Exxon
Mobil.
"It's a good idea but I don't think
it will be effective," Jacobson said.
"Exxon Mobil will continue to fight
against the regulations. 1 think it will
be a token effort but that it's not
going to have an impact on Exxon
Mobil."
Exxon Mobil has advertised the
company's financial support of the
University's Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) — which is
also supported by Toyota, General
Electric (GE) and Schlumberger
as an example of its new "green"
focus. But Stanford alumni and fac

ulty claim that the company's use of
the Stanford name is not justified.
GCEP director Franklin "Lynn"
()rr. a professor of energy resources
engineering, declined to comment
on the APIR vote.
Miller, however, said he was wor
ried that Exxon's support of the
GCEP project would not extend to
use of new technologies developed
in the energy industry.
"Since the GCEP project started,
many alumni have been really, real
ly unhappy with how Exxon has
been portraying its relationship with
Stanford," Miller said. "GE is not
abusing Stanford's name. Toyota
isn't and they're putting in a lot of
money as well."
"The only bad actor," he said, "is
Exxon."
