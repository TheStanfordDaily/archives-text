a 4-2 win in yesterday's semifinal
match of the NCAA Champi

snapped the Cardinal's own streak
of three straight NCAA titles and
eight straight championship match
appearances.
"They played probably their
best tennis of the year," said assis

terview from Athens. Ga. "They

the beginning by winning the dou

And ironically enough, the last
time Stanford lost the doubles
point was in its 4-3 loss to Georgia
Tech at the National Team Indoors
on Feb. 3, breaking the Cardinal's
89-match winning streak.
