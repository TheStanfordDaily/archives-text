### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Continuing a Cinderella run
with its third consecutive upset,
No. 12 UCLA ended No. 1 Stan
ford's season in shocking style with
a 4-2 win in yesterday's semifinal
match of the NCAA Champi
onships. The Bruins' victory
snapped the Cardinal's own streak
of three straight NCAA titles and
eight straight championship match
appearances.
"They played probably their
best tennis of the year," said assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan. talk
ing about UCLA in a telephone in
terview from Athens. Ga. "They
[the Bruins] had nothing to lose."
UCLA stunned Stanford from
the beginning by winning the dou
bles point. It was only the second
time this entire season that the
Cardinal lost the doubles point.
And ironically enough, the last
time Stanford lost the doubles
point was in its 4-3 loss to Georgia
Tech at the National Team Indoors
on Feb. 3, breaking the Cardinal's
89-match winning streak.

GAME NOTES: UCLA had its third consecu
tive upset to end the Cardinal's hopes of
a fourth straight NCAA title Much like in
Georgia Tech's breaking of the Cardi
nal's 89-match winning streak, the Bruins
garnered the doubles point. Stanford
failed to reach the NCAA title match after
eight straight seasons of appeanng in the
championship. The loss ended the team
careers of seniors Theresa Logar and
Anne Yelsey, who have led the Cardinal
to its past three NCAA championships.


SAMMY ABUSRUR/The Stanford Daily
Anne Yelsey fell in doubles and singles yesterday against UCLA. Stanford's streak of 22 consecu
tive NCAA Tournament match wins ended in Athens, as did its streak of eight straight seasons in
which the team made it to the Championship match.
Losing the doubles point proved to he a
huge pitfall for the Cardinal.The Bruins' mo
mentum from their doubles victory carried
into singles play, where they saw victories
from Tracy Lin over Cardinal senior Anne
Yelseyand Yasmin Schnack over junior Celia
Durkin.
Down 3-2 to UCLA, the Cardinal had its
last chance with junior Whitney Deason and
freshman Lindsay Burdette still out on the
courts. Stanford needed victories from both
players to win the match.
While Burdette held the Bruins' Eliza
beth Lumpkin at match point. Deason suf
fered a 6-7.6-1,6-3 loss to Ashley Joelsen that
ended the Cardinal's season. The final score
stood at 4-2 â€” Burdette's impending victory
against Lumpkin was never recorded.
Burdette praised the Bruins in their victo
"More than anything else, UCLA played
absolutely unbelievable," Burdette said.
"They put their best tennis on the court.They
got to us."
The target that No. 1 Stanford had on its
baeks also played a factor in the 4-2 loss.

UCLA, having already pulled off upsets over
No. 5 Northwestern and No. 4 Florida, was
loose and ready to take chances while the
Cardinal had the pressure of winning a
fourth straight national title.
"We were a little tight." Brennan said. "I
still feel in my heart of hearts that if we
played any team 10 times, we'd be up on
them. I think we have the best team in the
country, but it's hard to do it day-in and day
out every day."
Just a few days ago. the Cardinal was con
fident after a 4-0 "pounding" (according to
Yelsey) of Vanderbilt and 4-1 win over
Miami. Yelsey also described "a really, really
cool and calm mood" among the team in
Athens.
"We're having a good time; people aren't
stressed out and it's a fun atmosphere," she
added.
Butthe Bruins' victory broke that sereni
ty. as UCI .A moves into today's final, where
they will face the Cardinal's old foe. Georgia
I cch
The loss was particularly hard on seniors
Theresa Logar and Yelsey, who both played

their final team collegiate matches yesterday.
The co-captain duo only lost two games in its
four-year dual career, amassing an astonish
ing record of 110-2.
Logar and Yelsey also starred at the No. 1
and No. 2 positions for the Cardinal this year,
giving instant credibility to Stanford's lineup.
ITie loss was naturally harder on the two sen
iors.
By the time she was able to speak over
phone at 9:30 p.m. EST, Burdette said that
she and most of the team were over the loss.
"We came up short," she said. "It's not the
end of the world."
And the Cardinal can't spend too much
time dwelling on yesterday's loss. The indi
vidual championships begin tomorrow and
will run all through next week.
Despite the premature end to the team's
season, the women have plenty to be proud
of. Battling injuries and illness at nearly every
juncture this year. Stanford finished with an
impressive 24-2 record and was ranked No. 1
in the country for most of the season. The
team also captured a Pacific-10 Conference
title, going undefeated in conference play.

and earned the No. 1 seed for the NCAA
Championships.
"We have been through so mueh adversi
ty with injuries," Burdette said. "This season
was amazing regardless of how we finished
up. We all have that outlook now. Just he
cause we didn't win NCAAs doesn't mean
we didn't accomplish an unbelievable
amount during the season."
Brennan also gushed over the Cardinal
women and their actions both on and off the
