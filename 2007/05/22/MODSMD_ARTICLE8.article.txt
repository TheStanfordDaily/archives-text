## Attacking with body and mind "Searching for Bobby Fischer" star Waitzkin describes struggle for excellence in chess, martial arts 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
During his youth, Josh Waitzkin was
widely regarded as a chess prodigy.
From nine to IS, he was the highest
ranked chess player in America for his
age. Hut four years later, the subject of
the hook and 1993 movie "Searching for
Hobby Fischer" gave up professional
chess, due to what he has described as a
growing distance from the game. He then
embarked on an unlikely journey to the
arena of martial arts, winning multiple
world championships in the field of Tai
Chi Push Hands.
Now 31, Waitzkin says that his suc
cess in such seemingly disparate fields
was driven by a common element - a
love, and method of, learning. His new
book, " The Art of Learning: A Journey
in the Pursuit of Excellence" elaborates
a set of techniques that Waitzkin says is
essential to improvement in any subject.
After a Thursday signing event at the
Stanford Hookstore, Waitzkin said
down with The Daily to talk about his
views on the learning process and his
struggle to succeed at the top levels of
chess and tai chi.
The Stanford Daily: You mentioned
in your talk that if elements of your per
sonality haven't been confronted,
they'll come out under pressure. Could
you talk a bit about that in the context
of both of your pursuits, tai chi and
chess?
Josh Wait/kin: First of all. in the ab
stract. the way it works is that when
you're under incredible pressure, one
thing that happens is that the last thing
you learn is the first thing to go. It's very
interesting. If. for example, you're a
chess player and you've been working
on a certain weakness or a certain series
of ideas. If you're pushed to your ab
solute limit, the thing that's going to go
is the last thing you've been working
on —the last thing you've learned —be-
cause it's not so deeply embedded in
your being.
And then on a more profound level;
in terms of, for example, your state of
mind, your state of concentration, your
performance state,your zone. If I'm in a
world championship in the martial arts,
and I 'm dealing with an opponent who's
a very dirty player. 1 was coming against
the European Champion in the 2002
World Championships - everything he
did was illegal, he was targeting my
groin, he was targeting my neck. Every
thing he did was trying to make me
angry, trying to hurt me. And so if 1 had
n't confronted why it is that I get angry,
if I hadn't confronted what anger is re
ally about, what the indignant response
to a dirty player is really all about —
because what it's about is fear. When
someone does something which is infu
riating. it's because on some level it's
challeniiine. and it makes us uncomfort

able - it's unsettling.
For many years the training I did was
in the martial arts was ... [meant to deal
with this). It all began when I was com
peting in my first national Push Hands
championship, and in the finals, I was
competing against this guy. 1 was domi
nating the tournament, I was dominat
ing the match, and then what he started
to do was throw head butts to the nose.
The second head butt, I was getting this
incredible blood rush, this incredible,
wild blood rush to my head - you get out
of control like a bull seeing red. and 1
started to lose control of myself. Instead
of using his aggression, taking advan
tage of it. I started to become a pure ag
gressor. away from the methodical, in
trospective,aware competitor. I became
like a crazy,out-of-control bull. I almost
lost; I ended up recovering myself just
before. So I wanted to take on this ques
tion of why was I becoming angry. 1 be
came angry because I didn't know how
to deal with head-butting to the nose. I
didn't know how to deal with someone
targeting my groin, or my knees, or my
neck, because 1 was used to people who
played by the rules. It was fear.
So I started training against people
who were dirty, seeking out dirty play
ers to play with in my place: the guys
who were out of control, the most
fierce. The guys who were the biggest
creeps, you know. There was this guy. I
call him Frank in the book, he always
tried to attack my jugular. Whenever he
was being dominated, he would go after
you. Complete creep. I got to the point,
I realized, [where] I got angry; I didn't
know how to deal with it.the anger was
a defense mechanism. I acted as though
I was above it but in fact I was having a
fear response.
And I started to work with him and I
started to learn how to handle that, how
to technically handle those responses,
that dirty play, and he inspired me to
perform to the very height of my ability.
And then in competition, you go
back to this scene I was describing,
with the Austrian. When he came at me
with his dirty play. I smiled. I took it. I
channeled it to more and more of an
intense state. And the interesting thing
there is that you have this dirty player,
who's used to affecting his opponent,
and so the reaction of his opponents is
a leg that he uses to stand on. If I don't
react, he's without a leg he's used to,
and he falls apart. He ended up getting
more and more out of control, and
ended up completely self-destructing,
because I wasn't reacting to it. And the
reason that I wasn't reacting to it is
that 1 was reacting to what was really
going on.
TSI):Y oil mention dirty play a lot in
the book as well. What is your insight
into the differing motivation that sepa
rates why you want to practice tai chi or
play chess, and the Russian player that
kicked you under the table [during
chess games). Is there a difference in
motivation?
JW:Yeah. there is. My love is for the
self-cultivation that comes with these
things. Of course, you get very ambi
tious in this also. There's always dirty
players. But I've never gone there. If I
did. I would have to stop (playing)...
A lot of people were win-at-all-costs.
Coming from the Soviet bloc, where
they were incredibly poor ... pre
breakup. the Russian school of chess
was basically about winning, and doing
what it takes to win. And so there were
no qualms about breaking rules, or
skirting the barriers of what might be
ethical or what might not. And that was
something about my relationship to
being a good sport or being ethical. And
it isn't important to beat a lot of people,
because when they're confronted with
the option of winning a world title or
not - they'll win at all costs.
TSI):You discuss the incremental
versus entity theory of learning in your
book — do you think that the win-at
all-costs versus loving the competition
plays out...
JW:Let me answer. I know where
you're going.The kids who cheat, for ex
ample. in school - the kids who copy the
teachers' test questions, [and] niemo

rize the answers have a very different
experience than taking their time and
learning all the material, the ideas be
hind the material. If you have the win
at-all-costs. results-oriented approach,
you're not learning anything, you're
memorizing. And you're also program
ming yourself to associate success not
only with cheating, but with memoriz
ing. and this static, inorganic relation
ship with learning.
While if you value the long-term les
sons you learn, the long-term successes
over the short-term successes, you'll
have a very different approach. In the
book, 1 talk, about the under-18 World
Chess Championship |title game]. The
Russian guy offered me a draw, and 1
could have just shaken hands and tied
for first place. I turned him down and
lost — and it was a heartbreaking loss,
the most heartbreaking loss of my life.
But the interesting thing is. if I had
t;iken the draw. 1 wouldn't have had the
game - I would have had some glory.
But the loss was heartbreaking. But it
was incredibly important for me to have
that experience. 1 was playing to win -
the goal is putting yourself on the line,
that's what will open up the long-term
effects. But cheating, or playing dirty,
that's not putting yourself on the line —
ethical issues aside, and for me, the eth
ical issues would have been enough.
TSI): I hat makes sense. Returning
more to the abstract, the book talks a lot
about, beyond chess and tai chi, tech
niques like "Making Smaller Circles"
and "Investing in Loss." What makes
those things an art rather than a sci
ence?
,IW:For one thing, it's because my
fundamental method is not putting peo
ple into some sort of mold, but finding
individuals' unique paths. Now. there
are some techniques [everyone] can
apply. In training for the [Tai Chi Push
Hands] world championship in 2004. we
were using these intuitive breaks we'd
have, these breakthroughs we'd have,
letting each one's personal intuition,
personal style, lead the creative process.
Everyone's essential reality is very dif
ferent.
I don't believe that everyone should
fit into this one mold. 1 believe that
these ideas can help give a direction -
(but) you take them and make them
your own.That's the difference.
TSDtCould you expand a bit on indi
vidualized [learning| in contrast with
the cookie-cutter style of teaching you
were mentioning earlier.
JW: For a long time I had this teacher
who was trying to put me in this mode of
chess player, which wasn't my natural
style - I was a very creative, attacking
player, but he wanted to make me into
more of a Karpovian player. [Former
World Champion Anatoly Karpov is
renowned for his defensive style of
play.] And I was in this box: it wasn't
good for me. And suddenly I had to
think of. "What would Karpov play
here?" as opposed to. 'What would Josh

play here?" And my style of play was
the opposite of Karpov's. There are a lot
of chess positions were there are two or
three moves which are equally good,
and [you] play different moves depend
ing on your style of play. A lot of teach
ers try to replicate themselves in their
students. That's a bad style. You want a
teacher who can bring out their natural
shine.

TSD: When students have paths that
take them far from what's a normal
path ...often people will hear,'it'sjust a
game,'or 'it's just an instrument.'
What's your response to arguments
like that?
JW: Anything in life is what you
make of it. To some people, chess is just
a game. Chess could he like checkers.
Anything you do, you can do it as an
artist, or you can do it as a mindless au
tomaton. People who want to put things
in boxes usually put them in boxes
which is defined by their limitations of
understanding. If I'm going to be de
scribing my own ideas to you, you're
going to describe my ideas as you un
derstand them, because they're going to
come through you. If you are studying
chess, what you bring to it — how you
approach it — is what chess will be to
you. If you try to find the deeper mys
tery of chess, if you plunge into your
soul, your being — I don't mean soul in
a religious sense — the core of your
being, unrelentingly honest with your
self about your weaknesses, and you're
not lazy, you begin to feel the har
monies: it's not just a game. Same with
art. Same with life.
Chess is a tunnel you can plunge as
deeply into as you are capable of plung
ing. Or you can skip around the surfaces
of everything. Life is the same.
TSI) In your book, you mention a
lot about the psychological tells, in
chess or tai chi - do you think those ele
ments are essential, and how does that
get impacted by things like computer
chess programs?
JW: I never liked playing on the In
ternet, because I always liked the feel of
humans. 1 liked the psychological feel of
my opponent, the drama of the game. I
used to think that computers would ruin
chess, but then I came to the idea of.
"Why don't we use technology to bring
out the human side of the game?" My
idea, in a lot of versions of Chcssmaster.

has been to bring out the human, psy
chological. dramatic, sensual elements
of the experience through a computer.
TSI): More of the psychology. It
seems, looking at Bobby Fischer or your
childhood rival whose father made him
play chess 12 hours a day ••• what does
being devoted to chess do to you men
tally? Can it screw you up?

Chess is a tunnel you can plunge in as
deeply as you are capable of plunging. Or
you can skip around the surfaces of
everything. Life is the same.
JOSH WAITZKIN, chess champion turned martial arts expert

JVV: It can screw people up if you
have a bad relationship to the game,
which is unhealthy. Anything can.
Music, ballet. Stage parents who are out
of control, crazy. If you have an un
healthy relationship to what you do it
will destroy you. If you have a wonder
ful relationship it will be wonderful.
That's what my book is about: the art of
learning, not how to learn chess. It does
n't matter what the discipline is. it mat
ters how you learn it. Tai chi is about
putting your body in the right align
ment, but if you do tai chi badly, it's ter
rible. I"he healthiest thing in the world,
done badly, can be unhealthy.
TSI): After you won the elemen
tary school championship, you said in
the book that you'd go back to
school, your friends would congratu
late you. and you'd play football. Do
you think having a support group -
friends, family - helped you ... take
the long view?
JW: It's good to have an outlet or
two, something that allows you to ex
plore your connections. Every summer
[as a child] I would go fishing with my
family for six weeks, left everything be
hind. .So 1 would work, work, work -
then I would have a period of time when
I would let it all go. I'm also a bit of a
naturalist, looking for connections with
nature. Plunging deeply into other
things (can help you avoid] tunnel vi
sion.
TSl):That's all I have to ask - thanks
for talking to me!
JVV: My pleasure.
Waitzkin has no plans to return to
professional chess or tai chi. Instead, he
is tackling another sport, training for
the 2011 World Championships of
Brazilian jujitsu.
