# Where have all the anti-war protests gone?
## Campus community generally silent on situation in Iraq 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq
last March, a nighttime vigil provided an op
portunity for concerned students to gather by
candlelight and reflect on a war that was enter
ing its fifth year.
The attendees?
"It was mostly graduate students and com
munity members," said Laura Wadden "09, cit
ing the noticeably low turnout of Stanford un
dergraduates. "It's a conversation we don't
have at Stanford very often."
A number of students and faculty offer
similar observations of the undergraduate stu
dent body, in regards to the startlingly sub
dued level of anti-war activism on campus.
While the phenomenon is not exclusively at
tributed to Stanford in particular, nor under
graduates, many suggest a number of theories
as to why vehement anti-war protests barken
ing back to the 1960s are but a distant memo
ry on campus.
Mandatory conscription laws are no longer
in effect as they were in Vietnam — a fact that
students and professors cited as an explanation
for the lack of anti-war campus protests today
Additionally, Wadden pointed out that most
Stanford students don't have friends or family
members in the military
"That's why the war doesn't feel as close to
home," she said. "People feel a sense of discon
nect."
Many students who were approached about
how the situation in Iraq related to their own
lives had little to say, confessing that they did
not feel a substantial connection to the war.
One exception is Tristan Abbey '08, a past
member of the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps (ROTC) and witness to many friends'
deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. Stanford
does not have an ROTC program on campus,
and students who participate must travel to
other universities, such as Santa Clara Univer
sity San Jose State University and University
of California-Berkeley. Abbey's father, too,
worked as a civilian with Iraqi reconstruction.
"All Stanford students know there is a war

going on," he said. "Lots of them like to blame
America for it. lots of them go on and on about
how it's all for oil, yet very few of them seem to
know anyone in the military. Aside from
mouthing platitudes and regurgitating what
the New York l imes says, I don't think most
people really care."
In response to the generally silent campus
community, Omar Shakir '07 is working with
Wadden to develop an Anti-War Coalition, to
be launched in the fall.The group, according to
Shakir. will raise awareness of the situation in
Iraq by serving as a "vehicle for students from
all different perspectives to come together and
make the issue more real."
Shakir himself has witnessed the regression
of political activism at Stanford since his fresh
man year, when the war was in its beginning
stages.
"When the Iraq war started, there was a lot
of energy on campus," he recalled. "What has
undermined activist efforts since then, howev
er, is what he calls a growing "culture against
protests," at Stanford in particular.
"Since the 19605, there's been a death of
[anti-war] protests," said Shakir. "When we
think of protests, we don't think of Gandhi, or
Martin Luther King. Jr., or Cesar Chavez and
all the great things they did. We think. 'What
are these crazy people doing? Why aren't they
just writing a paper?"'
According to Wadden, "Our idea of change,
as Stanford students, is actually doing some
thing. People don't want to rally; they want to
see some tangible result. It doesn't seem like a
problem anybody wants to tackle because
there's no real way to stop it."
Scott Herndon, who teaches a course in the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric called "The
Ugly American: Travel, Bad Behavior and the
Rhetoric of Power," similarly attributed a sub
dued level of anti-war activism to a changing
perception of protests. A past Gulf War protes
tor himself, he was careful not to mislabel the
Stanford community as apathetic.
"Apathy often suggests a lack of care. This
generation of students cares deeply about (the
war], but unlike earlier generations, it seems
wary of protests and what they can achieve," he
said." It's not that [students] don't care; it's that
the avenues for successful action seem so wild
ly unclear."
"In effect, what's happening at Stanford is
happening all over the country," he continued.

"We are stuck in a rhetorical battle about ener
gy. terrorism and democracy. For many, there
doesn't seem to be a feasible way to get out —
literally or metaphorically."
Last December, I lerndon gave feedback to
two students in a class he teaches on protest
theory. I lis students took a different approach
to raising attention about the situation in Iraq.
A few took the initiative to organize "Chalking
Up the Dead," a series of human body chalk
outlines dispersed throughout campus.
The protest was timed with the release of
the Iraq Report. Ilie effort included printed
material and media interviews in its attempt to
raise awareness of the countless military and
civilian deaths in Iraq.
What made the non-partisan demonstra
tion so powerful, explained I lerndon. was that
"in being anonymous, [the protest] generated
mystery and interest in the local media." The
fact that it was not associated with a certain

group or political party, he explained, made on
lookers less likely to make assumptions and
marginalize the issue at hand.
Wadden and Shakir likewise suggested new
avenues for approaching the Stanford commu
nity.
"Some people say we're not going to pull
the troops out of Iraq," said Wadden. "But if we
just are silent while our government goes and
creates these imperialistic wars, the govern
ment is not going to he held responsible."
The solution, according to Shakir. is "break
ing the silence." By "directly relating [the war]
to Stanford students," via spreading informa
tion in high schools, on campus and through
the ASSU. he hopes to make the situation in
Iraq more relevant to students' lives.
"This is our generation," said Shakir. "We
need to play a part in the dialogue."
