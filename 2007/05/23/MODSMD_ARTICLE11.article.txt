## FORGE provides unique opportunity for passionate volunteers in Zambia 
### LINUS LIANG 
While most Stanford students are preparing for their sum
mer internships and finalizing their vacation plans, eight stu
dents are bracing themselves for the reality of living in one of
the least developed countries in the world: Zambia. Once
there, they will only be allowed to shower once a week, brave
the constant threat of malaria and leave every amenity they
have grown accustomed to.
'ITieir motivation for putting up tolerating these circum
stances? I"he direct impact they will have helping the people
who have been devastated by years of war. These students
are all part of Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth
and Empowerment (FORGE), an organization founded at
Stanford in 2003 that is dedicated to helping the million of
refugees in Africa.
"It is the first organization I have seen that really aims to
work through partnership, be responsive to refugee commu
nity needs and promote leadership amongst all involved."
said FORGE Hub Coordinator Julie Veroff 07.

The Stanford team will depart on June 24 to Zambia's
capital city, Lusaka. Upon arrival, they will travel 40 hours on
mostly dirt roads to the Mwange Refugee Camp, meeting up
with other Stanford students who have been in there since
June 2006. During the two-month stay, they will work on
community development projects such as establishing a
health outreach and education center, training teachers,
teaching skills to empower women and repatriating refugees
from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
They will work intimately with the refugee staff and ulti
mately turn the projects over entirely to them. This unique
approach is what differentiates FORGE: Its members be
lieve that immense positive change is best accomplished
working hand in hand with the people directly impacted.
FORGE prides itself in being different from other inter
national student volunteer organizations in two other ways.
l irst, FORGE views refugees as a catalyst of develop
ment in Africa, rather than an economic burden on their host
countries. Secondly, they use a volunteer work force of al
most all college students to create a group of energetic, qual
ified people approaching African community development
in a unique, collaborative manner with a focus on exiled peo
ples.
A summer 2005 experience with FORGE in Zambia in
spired Katie Bollbach *07, Jonny Dorsey '07 and Lauren

Young '07 to found the organization FACE AIDS, a student
awareness and fundraising campaign that has mobilized stu
dents across the country.
Yet even participants who do not return to the States and
create nonprofit organizations continue to be affected by
their experiences in Zambia and speak passionately in sup
port of the organization and its work.
"Since FORGE, these [refugees] have become central is
sues in my life, and I see their ramifications all around me,"
said Abby Speight '08. who participated in FORGE in 2006.
