## Archaeologist digs up Teotihuacan mysteries Speaker discusses rise, demise of ancient Mexican city 
### BEN CASEMENT 
Archaeologist Linda Manzanilla uncovered
the cultural complexities of the ancient, multi
ethnic civilization ot Teotihuacan during a pres
entation yesterday afternoon in Bolivar House.
Teotihuacan, which is located northeast of
Mexico City, is one of the largest and most visit
ed archaeological sites in the Americas. Accord
ing to Manzanilla, its population was comprised
of many different ethnic groups, each of which
lived in its own neighborhood.
Unlike most Mesoamerican civilizations, the
city lacked clear borders.
"What I don't see is a territory well-defined
with frontiers." she said.'it'sa very amoeba-like
thing."
Equally interesting to many academics is the

civilization's mysterious demise. One hypothe
sis is that climate change wrought a devastating
drought that wiped the civilization out.
Others speculate that inter-ethnic tensions
boiled over into civil strife which brought the
civilization down.
"Teotihuacan feigned a cohesion and
strength that it did not have." Manzanilla said.
To illustrate her point. Manzanilla refer
enced a large tire that swept the elite sections
of the city between 550 and 570. She speculat
ed that the fire was caused by an internal re
volt.
Manzanilla also spoke about the character
istically Mesoamerican human sacrifice that
was practiced at Teotihuacan.
"They were skinned, flayed, decapitated dis
membered," she said. "Who the victims were is
unclear. We do not know, hut we will try to find
out."
