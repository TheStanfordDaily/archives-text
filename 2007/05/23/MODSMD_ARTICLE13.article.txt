## Editorial Board Ad campaign within Exxon's rights 
### 
Students, faculty and staff should be
proud of the University's recent deci
sion to support a shareholder resolu
tion calling on energy giant and major Stan
ford donor Exxon Mobil to take substantive
steps to reduce its greenhouse gas emis
sions/Hie resolution is a laudable confirma
tion of our University's academic integrity.
But the alumni campaign to censure
Exxon, after the company touted its part
nership with Stanford in a media campaign
that Kirk Miller *X 7 calls a "tig leaf" to hide
its inaction on short-term climate steps,
comes across as a bit ungrateful.
In2oo2,Exxon Mobil promised $100 mil
lion to Stanford's Global Climate and Ener
gy Project (C3CEP), a research project
aimed at developing cost-efficient and
greener energy solutions. The University
has taken 11 ak for accepting the money, in
cluding most recently the loss, in March, of a
$2.5 million gilt from perennial donor Steve
Bing '87.
Despite the criticism, the University's
decision to accept the Exxon grant was the
right one. Research and development will
play a critical role in solving the world's en

crg\ crisis, and large gifts like Exxon's help
keep Stanford on the cutting edge of creat
ing those solutions. And Stanford's academ
ic integrity will not be compromised by the
donation. According to GCEP director
Franklin Orr, Jr. research decisions are
made by solely by the project's faculty.
Although I won receives five-year ex
clusive rights to discoveries funded by its
contribution, at least Stanford scientists
have the resources to pursue the research.
Moreover, five years of exclusive rights is
fifteen years less than what the oil company
would receive if it were to conduct the re
search privately and then patent its findings.
As a research university, Stanford has
every reason to accept grants like Exxon's.
By taking the money, however, Stanford
forfeits the right to complain when the oil
company uses its name in ad campaigns
flaunting its partnerships for green energy
solutions Hie $100 million gilt is partially a
publicity ploy, but we should recognize that
and move on. It not for the PR benefits,
companies like Exxon might not choose to
fund green energy research at all. That
would be a sad loss.
