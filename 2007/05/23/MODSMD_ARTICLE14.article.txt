# RIP, fun?

My favorite quote from the movie
'"Old School" occurs when Vince
Vaughn asks Mitch if he had a good
time at his party, Mitch-a-Palooza. Will Ter
rell hursts in. "I had an awesome time!"
"Frank. I know you had an awesome time,"
Vaughn responds in his typical, sardonic
tone."l think the entire town knows you had
an awesome time."
The above interaction is a perfect de
scription of my experience at senior formal.
My friends didn't need to ask if I had a good
time — they knew I had a good time. In
stead. they asked me if I made it hack to
school alive. Their inquiry was easily an
swered when I saw them a few hours later at
Beltane. We sipped homemade beer, lis
tened to relaxing folk tunes and enjoyed the
beautiful Saturday afternoon.
I agree with the masses — Stanford is in
deed lamer than it was ten years ago. But I
can't say I don't enjoy myself. I mean. I don't
even have many friends and I still have fun.
A typical Thursday consists of a grueling af
ternoon of sailing, followed by wine-tasting,
then a surprise party for a friend and finally
pub night, which I often don't attend out ot
sheer laziness. My weekends stretch from
Wednesday to Sunday, and if "hanging out"
were a class, I'd definitely be getting a li t /A
( ITiat's above average, right?). 1 have been
trying my hardest to appreciate my last few
months on the Farm, and I think I've been
doing a good job.
However, with each passing weekend I
also become more worried. I can't help but
think that this is the peak of my social life.

After all. wind on the street is that these are
the best tour years of our lives. Will the good
times soon come to an abrupt end?
Luckily, a weekend away from the Farm
mollified my anxiety. While we might be
forced to say goodbye to our ridiculous
lifestyles (I don't think my boss will like me
it I go sailing from 12 to 3 p.m. every Thurs
day), I whole-heartedly believe that fun
doesn't die at graduation.
M\ first piece of evidence: weddings.
After attending a wedding in Sonoma Coun
ty I concluded that wedding celebrations are
the greatest traditions on the planet (besides
Si Patrick's Day and B'nai Mitzvahs).
1 lere's an idea: I've decided I want to spend
the rest of my life with this person, so I'm
going to buy .ill my friends and family mem
bers an extravagant meal. I'll also throw in a
live band and an open bar. If that isn't a
recipe for fun. I don't know what is.The mag
nificence of weddings touches everyone,
whatever theii age or previous notions of
tun. Ilie\ bring together generations in a cel
ebration of love and alcohol, and give an op-
