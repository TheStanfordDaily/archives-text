# Dropping hints a how-to
## 
### 
UO ure is getting dark! I should be
heading to bed soon.""I .ook at the
W-/ time! I've got cookies in the oven."
"Uh oh! Dennis I lopper has wired my body
with high-powered explosives, and il I don't
continue moving at a certain speed its going
to explode!"
Ah. dropping hints: The ultimate way out
of any difficult situation â€” especially one in
volving an unwanted advance. A properly
placed "I'm busy" can go a long way. A fleet
ing glance toward a large stack of books or a
noticeable watch-checking are very effective
ways to say. "I would rather not be with you.
Go away immediately!" An audible yawn is
perhaps the best way to indicate,"you are not
fit for my sight ."
If life, and my mom, have taught me any
thing.it'stobe nice topeople.not to hurt their
feelings, and to "let them down gently," if
need be. And what better way to do this than
to drop a hint? Iliis is subtlety in its purest
form In the course of the average day. I find
myself dropping hints in three out of every
four sentences I utter.
Hut this strategy carries with it the danger
that whomever I'm talking to will not "take
the hint". Kike in football, a well dropped

hint requires a good pass and a good catch. If
one happens without the other, then the pass
is incomplete.
Unfortunately, at Stanford. I find that
these "incomplete passes" are as numerous
as the empty seats in our actual football sta
dium.
I have a tendency to blame other people
for this, the prevailingcultureof relative awk
wardness has made the average Stanford stu
dent into an inept hint-taker, unable to sense
subtlety, unable to recognize the nuances of
the situation.
Hut what i( the problem is not that no one
else can take a hint, but that I simply can't
