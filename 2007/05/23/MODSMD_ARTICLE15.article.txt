# Dropping hints a how-to

UO ure is getting dark! I should be

"Uh oh! Dennis I lopper has wired my body
with high-powered explosives, and il I don't
continue moving at a certain speed its going
to explode!"
Ah. dropping hints: The ultimate way out
of any difficult situation — especially one in
volving an unwanted advance. A properly
placed "I'm busy" can go a long way. A fleet
ing glance toward a large stack of books or a
noticeable watch-checking are very effective
ways to say. "I would rather not be with you.
Go away immediately!" An audible yawn is
perhaps the best way to indicate,"you are not
fit for my sight ."
If life, and my mom, have taught me any
thing.it'stobe nice topeople.not to hurt their
feelings, and to "let them down gently," if
need be. And what better way to do this than
to drop a hint? Iliis is subtlety in its purest
form In the course of the average day. I find
myself dropping hints in three out of every
four sentences I utter.
Hut this strategy carries with it the danger
that whomever I'm talking to will not "take
the hint". Kike in football, a well dropped

hint requires a good pass and a good catch. If
one happens without the other, then the pass
is incomplete.
Unfortunately, at Stanford. I find that
these "incomplete passes" are as numerous
as the empty seats in our actual football sta
dium.
I have a tendency to blame other people
for this, the prevailingcultureof relative awk
wardness has made the average Stanford stu
dent into an inept hint-taker, unable to sense
subtlety, unable to recognize the nuances of
the situation.

drop one? In dropping hints, one
must walk a thin line between getting
the point across and not hurting the
other person's feelings. Inexperi
enced with subtlety as I am, I often err
on the subtle side of this line by put
ting forth an overly veiled comment.
I have thought the matter over,
however, and after a great deal of ex
perience 1 have come up with a list of
suggestions for dropping carefully
crafted and yet effectively presented
hints.
Let us first start with situational
awkwardness. Making things awk
ward is a good way to tell her you're
not interested. I'emporarily become a
member of an unpopular cult or
quasi-religious group. I hat means
pull out the old Satanic robes, crystal
balls and palmistry advertisements.
II approached by an all-too-eager
conversationalist,don't let down your
guard. Outline the benefits of the Sci

ontology lifestyle. Or, especially it the
person you're talking to is a staunch
supporter ot the ( hinese ( ommunist
Party, bring up your affiliation to
Falun C iong.
Cultivating situational awkward
ness is all about knowing the person
you're talking to and their stereo
typed demographic. See a guy with a
pons tail ? Might be time to bring up
the benefits ot tree trade. Crew cut?
Outline the failures of the Iraq war.
Next in your arsenal should be pow
erful one-liners. ITiese are sentences
so offensive, bizarre, or off putting as
to immediately end any conversation
in which they spring up
l or instance:
Her: Weather here sure is nice
today!
You:ABORTION IS MURDI R.
(Note: With the one-liners, the more
extreme the better, whethei or not
you actually believe these things )
I ler: I low's your day?
You: I lie Holocaust never hap
pencd.and I've got a venereal disease
to boot.
()ne-liners should be offensive.e\
treme and unnecessary. Ihe\ should

he phrases which only a small minor
ity of people would agree with, least
of all the person you're talking to.
If all else fails,enter DEf -CON 3:
feigning homo/heterosexuality. Tem
porarily celebrate (Jpposite Day, as
you ask yt»ui conversational partner
the best way to attract a partner of
the gender opposite whatever they
are. Iliis is a surefire way to end an
unpleasant and unwanted romantic
advance.
Though the advice above has pri
marily concerned dropping the "big"
hint, that is to say. "I'm not interest
ed." my strategies work in a variety ot
situations completely divorced from
this context. Whether you're trying to
study, trying not to study or trying to
concentrate on bettering your My-
Space. dropping hints is the ultimate
way out. And if you use my tips, your
hints will be picked up every time,
with very little emotional conse
quence. Well, at least for you.
