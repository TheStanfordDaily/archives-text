# Woe from wit

### 
Last summer, in a language immersion
program. 1 played in a production of
"Gore Ot Uma" by Alexandr Gri
boyedov. In case for some crazy reason
you're not up on your l l )th century Slavic
dramatic literature, the play is basically the
Russian "Hamlet" — although any good
Muscovite would tell you that "Hamlet" is
the Russian "I lamlet" (or "Camlet" as they
say over there), because Russia is the ci adle
of all culture and Pushkin wrote the pants
off of Shakespeare. I played the pivotal role
"Mute Girl in Ugly Dress Hunched Behind
Sofa" and honestly, ten months later, have
entirely forgotten what the play is about.
But one line from the entire debacle sticks
with me; "Dym oteclwstva nam slailok i
priyaten."
Roughly translated, the line means, "the
smoke of the fatherland is, to us. sweet and
pleasant." To Russians, who memorize po
etry by heart as schoolchildren and never
entirely grow out of the habit, the phrase is
as familiar as a line of "The Raven" or
"Have you had your break today?" 1 fig
ured it meant roughly the same thing as our
conventional "Every rose has its thorn,"
and tucked it away in my phrase-bank of
nifty foreign aphorisms, figuring one sunny
day in Moscow it might be of service.
I was wrong.
The whole three months 1 lived in
Moscow, no one ever called upon me to re
cite poetry or prove that 1 knew anything
about the culture. Sure, my host parents
continually cited great works of Russian lit
erature and sketched thumbnail reproduc
tions of famous Russian paintings for my
dinner-table edification, but to them, cul
tural learning was a one-way street. I was a
vessel to be filled with Russianncss — usu
ally in the form of over-salted borscht.Their
good American host daughter knew the
lyrics to Eminem songs and the names of a
few high-profile fashion designers, and that

was enough.
Once 1 actually tried to shoehorn the
phrase into conversation, describing why I
wanted to keep pursuing academia even
though it can be frustrating at best. I fearing
their uproarious mirth. I wondered whether
I had stumbled upon a ghastly mistransla
tion. Wiping his eyes with unkind glee, my
host father informed me that, no, I was
making grammatical sense but "katrin. you
have the curls of a poet and the mind of a
peasant woman." I decided to interpret
"peasant" in the flattering Marxist sense of
the word.
In spite of this embarrassing and inexpli
cable gaffe, the phrase stuck with me over
the next few months as I wandered through
reeking Metro labyrinths and skittered
around vodka-acrid quasi-corpses splayed
in sidestreet alleys. Maybe because I'm
used to our bright, synthetic, aggressively
hygienic American lifestyle, the smoke of
the fatherland jumped out at me on all
sides. Every way 1 turned, prototypical so
cial dilemmas rankled the senses:The stale
waft of Marlboro Ultra-lite blown into my
stinging eyes by a pregnant girl teetering on
five-inch heels; the glint glint glint of mossy
golden molars jeering raucously at my ac
cent; the insistent brittle pricking grasp of a
homeless teenager in Petersburg clutching
my wrist and begging for melochki (literal
ly "little dear ones." actually small change
that has almost no monetary worth in
American currency.)

By the time I left Moscow. I swear to you
I knew every pockmark on its greasy grin
ning face. On the flight back to San Francis
co. I thought I could never glut myself on
enough not-Russia. Miracle Whip. Wonder
Bread, Marvel Comics — it's all in the
branding: America is fucking phenomenal.
Who needs dym otechestva when you have
"Do the Dew" and a million other more
pronounceable mottos?
Hxcept now, six months later. I increas
ingly realize that when 1 left Mother Russia,
I walked away from the only woman I have
ever cared for. Yes, we got in fights, I called
her some ugly names, she blew smoke in my
face on not a few instances. Most of the time
1 am convinced that what 1 am doing now is
infinitely superior to the time I wasted try
ing to understand her. but when 1 go to bed
at night I dream of her unexplored territo
ries. the stench and rot and untidiness of
love.
Finally Griboyedov's phrase has made
the transition from words 1 live with to
words I live by. Not just accepting but re
joicing in the stink and nausea of the thing
you love is worlds away from just blithely
picking some thorny rose. A fatherland is
not something you choose: It is some power
that is a part of you and the legacy of which,
god willing, you will eventually become a
part. Hie quotation isn't about putting up
with the faults of something or someone
you choose to put in your life — it's not
watching "The Office" even though you
hate Steve t'arell or eating gelato even if it
gives you a tummyache. It's finding the
thing that you absolutely cannot not do and
then doing it to the utmost, rocketing to
your destination with squalling force, even
if it terrifies you.

you love is worlds away from just blithely
picking some thorny rose. A fatherland is
not something you choose: It is some power
that is a part of you and the legacy of which,
god willing, you will eventually become a
part. Hie quotation isn't about putting up
with the faults of something or someone
you choose to put in your life — it's not
watching "The Office" even though you
hate Steve t'arell or eating gelato even if it
gives you a tummyache. It's finding the
thing that you absolutely cannot not do and
then doing it to the utmost, rocketing to
your destination with squalling force, even
if it terrifies you.

Kat is heartbroken not to he living in Russia
this summer. Send your condolences to
