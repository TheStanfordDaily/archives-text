## Open letter to President Hennessy 
### HERSHEY AVULA MONDAIRE JONES 
Dear President Hennessy:
We hope tins letter finds you well, and in
the righteous spirit Stanford students have
come to admire and respect about your ad
ministration.
The hard work and research of the stu
dents leading the Sweat-free Stanford cam
paign has brought forward the disquieting
reality of our I Jniversity's use of sweatshop
labor in the production of its collegiate ap
parel. I'lie Sweat-free Stanford campaign
has not only been able to rally the general
student body, but h;is also brought together
community groups and civil rights activists
in a joint effort to curtail and eventually
end Stanford's use of sweatshop labor. As
representatives of the Associated Students
of Stanford University, we would also like
to express our general support for the
sweat-free campaign and to echo the con
cerns of our fellow students regarding the
University's disappointing absence from
any coalition or association of groups
aimed at fighting the deplorable working
conditions that laborers in factories pro
ducing Stanford licensed apparel are forced
to endure. With this said, however, we
would also like to commend the Univer
sity for the interest it has shown in the issue
and its desire to help effect far-reaching
change in the industry with whatever action
it takes.
As individuals who are familiar with the
administrative interface of the University
and the often lengthy timeline necessary to
make decisions of this scale, we understand
the University's reservation about itnmedi
ately signing on to any coalition fighting
against sweatshop labor. We are also keen
to the fact that the removal of sweatshop
labor from apparel-producing factories,
due to the possibility of increased expenses,
may have some negative impact on local

communities. Recognizing these factors, we
do not ask the Office of the President or the
Stanford Trademark and Licensing Office
to make any decisions without thorough
consideration and research. However, this
issue has been presented to the ASSU and
to University officials for several months
now. and we believe that the time is ap
proaching quickly when Stanford must
make a decision that will determine its com
placency with or vigilance against the injus
tices of sweatshop labor.
We feel that as students at one of the
leading academic institutions in the world,
we have a responsibility to educate our
selves about our global society and to take
proactive steps to resolve such issues of
moral injustice. Within the ASSU, we have
already begun to take measures to demon
strate our stance against the selling and en
dorsement of material made through
sweatshop labor. The Sweat-free Stanford
campaign has helped this campus and, more
specifically the ASSU's legislative bodies,
become educated on the serious issues re
garding the factory conditions of workers
who produce our clothing. This education
prompted the prudent consideration and
passage of a bill entitled "Ensuring Sweat-
I ree Labor in Lactones that Produce Stan
ford Collegiate Apparel" by both the Bth
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council. The bill, which has been
sent to the Office of the President, outlines
the steps that the student body feels are
necessary to prevent Stanford from indi
rectly sponsoring the use of sweatshop
labor. These steps, including the Universi
ty's membership in the Workers' Rights
Consortium and the Designated Suppliers
Program, are very similar to the practical
goals of the Sweat-free Stanford campaign
Additionally, the ASSU's financial
branch. Stanford Student Enterprises rec
ognizes the plight of factory workers
around the world who struggle to supply
vendors with the apparel th.it we buy and

wear every day. In response to this plight,
and in an effort to support the Sweat-free
Stanford eampaign. the Stanford Store will
continue to sell and increase its sourcing of
apparel produced in certified sweat-free
factories. Currently, the Stanford Store is
the only retail vendor on campus that car
lies and sells apparel produced in certified
sweat-free factories. Although American
Apparel is the only sweat-free vendor that
the Stanford Store currently stocks, we
hope to he able to expand the Store's sweat
free selection as new options arise in the fu
ture. However, such options are currently
sparse and unlikely to be established with
out administrative support for the Sweat
tree Movement. As a student-run business,
the Stanford Store seeks to do everything
possible to serve students, and we feel that
as representatives of our respective yet in
tegrated institutions, it is a privilege to do
what we can to support the student-driven
Sweat-free Stanford campaign.
As the highest-ranking elected repre
sentatives of and advocates for the Stan
ford student body, we present this letter as
a statement on its behalf. The despicable
means by which corporations and factory
owners use sweatshop labor as a source of
prolit is something of which we want no
part as the ASSU. and we feel the same way
about our beloved University. Hie time has
come to join our sister institutions and let
our opposition to sweatshop labor be
known. We wish the Office of the President
and the Stanford trademark and Licensing
Office the best in making their decision,
and we urge you to follow the lead of the
ASSI and Sweat-free Stanford campaign,
whose research, education and advocacy ef
forts seek to make Stanford a more pro
gressive and moral institution
