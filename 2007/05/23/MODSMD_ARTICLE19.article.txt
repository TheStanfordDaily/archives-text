### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Just two days removed from the
team's semifinal loss to UCLA. Stan
ford women's tennis begins individ
ual play at the NCAA Champi
onships. today in Athens. C ia.
The Cardinal, the No. 1 ranked
team for nearly the whole year, will
be represented by seniors Theresa
Logar and Anne Yelsey, junior Celia
Durkin. sophomore Jessica Nyugen
and freshman Lindsay Burdette in
the 64-person championship singles
bracket.
As for doubles action, Yelsey and
Burdette. the No. 21 tandem in the
country, received the only bid for the
32-team field.
Despite the team's heart-break
ing Monday loss to UCLA, which
ended Stanford's chance at a fourth
straight national title. Burdette said
that the Cardinal women look for
ward to proving themselves in the in
dividuals.
"It's a completely different tour
nament. with less pressure" she said.
"We'll definitely all be ready for indi
viduals."
Assistant coach Frankie Brennan
agreed, believing that the Cardinal's
4-2 semifinal loss may even produce
better individual results.
"1 think that sometimes when you
lose a national title, you come back to
individuals feeling more inspired," he

said.
The individual tournaments will
run up until next Monday; both
brackets are single-elimination style
with 64 entrants.
Match play begins this morning as
Logar faces Marshall's Kellie
Schmitt. Durkin goes up against
Eastern Michigan's Vanessa
Frankowski, Yelsey takes on Baylor's
Zuzana Zemenova, Nguyen plays
Wisconsin's C'aitlin Burke and Bur
dette battles Clemson's Ani Mijaci
ka.
Most of the Cardinal's opponents
are unknowns â€” none hail from any
where west of Texas.
In doubles, the combo of Yelsey
and Burdette will face Miami's Audra
Cohen and Laura Vallverdu, two
more familiar opponents. The two
duos competed in a heated 7-7 match
on Sunday in the NCAA Quarterfi
nals. The match was called off after
the Cardinal clinched the doubles
point through other victories, and
Stanford won 4-0.
Monday's UCLA loss put a dent
in Stanford's confidence, but the Car
dinal has little time to worry about
the past.
"We're just going to go out there
and sec if we can get an individual
championship for somebody," Bren
nan said.
