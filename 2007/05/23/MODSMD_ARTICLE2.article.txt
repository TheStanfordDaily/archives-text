## Housing finds no evidence of bug infestation Concerned residents suffer bites, but pest control says scare is unfounded 
### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
Caterpillars are not the only bug problem on campus
this spring. Several students living in Mirrielees have re
ported red bumps resembling flea bites in the past few
weeks, but University officials say there is no evidence
of any pests in the dorm at Escondido Rd. and Campus
Dr.
"At first I brushed them off as mosquito bites, but
then 1 started to think maybe they were something
else," said Mackenzie Cooper "07. "They definitely look
like flea bites, though 1 haven't had them diagnosed."
One junior, who was granted anonymity because of
the stigma attached to being infested with creepy
crawlers,originally thought that he had bed bug bites â€”
a not unlikely assumption considering the bed bugs that
were found earlier this year in Florence Moore Hall.
But after comparing his bites with Cooper's, he came to
the conclusion that the bites resemble those of small
mosquitoes. The bites are especially prevalent on stu
dents' ankles.
After receiving complaints from multiple students,
including one Resident Assistant, Mirrielees staff mem
bers notified Student Housing Monday night.
"As per our normal protocol, we asked Crane Pest
Control, a licensed, professional pest control manage
ment company, to visit the student's room and investi
gate the report," Imogen Hinds, associate director of
Student Housing, said in an email to The Daily. "Crane
found no evidence of fleas, other pests or other prob
lems in the room."
Vaden Health Center told Hinds that bug bite re
ports are common at this time of year, but that red
bumps can also be due to other allergic reactions. Ac
cording to Hinds, Vaden has not had any specific bug
related problems this quarter and was not aware of the
bug bites in Mirrielees.
