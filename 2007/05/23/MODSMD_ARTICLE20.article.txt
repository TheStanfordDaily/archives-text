# No team play, but Bruch, Muller move on
## After Card's absence from team NCAAs, Individuals begin 
### ELIZABETH PRATT 
The pinnacle of college tennis achieve
ment is the NCAA Championships, and
not just for teams. After Stanford men's
tennis was unable to qualify as a squad,
two Cardinal members ;ire starting the
NCAA Individual Championships today
— and the stakes are high.
"These are the best of the best; all the
best college players are here." assistant
coach David Hodge said. "This is the one
everyone wants to win."
Sophomore Matt Bruch will represent
Stanford in the singles competition, start
ing today. Bruch will also team with soph
omore Blake Muller to contend for the
doubles championship, which kicks oft to
morrow.
In singles. Bruch will take on Mississip
pi junior ErlingTveit, ranked No. 13 na
tionally. at 11:30 a.m. HST. A win would pit
him against Ohio State's Bryan Koniecko
or Vanderbilt's Ryan Preston in Thurs
day's second round.
He will be looking for revenge against
Tveit. wht) knocked him out of the second
round of last year's NCAA Champi
onships. 7-6,7-5.
According to Hodge, Bruch's elevated
mental game will help him in the rematch.
"His maturity level on court has really
improved." Hodge said. "Mentally, what
he's doing really well is handling adversity
a lot better."

In doubles, the No. 12 pair of Bruch and
Muller w ill square off against Nieolas Del
gado and Pedro Graber of Virginia Tech,
ranked No. 19 in the country. If the Cardi
nal duo defeats Delgado/Graber on
Thursday, it will advance to the Round of
16 on Friday.They would play either Dim
itar kutrovsky and Josh Zavala of Texas or
No. 9 Mariusz Adaniski and Todd Paul of
Wake Forest.
Despite the crowded field. I lodge likes
his team's chances to go all the way.
"If they combine with each other the

way they have been [throughout the sea
son], they're going to do really well," he
said. "We're expecting them to go deep
into the draw."
Hodge added that Bruch and Muller
have grown mentally as a pair this year. He
said they have a better understanding of
their individual strengths as doubles play
ers and how they complement each other.
"They're a little sharper with their
moves, and a lot more confident and ag
gressive." he said.
These assets have certainly helped

them in the current season. One of the
most successful doubles tandems in the
country, the duo posted a 16-3 overall
record,going 12-3 in dual matches and 5-0
against nationally ranked opponents.
Their spotless profile against ranked
teams includes victories over Duke's top
-10 team of Joey Atas and David Goulet
and UCLA's top-20 tandem of Benjamin
Kohlloeffel and Philipp Gruendler.
Bruch and Miller capped conference
play this season by claiming the Pac-10
doubles championship, defeating South
ern California's No. 43 Robert Farah and
KaesVan't Hofin the final to automatical
ly qualify for the NCAA's 32-team field.
"We've been playing pretty well all
year round, and nothing's really
changed." Muller said."Our goal is to win
it. Anything less, and I'll be a little disap
pointed."
Despite missing much of the 2006-2007
season due to injury. Bruch received an in
vitation to the singles championship on
the basis of his Pac-10 singles title. Beat
ing three nationally-ranked players in the
process, Bruch jumped from outside the
top 125 to No. 58 nationally.
Some years, wild cards into the main
draw of the U.S. ()pen are awarded to the
winners of the NCAA singles and doubles
championships.That enough would moti
vate many players to do their best. But for
Muller. it's all about bringing hack the
title and finishing the season right.
"You train hard and practice all year,
and this is where you want to be." Muller
said."l'm here to win it."
