# Steroids make muscle — and hypocrites
## 
### 
Remember the simple days of
sports? When every Mark McG
wire homer was a marvelous blast
en route to an amazing, record-breaking
season? When Barry Bonds was still a
skinny, ill-tempered five-tool player?
When Lance Armstrong was just a med
ical marvel excelling in a sport most Amer
icans knew nothing about?
Neither do I.
The saga of the athlete and perform
ance-enhancing drugs just keeps getting
stranger and stranger. Case in point: New
York Yankees' first baseman and desig
nated hitter Jason Giambi.
Giambi, as you may recall, made what
must have been one of the oddest apolo
gies in recorded human history back in
February of 2(K)5. when he told the media
he was sorry for various unnamed offens
es — presumably the use of illegal, per
formance-enhancing drugs. And while
there was initially some hand-wringing
and gnashing of teeth, the storm passed —

Giambi was free to be just another over
hyped. overpaid Yankees slugger.
Alter comments to USA Today last
Wednesday, though, that may no longer be
the case. (iiambi told the newspaper's Bob
Nightingale that he "was wrong for doing
that stuff." and interestingly enough, the
reaction would appear to be much more
problematic for him this time around.
Suddenly, rumors are swirling that the
Yankees are investigating whether this
"admission" gives the team the right to
void their underachieving star's contract.
While the initial reaction of those in the
know is that Giambi's truthfulness proba
bly won't void his contract, the very idea
sets a troubling precedent for baseball.
I low many times have you read an im
passioned plea begging those involved in
baseball's steroids scandal to just come
clean? Apologize, and all will be forgiven.
Or. at least it'll be a stall.
Maybe nowhere has that sentiment
been louder than in St. Louis, where, time

and again, I've heard the locals beg for
"Big Mac" to turn it all around. It he only
apologized, and dedicated himself to
working against the influence of perform
ance-enhancing drugs — mentoring
young athletes, and what not — then the
world would forgive him.
Or so those still swept up in the magic
of the summer of 1998 would have you be
lieve. They think that if only we could re
deem these men morally, we could redeem
their numbers as well. They're wrong, of
course, but they shouldn't worry.
The big, dirty secret baseball won't tell
you is that, ultimately, the numbers don't
matter. ITiat is. not the big, record-setting
ones.
Whether Barry Bonds hits 756 home
runs or I.(KX). I lank Aaron's mark of 755
will still be just as amazing as it ever was. as
will be Roger Maris' single-season total of
61.
But still, the fans want to sec redemp
tion. And whocan blame them?The whole

sports scene must have been a simpler
place when we were all able to bury our
heads in the sand and believe that the only
ones cheating were the Fast Germans. Or
maybe the Soviets. And Giambi's second,
non-specific apology, this time in USA
Today, felt like a first step down that road,
at least for him.
But the Yankees' owner, apparently,
feels differently.
Seeing the slightest possibility of escap
ing another bad contract. George Stein
brenner and the Yankees' brass have leapt
at the chance to use Giambi's words
against him.
The irony is staggering. Of all the
juicers of the modern era. Giambi has


Griffin
Rants and Raves
come the closest to addressing the
issue with any kind of sincere re
morse. And now his team is looking
to take advantage of it by cutting him
loose.
With the fans and media sending
one message on the steroids issue, but
owners and the league an entirely
different one, this scandal is increas
ingly looking like it has real staying
power. We're talking decades. In
2030, fans will still be debating how
we should weigh the juiced era

against the rest of baseball history,
and probably whether we've even
left it behind.
Of course, the individual team.the
Yankees in this case, wants to send
the message that it hasn't been a will
ing participant in the steroids era. I
think nearly every fan of baseball
harbors the secret hope that the play
ers on his or her favorite team are the
cleanest in the sport, succeeding on
an old-fashioned blend of grit and
talent, not a new-millennia cocktail
of HGH, greenies and equine
steroids.
But that's not the way to heal the
rift between the modern game and its
history. Instead, we need to come to
terms with two facts.

Fact one: We will never know who
was better than they should have
been over the last 20 years. And fact
two: The records of the present can't
diminish the accomplishments of the
past.
To do this, everyone had best start
assuming that their favorite players
and teams are no cleaner than every
one else's.
1 can't think of a worse person to
take the first step down that road
than Steinbrenner. But Georgie-boy,
it would seem that once again the ball
is in your court.

Denis Griffin lias no named offenses.

the message that it hasn't been a will
ing participant in the steroids era. I
think nearly every fan of baseball
harbors the secret hope that the play
ers on his or her favorite team are the
cleanest in the sport, succeeding on
an old-fashioned blend of grit and
talent, not a new-millennia cocktail
of HGH, greenies and equine
steroids.
But that's not the way to heal the
rift between the modern game and its
history. Instead, we need to come to
terms with two facts.

Fact one: We will never know who
was better than they should have
been over the last 20 years. And fact
two: The records of the present can't
diminish the accomplishments of the
past.
To do this, everyone had best start
assuming that their favorite players
and teams are no cleaner than every
one else's.
1 can't think of a worse person to
take the first step down that road
than Steinbrenner. But Georgie-boy,
it would seem that once again the ball
is in your court.
