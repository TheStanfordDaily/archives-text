# 13 lucky for baseball: 4-3 over UCD
## Sean Ratliff's drag bunt wins the game 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sean Ratliff got the sign from head coach Mark
Marquess before he was intentionally walked in the
bottom of the ninth: drag bunt. Ratliff finally got his
chance to execute —in the 13th inning —as the
sophomore's RBI single proved the winning run in
Stanford's wild 4-3 win over UC-Davis.
After he hit his team-leading 12th homerun.a solo
shot in the sixth inning, Ratliffs (2-6, 2 RBI) hard
bunt past the pitcher's mound and a head-first slide
into first finally ended Stanford's longest game of the
season four hours and 13 minutes after first pitch.
And even though there were two outs, the Cardi
nal knew it was the right call.
"I came back to the dugout after the ninth inning
and [Marquess] told me,'lf you [are up with a man on
third] again, we're going to call it,' because their in
field was playing back on the grass and they weren't
expecting it from me." Ratliff said. "We both knew
that if I got it down, I had a pretty good chance of
beating the throw."
The game started as a fast-moving pitchers' duel,
but turned into a tense, extra-innings marathon when
Stanford (25-28) tied the game at 3-3 on a wild pitch
from Aggie reliever Nick Aurora (0-3) that scored
sophomore pinch runner Jeff Whitlow from third in
the bottom of the ninth.
Junior David Stringer (2-2) pitched 5.2 innings of
scoreless relief for the win. shutting down UC-Davis
(22-31) after the eighth. Stringer allowed only three
hits and notched a season-high six strikeouts in one
week, after throwing seven innings of relief against
Santa Clara.
The righty ran into trouble in the top of the 12th
when the first two batters reached and moved into
scoring position on a sacrifice bunt. Stringer maneu
vered out of the jam by striking out Ryan Roysterand
inducing a groundout from Kevin James.
"I was definitely not going to get hurt on my worst
pitches," Stringer said. "I pretty much threw off
speed. off-speed, off-speed, show-nie fastball and
then went back off-speed. 1 think 1 got Royster on a
fastball that was quite a bit out of the zone, but you
hope [your best stuff] will get you through it.and it
did tonight."
Through the late innings. Stanford had its chances,
loading the bases in both the ninth
and the 12th. But junior Michael
Taylor fouled out on the first pitch
he saw in the ninth and sophomore
Cord Phelps hit a sharp groundball
that replacement first baseman
Grant Hirneise turned into a dou
ble play three innings later.
"(The double play] was a little
disappointing to say the least," Mar
quess said. "We had struggled all
night, and then [Phelps] gets a 2-0
count and he hit it hard. It's a tough
double play, but they made it."
Phelps held the lead at 3-2 in the
top of the ninth when he made an
acrobatic leaping grab that saved a
run. With Royster on third and one
out. Phelps was able to run down a
chopper, then jump, turning away
form the infield, to catch the ball be
fore looking back at Royster and
throwing to first for the out.
Both starters — sophomore
Austin Yount and Jeff Reeker —
started out hot. allowing only one

combined hit through the first three
innings.
Stanford finally took a 1-0 lead
off Reeker in the fourth when fresh
man Toby Gerhart scored on a field
er's choice grounder by junior
Adam Sorgi. With runners on the
corners, Sorgi's ball looked to be a
possible inning-ending double play,
but Daniel Descalso's throw was
high, forcing first baseman Evan
Hudson to jump off the bag.
Yount was perfect through four
innings, but the Aggies capitalized
on his first mistake when Aaron
Hanke (2-6, 2 RBI) tied the game
with a solo homerun on the first
pitch of the fifth inning. UC-Davis
would add another run in the sixth
on a two-out double by Descalso
that hit off first baseman Jason Cas
tro's glove.
The Aggies would add another
run in the eighth to take a 3-2 ad
vantage.
Stanford finishes the season 17-
15 at home and has a chance to
reach .500 with a sweep of Southern
California this weekend.
