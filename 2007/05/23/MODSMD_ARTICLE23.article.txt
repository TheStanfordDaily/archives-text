### ERIK ADAMS 
Stanford sailing hasn't raced since April, but it will
need to be at its best with one the biggest races of the
year on deck.The Cardinal starts competition today in
the 24-team Intercollegiate Sailing Association Na
tional Championships.
Running until June 1. the ICSAs consist of three
separate competitions; Stanford earned berths in two.
In the women's national championship, junior Evan
Brown and senior Joanna Madsen will represent the
Cardinal in the "A" division, while sophomore Taylor
Grimes and senior Katherine Schlosser compete in the
B" division.
Wrapping up the regatta is the coed national cham
pionship. where senior Brian I laines and sophomore
Kelly McKenna will race in the "A" division and senior
Emery Wager and freshman Leigh Hammel in the "B"
division.
"We are excited to get to sail against these other top
schools," Hammel said. "We have had a really good
season, especially on the West Coast. If we play our
game and avoid careless mistakes, we should do well."
Stanford will have to display endurance and team
work to take away either national title, as the competi
tions. hosted by C)ld Dominion and Navy, consist of up
to 36 small races, with scores combined across the "A"
and "B" divisions.
But the Cardinal has every reason to look ahead
with confidence. Prior to its month-long break. Stan
ford turned in two impressive regattas at the Pacific
Coast Championships to secure ICSA berths.
At the Women's Pacific Coast Championships in
San Francisco on Apr. 24. Stanford was simply domi
nant. Brown and Madsen were solid in the "A" division
and Grimes and Schlosser widened the gap between
the champion Cardinal and runner-up IJC-Irvine by
finishing first in 10 of their 14" B" di
vision races.
One week later, the Cardinal
headed west to the Team Racing
and Coed Dinghy PCCsat Hawaii's
Keehi Lagoon. The team racers
narrowly missed securing a third
bid at the ICSAs, losing on
tiebreakers to Southern California,
but the coeds were in total control,
holding a 24-point lead after the
first day that later grew into a 44-
point final margin.
"We had to win at the PCCs [to
secure a berth at thedCSAs) and we
consistently did very well in our
races," 1 iammel said. "It was a good
confidence boost for us."
With the momentum of these vic
tories filling its sails, the Stanford
team now hopes to follow through
and bring a title back home to the
Farm.
