## Sweat-Free Coalition spearheads sit-in, naked rally, vigil and protests 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Eleven students were arrested late yesterday after
noon outside of President John Hennessy's office after
they participated in a five-hour sit-in to protest what
they allege is the University's refusal to join organiza
tions that would curb sweatshop labor in factories that

produce Stanford apparel.
The students were cited for trespassing and taken
away in plastic handcuffs after they refused to leave the
lobby of the president's office when it closed for the day.
As police escorted the protesters out of the building,
about 35 onlookers chanted in support.
"We are shocked and disappointed that the Universi
ty has chosen to do this to its students," said Bethany
Woolman 'O l )."but we are prepared to deal with the con
sequences."
The protesters, including Woolman, stormed Hen
nessy's office at 11:30 a.m. Although the office usually
closes at 5 p.m., I lennessy's office closed at 4:15 p.m. yes
terday. Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to Hennessy, said

that management was trying to compensate for the of
fice's lost lunch break, which was due to the protest.The
protestors were arrested and taken to the Stanford po
lice station at 4:30 p.m., where they were held for 90 min
utes before being released around 6 p.m.
Katie Frank '09, one of the students arrested, said the
police were sympathetic and generally friendly.
University officials questioned the timing of the
protest, which came a week before Hennessy had of
fered to meet with group leaders.
"I don't completely get why now," said Wachtel in an
interview with 'ITie Daily after the arrests. "Preisdent

Sweat-free protestors Phil Narodick and Bradley Heinz bare their activist souls, and everything else, during yesterday afternoon's clothing optional rally in White Plaza.
Hennessy indicated that he wanted
to work with them and was ready to
meet with the students as soon as his
schedule opened up."
" This is an important issue," he
added,"but there have been other is
sues that the University is involved
with and students may not realize
that it takes time."
Woolman confirmed that the
group had been invited to meet on
May 29, but she said the group de
clined the request.
"We don't need any more meet
ings," she said. "They have all the in
formation they need from us. Today
we were asking for a response."
One of the protest's organizers,
Daniel Shih '09, said the administra
tion ignored the coalition through
the day.
"None of the administration has
met with us all day."he said." They all
said they were too busy."
Wachtel said that Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers had spent the
day addressing student concerns.

Protestors said police told them
that the penalty for the misde
meanor is up to a $500 fine or three
months in jail. 11 the Santa Clara
County district attorney's office de
cides to press charges, their court
date is set for July 10.
The Sweat-Free Coalition has
been trying to persuade the Univer
sity to join the Workers Rights Con
sortium (WRC) and the Designated
Suppliers Program (DSP), two or
ganizations which, they say, would
cut down on apparent sweatshop
labor overseas.
Wachtel said the administration
shares some of the activists' goals
and objectives,but they are weighing
a variety of options.
" Ihe odd thing is that we agree
that we don't want people working in
factories to be treated unfairly,"
Wachtel said. "Some believe the
WRC and the DSP are the ways to
respond, but we haven't come to the
same conclusion."
I le added that the University was
considering other options.
"Some of the organizations that
are being considered may have con
sequences and we are trying to think
that through," he said. "It's a com
plex issue and it's not as simple to

just join.
Shih said the end result of the
protest was not what the coalition
liad envisioned, but that members
felt compelled to take action be
cause of what they said was the Uni
versity's reluctance to make conces
sions.
"It didn't end the way we wanted
it to," he said. "We came in wanting
one thing, to join the WRC and DSP.
But we are not going to give up be
cause President 1 lennessy needs to
understand that it is not okay to ar
rest students for standing up for what
they believe in."
"We fundamentally must fight
this cause," he added. "We refuse to
compromise."
University officials, however, said
the students' unwillingness to com
promise evidenced by yesterday's
protest was a step backwards for
their cause.
"There was no compromise posi
tion on their part," Wachtel said.
"They didn't want to hear what Pres
ident I lennessy had to say next week
on what his proposal would be."
Although the protesters called
their demonstration an act of civil
disobedience, administrators said
the students' actions were inappro

priate. Wachtel said the students
brought kitty litter to the president's
office with the intent to defecate in
front of Hennessy's receptionists.
"They say they are peaceful and
civil, but that was not a civil or re
spectful action." Wachtel said."'l"hey
had no business in here so we were
not going to allow them to use the
bathroom."
Although the protestors admitted
to bringing kitty litter with them,
they said no one used it. Woolman
said she was told she could not use
the restroom in the office because it
was private property, and that if she
left to use the outside restrooms. she
would not be allowed back inside.
"We brought the kitty litter in
case we were in there for days," she
said. "No one defecated in the
room."
