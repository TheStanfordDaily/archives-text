## Illegal Internet users to face fines Policy aims to stem surge in copyright violations 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students who enjoy downloading
copyrighted music and movies: take
heed.
The University has put you on
warning that violating the copyright
regulations outlined in the 1998
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) will cost you.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman announced last
week that anyone on the Universi
ty's network who is caught violating
the rules will need to pay a fee to get
their Internet connection reinstat
ed.
The new policy, set to go into ef
fect on Sept. 1, will carry fees of
$1(X), $500 and $1,000 for first, sec
ond or third complaints, respective
ly. The new progressive fines are ap
parently intended to defray the
costs of dealing with an increasing
number of complaints about stu
dents engaging in illegal file sharing
or downloading.
First-time copyright violators
can avoid getting their Internet dis
connected if they contact the Infor
mation Security Office (ISO) within
48 hours of receiving the complaint
and if they can demonstrate that
they have corrected the concerns
raised by the complaint, which usu

ally involves removing the copy
righted material.
Students who fail to contact ISO
within 48 hours, however, will be
subjected to the new $100 fee if they
choose to renew their Internet.
A second complaint will carry an
automatic Internet service discon
nection and will require the offend
er to speak to his residence dean, in
addition to paying $500 for a recon
nection. Students who receive a
third complaint will have their In
ternet service permanently discon
nected and must apply for a new In
ternet service account while facing a
possible referral to Judicial Affairs.
While the new service requests
are usually granted provided the
student accepts responsibility for
future copyright infringements,
three-time offenders will have to
pay $1,000 to reconnect under the

new policy.
Senior University Counsel Lau
ren Schoenthaler explained that the
DMCA forces the University to
meet certain obligations as an Inter
net service provider (ISP) in order to
avoid being liable for copyright vio
lations by Stanford Internet users.
"The DMCA does a bunch of
things." she said. "One of the things
it does is it allows copyright owners
or their agents to scan Internet traf
fic. And then, having identified their
copyright content being shared
across the Internet, they can track
that IP address and identify the In
ternet service provider of that IP
address, and then they can send
what is called a DMCA complaint."
According to Schoenthaler, the
University incurs tremendous man
power costs in processing each com
plaint.
"It takes between 15 minutes
and two hours to process a single
first time DMCA complaint; it takes
additional time to disconnect and
reconnect an individual to the In
ternet." she wrote in an email to The
Daily. " Hie Information Security
Office reports that by the time a stu
dent has received three DMCA
complaints and is referred to Judi
cial Affairs, there has been between
75 and 200 hours of collective staff
time spent on the matter."
And it seems the number of
DMCA complaints is on the rise, ac
cording to Schoenthaler.
"The number of DMCA com
plaints has increased significantly
this academic year." she wrote. "In
the first four months of this academ

ic year, we received nearly as many
DMCA complaints as we did for the
entire *05-'O6 academic year."
Boardman hopes that the fees
will both cover the University's
costs and lower the rate of copy
right piracy amongst Stanford net
work users.
"We have attempted to advise
students about the serious conse
quences that can result from illegal
distribution of copyrighted materi
als," he wrote in an email to The
Daily."However. Stanford has been
named one the top 25 offenders
[among universities] by the Motion
Picture Association of America,
and we continue to have a steep in
crease in the number of piracy com
plaints filed against us by the
Recording Industry Association of
America."
Schoenthaler was quick to reas
sure students, however, that they
will not be penalized for unjustified
or invalid DMCA complaints.
"The ISO has the power to waive
the reconnection fee,"she said."lt is
very rare for students to disagree
with the content of a DMCA com
plaint. But when it happens, we take
it very seriously. So 1 don't want
there to be this view out there in the
world that Stanford is trying to
profit from mistaken DMCA com
plaints."
Will Laves '07. who received a
DMCA notice a month ago for
downloading a movie, said he felt
that the policy changes were justi
fied.
"The $100 initial fine, 1 feel they
need to publicize more," he said.
"But for the $500 fine. I really feel
that because you've already gotten
one notice, it just makes sense."
