## Illegal Internet users to face fines Policy aims to stem surge in copyright violations

Students who enjoy downloading
copyrighted music and movies: take
heed.
The University has put you on
warning that violating the copyright
regulations outlined in the 1998
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) will cost you.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman announced last
week that anyone on the Universi
ty's network who is caught violating
the rules will need to pay a fee to get
their Internet connection reinstat

The new policy, set to go into ef

$1(X), $500 and $1,000 for first, sec

costs of dealing with an increasing
number of complaints about stu
dents engaging in illegal file sharing
or downloading.
First-time copyright violators
can avoid getting their Internet dis
connected if they contact the Infor
mation Security Office (ISO) within
48 hours of receiving the complaint
and if they can demonstrate that
they have corrected the concerns
raised by the complaint, which usu

righted material.
Students who fail to contact ISO
within 48 hours, however, will be
subjected to the new $100 fee if they
choose to renew their Internet.
A second complaint will carry an
automatic Internet service discon
nection and will require the offend
er to speak to his residence dean, in
addition to paying $500 for a recon
nection. Students who receive a
third complaint will have their In
ternet service permanently discon
nected and must apply for a new In
ternet service account while facing a
possible referral to Judicial Affairs.
While the new service requests
are usually granted provided the
student accepts responsibility for
future copyright infringements,
three-time offenders will have to
pay $1,000 to reconnect under the
