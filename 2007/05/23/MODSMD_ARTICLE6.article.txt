### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ASSU Senators expressed anger and frustration
at their meeting last night about the arrests of 11 stu
dents— all members of the Stanford Sweat-Free
Coalition — who participated in a five-hour sit-in at
President John liennessy's office to protest what

they believe is the University's reluctance to restrict
sweatshop labor in factories that produce apparel
(hat bears the Stanford name.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 introduced the
sweat-free issue by reading a prepared statement in
which he expressed both "great pride and great
anger" for the protest.
"Pride is an understatement for how I feel about
the 11 brave students who would not take no" for an
answer, and sat in peaceful protest in Building 10."
Cordova said.

ASSU Senator Patrick Cordova '09 condemned the University for ordering the arrests of 11 Sweat-Free Coali
tion protestors and lauded the student activists for their courage of conviction.
He commended the students for
sacrificing their time and their class
es in what he called an "extremely
peaceful but powerful" protest. He
then condemned the University for
its "despicable" response.
"1 call for the immediate release
of these peaceful protestors, as well
as an apology by the president of
this University as well as immediate
action on reform measures that
focus on moving Stanford in a
sweat-free direction," Cordova said.
He called on senators to boycott
the Bookstore's apparel sales, to at
tend the sweat-free vigil that took
place in White Plaza after the meet
ing and to "give thanks to those who
have been arrested,coordinated this
effort or volunteered their time."
Senator Sarah Golabek-Gold
man 10, chair of the Campus Advo
cacy Committee, echoed Cordova's
concerns.
"Many students, including my
self. were angered and shocked by
the arrests of our peers," Golabek-

Goldman said."ln the next few days,
I will he in contact with President
I lennessy's office and the leaders of
the sweat-free Stanford campaign.
The Advocacy Committee of the
ASSII must facilitate effective com
munication between the administra
tion and students so that the cam
paign's specific goals can he met."
The second half of the meeting
centered around the concerns of
Senator Luukas lives '09, who said
he had questions about the selection
of the new Elections Commission.
lives was concerned that the se
lection process violated a "separa
tion of powers." Specifically, he was
worried by the fact that Vice Presi
dent Mondaire Jones '09 was the
Senate representative in the Elec
tions Officer Selection Committee.
"It was not clear that there was
adequate separation of powers be
tween the executive and the legisla
ture. and that the legislature had
proper input," lives said.
Elections C o m m iss ione r
Bernard Fraga '08 said that Jones
was the only outgoing senator who
expressed interest in filling the posi
tion.
lives was also disturbed that all
four members of the selection com

mittee were affiliated with the Stu
dents of Color Coaltion (SOCC), a
comment that irritated many of his
colleagues.
"I'm not saying that there was
any impropriety in selection," lives
said,"but the fact that all four mem
bers of the selection committee who
selected candidates were of the
same political background at least
creates potential appearance of im
propriety."
He called for a more "open and
transparent" selection process in the
future.
An icy Fraga offered a facetious
reply.
"In regards to the comment
about some of the people on the se
lections committee having been en
dorsed by SOCC" Fraga said. "1
would also point out that there were
only two women on the selections
committee. There were more fuzzies
than techies. We couldn't represent
every major equally, but the com
mittee as a whole should try to rep
resent the interests of the combined
student body thoroughly and equal
ly, and 1 think we did that."
