ASSU Senators expressed anger and frustration
at their meeting last night about the arrests of 11 stu
dents— all members of the Stanford Sweat-Free
Coalition — who participated in a five-hour sit-in at
President John liennessy's office to protest what

they believe is the University's reluctance to restrict
sweatshop labor in factories that produce apparel
(hat bears the Stanford name.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 introduced the
sweat-free issue by reading a prepared statement in
which he expressed both "great pride and great
anger" for the protest.
"Pride is an understatement for how I feel about
the 11 brave students who would not take no" for an
answer, and sat in peaceful protest in Building 10."
Cordova said.
