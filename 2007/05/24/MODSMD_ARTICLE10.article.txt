The Editor.Sir:
According to your editorial in last night?s paper, the lat
est idea is to have competition between two parties in stu
dent body elections. One party is to be your Liberal Party,
and the other. I suppose, would be in opposition to it.'lTie
aims and ideals of the Liberal Party can hardly be im
peached; they sound all right, and are apparently altruistic.
But what, pray, could another '.'party? advocate? We have
no questions of party or legislative policies to wrangle
about on the campus. If the students were to express opin
ions on such questions as Prohibition, reduction of income
tax, [or] protective tariff, your suggestion might have some
merit. But they don?t. And any party organized on this cam
pus would necessarily subscribe to the same lofty opinions
as the Liberal Party expresses.
I think it would be a good idea if we would forget about
this '.'party? business, and consider those running for office
solely from the point of view of personal qualifications. Stu
dents aren?t going to be interested in what party a candi
date belongs to; they will be interested in the candidate
himself.
â€” Orion F. Clark.
