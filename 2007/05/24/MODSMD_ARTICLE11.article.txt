WHO passes agreement to combat yellow fever in West Africa

Last Wednesday in Geneva, the
World Health Organization (WHO)
passed through its assembly a new ini
tiative to combat yellow fever in West
Africa. Twelve West African states will
receive a combined total of $58 million
for the vaccination of their citizens
against the illness, with the bulk of the
aid going to Mali. Guinea. Senegal,
Togo, the Ivory Coast and Liberia. The
initiative, presented to the WHO dur
ing its annual meeting on the May 16.
was sponsored by the Global Alliance
for Vaccines and Immunization
(GAVI) and will provide a stock of 11
million doses of vaccine, saving an esti
mated total of 48 million lives from the
often fatal hemorrhagic fever.
G AVI is an organization which aims
to increase access to vaccines for the
children of the world's poorest coun
tries. In collaboration with the WHO.
The World Bank, UNICEF. the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation and the
governments of many different coun
tries. GAVl's ultimate goal is to pro
vide all of the world's children with the
vaccine treatments that are taken for
granted in the industrialized world.
Because such treatments are not avail
able in the world's most impoverished
states, two to three million children
will die from vaccine-preventable dis
eases out of the 130 million that are
born each year. The yellow fever vac
cine, which costs 88 dollars at Stan
ford's Vaden Health Center, is too ex
pensive for the poor states of West
Africa to stockpile, but the vaccines
that GAVI will send to the region were
acquired at 60 cents per dose through
the cooperation of pharmaceutical
companies.
According to the WH0,33 countries
and 508 million people are at risk of
contracting yellow fever in the African
continent. More are at risk in South
America and the Caribbean. The virus,
which is transmitted by certain species
of the Aedcs mosquito that are com
monly found in tropical areas, incu
bates in a host for three to six days be
fore an infected person becomes symp
tomatic. Symptoms include fever, mus
cle pain and ' black vomiting" caused
by the presence of blood products.
Jaundice also occurs, which is the
source of the illness's name, "yellow

fever." In fatal cases, kidney function
deteriorates or fails utterly, and pa
tients die within 10 to 14 days. Rough
ly 15 percent of yellow fever infections
result in death; there are an estimated
200,000 cases of the disease each year,
30.000 of which are fatal.
An effective vaccine for the disease,
which requires boosters every 10 years,
has been available for more than 60
years, and the disease has been eradi
cated in much of the world. In the last
decades of French colonialism in West
Africa, a massive vaccination campaign
effectively eliminated the threat of yel
low fever in the region. Yet in the years
since independence, many West African
governments have found themselves in
capable of maintaining the programs.
In the last 20 years, the virus has spread
geographically and has infected more
people. Although some epidemics have
been cut short — as in Gambia in 1979
the general trend has been an in
crease in the incidence of yellow fever.
I"he region continues to face many
other challenges, including other vac
cine-preventable diseases, poverty, po
litical instability and corruption. Re
cently the UN reported on fraud in or
phanages in the nation of Liberia,
where thousands of children who are
not in fact orphans are being held in
order to draw international relief
funds from charitable donors. Liberia's
new president, ' Iron Grandmother"
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, has indicated
that corruption will be the major target
of her administration. President John
son-Sirleaf. who is the first elected fe
male head of state in the history of the
African continent and the first elected
leader of the country since the end of a
civil war in 2003, took power in Janu
ary of 2006. She is a veteran of the
West African political scene; impris
oned in the 1980s for her criticisms of
the ruling military regime, Johnson-
Sirleaf also managed African affairs at
the United Nations Development Pro
gram. Although male-dominated tra
ditions persist in the rural parts of
Liberia, many of the nation's urban
and educated voters enthusiastically
endorsed Johnson-Sirleaf's bid for of
fice. Some expressed the view that
Liberians "need a woman to put things
right" after years of brutal civil war.

For her part. President Johnson-Sirleaf
has pledged to encourage women from
across Africa to run for political office,
and. under her stewardship, fully 20
percent of the country's new police re
cruits are women.
