promise plan that restricts government
agencies' use of eminent domain to ac
quire property was signed into law
Wednesday by Nevada Gov. Jim Gib
bons.
Supporters of the compromise say
ABIO2 provides strong protections
against government abuses of eminent
domain powers while still providing the
option for large public works, such as
transportation projects.
ABIO2 has the same provisions as
AJR3. but will take effect immediately.
AJR3 is a proposed constitutional
amendment, and will have to be ap
proved again by the 2009 Legislature be
fore advancing to a statewide vote in
2010.

improvement over last year's Question

the Taking of our Land or PISTOL by its

Nev. governor Gibbons rolls back eminent domain

supporters. Along with establishing its
own protections in eminent domain
cases, AJR3 would supersede PISTOL if
approved by voters.
PISTOL was one of several initia
tives affecting property rights around
the country bankrolled by Howie
Rich, a New York real estate investor
with ties to libertarian groups. The ini
tiative goes further than the two leg
islative proposals, mandating the high
est possible payments for blighted land
that can be taken through eminent do
main.
Lawmakers who pushed the compro
mise say it includes more evenhanded
terms for valuing property, agreed to by
both government lawyers and PISTOL
supporters. The compromise also allows
state officials 15 years to complete proj
ects on land taken under eminent do
main. instead of the five years allowed
under PISTOL.
