A photo on the cover of yester
day's Daily pictured Phil Narodick
'08 and Bradley Heinz 'OS above the
headline "11 arrested in Hennessy's
office" with a caption that said the
two "hare their activist souls, and
everything else" in the Tuesday rally
against sweatshop labor. ITie place
ment of the photo should not have
implied that either student pictured
was arrested for sitting in at President
John 1 lennessy's office. Neither was
involved with the sit-in. Additionally.
Narodick insists that he was not com
pletely naked during the protest.
