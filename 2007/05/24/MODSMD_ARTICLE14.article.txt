## Editorial Board Plan Pub Night Better 
### 
Long lines, an overcrowded venue,
and general miscommunication
turned one of the last senior social
events of the year into a hotbed of frus
trated upperclassmen and annoyed grad
uate students. Throw into the mix young
alumni — many who work in the area
were also invited — and it's no surprise
that the conditions in Nola's and Old Pro,
hardly massive establishments, were less
than ideal. Last Thursday's '"pub night"
disaster underscores major flaws in the
planning of social events over the year, es
pecially in regards to the relationship be
tween the undergraduate and graduate
communities and their respective leader
ship.
On Thursday, both Senior Night and
the newly approved Graduate Pub Night
were held at the same location, causing
anger and irritation among a multitude of
students.The fact that organizers planned
both events at the same venue seemingly
fell through the cracks. The subsequent
lack of communication goes to show that
the divide between the undergraduates
and graduates can potentially hinder the
goals of both communities.
For seniors, it was especially disap
pointing that one of the last Senior Nights
of the year was a casualty of poor plan

ning. While Senior Night organizers can
not be blamed entirely for last Thursday's
problems, the event still reflects the qual
ity of Senior Nights over the entire year,
which can be characterized as mediocre at
best.
Additionally, the Graduate Pub Night
organizers should have been more vigi
lant and checked with Senior Night offi
cials. as Senior Night is a far more estab
lished tradition. Ironically, in a May 3
Daily article, a member of the Graduate
Student Council quoted as joking that
they would avoid hosting their Graduate
Pub Night at the same place as Senior
Night: the idea of combining both events
was not seriously contemplated. It's clear,
then, that the joint pub night was an en
tirely avoidable oversight rather than, say,
an impromptu decision to mix the gradu
ate and undergraduate communities.
The leaders of these two communities
should work together towards strength
ened lines of communication and in
creased cooperation to avoid snafus like
this in the future. When it comes to pub
night, most students are not asking for
much — they just want to meet up with
old friends and have a good time, and bet
ter planning would go a long way towards
providing that.
