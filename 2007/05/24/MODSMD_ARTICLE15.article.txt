# You'd think funny was on the Y Chromosome
## 
### 
Sarah's trip into town got me think
ing: there really aren't that many fe
male stand-ups. I'll give you Mar
garet ( ho. Ellen Degeneres and Wanda
Sykes. 1 can't think of a super-star movie
actor female counterpoint to Ben Stiller.
Adam Sandler or Will Farrell, though. I
suppose Molly Shannon was a superb
Mary Katherine Gallagher, but "Super
star" doesn't have the same clout as "Old
School" or "Zoolander." Roseanne is the
only long-running successful show I can
think of that starred a woman, while "Se
infeld." "Everybody Loves Raymond."
"Curb Your Enthusiasm," "King of
Queens." "Da Ali G Show," "Chapelle's
Show." "The Colbert Report," "The Daily
Show" and "Scrubs" all rack up points for
Team I'm-A-Man.The ladies can claim "1
Love Lucy," although to reach as far back
as the pre-i Phone medieval ages of black
and-white television to find a female
comedic lead is a testament to their rarity.
What's the deal? You'd think that
tunny grew on the Y-chromosome. I guess
along with boobs, baby-making potential
and sensitivity, estrogen also gives us bad
timing, poor delivery and a serious, sober
ing outlook on life. Are women really not
funny? I've grown weary of male-heavy
casts and male-centric jokes. The only
balls I want to see are named Lucille.
It you ask a woman what she is looking
for in a man. the number one adjective she
offers is "funny" — women want a man
who can make them laugh. If you ask a
man what he is looking for in the opposite
sex. he will, in oh-too-typical man-fash
ion, want a slammin' hot babe. He also will
say, in case his mother or current girl
triend is around, that someone smart and
confident would be okay too. Fourth on
the man s list, after he makes sure she has
well-shaped boobs and is literate, is "sense
of humor.' Perhaps more striking than the
discrepancy placed on the importance of
humor in the opposite sex is the semantics
men and women use to describe it. Men
didn't say they wanted a funny woman —
rather, they want a woman with a good
sense of humor. GSOH (as it is. amazing
ly, referred to in personal ads) when trans
lated from man-code into E:nglish means
men want someone to laugh at their jokes,
which translated back into man-code
means they want a girl who can give their
man-egos a bellv-laughing boost.
In fact, in sociological studies on
humor and partner attractiveness, both
sexes tend to think of men as "humor gen
erators" and of women as "humor appre
ciators." While women place equal impor
tance on humor production and apprecia
tion in their partners, men overwhelming
ly look for a partner who is receptive to
their humor and do not emphasize a need
for female humor generation. In studies
on flirting, the amount a woman laughs di
rectly correlates to her interest in the po
tential mate. There is no relationship,
however, between how often a man laughs
when he is with a woman and his interest
level, which I guess means either men pre

ter smiling, like to laugh at their own
jokes, or that just because a woman is
tunny doesn't necessarily mean he will
like her more than Solemn Sally. She
could he cracking jokes like they were
eggs for an omelet, but. unless she's mak
ing him one in black heels, fishnets and a
cleavage-o-plenty dress (perhaps my male
stereotyping has gone too far?), he's not
sure he's sold.
And yet there us women-folk are,
swooning a little bit more with every pun,
exaggerated eyebrow lift and Borat refer
ence.
Why aren't men looking for a girl
who's funny? Why aren't there more suc
cessful funny women? I think a large part
of the reason is that both sexes perceive
humor as something masculine and that a
funny woman is often equated with some
one who is too aggressive, sardonic or neg
ative. If she is sarcastic, she's a bitch. If
she's silly, she's a ditz, not a woman you'd
want to date. Also, men have a taboo-less,
free reign on material while there is still
subject matter that is off-limits to women.
Chris Rock can talk about how much he
masturbates, but if a woman were to
broach the same topic, I doubt it would be
anywhere near as well-received, especial
ly by male viewers. Also, men modify cuss
words with cusswords, but an expletive
talking female comedian is seen as gruffly
mannish and harsh.
I don't mean to suggest women need to
drop f-bombs and talk about sex to be
funny — God knows non-penis-oriented
humor exists in this world. Before women
can catch up in TV shows and the movies,
however, I think there will first need to be
a humor revolution. I wait in hopeful an
ticipation for the day when women create
laughter as much as respond to it and men
fully listen to, enjoy and appreciate funny
women just as much as their female coun
terpoints have been doing for years.
Along with owning land, voting and
serving in the military, the privilege men
enjoy as perceived humor generators will
hopefully become a laughably quaint and
absurd tradition of old.
And. granted, things are changing al
ready. Woman's suffrage worked out. and

Baby Bell cheese on the MemAud stage

for us yet in this mixed-up world of ours.

who can make them laugh. If you ask a
man what he is looking for in the opposite
sex. he will, in oh-too-typical man-fash
ion, want a slammin' hot babe. He also will
say, in case his mother or current girl
triend is around, that someone smart and
confident would be okay too. Fourth on
the man s list, after he makes sure she has
well-shaped boobs and is literate, is "sense
of humor.' Perhaps more striking than the
discrepancy placed on the importance of
humor in the opposite sex is the semantics
men and women use to describe it. Men
didn't say they wanted a funny woman —
rather, they want a woman with a good
sense of humor. GSOH (as it is. amazing
ly, referred to in personal ads) when trans
lated from man-code into E:nglish means
men want someone to laugh at their jokes,
which translated back into man-code
means they want a girl who can give their
man-egos a bellv-laughing boost.
In fact, in sociological studies on
humor and partner attractiveness, both
sexes tend to think of men as "humor gen
erators" and of women as "humor appre
ciators." While women place equal impor
tance on humor production and apprecia
tion in their partners, men overwhelming
ly look for a partner who is receptive to
their humor and do not emphasize a need
for female humor generation. In studies
on flirting, the amount a woman laughs di
rectly correlates to her interest in the po
tential mate. There is no relationship,
however, between how often a man laughs
when he is with a woman and his interest
level, which I guess means either men pre

ter smiling, like to laugh at their own
jokes, or that just because a woman is
tunny doesn't necessarily mean he will
like her more than Solemn Sally. She
could he cracking jokes like they were
eggs for an omelet, but. unless she's mak
ing him one in black heels, fishnets and a
cleavage-o-plenty dress (perhaps my male
stereotyping has gone too far?), he's not
sure he's sold.
And yet there us women-folk are,
swooning a little bit more with every pun,
exaggerated eyebrow lift and Borat refer
ence.
Why aren't men looking for a girl
who's funny? Why aren't there more suc
cessful funny women? I think a large part
of the reason is that both sexes perceive
humor as something masculine and that a
funny woman is often equated with some
one who is too aggressive, sardonic or neg
ative. If she is sarcastic, she's a bitch. If
she's silly, she's a ditz, not a woman you'd
want to date. Also, men have a taboo-less,
free reign on material while there is still
subject matter that is off-limits to women.
Chris Rock can talk about how much he
masturbates, but if a woman were to
broach the same topic, I doubt it would be
anywhere near as well-received, especial
ly by male viewers. Also, men modify cuss
words with cusswords, but an expletive
talking female comedian is seen as gruffly
mannish and harsh.
I don't mean to suggest women need to
drop f-bombs and talk about sex to be
funny — God knows non-penis-oriented
humor exists in this world. Before women
can catch up in TV shows and the movies,
however, I think there will first need to be
a humor revolution. I wait in hopeful an
ticipation for the day when women create
laughter as much as respond to it and men
fully listen to, enjoy and appreciate funny
women just as much as their female coun
terpoints have been doing for years.
Along with owning land, voting and
serving in the military, the privilege men
enjoy as perceived humor generators will
hopefully become a laughably quaint and
absurd tradition of old.
And. granted, things are changing al
ready. Woman's suffrage worked out. and
1 did see Sarah Silverman make love to
Baby Bell cheese on the MemAud stage
this past weekend. Perhaps there is hope
for us yet in this mixed-up world of ours.

Katie knows it's ironic that she is a woman
trying to write a comedic column about un
derappreciated female humorists. If you
