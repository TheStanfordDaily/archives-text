People may not realize this,but I'm very
popular in some parts of the world. In
fact. Holt's Harangue, translated into
Thai, is apparently very, very funny. And
popular. 1 receive royalty checks galore from
many countries that are so poor they lack
vowels and their checks are made out in for
eign currency like waffles instead of Ameri
can dollars. The point is, Holt's Harangue as
an enterprise is a moneymaker.
So I began licensing. 1 thought, oh what
the-hey, why not have a clothing line? That
was after the perfume line; my publicist as
sured me that many famous authors had
their own scents, and Dave Barry's cologne
was very popular in Mozambique. Who
knew?
I'm not here today to talk to you about
my immense success abroad or my (in my
opinion) unjustifiable unpopularity here. In
stead. I want to talk to you about why Stan
ford must not be sweat-free.
You see. I have some experience in this
matter. My clothing line is made in Malaysia,
making it both technically made in America
and ensuring the labor is dirt cheap. My for
mer roommate, now heading up my New
York division, has assured me that it's prac
tically criminal how much we pay these peo
ple, but not criminal enough for me to ever

he convicted in a court of law. You never can
tell when he's joking after he's got bourbon
in him.
So here's the rub: apparently, some of the
Holt's Harangue brand lobster bibs are not
"sweat-free." I haven't visited the site exact
ly because 1 don't tan well, but let's just say
I've been assured that everyone is fully em
bodying the Protestant work ethic, those lit
tle godless heathens.
Personally, like Stanford, 1 don't want to
be sweat-free. I think workers should be
sweating a bit to get the work done, or else
it's too shoddily crafted to be marketable. 1
mean, if they aren't exerting effort, the qual
ity will resemble those prizes you win at car
nivals or Tara Reid's breasts.
If the work is truly sweat-free then it's
probably done by robots. Is that what Stan

ford and the world wants, robots taking over
good jobs provided by American-like peo
ples? In my opinion, there is something sim
ply more personal and heartwarming about
knowing that an eigh-year-old personally
crafted your Holt's Harangue brand mini
skirt (very popular item in Japan, from what
I've been told).
Now Stanford is being pressed by persons
from the Sweat Free Coalition to mend its
ways. Stanford, don't wuss out on me. Seri
ously. You guys and Nike are the only com
panies in the world still holding out. 112 know,
it's hard not to cave. I mean, you have the
student government, faculty members and
naked hippies all pleading for change. It's
hard not to listen to people who are willing
to come at you with kitty litter. Or whose
protests break down because nature calls. Or
who can't wait another week to go to a
scheduled meeting.
But in my humble opinion.no matter how
many students protest, you shouldn't listen.
At Holt s Harangue, Inc., we have a policy of
throwing people in sacks with rabid badgers
any time they question our labor policy. I en
courage you to take a similar approach next
time the students break out of their pre-des-
