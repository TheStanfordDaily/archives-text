# A 						modest proposal

### 
People may not realize this,but I'm very
popular in some parts of the world. In
fact. Holt's Harangue, translated into
Thai, is apparently very, very funny. And
popular. 1 receive royalty checks galore from
many countries that are so poor they lack
vowels and their checks are made out in for
eign currency like waffles instead of Ameri
can dollars. The point is, Holt's Harangue as
an enterprise is a moneymaker.
So I began licensing. 1 thought, oh what
the-hey, why not have a clothing line? That
was after the perfume line; my publicist as
sured me that many famous authors had
their own scents, and Dave Barry's cologne
was very popular in Mozambique. Who
knew?
I'm not here today to talk to you about
my immense success abroad or my (in my
opinion) unjustifiable unpopularity here. In
stead. I want to talk to you about why Stan
ford must not be sweat-free.
You see. I have some experience in this
matter. My clothing line is made in Malaysia,
making it both technically made in America
and ensuring the labor is dirt cheap. My for
mer roommate, now heading up my New
York division, has assured me that it's prac
tically criminal how much we pay these peo
ple, but not criminal enough for me to ever

he convicted in a court of law. You never can
tell when he's joking after he's got bourbon
in him.
So here's the rub: apparently, some of the
Holt's Harangue brand lobster bibs are not
"sweat-free." I haven't visited the site exact
ly because 1 don't tan well, but let's just say
I've been assured that everyone is fully em
bodying the Protestant work ethic, those lit
tle godless heathens.
Personally, like Stanford, 1 don't want to
be sweat-free. I think workers should be
sweating a bit to get the work done, or else
it's too shoddily crafted to be marketable. 1
mean, if they aren't exerting effort, the qual
ity will resemble those prizes you win at car
nivals or Tara Reid's breasts.
If the work is truly sweat-free then it's
probably done by robots. Is that what Stan

ford and the world wants, robots taking over
good jobs provided by American-like peo
ples? In my opinion, there is something sim
ply more personal and heartwarming about
knowing that an eigh-year-old personally
crafted your Holt's Harangue brand mini
skirt (very popular item in Japan, from what
I've been told).
Now Stanford is being pressed by persons
from the Sweat Free Coalition to mend its
ways. Stanford, don't wuss out on me. Seri
ously. You guys and Nike are the only com
panies in the world still holding out. 112 know,
it's hard not to cave. I mean, you have the
student government, faculty members and
naked hippies all pleading for change. It's
hard not to listen to people who are willing
to come at you with kitty litter. Or whose
protests break down because nature calls. Or
who can't wait another week to go to a
scheduled meeting.
But in my humble opinion.no matter how
many students protest, you shouldn't listen.
At Holt s Harangue, Inc., we have a policy of
throwing people in sacks with rabid badgers
any time they question our labor policy. I en
courage you to take a similar approach next
time the students break out of their pre-des-

TTiink of all the money you could
be losing if you acquiesced to hav
ing oversight from theWßCand the
DSP, thereby ensuring that Stanford
clothing was "sweat-free." This
money could go to palm trees and
antiseptic buildings built by a
creepy and controlling developer

Phil Knight, founder of Nike,
stopped funding the University of
Oregon, his Alma Mater, when they
switched to the WRC. 1 doubt Mr.
Knight's millions are more impor
tant to you than student opinions,
hut my money should be. 1 have mil
lions of waffles, I mean dollars,
which could be yours if you only re
mained strong in your decision to ig
nore human rights groups.
And while people will point out
that the UC campuses have all gone
sweat-free, for Stanford to do so
would be breaking custom. Stan
ford has a proud tradition of ex
ploiting labor, back to the days
when Leland Stanford paid Chi
nese railroad workers in Canter
bury creme eggs.
Based on your ability to pay a
living wage to your local employ
ees, I believe the likelihood of you
paying foreigners in your sweat
shops a living wage is unlikely. That
means if you went sweat-free, these
impoverished people would lose
their jobs. They'd be replaced by
faceless robots who in their off
hours would taunt the former em
ployees, hassle them at the local
dance halls and ultimately burn
what 1 imagine to be their thatch
roofed villages and their pagan
shrines. Think Apocalypse Now
crossed with Roger and Me. lliese
robots, after destroying their vil
lages, would ultimately come after
their creators: and that's you and
me. President Hennessy.
President Hennessy: when you
make your decision, i don't want
you to think of the impoverished
and exploited workers, the naked
students or the enraged faculty. 1
want you to think of the real op
pressed people here: the millionaire
investors whose money you might
lose and whose robots may ulti
mately destroy us all.

Now Stanford is being pressed by persons
from the Sweat Free Coalition to mend its
ways. Stanford, don't wuss out on me. Seri
ously. You guys and Nike are the only com
panies in the world still holding out. 112 know,
it's hard not to cave. I mean, you have the
student government, faculty members and
naked hippies all pleading for change. It's
hard not to listen to people who are willing
to come at you with kitty litter. Or whose
protests break down because nature calls. Or
who can't wait another week to go to a
scheduled meeting.
But in my humble opinion.no matter how
many students protest, you shouldn't listen.
At Holt s Harangue, Inc., we have a policy of
throwing people in sacks with rabid badgers
any time they question our labor policy. I en
courage you to take a similar approach next
time the students break out of their pre-des-

TTiink of all the money you could
be losing if you acquiesced to hav
ing oversight from theWßCand the
DSP, thereby ensuring that Stanford
clothing was "sweat-free." This
money could go to palm trees and
antiseptic buildings built by a
creepy and controlling developer
— your favorite!
Phil Knight, founder of Nike,
stopped funding the University of
Oregon, his Alma Mater, when they
switched to the WRC. 1 doubt Mr.
Knight's millions are more impor
tant to you than student opinions,
hut my money should be. 1 have mil
lions of waffles, I mean dollars,
which could be yours if you only re
mained strong in your decision to ig
nore human rights groups.
And while people will point out
that the UC campuses have all gone
sweat-free, for Stanford to do so
would be breaking custom. Stan
ford has a proud tradition of ex
ploiting labor, back to the days
when Leland Stanford paid Chi
nese railroad workers in Canter
bury creme eggs.
Based on your ability to pay a
living wage to your local employ
ees, I believe the likelihood of you
paying foreigners in your sweat
shops a living wage is unlikely. That
means if you went sweat-free, these
impoverished people would lose
their jobs. They'd be replaced by
faceless robots who in their off
hours would taunt the former em
ployees, hassle them at the local
dance halls and ultimately burn
what 1 imagine to be their thatch
roofed villages and their pagan
shrines. Think Apocalypse Now
crossed with Roger and Me. lliese
robots, after destroying their vil
lages, would ultimately come after
their creators: and that's you and
me. President Hennessy.
President Hennessy: when you
make your decision, i don't want
you to think of the impoverished
and exploited workers, the naked
students or the enraged faculty. 1
want you to think of the real op
pressed people here: the millionaire
investors whose money you might
lose and whose robots may ulti
mately destroy us all.

Cliris thinks the Sweat-Free Coali
tion's hearts are in the right place,
even if their heads are full of kitty
litter. Stanford must he sweat-free.
