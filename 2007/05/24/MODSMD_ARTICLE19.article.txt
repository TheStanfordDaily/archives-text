## Make Stanford Sweat-Free 
### BRADLEY HEINZ 
I got naked in public. It was a little nerve
wracking. You may have seen me with
some of my fellow protesters baring
more than is comfortable. It's almost certain
we all own and wear products produced in
sweatshops. As American consumers, we
have little choice. But for Tuesday's protest,
we took a symbolic stand to say we'd rather
face the social anxiety associated with
breaking major taboos than wear "dirty"
clothes. Fortunately for us at Stanford, we
do have another choice. We can join or sup
port the Sweat-Free Campaign and push
our University to join the WRC and the
DSP. ensuring the hallowed Stanford name
is not associated with exploitation, violence
and poverty-perpetuating systems of pro
duction.
The majority of the discussion about
sweat-free labor has centered on issues of
worker dignity and human rights, accompa
nied by the heart-wrenching stories of chil
dren working 15 hours a day without earn
ing enough to feed themselves. While the

lack of humanity of this situation is ap
palling as well as pertinent, it must be recog
nized that sweatshop labor is illegal accord
ing to many international laws. Accepting
the universality of certain labor practices is
implicit in the adoption of the United Na
tions Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. As an agency of the UN. the Interna
tional Labor Organization's Fundamental
Conventions on Principles and Rights at
Work affect the member states of the UN,
many of whom allow sweatshop practices
that directly contradict these standards.
With little enforcement in the international
community, institutions like Stanford must
stand against these injustices. What we buy
and what we sell matters. It may well be the
only thing that does these days.
Protesting naked was an obvious media
stunt. It cannot be denied. The campaign
hoped this demonstration would draw cov
erage from outside media. When the people
in power refuse to make any decisions re
garding pressing issues, outside pressure and
coverage are necessary to inspire action. Nu
dity and other civil-disobedient demonstra

lions lend visibility to the movement and
cause.The increased dialogue, both in print
and in person, lead me to believe Tuesday s
action was successful.
The Stanford Challenge claims that
Stanford believes it has the opportunity
and the obligation to bring its full resources
to bear in addressing issues facing humani
ty. "On TUesday, and for the past few years
amidst other campaigns, students have
shown this bold spirit yet have been frustrat
ed by its absence from the very administra
tion propagating this message to potential
donors. Every student knows his or her con
duct is held to the Fundamental Standard.
Why won t the administration match its ac
tions with this standard as well? I low can its
behavior disregard the foundational princi
ples and messages it presents to its commu
nity and to the world?
ITie sad fact is that our administration
plays upon the student body's short institu
tional memory. Our administration has his
torically employed stalling tactics honins
we'd graduate and go abroad so that
the momentum or cohesion of cer
tain movements will dissolve.
STAND faced painfully incremen
tal decisions and morally weak com
promises during their divestment
campaign: SLAC trudged through
dozens of meetings, newly formed
committees, rallies, protests and
even hunger strikes to get the ad
ministration to make any decisions.
Unfortunately, Sweat-Free faces the
same hindrances. Diplomatic discus
sion with our administration ceased
a while back. To anyone closely
aligned with the campaign. Presi
dent Henessy's agreement to meet
next week stands out as a clear ef
fort to postpone decisions.
Nike, a staunch opponent to
anti-sweatshop campaigns, outfits

and supports all our sports teams,
ExxonMobil funds energy research
and many other global corporations
have infiltrated our classrooms. De
spite these funds and opportunities,
we must question their influence
over our core values as a University.
Are we producing knowledge for
knowledge's sake, to expand hu
manity's understanding of our
world, or is Stanford's research and
curriculum geared toward produc
ing profit? To do the right thing re
garding donations, wages and prod
uct licensing, Stanford may have to
sacrifice some of its efficiency as a
profit-making machine to uphold
its integrity as an institution.
A community is only as strong as
its weakest member, and Stanford's
continued affiliation with industries
that feed off the economic plight of
workers in developing countries is a
very weak link, indeed. If the Uni
versity continues to disregard this
issue, it becomes no better than the
companies profiting off the illegal

and unjust labor of children. If the
administration fails to commit to
protecting human rights of workers
outside of as well as within the Uni
versity, how can the Stanford Chal
lenge or the Fundamental Standard
ever he taken seriously?
The solution is simple. Close the
gap. Join our peer institutions. Har
vard. Cornell. Columbia. Brown
and. yes. Berkeley, to become the
172 nd member of the Worker
Rights Consortium. For the campus
community this could mean the dif
ference between pride in a universi
ty that walks the way it talks and
disgust at yet another American in
stitution looking at its own short
sighted needs. For workers around
the world, it could be the difference
between supporting an entire fami
ly and not being able to feed even
oneself.
