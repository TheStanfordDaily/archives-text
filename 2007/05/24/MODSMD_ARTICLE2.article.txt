## High school graduate pretends to be a Stanford student, even living in the dorms, buying textbooks and studying for exams 
### ANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Azia Kim was like any other Stanford freshman. She
graduated from one of California's most competitive
high schools last June, moved into the dorms during
New Student Orientation, talked about upcoming tests
and spent her free time with friends.
The only problem is that Azia Kim was never a Stan
ford student.
Kim, an 18-year-old from Orange County who grad
uated from Fullerton's Troy High School, lived in Kim
ball throughout fall and winter quarter. She lived in
Okada. the Asian-American theme dorm, until Monday
night, when University staff finally caught onto her ruse.
Friends aren't sure of her motive for sneaking onto
campus and living a lie. but many speculate that she felt
pressure from overbearing parents to attend Stanford
— regardless of whether she was admitted.

What Kim's friends do know is that they are scared
and angry that someone slipped through the cracks for
eight months.
"Personally, 1 don't feel safe now that Stanford al
lowed this to happen and that they're not doing any
thing to ensure the safety of their students," said Amy
Zhou '08. Kim's roommate in Okada. "1 think some
thing's definitely wrong with the system if this could
happen."
Kim declined comment for this story, unless the
newspaper agreed to withhold her name. She suggested,
but then declined,postponing publication one day in ex
change for speaking on the record.
Kim started hereon on Sept. 18.2006. the day before
New Student Orientation began. She told Kimball
roommates Jenssy Rojina '09 and Missy Penna '09, a star
softball pitcher, that she was a freshman who was tem-
porarily out of housing due to a tech
nical mixup, according to Zhou.
Rojina and Penna, who both de
clined comment, believed Kim's
story and let her sleep in their room.
Kim apparently told Rojina that she
moved into Kimball because she dis
liked her assigned roommate. Kim
squatted in the 210-resident dorm
splitting her time between her
"room" and the Kimball lounge —
for the majority of fall and winter
quarter.
"i ate with this girl. I went to San
Francisco with this girl, she was like
my sister' — that's what Rojina said
to me." said a friend of RojinaVShe
told me that |Kim] crashed there
every night."
But come spring quarter, Kim's
welcome in Kimball was wearing
thin, so she set out to find a new
room. Okada resident Jennifer l ee
'08 told her that Zhou's roommate
was going to Japan for the quarter,
creating a vacancy in the one-room
double.
"I remember she came to my
room because the door was open and
she was asking if anyone wanted a
roommate," said Lee, Okada's ethnic
theme associate. "She seemed like a
pretty typical Stanford student,
dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Not re
ally suspecting anything. I just told
her the rooms that were available."
Kim moved into Okada 108 on
Apr. 18. She told student staff that
Stanford I lousing had approved her
transfer from Roble because she had
more friends on East Campus.
"At RA training, this will be one
of those stories that you would never
expect to happen."said a resident as
sistant who lived with Kim."lt's kind
of impressive, how she was able to
figure everything out and trick so
many people."
Still, Kim had neither a Stanford
ID nor a key. forcing her to sneak
into meals and enter her room
through its window, which over
looked the Munger construction pit.
the Wilbur parking lot and a dump

ster. three feet off the ground. Zhou
never noticed, as she spent nearly all
her nights in her boyfriend's room.
"She took off the screen and al
ways left one of the windows wide
open and the blinds up." Zhou said.
"1 just guessed she always wanted a
breezy room."
To avoid suspicion while in
Okada. Kim pretended to be a soph
omore majoring in human biology,
going as far as to buy textbooks and
study with friends for tests she would
never take. Residents of the 94-per
son dorm were none the wiser.
"She really knew her stuff, and re
ally knew the schedule," Zhou said.
"For 1 lumßio, she would say.'l have
a midterm Monday in this room,'
and I knew that was true because m\
friends are 1 lumßio [students|."
Last Sunday, Okada RA Soo Kim
08 triggered the beginning of the
end at the weekly staff meeting. An
Otero RA told her that A/ia Kim
had claimed to live in Otero. Soo
Kim was suspicious and emailed
Housing on Monday. Only then
eight months after Azia Kim first
moved into Kimball — did the au
thorities finally realize what had
happened.
"It's kind of crazy that it was
under our radar for so long." said
Soo Kim. "I couldn't even imagine a
squatter situation. That was never
anything that I was conscious of."
It took Zhou even longer to find
out the truth — she said that A/ia
Kim broke into her email account
and permanently deleted emails
from Housing that explained the sit
uation. Kim even replied to I lousing,
imitating her roommate in an email
that Zhou provided The Daily:
"Hey Edith,
Actually. Azia doesn't stay
here permanently, she just stays occa
sionally when she stays late. Sorry, I
apologize for any confusions.
Amy"
Azia Kim pretended to move out
early Monday evening, removing
every visible object save for a light or
two.
But Zhou soon discovered that
Kim had simply hidden her clothes
in the closet. The RAs confiscated
Kim's possessions and posted a terse
notice on the door. A cab eventually

took Kim to an uncle's San Jose
house at 2 a.m. Tuesday morning.
Zhou is not taking any chances
though: She's ordered I lousing to in
stall a chain on her window.
"To think that someone 1 trusted
to he ;i Stanford student with a key
was climbing in and out of windows
and that 1 was in the same room all
this time really freaked me out."
Zhou said.
Police are currently investigating
the situation. They could press tres
passing or theft of services charges
Stanford Mousing charges unau
thorized visitors $175 daily, bringing
Kim's einht-month liability up to
$42,000. '
But after filing a report with the
Department of Public Safety. Zhou
doesn't think much will be done.
"The police just said. '11 we see
her on campus, we'll evict her,' and
say. "Don't do anything anymore,"'
Zhou said. "Even after hacking into
my email account, they said there's
nothing tliev can do unless she was
using it to fraud anyone. 1 don't think
they're going to do anything."
The police did not return a call
seeking comment.
Residential Education officials
declined to comment — typical
practice for any ongoing investiga
tion. More than 10 students were in
terviewed for this article; many are
ResEd employees who would only
speak ofl-the-record or on the condi
tion of anonymity.
Neighbors and acquaintances de
scribed Kim as a quiet, tall Asian girl,
unassuming at first glance.
"She was kind of shy, kind of re
served. but for someone who really
isn't affiliated with Stanford, that's
to be expected." Okada neighbor Bo
Zheng 'OK said. "When 1 saw her in
the hall, she wouldn't really say 'hi'
or anything."
But closer friends hinted at deep
er troubles underneath a sweet ve
neer.
"There must be something big be
hind this, "said I .ee. "because 1 don't
think people behave this way for no
reason. We're hoping she gets help if
she needs it."

Azia Kim was like any other Stanford freshman. She
graduated from one of California's most competitive
high schools last June, moved into the dorms during
New Student Orientation, talked about upcoming tests
and spent her free time with friends.
The only problem is that Azia Kim was never a Stan
ford student.
Kim, an 18-year-old from Orange County who grad
uated from Fullerton's Troy High School, lived in Kim
ball throughout fall and winter quarter. She lived in
Okada. the Asian-American theme dorm, until Monday
night, when University staff finally caught onto her ruse.
Friends aren't sure of her motive for sneaking onto
campus and living a lie. but many speculate that she felt
pressure from overbearing parents to attend Stanford
— regardless of whether she was admitted.

What Kim's friends do know is that they are scared
and angry that someone slipped through the cracks for
eight months.
"Personally, 1 don't feel safe now that Stanford al
lowed this to happen and that they're not doing any
thing to ensure the safety of their students," said Amy
Zhou '08. Kim's roommate in Okada. "1 think some
thing's definitely wrong with the system if this could
happen."
Kim declined comment for this story, unless the
newspaper agreed to withhold her name. She suggested,
but then declined,postponing publication one day in ex
change for speaking on the record.
Kim started hereon on Sept. 18.2006. the day before
New Student Orientation began. She told Kimball
roommates Jenssy Rojina '09 and Missy Penna '09, a star
softball pitcher, that she was a freshman who was tem-
porarily out of housing due to a tech
nical mixup, according to Zhou.
Rojina and Penna, who both de
clined comment, believed Kim's
story and let her sleep in their room.
Kim apparently told Rojina that she
moved into Kimball because she dis
liked her assigned roommate. Kim
squatted in the 210-resident dorm
splitting her time between her
"room" and the Kimball lounge —
for the majority of fall and winter
quarter.
"i ate with this girl. I went to San
Francisco with this girl, she was like
my sister' — that's what Rojina said
to me." said a friend of RojinaVShe
told me that |Kim] crashed there
every night."
But come spring quarter, Kim's
welcome in Kimball was wearing
thin, so she set out to find a new
room. Okada resident Jennifer l ee
'08 told her that Zhou's roommate
was going to Japan for the quarter,
creating a vacancy in the one-room
double.
"I remember she came to my
room because the door was open and
she was asking if anyone wanted a
roommate," said Lee, Okada's ethnic
theme associate. "She seemed like a
pretty typical Stanford student,
dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Not re
ally suspecting anything. I just told
her the rooms that were available."
Kim moved into Okada 108 on
Apr. 18. She told student staff that
Stanford I lousing had approved her
transfer from Roble because she had
more friends on East Campus.
"At RA training, this will be one
of those stories that you would never
expect to happen."said a resident as
sistant who lived with Kim."lt's kind
of impressive, how she was able to
figure everything out and trick so
many people."
Still, Kim had neither a Stanford
ID nor a key. forcing her to sneak
into meals and enter her room
through its window, which over
looked the Munger construction pit.
the Wilbur parking lot and a dump

ster. three feet off the ground. Zhou
never noticed, as she spent nearly all
her nights in her boyfriend's room.
"She took off the screen and al
ways left one of the windows wide
open and the blinds up." Zhou said.
"1 just guessed she always wanted a
breezy room."
To avoid suspicion while in
Okada. Kim pretended to be a soph
omore majoring in human biology,
going as far as to buy textbooks and
study with friends for tests she would
never take. Residents of the 94-per
son dorm were none the wiser.
"She really knew her stuff, and re
ally knew the schedule," Zhou said.
"For 1 lumßio, she would say.'l have
a midterm Monday in this room,'
and I knew that was true because m\
friends are 1 lumßio [students|."
Last Sunday, Okada RA Soo Kim
08 triggered the beginning of the
end at the weekly staff meeting. An
Otero RA told her that A/ia Kim
had claimed to live in Otero. Soo
Kim was suspicious and emailed
Housing on Monday. Only then
eight months after Azia Kim first
moved into Kimball — did the au
thorities finally realize what had
happened.
"It's kind of crazy that it was
under our radar for so long." said
Soo Kim. "I couldn't even imagine a
squatter situation. That was never
anything that I was conscious of."
It took Zhou even longer to find
out the truth — she said that A/ia
Kim broke into her email account
and permanently deleted emails
from Housing that explained the sit
uation. Kim even replied to I lousing,
imitating her roommate in an email
that Zhou provided The Daily:
"Hey Edith,
Actually. Azia doesn't stay
here permanently, she just stays occa
sionally when she stays late. Sorry, I
apologize for any confusions.
Amy"
Azia Kim pretended to move out
early Monday evening, removing
every visible object save for a light or
two.
But Zhou soon discovered that
Kim had simply hidden her clothes
in the closet. The RAs confiscated
Kim's possessions and posted a terse
notice on the door. A cab eventually

took Kim to an uncle's San Jose
house at 2 a.m. Tuesday morning.
Zhou is not taking any chances
though: She's ordered I lousing to in
stall a chain on her window.
"To think that someone 1 trusted
to he ;i Stanford student with a key
was climbing in and out of windows
and that 1 was in the same room all
this time really freaked me out."
Zhou said.
Police are currently investigating
the situation. They could press tres
passing or theft of services charges
Stanford Mousing charges unau
thorized visitors $175 daily, bringing
Kim's einht-month liability up to
$42,000. '
But after filing a report with the
Department of Public Safety. Zhou
doesn't think much will be done.
"The police just said. '11 we see
her on campus, we'll evict her,' and
say. "Don't do anything anymore,"'
Zhou said. "Even after hacking into
my email account, they said there's
nothing tliev can do unless she was
using it to fraud anyone. 1 don't think
they're going to do anything."
The police did not return a call
seeking comment.
Residential Education officials
declined to comment — typical
practice for any ongoing investiga
tion. More than 10 students were in
terviewed for this article; many are
ResEd employees who would only
speak ofl-the-record or on the condi
tion of anonymity.
Neighbors and acquaintances de
scribed Kim as a quiet, tall Asian girl,
unassuming at first glance.
"She was kind of shy, kind of re
served. but for someone who really
isn't affiliated with Stanford, that's
to be expected." Okada neighbor Bo
Zheng 'OK said. "When 1 saw her in
the hall, she wouldn't really say 'hi'
or anything."
