## Sweat-free tactics counterproductive 
### 
'Hie recent sit-in by the Stanford
Sweat-Free Coalition has raised
more questions than answers about
an extremely controversial and
heavily debated topic. The students
are working toward a noble cause;
improving labor standards is some
thing we should all certainly sub
scribe to in the long term. Unfortu
nately, the group is remiss in both its
short-term goals and methods.
To start, the coalition proclaims
its overarching goal to be forcing
Stanford to join the Workers'
Rights Consortium (WRC) and the
Designated Suppliers Program
(DSP), which, according to the
coalition's website, would make
sure that the "workers who produce
our Stanford apparel do not work in
sweatshops." Upon closer examina
tion. though, the issue becomes
more ambiguous.
ITie DSP lists various criteria a
factory must meet in order to quali
fy as a supplier to universities that
are signatories. One particularly
suspicious criterion is the require
ment that a factory must respect
"workers' associational rights,"
which can be demonstrated by the
presence of a labor union at the fac
tory. or in one's absence, the right
for workers to freely unionize.
Iliis is certainly a noble goal.The
only problem is that many of the
countries hosting factories in ques
tion do not permit unionization.

China, for instance, permits only
one, state-controlled trade union
and strictly prohibits independent
unions, collective bargaining or
labor organization, with violators
often facing serious prison sen
tences. Even if a factory in China
wanted to grant workers these
rights, it could not do so legally.
Sure, increased democracy in China
is a lofty aim, but in the short-run.
does this labor standard help or bur
den the lives of individual workers?
l"he answer is not so clear.
In addition to confused objec
tives, the coalition is flatly out of line
with its methods. Hie group openly
boasts the fact that it has met with
President Hennessey six times over
the last three months, with another
meeting scheduled for next week
and an ultimate decision scheduled
to be made sometime in June, mak
ing the timing of this protest rather
curious.
That meeting, according to Pres
ident Hennessey's office, will now
be canceled. If the coalition truly
wanted to force President Hen
nessey to take action on its de
mands, as it claimed was the inten
tion of the protest, why throw away
all this progress for what now. fairly
or unfairly, appears to be a glorified
attention stunt?
Stanford is a big bureaucracy
and. as with any big bureaucracy, de
cisions take time. The demands the

Sweat-Free coalition is making are
no small drop in the bucket. They
stand to affect many millions of dol
lars of business and perhaps the lives
of many millions more. 1. for one, am
happy to see the administration act
deliberately when addressing issues
of this magnitude. Whether or not
President Hennessey truly intended
to support the group next month is
uncertain; it is, however, almost cer
tain that he will not now. As a mem
ber of student groups that have had
difficulty scheduling meetings with
President I lennessey, his willingness
to meet with the coalition seven
times over the course of three
months suggests sincere interest on
his part. While, admittedly, 1 have
not been present at the meetings, it is
quite possible that the coalition
overplayed its hand in trying to force
an earlier decision.
Stanford lately has seen a flurry
of student activism. This should be
commended, as the student body —
like any part of a democratic insti
tution— should voice its opinions
and voice them loudly. The success
of campaigns hosted by SLAC and
STAND both demonstrate, howev
er, the need for patient persistence
when dealing with controversial is
sues. The sweat-free coalition may
ultimately have succeeded. Now it
seems like we will never know.
