## What should the Stanford label mean? 
### 
When you wear that Stanford
logo on a shirt or send a Stan
ford cap to a relative, what do
you want to be able to say about the
workers who made your clothing? At
press time, 169 colleges and u liversities,
including Harvard. Brown. Columbia,
Duke.Cornell, Georgetown and the en
tire I Jniversity of California system are
ahead of Stanford in opposing sweat
shops. All of these institutions have
joined the Worker Rights Consortium
(WRC), an independent labor rights
monitoring organization aimed at the
manufacturing of prixlucts bearing uni
versity and college logos. I In fortunately.
Stanford has not joined the WRC and
currently has no independent monitor
ing mechanisms or Code of Conduct in
place for the manufacture of its com
mercial apparel. In order to become the
enlightened institution it claims to be,
Stanford should also join the Designat
ed Suppliers Program (DSP) of the
WRC' to join 32 institutions that have al
ready dime so. including the I JC' system.
Columbia and Duke.
The WRC and DSP together would
ensure that factory conditions are hu
mane. Workers would be guaranteed a
living wage, the right to unionize, free
dom from harassment and intimida
tion and a safe working environment.
Furthermore, by requiring licensees to
sign long- term contracts with their
suppliers, the DSP will stabilize an in
dustry known for constantly shifting its
production from country to country
and provide garment workers with a
reasonable level of job security.
The DSP is implemented gradually
in different phases over the course of
three years. As a result, licensees get
time to comply with the new regula
tions. and the university gets a chance to
evaluate the DSP as it becomes a reality.
Ihese provisions should make it possi
ble for Stanford to implement the DSI*
as other universities have done already.
We do not think that the Fair Labor
Association (FI -A) is a good alternative
to the WRC '.The FLA essentially relies
on companies monitoring themselves
whereas the WRC requires independ
ent monitoring of factories. Independent
monitoring is necessary for the manufac
turing of university products for the
same reason that it is necessary in other
areas such as health and safety regula
tions for restaurants. While the WRC'
only monitors apparel factories, we think
that real monitoring of the largest part of
our licensed products is better than inef
fective monitoring of all of them.

Advocates of the WRC7DSP often
hear arguments pointing to the difficulty
of monitoring factories and the fact that
collegiate clothing is a small percentage
of the U.S. apparel market. Others say
that the WRC/DSP interferes with or
weakens the FLA. Hut the University
has both moral and strategic reasons to
become part of the WRC '/DSP process.
The daunting nature of the worldwide
sweatshop problem is no reason to shun
engagement with one of the best current
approaches to it. As Bethany Woolman
'09 of Sweatshop Free Stanford has said.
"It takes someone with integrity to take
the first step." Arguments that you may
hear opposing the WRC /DSP have gen
erally been debated extensively within
the \VRC' and have received a full hear
ing at institutions that have later commit
ted to the DSP (see http://www.worker
srights.org/dsp.asp for a list of links). The
demonstrated ability of the consortium
to critique its own practices and to adopt
new ones is one of the reasons we believe
Stanford should join.
For us. the bottom line is really this:
What is being produced here is our cloth
ing. We care not only about how it looks,
but also about how it is produced. ()ur
contracts with our licensees should spec
ify that we care about all of these things.
But while the size, color and fabric of a
Stanford T-shirt are easy to verify, the
working conditions in which it was pro
duced are not. Joining the DSl' of the
WRC' is the best way to verify that our
contracts are fulfilled and to ensure that
licensees understand the clause in our
contract that says NO SWEAT.
