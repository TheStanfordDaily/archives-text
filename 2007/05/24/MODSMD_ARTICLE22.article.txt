## Cycling wins title Squad rides to victory with gutsy team efforts 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming from a school where biking is the
top form of transportation, it's only appro
priate that the Stanford cycling team is now
the top in the country. Competing at the
USA Cycling Collegiate Road National
Championships, May 11-13, the Cardinal
bikers took home the team title by an 89-
point margin.
Driving Stanford's win in Lawrence,
Kan., was the consistently high performance
of its ten cyclists. With points awarded based
on order of finish, the Cardinal was able to
accumulate 519 points and beat its rival, the
2006 champion, UC-Davis (430). Fort Lewis
College followed in third with 403 points,
while Midwestern State (385) and Colorado
State (347) rounded out the top five.
Despite the Cardinal's depth, three cy
clists in particular came out to lead the pack:
senior Rand Miller garnered top-10 finishes
in the men's road and criterium races, plac
ing ninth and sixth, respectively. And among
the women,Caitlyn McCullough.a first-year
bioengineering graduate student, took sixth
in the criterium. while sophomore Arwen
Bradley placed ninth in the road race.
'ITie weekend proved the ultimate finish
for Miller, especially after four years of chas
ing the national title with the Stanford
squad.
"For me it's been a lot of elation over the
past week and half." he said. "1 really haven't
quite gotten over it yet. It's been a dream of
mine to win a national championship of
some kind since I started bike racing back at
the beginning of high school."
With that long-standing goal. Miller en-

Led by senior Rand Miller, who posted two
top-10 finishes on the weekend, the Stanford Cycling
team brought home the national championship by a 89
point margin over runner-up UC-Davis. Miller faded
slightly after an early charge in the road race, but still
managed to hang on for a ninth-place finish. A day
later, the senior cruised to a sixth-place finish in the cri
terium. Stanford also got strong efforts from its women,
as Caitlyn McCullough (sixth in the criterium) and Arwen
Bradley (ninth in the road race) helped the Cardinal
knock off the defending national champion Aggies.

tercel the weekend hoping to grab at least
one top-10 finish to aid the Stanford squad.
Not only would a lower finish have proven
disappointing individually, according to
Miller, hut it also wouldn't have helped the
rest of the squad.
"I wanted to pull my weight on the team
because I knew 1 had a shot." he said."lf not
every single one of us pitched in, we would
n't have won the title. So. it felt good for me
to lead the team in that way."
The Cardinal men and women had gotten
off to a good start in Friday's team trials, with
the women taking third and the men finish
ing sixth; going into Saturday's 84-mile road
race. Miller knew he would need to step
things up to keep the Cardinal in the running
for the championship.
All season long. Miller had seen croups of

10 or 15 riders break off from the pack near
the start of races, so he decided to take the
risk and do the same, only to have it pay off
in spades.
"I went really early and no one went with
me. so I was out there by myself and 1 got a
huge gap without pushing too much," he
said. "I was really trying to conserve my en

ergy. but I still ended up getting a two
minute gap over the entire field."
That gap was closed by the end of the race
as a set of riders broke off from the main
pack to push Miller back into ninth.
But the breakaway strategy had worked,
so Miller tried it again in Saturday's criteri
um when a group of riders left the main pack

halfway through the race. Noticing the cy
clists pull away. Miller pushed forward as
well in hopes of leaving the Cardinal's top ri
vals — UC-Davis and Fort Lewis — behind
in the main pack.

Senior Rand Miller posted a pair of top-10 finishes to help boost the Cardinal to the national title. In both the road race and the criterium, Miller
decided to make a push in the early going. The strategy paid off, as the senior took ninth in the road race and sixth in the criterium a day later.
