The phrase "coming full circle" has much
meaning for a Icadoff hitter in Softball —
the lineup starts anil ends with that player.
And for senior Jackie Rinehart of the Stan
lord softball team, "coming full circle" has
completely defined her collegiate soft ball career.
When she was eight, the Reno. Nev.-native started
playing baseball with her older brothers and father.

seeking to be included in their practices.
"1 always looked up to them," Rinehart said.
"[Baseball] was always something I wanted to do with
them."
Soon, though. Rinehart moved on to play with nu
merous softball teams; as she traveled around, she
even came to idolize a former Stanford softball star,
Jessica Mendoza "02.

"The person I've always look up
the most is Jessica Mendoza," Rine
hart said. "She holds so many of
Stanford's records and she's one of
the best players on the U.S. Olympic
team."
Following in the footsteps of her
idol, softball proved Rinehart's own
ticket to the Farm. And once here,
she was quickly thrust into the spot
light as the Cardinal's leadoff hitter
during its playoff run.
"Freshman year,going to the Col
lege World Series was a huge thing
for us right off the bat," Rinehart
said."From then on, I took every sin
gle postseason extremely seriously,
and I feel that I get better at-bats be
cause of greater concentration. It's
simply all or nothing at that point."
And as the leadoff hitter. Rine
hart did not disappoint. In her fresh
man season, she started all 6K games

for the Cardinal, hitting .356 with 80
hits, 40 runs and 13 stolen bases.
Rinehart also went on to set the sin
gle-season record for at-bats (225).
With a strong first-year campaign
under her belt. Rinehart was able to
establish herself at the top of Stan
ford's order for the next three years.
In that time, Rinehart has not let up
on any opposing pitchers, hitting
over .300 each season on the Farm.
In fact, Rinehart will graduate as one
of only five players in Stanford his
tory to have posted a career batting
average above the .300 mark.
Although her numbers have
come a longway, Rinehart still looks
back to the habits and rituals she
picked up at the start of her fresh
man year as sources of success.
"It's funny because I really try
not to be superstitious, but I've got
ten into a routine that I've per
formed for four years now." she said.
"When I get in the batter's box. I al
ways enter the same way. When I 'm
on deck, 1 do the same routine to get
relaxed and into the rit>ht mindset of

hitting."
Rinehart has also kept up the
freshman habit of hitting last in
warm-ups. But despite these throw
backs. Rinehart's game is just as de
pendent on her adaptability.
"[I lead] coach [John Rittman] al

from there. I've always had that
mindset to learn from each at-bat
and take it to the next one."
I laving developed a keen eye and
knack for squaring up the ball. Rine
hart has been selected to three na
tional teams, including the USA Jr.

"Every game has the potential of being my last game.
It was a lot of fun, but it had to end sometime."

— Senior Jackie Rinehart,
on the Cardinal's early exit from the postseason and the conclusion of her career

ways tell us that softball is a game of
failure, so if you're hitting .300,
you're failing seven out of 10 times,"
Rinehart said. "It's just taking every
at-bat as a new one, and even if you
didn't have a great at-bat the time
before, you have to learn from it,
learn the pitcher's habits and go

World Team, the U.S. Elite team and
the World University team. On a big
ger scale than in her early softball
days. Rinehart has had the opportu
nity travel the world, representing
her country in international play.
And in practicing with the game's
best, she's even been able to meet

her idol.
"Jessica comes out to practice
once a while, and it's one of the
coolest days when she takes the out
field with me," Rinehart said."Those
days, I get to play and talk with one
of the best in the game."
Back on the Farm. Rinehart has
stood alone as Stanford's sole lead
off hitter, but she's also become a
part of a softball family. Planning to
stay another year on campus to fin
ish her major in psychology, Rine
hart figures she'll remain close with
the squad.
"I'm going be their biggest fan
next year."she said."l'll definitely be
in touch with the girls.They'll always
be my teammates and my family."
Rinehart has spent so much of
her past four years with the Cardinal
women that when asked about a
defining moment in her career,she
couldn't choose a single one. only
thinking of the many she's shared
with the team.
"There are just so many mo
ments," she said. "I just realized that

I've played over 200 games in the
Cardinal uniform. When you look at
other sports and how many games
they play, we've been through a lot
more together."
Last weekend specifically, Stan
ford had to go through heartache.
Eliminated from the regional tour
nament with a loss to No. 10 LSU.the
Cardinal failed to advance for the
first time in Rinehart's career.
Though the postseason was cut
short. Rinehart was ready for it.
"Every game has the potential of
being my last game, and I've kept
that in mind," she said. "It was fun,
but it had to end sometime."
And whether it's her season, ca
reer or time at Stanford that's com
ing to an end, Rinehart knows she'll
always stay close to the game that
brought her here.
"Softball is something that I've
enjoyed forever," she said, "and it's
something I want to keep in my life."
