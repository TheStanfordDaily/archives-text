## Incoming frosh takes on Mount Everest Seven Summits climber will attend Stanford 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Incoming freshman Samantha Lar
son has put a run to the Dish to shame:
Larson summited 29,028-foot Mt. Ever
est last week, becoming the youngest
American to stand atop the world's
tallest peak.

Eighteen-year-old Larson, a Long
Beach, Calif.-native who graduated from
high school last June was accepted into
the Class of 2010. She deferred enroll
ment for a year in order to train for the
climb, which she completed on May 16
with her father. David.
She is also the youngest person to
have climbed the "Seven Summits,"
which comprise the highest peaks on
each continent — Everest in Asia,
Aconcagua in South America, Denali in
North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa.
Elbrus in Europe, Vinson Massif in

Antarctica and Kosciuszko in Australia.
"I feel really incredible," Larson told
The Los Angeles Times via satellite
phone from Everest base camp."I feel re
ally great, you know? I'm happy."
She said she was "lucky" that there
was no wind at the summit, and she
speculated that the temperature at the
top was a balmy 30 degrees below freez
ing.
She did not eat for several days during
the climb, instead drinking a lot of water to
avert dehydration. Larson also said she
"wore everything" she packed to keep

warm, only taking off layers during the de
scent.
Larson also expressed relief upon
achieving her goal.
"I'm happy to be going back to a real
bed and a hot shower tonight," she said.'i
guess I'm kind of relieved that things
went well."
