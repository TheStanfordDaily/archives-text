## 11 joint degree programs offered to law students 
### SALONE KAPUR 
The legal landscape is changing, The modern lawyer
must be grounded in both legal theory and specialized
fields like engineering, medicine und biotechnology. And
the Stanford Law School has finally found a way to incor
porate* this need for legal diversification into its program
ming.
The Law School launched joint degree programs with
11 graduate departments and schools on May 3, making it
the nation's leader in the number of joint degree pro
grams offered. More formal joint degree programs are
planned for the near future.
Law Prof. Mark kelman said such programs will help
future lawyers learn necessary background in their re
spective areas of law.
"One can't help frame good environmental policy with
nothing but pure legal skills," he said in an email to The
Daily. "One simply must understand some of the environ
mental science, some economics. Doing effective human
rights advocacy without a strong background in 1R theo
ry, without a comparativist's knowledge of the cultures [in
which | one might intervene, is simply very difficult."
The Law School's joint degree programs also make a
getting a Master's degree or a Ph.D. in addition to a J.D.
much faster. The new programs allow law students to do
interdisciplinary work and take advantage of other grad
uate programs in preparation for the demands of increas
ingly specialized legal careers.
"Whether it is environmental lawyers and policy mak
ers working with people from earth sciences or lawyers in
volved in high tech IP who work with bioengineers, top
flight lawyers often bridge disciplines," Kelman said, "We
hope that Stanford will be a leader in producing lawyers
most capable of building these bridges."
Law Prof. Mark Lemley '88 said that the new programs
were most relevant to scientific fields like biotechnology.
"Part of working in high-tech legal areas like patent
law is understanding the science," he said. "And one of the
biggest areas of scientific change is biotechnology. So it
was natural that we work with the bioengineering depart
ment on a joint degree program. We hope that this will be
the first of several collaborations be
tween law and science."
Kelman anticipated that the pro
grams would be popular and suc
cessful.
"Putting the programs together
has required the cooperation of
people throughout the University
and has required overcoming some
technical glitches." he said."My feel
ing is that we've gotten superb coop
eration and that the technical glitch
es can all be overcome."
Jenny Allen J.D. '07, a former
Daily writer, said the joint degree
programs are particularly beneficial
to students who are uncertain of
their future legal careers.
"Having a Master's or Ph.D. in
addition to a J.D. will likely open
more doors for students," she said,
"and appeal to those who are not
certain they want to work in a tradi
tional legal job for the rest of their
lives."
