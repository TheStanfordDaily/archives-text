### SALONE KAPUR 
The legal landscape is changing, The modern lawyer
must be grounded in both legal theory and specialized
fields like engineering, medicine und biotechnology. And
the Stanford Law School has finally found a way to incor
porate* this need for legal diversification into its program
ming.
The Law School launched joint degree programs with
11 graduate departments and schools on May 3, making it
the nation's leader in the number of joint degree pro
grams offered. More formal joint degree programs are
planned for the near future.

"Whether it is environmental lawyers and policy mak

volved in high tech IP who work with bioengineers, top
flight lawyers often bridge disciplines," Kelman said, "We
hope that Stanford will be a leader in producing lawyers
most capable of building these bridges."
Law Prof. Mark Lemley '88 said that the new programs
were most relevant to scientific fields like biotechnology.
"Part of working in high-tech legal areas like patent
law is understanding the science," he said. "And one of the
biggest areas of scientific change is biotechnology. So it
was natural that we work with the bioengineering depart
ment on a joint degree program. We hope that this will be
