### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) beat around the
Sweat-Free hush at their meeting hist night, but ASSU
President Hershev Avula '08 took a stand against sweat
shop-produced apparel.
Ilie Council debated whether it wanted to spend time
to discuss the controversy or to vote in approval of the
protestors or University administrators, but members ul
timately decided not to address the issue at least offi
cially.
Avula. however, addressed the topic at length, and he
endorsed The Stanford Store for its initiative in supplying
sweatshop-free clothing.
He said the store is "actually the only entirely sweat
free organization on campus."
The GSC also decided to dole out some of its surplus
funds, which amount to nearly $10,000. The Council au
thorized an additional $700 in prizes for students who par
ticipated in the Graduate Student Life Survey, which the
GSC will use to better understand graduate student con
cerns about campus life.
Initially, the GSC had allotted $2,500 dollars for prizes
such as gift certificates and iPods, but an unexpected num
ber of survey participants forced the Council to increase
the amount of money allotted for prizes.
GSC co-Chair George Bloom applauded the survey
and its goals.
"It was one way for us to communicate with our con
stituency," he said,"and find out what kinds of things they
want."
