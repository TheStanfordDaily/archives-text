# The
						PARTY scene at Stanford
## 
### JESSICA FISHELL 
The year is winding down and students are
celebrating. The big end-of-the-year parties
have been checked off one-by-one: Sunsplash
at Sigma Nu. Beltane at Synergy and Exotic
Erotic at 680 Lomita, just to name a few.
According to preliminary numbers, there
have been approximately 6(H) parties regis
tered with the Office of Student Activities
(OSA) this year, and that's not including
walk-in registrations or parties that happen in
series, such as Enchanted Broccoli Forest's
Wednesday bar nights.
Though party organizers have complained
about obstacles they face with the OSA,
Nanci Howe, director of student activities,
maintains that a lot has to be taken into con
sideration when students plan parties.
"Stanford is like its own town and the par
ties impact all the people surrounding them,"
she said, adding that despite regulations and
restrictions, students still manage to have a
good time.
Although the OSA declined to give any
hard numbers, they estimate that most of the
parties come from the undergraduate com
munity — from groups including fraternities,
sororities, houses and student groups. Gradu
ate students host their share of parties, too,
through venues such as the Graduate School
of Business and the Law School.
"Parties are the key source of physical in
teraction on campus," says Armon Sharei '08.
The most visible parties happen at the
fraternities, sororities and houses around the
Row. Sharei, a social manager at Sigma Nu.
estimates that the average fraternity party
gets around 700 to 800 guests throughout the
night. The numbers skyrocket to around
3.000 for the major parties like Sunsplash.
Exotic Erotic,named one of the top lOcol
lege parties by Playboy magazine, is one of
the biggest and most well-known parties at
Stanford.
"Exotic Erotic is different from other
campus parties because it has its own aura."
says Brian Chavarria 08. social manager at
680. "It's got that buildup all year, and fresh
men come to campus knowing about it."
Students say they go to Row parties when
they want to indulge in the big crowds, and it's
a great setting to bump into old acquaintanc
es or classmates.
"It's cool to go out and see friends from
classes in a social setting," says Paula de los
Angeles 10. She thinks the party scene offers
something for every type of student —
"whether you like to party hard or if you just

like to chill."
Aimee Epstein '08 says she thinks the fra
ternities and sororities provide a great service
to the Stanford community by hosting parties,
and there are always alternatives for students
who aren't into the Greek scene.
Many students complain of the repetition
found among Greek parties and gravitate to
alternatives as they accrue more familiarity
and experience with Stanford social life.
"To be honest, I don't like campus par
ties, "says Jasmine Aarons'oB, a social manag
er at Chi Theta C hi. "They're just so formula

ic and cliche."
Phil Narodick '08, social manager at Syn
ergy, said he agrees with Aarons.
"Frat parties are where you go to have
someone grind your genitals, or if you're
looking for someone to do that," he says. "A
great party has to have something other than
music and beer. Maybe it's a great theme, a
moon bounce or nakedness."
As students begin to tire of the frat party
scene, many look to alternatives for more va
riety and personal attention.
"Sometimes you need just a chill atmos

phere to meet people and talk to people."
Priyata Mehra '09 says.
When students have solidified their social
networks, they say they often opt for more in
timate parties to hang out with friends and
take a break from class.
For this more intimate social environ
ment, "the smaller room parties are the scene
now. says Stephanie Kwok '08. adding that
"the big parties lose their appeal after fresh
man year."

At 680 Lomita's Exotic Erotic this past weekend, students gather to have a good time with their friends. Stanford's "work hard, play hard" attitude
is evident in the parties that one freshman says can be enjoyed by every type of student.
