### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has proposed a major expansion
project for the Medical Center, but will first
have to settle the details with the city of Palo
Alto. Although the project's Environmental
Impact Report (FIR) will not be completed
until December, some community members
have already expressed discontent about the
potential impact of the 1.3 million square-foot
expansion.
Hie proposed expansion would replace
nearly half century-old buildings with newer,
larger facilities. The project includes 104 new
beds for the Lucile Packard Children's I lospi
tal and new medical office buildings. Stanford
I lospital would be entirely replaced with a new
600-bed facility.
"We need to increase square footage to ac
commodate our current operation in appropri
ately scaled space," said Mark Tortorich. vice
president of facilities at the medical center.
"Where two patients share a room today, each
patient will have their own."
While the Medical School would not under
go any square footage expansion under the
proposal, some of its 1950s research facilities

would he replaced with new. state-of-the-art
buildings.
Although Palo Alto City Council members
have yet to see detailed expansion plans, some
members have expressed concern about the
proposal. Council member Peter Drekmeier
said he is concerned about the impacts ol the
expansion tin housing and traffic.
"When you add 1.3 million square feet of
new development, that's going to bring in a lot
of new employees," I )rekmeier said, citing a
stud\ by a city consultant that estimated an ad
ditional 37,(XX) new employees would service
the planned square footage additions. "More
people means more traffic and that's a concern
to the surrounding communities. With all the
concern about global warming, we really need
to plan well and help encourage smart growth."
Bern Beecham and other C 'ouncil members
said they wanted to reserve judgment until they
have seen definitive plans.
"We need to let the HIR be drafted, look at
it. comment on it and go from there." Beecham
said."To try and pre-determine outcomes with
no real information isn't worthwhile for any
one."
