## Editorial Board Time to rethink ROTC 
### 
At a commissioning ceremony last
week foi top graduating members of
the Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC). President Bush criticized univer
sities like Stanford, which ban the programs
from their campuses.
In light ol his critique, and our nation's
great need for future military leaders, it is
time foi Stanford to rethink its rationale for
banning on campus ROTC programs.
Brave American soldiers are lighting
and dving on faraway battlefields every day.
Sadly, those paying the ultimate price for
the security of our country are dispropor
tionateh poor, raised in rural areas and not
college educated. By forcing aspiring
ROTC candidates to commute across the
Ba\ to programs at UC-Berkeley or south
to San Jose State, our University perpetu
ates this tragic inequity by implicitly dis
couraging many students from considering
military service.
Our RC )T( ban dates back to 1%9,at the
apogee of the anti-war movement. Hi at
year, the Faculty Senate voted to strip the
ROTC program of its University at filia
tions. saying that the classes that comprised
the ROTC curriculum did not meet Stan
ford's baseline academic standards.
T hat decision undoubtedly reflected a
strong undercurrent of anti-military senti
ment born from opposition to the war in

Vietnam. Such sentiment against the US.
Armed Forces as an institution is not
widely held by Stanford community mem
bers today — no matter what their politi
cal leanings or opinions regarding the
United States' current military cam
paigns.
It is clear that the purely academic ra
tionale against allowing ROTC on campus
does not have merit. Even if one were to ac
cept the dubious argument that these lead
ership courses are qualitatively inferior to
Stanford's many recreational and athletic
classes, this would only be an argument
against allowing the program to offer cred
its toward a Stanford degree. This point is
irrelevant to the question of whether
ROTC should be allowed to function on
campus and whether aspiring military per
sonnel can have access to Stanford facilities
in a manner akin to extra-curricular student
groups.
In spite of these arguments in favor of
lifting the moratorium against on-campus
military training programs, it would be un
fair to deny that consensus remains elusive.
One of the most enduring justifications for
the University's current position is that the
U.S. government's law against allowing
openly homosexual citizens to serve is dis-

criminatory. Critics say allowing
ROTC on campus would violate
Stanford's own anti-discrimination
policies.
The Daily is sympathetic to the
argument that the exclusion of ho
mosexuals from the military is a
compelling rationale to oppose
ROTC on campus. Nonetheless, it is
time to broach the issue once again.
If"don't ask.don't tell" is indeed the
reason for the ban, this should be
made explicit by a new Faculty Sen
ate vote.
During this time when we as a na
tion are asking for the greatest sacri
fices of our servicemen and women,
it is incumbent upon Stanford to
make clear the principled basis on
which it opposes a military presence
on campus. We owe as much to those
currently serving in our military, and
to those members of our community
who are preparing to join them.
