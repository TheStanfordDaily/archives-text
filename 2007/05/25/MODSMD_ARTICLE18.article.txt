My legions of stalkers, super tans and
acolytes may have noticed that
Sketch" has been missing for a
month. This is because, in the paper that
publishes anything (including regular non
sense from that sketchy grad student), I
managed to be inappropriate.
Perhaps inappropriate isn't quite the
right word. I wrote on a topic of consider
able interest to all of us (and one regularly
mentioned by Hie Daily), but I took a posi
tion outside the mainstream and sneeringly
dismissed my imaginary opponents.
My lovely editors (seriously,they're both
adorable) weren't as impressed with my
magnum opus as I was and. right or wrong,
they kicked it to the curb. Iliey argued,
among many other things, that when pre
senting complex and sensitive subjects, air
ing multiple sides to a debate is essential —
if one is going to offer an opinion on a seri
ous issue, one has an obligation to explain
exactly why one is wrong.
Still, as my frustration subsided. I real
ized a couple of things. First off, maybe they
were light — censorship and all that is an
involved subject (perhaps even one for fu
ture contemplation) and the passing of
judgment is not necessarily always unac
ceptable.
Secondly, as I reread my prose, it oc
curred to me that the appropriateness of
opinions was rich and fertile ground for me
the ramble on for a few hundred words
without causing a flutter.This is lucky, since
the only things on my mind riuht now aren't

really tit for non-physicist (i.e. human) con
sumption.
1 was going to write that as you get older,
opinions become less diverse, hut after a lit
tle thought, I'm not really sure that's true.
Opinions certainly become more rigid
(there's a great deal of truth in that old
chestnut about broad minds, narrow waists
and their middle age exchange), but they
preserve much of their spread.
No. I think a more accurate observation
is that the center becomes much more
sharply defined. On any given issue there is
a conventional point of view (or a couple of
them) and then there are the lunatic fringes.
Now. whilst there are advantages to this
it's much more efficient to find a com
promise if you ignore most of the ideas — I
find it rather depressing. If it's a sign of ma
turity to close one's mind, then perhaps ma
turity is a little oversold as a virtue.
And. of course, those that place a premi
um on conventional thinking have precisely
the opposite reaction to the unconventional
