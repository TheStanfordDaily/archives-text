# Sophomoric

My legions of stalkers, super tans and
acolytes may have noticed that
Sketch" has been missing for a
month. This is because, in the paper that
publishes anything (including regular non
sense from that sketchy grad student), I
managed to be inappropriate.
Perhaps inappropriate isn't quite the
right word. I wrote on a topic of consider
able interest to all of us (and one regularly
mentioned by Hie Daily), but I took a posi
tion outside the mainstream and sneeringly
dismissed my imaginary opponents.
My lovely editors (seriously,they're both
adorable) weren't as impressed with my
magnum opus as I was and. right or wrong,
they kicked it to the curb. Iliey argued,
among many other things, that when pre
senting complex and sensitive subjects, air
ing multiple sides to a debate is essential —
if one is going to offer an opinion on a seri
ous issue, one has an obligation to explain
exactly why one is wrong.
Still, as my frustration subsided. I real
ized a couple of things. First off, maybe they
were light — censorship and all that is an
involved subject (perhaps even one for fu
ture contemplation) and the passing of
judgment is not necessarily always unac
ceptable.
Secondly, as I reread my prose, it oc
curred to me that the appropriateness of
opinions was rich and fertile ground for me
the ramble on for a few hundred words
without causing a flutter.This is lucky, since
the only things on my mind riuht now aren't

really tit for non-physicist (i.e. human) con
sumption.
1 was going to write that as you get older,
opinions become less diverse, hut after a lit
tle thought, I'm not really sure that's true.
Opinions certainly become more rigid
(there's a great deal of truth in that old
chestnut about broad minds, narrow waists
and their middle age exchange), but they
preserve much of their spread.
No. I think a more accurate observation
is that the center becomes much more
sharply defined. On any given issue there is
a conventional point of view (or a couple of
them) and then there are the lunatic fringes.
Now. whilst there are advantages to this
it's much more efficient to find a com
promise if you ignore most of the ideas — I
find it rather depressing. If it's a sign of ma
turity to close one's mind, then perhaps ma
turity is a little oversold as a virtue.
And. of course, those that place a premi
um on conventional thinking have precisely
the opposite reaction to the unconventional

thinking so prevalent amongst the
young, rhey mock. They denigrate.
And they sneer.
There's even word for it. They
take a label for your status, and
change it into a put-down, an insult.
Its a delicious word. Loaded with
contempt, a sneer built in and a
warm feeling of superiority that suf
fuses through your body as you whis
per it in your mind. Sophomoric. Ah,
there s nothing quite like looking
down...
Given an opportunity, we like to
peer at the hoi polloi from lofty
heights and to savor our exalted sta
tus. Even when we don't believe in
our own supremacy and determined
ly insist we're just like everyone else,
our generosity of spirit is an illusion
— we rise above the petty fray in
order to look down upon it.
1 hesitate to make broad general
izations (which is unusual for me, 1
know), but 1 think there is a large
section of the graduate student pop
ulation that fervently believes in the
immaturity (and consequent inferi

ority) of undergraduates.
Now, since I'm often guilty of this
myself, let me not condemn such su
perciliousness out of hand. 1 mean
we don't think less of the undergrad
uate population as people, just of
their minds. What's more, it's true.
Maturity in the modern world is
being pushed back later and later, it's
not surprising that 27 can find you
considerably more thoughtful than
18.
On the other hand, I've been on
both sides of this particular divide.
My opinions at 18 were absolutely,
incontrovertibly correct and even
though they've now changed vastly
(but are,of course, still absolutely, in
controvertibly correct), I miss the
flexibility of my youthful mind.
Plus, there's no smooth transition.
I've thought stupid things that 1
would now dismiss as ridiculously
childish as recently as yesterday af
ternoon. Given that, how do we
know when this nirvana of mature
thought is reached?
As much as 1 enjoy mocking the
perceived idiocy of youth. I admire a
great deal more. Smiling indulgently
at childish thoughts, laughing at the
earnest belief that one can shape the
world, mocking gently (or otherwise)
the notion that one can be truly dif

ferent are all deeply satisfying activi
ties. But ultimately, they leave me hol
low.
I enjoy viewing myself as a wise
old man (and. yes, 1 know that's
ridiculous) dispensing wisdom on
how the world works, gently correct
ing the foolish misconceptions of
youth and all that. However, that's
not entirely reasonable.
Perhaps, rather than telling you
what to think, more useful advice
would be to embrace your sopho
moric tendencies firmly while you
have the chance. Hold obnoxious,
absurd opinions and defend them
and your right to hold them. Point
out to those who would sneer that
twisted lips are not an argument,
nor is repetition of the word "obvi
ous".
There are many great things
about getting older (well, actually,
there are none, but there could be),
but the closing of one's mind is not
one of them. Even if you give up the
casual sex, the daytime drinking and
the recreational drugs, try not to leap
at the label of maturity too quickly.
