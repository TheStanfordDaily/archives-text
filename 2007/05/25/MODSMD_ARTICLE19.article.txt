# The best and worst of Stanford
## 
### 
A top-four list is unusual. Let me ex
plain why this isn't a top-five or top
ten sort of deal. I have kept a journal
during my time at Stanford, and recently I
went through my entries. 1 found that each
year I seem to pick one thing to complain
about and one thing to exalt in regards to my
experiences at Stanford. And the things that
I tend to harp on are not the usual suspects
sadly. President Hennessy, you are not a
frequent presence in my journals. Below are
my favorite and least favorite things about
Stanford, ranked b\ the class year that I was
especially fired-up about them:
I 'hi' Bottom lour
Freshman Year: Failing. At everything.
All the time. Remember being good at
things? Kids in high school would ask you
what you got on math problems and have
you proof-read their essays. Then you got
your first B at Stanford... and it was only the
beginning. Lessons in humility are a valu
able part of growing up. but getting your ego
continually crushed by your TA can get a bit
old.
Sophomore Year: Inhumane and poorly
planned campus buildings. (Clearly, this was
the year that I declared as Architectural De
sign.) Who decided that Stanford should be
comprised of dorms that act like bunkers

and buildings that are flagrantly irresponsi
ble? Example: Manzanita.The complex may
have its staunch following of studious inhab
itants. but for the most part, Manzanita,
we 11... simply put. it sucks. Where else is it
okay to ignore your neighbor all year? If
pod-people invaded Stanford, they would
choose to live in Manzanita.The sprawling
compound has no soul, no spirit. I know that
it's cheaper to build uniform dorms with
high carrying capacity, but there's a reason
that undergraduates will claw each other's
faces off to get on the Row: It's one of the
few places on campus that can feel like a
home. Greg Boardman. if you're worried
that students feel isolated at Stanford,
please stop building dorms that treat people
like lab rats. We were made to do more than
eat. sleep and study in total isolation.
