# The 						best and worst of Stanford
## 
### 
A top-four list is unusual. Let me ex
plain why this isn't a top-five or top
ten sort of deal. I have kept a journal
during my time at Stanford, and recently I
went through my entries. 1 found that each
year I seem to pick one thing to complain
about and one thing to exalt in regards to my
experiences at Stanford. And the things that
I tend to harp on are not the usual suspects
sadly. President Hennessy, you are not a
frequent presence in my journals. Below are
my favorite and least favorite things about
Stanford, ranked b\ the class year that I was
especially fired-up about them:
I 'hi' Bottom lour
Freshman Year: Failing. At everything.
All the time. Remember being good at
things? Kids in high school would ask you
what you got on math problems and have
you proof-read their essays. Then you got
your first B at Stanford... and it was only the
beginning. Lessons in humility are a valu
able part of growing up. but getting your ego
continually crushed by your TA can get a bit
old.
Sophomore Year: Inhumane and poorly
planned campus buildings. (Clearly, this was
the year that I declared as Architectural De
sign.) Who decided that Stanford should be
comprised of dorms that act like bunkers

and buildings that are flagrantly irresponsi
ble? Example: Manzanita.The complex may
have its staunch following of studious inhab
itants. but for the most part, Manzanita,
we 11... simply put. it sucks. Where else is it
okay to ignore your neighbor all year? If
pod-people invaded Stanford, they would
choose to live in Manzanita.The sprawling
compound has no soul, no spirit. I know that
it's cheaper to build uniform dorms with
high carrying capacity, but there's a reason
that undergraduates will claw each other's
faces off to get on the Row: It's one of the
few places on campus that can feel like a
home. Greg Boardman. if you're worried
that students feel isolated at Stanford,
please stop building dorms that treat people
like lab rats. We were made to do more than
eat. sleep and study in total isolation.

Sick Sad World
Junior Year: Cause Chasers. You
know the type. Your freshman year
they were the ones who joined
SLAC their first week of school and
covered your bathroom stalls in
pedantic leaflets. They became vege
tarians, then vegans, then missed
meat and decided to move on to an
other cause. 20()5 was a big year for
them, what with the tsunami and
then Hurricane Katrina. They make
groups to battle one kind of social ill,
serve as the founding President, quit
when their term is up, and then
promptly start another group on
which to act as self-righteous dicta
tor. They preach. They cajole. They
judge your gas-guzzling car, your
Nikes and your MS&E degree. Many
then go on to sell their souls in Wash
ington.
Senior Year: The Stanford Salad.
Picture a salad left to sit out and set
tle at a BBQ. The dressing and the
nuts fall to the bottom, maybe some
dried fruit sifts to the middle, and the
lettuce floats on top. We, the Stan
ford student body, are this salad. We
came to Stanford hopeful to be inter
act as equals, but we leave as a sepa
rated student body. Diverse fresh
man dorms separate out into homog

enous draw groups. Your friends
from IHUM section get replaced by
your chemistry lab partners. You join
a sorority, an athletics team. The
Daily. Suddenly, all of your friends
are just like you. 1 get that it is nice to
be surrounded by a network of
friends who understand you. but it is
eerie that no African-Americans live
in my house and that 1 only have two
friends who are listed as "conserva
tive" on Facebook.
The Top:
Freshman Year: The people, Yup.
completely cheesy and expected.
But, come on! 1 will always remem
ber talking to people in the J-Ro
hallway during Admit Weekend, and
realizing that I had found my new
home. Granted, we have our quirks,
but 1 am constantly and profoundly
impressed by my peers here. Sure,
they're smart,but they're passionate,
creative, and damn funny, too. 1 met
friends for life at Stanford.
Sophomore Year: Stanford never
gives up on you. It is damn hard to
get kicked out of Stanford. We have
counselors, we have free tutors, and
we have quite possibly the world's
most forgiving academic probation
system. Even if you mess up really
badly, few things are ever perma
nent — worst case scenario, you are
asked to take time off. Bless the
Stanford bureaucracy for supplying
its students with every form of sup

port they could ever ask for — we
even have free psychological coun
seling. for goodness sake! When else
in your life will you have access to
free therapy sessions? Never, that's
when.
Junior Year: Money, baby. Stan
ford will give you money to do any
thing — all you have to do is ask.and
ask in the right way. You want to go
to Iceland and photograph thermal
springs? Great! Here's four thou
sand dollars. You want to go to the
San Francisco Opera? Here are the
tickets. Don't know what to do this
summer? How about a paid intern
ship in Germany, working for
whomever you want. I can't believe
the things that 1 have gotten to do
while at Stanford, and 1 can't believe
how easily the money has been pro
vided. My experiences outweigh the
cost of tuition, hands down. And. as
we all know, that's saying a lot.
Senior Year: Stanford Secret
Spaces. The magnetic wall, steam
tunnels, the cave. The Jacuzzi, the
cactus garden, the river, the roofs of
certain buildings. Frost at night.
Stone River. Places whose secrecy 1
guard so fiercely that letting you
know about them would destroy
their allure. We're the Winchester
Mystery I louse of college campuses,
and it's freaking awesome.
