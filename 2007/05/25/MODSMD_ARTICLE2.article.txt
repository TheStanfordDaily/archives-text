Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says it.
Administrators expect it:The former provost will
be back at Stanford in 2009.
The future plans of Rice — who is on-leave as
a political science professor and Hoover Institu
tion senior fellow while serving in Washington —
have been the subject of intense speculation in
the Stanford community. During her visit to the
Hewlett Packard (HP) labs in Palo Alto yester
day, Rice said she expected to reenter academia
when she completes her duties in Washington.
"We talked a little bit about the need for fur
ther education of our engineering and math-sci
ence graduates," she said after touring HP,
"something that I'm particularly interested in as
a professor, former professor, soon-to-be future
professor again."
With these words. Rice hinted at a prospect
that many at Stanford hope will come true, some
doubt will last and a few approach with criticism.
Rice's role
In recent interviews with The Daily, faculty
and administrators largely agreed that Rice will
come back to the University, but were less certain
what role she will play upon her return.
Political Science Prof. Steven Krasner, who
worked with Rice as director of policy planning
at the State Department,said the former provost

has told him she plans to come back.
"She's said publicly and also said privately
that right now her intention is to return," he said.
But President John Hennessy said he could
not make specific predictions about her position
at the University should she return to Stanford.
"We have not discussed what role she might
have and will probably not have this discussion
until she returns," he said in an email to The
Daily,"but Dr. Rice's stated interest is in return
ing to teaching and research. As far as 1 know, no
one from department chair to Provost and Presi
dent has discussed the subject."
Several University affiliates — including His
tory Prof. David Kennedy '63, Provost John
Etcheniendy Ph.D. '82 and Hoover Institution
Director John Raisian — assumed that if Rice
does come back, she will focus on writing her
memoir rather than teaching.
"1 do think she will return," Etcheniendy said
in an email toThe Daily. "My guess is that she will
not teach in her first year back, since anyone who
holds a job as overwhelming as hers needs at
least a year to decompress. She will probably
spend that year recording her reflections about
her terms as National Security Advisor and Sec
retary of State."
Raisian said Rice might focus on her role at
Hoover.
"If she chose not to teach but to be a full time
