# Condi eyes return, BUT IN WHAT ROLE?
## 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says it.
Administrators expect it:The former provost will
be back at Stanford in 2009.
The future plans of Rice — who is on-leave as
a political science professor and Hoover Institu
tion senior fellow while serving in Washington —
have been the subject of intense speculation in
the Stanford community. During her visit to the
Hewlett Packard (HP) labs in Palo Alto yester
day, Rice said she expected to reenter academia
when she completes her duties in Washington.
"We talked a little bit about the need for fur
ther education of our engineering and math-sci
ence graduates," she said after touring HP,
"something that I'm particularly interested in as
a professor, former professor, soon-to-be future
professor again."
With these words. Rice hinted at a prospect
that many at Stanford hope will come true, some
doubt will last and a few approach with criticism.
Rice's role
In recent interviews with The Daily, faculty
and administrators largely agreed that Rice will
come back to the University, but were less certain
what role she will play upon her return.
Political Science Prof. Steven Krasner, who
worked with Rice as director of policy planning
at the State Department,said the former provost

has told him she plans to come back.
"She's said publicly and also said privately
that right now her intention is to return," he said.
But President John Hennessy said he could
not make specific predictions about her position
at the University should she return to Stanford.
"We have not discussed what role she might
have and will probably not have this discussion
until she returns," he said in an email to The
Daily,"but Dr. Rice's stated interest is in return
ing to teaching and research. As far as 1 know, no
one from department chair to Provost and Presi
dent has discussed the subject."
Several University affiliates — including His
tory Prof. David Kennedy '63, Provost John
Etcheniendy Ph.D. '82 and Hoover Institution
Director John Raisian — assumed that if Rice
does come back, she will focus on writing her
memoir rather than teaching.
"1 do think she will return," Etcheniendy said
in an email toThe Daily. "My guess is that she will
not teach in her first year back, since anyone who
holds a job as overwhelming as hers needs at
least a year to decompress. She will probably
spend that year recording her reflections about
her terms as National Security Advisor and Sec
retary of State."
Raisian said Rice might focus on her role at
Hoover.
"If she chose not to teach but to be a full time

researcher, then she'll spend all of
her time on her agenda " he said.
"We may create some things we'd
like her to do — 1 couldn't begin to
think about what that would be —
but basically she would come and
she would be supported. George
Shultz was the former Secretary of
State and he has a tremendous lead
ership role."
Still. Newsweek's Marcus Mabry
who wrote the just-released bi
ography of Rice entitled "Twice as
Good: Condoleeza Rice and her
Path to Power" — said that though
he expects Rice to return to Stan
ford. the secretary of state does not
firmly commit to her long-term
goals.
"She believes that God has al
ready set a path for each of us." he
said. "She does not believe in plan
ning. Condoleeza Rice has not had a
long-term goal since she failed in
her only long-term goal — which
was to be a concert pianist. She has
not decided, as she told me for the
book, what she's going to do in Jan.
2(X)9."
Raisian agreed with Mabry, but

said the Hoover Institution would
welcome her back with open arms.
"Condi's the kind of person that
concentrates on the task at hand
and thinks about transitions when
they're much closer to happening,"
he said, "but we're wide open to
welcoming her back. We'd love to
have her full-time or part-time. I
think there's a very high probability
we'll have her back."
Will she slay?
Though she expects to return to
Stanford as a professor. Rice is un
likely to stay for long, according to
pundits and a number of I Jniversity
affiliates.
"There's no question she'll come
back to Stanford in Jan. 2009,"
Mabry said."How long she'll stay at
Stanford — that's the question. I
think she'll be affiliated with Stan
ford her whole life. Will she stay as a
mere professor for the next 30
years? I don't think so. That will
never happen."
While some Americans might ex
pect Rice to eventually seek the Re
publican nomination for president.
Krasner mostly debunked such
speculation.
"She's always said she wasn't in
terested in public office when she's
had opportunities in the past." he
said. "No one knows what will hap

pen. But no. 1 don't see her thinking
about that actively. Would she come
back when her intention was to run
for the presidency in 2012? No. I
don't think so. Could that happen?
Yeah."
Mabry, too, speculated about
Rice's future political possibilities.
"She may have a political future,
as the governor of California, per
haps, or vice president of the United
States, or. perhaps one day. presi
dent. though not in 'OS." he said.
"She may get in '08 as a vice presi
dent. If you see Hillary/Obama on
the Democrat side, you may see
Rice getting tapped."
Kennedy also said that while a
position as a University president
would be a logical choice for Rice,
the secretary has made it clear that
such a post does not interest her. I le
added that she has expressed inter
est in a job on Wall Street, but he
said with certainty that he could not
imagine her remaining at Stanford
for the rest of her career.
"I'd be surprised if she were con
tent to live out her days in the
groves of academia." he said. "She's
still a young woman. Stanford —
she's been here, done that. This
would be a wonderful place for her
to take a deep breath."
Krasner said he thought Rice
might seriously reconsider her deci

sion last year to turn down the job of
National Football League (NFL)
commissioner.
"Here's someone with tremen
dous experience, tremendous tal
ent." he said. "It's not clear what will
happen to her over the next 10 years.
If the NFL commissioner job sud
denly came open again. I think she'd
think about that very seriously."
Reaction to Rice
Professors who spoke to The
Daily about Rice generally ex
pressed a positive reaction to her re
turn. though some were quick to
point out that she made enemies by
taking hard-line stances when she
was provost from 1993 to 1999.
Krasner said he has come to ad
mire Rice during his time working
with her at both the State Depart
ment and at Stanford.
"At an individual level, she's ex
tremely impressive," he said. "As
Secretary of State, you have to make
a lot of decisions in a short period of
time. I think she's extremely adept
at doing that. She's a strikingly
grounded and decent person, and
that hasn't changed in all of the
years I've known her."
Kennedy praised Rice as a gifted
and promising individual.
"I can remember from the first
time I met her thinking she was an

exceptionally poised and articulate
person beyond her years," he said.
"She had a manner about her that
was quite extraordinary. She was
marked for some kind of success
from early in her academic career."
But not everyone will welcome
Rice with open arms. A number of
faculty members spoke about tense
relationships that characterized lum
tenure as provost.
Kennedy recalled an infamous
episode in which Rice squared oil
against former Political Science
Prof. Susan Okin, who wanted to
give weight to women in tenure de
cisions.
"Condi just kept batting her
down," Kennedy said. "I just said
something about. I really admire
the position you took there." She
said. 'After you've talked the
Ukrainians out of their nuclear ;n
senal, this was nothing." For all of
the high temper of the academic
scene, she had been playing for a lot
bigger stakes. She's taken on a lot ol
big jobs and done them well."
Emeritus History Prof. Paul
Seaver chaired a committee that
shaped the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues (CIV) program, which focused,
in part, on non-Western cultures.
Seaver recalled his frustration when
Rice eliminated the ('IV program in
favor of the current Introduction to

the Humanities (IHUM) curricu
lum.
"She was very authoritarian," he
saitl. " Hie final confrontation over
the ( IV program was before a com
mittee of some people from the
11 acuity | Senate and so on. and in
the course of her attack on the CIV
program, she said ethnicity and gen
der and class are so '80s."
"There was a kind of universal
sigh of relief when she left." Seaver
added. "I think people who remem
ber all of that will not be happy to
see her. That's true of ethnic faculty
who had more run-ins with her than
any of the rest of us. Our women fac
ulty black faculty in particular
and Hispanic faculty do not have
fond memories."
Though some disputed Rice's
popularity, the former provost's re
turn to Stanford will undoubtedly
be both controversial and historical.
Maluy said that Rice herself knows
she may face criticism even from
her own students.
" Illere will be people who will
always criticize her policy and poli
tics.'' Mabry said. "She's sure she'll
oversee some dissertations by Ph.D.
candidates about the mistakes in
this administration."

ence graduates," she said after touring HP,
"something that I'm particularly interested in as
a professor, former professor, soon-to-be future
professor again."
With these words. Rice hinted at a prospect
that many at Stanford hope will come true, some
doubt will last and a few approach with criticism.
Rice's role
In recent interviews with The Daily, faculty
and administrators largely agreed that Rice will
come back to the University, but were less certain
what role she will play upon her return.
Political Science Prof. Steven Krasner, who
worked with Rice as director of policy planning
at the State Department,said the former provost

has told him she plans to come back.
"She's said publicly and also said privately
that right now her intention is to return," he said.
But President John Hennessy said he could
not make specific predictions about her position
at the University should she return to Stanford.
"We have not discussed what role she might
have and will probably not have this discussion
until she returns," he said in an email to The
Daily,"but Dr. Rice's stated interest is in return
ing to teaching and research. As far as 1 know, no
one from department chair to Provost and Presi
dent has discussed the subject."
Several University affiliates — including His
tory Prof. David Kennedy '63, Provost John
Etcheniendy Ph.D. '82 and Hoover Institution
Director John Raisian — assumed that if Rice
does come back, she will focus on writing her
memoir rather than teaching.
"1 do think she will return," Etcheniendy said
in an email toThe Daily. "My guess is that she will
not teach in her first year back, since anyone who
holds a job as overwhelming as hers needs at
least a year to decompress. She will probably
spend that year recording her reflections about
her terms as National Security Advisor and Sec
retary of State."
Raisian said Rice might focus on her role at
Hoover.
"If she chose not to teach but to be a full time

researcher, then she'll spend all of
her time on her agenda " he said.
"We may create some things we'd
like her to do — 1 couldn't begin to
think about what that would be —
but basically she would come and
she would be supported. George
Shultz was the former Secretary of
State and he has a tremendous lead
ership role."
Still. Newsweek's Marcus Mabry
who wrote the just-released bi
ography of Rice entitled "Twice as
Good: Condoleeza Rice and her
Path to Power" — said that though
he expects Rice to return to Stan
ford. the secretary of state does not
firmly commit to her long-term
goals.
"She believes that God has al
ready set a path for each of us." he
said. "She does not believe in plan
ning. Condoleeza Rice has not had a
long-term goal since she failed in
her only long-term goal — which
was to be a concert pianist. She has
not decided, as she told me for the
book, what she's going to do in Jan.
2(X)9."
Raisian agreed with Mabry, but

said the Hoover Institution would
welcome her back with open arms.
"Condi's the kind of person that
concentrates on the task at hand
and thinks about transitions when
they're much closer to happening,"
he said, "but we're wide open to
welcoming her back. We'd love to
have her full-time or part-time. I
think there's a very high probability
we'll have her back."
Will she slay?
Though she expects to return to
Stanford as a professor. Rice is un
likely to stay for long, according to
pundits and a number of I Jniversity
affiliates.
"There's no question she'll come
back to Stanford in Jan. 2009,"
Mabry said."How long she'll stay at
Stanford — that's the question. I
think she'll be affiliated with Stan
ford her whole life. Will she stay as a
mere professor for the next 30
years? I don't think so. That will
never happen."
While some Americans might ex
pect Rice to eventually seek the Re
publican nomination for president.
Krasner mostly debunked such
speculation.
"She's always said she wasn't in
terested in public office when she's
had opportunities in the past." he
said. "No one knows what will hap

pen. But no. 1 don't see her thinking
about that actively. Would she come
back when her intention was to run
for the presidency in 2012? No. I
don't think so. Could that happen?
Yeah."
Mabry, too, speculated about
Rice's future political possibilities.
"She may have a political future,
as the governor of California, per
haps, or vice president of the United
States, or. perhaps one day. presi
dent. though not in 'OS." he said.
"She may get in '08 as a vice presi
dent. If you see Hillary/Obama on
the Democrat side, you may see
Rice getting tapped."
Kennedy also said that while a
position as a University president
would be a logical choice for Rice,
the secretary has made it clear that
such a post does not interest her. I le
added that she has expressed inter
est in a job on Wall Street, but he
said with certainty that he could not
imagine her remaining at Stanford
for the rest of her career.
"I'd be surprised if she were con
tent to live out her days in the
groves of academia." he said. "She's
still a young woman. Stanford —
she's been here, done that. This
would be a wonderful place for her
to take a deep breath."
Krasner said he thought Rice
might seriously reconsider her deci

sion last year to turn down the job of
National Football League (NFL)
commissioner.
"Here's someone with tremen
dous experience, tremendous tal
ent." he said. "It's not clear what will
happen to her over the next 10 years.
If the NFL commissioner job sud
denly came open again. I think she'd
think about that very seriously."
Reaction to Rice
Professors who spoke to The
Daily about Rice generally ex
pressed a positive reaction to her re
turn. though some were quick to
point out that she made enemies by
taking hard-line stances when she
was provost from 1993 to 1999.
Krasner said he has come to ad
mire Rice during his time working
with her at both the State Depart
ment and at Stanford.
"At an individual level, she's ex
tremely impressive," he said. "As
Secretary of State, you have to make
a lot of decisions in a short period of
time. I think she's extremely adept
at doing that. She's a strikingly
grounded and decent person, and
that hasn't changed in all of the
years I've known her."
Kennedy praised Rice as a gifted
and promising individual.
"I can remember from the first
time I met her thinking she was an

exceptionally poised and articulate
person beyond her years," he said.
"She had a manner about her that
was quite extraordinary. She was
marked for some kind of success
from early in her academic career."
But not everyone will welcome
Rice with open arms. A number of
faculty members spoke about tense
relationships that characterized lum
tenure as provost.
Kennedy recalled an infamous
episode in which Rice squared oil
against former Political Science
Prof. Susan Okin, who wanted to
give weight to women in tenure de
cisions.
"Condi just kept batting her
down," Kennedy said. "I just said
something about. I really admire
the position you took there." She
said. 'After you've talked the
Ukrainians out of their nuclear ;n
senal, this was nothing." For all of
the high temper of the academic
scene, she had been playing for a lot
bigger stakes. She's taken on a lot ol
big jobs and done them well."
Emeritus History Prof. Paul
Seaver chaired a committee that
shaped the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues (CIV) program, which focused,
in part, on non-Western cultures.
Seaver recalled his frustration when
Rice eliminated the ('IV program in
favor of the current Introduction to

the Humanities (IHUM) curricu
lum.
"She was very authoritarian," he
saitl. " Hie final confrontation over
the ( IV program was before a com
mittee of some people from the
11 acuity | Senate and so on. and in
the course of her attack on the CIV
program, she said ethnicity and gen
der and class are so '80s."
"There was a kind of universal
sigh of relief when she left." Seaver
added. "I think people who remem
ber all of that will not be happy to
see her. That's true of ethnic faculty
who had more run-ins with her than
any of the rest of us. Our women fac
ulty black faculty in particular
and Hispanic faculty do not have
fond memories."
Though some disputed Rice's
popularity, the former provost's re
turn to Stanford will undoubtedly
be both controversial and historical.
Maluy said that Rice herself knows
she may face criticism even from
her own students.
" Illere will be people who will
always criticize her policy and poli
tics.'' Mabry said. "She's sure she'll
oversee some dissertations by Ph.D.
candidates about the mistakes in
this administration."

The future plans of Rice — who is on-leave as

the Stanford community. During her visit to the
