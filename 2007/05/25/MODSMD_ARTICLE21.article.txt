# An ode to academic advising

Stop spraying the trees and fill Lake Lag.
Caterpillars and tiger salamanders are
no longer the only endangered species
on this campus.
Earlier this month, the University an
nounced that HPACs (very infrequently also
known as Head Peer Academic Coordina
tors) may soon be scarcer than alcohol in
freshman dorms.
Unlike alcohol, which can be surreptitious
ly (or not so surreptitiously) snuck into Stern
and consumed behind closed (or slightly ajar)
doors, the H PAC is an entity of the University's
own making — and hence not easily repro
duceable with the help of the friendly look
the-other-way vendors at Ernie's or Miyake.
The University's trial elimination of the
position, according to Monday's Daily edito
rial. is "an effort to address inconsistent ad
vising at the undergraduate level."This ques
tionable rationale not only ignores the fact
that the University itself creates the problem
when it selects and trains these inconsistent
individuals, it also reduces the multi-faceted
position to a single function — one which is

not, at the end of many days/years/college ca
reers, its most important.
My HAA (as in previous columns, my use
of acronyms dates me; the Head Academic
Advisor title morphed in 2001) was the first
staff member 1 met in my freshman dorm. In
fact, he was virtually the only staff member I
met in my freshman dorm. While the R As and
the RCC were nice and fun and so forth. Jake,
my HAA, minored in English (my eventual
major), lived next door to me and seemingly
kept his door open 24/7. These were all quali
ties the rest of the staff did not share.
Jake was only a junior,but he was the mas
ter of his academic domain. At his small rural

high school in Westmoreland. Kansas, his AP
History class consisted of him. a room, and a
copy of the American Pageant. At Stanford,
he became a premed Bio major, wrote short
stories (one of which won the Creative Writ
ing department's award his senior year),
played in the hand, and worked in a lab until
he graduated — at which point he joined the
Peace Corps for two years before heading off
to med school at Columbia. A poster child of
academic success if there ever was one.
But neither Jake's CPA nor his impressive
coordination of professor dinners, study
breaks, and other academic dorm programs
support my main point here. The best evi
dence is that on more than one occasion, Jake
returned to his room to find multiple individ
uals (OK. girls) sleeping on his couch and in
his bed. And not (on his part) for the inappro
priate reasons that come to mind.To say that
my HAA/HPAC was twice as present and
Stanford-career-impacting as any other staff
member would be a serious understatement.
