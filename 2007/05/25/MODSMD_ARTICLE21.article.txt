# An ode to academic advising
## 
### 
Stop spraying the trees and fill Lake Lag.
Caterpillars and tiger salamanders are
no longer the only endangered species
on this campus.
Earlier this month, the University an
nounced that HPACs (very infrequently also
known as Head Peer Academic Coordina
tors) may soon be scarcer than alcohol in
freshman dorms.
Unlike alcohol, which can be surreptitious
ly (or not so surreptitiously) snuck into Stern
and consumed behind closed (or slightly ajar)
doors, the H PAC is an entity of the University's
own making — and hence not easily repro
duceable with the help of the friendly look
the-other-way vendors at Ernie's or Miyake.
The University's trial elimination of the
position, according to Monday's Daily edito
rial. is "an effort to address inconsistent ad
vising at the undergraduate level."This ques
tionable rationale not only ignores the fact
that the University itself creates the problem
when it selects and trains these inconsistent
individuals, it also reduces the multi-faceted
position to a single function — one which is

not, at the end of many days/years/college ca
reers, its most important.
My HAA (as in previous columns, my use
of acronyms dates me; the Head Academic
Advisor title morphed in 2001) was the first
staff member 1 met in my freshman dorm. In
fact, he was virtually the only staff member I
met in my freshman dorm. While the R As and
the RCC were nice and fun and so forth. Jake,
my HAA, minored in English (my eventual
major), lived next door to me and seemingly
kept his door open 24/7. These were all quali
ties the rest of the staff did not share.
Jake was only a junior,but he was the mas
ter of his academic domain. At his small rural

high school in Westmoreland. Kansas, his AP
History class consisted of him. a room, and a
copy of the American Pageant. At Stanford,
he became a premed Bio major, wrote short
stories (one of which won the Creative Writ
ing department's award his senior year),
played in the hand, and worked in a lab until
he graduated — at which point he joined the
Peace Corps for two years before heading off
to med school at Columbia. A poster child of
academic success if there ever was one.
But neither Jake's CPA nor his impressive
coordination of professor dinners, study
breaks, and other academic dorm programs
support my main point here. The best evi
dence is that on more than one occasion, Jake
returned to his room to find multiple individ
uals (OK. girls) sleeping on his couch and in
his bed. And not (on his part) for the inappro
priate reasons that come to mind.To say that
my HAA/HPAC was twice as present and
Stanford-career-impacting as any other staff
member would be a serious understatement.



To expect that the already-over
burdened RAs will simply "pick up
the slack" is ridiculous, even if the
University replaces the HPAC with
an additional RA. Rather than nu
merous weeks of HPAC training,
RAs will, presumably, receive a day
or two of academic advising training.
Won't that just create more inconsis
tencies?
Beyond their personal contribu
tions to freshman dorms, MPACs
also serve as the link to the entire
freshman advising system — the
PMs and AAs (previously PAAs,
A As, and FAs. In the interest of di
versity, all Stanford acronyms are,
apparently, composed of the word
"advisor" attached to "peer," "aca
demic," and/or "faculty"). I presume

that this team, assigned to freshmen
before they arrive on campus, will
continue to exist — though 1 can't
imagine how.
Despite Jake's attempts to locate
my MIA A A. I can count our inter
actions on one hand — most of
which occurred during Orientation.
Based on a very informal poll, 1
think it's safe to say that my AA ex
perience was par for Stanford's
course. Unlike HPACs, who make a
year-long commitment to eat, sleep
and breathe alongside their fresh
men. PMs often sign up because it
sounds like a fun idea at the time. As
soon as the PMs' own academic
going gets rough or, more often, as
soon as Orientation ends and their
friends arrive, the responsibility
drops to the same space it occupies
on their resume — the bottom of a
very long list. Abandoning ship is
much easier when you don't live
down the hall; hell, for at least the
first two quarters, most freshmen

can barely find their way home, let
alone locate some obscure Row
House.
As a former PAA. Peer Mentor
in the English major, and Bridge
counselor, as well as a current unof
ficial advisor to my little brother and
his friends, I am living proof that ac
ademic advising happens all over
this campus — formally and infor
mally, accurately and inaccurately. If
the University eliminates the HPAC
position, other people will fill in the
gaps, for better or worse. It takes
more than a little help from our
friends to make it through our four
years here and everyone, especially
freshmen, is more likely to turn to
the almost-peers with whom we
have the most contact. Given that,
doesn't it make the most sense for
the University to train a few to help
us help ourselves?

going gets rough or, more often, as
soon as Orientation ends and their
friends arrive, the responsibility
drops to the same space it occupies
on their resume — the bottom of a
very long list. Abandoning ship is
much easier when you don't live
down the hall; hell, for at least the
first two quarters, most freshmen

can barely find their way home, let
alone locate some obscure Row
House.
As a former PAA. Peer Mentor
in the English major, and Bridge
counselor, as well as a current unof
ficial advisor to my little brother and
his friends, I am living proof that ac
ademic advising happens all over
this campus — formally and infor
mally, accurately and inaccurately. If
the University eliminates the HPAC
position, other people will fill in the
gaps, for better or worse. It takes
more than a little help from our
friends to make it through our four
years here and everyone, especially
freshmen, is more likely to turn to
the almost-peers with whom we
have the most contact. Given that,
doesn't it make the most sense for
the University to train a few to help
us help ourselves?
