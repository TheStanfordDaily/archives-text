Let's set the record straight: The Stanford
alumni effort to support the ExxonMobil
shareholder proposal on greenhouse gas re
ductions ("Ad Campaign Within Exxon's
Rights," May 23, 2(K)7) does not undermine
Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Pro
jcct (GCEP).
GCEP is an important research project
addressing complex climate change issues.
However, that does not mean that Stanford
alumni should stand by silently as Exxon ex
ploits its support for GCEP as a "fig leaf" to
hide its inaction on climate solutions. Other
GCEP funding partners (notably GE and
Toyota) are already making major invest
ments to reduce their greenhouse gas emis
sions. Exxon stands alone among GCEP sup
porters in having no near-term climate plan.
Exxon's donations to GCEP are appreci
ated. However, the University's name and
reputation are not for sale. We should expect
all corporate donors (including Exxon) to
"walk the walk" and be exemplary corporate

citizens. We need to set the bar high and
never allow the University's reputation to be
cheapened by corporate greenwashing. Stan
ford deserves nothing less.

Focus on other Iraq issues
In the past week, both The Daily and
KZSU have published stories about Stan
ford's lack of anti-war protests ("Where have
all the anti-war protests gone?" May 23).
These interviews and articles ask questions
on why there aren't as many protests today as
in the "glory" days of the '60s and '70s during
Vietnam.
According to The Daily, our activism is
"startlingly subdued" and The Daily and
KZSU seem to be scratching their heads at
this anomaly in Stanford's history.
Now that The Daily has told us why we
know a lot about the war and don't care. I chal
lenge The Daily to spend that same energy re
porting on the war's relevance to Stanford.

I want to hear about the Hoover Institu
tion and what they're saying about the Iraq
War. not my own inaction.
I want to hear about Stanford alumni who
are fighting and dying in the war, not more
excuses for apathy.
I want to know more details about the
$105 million military research grant that has
mainly battlefield applications, not my un
willingness to speak out against the war.
I want to read a feature on Iraqi universi
ties and how Iraqi students and even Iraqi-
American students are affected by the war.
not a feature on my own ignorance.
Wednesday's article, "Where have all the
anti-war protests gone?" is more than three
times the length of the May 3 article, "Army
gives Univ. $105 mil. Grant."
I 'm not putting The Daily to blame for our
lack of activism, just challenging it to foster
relevant conversations on Iraq.
