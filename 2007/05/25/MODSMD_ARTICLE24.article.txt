### ELIZABETH PRATT 
In yet another disappointment for Stanford
men's tennis, its top doubles team comprised of
sophomores Blake Muller and Matt Bruch was
forced to withdraw from the NCAA doubles
championship tournament yesterday.

On Wednesday, taking on Mississippi's Er
lingTveit in the first round of the NCAA sin
gles championship. Bruch suffered a sprained
right ankle. While reaching for a wide fore
hand. Bruch pivoted and rolled over the ankle.
The injury prevented him from completing the
match, and he had to retire, down 4-1 in the
first set.
Assistant coach David Hodge had previ
ous!), said that a decision on whether Bruch
and Muller would compete in the doubles con
test would he made yesterday morning, before
first-round doubles action started that after

noon. Hie duo was slated to play its first-round
contest at 2:30 p.m. I DT. Their scheduled op
ponents were Nicolas Delgado and Pedro
Graber of Virginia lech, ranked No. 19 in the
country.
Unfortunately. Bruch's spained ankle
proved too much. Hie team had to withdraw
from the doubles championships, citing the in
jury. and was replaced by an alternate team.
Robbert l.athouwers and Alex Schweizer of
Auburn. No. 35 in the latest college rankings,
will play in the Cardinal tandem's place.
Muller and Bruch are the No. 12 doubles

team in the country. They finished conference
play this season by winning the Pacific-10 Con
ference doubles championship. With the title
behind them, as well as the highest ranking in
the Pac-10, Hodge predicted the tandem would
go deep in the NCAA tourney.
With so much success and the resulting high
expectations, yesterday's end to the season
couldn't be anything but frustrating.
"I really feel for the guys," Hodge said. "It's
a real shame."
