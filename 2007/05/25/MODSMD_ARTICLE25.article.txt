# Oden too nice for the NBA
## 
### 
Standing at seven feet and weigh
ing 280 pounds, Greg Oden is a
beast of a man. His worn face
wears a lull beard that would lead
you to believe he's in his mid-30s. I lis
immense size and strength leave op
ponents both awed and intimidated.
Only l l ) years old. Oden is a freak of
nature, almost sure to be the No. I
pick in the 2007 NBA draft.
Standing at 6-foot-9 and weighing
225 pounds. Kevin Durant is slightly
less of a behemoth.Hie former Texas
forward is long and gangly,still tilling
out his slender frame. He wears a
boyish grin on his round face that
makes you think he's got a high
school prom to go to this weekend.
His offensive skill set and sheer will
dominated collegiate opponents this
year, as he averaged 2(i points and 11
rebounds per game. Still 18 years old.
Durant is likely to be the No. 2 pick in
this year's draft.
Both are freshmen finishing out
their first and last years in college.
Both are classy and talented kids
who represented their respective
universities as best as they could.
Both are the centerpieces of what
many experts believe to be the best
draft in years.
And both deserve all the praise
they've gotten. They're just that
good. But one of them is better. And
it's not who you might think.
With the first pick of the 2007
NBA Draft, the Portland Trail
Blazers select... from the Univer
sity of Texas, Kevin Durant!
At least that's what David Stern
should be saying.
When Portland is on the clock on
draft day they'll have a tough deci
sion to make — Oden-Durant might
be the biggest debate since Lincoln-
Douglas. or at least Carmelo-Le-
Bron.
Oden seems to be to the conven
tional choice, however; a 7-foot mon
ster like him is a rare commodity in a
game ruled by guards.
But don't fool yourself. Durant is
the guy.
There's no doubt in my mind that
Oden would be a solid, if not peren
nial. All-Star player for the Blazers if
they were to draft him. He would
give instant credibility to their team
in the paint, blocking shots and
throwing down dunks.
But Kevin Durant is a star waiting
to happen. I le's a nice-looking, mild
mannered guy off the court. Much
like Oden. he says all the right things
and defers to others. But once he's on
the hardwood, his act is over. I le can

take over a game with his assertive
ness alone.
Sure, Durant has the athleticism,
the reach and the offensive skill set
that most players can only dream of.
But he's got more than just that.
He's got the right stuff: the swagger,
the savvy or whatever you want to
call it.
He had one of the best freshman
years in the history of college bas
ketball,and it wasn't only because of
his physical tools. He had the moxie,
the cockiness and the court pres
ence that only the greatest possess.
Oden is going to be a fantastic
center no matter what. A player of
his physical size, talent and athleti
cism is destined to have a fine career
as long as he stays relatively injury
free.
But Durant isn't going to be just
great. He's going to be up there with
all the greatest — maybe not the
next Bird, Jordan or Kobe, but defi
nitely the next Durant.
Oden has all the physical tools to
be up there, too. But as weird as this
may sound, he's just too nice.
When he was interviewed on
College Gameday back in January,
Oden showed his overwhelming hu
mility when he was asked about his
potential pro career.
"I haven't proven anything yet.
Right now it's really a lot of talk," he
said. "1 mean, I know a couple of
guys right now who are really doing
something, like Kevin Durant."
Yeah, he really did say that.
Even before the NBA Lottery on
Tuesday, Oden was already defer
ring to the Longhorn phenom. It's
very humble of him, but at the same
time, it's just too nice for an NBA
center.
Oden can't be a nice guy. He can't
be Tim Duncan. His game fits the
role of the classic, dominant NBA
center. The model for Oden's game
is none other than the belligerent
and brazen Shaquille O'Neal.
Some might call Shaq conceited,
wearing a Superman "S" on his
shoulder. They also might say he
isn't the nicest guy: He has no reser
vations about cussing out a reporter
on live television after swatting his
minuscule opponents to the tloor. If
you piss off Shaq. you're in a bad
place.
If you piss off Oden? I le'd prob
ably act like a reasonable human
being. And, as absurd as this is going
to sound, that might be his biggest
flaw.
You can say that a player's de
meanor off the court has little to do
with his performance on the court.
And you'd probably be right. But
becoming one of the most physically
commanding NBA centers of all
time (which is what Oden's build
dictates) takes more than just size
and ability.
You need anger. You need to be
pissed off. You need to be like, well,
Shaq.
Which obviously doesn't detract
from Oden as a person. I'm sure that
he's going to represent the NBA 95
percent better than most of its cur
rent players. He'll be an All-Star for
years to come and a hero to many.
But I have a feeling that his ca
reer may leave a lot of us wondering.
"What if?"
And as for Durant: His boyish
smile, his gangly features and his
classy presence are merely a ploy.
The kid's a killer.

Jack Salisbury is dearly hoping that
Greg Odeti doesn't read this. Let him
know if you think that's a smart gam
hie at jaek24@stanford.edu.
