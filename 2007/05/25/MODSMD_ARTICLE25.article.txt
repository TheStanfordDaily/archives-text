# Oden too nice for the NBA
## 
### 
Standing at seven feet and weigh
ing 280 pounds, Greg Oden is a
beast of a man. His worn face
wears a lull beard that would lead
you to believe he's in his mid-30s. I lis
immense size and strength leave op
ponents both awed and intimidated.
Only l l ) years old. Oden is a freak of
nature, almost sure to be the No. I
pick in the 2007 NBA draft.
Standing at 6-foot-9 and weighing
225 pounds. Kevin Durant is slightly
less of a behemoth.Hie former Texas
forward is long and gangly,still tilling
out his slender frame. He wears a
boyish grin on his round face that
makes you think he's got a high
school prom to go to this weekend.
His offensive skill set and sheer will
dominated collegiate opponents this
year, as he averaged 2(i points and 11
rebounds per game. Still 18 years old.
Durant is likely to be the No. 2 pick in
this year's draft.
Both are freshmen finishing out
their first and last years in college.
Both are classy and talented kids
who represented their respective
universities as best as they could.
Both are the centerpieces of what
many experts believe to be the best
draft in years.
And both deserve all the praise
they've gotten. They're just that
good. But one of them is better. And
it's not who you might think.
With the first pick of the 2007
NBA Draft, the Portland Trail
Blazers select... from the Univer
sity of Texas, Kevin Durant!
At least that's what David Stern
should be saying.
When Portland is on the clock on
draft day they'll have a tough deci
sion to make â€” Oden-Durant might
be the biggest debate since Lincoln-
Douglas. or at least Carmelo-Le-
Bron.
Oden seems to be to the conven
tional choice, however; a 7-foot mon
ster like him is a rare commodity in a
game ruled by guards.
But don't fool yourself. Durant is
the guy.
There's no doubt in my mind that
Oden would be a solid, if not peren
nial. All-Star player for the Blazers if
they were to draft him. He would
give instant credibility to their team
in the paint, blocking shots and
throwing down dunks.
But Kevin Durant is a star waiting
to happen. I le's a nice-looking, mild
mannered guy off the court. Much
like Oden. he says all the right things
and defers to others. But once he's on
the hardwood, his act is over. I le can
