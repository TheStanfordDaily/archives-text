# Sweep redemption
## Baseball needs to take three from Trojans to finish at .500 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
At the season's beginning. Stanford baseball
had every reason to expect to be playing well
into June. After notching 29 winning seasons in
the past 30 years, the Cardinal program had
built a long-term record that justified those ex
pectations. But with this weekend's series at
Southern California, Stanford will finish just
short of June â€” and possibly short of a winning
season.
ITie Cardinal needs a sweep of the Trojans
(27-26. (X-13 Pacific-10 Conference) to pull its
overall record back up to .500 to close out the
year. USC previously took two of three from
Stanford (25-28,6-15) this year, in a non-confer
ence series at Sunken Diamond Mar. 9-11.
"I know USC is struggling this year as well,
but they're always a solid ballclub." sophomore
starting pitcher Jeremy Bleich said. "They play
good baseball, and it would be great to end on a
good note for us as a team, and allow us to have
sort of a stable feeling back, going into next
year.
"(The series is| huge for us." he continued.
"It's one of our goals, to get back to .500, but
going into the weekend you can't say '()h. I want

G ' NOilS: The Cardinal will finish its season witf
a three-game set at Southern California, and can
climb back up to .500 with a sweep of the Trojans.
In a previous, non-conference, three-game series
in March, USC took two of three from Stanford,
but was outscored by the Cardinal at Sunken Dia
mond, 22-23. Sophomore lefty Jeremy Bleich,
who has given up just five runs over 16 innings in
his last two starts, will get the call tonight.

Right fielder Michael Taylor has heated up at the plate to power the
Cardinal's offense down the stretch. The junior slugger earned his
first All-Pac-l 0 leam honors on Wednesday.
the sweep." You've got to take it
game by game, and hopefully on
Sunday we end up .500."
Bleich's performance of late has
been key to the Cardinal's recent
turnaround. Stanford has won six of
its last seven contests, and the
southpaw has gone 1-0 with five
runs allowed in lb innings pitched
over that span, lowering his ERA
by almost 60 points to 5.50.
As the starter for Friday night's
contest against the Trojans. Bleich
believes a new mentality has pro
pelled him to his recent success on
the mound.
"[l've been] trying to let the
game come to me." he said. "[l'm]
trying to relax, trying to pitch. I
think in some of my previous out
ings before that I'd get into trouble
and I'd push it. I'd press.The last few
weeks I've just tried to stay even
keeled and stay relaxed."
Another factor in the Cardinal's
return to its winning ways has been
a surging offense. led by junior right
fielder Michael Taylor, sophomore
center fielder Sean Ratliff and jun
ior second baseman Adam Sorgi.
Stanford has been averaging just
over nine runs per game over its
seven-game run of success.
The Cardinal's lone senior, third
baseman Ryan Seawell. has been
making his presence felt in the
lineup as well, raising his average
by 20 points to .283 over the span
while knocking in seven runs. For
several Stanford players, the week
end's series against USC could be
their final collegiate competition,
depending upon when and if they
are selected in the annual MLB

Draft on June 7. Hut Seawell enters
the series as the only team member
who knows his time playing for the
Cardinal is rapidly drawing to a
close.
"It's no different than any other
series for me right now," Seawell
said on Wednesday. "I'm sure it'll
change when I get down there, but
we're just trying to win those three
games and even it up at .500. That's
really all I 'm thinking about."
Of the chance to wipe away the
squad's losing record with a sweep.
Seawell was well aware of the onus
on his shoulders as the Cardinal's
lone senior.
"It's huge; we all want to get
back there [to a .500 record]." he
said."l can't remember the last time
that Stanford baseball finished
under .500, and I definitely don't
want to be the senior during the
year when that happens."
Friday night's opener at USC is
scheduled for 7 p.m., with Satur
day's contest is slated for 1:30 p.m.
and Sunday's for 1 p.m.
The Cardinal received a good
deal of recognition despite its dis
appointing record on Wednesday,
when the All-Pac-10 Team was an
nounced. Taylor. Ratliff and Sorgi
were all named to the first team for
the first time in their respective ca
reers, while sophomore outfielder
Joey August earned honorable
mention.
"We're really excited about these
selections," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess told GoStanford.com. "I
think they're all deserving.and I think
it says something to get these honors,
especially when we didn't have a spec
tacular season. To stand out and per
form well enough to be recognized by
the conference is a credit to them."
