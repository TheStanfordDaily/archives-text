# Sweep redemption
## Baseball needs to take three from Trojans to finish at .500 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
At the season's beginning. Stanford baseball
had every reason to expect to be playing well
into June. After notching 29 winning seasons in
the past 30 years, the Cardinal program had
built a long-term record that justified those ex
pectations. But with this weekend's series at
Southern California, Stanford will finish just
short of June â€” and possibly short of a winning
season.
ITie Cardinal needs a sweep of the Trojans
(27-26. (X-13 Pacific-10 Conference) to pull its
overall record back up to .500 to close out the
year. USC previously took two of three from
Stanford (25-28,6-15) this year, in a non-confer
ence series at Sunken Diamond Mar. 9-11.
"I know USC is struggling this year as well,
but they're always a solid ballclub." sophomore
starting pitcher Jeremy Bleich said. "They play
good baseball, and it would be great to end on a
good note for us as a team, and allow us to have
sort of a stable feeling back, going into next
year.
"(The series is| huge for us." he continued.
"It's one of our goals, to get back to .500, but
going into the weekend you can't say '()h. I want
