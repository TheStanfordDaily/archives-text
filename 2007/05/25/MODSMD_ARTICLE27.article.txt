Sophomore Mari Chun (76-78-71 —225) finally showed signs
of dominance that had been lacking in her previous two rounds
of play. Chun's one-under-par 71 yesterday catapulted her from a
tie for 55th into a tie for 18th. But senior Lauren Todd (70-74-
76—220) is still pacing the Cardinal attack, despite dropping two
places to eighth, while fellow senior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
