# Track sends 40 to NCAA West Regional
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Coming off its phenomenal perform
ance at the Pacific-10 Conference Cham
pionships. the No. 10 Stanford women's
track and field team is headed to Eu
gene. Ore. for the NCAA West Regional
qualifying meet this weekend.
Joined by the unranked men's squad,
the Cardinal women will take on Ari
zona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington in hopes of top-five fin
ishes in individual events and top-three
finishes in race events to secure bids to
June's NCAA Championships. Stanford
will bring an intimidating 40 of its top
athletes to take on the rest of the West.
"As a group, we should come close to
having one of the largest groups to com
pete in the NCAAs." head coach Edrick
Floreal said."ln Pac-lOs.you must have a
lot of really good athletes. We didn't have
that balance because we didn't have
enough people in order to get the next
five, six, seven and eight places. In the
NCAAs, if you have people that get first
and second in a good amount of events, to
score about 35 to 40 points, you could
possibly find yourself in the top four and
take a trophy back to the Farm."
At the Pac-10 Championships, May
12-13. the Cardinal women took second
place, while the men snagged an eighth
place finish. Both teams combined to
qualify in 58 events.
But clearly, the Cardinal women's
squad has led the way this year. In
women's competition, Stanford holds six
national top-20 spots among individual
events. Senior Ashley Freeman is No. 20
in the 800 meter with a qualifying time of
2:06.12, while junior Arianna Lambie
holds the No. 3 spot in the 1,500 meter
with a time of 4:15.75. Lambie is also run
ner-up to the best time in 5,000-meter
run with a 15:31.84 record, but will only
compete in the 1.500 meter this week. Ju
nior Teresa McWalters, No. 17 in the na
tion. will take on the 5.000 with a previ
ous record of 16:08.09.
In addition to the Cardinal women's
tremendous runners, junior Erica
McLain is No. I in the country for the
triple jump, having recorded a distance
of 14.15 meters; she is also No. 14 in the
long jump with a distance of 6.37 me
ters. 'ITie women's team is strong in a
number of diverse events and could
prove a force to be reckoned with this
weekend.
"We are looking really strong be
cause we have at least one person in the
top five of every event we've entered in,"
Lambie, the women's co-captain, said.
"We'd be really proud to bring two
thirds of our participants to the champi
onships.
"I'm pretty confident that I will be
able to qualify for nationals, but you
never can count out your competitors, so
1 will have to do my best," she continued.
"This will give me a chance to test out
what my legs can do and help me to real
ly prepare for nationals. Nationals will
be a whole different story in that 1 will
have to start thinking about how 1 can
beat those two in front of me."
The men's track team holds a few top
-20 individual records as well. Junior Rus
sell Brown holds the No. 6 position in the
1,500 meter with a 3:41.51, while senior
Brett Gotcher notched the No. 16 slot in
the daunting 10.000 meter run with a
time of 28:51.65.

GAMF NOTES; Stanford track and field will send 40
athletes to the NCAA West Regional this week
end, where the top-five individual event finishes
and top-three relay event finishes will all earn trips
to the NCAA Championships, taking place June
6-9. The Cardinal's 40 athletes qualified for 58
entries to various events at the regional. The Car
dinal women earned second place on their home
track two weeks ago at the Pac-10 Champi
onships, while the men's squad finished eighth.

In the men's field events.the Cardinal
has some strong competitors looking to
get the job done this weekend. Leading
the team in the the discus throw is senior
Michael Robertson with a No. 4 distance
of 62.71 meters. Just behind him in the
discus event is No. 12 junior Daniel
Shaerer with a distance of 5 l ).8 l ) meters.
No. 12 junior Graeme Hoste will bring
his best skills to the pole vaulting compe
tition; his current best is a height of 5.35
meters.
"Only the top five in each event qual
ify for nationals, and that's what we're
here to take care of," men's co-captain
Feranmi Okanlami said."Since we didn't
have as great of a performance as we
would have hoped in the Pac-lOs. every
one is eager to make a point on the na
tional stage that Stanford is a team to be
watched. There are always some nerves,
but I think that this time around,they are
nerves of excitement."
With so many top Cardinal athletes
competing in the NCAA Regionals, Flo
real is confident and focused on getting
his team to the championships, rather
than just winning regionals.
"1 think we have good chances this
week." Floreal said. "As far as winning or
losing goes, it has nothing to do with it.
Our focus is to send as many kids as pos
sible to the championships. If a person
gets fourth, it's as good as first when you
get to the NCAAs. The goal is to get as
many people as possible in the top five of
each event so that we will have as many
people as possible with an automatic
qualifying bid to go to the champi
onships."
The NCAA Regional meet gives ath
letes one shot to qualify for the champi
onships in June. With so many highly
ranked athletes in the field,both the men
and the women have their eyes on the
prize.
"There is always nervousness be
cause anything can happen." Floreal
said."Thoughts of the negative possibili
ties can definitely affect how you men
tally feel about your chances. My goal is
to help my team put that out of their
minds and focus on the positive things
that can happen."

never can count out your competitors, so
1 will have to do my best," she continued.
"This will give me a chance to test out
what my legs can do and help me to real
ly prepare for nationals. Nationals will
be a whole different story in that 1 will
have to start thinking about how 1 can
beat those two in front of me."
The men's track team holds a few top
-20 individual records as well. Junior Rus
sell Brown holds the No. 6 position in the
1,500 meter with a 3:41.51, while senior
Brett Gotcher notched the No. 16 slot in
the daunting 10.000 meter run with a
time of 28:51.65.

athletes to the NCAA West Regional this week
end, where the top-five individual event finishes
and top-three relay event finishes will all earn trips
to the NCAA Championships, taking place June
6-9. The Cardinal's 40 athletes qualified for 58
entries to various events at the regional. The Car
dinal women earned second place on their home
track two weeks ago at the Pac-10 Champi
onships, while the men's squad finished eighth.

In the men's field events.the Cardinal
has some strong competitors looking to
get the job done this weekend. Leading
the team in the the discus throw is senior
Michael Robertson with a No. 4 distance
of 62.71 meters. Just behind him in the

Shaerer with a distance of 5 l ).8 l ) meters.
No. 12 junior Graeme Hoste will bring

"Only the top five in each event qual
ify for nationals, and that's what we're
here to take care of," men's co-captain
Feranmi Okanlami said."Since we didn't
have as great of a performance as we
would have hoped in the Pac-lOs. every
one is eager to make a point on the na
tional stage that Stanford is a team to be
watched. There are always some nerves,
but I think that this time around,they are
nerves of excitement."
With so many top Cardinal athletes
competing in the NCAA Regionals, Flo
real is confident and focused on getting
his team to the championships, rather
than just winning regionals.
"1 think we have good chances this
week." Floreal said. "As far as winning or
losing goes, it has nothing to do with it.
Our focus is to send as many kids as pos
sible to the championships. If a person
gets fourth, it's as good as first when you
get to the NCAAs. The goal is to get as
many people as possible in the top five of
each event so that we will have as many
people as possible with an automatic
qualifying bid to go to the champi
onships."

ranked athletes in the field,both the men
and the women have their eyes on the
prize.
"There is always nervousness be
cause anything can happen." Floreal
said."Thoughts of the negative possibili
ties can definitely affect how you men
tally feel about your chances. My goal is
to help my team put that out of their
minds and focus on the positive things
that can happen."

Junior Arianna Lambie and the Cardinal head to Eugene, Ore. this weekend to take part in the NCAA West
Regional. Lambie holds the No. 3 spot in the 1,500 meter with a time of 4:1 5.75 heading into the event.
Coming off its phenomenal perform
ance at the Pacific-10 Conference Cham
pionships. the No. 10 Stanford women's
track and field team is headed to Eu
gene. Ore. for the NCAA West Regional
qualifying meet this weekend.
Joined by the unranked men's squad,
the Cardinal women will take on Ari
zona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington in hopes of top-five fin
ishes in individual events and top-three
finishes in race events to secure bids to
June's NCAA Championships. Stanford
will bring an intimidating 40 of its top
athletes to take on the rest of the West.
"As a group, we should come close to
having one of the largest groups to com
pete in the NCAAs." head coach Edrick
Floreal said."ln Pac-lOs.you must have a
lot of really good athletes. We didn't have
that balance because we didn't have
enough people in order to get the next
five, six, seven and eight places. In the
NCAAs, if you have people that get first
and second in a good amount of events, to
score about 35 to 40 points, you could
possibly find yourself in the top four and
take a trophy back to the Farm."
At the Pac-10 Championships, May
12-13. the Cardinal women took second
place, while the men snagged an eighth
place finish. Both teams combined to
qualify in 58 events.
But clearly, the Cardinal women's
squad has led the way this year. In
women's competition, Stanford holds six
national top-20 spots among individual
events. Senior Ashley Freeman is No. 20
in the 800 meter with a qualifying time of
2:06.12, while junior Arianna Lambie
holds the No. 3 spot in the 1,500 meter
with a time of 4:15.75. Lambie is also run
ner-up to the best time in 5,000-meter
run with a 15:31.84 record, but will only
compete in the 1.500 meter this week. Ju
nior Teresa McWalters, No. 17 in the na
tion. will take on the 5.000 with a previ
ous record of 16:08.09.
In addition to the Cardinal women's
tremendous runners, junior Erica
McLain is No. I in the country for the
triple jump, having recorded a distance
of 14.15 meters; she is also No. 14 in the
long jump with a distance of 6.37 me
ters. 'ITie women's team is strong in a
number of diverse events and could
prove a force to be reckoned with this
weekend.
"We are looking really strong be
cause we have at least one person in the
top five of every event we've entered in,"
Lambie, the women's co-captain, said.
"We'd be really proud to bring two
thirds of our participants to the champi
onships.
"I'm pretty confident that I will be
able to qualify for nationals, but you
never can count out your competitors, so
1 will have to do my best," she continued.
"This will give me a chance to test out
what my legs can do and help me to real
ly prepare for nationals. Nationals will
be a whole different story in that 1 will
