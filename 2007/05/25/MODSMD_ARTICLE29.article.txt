# Strong field awaits varsity eight
## No. 7 women's crew prepares for NCAA Championship showdown 
### ERIK ADAMS 
Fresh off their strong Pacific-10 Conference
Championship showing twelve days ago. the
No. 7 Stanford women's crew team now heads
east to compete at the NCAA ("hampionships
in Oak Ridge,Tenn.
Although the Cardinal failed to qualify for
the team championships, its second place finish
in the varsity eight (falling behind top-ranked
Southern California by just 3.5 seconds) vv;is
enough to secure an at-large bid to the
NCAAs.

Ilie team championships consist of a series
of races between the first varsity eight, the sec
ond varsity eight and the varsity four scjuads of
the 12 qualifying schools. Stanford and the
other three at-large selections. No. 14 Central
Florida. No. 15 Dartmouth and No. 13 UCLA,
join the team qualifiers for the varsity eight
heats, creating a field of 16 for that event.
The winner of the varsity eight races will
take home the NCAA title for the event, but
the 12 team championship qualifiers will con
tinue racing with the second varsity eights and
the varsity fours. I lie team with the most total
points at the end of all the races will be award
ed the NCAA team racing title.
Hie 12 qualifying squads are No. I I JSC. No.
2 Yale. No. 3 Virginia. No. 4 Brown. No. 5 Ohio
State, No. (i Notre Dame, No. K I JC-Berkeley.

No. 1 ) Princeton, No. 10 Tennessee, No. 11 Min
nesota, No. 12 Harvard and No. l l ) Washington.
Although the field is a mix of the nation's
best, Stanford will be sharing the water with
some familiar foes, as Pac-10 teams make up
nearly a third of the field.The Cardinal women
have been strong competitors with UCL.A and
Washington all year and finally showed up the
Golden Bears at the Pac-10 Championships,
defeating their rival for the first time this sea
son in a tight race for second.
The Cal and Washington programs also have
NCAA history, with each havingwon two of the
ten championships to date, and Washington
having qualified every year thus far. The Bears
are also the defending national champions.

Oak Ridge, Tenn.
GAME NOTFS The Stanford varsity eight topped archrival Cal at
the Pac-10 Championships in Roncho Cordova, Calif, to earn
a trip to the NCAA Championships this weekend. The Cardi
nal will compete against conference rivals USC, Cal and
Washington, as well as several powerhouses from the Ivy
League, Minnesota, Tennessee, Notre Dame, Ohio State and
Virginia. Stanford has yet to top No. 1 -ranked USC this sea
son, but finished closer to the Trojans than any other team this
season with just a 3.5-second margin between first and sec
ond at the Pac-10 Championships.
But the most difficult challenge for
Stanford may come from USC. Al
though just their second trip to the
NCAA team championships, the Tro
jans are the clear-cut favorites, head
ing into the season's final race unde
feated and ranked tops in the nation.
Stanford knows firsthand just how
dominant USC can he. but has made
progress against its southern rival.The
3.5 second margin at the Pac-10
Championships was the year's closest
finish yet for the Trojans.

The other two-thirds of the field
are not to he taken lightly, though.
Brown and Princeton have never
failed to qualify for the team champi
onships. Brown has managed to win
four, while I larvard took home the
national title in 2003. In fact, every
team in the field has NCAA experi
ence, except for Minnesota. But even
the Golden Gophers are a threat, as
their first varsity eight has finished
worse than second just once this sea
son.
Still, the Cardinal can take confi
dence in that its squad seems to he
peaking at just the right time.
