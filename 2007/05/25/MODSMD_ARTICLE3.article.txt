# Imposter II? Four years in Varian
## 
### AMIT ARORA DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITORS 
For the last four years, Elizabeth
Okazaki has attended graduate
physics seminars, used the offices
reserved for doctoral and post-doc
toral physics students and â€” for all
intents and purposes made the Var
ian Physics Lab her home.
The only problem is that Okaza
ki appears to have no affiliation
with Stanford and, according to
physics professors and students, no
real reason to he there.
Even more surprising on the
heels of Azia Kim's exposure as a
squatter in Okada yesterday, Vari
an administrators know that
Okazaki has become a permanent
presence in the lab and yet claim to
be able to do nothing about it.
In interviews with The Dailv,

several theoretical particle physics
graduate students said that Okaza
ki has been in the lab almost every
day over the last four years. At var
ious points in time, they claim, she
has assumed a locker space, pro
cured rooms in which to sleep and
perhaps even acquired a key to
enter the building after-hours and
over the weekend.
Okazaki. the students said, has
claimed to be a visiting scholar in
the humanities, looking to provide
an interdisciplinary perspective on
string theory. On several instances,
she has said that she was working
with Physics Prof. Leonard
Susskind, one of the world's most
respected string theorists.
But Susskind told The Daily that
Okazaki was not officially associat
ed with him or his lab in any way.
"As far as I know, she has no offi
cial connection with anyone in the
physics department," Susskind said.
"In fact, as far as I can tell, she has a
very limited knowledge of physics it
self."
Susskind also told The Daily that
Okazaki had said she was affiliated
with an academic department on
campus, yet Stanford Who and Face
book searches for Okazaki showed
no indication that she has ties to
Stanford.
When approached by The Daily
after she emerged from an advanced
physics seminar for graduate stu
dents, Okazaki repeatedly asked
that a story not be written and de
clined to confirm or deny that she is
a squatter or imposter. The woman
also would not confirm her name or
describe the nature of her research.
Before walking away and declining
to comment, Okazaki said she found
the whole pretense of the story "to
be quite bizarre."
But to the physics doctoral stu
dents who work in the lab.Okazaki's
lack of an affiliation with Stanford
was not surprising. Dan Green, a
doctoral student in theoretical parti
cle physics, said he became suspi
cious that Okazaki was at the lab
under false pretenses more than two
years ago. I Ie said that his relation
ship with Okazaki soured about a
year and a half ago when she moved
into a visitor's office in the building
and stayed there for more than a
month.
Green said that he immediately
proceeded to inform the lab's ad
ministrative offices about Okazaki's
behavior, but to his surprise, he said
that Physics Department Services
Manager Rosenna Yau refused to
block Okazaki's entrance into the
building.
"We met significant resistance
from the office," Green said. "When
we tried to describe Okazaki's be
havior to them, they gave us the
same stories that she had told us/ITie
office was willing to accept every ex

cuse she gave them."
Surjeet Rajendran.a physics doc
toral student who also complained
to the administration,echoed similar
sentiments.
"The department is very aware of
who this person is," Rajendran said.
"TTiere's tenderness for this girl, in
my opinion, because she's a past col
league of theirs."
In an interview with The Daily.
Yau acknowledged meeting with
several physics students about
Okazaki's presence in the lab and
confirmed that Okazaki worked in
the administrative offices as a tem
porary employee for a brief period.
The administrator, however,defend
ed Okazaki's presence in the lab.
"She's a visiting scholar in either
the music department or the Ger
man studies department," Yau said.
"She's shown me her visiting scholar
card."
Yau also vehemently disputed
the fact that Okazaki has a key to the
lab, which some students said
Okazaki has used on several in
stances to open office doors.The ad
ministrator claimed that Okazaki's
frequent presence in the lab, espe
cially after the building had closed
and on weekends, could be attrib
uted to the carelessness of the
physics students, who she suggested
must be permitting Okazaki to enter
the building.
"We have sent out so many
emails because students don't ask
questions when people follow them
in through the door." Yau said. "Stu
dents even prop the door open on
weekends."
The department administrator
also suggested that Okazaki has not
committed any crime in attending a
number of advanced physics lec
tures and seminars or in assuming
office spaces in the building. Yau
told The Daily that the lab was a
"public space" and that she could
not legally prohibit Okazaki from
entering the building without a re
straining order.
The administration's apparent
unwillingness to prevent Okazaki
from assuming a permanent pres
ence in the building angered many of
the doctoral and post-doctoral stu
dents who spoke with The Daily.The

students attributed Okazaki's four
year-long stay in the department to
both the administrative office's re
fusal to act as well as the attitude in
the physics department.
"She's smart enough to leave
most of the faculty alone," Green
said. "Most people here are non
confrontational, so few have really
pressed the issue. Her visible pres
ence changes over time depending
on how much people have tried to
get rid of her."
While no one who talked with
The Daily viewed Okazaki as a "se
curity threat," most described her as
a "nuisance," and some suggested
that her continuing presence
evinced how easy it is to gain unau
thorized access to the building.
Over the last three months, dif
ferent laboratories, including the
Varian Physics Lab. have been bur
glarized several times with hundreds
of thousands of dollars of equipment
stolen. Green expressed frustration
that the department's administra
tors continually called on physics
students to be more vigilant when he
said the office refused to deal deci
sively with Okazaki.
ITie most likely person to prop
the door open," he said, "is the per
son who doesn't have a right to be
here and who's not on the list."
Many students said they felt sorry
for Okazaki, who they speculate is
homeless.
"I feel really bad for her." said
Alessandro Tomasiello, a post-doc
toral scholar in theoretical particle
physics. "1 don't want to have a con
versation with her that will actually
hurt her."
Green partially attributed the
lack of protest regarding Okazaki's
four-year-long stay in the depart
ment to the fact that Okazaki is an
Asian woman.
"If she were a large, intimidating
man, there's no doubt that something
would be done," he said. "There's a
huge bias against appearances and
it's prevented people from taking ac
tion. I can't see any reason why our
department is special.This could real
ly happen all over the place."
