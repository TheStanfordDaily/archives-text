# Imposter II? Four years in Varian
## 
### AMIT ARORA DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITORS 
For the last four years, Elizabeth
Okazaki has attended graduate
physics seminars, used the offices
reserved for doctoral and post-doc
toral physics students and â€” for all
intents and purposes made the Var
ian Physics Lab her home.
The only problem is that Okaza
ki appears to have no affiliation
with Stanford and, according to
physics professors and students, no
real reason to he there.
Even more surprising on the
heels of Azia Kim's exposure as a
squatter in Okada yesterday, Vari
an administrators know that
Okazaki has become a permanent
presence in the lab and yet claim to
be able to do nothing about it.
In interviews with The Dailv,

several theoretical particle physics
graduate students said that Okaza
ki has been in the lab almost every
day over the last four years. At var
ious points in time, they claim, she
has assumed a locker space, pro
cured rooms in which to sleep and
perhaps even acquired a key to
enter the building after-hours and
over the weekend.
Okazaki. the students said, has
claimed to be a visiting scholar in
the humanities, looking to provide
an interdisciplinary perspective on
string theory. On several instances,
she has said that she was working
with Physics Prof. Leonard
Susskind, one of the world's most
respected string theorists.
But Susskind told The Daily that
Okazaki was not officially associat
ed with him or his lab in any way.
