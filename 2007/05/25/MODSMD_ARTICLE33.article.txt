Azia: the new facebook. As if you haven't heard enough about the life that was Azia Kim, I propose
that nothing since facebook has taken over this campus in a way that Aziz has. Azian is a new adjective.
Facebook groups call for naked protests in President Hennessy's office to "Save Azia" and other groups
state "1 want Azia as my roommate!".
It seems that you can't walk into a room without someone talking about Azia and the ramifications.
Campus security! Creepy! Where was the staff? Are all questions that dominate conversation. And
how can it not? Local news stations are camped outside of Kimball and Wilbur, the story pops up in
Google's top ten and it seems that the campus is just waiting for the national news to pick it up. Can't
you read the headline going along the bottom of CNN Headline news: "Stanford Impostor: 18-year-old
poses as a student at elite university."
If you don't believe me, check out The Stanford Daily article from yesterday's comment section.
Yes, Azia-hysteria has hit campus and the nation. I know that in the coming weeks, everyone is going
to be asking. "How did Stanford allow this to happen?" Right now, I want you to ask yourself if it is even
fair to answer that question. Clearly, she was smart and she had a goal. Is it fair to ask Stanford to know
everyone on this campus at all times ? Do we even want a campus where that is the aim of campus secu
rity? I can't imagine going to a school where I have to check into every building I want to go in. In the
middle of Washington, D.C. or New York City I think that these are reasonable security measures but
on Stanford campus?
I am not denying that there were serious breakdowns in the way housing is supposed to work. It is
kind of crazy that no one spoke up. That is the reason that everyone can't stop talking about it. It is the
notion that someone would even think to do this or that they could succeed.
However, we have to keep this all in perspective. Is this really that much of a tragedy? With Darfur
and Iraq should we be so appalled by a girl who can sneak into a dorm? Or, more appropriately, should
we be spending so much time worrying about it? Ok, so now every RA has checked their roster a few
times to make sure that they aren't the next victim of Azia-fever. Next year, we will all be much more
aware of who is in our dorm and who is visiting whom.
For now, all you can do is feel the Azia-hysteria. Watch CNN talk about "the Asian theme dorm"
and see if you can catch your friends biking to class in the background of the filming. Live your dream
Stanford because that is what Azia would do.
