## PATRIOTIC FLICKS THAT ARE THAT ARE JUST PATHETIC 
### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION PATRIOT 
There's a perilously thin line between inspiring
patriotic symbolism and utterly tacky crap pur
portedly glorifying America. How easily the

majesty of the
American flag can
be mangled into a
gaudy stars-and
stripes tie or wind
breaker. The
realm of movies is
by no means any
different. With
that in mind, con
sider the following
films the red. white
and blue wind
breakers of the cin
ematic world.
"Red Dawn" —
1985
This cinematic
bomb details an al
ternate history in

which Soviet troops invade the U.S. and descend
upon a small Colorado town. Who'll stand up to
this horde of ravenous Reds? Why, a posse of
high schoolers, of course! And not just any high
schoolers, we're talking a crack team of Patrick
Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell (if
you don't know who he is... this movie would be
part of the reason why), Jennifer Grey and Leah
Thompson. So America's last stand against the
commies will be led by "Dirty Dancing," "Caro
line in the City"... and C. Thomas Howell? Ap
parently, this wartime breakfast club ultimately

turns the tide of the war bv using insurgent tactics
to exhaust their Soviet occupiers. Maybe we
should look to Hillary Dul'f, Daniel Radcliffe and
Dakota Fanning to stabilize Iraq and neutralize
A 1 Qaeda?

"American Pie
Presents: The
Naked Mile" —
2006
Fine, this
movie doesn't
even purport to be
about patriotism.
It's just awful.
"Pearl Harbor"
— 2001
Michael
Bay plus Jerry
Bruckheimer
plus the infamous
attack on the U.S.
equals explo
sions. Many of
them. A lot —

even for a movie produced by Jerry Bruck
heimer and Michael Bay. Similarly, Ben Af
fleck plus Josh Hartnett equals bad acting.
Very bad acting. Bad acting even for a would
be summer blockbuster produced by Michael
Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. In contrast to the
somber, far-superior "Saving Private Ryan,"
"Pearl Harbor" reduccs the horrors of the
Japanese attack down to a Universal Studios
theme park ride. Both would be overpriced and
likely induce vomiting... but at least the ride
would last under five minutes.

"Rocky 1V"—1987
Start with the archetypical American hero: the
underdog scrapper. Rocky Balboa, overcoming
the odds using gusto... and alternative training
methods featuring cow carcasses and logs. Then,
put him up against the cold, mechanical pride of
the Communist, Soviet Union — Ivan Drago.
Any more nationalist symbolism and you'd be shit
ting stars and stripes (which may actually be a seri
ous medical condition... you should see a proctolo
gist or something). Yeah, Rocky's victory symbol-

izes capitalism crushing
the proverbial sternum of
communism and thus lays
the groundwork for the
Union's collapse four
short years later. Yes,
Rocky personally ended
the Cold War —glasnost
and perestroika actually
refer to his left and right
fists.
"Universal Soldier" —
1992
When you think "good
old-fashioned" American
hero, Jean Claude Van
Damme must come to
mind. Who would play his
stilted military comrade?
Why, the equally home
grown Dolph Lundgrcn
of "Rocky IV" fame! You
can tell from the begin
ning that authenticity was
a priority in this flick. Van
Damme and Lundgren

play two soldiers who kill cach other during the
Vietnam War only to be resurrected to stave off a
terrorist attack decades later. So if you already
have the technology to reanimate people and wipe

their memories... how big of a concern really is ter
rorism anymore? Whatever, I guess this is prefer
able to a draft or a new stop-loss policy? More
shockingly, the films producers "reanimated" this
lame premise with three sequels within the next 10
years. 1 guess the producers couldn't seem to let
this series die in peace, either?
"The Postman" —1997
No "worst movie list" could ever be complete with
out a post-1990 Kevin Costner cinematic debacle.

This particular
waste of cellu
loid — not to
mention three
hours of your
life — chroni
cles a post
apocalyptic
drifter pur
porting to he a
post m a n
spreading tales
of resurgent
American gov
ernment. This
dude writes
fake letters
about the re
birth of a gov
ernment that
docs not really
exist and his
penchant for
delusion
makes him a
hero. Appar
ently, the best
wav to arouse

patriotism is to invoke false intelligence to suit your
own ends... hmmm, maybe they were onto some
thing (insert obligatory Iraq/WMD reference
here)?
