## So it is summer, and you have got cable 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION SUMMER SYNDICATION EXPERT 
College students have the pleasure of classi
fying some portion of time between May and
September (depending on the school) as their
summer vacation. No matter what a student
chooses to do with this time, it is usually charac
terized by a highly reduced level of responsibil
ity when compared to the rest of the year (un-

less you have scored a coveted fi
nance or consulting internship; you
guys can stop reading now because

'ou likely won't be watching
any TV, as your enslave
ment will not afford you

the time to do so, but

that's why you'll be
making the big
bucks). There-

fore. most of us
have far more
time to vegetate
in front of the

television during
the summer
months. Unfortu-

nately, summer TV
also has a tendency
to be a little bit sub
standard. The way
1 see it. there exist
only three cate
gories of summer
TV: the good (lo-

cated mainly on
cable and pre
mium networks),

the acceptably bad

and the downright horrendous.
Here's a rundown of this summer's

offerings:
The Good (You need not feel

guilty about spending
your time wutching
these)

I."Rescue Me" (FX) -
This show focuses on
the screwed up life
of New York City

firefighter Tommy
Gavin (played by
Dennis Leary). 1
think this show is
definitely more ori
ented towards a
male audience, as it
can often be fairly vio-

Icnt/raunchy/vulgar,
but I still enjoy it, as it's a
well-written, well-acted,
generally compelling drama

2. "The Closer" (TNT) — I've never actually
watched this show (the accent of the lead ac
tress annoys me when I watch ihe trailers), so I
feel like a little bit of a phony recommending it.
hut this show consistently gets very positive re
views (and has even earned an award for Kyra
Sedgwick and her accent at the most recent
Golden Globes), so it's probably pretty decent.
3. "Top Chef (Bravo) — It's kind of like "Pro
ject Runway," but with food. Bravo has defi
nitely got this type of show format down! Too
bad Stanford's standard cable package does not
give us Bravo...
4. "Weeds" (Showtime) — Single suburban
mom Nancy Botwin sells marijuana, because,

well, it's profitable, and her lifestyle is ex
pensive (and her husband is dead so
there's no money there). Last season

ended with a cliffhanger so I can't wait
to see how it's resolved come this Au
gust.

5. "Entourage" (HBO) — While
HBO sometimes deprives viewers
of new episodes of an original se
ries for well over a year

(*cough* "The Sopra
nos"), the split Season 3
i of "Entourage" ends
June 3 and Season 4 be
gins on June 17. Interest
ing scheduling, hut I'm
not going to argue. This
show is hilarious and has
the perfect light tone for
summer viewing.

The Accept
ably Bad (Be
cause it's okay 4

to lower our
standards a
little for
summer)

1. "Hidden Palms" - From
the trailer, this show ap
pears to focus on wealthy
people with issues and se
crets in the city of New-

port Beach Palm
Springs. Basical-

ly, it's an ugly
stepsister of
"The O.C "
Conveniently

enough, it also stars two of the supporting char
acters from"The 0.C.," including Oliver from
Season 1 and Summer's replacement boyfriend
Zach from Season 2 (I'd use their real names if
they meant something to us). Though it may he
a cheap rip-off, I'm counting on this show to he
acceptably bad, as the absence of "The 0.C."
has left a deep hole in my heart.
2. "My Boys" — Remember analogies from
the SATs (before they ditched them)? "The
OC": "Hidden Palms" :: "Sex and the City":
"My Boys." That's right folks, we have another
knock off! P.J. lives in New York Chicago,
writes a sex sports column and is having trouble
finding the right man. It's no "Sex and the ('it\
but from the few episodes that I saw of this show
earlier this year it seemed reasonably cute —
certainly acceptable for summer fare.
3. "Psych" (USA) — I watched the first few
episodes of this series last summer and thought
it was decent. The premise: An amateur detec
tive (trained by his father, a policeman)



pretends to be a psychic so that the po
lice will hire him to help with cases.
After about three episodes, the tone of
this show got to be a little too silly for
my taste, but if you're home on a ran
dom Friday evening when this airs, you
could do worse for entertainment.
4. "The Loop" (FOX) — I don't

/ know how many
' of you caught the
few episodes of
this show that
aired last year,
but I thought it was pretty funny (in
that stupid funny sort of way). It's
about a young college graduate that
struggles between juggling his real
job with the demands of his jobless,
oft trouble-inducing roommates and
friends. I doubt this show will be on
for long, as its return (June 10) does
n't seem to have been promoted at

all (meaning nobody will watch it
and then Fox will cancel it), hut it's
worth catching an episode while it
lasts.
The Downright Horrendous (Stay
away)
There will be many reality shows
that air on television this summer —
far too many to list. However, besides
"Top Chef' (listed above) and Steven
Spielberg's "On the Lot" (which
seems similar to "Project Greenlight"
of a few years ago and should be enter
taining enough), I imagine most of
them will suck. Watch at your own
risk.
If none of the above offerings
sound very exciting to you. another op
tion is TV on DVD. Take some time to
rediscover shows you have forgotten
about or ones that you have been in
tending to watch but haven't been able
to make time for. After all. we can only
watch so much television during the
year. I've definitely discovered some
of my favorite shows through watching
them on DVD during the summer (I'm
referring to you, "Battlestar Galacti
ca"). Finally, if all else fails, you might
try venturing outside into the sun
light...

3. "Psych" (USA) — I watched the first few
episodes of this series last summer and thought
it was decent. The premise: An amateur detec
tive (trained by his father, a policeman)



pretends to be a psychic so that the po
lice will hire him to help with cases.
After about three episodes, the tone of
this show got to be a little too silly for
my taste, but if you're home on a ran
dom Friday evening when this airs, you
could do worse for entertainment.
4. "The Loop" (FOX) — I don't

/ know how many
' of you caught the
few episodes of
this show that
aired last year,
but I thought it was pretty funny (in
that stupid funny sort of way). It's
about a young college graduate that
struggles between juggling his real
job with the demands of his jobless,
oft trouble-inducing roommates and
friends. I doubt this show will be on
for long, as its return (June 10) does
n't seem to have been promoted at

all (meaning nobody will watch it
and then Fox will cancel it), hut it's
worth catching an episode while it
lasts.
The Downright Horrendous (Stay
away)
There will be many reality shows
that air on television this summer —
far too many to list. However, besides
"Top Chef' (listed above) and Steven
Spielberg's "On the Lot" (which
seems similar to "Project Greenlight"
of a few years ago and should be enter
taining enough), I imagine most of
them will suck. Watch at your own
risk.
If none of the above offerings
sound very exciting to you. another op
tion is TV on DVD. Take some time to
rediscover shows you have forgotten
about or ones that you have been in
tending to watch but haven't been able
to make time for. After all. we can only
watch so much television during the
year. I've definitely discovered some
of my favorite shows through watching
them on DVD during the summer (I'm
referring to you, "Battlestar Galacti
ca"). Finally, if all else fails, you might
try venturing outside into the sun
light...
College students have the pleasure of classi
fying some portion of time between May and
September (depending on the school) as their
summer vacation. No matter what a student
chooses to do with this time, it is usually charac
terized by a highly reduced level of responsibil
ity when compared to the rest of the year (un-

less you have scored a coveted fi
nance or consulting internship; you
guys can stop reading now because

'ou likely won't be watching
any TV, as your enslave
ment will not afford you

the time to do so, but

that's why you'll be
making the big
bucks). There-

fore. most of us
have far more
time to vegetate
in front of the

television during
the summer
months. Unfortu-

nately, summer TV
also has a tendency
to be a little bit sub
standard. The way
1 see it. there exist
only three cate
gories of summer
TV: the good (lo-

cated mainly on
cable and pre
mium networks),

the acceptably bad

and the downright horrendous.
Here's a rundown of this summer's

offerings:
The Good (You need not feel

guilty about spending
your time wutching
these)

I."Rescue Me" (FX) -
This show focuses on
the screwed up life
of New York City

firefighter Tommy
Gavin (played by
Dennis Leary). 1
think this show is
definitely more ori
ented towards a
male audience, as it
can often be fairly vio-

Icnt/raunchy/vulgar,
but I still enjoy it, as it's a
well-written, well-acted,
generally compelling drama

2. "The Closer" (TNT) — I've never actually
watched this show (the accent of the lead ac
tress annoys me when I watch ihe trailers), so I
feel like a little bit of a phony recommending it.
hut this show consistently gets very positive re
views (and has even earned an award for Kyra
Sedgwick and her accent at the most recent
Golden Globes), so it's probably pretty decent.
3. "Top Chef (Bravo) — It's kind of like "Pro
ject Runway," but with food. Bravo has defi
nitely got this type of show format down! Too
bad Stanford's standard cable package does not
give us Bravo...
4. "Weeds" (Showtime) — Single suburban
mom Nancy Botwin sells marijuana, because,

well, it's profitable, and her lifestyle is ex
pensive (and her husband is dead so
there's no money there). Last season

ended with a cliffhanger so I can't wait
to see how it's resolved come this Au
gust.

5. "Entourage" (HBO) — While
HBO sometimes deprives viewers
of new episodes of an original se
ries for well over a year

(*cough* "The Sopra
nos"), the split Season 3
i of "Entourage" ends
June 3 and Season 4 be
gins on June 17. Interest
ing scheduling, hut I'm
not going to argue. This
show is hilarious and has
the perfect light tone for
summer viewing.

The Accept
ably Bad (Be
cause it's okay 4

to lower our
standards a
little for
summer)

1. "Hidden Palms" - From
the trailer, this show ap
pears to focus on wealthy
people with issues and se
crets in the city of New-

port Beach Palm
Springs. Basical-

ly, it's an ugly
stepsister of
"The O.C "
Conveniently

enough, it also stars two of the supporting char
acters from"The 0.C.," including Oliver from
Season 1 and Summer's replacement boyfriend
Zach from Season 2 (I'd use their real names if
they meant something to us). Though it may he
a cheap rip-off, I'm counting on this show to he
acceptably bad, as the absence of "The 0.C."
has left a deep hole in my heart.
2. "My Boys" — Remember analogies from
the SATs (before they ditched them)? "The
OC": "Hidden Palms" :: "Sex and the City":
"My Boys." That's right folks, we have another
knock off! P.J. lives in New York Chicago,
writes a sex sports column and is having trouble
finding the right man. It's no "Sex and the ('it\
but from the few episodes that I saw of this show
earlier this year it seemed reasonably cute —
certainly acceptable for summer fare.
3. "Psych" (USA) — I watched the first few
episodes of this series last summer and thought
it was decent. The premise: An amateur detec
tive (trained by his father, a policeman)



pretends to be a psychic so that the po
lice will hire him to help with cases.
