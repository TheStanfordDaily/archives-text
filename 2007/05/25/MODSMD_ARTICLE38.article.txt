# Washington, D.C.
## 
### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION CAPITAL EXPERT 
For this week's spread, I knew that I was sup
posed to write something patriotic. It sounded
pretty easy: This week is Memorial Day weekend
and America is always obnoxiously patriotic
(Have you ever considered that it is kind ol' weird
that we play the national anthem at all sporting
events? What docs The Star Spangled Banner
have to do with the New York Yankees playing
the Boston Red Sox?). However, coming up with
patriotism in 1.000 words suddenly sounded like
one of those speech contests from middle school.
So I decided to write about the most patriotic
thing I could think of: Washington. D.C'. Not only
is D.C. my current hometown, it is also the place
where 1 know many of you look forward to spend
ing your summer (mine, too!) This list is merely a
primer: in fact. 1 had to delete some from my orig-
list. I guess if you want more, you'll have to
hang out with me this summer in D.C.

this sounds

cheesy but my parents rave about this place. ()pen
until 4 a.m. on weekends, hospital workers, cab
drivers, government workers and Georgetown

vouring Iranian last food. Grab a kebab and take
it down to the C&O canal (just down the street!)
for a great outdoor snack. Whether you are a Per
sian food lover or an adventurous foodie looking
for a new taste, this is the place for you.

Einstein Memorial
Most people go to the Mall (the national one.
read: no stores, just grass, memorials and build
ings) to hit the big ones: Lincoln, Washington,
walk a little and visit F.D.R. However', some of the
best memorials arc just overlooked. The Allien
Einstein Memorial sits outside of the National
Academy of Sciences on a dais containing markers
indicating the position when the memorial was
dedicated of just less than 3,(XX) astronomical ob
jects. Go climb up on Einstein's lap and take a
group picture (he is huge: if standing he would be
21 feet tall) or just read in the afternoon. If you're
just looking for a new twist on walking the monu
ments, try a midnight walk of them on a clear
night.

Social Safeway/Watergate Safeway

Stanford has Sccret Safeway and D.C. has So-

cial Safeway. Termed by locals and used in local
newspapers to identify it. Social Safeway got its
name because apparently it is the place to go on a
Friday night if you are looking for a date. What
I vile' place to pick up your future spouse than a
supermarket? The Watergate (also "Senior")
Safcw , as in the Safeway underneath the famous
Watei ate, isn't as socially adept (nor have as big
a selection) but it is known as the place to see your
favorite political all-stars shopping for their- gro
ceries 11 you w;mt to actually treat yourself there
is a new Trader Joe's just down the street. But who
i'oes grocery shopping just for the food?

\ hiole Park at Camden Yards, Baltimore
W lule not actually in D.C., Camden Yards is
worth the trip for any baseball fan who finds them
selves in the D.C. area. It is one of the prettiest
baseball parks I have ever been in and it has a great
atmosphere. Too bad there is no good way to get
there on public transportation — no parking any
where near anywhere if you drive and nothing ex
. pi the Waterfront around it. If you want to drive,
take the afternoon off and go early. Park close and
enjoy the extra hours watclring B.P.'or on the Wa
ter 6 "tit. No car? You can take a mix of the
M VRC and a bus and a metro.

Off the end of the run-

way at Ronald Rea
van National

Airport,

there is only one way to describe
this park: ridiculously cool. You

can take in a picnic or play
Frisbee while watching the

planes land right over youi
head. On a windy day.

you can feel the vortices

off the wing tips of low-flying

aircraft. There are also bike and
jogging paths that run through it.

Cosi People Watching
Cosi is a restaurant with gourmet sandwiches
and salads (think Au Bon Pain or Panera Bread)
which has locations throughout the United States.
Personally, I'm not a big fan of the food in gener
al. However, the best things about Cosi are their
s'more platters and coffee drinks. In Dupont Cir
cle, on a nice night in the summer, enjoy milking
your own s'mores at your table while watching the

night flow by.
