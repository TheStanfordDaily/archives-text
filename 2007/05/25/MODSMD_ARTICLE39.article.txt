## Some movies aren't quite as patriotic 
### WEENA PUN INTERMISSION AMERICANA 
What makes a movie anti-America is
very subjective. Today, there is no country

that is left untouched
by American politics
or the American en
tertainment business.
So it is not surprising
that there are movies
that vilify American
life and culture or
show how filthy
American politics is.
But which are they?
"American Beauty"

pokes fun at America. Borat, a journalist, is
on a journey from Kazakhstan to find out
what makes U.S. "the greatest" country in
the world. And what he learns are the
"not" jokes
which turn
out to be em
barrassing
rather than
funny, the
dining eti
quette where
the advice to
compliment
only if it's true
turns offen
sively funny,
or the driving
lessons where
he learns

Now. a title which
has beauty in it could hardly be anti-Amer- what American men
ica, right? Of course, I don't think Sam think about women's

rights: She
has right to
choose who
to have sex
with. I think
the most anti-
America mo
ment is when
Borat pro
claims at a
rodeo, "We
support your
war of ter
ror." Now.

Mendes is anti-American (or for that mat
ter. Kate Winslet. who married him) but
everyone realizes how ironic the title is
once they watch the film. This deeply psy
chological and (more probably) slightly ex
aggerated movie might not be a firsthand
look at American life, but when I saw it, 1
was frightened. A father who develops a
crush on his teenage daughter's high
school friend, a mother to whom success is
the only thing that matters, a daughter who
wishes her father dead... what a sick Amer-

ican life. If I were ever
to marry, have kids
and live in U.S.. who
knew I was going to be
depressed to death.

"Syriana"
Corruption is at the heart of this com
plex movie. It tells lour different stories
which are all directly related to the oil in
dustry. In an oil-hungry world, America is
the top consumer and it will do anything to
ensure that the flow is not cut off. The heir
to the United Arab Emirates gives an oil
contract to a Chinese company. He wants
to rebuild his country through the profits
he gains from this contract. This vision of a
new country includes things like creating a
parliament and giving women their rights.
The American company he turned down
fires its immigrant workers and merges
with another smaller American company
that landed a contract on Kazakhstan oil.
The heir's decision is not welcome to
American oil industry. So the CIA gets in
volved and decides to eliminate him.
Meanwhile, the immigrant workers turn to
fundamentalist Islam and decide to blow
up the oil company that fired them. On a
lighter note, although George Clooney is
less dashy than usual, all of the actors are
superb in their roles.
