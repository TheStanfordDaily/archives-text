### BEN STOLL 
Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.) spoke for an
hour last night in a nearly-packed Hewlett
Teaching Center about U.S. foreign policy
since the end of the Cold War and about
America's place in the world.
The audience burst into frequent ap
plause as Clark outlined — with candor and
dashes of humor — his role in post-Cold
War politics and his thoughts on the world
today.
Calling the Cold War a conflict that pit
ted "materialism versus freedom," the for
mer general candidly assessed the ways the
struggle affected U.S. foreign policy
"We lost our purpose in the world," he
said.
Clark sought the Democratic nomina
tion for president in 2(X>4 but eventually
withdrew from the race to support Senator
John Kerry (D MA). The former general is
also a West Point graduate, a veteran of the
Vietnam War. a Rhodes Scholar and former
Supreme Commander of NATO in Europe.
I le retired from the military in 2(XX).
As the man responsible for the develop
ment of American military strategy in the
19905, Clark anticipated modern fears of nu
clear proliferation, terrorism and regional
instability.
"We called it engagement and enlarge
ment. If you got it in your email, you'd think
it was a pharmaceutical product for men,"
he said, drawing laughter from the crowd.
"All that came crashing down on our
heads on Sept. 11.2(X)1,"he added. "We had
no strategy."
Clark offered a negative assessment of
U.S. involvement in Iraq.saying the war has
destroyed American credibility around the
globe.
"Tremendous damage has been done to
the United States," he said.
Despite his harsh criticism of the Iraq
war. Clark nostalgically reminisced
about American ideals and was opti
mistic that Americans could restore
their country's reputation abroad.
"We were the party that did the
right thing, not what was in our own
interest." he said. "That's where we
got our legitimacy. We have to find an
honorable way out of Iraq and regain
our legitimacy."
The former general also ad
dressed competition with developing
nations like China and India, stress
ing the need for the U.S. to remain
competitive and the need for young
people to become involved in politics.
When the floor was opened to
questions, one audience member
identified himself as a UC-Berkeley
student, earning low hisses from the
crowd.
"Is there any chance you will enter
in '08?" the Cal student asked.
"1 haven't said I won't," Clark
replied, to loud applause.
In the question-and-answer ses
sion. Clark also addressed the hu
manitarian crisis in Darfur.
"In Darfur we've done nothing."
he said, "and it's wrone."
