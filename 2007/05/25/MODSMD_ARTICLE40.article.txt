## The 'Sky' is a bit grayer than Wilco would like
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION ROGER WILCO 
Wilco is a weathered band. Starting in 1994
playing alternative-country, Wilco has since lost
all but two of its original members, taken on an
alternative rock sound, released six studio al
bums, one live record and two collaborative
tribute albums to famed folk singer Woodie
Guthrie, dabbled with progressive and experi
mental sounds, sent its leader singer to rehab,
angrily switched record labels and won three
Grammys.
"Will Comply" was born after the breakup
of the popular '80s band Uncle Tupelo. Two of
lupelo's previous members, lead singer and
guitarist Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt
became the cornerstone of Wilco and have
boon the only consistent members throughout
the band's 13-year career. Although Wilco cur
rently includes four other members, including a
pianist, second guitarist, percussionist and
multi-insturmentalist, seven other band mem
bers have come and gone, mainly amicably al
though occasionally huffily in the band's long
career.
As equally varied as Wilco's roster is the
band's sound. Following the country influences
dI Uncle Tupelo, Wilco's first album "A.M."
was also mainly country. The band's sopho
more effort "Being There," however, diverged
from the down-South influences and included
R& B. orchestral and pop sounds as well. Wilco

was then approached by Billy Bragg to collabo
rate on a project commissioned by Norah
Guthrie to set music to some of the thousand
plus song lyrics her lather had left behind at his
death. This project resulted in the folky albums
"Mermaid Avenue," which won a Grammy for
Best Contemporary Folk Album and "Mer
maid Avenue 11," which continued the collabo
rative project. In between these folk albums,
Wilco released "Summerteeth" whose low sales
led to record label tension. Urged to make a
more commercial-pop-friendly album, Wilco
left their Warner Bros, label, bought their stu
dio tapes for $50,000 and released "Yankee
Hotel Foxtrot" in 2002. Claimed by many critics
to be one of the best albums of the year,
"Yanke"e peaked at #13 on the Billboard Top
200. Their next release, "A Ghost is Born."
reached #8 in 2004. providing Wilco with its
highest chart rankings to date. Following the re
lease of "Ghost," Tweedy entered rehab for a
painkiller addiction, which he had a prescrip
tion for in order to fight persistent migraines
and a panic disorder. Following a live album in
2005. Wilco released their latest album "Sky
Blue Sky" on May 15.
As opposed to previous albums, Wilco is
touting "Sky" as a much more collaborative ef
fort. Instead of Tweedy fleshing out songs and
presenting them in a more or less complete
form, the band modified songs as an ensemble,
ultimately reaching a final product by consen
sus. "Sky" once again presents a blend of styles,

offering this time a strong retro-rock
sound mixed together with a more tra
ditionally Wilco indie-folk-rock sound
— not to mention the one-to-two song
dabblings into other musical genres.
"Side with Seeds" channels '70s soul
while the quirky Beatles-esque
"Walken" features the endearingly sim
ple, love-filled lyrics, "I'm walking all
by myself/ I 'm talking to myself/ About
you/1 was singing this song about you/1
was thinking about singing this song
about you." Long, tri-part retro-rock
electric guitar riffs punctuate "Impossi
ble Germany" while the title track "Sky
Blue Sky" is a slow country shuffle
about a parade making its way through
the singer's hometown. The acoustic
"Either Way" is completely Dylan
esque for the first half until violins
enter, followed by an electric guitar.

The angry and disgruntled "Let's Not Get Car
ried Away" is the rockiest track, while in the
outstanding country/folk single "What Light"
Tweedy channels Guthrie, singing "If you feel
like singing a song/ And you want other people
to sing along/ Just sing what you feel/ Don't let
anyone say it's wrong."
The strange juxtapositions of acoustic folk,
retro-rock rills, Dylan-esquc ballads, Beatles
styled serenades, sometimes mixed and
matched into one song, creates a hodge-podge
that doesn't blend into a cohesive record but

rather ends up sounding like exactly its is: loose
ly stitched-together sound-bites. Electric guitar
comes out of nowhere, and angsty rock songs
butt up against oh-so-indie we-all-die-but-I
will-love-you-until-the-end numbers. Wilco de
livers a few great songs, but they are buried in a
rather jumbled album that ultimately can't step
out of the shadows of the band's previous suc
cesses.
