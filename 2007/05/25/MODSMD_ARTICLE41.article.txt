# Megadeth back in true 'metal' form
## 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION MEGAMAN 
When a band has been around for nearly
25 years and gone through almost as many
band members, you generally expect to sec a
"Behind the Music" special rather than a new
album. But anyone who believes the adage
that old bands just fade away has obviously
never heard of Dave Mustaine and
Megadeth.
"United Abominations'* is Megadeth's
staggering eleventh studio album, and rather
than being the last throw-away album on
Megadeth's contract, Mustaine and company
have come together to release a jaw-dropping
record that instantly transports the listener
back to the glory days of not only Megadeth,
but American metal in general.
The album opens up with their first sin
gle, "Sleepwalker." It starts slow but quickly
picks up with a driving rhythm and blistering
riffs that will make any metal fan smile in
quiet respect. The other instantly noticeable
change is the intricate drum work of new ad
dition Shawn Drover. The double-bass and
complex fills arc something that has never
been a prominent feature of past Megadeth

albums, but they feel perfectly in place as
Drover never misses a beat and adds a whole
new dimension to Megadeth's music.
"Sleepwalker" is followed up with
Megadeth's second single, "Washington is
Next!" Featuring more rifftastic guitar lines

and harmo
nized leads,
new guitarist
Glen Drover
(brother of
drum me r
Shawn) really
shines through.
Drover's solos
arc blazing and
creative and
make the songs
stand out much
more than in
their most re
cent albums.
Tucked

away in the middle of the album is /.
another gem tilled "Play for
Blood." This song is the biggest throwback to
classic Mcgadcth, with its thrash speed and
multiple solos strung together seamlessly

throughout. "Blood" shows a true return to
classic Megadeth form, something that fans
couldn't be happier about.
Also featured on the album is the theme
song to the recent Xbox 360 game "Gears of
War." While the song is a little underwhelm-

ling, it's still
unique in that
its writing style
is noticeably
different since
it was written
> for a video
game, again
! showcasing
Mustaine's ver
satility.
"United
112 Abominations"
also features a
remake of the
I classic
Megadeth song

"A Tout Le
Monde (Set Me Free)." It's strange to hear a
band cover itself and even though there arc a
few additions, most noticeably the vocal talents
of Lacuna Coil's female lead singer Cristina

Scabhia, the song still sounds the same as it did
when it was released 13 years ago on
Megadeth's sixth album. "Youthanasia."
As the album title and cover imply,
"United Abominations" focuses on the polit
ical failures of the United Nations and the
problems in modern international relations.
All the songs on the album arc heavily en
trenched in Mustaine's political rhetoric,
from the IJ.N.-bashing title track to the Mid
dle-East policy commentary of "Amcrikhas
tan." Mustaine truly believes metal can
change the world and he isn't afraid to let
people know about it, in person or in studio.
Overall, the album is a true return to
form for Megadcth, a band that has been
struggling with its image and sound for the
better part of the last decade. The new lineup
is more cohesive than ever and Mustaine's
songwriting ability is still alive and well.
Though there are a few misses on the album,
all in all it's their strongest offering in many
years and should leave fans excited for the fu
ture of one of the world's biggest metal bands.
