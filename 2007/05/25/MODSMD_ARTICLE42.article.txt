## Satura Cakes: Get extraordinary bites 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION CAKE EATER 
Satura Cakes on University Drive
is a cute pastry and cotiee shop that

truly lives up to its
slogan, "Never
Another Ordin;iry
Bite." From the
classic chocolate
cake, to the straw
berry chocolate
tart and the crois
sants, every
dessert has a
unique look and
taste to it that
makes this cake
shop a special
dessert place.
The first thing
1 noticed when 1

walked into Satura Cakes was how
quaint the store was. The brightly
colored coffee mugs and the vi
brant flowers at every corner in
the store gave the store a dazzling
and fun atmosphere. In addition,
the huge pictures on the walls of
the different types of cakes pre

pared my stomach for the delights
about to come. The vast amount of
pastries can be overwhelming, but
as they are all made of organic in
gredients and are not too too large

(unlike the Cheesecake Factory's
desserts), indulging in one of these
pastries felt less unhealthy than it
would at a different restaurant.
By far, my favorite dessert was
the classic chocolate cake, a rich
chocolate cake layered with milk
chocolate mousse and coated with

chocolate pecans and diced al
monds. The milk chocolate was of
the perfect richness, and the layer
of nuts covering the mousse and
cake layers added the perfect
touch to the cake. I also loved
their homemade marshmallows;
coming in lemon, passion fruit
and strawberry flavors, these soft
marshmallows melted in the
mouth and really had an exquisite
taste. If you love fruits, 1 would
suggest the Satura shortcake (a
light sponge cake with berries and
fresh cream) or the sesame white
chocolate dessert, which mixed
white chocolate with dried fruit
inside (kind of like an upscale ver
sion of trail mix).
Jf you are not into sweet stuff,
you should definitely try the crispy
brioche, which is a cup-cake look
ing mix of brioche, cookie dough
and organic sugar. This was my sec
ond favorite dessert because it
might have been one of the best and
most unique tasting breads 1 had
ever had, and it was also a nice
break from the heavier, sweeter
desserts. Another item 1 would sug

gest are the huge cream puffs,
which for $3 each (or 5 for $ 10), are
big spheres of crispy, thick crust
filled with a green tea or vanilla
bean filling. They are a bit heavy,
but if you are a cream puff fan.

these big treats will make you
happy. One of their most extraordi
nary pastries they offered that 1 had
never seen before in a pastry or
cake shop was the French toast,
which was a foccacia bread covered
in maple syrup and glaze. Although
looking a little better than it tasted,
the French toast was very, very

good, especially if you are in the
mood for something different.
The only disappointing dessert
was the cheesecake, which was a little
too cheesy for my palate. However, I
must say that the graham cracker and

pecan crust
was, like
everything
else, quite de
lectable. The
store also
seems to make
a lot of big
cakes for spe
cial events, al
though they
are a bit pricey
(around $40
for a cake that
feeds 10 peo-

pie). Overall, though, the prices are
not too bad (around $3 to $4 for a pas
try), and they all seem to have a little
twist to them that makes them worth
it. So, if you are walking around
downtown Palo Alto, this modern,
Japanese-style pastry shop is a cute
place to go to if you want to get an ex
quisite and delicious treat.
