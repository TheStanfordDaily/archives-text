# Give 'Zodiac' a chance this Sunday
## 
### 
This Sunday, "Zodiac" is playing at FLiCKS. The
movie was so well received that it only grossed approxi
mately $43 million worldwide, while its budget was some
where in the neighborhood of $60 million. Ouch. That's
not quite Kevin Costner territory (really, are they still let
ting that Costner guy make movies?), but it's got to hurt
the movie studio nonetheless.
The sad thing is, though, is that while the flick might not
have been so well received by audiences after all, review
ers actually kind of dug it. Moviefonc.com's average crit
ic rating is 80/100, including two 100s. What gives?
We're not sure, since, like most of the American pub
lic, we haven't seen it either. But since you'll have a
chance to check it out for free this weekend, and given
these fairly positive critical reviews, we'd like to kindly
suggest that you consider giving it a shot. Obviously,

we're not in a position to give you a taste for this movie
ourselves, so instead we're going to opt for allowing oth
ers to do that for us.
Besides, remember, it's Memorial Day this weekend.
What could be more patriotic than going to a classic
"killer goes psycho and kills everyone" movie? Uh,
right?
"It spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex
and then deeper still, fascinating us as much for what we
don't know as what we do."
Owen Glcibcrman, Entertainment Weekly
"It's part police procedural, part monster movie, a fune
real entertainment that is an unexpected repudiation of
Mr. Fincher's most famous movie, the serial-killer fiction

'Seven,' as well as a testament to this cinematic savant's
gifts."
Manohla Dargis, The New York Times
"Put your whodunit expectations away when you visit
Zodiac. It's the process that pins you to your scat."
Peter Travers. Rolling Stone
"Could it be that a killer randomly picking off individuals
and couples simply isn't as scary as it used to be?"
Kevin Crust, Los Angeles Times
"Zodiac is long-over two and a half hours-but when it's
over, you almost wish it had gone on for another 20 min
utes, just to see every end get tied up... it's a hell of a ride."
Dana Stevens, Slate
