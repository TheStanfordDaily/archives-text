## Dear Ms. Azia Kim... 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION SHOCKED AWED 
I tip my hat to you. Many of us actual Stanford students read your story in
awed delight yesterday, hut 1 for one saw through the carefully orchestrated de
ceit to the underlying genius of your plan. You are an American heroine for
managing to pull a fast one on so many of us who considered ourselves the best
and the brightest. Turning lemons into lemonade — or rather, I should say, a
free college education — is no easy feat, but you, Ms. A/.ia Kim are a master
mind, deserving to be ranked up there with Frank Abagnale and D.B. Cooper
as one of the greatest con artists of the 20th century.

How proud your parents must have felt when they heard you would be at
tending Stanford in the fall of 2006. My question to you is whether they were in
on it from the beginning or if you were planning on waiting until graduation to
spring your little secret on them. If they were in on it, they must have recognized

your entrepreneurial spirit — you were well on your way to sneaking into a

board position at Enron, perhaps. If they weren't in on it, I can't

imagine the kind of pressure they must have put on you that
you would have to fake being a student at Stanford just so that
they would get off your back. You know what they say, a dia-

mond can only be created with heat and pressure which (con
gratulations!) you have plenty of now. I hear it goes well with

shame. '
If you don't mind, I'd like to pinpoint the incredible brilliance of
your scam. You must have done your homework. How else would

you have known to slip into Kimball, a dorm where student intcrac- *
tion (and thus, word of mouth) is as rare as fork in a Chinese restau
rant? On top of that, you chose the single largest undergraduate major
to "study" — Humßio. Who's going to notice you in a giant lecture hall?

No one — exactly. )
And then there was the remarkable move of saying, "Oh. don't niind
me, I'm just a displaced freshman with nowhere to live." Hacking into the
roommate's email account to give Housing the thumbs up on your squatting

was simply inspired. I think I saw that on "Mission: Impossible." Right alter "
he climbs in through the window because he doesn't have a key. Sound famil
iar?
I vote that they should award you, Ms. Kim, with honorary student status.
Anyone who is smart enough to fool 14,000+ Stanford students in addition to the
staffs in two dorms a/uiStudenl Housing deserves some recognition. Hell, I bare
ly got away with a tiny stain on my carpet last year, but you were able to get away
with eight freaking months of free housing! They would have never caught you
if you hadn't slipped. I bet you probably could have gotten a degree from the
university had you stayed under the radar.
The only drawbacks to your plan were the potential ramifications lor your
roommate from Okada — her parents just found out that their daughter was
sleeping with her boyfriend so much that she practically wasn t even in the room
they were paying for. Oy. I know my parents would kill me. I can t even imagine
what hers will do to her.
You are now number five on Google trends. You will undeniably be in (he
local, if not national news. These are your fifteen minutes, A/.ia Kim revel in
their glory. Though the University has deemed you unworthy to be here, I salute

you. Azia Kim. In less than 24 hours, you have become something of a living leg
end. You may not be graduating from Stanford, in fact you may have never even
been admitted into the school in the first place, but there are plenty of other
places that arc in dire need of people with your level of underhanded deception.
If not, at least we know that you have a long career in cat burglary ahead of you.
You knew exactly how to play the system and by golly, you are amazing Azia
Kim. Good luck out there, you're going to need it.
