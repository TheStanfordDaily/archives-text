INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS
America. The country where, at least in
theory, you have the personal freedom
k to do almost whatever you choose. Un
■ fortunately, however, you do not have
112 the right to do whomever you choose.
Or even if you do have the right, it's not
culturally acceptable.
Roxy isn't specifically referring to
gay marriage, although that is a very
crucial issue of personal freedom in this
k countr>'. She just thinks it goes much
m deeper. How much sexual freedom do
■ we as Americans truly have?
The American college experience is

generally
thought of a

as a time
to ex
peri-

ment sexually, often with multiple part
ners. That's certainly what barely legal,
fresh-out-of-high-school Roxy thought
as she moved into her freshman dorm.
Boy (or girl... she's not choosy), was she
excited to finally get some real college
ass. Then she learned about red zone, yel
low zone, green zone.
Just in case you don't know what that
is. it's this system in some dorms that
governs who you can date or mess
around with. Fall quarter is the red
zone: pretty much anyone in your dorm
is off limits to your advances. During
winter quarter/yellow zone, the boldest
will start adding a few notches to their
dormcest belts. Only in spring quarter
does Stanford reach the green zone:
pretty much anything goes — RAs.

You hear, Roxy? Non<
Perhaps if certain

members of the
current adminis
tration had gotten

more in college, we
wouldn't have so

to marry whomever they
choose. Only those jealous of

the fantastic sex lives of others would
bother so much about stopping

people in love from getting
married. Really, what can be
the harm in that? America is M
supposed to be the land of the

free, so why does such a large portion
of our population lack this basic right?
And let's take a closer look at inter
racial relationships. Roxy knows that
marriages between members of differ
ent races are no longer illegal (al
though it hasn't been too long since
they were, especially in some areas) but
are they accepted by most of society?
Here in the Stanford bubble and the
larger Bay Area, interracial relation
ships appear to be fairly common.
However, in other areas of the nation
this is not the case, and people feel a lot
of pressure to marry someone from a
similar ethnic background
Roxy's point, dear readers, is that
America is not free. Even within the
Stanford community, prejudices
brought from elsewhere and arbitrary

conventions
like red zone,
yellow zone, green
zone touch all of
our lives. And
once we leave
Stanford for the
"real" world, we
enter a country
not nearly as free
dom-embracing as

we advertise ourselves to be.
Not that Roxy expects any
one to be surprised to hear
that. Globally, the idea that

Ameri-
ca is the "Land of

the Free" is pretty

much a joke, Roxy hears.
And there is an easy, even plea-

surable way for college students to
combat that. You know where this is
Roxy, once again, encourages her
readers to have sex when, where, and
with whom they want. Do it for your
self. Do it for your partner(s). Do it for
Dick and Bush. Do it for America.
