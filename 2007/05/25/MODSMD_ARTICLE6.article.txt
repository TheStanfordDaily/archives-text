Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
wore a wide grin as she kicked off her
morning yesterday at Palo Alto's Hewlett-
Packard (HP) Labs. After touring the facil
ities, Rice and Australian Foreign Minister
Alex Downer enthusiastically champi
oned the importance of technological de
velopments in the global market.
"I think the most important thing we've
had a chance to do is to remember how im
portant the innovation and entrepreneur
ship are to global competitiveness," Rice
said,"particularly in the United States."
Deviating from her discussion about
her tour of the HP lab. Rice touched on the

raging civil conflict in Lebanon after being
peppered by questions from the press.
"The Lebanese government is very
much trying to do the light thing here, to
protect its population against the extrem
ists who enforce discord and instability
there,"she said."l think the world is speak
ing out in favor of the Lebanese govern
ment."
"I was in touch with people back in
Washington about it just a little bit ago. and
I certainly hope that the Lebanese govern
ment will be able to deal with these ex
tremists." she added. "It's just another ex
ample of extremists in the Middle East
who are trying to destabilize democratic
governments."
Mark Hurd. HP's CEO. also talked
about the company's history and its long
standing relationship with Stanford. lIP
was founded in 1939 by Stanford gradu
ates Bill Hewlett '34 and David Packard
'34.

"I hear the endowment of Stanford
University and its annual revenue, and by
Australian standards, it's staggering,"
Downer said. "Very much the core of
[1 IP's success] is a very heavy investment
in education."
"In our country, we're putting more and
more emphasis on that." he added. "We're
setting up a massive national endowment
for the universities, and we'll be building
on that in the years ahead."
Rice and Downer followed the visit with
a luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel in
East Palo Alto, dining with Tech Net offi
cials and taking a drive in aTesla Roadster,
a fully electric sports car. Rice spent the af
ternoon with schoolchildren at the James
Flood School's Center for a New Genera
tion in Menlo Park. Rice and her late father
founded the center 16 years ago.
