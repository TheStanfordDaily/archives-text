# IMPOSTER I:
## Yearbook forced Kim's exposure Dormmates, high school peers of squatter student wonder how, why 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
"Good luck on finals," wrote Amanda Kim,
posting on her sister's MySpace Web site last
week.
For the average Stanford student, such a post
might elicit a quick thank you.
But A/ia Kim. who was revealed by The Daily
yesterday to be an imposter in campus dorms for
eight months, evidently had more important
things to worry about than finals.
And now that Kim's story is out. Stanford stu
dents are struggling to come to grips with the real
ity that the person down the hall may not be who
she says she is.
It all started to unravel for Kim when the
Okada dorm staff decided to make a yearbook.
The woman had been living in Room 108 since
the beginning of spring quarter, and they wanted
to make sure she had a space in the memory
book.
But the staff soon realized that they didn't have
any information about her — like the fact that she
graduated from Fullerton, Calif.'s Troy High
School last June or the fact that her high school
classmates thought she would be attending a com
munity college and then transferring to UC-
Berkeley.
lliat's when one staff member started to ask
tough questions. And then the jig was up for the
18-year-old squatter.
Media poured onto campus, as Kim retreated
from an uncle's house in San Jose to her parents'
home in the Los Angeles area, according to Okada
residents. The questions on everybody's mind:
How and why did she do it?
In exclusive interviews with a number of
Kim's high school colleagues. 'Ilie Daily has
learned intimate details about Kim's character,
the perceived pressure placed on students in her
competitive high school and how she deceived
both her friends and parents from the very be
ginning.
Students React
At a 25-minute meeting for
Okada residents in the dorm's
lounge last night at 9:30 p.m., staff re
portedly said that Kim had a Stan
ford student identification card,
which some speculated she got dur
ing a summer program on the Farm.
The meeting was closed to the press,
but a male resident who attended the
session shared the information re
vealed by the RAs on the condition
of anonymity.
"They told us the mechanics of
how she got in and how she worked
through the systems," he said. " Hie
staff went into how a lot of it was
luck, how she'd been extremely
lucky at working the system."
John Giammalva, the residence
dean of Wilbur and Stern, was given
the task of notifying Kim's parents
that their daughter was living a lie,
according to students familiar with
the series of events put in motion on
Monday.
"The parents were completely in
the dark," said the Okada resident
who attended last night's meeting.
"Where did they think their $50,(HX)
a year was going?"
In Kimball, where Kim lived for
two quarters — often sleeping in the
lounge and eating in the dining halls
— the woman's closest friends shut
themselves off. And in Okada,
where Kim often climbed through
the window of Room 108 to get to
her belongings, residential staff ad
vised residents not to talk to out
siders.
Across the University, Residen
tial Education and Stanford I lousing
officials were specifically instructed
to direct their comments toward an
official University spokesperson
and, in the dorms, resident fellows
were asked to remain mute about
any information they received.
Some students, however, were an
gered by what they perceived to be
the University's silence.
"This shows the incompetence of
the system." said Mikael Solomon '09,
an Okada resident."l'm disappointed
at I lousing and the administration for
letting this go on for so long."
University Response
"We, as an institution, have an ob
ligation to ensure that this never
happens again," Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Greg Hoardman
told a group of reporters in a press
conference yesterday.
Administrators acknowledged
that the Stanford community was
shocked by the news.
"Our students tend to be ex
tremely trusting and very caring."
said University spokesperson Kate

Chesley.
While Boardman and Chesley
would not comment on the specifics
of the ongoing police investigation
or the University's own internal in
quiry into Kim's duplicitous actions
over the last eight months. Board
man told The Daily that the Univer
sity is not considering implementing
any kind of lockdown of the school
at this point.
The Roots of Deceit
Just like the students on campus
that she befriended, Kim's high
school classmates say they were com
pletely shocked to hear the news.
"She was probably one of the last
people I would expect this to come
from," said a classmate of Kim's who
now attends a University of Califor
nia school. "Out of all my friends, 1
would have to rate Kim as one of the
sweetest and nicest people I know."
Described by several of her col
leagues as deeply religious, Kim ap
peared to be a healthy and friendly
high school student. Van said that
Kim appeared to have a close-knit
family.
"It seemed like she had a good re
lationship with her parents, especial
ly her mom." he said. "She was telling
me that, when she was at Stanford
this past year, she missed home and
missed her family so much."
Yet to some of those who knew
her, Kim's academic performance
was less than exceptional. A friend of
Kim's who attends one of the na
tion's top schools and who was
granted anonymity by The Daily be
cause of the closeness of his friend
ship with the subject, said that many
students at Troy did not expect Kim
to be accepted into Stanford. In fact,
he said most thought she would be
headed to UC-Berkeley's Spring E-x
tension program.
"Azia wasn't the strongest stu
dent." he said. "The fact that she was
at Stanford was surprising to every
body. She just didn't have the spec
tacular grades or extracurriculars."
Kim's classmate, who now at
tends a UC school, echoed similar
sentiments, describing that few pre
dicted that Kim would have been ac
cepted to Stanford.
"You know two years in advance
that this kid is going to end up at
Harvard, being regarded as being
the top of your class," he said. "Azia
wasn't one of those. I don't think
anyone would say that. But there's
a whole bunch of us kids, on the
fringe of getting into Cal or Stan
ford."
The first time, in fact, that most of
Kim's high school colleagues found
out that Kim was attending Stanford
was during winter break, after the
fall quarter of classes had ended.
"During winter break, she told a
lot of her close friends that she was
going to Stanford, and they accepted
it."the student told The Daily late

last night. "The news then spread
quickly among her Troy classmates."
All of the students who spoke with
Ihe Daily stressed that the pressures
at Troy 1 ligh School and perhaps fam
ily circumstances could have pushed
Kim to keep up the guise.
"Honestly, my best guess would
be something like peer or family
pressure or everyone at Troy ex
celling and doing so well — I guess
she thought she needed to perform
just as well," said a high school friend
of Kim's who currently attends an
elite private college in Southern Cal
ifornia. "It just seemed like she
should have gotten into a school on
par with so many Troy people."
Mental Health
Denise Clark Pope, a lecturer in
the School of Education whose re
search has focused on mental health
and stress in high school and college
students, cited parental pressure as
one reason a student might decide to
pose as an admitted student at Stan
ford.
"One is parental expectations
and the real misconception about
the fact that where you go to school
does not make as big a difference —
if any — as people think it does," she
said. "People could feel they would
n't be loved or would feel shunned
because of a college rejection."
Pope noted similarities between
Kim's decision to pose as a Stanford
student and the tendency of today's
high school students to cheat their
way into prestigious colleges.
"We have so many kids now who
cheat their way through high school
and who get away with it." she said.
"This is another form of cheating. It's
incredibly sad when someone feels
compelled to do this. They need
help."
Pope also said she knew of a
young man who posed as a UC-
Berkeley student 20 years ago for
similar reasons.
"For him it was parental pres
sure." she said. "He didn't have the
guts to tell his parents he didn't get in
and so he lied and said he did."
"ITiis kid was feeling so much
pressure that he had to make up this
horrible lie." she added. "At one
point he almost convinced himself."
The Final Days
On May 17. four days before resi
dential staff would discover the
truth. Kim posted a message on her
newly-created Xanga account.
"I get too caught up in looking
forward to summer and going
home," she wrote,"that 1 forget to be
thankful for the beautiful people
Ciod has placed into my life. 1 love
Stanford."

tial Education and Stanford I lousing
officials were specifically instructed
to direct their comments toward an
official University spokesperson
and, in the dorms, resident fellows
were asked to remain mute about
any information they received.
Some students, however, were an
gered by what they perceived to be
the University's silence.
"This shows the incompetence of
the system." said Mikael Solomon '09,
an Okada resident."l'm disappointed
at I lousing and the administration for
letting this go on for so long."
University Response
"We, as an institution, have an ob
ligation to ensure that this never
happens again," Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Greg Hoardman
told a group of reporters in a press
conference yesterday.
Administrators acknowledged
that the Stanford community was
shocked by the news.
"Our students tend to be ex
tremely trusting and very caring."
said University spokesperson Kate

Chesley.
While Boardman and Chesley
would not comment on the specifics
of the ongoing police investigation
or the University's own internal in
quiry into Kim's duplicitous actions
over the last eight months. Board
man told The Daily that the Univer
sity is not considering implementing
any kind of lockdown of the school
at this point.
The Roots of Deceit
Just like the students on campus
that she befriended, Kim's high
school classmates say they were com
pletely shocked to hear the news.
"She was probably one of the last
people I would expect this to come
from," said a classmate of Kim's who
now attends a University of Califor
nia school. "Out of all my friends, 1
would have to rate Kim as one of the
sweetest and nicest people I know."
Described by several of her col
leagues as deeply religious, Kim ap
peared to be a healthy and friendly
high school student. Van said that
Kim appeared to have a close-knit
family.
"It seemed like she had a good re
lationship with her parents, especial
ly her mom." he said. "She was telling
me that, when she was at Stanford
this past year, she missed home and
missed her family so much."
Yet to some of those who knew
her, Kim's academic performance
was less than exceptional. A friend of
Kim's who attends one of the na
tion's top schools and who was
granted anonymity by The Daily be
cause of the closeness of his friend
ship with the subject, said that many
students at Troy did not expect Kim
to be accepted into Stanford. In fact,
he said most thought she would be
headed to UC-Berkeley's Spring E-x
tension program.
"Azia wasn't the strongest stu
dent." he said. "The fact that she was
at Stanford was surprising to every
body. She just didn't have the spec
tacular grades or extracurriculars."
Kim's classmate, who now at
tends a UC school, echoed similar
sentiments, describing that few pre
dicted that Kim would have been ac
cepted to Stanford.
"You know two years in advance
that this kid is going to end up at
Harvard, being regarded as being
the top of your class," he said. "Azia
wasn't one of those. I don't think
anyone would say that. But there's
a whole bunch of us kids, on the
fringe of getting into Cal or Stan
ford."
The first time, in fact, that most of
Kim's high school colleagues found
out that Kim was attending Stanford
was during winter break, after the
fall quarter of classes had ended.
"During winter break, she told a
lot of her close friends that she was
going to Stanford, and they accepted
it."the student told The Daily late

last night. "The news then spread
quickly among her Troy classmates."
All of the students who spoke with
Ihe Daily stressed that the pressures
at Troy 1 ligh School and perhaps fam
ily circumstances could have pushed
Kim to keep up the guise.
"Honestly, my best guess would
be something like peer or family
pressure or everyone at Troy ex
celling and doing so well — I guess
she thought she needed to perform
just as well," said a high school friend
of Kim's who currently attends an
elite private college in Southern Cal
ifornia. "It just seemed like she
should have gotten into a school on
par with so many Troy people."
Mental Health
Denise Clark Pope, a lecturer in
the School of Education whose re
search has focused on mental health
and stress in high school and college
students, cited parental pressure as
one reason a student might decide to
pose as an admitted student at Stan
ford.
"One is parental expectations
and the real misconception about
the fact that where you go to school
does not make as big a difference —
if any — as people think it does," she
said. "People could feel they would
n't be loved or would feel shunned
because of a college rejection."
Pope noted similarities between
Kim's decision to pose as a Stanford
student and the tendency of today's
high school students to cheat their
way into prestigious colleges.
"We have so many kids now who
cheat their way through high school
and who get away with it." she said.
"This is another form of cheating. It's
incredibly sad when someone feels
compelled to do this. They need
help."
Pope also said she knew of a
young man who posed as a UC-
Berkeley student 20 years ago for
similar reasons.
"For him it was parental pres
sure." she said. "He didn't have the
guts to tell his parents he didn't get in
and so he lied and said he did."
"ITiis kid was feeling so much
pressure that he had to make up this
horrible lie." she added. "At one
point he almost convinced himself."
The Final Days
On May 17. four days before resi
dential staff would discover the
truth. Kim posted a message on her
newly-created Xanga account.
"I get too caught up in looking
forward to summer and going
home," she wrote,"that 1 forget to be
thankful for the beautiful people
Ciod has placed into my life. 1 love
Stanford."

"Good luck on finals," wrote Amanda Kim,
posting on her sister's MySpace Web site last
week.
For the average Stanford student, such a post
might elicit a quick thank you.
But A/ia Kim. who was revealed by The Daily
yesterday to be an imposter in campus dorms for
eight months, evidently had more important
things to worry about than finals.
And now that Kim's story is out. Stanford stu
dents are struggling to come to grips with the real
ity that the person down the hall may not be who
she says she is.
It all started to unravel for Kim when the
Okada dorm staff decided to make a yearbook.
The woman had been living in Room 108 since
the beginning of spring quarter, and they wanted
to make sure she had a space in the memory
book.
But the staff soon realized that they didn't have
any information about her — like the fact that she
graduated from Fullerton, Calif.'s Troy High
School last June or the fact that her high school
classmates thought she would be attending a com
munity college and then transferring to UC-
Berkeley.
lliat's when one staff member started to ask
tough questions. And then the jig was up for the
18-year-old squatter.
Media poured onto campus, as Kim retreated
from an uncle's house in San Jose to her parents'
home in the Los Angeles area, according to Okada
residents. The questions on everybody's mind:
How and why did she do it?
In exclusive interviews with a number of
Kim's high school colleagues. 'Ilie Daily has
learned intimate details about Kim's character,
the perceived pressure placed on students in her
competitive high school and how she deceived
both her friends and parents from the very be
ginning.
Students React
At a 25-minute meeting for
Okada residents in the dorm's
lounge last night at 9:30 p.m., staff re
portedly said that Kim had a Stan
ford student identification card,
which some speculated she got dur
ing a summer program on the Farm.
The meeting was closed to the press,
but a male resident who attended the
session shared the information re
vealed by the RAs on the condition
of anonymity.
"They told us the mechanics of
how she got in and how she worked
through the systems," he said. " Hie
staff went into how a lot of it was
luck, how she'd been extremely
lucky at working the system."
John Giammalva, the residence
dean of Wilbur and Stern, was given
the task of notifying Kim's parents
that their daughter was living a lie,
according to students familiar with
the series of events put in motion on
Monday.
"The parents were completely in
the dark," said the Okada resident
who attended last night's meeting.
"Where did they think their $50,(HX)
a year was going?"
In Kimball, where Kim lived for
two quarters — often sleeping in the
lounge and eating in the dining halls
— the woman's closest friends shut
themselves off. And in Okada,
where Kim often climbed through
the window of Room 108 to get to
her belongings, residential staff ad
vised residents not to talk to out
siders.
