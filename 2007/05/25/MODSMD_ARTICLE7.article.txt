# IMPOSTER I:
## Yearbook forced Kim's exposure Dormmates, high school peers of squatter student wonder how, why

"Good luck on finals," wrote Amanda Kim,
posting on her sister's MySpace Web site last
week.
For the average Stanford student, such a post
might elicit a quick thank you.
But A/ia Kim. who was revealed by The Daily
yesterday to be an imposter in campus dorms for
eight months, evidently had more important
things to worry about than finals.
And now that Kim's story is out. Stanford stu
dents are struggling to come to grips with the real
ity that the person down the hall may not be who
she says she is.
It all started to unravel for Kim when the
Okada dorm staff decided to make a yearbook.
The woman had been living in Room 108 since
the beginning of spring quarter, and they wanted
to make sure she had a space in the memory
book.
But the staff soon realized that they didn't have
any information about her â€” like the fact that she
graduated from Fullerton, Calif.'s Troy High
School last June or the fact that her high school
classmates thought she would be attending a com
munity college and then transferring to UC-
Berkeley.
lliat's when one staff member started to ask
tough questions. And then the jig was up for the
18-year-old squatter.
Media poured onto campus, as Kim retreated
from an uncle's house in San Jose to her parents'
home in the Los Angeles area, according to Okada
residents. The questions on everybody's mind:
How and why did she do it?
In exclusive interviews with a number of
Kim's high school colleagues. 'Ilie Daily has
learned intimate details about Kim's character,
the perceived pressure placed on students in her
competitive high school and how she deceived
both her friends and parents from the very be
ginning.
