## What you didn't know about Darwin 
### 
Charles Darwin hated his nose. In fact,
he thought it so unsightly that it was
evidence against intelligent design. In
a letter to a friend, he wrote about an ongo
ing conversation with his colleague. Charles
LyeU.
"I have lately been corresponding with
LyeU, who. I think, adopts your idea of the
stream of variation having been led or de
signed I have asked him (and he says he will
hereafter reflect and answer me) whether he
believes that the shape of my nose was de
signed."
1 can almost hear Darwin sniffing offend
edly as he penned the next phrase: "If he
does, I have nothing more to say."
Darwin's "Origin of Species" will soon
turn 150. Just in time for the birthday party,
S,(XX) letters to and from Darwin were recent
ly published online as part of Cambridge Uni
versity's Darwin Correspondence Project.
Darwin's name gets slammed a lot. "Dar
win vs. Compassion" is the title of one article
on the Creationist Web site "Answers in Gen
esis." "Darwinism and the Nazi Race Holo
caust" is the title of an article on another Cre
ationist Website. In a post about teaching her
kids science, a homeschool mom exhorts:
"Praise be to God — not Darwin."
But Darwin himself hardly deserves all
the vitriol heaped upon his name in blog
posts and message boards.
Darwin the person was a family man, a
man who originally studied to be aclergyper
son. a man who shuddered to think of the im

plications of his theory.This is what he wrote
to his closest friend:
"I am almost convinced (quite contrary to
opinion 1 started with) that species are not (it
is like confessing a murder) immutable."
Can you hear the shaking in his voice?
Darwin knew what he was getting into. After
his fateful trip on the HMS Beagle, Darwin
was very ill for most of his adult life. I le suf
fered. according to Robert Wright's The
Moral Animal: "violent shivering and vomit
ing attacks, gastric pain and epic flatulence,
faintness and heart palpitations." Suggested
causes include Meniere's disease, chronic fa
tigue syndrome and Chagas disease, which
Darwin could have caught from an insect bite
during his trip on the Beagle.
An alternate explanation for Darwin's ill
ness is that his suffering was actually psycho
somatic. After all, he was not ignorant of the
fact that his idea would offend the religious
sensibilities of — well.just about everyone, in
cluding his beloved (and devout) wife Emma.
Maybe because of Emma's concern, Dar
win kept his biggest idea to himself for two

decades.
Darwin came up with the idea of evolu
tion by natural selection while traveling
through South America on the Beagle. He
was hired as a companion for Robert Fitzroy.
the ship's captain. (It would not be proper for
the captain to assuage his loneliness by ca
vorting with the low-class sailors, so he had to
bring along his own company.)
Darwin also served as the ship's natural
ist, making endless observations about the
new territory and collecting hundreds of
specimens. His collections provided the raw
material for his thesis, but Darwin sat on his
ideas for 20 years.
Not that he was idle. He managed to pro
duce 10 children,printed his journals from the
journey on the Beagle and spent eight years
studying barnacles, sealing his reputation as a
biologist by becoming an expert in the field.
1 lis published works on several phyla are con
sulted even today.
Darwin set up a home office with hundreds
of barnacle specimens. His children took it as
a matter of course. One of his young sons vis
ited a neighbor's home and was confused by
the homeowner's lack of the crusty creatures.
"Where does he do his barnacles?" the
boy asked.
Charles Darwin was destined for bigger
things than barnacles. But between his reli
gious qualms and his marathon vomiting,
who knows how long he would have dithered
before publishing his crucial insight? Finally
something forced his hand.

One of today s most slammed kept quiet about theories tor two decades, avidly studied
barnades — and was less than satisfied with his appearance

In 1848, Darwin got a letter than must
have sent chills up his spine. The letter was
from Alfred Russel Wallace, a British natu
ralist and contemporary of Darwin. In his let
ter. he detailed his own thoughts about how
species evolved. Wallace had independently
come up with natural selection as well.
Darwin was almost scooped! He rushed
out a copy of "The Origin of Species." It sold
out in a single day.and the world has never
been the same.

But the book was almost never born.
Amazingly, Darwin's bulbous nose nearly
kept him from ever boarding the Beagle.
Captain Fitzroy was a big believer in physiog
nomy. and he saw Darwin's nose as a sign of
a weak character. Luckily, the captain over
came his prejudices, and Darwin (and his
nose) went down in history.
