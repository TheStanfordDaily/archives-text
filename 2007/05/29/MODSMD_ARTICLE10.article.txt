## Editorial Board 2008 candidates should heed Clark 
### 
Stanford in Government and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau deserve credit for
landing a very solid performance by
this year's spring speaker. Gen. Wesley
Clark (ret.). TTie 2004 presidential hopeful's
speech brought attention to important is
sues that will need to be addressed in the
2008 election.
After warming up the crowd with an an
ecdote about why he liked the enthusiasm
of Stanford students and saying he was
looking forward to a dialogue, Clark began
by discussing his time in the military,and the
loss of purpose that he said affected the
armed forces after the breakup of the Sovi
et Union.The military was still searching for
a strategy in the post-Cold War world. Clark
said, and was unready to adjust to crises in
Haiti and the Balkans. In his mind, these
earlier struggles were roots of some of the
issues encountered in Iraq today, and the
military still needs to be revised and
recharged.
In the case of Rwanda, Clark said, the
military could not act at all. but not because
it was lacking capacity. In a revealing mo
ment. Clark bitterly recalled how he was
commissioned to write a plan for deploying
troops into Rwanda while serving as a
strategic planning official in the Pentagon,
only to be told by his commander that it was
politically impossible. "That's haunted me,"
he said, adding that the experienced helped
fuel his commitment to taking action in
Darfur. Clark currently serves on the board
of the International Crisis Group, one of the
main advocates for international interven
tion in the Sudanese genocide. When asked
what he would do to resolve the situation,
he nailed the response, declaring that he'd

have already deployed NATO troops on the
ground.
In what seemed to be the more formula
ic. campaign part of the speech. Clark out
lined a three-tiered plan for the future of the
United States, lie highlighted the need to
get out of Iraq gracefully in order to rebuild
U.S. legitimacy, invest in healthcare and ed
ucation to keep the U.S. competitive, and
start rebuilding international institutions
and relationships with allies that have been
damaged.
Perhaps Clark's most important message
— and one worth taking to heart — is that
"we're going to solve the national security
question." In other words. Al-Qaeda is not
the existential threat to the U.S. that the
Bush administration has portrayed. ITie
United States was able not only to survive,
he argued, but to prosper during the Cold
War decades that saw thousands of nuclear
missiles aimed at the country every day." We
weren't petrified by it. we weren't cowed by
it, we weren't intimidated by it."he said. Ac
knowledging terrorism as a challenge. Clark
argued that paranoia is unhelpful and un
necessary. "We've lived five years under the
threat of fear, and the threat has been ma
nipulated."
Even if Clark is not ultimately a presi
dential hopeful this cycle, the other candi
dates would do well to integrate some of his
points into their own campaign platforms.
He may not have the massive fundraising
necessary to be a serious candidate, but the
Rhodes Scholar and decorated former gen
eral is worth listening to closely. If nothing
else. Clark's speech at Stanford showed that
any eventual winner, from either party,
could benefit from his advice.
