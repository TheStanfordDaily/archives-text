Although I'm an atheist on most days,
I think about God on a regular basis.
ITiis is unsurprising, as I spent 12
years in a Catholic school, taking mandato
ry theology classes. ()ne of the most impor
tant things 1 learned in the convent is that
the majority of people want quite desper
ately to believe there's a reason behind it all.
Why are we alive? Why doesn't God speak
to me? Why do bad things happen to good
people? ITiese are all questions that people
spend endless sermons, books and prayers
on. 'ITiey are questions that most people
can't bear to leave unanswered.
I see these God-related queries popping up
everywhere, most clearly in people's respons
es to my own writing about global warming, a
topic which many are so scared of that they'll
go to any lengths not to discuss it. or even to
prove its nonexistence. In these objections to
my writing, I sense a God-query writhing
below the surface. What's scary about global
warming, beyond the obvious fact that it
threatens future generations of human life, is
that it begs this hardest ofhard questions: Why
do bad things happen to good people?
When theologians come up with expla
nations for this question, they're called
theodicies. A theodicy attempts to explain
how an omniscient, omnipotent, omni
benevolent God can allow awful things,
whether perpetrated by an axe murderer or
an avalanche, to happen to human beings.
With reference to my own pet issue, glob
al warming, this question surfaces both overt
ly and subtextually as: Why would God let
global warming happen to human beings? It
gets knottier when we remember that people
are the ones causing global warming with
their addictions to driving, jet setting, factory
production, etc. Why, then, would God let hu
mans do such a terrible thing? The knots get
tighter when we reflect that global warming
was set into motion before any of us were
born. It's not entirely our fault, but virtually
none of us is not at fault. We've all driven cars,
watched televisions, used blenders. We've all
contributed to this big sin with our little sins.
Why would a good God let this happen?
We'd like to think we can avoid disaster at
every turn, if only we're wily enough. Some
people like to think that God will intervene
with miracles at just the right moment.There
is a huge resistance to the idea that very bad
things can happen to very good people for no
discernable or remediable reason. A famous
theodicy, the free will theodicy, posits that
freewill is essential to the human experience.
If God stepped in at every turn to avert evil,
we'd never have the opportunity to make bad
choices, and we'd thus miss out on the 'full'
human experience, which is presumably one
huge 'learn from your mistakes' lesson.
Some theologians weave natural disas
ters into this theodicy, painting God as an
uninvolved being who allows for natural dis
asters to occur, but never inserts I ler divine
hands into the messy situation. In this view,
nature operates by its own. immovable laws.
Human beings are allowed to make choices

for themselves. I ssentially. we have a level
ground on which the rules are clear, it unfair.
At least, in this theodicy, we know how
things work. We know God isn't going to
swoop in with convenient miracles.
Many people like to surrender them
selves to an involved God who shapes each
ot our destinies with I ler loving provenance,
ensuring, as some people are so sickeningly
fond of saying, that everything is for the
best. But if I were to believe in a God, 1
would certainly prefer the Free Will God to
the Intimately Involved God. What use is
living if you have no say in it?
But if we accept this God-free responsi
bility for our lives on I arth. the responsibil
ity for dealing with disasters is entirely in
our hands. There is going to be no last
minute bail out. no divine justice. There is
only what we choose to do about this messy
intersection of nature and human choice
that is global warming. Denying its existence
can only be called irresponsibility. Ibe sci
ence is in. the evidence is clear. Whether you
believe in (iod or not, there are many com
pelling reasons to care whether the coasts
are flooded within the next hundred years.
If you believe in a benevolent God,
surely there is some virtue in working to
improve the lives of generations to come. If
you don't believe in (iod. humanity is all
you've got.The continuation of human life
is your only stab at immortality, if that's
anything you care about. Essentially, mak
ing choices for the good of the future, for
the good of your children or someone
else's, is the undeniably necessary path that
our nation and the rest of the world needs
to walk down. Quibbling about the de
crease in job opportunities, market in
equity, technological viability, etc. will only
hinder this effort and make us weak and
blame-worthy in the eyes of the precari
ously-balanced future generations.
I have never believed so whole-heartedly
in anything, and that includes God's presence
or lack thereof, as I do in the fight against
global warming. When you go home this sum
mer, and when you begin to live the rest of
your life after college, remember that this is an
age in which personal choices are ones that
will define human life for centuries to come.
This is an unprecedented moment of histori
cal urgency.and whether there is a God or not,
we all have an obligation to take action, be
cause our future is not a divine guarantee.
