# The 						Azia Kim supremacy
## 
### 
Azia Kim is the fairy godmother, the
boogeyman, the ace of spades, the
Grail Knight. A fearsome interloper,
infiltrating our Green Zone like a stealth
bomb sleeper cell. A confidence artist playing
on the unbelievable naivete of our danger
ously clueless populace. A rebel hero punc
turing through the fattened stratosphere of
our own entitlement. The tragic end product
of a generation of high school kids raised for
glory and doomed for a mid-life breakdown
before they reach the legal drinking age.
Depending on who you ask, Azia Kim
proves once and for all that private-school
kids, women. Koreans or 1 lumßio majors are
crazy. Azia Kim. Isn't that name perfect? Like
out of a mass-market paperback espionage
thriller by ("live Cussler. Azia Kim. mystery
fenime bomb, the spy next door, Stanford's
own Madame Butterfly.

She wanted only to live in peace and quiet
prosperity. Half a life was enough for her.
Barred from the library, spurned by the gym,
never to attend a ski trip, never to vote in our
pointless student government elections, she
could have cared less. She wanted other peo
ple to believe she was a Stanford student, and
maybe she wanted to believe it herself. She al
ways studied for tests she would never take,
whereas I never study for tests 1 always fail.

Azia Kim will never have a normal life,
limit! moralists who beg for her privacy are
missing the point. Would you beg for Teddy
Roosevelt's privacy, or Gandhi's, or Jesus's?
She belongs to history now. Books will be
written with her as a subject: psychological
texts, sociological screeds, tell-alls by the peo
ple who knew her, an autobiography mid
wited by the ghostwriter of O.J. Simpson's "If
I Did It."
A fictionalized version of her story could
make for frothy farce —an 80s'-style sex
comedy, where the fake student teaches all
the uptight squares what college is really all
about. In the interest of broadening the de
mographics. Kim would be masculinized and
deracinated into a plucky street urchin played
by George Michael from "Arrested Develop-



Darren
Franich
Ire and Vice
ment." with Paul Giamatti as crusty
old President I iennessy, hot on the
fake's trail.
Already, like moths to a superno
va. Facehook groups in praise of Azia
Kim have appeared out of the ether.
"1 Got Azia Kimmed By Housing,"
one ruminates, exasperated that a
non-matriculating con artist could
get a better living situation than half
the school. "Let Azia Stay!" pro
claims another, arguing that her inge
nuity justifies her continued partici
pation in the Class of 10. People love
Azia Kim. She's done something
truly different. All we can ever hope
for is the extraordinary.
Some idiots fail to recognize the
goddess in the doorway. This is a se
curity issue, they say. * i don't feel
safe. An Asian girl attended classes!
She told silly lies and lived like a
hobo! Sound the trumpets, alert the
National Guard, tell my mother 1
love her!" Some even compared this
to Virginia Tech, accomplishing the
significant feat of making A/.ia Kim
look sane.
Remember after 9/11. how every
five seconds there was a new securi
ty issue? CIA warns: Your next
credit card report may contain an
thrax! Amber Alert: Terrorists want
to nuke the space needle! Intelli
gence indicates: Time traveling
Muslims blow up Columbus! We are
a culture of cowards, raised to seek
protection rather than learn to deal
with our fear. We welcome dystopia
with open arms. Liberty dies to the
sound of thunderous applause.
When my dad went to school
here, there weren't so many cops. It's
different now, he says, it's more dan
gerous. I don't think so. People are
just more scared now. Instead of
learning to accept the fear, we swathe
ourselves in security: emergency blue
lights, more cops. II) cards, retina
scans, password protection. Implant
a chip in your brain and you'll be safe
forever and ever! In the process, our
campus, which used to be so relaxed,
so otherworldly, so much better, has
become overregulated and overrid
den with safety nuts.
1 lere's a story about campus safe
ty. A couple nights ago, 1 was at a
Suites party, themed "The Beer
lympics." l.oud music, drinking
games, old friends, a couple making
out on the couch and then the bean
bag. Around 2:30, just as the gold
medalist was slurring his victory
speech, the cops showed up.They saw
the one girl at the party who still had
a beer in her hand and asked to see
her ID. And golly miss molly.she was
over 21.The pointlessness of their ex
istence reaffirmed, the cops deliv
ered an anguished soliloquy about
how we happy drunken few were
wasting their time with our loud
music, distracting them from real cop

work. One of them even said that
they were there to stop "murders," a
notion offensive to reality itself, since
they still haven't found your laptop
or your bicycle.
Exotic Erotic — where, rumors
say, Azia Kim made out with a lucky
fellow who. like Bottom from "A
Midsummer Night's Dream," will
live the rest of his life knowing he
danced with a beautiful demon
queen — was lame this year.
Maybe it was always lame. But I
have faith that everything is some
one's fault, so I asked a nearby offi
cer. "Was it worth it?"
"What?" he replied.
"All this. man. All this precaution.
All the security."
"We're just trying to have a safe
event."
"Yeah, but at what cost? This
party used to be so much fun."
"Well, maybe this year there'll be
less date rapes." he said, and walked
away.
Hell, maybe he's right. Nobody
wants to be blown up. Nobody wants
to get gunned down. If Azia Kim
were a man, her story would not
seem so amusing. But even so her de
ception was an extreme case. Virginia
lech was an extreme case. Sept. 11
was an extreme case. Should we live
our lives according to the worst case
scenario?
We don't need any more security.
We need to learn how to live in the
real world. Azia Kim was only suc
cessful because we accepted her im
possibly vague story. According to
post-Sept. 11 doctrine, the thing to do
now would be to demand to see an
ID card whenever you meet some
one. and just in case lock up all the
quiet Asian girls in the middle of
nowhere (oh. how good of the Uni
versity to already have East!). We are
smarter than that.
The lesson to take from"The Azia
Kim Supremacy" is not that we need
more protection. The lesson is that
more security is meaningless. In the
Information Age, this kind of con
isn't supposed to last for a day, much
less a year. But there will always be
cracks to slip through. Someday, the
worst will happen. Someday, there
will be another terrorist attack on
American soil. We need to accept our
fear and move on. We need to learn
to live again.
Bless Azia Kim. the new Messiah,
for showing us the truth. In the land
of the blind, the one-eyed woman is
queen. Like a goddess out of the
darkness before existence, she made
the world in her own image. Azia
Kim is a liar. Azia Kim is a child. Azia
Kim is America. She doesn't exist
anymore. She never existed. Her life
is over. She will live forever. She's the
greatest Stanford student I ever
knew, but she didn't go to Stanford,
and I never knew her.

Darren Franich wants to thank Azia
Kim for making liim love Stanford
again. Email him at dfranich@stan
