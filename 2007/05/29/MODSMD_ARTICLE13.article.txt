Azia Kim is the fairy godmother, the
boogeyman, the ace of spades, the
Grail Knight. A fearsome interloper,
infiltrating our Green Zone like a stealth
bomb sleeper cell. A confidence artist playing
on the unbelievable naivete of our danger
ously clueless populace. A rebel hero punc
turing through the fattened stratosphere of
our own entitlement. The tragic end product
of a generation of high school kids raised for
glory and doomed for a mid-life breakdown

missing the point. Would you beg for Teddy
Roosevelt's privacy, or Gandhi's, or Jesus's?
She belongs to history now. Books will be
written with her as a subject: psychological
texts, sociological screeds, tell-alls by the peo
ple who knew her, an autobiography mid
wited by the ghostwriter of O.J. Simpson's "If
I Did It."
A fictionalized version of her story could
make for frothy farce —an 80s'-style sex
comedy, where the fake student teaches all
the uptight squares what college is really all
