## Why we took over the President's office 
### THE SWEAT-FREE STANFORD COALITION 
Last Tuesday, the Stanford community
came together and took a stand for human
rights. We acted because we could not. in
good conscience, let another day go by in
which Stanford wascomplicit in the exploita
tion of workers around the world. We refused
to remain passive while the workers who
make our apparel earn poverty wages, face
sexual assault and work 18-hour days.
The sit-in was not an action we wanted to
take, but it was an action we had to take. After
three months of meetings with the adminis
tration. we had hit a wall. For over a month
now. President Hennessy has had all the in
formation he needs to act. We do not need

more meetings. We just need President Hen
nessy to do the right thing: to join the Worker
Rights Consortium (WRC) and the Desig
nated Suppliers Program (DSP) and to en
sure that Stanford apparel is sweatshop-free.
President I lennessv has told us that this is
a complex issue, and that it takes a long time
to make a decision. We know — we spent
well over 1(H) hours researching these pro
grams during fall quarter, making sure that
the programs we were proposing to the ad
ministration actually made a concrete im
provement in the lives of the workers who
make our apparel. We chose the WRC and
DSP because they improve factory condi
tions while allowing workers to keep their
jobs. The campaign has shared all of our re
search with President Hennessy. both in a

comprehensive report and in personal meet
ings. We agree that we must approach these
important issues with deliberation. I lowever,
we also know the difference between delib
eration and stalling.
We have done everything we can to show
I resident I lennessy that the Stanford com
munity cares deeply about this issue. Over
I .(KM) students, faculty,alumni and communi
ty members signed our petition; 21 student
groups endorsed our campaign; and both the
ndergraduate Senate and Graduate Stu
(>u,nc'' P ;,ss °d support resolutions for
the W R( and DSP. Peer institutions such as
( olumbia. ( ornell. Georgetown, Duke and
the entire I)( system have already signed
onto the WRC and DSP. Still,despite
having all the information he needs
and tremendous support from the
community here and abroad. Presi
dent 1 lennessy has failed to act. I lis
inaction over the past three months
ultimately forced us to take greater
action.
'ITiis institution teaches us to be
responsible, global citizens. Last
Tuesday, we owned up to that re
sponsibility, only to face arrest. We
were prepared for this outcome, but
we hoped to the very end that Pres
ident I lennessy would look inside of

himself and find the strength to
make the correct, moral decision.
We hoped that,rather than criminal
ize his own students, President Hen
nessy would criminalize the abuses
in sweatshops. Despite the actions
of the administration, we remain
committed and determined in our
struggle to uphold the integrity of
our beloved University. Students,
alumni and faculty, join us as we
continue to fight for a more fair and
just world. Now is the time to act —
to come together and improve the
lives of the workers who sew our
clothes.
