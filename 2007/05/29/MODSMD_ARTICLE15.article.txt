## Beyond sweatshops: Developing a strategy for a responsible approach 
### JOHN L. HENNESSY 
I drafted the first version of this
article on May 17,2006. While 1 have
made some revisions and explored
many alternative solutions since
then, the core content has not
changed. The decisions 1 propose
here are the ones I was prepared to
present to a group of student repre
sentatives in a meeting scheduled for
May 29,2007. Whether that group of
students simply lost patience with
the process or intuited a particular
outcome and decided to cut off dis
cussions, 1 do not know. The need for
a decision, however, is no less critical,
and it is time for the University to
move ahead with a plan.
1 apologize for the length of this
piece, but the issues are not simple
ones, and despite all the media cover
age. a number of facts are not well
understood, even by those who have
advocated one or another position.
Stanford's name is inextricably
linked with the pursuit of knowledge
and a commitment to using that
knowledge to improve the world. The
University exercises tremendous care
in how it allows its name to be used.
One of the most visible uses of Stan
ford's name is through its licensing
program. Stanford licenses its em
blems to companies that oversee the
production of all sorts of goods —
from T-shirts and hoodies to watches
and fine crystal. We want the manufac
ture of these products to be consistent
with the University's commitment to a
safe and fair working environment.
In this new era of global supply
chains, this poses a challenge since
Stanford is several steps removed
from the factories doing the manu
facturing, which are primarily locat
ed in developing countries. The fac
tories are owned not by the licensees
(such as Patagonia or Nike) but by
local companies. The degree of over
sight and enforcement of local labor
laws in these countries is often mini
mal, meaning that factory conditions
are difficult to monitor and solutions
not easy to enforce. Ironically,sweat
shop conditions are created primari
ly by a local employer abusing the
rights of fellow citizens.
In the long term, the solution to
these situations is better local en

forcement of labor standards, which
in most countries prohibit child
labor, unlimited forced overtime and
similar abuses. Better enforcement
and working conditions will come
about naturally as economic growth
improves quality of life for individu
als in the developing world, as well as
the ability of governments to enforce
their laws. Efforts by multinational
companies to enforce such standards
in thousands of factories halfway
around the world will always be chal
lenging and raise larger questions.
Indeed, some people have even ob
jected that such attempts by institu
tions in the developed world to im
pose rules and cultural assumptions
on the developing world constitute a
sort of new-age colonialism.
Despite these challenges, I believe
that if Stanford is to allow its name to
be associated with a variety of such
merchandise, we should do our best to
ensure that the manufacturers of these
products treat their workers fairly, with
dignity and in accordance with the local
laws that protect employees. Stanford
is prepared to take steps to meet this
challenge. For several months. I have
been meeting with students on these
questions, and while we share common
broad goals, we also differ on how to
best achieve those goals.
We all agree, for instance, that
Stanford must spell out its Code of
Conduct for its licensing activities. 1
have asked that such a statement of
principles be drafted by the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility
and Licensing, which has faculty, stu
dent, staff and alumni representation.
We also agree that such a code
needs to be backed up by steps that
can help ensure that the code is fol
lowed. Stanford is ready to support
organizations and other mechanisms
to monitor compliance and enforce
these principles. Stanford will join
two different organizations — the
Worker Rights Consortium (WRC)

and the Fair Labor Association
(FLA) — each of which has marked
ly different approaches to improving
workers' conditions overseas.
The WRC includes representa
tion from universities,students.inter
national labor rights experts and the
labor movement, and conducts in
vestigations based on complaints
from workers. 11 the complaints are
verified, the WRC works with
schools, licensees and local organiza
tions to correct the problem. The
FLA is weighted toward representa
tion from licensors (such as Stan
ford), licensees (such as Patagonia)
and other manufacturers, and uses
both on-site inspections and investi
gation of complaints to ensure com
pliance. The FLA has generally man
aged to perform far more inspections
and thus cover more workers, but the
existence of the WRC creates an ad
ditional mechanism for monitoring.
While certain Stanford students
have recommended that the Univer
sity join only the WRC. we do not be
lieve that the best long-term policy is
necessarily to pick exclusively the
FLA or the WRC: each has advan
tages. 1 believe the greatest improve
ment in workers' conditions will
occur if the WRC and the FLA can be
persuaded to join forces and re
sources. Together, they have greater
potential to develop more effective
programs. I hope that Stanford will
be able to influence this strategic di
rection as a member of both organi
zations. (It is useful to note that al
though Stanford has not belonged to
these organizations, its licensees all
belong to the FLA, so the Stanford
branded apparel is as "sweat-free" as
the apparel at any other university.)
In examining these two organiza
tions, we made a detailed review of
their achievements of the last few
years. While both groups have made
some progress, it has been limited in
scope primarily to single factories on
which the FLA and WRC have
shined their spotlights. Each group is
now seeking a broader remedy, pro
posing more extensive programs to
institute stronger safeguards for
workers, but it remains to be seen
how effective either will be.
The FLA has recently rolled out a
pilot program in China that aims to
provide factories with the incentives,
capabilities and plans to develop sus
tainable compliance with its Code of
Conduct requirements.The FLA and
its members will monitor these re
sults and terminate licenses with any
licensees that continue to source
from factories that do not comply
after a reasonable remediation effort
has been made. Stanford will be as
sessing the success of this program in
the coming months.
The WRC supports the Designat
ed Suppliers Program (DSP), which
limits production of university-li
censed goods to a small number of
factories, each of whose output must
be at least half university-branded
merchandise. By concentrating pro
duction in a small number of certi
fied factories with certain economic
safeguards in place for the factory
owners, the supporters of the DSP
believe that the probability of unfair
or unethical working conditions
would drop, at least al DSP factories.
Certain Stanford students have
asked that we not only join the WRC
but that we also endorse the Desig

nated Suppliers Program.
There are, however, numerous
problems with the DSP. First, it is un
likely to he effective for a number of
years, if it succeeds at all. To under
stand why, you need to know that a
small number of universities (less
than 20) dominate the marketplace
for athletic wear. Stanford is a very
small player with much less than 1%
of the university-branded apparel
market. Unless the vast majority of
the large public institutions embrace
the DSP, it cannot be successful. So
far, none of the top 10 licensing uni
versities are among the small num
ber of colleges and universities that
have signed onto the DSP.
More importantly, if the DSP were
truly successful, it could actually result
in more harm than good for apparel
workers. How can this be? Because
the entire collegiate-branded market
is only 5% of the athletic apparel mar
ket, the requirement that at least half a
DSP's factory consist of collegiate
branded apparel means that at most
10% of the factories will be manufac
turing such apparel. Although the
monitoring of those factories would
be better than it is today, 90% of the
athletic apparel factories would not be
monitored by colleges and universi
ties! This would result in a likely de
crease in protections for the vast ma
jority of athletic apparel workers.
Although an outcome that im
proves only the manufacturing of
collegiate-branded apparel might
make a few purchasers feel better
about proclaiming themselves
"sweat-free," 1 find it hypocritical
and morally objectionable to em
brace a solution that is likely to de
crease the protection of a much larg
er number of workers.
We need a better solution. It is
possible that the DSP will evolve
into a better solution, and we will
continue to monitor its progress. In
parallel, we have been exploring al
ternatives. One attractive possibility
is to develop a method to essentially
guarantee compliance with our new
Code of Conduct by licensees will
ing to demonstrate such a commit
ment. Athletic apparel that was
manufactured by such licensees
could receive a designation, such as
"GSW: Guaranteed Sweat-free." It
is possible that not all our licensees
could meet this higher standard, re
sulting in fewer products bearing the
Stanford name. If such a designation
generated significant consumer in
terest. however, there would likely
be more demand and growing avail
ability. We are beginning to explore
the possibility of identifying a core
group of licensees who will be able
to meet our rigorous requirements.
If our idea is feasible, implementa
tion will not be easy or quick, but if
successful, we will be able to ensure
that Stanford-branded merchandise
is manufactured under the highest
standards without compromising
the welfare of other workers.
I wish there were a simple solu
tion that did not have any disadvan
tages. There is not. Our commitment
should be to work together to find
new ways to ensure that Stanford
continues to act as a force for good
throughout the world.
