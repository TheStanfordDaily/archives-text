WOMEN'S GOLF

It had been the best-kept secret in all of
collegiate golf— the No. 14 Stanford
women's golf team can compete, and win.
against the best programs in the nation. Now,
after a fifth-place showing at the NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal women have let
the secret out of the bag.
At the par-72.6,351-yard Legends Course
in Daytona Beach, Fla., Stanford (299-300-
304-294 —1197) caught many teams off
guard with its first top-five finish at the cham
pionships since a runner-up showing in 2000.
According to senior Lauren Todd, this was ex
actly what the women had intended to do.
"We surprised a lot of people out there, but
we didn't surprise ourselves.'Todd said."lt's a
good place to be in. under people's radar."
After four rounds of grueling competition,
the ('ardinal barely finished in sole possession
of tilth place. In fact, Stanford's six-over-par
294 on the final day of play (its best team
round in the tourney) was just enough for the
women to hold on to the fifth spot, as Vander
bilt came in only three strokes behind for
sixth overall.
In the individual standings,Todd appropri
ately ended her successful Stanford career
with a top-10 finish. Her four-round tally of
296 (70-74-76-76) put her in a tie for ninth
place — the best showing of her career at
NCAAs. Fellow senior Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana (77-72-77-75 — 301) also capped
off her collegiate career with a respectable tie
for 26th place.
Looking back on her final year. Todd was
enthused by the thrill of coming up big at the
right time.
"It's incredible — all four years, we keep
doing the same thing, hoping for good re
sults." she said."lt's nice to come through sen
ior year and for it to work out."
Placing in between Todd and Tangtiphai
boontana was sophomore phenom Mari
Chun (76-78-71-74 — 299), who tied for 17th
individually. Rounding out Stanford's team
were freshmen Angela King (80-77-80-71 —
308) and Catherina Wang (76-77-86-74 —
313), who finished 60th and 81st, respectively,
in their first NCAA appearances.
With four seniors graduating and no jun
iors on the roster. Stanford appears headed
for a youth movement in the upcoming years.
I lowever.Todd does not anticipate any prob
lems in the changing of the guard.
"Mari had a great year — she's just a solid
player and she'll step up next year.'Todd said.
"Angela and Catherina also showed streaks
ol brilliance with their final rounds of golf.
After playing with them, those three are just
as good a one-three punch as you could hope
for."
