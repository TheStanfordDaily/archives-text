# Solo runs fall short for Card
## Burdette reaches quarterfinals in singles and doubles 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's tennis saw strong runs
from freshman Lindsay Burdette, senior
Theresa Logar and junior Celia Durkin at
the NCAA Individual Championships this
past weekend, but all three ultimately came
up short of the tournament title as the Car
dinal wrapped up its season in Athens. Ga.
Logar and Durkin both reached the
Round of 16 before losing to Natalie Fra
zier of Georgia and Audra Cohen of Miami
(Ma.), respectively.
Logar, playing in what proved to be her
last collegiate match, fell to Frazier in a
hard-fought 6-0,5-7,7-6 loss on Friday. As
sistant coach Frankie Brennan was still
proud of the senior's performance, though.
"Theresa had a really tough match the
day before she played Natalie Frazier," he
said. "She had to deal with a lot of adversi
ty. I still feel that she's one of the top four or
five players in the country."
But it was Burdette who ended up
