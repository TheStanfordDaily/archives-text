### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's tennis saw strong runs
from freshman Lindsay Burdette, senior
Theresa Logar and junior Celia Durkin at
the NCAA Individual Championships this
past weekend, but all three ultimately came
up short of the tournament title as the Car
dinal wrapped up its season in Athens. Ga.
Logar and Durkin both reached the
Round of 16 before losing to Natalie Fra
zier of Georgia and Audra Cohen of Miami
(Ma.), respectively.
Logar, playing in what proved to be her
last collegiate match, fell to Frazier in a
hard-fought 6-0,5-7,7-6 loss on Friday. As
sistant coach Frankie Brennan was still
proud of the senior's performance, though.
"Theresa had a really tough match the
day before she played Natalie Frazier," he
said. "She had to deal with a lot of adversi
ty. I still feel that she's one of the top four or
five players in the country."
But it was Burdette who ended up

"I thought she played absolutely

Burdette and Yelsey fell in the
quarterfinals to Clemson's Ani Mi

Aside from Burdette's perform
ance. the second biggest story for
Stanford was I.ogar and Yelsey, who
as senior co-captains competed in
their final collegiate matches during
last week's NCAA Championships.
Although neither had outstanding
tournament performances in com
parison to their NCAA performanc
es in the past,(l .ogar advanced to the
singles Round of 16 this year, while
Yelsey advanced to the Round of 32
in singles and the quarterfinals in
doubles), the tournament was a final
chance for the two to showcase their
illustrious college careers.
" Ihey went out there and they
fought hard." Brennan said. "I think
that so much was taken out of them
with the team championship loss [to
UCLA in the semifinals]."
I.ogar and Yelsey leave behind a
strong legacy at Stanford, where they
both won three team national titles in
their careers and helped the Cardinal
win K ( ) straight matches to start their
careers.

Brennan and head coach Lele
1 brood will have to do their best in
replacing the two seniors who have
been cornerstones of the program for
the last four years.
"It's going to be really tough to re
place them," Brennan said. "Anne
was just a great competitor and a
leader for our team. Theresa was so
fiery and had tons of energy and
brought a lightness to the team, keep
ing them loose with her jokes and her
personality. It's going to be impossi
ble to replace them."
Stanford finishes its season with a
24-2 record. But unlike many previ
ous years, in which the Cardinal dom
inated on its way to a national title,
this year's season was filled with ad
versity from injury, illness and, ulti
mately, depth issues. Still, the team's
season had many a thrilling moment,
despite the squad's loss in the semifi
nals of the NCAA Team Champi
onships.
Stanford now looks forward to the

Theresa Logar and junior Celia Durkin at
the NCAA Individual Championships this
past weekend, but all three ultimately came
up short of the tournament title as the Car
dinal wrapped up its season in Athens. Ga.
Logar and Durkin both reached the
Round of 16 before losing to Natalie Fra
zier of Georgia and Audra Cohen of Miami
(Ma.), respectively.
Logar, playing in what proved to be her
last collegiate match, fell to Frazier in a
hard-fought 6-0,5-7,7-6 loss on Friday. As
sistant coach Frankie Brennan was still
proud of the senior's performance, though.
"Theresa had a really tough match the
day before she played Natalie Frazier," he
said. "She had to deal with a lot of adversi
ty. I still feel that she's one of the top four or
five players in the country."
But it was Burdette who ended up

singles tournament while also reach

competition with senior co-captain
Anne Yelsey.
"I thought she played absolutely
outstanding," Brennan said of Bur

great year as a freshman."
Burdette and Yelsey fell in the
quarterfinals to Clemson's Ani Mi

Amassing impressive victories
against last year's defending cham

Burdette and Yelsey had already de

of both the singles and doubles tour
naments, Burdette's ranking will be
in good standing when next year's
season begins in the fall.
"[Her performance here] solidi
ties her as one of the best players in
the country, even as a freshman,"
Hrcnnan said. "It will also help her
hold a top ranking for the rest of the
career — it's going to help her whole
career."
Aside from Burdette's perform
ance. the second biggest story for
Stanford was I.ogar and Yelsey, who
as senior co-captains competed in
their final collegiate matches during
last week's NCAA Championships.
Although neither had outstanding
tournament performances in com
parison to their NCAA performanc
es in the past,(l .ogar advanced to the
singles Round of 16 this year, while
Yelsey advanced to the Round of 32
in singles and the quarterfinals in
doubles), the tournament was a final
chance for the two to showcase their
illustrious college careers.
" Ihey went out there and they
fought hard." Brennan said. "I think
that so much was taken out of them
with the team championship loss [to
UCLA in the semifinals]."
I.ogar and Yelsey leave behind a
strong legacy at Stanford, where they
both won three team national titles in
their careers and helped the Cardinal
win K ( ) straight matches to start their
careers.

Brennan and head coach Lele
1 brood will have to do their best in
replacing the two seniors who have
been cornerstones of the program for
the last four years.
"It's going to be really tough to re
place them," Brennan said. "Anne
was just a great competitor and a
leader for our team. Theresa was so
fiery and had tons of energy and
brought a lightness to the team, keep
ing them loose with her jokes and her
personality. It's going to be impossi
ble to replace them."
Stanford finishes its season with a
24-2 record. But unlike many previ
ous years, in which the Cardinal dom
inated on its way to a national title,
this year's season was filled with ad
versity from injury, illness and, ulti
mately, depth issues. Still, the team's
season had many a thrilling moment,
despite the squad's loss in the semifi
nals of the NCAA Team Champi
onships.
Stanford now looks forward to the
individual tournament season begin
ning in the fall. The team figures to
see changes throughout the lineup,
and the voids left by I.ogar and
Yelsey's departures will likely be
filled by the likes of Burdette,current
sophomore Jessica Nguyen and cur
rent juniors Durkin and Whitney
Deason.
