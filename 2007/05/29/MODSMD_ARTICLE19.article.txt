## 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
Every year dorms and houses around campus use
Memorial Day weekend to get oil campus and experi
ence life outside of the Stanford bubble. I louses ran
the gamut this year, taking oil to such exotic locales as
Santa Cruz, San Francisco and Shasta Lake.
A handtul of students Ironi Smnia Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) and Sigma Chi ventured to Shasta Lake, which
is located 200 miles north ol campus and is a popular
Memorial Day weekend destination tor college stu
dents from UC-Davis and Oregon State.
"Spending some time in the sun in a carefree atmos

phere on a beautiful lake offered a respite from the
daily grind," said SAE member George Watson 07. "It
was also a great opportunity to forge some final college
memories with some of my good friends in the house."
"It was awesome to get off campus for a while and
try something new" said Sigma C'hi member Donny
Vaughn '08. "There's not much going on on-campus
nowadays with finals coming up. so going to Shasta was
a great way to send the year off with a bang."
West Lagunita played "The Game" in San Francis
co, while Chi Theta Chi went to Northern California's
Russian River for its biannual canoeing trip.
"Canoe trip is a tradition at Chi Theta Chi that we
do every year," said House Manager Becca Pratt '08.

"It's a really amazing time for our house to get away
from the Stanford campus and canoe and have fun and
just enjoy nature."
"It is a spiritual voyage for a lot of people," added
Ben Graves 07. the other house manager.
Members of Theta Delta Chi also headed north this
weekend, taking a loosely organized stroll on the beach
— all the way to San Francisco.
"1 had already walked the beach twice," said Nick
Benavides '08. "i found it a good time to calm down
and reflect. It was a test of the will too, to see if you can
keep walking."
Benavides and five other house members left cam
pus at 6 a.m. Saturday morning in their attempt to walk

to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Other houses went south for the long weekend.
Both Roble and Narnia, among other dorms, took
trips to Santa Cruz. While Roble residents only went
for a day, about 15 Narnia residents used dorm funds to
spend Friday and Saturday night in the beach town.
"On Saturday we went to the boardwalk, the beach,
had a barbeque and just hung out," said Narnia Social
Manager Christine Vucolova '07. "It was a really fun,
chill trip. A lot of people went away and the people who
did go [were] the most social people of the house.
There was definitely high participation."
