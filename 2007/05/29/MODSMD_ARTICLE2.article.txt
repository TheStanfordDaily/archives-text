was Stanford student Azia Kim. But to her
comrades in Santa Clara University's Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) de

courses at Santa Clara, particularly wowing
her classmates with presentations on Dwight

Eisenhower, Robert E. Lee and military val

papers were good," Rice said. "ROTC is kind
