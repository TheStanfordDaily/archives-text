# Azia used Stanford to get ROTC spot
## Kim forged transcript, accepted $1,350 worth of military equipment and received dozens of hours of military training 
### DANIEL NOVINSON AMIT ARORA DESK EDITORS 
To her friends in Kimball and Okada, she
was Stanford student Azia Kim. But to her
comrades in Santa Clara University's Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) de
tachment, she was a Private Cadet affection
ately nicknamed AK.
Kim — the 18-year-old from Fullerton,
Calif, who was revealed by The Daily last
Thursday to have been squatting in Stanford
dorms since September despite not being affil
iated with the University — duped ROTC of
ficials into thinking she was an honor-roll Stan
ford student for eight months. She took classes
on Army tactics and history received military
equipment worth more than $1,000 and even
earned official military awards for her top
grades at Stanford.
"She was so good at not seeming like she
was lying," said Kim's ROTC advisor Diana
Clough '07, a newly-commissioned Army lieu
tenant who was sworn in by President George
W. Bush at the White House just two weeks
ago. "Any oddness of hers we just attached to
flaky freshmanness."
Captain Michael Regnier taught Kim. Ally
Ha '09 and Michael Rice '10 a weekly military
lab and a weekly class on topics ranging from
land navigation training to rifle marksmanship
to battle drills. Because of Stanford's ROTC
ban in the 19605, cadets must commute to
other Bay Area schools. Kim excelled in the
courses at Santa Clara, particularly wowing
her classmates with presentations on Dwight

Eisenhower, Robert E. Lee and military val
ues.
"Her presentations were well done and her
papers were good," Rice said. "ROTC is kind
of an easy class, but she re;illy tried hard. She
had a background display with a video, music

and pretty much everything on Eisen
hower. She did better in the class than
we did."
Although Kim actively participat
ed in the classes and labs during au
tumn quarter, she stopped attending
labs in the winter and stopped coming
to classes altogether in the spring.
"She didn't go to labs winter quar
ter," Cfough said. "She said she had
class — the irony of ironies."
Unlike most ROTC cadets, Kim
was never officially contracted. She
never committed to four years of mili
tary service after graduation in ex
change for a four-year scholarship to
Stanford, perhaps because doing so
would have required her to provide
the Army with an enrollment verifica
tion form and an official transcript.
"She always said that she didn't
want to contract with ROTC because
her parents didn't want her to."
Clough said. "Looking back that
would require RO TC to interface with
Stanford, so it would have been im
possible for her to contract."
Nonetheless, monetary concerns
might have motivated Kim to join
RO TC. Cadets said Kim may have af
filiated herself with the program in
order to explain the lack of a tuition
bill to her parents.
"My theory is that she was trying to
say she was in the ROTC so her par
ents would believe that she was never
getting her tuition hills." Rice said.

Above is a scanned copy of the note placed on the door of Room 108 in
Okada last week, where Azia Kim had been posing as a resident. The note
says that the police will be called if Kim is seen trying to enter the room.

Clough speculated that Kim may
have also joined R()TC out of loneli
ness.
"A big part of the freshman experi
ence is meeting all the people through
the dorm." Clough said. "I'm sure she
couldn't because she had to keep her
secret, so she was probably lonely.
Maybe another reason for doing ex
tracurriculars is so you can meet peo
ple without exposing your secret."
But while Kim's motives for join
ing ROTC are uncertain, one thing is
for sure: She received a lot of military
gear. All told. Kim received 22 items
— from a bulletproof Kevlar helmet
($200) to military-grade boots ($80) to
a full Class A uniform, complete with
sports jacket, pants and cap ($250).
Clough estimated the value of the

items given to Kim somewhere
around $1,350 (see chart).
Kim left that equipment in the
Kimball dorm's lounge until it was re
covered on Thursday, when Rice
learned about Kim's ruseinThe Daily.
At that time, he emailed her to ask for
the equipment hack. In a terse, one
line reply, Kim told him that she had
placed the duffel bag of equipment in
the corner of the dorm lounge.
"That's kind of scary because there
are a few pieces of really expensive
equipment," Rice said, "\ laving that
stuff out in the open with lots of small
stuff really easy to take is pretty dan
gerous."
Police confiscated the equipment
and have since returned it to the
Army.
Lt. Col. Shari L. Corbett. the com
mander of Santa Clara's ROTC de
tachment. declined to comment for
this story.
As a first-year cadet. Kim needed
to show academic progress to
Clough and to the ROTC. Twice a
quarter, she submitted forms to
Clough detailing the courses she was
taking, her grades and her perform
ance on key papers and tests. Kim
showed A's in Math 42 and Math 51
in addition to A-'s in Econ 1A and
Chem 31 A. She did report a B in
Chem 33. but displayed an A in Eng
lish and Fiction, an introductory sem
inar (see chart).
Kim forged an unofficial transcript
that matched these forms, a move that
fooled ROTC officials. In fact, her
grades were so good that Kim re
ceived the Dean's Award, a purple and
yellow ribbon for her uniform given to
cadets with a grade point average of at
least 3.5.
"We thought she was a little odd, if
anything, because she studied so
much,' Clough said. "A lot of people
talk about random things.'Blah, blah,
blah. Big Game, blah, blah, blah, this
social event.' but if she wasn't connect
ed to a dorm community. I guess there
was nothing to get her excited."
Her passion for studying notwith
standing. Kim struck most in the
ROTC as a normal, well-adjusted
freshman.
"I've mentored since I've been a
sophomore, and her responses
seemed like everyone else's," Clough
said. "She wasn't hyper social — 'I'm

Kim was so convincing in her role
that she never aroused suspicion
not even when her fellow cadets al
most unintentionally exposed her.
Clough and fellow cadet Kevin
Boldt '07 were driving new cadets to
Santa Clara last September when
Kim said that Stanford I lousing had
mistakenly assigned her to the
wrong dorm.
"Kevin Boldt said 'Wouldn't it be
funny if you went to I lousing and they
said that you weren't a Stanford stu
dent.'" Clough said. "She didn't even
flinch. That just shows her awesome
ness — that she was able to move
through that situation."
Ultimately, Clough defended
ROTC for not realizing that Kim was
an imposter.
"We actually have an excuse for
not knowing, unlike everyone else."
Clough said. "She was not a commit
ted member. She was just like one of
those guys try ing out on a sports team
before they make cuts."

Although Kim actively participat
ed in the classes and labs during au

labs in the winter and stopped coming
to classes altogether in the spring.
"She didn't go to labs winter quar

class — the irony of ironies."
Unlike most ROTC cadets, Kim
was never officially contracted. She
never committed to four years of mili
tary service after graduation in ex
change for a four-year scholarship to
Stanford, perhaps because doing so
would have required her to provide
the Army with an enrollment verifica
tion form and an official transcript.
"She always said that she didn't
want to contract with ROTC because
her parents didn't want her to."
Clough said. "Looking back that
would require RO TC to interface with
Stanford, so it would have been im
possible for her to contract."
Nonetheless, monetary concerns
might have motivated Kim to join
RO TC. Cadets said Kim may have af
filiated herself with the program in
order to explain the lack of a tuition
bill to her parents.
"My theory is that she was trying to
say she was in the ROTC so her par
ents would believe that she was never

Above is a scanned copy of the note placed on the door of Room 108 in
Okada last week, where Azia Kim had been posing as a resident. The note
says that the police will be called if Kim is seen trying to enter the room.

Clough speculated that Kim may
have also joined R()TC out of loneli
ness.
"A big part of the freshman experi
ence is meeting all the people through
the dorm." Clough said. "I'm sure she
couldn't because she had to keep her
secret, so she was probably lonely.
Maybe another reason for doing ex
tracurriculars is so you can meet peo
ple without exposing your secret."
But while Kim's motives for join
ing ROTC are uncertain, one thing is
for sure: She received a lot of military
gear. All told. Kim received 22 items
— from a bulletproof Kevlar helmet
($200) to military-grade boots ($80) to
a full Class A uniform, complete with
sports jacket, pants and cap ($250).
Clough estimated the value of the

items given to Kim somewhere
around $1,350 (see chart).
Kim left that equipment in the
Kimball dorm's lounge until it was re
covered on Thursday, when Rice
learned about Kim's ruseinThe Daily.
At that time, he emailed her to ask for
the equipment hack. In a terse, one
line reply, Kim told him that she had
placed the duffel bag of equipment in
the corner of the dorm lounge.
"That's kind of scary because there
are a few pieces of really expensive
equipment," Rice said, "\ laving that
stuff out in the open with lots of small
stuff really easy to take is pretty dan
gerous."
Police confiscated the equipment
and have since returned it to the
Army.
Lt. Col. Shari L. Corbett. the com
mander of Santa Clara's ROTC de
tachment. declined to comment for
this story.
As a first-year cadet. Kim needed
to show academic progress to
Clough and to the ROTC. Twice a
quarter, she submitted forms to
Clough detailing the courses she was
taking, her grades and her perform
ance on key papers and tests. Kim
showed A's in Math 42 and Math 51
in addition to A-'s in Econ 1A and
Chem 31 A. She did report a B in
Chem 33. but displayed an A in Eng
lish and Fiction, an introductory sem
inar (see chart).
Kim forged an unofficial transcript
that matched these forms, a move that
fooled ROTC officials. In fact, her
grades were so good that Kim re
ceived the Dean's Award, a purple and
yellow ribbon for her uniform given to
cadets with a grade point average of at
least 3.5.
"We thought she was a little odd, if
anything, because she studied so
much,' Clough said. "A lot of people
talk about random things.'Blah, blah,
blah. Big Game, blah, blah, blah, this
social event.' but if she wasn't connect
ed to a dorm community. I guess there
was nothing to get her excited."
Her passion for studying notwith
standing. Kim struck most in the
ROTC as a normal, well-adjusted
freshman.
"I've mentored since I've been a
sophomore, and her responses
seemed like everyone else's," Clough
said. "She wasn't hyper social — 'I'm

that she never aroused suspicion
not even when her fellow cadets al
most unintentionally exposed her.
Clough and fellow cadet Kevin
Boldt '07 were driving new cadets to
Santa Clara last September when
Kim said that Stanford I lousing had
mistakenly assigned her to the
wrong dorm.
"Kevin Boldt said 'Wouldn't it be
funny if you went to I lousing and they
said that you weren't a Stanford stu
dent.'" Clough said. "She didn't even
flinch. That just shows her awesome
ness — that she was able to move
through that situation."
Ultimately, Clough defended
ROTC for not realizing that Kim was
an imposter.
"We actually have an excuse for
not knowing, unlike everyone else."
Clough said. "She was not a commit
ted member. She was just like one of
those guys try ing out on a sports team
before they make cuts."
