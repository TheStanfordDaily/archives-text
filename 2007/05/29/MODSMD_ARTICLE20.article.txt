## Farmers outraged over dirt from Munger Community Farm suffers from building of graduate residence 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students will soon have a posh new
home in the Munger Graduate Residences.courtesy
of the largest gift ever earmarked for University
housing, but the building project comes with a price:
the loss of the Stanford Community Farm, a one
acre plot on West Campus where Stanford affiliates
grow everything from roses to tomatoes.
Due to building regulations that prohibit the
University from moving dirt from construction sites
off cam pus, dirt from the Munger project — located
behind Wilbur Hall and supported largely by a $43.5
million donation from Charles and Nancy Munger
*45 — has been deposited on land surrounding the
Community Farm, and this pile of dirt has created a
host of ecological problems for the farmers.
Money, aesthetics, political correctness and in
creasing pressure on the University to demonstrate

its commitment to environmental sustainability all
play a part in the drama.
The Physical Effects
Community farmers Steve Masley — a 23-year
employee of the Biology Copy Center and an organ
ic farmer for 20 years — and Michael Bachmann. a
research associate in the Department of Pediatrics,
expressed their frustration in interviews with Ihe
Daily.
I director of Environmental Planning Charles Carter
told I Tie Daily last fall that there were "no significant
stakeholders" in the area covered by the debris.
Masley noted that Carter ignored the Community
Farm in his comments.
"In the same interview." Masley said. "[Carter]
said that earth-moving activities haven't directly im
pacted the Farm. I le is wrong."
( arter did not respond to calls seeking comment.
The biggest problems from the dirt are an in
creasing squirrel population and the loss of benefi
cial insects. According to Masley, the most detrimen
tal effects of the dirt pile are "the topographical
changes caused by depositing all that construction
debris all around the farm."
C onsti uction debris has raised the grade around
the site, he said, creating an artificial basin, where

cold water and cold air collect,causing further prob
lems such as frozen pipes.
Bachmann said the physical effects are actually a
secondary concern.
"What matters more has been the psychosocial
effect," he said. "The farm community does not mat
ter to the University, even though the founding doc
ument states that instruction in Agriculture and all
its branches' should be maintained."
Lack of Communication
Masley said that communication with the Uni
versity at the project's onset was "non-existent."
1 le did admit, however, that "part of the fault lies
with the farm community, which has been very dis
organized in the past."
Masley noted that there has been a "slight im
provement" in communication with the University
since Dean of liarth Systems Pamela Matson joined
the project.The complaints of alumni farmers have
also forced the University to respond to the situa
tion.
Despite the farmers' concerns. Matson said the
farm's problems stem from several issues, only one
of which involves the Munger project.
