## Study: research excludes women, minorities those with other medial needs get forgotten 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Scientific research involving the
treatment of alcoholism has dispro
portionately neglected women and
African Americans, according to a
report published last Thursday.
In a journal article examining
clinical trials involving more than
100,000 patients, researchers claimed
that academic studies of alcoholism
may not reflect the reality that doc
tors must confront in clinics.
"Many of the people we see in
clinical settings — whether that's
substance abuse or alcohol treat
ment — are not being accurately
represented in the research litera

ture." said study co-author Kenneth
Weingardt, a researcher at the Palo
Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care
System.
According to Psychiatry Prof.
Keith Humphreys, the study's lead
author, volunteers who participate in
clinical trials must often meet a strin
gent set of guidelines.This can lead to
the exclusion of members of margin
alized groups that are sometimes
heavily affected by the disorder in
question.
I lumphreys said that patients are
often excluded from studies if they
do not have permanent housing or if
they have additional medical issues.
The fallout of the exclusions means
that many cancer patients are not el
igible for cancer studies, nor are
many patients with heart disorders
eligible for studies of heart disease,
he added.
"[Scientists] often want to ex
clude patients with any problem

other than the one they're studying,"
1 lumphreys said.
Scientists conducting clinical re
search trials must balance the "inter
nal validity" of an experiment with
its external application, explained
Weingardt. But according to
Humphreys, many would make a
greater effort to include marginal
ized groups if the problem were
more widely known.
"It's happened not because of
malice but because of lack of infor
mation." Humphreys said. "So part
of the work is doing this and promot
ing it."
The results of empirical studies
and conditions in clinics are often not
closely related in practice, both re
searchers explained.
"It takes about 17 years between
the time a particular procedure, de
vice or drug is demonstrated to be ef
fective and when it's adopted univer
sally across healthcare systems,"

Weingardt said.
I le added that reducing that time
frame is a major priority for both the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).
an institution that funds scientific re
search, and the Veterans Affairs
Health Care System, which actually
delivers patient care.
"For me. personally," Weingardt
said, "I've always been very passion
ate about getting the research into
the hands of the people who can use
it to improve care."
Humphreys agreed that reducing
the use of certain biased criteria in
forming samples for clinical trials is
important if science is to reflect real
ity.
"I don't want to study [a medical
disorder] in healthy 25-year-old peo
ple who jog and eat bran muffins," he
said.
