## Rankings bother college presidents 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
While a dozen college presi
dents from universities across the
country are boycotting U.S. News
& World Report in an attempt to
minimize the importance of the
magazine's popular annual col
lege rankings, Stanford has no in
tention of jumping on the hand
wagon, according to Director of
Admission Shawn Abbott.
Abbott also insisted that, un
like other schools, Stanford has
never allowed the rankings to dic
tate University policies.
"During my short tenure at
Stanford, no one — and 1 repeat,
no one — has even remotely sug
gested or insinuated that the
agenda of the Stanford Office of
Undergraduate Admission
should be directed or influenced
by any ranking, much less U.S.
News & World Report," Abbott
said in an email to The Daily.
Each year, the magazine re
leases lists that rank the nation's
top colleges and universities
based on factors ranging from
graduation and retention rate to
student to faculty ratio and stu
dent demographics. Stanford was
No. 4 on this year's list, tied with
the California Institute of Tech
nology and MIT and behind
Princeton. Harvard and Yale.
Earlier this month, presidents
from a collection of schools
across the country, including
Lafayette and Dickinson Col
leges, banded together to chal
lenge the validity of these lists.
While Stanford does not plan
on joining this consortium of
schools, the University was on the
forefront of a 19% movement to
challenge the U.S. News rankings.
Then President Gerhard Casper
sent a letter to the magazine and
established a Web site to provide
students with information about
the ranking after the University

slipped double-digit spots from
the 1995 rankings to the 19% list.
"Were U.S. News to walk away
from these misleading rankings.it
would be a powerful display of
common sense," Casper said in
the 1996 letter. "I fear, however,
that these rankings and their
byproducts have become too at
tention-catching for that to hap
pen."
Casper's words may have
more resonance today, as the
magazine's annual rankings in
creasingly affect high school sen
iors in their college search.
There's no question that U.S.
News & World Report has in
creasingly cornered the market
on college rankings." Abbott said.
"1 low much influence those rank
ings have is debatable. Our hope
is that while prospective students
might utilize the rankings as a
starting point in investigating col
leges. they should rely on actual
primary research to ultimately se
lect their college of choice.To pick
a college based on its chart-place
ment in a news weekly is pretty
reckless."
Abbott recommended that
prospective students survey a
wide range of resources, including
other ranking lists, which may
take into account statistics that
the U.S. News lists omit.
It's fine to use rankings like
U.S. News & World Report as a
starting point to investigate basic
demographic information about
colleges, as long as it's not the pri
mary instrument used to make
one's ultimate selection," Abbott
said. "U.S. News & World Report
isn't the root of all evil, but only
the woefully misinformed think
that their rankings are handed
down by God. Stanford was Stan
ford long before U.S. News &
World Report."
