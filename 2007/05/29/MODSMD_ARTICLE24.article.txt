### RACHEL KONRAD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Facebook Inc. is encouraging other com
panies to sell products and create software
for use on the popular social networking
site, hoping to expand into an all-purpose
destination on the Web.
Hie company's 23-year-old founder and
chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said
Thursday the move was similar to what Mi
crosoft Corp. did decades ago. when the rel
atively obscure software maker began en
couraging third-party companies to write
programs for its personal computer operat
ing system. ITie strategy made Microsoft
phenomenally profitable and helped turn
founder Bill Gates — like Zuckerberg, a
I larvard University dropout — into world's
richest man.
"Until now. social networks have been
closed platforms," Zuckerberg told about
750 programmers attending the company's
first developer conference, dubbed fB.
"We're going to end that."
The Palo Alto-based startup has so far re
cruited about 65 companies to create soft

ware for the Facebook Platform, which will
he opened up to any company starting
Thursday night.
The best known third-party contributor
so far is e-commerce powerhouse
Amazon.com Inc., which is allowing Face
book members to publish book reviews on
their profile pages. llie feature will debut
later this week.
Zuckerberg and his Harvard buddy,
Dustin Moskovitz, co-founded Facebook in
February 2004. The site was supposed to be
the virtual version of paper "face books"
that Harvard and other colleges distribute
to freshmen.
But within a month, the site had caught on
at Stanford, Columbia, and Yale. By Decem
ber 2(K)4. it had nearly 1 million active users.
After the site opened up registration to
non-college students last September, it
evolved into a major social networking des
tination to rival MySpace.com. owned by
Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate
News Corp.
Facebook now has more than 24 million
users who have logged on in the past 30 days.
Venture capital firms including Accel Part
ners have contributed more than $35 mil
lion.

Zuckerberg and the company's
