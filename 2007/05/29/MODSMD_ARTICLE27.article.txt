## Bush to announce new Sudan sanctions U.S. govt, will punish African nation for "genocide" in Darfur 
### DEB RIECHMANN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — President Bush hopes new
I J.S. economic sanctions will force the hardline Su
danese government to quit blocking international
efforts to end the bloodshed in Darfur.
Bush threatened to impose the new U.S. sanc
tions in a speech last month. But he decided to
hold off to give the U.N. secretary-general more
time to find a diplomatic end to the four-year cri
sis in Darfur where more than 200.000 people have
been killed.
Beyond the U.S. sanctions Bush was to an
nounce Tuesday at the White House, the president
also will direct Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice to draft a proposed U.N. resolution to
strengthen international pressure on the Sudanese
government of President Omar al-Bashir, accord
ing to two administration officials who briefed re
porters Monday night.
Bush says al-Bashir's actions over the past few
weeks "follow a long pattern of promising cooper
ation while finding new methods of obstruction,"

according to a draft of the remarks.
The sanctions will prohibit more companies in
Sudan from using the U.S. financial system, stiffen
enforcement of existing sanctions and target indi
viduals suspected of fomenting violence, accord
ing to the officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity so as not to pre-empt the president's
remarks.
The bloody conflict — which the Bush admin
istration has labeled genocide — began when
rebels from ethnic African tribes rose up against
the Arab-led central government. The Sudanese
government is accused of responding by unleash
ing the janjaweed militias of Arab nomads, blamed
for indiscriminate killing. The government denies
the charges.
Al-Bashir agreed in November to a three-phase
U.N. plan to strengthen the overstretched, 7,000-
strong African Union force in Darfur.
After five months of stalling, the Sudanese pres
ident gave the go-ahead in April for the second
phase — a "heavy support package" with 3,000
U.N. troops, police and civilian personnel along
with six attack helicopters and other equipment.
Over the weekend, however, al-Bashir reiterat
ed his opposition to the deployment of a 22,000-
strong joint U.N.-AU force, saying he would only
allow a larger African force with technical and lo
gistical support from the United Nations.

Bush said the Sudanese government must stop
opposing the joint U.N.-AU force, quit supporting
violent militias and let humanitarian aid reach the
people of Darfur.
The new sanctions target 31 companies to be
barred from the U.S. banking system.Thirty of the
companies are controlled by the government of
Sudan; the other one is suspected of shipping arms
to Darfur, the officials said.
Nearly 10 years ago. the United States cut off
about 130 Sudanese companies from the U.S. system
over a different dispute, forcing them to find ways to
do business outside the sanctions framework.
The U.S. also is targeting three individuals.cut
ting them off from the U.S. financial system to pre
vent them, too, from doing business with U.S. com
panies or individuals.Two of the Sudanese individ
uals have alleged links to the janjaweed militias.
The third is a senior rebel leader suspected of
contributing to bloodshed and human rights viola
tions in Darfur.
The U.N. resolution Bush is seeking would
apply new international sanctions against the Su
danese government in Khartoum. It also would
seek to impose an expanded embargo on arms
sales to Sudan, prohibit Sudan's government from
conducting offensive military flights over Darfur
and strengthen the U.S. ability to monitor and re
port any violations.
