# STUDENT LIFE
## Hurricane Katrina project vandalized Negative comments found on student's work 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
When Sarah Woodward '09 invit
ed students to write on her Hurri
cane Katrina art installation near
Green Library, she did not expect
participants to sabotage her exhibit
by using profanity and slamming
Stanford Housing.
The art piece, which has been on
display for about a week, was vandal
ized Saturday night sometime after
11 p.m.
"Stanford Housing is crap," "kill
the tree" and "fuck Stanfurd" [sic]
were some of the vandals' comments.
I 'sing the black Sharpie pen provid
ed by Woodward for viewers who
wanted to write thoughts or reflec

tions about Katrina, the vandalizers
also drew inappropriate pictures of
genitalia on the artwork itself, rather
than on the backs of the art panels,
where Woodward had requested that
participants write.
"When I decided to put my art
work outside I knew that because
more people would have access
there were greater risks involved â€”
including vandalism," Woodward
said."Considering this was supposed
to be a dedication to raising aware
ness of a hard social issue, for some
one to write all over it and disrespect
it is really appalling."
"It's also a really wimpy 'fuck the
man' message," she added. "If you're
really interested in opposing Stan
ford Housing, writing on a piece of
artwork dedicated to Katrina and
natural disasters is a really stupid
way of fighting the system."
