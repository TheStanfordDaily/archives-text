## Hurricane Katrina project vandalized Negative comments found on student's work 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
When Sarah Woodward '09 invit
ed students to write on her Hurri
cane Katrina art installation near
Green Library, she did not expect
participants to sabotage her exhibit
by using profanity and slamming
Stanford Housing.
The art piece, which has been on
display for about a week, was vandal
ized Saturday night sometime after
11 p.m.
"Stanford Housing is crap," "kill
the tree" and "fuck Stanfurd" [sic]
were some of the vandals' comments.
I 'sing the black Sharpie pen provid
ed by Woodward for viewers who
wanted to write thoughts or reflec

tions about Katrina, the vandalizers
also drew inappropriate pictures of
genitalia on the artwork itself, rather
than on the backs of the art panels,
where Woodward had requested that
participants write.
"When I decided to put my art
work outside I knew that because
more people would have access
there were greater risks involved —
including vandalism," Woodward
said."Considering this was supposed
to be a dedication to raising aware
ness of a hard social issue, for some
one to write all over it and disrespect
it is really appalling."
"It's also a really wimpy 'fuck the
man' message," she added. "If you're
really interested in opposing Stan
ford Housing, writing on a piece of
artwork dedicated to Katrina and
natural disasters is a really stupid
way of fighting the system."

An act of vandalism adorns Sarah Woodward's Hurricane Katrina art
installation outside of Green Library. Various inappropriate comments were
found on the project, which has displayed for a week, this weekend.
Woodward said she was particu
larly offended that a poem that had
been posted before the vandalism
occurred was scrawled over in black
marker.
"I think that this represents the
only public attempt by Stanford to
acknowledge in art the dimension of
the Katrina tragedy," said Program
in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) Lec
turer Scott Herndon, Woodward's
advisor for the project. "For it to be
vandalized like this is just — I guess
the best word for this is sad."
"In a wider sense," Herndon

added, "the way that the artwork is
being treated as a symbol for Stan
ford really represents a failure in our
culture to recognize what artwork
like this is trying to accomplish."
Students from the New Orleans
area also expressed their frustration
about the vandalism.
"If [onlyJ the people who did it
even knew how much pain that rep
resents" said Slidell. La. resident
Kate Lowry '10. who was originally
excited to see the University endors
ing a project that would draw atten
tion to the disaster. "1 think [the van
dalism is] horribly disrespectful. It's
not even related to Katrina at all."
"It's just immature," said New
Orleans resident Manus McCaffery
'10. "To me it was another one of
those signs — people forgetting that

it's something that affects [Gulf
Coast] residents every single day. It's
almost been two years but I know
that my family [is] still living in a
trailer in front of our house."
While the vandals have yet to be
identified, students speculate that
the perpetrators may not be affiliat
ed with the University.
Woodward said she will salvage
what she can of the exhibit, but
added that some of the newspaper
clippings and pictures cannot be
fixed. She said she hopes viewers will
continue to share their stories and
write meaningful reflections that are
appropriate and connected to the
purpose of her artwork.
