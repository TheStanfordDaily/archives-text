The University plans to inform Elizabeth
Okazaki.the apparent imposter who has sporad
ically lived in the Varian Physics Lab for four
years, that she is no longer welcome on Stanford's
campus.

After The Daily first reported the story on Fri
day, officials drafted a letter informing the
woman that she has been barred from campus
while the police conduct an investigation. Ac
cording to University spokesperson Kate ('lies
ley, Department of Public Safety officials were
still trying to find her last night so they could hand
deliver the letter.
Since 2003, Okazaki has made herself at home
in the physics building. She attended graduate
physics seminars and used the offices reserved for
doctoral and post-doctoral physics students.
Lab building manager Stewart Kramer con

firmed that Okazaki worked as a temporary em
ployee in the physics department's administra
tive offices for a few months in 2004. But he said
she has not had any affiliation with the depart
ment since.
In an exclusive interview with The Daily.
Kramer described how staffers in his office asked
Okazaki to leave the building after it had closed
for the night on several instances, but they never
took legal action.
"We've asked her several times to stay away,"
