# IMPOSTER II
## Physics lab squatter banned from campus Students remember Okazaki's feigned boyfriends in dept. 
### AMIT ARORA DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITORS 
The University plans to inform Elizabeth
Okazaki.the apparent imposter who has sporad
ically lived in the Varian Physics Lab for four
years, that she is no longer welcome on Stanford's
campus.

After The Daily first reported the story on Fri
day, officials drafted a letter informing the
woman that she has been barred from campus
while the police conduct an investigation. Ac
cording to University spokesperson Kate ('lies
ley, Department of Public Safety officials were
still trying to find her last night so they could hand
deliver the letter.
Since 2003, Okazaki has made herself at home
in the physics building. She attended graduate
physics seminars and used the offices reserved for
doctoral and post-doctoral physics students.
Lab building manager Stewart Kramer con

firmed that Okazaki worked as a temporary em
ployee in the physics department's administra
tive offices for a few months in 2004. But he said
she has not had any affiliation with the depart
ment since.
In an exclusive interview with The Daily.
Kramer described how staffers in his office asked
Okazaki to leave the building after it had closed
for the night on several instances, but they never
took legal action.
"We've asked her several times to stay away,"
he said. "Each time, she claims that
she doesn't sleep in the building. We
hired public safety at tine time and
they did. in fact, find her there and
then kicked her out."
According to a number of doctor
al and post-doctoral students inter
viewed by The Daily since Friday,
Okazaki repeatedly claimed to be in
relationships with various physics
graduate students during her time in
Varian.
"She made comments to other
people suggesting that we had been
dating when we most certainly had
not." said Lukasz Fidkowski. a doc
toral student in physics."l met her at
some point when she was hanging
out at the physics department and 1
quickly got the impression that she
wasn't all there. 1 tried to be nice to
her but at the same time I didn't want
to have much to do with her."
When approached by The Daily
last Thursday, Okazaki said she
would not comment for any story
about her. At the time, she would not

speak about her lack of affiliation
with the University. Okazaki could
not be reached over the long week
end. A previous phone number had
been disconnected, and she was not
seen around Varian.
More than a half dozen doctoral
physics students and post-doctoral
scholars described what several
called Okazaki's "annoying" behav
ior. They said she tried to participate
in their conversations on advanced
physics concepts although her back
ground in physics was obviously lim
ited. 'ITiey also told The Daily that
when it became apparent she was
not a research scholar, she tried to
justify her presence in the lab by sug
gesting she was in a relationship with
a doctoral student.
"She'd try to make it seem like
she was attached, whether through
research or romantically." Fidkowski
said. "I think everyone just assumed
she was crazy."
While almost all of the physics
students who spoke with Hie Daily
echoed similar sentiments, Kramer
described her as "manipulative" and
"good at convincing people to give
her the legitimacy that she needs."
"1 think she's a little socially dys
functional." he said. "1 think she has

a moral problem and not a mental
one."
Kramer added that on one in
stance, public safety officers found
Okazaki in possession of an unau
thorized card key to the building.
"We know that she had a card key
in the winter of 200b for the building
that had been issued to a visiting
scholar in the physics department,"
he said. ** I assume she convinced that
person to give her the card when he
left."
While many have speculated that
Okazaki is homeless, one undergrad
uate student, who was granted
anonymity by The Daily, said he
rented a room from Okazaki in an
off-campus house during the sum
mer of 2003. Over the course of that
summer, the student described being
puzzled by Okazaki's odd behavior.
"She said that she wanted to date
physics students," he said, "because
they could fix the washing machine
when it broke."
The student said that Okazaki —
who told him that she was a graduate
student in the film studies depart
ment — would describe having mul
tiple relationships with physics stu
dents but that it appeared to him that
"none of these students thought they

were in a relationship with her."
A handful of the students ex
pressed hope that Okazaki would re
ceive counseling. Kramer said he did
not consider providing Okazaki with
counseling one of his job responsibil
ities.
"1 don't think the University is in
the business of providing help to
homeless people." he said. "I would
sincerely love for all the homeless
people in California to be given the
help they need. But that doesn't
seem to be the priority in our socie
ty."
Ultimately, building manager
Kramer suggested that Okazaki like
ly was looking for somebody in the
physics department to provide for
lier.
"1 think she takes the easy way
out." he said. "I think she wants to be
a housewife. I think she doesn't want
to work for a living. I think she wants
a sugar daddy. If she can latch onto
some grad student who's going to be
come a professor at some university,
then 1 think she thinks that the pro
fessor's wife would be just the
lifestyle for her."

her the legitimacy that she needs."
"1 think she's a little socially dys
functional." he said. "1 think she has

a moral problem and not a mental
one."
Kramer added that on one in
stance, public safety officers found
Okazaki in possession of an unau
thorized card key to the building.
"We know that she had a card key
in the winter of 200b for the building
that had been issued to a visiting
scholar in the physics department,"
he said. ** I assume she convinced that
person to give her the card when he
left."
While many have speculated that
Okazaki is homeless, one undergrad
uate student, who was granted
anonymity by The Daily, said he
rented a room from Okazaki in an
off-campus house during the sum
mer of 2003. Over the course of that
summer, the student described being
puzzled by Okazaki's odd behavior.
"She said that she wanted to date
physics students," he said, "because
they could fix the washing machine
when it broke."
The student said that Okazaki —
who told him that she was a graduate
student in the film studies depart
ment — would describe having mul
tiple relationships with physics stu
dents but that it appeared to him that
"none of these students thought they

were in a relationship with her."
A handful of the students ex
pressed hope that Okazaki would re
ceive counseling. Kramer said he did
not consider providing Okazaki with
counseling one of his job responsibil
ities.
"1 don't think the University is in
the business of providing help to
homeless people." he said. "I would
sincerely love for all the homeless
people in California to be given the
help they need. But that doesn't
seem to be the priority in our socie
ty."
Ultimately, building manager
Kramer suggested that Okazaki like
ly was looking for somebody in the
physics department to provide for
lier.
"1 think she takes the easy way
out." he said. "I think she wants to be
a housewife. I think she doesn't want
to work for a living. I think she wants
a sugar daddy. If she can latch onto
some grad student who's going to be
come a professor at some university,
then 1 think she thinks that the pro
fessor's wife would be just the
lifestyle for her."
