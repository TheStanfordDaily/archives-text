In the final series of his collegiate career, senior Ryan Seawell came up big in
the Friday night opener with a three-run homer that proved to be the difference
in a 10-7 win. Seawell went 4-11 on the weekend with five RBI and six runs.
"It was huge for us," Gallagher
said of Seawell's game-winner. "We'd
been chugging along, and it came up
at a pretty big part of the game. Espe
cially from a guy like Seawell. who's
worked so hard his senior year, it was
an awesome sight to see."
Gallagher attributed his own key
role in the victory to finally finding all
his pitches.
"It was kind of one of those
nights," the junior said.'i was able to
throw every pitch for a strike. That
was just real big; my change up [and
my curve ball] came up big. Every
thing was going pretty good, so it was
just one of those nights."
Stanford's offense continued to
roll in Saturday afternoon's second
game of the series, as the Cardinal
downed the Trojans 20-13, largely on
the strength of a spectacular. 13-run
fourth inning.
While every hitter in Stanford's
lineup played a role in the offensive
explosion, the star of the inning was
right fielder Michael Taylor. The jun
ior slugger knocked in a pair of runs
on a homer to right, and followed it
up with a grand slam down the left
field line later in the frame.
"Anytime you can put together
the type of output we did in the fourth
inning in a game, let alone one inning,
it's something special ."Taylor said to
GoStanford.com. "There are a lot of
guys on the team that are swinging
the bats really well. In that inning, no
body wanted to be the last out."
Other offensive performances of
note came from a pair of juniors, as
designated hitter Brendan Domarac
ki racked up four RBI and catcher
Brian Juhl scored three runs and
brought another three home.
The Cardinal closed out the se
ries with a 10-5 win on Sunday. Tay
lor collected another four RBI,
three on a second inning, bases
clearing double, while extending his
career-long hit streak to 12 games
and recording his 16th multiple-hit
outing in his last 19 games. Sopho
more first baseman Brent Milleville,
who went 4-5 and homered in the
contest, also stood out.
Still, after heading into the bot
tom of the ninth up 10-3. Stanford
went through a pair of pitchers and
gave up two runs to put the outcome
somewhat in doubt. But Gallagher
was staunch in relief yet again, as the
junior entered the game with run
ners on second and third and walked
a batter to load the bases before
recording the final three outs of the
season for the Cardinal.
"It feels good." Gallagher said fol
lowing Sunday's game. "Everybody
knows this is what we can play like,
and finishing the year like this, win
ning nine of 10 games, is just a confi
dence builder and a good way to get
tilings going into next year. It's just
really good to see everybody playing
like they should be playing."
The Cardinal's coach was also
pleased with his team's performance
down the stretch.
"1 am proud of the way this ball
club finished the season," head coach
Mark Marquess said to
GoStanford.com. "They never quit
working hard, and the way [they]
played at the end of the season, and
the results we had in the last lew
weeks were evidence of that.
