## May 27-29, 1940: Ink flies over European hostilities 
### 
The Editor, Sir,
The German department is known to have
dined with Captain Fritz Weidemann, close
friend of Adolph Hitler...Definitely stinks...lt
fifth column activities ever emanate from
Stanford University, don't go off campus to
locate stench.
— "A Loyal American"
I have been reading the editorials in ITie
Daily with increasing disgust. In their attempt
to point out that America must remain neutral,
they have gone to the extent of justifying Ger
many.and accusing the English and the French
of being the chief cause of the present
war....Anyone that can justify the deaths of mil
lions of men is guilty of the second-rate think
ing that characterizes The Daily editorials.
— "Interventionist"
It is inconceivable to me, a freshman, that a
"loyal American" and especially a Stanford
student could take such an attitude as lately
expressed in Campus Opinion.
It seems necessary to recall to that person
the motto of Stanford,"Die Luft Der Freiheit
Waft," or if this sounds too fifth-columnist to
his delicate ears, "The Winds of Freedom Are
Blowing." And to recall that the German fac
ulty should be permitted the right of visiting
whomever they wish.
