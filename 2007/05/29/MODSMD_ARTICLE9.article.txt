# Night owl? It's not your fault
## 
### BY RACHEL WHELAN 
A missing fifth copy of an other
wise innocuous DNA se
quence could be the cause of
some traffic accidents that
occur in the early morning hours, re
search by scientists at the University of
Surrey suggests.
The sequence is present in multiple
copies sometimes four and some
times five — in a region of the genome
known as the PER 3 gene. Professor
Derk-Jan Dijk and his colleagues found
that those who inherit two long versions
of the gene are more likely be "early ris
ers." whereas those who inherit two short
versions of the gene are more likely to go
be "night owls."
'Hie early risers' performance after 4
a.m. in the second day of a sleep-depriva
tion study showed a significant decline
compared with that of the night owls.
Sleep-wake cycles are guided by two
basic principles: They are linked to the
light-dark cycle of the day, in what are
known as circadian rhythms; and are
aimed at making us sleep an average
number of hours each night, called sleep
homeostasis. It you don't get enough
sleep one night, you are likely to sleep
longer and more deeply the next night to
catch up; meanwhile, early and late risers
have different patterns of brain wave ac
tivity and hormone production at differ
ent times of the day.
For the study, two dozen volunteers
underwent a physiological monitoring
in which the researchers observed as
pects of their sleep under normal condi
tions. and then during two days of sleep
deprivation.
During the two days of sleep depri
vation. Dijk tested the participants'
working memory and attention. In the
first day.the early-risers and the night
owls performed equally well. But when
the researchers ran the same tests be
tween the hours of 4 and cS a.m. on the

second day, the
early-risers per
formed much worse

while the night
owls' perform
ance barely de-

graded at all.
This could help
e x plain why
many sleepiness
related accidents

occur — 4 a.m. is
around when
most such acci
dents occur out
side of thelabora
tory.

Even after the
end of sleep depriva

tion. the researches
discovered significant

new differences. After
two full days of wakeful-

ness, the participants were al
lowed to sleep — but while it

took early-risers an average of
eight minutes to fall asleep, night

owls needed 18. Once asleep, early
risers spent 50 percent more of their

time in slow wave sleep, or deep sleep,
than night owls — something that didn't
happen normally. ITie researchers con-

cluded that early-risers thus have a
greater need for sleep, which explains
their inferior cognitive performance
when tired.

And in case young adults think that
they can circumvent the conclusion of
this research through willpower. Dijk
found that indeed the opposite is true:
the impact of your genetic endowment
was most significant in their youngest
studied age group: 18-29 years. Tough
luck.
