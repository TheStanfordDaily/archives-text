# Eggs a la Terman
## 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The suspense was almost too much to hear at last
Friday's Egg Drop Contest, when the crowd con
verged upon a strange contraption outside of Terman
Engineering Center. At its feet was a red, taped-up
container that smelled faintly of...peanut butter?
"Material science at its finest!" said Jacobi Grillo
'09, describing the device he and teammate Diego
Azurdia '09 had assembled to survive the five-story
drop. Having exhausted their resources until 30 min
utes before the competition, the most convenient al
ternative they could find to house their egg was a jar
full of peanut butter: Quite the unconventional, yet
entertaining, recipe for success.
Diapers, toilet brushes and twisted balloons fit for
a clown also made an appearance at the sixth annual
Egg Drop, a challenge sponsored by the engineering
honor society Tau Beta Pi. The event challenges stu
dents from all majors to build a device that will protect
a raw egg's descent from the fifth floor of Terman. Egg
survival does not guarantee a victory, however; a scor
ing formula is careful to factor in weight, deviation
from a drop target three meters from the building and
time of fall.
Coterminal student in chemical engineering
Wataru Ebina, the event coordinator and vice presi
dent of Tau Beta Pi. made changes to this year's con
straints to maximize the participants' range of entries.
The scoring formula used during his freshman year in
corporated a length element, which, along with the
weight factor, gave parachutes a particular advantage.
This year, his elimination of the length factor "helps
people be more creative in their design. It gives more
points to things that fall really fast, yet survive, which
is more impressive."
Beyond these constraints, Ebina assured that
"there's no right or wrong." Compared to an academ
ic world of dry problem sets, he described the compe
tition as a perfect "outlet for pent-up creative ener
gy"
Creative, indeed. The devices surely lived up to
their intriguing titles, among them "Most Eggcel
lent,""Flush,""King Missle" and "Mellow Yellow."
Before the drop, Jim Lamb '08 and James Chu '08
proudly unveiled what they called the "Space Age
Teepee," a tetrahedron of balsa wood and rubber
bands with a mylar basket in the middle. Two bal
loons are tied to the top to slow down the fall and
keep the device upright.
The "Lofty Balsam Deluxe Dropper" likewise ex

ploited balloons' lightweight qualities. Adam Klutz
*09 used the skills and materials he had acquired as an
assistant clown in high school to twist himself an egg
dropping device. The design process was tedious, hut
according to teammate Niko Reid '09, the possible
"glory of winning was worth it to us."
However, creativity clearly did not reign to the ex
clusion of technical value. ITie devices were largely
successful; out of the dozen entries to participate, only
one egg broke from the fall. It was ultimately up to the
scoring formula to distinguish between the surviving
groups.
After a suspenseful round of calculations, the win
ners were soon announced, with a score of 682 points:
Jon Gabrio '07 and Eddie Schlafly '07.
"We were inspired by the stiffness of bathroom toi
let brushes," explained Gabrio, a Product Design
major. ITirough a period of rapid prototyping, he and
his teammate ultimately found the most effective so
lution to be two toilet brushes wrapped around a plas
tic tub that could crumple together upon impact.They
also wrapped the egg in wetsuit material to absorb en
ergy.
Apart trom being awarded the sheer glory of victo
ry, Gabrio and Schlafly also received a prize of $500.
What's to come of their winnings?
In the true spirit of engineering, Gabrio will use his
prize winnings to fund his project for ME2I6. Product
Design: Implementation.
