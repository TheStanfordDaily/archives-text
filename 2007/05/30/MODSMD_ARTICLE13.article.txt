# Finding value in interdisciplinarity
## English Prof. Helen Brooks celebrates connections 
### VAUGHAN MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Old harriers are breaking and new connec
tions are forming, both in the greater world
and in the University. Interdisciplinary studies
and approaches to academia reflect and help
education adapt to this changing climate.
Helen Brooks, as acting professor of English
and associate director of the Interdisciplinary
Studies in Humanities program, has intimate
knowledge of the contemporary role of inter
disciplinary studies, both personally and pro
fessionally
Before discovering this interdisciplinary
approach to academia. Brooks was an ardent
fan of English literature, especially of John
Donne's poetry. She earned a joint Ph.D. in
English and Humanities from Stanford in
1980. Questions about how the Early Modern
Era's culture and philosophies influenced

Donne's work presented
themselves to Brooks.
Donne's work was
steeped in "a wide range of
ideological changes and
concerns," Brooks said.
"ITiese concerns derive in
large part from profound
historical pressures during
that era that broke through
established boundaries and

aesthetic laws of literary, philosophical and vi
sual forms."
These realizations suggested to Brooks the
necessity of understanding not just what
Donne wrote, but also of understanding
when, where and how he wrote it. She dove
into researching the events surrounding
Donne's poetry and into the particularities of
the late sixteenth century and early seven
teenth century era in which he wrote. Accord
ing to Brooks, this historical approach to a
work often "grants that text an immediacy
and historicity" it would not otherwise have
had.
"I personally find my work in literature

and other fields endlessly enriched by my in
terdisciplinary orientation," she explained.
"In my experience, texts gain an historical
presence at times mindful of what Northrup
Frye describes as 'the radical of presenta
tion.'"
The value of interdisciplinary studies is not
limited to the humanities, however. Brooks
pointed to the Environment and Energy
Building and its innovative organization as an
example. In most research institutes, the re
searchers and faculty are grouped along de
partmental lines; in the new Environment and
Energy Building, however, they will be
grouped by their area of research focus. Simi
larly, the Medical School is now offering a
course on narratives and narrative structure
to help future physicians better understand
their patients' stories.
But Brooks does not want to stop there;
she said she would like "more dialogue be
tween the humanities and the sciences. 1 think
there are rich opportunities for exchange."
"This is not at all to say that disciplines do
not take interdisciplinary approaches to their
fields of study; certainly many do and increas

ingly so," she said."But interdisciplinary pro
grams such as ours attempt to take a more
formalized and systematic approach to inter
disciplinary study within the context of intel
lectual and cultural history. Students come to
see that the texts they are studying are con
tiguous with the world in which these texts
were produced and therefore are inherently
dependent upon interdisciplinary modes of
analysis."
The growing presence of interdisciplinary
studies does not mean that we should do away
with the disciplines, however. Brooks pointed
out that "interdisciplinary study depends
upon the disciplines and education about dif
ferent disciplinary perspectives."
This interdisciplinary approach has far
ranging and serious application to much of the
modern world, according to Brooks. She dis
cussed the "growing diversity and cross-cul
tural issues" in today's world and how an in
terdisciplinary outlook "prepares us to im
merse ourselves in that world."
