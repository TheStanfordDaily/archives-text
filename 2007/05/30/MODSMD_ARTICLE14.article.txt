## Street protests in Chile outdo sit-in 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SANTIAGO, Chile — Last
week's arrest of 11 Stanford stu
dents for sitting in at President
John Hennessy's office even after
being asked to leave by law en
forcement — about a year after
three students were taken into cus
tody for protesting President
Bush's campus visit — may have
rekindled memories of long dor
mant campus activism. Once a
mainstay of White Plaza during the
Civil Rights movements and the
Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s,
large-scale student protests have
all but faded from the campus con
sciousness.
Such is not the case in Santiago,
where memories of past repression
linger amid current difficulties
with modernization. Earlier in the
quarter, a University-sponsored
tour of downtown was canceled for
the 43 students studying here as
hundreds of Chilean students took
to the streets in an often-violent
display against a new public trans
port system and slow-to-come edu
cational reforms.
Such demonstrations have be
come the norm in Chile, as re
minders of the previous restric
tions on assembly and expression
during the 1970s and 80s under the
autocratic General Augusto
Pinochet have, until recently,
drowned out calls for a nonviolent
approach.
Fondly referred to aspetiguinos
for their trademark navy blue and
white uniforms, Chile's high school
students have emerged as a re
markably potent political force in
recent years. When these penguins
march. Chileans get out of the way.
Demonstrations began in
March during the annual Day of
the Young Combatant — which
marks the deaths of two students
who perished at the hands of police
during an anti-Pinochet demon
stration in 1985. This year, police

used water cannons and tear gas to
break up the protesters, who in
jured 38 police officers by hurling
stones toward the authorities. At
least 819 people were arrested.
Deputy Interior Minister Felipe
Harboe called it the"day of the
young criminal," and officials said
the majority of those detained
were school-aged students under
16.
The young people leading their
peers in the streets came of age
during a time of prosperous
democracy and cannot remember
the years before the 1989 referen
dum that effectively removed
Pinochet from powei. But that has
not stopped thepenguinos from as
serting themselves politically.
Meanwhile, their college-age
counterparts — only a few years
removed from penguino-hood
themselves — have voiced their
concern about the violent displays
of activism witnessed in recent
months.
"1 think it's stupid," said Israel, a
Chilean engineering and English
student, of the violence during a
colloquium between Stanford stu
dents and local university students
last month."That's not a way to get
things done."
"They're just destructive,"
echoed Tiana, a linguistics major at
the Catholic University in Santia
go. "It gets to the point of protest
ing just for the sake of violence."
Aside from qualms about their
methods, the protests themselves
have struck a chord in the heart of
Chile. Such demonstrations have
now appeared annually, a sign of
acceptance toward public expres
sion as much as discontent with the
public transportation reforms that
have left much of downtown Santi
ago in gridlock.
"1 want our citizens to be criti
cal, self-conscious and to express
their ideas and demands," Presi
dent Michelle Bachelet told local
press during similar protests in 2(X)f>.
when hundreds of thousands of stu
dents rallied in the streets of Santiago.
"However, the criticism must he ex
pressed in a constructive manner, lay
ing clear proposals upon a table and
most importantly, with an unveiled
face, without resorting to violence."
Bachelet, who was elected in 2(X)6
with a 53 percent majority, has seen
her political base unravel as transit re
form has become a dirty phrase in
Santiago. The new network, which
aims to modernize the übiquitous or
ange buses notorious for their nox
ious fumes, instead has paralyzed
mass transit as hundreds of routes
have been canceled and the subway
system overloaded.
During Pinochet's 16-year reign,
political parties and expression were
formally banned. Abundant civil
rights abuses — including the disap
pearance, assassination and torture of
sonic 3.(KK) political dissenters and
prisoners — effectively wiped politi

cal culture off the map.
Hut when Pinochet's neo-liberal
economic reforms faltered with the
debt crises of the early 1980s, cracks
began to form in the grip of military
rule and calls for more openness
gained steam. When the general's
term came up for reelection in 1989,
he lost a popular referendum by a 14
percent margin, paving the way for
democratic elections to choose his
successor the following year.
Now. nearly 35 years removed
from the 1973 military coup that
brought Pinochet to power. Chile's
robust democratic legacy has
reemerged with gusto. While social
reform within a free market has been
a constant give-and-take, the occa
sional bump in the road has failed to
deter the consolidation of a demo
cratic political culture, however im
perfect.
"We may not agree with them."
said Fabia Fuenzalida, coordinator of
the Stanford overseas program, while
briefing University students on the
protests, "but you have to acknowl
edge their right to do it."
