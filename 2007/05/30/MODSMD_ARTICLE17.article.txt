In yesterday's article, "Physics
lab squatter banned from campus,"
The Daily incorrectly reported that
Department of Public Safety offi
cials were trying to find apparent
Varian squatter Elizabeth Okazaki
Monday night so they could hand
deliver a letter warning her to stay
away from campus. According to
University spokesperson Kate Ches
ley. Public Safety officials intended
to deliver the letter to Okazaki in
person but no information is avail
able as to whether they were still
searching for her Monday night.
