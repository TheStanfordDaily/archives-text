## Senate meeting mired in debate 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ITie divisions in the 9th ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate were on full display at last night's meeting, the last
of the year. A number of animated debates preceded
confirmation of the new Elections Commission and the
approval of a fund transfer for a pilot shuttle program
to the San Jose and San Francisco airports at the end of
spring quarter.
Outgoing Elections Commissioner Bernard Fraga
'08 and all three members of the new Elections Com
mission — including Elections Commissioner Ryan
Woessner 10 — were present at the meeting to answer
senators' questions, which mostly concerned the future
implementation of the "fair campaign" label. The label
— given to candidates who followed a set of campaign
rules prescribed by the Elections Commission — was
new in April's elections.
When Senator Luukas lives '09 requested time to
question the new Elections Commission, Senator
Corinne Prudhomme *09 called his questioning ■disre
spectful" and redundant. lives had raised similar con
cerns about the makeup of the new commission at the
Senate's last meeting.
Stuart Baimel '09 cited some "small violations" of
the fair campaign policies that all candidates commit
ted. I le and several other senators pressed Woessner to
explain how he would improve and implement the fair
campaign policies during his term.
"As Elections Commissioner, I want to make sure
fair campaign labels are enforced to a much greater ex
tent," Woessner said. He declined to elaborate further,
citing his need for time to understand the nature of his

position and the kind of reforms he would be constitu
tionally permitted to implement.
Despite the debate, the new Elections Commission
was unanimously confirmed.
Senators spent the second half of the meeting debat
ing the merits and implementation of a bill proposing to
transfer money from the general fee reserve to fund a
pilot shuttle program to the area's two largest airports
at the end of spring quarter.
The plan, part of the campaign platform of ASSU
President I lershey Avula 08, was scrutinized by sena
tors concerned about the amount of money it would re
quire and uncertainty over logistics.
The program's most visible opponent was Commu-

ASSU Senator Jose Benchimol '08 speaks out against

Benchimol — who opened the
meeting with a critique of the recent
Sweat-Free protests — was con
cerned about the cost of the pro
gram and the benchmarks that
would be used to evaluate its suc
cess.
"There is no data because this is a
novel service," Avula replied. "Quite
frankly, the idea has received over
whelmingly positive support."
Deputy Chair Eugene Nho '10
echoed Avula and said he hoped the
program would boost the Senate's
image and credibility among stu
dents.
"Students will think, wow. the
ASSU is actually doing something
for us." Nho said.
The Senate eventually approved
the program Benchimol was the
only dissenting vote.
