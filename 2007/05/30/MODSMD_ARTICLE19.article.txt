## Senate meeting mired in debate 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ITie divisions in the 9th ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate were on full display at last night's meeting, the last
of the year. A number of animated debates preceded
confirmation of the new Elections Commission and the
approval of a fund transfer for a pilot shuttle program
to the San Jose and San Francisco airports at the end of
spring quarter.
Outgoing Elections Commissioner Bernard Fraga
'08 and all three members of the new Elections Com
mission — including Elections Commissioner Ryan
Woessner 10 — were present at the meeting to answer
senators' questions, which mostly concerned the future
implementation of the "fair campaign" label. The label
— given to candidates who followed a set of campaign

Corinne Prudhomme *09 called his questioning ■disre

Senate's last meeting.
Stuart Baimel '09 cited some "small violations" of
the fair campaign policies that all candidates commit
ted. I le and several other senators pressed Woessner to
explain how he would improve and implement the fair
campaign policies during his term.
"As Elections Commissioner, I want to make sure
fair campaign labels are enforced to a much greater ex
tent," Woessner said. He declined to elaborate further,
citing his need for time to understand the nature of his

position and the kind of reforms he would be constitu
tionally permitted to implement.
Despite the debate, the new Elections Commission
was unanimously confirmed.
Senators spent the second half of the meeting debat
ing the merits and implementation of a bill proposing to
transfer money from the general fee reserve to fund a
pilot shuttle program to the area's two largest airports
at the end of spring quarter.
The plan, part of the campaign platform of ASSU
President I lershey Avula 08, was scrutinized by sena
tors concerned about the amount of money it would re
quire and uncertainty over logistics.
The program's most visible opponent was Commu-
