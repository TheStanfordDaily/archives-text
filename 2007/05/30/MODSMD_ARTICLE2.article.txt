## Squatters' stints not isolated incidents 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
Although Azia Kim and Elizabeth Okaza
ki might have campuswide name recognition
for their extended and uninvited stints on
campus, they're hardly the first people to de
ceive their way onto the nation's top campus
es, and they wreaked relatively little havoc
compared to some others who have had more
sinister intentions at other places.
In 1997, Yale admitted graduate student
Tonica Tonise Martin from Cuyahoga Com
munity College and Ohio's Central Universi
ty with a stellar transcript and impressive let
ters of recommendation, according to The
Yale Daily News. Or so, they thought. After a
series of fishy stories unraveled. Martin was
charged with defrauding Yale of her scholar

ship money and cut a plea bargain for two
years of probation.
But the story grew darker. After being
booked on drug charges for attempting to buy
cocaine. Martin left jail on bail and kidnapped
a woman resembling herself, planning to mur
der her and steal her identity. ITie intended
victim escaped, and Martin was sentenced to
20 years in prison.
Other impostors, like Okazaki, may have
been on campus legitimately at one point, but
either overstayed their welcome or pretended
to be people they were not.
At I larvard. three students in a continuing
education program have independently
posed as undergraduates over the last eight
years. According to The 1 larvard Crimson, all


BECKY WRIGHT /The Stanford Daily
three took active part in undergrad
uate life, attending parties and join
ing student groups. One, Edward
Meinart, joined the Sigma Chi fra
ternity, whose members described
him as a model pledge. A month
after he was exposed in 1999, he pled
guilty to check fraud.
And at least one imposter claims
to have done it just to make his par
ents happy.
David Javani Vanegas pretended to
be a student at Houston's Rice Uni
versity for over a year, sleeping in
people's rooms and eating dining
hall food, confident that at most he
would incur trespassing charges.
"[Vanegas] said that he applied
to Rice and was accepted but could
n't attend." Rice University
Sergeant Gary Spears told The Rice
Thresher. "He said that it would
break his mother's heart if he didn't
attend Rice, so he carried out this
ruse for three semesters, showing up
here every day."
