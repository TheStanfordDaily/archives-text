## 'Somos' shines light on Latin America 
### ROXNA IRANI 
Since its inception in the winter of
2005-2006, "Somos" has aimed to
spark campuswide dialogue about the
dynamic culture and politics of Latin
America. Now. as the magazine's co
founders step down from top leader
ship roles, a new crop of writers hopes
to carry the torch and expand on the
publication's founding mission.
Salvador Perez '07 and Nora
Salim '06. the cofounders. conceived
of the magazine as a way to engage
interested campus communities with
the political and economic develop
ments sweeping the South American
continent.

"From the Rio Bravo to'lien a del
Fuego, a very real, tangible Latin
American identity is crystallizing."
Perez said. "People and governments
are coming closer together and the
Union of South American Nations is
integrating the continent on a model
loosely based on the European
Union. Our mission is to discover and
discuss these issues in a consistent
manner and depth."
In its three issues,"Somos" has ex
plored the impact of Venezuela's Bo
livarian Revolution, conservation in
Peru, the death of former Chilean
President Augusto Pinochet, the un
employed workers movement in Ar
gentina and the Mexican elections.

1 .uis ( Jarza Sada '06. a contributing
writer for the magazine, got involved
with the publication through the Mex
icans at Stanford Association.
'I took the opportunity to try and
make Americans understand life
south of the border through the eyes
of a Mexican," he said. "Many things
in today's world are bringing the U.S.
and Latin America together, and I
think Somos' contributes to bridging
the gaps that arise from established
differences"
In its upcoming issue,"Somos" will
outline the social and political devel
opments in Central America.
"It is a region often ignored in world
news reports," said co-editor Benny
Padilla 07, "despite its successes and
its failures that serve as models or
stern warnings for the entire Latin
American region, if not the develop
ing world."
Hie new editors hope to make the
magazine's Web site more interac
tive. Perez said that he hopes to see
"Somos" increase the breadth of its
Latin American art coverage beyond
its standard music artist and abstract
art briefings. He also said he hopes
"Somos" will remain committed to
covering the entirety of Latin Amer
ica.
"One thing I hope continues to be
the trademark of 'Somos' is its insis
tence on covering all of Latin Ameri
ca,"he said, "unlike the mass media
which currently focuses mainly on
events in Venezuela and Mexico."
