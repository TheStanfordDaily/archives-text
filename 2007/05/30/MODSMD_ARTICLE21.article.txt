## Senior Recitals: Four years in the making 
### KATHLEEN RYOU 
Hundreds of music lovers have
flocked to Campbell I (all to watch stu
dent musicians showcase their skills at
the Music Department's annual Senior
Recitals this spring. But few in atten
dance at the shows — which take up to
a year to plan — realize how much
preparation and planning is involved.
For many students, the recital is a
culmination of several quarters of
planning and practice that intensifies
after they submit a recital proposal at
the end of their junior year.
To prepare for their performances,
which are intended to represent the
best of their college music, students log
four to eight hours of practice each day.
They compile a pamphlet of program
notes that informs audience members
about the historical background of
each song in the recital.
"I chose my pieces at the end of my
junior year, wrote program notes at the
beginning of winter quarter, then had a
couple of dress rehearsals as I got clos
er to the recital," said pianist Teresa I .iu
'07. who began playing when she was
four years old.

"I went over my pieces with my
harpsichord teacher."he said."And be
cause a lot of them are modern. I trav
eled to San Francisco to play them for
the actual composers."
Music Dept. Chair Stephen Sanosaid
each performance has a personal touch.
"The experience varies from stu
dent to student because the project can
be tailored to each student's specific
interest," Sano said.
Soprano Georgia Duan '07 said she
is excited to perform lunar themed
songs at her upcoming recital, which
she has called "Songs to the Moon."
"I was familiar with the genre,
and there's a sense of awe." she said,
when it comes to "songs sung direct
ly to the moon or what is revealed
under the moonlight."
For many students, hosting a recital
provides them a chance to give back to
the Stanford community and to thank
their family and friends for years of
support and encouragement.
"I called my recital 'On Their
Shoulders,'"said Michelle Kwon '07."I
wanted to dedicate it to those who
helped me."
