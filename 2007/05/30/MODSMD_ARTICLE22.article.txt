## Editorial Board Lessons from Azia Kim 
### 
Administrators will surely be using
the coming weeks to evaluate what,
if any, policy changes the University
should take in the wake of the Azia Kim in
cident. Despite the drama that has sur
rounded the exposure of the masquerade,
there is little cause for alarm or paranoia.
Neither should we heed the vocal faction
salivating for the proverbial blood of a
young woman who, uncharged with any
crime, has been the target of relentless na
tional media attention. It is time, rather, to
forgive this stressed-out Stanford hopeful,
who was only able to carry on her self-de
structive deception because we didn't pay
enough attention to her.
What is needed instead is a renewed
focus on communication and engagement
throughout Student Housing and Residen
tial Education, especially among those stu
dents on the front lines of dorm community
— Resident Assistants (RAs).
Despite the fact that some students feel
as though their safety or the security of their
belongings has been compromised by Kim's
actions, this series of events is not in any way
comparable to a theft or a mugging. If
thieves wanted to rob a Stanford dorm, they
would not choose to infiltrate the housing
system and the friendship circles of two un
dergraduate dorms over an eight month pe
riod; they would simply break a window and
take what they wanted.
We hope that administrators will not
take these events as a sign that a security
crackdown is necessary or warranted. The
campus was no less secure during the eight

months in which a young woman posed as a
student, and we hope that the police do not
overreact.
Although heightened security is unnec
essary. the incident does highlight the im
portance of communication at all levels of
the University's bureaucratic apparatus.
The arrival of a new student to a dorm
should be the subject of a dialogue between
Student 1 lousing and dorm RAs. As the on
site representatives of Residential Educa
tion. RAs — who receive quarterly listings
of their residents — should be active and
aware of what is going on in their halls.
When they are notified of new arrivals, RAs
should be proactive in saying hello. If the
Housing record and the names of students
living on a hall do not match, RAs should
alert the proper authorities.This is, after all,
what they're paid to do.
While the incident demonstrates the
existence of troubling cracks in the ResEd
system, one positive point is worth noting.
The fact that two students in Kimball and
another in Okada all accommodated Kim
by sharing their rooms with her speaks to
the trusting and friendly nature of our stu
dent body. Although the incident can be
viewed as a result of naivety or ignorance
on the part of roommates, dorm staff and
housing services, Kim's story is also a re
flection of the open and accepting person
alities of those same people. We are proud
to boast having students who were friend
ly and welcoming to what appeared to be
a fellow student looking for a place to
stay.
