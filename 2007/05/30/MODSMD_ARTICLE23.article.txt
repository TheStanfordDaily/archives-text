# The 						Imposter
## 
### 
For those of you expecting a commen
tary on the 1994 film " ITie Impos
tor," based on a Phillip K. Dick short
story of the same name, following the en
gineer Spencer Olham's quest to regain
his identity after being suspected as an
alien android because of his creation of
the ultimate weapon to destroy other
enemy androids, you're out of luck. I have
yet to see this movie, but based on its de
scription. I must admit that 1 am quite in
trigued.
1 use "The Imposter" here in the sense
of an archetype, under whose umbrella
falls the collective body of charlatans,
fakes, frauds, shams and posers that have
existed throughout history. In light of re
cent Stanford events, and to deflect atten
tion from the fact that a) I have no online
Facebook account (I deleted it), b) Nei
ther my name nor my face appear in the
old-fashioned freshmen paper facebook,
and c) I routinely enter rooms through
windows (all true), I have decided a mus
ing on the subject is appropriate.
Hi is article will not be a "You Go
Girl!" style "hats off to Azia Kim" salute.
Nor will it consist of a compilation of
Chuck Norris jokes in which I interchange
"Chuck Norris" and "Azia Kim" I will not
berate the administration or express sym
pathy with the amount of stress the young
woman had to be under.
I have decided instead to take a histor
ical approach, looking at the illustrious
impostors of times gone by. Perhaps be
fore we point an accusing finger at Ms.
Kim. we should try to understand what
others have done in her situation.
One of the earliest impostors on record
is the great George Psalmanazar, a 17th
century Frenchman "born in Taiwan." He
published the work "An Historical and
Geographical Description of Formosa
(Taiwan), an Island subject to the Emper
or of Japan." in which he described his
homeland and its capital city of "Xternet
sa." His work was widely read throughout
Europe, and received great acclaim.
The people of Taiwan, Psalmanazar ex
plained, walked naked, save for penis
shaped gilded genital coverings. Their
chief food source was a serpent that they
hunted and killed with branches. And an
nually, they sacrificed the hearts of 18,0(K)
young boys to gods and priests, eating the

bodies.
Psalmanazar lectured on Formosan cul
ture and language; even translated religious
texts into Formosan. He personally adopted
the Formosan lifestyle, eating heavily spiced
raw meat, sleeping upright in chairs and
worshipping the moon. When the issue of his
skin color was brought up, the man ex
plained simply that he had lived under
ground for the majority of his time spent on
the island.There was just one problem with
all of this: Psalmanazar had never been to
Taiwan.
Flash forward several hundred years
and travel to the American Southwest. The
year is 1893, and James Reavis is riding
high.The self-proclaimed "Baron of Arizo
niac," has just stolen Arizona. This man,
whose ridiculously large muttonchops are
a testament to 19th century fashion, pur
chased a bag of land deeds from a Mexican
noble family entitling him to 18,(X)0 square
miles of land in present-day Arizona. He
proceeded to post flyers 011 every door in
the state calling for residents to register
their properties with the Baron on penalty
of arrest. It was only later discovered that
he had received funding from various rail
road magnates, and his bag of claims, pur
chased for 100 dollars, was completely null
and void.
In the I%o's, the karate instructor Kee
han Sensei decided to suddenly call him
self Count Juan Raphael Dante and
claimed to be an heir to the Spanish
throne. This developer of a system now
known as the Dan-te system, or the
"Dance of Death," heavily promoted him
self via comic book ads as the "Deadliest
Man Alive," and offered expensive mem
bership cards to his Black Dragon Fighting
Society. The would-be heir to the throne
eventually got into one of the deadliest
karate brawls in history, in which two men


Nat
Hillard
kNat-ural Philosophy
were killed and a rival dojo was set
aflame.
Finally, we have "CEO and pro
fessional athelete" Aleksey Vayn
er. This Ivy League senior sent his
resume to ÜBS AG investment
company, and attached was a video
entitled "Impossible is Nothing."
In the video, the Ukrainian-born
Aleksey demonstrates various
feats of physical prowess. Aleksey
bench presses 4 1 )5 pounds, serves a
tennis ball at 120 miles per hour,
and ballroom dances to saucy
Latin music with a scantily-clad
Asian woman. The man even
chops up a stack of 7 bricks at the
end of the video, shortly before the
music from "Lord of the Rings"
plays and the credits roll, accom
panying the Chinese characters for
"success." You guessed it. this was
all bogus.
Viewed in this context, Azia Kim
is but a small and relatively insignif
icant part of a grand historical
movement to dupe and misinform
the populace. She's not the first, and
she's certainly not the best, but she
is Stanford's own. Cal doesn't have
an imposter.

Nat really is a Stan ford student. He

In the video, the Ukrainian-born
Aleksey demonstrates various
feats of physical prowess. Aleksey
bench presses 4 1 )5 pounds, serves a
tennis ball at 120 miles per hour,
and ballroom dances to saucy
Latin music with a scantily-clad
Asian woman. The man even
chops up a stack of 7 bricks at the
end of the video, shortly before the
music from "Lord of the Rings"
plays and the credits roll, accom
panying the Chinese characters for
"success." You guessed it. this was
all bogus.
