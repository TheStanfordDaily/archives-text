# Sharing is caring
## 
### 
1 recently received an email from our fa
vorite Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
Greg Boardman. I can't remember the
exact words, hut I think it went something
like this:
"Dear Kevin,
You download copyrighted material. You
will pay large fines if you continue. Yes.
Kevin. I am talking to you. We are always
watching.
Love.
Greg Boardman"
Obviously this isn't verbatim, but you get
the point. Like every person between the ages
of three and forty-five who owns a computer,
I have certainly downloaded the occasional
copyrighted file. A song here, a song there.
Maybe the latest episode of "The Office" or
some funny turtle porn (they make clicking
noises!). You know what I'm talking about.
Therefore this sudden assault on file sharing
scared me more than I would like to admit.
But then I just got angry (note: By
"angry" 1 mean slightly annoyed for the
three minutes after reading the email). After
all, we are the Napster generation (back
when it was free). We are a generation that
grew up with the idea that my files are your
files. It's not that we like to steal or break the
law. we just like being generous. It's written
in every kindergarten classroom: Sharing is
caring.
While I will always blame Metallica. I sup
pose it was inevitable that the Fat Suits losing
money in the music and movie industries
would do something to curb our digital chari
ty. First they tried to shut down the peer-to

peer web sites. Then they tried to encrypt
their songs and movies. Then they cried and
crapped their pants (wiping their asses, of
course, with the royalties they just made off of
the latest 50 Cent album). Finally they did
what anybody would do who is rich and lack
ing public support: 'Fhey went straight to
Capitol Hill and bought themselves a law â€”
the Digital Millenium Copyright Act
(DMCA), signed by President Clinton in
1998.
I don't blame the University for fining us.
After all, our laundry is free. I lowever. what
Stanford and the music industry don't under
stand is that college students will always be
one step ahead. We spend half of our young
adult lives stuck behind a computer and 1
don't think a new fine is going to make us
suddenly put up the white flag. My hypothet
ical business school professor told me that
demand drives progress. This means, right
now, there is a CS major trapped in the dark
corners of Sweet Hall programming a new
way to share our files behind a digital curtain.
They may have "the law," but we will always
have desperation.
In a recent Daily article. Senior Universi
ty Council Lauren Schoenthaler explained
that processing a single complaint from the

DMCA can take up to two hours ("Illegal
Internet users to face fines," May 23). Pro
cessing three consecutive complaints about
a single file-sharing Robin Hood swallows
up to 200 hours of manpower. Two hundred
hours? I could record the entire album I was
going to illegally download and still have a
week to make turtle porn in that amount of
time.
Rather than reevaluate their business
model, big record labels concentrate on at
tempting to enforce unenforceable meas
ures. Rather than work with music lovers and
embrace the power of the Internet, they con
tinuously fight fire with fire. Rather than
make music cheaper and widely available
across the Web. they continuously invest in
better digital encryption and the latest "Now
fliat's What 1 Call Music" album (Seriously,
folks, these songs are on the radio every five
minutes). Fans are apathetic and recording
companies are bankrupt. The Internet didn't
kill the music industry. Greed was the culprit.
I love music. In fact, 1 spend a bigger por
tion of my monthly paycheck buying music
than I do on haircuts, clothes and alcohol
combined. While I have illegally downloaded
albums (or burned them from a friend be
cause everybody knows it's the exact same
thing, just less convenient), I go to sleep at
night with a clear conscience. After all, 1
wouldn t want to tell my kindergarten
teacher that her motivational posters were a
complete lie.

Kevin realizes this column should have been
written in 1999, hut he could not type hack then.
Email him at kpadrez@stanford.edu if you
love music too.
