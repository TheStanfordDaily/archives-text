Hurricane Katrina project vandals are
despicable
This act is representative of everything
that is worst about our country. The callous
disregard for a fellow human being is simply
abhorrent, especially given the topic of the
art display. I wonder if the vandals even real
ized the dark irony of their act. Their active
disrespect for this exhibit symbolizes and
gives form to the passive disregard America
as a whole has shown to the people of New
Orleans and to all the victims of Hurricane
Katrina.This is so offensive I can't even think
straight.
I'd like to thank Sarah on behalf of all de

cent people here at Stanford for her amazing
project. I just wish that a few savages hadn't
done their best to ruin it.

Tobacco funding ban rejection saddens
What a sad day for us Stanford graduates
whose families have been decimated by
deaths caused by the tobacco industry to
read that the Stanford University Faculty
Senate has rejected the proposed ban on ac
ceptance of research funding by the tobacco

industry ("Tobacco funding ban fails," May
18).
My father, a life-long smoker, was lied to
by the tobacco industry through most of his
life about the life-threatening effects of
smoking, leading to his death from lung can
cer and emphysema. He never did get to see
me graduate from Stanford.
My mother, who did sec me graduate
from Stanford, was also lied to by the tobac
co industry on the life-threatening effects of
secondhand smoke, leading to her death
from lung cancer from my father's smoking
and all those smoke-filled offices she was
forced to work in.
Mow ironic that Stanford University, an

institution founded as a result of the tragic
and unnecessary death of a son so deeply
loved by his father and his mother,sees noth
ing wrong with accepting money from an in
dustry that caused the tragic and unnecessary
deaths of a father and a mother deeply loved
by their son.

"Communist Party" shows inconsis
tency in student expression policy
As President of the Central Eastern Eu
ropean Club at Stanford, I want to point your
attention to an e fiver for the "Communist

Party" that was hosted at the Slavic and East
ern European theme house the past Friday. I
direct your attention in particular to the
phrase "21 + to purge"
ITiose familiar with European history
know that Soviet purges involved the killing
of millions in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. It is certainly neither a funny nor an
encouraging phrase for a party flyer. The
symbols of communism and the gravity of
terror and murder that this ideology has in
spired. murdering and terrorizing hundreds
of millions globally, and engaging the United
States in a half-century long struggle to elim-
inate the most dangerous regime of
the twentieth century, should turn
the University towards a more con
sistent policy regarding student ex
pression.
We cannot see the sarcasm of the
flyer. Pictured in what is supposedly
a party setting are Stalin, the number
one murderer in human history;
Mao, another one not far off and
Castro from Cuba — the create de la
create of the last century's dictators
and murderers. I believe many stu
dents from Russia and the former
Soviet republics, Eastern Europe,
China, Taiwan and Cuba would be
very disappointed should they find
out that Stanford University allows
for such student expression to take
place.
Perhaps to paint a better picture I
may use an analogy: 1 personally
have never come across a student
"Nazi" or "Fascist Party" with Hitler,
Goebbels and the swastika on
posters advertising an event of that

kind. The University. I imagine,
would never allow such an event to
take place! The same is true for any
other fascist-ideology-themed par
ties (or, to relate it to current affairs,
an "al Oaeda party").
But the standards seem to differ
in this case. It seems that it has be
come a social norm to ignore the
communist past. It is scary that these
norms transcend into the Stanford
community. It is also quite sad that
the Slavic theme house promotes
Slavic "culture' this way.
The University seems to enforce
an extremely inconsistent policy
toward student expression. Re
gardless of whether you think that
the University should be more sen
sitive towards the victims of com
munism or less sensitive toward
other groups' historical memory, I
think we currently have the worst
of both worlds: The crimes commit
ted by communism are considered
less grave than many others. Stan
ford's policy seems to allow these
norms to thrive on campus. The
party flyer and theme are offensive
to students who lost family mem
bers to purges or who had to escape
communist oppression and immi

grate to the USA.
We would like the University to
enforce a more consistent policy
with regards to student expression.
