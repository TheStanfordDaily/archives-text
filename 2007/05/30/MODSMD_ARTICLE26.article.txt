Hurricane Katrina project vandals are
despicable
This act is representative of everything
that is worst about our country. The callous
disregard for a fellow human being is simply
abhorrent, especially given the topic of the
art display. I wonder if the vandals even real
ized the dark irony of their act. Their active
disrespect for this exhibit symbolizes and
gives form to the passive disregard America
as a whole has shown to the people of New
Orleans and to all the victims of Hurricane
Katrina.This is so offensive I can't even think
straight.
I'd like to thank Sarah on behalf of all de

cent people here at Stanford for her amazing
project. I just wish that a few savages hadn't
done their best to ruin it.

Tobacco funding ban rejection saddens
What a sad day for us Stanford graduates
whose families have been decimated by
deaths caused by the tobacco industry to
read that the Stanford University Faculty
Senate has rejected the proposed ban on ac
ceptance of research funding by the tobacco

industry ("Tobacco funding ban fails," May
18).
My father, a life-long smoker, was lied to
by the tobacco industry through most of his
life about the life-threatening effects of
smoking, leading to his death from lung can
cer and emphysema. He never did get to see
me graduate from Stanford.
My mother, who did sec me graduate
from Stanford, was also lied to by the tobac
co industry on the life-threatening effects of
secondhand smoke, leading to her death
from lung cancer from my father's smoking
and all those smoke-filled offices she was
forced to work in.
Mow ironic that Stanford University, an

institution founded as a result of the tragic
and unnecessary death of a son so deeply
loved by his father and his mother,sees noth
ing wrong with accepting money from an in
dustry that caused the tragic and unnecessary
deaths of a father and a mother deeply loved
by their son.

"Communist Party" shows inconsis
tency in student expression policy
As President of the Central Eastern Eu
ropean Club at Stanford, I want to point your
attention to an e fiver for the "Communist

Party" that was hosted at the Slavic and East
ern European theme house the past Friday. I
direct your attention in particular to the
phrase "21 + to purge"
ITiose familiar with European history
know that Soviet purges involved the killing
of millions in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. It is certainly neither a funny nor an
encouraging phrase for a party flyer. The
symbols of communism and the gravity of
terror and murder that this ideology has in
spired. murdering and terrorizing hundreds
of millions globally, and engaging the United
States in a half-century long struggle to elim-
