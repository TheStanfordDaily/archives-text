## SWINGING FOR THE TITLE No. 2 Cardinal moves on to NCAA Championships with No. 12 seed 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Excitement is the only word that
can describe the No. 2 Stanford
men's golf team's final road trip to
the four-day NCAA Championships
in Williamsburg, Va. The Cardinal
starts today's competition as the
No. 1.2 seed, paired with Tennessee
and ()klahoma State for the first and
second rounds of play. The following
rounds' pairings will be determined
by team score.
With today's 1:17 p.m. first tee,
the time for the Cardinal men to
achieve their season-long goal of
competing well in the NCAA
Championships is finally upon
them.
"The guys are super excited to
make a run at the title," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "They've been
able to prove that they are one of the
top teams in the country over the
course of this season. We want to ap
proach the next couple of days with
confidence and just continue to do
what we've been doing all year. The
golf course is great and the forecast
is good. I'm really excited for the
next days to come."
The top 15 seeds of the tourna
ment, in order, include: Georgia,
Tulsa, Alabama, UCLA, Florida,
Southern California, Lamar, Geor
gia Tech, Arizona State, Tennessee,
Oklahoma State. Stanford, Georgia
State, Coastal Carolina and East
Tennessee State. The Cardinal will
be competing with a total of 30
teams and six additional golfers, in
cluding Daniel Summerhays of
Brigham Young, Kyle Stanley of
Clemson. Chance Piptone of Penn
sylvania. Zach Sucher of UAB.Tim
Streng of Western Illinois and Dan
Woltman of Wisconsin.
The Cardinal was able to take
seventh place at the NCAA West
Regionals with an overall score of
831 (33 under par). Freshman
Joseph Bramlett came through in
the clutch for the Cardinal and
jumped 13 places to secure himself
in a tie for 10th. Bramlett had his
best performance on the last day of
the tournament, when he notched
eight birdies in his final round. He
fired scores of 71.67 and 66 to garner
a 12-under-par 204, making up a
third of the Cardinal's 33 under par
strokes.
Stanford's past successes will
give it an advantage in the tourna
ment because the team knows how
to deal with high-pressure situa
tions. The Cardinal has pulled off
team victories six times this year,
which is the most since the Tiger
Woods era in the mid "90s. Stanford

rounds, and everyone is feeling really
good about their games on this golf
course. We have been [in Virginia]
since Saturday, so the anticipation to

NCAA Championships and hopes
to dominate the course in the next
few days.This will be Stanford's 10th

appearance since 1990 and its sec
ond in the past three years. The last
time the Cardinal brought hack the
NCAA Championship trophy to the
Farm was in 1994. when they were
held in McKinney.Tex. Tiger Woods
won the last NCAA men's gull indi
vidual championship in 1996 in
Chattanooga,Tenn., while the team

as a whole finished in fourth.
"The guys have had the goal of
winning the NCAAs in their sights
all year." Ray said. "Much of what
will happen this week will be out of
our control, from the weather to the
scores we shoot. I like to tell the guys
that they need to focus on the things
that thev can control, like their emo

tions and what they do before a shot.
They need to let the product take
care of itself. I think that they have
really bought into that and they are
ready to take on the top teams in the
country this week."
