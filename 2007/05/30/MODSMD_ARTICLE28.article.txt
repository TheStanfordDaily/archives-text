# Goodell has his chance
## 
### 
First, there was Pacman. Ihen, it
was half of the Cincinnati Ben
gals' roster. And now. America's
most popular sport may have finally
found the poster-child for its new con
duct policy.
Atlanta Falcons quarterback
Michael Vick is a guy who would seem
to have all the trappings of fame — the
fans, the money, even the screw-up
younger brother. Vick's talent is unde
niable, and his impact on the league
and his franchise are obvious. He's a
household name, the kind of player
people pay to watch.
He's also the kind of player whose
jersey can be seen throughout Ameri
ca, like Brett Favre.Tom Brady, Peyton
Manning, Chad Johnson and LaDan
ian Tomlinson. 'ITie list is really just
about that short. You'd be hard
pressed to find a player who's had a
bigger impact on the game, its hype or
its bottom line.
And that's exactly why Vick's possi
ble involvement in a dog fighting ring
is so interesting: TTiere may be no bet
ter opportunity for the NFL's new
commissioner. Roger Goodell. to get
across his point that the league means
business when it comes to enforce
ment of its conduct policy.
And as the weeks pass, the story
just refuses to die.There was the orig
inal discovery of a house owned by
Vick where numerous injured dogs,
fighting equipment and parapherna
lia were discovered. A steady stream
of anonymous sources has been com
ing forward ever since to various
media outlets. Most recently, ESPN
claimed that despite Vick's assertions,
the former Pro Bowl quarterback had
an intimate knowledge of the happen
ings at his property, and that Vick had
even placed bets on some of the fights
himself.
Vick was booed by fans at the NFL
Draft when he, future I lall of Fame de
fensive end Bruce Smith and fellow
Falcon DeAngelo I lall stood at the
podium with the commissioner to
honor the dead of the Virginia Tech
shootings. At that point, the story had
just broken and many details had not
yet been revealed, which only serves to
demonstrate even more how polariz
ing the issue is.
And by polarizing, I mean Vick
against the rest of the country. Or, at
least the majority of the country that
don't participate in the bloody specta

cle themselves.
Dog fighting is a felony in 48 states.
And there's not exactly a public outcry
about the injustice of that fact. In
short, it's an issue that most everyone
agrees on. Unlike former Miami and
New Orleans running back Ricky
Williams, who would appear to be per
manently banished from the league
because of an affinity for marijuana,
the punishment of Vick's crime will
garner no cries of outrage or pangs of
sympathy for the embattled superstar.
If Goodell gives Vick the same treat
ment he's given Adam "Pacman"
Jones, Bengals wide receiver Chris
Henry or Williams, there will be cheer
ing everywhere but Atlanta — and
maybe there, too.
Vick's supposed crime is that des
picable. And his profile in the league
and on the national stage is that great,
making him the perfect example for
the commissioner to get his message
across with a stern punishment.There
would be no way to ignore what hap
pens next or cast it aside as a meaning
less slap on the wrist leveled against an

obscure player.
Goodell should have all the moti
vation in the world to go after Vick
with everything he's got. Previous sus
pensions and penalties handed down
by the league this off-season have
been doled out on the basis of the pub
lic relations hit caused by an athlete's
supposed misdeeds.
And it's hard to imagine a night
mare for the league that's bigger than
this. And if some reports are accurate.
Vick could be just the tip of the ice
berg. Clinton Portis and Chris Samuels
of the Washington Redskins already
gave voice to the opinions of many
athletes on the subject when they ar
gued that so long as it was on Vick's
property, no one else should care.
But of course, people do care. And
the more they find out about the per
vasiveness of the "sport" in the world
of the NFL. the worse things will get for
the league.This is why the time is now
for the commissioner to make a state
ment about just how far he's willing to
take this newfound dedication to law
fulness and good citizenship.
And the best part? You just know
that Goodell is hoping it plays out like
that.
