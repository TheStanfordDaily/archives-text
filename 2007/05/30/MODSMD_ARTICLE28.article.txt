# Goodell has his chance

First, there was Pacman. Ihen, it
was half of the Cincinnati Ben
gals' roster. And now. America's
most popular sport may have finally
found the poster-child for its new con
duct policy.
Atlanta Falcons quarterback
Michael Vick is a guy who would seem
to have all the trappings of fame â€” the
fans, the money, even the screw-up
younger brother. Vick's talent is unde
niable, and his impact on the league
and his franchise are obvious. He's a
household name, the kind of player
people pay to watch.
He's also the kind of player whose
jersey can be seen throughout Ameri
ca, like Brett Favre.Tom Brady, Peyton
Manning, Chad Johnson and LaDan
ian Tomlinson. 'ITie list is really just
about that short. You'd be hard
pressed to find a player who's had a
bigger impact on the game, its hype or
its bottom line.
And that's exactly why Vick's possi
ble involvement in a dog fighting ring
is so interesting: TTiere may be no bet
ter opportunity for the NFL's new
commissioner. Roger Goodell. to get
across his point that the league means
business when it comes to enforce
ment of its conduct policy.
And as the weeks pass, the story
just refuses to die.There was the orig
inal discovery of a house owned by
Vick where numerous injured dogs,
fighting equipment and parapherna
lia were discovered. A steady stream
of anonymous sources has been com
ing forward ever since to various
media outlets. Most recently, ESPN
claimed that despite Vick's assertions,
the former Pro Bowl quarterback had
an intimate knowledge of the happen
ings at his property, and that Vick had
even placed bets on some of the fights
himself.
Vick was booed by fans at the NFL
Draft when he, future I lall of Fame de
fensive end Bruce Smith and fellow
Falcon DeAngelo I lall stood at the
podium with the commissioner to
honor the dead of the Virginia Tech
shootings. At that point, the story had
just broken and many details had not
yet been revealed, which only serves to
demonstrate even more how polariz
ing the issue is.
And by polarizing, I mean Vick
against the rest of the country. Or, at
least the majority of the country that
don't participate in the bloody specta
