# Card comes in 10th at NCAAs, best finish in years
## Women's varsity eight concludes season at championships, takes fourth in Petite Final 
### ERIK ADAMS 
Although a photo finish didn't end the NCAA Cham
pionship hopes for Stanford women's rowing this past
weekend, one did set the Cardinal off on the wrong
course as the varsity eight finished fourth in its semifinal
on the way to 10th place overall.
After a slow start. Stanford was able to keep its Grand
Final hopes alive by winning the repechage in Friday's
first day of competition. But earlieron.it found its hopes

nearly shot. With the top three finishers in each of Fri
day's three heats advancing to Saturday's semifinals, the
Cardinal was in a triple photo-finish with Notre Dame
and Dartmouth for the final two semifinal bids.
Yale (6:33.40) took first by just over a second in Stan
ford's heat, and after an hour delay, race officials an
nounced that, although separated by only half a second,
the Fighting Irish (6:35.67) had taken second, just ahead
of Dartmouth (6:35.90) and the Cardinal (6:36.12).
Stanford returned to the water, though, battling the
other six teams that failed to qualify for the final three
semifinal spots in the repechage. ITiis time, however,
there was much less drama at the finish as Stanford
(6:35.98) notched first by just under a second, surpassing
Tennessee (6:36.91). Princeton (6:37.41) finished third to
join the Cardinal and the Lady Vols in the semifinals.

On Saturday, however, Stanford's fortunes again
turned for the worse, as did the weather. Races were de
layed an hour as fog rolled across the course, and when
the weather cleared somewhat, the second of two semifi
nals proved another tightly contested affair.
While the first four boats in the heat were all within a
boat length of each other, Stanford was struggling far be
hind. Southern California (6:26.57) led the way ahead of
()hio State (6:26.77) and Virgina (6:28.65) to claim berths
in Sunday's Grand Final. Beyond that, Notre Dame
(6:29.57) barely failed to qualify, finishing fourth ahead of
Tennessee (6:33.65). Stanford was nearly six seconds be
hind that, though,clocking in at 6:39.36.
The previous semifinal heat had Yale (6:23.93). Brown
(6:28.84) and Princeton (6:28.87) locking up the first
three spots for the Grand Final by defeating Harvard

WOMEN'S CREW
5/25-2 NCAA Championships
1 Oth place
GAME NOTES: Stanford's 1 Oth-place finish is its best since 2003. The
Cardinal will say goodbye to seniors Carly York, Araceli Ortiz and
Stephanie Connolly. Things are looking up for nexl year's squad, as the
varsity eight returns seven of its starters.
(6:29.37), Dartmouth (6:31.78) and Minnesota (6:32.11).
That set the stage for Sunday's Petite Final, where the
Cardinal and the other fourth-, fifth- and sixth-place fin
ishers in the semifinals competed to determine the sev
enth through 12th-place finishers in the first varsity
eights. In a close finish, Minnesota (6:43.53) edged out
Dartmouth (6:43.95) in the final moments of the race to
take the Petite final.

The Cardinal women's crew focuses on each stroke in a match against cross-Bay rival Cal. Stanford ended its best season since 2003 over the Memorial Day weekend, finishing 1 Oth at the NCAA Championships.
And while it looked as if Stanford
would take third, the eight ended up
being passed by a charging Ten
nessee boat (6:44.32) and finished
fourth with a time of (6:45.71). Har
vard (6:49.16) and Notre Dame
(6:51.04) rounded out the last two
spots for the Petite Final.
In the Grand Final, Yale's first
varsity eight continued its domi
nance, taking first in 6:37.08. It was
the first NCAA title in school histo
ry for the Bulldogs, whose varsity
eight swept first in every race on the
weekend and finished the season un
defeated.
Following Yale was Ohio State
(6:38.77). USC (6:39.45), Brown
(6:39.55), Virginia (6:41.50) and
Princeton (6:45.38). It was the first
time this season that USC's varsity
eight failed to finish on top.
Overall, from the three events

(first varsity eight, second varsity
eight and third varsity four). Brown
captured first for its fifth NCAA
women's rowing title, garnering a
final team score of 58 points, includ
ing top-four finishes in all three cat
egories. Virginia (54) and Ohio State
(52) finished second and third, with
Yale (51) and USC (48) rounding
out the top five.
Stanford, which did not qualify
for the team championships but re
ceived an at-large hid to race in the
first varsity eight, took 10th overall
on the strength of its fourth-place
finish in the Petite Final. ITie finish
was an improvement over last year,
when the Cardinal varsity eight took
13th at the NCAAs.
Women's rowing will now look to
continue improving next season.
This year's NCAA experience
should help as the Cardinal varsity
eight currently has only three upper
classmen and just one senior, Carly
York.
