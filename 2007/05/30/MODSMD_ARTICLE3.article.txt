# Students react to Kim
## Despite squatters eight-month ruse, most feel secure but a divide remains over who is to blame, whether Kim should be allowed to return and whether the family should pay fines 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As campus buzzed with talk about im
postor Azia Kim's involvement in ROTC. a
strong majority of more than 40 students in
terviewed Tuesday said that the ordeal has
not shaken their sense of security on cam
pus and that the 18-year-old Fullerton resi
dent who pretended to be a student for
eight months should be forced to pay resti
tution to the University.
In a battery of interviews at Tresidder
Union between noon and 7 p.m. yesterday,
questions about who was to blame for the
ruse's length drew the most diverse an
swers. But more than half blamed either
Student Housing or the resident assistants
(RAs) in Kimball and Okada, the two
dorms where Kim squatted during her time
on campus.
Students were also divided over whether
she should be allowed back, with a plurality
of respondents saying no.
Four students said the fiasco has under
mined their sense of security.
"You think everyone is a registered stu
dent. then you find out some girl has been
able to pass herself off as a student." said
Charisma Chotalia'lO. "It's kind of scary."
Lauren Wood "10 said that "it's some
thing new to think about every time you
meet people."

Even among
those who said they
did not feel less safe,
answers were varied
and included several
references to the
Apr. 16 Virginia
Tech massacre.
"1 was talking to
my mom about it
over this weekend,"
said Priyanka

Narayan 'OS, "and I feel like it's not a big
deal, but everyone is still on high alert after
Virginia Tech."
The question. "Should Azia Kim go to
jail?" got only one "yes" vote, while the
question "Should she pay restitution" re
ceived 30 positive responses. According to
the University's housing policies, Kim could
be liable for $175 per day of unauthorized
residence — $42,000 in total.
"1 think there should be some kind of
punishment or it's just encouraging this
kind of thing," said Indu Premukumar '10.
"but maybe not the full $42,000."
Some who argued for some sort of leniency
were swayed by the Long Beach native's
dedication and passion.
"I'm impressed that she could pull that
off for so long, without paying housing or
anything." said Jay Kilachand '09, who also
supported admitting Kim."l wish I could do

that."
Many cited concern for Kim's state of
mind and wondered what role psychologi
cal factors could have played in motivating
her to tell the stories she told.
"There might he mental problems that
should he looked at before we pass |udg
ment." said a freshman named Michael,
who asked that his last name not be men
tioned.
"1 think it's more important that they
have measures to account for her mental
health." said Alicia Dennis "07.
When asked. "Who, if anyone, is respon
sible for this going on for so long," 15 peo
ple held RAs somewhat responsible.claim
ing that they should have noticed suspicious
behavior and checked on their residents.
Eight placed some of the blame tin Stanford
1 lousing.
"Many people apply to be an RA just to
get a single and don't pay any attention to
their residents," said one senior, who was
granted anonymity because he has friends
who are staff members.
Twelve people either blamed no one or
said that it would not be productive to play
the blame game.
"The system is not built to catch this sort
of thing," said Estelle l.uk TO. "It was just
extremely random."


Azia Kim
Dan Meyer '08 echoed Luk's be
lief that no person or group is to
blame.
"I kind of figure that it's a fluke
thing and to catch it would require a
lot of diligence that's not really nec
essary." he said.
This survey consisted of 38 under
graduates, one co-terminal and one

master's student. There were 21 fe
males and 19 males. Twelve respon
dents were freshmen, six were soph
omores, 11 were juniors and 10 were
seniors.
Despite Facebook groups such as
"I Want Azia Kim As My Room
mate" and "Let Azia Stay," only four
students supported offering her ac

ceptance into Stanford. Fifteen were
against letting her return, and 12
were indifferent, as long as she was
admitted through the normal
process.
"Sure," said Eileen Ho '07. who
supported admitting Kim. "If she
wanted it so badly that she would
spend eight months here."

"She's clearly committed to
working" said Erica Emmons '10.
"Hut she might not he the student
Stanford wants. You'd have to go
back and look at the reasons she was
n't admitted in the first place."
