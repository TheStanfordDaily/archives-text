Arc you unhappy witli your Draw assignment?
Consider yourself luckier than the 89 students who
were guaranteed housing but are still unassigned.
Although this phenomenon might come as a shock
to many students, it is a normal occurrence, according
to Director of I lousing Assignments Susan Nunan.
"This number of unassigned, guaranteed students is
not out of the ordinary and is typical for year-to-year
fluctuations," Nunan said in an email to The Daily.

"Eighty-nine guaran
teed students were
not assigned housing
in the Draw this year.
31 more than last
year. This is out of a
total of almost 3,900
guaranteed students
— less than a one per
cent change."
There were 70
more applicants for
the Draw this year
than last —94 more
women and 24 fewer
men. For women,
2547 was the cutoff
number to receive a

Susan Nunan,

housing assignment: for men, it was 2878.
Nunan said that spaces typically open up during
the summer "melt." when students decide to go
abroad, do not enroll for autumn quarter classes or
live off-campus. There were almost 70 undergraduate
housing vacancies last fall.
"Not all undergraduates are assigned housing in
the first round Draw held in the spring of each year,"
Nunan said. "In constructing and allocating housing
spaces to meet student demand, we take into consid
eration not only the fixed number of physical spaces
that are available for assignment, but also the spaces
that will become available from drops over the sum
mer."
Unassigned students are instructed to join the au
tumn quarter waiting list by June 3, the results of
which will be available on July 22. Students who re
main unassigned after this round then participate in
walk-ins on Aug. 22, Sept. 5, Sept. 12 and then every
dav until Oct. 26.
Nunan said that next year's ab
normally large freshman class will
not impact Waiting List assignments
because spaces for freshmen have al
ready been reserved.
According to Nunan, students
who were guaranteed housing usual
ly receive an assignment by the start
of the academic year.
"Under guaranteed housing poli
cy, guaranteed students are guaran
teed housing by the end of the first
week of classes, though they are usu
ally assigned before classes begin,"
she said.

Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing and chief
housing officer, echoed Nunan's as
surances.
"In our many years of experience
assigning students to housing, we
have seen similar annual changes
that we have accommodated without
problem," he said, "and we fully ex
pect that all guaranteed students will
be assigned housing, as always, by the
start of school this fall."
Though there are more students
on the short end of the stick this year
than last, the highest unassignment
number in the past five years was in
2(X)2, when 148 guaranteed students
did not receive housing in the Draw's
first round. The number has been
higher in the past, reaching 191 stu
dents in 1998.

Panayiota Christidis '09 is a mem
ber of a four-person group with a
2847 Draw number that did not re
ceive an assignment in the first round
of the Draw. One of her drawmates
got into Storey because she had pri
ority and decided to separate from
the group but Christidis and the
other two — one sophomore and
one freshman — remain unassigned.
"I hope we end up close to each
other because that's what we wanted
but I know it will all work out," Chris
tidis said." We don't have any closure,
though, and we thought we would. 1
wish Stanford housing communicat
ed more about the possibility of not
getting assigned."
