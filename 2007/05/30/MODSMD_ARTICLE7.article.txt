IVvo of Stanford's most highly-regarded
African American professors could be leav
ing the I-arm for Harvard next year. Stan
ford's Dean of Humanities ;ind Sciences
Richard Sailer confirmed yesterday.

According to an article published last
Friday in The Harvard Crimson, Harvard
will offer a tenured position to Stanford's
Marcylicna Morgan. ;iti associate professor
of communication who also directs the I lip

Hop Archive.
It she chooses to leave Stanford.Morgan
will likely be accompanied by husband
I awrenre Bobo, who is the director of the
Center tor Comparative Studies in Race
and Fthnicity (CCSRI ).
Sailer called media coverage of the issue
"premature."
"To my knowledge Professor Morgan
doesn't actually have a letter with the de
tails." lie said. "She knows that the approval
was given but we don't even know what
Harvard was offering exactly. Ihe discus
sions haven't really had a chance to develop
yet."
He also said the University will work
hard to keep Morgan and Bobo.
"Both of them play a really vital role in
the intellectual community here." he said.

"They are leaders and we will be extremely
aggressive in convincing them to stay."
Morgan is well-known in academic cir
cles for the Hip I lop Archive, which Sailer
acknowledged was an important academic
resource at Stanford.
"[The archive) is part of the larger effort
to diversify our cultural span here." he said.
"We are eager to make sure that she is able
to develop it here."
Communications Department Chair
James Fishkin said that he and his col
leagues thought highly of Morgan.
"These things are always complicated,"
he said. "She's a great asset to the depart
ment.We'd like tokeep her.and we'll do our
best."
Fishkin added that there are a
number of levels to the process of
countering an offer from another
university.
"Once she gets a letter, we will be
talking about it,"he said. "We'll have
time to see how well Stanford can re
spond."
As of last night, Bobo had not yet
informed CCSRE staff of the offer.
Fishkin also said that he had not yet

heard of it from Morgan.
Communications Asst. Prof. Fred
Turner, who works with Morgan,
praised his colleague as a trailblazing
researcher.
"In the department she plays a re
ally important role in studying hip
hop and popular culture," he said.
"She is an exceptionally able theorist
of race and media."
Bobo is well known for his recent
work on racial inequities in the crim
inal justice system.
Harvard Prof. J. Lorand Matory
told Ihe Crimson last week that he
was "overjoyed" to hear of the offer.
He called Bobo "probably the lead

ing statistician of race relations."
"We couldn't be Harvard without
him." Matory told I"he Crimson.
Bobo said he was unavailable for
comment when he was approached by
The Daily yesterday. Morgan did not
return phone calls made to her office.
Sailer emphasized that Stanford
highly values both professors' contri
butions to the University.
"We very much want to make
sure." he said, "that they understand
how important they are to the institu
tion."
