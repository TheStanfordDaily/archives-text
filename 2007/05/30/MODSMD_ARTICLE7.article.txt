Sailer called media coverage of the issue
"premature."
"To my knowledge Professor Morgan
doesn't actually have a letter with the de
tails." lie said. "She knows that the approval
was given but we don't even know what
Harvard was offering exactly. Ihe discus
sions haven't really had a chance to develop
yet."
He also said the University will work
hard to keep Morgan and Bobo.
"Both of them play a really vital role in
the intellectual community here." he said.

"They are leaders and we will be extremely
aggressive in convincing them to stay."
Morgan is well-known in academic cir
cles for the Hip I lop Archive, which Sailer
acknowledged was an important academic
resource at Stanford.
"[The archive) is part of the larger effort
to diversify our cultural span here." he said.
"We are eager to make sure that she is able
to develop it here."
Communications Department Chair
James Fishkin said that he and his col
leagues thought highly of Morgan.
"These things are always complicated,"
he said. "She's a great asset to the depart
