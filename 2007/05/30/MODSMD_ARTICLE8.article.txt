## Hennessy: We'll join WRC, FLA He won't endorse DSP, so Coalition will rally Thurs. 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
In his first public statement since 11
students were arrested lor storming his
office last week. President John Hen
nessy partially conceded to the demands
of the Stanford Sweat I ree ( oalition. In
an op-ed that ran in yesterday's Daily.
I lennessy announced a compromise that
would lay the groundwork for the Uni
versity to join the Worker Rights Con
sortium (WRC) and the Fair Labor As
sociation (FLA).
Sweat-Free campaign members ex
pressed mixed reactions to I lennessy s
announcement, citing a continuing de
sire to join the Designated Suppliers Pro
gram (DSP) which brings a more
stringent regimen of inspections and re
el ui rem en ts.
"We're really glad that he has finally
given a response and made a decision on
this issue," said Katie I rank '09. a Coali
tion member who was one of the 11 stu
dents arrested in last week's sit-in at
Hennessy's office. "We really think it's a
first step."
I lennessy. in his more than I .(HK)word
op-ed, argued that the DSP would be an
ineffective enforcement measure which
could worsen conditions for factory
workers in the developing world.
"To understand why, you need to
know that a small number of universities
(less than 20) dominate the marketplace
for athletic wear." the president wrote.
"Stanford is a very small player with
much less than I percent of the universi
ty-branded apparel market. Unless the
vast majority of the large public institu
tions embrace the DSP. it cannot be suc
cessful."
()ther organizers intimated that I len
nessv. who said he drafted the bulk of his
op-ed more than a year ago, was
prompted to write it because of the
coalition's protests.
"We're obviously pleased that
President Hennessy has decided
we're going to join the FLA and the
WRC," added Dan Shih '09, an organ
izer of the sweat-free protests.
"We wish it didn't take as much initia
tive on our part as it did to get this first
step, but ultimately this isn't about us;
this is about the garment workers."
The University has said that a
meeting was scheduled for this week
with the Sweat-Free Coalition, and
the president had planned to share his
plans until the sit-in.
Frank expressed interest in Hen
nessy *s proposal for a "GSW: Guar

anteed Sweat-Free" label which
would be placed on clothing that li
censees demonstrate was made in
sweat-free conditions. She said the
Coalition has not really discussed this
proposal, but members were interest
ed in the possibility. Still, she said that
joining the DSP along with 34 other
schools would be more practical than
a unilateral effort.
"We're not gonna stop here," said
Coalition member Theresa Zhen '09.
"The Worker Rights Consortium is a
monitoring agency. It sends inspec
tors out to the factories. We feel that
doesn't address the systemic prob
lems. We need something with en
forcement."
Hennessy said that the University
could become a leader in higher edu
cation's effort to end the use of sweat
shop labor.
"1 believe the greatest improve
ment in workers' conditions will
occur if the WRC and the FLA can be

persuaded to join forces and re
sources" he wrote in yesterday's op
ed. "Together, they have greater po
tential to develop more effective pro
grams. 1 hope that Stanford will he
able to influence this strategic direc
tion as a member of both organiza
tions."
Sweat-Free Coalition members
said they are planning a rally for
Thursday, which they hope will pres
sure the University to join the DSP.
Shih said that protesters again plan to
march to the President's office, and
that the campaign will likely carry
into next year.
"We're gonna keep pushing for the
DSP because we think it's the only
concrete solution on the table," Frank
said. "We're looking to do a lot of edu
cation next year. There's a lot of new
interest in what it is we're trying to do."
