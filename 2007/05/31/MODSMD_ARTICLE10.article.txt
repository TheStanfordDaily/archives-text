## Editorial Board Sweat-Free tactics questionable 
### 
Last week's sit-in by the Stanford
Sweat-Free Coalition at President
Hennessy's office, the culmination of
a year-long campaign pressuring the Uni
versity to only sell apparel that had been
produced in humane conditions, should be
commended for its passion but questioned
for its methods.
Similar to the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition's campaign for a comprehensive
living wage policy for on-campus workers,
Sweat-Free Stanford's motivations are
clearly principled. A commitment to fight
worker exploitation is both socially respon
sible and in line with the policies already
adopted by Columbia, Cornell, and Har
vard. And given that Hennessy announced
in a Tuesday op-ed that Stanford would sign
on to the WRC ("Beyond Sweatshops,"
May 29), Sweat-Free can be commended
for their victory.
And yet, while the passion of these ac
tivists is not in question, we must question
whether Sweat-Free's actions last week
were warranted. Hennessy has met with
Sweat-Free representatives numerous
times over the past several months and had
proposed an additional meeting that would
have convened this week. In his op-ed. he
claims that he was already committed to
signing on to the WRC and was planning to
inform Sweat-Free organizers of this
change in University policy at the missed
meeting.
Sweat-Free Stanford may have felt that

the University and Hennessy were
"stalling," as they wrote in their Tuesday op
ed ("Why we took over the President's Of
fice," May 29). But given the repeated meet
ings and I lennessy's recent acquiescence to
one of their key demands, it doesn't seem
like legitimate channels for dialogue had
been exhausted. This raises concerns, then,
that their decision to have a sit-in was some
what rash and counterproductive—it's un
clear whether Hennessy compromised be
cause of the sit-in or in spite of it. By resort
ing to attention grabbing tactics like this,
Sweat-Free implies that the Stanford ad
ministration responds to bad publicity but
not to rational discussion. TTiis only makes
future cooperation between the administra
tion and student groups more difficult. And
in our experience, on this issue. University
leaders have been fairly responsive.
Stanford will take a stronger position in
support of the well-being of the garment
workers it indirectly employs, which is
great news for workers and Sweat-Free
alike. Hennessy's protests aside, the Uni
versity did not actually take the initiative in
implementing these reforms until after
Sweat-Free took more drastic action. But
by acting without meaningfully taking into
account the consequences of their actions,
the 11 activists who stormed the presi
dent's office risked painting themselves —
and more importantly, their cause —as
more about the act of protesting than the
results.
