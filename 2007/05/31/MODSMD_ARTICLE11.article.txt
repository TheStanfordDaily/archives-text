# I love the Bubble
## 
### 
Housing sucks. Ibe food sucks. OSA
sucks. I've heard the grievances.
And, granted, I've eaten elsewhere
during Cajun Food night,griped at only get
ting a single as a senior and complained
about the ban on alcohol-related party
names.
But I've also had bad meals at home (no
offense, Mom) and I would not have re
placed the perennials in my yard as often as
they are changed in the roundy planter by
the clock tower.
Oh. 1 know. We are paying out of every
orifice in our bodies, so a few springtime
blossoms are more than deserved. But de
spite a couple of boring lecturers here and
some poor bike intersection engineering
there, my college years have been a glory
land, a precious, insulated Disneyland resort
of learning and cliched but definite self-im
provement. I love The Stanford Bubble, and
being safely cocooned within the limits of
Campus Drive.
Firstly, although it is hard to know exact
ly how things are in reality from high atop
my ivory tower, the dating scene out there
seems depressingly comical. Not only are
there men/women much older than yourself
shopping in your age range, it will be impos
sible to run home and search all possible
common phonetic spellings of their first
name along with a keyword from that brief
conversation, hoping they listed it in their
"Interests" section. Soon, "Jim, surfing"
Omigod! I found him... and I love that
movie, too!" will be a thing of the past. Po
tentially flirtatious Internet interactions
with vague acquaintances will he so much
harder.
Stanford is a wonderful filter, for both
significant others and friends. I am not sure
I trust my own interpersonal sieve to last in
the real world, where characters like Buster
from "Arrested Development" and Dwight
from"The Office" are tragic realities. At the
risk of sounding self-congratulatory, at least
getting into Stanford shows some brains,
ambition and motivation. How do I know
people out there have these things, too? I 've
found more than my fair share of crazies at
Stanford — topping my list is a late-night
Meyer studier obliviously singing aloud to
the music in his earphones. It's hard enough

to find an apple for my eye now. let alone
when there are no longer thousands of
young, smart men within four square miles
of me. Similarly, how will I find a bestie at
work if only a few people are my age. let
alone possessing the right amount of spunk?
The Stanford Bubble is also just damn
convenient. It has made commuting a non
issue. Friends are minutes away, the gym is
of perfect warm-up, cool-down biking dis
tance, and 1 can get to the Quad in three
minutes flat — 1 am annoyed when I have to
brake while coasting downhill to class. If we
dare to roam further than our trusty self
propelled bikes can take us, Stanford pro
vides convenient and free busing, sans plan
ning, D.D.s. or cost. Given my current local
ity coddling, I'm not sure how I'll react to ac
tual transportation issues, like congested
highway onramps, gas prices and scarce
parking.
I am also not looking forward to food in
real life, either. There is no way I can offer
myself a salad bar with 47 rotating, freshly
cut options every day. I'll be lucky if I even
eat vegetables after 1 graduate. Similarly, the
real world cannot be as well-catered as Stan
ford, which has free, great food at any and
every event. The smallest departmental
open house, student reading or random
screening is guaranteed to also have a
BevMo variety of cold drinks, a profession
al smattering of cold cuts and freshly
washed, cut and artistically arranged fruit.
Not only will 1 be forced to cook for my
self, but I will also be forced to party for my
self too. Gone are the days of planned
Wednesday happy hours with free and usu
ally good beer. Thursday pub nights with
free busing, and planned and pre-decorated
all-campus weekend revelries. Will I ever go
