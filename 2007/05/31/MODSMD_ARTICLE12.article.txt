Don't Take Condi Back
Dear Editor.
This is in regards to Andrea Fuller's arti
cle of May 25, "Condi eyes return, but in
what role?"
Condoleezza Rice serves an administra
tion that has trashed the basic values of aca
demia: reason, science, expertise, and hon
esty. Stanford should not welcome her back.

Questions and debates are good
for democracy
I was amused to open The Daily to find
that the ASSU Senate was "mired" in de
bate on the issues in their May 29 meeting
("Senate meeting mired in debate." May
30). Perhaps I haven't understood my polit
ical science classes very well, but I thought
legislative bodies were supposed to engage
in debate.
The Daily also reported. "The divisions
in the 9th ASSU Undergraduate Senate

were on full display at last night's meeting,"
yet the story only noted that the Senate cast
votes of 15-0 and 14-1. I am not a math
major, but votes of 15-0 and 14-1 do not
seem very divided to me. Did the article
neglect to report some sort of 8-7 vote? Did
the story inaccurately state the Senate was
divided?
I also hope Senator Corinne Prud
homme was misquoted when The Daily re
ported that she accused Senator Luukas
lives of being "'disrespectful' and redun
dant" when he wanted to ask questions of
the new Elections Commission as part of
the Senate's advise and consent process for
confirmation of appointed officials. Did
Prudhomme think it was disrespectful or re
dundant when U.S. Senator Dick Durbin
asked Samuel Alito a question about abor
tion on the third day of his confirmation as
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
especially considering that U.S. Senator
Chuck Schumer had already asked Alito a
question about abortion the day before?
