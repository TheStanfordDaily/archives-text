Lucas is currently filming his new Star
Wars television show, and there have
been a lot of rumors circling about who
will be involved in its production. In light of
recent news, I believe I have the solution to
save face for the Lucas franchise: Put me in
the new Star Wars show.
Now, the reason for my sudden suggestion
is a curious piece of news 1 picked up the
other day. Many people are saying right now
that the beta male, the lovable loser, is the
new hero in society. In the world, alpha males
are dominating, self-serving ambitious types
who run for class elections and become high
ly-paid professionals and leaders in their var
ious fields. Apparently, to the scientific world,
the words "Alpha" and "Stanford" are syn
onymous. We are a university of eldest and
only children united by our common fear of
being idle and our ambition to be better than
everyone else.The dating scene is glorious.
The beta males are shooting a bit lower in
their aspirations, or just care enough to get a
weekly humor column. ITiis column isn't an
example of ambition, but rather of blown
promise. If I were really motivated, I would
funnel my creative energies into papers or
short stories. Instead, my life is about getting
by. I don't crave ultimate power. I crave the
ability to afford power windows.
The problem with the prequel "Star Wars"
movies was that there was no lovable beta

male. Instead, we were stuck with Hayden
Christensen. Now. Darth Vader is the defini
tion of the alpha male. The guy shits anvils.
Anakin Skywalker, at least how Christensen
played him. was more like a whining eunuch.
He didn't beat his chest and lead the battle cry;
he beat off and listened to intergalactic emo.
In contrast. Han Solo was completely a
beta male. I lis aspiration was to save his own
ass. Sure he boasted, but it was in this devil
may-care way. People loved the original trilo
gy, and I know why: it had heroes you could
identify with. Also, no Jar-Jar.
Alpha males are on the decline because
society can only stand emulating assholes for
so long. Rummy. Cheney, Inius, etc. are all
being rejected by society. Hie successes of
"Shrek," Spiderman, Chad Vader. and Kevin
Smith all point to the rise of the beta male.
Even God has gotten the hint and now the
Yankees suck.

So I'm hoping when Lucas launches this
latest foray into television catastrophe, he in
cludes some characters that we're all going to
identify with. Like, for instance, Davin Fclth.
Davin Felth was a character that fans of the
Star Wars universe created. He is most known
to people as the stormtrooper who says
"Look sir, droids!" in "A New Hope." He's
seen as an everyday man, a slacker who is just
trying to make it in the Empire. Darren and 1
did a webcomic about him, and we're expect
ing a book deal any day now. Then again,
we're also expecting Keira Knightley to come
to our super-cool pool party next week.
So 1 think that Star Wars needs some
everyday heroes. Some slackers. Smugglers
and bar patrons, not Jedi Lords and senators.
Even though it's in a galaxy far, far away, we
don't want to see Oedipus Rex. We want to
see "Cheers!" Give us a Jedi who uses his
power to get women to sleep with him." Iliese
are not the droids you're looking for. You can
move along. To my bed."
You might be saying "Chris, wouldn't sug
gesting yourself worthy of being on this TV
series makes you an alpha male?" No, if I was
really arrogant, I would insert myself in a
show that wasn't doomed to fail.
I'm not looking for a role that's going to
save the galaxy. I'd pawn the lightsaber to



Holt
Holt's Harangue
some fanboy for an Xbox. I'd use the
force to trip old people. All I want is
a hit part where I crack one-liners
and get to beat on some Jawas. Can I
be cast as an intergalactic pizza guy?
I mean. I couldn't play the major
hero. My own life is the very oppo
site of the epic. My major accom
plishment over the last five years is
writing a joke about Tara Reid's
breasts. I 'm not going to be a doctor,
lawyer, businessman, or Jedi Lord.
I leek, you wouldn't want me to lead
a game of Candvland. let alone a

galactic rebellion. If 1 make enough
through writing to pay the rent. I'll
be pretty happy. Having Jessica Alba
as a wife would be nice too. but I'll
probably just settle for buying the
Dark Angel DVDs.
And I think this mantra is perfect
for the kind of character Lucas
should want on his new show. Next
time I see you folks, it will be on the
TV screen. Hopefully, I'll be the
character in the corner of the cantina
comparing ewoks unfavorably to
talking Brillo pads. Then. I'll drop
kick a jawa.
