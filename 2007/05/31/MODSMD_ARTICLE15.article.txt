# Op-Ed
## Graduate and start searching for... health care? 
### CARMEN VICE 
As the end of the school year approach
es, many high school and college sen
iors are filled with excitement of what
lies ahead. Graduation ceremonies taking
place over the next two months mark an in
credible achievement in the lives of students
who have worked hard to ensure a great fu
ture for themselves. However, as the count
down towards completing honors theses and
final exams begins, another challenge looms.
Students may be unaware that, along with
the opportunities that accompany their newly
earned degrees, many of them will no longer
qualify for their current health insurance
plans and will be faced with the task of replac
ing them. Many of them will ultimately join a
growing number of uninsured peers. Of the
46.6 million Americans who are currently
without health insurance, 13 million are young
adults — ages 19 to 29— representing a dis
turbing increase of 2.2 million since 20(X).
In the 2004 Economic Report of the Presi
dent. the Hush administration perpetuated
the idea that the young and uninsured of our
country lack health insurance because they

don't consider it a necessity. In actuality, the
fact that so many remain uninsured is more re
flective of the high cost of insurance. For many
young adults, funds are limited. Post-gradua
tion, paying the rent and keeping the fridge
stocked takes precedence over paying hun
dreds of dollars a month for insurance. When
asked by an NYU journalist to comment on
obtaining health insurance, a Coastal Carolina
University student lamented, "When I think
about health insurance. I think about a lot of
money. Right now I have $3(K) to my name. I
ate ramen noodles today If you don't have a
job yet. how would you even pay for it?" This
student's situation is not unusual. From 1996-
2(XX). 38 percent of college graduates went
part or all of their first year after graduation
without health insurance.
Further statistics support this scenario. A
2(X)5 Report issued by the Commonwealth
Fund found that although young individuals
have the desire to obtain health insurance,
many arc no longer eligible for their parents'
health insurance that remained in place while
they were students, or the Medicaid funding
some may have had as children. As a result. 66
percent of young adults report "missing need

Ed care and/or having problems paying med
ical hills," and 56 percent declined to see a
physician when sick. In an interview with On
line Newshour. Ryan Speaker, a senior at Col
orado State University,explained,"lt's either
an extra month of rent, or accidental cover
age. I try to be mindful of washing my hands
during flu season and do the preventive
things I can in the meantime."
However, young adults are always at risk
for accidents. And considering that the
monthly payment and deductible of health in
surance — which can range from several hun
dred dollars and several thousand dollars, re
spectively — is unaffordable to many recent
grads, what happens in the case of an injury?
The cost of emergency room procedures are
exorbitant in comparison, with treatment for
a burst appendix currently approximated at
$48,151 and treatment for a compound frac
ture of the tibia and fibula at $101,790. Fur
ther. in addition to being more likely than
older Americans to be involved in accidents
that require a trip to the emergency room,
many young adults begin to start families in
the first several years after college.
For the 3.5 million women in their
twenties who become pregnant each
year, prenatal care is crucial.
The unfortunate plight of so many
hard-working grads as they are faced
with a transitional period in their
lives should force a reassessment of
the overall US. health care system. It
is unsettling that the United States is
the only developed nation that does
not have a consistent plan in place to
protect the health of its people. Until
a health care system is implemented
that guarantees its citizens basic care,
the government should strongly con
sider the feasibility of short-term
health insurance plans, or extending
current policies for recent graduates
that are attempting to establish sta
ble living situations for themselves.
While programs are in place that
provide care to most children and
the elderly, one's health should be
recognized as something of great
value by their country throughout
their lives — not overlooked from
their senior year of college until they
become senior citizens.
