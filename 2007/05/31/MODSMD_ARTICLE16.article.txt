## ROWING CHAMPIONSHIPS Lightweights hope to continue success 
### ERIK ADAMS 
As the academic year draws to a close and
seasons wrap up for spring sports, yet another
Stanford team is heading east in search of a
title.
The No. 3 Stanford lightweight women's
crew team is in Cherry Hill. N.J. today to begin
competition in the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association (IRA) National Championships.
Stanford will look to duplicate the success
it had in its last race, the Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships, two and a half weeks ago.'lTie
Cardinal steamrolled its competition on Lake
Natoma, crushing the only competitor, Loy
ola Marymount. by 28 seconds in the varsity
eight. The win at the PCRCs was Stanford's
fifth in the last six years of the event.
But things will certainly be more difficult
at the IRAs.
Not only does the Cardinal face a full field
of 12 boats, but among those are some of the
toughest teams in the nation.The IRA field is
comprised of the top-12 nationally ranked
crews.
In the first heat alone, the Cardinal is
matched up against No. 11 Lehigh, No. 10
Long Beach State. No. 7 Bucknell. No. ft Cen
tral Florida and No. 2 Princeton.
Of course, if Stanford advances into the
final heats, the competition only gets tougher.
The other heat includes No. \2 MIT, No. 9
Loyola Marymount. No. 8 Ohio State, No. 5
Radcliffe, No. 4 Georgetown and the regatta
favorite, top-ranked Wisconsin.
Stanford can at least take confi
dence in its experience with much of
the field already this season.
In early April, Stanford (then No.
7) defeated Loyola and Central
Florida (then No. 5) on its way to
face Princeton (then No. 1) in the
final. The Tigers were able to defeat
the Cardinal, but the Card charged
hard at the end of the race and
closed the gap. Knowing that they
have out-stroked Princeton in the
past should be a boost to the Stan
ford women.
More recently, Stanford had the
opportunity to square off with Wis
consin (No. 1 at the time) in Indi
anapolis. By then, the Cardinal had

climbed to its current ranking and
fell to the Badgers by just three sec
onds. Stanford did. however, edge
out both Georgetown (then No. 4)
and Ohio State in the race.
Last year Stanford finished 12th
at the lRAs— a significant drop
from a fifth-place finish the year be
fore.
With the success this team found
this year, its experience against up
coming competitors, its record and
confidence, expect the Cardinal to
compete hard for a high finish, if not
the title.
