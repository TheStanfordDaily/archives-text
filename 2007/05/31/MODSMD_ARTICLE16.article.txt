As the academic year draws to a close and
seasons wrap up for spring sports, yet another
Stanford team is heading east in search of a
title.
The No. 3 Stanford lightweight women's
crew team is in Cherry Hill. N.J. today to begin
competition in the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association (IRA) National Championships.
Stanford will look to duplicate the success
it had in its last race, the Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships, two and a half weeks ago.'lTie
Cardinal steamrolled its competition on Lake
Natoma, crushing the only competitor, Loy
ola Marymount. by 28 seconds in the varsity
eight. The win at the PCRCs was Stanford's
fifth in the last six years of the event.
But things will certainly be more difficult
at the IRAs.
Not only does the Cardinal face a full field
of 12 boats, but among those are some of the
toughest teams in the nation.The IRA field is
comprised of the top-12 nationally ranked
crews.
In the first heat alone, the Cardinal is
matched up against No. 11 Lehigh, No. 10
Long Beach State. No. 7 Bucknell. No. ft Cen
tral Florida and No. 2 Princeton.
Of course, if Stanford advances into the
final heats, the competition only gets tougher.
The other heat includes No. \2 MIT, No. 9
Loyola Marymount. No. 8 Ohio State, No. 5
Radcliffe, No. 4 Georgetown and the regatta
favorite, top-ranked Wisconsin.
