# In-house Draw
## STUDENT GROUPS Students air concerns at OSA meeting 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The Dean of Students Office and the ASSU
sponsored a town hall meeting last night to
allow students the chance to share their views
about the Office of Student Activities (OSA),
Old Union and Tresidder Union.
The meeting started with moderator Rev.
Joanne Sanders, administrative dean for the

Office of Religious Life, asking students to
name the strengths of the OSA. After more
than a minute of complete silence, ASSU Sen
ator Sarah Golabek-Goldman '10 ventured a
response.
"I think they make parties more safe." she
said. "Hxotic I rotic is much safer because of
the regulations they implemented."
"So, they help you plan parties and get the
kinks worked out?" Sanders asked.

o
Kat Kershner '08 interjected, offering a differ
ent opinion.
"While they make you plan parties in ad
vance," she said, "I wouldn't go so far as to say
they help you plan them."
This exchange set the tone for the 90-minute
feedback session in which about 20 students ex
pressed widespread discontent with what they

described as systemic problems in the OSA.
One of the most prominent concerns of the as
sembled group of senators. Row house financial
managers, chairs of Greek organizations and stu
dent group presidents, centered around what they
characterized as a lack of both transparency and
accountability on the part of the OSA.
"There's a huge sense that the OSA is judge,
jury, and executioner." Kershner said. "The same
person hears a complaint against your organiza
tion, presses charges, decides your punishment
and tracks how that punishment is carried out.
When you need an objective voice, there is no one
to go to."
ASSU senator Luukas lives '09 agreed, citing
the need for an appeals process for students un
happy with OSA decisions. lives also criticized the
"inconsistency and capriciousness" of OSA deci
sions.
"It seems that, when they are faced with similar
scenarios taking place only a few weeks apart, they
give very different decisions," lives said." 1 would
n't say their decisions are biased because there's
nothing systematic [about the process], but the in
consistency makes it extremely difficult for stu
dent groups to plan events."
Other students disagreed with lives' assertion
that the OSA was unbiased.They contended that
student groups with a history of good manage
ment build up more credibility with the OSA, and
receive faster responses to phone calls and emails
which would otherwise be left unanswered for
weeks.
"1 feel that there's definitely institutionalized
resentment on the part of the OSA," Kershner
said. She criticized the OSA for failing to recog
nize the turnover that occurs within student

groups, and for holding grudges against groups for
the mistakes of their predecessors.
All of the assembled students agreed that the
lack of transparency within the OSA encouraged
obfuscation on the part of the student groups and
Greek organizations attempting to navigate the
OSA's bureaucracy.
"The whole thing reeks of legalese and bad
faith," said one student, who identified himself
only as "a member of a Row house who's had a lot
of trouble with the OSA this year."
"There's a huge incentive to hide possibly dan
gerous things," added Ben Trombley-Shapiro '07,
citing the example of an resident assistant who
might decide not to call an ambulance for a resi
dent with alcohol poisoning because it would incur
OSA bias and make it harder to plan parties and
events.
Eric Boromisa "08 suggested that the OSA
"focus not on present failures but on best prac
tices."
The rest of the group agreed, proposing a num
ber of ways to make the OSA the resource its ad
ministrators purports it to be.The majority of their
suggestions centered around ways to expand the
department, which they agreed was problemati
cally understaffed.
'iTie group recommended that the OSA hire
different staff members to field the concerns of
students planning different kinds of events: one
specializing in social events, a second specializing
in academic and cultural events and a third to
help students handle the logistics of reserving
space for conferences and panels. They also rec
ommended that the OSA hire student consult
ants to incorporate student input and expertise
into the OSA.

Along with staff expansion, the group unani
mously agreed that the OS A needed to do a better
job of making resources available to student
groups, many of which experience similar, recur
ring problems. Suggestions ranged from a check
list for party planners to a calendar in which regis
tered heads of student groups would be able to list
parties and events, so that multiple parties would
not occur on the same day.
The final half hour of the meeting tackled stu
dent concerns about Old Union and Tresidder
Union.The main concerns surrounding Old Union
in particular were similar to those of the OSA,
with students again citing lack of transparency and
availability of information about the renovation
process. They were also particularly concerned
about the scarcity of good dining options on cam
pus outside a very limited set of hours.
ITie meeting ended on an uneasy note. When
participants asked Sanders what the University
would do with their feedback, she gave only a
vague reply.
"1 wish 1 could give you a direct answer, but I
can't," Sanders said. "All I can do is pass along this
information and say that it was raised a number of
times, and that students want to know where this
goes from here."
The email advertising the event said that the
Dean of Students Office would use the informa
tion to reform its various departments over the
summer. However, after the meeting, most stu
dents remained skeptical, expressing concern that
changes made over the summer would be imple
mented without further input, since most students
will be off campus.

dent groups to plan events."
Other students disagreed with lives' assertion
that the OSA was unbiased.They contended that
student groups with a history of good manage
ment build up more credibility with the OSA, and
receive faster responses to phone calls and emails
which would otherwise be left unanswered for
weeks.
"1 feel that there's definitely institutionalized
resentment on the part of the OSA," Kershner
said. She criticized the OSA for failing to recog
nize the turnover that occurs within student

groups, and for holding grudges against groups for
the mistakes of their predecessors.
All of the assembled students agreed that the
lack of transparency within the OSA encouraged
obfuscation on the part of the student groups and
Greek organizations attempting to navigate the
OSA's bureaucracy.
"The whole thing reeks of legalese and bad
faith," said one student, who identified himself
only as "a member of a Row house who's had a lot
of trouble with the OSA this year."
"There's a huge incentive to hide possibly dan
gerous things," added Ben Trombley-Shapiro '07,
citing the example of an resident assistant who
might decide not to call an ambulance for a resi
dent with alcohol poisoning because it would incur
OSA bias and make it harder to plan parties and
events.
Eric Boromisa "08 suggested that the OSA
"focus not on present failures but on best prac
tices."
The rest of the group agreed, proposing a num
ber of ways to make the OSA the resource its ad
ministrators purports it to be.The majority of their
suggestions centered around ways to expand the
department, which they agreed was problemati
cally understaffed.
'iTie group recommended that the OSA hire
different staff members to field the concerns of
students planning different kinds of events: one
specializing in social events, a second specializing
in academic and cultural events and a third to
help students handle the logistics of reserving
space for conferences and panels. They also rec
ommended that the OSA hire student consult
ants to incorporate student input and expertise
into the OSA.

Along with staff expansion, the group unani
mously agreed that the OS A needed to do a better
job of making resources available to student
groups, many of which experience similar, recur
ring problems. Suggestions ranged from a check
list for party planners to a calendar in which regis
tered heads of student groups would be able to list
parties and events, so that multiple parties would
not occur on the same day.
The final half hour of the meeting tackled stu
dent concerns about Old Union and Tresidder
Union.The main concerns surrounding Old Union
in particular were similar to those of the OSA,
with students again citing lack of transparency and
availability of information about the renovation
process. They were also particularly concerned
about the scarcity of good dining options on cam
pus outside a very limited set of hours.
ITie meeting ended on an uneasy note. When
participants asked Sanders what the University
would do with their feedback, she gave only a
vague reply.
"1 wish 1 could give you a direct answer, but I
can't," Sanders said. "All I can do is pass along this
information and say that it was raised a number of
times, and that students want to know where this
goes from here."
The email advertising the event said that the
Dean of Students Office would use the informa
tion to reform its various departments over the
summer. However, after the meeting, most stu
dents remained skeptical, expressing concern that
changes made over the summer would be imple
mented without further input, since most students
will be off campus.
