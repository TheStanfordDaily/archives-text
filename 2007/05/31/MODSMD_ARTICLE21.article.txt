# Men's varsity eight looks to avoid slow start in first heat today
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Most people would ask "Why fix a good
thing if it isn't broken?" but for Stanford
men's crew, the answer is simple: to make it
better.
After the No. 8 Cardinal's disappointing
third place finish at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, the men's varsity eight
surges into today's first heat of the Intercol
legiate Rowing Association (IRA) Regatta
with a new set-up, outlook and attitude.
Racing on nearby Lake Natoma on May
13, the Cardinal could not keep pace with its
top Pac-10 rivals, Washington and Califor
nia.The undefeated and top-ranked Huskies
pulled off a tight victory in the final, just 1.6
seconds ahead of the No. 3 Golden Bears,

who finished a full 5.2 seconds ahead of
Stanford.
Disappointed in its speed and slow start
the Cardinal lost a full two seconds within
the first 500 meters of the 2,000-meter race it
was back to the drawing board for the past
few weeks in preparation for the national
championships.
While senior Donny Simkin noted that
the team couldn't improve its speed as it
could have done back in January or Febru
ary. there was room for revitalization of the
team's unexecuted full abilities.
One way of doing that: switching up the
eight.
"It's a different combination of the same
eight people," Simkin said. "We haven't had
a personnel change, but moving people
around uives them a different sense of the

boat, and even if they end up in the same part
of the boat after a few switch-ups. it at least
makes it seem new and fresh again."
Head coach Craig Amerkhanian wants
more out of his crew's mental outlook,
though. The Pac-10 final's slow start proved
to be the Cardinal's downfall, and the IRA
lineup will only be more aggressive from the
opening heats.
"The character of the crew is the same,"
Amerkhanian said. "I'm just looking for
more surge and more impulse from them â€”
and more personality."
If anything needs to be different as Stan
ford heads into the three-day competition, it
is this mental attitude, the six-year coach
added.

BERNARD BLUHM/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's varsity eight team returns to the IRA Regatta this year after it was ineligible to compete last year. However, the team is now putting the past behind them, including this month's Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships, where the Cardinal finished third, disappointed by its speed and slow start. A new mental outlook might be the key to success at the IRAs.
