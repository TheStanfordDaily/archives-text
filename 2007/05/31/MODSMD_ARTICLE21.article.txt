# Men's varsity eight looks to avoid slow start in first heat today
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Most people would ask "Why fix a good
thing if it isn't broken?" but for Stanford
men's crew, the answer is simple: to make it
better.
After the No. 8 Cardinal's disappointing
third place finish at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, the men's varsity eight
surges into today's first heat of the Intercol
legiate Rowing Association (IRA) Regatta
with a new set-up, outlook and attitude.
Racing on nearby Lake Natoma on May
13, the Cardinal could not keep pace with its
top Pac-10 rivals, Washington and Califor
nia.The undefeated and top-ranked Huskies
pulled off a tight victory in the final, just 1.6
seconds ahead of the No. 3 Golden Bears,

who finished a full 5.2 seconds ahead of
Stanford.
Disappointed in its speed and slow start
the Cardinal lost a full two seconds within
the first 500 meters of the 2,000-meter race it
was back to the drawing board for the past
few weeks in preparation for the national
championships.
While senior Donny Simkin noted that
the team couldn't improve its speed as it
could have done back in January or Febru
ary. there was room for revitalization of the
team's unexecuted full abilities.
One way of doing that: switching up the
eight.
"It's a different combination of the same
eight people," Simkin said. "We haven't had
a personnel change, but moving people
around uives them a different sense of the

boat, and even if they end up in the same part
of the boat after a few switch-ups. it at least
makes it seem new and fresh again."
Head coach Craig Amerkhanian wants
more out of his crew's mental outlook,
though. The Pac-10 final's slow start proved
to be the Cardinal's downfall, and the IRA
lineup will only be more aggressive from the
opening heats.
"The character of the crew is the same,"
Amerkhanian said. "I'm just looking for
more surge and more impulse from them —
and more personality."
If anything needs to be different as Stan
ford heads into the three-day competition, it
is this mental attitude, the six-year coach
added.

GAM NOTES The Cardinal men's varsity four and
varsity eight row on the Cooper River this weekend
as the team foces a challenging field. An undefeat
ed Harvard is in the same heat on Thursday. Stan
ford's varsity four team is looking for a third IRA title,
as the team won in 2005 and 2006, while the varsi
ty eight returns after not being allowed to compete
last year. Stanford's freshman eight is also compet
ing this weekend.


BERNARD BLUHM/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's varsity eight team returns to the IRA Regatta this year after it was ineligible to compete last year. However, the team is now putting the past behind them, including this month's Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships, where the Cardinal finished third, disappointed by its speed and slow start. A new mental outlook might be the key to success at the IRAs.
Ile wants the team to have the ut
most focus on its approach and tech
nique so that the men "take what the
race gives them and go with it."
Simkin agreed that the Cardinal
already has the tools to perform well
against top competition. Stanford
heat California in April's San Diego
Crew Classic and narrowly defeated
another IRA rival. No. 6 Wisconsin,
in the Cardinal-hosted Windermere
Classic just over a month ago.
"The past few weeks, we've been
doing our normal training, focusing
on our technique, fitness and
power." Simkin said. "Everyone rec
ognizes. though, that we have the
physical ability to win. It's just about
getting in the right mindset and put
ting up with the physical discomfort
you have in racing so that you can re
spond to another team when they
move up on you."
Today's first heat for the Cardinal
will have plenty of teams on Stan
ford's tail. On a six-lane course, the
eighth-ranked Cardinal will line up
against No. 2 1 harvard. No. 10 Michi
gan. No. 13 Boston University, No.
I -Pennsylvania and No.2oColumbia.
Amerkhanian described the Car
dinal's purpose, beyond improving
and winninu at the IRAs, is to "race

outside the region'" and stack up
against the best of national competi
tion. Today's heat will be the first
taste.
"It's going to be six lanes, so
there'll be a lot of movement, but
we'll need to keep our focus in the
boat and bring out the attitude."
Amerkhanian said. "These kinds ol
situations necessitate tremendous
confidence and trust in each other, as
well as will power and aggression."
The Cardinal believes it possess
es that will power and aggression,
and the team will have to prove it
today.
Should Stanford fail to earn one
of the top two finishes, it will enter
this afternoon's repeehage as a con
solation. The Cardinal hopes to
avoid that, but is taking the nationals
one race at a time, with even a title in
sight.The IRAs are "progressive" —
spanning three days — which, ac
cording to Simkin. will allow the
team to only get better if it goes that
far.
"We'd like to be No. 1 in the coun
try, just as we would've liked to have
won the Pac-10," Simkin said. "But
that at least puts us coming in as the
underdogs again, so there's no pres
sure. We've had substantial losses,
but we've also had our share of wins,
and no one's going to be expecting
us to come out like we will [today]."

makes it seem new and fresh again."
Head coach Craig Amerkhanian wants
more out of his crew's mental outlook,
though. The Pac-10 final's slow start proved
to be the Cardinal's downfall, and the IRA
lineup will only be more aggressive from the
opening heats.
"The character of the crew is the same,"
Amerkhanian said. "I'm just looking for
more surge and more impulse from them —
and more personality."
If anything needs to be different as Stan
ford heads into the three-day competition, it
is this mental attitude, the six-year coach
added.

Cherry Hill, N.J.
GAM NOTES The Cardinal men's varsity four and
varsity eight row on the Cooper River this weekend
as the team foces a challenging field. An undefeat
ed Harvard is in the same heat on Thursday. Stan
ford's varsity four team is looking for a third IRA title,
as the team won in 2005 and 2006, while the varsi
ty eight returns after not being allowed to compete
last year. Stanford's freshman eight is also compet
ing this weekend.


BERNARD BLUHM/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's varsity eight team returns to the IRA Regatta this year after it was ineligible to compete last year. However, the team is now putting the past behind them, including this month's Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships, where the Cardinal finished third, disappointed by its speed and slow start. A new mental outlook might be the key to success at the IRAs.
Ile wants the team to have the ut
most focus on its approach and tech
nique so that the men "take what the
race gives them and go with it."
Simkin agreed that the Cardinal
already has the tools to perform well
against top competition. Stanford
heat California in April's San Diego
Crew Classic and narrowly defeated
another IRA rival. No. 6 Wisconsin,
in the Cardinal-hosted Windermere
Classic just over a month ago.
"The past few weeks, we've been
doing our normal training, focusing
on our technique, fitness and
power." Simkin said. "Everyone rec
ognizes. though, that we have the
physical ability to win. It's just about
getting in the right mindset and put
ting up with the physical discomfort
you have in racing so that you can re
spond to another team when they
move up on you."
Today's first heat for the Cardinal
will have plenty of teams on Stan
ford's tail. On a six-lane course, the
eighth-ranked Cardinal will line up
against No. 2 1 harvard. No. 10 Michi
gan. No. 13 Boston University, No.
I -Pennsylvania and No.2oColumbia.
Amerkhanian described the Car
dinal's purpose, beyond improving
and winninu at the IRAs, is to "race

outside the region'" and stack up
against the best of national competi
tion. Today's heat will be the first
taste.
"It's going to be six lanes, so
there'll be a lot of movement, but
we'll need to keep our focus in the
boat and bring out the attitude."
Amerkhanian said. "These kinds ol
situations necessitate tremendous
confidence and trust in each other, as
well as will power and aggression."
The Cardinal believes it possess
es that will power and aggression,
and the team will have to prove it
today.
Should Stanford fail to earn one
of the top two finishes, it will enter
this afternoon's repeehage as a con
solation. The Cardinal hopes to
avoid that, but is taking the nationals
one race at a time, with even a title in
sight.The IRAs are "progressive" —
spanning three days — which, ac
cording to Simkin. will allow the
team to only get better if it goes that
far.
"We'd like to be No. 1 in the coun
try, just as we would've liked to have
won the Pac-10," Simkin said. "But
that at least puts us coming in as the
underdogs again, so there's no pres
sure. We've had substantial losses,
but we've also had our share of wins,
and no one's going to be expecting
us to come out like we will [today]."
