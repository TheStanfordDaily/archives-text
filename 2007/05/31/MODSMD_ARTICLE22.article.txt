# Men's golf in first place
## Stanford three strokes ahead of four-way tie for second 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team dominated the
first day of the NCAA Championships, finishing in
the coveted top spot after a phenomenal perform
ance in Williamsburg, Va.
The main contributor to the Cardinal was jun
ior Rob Grubc. who holds a two-stroke lead over
a vicious pack of top collegiate golfers in individ
ual competition.
As a team, the Cardinal fired an overall five
under-par score of 275. Stanford is three strokes
ahead of a four-way tie for second between Flori
da. Coastal Carolina, Minnesota and Texas.
All teams hit the course again in tomorrow's
second round of play.
"The rest of the tournament is going to be a real
test of golf," Stanford head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The guys felt really good about today's
round. Conditions were a lot tougher since we
were playing in the afternoon, but I think that we
got really lucky that Rob had such a great round.
We definitely have a lot of golf left, and the guys
are really looking forward to tomorrow's round."
If the NCAA Championships are a test, as Ray
described, Grube certainly aced the preliminary
exam. The junior stepped up his game yesterday,
notching a six-under-par 64.1 le also picked up five
of his six birdies on the front nine holes.
Florida's Tim McKenney is just two strokes be
hind and right on Grube' heels with a four-under
par 66.
"Rob really led the charge for us today." Ray
said."His score of 64 is pretty phenomenal on the
golf course that we are using."
Sophomore Daniel Kim also contributed to the
Cardinal's great day on the Golden Horseshoe

The Cardinal is in good standing with a five-under-par 275 after the first round of play at the NCAA
Championships in Williamsburg, Va. Stanford had three of its golfers shoot at par or below.
Golf Course by shooting a one
under 69, putting him in a tie for
15th.
Concluding the day in tie for 29th
was senior Zack Miller, who goes
into day two with a clean slate on an
even-par 70. Just behind Miller was
his senior teammate Matt Savage
(72: two over par). Freshman Joseph
Bramlett shot an eight-over-par
score of 78 during his first round of
play ever at the NCAA Champi
onships.
In addition to the Cardinal's first
successful day at the NCAA Tour
nament, all five Stanford golfers
participating in the championship
were selected by the Golf Coaches
Association of America to be on the
PING All-Region Pacific team as
result of their exceptional perform
ance throughout this past season.
Stanford has a lot to be excited
about after its first day at the cham
pionships. The team has a bright
and-early tee-off time of 8:17 a.m.,
but that won't stop the Cardinal
from coming out strong to defend its
lead.
"Now that the grass is growing
and the greens are warming up.con
ditions will only get more difficult
over the coming rounds." Ray said in
a phone interview yesterday. "We
need to stay consistent and keep
being a successive team. The team
that wins is just going to go and get
it. We can't rest on what happened
today — we'll see what happens to
morrow."
