# SPECIAL EVENT
## Cantor displays nomad art 
### CARLEE BROWN 
I he Cantor Arts Center's newest
exhibit, "Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara
Nomads in a Modem World," pre
miered yesterday, bringing the first
major display of Tuareg art to campus.
Hie exhibit showcases a wide array of
jewelry, leatherwork and clothing as a
cultural representation of this tradi
tionally nomadic West African people.
"[We want] to show the range of
significant art and culture from
around the world and across time at
Cantor," the museum's Manager Tom
Seligman said in an email to The Daily.
"This is another effort to do so, to help
our community better understand the
complex and increasingly intercon
nected world in which we live."
The Tuareg people are comprised
of several groups of pastoral nomads,
settled agriculturalists and scattered
city dwellers. Tuareg artists form a so
cial group known as the ituuhm,whose
work is the major focus of the exhibit,
llieir silver crosses, leather bags and
wooden bowls are all featured in the
exhibition.The art is largely tradition
al. and artisan techniques are passed
from generation to generation.
"I've grown up on this." explained
Tuareg artist Elhadji Koumama,who
was present at the exhibition preview.
The Cantor exhibition includes art
that ranges from traditional Tuareg
jewelry to weaponry to teapots.
The exhibit also has some Western
ized items like salt and pepper shakers
that were made to cater to the aid
workers and missionaries who came
to West Africa during the l%()s and
'70s.
Sophia Powers '07 said she found
the Westernized art particularly inter
esting.
"I found the showcase of tourist art
very interesting, even though tourist
art is defined as separate from high
art," she said. "I liked that they put
tourist art as a clear part of the fine art

on display."
The exhibit includes some interac
tive features as well, as a video of a Tu
areg wedding in the Sahara desert of
fers a glimpse into the lives of the no
madic people.
For Seligman — who originally en
countered the Tuareg during his time
in the Peace Corps and has worked
with the people for 35 years — help
ing people learn about the Tuareg and
their culture is the primary goal of the
exhibition.
"I've spent a lot of time with them,
it's like being a part of a family," he
said."l'm partial to them, to their art. 1
hope that over time, this will help them
as people get to know them and buy
their work."

Some Tuareg musicians, members
of a group called Tidawt, will perform
at the Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at
the Knoll tomorrow at 6 p.m. Stanford
community members arc encouraged
to bring an instrument, which they will
have the opportunity to play with
Tidawt members Hasso Akotey,
Omara Al Moctar and Alassane Foun
gounou.
"Art of Being Tuareg" will be at
Cantor until Sept. 2, when it will leave
for the National Museum of African
Art at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C.
