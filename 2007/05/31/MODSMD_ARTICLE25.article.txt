## GSC offers only half of expected funds for airport shuttle service 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Plans for an airport shuttle
service subsidized bv the ASSU
hit a speed bump last night, as the
Graduate Student Council (GSC')
voted to contribute only half of
the funding expected to be pro
vided for the program.
Organizers for the shuttle serv
ice, which would transport stu
dents from campus to the San
Francisco and San Jose airports at
the end of the quarter, said it will
still be provided, though there will
be some logistical modifications.
The Undergraduate Senate
voted Tuesday to provide $7.(H)()
for the $14,000 service, expecting
that the GSC would pick up the
rest of the tab.
But in a detailed discussion of
the funding proposal, members of
the council expressed concern
that because graduate students
operate on a different schedule
than undergraduates, there would
not be enouiih graduate riders to

justify paying half of the bill for
the shuttle service.
"I think it's a really cool idea,
but I don't know if half the riders
will be graduate students," said
former GSC member Cullen Buie
at last night's meeting."! think the
GSC should fund it, but half
sounds like a little much."
ASSIJ President Hershey
Avula 'OS. who is one of the lead
organizers for the shuttle service,
said that even though graduate
students might not ride in large
numbers, the end-of-the-year
service could be a pilot for cour
tesy services at Thanksgiving
break, for instance, when gradu
ate students do leave campus in
larger numbers.
"The reason we're going all out
on this is so students can see the
program in its glory." Avula said.
"So. come Thanksgiving, students
will want it."
Ultimately, the GSC voted 5-4
to approve $3,500 for the pro
gram. leaving the shuttle service
short of its fund inn goal. Avula

said the shortfall in funding
would probably mean cutting the
frequency with which shuttles
will operate — they were origi
nally expected to run hourly from
5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Updated details
for the service will be released
shortly.
In other matters, the GSC
unanimously approved next
year's ASSIJ Elections Commis
sion. which will be comprised of
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Woessner '10, Mahlet Seyoum '10
and Anna Khan '10. Recent
changes to the Commission's by
laws require a graduate student
on the commission, but no gradu
ate students applied. Bernard
Fraga 'OS. this year's Elections
Commissioner and a member of
the selection committee that
chose next year's members, said
that someone will be found over
the summer or early next year to
fill that role.
