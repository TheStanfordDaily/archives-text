University of Toronto bioethics professor Peter A. Singer
said advances in biotechnology will improve living condi
tions in the developing world and forthe reconciliation of the
pios and cons o! biotechnology during a talk at the History
Corner yesterday afternoon.
Singer cited the new Hepatitis B vaccine created by the
Indian company Shanta Biotechnics as an example of one
way that the new technology has benefited poorer nations.
He cautioned that while the advances in technology can
have gieat potential, they can also be abused. Ile referenced
the 2(X)2 anthrax scare as an example of the dark side of
biotechnology.
Singer said biotechnology tools are more easily replicated
and. thus, possibly more dangerous — than nuclear
weapons.
"You get the Nobel Prize for PUR [a biochemistry tool],"
he said,"and two. three years later PCR is in high school bi
ology labs."
Because ol the dilluse nature of biotechnology research.
Singer warned that preventing the spread of harmful bio
chemical knowledge could become next to impossible. In an
effort to balance the new technology's dangers and benefits.
Singer called on the global community to create a forum to
discuss ethics in the lile sciences and on leaders to instill a
sense of responsibility in young scientists.
In particular, he said, a prominent official in the global
community, such as the United Nations secretary general,
should be "at the nexus of development and security."
