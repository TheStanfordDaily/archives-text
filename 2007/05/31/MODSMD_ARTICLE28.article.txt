## Stanford, Cal recruits battle at Google Event seen as tool to pull talent to the Web behemoth 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford and IJC-Berkeley stu
dents get together in a competitive set
ting. it is usually on a football field or in
some other athletic contest. But when 60
Stanford students squared oft against
their counterparts from Cal last month in
Mountain View in the first annual C loogle
Games, it was as a veritable battle of the
brains.
The Apr. 28 contest, which tested
everything from Sudoku skills to Ninten
do Wii prowess, was designed as a way for
the cross-bay rivals to rekindle a "Big-
Game-esque" competition among the
computer science and engineering stu
dents from the two schools. It was also a
recruiting ploy by the search engine giant.
Twenty-four teams of five people -
12 each from Stanford and Cal com
peted in three tasks designed to test dif

ferent skill sets. Activities included Lego
bridge building, pu/zles and a "special
surprise contest" that turned out to be a
Nintendo Wii competition.
Competitors tackled seven puzzles, in
eluding Sudoku and computer program
ming challenges, for the Nintendo Wii
competition, participants used the video
game system's motion sensitive con
trollers to compete in virtual cow racing
and fishing. Ihe winning I.ego bridge,
meanwhile, held more than 120 pounds of
gravel suspended beneath it before even
tually giving way.
liie top finishers in each contest were
awarded points toward a cumulative
score, and prizes included Google duffle
bags and team dinner gill certificates.
Ihe Stanford teams scored higher
than those from Berkeley and were
awarded a Google lava lamp trophy,
which is on display in the Gates Building,
room 272.
"Stanford pretty much swept all of the
awards." said Jeff Seibert 'OS. a member of
the "Angry Caterpillars." which won the
spirit award. "I don'l think Berkeley was
too pleased."

Competitors applied to the Games
though a standard application process,
even though the event was created with
recruitment in mind.
"(iooglc is a great place for young de
velopers and coders wanting to work on
the world's most challenging problems."
said a press release advertising the
C iames. "We're always on the lookout lor
innovative, enthusiastic students who
know how to put the 'G' in teamwork."
Students who participated in the event
understood its underlying importance.
" Ihe purpose of the Games is to get
students interested in Google so they'll
he interested in working there after col
lcge,"said David (iohaud '07. who organ
ized the opening ceremony. "To get the
Google name out there."
Iroy Steinmetz "07. another member of
the Angry Caterpillars,said he thorough
ly enjoyed the Games.
"ingeneral.it was great really fun."
he said. "Who wouldn't want to spend a
Saturday solving puzzles?"
