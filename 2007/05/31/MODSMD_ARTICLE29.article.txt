## New iTunes songs free of copying restrictions 
### MAY WONG ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store has
started selling thousands of songs
without copy protection, marking
the trendsetting company's latest
coup and a model for what ana
lysts say will likely become a pat
tern for online music sales.
Launching initially with songs
from music company EMI Group
PLC on Wednesday, i Tunes Plus
features tracks that are free of dig
ital rights management, or DRM.
technology — copy-protection
software that limits where songs or
movies can be played and distrib
uted.
The unrestricted content
means some songs purchased
from iTunes will work for the first
time directly on portable players
other than Apple's iPod. including
Microsoft Corp.'s Zune.
The inaugural batch of iTunes
Plus songs includes music from
Coldplay, The Rolling Stones,
Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra. Pink
Floyd and more than a dozen of
Paul McCartney's classic albums.
The DRM-free tracks feature a
higher sound quality and cost
$ 1.29 apiece — 30 cents more than
the usual 99-cent price of other,
copy-protected songs at the mar
ket-leading online music store.
If available, users can upgrade
existing purchases to DRM-free
versions for 30 cents a song or $3
for most albums, Apple said.
London-based EMI. the
world's third-largest music com
pany by sales, and Cupertino
based Apple announced their
partnership in April to deliver the
industry's first major offering of
DRM-free songs, sharing a vision
of what both companies say their
consumers want: flexibility and
CD-audio quality.
Other smaller online music
vendors, such as eMusic.com, al

ready offer songs without DRM.
but the selections have been limit
ed to mostly content from inde
pendent labels.
Barney Wragg. the global head
of digital music at EMI, said the
iTunes Plus launch capped six
months of work to convert most all
of the company's digital catalog
into a DRM-free format.
"Our customers told us two
things deterred them from buying
digital," Wragg said. "They
weren't 100 percent confident
that the songs they'd purchase
could play on their devices, and
they wanted something closer to
CD quality."
Earlier this year, Apple CEO
Steve Jobs called on the world's
four major record companies to
start selling songs online without
copy-protection software.
"We definitely think it's the
right thing to do," Eddy Cue,
Apple's vice president of iTunes.
said Wednesday. "In this case,
EMl's a leader and we think oth
ers will follow."
In a statement Wednesday, Jobs
reiterated that Apple expects that
more than half of the 5 million
songs on iTunes will feature a
DRM-free version by the end of
the year.
In the meantime, Apple's
iTunes Store will continue to offer
songs in the same copy-protected
format as today at 99 cents per
download and encoded at 128
kilobits per second. The iTunes
Plus versions are encoded at 256
kbps, which Apple says makes the
audio quality on par with original
recordings.
Apple also will continue to en
code its songs — including EMl's
DRM-free content — in the AAC
audio format, which could force
some users to go through an extra
step of converting tunes into a ver
sion that would be compatible
with their players.
