### BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A special prose
cutor could not have had worse timing for telling a
judge he'd cleared him of theft for taking a college
student's ringing cell phone during a class.
Special prosecutor Rob Ives had just delivered
his report Friday in Tippecanoe Superior Judge Les
Meade's crowded courtroom when his own cell

phone began ringing.
Ives quickly left the courtroom, which has a post
ed sign instructing those entering to turn off their
cell phones. Other attorneys waited nervously to
see Meade's reaction.
As it turned out. the judge liked Ives' ring tone
the song,"l Fought the Law (and the Law Won)."
"It was the perfect ending to this little annoy
ance." Meade said.
Six weeks ago, Meade was teaching a business
law class at Purdue University when a student's cell
phone began ringing. Meade took away the stu
dent's phone after he said the student failed to turn
it off promptly.

Meade said he intended to turn it over to the
dean's office the next morning. But the student, in a
hurry to get his phone back, called Purdue police.
Officers told Meade if he failed to return the
phone to the student his refusal would constitute
theft.
While Meade was talking with officers. Richard
Cosier, dean of Purdue's School of Management,
arrived and took the phone. He returned it to the
student after lecturing him about rules against using
cell phones during class.
Prosecutor Pat Harrington said he sought a spe
cial prosecutor to avoid the appearance of impro
priety.
