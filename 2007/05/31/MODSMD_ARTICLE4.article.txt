# Cultural stress linked to suicide
## Study finds families, shame, stress make Asian-American women more prone to suicides 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Asian-American women demon
strate a high rate of suicide when com
pared with women of other ethnicities,
California State-Fullerton researcher
Eliza Noh found in a recent empirical
study.
Noh and Stanford mental health pro
fessionals Alejandro Martinez, the direc
tor of Counciling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS) and Rona Hu, director of
the Acute Inpatient Unit at Stanford
Hospital, told The Daily that parental
pressure, cultural differences between
the United States and Asian countries
and avoidance of mental health issues in
Asian-American families can contribute
to the prevalence of mental health prob
lems.
Following the death of graduate stu
dent Mengyao "May" Zhou earlier this
year and the recent revelation that Azia
Kim had been squatting in Stanford
dorms for eight months despite the fact
that she was not a student, suicide and
mental health issues in the Asian-Ameri
can community have become widely-dis
cussed on the Stanford campus.
Citing the ongoing study, Noh said that
the tendency of Asian-American women
to ignore or deny stress, depression and
other mental health problems can cause
the larger anxieties that lead to suicide.
"There are multiple factors that con
tribute to suicidality," Noh said. "(For
Asian-American women] there is this
pressure to do well in school and that

pressure comes from their family mem
bers. There is a miscommunication or a
lack of communication with their par
ents, lliere is a cultural division between
them and their parents."
"They are expected to listen to their
parentsshe said, "to do well in school,
not to ask questions and not to talk
back."
All those cultural pressures can lead
Asian-American women to treat mental
health issues like an elephant in the
room, exacerbating existing problems
and generating others.
Ilu argued that, for many Asian-
American women, culturally-related is
sues can contribute directly to mental
health problems. She cited young women
she knew who had been disowned by
their families because of circumstances
that parents interpreted as failures.
"The whole concept in the Asian fam
ily is that the family is not a democracy,"
I (u said. "Parents feel entitled to make
decisions for their children, including
what major or career to chose, or whom
to marry. There's a line from a movie
where they say,' There's no word for pri
vacy in Chinese.'"
"The sense of shame can be a big part
of Asian-American culture and that's
something that Americans don't under
stand so much," she added. "If Hugh
Grant is caught doing something (shame
ful J he apologizes and goes on with his
movie career. In Asia, shame can endure
for generations.The default Asian coping
mechanism is denial."
Martinez added that differences between educa
tion systems in America and Asian countries can
lead to misunderstandings within families.
"Specifically in some Asian countries, people
have to make career decisions almost when they
get to high school." Martinez said. Coming from
such a background, parents often misinterpret
their childrens' decision to explore different
fields in college.
"If someone did that in their country of origin
it would be a dramatic setback." he said. "They
may not be familiar with how much flexibility is
possible in the United States."
Martinez cited Korea's suicide rate, which is
far higher than the United States.
"Ihe consequences of someone getting a 'B' in a
class at Stanford really aren't that great in the
context of career decisions and career opportuni
ties." he said. "In other cultures they can be signif
icant."
Noh said that open discussion of mental health
issues in the community, along with the availabil
ity of resources that can cater specifically to Asian
Americans, can be used to counter the problem.
"Iliere has to be some serious commitment on
the part of the community." Noh said. "[Re
sources] need to be appropriate for Asian-Amer
ican students. Councilors should be trained in the
languages that they speak and have some level of
cultural awareness of [students'] backgrounds."
Without those specially tailored resources, she
said. Asian-American women in her study often
chose to reject counciling and therapy altogether.
"The big fear was that they didn't want to go to
strangers who didn't know about their situation."
she said. "Asian Americans have the lowest rates
of utilization of mental health services. There is
something about traditional mental health servic
es that doesn't appeal to Asian Americans.
Hu and Martinez said that Stanford has re
sources for Asian-Americans available at campus
mental health facilities.

"We address this in two ways." Martinez said.
"An important one is to have diversity on our
staff. In addition to that, we do commit some of
our resources to making sure that all of our staff
have sensitivity to the communities that make up
Stanford students."

Hu and Noh both said that in addition to pro
viding ethnicity-specific resources, fostering dis
cussion of suicide and mental health is important
because avoidance of the issue is pervasive in the
Asian-American community.
"Helping io de-stigmatize things is very help
ful," Hu said."l don't see people disowned so fre
quently in other cultures."
"The number one factor that [study partici
pants] felt in terms of contributing to suicide is
that they felt alone and helpless and that they did
n't have any place to turn." Noh said. "I've re

tion systems in America and Asian countries can
lead to misunderstandings within families.
"Specifically in some Asian countries, people
have to make career decisions almost when they
get to high school." Martinez said. Coming from
such a background, parents often misinterpret
their childrens' decision to explore different
fields in college.
"If someone did that in their country of origin
it would be a dramatic setback." he said. "They
may not be familiar with how much flexibility is
possible in the United States."
Martinez cited Korea's suicide rate, which is
far higher than the United States.
"Ihe consequences of someone getting a 'B' in a
class at Stanford really aren't that great in the
context of career decisions and career opportuni
ties." he said. "In other cultures they can be signif
icant."
Noh said that open discussion of mental health
issues in the community, along with the availabil
ity of resources that can cater specifically to Asian
Americans, can be used to counter the problem.
"Iliere has to be some serious commitment on
the part of the community." Noh said. "[Re
sources] need to be appropriate for Asian-Amer
ican students. Councilors should be trained in the
languages that they speak and have some level of
cultural awareness of [students'] backgrounds."
Without those specially tailored resources, she
said. Asian-American women in her study often
chose to reject counciling and therapy altogether.
"The big fear was that they didn't want to go to
strangers who didn't know about their situation."
she said. "Asian Americans have the lowest rates
of utilization of mental health services. There is
something about traditional mental health servic
es that doesn't appeal to Asian Americans.
Hu and Martinez said that Stanford has re
sources for Asian-Americans available at campus
mental health facilities.

"We address this in two ways." Martinez said.
"An important one is to have diversity on our
staff. In addition to that, we do commit some of
our resources to making sure that all of our staff
have sensitivity to the communities that make up
Stanford students."
Hu said that at the Stanford 1 lospital.some of

the attending physicians and residents in psychia

Mandarin are available.
Hu and Noh both said that in addition to pro
viding ethnicity-specific resources, fostering dis
cussion of suicide and mental health is important
because avoidance of the issue is pervasive in the
Asian-American community.
"Helping io de-stigmatize things is very help

"The number one factor that [study partici
pants] felt in terms of contributing to suicide is
that they felt alone and helpless and that they did
n't have any place to turn." Noh said. "I've re
ceived lots of emails of thanks [...] from people
happy that there is dialogue taking place."
