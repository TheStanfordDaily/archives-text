# Cultural stress linked to suicide
## Study finds families, shame, stress make Asian-American women more prone to suicides 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Asian-American women demon
strate a high rate of suicide when com
pared with women of other ethnicities,
California State-Fullerton researcher
Eliza Noh found in a recent empirical
study.
Noh and Stanford mental health pro
fessionals Alejandro Martinez, the direc
tor of Counciling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS) and Rona Hu, director of
the Acute Inpatient Unit at Stanford
Hospital, told The Daily that parental
pressure, cultural differences between
the United States and Asian countries
and avoidance of mental health issues in
Asian-American families can contribute
to the prevalence of mental health prob
lems.
Following the death of graduate stu
dent Mengyao "May" Zhou earlier this
year and the recent revelation that Azia
Kim had been squatting in Stanford
dorms for eight months despite the fact
that she was not a student, suicide and
mental health issues in the Asian-Ameri
can community have become widely-dis
cussed on the Stanford campus.
Citing the ongoing study, Noh said that
the tendency of Asian-American women
to ignore or deny stress, depression and
other mental health problems can cause
the larger anxieties that lead to suicide.
"There are multiple factors that con
tribute to suicidality," Noh said. "(For
Asian-American women] there is this
pressure to do well in school and that

pressure comes from their family mem
bers. There is a miscommunication or a
lack of communication with their par
ents, lliere is a cultural division between
them and their parents."
"They are expected to listen to their
parentsshe said, "to do well in school,
not to ask questions and not to talk
back."
All those cultural pressures can lead
Asian-American women to treat mental
health issues like an elephant in the
room, exacerbating existing problems
and generating others.
Ilu argued that, for many Asian-
American women, culturally-related is
sues can contribute directly to mental
health problems. She cited young women
she knew who had been disowned by
their families because of circumstances
that parents interpreted as failures.
"The whole concept in the Asian fam
ily is that the family is not a democracy,"
I (u said. "Parents feel entitled to make
decisions for their children, including
what major or career to chose, or whom
to marry. There's a line from a movie
where they say,' There's no word for pri
vacy in Chinese.'"
"The sense of shame can be a big part
of Asian-American culture and that's
something that Americans don't under
stand so much," she added. "If Hugh
Grant is caught doing something (shame

movie career. In Asia, shame can endure
