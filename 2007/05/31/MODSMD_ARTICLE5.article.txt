## Scientists create charitable Web service Students urged to give via site as they move out 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to a new Web site devel
oped by Stanford scientists, stu
dents moving out this summer will

be able to donate their unwanted
belongings to charity instead of
throwing them away.
Charitopia.org was founded in
March as a resource for the San
Jose chapter of Habitat for Hu
manity to locate donors. The site
has since been modified to include
other charitable organizations.
ITie site's developers thought
the service would be especially rel

evant as students move out of
housing at the end of this school
year.
"For example, say that you are
moving out of your apartment and
want to get rid of your TV and your
old couch," said Michael Kassoff, a
computer science graduate student
who helped develop the Web site.
"You can list those items on Chari
topia and needy charities can con

tact you about those items."
Kassoff said the site serves an
important purpose as a conduit be
tween potential donors and chari
table organizations. He added that
it was "a big waste of time" for
charities and donors to find each
other through guesswork, and a
flurry of telephone calls ;md emails.
Charitopia was developed by the
Stanford Logic Group (SLG) —
which is comprised of computer sci
ence students and researchers —
and by a group of lawyers from the
Stanford Center for Computers and
Law.
Computer Science Prof. Michael
Genesereth, who heads SLG, de
scribed the scientific motives behind
the development of the site.
"The main technical reason for
working on Charitopia is to develop
the product ontology — or classifi
cation and properties of products
and to develop, deploy and test se-

mantic matching algorithms," he
said. "The benefits of these innova
tions are already evident but will be
come clearer in future versions of
the system."
In the future, the web developers
will create a separate page for the
existing service that allows individu
als to donate to each other.
"Eventually, this part of Chari
topia will be spun off into a sister
system called Freetopia,"said Gene
sereth. "It is a sort of free eßay.'lhe
only constraint is that the goods be
free."
About 10 charities have signed
on si) far. including the Silicon Val
ley chapter of I labitat for 1 lumanity.
AIDSfreeAFRICA and the Belle
Haven School. Genesereth expects
a few dozen more to join in the next
couple of weeks.
Kassoff said the site's conven

ience and efficiency are attractive to
users.
"It's a fully automated process,"
he said. "Charitopia allows donors
and charities to specify products in
terms of their properties, in such a
way that the computer can under
stand what is being described."
While the nascent Web site is still
fairly simple, its developers envision
future enhancements. Despite its
current limitations,however.Genes
reth said he thinks the site will still
be popular among students and
charities.
"There are many improvements
waiting in the wings," he said, "but
we think we have a sufficiently us
able service to put it out there for
general use."
