## Giant tank of water and ice lies under campus 360 miles of steel tubing help save $500k/year on energy 
### LINUS LIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Buried deep beneath the Jordan Quad Parking Lot
is a tank so massive that it can hold 4 million gallons
of water. Every night, tubes inside the tank are filled
with below-zero temperature ammonia, turning the
water in the tank into a giant. 8-million-pound cube of
ice.
"It's not really a big ice cube," it's a series of 1-inch
diameter tubes, said Robert Reid.the manager of Stan
ford's Energy Service.
Hut how are they shaped?
"They're in rectangular blocks that arc 20 feet by 10
feet, and we have 40 of them."
And how are they arranged?
Side by side, Reid said. And then he admitted it.
"So from far away it could resemble a giant cube of
ice."
This non-ice-cube contains 360 miles of the steel
tubing Reid described. When these tubes are filled with
antifreeze, the water surrounding the tubes turn into

3.5-inch diameter cylinders of ice.
Stanford is in the ice-making business is for
one reason only: to save $500.(XK) every

ergy demands are low. Dur
ing the day, the stored energy
is then used to cool campus,
by hooking up to the chilled
water system that runs out to
approximately 120 buildings
on campus.
The Ice Plant —an un
marked building on the cor
ner of Campus and Jordan
Way — is the largest facility
of its type west of the Missis
sippi, and one of four plants
that comprise Stanford's
Central Energy Facilities.
Within the walls is a crew of
approximately 30 people

who constantly monitor and
maintain the facilities responsible
for powering the entire University.
Why ice?

The technology behind the non-ice-cube and similar
forms of energy storage is not new. The tank itself was built in
1976 to chill cold water. But as the demand for energy in
creased, Stanford decided to spend $22 million in 19% to
convert the facility to an ice cooler. There was not enough
space to increase the size of the tank, and ice can store almost
three times as much energy as water in the same amount of
space.
Since the new plant opened in 1999. there have been sever
al changes, none major. The system is mechanically complex,
so most of the modifications have been programming-related,
with plant managers constantly fine-tuning for optimal per
formance.
Similarly, no major future changes are slated for the non
ice-cube.
"There's a project to improve its capability to deliver
chilled water," said Reid.This would, he added, help the plant
meet energy demand for future buildings.
Visits to the Ice Plant are free and tours are given frequent
ly to energy clubs or by special request.
