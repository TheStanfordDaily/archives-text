## Agriculture Minister suicide exacerbates corruption scandal, rocks Japan's political system 
### PETER DURNING Peter Durning 
On Monday. Japanese Agriculture Minister
Toshikatsu Matsuoka became the first cabinet
level official to take his own life since World
War II in an episode rocking the nation's polit
ical system.
Matsuoka, who hanged himself in his
Tokyo residence, was at the center of a corrup
tion scandal and under investigation for the
suspicious expenditures of his own office. The
late agriculture minister was also suspected of
wrongdoing because of his department's in
volvement in suspicious contracts that were
awarded to firms that were hired to build
roads throughout Japan. Accusations of bid
rigging in the awarding of these contracts have
grown into formal investigations of wrongdo
ing.
Matsuoka s suicide came mere hours before
he was to appear before Parliament to answer
questions and explain why he received several
large donations from some of the principal
companies contracted by the Agriculture Min
istry. Shinichi Yamazaki.a top executive of one
of these companies, also took his life on Tues
day, one day after Matsuoka. Yamazaki jumped
to his death from his condominium in Yoko
hama. near Tokyo.
In Japan, the bloody turn that the bid-rig
ging scandal has taken was met with a harsh
reaction. Public anger against the nine
month-old government of Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe intensified on Tuesday when re

ports emerged claiming that Matsuoka's at
tempts to come clean had been cut short by his
superiors. Abe firmly denied these rumors, but
the Japanese public seems to be maintaining
its disapproval of his performance in this af
fair.
Abe's actions, now falling under scrutiny, in
clude defending his agriculture minister
against allegations of misappropriating funds
— even though the ministry, housed in a build
ing with free rent and utilities are free, report
ed huge utility expenses.
Moreover, when the bid-rigging scandal
broke, Abe did not act quickly and forcefully.
According to the Asahi Shimbun, which at
tacked Abe for his handling of the situation,
this scandal goes deeper than basic political
corruption. It underlines the systemic problem
of how "bureaucrats landing cushy post-retire
ment jobs played a role in slicing up the public
works pie."
For Abe. the death of Matsuoka. who had
never before held a cabinet-level position
when he was appointed by Abe late last year,
transforms an uncomfortable scandal into a se
rious political crisis. Japanese pollsters attrib
ute a six percent drop in the popularity of Abe's
party to public dissatisfaction with the financial
scandals. Most believe the suicides will only ex
acerbate these effects. The elections for the
upper house of the Japanese parliament will
take place in July, and the shadows extending
from the Matsuoka scandals are threatening
the performance of the ruling Liberal Democ
ratic Party, which has dominated political life in

postwar Japan.
Even if the Liberal Democrats are able to
maintain their majority, it is unclear how exten
sively the Abe government's agenda will be re
shaped by the development of the financial
scandals and suicides. Some of Abe's major pri
orities have included the proposed removal of
restraints on the Japanese military through
constitutional amendments, and a more proac
tive role for Japan on the world stage. Since
these priorities were introduced as Abe took
the stage late last year, most have questioned
whether he could find the political might to re
alize this agenda.
After July, the question may no longer
apply. Tomoaki Iwai, who teaches politics at
Tokyo's Nihon University, sees the upcoming
elections as a matter of political life or death for
Shinzo Abe.

"Mr. Abe was made prime minis
ter because he was someone seen

as being able to win elections,
Professor Iwai told The New

York Times. "If he loses,
then he's of no use to the

party anymore
