For Betsy, it's been four volumes. Four? Man. that's even longer than Tarn. For Brendan, it's been
V three. Respectable. That's still longer than Tam, if you don't count her last volume (Sam and

Children Write In ones there).
B bH So what have these years at The Daily all added up to? Not much, at least if you look at it on the
■ fAMpiK ■ surface. Some gummi bears on the ceiling (as well as few on the wall in more recent years). The dis

■ Stanford Endings pinot and merlot bottles strewn about. (Oh yeah, and real wine glasses.) Epic Daily banquets, com
■ Class Stalker plete with hikes to the Dish, Compadres and a few other assorted things that we're sure would bore
you to tears so we won't bother to recount them here. Ethiopian food. Jules R. Penguin. A certain
former writer of ours that hates us so much. Rice Krispies treats golf. Canada. And Seattle. Plus that
TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL Vegoose thing and a bug-infested HoJo hotel, ln-n- t every Thursday. Intermission owning The
Betsy Congdon Daily. The occasional round at the Stanford course. DC (twice!). Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Dherb's
Brendan Marten disgustingly dirty fridge with that sour cream from back in September. 24/7 electronica. Girl Talk
concerts where speakers randomly stop functioning. Fences that are rather damaging to one's cloth
__ D |*i •£ ing. The birth (and death) of Monday Mayhem. Garage sales in White Plaza. Intermission's seces
sion movement. Commumission. Lenin walking the plank. A real-life treasure hunt. The loft we (al

I Natalie Justicz and not feeling bad about it. Bringing the party to Thursdays. Our tight cubicle with that couch we
I stole from the newsroom way back in the day. Bizarro Intermission. Washington, Washington,
