## Charges not likely for Azia Kim unlikely to pay restitution, face jail time for imposter scam 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford imposter Azia Kim may get off easi
er than many have expected, despite national
coverage of her eight-month masquerade as a
Stanford student. Neither law enforcement agen
cies nor the University is planning to take action
against Kim. rendering restitution penalties or
criminal charges for the 18-year-old Long Beach
native unlikely.
In the only confirmed investigation into the
matter. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman appointed Associate Dean of Stu
dents Chris Griffith to identify where the Univer
sity's system of identifying enrolled students is
lacking.
The scope of that investigation, however, does
not extend to bringing charges against Kim, and
Griffith said that she has "not been asked to ad
dress the issue of restitution."
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's
Office, which would ultimately decide whether to

bring Kim to court, also said that it is unlikely that
any criminal charges would materialize.
"I don't know if it ever will be [brought to our
attention]," said Assistant DA Dave Tomkins.
"We may never see this case."
Tomkins said the case would first have to be
referred to the DA by law enforcement officers.
But a spokesman for the Stanford Department of
Public Safety (DPS) said that he could not con
firm whether the department was pursuing an ac
tive investigation regarding Kim.
"1 don't know if we are pursuing a case or not,"
deputy Chris Colindale said."! haven't asked that
question."
The US. Army also seems uninterested in pun
ishing Kim for joining the Reserve Officers Train
ing Corp (ROTC) program at Santa Clara Uni
versity by posing as a Stanford student. She was
equipped with around $1,300 of military equip
ment and received dozens of hours in training
from military officers.
Army spokesman Robert Rosenburgh called
what Kim did in the ROTC "a harmless prank"
and said the Army would not try to punish her.
"In terms of any lawbreaking, fraud or wrong
doing, there is nothing to suggest that she broke
any kind of military regulations," Rosenburgh
told the Los Angeles Times. "Her instructors said

she was a good student and they had no reason to
suspect her."
Kim's roommate in Okada, Amy Zhou '08.
filed a report with the DPS after finding out that
Kim had broken into her email account, but the
police told her that all they could do was evict
Kim if she came back to campus.
Griffith, who became the interim director of
the Band after investigating last July's vandalism
at the group's Shak, said that the first steps of her
investigation will be to gather all the facts.
"I'll begin by meeting with people who are
likely to have the most information about her
time here at Stanford," Griffith said in an email to
The Daily, adding that she did not want to specu
late further on the direction of the investigation
in its early stages.
A majority of 40 students interviewed by The
Daily TUesday said they think Kim should have to
pay restitution. According to official Stanford
Housing policy, unauthorized visitors can be
charged $175 per day, bringing Kim's eight
month liability up to $42,000 â€” if the University
were to press the issue.
