## Army grant sparks letter, concerns 65 faculty petition, cite secrecy, worries about military link 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
A group of 65 faculty members have banded
together to protest the $105 million grant for the
multi-institution U.S. Army High-Performance
Computing Research Center (Al IPCRC), which
will be managed by Stanford. A letter signed by
the faculty who oppose the grant pushes for the
release of documents related to the grant and ad
vocates for an open dialogue about the ethics of
receiving military funding.
The AHPCRC — whose research projects
will commence today — has a 17-year history,
and its headquarters moved to Stanford this year.
The grant, which came through in April, is re
newed over five-year periods.The Center will be
led by Mechanical Engineering Prof. Charbel
Farhat.
I"he letter was submitted to Faculty Senate
Chair Sheri Sheppard, Committee on Research
Chair Bernd Girod. Academic Secretary Edward
Harris and Dean of Research Ann Arvin. A copy
appears in today's Daily Opinions section [see
page 4].
The Letter's Aims
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth,

who was involved in pushing the petition,said the
Engineering School receives considerable fund
ing from the Department of Defense (DoD),es
timating that more than half of the school's fund
ing comes from the military.
But Roth said he opposed this particular grant
and, as a result, circulated the letter on a mailing
list of professors who opposed the war in Iraq.
"Stanford does a lot of research with DoD
money so that's not new," he said. "What's new is
the sheer size of it, and it's kind of overreaching."
Roth said the Committee on Research, a body
within the Faculty Senate, will look at the letter
and discern if University research rules were vio
lated in accepting the grant. He said he hopes the
concerns raised by the letter will be addressed by
the Faculty Senate at an upcoming meeting.
Roth also complained that the grant allows an
army member ultimate veto power over research
projects. He complained that the University was
"essentially giving up autonomy to an army func
tionary."
"If it's not legally done, then it should be un
done," he said. "They should renegotiate or abro
gate the contract. We've just seen the request for
the proposal. If that's how the proposal went in.
then 1 think it's in violation of the University
rules."
Computer Science Prof. Terry Winograd said
the letter pushes researchers to evaluate the
ethics of their work.
"I believe that people in all kinds of pursuits,
including technical and scientific research," he

said, "need to participate in open discussion of
the underlying values and implications of their
work."
The Center's Reaction
Farhat said the research is not sensitive or clas
sified, adding that he supports releasing the pro
posal.
"Nobody talked to me, with the exception of
one colleague who asked very casually if I could
give him a copy of the proposal," he said. "1 told
him this is a proposal that involves multiple insti
tutions. 1 didn't feel comfortable that 1 could
make the decision of taking the proposals that
contain private information of people given that
we have partners outside Stanford."
"Why don't they wait six months and make a
petition based on evidence," he added. "1 was
caught by surprise. Nobody was given a chance."
Farhat said he was disappointed that his col
leagues would rush to judge the ethics of those
who authored the grant.
"This is not a proposal that came out of the
blue involving one or two faculty," he said. "This
was a proposal written to respond to an initiative
that has been for 17 years. It was written by 17 fac
ulty. I'm surprised that anyone at Stanford would
think that the 17 faculty — why would anyone
think that they care less about academic free
dom?"
The University's Reaction
Several people who received the
letter yesterday said they were unfa
miliar with the petition. Arvin said
that she could not comment on the let
ter without talking to its supporters.
"1 am not in a position to com
ment about the petition without any
information about the source," she
said. "1 presume that those who are
circulating it have a plan for how to
bring it forward."
Senior Assistant to the President
Jeff Wachtel echoed Arvin's senti
ment. He said that President Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D.'B2 have yet to see the petition.
"It would be premature to com
ment directly on the substantive mat
ters raised in the copy of the peti
tion." he said."We can state generally
that the argument advanced is a polit
ical one that people are free to raise.
1 lowever. it is a cherished principle of
academic freedom that our faculty

make decisions about the funding
they seek to support their research."
Wachtel drew a parallel to this
month's debate over a failed resolu
tion regarding University-sponsored
research funded by the tobacco in
dustry.
"The Faculty Senate just took up
the issue about tobacco," he said,
"and again there was an issue about
the faculty's right to select, academic
freedom and the right to research as
long as they meet the other policies
regarding conflicts of interest."
Girod noted, however, that in
light of the tobacco-funding debate,
the Committee on Research is cur
rently proposing an extension of cur
rent research principles.
"As a consequence of [this
month's tobacco] discussion, there
were others who said we should real
ly make it clear in our principles of
research that professional ethics
should play a role in selecting the
sources of your funding," he said.

"It's in the realm of individual re
sponsibility."
Faculty Senate Chair Sheri Shep
pard said the petition would likely
not make it to the Faculty Senate this
year.
"We're kind of running up against
the end of the school year." she said.
"We have two more Senate meetings
and the agenda for this Iliursday is
totally booked and then we have a
meeting on the 14th "
She said that the petition will first
have to be evaluated by the Commit
tee on Research and that researchers
are the only ones who have seen the
details of the grant.
"To have any sort of discussion
with depth, [the petition] would have
to first go to the committee on re
search, and they work with Ann
Arvin." she said. "There has to be
some fact finding."
