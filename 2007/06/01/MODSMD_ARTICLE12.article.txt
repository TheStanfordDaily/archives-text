## Campus facelift expected, GSB may relocate Faculty Senate talks budget, Med School smoking ban 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
Jordan Quad and the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) may soon have new homes, if all
goes according to University architect David
Lennox's 20-year-plan. Lennox unveiled his pro
jections for campus architectural additions and
alterations at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
He said that he planned to work largely from
the guidelines of the Olmsted Plan, the original
19th century design for the University.
"At the turn of the century, we realized we had
kind of strayed from (the Olmsted plan] and we
wanted to try to get back to that plan," Lennox
said.
He explained that future architectural
changes will largely be made in deference to the
original concept of an east-west axis aligned
down the center of campus.
He said Jordan Quad will likely be replaced
with another quad nearer to the axis and that

the GSB may be moved to the end of Serra
Street. He added that various Medical School
buildings might be extensively renovated to
give the University a stronger aesthetic sense
of unity.
"We have to be careful that we don't just be
come a series of insular villages," Lennox said.
The architect also said that some administra
tive offices could be moved to new buildings lo
cated on University-owned land in Redwood
City. Lennox called himself and his associates
"caretakers of a legacy" laid down in the original
designs for the University.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 also re
vealed his budget report for the 2(X)7-2008 aca
demic year at last nights meeting. He was opti
mistic about the University's financial situation
and projected a surplus of $59 million for the
coming year.
"I think the University is stronger academical
ly than it has ever been, and its doing very well fi
nancially," Etchemendy said. "On the fiscal side,
it's due largely to investment returns."
The provost also addressed the need to keep
salaries for professors high in order to retain top
faculty members. He also discussed the Universi
ty's commitment to providing additional scholar

ships for both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
Though Etchemendy's analysis of next year's
financial prospects was generally positive, he also
stated that the future is "not all rosy." He pointed
to the concern among school officials about de
clining research revenues across departments.
Once the school's leading source of revenue,
funding from University-conducted research has
been surpassed by returns from business invest
ments in the last few years.
Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo also
touched on the failure of a resolution at the May
17 Faculty Senate meeting that would have
barred tobacco companies from funding Univer
sity-sponsored research. He suggested that the
Medical School could institute a smoking ban in
the vicinity of its buildings.
Pizzo did add, however, that the Medical
School would not take its own measures to sup
port a ban on tobacco-funded research.
"We've worked very hard to be a single Uni
versity.' he said, "and 1 think we should remain a
single University."
