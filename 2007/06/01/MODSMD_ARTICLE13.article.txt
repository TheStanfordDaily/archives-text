## Postmodern plays grace the Stanford stage 
### RUTH McCANN DAILY COLUMNIST 
Seven postmodern plays made their fittingly
postmodern debut in the lobby of Margaret
Jacks Hall last night. Audience members were
seated inside the performance space and were, at
times, just inches away from the actors, who
wielded daggers, glitter and. occasionally, Oreos.
The seven plays, directed and produced by
PWR 2 instructor and English department lee

turer Kevin DiPirro.are a part of the nation-wide
premiere of Suzan-Lori Parks' "365 Days/365
Playswhich is making its debut this year at sev
eral "networks" of universities and theaters
worldwide.
Parks began writing "365 Days/365 Plays" just
months after she became the first black woman
to win a Pulitzer prize for her two-man play.
"Topdog/Underdog." In order to complete
"365," Parks wrote a short play between one and
five pages each day for an entire year, from No

vemher 13.2(X)2 to November 12.2003.
Under the guidance of DiPirro, Stanford
tackled Week 29 of Parks' work as part of the
Bay Area network premiere of "365." The Bay
Area premiere was coordinated by a number of
local theatrical organizations, including Z Space
Studio, which initially approached DiPirro about
hosting a week at Stanford. DiPirro decided to
take on Week 29 in order to coordinate the debut
with week 9 of the Spring quarter,
which allowed him to involve past
and present students from his PWR
2 course. Family Drama.
After using the Week 29 plays as
a teaching model during the first
week of the quarter. DiPirro recruit
ed interested students to work on
the plays outside of class. As both di
rector and producer. DiPirro pulled
together the shows in the lobby of
Margaret Jacks using a group of five
talented student actors.
On Thursday night. DiPirro's
production filled the lobby of Mar
garet Jacks to the brim, making use
of every available space, including
the walls, balcony, staircase and ele
vator. The plays began with a stun
ning entrance by a feather-clad
Emily Davis '09, who emerged from
the elevator and proclaimed, "I am
El Fenix!"
The plays proceeded in a similar
ly zany, self-conscious fashion, filling
a half-hour with unabashedly physi
cal comedy and tragedy, punctuated
by dialogue that was brief, but inci
sive. Drawing from Parks' elaborate
stage directions, DiPirro made some
bold choices of his own, integrating
clunky props into the product' >n
and creating a uniform aestliL ic
that was certainly in line with the
mood of the plays.
One of the standouts of the
evening was play number three,
"The War to End All Wars Is Almost
Over." featuring Davis and Zach
Chotzen-Freund '09. The only spo

ken line was an in-unison "Whew."
The rest of the scene featured the
two. obviously a couple, making oc
casional painful eye contact be
tween bouts of seemingly self-in
duced pain. While Davis' pain was
clearly turned inward. Chotzen-Fre
und's own angst was displayed bodi
ly in a tremendous demonstration of
his capacity as a physical actor. Both
performances achieved palpable re
actions from the audience.
The other highlights of the pro
duction. "Red Blanket" and"The
Script." also featured largely physi
cal blocking, which DiPirro focused
on extensively during the rehearsal
process. DiPirro even stepped on
stage during "Red Blanket" to per
form alongside Chotzen-Freund in a
physically explosive scene, in which
DiPirro was mock-strangled before
a blanket-bearing dove arrived from
the heavens.
Needless to say. the pieces, which
DiPirro described as displaying
"typical Suzan-Lori Parks hyper-re
alism." aren't exactly straightfor
ward. but several apparent themes
strung them together. Unlike post
modernist blather that leaves the
viewer confused, these works were
carefully crafted, well-aimed post
modernism that left the audience af
fected. DiPirro observed that the
theme of authorship was heavy
throughout the plays of Week 29.
"One theme seems to be the rela
tionship between the writer and the
creation, how they take place in
one's head and how they take form
in the script,"said DiPirro."Another
theme is violence and struggle, both
creative struggle and pragmatic,
quotidian struggle."
The first play, "El Fenix," fea

tured a character named Writer,
who edited a script for one of her
characters, thus drastically changing
the audience response. DiPirro
chose to keep the Writer character
onstage for the entire production in
order to highlight Parks' own tangi
ble involvement in the plays.
Not only was Parks tangibly in
volved. but the audience and by
standers were as well. Thanks to the
intimacy of the space, passersby be
came part of the show, including a
man on a bicycle who arrived in the
elevator during the middle of the
show, and a few confused undergrads
who stumbled over audience mem
bers. ITie actors also became involved
with the audience, handing out ()reos
on a platter during one scene and act
ing out physical violence on a bench
where audience members were sit
ting during another.
"The audience is so much a part
of the show." said Davis. '"There
can't be a fourth wall."
The premiere of "365" is in
process in several global "net
works." including a United King
dom network, a Bay Area network,
and a University network. Within
each of these networks, various the
atres and communities sign up to
perform an entire week of the play.
Parks specified no particular order
for the plays, but most networks
have chosen to perform the weeks in
order from one to 52. The premieres
will conclude by November 12 of
this year.

Week 29 of 365 Days/365 Plays
will run again at 7p.m. on June I ami
2 in the lobby of Margaret Jacks and
at 12:30 p.m. on June I in the rear
courtyard of Margaret Jacks.
