## TB passenger travels abroad despite warnings 
### GREG BLUESTEIN DEVLIN BAR ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ATLANTA — A globe-trotting
Atlanta lawyer with a dangerous
strain of tuberculosis was allowed
back into the U.S. by a border in
spector who disregarded a computer
warning to stop him and don protec
tive gear, officials said Thursday.
The inspector has been removed
from border duty.
The unidentified inspector ex
plained that he was no doctor but
that the infected man seemed per
fectly healthy and that he thought
the warning was merely "•discre
tionary." officials briefed on the case
told The Associated Press. They
spoke on condition of anonymity
because the matter is still under in
vestigation.
The patient was identified as An
drew Speaker, a 31 -year-old person
al injury lawyer who returned last
week from his wedding and honey
moon trip through Italy, the Greek
isles and other spots in Europe. I lis
new father-in-law. Robert C. Cook
sev. is a CDC' microbiologist whose
specialty is I Band other bacteria.

Cooksey would not comment on
whether he reported his son-in-law
to federal health authorities. Nor did
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention explain how the case
came to their attention. However.
Cooksey said that neither he nor his
CDC laboratory was the source of
his son-in-law's TB.
Speaker is now under quarantine
at a hospital in Denver. I le is the first
infected person to be quarantined
by the U.S. government since 1%3.
The disclosure that the patient is
a lawyer — and specifically a per
sonal injury lawyer —outraged
many people on the Internet and
elsewhere. Some travelers who flew
on the same planes with Speaker an
grily accused him of selfishly putting
hundreds of people's lives in danger.
"It's still very scary," 21-year-old
Laney Wiggins, one of more than
two dozen University of South Car
olina-Aiken students who are get
ting skin tests for TB. "That is an out
rageous number of people that he
was very reckless with their health.
It's not fair. It's selfish."
Speaker said in an interview with
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
that he knew he had TB when he

flew from Atlanta to Europe in mid-
May for his wedding and honey
moon. but that he did not find out
until he was already in Rome that it
was an extensively drug-resistant
strain considered especially danger
ous.
On its Web site. ABC said "Good
Morning America" planned to air an
interview Friday morning in which
Speaker says he has a tape recording
of a meeting with health officials
that he claims will confirm his view
that it was all right to travel in his
condition. He also asks for forgive
ness from other passengers, ABC
said.
Despite warnings from federal
health officials not to board anothei
long flight, he flew home for treat
ment. fearing he wouldn't survive if
he didn't reach the U.S.. he told the
Atlanta paper. He said he tried to
sneak home by way of Canada in
stead of flying directly into the U.S.
He was quarantined May 25. a
day after he was allowed to pass
through the border crossing at
Champlain, N.Y.. along the Canadi
an border.
The inspector ran Speaker's pass
port through a computer, and a

warning — including instructions to
hold the traveler, don a protective
mask in dealing with him, and tele
phone health authorities popped
up, officials said. About a minute
later. Speaker was instead cleared to
continue on hisjourney,according to
officials familiar with the records.
The Homeland Security Depart
ment is investigating.
The border officer "who ques
tioned that person is at present per
forming administrative duties," said
Homeland Security spokesman
Russ knocke,adding that the officer
is not checking people at the land
border crossing.
Colleen kelley. president of the
union that represents customs and
border agents, declined to comment
on the specifics of the case, but said
"public health issues were not re
ceiving adequate attention and
training" within the agency.
On Thursday, a tan and healthy
looking Speaker was flown from At
lanta to Denver, accompanied by his
wife and federal marshals, to Den
ver's National Jewish Medical and
Research Center, where doctors
planned to isolate him and treat him
with oral and intravenous antibiotics.
