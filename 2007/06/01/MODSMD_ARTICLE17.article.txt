## Editorial Board Nobels' funding fight crucial 
### 
Of the whirlwind of events, lectures
and celebrations that accompany
Nobel Prize winners, few have been
more important than recent testimony by
Stanford's Andrew Fire and Roger Rom
berg before the Senate Committee on Com
merce. Science and Technology. As part of
the most recent cohort of Nobel laureates in
the sciences. F ire and Romberg traveled last
month to Washington to support more fund
ing for scientific research. Fire and Rom
berg are to be commended for their advoca
cy on behalf of the nation's scientific com
munity.
The efforts of the University's Nobel duo
come at a critical juncture in the history of
federal backing for scientific research.
Funding for organizations such as the Na

tional Institutes of Health has fallen in re
cent years, while Iraq war appropriations
continue to consume much of the federal
budget. Although there seems to be biparti
san agreement that additional funding for
scientific research is needed, the testimony
of Fire and Rornburg may have given a
much-needed nudge to lawmakers sitting
on the fence.
A Nobel Prize bestows on its recipient
tremendous honor and recognition, which
in turn confer visible credibility. It is inspir
ing to see Stanford's Nobel tandem harness
this authority toward a strong cause. Al
though Congress has largely settled on a
budget for the 2008 fiscal year, lawmakers
would do well in future years to heed the ad
vice of Fire and Romberg.
