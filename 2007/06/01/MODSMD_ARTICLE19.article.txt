# Hello goodbye
## 
### 
I have never liked goodbyes. In fact. I
think it's safe to say I've spent much of
my life avoiding them whenever possi
ble.
To put it in a Freudian nutshell, first there
were my two amazing but hard-working
parents who usually left early and came
home late. Then there was the revolving
door set of babysitters, most deeply beloved,
a few less so (for one particularly privileged
individual, my brother and 1 staged an elab
orate performance of the age-old stadium
chant. "Na-na-na-na. na-na-na-na. hey, hey,
goodbye" — during her first month of em
ployment). Finally, there were two cross
country moves before the age of 14 and a
half-brother who only spent summers and
occasional winter holidays with us.
In any event, long before I walked semi
wackily and entirely hungover into Stanford
Stadium in June 2004,1 was painfully accus
tomed to the emotional upheaval of
farewell. Like many Stanford ducklings, I at
tempted to ward off the inevitable by apply
ing to coterm. But, given that I'd found and
taken a teaching job in the area, I wasn't
sure whether I would, in fact, return to com
plete my second degree. And even if I did
choose to come back (which, this year, I
did), 1 knew virtually none of my friends
would be on campus, let alone within rea
sonable driving distance.
With my closest friends leaving the area,
the state, even the country. I reassured my
self that many young alums cut the cord sim
ply to crawl to San Francisco (where Face
book tells me roughly one third of my Stan
ford network resides), and a good number
toddle their way down Palni Drive for a job
or degree number two. In case you haven't

used the CDC this year, employment oppor
tunities abound on campus, from the Alum
ni Association (someone has to mail all of
the carefully written Stanford Fund letters)
to the Admissions Office (someone, or
rather, many someones, has to read all of the
equally carefully written application es
says). For those who are so inclined, there's
also a law school, a med school and a busi
ness school, not to mention a select number
of departments that will take their own un
dergrads (case in point — my friend Moe,
who stayed at Stanford for over a decade,
completing a BS. a BA. an MS and a Ph.D.
By the time he left in 2004. he'd worn down
the sandstone of his favorite seat on the
Quad planters).
But even those who stick around or
choose to come back in some new incarna
tion must meet the harsh reality. Back in
June 2004, as I sat among my equally hun
gover fellow graduates, watching one of our
still-drunk classmates wander aimlessly
about — during Sandra Day O'Connor's
speech, no less— I realized: college comes
with an expiration date. If and when you
choose to return to campus, the buildings,
with the exception of the Bridge and its up-

rooted neighbors, will reassuringly
be located right where you left them.
Give or take a new coat or paint or
two, they will look mostly the same.
ITie increasingly younger kids walk
ing in and out of them will not.
Cheesy though it may sound, the
people are what make your four
years at Stanford unique and worth
while. Just ask Azia Kim. Psycholog
ical disturbances and financial issues
aside, there's a good reason she
worked hard to live on campus in a
dorm; even from the outside, it's
clear that the Stanford experience is
defined by relationships, not simply
academic courses. Much of the de
bate and online discussion about
Azia's unfolding story has pointed
fingers at either the administration
or the students (how could they let
this happen/be this gullible/not catch
on sooner?). The answer to all the
questions is, in my opinion, because
Stanford is the amazing place that it
is. Sure, we could all stand to be a lit
tle more in touch with non-Stanford
reality at times, but I'll take trust,
caring and a willingness to help oth
ers over doubt and selfishness any

ing: there's no reason to rush into its
less-than-generous arms.
In my experience,goodbye usual
ly comes with a loss of material
goods. But for everything graduation
forces you to leave behind — your
PO Box (16623), your SUNet II)
(lisame), your blissful ignorance
about paying utilities and evil land
lords — there are more than a few
prize possessions you get to take
with you. Your SUII) number
(04847828) is yours for life. Same
with all those t-shuts you acquired
over years of cxtracurriculars. And.
if you join fast enough/have a unique
enough moniker, you can preserve
your SUNet ID by translating it into
your alumni email address
(lisame@stanfordalumni.org).
Speaking of that SUNet II). even
now, three years after that blistering
hot day when "Pomp and Circum
stance" made me cry for the
umpteenth time that week,a handful
of people still call me by mine. Every
time I pick up the phone to hear
"LisaMe," I'm reminded that, no
matter how far away my friends may
be or how long we go without seeing
one another, there is, thankfully, no
need to say goodbye to the best part
of Stanford.

Email lisame@stanford.edu before
December, when her SUNet ID disap
pears for good.
