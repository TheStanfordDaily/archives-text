# Hello goodbye
## 
### 
I have never liked goodbyes. In fact. I
think it's safe to say I've spent much of
my life avoiding them whenever possi
ble.
To put it in a Freudian nutshell, first there
were my two amazing but hard-working
parents who usually left early and came
home late. Then there was the revolving
door set of babysitters, most deeply beloved,
a few less so (for one particularly privileged
individual, my brother and 1 staged an elab
orate performance of the age-old stadium
chant. "Na-na-na-na. na-na-na-na. hey, hey,
goodbye" — during her first month of em
ployment). Finally, there were two cross
country moves before the age of 14 and a
half-brother who only spent summers and
occasional winter holidays with us.
In any event, long before I walked semi
wackily and entirely hungover into Stanford
Stadium in June 2004,1 was painfully accus
tomed to the emotional upheaval of
farewell. Like many Stanford ducklings, I at
tempted to ward off the inevitable by apply
ing to coterm. But, given that I'd found and
taken a teaching job in the area, I wasn't
sure whether I would, in fact, return to com
plete my second degree. And even if I did
choose to come back (which, this year, I
did), 1 knew virtually none of my friends
would be on campus, let alone within rea
sonable driving distance.
With my closest friends leaving the area,
the state, even the country. I reassured my
self that many young alums cut the cord sim
ply to crawl to San Francisco (where Face
book tells me roughly one third of my Stan
ford network resides), and a good number
toddle their way down Palni Drive for a job
or degree number two. In case you haven't

used the CDC this year, employment oppor
tunities abound on campus, from the Alum
ni Association (someone has to mail all of
the carefully written Stanford Fund letters)
to the Admissions Office (someone, or
rather, many someones, has to read all of the
equally carefully written application es
says). For those who are so inclined, there's
also a law school, a med school and a busi
ness school, not to mention a select number
of departments that will take their own un
dergrads (case in point — my friend Moe,
who stayed at Stanford for over a decade,
completing a BS. a BA. an MS and a Ph.D.
By the time he left in 2004. he'd worn down
the sandstone of his favorite seat on the
Quad planters).
But even those who stick around or
choose to come back in some new incarna
tion must meet the harsh reality. Back in
June 2004, as I sat among my equally hun
gover fellow graduates, watching one of our
still-drunk classmates wander aimlessly
about — during Sandra Day O'Connor's
speech, no less— I realized: college comes
with an expiration date. If and when you
choose to return to campus, the buildings,
with the exception of the Bridge and its up-
