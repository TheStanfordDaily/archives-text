# Injuries strain Card athletes
## Athletes' drive to overcome pain leads to more injuries 
### ALLYSIA FINLEY 
Before coming to Stanford, fresh
man swimmer Caitlin Reynolds
trained about 24 hours a week, some
times practicing five hours with her
club team in the morning before com
peting in a high-school meet later that
afternoon. In her first months on the
Farm. Reynolds felt healthy and pre
pared for the 20-hours-a-week training
schedule.
'ITien the pain hit. After years of
overtraining, the tissue in her shoulder
had loosened enough that every stroke
triggered throbbing pain.
But even after seeing a trainer and
modifying her work-outs, Reynolds'
shoulder pain did not subside. In exam
ining her MRI, Stanford doctor Tim
McAdams recommended surgery to
remove the scar tissue and tighten up
the joint. Reynolds, however, decided
to tough-out the season. One week
after it ended, she underwent surgery,
and now she will spend the offseason
in recovery.
"Like most Stanford athletes," she
said,"l wanted to push myself to the
limits."
Stanford Athletics is the best in the
country year after year. And the re
cruits have already trained long and
hard for years by the time they arrive.
Most competed on club teams. Many
had private coaches. Some even had
their own entourage of nutritionists,
psychologists and personal trainers.
But despite all of the support —or
maybe even because of it — many ath
letes say they come to Stanford with an
increased risk for overuse injuries.
"While some bodies are able to
take more of a beating," Reynolds said,
"some people's bodies who did a lot in
high school just break down."
The push to succeed does not begin
the moment many first put on their
Cardinal uniform or attend their first
team training session. It begins when
they decide to get serious about their
sport, whether at age six or 1 b.
Stanford physicians do not release
statistics of athletic injuries, citing the

need to respect patient privacy, hut
many athletes have already had multi
ple surgeries to tweak common prob
lems, and their injuries are the price to
pay for competing at the college level.
Athletes in individual sports, like
swimming and gymnastics, usually
train even longer and harder to boost
their rankings. Freshman gymnast
Carly Janiga recalled that as early as
seventh grade she was leaving school
to train. In high school,she practiced 40

hours per week, three hours each
morning and four hours each after
noon. Because of their more intense
schedules, individual athletes say they
suffer more overuse injuries in college.
Freshman tennis player Lindsay
Burdette was the nation's top recruit
last year. However, before Lindsay
there was her older sister Erin, who
graduated from Stanford in 2(X)5. Dur
ing Erin's freshman and sophomore
years, she garnered All-American ac
colades and was primed to win even
more individual honors in her junior
year.
Then she hit a backhand and heard
a pop. Wrist surgery kept Erin from
competing at the ITA Indoor Champi
onships and Northwest Regional
Championships.
She sat out most of her senior year
with shoulder problems. Eyeing her
last shot at the NCAA Champi
onships. Erin opted for a quick fix — a
cortisone shot. Stanford went on to win
the NCAA team title, and Erin and
her teammate took home the doubles'
title. Though the cortisone shot tem
porarily eased Erin's pain, her shoul
der injury became worse as she contin
ued to play. Only after her senior year
did she finally undergo needed sur
gery.
"Erin deals with pain every day be
cause she actually needs another sur
gery," Lindsay Burdette said. "Her in
jury will affect her later. It's not really
the surgery. In some ways there isn't
much difference, but it's the abuse in
the first place that I would blame more
than the surgery."
Having practiced three to four
hours each day in high school. Lindsay,
too. has suffered her share of overuse
injuries. Like E:rin, she has experi
enced shoulder problems and under
gone wrist surgery.
"There definitely is a certain expec
tation to practice and work out." 1 .ind
say said.
Though the coaches try to accom
modate injured players with modified
drills. Lindsay said the trainers are usu
ally more sympathetic because they
know more about the physiological
problems that can result from tough
conditioning.
"The coaches just don't understand
how much a workout can [affect you.
injure you or help you] if it's done
right." she said. "For instance, we were
super sore and broken down from a re
ally intense series of workouts, and my
coach didn't seem to understand that
we were completely shot by the time
that we played USC.
"She was frustrated and kept
telling us to stretch." Burdette contin
ued. "I wanted to politely explain that
millions of micro tears in our bodies
weren't going to heal or stop emitting
lactic acid just by stretching them. It
doesn't work that way."
The most skilled doctors plus the
most experienced coaches plus the
most qualified trainers should equal
the strongest, healthiest college ath
lete. But there's one piece missing
from this equation that keeps it from

being true: the constant grind that ath
letes here force their bodies to endure,
week in and week out,year in and year
out.
Stanford's strict recruiting and se
lection process ensures that its athletes
are driven to succeed and will push
their bodies to the limit. This ethic
often causes athletes to ignore or belit
tle signs of pain.
According to physical therapist
Marc Guillet of Agile Physical Thera
py in Palo Alto, each athlete should
have to pass strict functional testing
criteria before training, "especially
when they are having pain." But Stan
ford has no strict functional testing cri
teria, and athletes are usually left to
determine for themselves whether
they can compete, or if they need help.
Many are reluctant to complain be
cause they do not want to sit out.
"It's definitely up to the individ
ual." Reynolds said. "If you can catch
yourself at the onset, you really need
to be persistent in getting help."
While Burdette and Reynolds
knew how to handle injuries, some in
coming athletes are less aware of the
process. Some managed to go injury
free throughout high school only to
develop painful conditions in college.
Freshman lacrosse player Charity
Fluharty played four years of high
school varsity basketball, soccer and
lacrosse before incurring severe knee
problems. It was only during the spring
of her senior year that she began to de
velop pain in her left knee, which an
MRI later showed was due to inflam
mation.
Last August, Fluharty underwent
surgery to remove scar tissue and
spent the fall offseason in physical
therapy. But right as she was ready to
gear up for the regular season, her
groin began troubling her. An MRI
showed inflammation of the pelvic
muscles. Stanford sports physician
Gordon Matheson referred the fresh
man to Arrillaga's physical therapy
unit. However, between physical ther
apy sessions, she continued her modi
fied workouts.
As she continued to train, the in
jury grew worse. While resting tem
porarily eased the pain, it would flare
up the moment she began training
again. She recalls that at one point it
hurt just to sit. Nevertheless. Fluharty

pushed herself through workouts be
cause of the "pressure to tough it out
with the team."
When the injury failed to improve
with time, her physical therapist re
quired her to take a break from all
physical activity After spring break,
Fluharty received a cortisone shot, and
she finally began exercising again just
one week ago.
"The coaches had said, 'Had we
known about how serious it was earli
er. we would have had you healthy by
now,' but they didn't take me seriously
when 1 was telling them I was in pain,"
Fluharty said. "It's really frustrating."
Stanford trainer Perry Archibald
suggested that the pressure to ignore
injuries comes on many fronts. Other
than the clear pressure from coaches,
he cited peer and self pressure as other
common sources. Archibald also
echoed that returning too soon from
an injury like Fluhartv's will often ex
acerbate the problem.
"Many times, when an athlete re
turns too early, he or she will only in
jure themselves worse," Archibald
said. "Usually, it will take many more
days to get the athlete better because
of returning too quickly."
Given Stanford athletes' strained
bodies and driven nature, trainers and
physical therapists are limited in their
treatment and prevention options.
Their role is usually reactive rather
than pro-active.
ITiey can perform the protective
taping. They can recommend a med
ical specialist. They can modify work
outs. However, they cannot help an
athlete who does not indicate in any
way that he or she is in pain. Doctors
cannot remove all the damaged mus
cle tissue.
Doing anything to stop any fiurther
overexertion would require drastically
truncated training schedules, which
coaches are both unlikely and unwill
ing to do. While benefiting from Stan
ford's first-rate coaching, training and
medical treatment, athletes pay a price.
Some will continue to pay it later in life.
"It's sad what we're doing to our
bodies, but at the same time, it's amaz
ing what we can push ourselves to do."
Reynolds said. "It's a weird trade-off."
