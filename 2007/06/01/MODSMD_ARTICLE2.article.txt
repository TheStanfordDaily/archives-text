# Injuries strain Card athletes
## Athletes' drive to overcome pain leads to more injuries

Before coming to Stanford, fresh
man swimmer Caitlin Reynolds
trained about 24 hours a week, some
times practicing five hours with her
club team in the morning before com
peting in a high-school meet later that
afternoon. In her first months on the
Farm. Reynolds felt healthy and pre
pared for the 20-hours-a-week training
schedule.
'ITien the pain hit. After years of
overtraining, the tissue in her shoulder
had loosened enough that every stroke
triggered throbbing pain.
But even after seeing a trainer and
modifying her work-outs, Reynolds'
shoulder pain did not subside. In exam
ining her MRI, Stanford doctor Tim
McAdams recommended surgery to
remove the scar tissue and tighten up
the joint. Reynolds, however, decided
to tough-out the season. One week
after it ended, she underwent surgery,
and now she will spend the offseason
in recovery.
"Like most Stanford athletes," she
said,"l wanted to push myself to the
limits."
Stanford Athletics is the best in the
country year after year. And the re
cruits have already trained long and
hard for years by the time they arrive.
Most competed on club teams. Many
had private coaches. Some even had
their own entourage of nutritionists,
psychologists and personal trainers.
But despite all of the support —or
maybe even because of it — many ath
letes say they come to Stanford with an
increased risk for overuse injuries.
"While some bodies are able to
take more of a beating," Reynolds said,
"some people's bodies who did a lot in
high school just break down."
The push to succeed does not begin
the moment many first put on their
Cardinal uniform or attend their first
team training session. It begins when
they decide to get serious about their
sport, whether at age six or 1 b.
Stanford physicians do not release
statistics of athletic injuries, citing the

need to respect patient privacy, hut
many athletes have already had multi
ple surgeries to tweak common prob
lems, and their injuries are the price to
pay for competing at the college level.
Athletes in individual sports, like
swimming and gymnastics, usually
train even longer and harder to boost
their rankings. Freshman gymnast
Carly Janiga recalled that as early as
seventh grade she was leaving school
to train. In high school,she practiced 40

hours per week, three hours each
morning and four hours each after
noon. Because of their more intense
schedules, individual athletes say they
suffer more overuse injuries in college.
Freshman tennis player Lindsay
Burdette was the nation's top recruit
last year. However, before Lindsay
there was her older sister Erin, who
graduated from Stanford in 2(X)5. Dur
ing Erin's freshman and sophomore
years, she garnered All-American ac
colades and was primed to win even
more individual honors in her junior
year.
Then she hit a backhand and heard
a pop. Wrist surgery kept Erin from
competing at the ITA Indoor Champi
onships and Northwest Regional
Championships.
She sat out most of her senior year
with shoulder problems. Eyeing her
last shot at the NCAA Champi
onships. Erin opted for a quick fix — a
cortisone shot. Stanford went on to win
