### 
St) I was at this graduation party for a
family friend the other day. just mind
ing my own business, nibbling some
pakoras. listening to the soft veena music in
the background, enjoying the gaudy rococo
decorations,ya know, the usual.
'ITien she walked in. I looked at her. She
looked at me. She looked away. 1 kept look
ing at her. I read her lips as she asked her
mom if I was still looking at her. (I was.)
After that, we didn't talk or in any way ac
knowledge each other's existence. What a
great first date! I was so full of life that I cut a
rug the rest of the night, talked up the room,
cleaned out the last call of Indian buffet and
went home with my parents at 9:30 p.m.
"Did you see that girl in the red
patavai?" 1 coyly asked in the car, as my fa
ther alternately yelled at me for driving
dreadfully slow and recklessly fast and my
mother braced herself lor imminent impact.
"You mean Padma?" my mom respond
ed, "Lalita's daughter? She sings so beauti
fully. Why don't you take up Karnatik
music? You'd make such a g00d..."
"Mom! Please, can you just tell me
about..."
"What is this musical theater thing you
do? Makes no sense to me. Anyway, what do
you want to know about her? She's your
cousin. Lalita's grandfather Vatsu and your
great-grandfather's second nephew on
Daddy's side..."
"Wow." I thought to myself as an odd feel
ing crept over me while my mother mapped
out our familial connection in gruesome de
tail;"! lad I just checked out my cousin?"The
facts were hard to dispute: I had.
At first I was a bit off-put by the thought,
but not entirely. I mean.basically every In
dian person is somehow my cousin, and
from what little I gleaned from the genealo
gy my mother laid out. it was possible that
no blood relation existed between us.
Was I just getting my kicks from concoct
ing a kooky Hollywood romance? Surely
our parents would never approve of such a
union, and neither would society. Although
our eternal love was etched in stone the sec
ond that I made eye contact with her (and
her mother), there would inevitably be
many unexpected obstacles to our unholy
union, in addition to many fantastically cho

reographed vocal numbers in which an au
gust ensemble would materialize out of thin
air. both of us would lip-sync and profes
sionals would do voice-overs.
No. there was a deeper reason for nurturing
these futile thoughts,one that in general makes
the conceptual exploration of the irrelevant
quite alluring when it comes to my love life. 1
think what appeals to me is that, as long as my
beautiful imaginations of a blissful future run
up against external barriers, such as an in
creased chance of children with Tay-Sachs,
being disowned by my family and becoming a
permanent pariah, I'm saved the hassle and
possible humiliation of taking action and. more
importantly, of having to deal with the collater
al consequences of those actions.
Let's be honest — actual relationships
can be pretty brutal and annoying. So if 1 can
keep myself content with garland-laden lol
lygagging and sambar-flavored fantasies, is
there any reason to get into the mess that is
the actuality of intimate human connection?
In spite of what I've read in all the self
help books (sorry Tony Robbins, the giant
within me is comatose), what Oprah would
tell me and what 1 myself acknowledge as
sound reasoning, I can't help but answer
that question in the negative. When/if the
time is right, my perspective changes or I'm
otherwise inspired to poke my head out of
my shell. I'd like to think that I'll do so. But
until then. I'll probably just pass the time
constructing dream worlds in which the girl
in the red patavai and I abscond from our
parents, throw off the shackles of modern
living and pass our days as humble but
happy subsistence farmers in the nether re
gions of the I limalayas.
