# No, I am not graduating
## 
### 
No, 1 am not graduating at the end of this
year. No, I am not walking. And no. I
don't feel bad about it. To answer any
and every question that inevitably accompa
nies these preliminary questions: No. no, no.
No.
"Do you feel like a failure?" No. I made a
choice to dive in. swim hard and explore every
nook and cranny of this University. I feel far
more secure in my decision than some other
people I know, people who will be going to top
law schools next year, people who will be work
ing at top consulting firms because they didn't
know what else to do with themselves. I feel far
more secure in my decision than some other
people 1 know who spent four years drudging
from one econ class to another, hating every
minute of their undergraduate experience.
I have majored in public policy. German
studies, urban studies,civil and environmental
engineering, interdisciplinary studies in the
humanities and architectural design. After all
of that. 1 will be graduating with a BS in sci
ence, technology and society and a minor in
German studies. After tasting the bounty of

every school at Stanford, I am confident in my
choice. It would have been nice to save some
cash and figure out my life's calling a bit soon
er. but I'll graduate supremely passionate
about my area of study. 1 low many people get
to say that?
"But isn't your family disappointed?" No. 1
come from a great family tradition of soul
searching path-finders. My father took eight
years to graduate from college. When he did.
he finished with a Masters, to boot. He then
went on to get the highest grade in eight of his
classes at the Stanford School of Medicine
(they don't actually rank their students).

Today, 30 years later, my father still loves med
icine.
My brother took seven years to graduate.
But when he did. he was at the top of his field
of study. He is also one of the most content and
brilliant people that 1 know â€” two qualities
that rarely go together. So, no. My family isn't
disappointed. They would have been disap
pointed if I had chosen a major my freshman
year, and stayed blindly devoted to it for four
years.
"Don't you want to move on?" No. From
what is there to move on? From Stanford?
From the Bay Area? There are people who
think that changing locations or jobs will
change their lives. 1 am not one of those people.
You change yourself. There is nothing about
going to grad school or working at Yahoo! that
inherently alters who you are as a person. It is
the experiences we accumulate, the things we
see and the people we meet, that challenge us
to change. A drastic shift in vocation or loca
tion is one way for a person to confront things
