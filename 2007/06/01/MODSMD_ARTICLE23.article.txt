The prodigal Provost stirs ire
I read Friday's front page article, "Condi
Hyes Return, But in What Role?" with grow
ing disbelief (May 25). Have the past six
years disappeared from the memory of Stan
ford officials? If so, here is a reminder: Con
doleezza Rice has served at the highest levels
of an administration many historians are call
ing the most disastrous in American history.
She was one of the architects of a war that
fractured a once-functioning society, created
a training ground for terrorists and has so tar
cost the lives of 3,345 American soldiers and
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Iraq nowhas
one of the highest death rates in the world for
children under five, two million Iraqis are
homeless and there is no end in sight.

Rice's record is not one of "mistakes were
made" but of outright dishonesty. She was a key
player in the campaign of lies Bush used to justi
fy invading a country that posed no threat to the
United States. She was a key player in the cam
paign of lies Bush used to justify invading a coun
try that posed no threat to the United States. She
referred to threats of a "mushroom cloud" and
claimed Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes in
order to make nuclear fuel, when it was known
that Saddam 1 lussein had no nuclear program.
She remained silent when President Bush re
peatedly linked Iraq to the l )/l 1 attacks and de
clared " Ihe I Jnited States does not condone tor
ture under any circumstances." despite over
whelming evidence to the contrary.
Given Rice's record.it seems inconceivable
that she should have a place on any university

campus. An academic community should make
room for a wide range of policies and opinions,
no matter how controversial. But integrity is an
essential element of scholarship, and there
should be no room for someone who is willing
to lie in defense of those policies and opinions.

A fair solution to shuttle funding
In yesterday's article "GSC offers only
half of expected funds for airport shuttle
service." I read that the GSC chose not to al
locate as much funding as undergrads hoped
