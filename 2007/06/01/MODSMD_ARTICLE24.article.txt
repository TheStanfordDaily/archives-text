## Troubling Defense grant may have strings 
### 
We write to express deep concern over
the recent announcement that Stan
ford University has been chosen to
lead the Army I ligh Performance Computing
Research Center (AHPCRC) consortium.
While we recognize that Stanford and its fac
ulty frequently receive money from various
wings of the Defense Department, the cur
rent grant strikes us as alarming, both because
of its enormous size ($lO5 million over five
years, with a likelihood of renewal for anoth
er five years) and because its terms seem to
suggest an unusually high level of collabora
tion and coordination with the military. It
concerns us that, at an institution committed
to the ideal of searching intellectual inquiry
and debate, the only substantive public dis
cussion of such a momentous grant has come
in the form of a brief presentation and a short

publicity release, the latter of which arguably
downplays the brute realities of the program
(Stanford Report. April 25, 2007). Attempts
to learn more about the grant have been
blocked by the University administration,
which has thus far refused to make public the
successful proposal submitted by the Consor
tium. It is in the spirit of free and open debate,
therefore, that we offer the current letter, de
signed as it is to provoke self-reflection and
further exploration of this grant's ethical,
practical and intellectual implications for
Stanford's future.
First, we maintain that acceptance of this
money necessitates a frank acknowledge
ment by the I Jniversity of the grant's purpose.
Stanford's publicity announcement empha
sized the potential spin-off technologies that
might come out of the new Consortium. Of

course, such spin-otfs sometimes do emerge
from military research, hut there is little ques
tion in this case that the research will focus on
direct military applications. For example, the
publicity release touted new materials to "en
hance the agility" of army vehicles and per
sonnel. newer and better body armor, light
weight "surveillance drones that a soldier
could literally carry and launch from his or
her uniform" and more sensitive technologies
for detecting chemical or biological agents.
All of these possibilities were described in an
tiseptic terms, emphasizing both their defen
sive nature and their impressive technical
complexity. The government Program An
nouncement (PA) that first solicited propos
als is more transparent, openly declaring that
the new systems designed by the
computing center should be "highly
mobile,deployable,lethal and surviv
able," enabling "a significant increase
in combat effectiveness" (PA, 7).The
point here is that the fundamental
goal of this grant is to create more ef
ficient and, ultimately, more lethal
methods of waging war. Whether
such direct and applied research is
appropriate to the mandate of a mod
ern research university is a very grave
question, but it is a question that can
not even be discussed until we hon
estly and openly admit the nature of
the enterprise.
We fully accept that faculty must
be free to pursue their research inde
pendent of outside interference and
that research projects should not be
subjected to unwarranted political or
moral tests. Yet even within this
framework, we all recognize that
some forms of research may still be
unwise or even unacceptable. The
University clearly recognizes as
much in the rigorous oversight proce
dures it has implemented for certain
forms of inquiry, most notably re
search involving human subjects.
While we wholly endorse fundamen
tal principles of academic freedom, it
seems reasonable to draw attention
to an ethical regime that imposes
careful strictures on even very in
nocuous forms of human-subject re
search (those involving, for instance,
interviews or surveys) but which ap
plies no scrutiny to a huge, long-term
project aimed at enhancing the de
structive capacities of the military.
Nor should there be any doubt
that this grant implies an exception
ally close measure of collaboration
with the military. "Macro level guid
ance" of the program will come from
a steering board, comprised entirely
of representatives from the army. At
the "micro" level, the specific re
search agenda of the center will be
"jointly" determined by the director
of the Consortium (now a Stanford
faculty member) and the army's own
agent, the "Collaborative Alliance
Manager"(PA,29-30). While the Pro
gram Announcement describes the
center's proposed activities as "basic
research," the line between "basic
and "applied" military research is
hopelessly blurred here: the "objec
tive of the basic research efforts" in
cludes "conducting research in col
laboration with Army scientists to ac
celerate the infusion of new tech
nologies in support of Army Irans

formation," to "provide for the mutu
al exchange of researchers between
the Army and the AHPCRC to facil
itate the execution of joint research,"
and "to facilitate [a] transition of new
technologies emerging as a result of
this program to Army Laboratories
and Army Development Centers"
(PA, 4). Indeed, so close and coordi
nated is the proposed relationship
between the computer center and the
military that the grant includes as one
its central provisions funding for the
existence of 11 standing "staff scien
tists." These scientists provide a key
link between the Army and the Stan
ford-led Consortium. Their role is to
engage in research alongside our own
academics, "to act as a liaison" be
tween the center and the Army in
order quickly and efficiently to "tran
sition" the fruits of this research to
Army research labs and "to provide
input to the Consortium members on
various research thrusts at Army
Sites." presumably to ensure that the
research conducted at the center is
closely harmonized with existing
Army needs and projects (PA, 13-15).
In fact, the structure of this grant
seems to suggest an extraordinarily
high degree of coordination, collabo
ration, feedback and joint endeavor
between Stanford (and its Consor
tium partners) and the Army, all with
a view toward providing clear solu
tions to immediate military problems
(or, as the PA puts it. to provide a
"high near-term pay-off for the
Army" [PA. 7]).
Indeed, the nature of the grant
raises serious concerns that the pro
posed collaboration is so intimate
that it may in certain respects run up
against the limits of Stanford's own
rules governing research conduct.
Most seriously, the power of the
Army's manager (CAM) in deter
mining the research agenda of the
center appears to constitute a form of
veto power that seems to contradict
the University's own guidelines con
cerning faculty independence. In ad
dition, questions remain as to
whether the program violates Stan
ford rules forbidding secret, non-dis
closable research. These rules were
established during the Vietnam era
when it became clear that classified
military research was taking place at
Stanford. Then, as now, such classi
fied research was considered inimical
to the fundamental goals of open,
shared inquiry which lie at the heart
of the mission of a university in a free
society. Worryingly, however, the
present grant stipulates that the 11
staff scientists, at least three of whom
may be based at the Stanford/NASA
center, and all of whom will theoreti
cally be working under the umbrella

of the Stanford-led Consortium,
"must be U.S. citizens... capable of ac
quiring secret clearances" (PA. 13).
Likewise, one of the member institu
tions of the Consortium will be "re
quired to maintain a secret facility
clearance and will be able to secure
approval for the storage of SECRET
information" in accordance with de
fense department security regula
tions (PA. 21 ). In the absence of more
detailed information about the final
disposition of the grant, it is difficult
to know exactly what this stipulation
means (particularly since the precise
DoD regulations are themselves im
possible to access from the Web with
out a password). But the allusions to
secret security clearances and the ex
plicit suggestion that some of the ma
terial being researched or handled at
the center will be secret are more
than enough to raise serious ques
tions as to whether certain provisions
of this program violate the spirit, and
perhaps the letter, of Stanford's own
injunctions against secret and classi
fied research. Moreover, the provi
sion that staff scientists (several of
whom may be at the Stanford site,
and all of whom are described as inte
gral to the research program) must
be U.S. citizens would also appear to
be contrary to University guidelines,
which mandate that "Stanford shall
not enter into any research agree
ments which permit discrimination
on the basis of citizenship against in
dividuals engaged in the proposed re
search activities on campus." The in
tegrity of the I Jniversity would seem
to be threatened if these apparent
conflicts go unacknowledged and un
resolved.
Also of considerable concern is
the "outreach" provision of the grant
which, according to the Stanford
publicity release, "will work with
nearby school teachers to augment
their efforts to teach math, science,
engineering and computing," and will
"work closely with Stanford's Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth, a dis
tance-learning program that has
served S().(HX) talented students in 35
countries." On the surface, this pro
gram seems entirely unobjection
able. Who, after all, opposes im
proved education in math and sci
ence? Again, however, close scrutiny
of the Program Announcement rais
es serious questions about whether
this is a transparent grant, with no
strings attached, designed simply to
enhance learning across the board.
The announcement calls for the cre
ation of a multi-tiered structure of
summer programs: a high school
teacher symposium; a pair of two
week programs to teach high-school
ers basic computer skills (with at least

one of them conducted at a histori
cally black or minority member of
the Consortium); and a more elabo
rate nine-week program for under
graduates and gifted high school stu
dents to be conducted at or near
Stanford, in which students will be
immersed in more complex program
ming techniques. This more sophisti
cated summer program will be coor
dinated jointly with the Army's pro
gram manager (the CAM). More
over, both programs will be used as
feeders for an intern program, in
which promising students will be
given internships "located at selected
Army sites and academic sites associ
ated with the AHPCRC Program"
(PA. 15-16). Indeed.the whole multi
tiered structure of the program, as
laid out in the PA. suggests that, far
from representing a neutral, non-spe
cific grant to enhance science and en
gineering skills, the "outreach" pro
gram may in fact be envisioned as a
feeder system, designed to use Stan
ford's name, prestige and resources
to channel gifted students toward in
terest and experience in military ap
plications, military research and mili
tary research centers. Much, of
course, depends on how such pro
grams arc implemented, and we hope
that sufficient safeguards and over
sight mechanisms are put in place to
ensure that this is not the case. But in
the absence of such safeguards, the
"outreach" component of the pro
gram as laid out in the PA strikes us as
inappropriate and unacceptable.
Obviously. Stanford should not be
in the business of tunneling children
toward military research to the exclu
sion of other career paths. ITie same
can be said for our own students. One
of the potential problems created by
military research grants in general is
that they push our students.particular
ly graduate students, toward careers in
military research that they might not
otherwise choose (or, indeed, that they
may find objectionable). 'ITiis influ
ence affects not only individual career
paths but arguably shapes the ways in
which entire academic disciplines and
sub-disciplines develop over time.
These are difficult structural issues
with no easy solutions, but they are
compounded and rendered more
acute bv the magnitude and nature of
the AHPCRC grant.
This issue brings us to our broad
est concern. We feel that this grant is
indicative of a wider institutionaliza
tion and deeper cultural entrench
ment of what might be termed the
national security state, with its ex
pectations of perpetual military con
flict abroad and ever-expanding sur
veillance at home. About 20 years
after the end of the Cold War — an

end that held the promise of civilian
ization and attendant peace divi
dends— we find our country in
creasingly tethered to ideological
and geopolitical projects centering
on war and militarization. Our goal is
not to condemn or question the in
tegrity of our colleagues who have
sought out this and other DoD
grants; we have little doubt that they
are brilliant scholars and scientists,
interested primarily in pure scientif
ic research and the expansion of
knowledge. We recognize that they
must necessarily operate in a funding
environment imposed on them by
the priorities of the government. But
the practical results of those priori
ties are real, and. in our view, count
er-productive to the long-term needs
of our University, our country and
the global community. Those needs
are readily apparent. Many of them
have been identified by President
Hennessy in his ambitious Stanford
Challenge, announced last October
— notably environmental sustain
ability,human health,human welfare
and global peace and security. Ar
guably, grants such as that typified by
the AHPCRC serve none of these
goals, insofar as they lock us into a vi
cious cycle in which security is equat
ed with ever more lethal force and
insofar as they encourage us in a per
ilous and complacent overestima
tion of our own capacity to solve
global problems through the me
chanical application of overwhelm
ing firepower. Ultimately, these are
problems — and real choices — that
go to the very core of our identity,
both as an institution and a nation.
Stanford's founding grant stipulates
that its essential mission is "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercis
ing an influence on behalf of human
ity and civilization." What sort of in
fluence do we wish to exercise, and
how. in this critical historical mo
ment. will we choose to deploy the
enormous human and capital re
sources at our disposal? These are
questions that deserve immediate
and ongoing discussion, which, how
ever, will not be possible without ac
cess to the successful proposal sub
mitted by Stanford. We trust that the
University will now release to public
scrutiny all documents relating to the
AHPCRCgrant.and.in the interests
of serious and open discussion, we
await the University's response to
the concerns laid out in this letter.

We write to express deep concern over
the recent announcement that Stan
ford University has been chosen to
lead the Army I ligh Performance Computing
Research Center (AHPCRC) consortium.
While we recognize that Stanford and its fac
ulty frequently receive money from various
wings of the Defense Department, the cur
rent grant strikes us as alarming, both because
of its enormous size ($lO5 million over five
years, with a likelihood of renewal for anoth
er five years) and because its terms seem to
suggest an unusually high level of collabora
tion and coordination with the military. It
concerns us that, at an institution committed
to the ideal of searching intellectual inquiry
and debate, the only substantive public dis
cussion of such a momentous grant has come
in the form of a brief presentation and a short

publicity release, the latter of which arguably
downplays the brute realities of the program
(Stanford Report. April 25, 2007). Attempts
to learn more about the grant have been
blocked by the University administration,
which has thus far refused to make public the
successful proposal submitted by the Consor
tium. It is in the spirit of free and open debate,
therefore, that we offer the current letter, de
signed as it is to provoke self-reflection and
further exploration of this grant's ethical,
practical and intellectual implications for
Stanford's future.
First, we maintain that acceptance of this
money necessitates a frank acknowledge
ment by the I Jniversity of the grant's purpose.
Stanford's publicity announcement empha
sized the potential spin-off technologies that
might come out of the new Consortium. Of

course, such spin-otfs sometimes do emerge
from military research, hut there is little ques
tion in this case that the research will focus on
direct military applications. For example, the
publicity release touted new materials to "en
hance the agility" of army vehicles and per
sonnel. newer and better body armor, light
weight "surveillance drones that a soldier
could literally carry and launch from his or
her uniform" and more sensitive technologies
for detecting chemical or biological agents.
All of these possibilities were described in an
tiseptic terms, emphasizing both their defen
sive nature and their impressive technical
complexity. The government Program An
nouncement (PA) that first solicited propos
als is more transparent, openly declaring that
the new systems designed by the
computing center should be "highly
mobile,deployable,lethal and surviv
able," enabling "a significant increase
in combat effectiveness" (PA, 7).The
point here is that the fundamental
goal of this grant is to create more ef
ficient and, ultimately, more lethal
methods of waging war. Whether
such direct and applied research is
appropriate to the mandate of a mod
ern research university is a very grave
question, but it is a question that can
not even be discussed until we hon
estly and openly admit the nature of
the enterprise.
We fully accept that faculty must
be free to pursue their research inde
pendent of outside interference and
that research projects should not be
subjected to unwarranted political or
moral tests. Yet even within this
framework, we all recognize that
some forms of research may still be
unwise or even unacceptable. The
University clearly recognizes as
much in the rigorous oversight proce
dures it has implemented for certain
forms of inquiry, most notably re
search involving human subjects.
While we wholly endorse fundamen
tal principles of academic freedom, it
seems reasonable to draw attention
to an ethical regime that imposes
careful strictures on even very in
nocuous forms of human-subject re
search (those involving, for instance,
interviews or surveys) but which ap
plies no scrutiny to a huge, long-term
project aimed at enhancing the de
structive capacities of the military.
Nor should there be any doubt
that this grant implies an exception
ally close measure of collaboration
with the military. "Macro level guid
ance" of the program will come from
a steering board, comprised entirely
of representatives from the army. At
the "micro" level, the specific re
search agenda of the center will be
"jointly" determined by the director
of the Consortium (now a Stanford
faculty member) and the army's own
agent, the "Collaborative Alliance
Manager"(PA,29-30). While the Pro
gram Announcement describes the
center's proposed activities as "basic
research," the line between "basic
and "applied" military research is
hopelessly blurred here: the "objec
tive of the basic research efforts" in
cludes "conducting research in col
laboration with Army scientists to ac
celerate the infusion of new tech
nologies in support of Army Irans

formation," to "provide for the mutu
al exchange of researchers between
the Army and the AHPCRC to facil
itate the execution of joint research,"
and "to facilitate [a] transition of new
technologies emerging as a result of
this program to Army Laboratories
and Army Development Centers"
(PA, 4). Indeed, so close and coordi
nated is the proposed relationship
between the computer center and the
military that the grant includes as one
its central provisions funding for the
existence of 11 standing "staff scien
tists." These scientists provide a key
link between the Army and the Stan
ford-led Consortium. Their role is to
engage in research alongside our own
academics, "to act as a liaison" be
tween the center and the Army in
order quickly and efficiently to "tran
sition" the fruits of this research to
Army research labs and "to provide
input to the Consortium members on
various research thrusts at Army
Sites." presumably to ensure that the
research conducted at the center is
closely harmonized with existing
Army needs and projects (PA, 13-15).
In fact, the structure of this grant
seems to suggest an extraordinarily
high degree of coordination, collabo
ration, feedback and joint endeavor
between Stanford (and its Consor
tium partners) and the Army, all with
a view toward providing clear solu
tions to immediate military problems
(or, as the PA puts it. to provide a
"high near-term pay-off for the
Army" [PA. 7]).
Indeed, the nature of the grant
raises serious concerns that the pro
posed collaboration is so intimate
that it may in certain respects run up
against the limits of Stanford's own
rules governing research conduct.
Most seriously, the power of the
Army's manager (CAM) in deter
mining the research agenda of the
center appears to constitute a form of
veto power that seems to contradict
the University's own guidelines con
cerning faculty independence. In ad
dition, questions remain as to
whether the program violates Stan
ford rules forbidding secret, non-dis
closable research. These rules were
established during the Vietnam era
when it became clear that classified
military research was taking place at
Stanford. Then, as now, such classi
fied research was considered inimical
to the fundamental goals of open,
shared inquiry which lie at the heart
of the mission of a university in a free
society. Worryingly, however, the
present grant stipulates that the 11
staff scientists, at least three of whom
may be based at the Stanford/NASA
center, and all of whom will theoreti
cally be working under the umbrella

of the Stanford-led Consortium,
"must be U.S. citizens... capable of ac
quiring secret clearances" (PA. 13).
Likewise, one of the member institu
tions of the Consortium will be "re
quired to maintain a secret facility
clearance and will be able to secure
approval for the storage of SECRET
information" in accordance with de
fense department security regula
tions (PA. 21 ). In the absence of more
detailed information about the final
disposition of the grant, it is difficult
to know exactly what this stipulation
means (particularly since the precise
DoD regulations are themselves im
possible to access from the Web with
out a password). But the allusions to
secret security clearances and the ex
plicit suggestion that some of the ma
terial being researched or handled at
the center will be secret are more
than enough to raise serious ques
tions as to whether certain provisions
of this program violate the spirit, and
perhaps the letter, of Stanford's own
injunctions against secret and classi
fied research. Moreover, the provi
sion that staff scientists (several of
whom may be at the Stanford site,
and all of whom are described as inte
gral to the research program) must
be U.S. citizens would also appear to
be contrary to University guidelines,
which mandate that "Stanford shall
not enter into any research agree
ments which permit discrimination
on the basis of citizenship against in
dividuals engaged in the proposed re
search activities on campus." The in
tegrity of the I Jniversity would seem
to be threatened if these apparent
conflicts go unacknowledged and un
resolved.
Also of considerable concern is
the "outreach" provision of the grant
which, according to the Stanford
publicity release, "will work with
nearby school teachers to augment
their efforts to teach math, science,
engineering and computing," and will
"work closely with Stanford's Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth, a dis
tance-learning program that has
served S().(HX) talented students in 35
countries." On the surface, this pro
gram seems entirely unobjection
able. Who, after all, opposes im
proved education in math and sci
ence? Again, however, close scrutiny
of the Program Announcement rais
es serious questions about whether
this is a transparent grant, with no
strings attached, designed simply to
enhance learning across the board.
The announcement calls for the cre
ation of a multi-tiered structure of
summer programs: a high school
teacher symposium; a pair of two
week programs to teach high-school
ers basic computer skills (with at least

one of them conducted at a histori
cally black or minority member of
the Consortium); and a more elabo
rate nine-week program for under
graduates and gifted high school stu
dents to be conducted at or near
Stanford, in which students will be
immersed in more complex program
ming techniques. This more sophisti
cated summer program will be coor
dinated jointly with the Army's pro
gram manager (the CAM). More
over, both programs will be used as
feeders for an intern program, in
which promising students will be
given internships "located at selected
Army sites and academic sites associ
ated with the AHPCRC Program"
(PA. 15-16). Indeed.the whole multi
tiered structure of the program, as
laid out in the PA. suggests that, far
from representing a neutral, non-spe
cific grant to enhance science and en
gineering skills, the "outreach" pro
gram may in fact be envisioned as a
feeder system, designed to use Stan
ford's name, prestige and resources
to channel gifted students toward in
terest and experience in military ap
plications, military research and mili
tary research centers. Much, of
course, depends on how such pro
grams arc implemented, and we hope
that sufficient safeguards and over
sight mechanisms are put in place to
ensure that this is not the case. But in
the absence of such safeguards, the
"outreach" component of the pro
gram as laid out in the PA strikes us as
inappropriate and unacceptable.
Obviously. Stanford should not be
in the business of tunneling children
toward military research to the exclu
sion of other career paths. ITie same
can be said for our own students. One
of the potential problems created by
military research grants in general is
that they push our students.particular
ly graduate students, toward careers in
military research that they might not
otherwise choose (or, indeed, that they
may find objectionable). 'ITiis influ
ence affects not only individual career
paths but arguably shapes the ways in
which entire academic disciplines and
sub-disciplines develop over time.
These are difficult structural issues
with no easy solutions, but they are
compounded and rendered more
acute bv the magnitude and nature of
the AHPCRC grant.
This issue brings us to our broad
est concern. We feel that this grant is
indicative of a wider institutionaliza
tion and deeper cultural entrench
ment of what might be termed the
national security state, with its ex
pectations of perpetual military con
flict abroad and ever-expanding sur
veillance at home. About 20 years
after the end of the Cold War — an

end that held the promise of civilian
ization and attendant peace divi
dends— we find our country in
creasingly tethered to ideological
and geopolitical projects centering
on war and militarization. Our goal is
not to condemn or question the in
tegrity of our colleagues who have
sought out this and other DoD
grants; we have little doubt that they
are brilliant scholars and scientists,
interested primarily in pure scientif
ic research and the expansion of
knowledge. We recognize that they
must necessarily operate in a funding
environment imposed on them by
the priorities of the government. But
the practical results of those priori
ties are real, and. in our view, count
er-productive to the long-term needs
of our University, our country and
the global community. Those needs
are readily apparent. Many of them
have been identified by President
Hennessy in his ambitious Stanford
Challenge, announced last October
— notably environmental sustain
ability,human health,human welfare
and global peace and security. Ar
guably, grants such as that typified by
the AHPCRC serve none of these
goals, insofar as they lock us into a vi
cious cycle in which security is equat
ed with ever more lethal force and
insofar as they encourage us in a per
ilous and complacent overestima
tion of our own capacity to solve
global problems through the me
chanical application of overwhelm
ing firepower. Ultimately, these are
problems — and real choices — that
go to the very core of our identity,
both as an institution and a nation.
Stanford's founding grant stipulates
that its essential mission is "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercis
ing an influence on behalf of human
ity and civilization." What sort of in
fluence do we wish to exercise, and
how. in this critical historical mo
ment. will we choose to deploy the
enormous human and capital re
sources at our disposal? These are
questions that deserve immediate
and ongoing discussion, which, how
ever, will not be possible without ac
cess to the successful proposal sub
mitted by Stanford. We trust that the
University will now release to public
scrutiny all documents relating to the
AHPCRCgrant.and.in the interests
of serious and open discussion, we
await the University's response to
the concerns laid out in this letter.

We write to express deep concern over
the recent announcement that Stan
ford University has been chosen to
lead the Army I ligh Performance Computing
Research Center (AHPCRC) consortium.
While we recognize that Stanford and its fac
ulty frequently receive money from various
wings of the Defense Department, the cur
rent grant strikes us as alarming, both because
of its enormous size ($lO5 million over five
years, with a likelihood of renewal for anoth
er five years) and because its terms seem to
suggest an unusually high level of collabora
tion and coordination with the military. It
concerns us that, at an institution committed
to the ideal of searching intellectual inquiry
and debate, the only substantive public dis
cussion of such a momentous grant has come
in the form of a brief presentation and a short

publicity release, the latter of which arguably
downplays the brute realities of the program
(Stanford Report. April 25, 2007). Attempts
to learn more about the grant have been
blocked by the University administration,
which has thus far refused to make public the
successful proposal submitted by the Consor
tium. It is in the spirit of free and open debate,
therefore, that we offer the current letter, de
signed as it is to provoke self-reflection and
further exploration of this grant's ethical,
practical and intellectual implications for
Stanford's future.
First, we maintain that acceptance of this
money necessitates a frank acknowledge
ment by the I Jniversity of the grant's purpose.
Stanford's publicity announcement empha
sized the potential spin-off technologies that
might come out of the new Consortium. Of

course, such spin-otfs sometimes do emerge
from military research, hut there is little ques
tion in this case that the research will focus on
direct military applications. For example, the
publicity release touted new materials to "en
hance the agility" of army vehicles and per
sonnel. newer and better body armor, light
weight "surveillance drones that a soldier
could literally carry and launch from his or
her uniform" and more sensitive technologies
for detecting chemical or biological agents.
All of these possibilities were described in an
tiseptic terms, emphasizing both their defen
sive nature and their impressive technical
complexity. The government Program An
nouncement (PA) that first solicited propos
als is more transparent, openly declaring that
the new systems designed by the
computing center should be "highly
mobile,deployable,lethal and surviv
able," enabling "a significant increase
in combat effectiveness" (PA, 7).The
point here is that the fundamental
goal of this grant is to create more ef
ficient and, ultimately, more lethal
methods of waging war. Whether
such direct and applied research is
appropriate to the mandate of a mod
ern research university is a very grave
question, but it is a question that can
not even be discussed until we hon
estly and openly admit the nature of
the enterprise.
We fully accept that faculty must
be free to pursue their research inde
pendent of outside interference and
that research projects should not be
subjected to unwarranted political or
moral tests. Yet even within this
framework, we all recognize that
some forms of research may still be
unwise or even unacceptable. The
University clearly recognizes as
much in the rigorous oversight proce
dures it has implemented for certain
forms of inquiry, most notably re
search involving human subjects.
While we wholly endorse fundamen
tal principles of academic freedom, it
seems reasonable to draw attention
to an ethical regime that imposes
careful strictures on even very in
nocuous forms of human-subject re
search (those involving, for instance,
interviews or surveys) but which ap
plies no scrutiny to a huge, long-term
project aimed at enhancing the de
structive capacities of the military.
Nor should there be any doubt
that this grant implies an exception
ally close measure of collaboration
with the military. "Macro level guid
ance" of the program will come from
a steering board, comprised entirely
of representatives from the army. At
the "micro" level, the specific re
search agenda of the center will be
"jointly" determined by the director
of the Consortium (now a Stanford
faculty member) and the army's own
agent, the "Collaborative Alliance
Manager"(PA,29-30). While the Pro
gram Announcement describes the
center's proposed activities as "basic
research," the line between "basic
and "applied" military research is
hopelessly blurred here: the "objec
tive of the basic research efforts" in
cludes "conducting research in col
laboration with Army scientists to ac
celerate the infusion of new tech
nologies in support of Army Irans

formation," to "provide for the mutu
al exchange of researchers between
the Army and the AHPCRC to facil
itate the execution of joint research,"
and "to facilitate [a] transition of new
technologies emerging as a result of
this program to Army Laboratories
and Army Development Centers"
(PA, 4). Indeed, so close and coordi
nated is the proposed relationship
between the computer center and the
military that the grant includes as one
its central provisions funding for the
existence of 11 standing "staff scien
tists." These scientists provide a key
link between the Army and the Stan
ford-led Consortium. Their role is to
engage in research alongside our own
academics, "to act as a liaison" be
tween the center and the Army in
order quickly and efficiently to "tran
sition" the fruits of this research to
Army research labs and "to provide
input to the Consortium members on
various research thrusts at Army
Sites." presumably to ensure that the
research conducted at the center is
closely harmonized with existing
Army needs and projects (PA, 13-15).
In fact, the structure of this grant
seems to suggest an extraordinarily
high degree of coordination, collabo
ration, feedback and joint endeavor
between Stanford (and its Consor
tium partners) and the Army, all with
a view toward providing clear solu
tions to immediate military problems
(or, as the PA puts it. to provide a
"high near-term pay-off for the
Army" [PA. 7]).
Indeed, the nature of the grant
raises serious concerns that the pro
posed collaboration is so intimate
that it may in certain respects run up
against the limits of Stanford's own
rules governing research conduct.
Most seriously, the power of the
Army's manager (CAM) in deter
mining the research agenda of the
center appears to constitute a form of
veto power that seems to contradict
the University's own guidelines con
cerning faculty independence. In ad
dition, questions remain as to
whether the program violates Stan
ford rules forbidding secret, non-dis
closable research. These rules were
established during the Vietnam era
when it became clear that classified
military research was taking place at
Stanford. Then, as now, such classi
fied research was considered inimical
to the fundamental goals of open,
shared inquiry which lie at the heart
of the mission of a university in a free
society. Worryingly, however, the
present grant stipulates that the 11
staff scientists, at least three of whom
may be based at the Stanford/NASA
center, and all of whom will theoreti
cally be working under the umbrella

of the Stanford-led Consortium,
"must be U.S. citizens... capable of ac
quiring secret clearances" (PA. 13).
Likewise, one of the member institu
tions of the Consortium will be "re
quired to maintain a secret facility
clearance and will be able to secure
approval for the storage of SECRET
information" in accordance with de
fense department security regula
tions (PA. 21 ). In the absence of more
detailed information about the final
disposition of the grant, it is difficult
to know exactly what this stipulation
means (particularly since the precise
DoD regulations are themselves im
possible to access from the Web with
out a password). But the allusions to
secret security clearances and the ex
plicit suggestion that some of the ma
terial being researched or handled at
the center will be secret are more
than enough to raise serious ques
tions as to whether certain provisions
of this program violate the spirit, and
perhaps the letter, of Stanford's own
injunctions against secret and classi
fied research. Moreover, the provi
sion that staff scientists (several of
whom may be at the Stanford site,
and all of whom are described as inte
gral to the research program) must
be U.S. citizens would also appear to
be contrary to University guidelines,
which mandate that "Stanford shall
not enter into any research agree
ments which permit discrimination
on the basis of citizenship against in
dividuals engaged in the proposed re
search activities on campus." The in
tegrity of the I Jniversity would seem
to be threatened if these apparent
conflicts go unacknowledged and un
resolved.
Also of considerable concern is
the "outreach" provision of the grant
which, according to the Stanford
publicity release, "will work with
nearby school teachers to augment
their efforts to teach math, science,
engineering and computing," and will
"work closely with Stanford's Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth, a dis
tance-learning program that has
served S().(HX) talented students in 35
countries." On the surface, this pro
gram seems entirely unobjection
able. Who, after all, opposes im
proved education in math and sci
ence? Again, however, close scrutiny
of the Program Announcement rais
es serious questions about whether
this is a transparent grant, with no
strings attached, designed simply to
enhance learning across the board.
The announcement calls for the cre
ation of a multi-tiered structure of
summer programs: a high school
teacher symposium; a pair of two
week programs to teach high-school
ers basic computer skills (with at least

one of them conducted at a histori
cally black or minority member of
the Consortium); and a more elabo
rate nine-week program for under
graduates and gifted high school stu
dents to be conducted at or near
Stanford, in which students will be
immersed in more complex program
ming techniques. This more sophisti
cated summer program will be coor
dinated jointly with the Army's pro
gram manager (the CAM). More
over, both programs will be used as
feeders for an intern program, in
which promising students will be
given internships "located at selected
Army sites and academic sites associ
ated with the AHPCRC Program"
(PA. 15-16). Indeed.the whole multi
tiered structure of the program, as
laid out in the PA. suggests that, far
from representing a neutral, non-spe
cific grant to enhance science and en
gineering skills, the "outreach" pro
gram may in fact be envisioned as a
feeder system, designed to use Stan
ford's name, prestige and resources
to channel gifted students toward in
terest and experience in military ap
plications, military research and mili
tary research centers. Much, of
course, depends on how such pro
grams arc implemented, and we hope
that sufficient safeguards and over
sight mechanisms are put in place to
ensure that this is not the case. But in
the absence of such safeguards, the
"outreach" component of the pro
gram as laid out in the PA strikes us as
inappropriate and unacceptable.
Obviously. Stanford should not be
in the business of tunneling children
toward military research to the exclu
sion of other career paths. ITie same
can be said for our own students. One
of the potential problems created by
military research grants in general is
that they push our students.particular
ly graduate students, toward careers in
military research that they might not
otherwise choose (or, indeed, that they
may find objectionable). 'ITiis influ
ence affects not only individual career
paths but arguably shapes the ways in
which entire academic disciplines and
sub-disciplines develop over time.
These are difficult structural issues
with no easy solutions, but they are
compounded and rendered more
acute bv the magnitude and nature of
the AHPCRC grant.
This issue brings us to our broad
est concern. We feel that this grant is
indicative of a wider institutionaliza
tion and deeper cultural entrench
ment of what might be termed the
national security state, with its ex
pectations of perpetual military con
flict abroad and ever-expanding sur
veillance at home. About 20 years
after the end of the Cold War — an

end that held the promise of civilian
ization and attendant peace divi
dends— we find our country in
creasingly tethered to ideological
and geopolitical projects centering
on war and militarization. Our goal is
not to condemn or question the in
tegrity of our colleagues who have
sought out this and other DoD
grants; we have little doubt that they
are brilliant scholars and scientists,
interested primarily in pure scientif
ic research and the expansion of
knowledge. We recognize that they
must necessarily operate in a funding
environment imposed on them by
the priorities of the government. But
the practical results of those priori
ties are real, and. in our view, count
er-productive to the long-term needs
of our University, our country and
the global community. Those needs
are readily apparent. Many of them
have been identified by President
Hennessy in his ambitious Stanford
Challenge, announced last October
— notably environmental sustain
ability,human health,human welfare
and global peace and security. Ar
guably, grants such as that typified by
the AHPCRC serve none of these
goals, insofar as they lock us into a vi
cious cycle in which security is equat
ed with ever more lethal force and
insofar as they encourage us in a per
ilous and complacent overestima
tion of our own capacity to solve
global problems through the me
chanical application of overwhelm
ing firepower. Ultimately, these are
problems — and real choices — that
go to the very core of our identity,
both as an institution and a nation.
Stanford's founding grant stipulates
that its essential mission is "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercis
ing an influence on behalf of human
ity and civilization." What sort of in
fluence do we wish to exercise, and
how. in this critical historical mo
ment. will we choose to deploy the
enormous human and capital re
sources at our disposal? These are
questions that deserve immediate
and ongoing discussion, which, how
ever, will not be possible without ac
cess to the successful proposal sub
mitted by Stanford. We trust that the
University will now release to public
scrutiny all documents relating to the
AHPCRCgrant.and.in the interests
of serious and open discussion, we
await the University's response to
the concerns laid out in this letter.
