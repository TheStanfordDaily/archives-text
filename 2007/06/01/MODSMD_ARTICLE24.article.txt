## Troubling Defense grant may have strings 
### 
We write to express deep concern over
the recent announcement that Stan
ford University has been chosen to
lead the Army I ligh Performance Computing
Research Center (AHPCRC) consortium.
While we recognize that Stanford and its fac
ulty frequently receive money from various
wings of the Defense Department, the cur
rent grant strikes us as alarming, both because
of its enormous size ($lO5 million over five
years, with a likelihood of renewal for anoth
er five years) and because its terms seem to
suggest an unusually high level of collabora
tion and coordination with the military. It
concerns us that, at an institution committed
to the ideal of searching intellectual inquiry
and debate, the only substantive public dis
cussion of such a momentous grant has come
in the form of a brief presentation and a short

publicity release, the latter of which arguably
downplays the brute realities of the program
(Stanford Report. April 25, 2007). Attempts
to learn more about the grant have been
blocked by the University administration,
which has thus far refused to make public the
successful proposal submitted by the Consor
tium. It is in the spirit of free and open debate,
therefore, that we offer the current letter, de
signed as it is to provoke self-reflection and
further exploration of this grant's ethical,
practical and intellectual implications for
Stanford's future.
First, we maintain that acceptance of this
money necessitates a frank acknowledge
ment by the I Jniversity of the grant's purpose.
Stanford's publicity announcement empha
sized the potential spin-off technologies that
might come out of the new Consortium. Of

course, such spin-otfs sometimes do emerge
from military research, hut there is little ques
tion in this case that the research will focus on
direct military applications. For example, the
publicity release touted new materials to "en
hance the agility" of army vehicles and per
sonnel. newer and better body armor, light
weight "surveillance drones that a soldier
could literally carry and launch from his or
her uniform" and more sensitive technologies
for detecting chemical or biological agents.
All of these possibilities were described in an
tiseptic terms, emphasizing both their defen
sive nature and their impressive technical
complexity. The government Program An
nouncement (PA) that first solicited propos
als is more transparent, openly declaring that
