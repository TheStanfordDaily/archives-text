## What do we do after four years of genocide? 
### NIKKI SERAPIO 
Ihe day after President Bush im
posed sanctions against the govern
ment of Sudan, Khartoum's Ambas
sador to the U.S. John Ukec Lueth
Ukec went on the diplomatic offen
sive. Speaking at the National Press
Club,he denied that genocide is occur
ring in Darfur. He said no one is dying
in Dartur. And he underlined his gov
ernment's frustration with a very
unique threat: If the U.S. presses on
Sudan that much more, then no more
Coca-Cola for you: Omar al-Bashir
and company will stop exporting
Sudan's gum arabic.and the world will
be without its favorite source of caf
feine.
Mr. Ukec's claims are clearly stu
pid. There was so much showmanship
in his display,you might think the gov
ernment of Sudan deserves to be his
torically cast into the quirky dictators'
club, ldi Amin, Kim Jong-ll.Turkmen
bash i and those loud crazies ruling
Sudan. But then you remember, and
the reminder expresses the tragedy:
Mr. Ukec works for a regime that has
killed more than 500,(XX) men. women
and children in Darfur over the last
four years. And the dying and the
world's worst humanitarian crisis con
tinue today.
Foreign policy analysts point out
that Khartoum is clearly the opposite
of stupid. As one example, the regime
knows how to destroy a UN resolu
tion, as it did last year: in August 2006.
the UN Security Council authorized
20.000+ troops to deploy to Darfur,
but Sudan jumped on the fact that this
resolution "invited" its consent. ("In
vited" is arguably a diplomatic code
word for required.) Khartoum assert
ed its sovereignty; it used the long
shadow of the Iraq War to suggest that
the U.S. was planning an oil-driven,
imperial march into Africa and, as an
"alternative" to the abovementioned
force deployment, it got the UN to
agree to a three-part plan about multi
national peacekeepers. When this
compromise was announced, then-
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said part three of the plan specified the
deployment of UN troops. According
to Khartoum right now. however, part
three means nothing of the sort.
There are too many examples of
the UN dithering in the face of mass
atrocity, and the genocide in Darfur is
no exception. When President Bush
spoke about Darfur at the Holocaust
Memorial Museum last month, he
took what sounded like a potshot at

the UN: "The brutal treatment of in
nocent civilians in Darfur is...unac
ceptable to the United Nations — at
least, that's what they've said."
President Bush, though, cannot
claim the high ground. This Tuesday, in
a move criticized by Amnesty Interna
tional, the ENOUGH Project, Human
Rights Watch, American Jewish World
Service and many others,the President
announced that the U.S. has begun im
plementing his weak "Plan B'for Dar
fur. This plan is made up of new unilat
eral sanctions that Khartoum is very
ready for (given that it has grown
tremendously wealthy despite the U.S.
sanctions that have been in place
against it since 1997), a promise that
Condoleezza Rice is seeking a new
UN resolution about Darfur and a
promise that the U.S. will try to impose
multilateral sanctions on Khartoum
via the Security Council — but against
Sudan's mid-level officials, not against
the senior leadership that actually con
trols and executes the current divide
and-destroy campaign in Darfur.
What's wrong with this picture? In
his sanctions pitch. President Bush
made it seem that his sanctions will ul
timately and actually affect the pocket
books and economic freedom of
Sudan's murderers. But the President's
Special Envoy to Sudan Andrew Nat
sios assured everyone that, indeed,
these unilateral measures are tooth
less: "The purpose of these sanctions is
not sanctions. [Their] purpose is to
send a message to the Sudanese gov
ernment to start behaving differently
when they deal with their own people."
Well, President Bush and his team
have been sending "messages" to
Khartoum for three years now.
What needs to be done? On the
sanctions issue, there is basically a con
sensus among advocates, human
rights groups and foreign policy think
tanks that Sudan sanctions 1) need to
be multilateral to be effective, and 2)
need to target Sudan's high-level lead
ers to be effective. Right now. Presi
dent Bush has pledged to fulfill the
first criterion. But his administration is
far away from pushing for the second.
Besides this, there is the issue of
using actual military force in Darfur.
The reasoning behind strong sanc
tions is that they will disable Sudan on
the international marketplace. And
thus Bashir will ultimately need to say
"yes" to UN peacekeepers.
But of course there are no guaran
tees about sanctions, and at the end.
Americans who care about the people
of Darfur need to confront some hard

questions about the use of military
force.'lliere is a W percent chance that
we will have to use violence to end the
most extreme kind of violence known
to humanity. If we support UN peace
keepers. we ought to expect them to
use force against the Janjaweed mili
tias, against people who have had no
qualms in gang-raping young Darfuri
girls.
Stanford STAND supports effec
tive military action to stop this geno
cide. UN peacekeepers should deploy
to Darfur, but no one is under the illu
sion that they can deploy quickly. For
this reason, and because of the many,
many reports from humanitarian or
ganizations saying that they are close
to pulling out of Western Sudan be
cause of the insecurity, there are some
people,like General Wesley Clark and
former Clinton administration offi
cials Anthony l.ake and Susan Rice,
who believe that our country should
not depend on Sudan's consent in
order to act. Speaking at Stanford last
week, Clark expressed strong support
for the non-consensual deployment of
NATO troops to Darfur. And for over
a year, l .ake and Rice have asked the
question, if Kosovo and ethnic cleans
ing, why not Darfur and genocide? If
the U.S. was willing to use its air power
to stop Milosevic, why shouldn't it use
surgical strikes (combined with the
deployment of a light quick reaction
force to Eastern Chad) to destroy
Sudan's air fields, military planes and
other military assets-the exact things
Khartoum needs to bomb the people
of Darfur? On its part. STAND fully
supports Clark. Lake and Rice's pro
posals.
Right now, however, the Darfur
policy climate in DC isn't all about the
big issue of military intervention.
Right now, the decision to be support
ed or rejected has to do with targeted,
multilateral sanctions against Sudan's
high-level leaders. No shot has to be
fired, no plane has to be launched, no
military resource needs to be exhaust
ed to impose these sanctions. Presi
dent Bush just has to invest in the full
court-press diplomacy necessary to
push these sanctions through — per
haps an involved task given other
countries' ties to Sudan, but far from
impossible. So what's our country
waiting for?
And another question: What are
we waiting fc>r? 1 bday, STAND will be
out in White Plaza from 11:00 am to
3:oopm, hosting Camp Darfur, an ex
hibit that can help Stanford keep in
mind the hunger, death and displace

ment that continues today in Western
Sudan. We'll have petitions to Con
gress you can sign, scripts you can use
to call your elected officials and sug
gestions for how you can continue ad
vocacy over this summer.
At the end. the people of Darfur
are unfortunate to have been born in
Africa. In my three years coordinating
Darfur activism at Stanford and off
campus, I've always believed that peo
ple would respond to this crisis if it
were closer to home. Of course we
can't imagine such a scenario for more
than a few moments, but at least we
can imagine the scenario in order to
examine our consciences. What if this
happened in Canada? In our own
country? What would our response
be? Do we hear the people of Darfur,
who themselves are calling for con
crete justice and concrete multina
tional protection? Do we really value
their lives in any way?

who believe that our country should
not depend on Sudan's consent in
order to act. Speaking at Stanford last
week, Clark expressed strong support
for the non-consensual deployment of
NATO troops to Darfur. And for over
a year, l .ake and Rice have asked the
question, if Kosovo and ethnic cleans
ing, why not Darfur and genocide? If
the U.S. was willing to use its air power
to stop Milosevic, why shouldn't it use
surgical strikes (combined with the
deployment of a light quick reaction
force to Eastern Chad) to destroy
Sudan's air fields, military planes and
other military assets-the exact things
Khartoum needs to bomb the people
of Darfur? On its part. STAND fully
supports Clark. Lake and Rice's pro
posals.
Right now, however, the Darfur
policy climate in DC isn't all about the
big issue of military intervention.
Right now, the decision to be support
ed or rejected has to do with targeted,
multilateral sanctions against Sudan's
high-level leaders. No shot has to be
fired, no plane has to be launched, no
military resource needs to be exhaust
ed to impose these sanctions. Presi
dent Bush just has to invest in the full
court-press diplomacy necessary to
push these sanctions through — per
haps an involved task given other
countries' ties to Sudan, but far from
impossible. So what's our country
waiting for?
And another question: What are
we waiting fc>r? 1 bday, STAND will be
out in White Plaza from 11:00 am to
3:oopm, hosting Camp Darfur, an ex
hibit that can help Stanford keep in
mind the hunger, death and displace

ment that continues today in Western
Sudan. We'll have petitions to Con
gress you can sign, scripts you can use
to call your elected officials and sug
gestions for how you can continue ad
vocacy over this summer.
At the end. the people of Darfur
are unfortunate to have been born in
Africa. In my three years coordinating
Darfur activism at Stanford and off
campus, I've always believed that peo
ple would respond to this crisis if it
were closer to home. Of course we
can't imagine such a scenario for more
than a few moments, but at least we
can imagine the scenario in order to
examine our consciences. What if this
happened in Canada? In our own
country? What would our response
be? Do we hear the people of Darfur,
who themselves are calling for con
crete justice and concrete multina
tional protection? Do we really value
their lives in any way?

Ihe day after President Bush im
posed sanctions against the govern
ment of Sudan, Khartoum's Ambas
sador to the U.S. John Ukec Lueth
Ukec went on the diplomatic offen
sive. Speaking at the National Press
Club,he denied that genocide is occur
ring in Darfur. He said no one is dying
in Dartur. And he underlined his gov
ernment's frustration with a very
unique threat: If the U.S. presses on
Sudan that much more, then no more
Coca-Cola for you: Omar al-Bashir
and company will stop exporting
Sudan's gum arabic.and the world will
be without its favorite source of caf
feine.
Mr. Ukec's claims are clearly stu
pid. There was so much showmanship
in his display,you might think the gov
ernment of Sudan deserves to be his
torically cast into the quirky dictators'
club, ldi Amin, Kim Jong-ll.Turkmen
bash i and those loud crazies ruling
Sudan. But then you remember, and
the reminder expresses the tragedy:
Mr. Ukec works for a regime that has
killed more than 500,(XX) men. women
and children in Darfur over the last
four years. And the dying and the
world's worst humanitarian crisis con
tinue today.
Foreign policy analysts point out
that Khartoum is clearly the opposite
of stupid. As one example, the regime
knows how to destroy a UN resolu
tion, as it did last year: in August 2006.
the UN Security Council authorized
20.000+ troops to deploy to Darfur,
but Sudan jumped on the fact that this
resolution "invited" its consent. ("In
vited" is arguably a diplomatic code
word for required.) Khartoum assert
ed its sovereignty; it used the long
shadow of the Iraq War to suggest that
the U.S. was planning an oil-driven,
imperial march into Africa and, as an
"alternative" to the abovementioned
force deployment, it got the UN to
agree to a three-part plan about multi
national peacekeepers. When this
compromise was announced, then-
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said part three of the plan specified the
deployment of UN troops. According
to Khartoum right now. however, part
three means nothing of the sort.
There are too many examples of
the UN dithering in the face of mass
atrocity, and the genocide in Darfur is
no exception. When President Bush
spoke about Darfur at the Holocaust
Memorial Museum last month, he
took what sounded like a potshot at

the UN: "The brutal treatment of in
nocent civilians in Darfur is...unac
ceptable to the United Nations — at
least, that's what they've said."
President Bush, though, cannot
claim the high ground. This Tuesday, in
a move criticized by Amnesty Interna
tional, the ENOUGH Project, Human
Rights Watch, American Jewish World
Service and many others,the President
announced that the U.S. has begun im
plementing his weak "Plan B'for Dar
fur. This plan is made up of new unilat
eral sanctions that Khartoum is very
ready for (given that it has grown
tremendously wealthy despite the U.S.
sanctions that have been in place
against it since 1997), a promise that
Condoleezza Rice is seeking a new
UN resolution about Darfur and a
promise that the U.S. will try to impose
multilateral sanctions on Khartoum
via the Security Council — but against
Sudan's mid-level officials, not against
the senior leadership that actually con
trols and executes the current divide
and-destroy campaign in Darfur.
What's wrong with this picture? In
his sanctions pitch. President Bush
made it seem that his sanctions will ul
timately and actually affect the pocket
books and economic freedom of
Sudan's murderers. But the President's
Special Envoy to Sudan Andrew Nat
sios assured everyone that, indeed,
these unilateral measures are tooth
less: "The purpose of these sanctions is
not sanctions. [Their] purpose is to
send a message to the Sudanese gov
ernment to start behaving differently
when they deal with their own people."
Well, President Bush and his team
have been sending "messages" to
Khartoum for three years now.
What needs to be done? On the
sanctions issue, there is basically a con
sensus among advocates, human
rights groups and foreign policy think
tanks that Sudan sanctions 1) need to
be multilateral to be effective, and 2)
need to target Sudan's high-level lead
ers to be effective. Right now. Presi
dent Bush has pledged to fulfill the
first criterion. But his administration is
far away from pushing for the second.
Besides this, there is the issue of
using actual military force in Darfur.
The reasoning behind strong sanc
tions is that they will disable Sudan on
the international marketplace. And
thus Bashir will ultimately need to say
"yes" to UN peacekeepers.
But of course there are no guaran
tees about sanctions, and at the end.
Americans who care about the people
of Darfur need to confront some hard

questions about the use of military
force.'lliere is a W percent chance that
we will have to use violence to end the
most extreme kind of violence known
to humanity. If we support UN peace
keepers. we ought to expect them to
use force against the Janjaweed mili
tias, against people who have had no
qualms in gang-raping young Darfuri
girls.
Stanford STAND supports effec
tive military action to stop this geno
cide. UN peacekeepers should deploy
to Darfur, but no one is under the illu
sion that they can deploy quickly. For
this reason, and because of the many,
many reports from humanitarian or
ganizations saying that they are close
to pulling out of Western Sudan be
cause of the insecurity, there are some
people,like General Wesley Clark and
former Clinton administration offi
cials Anthony l.ake and Susan Rice,
who believe that our country should
not depend on Sudan's consent in
order to act. Speaking at Stanford last
week, Clark expressed strong support
for the non-consensual deployment of
NATO troops to Darfur. And for over
