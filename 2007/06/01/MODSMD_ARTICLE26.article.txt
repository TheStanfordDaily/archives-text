## Kobe fails to uphold MJ's legacy 
### 
From the second he stepped
into the Great Western Forum
in 1996, Kobe has been com
pared to Michael Jordan.
It only seemed natural. The two
superstars have similar physiques,
similar games and now, a combined
nine titles between them.
With the progression of Kobe's
career — teaming with Shaq. win
ning three championships, breaking
up with Shaq and trying to gain com
plete command of the Lakers' fran
chise for the last three years — com
parisons to Jordan have always
abounded.
Some think it's unfair to Kobe.
Others think that he shouldn't even
be compared to Jordan in the first
place — Kobe is Kobe and Jordan is
Jordan. But both schools of thought
are wrong.
Kobe is an amazing player. Like
all the great tines, he does things on
the court that leave you falling out of
your chair, with your jaw dropping
to the floor. He has very comparable
stats to Jordan, as he won three titles,
and is arguably the better defensive
player of the two. Kobe even has that
really cool Adidas "1 late Me" com
mercial thing going.
But he's never going to reach the
bar set by Mike. And yeah. 1 just
compared them.
For a moment, forget the tongue
wag, the "Like Mike" Gatorade ads
and even the six championships.
Michael Jordan, above all else,
had unwavering loyalty to the
Chicago Bulls franchise, the city of
Chicago and to himself. Essentially
spending his whole career in Chica
go (MJ's circus stint with the Wiz
ards is in no way a part of his legacy).
Jordan was the perfect guy to build a
team around. He didn't need a Shaq
by his side to win a title — Scottie
Pippen was good enough. When
Scottie was out. M.I elevated his
game, doing whatever he had to do
to win.
Which is why Kobe Bryant's an
nouncement Tuesday that he wanted
to be traded rubbed me the wrong
