## Kobe fails to uphold MJ's legacy 
### 
From the second he stepped
into the Great Western Forum
in 1996, Kobe has been com
pared to Michael Jordan.
It only seemed natural. The two
superstars have similar physiques,
similar games and now, a combined
nine titles between them.
With the progression of Kobe's
career — teaming with Shaq. win
ning three championships, breaking
up with Shaq and trying to gain com
plete command of the Lakers' fran
chise for the last three years — com
parisons to Jordan have always
abounded.
Some think it's unfair to Kobe.
Others think that he shouldn't even
be compared to Jordan in the first
place — Kobe is Kobe and Jordan is
Jordan. But both schools of thought
are wrong.
Kobe is an amazing player. Like
all the great tines, he does things on
the court that leave you falling out of
your chair, with your jaw dropping
to the floor. He has very comparable
stats to Jordan, as he won three titles,
and is arguably the better defensive
player of the two. Kobe even has that
really cool Adidas "1 late Me" com
mercial thing going.
But he's never going to reach the
bar set by Mike. And yeah. 1 just
compared them.
For a moment, forget the tongue
wag, the "Like Mike" Gatorade ads
and even the six championships.
Michael Jordan, above all else,
had unwavering loyalty to the
Chicago Bulls franchise, the city of
Chicago and to himself. Essentially
spending his whole career in Chica
go (MJ's circus stint with the Wiz
ards is in no way a part of his legacy).
Jordan was the perfect guy to build a
team around. He didn't need a Shaq
by his side to win a title — Scottie
Pippen was good enough. When
Scottie was out. M.I elevated his
game, doing whatever he had to do
to win.
Which is why Kobe Bryant's an
nouncement Tuesday that he wanted
to be traded rubbed me the wrong

way.
"I would like to be traded,yeah,"
he told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith.
"Tough as it is to corue to that con
clusion, there's no other alternative,
you know?"
"1 just want them to do the right
thing," Bryant added. "At this point
Ill go play on Pluto."
I'm not sure where to start in dis
secting Kobe's statements. It's prob
ably better to not even analyze
them at all. There's so much unin
tended irony in Kobe's words that
it's probably best to let them speak
for themselves.
Regardless of what he said ex
actly, Kobe Bryant made a mistake
when he asked to be traded, and he
knew it right away — just yesterday
he backtracked, telling ESPN's Dan
Patrick. "1 don't want to go any
where else. I want to be here for the
rest of my career."
In the first place, it's incredibly
childish and unbecoming of an
NBA superstar (or maybe not) to
say you want to be traded one day
and then go against your word the
next. But just the fact that Kobe
wanted to be traded, the fact that he
had envisioned a legacy for himself
and now has thoughts of reject
ing it — startles me.
Sure, Kobe has every right in the
world to demand a trade. Allen
Iverson had that very right in
Philadelphia and took advantage of
it. But Kobe doesn't have nearly the
maturity or deference that AI has
developed in recent years. Me isn't
just about winning a championship
he's about winning a champi
onship with his name on it. At least
that's what he's projected since the
day that Shaq left L A. If Kobe
ditched his dynasty, it would under
mine not only his integrity, but his
legacy as well.
But most importantly, and most
daringly, Kobe temporarily turned
his back on the city of Los Angeles.
When it came to basketball,
Kobe galvanized L.A., becoming
larger than life in a city that prides
itself on that very quality.
L.A.is a city that doesn't care for
sports, but did care when Kobe en
tered the spotlight. A city that is
more focused on TV and the latest
fashions filled the stands, largely be
cause of him. It was the same city
that stood behind him fully when he
faced the toughest ordeal of his life
with the bogus rape accusations.
That's what Kobe turned his
back on.
I have no qualms with compar
ing Kobe to MJ.Their games are too
similar not to compare them.
But the conclusion I've come to
is that Kobe, like nearly all of us. can
only wish to be "Like Mike."
