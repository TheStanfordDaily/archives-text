# Sailing holds fifth after first day at ISCA national championships
## 
### 
One day into the Intercolle
giate Sailing Association
(ICSA) national champi
onships. Stanford stands fifth
in the coed dinghy compeition.
After the first set of races, the
Cardinal coeds have a com
bined ( )4 points for a one-point
lead over sixth-place Yale.
Hie current leaders are, im
probably, the two schools which
received at-large bids to the
championships. UC-Irvine
leads with 72 points, while
Brown is in second with 84: nei
ther school had won a local
championship to secure a bid to
the ICSAs. The College of
Charleston is in third with 86
points and Dartmouth is just
behind in fourth with 88.
Scores for the regatta arc
determined by adding the fin
ishes of the team's boats across
the "A" and "B" divisions. Bet
ter finishes in the races produce
lower total scores, and the goal
is achieving the lowest total
score at the conclusion of the
events.
Stanford is still within striking distance and will look to
make up ground over the final two days of racing.
The coed dinghy event is the last portion of the ICSA
national regatta.The Cardinal took third in the women's
championship at the start of the week, though Stanford
failed to qualify for the team racing championship.
