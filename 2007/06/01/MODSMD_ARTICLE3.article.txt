# Cardinal Tennis
## 89 WINS Coaches and players reflect on the amazing streak that was 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
January 18,1974 is one of the more famous days in college ath
letic history. On that day, UCLA basketball suffered a

stunning loss to Notre Dame, ending its epic 88-
game winning streak. It's a day that still resonates
for many — the mythical Bruins had finally
been toppled by the Fighting Irish.
February 3,2(X)7 is a date that doesn't stick out
as mueh in NCAA history. On this day, Stanford

women's tennis suffered its first loss since 2(X)3 in a 4-3
match to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. What many peo-

pic didn't know, though, was that the loss ended an 89-match win
ning streak — one up on John Wooden's legendary Bruins — built
in just over three years.
89 wins in a row.
Looking hack on it, it's almost hard to fathom.
Hie Cardinal concluded this past season 24-2 and made it to the
NCAA Championship semifinals. But Stanford's real crowning
glory this year was its final tally of 89 wins a row, dating back to its
loss in the 2003 NCAA title game to Florida.
The streak might just be the greatest ever in college athletics,
but the NCAA does not keep an official record of the most consec
utive wins by a team for various reasons: ties, disparities between
divisions and differences in the way that sports are recorded, to
name a few.
Nor is 89 wins definitively the most. Other programs, like North
Carolina's women's soccer team, have streaks that extend into the
triple digits. The Tar 1 leels tied in many games, though, while Stan
ford did not, so gauging a streak solely on its numerical value isn't
all that telling.
But in any case, the Cardinal's streak doesn't need a record to
validate itself. Led by head coach Lele Forood and players such as
Alice Barnes '06, Amber Liu'o6 and current seniors Theresa Logar

and Anne Yelsey (Liu and Barnes were with the team for all but
three of the 89 wins, while Yelsey and Logar were with the team in
all of them), Stanford's win streak included plenty of its own high
lights.
Only two of the matches were 4-3 decisions. That's how domi
nant the Cardinal was.
IWenty-seven of the victories were 7-0 sweeps. Another 18 were
6-1 decisions.
During the streak, the Cardinal captured three national titles.
Forood brought her personal total to live, while uppitig the
school's total to 15.The 10 other titles were all won by Frank Bi en
nan, father to current assistant coach Frankie Jr.

Anne Yelsey was part of three national championship victories with Stan
ford tennis. The senior was with Cardinal for the all of its remarkable 89-
match run of success.

home wins and 40 wins against top-25 competi
tion.
Ihe numbers could leave someone speech
less. but the question ultimately arises:"! low did
they do it?"
Playing significant roles in the streak. Forood,
Yelsey and assistant coach Frankie Brennan had
their thoughts on the subject.
"When you have a streak that long, it's a lot of
things." Forood said."l uck was certainly a part of
it. because you have to stay relatively healthy. It
was a combination of talent, desire, work ethic,
coaching and luck. Everything played a role."
"I think it was a mentality." said Yelsey, the
senior co captain. "I think it was the attitude that
the older girls projected onto the team. Ihe
coaches kind of approached the atmosphere with
that idea.
"Coming in as a freshman you took it to heart
and believed it," she continued. "You believed
that we should win all the time."
"To stay healthy the way we did for three
years was great." Brennan added. "That was a big
part of it: the depth of our team — toughness,
too."
An overarching theme during the streak was
the team's reluctance to talk about it. Business
like as always, the focus was never on keeping up
the run.
"It never got talked about until this year."
Forood said. "It wasn't the focal point of our sea
sons at any point It was about winning in order to
play for the championships."
"During the streak no one really wanted to
talk about it," Yelsey said.
"Because we didn't bring a lot of attention to
it, the girls couldn't read too much into it." Bren
nan explained. "Some of them were aware of it.
and some of them weren't. We all talked to some
one at some point, though."
With the season over, though, the Cardinal
now has a chance to reflect on what it accom
plished. After not talking about it for years.
Forood, Yelsey and Brennan were all happy to
share their sentiments on the monumental
streak.
"It's always wonderful to be part of an amaz
ing accomplishment by a lot of people," Forood
said."lt took a lot of people to make this happen."
"It's exciting to me because of the fact that we
were able to win three team titles during that
run." Brennan said. "We had some really great
kids and players — not only talent-wise,but per
sonality-wise. Being on that journey with a good
group of student athletes and with Lele, I think
that made it extremely enjoyable."
Ihnugh Forood and Brennan will have fur
ther opportunities to bring the streak back to life
(the Cardinal went 19-0 up until the 4-2 loss to
UCLA). Yelsey, as a senior leaving the Farm after
four years and 110 team wins, will have to keep
the streak alive in memory.
"It's something that we're all going to
have...we realize that it was something special
and we're all happy to be a part of it,"she said."lt
was wonderful to play for a team that never ex
pected to lose, that had all this confidence and be
lief [in itself].
"It was special." Yelsey added. "There's no
other way to describe it."
