# Cardinal Tennis
## 89 WINS Coaches and players reflect on the amazing streak that was 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
January 18,1974 is one of the more famous days in college ath
letic history. On that day, UCLA basketball suffered a

stunning loss to Notre Dame, ending its epic 88-
game winning streak. It's a day that still resonates
for many — the mythical Bruins had finally
been toppled by the Fighting Irish.
February 3,2(X)7 is a date that doesn't stick out
as mueh in NCAA history. On this day, Stanford

women's tennis suffered its first loss since 2(X)3 in a 4-3
match to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. What many peo-

pic didn't know, though, was that the loss ended an 89-match win
ning streak — one up on John Wooden's legendary Bruins — built
in just over three years.
89 wins in a row.
Looking hack on it, it's almost hard to fathom.
Hie Cardinal concluded this past season 24-2 and made it to the
NCAA Championship semifinals. But Stanford's real crowning
glory this year was its final tally of 89 wins a row, dating back to its
loss in the 2003 NCAA title game to Florida.
The streak might just be the greatest ever in college athletics,
but the NCAA does not keep an official record of the most consec
utive wins by a team for various reasons: ties, disparities between
divisions and differences in the way that sports are recorded, to
name a few.
Nor is 89 wins definitively the most. Other programs, like North
Carolina's women's soccer team, have streaks that extend into the
triple digits. The Tar 1 leels tied in many games, though, while Stan
ford did not, so gauging a streak solely on its numerical value isn't
all that telling.
But in any case, the Cardinal's streak doesn't need a record to
validate itself. Led by head coach Lele Forood and players such as
Alice Barnes '06, Amber Liu'o6 and current seniors Theresa Logar

and Anne Yelsey (Liu and Barnes were with the team for all but
three of the 89 wins, while Yelsey and Logar were with the team in
all of them), Stanford's win streak included plenty of its own high
lights.
Only two of the matches were 4-3 decisions. That's how domi
nant the Cardinal was.
IWenty-seven of the victories were 7-0 sweeps. Another 18 were
6-1 decisions.
During the streak, the Cardinal captured three national titles.
Forood brought her personal total to live, while uppitig the
school's total to 15.The 10 other titles were all won by Frank Bi en
nan, father to current assistant coach Frankie Jr.
