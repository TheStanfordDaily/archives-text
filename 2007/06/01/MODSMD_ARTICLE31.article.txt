## Camarillo picked as diversity coordinator Hennessy introduces new faculty position 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
History Prof. Albert Camarillo
has been appointed Special Assistant
to the Provost for Faculty Diversity,a
newiv created position. President
John Hennessy announced the new
position at the Academic Council
meeting two weeks ago.
Camarillo, a scholar of Mexican-
American history and Chicano
studies, said he accepted the job be
cause he believes faculty diversity is
critical to the University's develop
ment.
"I see as a fundamental the goal
for every institution in American so
ciety in the 21st century to reflect as
much as possible the tremendous di
versity that is America," Camarillo
said in an email to The Daily. "Stan
ford is among the leading universi
ties in the world, and I see no reason
why it shouldn't be a leader in
achieving a more diverse faculty."
Hennessy applauded Camarillo's
selection.
"As a senior, long-term member
of the faculty, he knows both the in-

stitutions and his
colleagues well,"
Hennessy said in
an email to The
Daily. "These per
sonal relationships
and institutional
history will be
valuable. And he
was deeply com
mitted and willing

to dedicate his time and energy to
this important issue."
Camarillo will kick off his job by
searching for professors to fill the 10
faculty positions that Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 created to ex
pand the number of faculty members
working in race and ethnicity studies.
These new professors will be distrib
uted throughout various depart
ments and schools on campus and
will be affiliated with the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
"1 will also collaborate with school
deans and department chairs," Ca
marillo said, "as well as with faculty
search committees to ensure that the
recruitment of a diverse faculty is al
ways considered in all appointments
made across the University."
