## Parker owns Jules, 32-3 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
International observers decried
election fraud and voter intimida
tion in Managing Hditor of News
and Vice Deputy Premier Nick
Parker's ascent to power in The
Daily's capital of Storke yesterday.
Although Parker was officially
opposed by Jules R. Penguin. Pen
guin was denied a spot in official
debates and was left out of election
coverage by the state-owned.
I lohmann-controlled media.
"()h yeah. Penguin was 'running
against' Parker, but it's pretty much
a one-party system. There wasn't
much he could do." said one senior
official who was granted anonymi
ty because he feared retaliation for
spe;iking out against the new
guard.
The 35 voters in yesterday's
elections were confronted by a
confusing ballot, and members of
the police force ostensibly super
vised the vote for "security rea
sons' Votes were counted secretly,
and officials from the new Parker
administration later announced
that Parker swept 100 percent of
the vote. When Penguin campaign
managers asked for a recount, they
were denied.
"Jules' name wasn't even
spelled right on the ballot," said
Penguin campaign manager Betsy
Congdon, alleging that head copy
editor In Ho Lee purposely let the
mistake slip by. "He didn't have a
chance."
"Look, I don't want to be a con
spiracy theorist, but Ill just say that
Parker comes from a long line of

leaders,'" said Ben Eppler. a for
eign correspondent for The Daily.
"His father, his grandfather... there
was nothing unexpected about this
victory.'"
The fortunes of The Daily have
long been linked with those of the
powerful Parker family. The
youngest Parker's grandfather,
There was
nothing unex
pected about
this victory.
- Ben Eppler,
foreign correspondent
Vladimir llyich Parker, presided
over File Daily during a turbulent
period of reform and moderniza
tion during the 19305. Nick's father,
Leonid Parker, chaired The Daily's
Central Committee during the
height of an arms race with super
power rivalThe Harvard Crimson.
"To quote a previous reformer,
'We need the real, nationwide ter
ror which reinvigorates the country
and through which the Great
French Revolution achieved
glory,'" Parker proclaimed in his
acceptance speech.

James Hohmann, Parker's pred
ecessor, stood at his side, smiling
with a wide grin, during Parker's
acceptance speech.
"Nicholas Maynardovich Park
er represents the essence of the
revolutionary spirit, and 1 cannot
imagine another person as willing
to shed his own blood for the
preservation of our institution,"
Hohmann said in an address to the
party, shortly before fleeing from a
back fire escape. While he did not
immediately return calls seeking
comment, rumors abounded that
he has absconded to more welcom
ing harbors.
"I fear he crossed the border
into friendlier territory, if you know
what I mean " opined loyal citizen
Andrea Fuller between successive
shots of vodka. "He's gone where
editors in chief go to die. He'll
probably write a book and maybe
stage a coup when the coast clears.
He took out [former Editor in
Chief Patrick j Fitzgerald after all."
While official histories make
the victor's family credentials ap
pear impeccable, there is a dark
side to the Parker legacy.The elder
Parkers ruled with The Daily with
an iron fist, crushing insurrections
and restricting free speech by driv
ing out independent media com
petitors. Dozens of reporters were
relocated to "reeducation facili
ties" in faraway West Campus dur
ing the reign of Parker's father, an
experience for which many fami
lies still demand an official apology.
It has not been forthcoming.
"Oh yeah, the Parkers are great.
