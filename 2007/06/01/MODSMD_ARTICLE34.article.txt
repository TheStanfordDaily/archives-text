### GREG RISLING ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PERRIS. Califl — Grad Week at
Perris High School was supposed to
be about exchanging yearbooks, try
ing on caps and gowns and partying
with classmates on the annual senior
trip.
Instead, grief counselors were at
the Riverside County campus and a
memorial service was set for Friday
after four seniors were killed in a car
crash as they headed to San Diego for
a school-sponsored beach party.
"It hurts not having them
around," said 18-year-old Larry Bel
montes.
The four teens decided to take a
private car instead of a school bus on
the trip Wednesday to Mission Beach
in San Diego.The California 1 lighway
Patrol said their white 1993 Acura In
tegra apparently was racing a black
car at speeds up to 1 (K) mph on Inter
state 15 when the Acura swerved
right, went off the road and hit a tree
on the dirt shoulder. It was just before
2 p.m.
Pablo "Paul" Ruiz, 18, and Jose Es

pinosa, 18, were thrown from the car.
Espinosa was rushed to the hospital
where he died about 24 hours later.
Ruiz, along with Javier Aguayo, 17.
and Anthony O'Neil, 17, died at the
scene.
All were from Perris, a fast-grow
ing community about 72 miles south
east of Los Angeles.
On 'ITiursday, students scrawled
messages on memorial banners and
visited a corner of campus turned into
a shrine with candles and flowers and
photographs of the victims.
Friends and acquaintances re
membered their classmates as well
liked. outgoing and fun-loving. Ruiz
was on the wrestling team and had
planned to join the Marines after
graduating, while Aguayo was handy
with cars.
Friends said O'Neil. known by his
nickname "Cash," was a prankster
who liked to take risks.
Graduation was still scheduled for
Saturday, and students were trying to
figure out a way to pay tribute to their
classmates.
"Instead of throwing our caps into
the air, we're thinking about roses,"

said Viviane Macias, 18. "1 think the
guys would like that."
Macias was aboard one of two
school buses that came upon the crash
site Wednesday afternoon.
"Everybody recognized the car"
Macias said. "People started text
messaging and calling each other
about what happened."
Both buses returned to the school,
the beach trip forgotten.
It was unclear whether any of the
youths were wearing seat belts, CHP
spokesman Tom Kerns said Thursday
Kerns said one of the 17-year-olds
was at the wheel but he declined to
identify him.
Witnesses told CHP officers that
the teens were waving beer cans out
the window as they passed the high
school bus. and 42 opened and un
opened cans were found scattered
around the crash site. Kerns said.
The San Diego County medical
examiner will determine whether the
driver had been drinking.
Two years ago. during spring
break, a car crash claimed the lives of
four Perris 1 ligh School students, in
cluding three seniors.
