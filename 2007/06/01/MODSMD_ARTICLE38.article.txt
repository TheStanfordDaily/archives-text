## TrENDS in TV season finales 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION TIVOER 
A little over a month ago, I wrote an ar
ticle discussing some of the most anticipated
finales of this season of television. Now that
nearly all of them have aired, we can discuss
what happened in them. Mainly, I'll discuss
some of the common themes that I ob
served in this season's finales. If you're be
hind on your TV viewing, I recommend that
you stop reading now, as I will spoil every
thing for you (and 1 know people get very
testy when season finales are ruined for
them, as last year my friend Sarah let out a
shriek loud enough to put Stanford's collec
tive Primal Scream to shame when she
learned prematurely that Marissa was fated
to die on "The OC").
Trend #1: Doctors are self-destructive.
On "Scrubs," perfectly nice (and attrac
tive) Keith proposes to Elliot. J.D. is in the
process of mending his relationship with
Kim. who is incidentally the mother of his
unborn child. How do things end? J.D. ends

up in bed with Elliot posing the question of
whether or not they are perfect for one an
other. We are left to wonder if anything
naughty follows...
Then, on "Grey's Anatomy." nothing
went right for anyone (except perhaps Cal
lie, the newly minted Chief Resident, if you
ignore the fact that she is a cuckquean —
look it up, it's my new favorite word).
George failed his intern exam. Izzie profess
es her love to George and he doesn't really
respond —an effective "whatever". Mc-
Dreamy practically dares Meredith to
dump him (and the week before flirted with
whom the finale insinuated to be yet — get
this — yet another half-sister of Mered
ith's). Bailey doesn't get the chief resident
job. Alex decides to profess his love for
Eva/Rebecca/Jane Doe, but she's already
gone. Lastly, and most importantly. Burke
left Christina at the altar and disappeared (1
imagine whether or not he returns depends
on whether or not ABC decides to forgive
Dr. Homophobia).
Trend #2: Stuff didn't blow up.

So I haven't seen any of this season of
"24," but a Television Without Pity summa
ry revealed to me that the Russians called
off an attack on some U.S. base somewhere.
No bombs. Then, on "Heroes," Peter Pe
trelli did not blow up, as he promised us he
would for nearly all of the season (and was
anybody else less than moved when he went
back in time and the dying dude told him
that all he needed was love?).
Trend #3: People didn't get (or passed up)
their promotions.
On "The Office," Michael didn't get his
job at Corporate. Instead, he sweetly de
fended a strangely, suddenly crazy Jan. This
did mean however that when he returned to
Scranton he basically pretended that he had
forgotten that he had offered his job to poor
Dwight. Additionally, Jim passed up the
Corporate job because he realized yet again
that he kind of, sort of likes Pam. As 1 al
ready mentioned above. Bailey lost out on
the chief resident job to Callie on "Grey's."
Additionally, McDreamy passed up the
Chief of Surgery job that Webber offered

him.
(I wish I had Ihe luxury of passing up all
of these offers like these characters do.
Heck, I wish 1 had offers to pass up!)
Trend #4: Every favorite that was predicted
to win their respective reality show did.
Jordin is the new American Idol. I
watched a sum total of 10 minutes of this
season of Idol and 1 was still unsurprised to
learn that she had won. Jaslene is the next
Top Model. In the words of my roommate's
boyfriend, "She's the least busted out of all
of them." Jaslene was objectively the pretti
est, so she won. Asia is the next Pussycat
Doll (no kids, Azia Kim is not the next
Pussycat Doll, this is a different Asia).
While I was routing for Chelsea — she at
tended my high school — everyone knew
she wasn't the best dancer. Melissa R.
looked too much like the main Pussycat
Doll, Nicole something or other (this at
least was my hypothesis). This left Asia,
whom the judges had clearly been favoring
the whole time anyway. No surprises on any
of these shows!
