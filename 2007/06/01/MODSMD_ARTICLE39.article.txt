## Buble is absolutely bubbling with delight 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION CD EXPERT 
Michael Buble came from humble beginnings.
The son of a salmon and herring fisherman, the
young singer would stay with his jazz-aholic Ital
ian grandfather while his parents were gone
(Michael is of full Italian heritage, and the name
Buble is Italian as well.) It was his grandfather
who introduced Michael to Bobby Darin, Dean
Martin, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and Elvis
Presley, after whom Michael would model him
self. A plumber by trade, it was also his grandfa
ther who landed Michael his earliest gigs in ho
tels. bars and lounges by trading his plumbing
services for stage time.
All of his grandfather's toilet plunges were to
avail, however. Buble's self-titled debut album
of jazz standards, released in 2003 reached the
top 10 in Buble's home country of Canada, and
introduced the Vancouver native onto the inter
national music scene. Two years later Buble re
leased his sophomore album, "It's Time," which
went multi-platinum, debuted in the U.S. in the
top 10 on Billboard and, quite amazingly, stayed
on the Traditional Jazz Charts for over two
years. Buble's latest and third studio release,
"Call Me Irresponsible" (2007), debuted at #1
on the U.S. Billboard charts and has since be
come the number one selling album worldwide.
Although Buble has enjoyed increasing com
mercial success with each album, he commented
that he was terrified to release "Irresponsible"
because, "I knew it had to be better than the first

two-that it had to show growth without alienat
ing anyone, and that's a tough line."
Although Buble almost exclusively sings jazz
standards, he is also a song-writer. In fact his first
number one song in Canada was "Home," an
original song from his second album. "Irrespon
sible," contains two original songs-which are
perhaps the two best songs on the CD — the

pop-pier, love-happy "Everything" and
the sorrowful, lamenting "Lost." Buble
originally intended his I'm-in-love
"Everything" to be a slow waltz, but
when he heard his musical director ex
perimenting with an upped tempo and
tone, he felt the song was

transformed into a superioi
bubblier iteration. Surprising
ly, the lilting waltz rhythm stil
serves as the backbone to
the song, however, and can
especially be heard in the
acoustic guitar riffs. Buble
stated the song reflects the
giddiness and excitement
of new love he was experi
encing at the time, and that
in its final form, "Every
thing" has become a
"love note — light with a
bouncy tune." Oppositely
themed, "Lost" was writter

after a painful break-up. Buble
said the song was about the pain
of loving someone after a relation-

ship has ended and refers to it as an "anthem for
star-crossed lovers."

On the rest of "Irresponsible," Bubld inter
prets and revisits famous classics, including the
ever-sweet "L-O-V-E," the tender "Wonderful
Tonight" and the sultry "Me and Mrs. Jones,"
where a younger man sings about the affair he is
having with an older, married woman. Buble de
mands to be held and kissed in the in the

saucy salsa-inspired "It Had Better Be
Tonight," and then breaks your heart in
the soft, regretful and heart-felt. "Al
ways on My Mind." Backed by a full
gospel choir in "That's Life," Buble in-

spires us to try again, only to se
duce us in the too-sexy, appro

jriately saxophone-heavy,
"I'm Your Man." In a rather
surprising but wonderful
duet with Boyz II Men,
"Comin" Home Baby" is a
smooth, modern-sound
ing jazz love song. At the
beginning of the old
school "I've Got the
112 World on a String." the
entire big band sings out
"Hey Michael, come on
and swing, look's like
you've got the world on a
string," and they later hoot,
leckle, clap and shout "He's
love, he's in love" through
i the rest of the song. Al-

though Buble admitted this standard was never
a favorite of his, he lauds his musical arranger for
making it the most fun track he recorded on the
album.
In addition to Buble's powerhouse voice, he
is a showman, to boot. Whether he is divulging
in a TV interview how he drank too much at
Leonardo DiCaprio's house or cat-walking in a
mock modeling show during a live concert, he is
a genuinely funny guy. As a child. Buble idolized
Presely and Sinatra for being "triple threats,"
able to sing, dance and act. and in this classic de
finition of an entertainer. Buble is much more
than just a singer. The ever-charismatic Buble
struts, dances and cracks jokes as if he were born
to perform.
Granted, jazz standards tend to drip with
dorky romanticism and sappy sentimentalism.
But it's the kind of emotional schmaltziness you
can't deny — your foot starts tapping, your
heart starts swelling, you start singing along and
before you know it, you are feeling Buble's bro
ken heart right along with him. Buble's unbe
lievable voice shines and seduces, the instru
mental arrangements inspire, and the original
songs leave you thanking god for Repeat on
iTunes. Michael can allay his fears, for "Call Me
Irresponsible" is undeniably his best album yet,
and unquestionably one of the best of year.
Download: Really, you need the entire
album. If I had to pick: "Lost," "Everything,"
"I've Got the World on a String." "It Had Bet
ter Be Tonight," "I'm Your Man," "Me and
Mrs. Jones"
