Regatta. The team went through a
position switch-up in recent weeks,

East-Coast competition.
The No. 8 Cardinal challenged
second-ranked Harvard to the final
second — 0.227 seconds, to be exact

national title.
ITiough the Crimson came into
the heat as an easy favorite, the un

Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian, it was closer than the
5:36.361 and 5:36.588 stop times in-
