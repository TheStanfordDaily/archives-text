# Men nearly top Crimson
## Crew gets off to stellar start at IRA Regatta MEN'S CREW 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's crew was hard to
recognize yesterday at the Intercol
legiate Rowing Association (IRA)
Regatta. The team went through a
position switch-up in recent weeks,
hut that wasn't what surprised the
East-Coast competition.
The No. 8 Cardinal challenged
second-ranked Harvard to the final
second — 0.227 seconds, to be exact
— in the first-round heat, as Stan
ford began a promising run for the
national title.
ITiough the Crimson came into
the heat as an easy favorite, the un
derdog Cardinal kept up, staying
within a quarter of a second from
the first 500 meters of the 2,000-
meter race. The eights were even
down the stretch, and according to
Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian, it was closer than the
5:36.361 and 5:36.588 stop times in-

GAME NOTES; The Cardinal fin
ished just fractions of a second
behind the heavily favored Har
vard squad in its heat, and will
move on to the first semifinal
today at noon EST. Stanford also
finished less than a second be
hind Washington, which notched
the fastest time of the day in their
race.
dicate less than a foot separated Stanford and
liarvard.
"We both advanced, though, so it's not an issue."
Amerkhanian said. "It's only a confidence boost for
us to know that we can race a quality opponent like
1 larvard down the stretch."
Stanford outdid its closest competitor, No. 10
Michigan, by nearly eight seconds, as the Wolverines
notched a 5:48.282 time and a spot in the consolation
repechage.
"It was all mental "Amerkhanian said."We came
in with a positive attitude and a solid plan,and we ex
ecuted. This puts us in a good position for the semifi

nals."
Coming out of the gate strong, the Cardinal gar
nered the third-fastest time of the day, behind only
Harvard and its top-ranked, Pacific-10 Conference
rival. Washington, The Huskies were a narrow 0.41
seconds ahead of the Crimson,clocking in at 5:35.951
to win their heat.
Today, Stanford will have the chance to face un
defeated Washington once again after falling short of
the Huskies twice this season, at the Stanford-hosted
Windermere Classic and at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. Also in the Cardinal's noon EST semifinal
heat are Michigan (advancing after winning its

repechage). No. 5 Princeton, No. 11 Cornell and No.
15 Northeastern.
The 1 luskies are the team to beat — or at least to
keep up with — but Stanford looks to compete at its
own newly quickened pace.
"Three advance, so we just need to race our own
race," Amerkhanian said. "If we make it all about
Washington, we'll get out of our plan. Tomorrow's
just about building off of today and taking the inten
sity we had to a new level."
