# The
						end: Or at Least music that says it is
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION AWESOMENESS 
In direct support of society's desire to mimic
the media it produces, students may as well
begin casting about for the best song to play in
their own mental montages of the inevitable, the
impending, the next week (!): the end. Images of
friends loading their things into shuttles and
guys making that excruciating last-second deci
sion about whether or not to hug just aren't com
plete — especially in retrospect — without that
perfect song to tic the whole experience up in a
way that only music can.
This is no new idea, and so-called "gradua
tion songs" arc a dime a dozen these days. Yes.
I'm looking at you. Vitamin C and Green Day.
Baz Lurman has been telling grads to wear sun
screen for exactly 10 years now (check out
William S. Burroughs' "Advice For Young Peo
ple").
Compiling a list of songs with the word "end"
explicitly in the title seems to offer a more rigor
ous criterion for these montage enders. 1 lowev
er, searching for songs with the word "end' in
the title results in an interesting spectrum of mu
sical assertions. Mixed in between songs at
tempting to be cute about massage parlors
("Uappv Ending") and others that are just being
cmo about a particularly tragic relationship

("True Love Will Find You in the End"), there
arc some tracks that actually channel the ab
solute finality of the end in its most apocalyptic
sense. While these jazzy numbers arc often not
directly referential to gradation per se, the over
riding theme of apocalypse fits well. Rhetorical
ly, graduation and apocalypse are interchange
able anyway, at least from where I'm sitting.
A vast majority of the songs 1 downloaded
with the word "end" in the title had to be delet
ed immediately, for fear that someone browsing
my iTunes library would judge me based on my
propensity for death metal. There is something
undeniably attractive about an "end" song, yet
also pretentious. By attempting to simultane
ously announce and describe the termination of
something, the artist assumes the position of
God and at the same time a reporter on the God
beat, waiting to dispatch the four horsemen of
the apocalypse as well as write about it. I've
come up with a list of my favorites, as well as
some others that arc laughable. Watch out. Ed
ward Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance," be
cause the end is, well, the end is in.
First of all. The Doors' "The End" (1967) is,
hands down, the greatest "end" song of all time.
It's an epic, apocalyptic, mildly Oedipal allegory
of Jim Morrison's experience with some potent
hallucenogenics and his rambling societal phi
losophy. I know, I know: awesome. If you really

want to trip yourself out, take an auditory gan
der at the cover by Warhol muse Nico.
"It's the End of the World as We Know 11
(And I Feel Fine)" (1988) by R.E.M. — a song
perhaps ironically best known for that scene in
Independence Day where the researchers first
pick up an evil alien transmission — is another
solid choice on your "end" playlist. There's a
nice element of relaxation and the added "I Feel
Fine" is about as comforting as it gets. As an

added trivia bonus, this is the inaugural "white
guy singing facetious lyrics fast" song, laying the
foundation for future stream of consciousness
classics such as the Barenaked Ladies' "One
Week."
The Strokes play the apocalypse off as
some sort of "would you rather" question
in "The End Has No End" (2003). It's stan
dard Strokes fare. Balance that out with some
thing positive like The Avons' "Our Love Will
Never End" (1995) or "Dance Me To the End of
Love" (2004) by Madeleine Peyroux. Or any-

thing by Peyroux for (hat matter, she's jusl
incendiary. While you're at it, play "This is
the Song that Doesn't End" by Lamb
Chop, hut only for nostalgia.
On "The Little Miss Sunshine" (2(X)6)
soundtrack, the band Dcvotchka adds
two great tracks to the canon of end tunes 1
with "Till The End of Time" and "How It

Ends." The songs are really southwestern and
— as the placement on this soundtrack would
suggest — ideal for both driving in general as
well as driving into a sunset.
"The End," a Beatles song off of "Abbey
Road" (1%9) takes a close second to the Doors.
The Beatles really know how to end an album
and although the track is mostly instrumental,
the only lyrics are heart stoppers. "And in the
end, the love you take/ is equal to the love you

make." What a
message to
leave
v someone
with.
