# Ending a volume on famous endings
## 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION ENDER 
The school year is drawing to a close. How does
this particular finale compare to famous
ends throughout history? Let's take
a sampling.

End of the Napoleonic Wars.
Wellington's defeat of Napoleon marked
the end of the French domination of the Euro
pean continent and a period of political chaos. The
most heavily romanticized conqueror in modern history
was vanquished. Napoleon contemplated another battle,
but later declared, "Alas, I have dared only too much al
ready." He lives on in the French collective and visu
al memory, however. His "tomb" in Paris is the
size of a cathedral.

End
of "'Harry Potter." The seventh
book is due to drop this summer, and mil
lions of young'uns will be up past their bedtime
for the midnight release. And that doesn't include
millions of high school and college students, and people
with jobs. There are still three movies left to be re
leased, however, and eventually, their remakes. Will
one of the main characters be killed off? The
world waits in suspense.

End
of "The OC." The public
may not remember this finale as much
as "Seinfeld" or "M*A*S*H," but that does
n't mean it's not important. The former cultural
behemoth's abbreviated final season ended with a
whimper, not a bang, but we witnessed the end of
Seth Cohen and Summer Roberts, and the be
ginning of many knockoffs (starting with
"Hidden Palms," apparently).

of the Bush presidency.
It hasn't happened yet, but bar
ring impeachment or a resignation,
we only have a year and a half left.
It can't come soon enough.

to remember his second retirement,
when he hit that final jumper against Utah
to win, and then that magnificent leap and
fist-pump. Those two later seasons with the
Washington Wizards were nonsense
and tarnished his legacy.

End
of "Titanic." Much like the
Bush presidency, this end should
have come far sooner than it did. The film
somehow stretched to three hours despite a
near-total lack of plot (ship hits iceberg, ship
sinks) or interesting reactions between the
characters. And DiCaprio took an
interminably long to die, despite it seem
ing inevitable from the first scene
of the film.

End of the Cold War. The
war that spawned "Dr. Strangelove"
and endless iterations of "Rocky" finally
came to end in 1989, or a couple of years after,
depending on who you ask. The fall of the Berlin
Wall was a hugely symbolic moment for millions
of people around the globe, enabling them to
drink Coca-Cola and sell their assets to
oil barons in peace.
