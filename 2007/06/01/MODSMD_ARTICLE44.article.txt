## A final Palo Alto restaurant overview
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION RESTAURANT EXPERT 
Whenever 1 pass Andale Mexican restaurant in down
town Palo Alto, 1 always feel a bit of jealousy of the people
sitting in the outside patio, sipping on a margarita or crunch
ing on some chips with salsa. I then go on to tell myself that
the next time I'm in Palo Alto, 1 will eat there. However,
most times, I forget about Andale until I am actually in Palo
Alto, and usually by that time, I have unfortunately settled
on eating at a different restaurant. But, after hearing that this
would be the last restaurant review of the year, I was deter
mined to try Andale Mexican restaurant, a modern taqueria
with outdoor seating and a fun atmosphere that's been voted
"Best of Palo Alto" for Mexican food. 1 am not generally a
huge Mexican food fan, but 1 will admit that I am now a big
fan of Andale. With fast service (order at the counter, they
bring the food over to the table), decent prices (only $1 more
than Chipotle) and authentic Mexican food, Andale is one of
my new favorite places in town.
To start with, we ordered the homemade chips and deli
ciously spicy salsa, which was a good start to our meal, but
nothing extraordinary. However, our entrees were what
made us really happy. Both the mesquite chicken and the
mesquite grilled steak
burrito, com
ing with

smoked
meat, rice,
pinto beans,
guacamole, sour
cream and cheese, were tresh and delightiul. Alone, the dif

fercnt ingredients were nothing special. But, complimenting
each other in a perfectly sized flour tortilla, the different in
gredients turned into one, big, mouth-watering burrito. The
fajitas, coming with three corn tortillas, meat, rice, beans,
onions, bell peppers, guacamolc and salsa, was basically a
burrito divided up into three parts that you assembled your
self. The four different salsas in the salsa bar (two hot and
two mild) were all unique and fresh. Everything we tried,
from the fajitas to the quesadillas, was healthy tasting and
delicious, a combination you don't often find in a quick-ser
vice Mexican restaurant. (Granted, the last burrito I had was
in the dining hall, so by comparison, this restaurant did not
have much competition). In addition, with its clean tables,
delicious aroma, beautiful outdoor patio and friendly ser
vice, Andale's atmosphere was freshly inviting.
I won't go so far as to say that Andale's food is the best
Mexican food 1 have ever eaten in my entire life. But, its
combination of good south of the border fare, decent prices,
comfortable environment and fast service make it a fun
place to go if you have one of those ever too common bur- J
rito cravings.
