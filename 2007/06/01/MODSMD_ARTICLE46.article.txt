## Dear Roxy... Your questions answered 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
As the year goes by, Roxy is fairly accustomed
to receiving emails asking her sex-goddesslv self
for advice — sometimes, as you will see, of a
rather personal nature. In her last column of the
year. Roxy has taken the opportunity to re
spond to some of those desperate pleas. Here,
for the benefit of Stanford students, are Roxy's
favorite letters and replies. Roxy feels that
these issues apply to many students on the Stan
ford campus, so she hopes this column is useful
to you when she must leave you on your own
this summer!
Dear Roxy,
I've wanted to hook up with this one girl since
freshman year. She was in my IHUM section,
but I just never worked up the courage. What
should I do?
• Sex-Deprived Senior
Dear ALL sex-deprived seniors.
Too easy! Seniors, this is your last chance to
conquer that fine piece of Stanford ass after
which you've always lusted. Go for it! And if
you get drunk enough, neither one of you will
even remember come class reunion.

Dear Roxy,
Talking about
sex makes
me really
uncom
fort-

able. Reading your column makes me cry some
times late at night. Please stop.
• Scarred for Life
Dear Scarred,
Do yourself a favor and stop reading my col
umn. And. while you're at it, consider growing
up. How do you think you got
here?
• Roxy
Dear Roxy,
Sometimes I feel like my
roommate is trying to pro
tect my non-existent virginity.
When I have guys over, she
talks to us about heaven and
hell and refuses to leave the
room for hours. What should I
do? 4
• Frustrated

down to business. Write back if you discover
some of your own.
• Roxy

Dear Roxv,
k Some of your

suggestions to make sex sexier just seem so far
out there. Do people really do that stuff?
• Dubious Doubter
Dear Dubious,
Yes. Well, Roxy knows at least one person does
that stuff because it's her' Rut, really, most peo

seem the most serious during the day. Think
about that next time you're interviewing for a
job.
• Roxy

Will you have sex with me?
• Please?
