coach Conrad Ray said. "They have
a team comprised of many veteran
golfers. ITieir guys have had some
success at previous championships
and are no stranger to big tourna
ments like this â€” they are a good
opponent. Tomorrow, our guys just
need to play the tougher holes a lit
tler bit better,sink a few more putts,
and we should be in the clear."
Rounding out the current top five
at the NCAA Championships are
Coastal Carolina (558; two under
par). East Tennessee State (560; even
par) and Charlotte (562; two over
par).
Among the Cardinal golfers, jun
ior Rob Grube fell two spots from
his first-place pedestal the day be
fore. Grube shot a one-over-par 71
in the second round, giving him a
five-under 135 overall to be mired in

a four-way tie for third.
Unfortunately for Grube and the
Cardinal, many of the best of the
best in the nation have seemingly
woken up from their first-round
slumber. Bronson LeCassie of Min
nesota seized the top individual spot
of the tournament with an eight
under 132 while Vanderbilt's Jon
Curran is only one stroke in front of
the third-place hopefuls with a six
under 134.
Senior Zack Miller's meteoric
rise, however, somewhat offset the
Cardinal's overall decline. Miller
jumped 15 places to go into tomor
row's rounds in a tie for 14th; he
picked up four birdies to finish day
two with a one-under 69 and one
under 139 overall.
Sophomore Daniel Lim. on the
other hand, fell 14 spots into a tie for
29th. I le shot a two-over-par 72 yes
terday,giving him a one-over-par 141
overall.
Senior Matt Savage rose 22 places
since the first round, concluding yes
terday's action in a tie for 44th. Sav

age had an even-par 70 in the second
round (142 overall). Rounding out
the Cardinal's attack was freshman
Joseph Bramlett. who improved sig
nificantly following the first round.
Bramlett jumped 42 spots and ended
the day in a tie for 102 nd after firing a
two-under 68 (146 overall).
With so much movement in the in
dividual competition, the NCAA
team championship is more difficult
to predict than ever.The Cardinal can
only hope that conditions will be con
ducive to good scoring in tomorrow's
round so that the team can effectively
defend its first-place position.
"Today was a solid day," Ray
said. "We had a slow start with a re
ally good rally in the middle. The
guys posted some solid scores that
work out with our position. ITie
championship is still up for grabs,
though. The guys are anxious to see
what happens, and we look forward
to today's rounds."
