## Maybe I really only need half my brain... 
### 
Hundreds of people are walk
ing around with literally
half a brain.
A radical procedure in which
doctors remove an entire hemi
sphere of a person's brain is some
times necessary in cases of incapac
itating epilepsy. A recent study re
ported on dozens of people who re
ceived hemispherectomies at Johns
Hopkins over the last 30 years. Get
this: They're all fine.
The study describes chess cham
pions. bowling stars and successful
college students. All of the patients
have lost function in the hand op
posite their missing hemisphere,
and have no sight in that half of
their field of vision. However, most
are seizure-free, and their drastic
brain surgery seems to have had no
effect on their learning, memory or
personality. On the whole, it seems
having a complete brain is pretty
much optional.
1 guess 1 should be impressed
with the power and plasticity of the
human brain. But it just seems sort
of—l don't know — creepy. If 1
only really need half my brain, what
is the rest of it doing all the time?
Napping? Thinking about CSI re
runs? Plotting against me?
My suspicions that the brain is
not to be trusted are confirmed by a
litany of bizarre neurological con
ditions.
Anosognosia is an impressive
word for a strange disease, in his
book "Descartes' Error," neurolo
gist Antonio Damasio describes the
1975 case of Supreme Court Justice
William Douglas. A debilitating
stroke left him confined to a wheel
chair, paralyzed on his left side.
Against medical advice. Justice
Douglas checked himself out of the
hospital, dismissing reports of his
paralysis as "a myth." and publicly
invited reporters to go hiking with
him.
Douglas, like other patients with
anosognosia, was completely un
aware of his injury. He went so far
as to claim he was kicking 40-yard
field goals with his paralyzed leg.
Clearly delusional, Douglas was
forced to retire from the Supreme
Court.
In addition to accompanying
paralysis, anosognosia can come
along with blindness. Blind anosog
nosics spend their days bumping
into walls and furniture, all the
while insisting they can see just
fine.
'Hie list of neurological terrors
goes on. Sufferers of Capgras syn
drome believe that their friends

and loved ones have been replaced
by identical-looking imposters.
Psychiatrist Joseph Capgras, who
christened the disorder, described
the case of one woman who be
lieved not only that her husband
was an imposter, but that the im
posters themselves were being con
tinually replaced! She believed her
husband had been swapped out
over 80 times.
Prosopagnosia, described mem
orably in Oliver Sacks' "The Man
Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat."
means inability to recognize faces.
The titular character could recog
nize his family and friends by their
voices, but had no idea what their
faces looked like. He saw faces
where none existed, and went
around saluting doorknobs and
patting fire hydrants on the head.
In the doctor's office, his wife was
standing next to the hat rack where
he'd left his hat. Mistaking her face
for his hat. he tried to lift it off her
neck and place it on his head.
The most horrifying thing to me
about these disorders is that suffer
ers are so convinced that they're
right. Their brains have fooled
them utterly.
Turns out your brain fools you,
too. A striking example comes with
so-called split-brain experiments,
described by Steven Pinker in "The
Blank Slate." As a treatment for se
vere epilepsy, doctors can actually
