Rumor has it that both minorities and
women 'have it made' in the job market. Is
that really true? Only partially, according to
industry and placement sources.
D. L. Wormley. assistant at the director
of Liberal Arts Placement, at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, scoffed at
that notion.
"It's a myth to some degree," she said.
"Sure, businesses are eager to have minori
ties and women. The question is, however,
once you get your foot in the door, the rest
can be fairly unpredictable.
On the subject of women. Wormley is
optimistic.
"Business and industry are interested in
women, especially Stanford women," she
notes.
There are, she claims, 15-20 percent
more women than men registered with the
liberal arts divisions of the CPPC.
"Overall." states Wormley, "Stanford
women seem more interested in business,
which makes sense, given the current eco
nomic situation in this country."
I"he recruiting office in charge of mi
norities and women for a local electronics
firm, said that of the 30.000 employees
abut 45 percent are women, primarily em
ployed ion clerical or production line
work, and about 20 percent of them were
minorities working mainly in clerical,
maintenance, or production line capaci
ties.
The goal of what is termed "affirmative
action policy," is to increase the number of
qualified minorities and women in the pro
fessional and managerial levels of the com
pany. The biggest disparity, the spokesman
noted, is between this goal and reality.
To encourage the interest of minorities
and women, the company offers a variety of
employment opportunities. There are sum
mer programs for training and employing
minorities, as well as "co-op" programs of
alternate work and study.
He noted that minorities seldom use the
services of a placement center. In fact, re
cruitment officers will often bypass place
ment offices and go directly to student or
ganizations. Such groups as the Society of
Women Engineers, or various pre-profes
sional groups for minorities are sources of
qualified human capital.
He stated that minorities are very con
cerned about upward mobility in a job.
"A minority candidate," he noted, "is
usually not too excited about being placed
in a small arm of a firm out in the boonies."
Industry has to establish credibility in rela
tion to minorities; sincere efforts and com
mitments must be made to get minorities
and women in positions of advancement, he
said.
