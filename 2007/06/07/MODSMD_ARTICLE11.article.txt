## Street View: A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT? 
### JESSICA FISHELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new innovation by Internet tech behemoth Google has
rekindled the age old debate about the limits of privacy.
The application,called Street View, launched on May 29 as
part of Google Maps. So far. it's only available in New York.
Miami. Denver, Las Vegas, and the San Francisco Bay Area.
Going a step beyond the bird's-eye satellite imager)' already
available. Street View allows a user to navigate the streets
with 360-degree, high-resolution panorama.
Overall, students were enthusiastic at the application's
technological prowess, but had reservations about whether
the application violates expectations of privacy. Two pic
tures brought the debate close to home.
When Wired Magazine's online blog began hosting a
challenge to find interesting photos on Street View, users
posted many somewhat-incriminating pictures. Among
photos of people urinating onto public sidewalks, scaling
buildings and standing in front of strip clubs, pictures of
Stanford undergraduates in trunks and bikinis have risen to
the top of the popularity-based rankings.
One of the popular pictures, featuring two bikini-clad
girls in front of Castano. unnerved many students.
"If I were one of those girls, I probably wouldn't be too
happy that anyone with an Internet connection could see me
in my bathing suit when all I wanted to do was get some sun
on a lazy afternoon," wrote Christian Tom '09, a Daily edito
rial board member, in a post on the Unofficial Stanford Blog.
Tom is reserved about its benefits.
"As cool as it is to go online and be able to say, 'Hey,
that's where I live!' there's something pretty unnerving

about looking closer and realizing there's someone you
know in the picture," Tom said.
A counter-argument points out that the camera only
takes pictures of what is in public anyway. The images are
captured from public-access roads by an 1 l-lens panoram
ic video camera mounted on a van.
"This imagery is no different from what any person can
readily capture or see walking down the street." said
Google spokeswoman Megan Quinn in a statement.
Alex Song *09 agreed.
" 1 really don't think there is an invasion of privacy here,"
he said, "because they're lying out in the open."
Despite these reservations, students say that the applica
tion offers genuine utility.
"Just last week 1 was able to use it to find a place where
I had an interview,"said BrianTse'o9."l was abletosee ex

actly what the building looked like, and the buildings
around it. too."
Google has also attempted to mollify privacy concerns
by allowing photographic subjects who are uncomfortable
with their image on the database to request its removal.
"But does that mean you have to mind your own data and
constantly be on the lookout for new pictures?" Tom asked.
if there's an incriminating picture of you online," said
Silas Johnson '09, "it's because you did something incrimi
nating in public."
Tom still expressed concerns about the changing ideas
of privacy as technology advances.
"It represents the extent to which technology is perva
sive in people's lives," he said.

Users of Google's recently unveiled Street View appli
cation can see clear shots of Stanford students sun
bathing in bikinis on the lawn. Some find it unnerving,
while others see it as useful.
