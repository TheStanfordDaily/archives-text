# Life: not all fun and games
## 
### 
Nothing blends alcohol and music
more artfully then the Power Hour:
Shot after shot of beer is raised
then downed-every sixty seconds as a dif
ferent song blinks by. Last weekend,
around shot number 45 of such a celebra
tion, Jim Jones's "We Fly High" began, and
suddenly, the crowd erupted in a single
word: "BALLIN!"
Naturally, this got me thinking about
linguistics. Where, I wondered, had we
picked this word up? And why'?
Rap lyrics contain a whole world of for
eign words, some rooted in African Ameri
can Vernacular English (AAVE). others
the creations of the artists themselves. Yet,
in spite of the bridge between dialects that
rap has created, only a handful of these
words ever cross over.
Languages typically borrow words
when there is a linguistic vacuum — a need
to express something for which the lan
guage has no word. Terms for new technol
ogy, for example, are often adopted by
other languages; instead of inventing a new
word at random, speakers simply choose to
incorporate the name already given. "Tele
phone" in Spanish is telefono\ in Hawaiian,
it's kelepona. Other times, a language will
absorb a foreign word capturing a unique
emotion or concept. Afrikaans gave us
apartheid, while the French kindly lent us
their ennui.
Do the words lent to us by AAVE fill a
linguistic vacuum? Few other words can

denote "player" status, though "man
whore" comes close — admittedly, with a
different connotation. "Ballin"' and
"game," however, can easily be replaced
with words like "awesome" and "skill."

What is it about these game words, then,
that resonates so deeply within us?
To us. it seems, life, love and sex are all
just a big game. Conceptual metaphors like
these color our understanding of the

world, and they are everywhere, slipping
into our lexicon wholly unnoticed. Arguing
with others, we speak in terms of war: We
"shoot down" our opponent's claims while
"defending" our own. Discussing morality,
we use height — applauding "upstanding"
citizens and condemning "low" tricks.
On the surface, the basketball metaphor
seems perfectly natural. In life and in ro
mance, there will always be those who mas
ter the game with ease. But who says there
are winners and losers? Who says it's a
zero-sum game?
Our generation is far more competitive
than any other before us. In our childhood,
we watched as admissions rates to the na
tion's elite colleges dwindled to single digits.
The divorce rate reached an all-time high.
Everywhere we turn, our prospects look
slim, and we wonder what our future will
hold. Even as Stanford students, love and
success often seem far beyond our grasp.
But neither life nor love is mere compe
tition. Our peers are not our opponents,
nor are their victories our setbacks. It takes
luck, and it takes skill, but it's not all just a
game. So maybe it's time we make good on
our loan, and give these borrowed words
back.
