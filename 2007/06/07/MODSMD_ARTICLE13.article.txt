## Hoover regarded fondly in Belgium Former president organized relief mission for Belgium during WWI 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LEUVEN, Belgium â€” With his presidency tarred
by the Great Depression, Herbert Hoover '1895 is a
scapegoat in the United States. I lis substantial human
itarian accomplishments, however, are not forgotten in
Belgium, which remembers him for his efforts in
wartime relief, postwar reconstruction and leadership
ot an organization that continues to promote relations
between the two countries.
Hoover is especially honored in the university city of
Leuven, 17 miles east of Brussels, which constructed
Herbert Hooverplein (Herbert Hoover Plaza) adja
cent to the library he helped rebuild after the First
World War.
In the first strokes of World War I, the German army
executed the Schlieffen Plan, which sought to outflank
the French army by crossing through neutral Belgium.
Ibis blatant disregard for an international treaty â€”
which one German official referred to as "a scrap of
paper" â€” enraged the British, who almost immediate
ly declared war on Germany.
Belgian resistance against an army ten times its size
was instrumental in preventing a quick defeat at the
hands of the Third Reich, but the country suffered ter
ribly: Germany destroyed Belgian forts in the north of
the country and shelled the western city of Ypres to rub
ble. The crisis continued throughout the war, as the
British navy's blockade of the North Sea threatened to

starve the country

Leuven itself became a symbol for German military
brutality. Mistaking a friendly-fire incident for Leuven
snipers, German troops gave into paranoia about Bel
gian guerrillas (fruncs-tireurs) and terrorized the city.
More than a thousand buildings in the city's inner ring
were set ablaze, and allegations of systematic killing of
civilians in reprisals surfaced. Soldiers also set fire to the
city's world-famous university library and its 3(X),(XX) vol
umes.
After arranging for the safe return of over 1(X),(XK)
Americans stranded in Europe, I loover organized the
Commission for the Relief of Belgium (C'RB).
Shipping supplies across the Atlantic Ocean was a
risky operation due to the German practice of sinking
Allied merchant ships. (It was this policy of unrestrict
ed submarine warfare that eventually brought the
United States into the war in l l )17.)
1 loover traveled to Berlin to lobby German author
ities and worked with Belgian leaders to distribute re
sources throughout the country. At the end of the war.
Hoover assisted American relief efforts in central Eu
rope.
Hie former president also insisted that the C'RB's
surpluses, in excess of $33 million, be bequeathed to the
Belgian people and especially towards education. The
Belgian American Education Foundation (BAEF) was
thus established, distributing money to six Belgian uni
versities and technical schools. Other monies were used
to fund student-exchange fellowships between Bel
gium and the United States, a program that still exists
today.
The remaining endowment was used for the rebuild
ing of two libraries â€” including the one in Leuven.

Students frequent the University library above in Leuven, Belgium. More than 90 years after World War I, Belgians
still highly regard former U.S. President Herbert Hoover for relief packages and education funding during war.
American architect Whitney Warren was
recruited to design the building, and a per
sonal fundraising effort by 1 loover helped
finish the stalled project. The new library
was dedicated on July 4,1928, with a bronze
bust of Hoover and a carillon of 48 bells,
one for each state in the U.S.
BAEF returned the favor in 1938,
granting $300,000 towards the establish
ment of the Hoover Library (now the
Hoover Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace) on the Stanford campus.
When World War II exploded in 1939.

Hoover repeated the act. raising funds for
Belgium. Poland and Finland, all ravaged
by invasion.
Leuven is pockmarked with re
minders of the Great War. Each building
rebuilt after the fire is marked with a sym
bol of the burning city. One of the city's
major intersections is named the
"Maarschalk Fochplein" after French
general Ferdinand Foch who command
ed the Allied army in the last months of
the war, and there is the library and
Hoover's park.
The war had another lasting impact on
Leuven. The defense of the frontiers
helped ignite Flemish nationalism among
the Dutch-speaking Flemings of northern
Belgium. Demand for Dutch-speaking
services grew in a country where public

administration and higher education had
previously been conducted in French.
The language problem would not go
away at the Catholic University of Leu
ven. where in 1968 the university was di
vided into two single-language institu
tions. A Francophone Universite
Catholique de Louvain was established in
Louvain-la-Neuve. a new town set up for
the purpose. Flemish instruction became
the norm at Katholieke Universiteit Leu
ven, and the library's stocks were divided
in half by shelf number.
Now a majority of the country, the
Flemish enjoy a university of their own
with considerable international cachet.
