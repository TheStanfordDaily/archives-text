## Hoover regarded fondly in Belgium Former president organized relief mission for Belgium during WWI

LEUVEN, Belgium — With his presidency tarred
by the Great Depression, Herbert Hoover '1895 is a
scapegoat in the United States. I lis substantial human
itarian accomplishments, however, are not forgotten in
Belgium, which remembers him for his efforts in
wartime relief, postwar reconstruction and leadership
ot an organization that continues to promote relations
between the two countries.
Hoover is especially honored in the university city of
Leuven, 17 miles east of Brussels, which constructed
Herbert Hooverplein (Herbert Hoover Plaza) adja
cent to the library he helped rebuild after the First
World War.
In the first strokes of World War I, the German army
executed the Schlieffen Plan, which sought to outflank
the French army by crossing through neutral Belgium.
Ibis blatant disregard for an international treaty —
which one German official referred to as "a scrap of
paper" — enraged the British, who almost immediate
ly declared war on Germany.
Belgian resistance against an army ten times its size
was instrumental in preventing a quick defeat at the
hands of the Third Reich, but the country suffered ter
ribly: Germany destroyed Belgian forts in the north of
the country and shelled the western city of Ypres to rub
ble. The crisis continued throughout the war, as the
British navy's blockade of the North Sea threatened to

starve the country

Leuven itself became a symbol for German military
brutality. Mistaking a friendly-fire incident for Leuven
snipers, German troops gave into paranoia about Bel
gian guerrillas (fruncs-tireurs) and terrorized the city.
More than a thousand buildings in the city's inner ring
were set ablaze, and allegations of systematic killing of
civilians in reprisals surfaced. Soldiers also set fire to the
city's world-famous university library and its 3(X),(XX) vol
umes.
After arranging for the safe return of over 1(X),(XK)
Americans stranded in Europe, I loover organized the
Commission for the Relief of Belgium (C'RB).
Shipping supplies across the Atlantic Ocean was a
risky operation due to the German practice of sinking
Allied merchant ships. (It was this policy of unrestrict
ed submarine warfare that eventually brought the
United States into the war in l l )17.)
1 loover traveled to Berlin to lobby German author
ities and worked with Belgian leaders to distribute re
sources throughout the country. At the end of the war.
Hoover assisted American relief efforts in central Eu
rope.
Hie former president also insisted that the C'RB's
surpluses, in excess of $33 million, be bequeathed to the
Belgian people and especially towards education. The
Belgian American Education Foundation (BAEF) was
thus established, distributing money to six Belgian uni
versities and technical schools. Other monies were used
to fund student-exchange fellowships between Bel
gium and the United States, a program that still exists
today.
The remaining endowment was used for the rebuild
ing of two libraries — including the one in Leuven.

Students frequent the University library above in Leuven, Belgium. More than 90 years after World War I, Belgians
still highly regard former U.S. President Herbert Hoover for relief packages and education funding during war.
