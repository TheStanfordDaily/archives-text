# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Dispelling on- versus offcampus housing myths 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
As students across campus prepare
to move out of the room they have
been living in for the last nine months,
many might wonder what determines
the rates they pay, and whether it is
worth it.
There are three relevant factors in
answering that question, according to
Student Housing administrators. How
does on-campus housing compare in
cost and service to off-campus hous
ing? 1 low does it compare to peer in
stitutions like Harvard or Yale? And
how happy are students?
While 1 lousing administrators cite
favorable studies in response to the
last two questions, their claims to be a
superior alternative to off-campus op
tions are disputed, perhaps unsurpris
ingly, by off-campus residents.
Undergraduates across campus live in
a variety of rooms, with space per per
son varying according to the location
and the date of construction. Some
freshmen live in Lagunita's so-called
"mini-doubles," which gets them 160
square feet of shared living space.
Other students enjoy Bob and Jerry's
260-square-foot doubles and Gover
nor's Corner's 140-square-foot singles.
For this space, undergraduates pay
a standard annual dormitory rate of
$5,572, a number comparable to the
Ivies |see sidebar]. Some off-campus
residents say their current living
arrangements give them more space
for the same amount of money. What,
then, is the reason behind current
rates?
Executive Director of Student Hous
ing Rodger Whitney cites the services
provided by on-campus residence.
"We're generally 20 percent below
the market rate [off-campus]," Whit
ney said. "But off-campus, you don't
have resident fellows and resident as
sistants, and you don't have wireless
Internet access, and you don't have
computer clusters, and you don't have
lounges, and usually you pay for your
utilities separately. Those are intangi

bles. You can look at the dollar-to-dol
lar. but when you add in the the things
we have that they don't have, it's even
better."
For example,according to Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises (R&DE)
Marketing Director Jamie Williams
'97, there is one custodian for every 90
residents.
Comparison to local housing
alternatives
Some off-campus dwellers, like Ri
cardoGilb'o7.say they get a much bet
ter deal than what Housing has to
offer.
"It's one of the persistent myths
that it costs more to live off-campus."
Gilb said. "It costs maybe $6(X) a
month for room and $4(X) for board
on-campus. Off-campus, you'll spend a
bit more on rent and a bit less on food."
Gilb lives in a two-person, I.(XX)-
square-foot unit in Redwood City and
says he spends $655 a month for rent
and utilities.
Of course, other off-campus op
tions exist that are significantly more
expensive than on-campus residences.
Jose Campos '08 lived in the Stan
ford Oak Creek Apartments on Sand
Hill Road for one quarter last year.
Campos says he paid around $2,(KX) a
month for rent, hut pointed out the
services provided were atypical.
"Oak Creek has amazing facilities,"
he said. "It makes you feel like you're
living in a resort."
Caring lor The Farm
Construction costs are, of course, a
significant factor driving rates. On av
erage, Williams said, it costs $130,000
to $150,(XX) per "bed" — that is, to
build accommodations for one person.
ITiough it may. as Williams said, "vary
significantly project to project."
Local architect Grace Hinton.who
has worked on several University proj
ects in the past, said that quality of
work and the use of unionized labor
push the figure that high.
"Quality is significantly [higher] at
Stanford than at local municipalities,"

I linton said."lf you drive around Palo
Alto and look at the infrastructure ver
sus driving around campus, (Stanford
is] really trying to preserve the build
ings for the long term."
The preservation program, called
SHARP.costs 11 to 12 million dollars a
year, according to Whitney — a bit
more than 10 percent of the annual
budget.
"We've got a whole sophisticated
program, where every single very
small asset of housing — every roof,
every plumbing system, every carpet,
every set of lamps is catalogued," he
said."We know what the life is of each
one of these is in all of our 350 build
ings, and we can put these on a grid,
and see what's going to drop dead this
year. We've done that on a 50-year life
cycle."
Another large expense specific to
on-campus living is emergency pre
paredness. Student Housing is respon
sible for seismically retrofitting build
ings: R&DE is putting plans in place to
provide seven days of food and water
for 13.000 to 25.(MX) people in the event
of an earthquake, fire, Hood or pan
demic. While the latter plan is still being
finalized, Williams says the one-time
cost will run into the millions of dollars.
"You imagine the supplies we have
to keep, to have on hand." Whitney
said, "because you can't order them
the day the earthquake hits."
Local government is also a factor in
creasing costs. Under Santa Clara
County's General Use Permit, Stan
ford is only allowed to build 2,035,000
square feet of buildings for any pur
pose on its land until 2011.
"Planning building will take twice
[as] long to get through as a normal
business-type building that's not part
of Stanford's land," Hinton said, "be
cause Stanford gets special scrutiny
from the county."
Other factors act to push down costs
down for dorm residents, such as more
centralized bathroom and kitchen fa
cilities relative to apartments.
"Three bathrooms with one stall
cost more than one bathroom with
three stalls," Hinton said, citing space
considerations as well as building
codes like that imposed by the Amer

icans with Disabilities Act.
Building individual as opposed to
communal bathrooms, she added, "is
probably doubling or tripling the
costs."
Comparison to peer institutions
Whitney and Williams said that
Stanford compares well with peer in
stitutions, citing student surveys and a
proprietary study conducted by an
outside consultant comparing Stan
ford's services to Ivy League universi
ties.
Williams said the only areas where the
University lags are trash collection
and utilities. At Columbia University
in New York, high-rise dorms make it
easier to pick up trash. At Stanford's
sprawling campus, it costs more to
send drivers to more dispersed loca
tions. California is known for its high
er-than-average electricity costs.
And higher electricity costs are
only part of the equation — costs are
generally higher in California.

"(Building) costs in California are
double what they are in the rest of the
country,'* Hinton said. "It's not only
California regulations — there are
earthquakes, and there are things
that have to he built to earthquake
standards. Everything built before
1989 is probably not up to certain
standards."
In the most recent survey of stu
dent attitudes on housing, average re
sults in every category' from custodial
services to repairs were above 4.0 on a
5-point scale. Whitney said that 4.0 is
"very good."
And while they disagree on its merits,
residential marketing director
Williams and off-campus resident
Gilb agree that on-campus housing is
central to student life.
"Life at Stanford is really resi
dence-based." Gilb said. "There's no
getting around that."

I linton said."lf you drive around Palo
Alto and look at the infrastructure ver
sus driving around campus, (Stanford
is] really trying to preserve the build
ings for the long term."
The preservation program, called
SHARP.costs 11 to 12 million dollars a
year, according to Whitney — a bit
more than 10 percent of the annual
budget.
"We've got a whole sophisticated
program, where every single very
small asset of housing — every roof,
every plumbing system, every carpet,
every set of lamps is catalogued," he
said."We know what the life is of each
one of these is in all of our 350 build
ings, and we can put these on a grid,
and see what's going to drop dead this
year. We've done that on a 50-year life
cycle."
Another large expense specific to
on-campus living is emergency pre
paredness. Student Housing is respon
sible for seismically retrofitting build
ings: R&DE is putting plans in place to
provide seven days of food and water
for 13.000 to 25.(MX) people in the event
of an earthquake, fire, Hood or pan
demic. While the latter plan is still being
finalized, Williams says the one-time
cost will run into the millions of dollars.
"You imagine the supplies we have
to keep, to have on hand." Whitney
said, "because you can't order them
the day the earthquake hits."
Local government is also a factor in
creasing costs. Under Santa Clara
County's General Use Permit, Stan
ford is only allowed to build 2,035,000
square feet of buildings for any pur
pose on its land until 2011.
"Planning building will take twice
[as] long to get through as a normal
business-type building that's not part
of Stanford's land," Hinton said, "be
cause Stanford gets special scrutiny
from the county."
Other factors act to push down costs
down for dorm residents, such as more
centralized bathroom and kitchen fa
cilities relative to apartments.
"Three bathrooms with one stall
cost more than one bathroom with
three stalls," Hinton said, citing space
considerations as well as building
codes like that imposed by the Amer

icans with Disabilities Act.
Building individual as opposed to
communal bathrooms, she added, "is
probably doubling or tripling the
costs."
Comparison to peer institutions
Whitney and Williams said that
Stanford compares well with peer in
stitutions, citing student surveys and a
proprietary study conducted by an
outside consultant comparing Stan
ford's services to Ivy League universi
ties.
Williams said the only areas where the
University lags are trash collection
and utilities. At Columbia University
in New York, high-rise dorms make it
easier to pick up trash. At Stanford's
sprawling campus, it costs more to
send drivers to more dispersed loca
tions. California is known for its high
er-than-average electricity costs.
And higher electricity costs are
only part of the equation — costs are
generally higher in California.

"(Building) costs in California are
double what they are in the rest of the
country,'* Hinton said. "It's not only
California regulations — there are
earthquakes, and there are things
that have to he built to earthquake
standards. Everything built before
1989 is probably not up to certain
standards."
In the most recent survey of stu
dent attitudes on housing, average re
sults in every category' from custodial
services to repairs were above 4.0 on a
5-point scale. Whitney said that 4.0 is
"very good."
And while they disagree on its merits,
residential marketing director
Williams and off-campus resident
Gilb agree that on-campus housing is
central to student life.
"Life at Stanford is really resi
dence-based." Gilb said. "There's no
getting around that."

As students across campus prepare
to move out of the room they have
been living in for the last nine months,
many might wonder what determines
the rates they pay, and whether it is
worth it.
There are three relevant factors in
answering that question, according to
Student Housing administrators. How
does on-campus housing compare in
cost and service to off-campus hous
ing? 1 low does it compare to peer in
stitutions like Harvard or Yale? And
how happy are students?
While 1 lousing administrators cite
favorable studies in response to the
last two questions, their claims to be a
superior alternative to off-campus op
tions are disputed, perhaps unsurpris
ingly, by off-campus residents.
Undergraduates across campus live in
a variety of rooms, with space per per
son varying according to the location
and the date of construction. Some
freshmen live in Lagunita's so-called
"mini-doubles," which gets them 160
square feet of shared living space.
Other students enjoy Bob and Jerry's
260-square-foot doubles and Gover
nor's Corner's 140-square-foot singles.
For this space, undergraduates pay
a standard annual dormitory rate of
$5,572, a number comparable to the
Ivies |see sidebar]. Some off-campus
residents say their current living
arrangements give them more space
for the same amount of money. What,
then, is the reason behind current
rates?
Executive Director of Student Hous
ing Rodger Whitney cites the services
provided by on-campus residence.
"We're generally 20 percent below
the market rate [off-campus]," Whit
ney said. "But off-campus, you don't
have resident fellows and resident as
sistants, and you don't have wireless
Internet access, and you don't have
computer clusters, and you don't have
lounges, and usually you pay for your
utilities separately. Those are intangi

bles. You can look at the dollar-to-dol
lar. but when you add in the the things
we have that they don't have, it's even
better."
For example,according to Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises (R&DE)
Marketing Director Jamie Williams
'97, there is one custodian for every 90
residents.
Comparison to local housing
alternatives
Some off-campus dwellers, like Ri
cardoGilb'o7.say they get a much bet
ter deal than what Housing has to
offer.
"It's one of the persistent myths
that it costs more to live off-campus."
Gilb said. "It costs maybe $6(X) a
month for room and $4(X) for board
on-campus. Off-campus, you'll spend a
bit more on rent and a bit less on food."
Gilb lives in a two-person, I.(XX)-
square-foot unit in Redwood City and
says he spends $655 a month for rent
and utilities.
Of course, other off-campus op
tions exist that are significantly more
expensive than on-campus residences.
Jose Campos '08 lived in the Stan
ford Oak Creek Apartments on Sand
Hill Road for one quarter last year.
Campos says he paid around $2,(KX) a
month for rent, hut pointed out the
services provided were atypical.
"Oak Creek has amazing facilities,"
he said. "It makes you feel like you're
living in a resort."
Caring lor The Farm
Construction costs are, of course, a
significant factor driving rates. On av
erage, Williams said, it costs $130,000
to $150,(XX) per "bed" — that is, to
build accommodations for one person.
ITiough it may. as Williams said, "vary
significantly project to project."
Local architect Grace Hinton.who
has worked on several University proj
ects in the past, said that quality of
work and the use of unionized labor
push the figure that high.
"Quality is significantly [higher] at
Stanford than at local municipalities,"
