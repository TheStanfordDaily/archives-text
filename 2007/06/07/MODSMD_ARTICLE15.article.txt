## A
						note from the Editor in Chief All great volumes must end 
### 
By any measure, the past volume of Ihe
Daily has proved to be an extraordinary
success. Stanford's Paper of Record has
been complete, honest, relevant and fair.
Most of all, it has been a tremendous
place to come to work every day. 1 have
heard the newsroom compared to the salons
of Enlightened France, the cafeterias of
Google and the common room of a fraterni
ty. None of these quite captures the essence,
the veritable je ne sais quoi, of the place.
Ihe Daily is the best place to learn, hang out,
and work on campus. Young professionals de
velop their craft as they chow down on Chinese
food and pizza. We get the paper to the presses,
and then use the rush of energy after deadline to
study. Day after day. we 're there to support each
other in the serious work we do. Even though
it's sure to cause collective eye rolling (especial
ly among those who work here). I'll say what I
think The Daily really is: a family.
What motivates us day after day? It's not the
pay. trust me. It's not seeing our names in the
paper, though 1 cannot speak for everyone. It's
not to impress attractive members of the oppo
site sex. although I hear The Daily works won
ders as a pickup line. It's the pride that comes
with exploring issues, events and people no one
else is covering in an incisive way.

When readers pick up The Daily, they know
they can trust what's in these pages. Student
blogs and sideshow newsletters will come and
go. hut Ihe Daily will thrive as readers continue
demanding credible reporting.This student-run
non profit is a public trust.The institution's true
power and influence are derived from the wide
spread support and mandate of our many read
ers, sources and benefactors.
We're continuing to raise the bar. Across the
board, from sports to layout to graphics to opin
ions, great editors and reporters made great con
tributions. It's hard for me to name one without
naming a dozen more. So many people made im
portant commitments that resulted in a material
improvement of quality, but some of our con
crete achievements since January include:
Debuting Page Two: We introduced a fea
tures page that includes the most comprehen
sive daily calendar on campus and showcases
up-and-coming Daily talent.
Stronger copy editing: A visionary copy chief
assembled a crack team of fact checkers and
word sticklers. Being more careful and thor
ough has cut down on the number of errors and
corrections, which has improved our credibility
as a whole.
