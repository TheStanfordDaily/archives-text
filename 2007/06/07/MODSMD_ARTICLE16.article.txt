# You are an idiot

It's a commonly held misconception that
time at a university makes one smarter,
better educated and more knowledgeable.
This is not true.
Whilst the myth of education et al. is per
petuated by the Military-Industrial-Parent-
Teacher Complex (especially during com
mencement weekend), the largest driving
force behind the lie is you. Yes, you. You are
delusional.
If you're graduating this year, you'll walk
away from Stanford with happy thoughts, suf
fused with the illusion of intellectual better
ment. There will, of course, be a brief an
guished period where the sudden sense of loss
hits you in the pit of the stomach. But that will
fade, leaving just the glow of Good Times and
Life Lessons as you walk away from the Farm.
The problem is, though, that this rosy pic
ture doesn't last. You may leave Stanford with
memories, but they will slowly leave you.lbat
long night where you all sat around talking,
smoking hookah and really understanding —
you won't be talking about that in five years.
Jesus, you won't even talk about it in five
months.

Even more dramatic than this non-persist
ence of memory, however, is the rapid dilution
and disappearance of knowledge. Almost
everything you've learned was worthless — it
has no value and,even if it did. it doesn't mat
ter since you will remember little of it.
It's almost unbelievable just how insignifi
cant all that hard work was. All those late
nights cramming for tests. All those notes
taken. And all those subjects reviewed. Point
less.
Sure, maybe it'll give you an edge in the job
market to have a 3.9 over a 3.89; but really,
past that first job it's all irrelevant — no one
will ever care again.The real world isn't at all
interested in just how much research you put
into your honors thesis.
Remember the sniffles when Math 51 real
ly got to you? The mental anguish and torture
of your soul as you wrestled with calculus?
Long term benefits of that hard won A? Noth-
