# You are an idiot

It's a commonly held misconception that
time at a university makes one smarter,
better educated and more knowledgeable.
This is not true.
Whilst the myth of education et al. is per
petuated by the Military-Industrial-Parent-
Teacher Complex (especially during com
mencement weekend), the largest driving
force behind the lie is you. Yes, you. You are
delusional.
If you're graduating this year, you'll walk
away from Stanford with happy thoughts, suf
fused with the illusion of intellectual better
ment. There will, of course, be a brief an
guished period where the sudden sense of loss
hits you in the pit of the stomach. But that will
fade, leaving just the glow of Good Times and
Life Lessons as you walk away from the Farm.
The problem is, though, that this rosy pic
ture doesn't last. You may leave Stanford with
memories, but they will slowly leave you.lbat
long night where you all sat around talking,
smoking hookah and really understanding —
you won't be talking about that in five years.
Jesus, you won't even talk about it in five
months.

Even more dramatic than this non-persist
ence of memory, however, is the rapid dilution
and disappearance of knowledge. Almost
everything you've learned was worthless — it
has no value and,even if it did. it doesn't mat
ter since you will remember little of it.
It's almost unbelievable just how insignifi
cant all that hard work was. All those late
nights cramming for tests. All those notes
taken. And all those subjects reviewed. Point
less.
Sure, maybe it'll give you an edge in the job
market to have a 3.9 over a 3.89; but really,
past that first job it's all irrelevant — no one
will ever care again.The real world isn't at all
interested in just how much research you put
into your honors thesis.
Remember the sniffles when Math 51 real
ly got to you? The mental anguish and torture
of your soul as you wrestled with calculus?

If I were being fair. 1 might ac
knowledge that the value of grades
(or rather, lack thereof) is not com
pletely dismissed by the hoi polloi. In
fact, even while the tears are being
shed over B minuses, most of you
probably have some inkling how little
it will matter down the road.
No, it's not grades that you elevate
to too high a level; it's education itself.
You spend four years at college and
you think that you've improved your
self, elevated yourself, pushed your
boundaries — and it's just not true.
On a purely operational level,
you're going to forget a lot. That
process has probably already started

the bright intellectual lode of
I HUM is almost certainly dimming by
now and those intro Bio classes
should be a distant non-memory.
Forgetting is a frightening process.
It takes years to complete. Little
pieces of fact are torn away from you
until all you are left with is the vague
sense of having known something in
the past. It's not a great deal of fun to
pass the time feeling yourself dimin
ish.
Even excepting that, though, a col
lege degree is a dangerous thing.
Knowledge is a powerful Ux>l and rea
son is, perhaps, even more so. Without
humility, however, neither is of much
use. And humility is the very thing that
none of us seem to take away from our
undergraduate educations.
1 could, needless to say, be excep
tional in having believed that I was
great and then realizing I wasn't. But,
to be honest, I don't think so.

We are all weak. In particular, we
all pursue greatness relentlessly, but
have no idea how to deal with failure.
This is unfortunate; After all. much (if
not most) of life is failure, not success.
I think, above all else. 1 want to get
across the idea that while a college de
gree is a wonderful thing, you know a
great deal less about the world we live
in than you might believe.
Eventually,you'll learn your limits,
you'll understand that all the facts
you've learned don't mean quite what
you think they mean. You'll learn
what you don't know, rather than
what you do.
Until that point, though, remem
ber ignorance is not just bliss, it Is.

I've always wanted to battle this argu
ment out with someone who thinks that
the acquisition of knowledge is not just
a selfish jaunt — email navins@stan
