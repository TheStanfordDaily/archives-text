# Paris, c'est un village
## 
### 
I stood on a bridge over the Seine Saturday
morning watching the sunrise. Two friends
and I had stayed up all night — hopping
from one bar to the next, meandering about
random, forgotten churches, stopping for a
quick 3 a.m. crepe — and the sun rising over
the Seine was to be the culmination of our
night. But a weeklong storm had just passed
over the city and the sky was still covered by
clouds. So when the sun finally rose, all we saw
was a sliver of light pass through a crack in the
shimmering pink clouds.
It was. perhaps, the most anti-climactic sun
rise of my life. But at that moment, I felt a
weird appreciation for the city.The steeples of
Notre-Dame rising above the roofs of lie de la
Cite on our right, the fountains of Hotel de
Ville trumpeting on our left, the imposing out
line of the Umvre behind us and the Seine
rushing under our feet — everything seemed
more natural.
We were the only people on the bridge at

that point and. for possibly the first time, the
city center seemed like more than a giant
tourist trap, a shell of reality Had the city given
us an elaborate and breathtaking sunrise, with
bright colors mixing in the sky. illuminating the
grandiose 18th century architecture, it would
have lived up to every Parisian stereotype and
every photoshopped postcard. But as it was,
with the feeble light and the grey sky, the sun
rise showed us a city laid bare, stripped of all
pomp and vanity, revealing Paris for what it re
ally is. It was indescribably beautiful.
Admittedly, it Ux>k a while for Paris to grow
on me. Maybe it was the cliche of its reputation,
maybe it was my unwillingness to look beyond
its facade. But now I realize that although on
first glance it may seem stuffy and old, it has a
quirky and exciting personality. With things as
simple as a metro stop decorated like the inside
