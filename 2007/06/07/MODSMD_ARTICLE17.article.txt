# Paris, c'est un village
## 
### 
I stood on a bridge over the Seine Saturday
morning watching the sunrise. Two friends
and I had stayed up all night — hopping
from one bar to the next, meandering about
random, forgotten churches, stopping for a
quick 3 a.m. crepe — and the sun rising over
the Seine was to be the culmination of our
night. But a weeklong storm had just passed
over the city and the sky was still covered by
clouds. So when the sun finally rose, all we saw
was a sliver of light pass through a crack in the
shimmering pink clouds.
It was. perhaps, the most anti-climactic sun
rise of my life. But at that moment, I felt a
weird appreciation for the city.The steeples of
Notre-Dame rising above the roofs of lie de la
Cite on our right, the fountains of Hotel de
Ville trumpeting on our left, the imposing out
line of the Umvre behind us and the Seine
rushing under our feet — everything seemed
more natural.
We were the only people on the bridge at

that point and. for possibly the first time, the
city center seemed like more than a giant
tourist trap, a shell of reality Had the city given
us an elaborate and breathtaking sunrise, with
bright colors mixing in the sky. illuminating the
grandiose 18th century architecture, it would
have lived up to every Parisian stereotype and
every photoshopped postcard. But as it was,
with the feeble light and the grey sky, the sun
rise showed us a city laid bare, stripped of all
pomp and vanity, revealing Paris for what it re
ally is. It was indescribably beautiful.
Admittedly, it Ux>k a while for Paris to grow
on me. Maybe it was the cliche of its reputation,
maybe it was my unwillingness to look beyond
its facade. But now I realize that although on
first glance it may seem stuffy and old, it has a
quirky and exciting personality. With things as
simple as a metro stop decorated like the inside

of a submarine, a statue of a giant
thumb at La Defense, or an open-air
market at the Bastille that stays open
until the wee hours of the night, there
are delightful surprises hidden
throughout this ancient metropolis.
As soon as I started branching out
and visiting slightly more unusual and
less famous spots, 1 began to love the
city more and more. There is, for in
stance, the Arenes de Lutece — a
Gallo-Roman amphitheater nestled in
the middle of the busy
Mouffetard/Latin Quarter area. While
nowhere near as impressive or well pre
served as the Roman ruins one would
find around the Mediterranean, the
Arenes has been transformed into a
lovely park. Ihe theater, which is sur

rounded by buildings, has been com
pletely integrated into the city around
it. with one of the entrance ways going
through a passage in a building facing
Rue Monge.Hie stage of the amphithe
ater is now filled with playing children
while Parisians lounge on the steps,
reading, sleeping, picnicking. It was one
of the loveliest and most unexpected
parks 1 have ever visited.
And, of course, there's the 20th ar
rondissement. Hidden in the eastern
corner of the city, the 20th is apparent
ly home to Paris' new alternative
scene, with plenty of live-music ven
ues, eccentrically decorated bars and
youths with angular hair-cuts.
But I've even grown to love the fa
miliar and expected in the city. Noth
ing brings me more pleasure than
being able to find my way from the
Jardin du Luxembourg to Notre
Dame without giving it a second
thought, reading a book at "my cafe"
facing the fountain in front of Saint

Sulpice or eating the best falafel in
Paris, possibly in the world, in a small
park hidden between some buildings
in the Marais.
1 spent three of the last four week
ends away from Paris. And while 1
loved nearly every city 1 visited, on my
final evening in Barcelona all 1 could
think about was how much 1 missed
Paris. Coming back felt like coming
home. Which is why the thought of
leaving in just two short weeks is ab
solutely heartbreaking.
But 1 guess this carefree,
Hemigway-esque life could only last
so long. Maybe it's good to get back re
ality. And who knows, maybe my ro
mantic dream of dropping everything,
moving to Paris and making my way as
writer, journalist or waitress will one
dav come true.

Vicky should spend her last two weeks in
Paris, email \ick\d@stanford.edu.
