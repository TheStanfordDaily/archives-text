# Stanford Enquirer
## 
### 
Last Thursday. The Daily unveiled its ex
clusive (and nonstop) coverage of the
Azia Kim story — or should I say the
Azia Kim sensation — and a legend was horn.
I lot on the heels of that journalistic victory, we
as a paper single-handedly not only ousted a
highly threatening Asian female physics
sugar-daddy-seeker from a campus laborato
ry, hut unearthed never-before-seen eyewit
ness photographs of Azia Kim actually in the
process of "chowing down on a hamburger."
Judging by the unprecedented number people
I've seen reading non-sudoku sections of the
paper, clearly we're onto something.
The only course of action: We need to make
hay while the bacon sizzles.The 24/7 multime
dia squatter coverage, interviews with myriad
anonymous sources, and scanned photo
graphs of Ms. Kim's wall signs are a gcxxl start,
hut what we really need is a whole separate di
vision of the press dedicated to raking up the

muck. 1 present for your approval the first
mini-issue of The Stanford Enquirer.
Today, a group of Asian-American female
tourists were seen in front of MemChu. When
a witness demanded one of them show identi
fication. she rapidly walked away without ad
dressing the request. She is currently suspect
ed of pretending to be a tourist in order to gain
access to the Stanford University campus dur
ing normal business hours. More information
on this story as it unfolds
Was renowned author and Stanford
celebrity Tobias Wolff s latest novel directly
plagiarized from the work of Pulitzer-winner
Philip Roth? My sources tell me: almost defi
nitely not.
Wednesday in the main quad, my
spies spotted no fewer than ELEVEN stu
dents l<xkcd in President Hennessy's office.
