# Stanford Enquirer
## 
### 
Last Thursday. The Daily unveiled its ex
clusive (and nonstop) coverage of the
Azia Kim story — or should I say the
Azia Kim sensation — and a legend was horn.
I lot on the heels of that journalistic victory, we
as a paper single-handedly not only ousted a
highly threatening Asian female physics
sugar-daddy-seeker from a campus laborato
ry, hut unearthed never-before-seen eyewit
ness photographs of Azia Kim actually in the
process of "chowing down on a hamburger."
Judging by the unprecedented number people
I've seen reading non-sudoku sections of the
paper, clearly we're onto something.
The only course of action: We need to make
hay while the bacon sizzles.The 24/7 multime
dia squatter coverage, interviews with myriad
anonymous sources, and scanned photo
graphs of Ms. Kim's wall signs are a gcxxl start,
hut what we really need is a whole separate di
vision of the press dedicated to raking up the

muck. 1 present for your approval the first
mini-issue of The Stanford Enquirer.
Today, a group of Asian-American female
tourists were seen in front of MemChu. When
a witness demanded one of them show identi
fication. she rapidly walked away without ad
dressing the request. She is currently suspect
ed of pretending to be a tourist in order to gain
access to the Stanford University campus dur
ing normal business hours. More information
on this story as it unfolds
Was renowned author and Stanford
celebrity Tobias Wolff s latest novel directly
plagiarized from the work of Pulitzer-winner
Philip Roth? My sources tell me: almost defi
nitely not.
Wednesday in the main quad, my
spies spotted no fewer than ELEVEN stu
dents l<xkcd in President Hennessy's office.

some of whom may not have been of
legal age. Also wandering around the
scene were two naked students with
various phrases painted on their bod
ies. I .ater.the students were bondaged
up in plastic handcuffs and two were
heard shouting "Take me!" to men
dressed in police uniforms.

This just in! Apparently on top of
Azia Kim using her Stanford affilia
tion to acquire thousands of dollars'
worth of military equipment from the
ROTC program, an unidentified
Toyon resident used his Stanford wire
less internet connection to pirate liter
ally tens of dollars' worth of music
from My lunes and Lime Wire.
Last Saturday night, four scantily
clad female undergraduates were
spotted waiting for 5-SURE on the
corner of Campus Drive and Mayfield.
Investigation shows that all four failed

to fail a BAC sobriety test. Said one of
the perpetrators. "Yeah. I'm not. like,
drunk,yet. I just don't want to walk all
the way to SlavDom." If the 5-SIJRE
program decides to press "Theft of
Service" charges, each girl could be
fined up to $3.50 for the violation.
Spotted today in White Plaza by the
post office: A large placard sponsored
by La Douche (oops. Laßouche) fa
natics proclaiming: "Global warming
is as fake as your girlfriend's orgasm!"
As of press time, Mr. Larouche's girl
friend declined to return repeated calls

from The Enquirer.
Stanford Enquirer rabble-rousers
have located yet another potential
squatter on campus. Ihe subject is a
white middle-aged male who has been
spotted haunting Governor's Corner,
claiming he lives in the area. Inter
views with sources who wished to re
main anonymous have confirmed that
the man has been hanging around
Adams and Schiff houses for upward
of four years, and can usually be spot
ted at the FroSoCo weekly barbeque
wearing an apron that says "Kiss the

Chef."
The perpetrator goes under the
alias "John Bravman" and claims he
is the Dean of Freshman/Sophomore
College. Sterling Quad residents are
advised not to let strangers piggy
back them through doors and. for the
love of Pete, to lock their friggin' win
dows.
Also spied this week: a group of
bored-looking undergraduate stu
dents procrastinating on studying for
finals by reading sensationalist stories
in the campus newspaper. Said one

witness: "Yeah, this is kind of lame —
I'm just holding out until I find out
what brand of zit cream Azia Kim
used."
Well, loyal Enquirer fans, keep
reading. With any luck, we should be
breaking that front-page news any day
now.

If you have any hot campus tips, send
them to Kat at klewin@stanforil.eiht.
Apparently there's virtually no limit to
the pointless details Enquiring minds
want to know.
