### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
When incoming freshman Samantha Lar
son summited Mt. Everest on May 16, she be
came the youngest American to stand on top
of the world. In scaling the 29.028-foot Hi
malayan peak, the 18-year-old Larson also
became the youngest person ever to success
fully climb the so-called "Seven Summits,"
which comprise the highest peaks on each
continent.

When Larson returned stateside, she gave
The Daily an interview about her experiences
on Everest and about how she will thrill-seek
at Stanford next year.
The Daily: What were the hardest parts of the
climb?

waiting for the right weather window. We did
n't know what to do with ourselves.That was
really hard, and something someone else
wouldn't think of at first.
In terms of the actual climbing, by far the
hardest day was summit day. We had only a
few hours to rest at the last camp before we
started the summit, and the lack of oxygen re

ally took a toll. Going back down the next
day, 1 was so exhausted and it was so much
harder than 1 expected it to be.
TD: What would you say were the high points
and the low points of the climb? No pun in
tended.
SL: I really just enjoyed the actual climbing.
Summiting, of course, was amazing. I'd
thought 1 would be so happy but it was more
of a mix of exhaustion, happiness and sense of
accomplishment. Maybe the best part was
getting back down to base camp because we
were back down and it was safe.
I guess the worst part was waiting and
