# A 						climb to the top
## OFF-CAMPUS Incoming freshman conquers Everest Larson is youngest American to climb Seven Summits 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
When incoming freshman Samantha Lar
son summited Mt. Everest on May 16, she be
came the youngest American to stand on top
of the world. In scaling the 29.028-foot Hi
malayan peak, the 18-year-old Larson also
became the youngest person ever to success
fully climb the so-called "Seven Summits,"
which comprise the highest peaks on each
continent.

When Larson returned stateside, she gave
The Daily an interview about her experiences
on Everest and about how she will thrill-seek
at Stanford next year.
The Daily: What were the hardest parts of the
climb?
Sainantha Larson: First of all. it was hard just
waiting. We were just down at base camp
waiting for the right weather window. We did
n't know what to do with ourselves.That was
really hard, and something someone else
wouldn't think of at first.
In terms of the actual climbing, by far the
hardest day was summit day. We had only a
few hours to rest at the last camp before we
started the summit, and the lack of oxygen re

ally took a toll. Going back down the next
day, 1 was so exhausted and it was so much
harder than 1 expected it to be.
TD: What would you say were the high points
and the low points of the climb? No pun in
tended.
SL: I really just enjoyed the actual climbing.
Summiting, of course, was amazing. I'd
thought 1 would be so happy but it was more
of a mix of exhaustion, happiness and sense of
accomplishment. Maybe the best part was
getting back down to base camp because we
were back down and it was safe.
I guess the worst part was waiting and

hanging around base camp. It was
nice to be there because it was com
fortable, but you get tired of being
there.
TI): Did you face any life-threaten
ing situations during the climb?
SL: There was one day when I was
pretty freaked out. We woke up in
the morning to go down to another
camp, but we got a radio call saying a
sherpa had died, and we weren't sure
what had happened at that point. It
was scary climbing back down know
ing he could have fallen from where
you were standing.
Another time. I was coming back
down after the summit and I was by
myself. I came to a split in the path,
and picked the way that I thought
was correct. Instead. I fell into a
frozen lake up to my thighs or so. I
was so tired, and I kinda had a panic
attack because I wanted to get back
to camp as quickly as I could so my
dad could take off my boots and I
wouldn't get frostbite.
Of course, every step really counts
when you're climbing Everest, but we
didn't have any particular moments
that I can really say were life-threat
ening for any of our team members.
TI): How long did you have to wait
before conditions were favorable for
the summit attempt?
SL: We planned to stay for four days
back down in the valley, but we
ended up staying a week because
conditions weren't right. Then we
waited another five days at base
camp before climbing the summit.
TI): What did it feel like to make it to
the top?
SL: It wasn't exactly what I expected
it to feel like. I'd of course been
thinking about it for a long time. I'd
been planning to call my mom from
the summit, and 1 had an idea of how
that conversation would go. Once I
was really at the top though, it was
just a flood of emotion. I was crying.
I was so exhausted — so happy to be
there. I just plopped down, and I did
n't even talk to my mom for very
long.
At the same time it was incredible
just to look around. I'd seen pictures,
but just to see it for myself was really
amazing.
TI): Why didn't you eat during parts
of the climb?
SL: High altitude can have a variety
of effects depending on the individ
ual person, including loss of ap
petite. I have always experienced a
loss of appetite at high altitude, so I

just try to stay hydrated and force
myself to eat what I can. For the two
nights that we stayed at Camp 4 on
Everest, that amounted to just about
a quarter of a Hershey's bar. Above
8.000 meters (26,250 feet) you are in
the so-called 'death zone,' where the
body shuts down, and prefers to eat
away at itself rather than take in out
side food.
TI): What was your favorite climb
out of the Seven Summits?
SL: If I had to pick a favorite, I'd say
Everest, probably just because it's so
fresh in my mind. After the other
climbs, 1 was really happy to be going
home, ready to go back to normal
life, hot showers and real food. After
Everest I felt sad to be leaving, I
wanted to stay, you know, so that was
kind of strange. Maybe it was an indi
cation that that was my favorite.
TI): Why did you decide to do this?
Did your family support your plan?
SL: Ever since I was first thinking
about what schools to apply to, I'd al
ways wanted to take a year off, to
travel or get a job or something. I
thought it would be a good experi
ence to have time in between. My
mom really supported that. She
thought it was a great idea to go and
travel.
As I got more and more into
[climbing], it became really obvious
that I wanted to climb for a year. Be
sides Everest, I spent half the year
climbing.
Before my idea was specifically to
climb, my dad wasn't so interested.
He was nervous I'd get off track. But
once I included him, he was pretty
excited.
TI): Why did you decide to come to
Stanford?
SL: Well, it seemed like it had a lot to
offer, and it's pretty close to
Yosemite. I came to Admit Weekend
and really enjoyed it, so it seemed
like a good place to go.
TI): What do you plan to do for
thrills next year?
SL: I got a letter from the president
of the Stanford Alpine Club, so that's
definitely something I'll have to look
into doing. I think [the club] has a lot
of different sorts of activities. I 'm not
sure what else I'll get into, I'll have to
see.
TI): You say you'll have to see about
other activities. Do you have any
concrete academic plans?
SL: I haven't decided on a major. I'm
pretty open. I don't really have even

an inclination at this point. It's hard
because I'm interested in both the
humanities and the sciences. But you
don't have to declare until the end of
your sophomore year — I'm sure I'll
figure it out.
TI): What else do you do for fun or
excitement?
SL: I'd say mostly just things out
doors, like hiking. I go to a rock gym
quite frequently — that's good prac
tice and I enjoy that too. But I think,
in general, I prefer climbing when
you're outside and it is the real deal
with actual rocks.
TD: Do you consider yourself a
thrill-seeker?
SL: Maybe I'm a thrill-seeker in a
sense that I like to do other adven
turous things. But when I'm actually

climbing I try to avoid the whole
adrenaline thing. There's enough of
it in general, because you're already
in a dangerous situation, so you're
working to feel safe. I probably en
joyed it the most when 1 didn't have
the big adrenaline rush.
TI): What else can you tell me about
your trip?
SL: Well I guess one thing that was
important was the fact that we went
with a team of our friends and people
we knew. We had climbed with every
one before, and we'd climbed with
our guide three times before. That
was nice because we knew we could
trust and rely on everyone.There was
really a sense of camaraderie.
