# Morning on the third day

r â–  llie last time I ever saw her was the morn
ing after we met. Her name was Natasha
Jl. or Katya or some perfect Russian name
for my perfect Russian one night stand. A love
that began at the bar and blossomed on the
dance floor and persevered through the taxi
ride and culminated in her tiny little room in a
dirty building somewhere in Moscow, don't
ask me where. I had to keep looking at her to
remember what her face looked like.
When we woke up my head hurt bad and
the rest of me hurt good, like I'd just had a
strenuous workout concurrent with an unethi
cal massage. I asked the girl (Tanya?) if she
could help me find a taxi. Yes, she said, she was
leaving anyways. It was Easter Sunday, and she
had promised to visit her parents. My voice was
hoarse from cheap cigarettes and good vodka

and the restless sleep you get lying next to a
strange body on a strange bed in a strange
country. She said she liked my voice. Russians
are weird, or just good at lying. Even as she
gave me her email address, written on a tiny
purple post-it note in swirly blue ink, 1 knew I
would never contact her. I already knew her
better than I ever would by actually knowing
her. There was no mess between us. We would
n't ever learn to hate each other. I'm not sure
she ever even knew my name. (Women are
more logical about these things.)
When I was a freshman. I was a virgin. And.
like most virgins. I knew with all my heart and
soul that everything would be much better after I
had sex. Jesus Christ would ride his golden chari

ot out of the sun to offer me eternal happiness,
impossible wealth and a proud paternal high
five. Then 1 was sophomore, my V-card fresh
punched, feeling no different. 1 figured that what
1 needed was a relationship. That didn't work. 1
decided that 1 didn't need a girl to validate me.
Of course, that's just what losers say. 1 prom
ised to focus on my studies, but that never
works. 1 'm a film major. You know how many
hot girls star in films? Kabillions. I couldn't de
cide if 1 wanted to find the love of my life or the
fuck of the century. It was a moral quandary.
Still is. 1 fall in love with every girl I see, why oh
why won't none of them sex me? "You're a
simple man, a house cat," says the angel on my
shoulder, "wait for the right girl." "But this is
college." says the devil,"don't you owe it to old
man Darren to have as much young man Dar
ren sex as possible?" 1 throw up my hands and
see where the night takes me. Bless college: the
random hook-ups, the dormcest, the friends. A
gentleman doesn't kiss and tell,but he will con
fide that the list is shorter than it could be and
longer than it should be. I would guess I'm
