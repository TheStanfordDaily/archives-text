# Morning on the third day
## 
### 
r ■ llie last time I ever saw her was the morn
ing after we met. Her name was Natasha
Jl. or Katya or some perfect Russian name
for my perfect Russian one night stand. A love
that began at the bar and blossomed on the
dance floor and persevered through the taxi
ride and culminated in her tiny little room in a
dirty building somewhere in Moscow, don't
ask me where. I had to keep looking at her to
remember what her face looked like.
When we woke up my head hurt bad and
the rest of me hurt good, like I'd just had a
strenuous workout concurrent with an unethi
cal massage. I asked the girl (Tanya?) if she
could help me find a taxi. Yes, she said, she was
leaving anyways. It was Easter Sunday, and she
had promised to visit her parents. My voice was
hoarse from cheap cigarettes and good vodka

and the restless sleep you get lying next to a
strange body on a strange bed in a strange
country. She said she liked my voice. Russians
are weird, or just good at lying. Even as she
gave me her email address, written on a tiny
purple post-it note in swirly blue ink, 1 knew I
would never contact her. I already knew her
better than I ever would by actually knowing
her. There was no mess between us. We would
n't ever learn to hate each other. I'm not sure
she ever even knew my name. (Women are
more logical about these things.)
When I was a freshman. I was a virgin. And.
like most virgins. I knew with all my heart and
soul that everything would be much better after I
had sex. Jesus Christ would ride his golden chari

ot out of the sun to offer me eternal happiness,
impossible wealth and a proud paternal high
five. Then 1 was sophomore, my V-card fresh
punched, feeling no different. 1 figured that what
1 needed was a relationship. That didn't work. 1
decided that 1 didn't need a girl to validate me.
Of course, that's just what losers say. 1 prom
ised to focus on my studies, but that never
works. 1 'm a film major. You know how many
hot girls star in films? Kabillions. I couldn't de
cide if 1 wanted to find the love of my life or the
fuck of the century. It was a moral quandary.
Still is. 1 fall in love with every girl I see, why oh
why won't none of them sex me? "You're a
simple man, a house cat," says the angel on my
shoulder, "wait for the right girl." "But this is
college." says the devil,"don't you owe it to old
man Darren to have as much young man Dar
ren sex as possible?" 1 throw up my hands and
see where the night takes me. Bless college: the
random hook-ups, the dormcest, the friends. A
gentleman doesn't kiss and tell,but he will con
fide that the list is shorter than it could be and
longer than it should be. I would guess I'm

probably about normal for a skinny
stooped prep school boy: a few rela
tionships, a few dry spells, some shut
outs, some hat tricks.
I would guess that there is less sex
at Stanford per capita than at most
schools. We are either smart enough to
ignore our base impulses or shy
enough to never act on them. There
was some rueful outcry a couple years
ago when Playboy announced a Pac
-10 issue and nearly had to rename it
the Pac-9 after Stanford barely prof
fered a showing. We ended up fielding
two girls, and only one showed any R

rated skin; next to that, you had
enough Arizona girls to fit in a pool
for what looked like the hottest girl
on-girl orgy that you will never be in
vited to. Who's got the time for the old
in-out?
Maybe I'm wrong, and certainly
I'm cynical. But I find myself meeting
more virgins every day. And I'm left
with the vague sadness of missed op
portunity. Maybe sex isn't so impor
tant. If you believe Keats, the true
transcendent moment is that millisec
ond before the first kiss, when all the
expectation and elation jumps your
perception into hyperreality. That is
the moment that love gets made —
the sex unmakes it by completing it.

fantasy.
Natalya. That was her name. Na

talya. Everything between us was
brand new, for the very last time, the
alpha and omega. We left her apart
ment and walked outside into the
cold Russian sun. When she got me a
taxi, I realized 1 had no money. She
gave me some rubles and one last
kiss, quick, farewell. We were already
miles apart, years away. When she
turned she didn't look back. I did. I
remember staring out the rear win
dow and thinking, this is what life
should be. She was my first blonde,
an angel, seductive, acrobatic. She
was beautiful. That was Easter.
