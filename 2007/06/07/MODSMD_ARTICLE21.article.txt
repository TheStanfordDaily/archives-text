# Why read this page?

Why do you read the Ops Section of
the Daily? Really — why? As I rush
to meet my last deadline as a Daily
columnist, I have been looking through the
columnist archives. Jumping from writer to
writer has made me realize that between us
columnists and the editorial board, we all
have very different ideas of what is supposed
to be on this page. And I'm positive that you,
dear reader, have an opinion all your own. In
a world where we can get information almost
effortlessly and get a feel for the student pulse
via Facebook and blogs. what's the purpose of
an ops section?
Columnists tend to view themselves as
"personalities," with four loose categories of
style: the shit-stirrers, the storytellers, the po
litical commentators, and the jaded observers.
Sure, we fluctuate from week to week, exper
imenting with different roles and voices, but

at the end of the day, each of us inevitably re
turns to one of these vantage points. Kat tells
a story. Darren stirs the shit. Andy used to be
our politics guy. Chris is our sardonic observ
er. And so it goes, each columnist sharing his
or her persona and outlook, one self-aware
profile photo at a time.
Compare this to the edit board, who use
anonymity to step up on a soap box and try to
pump some kind of feeling into an apathetic
student body. Their articles can also be split
into four loose categories: student happen
ings. passing judgment on new (or old) school
programs, national politics, and space fillers.
(As someone who has written an op-ed be
longing to the latter category, I'll own up and
take the hit: I wrote about fun things to do on
the weekend. It was a dark moment in my life.

We're human, it happens.)
So. what's supposed to be happening in
this section of the paper? Is the goal to enter
tain you while you munch your Smart Start?
Should we take a stand, piss you off, and give
you something to write about on the "online
comment feature"? Should we be a blog? A
formal argumentative essay? I don't think
that anyone has ever asked the readers what
they want to read. I'd like to know. Just don't
tell me that you want more sports, because
that will break my heart.
What role can this page fill that isn't ac
complished via either a social-networking site
or a national news source? There is so much
information available to challenge the pur
pose of a college newspaper, let alone an Ops
Section. One argument is that the Daily pro
vides quality control — writers are chosen
and articles are edited before they go to print.
But blogs have built-in quality controls, as well
— the most viewed ones, presumably the most
interesting, rise to the top. the bad ones sink to
the bottom. So what's our niche? How do we
stay pertinent? The formal op-ed section is a
recent invention, starting in 1970 at The New
York Times — time's not up yet. is it?
