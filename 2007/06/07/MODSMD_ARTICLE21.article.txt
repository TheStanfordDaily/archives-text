# Why read this page?

Why do you read the Ops Section of
the Daily? Really — why? As I rush
to meet my last deadline as a Daily
columnist, I have been looking through the
columnist archives. Jumping from writer to
writer has made me realize that between us
columnists and the editorial board, we all
have very different ideas of what is supposed
to be on this page. And I'm positive that you,
dear reader, have an opinion all your own. In
a world where we can get information almost
effortlessly and get a feel for the student pulse
via Facebook and blogs. what's the purpose of
an ops section?
Columnists tend to view themselves as
"personalities," with four loose categories of
style: the shit-stirrers, the storytellers, the po
litical commentators, and the jaded observers.
Sure, we fluctuate from week to week, exper
imenting with different roles and voices, but

at the end of the day, each of us inevitably re
turns to one of these vantage points. Kat tells
a story. Darren stirs the shit. Andy used to be
our politics guy. Chris is our sardonic observ
er. And so it goes, each columnist sharing his
or her persona and outlook, one self-aware
profile photo at a time.
Compare this to the edit board, who use
anonymity to step up on a soap box and try to
pump some kind of feeling into an apathetic
student body. Their articles can also be split
into four loose categories: student happen
ings. passing judgment on new (or old) school
programs, national politics, and space fillers.
(As someone who has written an op-ed be
longing to the latter category, I'll own up and
take the hit: I wrote about fun things to do on
the weekend. It was a dark moment in my life.

We're human, it happens.)
So. what's supposed to be happening in
this section of the paper? Is the goal to enter
tain you while you munch your Smart Start?
Should we take a stand, piss you off, and give
you something to write about on the "online
comment feature"? Should we be a blog? A
formal argumentative essay? I don't think
that anyone has ever asked the readers what
they want to read. I'd like to know. Just don't
tell me that you want more sports, because
that will break my heart.
What role can this page fill that isn't ac
complished via either a social-networking site
or a national news source? There is so much
information available to challenge the pur
pose of a college newspaper, let alone an Ops
Section. One argument is that the Daily pro
vides quality control — writers are chosen
and articles are edited before they go to print.
But blogs have built-in quality controls, as well
— the most viewed ones, presumably the most
interesting, rise to the top. the bad ones sink to
the bottom. So what's our niche? How do we
stay pertinent? The formal op-ed section is a
recent invention, starting in 1970 at The New
York Times — time's not up yet. is it?

Sick Sad World
I spied on some other college pa
pers to try to find the fountain of op
ed youth. Thankfully, they are grop
ing around, as well. The ops page at
the Harvard Crimson reads like a
neurotic co-ed's diary. Monday's
signed pieces were titled: "Finding
Happiness at Harvard." "On Doing
Well." "The Best Four Years of Your
Life?," "Believing In Your Thesis,"
" Holding On' Through Harvard,"
and "Shifting the Race Debate."
These titles speak for themselves.
On the other end of the spectrum,
in 2(X)5, University of Pennsylvania's
The Daily Pennsylvanian was consid
ered by Newsweek to have a slick
business model, and by all financial
accounts, the paper is doing pretty

well for itself. But its ops page reads
like a business journal. It's well-in
formed, clearly structured, and —
erm — boring as hell.
When I asked one of my friends
what he would like to read, he said.
"Stereotypes. Give me more stereo
types. I want the jock. I want the
Rasta-guy. I want the indie girl who
hates life. Let me read about them
and make fun of them at lunch. 1 want
to be entertained."
I don't know how I feel about this
idea. 1 have to admit, we columnists
are an eerily homogeneous bunch —
put our column pictures together and
the albedo is startling. But if we want
to get more viewpoints on the Ops
Page, we need a greater pool of appli
cants from which to choose. Mention
the Daily at a SLAC meeting, and
you get knowing glances and jaded
stares.not a line of applicants. I would
sort of like to read a first-hand ac
count of the hunger strike. Or why

someone thinks that Roe v. Wade
should be reversed. But diversity is
different from stereotypes (clearly).
Making the sole purpose of this page
into a textual song and dance seems
like a cheap solution. 1 agree that
more diversity on the ops page would
be appreciated, but I want to learn
something or get worked up from
reading an op-ed. not be mindlessly
entertained via expected cliches.
Ultimately, we are at a crucial time
in the direction of college papers, and
ops sections in particular. A commu
nication professor recently told me
offhandedly that the only current
purpose of a college paper is to train
writers for when they have something
to say, and to be ready for commen
tary in case another Azia Kim hap
pens. For all other cases, their purpose
is waning.This can't be true — can it?
