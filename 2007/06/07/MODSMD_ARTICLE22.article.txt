# Your child's graduation
## 
### 
To the parents of the graduating class of
2007: Congratulations! You've made it!
Your son or daughter has graduated from
a prestigious university. Now, for what you've
really planned for: the idyllic graduation cere
mony complete with you, that new suit that is
very flattering to your hips, the finest dinner
you've ever purchased and your smiling gradu
ate, of course.
It's all about the graduate.This is their big ac
complishment. They've studied long hours, put
in large amounts of time and effort into receiv
ing the degree, and made the best of your not
all-too-meager tuition funding. They will thank
you profusely, of course, and you, with that new
haircut and a complexion just bragging about
your week in Cabo,you will be humbly shocked
by their gratitude.

When your child was first accepted to this
university, you could not have been more proud
of him or her.They had done it! After all of that
essay writing, arguing over recommendations
and whether they should volunteer in Ethiopia
or Venezuela (you were right, Ethiopia was the
better sell), they were going to a great universi
ty. You could hardly contain your excitement as
you placed the sch(X)l insignia on your cars win
dow.
Now, the most essential thing is to present
yourself as both the nurturing and humble par
ent of the child while at the same time subtly
acknowledging that clearly it was your half of
the gene pool they've been drawing their ge

nius from. A clever graduation card says some
thing, hut then again, so does an Armani suit
and a brand new significant other with teeth so
white they must have been taken from the
souls of cherubs.
Sometimes, entire families come together
for graduations, and this can cause some diffi
culty. If you and the child's father/mother have
divorced, this can be especially stressful. The
graduate may be forced to split time between
your and your former partner's graduation
celebrations, but this does not have to be so.
Guilt works wonders, especially if you are able
to invite the most obscure relative and promise
the most expensive graduation dinner.
Some people invite everyone to the event,
thinking that the greatest spectacle both estab
lishes just how much you care about your child
and how much you, vicariously, are loved. Get
the grandparents and the extended family, but
also make a concerted effort to fly in the third
cousins from Scotland who have never met the
graduate. Graduations really bring families to
gether, and this will set a nearly impossible stan-


Chris Holt

Holt's Harangue
dard to surpass when other relatives'
children graduate. On the other hand,
let's face it.cousin Elise isn't getting out
of county and at family reunions, little
Johnny kept running into the kitchen
table. I le's state-school bound, at best.
Still, others believe that the parent
of the graduating student should auc
tion off spots only to those who will be
the most generous to the graduate,
thereby limiting invitations to surely
what will be the social event of the sea
son. Go ahead, throw out that invitation
to the millionaire philanthropist. Would
Bill Gates like to come to your child's
graduation? Let's find out! Of course,
encourage gifts for the graduating stu
dent. but also a dress code. When your

child rises to receive his/her diploma,
you want a joyous, but above all well
dressed, crowd. Black tie is suggested.
When the other parents meet you
and ask who you are. immediately apol
ogize because they must have heard so
much about you but you hardly know
anything about them. Don't list all of
your child's accomplishments, because
that is in poor taste. Select one anecdote
that is embarrassing for the child but
that makes you seem charming. If you
need to. discuss your trip to Cabo.
There will be plenty of time to
frame the child's diploma later on.
Remember, a frame is permanent; a
diploma from a major university is an
investment for a lifetime. But carry
ing a Xeroxed copy of the diploma on
your person isn't a bad idea either.
Of course, you should present it to
the waiter at the restaurant of the grad
uation dinner — this is expected.
You're excited and it's totally excusa

hie. If it happens to slip out when
you're putting a down payment on that
car, or when you get in a tiff at work,so
be it. You've earned that right. Sam
Barnsworth may have a two-year-old
and strong opinions on next quarter's
numbers, but whoops, your child's
diploma slipped out. Yes. he/she did
graduate with honors from one of the
most selective colleges in the country
and is going on to great things. Now
what were you saying. Sam?
A graduation is a challenging social
ritual, but one that does not have to be
stressful. If you keep your eyes focused
on what matters, the graduate, you can
accomplish the college graduation you
always dreamed of. Consulting the child
at a minimum Ls suggested, however.

Chris has already done the graduation
thing. All kidding aside, his parents are
patient and supportive. Send complaints
to cholt@stanford. edit.
