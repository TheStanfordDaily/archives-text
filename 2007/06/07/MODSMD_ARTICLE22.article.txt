# Your child's graduation
## 
### 
To the parents of the graduating class of
2007: Congratulations! You've made it!
Your son or daughter has graduated from
a prestigious university. Now, for what you've
really planned for: the idyllic graduation cere
mony complete with you, that new suit that is
very flattering to your hips, the finest dinner
you've ever purchased and your smiling gradu
ate, of course.
It's all about the graduate.This is their big ac
complishment. They've studied long hours, put
in large amounts of time and effort into receiv
ing the degree, and made the best of your not
all-too-meager tuition funding. They will thank
you profusely, of course, and you, with that new
haircut and a complexion just bragging about
your week in Cabo,you will be humbly shocked
by their gratitude.

When your child was first accepted to this
university, you could not have been more proud
of him or her.They had done it! After all of that
essay writing, arguing over recommendations
and whether they should volunteer in Ethiopia
or Venezuela (you were right, Ethiopia was the
better sell), they were going to a great universi
ty. You could hardly contain your excitement as
you placed the sch(X)l insignia on your cars win
dow.
Now, the most essential thing is to present
yourself as both the nurturing and humble par
ent of the child while at the same time subtly
acknowledging that clearly it was your half of
the gene pool they've been drawing their ge

nius from. A clever graduation card says some
thing, hut then again, so does an Armani suit
and a brand new significant other with teeth so
white they must have been taken from the
souls of cherubs.
Sometimes, entire families come together
for graduations, and this can cause some diffi
culty. If you and the child's father/mother have
divorced, this can be especially stressful. The
graduate may be forced to split time between
your and your former partner's graduation
celebrations, but this does not have to be so.
Guilt works wonders, especially if you are able
to invite the most obscure relative and promise
the most expensive graduation dinner.
Some people invite everyone to the event,
thinking that the greatest spectacle both estab
lishes just how much you care about your child
and how much you, vicariously, are loved. Get
the grandparents and the extended family, but
also make a concerted effort to fly in the third
cousins from Scotland who have never met the
graduate. Graduations really bring families to
gether, and this will set a nearly impossible stan-
