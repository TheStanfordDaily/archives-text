## ASSU needs reform 
### FARIS MOHIUDDIN 
There are plenty of theories about why the
ASSU doesn't 'matter' to the average student.
After four years as both an insider and a specta
tor, I figured I'd give it a shot before I leave the
Farm. It's simple: the ASSU provides candidates
no incentive whatsoever to make practical or
well-informed promises.
You can't really blame candidates. If they
want to win. they have little option but to amass
that laundry list of token issues, to mangle their
names into something witty, to hit the endorse
ment trail and flood dorms, kiosks and even

You'TUbe with propaganda.
I contend that the following steps would re
align candidate interests to foster a more experi
enced. informed and accountable ASSU Senate
and Executive. For some background, the ASSU
endowment, not your student fees, finance
salaries for some members of the Undergradu
ate Senate and the ASSU Executive. Altering
the way ASSU office holders are compensated
may change who chooses to run, who wins and
their degree of commitment while in office.
First, provide incentives to encourage Sena
tors to run for reelection. Empirically,most Sen
ators opt not to seek reelection. While some
turnover is advisable, retaining Senators en
hances institutional memory and issue-specific
expertise. Mow do you encourage senators to
run for reelection? Pay them more than first
year senators with comparable responsibility.
Second.create incentives for upperclassmen
to run for the Senate. Sure, rising sophomores
bring fresh insight to address campus issues; but

I believe there are meaningful benefits to in
creasing the proportion of upperclassmen in the
Senate. Upperclassmen are more likely to un
derstand how things work at Stanford and why
they are that way. Students who have already
taken on leadership roles in other groups and
experienced different facets of campus life intu
itively seem better-equipped to tackle ASSU
policies or problems than students still growing
acclimated to campus. Upperclassmen opt not
to run for the Senate likely because they face
greater academic and extracurricular opportu
nity costs than freshmen. Thus, upperclassmen
should be compensated more so than under
classmen with comparable responsibilities to
offset that disparity in opportunity cost.
Finally, make the compensation for ASSU
1 executives performance-based. Since ASSU
Execs rarely can (due to graduation) or even
want to (due to exhaustion) run for reelection.
