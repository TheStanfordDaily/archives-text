## Shuttle to provide cheap airport travel Travel-ready students welcome alternative 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
For Pat Bugas '10, getting to and
from the airport this year has been
no small feat.
"The first time I tried going
home it was hellish," recalled Bugas
of his journey to the San Francisco
Airport (SFO) during Thanksgiving
break.
Rather than pay for a pricey
shuttle. Bugas decided to walk his
heavy bag to the Palo Alto CalTrain
station — only to miss the train and
take a one-and-a-half hour long bus
ride to the airport.
But starting next week, travelers
like Bugas will no longer have to
scramble to make their way to the
airport. A new shuttle service, spon
sored by the Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council
(GSC), will run every hour to SFO
and every two hours to the San Jose
airport (SJC) next Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday for $5. Stu
dents can make reservations online
to save a seat on one of three 47-
passenger buses that will be shut
tling students starting at noon on
Wednesday.
"The idea for the shuttle has
been around for awhile, but we de
cided this year finally to bring it
about," Senator Jonathan Kass '10,
co-sponsor of the shuttle bill, said in
an email to The Daily. "1 know that
when I go home for breaks, I'm
faced with the choice of an expen
sive Super Shuttle or public trans
portation with difficult time sched
ules and a lot of waiting,"
"There was a ride-share program
that last year's executives endorsed
— but it largely failed," said ASSU
Vice President Mondaire Jones '09,
the bill's author. "There was a lack
of coordination and it was nowhere
near as organized as something as
an airport shuttle."
Jones said the process for using
this year's shuttle is simple: go on
line. place a reservation for $5. print
out confirmation and show up for
the shuttle.
"The primary motivation of this
is to be a service to the students —

which is why we're not charging a
hefty sum of money." he said. "The
$5 is just an incentive to get people
to show up to their appointment."
Due to a lack of successful shut
tle services in the past, the ASSU
will use this year's pilot program to
assess how well the service works
and will adjust the service accord
ingly for the future.
"The initiative this quarter is a
pilot effort," Jones said. "We want
to gauge how many people are in
terested in the service."
Students, particularly freshmen
who are not allowed to have cars on
campus, were receptive to the idea
of a shuttle service.
"I think it will be popular espe
cially with people who live far
away," said Caroline Watts '10. "1
definitely think it will be used a
lot."
"I have a bunch of friends who
usually have to hire a Super Shu
ttle," Bugas added, "so 1 think that
[the shuttle service] would be pret
ty popular among a good portion of
people."
Jones noted the ASSU would ul
timately like to receive special fees
funding for the shuttle service if it
proves successful.
Funding for the service was
drawn from the General Fee Re
serve — extra money that is not
being used by the Undergraduate
Senate. The GSC also contributed
some money, though not as much as
the planning committee had hoped.
"We're perfectly fine about
that." said Jones in response to the
GSC's decision to fund $3,500 for
the service, only half of what they
were expected to contribute. "We
were not upset at all. We expect un
dergrads to use this service more
than grad students and that's the re
ality of it."
"Regardless of if this project
succeeds to the degree that we ex
pect and hope it to, I'm very glad we
are trying it out," Kass said. "We see
that the student body has a need,
and we get proactive about it. That
is our job on ASSU."
Both undergraduate and gradu
ate students can view schedules and
make reservations for airport shut
tles at http://egroups.stanford.edu/.
