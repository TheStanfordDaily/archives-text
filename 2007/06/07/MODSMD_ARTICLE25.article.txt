Students in a charitable mood can do
nate new and used goods at collection
sites around campus as they clean out
their dorm rooms for the summer. From
June 12 to 18, Inn Vision Clothes Closet, a
local community service group, will hold

a clothing drive benefiting local homeless
shelters.
In addition to men's and women's
clothing, organizers of the drive hope to
collect backpacks, sleeping bags, new
gifts and unopened food. Donation bins
will be located at residence halls across
campus, including Branner.Toyon, Stern.
Wilbur, Lantana, Castano, Kimball, Mir
rielees. Rains, Lyman, Governor's Cor
ner. Lagunita. Roble and Florence
Moore Hall.
This year the annual drive, now in its

sixth year, was organized by Inn Vision
Clothes Closet, which is part of the Op
portunity Center in Palo Alto. Night Out
reach, a Stanford community service
group, is helping recruit volunteers, and
Stanford Housing is also supporting the
drive.
Night Outreach co-President Dawn
Kwan '09 said that volunteers are still
desperately needed in order to make the
drive happen.
