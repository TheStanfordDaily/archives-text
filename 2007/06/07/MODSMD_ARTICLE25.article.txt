### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Students in a charitable mood can do
nate new and used goods at collection
sites around campus as they clean out
their dorm rooms for the summer. From
June 12 to 18, Inn Vision Clothes Closet, a
local community service group, will hold

a clothing drive benefiting local homeless
shelters.
In addition to men's and women's
clothing, organizers of the drive hope to
collect backpacks, sleeping bags, new
gifts and unopened food. Donation bins
will be located at residence halls across
campus, including Branner.Toyon, Stern.
Wilbur, Lantana, Castano, Kimball, Mir
rielees. Rains, Lyman, Governor's Cor
ner. Lagunita. Roble and Florence
Moore Hall.
This year the annual drive, now in its

sixth year, was organized by Inn Vision
Clothes Closet, which is part of the Op
portunity Center in Palo Alto. Night Out
reach, a Stanford community service
group, is helping recruit volunteers, and
Stanford Housing is also supporting the
drive.
Night Outreach co-President Dawn
Kwan '09 said that volunteers are still
desperately needed in order to make the
drive happen.
"[We need] volunteers to help
pick up goods and sort them each day
from June 13 to 19," she said. "Mon
day the 18th is the most important
day."
Kwan challenged students to take
a more active role in the off-campus
community.
"I definitely think that [the] Stan
ford community as a whole can he

come more giving to the community
â€” step out of the Stanford bubble
once in a while and realize there is a
larger community outside." she said.
"The unhoused in Palo Alto really ap
preciate it when Stanford students
cook and serve breakfast or bring
food and talk to them during the night
walks."
Night ()utreach hosts walks on the
streets of downtown Palo Alto every
Friday night, during which members
talk and distribute sandwiches and
basic necessities to the unhoused and
at-risk.The walks meet at 7 p.m. at the
I laas Center for Public Service.

'ITie Opportunity Center will use
the donated items in conjunction
with its program to offer permanent
housing to homeless persons in the
area.
"The more [people) who know
about the secondhand clothing bins,
the less waste we will generate at the
end of this year," Kwan said in an
email to The Daily.
Interested volunteers should con

Clothes Closet at ehhl99B@aol.com.
