### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Last Iliesday. more than two
years after the President's Office
of Science and Technology Policy
should have chosen the eight win
ners of the 2005 National Medal
of Science, President George W.
Bush announced that Emeritus
Psychology Prof. Gordon Bower
and Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron
Ph.D. 4 64 had won the nation's
most prestigious honor for scien
tific contribution.
Since its establishment in 1959,
34 Stanford scholars — including
Bower and Efron — have won
the award, which recognizes re
searchers who have contributed
to the physical, mathematical, bi
ological, engineering, social and
behavioral sciences.
Efron, who focused his career
on theoretical and applied statis
tics, was recognized for his inven
tion of the bootstrap method, along
with his contributions to nonlinear
statistical problems, medicine, as
tronomy and physics. In addition to
winning the 1983 Mac Arthur Prize.
Efron also held positions as presi
dent of the American Statistical
Association and the Institute of

Mathematical Statistics.
"I didn't expect it at all." Efron
said of the phone call he received
two weeks ago from the Office of
Science and Technology Policy
Director John Marburger Ph.D.
"67, telling him that he had won
the award."Statisticians don't win
many awards."
Both Efron and Bower were
asked to keep their awards secret
until the president made an offi
cial announcement last week.The
recipients were told that the
award's tardiness was due to
scheduling difficulties with the
president, and that the Office of
Science and Technology Policy
has a backlog of annual awards.
Bower, who was ranked the
42nd most eminent psychologist
of the 20th century by the "Re
view of General Psychology," won
the award for his research in cog
nitive and mathematical psychol
ogy. and for his studies on analysis
and reasoning. Bower was chair of
the psychology department from
1978 to 1982 and associate dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences from 1983 to 1986.
"My wife will accompany me,"
Bower said in reference to the July
ceremony that will be held at the
White House. "It's the least I can
do for all those years of being my
companion and making my life
easy to be a scholar and scientist."
