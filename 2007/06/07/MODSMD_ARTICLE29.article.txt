## Surgery simulation center opens Training facility offers resources for students 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Medical School students who
dread working with cadavers can
breathe a sigh of relief. Stanford
Hospital's Goodman Simulation
Center — a new 1,350 square foot
training facility — opened its doors
last Friday after eight years of plan
ning and development.
"[Simulation] is really a tech
nique. not a technology" said Sandra
Feaster, program director of the
Center for Immersive Simulation-
Based Learning (CISL). which over
sees Goodman. "We like simulations
because with a manikin we can do
things over again. A manikin doesn't
mind being taken to the brink of
death and being brought back."
"In a simulated environment with
devices and tools and technologies
people can practice, learn and make
mistakes," Department of Surgery
Chair Tom Krummel added. "It can
disconnect the care of patients from
the learning to take care of patients."
Goodman will showcase devices
that simulate the look and feel of
human tissues, as well as task-train
ing simulations for several types of
major surgery. The center will em
phasize multidisciplinary team train
ing and provide audio-video debrief
ing and teleconferencing.
Krummel said that Goodman
steps away from the traditional mas
ter-and-apprentice model that has
survived medical training for more
than a century. The facility will en
able students, medical staff and prac

ticing physicians to simulate medical
scenarios without worrying about
harming patients.
"Historically, medical education
in this country has been built on an
apprentice-like model," Krummel
said. "There wasn't the freedom to
fail, where you could be allowed to
make a mistake. When you're taking
care of patients that's not feasible."
"Tradition is very prevalent in
medical education [and] that has
been largely unchanged in the last
1 (K) years." he added. "Inertia and
tradition are very powerful forces
but we think now is a time to shake
things up a bit."
Krummel said the facility's loca
tion is one of its most important at
tributes. comparing its accessibility
to that of a putting green next to the
first tee at a golf course. Goodman's
location will allow practicing physi
cians, including surgeons, to warm up
before surgeries, he said.
"In order to make simulation ac
cessible it needs to be where busy cli
nicians work."' Krummel said."lf you
put such a thing next door to the
bookstore on the Stanford campus,
the chance that a busy surgeon or
resident will get there is minimal."
But although Krummel has been a
staunch advocate for the facility, it
took some time to bring others
around to his way of thinking. He
said such programs are expensive,
and have required proof of suc
cess.
"One [concern| was efficacy." he
said. "In other words, how do we
know it works?"
Feaster claimed that using simula
tions for training purposes is an ap
proach that has no downside.
"It's a shame we didn't do it 20
years ago, but the techniques weren't

there." she said.
ITie Goodman facility is the latest
in a series of simulation-based train
ing and research centers coordinated
by CISL at Stanford. Unlike existing
facilities, however, the Goodman will
be housed within Stanford Hospital
itself.
Feaster lauded the efforts of Med
ical School Associate Dean for Im
mersive and Simulation-Based
Learning David Gaba, whose posi
tion was created two years ago.
"We're actually the world pio
neers in simulation-based learning."
she said.

Medical students express excitement
at the opening of the Goodman Sim
ulation Center, a training facility that
will allow students to practice various
surgeries with advanced equipment.
