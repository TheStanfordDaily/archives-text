# Architect plans big makeover
## A 						new Graduate School of Business in a new location is one part of a return to the principles of Stanford's original plan 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
The face of the Stanford campus will
change dramatically over the next 20 years
as the University undergoes significant ar
chitectural modifications, according to Uni
versity Architect David Lenox. Major
changes will include a new Graduate School
of Business (GSB) campus, the construction
of a new residence complex and the reorgan
ization of many existing buildings and fea
tures.
Lenox, also the director of Campus Plan
ning and Design, said the proposed alter
ations were largely influenced by the styles
developed in the original master plan for the
University laid down by famed architect
Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed

New York City's Central Park.
" l"he original campus framework for
growth envisioned a series of quadrangles
along an East /West axis centered on the
Main Quad." Lenox said in an email to The
Daily. "These quadrangles will serve as the
tool to organize a Science and Engineering
quad, as well as a new quad on the East side
of campus anchored by Encina Commons,
Toyon Hall and a future undergraduate
dorm complex."
Some of the changes. Lenox said, will he
made in an effort to "encourage movement
around campus and multi-disciplinary collab
oration among faculty, students and re
searchers." Among these proposed future de
velopments is a new series of buildings for the
CiSB that will he constructed at the end
of Serra Street near Campus Drive.
"[The proposed plan] provides ad
ditional room for future CiSB growth,
and also supports the notion of a liv
ing/learning environment with the
Schwab Graduate Residences,"
Lenox said. "The new GSB facility
will also support the new academic
curriculum which requires flexible,
multipurpose teaching and student
team spaces."
The new GSB campus — named
the Knight Management Center
after Nike founder Philip Knight
MBA '62 who donated $100 million
for its construction — is planned for
20100r201 l.accordingto University
projections.
Lenox said he will remain loyal to
the architectural values of space and
cohesiveness established in the origi
nal plan for the University.
"The original campus plan estab
lished a 'sense of place' and understood
that the design of the exterior spaces be
tween buildings is its important as the
design of the building architecture,"
Ix-nox said. "Stanford has always bal
anced the attributes of the natural open
landscape, intimate courtyards and gar

den spaces and the building architec
ture, and the proposed design and con
struction will continue to focus on this
critical balance."
The architect also intimated that
the campus could be much "greener"
in the future.
"The architecture of Stanford also
was designed to be sustainable from
the time when the University was

conceived and opened," Lenox said.
"Design components such as arcades
to shade the sun, natural ventilation,
drought tolerant landscaping, [and|
natural interior light will continue to
build on the foundation of the original
sustainable concepts."
