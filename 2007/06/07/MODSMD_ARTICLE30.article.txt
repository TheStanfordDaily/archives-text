## Hidden Stanford Eateries Take a 'Byte' out of this cafe 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION MEGABYTE 
Complaining about the lack of quality
food: as much a Stanford tradition as getting
heckled at Exotic Erotic. And while there's
no doubt that our food situation leaves
something to be desired (Will someone
please sell me food after 11 p.m.? I'm drunk!
I'll buy anything!), it's also true that several
great on-campus locations just haven't made
the rounds yet amongst undergrads. Bytes
Cafe,close enough to the Quad to allow for a
quick lunch run between classes, offers
maybe the best food on campus at very rea
sonable prices. The word has gotten out in
some sectors of the Stanford population
(I've come to expect an awkward conversa
tion with a TA or professor), but I can't re
member ever recognizing an undergrad
there. Consider this your official notice.
Open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day,
Bytes is housed in the David Packard Electri
cal Engineering building,on Serra Street past
the psych corner of the Quad. Its futuristic,
sanitary decor goes well with the historical
computer exhibits on display elsewhere in the
building, though it makes an odd contrast
with the rich, warming fare on the menu. Still,
at least someone thought about how to design
the place. That's what sets Bytes apart from
other campus food destinations: From the
streamlined interior to the creative, well
thought-out menu to the trained, courteous
service, they do everything they can to create
a pleasant meal.The overall experience is like
going out to a quality restaurant. After order
ing your food, you receive a numbered flag.
The cafe offers both indoor and outdoor seat
ing. Your food is carried out to your table.

usually within a few minutes of ordering. On
my visits, the staff was always good-natured
and helpful. Maybe great service isn't what
everyone's looking for in a campus establish
ment. but I found it a nice change of pace
from the mercenary diffidence you endure at
— well,you know.
The lunch menu at Bytes features soup,
salads, pizza, sandwiches, and frequently
changing specials. In addition to various bot
tled sodas and teas, they offer espresso drinks.
Prices range from $(S-$7 for heaping salads
and generous sandwiches with a side includ
ed. On a recent visit, the menu featured two
specials. I chose a spinach and potato frittata
over pasta carbonara with onion cream,
which sounded delicious but a little heavy for
a hot spring day. The frittata (an Italian take
on an omelet) was dense, almost cake-like,

and had a nicely browned, peppery crust. It
came with a green salad dressed in a mus
tardy vinaigrette tljat went perfectly with the
rich frittata.
Bytes does a good version of the popular
mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich. The
tender mozzarella came couched between
slices of focaccia bread with fresh basil leaves
and a chunky, garlicky pesto sauce. Pretty
soon we'll have the perfect tomatoes to make
this sandwich really brilliant. The star of the
plate though was the potato salad. In place of
the standard mayonnaise-drenched goo.
Bytes opts for tender chunks of potato in a
light, zingy dressing with lots of lemon juice
and chives.
Next time you're deciding between Sub
way and Jamba Juice, give Bytes a shot. It's
one of the hidden gems of Stanford campus.
