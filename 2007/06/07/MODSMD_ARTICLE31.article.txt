# Short summer reads
## 
### KAT LEWIN A D.D BOOK WORM 
We've all said it. This summer, between
your Google internship, going to the gym
every day and finally starting that soon-to
be-classic online comic, you are going to
start reading for pleasure again. After nine
months of poring over chem textbooks and
poli sci essays, you finally have lime to set
tle down and read a novel for pleasure. But
the sad truth is: ()nce you give a busy Stan
ford student three months of time to him
self. chances are he's going to get even
busier.
So here are five short novels (most
under 2(H) pages) to fill up the literary
cracks of your summer. Whether you're
frantically checking titles off of your 50-
books-a-year New Year's resolution or just
looking for something to pass the time dur
ing a long flight, these can be devoured in
two or three sittings and will almost deli
nitely leave you satisfied.
I: A Moveable Feast. Ernest Heming
way. I l >l pg. Nuts to Old Man and the Sea.
Of Hemingway's shorter works, this is the
funniest and the most undeniably Hem.
The posthumously released novella de
scribes his lean and happy years as an ex
pat in Paris.and features a cast of unbeliev
able cultural cameos (James Joyce,
Gertrude Stein. E/ra Pound) all situated in
Hemingway's clean, muscular prose. An
absolute must-read if you're going abroad
next fall or if you want to know why F.Scott
Fit/gerald was the worst road-trip buddy
ever.
2: Confessions of Max Tivoli, Andrew
Sean Greer,264 pg.The story follows Max
Tivoli who. due to some sci-fi-esque med
ical disorder, is born as a child who looks
like an old man and. as he ages mentally,
grows physically younger. It's set in tum
of-the-century San Francisco, and l'ivoli's
attempts to fit in with uptight societal val
ues while concealing his' monstrosity" are
as compelling as they are heart-breaking.
In spite of its sci-fi and historical bents,
though, the novel is ultimately an insight
ful and deeply melancholy look at univer

sal themes like betrayal.obsession and the
intoxication ol first love. Trust me. in SO
years college students are going to be
studying this book.
3: The Dog of the Marriage: Stories.
Amy Hempel, 160 pg. Reading a short
story by Amy Hempel is like eating a meal
of only appetizers and dessert: Vou get
right down to nothing but the good stuff.
ITiis collection of haunting and moving
stories is a departure from her usual
comedic style, and every word seems care
fully chosen to get right to the piece's
essence. One of the best is "The Uninvit
ed." a tense piece about a 50-year-old
woman waiting for the results of a preg
nancy tesf.the potential father is either her
husband or her rapist.The different stories
create a world that is lonely and anguished,
but marked bv moments of beauty.
4: Vanishing Point. David Markson.
pg.'lTiis novel's experimental form isn't for
everyone,but if you're interested in cultur
al scandal and the writing process, it's
worth a read.The book is written in an ag
gressively anti-novelistic format: li s essen
tially a long list of two- to five-line quota
tions and anecdotes about famous writers
and artists (did you know Brahms was a
blond and TS Eliot was afraid of cows?),
which a fictional Author is trying to weave
into a book. It's abstract and self-referen
tial, but Markson skillfully weaves every
thing together and reveals much about the
Author on the way.
5: Time's Arrow. Martin Amis. 176 pg.
The story is told by a narrator who is liv
ing inside the body of kindly old doctor
Ted Friendly, watching Friendly's life play
out in reverse. Literally, imagine watching
a VHS in rewind. For SO years. The narra
tor describes a world where garbage
trucks give people trash and where doc
tors rip open stitches and put bullets into
their patients' bodies. Don't be fooled by
the book's slenderness: When I read it, it
almost broke my brain. But the back
wards device doesn't feel gimmicky or
wear thin, and ends up making an inter
esting statement on morality and con
sciousness.
