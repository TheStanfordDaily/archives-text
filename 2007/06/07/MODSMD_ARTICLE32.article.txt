# The 						death of an old rivalry
## 
### 
There was a time not so long ago,
when every pitch of a Red Sox-
Yankees showdown was worth
watching — whether it was in April or
October, there was hound to he
drama. The Sox were the heartbreak
ing version of Chicago's lovable losers.
The "Oh So Close" crew you couldn't
help but feel sorry for.The Yankees,on
the other hand, embodied confidence,
winning and a certain kind of old
school class (at least if you listened to
New Yorkers, they did).
Every game was a clash of ideolo
gies that pitted opposite sides of the
sports fan's ethos against one another.
As we admired the loyalty of the Red
Sox fans in the face of the certain
doom of the Curse of the Bambino
and envied the annual contention and
frequent victories of the Bronx
Bombers — whose supporters had
never had their own loyalties severely
tested by an overlong championship
drought — we just couldn't look away.
Then, in 2(X)4. something changed.
The rivalry was turned on its head, as
Boston famously (or infamously, de
pending upon your fanatical leanings)
came back from a 3-0 deficit in the
ALCS to win the pennant and eventu
ally topple the St. Louis Cardinals in
the World Series. It was one of the
most magical series of events I've ever
been privileged to witness in sports. It
killed the curse and reversed the fans'
roles.
And it sucked all the life out of the
rivalry.
Maybe it's because the Yankees
are already so far back in the division
that there are some who question
whether it's safe to say they're done.
Of course, it isn't safe to say that; it's
never safe in June, unless your team is
the Royals, Devil Rays. Rockies or Na
tionals. but nevertheless, the fact that
the question is being raised speaks
volumes for the current state of the
Yankees.
Maybe it's because New York
owner George Steinbrenner's ru
mored ill-health has supposedly kept
him out of the spotlight, as well as re
duced his meddling to the level of just
your average psychotic team boss
(like Mark Cuban), rather than his
normal, public relations and team har
mony train-wreck self.
But in my opinion, it's because
there's no more curse — no more
Yankee mystique of certain victory:
the farce has been unmasked. The ri
valry has never seemed more merce

nary or more meaningless for as long
as 1 can remember, and 1 can't help
feeling I'm not alone in that.
The competition is as incestuous
as ever, with Johnny Damon in center
and Roger Clemens soon to be re
turning to the mound for the Yanks,
while the Sox have merely adopted
New York spending practices — dol
ing out a boatload of cash to net
Daisuke Matsuzaka and J.D. Drew in
the offseason. New York, feeling the
need to acquire its own overpaid out
fielder and Japanese import, added
Bobby Abreu in a trade last season
and signed the (so far) completely
useless Kei Igawa to offset the actual
ly credible pitching presence of Dice-
K.
But it's just not the same. Now,
when the Yankees make a move that
reeks of stupidity, it's no surprise to
see it fail, and the generally well-run
Red Sox are succeeding, as expected.
With the "curse" broken, I'm not on
the edge of my seat waiting for the
late-season collapse in Boston, and
neither are you. Meanwhile, the Yan
kees are free to be the wild-spending
buffoons they've seemed like for so
long.
But the networks don't get it.They
don't understand that the rivalry' has.
sadly, become irrelevant by June this
year. Roger Clemens can't save the
Yankees, nor can anyone else. And in
the AI. Hast.no one can stop the Red
Sox—Boston's rotation is just too
deep, and its lineup, even without
strong contributions from Manny
Ramirez or Drew, has been plenty po
tent.
Which is why I have no idea how it
came to be that on Saturday after
noon I kicked back to watch the Gi
ants take on the Phillies, only to sec-
Boston hosting New York, hosted by
Jack Buck and Tim McCarver. Yes,
that's right:'llie rivalry has become so
boring that I wanted to see Noah
Lowry pitch to Aaron Rowand in
stead.
Now, of course. I'm a rather fanat
ical Giants supporter, but you get my
point. There was a time when every
matchup between two of the game's
most storied franchises was riveting,
but that storyline is dead now. and its
been dead, really, since October of
2004. Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe, eventually. HSI'N and FOX
will have to stop paying so much at
tention to two of the 30 teams in
volved in the game and instead just
concentrate on the best teams out
there from year to year. And maybe,
eventually, a new generation of more
knowledgeable fans will spring up
from the ashes of the Yankees' col
lapse ancfthe Red Sox' rise.
Or maybe Ill just be able to watch
Noah Lowry face the Phillies next
time.

course, made this all up. He has no
rime for baseball because he's too
busy studying for finals. Distract him
