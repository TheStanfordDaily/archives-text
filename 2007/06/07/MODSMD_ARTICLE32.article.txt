# The
						death of an old rivalry
## 
### 
There was a time not so long ago,
when every pitch of a Red Sox-
Yankees showdown was worth
watching — whether it was in April or
October, there was hound to he
drama. The Sox were the heartbreak
ing version of Chicago's lovable losers.
The "Oh So Close" crew you couldn't
help but feel sorry for.The Yankees,on
the other hand, embodied confidence,
winning and a certain kind of old
school class (at least if you listened to
New Yorkers, they did).
Every game was a clash of ideolo
gies that pitted opposite sides of the
sports fan's ethos against one another.
As we admired the loyalty of the Red
Sox fans in the face of the certain
doom of the Curse of the Bambino
and envied the annual contention and
frequent victories of the Bronx
Bombers — whose supporters had
never had their own loyalties severely
tested by an overlong championship
drought — we just couldn't look away.
Then, in 2(X)4. something changed.
The rivalry was turned on its head, as
Boston famously (or infamously, de
pending upon your fanatical leanings)
came back from a 3-0 deficit in the
ALCS to win the pennant and eventu
ally topple the St. Louis Cardinals in
the World Series. It was one of the
most magical series of events I've ever
been privileged to witness in sports. It
killed the curse and reversed the fans'
roles.
And it sucked all the life out of the
rivalry.
Maybe it's because the Yankees
are already so far back in the division
that there are some who question
whether it's safe to say they're done.
Of course, it isn't safe to say that; it's
never safe in June, unless your team is
the Royals, Devil Rays. Rockies or Na
tionals. but nevertheless, the fact that
the question is being raised speaks
volumes for the current state of the
Yankees.
Maybe it's because New York
owner George Steinbrenner's ru
mored ill-health has supposedly kept
him out of the spotlight, as well as re
duced his meddling to the level of just
your average psychotic team boss
(like Mark Cuban), rather than his
normal, public relations and team har
mony train-wreck self.
But in my opinion, it's because
there's no more curse — no more
Yankee mystique of certain victory:
the farce has been unmasked. The ri
valry has never seemed more merce
