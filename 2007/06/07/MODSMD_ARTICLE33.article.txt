# Harbaugh touts Stanford's fall potential
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The Daily caught new Stanford football coach
Jim 1 larbaugh on the phone yesterday afternoon.
He spoke candidly about the academic challenges
Stanford faces — and how those differ from Cali
fornia's — and gave a detailed run-through of his
roster and suggested that rebuilding the program
might be a multi-year project.
The Stanford Daily: Last year, the offensive line
was a major weakness. It allowed the most sacks in
the nation, and the team didn't run it very well. It's
largely the same guys returning this year, so other
than better health, why should fans expect this unit
to be better?
Jim Hurhaugh: One thing we could do is get a lot
more discipline on our offensive line. We need to
control the things we can control, penalties being
one. We can make the game plans consistent.
It's tough to compare systems from last year to
this year, which 1 really don't want to do. but we
need to get ourselves in a position where we're not
beating ourselves.
TSI): On defense, you graduated lots of players off
a unit that, again, struggled last year. You hired a
new defensive coordinator, Scott Shafer, who's
going to switch to the 4-3. but what do you think the
biggest difference will be with this year's defense?
JH: That'll probably be the biggest noticeable dif
ference, the difference between the 4-3 and the 3-4
in lead downs. And the reason why we want to be
in a 4-3 is to stop the run. But when we get into the
nickel-in passing downs, we will use a three-down
line.Generally.it will be a more attacking,more ag
gressive stvle.
TSI):C iive me a few names that most fans have not
heard of, but you really expect good things from
this fall.
JII: [Sophomore] Ekom Udofia has a chance to be
an AII-Pac-10 guy. I look for big things from his

brother [senior] Udeme too. I think on offense,
[junior Anthony| Kimble, [senior] TC Ostrander
and the receiving corps, [sophomore] Bradford
Sherman and |senior] Evan Moore, should stand
out.
On the defensive depth chart:
JH: On the line, we have both Udofias. Ekom and
Udeme, and [sophomore] Erik Lorig's moving

from tight end to defensive end and has a chance to
be very productive, if not a starter. Along with [sen
ior] Emmanuel Awofedaju and (junior] Pannel
Egboh, we have four productive defensive ends.
[Senior] Chris Horn right now is our other starting
defensive tackle.
I think our best linebacker is [sophomore] Clin
and then [junior] Pat Maynor, [senior]
Peter Griffin and [redshirt freshman] Nick Maco
luso. Secondary-wise, [sophomore] Austin Yancy's
going from "O" to "D" and is fighting for a starting
safety spot along with [junior] Carlos McFall and
[sophomore] Bo McNally, who looked good in the
spring. ITiat gives us young talent up the middle,
guys who are going to be around in two, three, four
years.
Right now, at corners, our two best are [junior]
Wopamo Osaisai and [senior] Nick Sanchez. [Se
nior] Tim Sims we didn't get a chance to evaluate in
the spring because he was hurt.
TS1): I see most schools across college football
selling out in order to win: taking kids that would
n't get into that school if they didn't run a 4.4, tun
neling them through easy courses, looking the
other way when they get into trouble. You men
tioned Michigan, but a lot of Stanford fans would
say that's the route Cal used to turn its program
around. What do you think? Do Stanford and Cal
differ in terms of how they prioritize academics
and football?
JH: I don't think there's any doubt about it. It's a
pretty wide gap. Right now. Stanford is No. 1 in the
country at 92 percent graduation, and Cal's at 44
percent. So, I'd say they're cutting some corners.
Stanford embodies the highest standards, really
the character of the school, because they won't cut
the corners to get athletes, especially in basketball
and football. It's an interesting stat of all athletic
departments in the country. Stanford's SAT score is

the highest in the nation, and the sec
ond-place school is 200 points below
Stanford.
TSI): But on the other side of it.the
San Francisco Chronicle ran an arti
cle this week on how Stanford's aca
demic standards made it very tough
for men's sports here. Plenty of fans
think the football team would have
been a lot better with looser stan
dards these past few years. So how do
academic standards affect how you
can recruit and compete?
JH: Communication is the key. It's
our responsibility as coaches to find
the scholar-athletes around the coun
try, get their transcripts, see the work
that thev have done, go to our admis

sions department and get an early
read, find out il they're in the hall
game or not. II they're in the game,
then it's finding what it takes to get
into Stanford, almost a prescription
of what they need, if there's an AP
class they need to take or whatever it
is that will make them admissible and
able to graduate from Stanford.
It's not a huge pool. Stanford's dif
ferent. Ihe sheer volume of players
that can play in the Pac-10 and win a
championship at the Pac-10 level
we have a smaller pool than other
schools do. Hut to me. that's an advan
tage we have to use.We wouldn't want
to diminish the standards of Stanford.
We want to play with smart guys.
We just have to do a really good job
ol evaluating and gathering a pool
deep enough that we can get 20 to 25
playersthat meet the criteria of admis
sions and Pac-10-level football.
I SI): ( 'oaehes always say "Win them

all." but that's not always possible.
What's a final record that you'd be
happy with.but you also think is realis
tic with possibly the toughest schedule
in the country?
.Ill: There' s no doubt we play a very
tough schedule. The goal of our pro
gram is to win multiple conference
championships and treat everyone in a
first-class manner. As far as the delta of
that time, it's our goal to make that as
small as possible.
I believe we can win this year. Right
now we're 111 the process of working to
earn the confidence to win every
game, to expect to win every game,and
the third component of that is to per
form under pressure.
As far as a record. I can't really put
my finger on that now. I think we are
where we are right now.
