This year sucked.
The three biggest sports for Stan
ford athletics — baseball, men's
basketball and football — com
bined had the worst Stanford sports
season in history.
Baseball, a national powerhouse
and annual mainstay in the top-25
rankings, had its worst season in
decades.
Men's basketball didn't have a
horrible year, as director Trent
Johnson's young team even showed
signs of brilliance at times. But the
season ended on a sour note with an
utterly embarrassing loss to
Louisville in the tournament's first
round.
And as for football,.. it's im
possible for this writer to express
how horrible this year's season was.
I'll leave it at that.
Even in other sports where the
Cardinal usually dominates, things
often fell short.
Women's water polo lost in the
national championship game to
UCLA. Women's tennis, after hav
ing won 89 straight matches coming
into the year, had its monumental
streak snapped in a loss to Georgia
Tech. Later, the squad fell short of
winning its fourth straight title, los
ing to UCLA in the NCAA Semifi
nals. Even women's basketball, with
Final Four expectations abound,
couldn't make it past the NCAA
second round.
All told, it was a year to forget.
But despite all the embarrass
ment, all the losses, all the things
that went wrong, things are chang
ing. Before you know it, everything
will be back to the way it used to be.
Baseball won nine of its last 10
games, sweeping Southern Califor
nia to end the season. As bad as the
team's season was, it still finished at
.500 — better than a wealth of other
collegiate teams.
Men's basketball's future could
n't be brighter as the team returns
all of its key players. Freshmen twin
powers Brook and Robin Lopez,
both given the decision to declare
for this month's NBA Draft, stayed
put. With the shooting of sopho
mores Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Hill backed by the Lopez
twins, there's no doubt that bright
things are in the Cardinal's on-court
future. And people are taking no
tice: Stanford was recently listed as
one of the top 15 teams for the up
coming season by ESPN.com.
And football might be more reju
venated than any sport on this cam
pus. With new director Jim Ilar
