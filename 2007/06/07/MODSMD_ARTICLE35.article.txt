# Crew ties with Harvard for IRA silver medal
## Underdog Cardinal men finish just .96 seconds short of champion Huskies 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Iliis past weekends Intercollegiate Rowing
Association (IRA) Grand Final proved a sight to
remember for Stanford men's crew. Not only was
there an even, photo-finish between the No. 8 Car
dinal and No. 2 Harvard, but the silver-medal tie
was the best ever for Stanford's varsity eight.
While neither the Cardinal nor Crimson
(5:34.125) could topple undefeated Washington
(5:33.165), the two teams came within just 0.% sec
onds of the champion Huskies for the slimmest
win of Washington's season.
And in keeping up with the nation's top two
teams. Stanford surged ahead of the previous IRA
champion. No. 3 California (5:40.126), by a full six
seconds. It was the Cardinal's first upset over its
cross-Bay rivals since taking the Copley Cup early
this season.
Clearly, the Stanford eight surpassed all expec

"What the guys did doesn't surprise me," Stan
ford head coach Craig Amerkhanian said. "It grat

potential."
I laving come so close to defeating both Wash
ington and Harvard in Camden, N.J., senior co
captain Donny Simkin had even hoped for more.
"I was excited, but that was dimmed slightly by
the fact we had to share with Harvard," Simkin

said. "I'm also disappointed we weren't able to top
Washington in the end. But nevertheless, second is
something to be proud of, especially considering
how historic of a finish this is for Stanford."
The underdogs — comprised of seniors Kevin
Baum, Nate Rooks and Simkin; juniors Dave
Creighton, Ottavio Siani and Silas Stafford; and
sophomores Alex Osborne, Mark Murphy and
Ariel Dixon (coxswain) — recorded the Cardi
nal's highest IRA finish in history, as well as its
strongest race of the year.

Earlier in the season, Stanford lost to Cal by
more than three seconds in both the annual Big
Row and the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships, after defeating the Bears in early April's
San Diego Crew Classic. Washington, on the other
hand, had escaped the Cardinal by more than six
seconds each at the Windermere Classic and Pac
10s.
"Like in past years, we were quick in the begin-
