# Crew ties with Harvard for IRA silver medal
## Underdog Cardinal men finish just .96 seconds short of champion Huskies 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Iliis past weekends Intercollegiate Rowing
Association (IRA) Grand Final proved a sight to
remember for Stanford men's crew. Not only was
there an even, photo-finish between the No. 8 Car
dinal and No. 2 Harvard, but the silver-medal tie
was the best ever for Stanford's varsity eight.
While neither the Cardinal nor Crimson
(5:34.125) could topple undefeated Washington
(5:33.165), the two teams came within just 0.% sec
onds of the champion Huskies for the slimmest
win of Washington's season.
And in keeping up with the nation's top two
teams. Stanford surged ahead of the previous IRA
champion. No. 3 California (5:40.126), by a full six
seconds. It was the Cardinal's first upset over its
cross-Bay rivals since taking the Copley Cup early
this season.
Clearly, the Stanford eight surpassed all expec
tations — outside its own.
"What the guys did doesn't surprise me," Stan
ford head coach Craig Amerkhanian said. "It grat
ifies me that they were able to rise up and hit their
potential."
I laving come so close to defeating both Wash
ington and Harvard in Camden, N.J., senior co
captain Donny Simkin had even hoped for more.
"I was excited, but that was dimmed slightly by
the fact we had to share with Harvard," Simkin

said. "I'm also disappointed we weren't able to top
Washington in the end. But nevertheless, second is
something to be proud of, especially considering
how historic of a finish this is for Stanford."
The underdogs — comprised of seniors Kevin
Baum, Nate Rooks and Simkin; juniors Dave
Creighton, Ottavio Siani and Silas Stafford; and
sophomores Alex Osborne, Mark Murphy and
Ariel Dixon (coxswain) — recorded the Cardi
nal's highest IRA finish in history, as well as its
strongest race of the year.

Earlier in the season, Stanford lost to Cal by
more than three seconds in both the annual Big
Row and the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships, after defeating the Bears in early April's
San Diego Crew Classic. Washington, on the other
hand, had escaped the Cardinal by more than six
seconds each at the Windermere Classic and Pac
10s.
"Like in past years, we were quick in the begin-

GAME NOTES: No. 8 Stanford surpassed
expectations with a photo-finish against
No. 2 Harvard. The two teams shared the
silver medal, coming just 0.96 seconds
behind the undefeated champion, Wash
ington; the Huskies' win was its closest this
season, though. Stanford also topped No.
3 California by six full seconds after previ
ous losses this season.

ning of the season and then had trou
ble developing our speed, or we
maybe even slowed down a bit."
Simkin said. "But we were able to
come back, especially after such a
devastating loss at the Pac-lOs, and
tind a different kind of speed — one
we had waiting inside us — and get
that monkey off our back with the
IRA."
Stanford gained the confidence it
needed to close out the season with
its very lirst IRA race. ITiough the
C ardinal was the last of three Grand
I'inal qualifiers from its Friday semi
final heat, it was riding the high of
nearly topping the Crimson in'lTiurs

day's first-round heat. Stanford fin
ished just 0.227 seconds behind Har
vard. and with that knowledge en
tered Saturday's final looking to
again catch the Crimson.
"Harvard's a great crew and we
knew they're fast, but we also knew
they had beaten us so narrowly on
Thursday," Simkin said. "So. we had
some unfinished business going into
Saturday. We wanted to win, and
hanging with 1 hirvard to make a six
lane race into a dual race would
leave us in that last 500 meters to re
ally make a move on everyone else."
Amerkhanian agreed that keep
ing up with Harvard was Cardinal s
main strategy and "that if we could
be an equal match with them, we'd
go far."
"Who knew that our prophecy
would be spot on," he added.
At the start of Saturday's race.

though, it looked like it wasn't meant
to be. The Crimson had the fastest
start among the top three teams on
the Cooper River, and around S(X)
meters, the Cardinal was five seats
behind it. As Stanford caught up.
Washington pulled ahead, and by
halfway through the 2,000-meter
race, the Huskies were nearly a full
boat's length in front of the two
vying teams.
Simkin said he didn't notice,
though. The Cardinal's focus was on
the Crimson.
"1 was only really aware of and fo
cused on I farvard," he said. "So from
there, it was a steady grind, making
moves,pulling out some punches and
just going after them."
The motivation worked, and soon
Stanford was in contention for the
title, with both Harvard and the
I fuskies.

"We made attack after attack
after attack and sustained that push
on Harvard, and at the same time we
were gaining on Washington."
Amerkhanian said.
All three teams made one final
push in the last hundred meters,clos
ing out the season with all the
strength they had left. Though it
ended in a title for the Huskies and a
Harvard/Stanford photo-finish.
Amerkhanian and Simkin agreed
the Cardinal had pulled out its top
speed of all season.
"They made the choice as a group
and decided to execute." Amerkhan
ian said of his varsity eight. "They
were going to suffer like never be
fore and exceed their personal limits
and barriers. They dug down deep
and showed what they could do after
working hard for months, and for
many of them, years."

The IRA results will surely have
an impact on the coming years for
the Stanford program. Pulling off
such a large upset will bring in more
recruits and. likely, even greater suc
cess as the Cardinal cements its rep
utation as a top. West Coast rowing
program.
This year's squad — especially its
four seniors, including Simkin. who
will now compete with the U.S. na
tional team — paved the way for
that with such an impressive IRA
final.
"This was their final exam."
Amerkhanian said. '"And what I've
realized in my years here is that Stan
ford student-athletes are good at
taking final exams."
