# Sailing team falls as wind dies down
## Stanford team finishes 12th at championships 
### ERIK ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford sailing was unable to
conquer the waves last weekend
at the Intercollegiate Sailing As
sociation (ICSA) Champi
onships. When the weather

changed, the coed dinghy boats
slid from fifth to finish 12th.
After turning in several big
races on day one to stay within
striking distance, things began to
unravel for the Cardinal over the
rest of the weekend. The wind
died down and the water at the
U.S. Naval Academy became
choppier than anything Stanford
sees on the West Coast. Many of
the East Coast schools seemed right
at home in the larger swells, though,
and were able to dominate the start
ing line as both Cardinal boats strug
gled to find position.
"ilie conditions were extremely
difficult for us," said coach Jay
kehoe, who described Stanford's
challenge like "sailing in a washing
machine." "We sail in a lot of wind
and pretty flat water [on the West
Coast]. We made a few mental mis
takes and that's what hurt us."
The difference the weather made
was clearly displayed in the numbers
Stanford recorded 94 points over
the seven races on day one and 247
over the final 11 races after the
weather turned. The "A" division
boat averaged better than eighth
place in day-one races and worse
than 12th each time after. The "B"
boat's average finish dropped from
5.57 to 10.09 over the same interval.
By the end of the weekend, the
"A" boat had slipped to 12th in its di
vision with 191 points, while the "B
boat finished ninth with 150.
The Cardinal combined to score
341 points. 116 behind the College of
Charleston, the winner and defend
ing champion. Charleston became
the first school since Navy (1993-
1995) to win consecutive coed
dinghy titles.
Stanford's "A" boat was skip
pered by freshman Brian I laines and
crewed by sophomore Kelly
McKenna. Junior Edward Conrad
took over for Haines in the final four
races of day two. The "B" boat was
skippered by senior Emery Wager
and crewed by freshman Leigh
Hammel.
But the coed dinghies weren't the
only Cardinal boats in the water at
the ICSAs. One week earlier, the
Stanford women's sailing team took
third in the Women's National
Championships.The Cardinal relied
on consistent performances from
both boats, which finished within
two points of each other and no
worse than fourth in their respective
divisions.
Kehoe commended the women
for being able to overcome the "ab
solutely miserable conditions" creat
ed by extreme heat.
"I was reallv excited at how well

the Cardinal's demise in the latter part of

finish in the top five of a national
championship, you know you are
doing pretty well."
The two Cardinal boats com
bined to finish worse than ninth (in a
field of IS) in just seven of the 32
races and averaged essentially the
same finish over the regatta:6.3l tor
the '"A" boat and 6.43 for the "B"
boat. Ihe final score for the Cardinal
was 204 points. 72 behind the cham
pion St. Mary's. The College of
Charleston finished second with 176
points.
The women's team was com
prised of junior skipper Evan Brown
and senior crew Joanna Madsen in
the "A" boat, while sophomore skip
per Taylor Grimes and senior crew
Katherine Schlosser were in the "B"
boat.
Despite its 12th-place finish in
the coed dinghies, the Stanford sail
ing concluded its most successful
season yet at the ICS As. Hie Cardi

program best) for the Fowle Trophy,
awarded to the school with the best
overall sailing performance on the
year. In addition to the women's and
coed finishes. Stanford finished first
in men's singlehandeds and fifth in
women's singlehandeds to finish
fourth.
"It was always a goal to win (the
Fowle Trophy]," Kehoe said. "We
worked really hard for this and came
up just short, but it's always some
thing to be proud of [when you finish
this high]."
