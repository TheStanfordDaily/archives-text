# CARDINAL BASEBALL
## Taylor and Davis watching today's MLB Draft 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After a hot. 9-1 stretch run, Stan
ford baseball found itself back at .500
to finish the season, avoiding what
would have been just the second los
ing season in Mark Marquess' 31-
year tenure at the helm of the Cardi
nal program.
Given the number of outstanding
individual performances over that
span, on the surface it would seem
that several key contributors could
be headed for big paydays in today's
annual MLB Draft.
But this year, more than ever, the
draft is full of uncertainty for a Stan
ford program looking to work its way
back to the top of the Pacific-10 Con
ference. despite finishing on such a
high note.
"The problem is you don't know
who's there watching," Marquess
said. "You could have a great per
formance. but if the right organiza
tion or the right person in that organ
ization isn't there to see you, you
might as well be doing it in the
wilderness."
It's an issue that the Cardinal has
not recently faced because of the
team's usual high level of perform
ance. as well as the highly touted
major-league prospects that usually
populate its roster. Last year, when
starter Greg Reynolds went second
overall to the Colorado Rockies, his
prominence on the national scene
led to the discovery of a number of
lesser-known players. In 2007, how
ever, no single player attracted near
ly as much attention.
"Last year, when everybody in the
world — every scouting director or
general manager was there to see
Reynolds — when they saw
Reynolds, they saw [Chris] Minaker
['06]," Marquess said. "You could
have [juniors] Michael Taylor and
Nolan Gallagher play lights out at
USC, but nobody's there to see
them."

"Obviously, it would have been a
lot easier to get guys out here and
watch us play if we'd played better,"
junior starter Erik Davis added, 'it
was brutal to watch games some
times [this year] as a player, let alone
as a fan,so I don't blame them for not
coming. But 1 think it will work out
for everybody, one way or another,
and that's all that matters."
Marquess listed a pair of right
handers. Gallagher and Davis, junior
catcher Brian Juhl, and junior in
fielder Adam Sorgi as players who

could all hear their names called
today and tomorrow as major-league
teams look to build for the future and
fill up their minor-league systems.
But even the players selected
could opt to return for their senior
seasons, in hopes of going higher in
200 S. After a very mediocre 2007
team season, that's a decision a lot of
players could he facing by this week
end.
"The problem is deciding whether
to come back after your junior year if
it's not enough money, and then

work for it your senior year," Mar
quess said. "And that's a decision
they have to make with their fami
lies. As crazy as it sounds, I'm really
not that involved in that decision —
that's something they make person
ally."
One player who could find him
self making such a decision is Davis,
who returned this season from a ca
reer-threatening injury when a hard
line drive hit him in the face during a
Cape Cod League game almost a
year ago.
The story of Davis' injury and
subsequent recovery was well de
tailed in an ESPN.com story by Mark
Kreidler in May. After pitching well
down the stretch, Davis may be
ready to write the next chapter in his
baseball career in the pros, depend
ing upon where he lands in the draft.
"I'm proud of myself." Davis said.
"1 came back from a pretty rough in
jury, and I accomplished more than a
lot of people, and even myself, could
have imagined. 1 can look back at this
season maybe not as being a com
plete success, but in some ways as
being a pretty good year for myself,
personally. But, obviously, I would
have taken a good year for the team
over that."
The Stanford player who is likely
to have his name called high enough
to definitely warrant going pro is
Taylor, who hit .335 with a team
leading 59 RBI and tied for the team
lead with 12 homers on the year.The
strong-armed right fielder is expect
ing to go in the draft's first five
rounds based, in part, on his own
scorching finish to the 2006 season:
he raised his batting average by 40
points in less than a month.
"1 think that there are a number
of teams that are very interested in
my ceiling and my abilities and some
of the talents that God blessed me
with." Taylor said. "It seems right
now that the interest is coming be

Junior rightfielder Michael Taylor is expecting to hear his name called some
time before the end of today's fifth round in the MLB draft. Taylor hit a .335 on
the season, with 59 RBI and 12 home runs, cementing his potential to go pro.
tween the rounds of two and five, in
that area,and I think that all depends
on the game that teams are going to
be playing. Obviously, it's in their
best interest to get you for as little
money as possible, but at the same
time they're vying against 10 to 12
other teams."
Based solely on his physical di
mensions and tools, let alone his fan
tastic and steadily improving statis
tics, Taylor has a lot of major-league

teams eyeing his potential to he a
dominant power hitter in the pros.
"I think his potential is unlimited,
because he's [6-foot-6, 260 pounds]
and not slow." Marquess said. "| \ le'sj
got a strong arm in right field that has
really developed as a fielder. There
was a lot of concern about his ability
to play outfield defensively when he
first started, but I think he alleviated
some of those concerns. And the
great thing you can project pro-base
ball-wise is he improved his power
every year, [in terms of J using the
strength that he has — the home
runs he hit were monstrous home
runs."
Taylor plans to take it easy on

draft day,engaging in what is becom
ing a yearly ritual for Stanford base
ball: having breakfast as the guys
learn about their fellow college play
ers. and even some of the Cardinal's
own, being selected by the MLB.
Intending to "just sit back and
relax and wait for my name to get
called.'Taylor also hopes to cele
brate over lunch.
"It's a very awkward, weird
process, especially the baseball
draft .' Taylor said. "So really. I 'm just
ready for the opportunity to go out
and play. And 1 feel like, wherever
I'm taken, it's going to be in a posi
tion where the team is severely inter
ested in me eventually making their

major-league club. So, I'm really ex
cited about that opportunity and
playing pro baseball every day with a
wood bat."
The draft will be televised na
tionally for the first time today, with
coverage on ESPN2. The Cardinal
will also be watching for the selec
tion of highly touted, high-school
left hander Jack McGeary, who has
committed to Stanford but could
opt to turn pro instead. The latest
rumors, though, have McGeary
leaning toward attending Stanford
in the fall.
