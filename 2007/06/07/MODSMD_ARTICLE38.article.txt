### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After enjoying a week's rest
from the NCAA Regional qualify
ing meet, the Stanford track and
field teams are finished with the
lirst round of preliminary events at
the NC'AA Championships in
Sacramento. Calif.
Having concluded one day of
competition in Hornet Stadium.
Stanford's 1 I men and nine
women are keeping their hopes
high to conclude this Saturday's
final events with the NCAA
crown.
And if the smiling faces of head
coach Edrick Floreal and the rest
of the Cardinal were any sign, yes
terday was a good start.
"I'm in a room full of joyful
people." Floreal said in a phone in
terview. "Once you qualify for
NCAAs, you just have to focus on
qualifying for finals. This is our big
game: it's like the final four. We
had a great day."
Yesterday's results demonstrat
ed that the ninth-seeded Cardinal
women haven't lightened up the
workload since their fourth-place
performance at the NCAA West
Regional and their second-place
finish at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships.
Junior Erica McLain was the
only Cardinal competitor to qualify
for two championship events. She
will enter the triple jump as the top
seed with a distance of 46-5 1/4
(14.15 meters) and she is ranked
No. 14 in the long jump. McLain's
6.27-meter preliminary jump,
though, already put her ahead in
eighth place as of yesterday.
Another top competitor to
watch for the Stanford women is
junior Arianna Lambie, the
NCAA Division 1 West District
Women's Track Athlete of the
Year. Lambie qualified as the sec
ond seed for the 1,5(K) meters on a
4:14.(i5 record.
Junior Lauren Centrowitz is
just four seconds shy of that and
will also represent the Cardinal in
the 1.500: she is No. IS nationally
with a 4:19.76 time. Just on C'en
trowitz's heels is sophomore Alicia
Follmar, ranked 19th in the event,
having posted a 4:20.19.

"I am really inspired and happy
with our team after the first day of
events." Lambie said. 'Since there
are three of us going into tomor
row's 15(H). our goal is for all three
of us to qualify for the finals. I feel
confident that I will qualify, but I
am excited to see the result of the
competition."
liie Cardinal also brings three
women sprinters to the NCAAs.
Seniors Jakki Bailey and Janice

Davis entered the 100-meter race
as the Nos. 20 and 2 l ) seeds, respec
tively. but proved true top com
petitors after yesterday's prelimi
nary heats as Davis came in fourth
(11.50) and Bailey came in seventh
(11.61). The marks are enough to
qualify them for the semifinals as
Nos. 1 7 and 22. respectively.
