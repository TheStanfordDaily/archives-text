### ERIK ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford women's lightweight varsity eight
turned in its fastest time of the season in the Grand Final
of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) Nation
al Championships in Camden. N.J. last Saturday. Unfor
tunately. it was only good enough for fifth.
The Cardinal finished in just 6:44.088. but Bucknell
was untouchable, crossing the finish in a course-record
6:36.096 to become just the fifth different school to ever
win the event.
"The team was a lot faster than we were going [earlier
in the year]," Stanford head coach A 1 Acosta said.
"Everybody on the team, including myself, was con
vinced that this was our best performance ol the year."
Ihe Bison handily downed second-place Princeton
(6:39.543) and third-place Wisconsin (6:40.5). the three
time defending champion. Radcliffe (6:43.405) took
fourth, followed by the Cardinal and Georgetown
(6:47.503).
The race was exciting throughout, with Stanford hold
ing third shortly off the starting line.The women fell back
to fifth after several hundred meters — only to battle
back into third at the halfway mark, evening out with
Radcliffe and Wisconsin. As the race neared its end, the
Badgers surged toward leaders Bucknell and Princeton,
leaving Stanford to battle Radcliffe for fourth.
"We fought pretty hard with Radcliffe at the end,"
Acosta said. "They got us by maybe 10 feet.This was the
most competitive national championship we've ever
had."

GAME NOTES Though it's fastest time of the season, Stanford was un
able to pull out better than fifth. Bucknell won the IRA title nearly eight
seconds of the Cardinal, which entered Saturday's Grand Final
through winning the repechage.
Bui there was tight competition even before the
Grand Final. On the first day of racing. Stanford. Buck
nell and Princeton battled for two guaranteed bids to the
Grand Final.
The Cardinal separated itself by over 20 seconds from
fourth-place Long Beach, but Bucknell and Princeton
finished one-two — 6:40.66 and ft:4O.7K. respectively —
several seconds ahead of Stanford's 6:45.069.
This meant the Cardinal had to compete with Central
Florida. Ohio State and Loyola Marymount in Ihe
repechage for a bid to the Grand Final. Stanford respond
ed to the challenge and easily took its repechage in
6:50.647. 7.5 seconds ahead of second-place Loyola
Marymount.
Comprising the Cardinal lightweight eight were sen
iors Meredith Coleman and Jennie Morawetz; juniors
Kate Hayes and Olivia Prevost (bow); sophomores
Kathy Altman and Jessica Weigel (coxswain); and fresh
men Erin Conlon, Alex Liptsey-Rahe and Anne Stake.
The IRA National Championships brought Stanford's
competitive season to a close, but the women have a trip
across the pond later this month to participate in the
Henley Women's Regatta on London's River Thames.
Both the women's eight and four will compete.
