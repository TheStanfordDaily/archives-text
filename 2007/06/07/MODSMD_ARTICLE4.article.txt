## Med School to ban smoking Pizzo cites health concerns as Hospital plans are finalized 
### ANDREW VALENCIA STAFF WRITER 
The School of Medicine has instituted a new
ban on smoking in all parts of the Medical
School campus. The new policy, set to take ef
fect in August, will ban smoking outdoors with
in the vicinity of the Medical School, according
to Philip Pizzo, Dean of the School of Medicine.

"In addition to the smoking ban that currently ex
ists inside of buildings, the School of Medicine is plan
ning to institute a ban on smoking and tobacco use that
extends both inside and outside of its buildings on the
Medical School campus," Pizzo said in an email to l"he
Daily. "The School is also in discussion with the hospitals
about a similar ban on outside smoking for the entire Medical
Center."

Pizzo said the School of Medicine is in the process of determining how far to extend the
ban; he added that announcements about the new policy will be made once administrators
firm up the specific boundaries. Pizzo said the new ban is intended to be a statement about

the serious health risks posed by
smoking.
"While there are understandably
different points of view regarding
the acceptance of research funds
from a source like the tobacco indus
try, there is virtual unanimity of
opinion that the tobacco industry
produces a product that is dangerous
to human health." Pizzo said. "As a
School of Medicine that is seeking
ways to promote the health of our
community and nation, we believe
that smoking and tobacco use are
sufficiently detrimental to health
that they should not be allowed."
There "is an increasing body of
data indicating that second hand to
bacco smoke in outdoor settings in
creases the risk of disease," he

added.
At last Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting, Pizzo brought up the plans
to expand the Medical School's non
smoking zones during a discussion
about the University's policy on re
search funding from tobacco compa
nies. When asked whether the new
ban would extend to Stanford Hos
pital, Pizzo joked that smokers
would find their way to the Hospital
before long.
While Pizzo has been outspoken
in his endorsement of the new ban,
there is some uncertainty as to how
far the ban should ultimately reach
among those who work and study at
the Medical School.
"1 think that banning smoking
within, like, twenty feet of a building

is great," said Chris Caires, a chem
istry graduate student who works at
the Medical School's Lucas Center.
"But if someone wanted to stand in a
field or parking lot or a designated
smoking area, [then] they should."
Others, though, said they support
the ban.
"In terms of around here, I'm not
a smoker and I don't really like hav
ing smokers around me because
they really do put you in an environ
ment [you don't choose]," said first
year Medical student Jacqueline Ng.
"Designated smoking areas would
be fine, but if they banned it com
pletely I wouldn't really mind."
