## Year in Review: Surprising season, finish for struggling Card Team fell into 9-21 slump for first time in many years, finished at .500 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Part of Stanford's rich baseball tradition has been its consisten
cy. In the 13 previous seasons, the Cardinal qualified for a NCAA
Regional every single year. However, it was the 2007 team's incon
sistency in the middle of the season that lost the Cardinal a 14th
straight postseason berth.
Without an impressive late-season surge, things could have been
far worse.The Cardinal (28-28,9-15 Pacific-10 Conference) rallied
to win nine of its last 10 and avoid the distinction of becoming the
first losing squad at Stanford since 1993.
The winning streak culminated in a road sweep of Southern Cal
ifornia that pulled Stanford out of the Pac-10 cellar.
"The memory' I'm going to take away is how we kind of over
came all the adversity we faced," junior reliever David Stringer said.
"1 heard that this is one of the worst team records in 30 years, and
that's kind of hard to take, but towards the end, the offense especial
ly, really came together. It speaks a lot to the quality of the team and
the caliber of the players that we were able to come back to .500
from such a deficit."
In the first three weekends, Stanford started the season with two
tough series at perennial powers Cal State-Fullerton and Texas.
Coming out of that gauntlet 5-4, the Cardinal then strung together
an eight-game win streak, improving to 9-0 at Sunken Diamond in
the process.
Stanford ended its streak by becoming just the fifth program to
win 2500 games in a non-conference weekend sweep of California.
"It speaks volumes to the expectations we have as a program,"
head coach Mark Marquess said. "To be consistent and have a win
ning tradition over a number of years is quite an accomplishment
that's a credit to the people that have played here."
After the win, Stanford went into a 30-game slump it could not
shake.The Cardinal went just 9-21 over the period, and the pitching
staff — whose season-ending 6.01 ERA is the worst in Stanford
baseball's 50 years of recorded history — ballooned up to 7.90.
The problems were not confined to the mound either. Stanford's
82 errors on the season led the Pac-10, and the team simply could
not get the big hit when it needed it most. Not surprisingly then,
Stanford lost its first six Pac-10 series of the year.
"It's unfortunate we were unable to break the bad streak of luck
we had for a month and a half or so," junior pitcher Erik Davis said.
"It's the worst we've pitched probably ever. That's pretty depressing
especially for me, because I didn't do a very good job of setting tone
for our younger guys."
"The problems would vary from week to week," Marquess
added. "Sometimes we'd walk a lot of people, other times we'd give
up a lot of hits or get behind in counts. As crazy as it sounds when we
started slowly — especially the older guys — I think they were con
scientious and wanted to do well so badly that they pressed too

much and then it mushroomed for us."
At the end of the slide, Stanford started to make improvements
at the plate. Junior Michael Taylor (.335,59 RBI, 12 HR) solidified
his spot on the All Pac-10 team' with a second-half surge that kicked
off with a walk-off home run against defending champion Oregon
State, in a 9-7. extra-inning win on Apr. 28.
"Anytime you're recognized for your accomplishments on the
field, it feels good,"Taylor said. "This is a very tough league to play
in with a lot of great players who've been through it.To step into the
class' of those players, not only for Stanford, but for the Pac-10, is
meaningful."
Recovering from shoulder surgery, junior Adam Sorgi (.375,27
RBI) led the team in batting average from his adopted position of
second base to also earn All-Pac-10 honors. Stanford's final all-con
ference player — sophomore centerfielder Sean Ratliff (.339, 45
RBI, 12 HR) — continued his breakout season, his first as an every
day player.
As a team, the Cardinal would hit .305 on the season, its highest
average since 2004.
"We have all kinds of offensive talent,"Taylor said. "I forget what
our average was, but we raised it 25 to 30 points in four or five weeks,
which is something that's very difficult to do. You saw guys come
into their own. like Ratliff with his monster year, and that improved
throughout the year, like [sophomores] Brent Milleville, Cord
Phelps and Joey August."
The Cardinal's late-season surge would not have been possible
without some timely pitching as well. Stringer provided key. long-re
lief appearances against Santa Clara (71P.7 H.O ER) and UC-Davis
(5.2 I P. 3 11,0 ER) for crucial wins.
Erik Davis (4-2), a late-season addition to the rotation after re
covering from a line drive that struck his face last summer, became
the Stanford Sunday starter and tied for the team lead with four vic
tories. He yielded only four earned runs in 20.2 innings over three
games, and even earned national attention with Mark Kreidler writ
ing a story for ESPN.com.
During the final, 10-game stretch. Stanford's two highlights
were a 13-inning win against UC-Davis. where the Cardinal pulled
to a tie in the ninth on a wild pitch and then rewarded Stringer's
scoreless relief with an RBI-drag bunt single from Ratliff. Senior
Ryan Seawell then ended his career with fireworks and pushed
Stanford's extra-innings record to 4-0 with a game-winning, three
run home run in the series opener against USC.
Next year's Stanford team will lose senior Seawell to graduation
and potentially Taylor, [junior] Nolan Gallagher, Sorgi, Davis and
[junior] Brian Juhl to the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. All in
dications are that Taylor, ranked the 100 th best player in the draft by
ESPN's Keith Law, will be the first Stanford player chosen.
At the top of the Cardinal's recruiting class for next year is left
handed pitcher Jack McGeary.The Gatorade Massachusetts Player
of the Year pitched high school ball at Roxbury Latin in the Boston
area. According to the Boston Herald, McGeary is the sixth-ranked
high-school player in the nation, and though there is some concern
he may attend if drafted high enough. Marquess is confident that
McGeary is "academic" and "wants to come to school."
