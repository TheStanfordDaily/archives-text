# CARDINAL SOFTBALL
## Year's highs beat out lows for softball Squad ovecame Pac-10 record, made it to regionals 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
It was a roller-coaster kind of year
tor Stanford softball in 2(X)7.
The squad put together both
seven- and 12-game winning streaks
on its wa\ to a 35-21-1 overall record
and a No. IS final ranking. But the
C ardinal also stalled for a few weeks
during the Pacific-10 Conlerence
season, dropping the team into the
bottom half of the standings.
And yet. Stanford recovered at
the end to linish on a high note. After
losing the first game ol the NCAA
Regionals to Fresno State, the Cardi
nal fought back to eliminate the Bull
dogs before succumbing to LSU, 11-
5, in a high-octane affair the next day.
"There were a lot of highs and
lows this year," head coach John
Rittnian said, it was a year where
we had some struggles in the Pac-10,
but it prepared us for a run in the
postseason."
The Cardinal had been on a high
arc heading into the conference sea
son. The team came out of its oul-of
conference schedule with an impres
sive 24-6 record, including five wins
in five games at the Adidas Invita
tional in Miami. Fla. Stanford even
look two ol three from the Oregon
schools in the first weekend of the
Pac-10 season.
Things started to unravel a little
soon after, as California took two of
three from the Cardinal,followed by
three road losses at the hands of Ari
zona and Arizona State. The Cardi
nal posted back-to-back wins in the
conference only once more after that
opening weekend, as the team slid
from the top half of the standings
into the sixth spot, where it finished
the season.
The entire conference schedule
was by no means a failure, though.
The team's potential shined through
in April's three-game set against Ari
zona and ASIJ. the top two teams in
the Pac-10.

After dropping the weekend
opener to Arizona State,4-1. the Car
dinal got up off the mat to down
then-No. 4 Arizona 3-2 the next af
ternoon. That victory was followed
by perhaps the gutsiest performance
of the year, as sophomore ace Missy

Penna dueled Arizona's pitcher to a
12-inning.o-0 tie.
Rittnian identified those games as
one of the most important points of
the year for his team.
"The Arizona weekend was defi
nitely a good weekend for us."

Rittman said. "I like the way we bat
tled at home."
lliat proved to be a recurring
theme for the Cardinal, as the team
battled back from a first-game loss at
home in the regional less than a
month later.
"After losing the first game, to
fight back and get to the regional
championship is a reflection of how
much character this team had."
Rittman said.
That character was coming from
all parts of the squad this spring, es
pecially the freshmen. Rittman ac
knowledged that new players are
wild cards, but he was enthused with
the performances and progress that
he saw this year.
"There's always a lot of uncer
tainty with freshmen," Rittman said.
"They have to make the transition to
college, to being away from home
and playing against tougher compe
tition, but they did a great job of com
ing in and learning and contribut
ing."
Center fielder Alissa Haber and
catcher Rosey Neill led the youth
movement for Stanford. Although
the team graduated two key contrib
utors — left fielder Jackie Rinehart
and shortstop Lindsey Key — it will
see everyone else back next year.
I laber led the Cardinal in the ma
jority of the offensive statistics, in
cluding baiting average (.365) and
extra-base hits (21). Neill threw out
two-thirds ot opposing base stealers
and called the games by midseason.
in addition to providing some pop
from the plate (seven home runs).
Haber also picked up a third team
All-America designation becoming
only the fifth freshman All-Ameri
can in Stanford soft ball history.
Although there were disappoint
ing elements to the season, it did fin
ish on an upward trend. With I laber,
Neill, Penna and most of the starting
lineup returning next year, the stage
is set for serious progress by Stanford
softball in the upcoming seasons.
"The future," Rittman said."looks
very good."
