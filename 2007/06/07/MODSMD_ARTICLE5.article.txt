## Men's golf wins NCAAs Dream comes true for head coach with Card's first title in 13 years 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Men's golf took the NCAA Championships
by storm last weekend in Williamsburg. Va.
when the team won its first national title in 13
years. The Cardinal achieved its season-long
goal after carrying the lead for the duration of
the tournament, firing a four-round, 11-under
par 1,109(275-278-275-281).
"Winning the championship was a dream
come true." said head coach Conrad Ray, who
himself was a member of Stanford's 1994 cham
pionship team. "From the minute we stepped on
course, everything worked out how it had to and
we have had the perfect week. The feeling is
hard to put into words because we have worked
so hard this season for this single goal and
achieved it."
Stanford not only brought its eighth NCAA
Championship trophy back to the Farm — the
first since before Tiger Woods' time with the
MEN'S GOLF

Cardinal — hut also was the only team from the
top 36 nationally to finish the championship
under par.The Cardinal men's consistently out
standing performances in each round helped
them to demolish their competition's chances, as
Stanford eventually built a 12-stroke lead over
second-place Georgia (1.121).
"Winning was crazy, "junior Rob Grube said.
"By the 15th hole. 1 knew that we had locked it
up. It's a great feeling walking down 18th fairway
with coach, knowing that we won the team title.
It's pretty gratifying to see the team waiting for
me to finish so that we could hoist the trophy."
Months of hard work all culminated for the
Cardinal in one wild run to the finish.
"Back in September, we were already work
ing really hard to achieve one thing, to play well
during four days in June," Grube said."Now. nine
months later, our dream was realized by winning
the tournament. Unfortunately, we all had to run
to the airport right after the tournament, but we
held the trophy high all the way through the air
port."
Rounding out the 10 top-team finishes be
hind Stanford and the Bulldogs were Lamar
University and Charlotte (1125; five over par).
Coastal Carolina (1128: eight over par), Alaba
ma (1,129: nine over par), UCLA (1,130; 10 over
par), Georgia Tech (1.131:11 over par), and Min
nesota and Florida (1.133:13 over par).
Grube led the Cardinal throughout the
championship, helping to solidify Stanford's
commanding victory with his own third-place
finish on a six-under-par 274. Grube held the top
spot twice thanks to his top-notch play and
rained 18 birdies over the four most competitive
rounds of golf this season.
"My primary concern was for us to win team

championship." Grube said. "Obviously, there
was some synergy with winning the second run
ner-up for individual crown. Any disappoint
ment over not winning the individual was com
pletely overshadowed by the team victory."
Grube was in a tie for first with Clemson
freshman Kyle Stanley going into the fourth
round, but Southern California freshman Jamie
Lovemark came back from a tie for 11th to win
the tournament. Lovemark blitzed the course
during the third and fourth rounds with match
ing scores of 64. helping him to earn his final,
nine-under 271. Stanley shot a one-under 69 in
the fourth round, putting him ahead of Grube by
just one stroke.
Senior Zack Miller and sophomore Daniel
Lim also put forth fierce performances for the
Cardinal as both fired a one-under 27 l Mt> finish
in a tie for 15th. Miller's best play catae in the
third round when he notched four birdiesUind his
best single-round score of 67 (three under par).
Lim stayed consistent, scoring a one-under 69 in
the first, third and fourth rounds.
In his first NCAA Championship, freshman
Joseph Bramlett jumped up 18 spots in the indi
vidual standings during the fourth round of play,
wrapping up the tournament in a tie for 39th
with a score of 285 (five over par). Bramlett sank
five birdies in the final round for a one-under-par
69. In addition, Bramlett was named to the
NCAA Division I All-Freshman team in recog
nition of his performance at the NCAA Cham
pionship and during the season.
Rounding out the individual performances in
Stanford's final, triumphant victory was senior
Matt Savage, who took 64th in his final NCAA
Championships with a score of 292 (12 over par).
"I think that people will be impressed with
our finish as a team," Ray said. "Rob has been
working his tail off all year and capped off this
season with an awesome finish. Then there are
players like Matt Savage who really fought hard
