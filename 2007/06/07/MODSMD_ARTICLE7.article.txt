# ADMINISTRATION
## Admissions dept. seeks rise in lowincome students Socioeconomic diversify data gets tabulated for the first time this year 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Nearly 1,700 wide-eyed freshmen gather every .Sep
tember for New Student Orientation (NSO), donning
their identical blue name tags, chanting in unison to
dorm cheers and purchasing their very first Stanford T
shirts — blending into a sea of rod. But this year's in
coming class will likely hold a record number of admits
whose markings of social class are hidden amidst the
matching "Class of 2011 "T-shirts.
An increasing number of high-caliber schools are
pushing for socioeconomic diversity in admissions —
not just by boosting financial aid incentives, but also by
taking students' backgrounds into account when mak
ing admissions decisions.The New York Times recently
profiled Amherst College in Massa
chusetts as one of several making an
effort in this area, and Stanford ad
ministrators acknowledge a similar
desire to have students from all
bands of the wealth spectrum.
Admissions
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw said that Stanford has pursued
an "ongoing commitment" to diver
sity and access over the years —
though he did observe a recent in
crease in the number of low-income
and first-generation college stu
dents.
"I think the numbers have been
increasing," he said. "We're pretty
much in line with what Amherst is
trying to accomplish and that is to
provide access for qualified stu
dents."
2007 marks the first time that
Stanford admissions officers have
manually recorded the number of
first-generation college students ad
mitted — a term Director of Admis
sion Shawn Abbott defined as chil
dren with two parents who have not
earned four-year degrees.
Approximately 350 students ad
mitted this year were first-genera
tion college students. Shaw said the
number of first-generation students
amounts to roughly 14 percent of
the admitted class and 13.5 percent
of the incoming freshmen class.
Abbott, who said he could not
confirm a rise in the number of ad
mitted first-generation students
without solid data, cited the nation
wide trend as "a complement to our
traditional affirmative action poli
cies."
"It's actually surprising," he
said, "that it has taken so long for
American colleges and universities
to see the value of socioeconomic
diversity."
Though "first-generation college
student" and "low-income student"
are not mutually inclusive cate
gories. Abbot said that first-genera
tion status was one way that the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admission
measures socioeconomic diversity.
"A student's income is absolutely
not a factor in the admission
process." Abbot said. "Admissions
officers do not have access [to finan
cial data]. We do have access to a
candidate's life experiences, so if we
can ascertain that a candidate is
coming from a socioeconomically
disadvantaged background, that
could factor in positively in our ad
missions decision."
Abbot said that approximately
nine percent of Stanford undergrad
uates come from households with
incomes below $30,000 and about 12
percent come from families that
make between $30,000 and $60,000.
Shaw called the showing of low
income students in the class of 2011
a "strong percentage," though he
said he could not provide concrete
data. He commended Stanford's re
cent financial aid policies, which in
2007 will extend aid reduction to
families earning under $120,000.
"With these new financial aid
policies," Shaw said the student
body "will be more representative
across all four quartiles of the eco
nomic distribution."
Abbot and Shaw also said that
the University is trying to push for a
more diverse class through on-the
road recruitment.
"We're doing outreach in all 50
states." Shaw said. "We've increased
our outreach four- to five-fold in the
last year. We're trying in local com

munities in our outreach efforts to
not only go to those high schools
that have a history of college-bound
students, but those that don't.
After Admission
Neither Abbot nor Shaw could
extensively comment on the experi
ence of the increasing numbers of
admitted low-income and first-gen
eration students. But Shaw acknowl
edged potential concerns of such
students upon entering Stanford.
"There has to be a period of
adaptation." he said. " Iliis is a new
experience tor many kids. Getting
used to the environment is going to
take some time. I think ultimately
everybody does.
Associate Vice Provost and Dean
of Freshmen and Transfer Students
Julie Lythcott-H aims'B9 said she ap
plauded the University's efforts to
increase the number of low-income
and first-generation students. She
also championed efforts to reach out
to such students once they are on
campus.
"With an increased number [ot
such students], a critical mass devel
ops." she said. "You have a place to
turn to if you have other kids in your
midst who, like you. are first-genera
tion. There's a lot of common expe
rience that can be shared and the
participants are enhanced by collec
tive experience."
She said that efforts to identify
transition concerns for such stu
dents have been housed primarily in
the community centers, with which
many low-income and first-genera
tion students identify.
"In the Freshman Dean's Office,
we've only recently begun to tocus
on the community of kids we see [as]
being first-generation, "she said."l d
say we have a lot of work to do to
complement what is already being
done elsewhere. We'd like to join
that effort to reach out to first-gen
eration and low-income students."
Director of Freshman Programs
koren Bakkegard also applauded
the efforts of the Multicultural Edu
cation Training Organization
(METrO). the group that facilitates
"Crossing the l.ine" — a residential
program in which students can self
identify with diverse groups.
"Over the last five years, there's
been an increased awareness among
faculty, administrators and staff of
the presence of first-generation stu
dents on campus," Lythcott-Haims
said." We've always known our cam
pus is diverse socioeconomically.
The concept of being first-genera
tion, the terminology, is a newer con
struct."
"I am eager for first-generation
and low-income kids to let my office
know about how we can construct
programming efforts, outreach ef
forts. resource efforts," she added,
"so as to help them make a success
ful transition into Stanford.
Student Reaction
First-generation and low-income
students with whom The Daily
spoke expressed mixed reactions to
Stanford's admissions push. Some
students applauded the administra
tion's efforts, but said that further
changes were needed to help Stan
ford embrace its diverse student
body.
Milton Solorzano '07 said the
University must take further steps
to promote class awareness.
"Sometimes, the University
across the board has a tendency to
say, 'If we can announce this num
ber. we can announce this policy,
then we've done our job,"' he said.
"It tends to be something that the
University falls back on."
"The thing that I would really
like to see is a commitment made by
the Admissions Office to make sure

that there's some structure to it,
some substance," he added. "If y ol |
admit more [first-generation and
low-income students], but never
make them feel welcome, how does
that benefit?"
Roxanne Parker '10 commended
the University's diversity outreach
and said she hoped that Stanford
would do more to reach out to low
income communities in recruitment,
citing her own experience in
Philadelphia.
"It's a matter of getting the word
out," she said." If you come from the
high schools most low-income stu
dents go to, Stanford isn't really
talked about. For people from more
wealthy high schools, Stanford has
put on presentations. Stanford put
on a presentation in my area, hut 1
only found that out because I went
on the Web site."
Stephanie Hwang '09 — who re
cently completed a documentary on
the low-income, first-generation ex
perience at Stanford with Nicole
Kim '09 for their Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) 2 class — pro
posed that applications be more tai
lored to low-income students, as she
said many do not think they can get
into Stanford.
"I feel like the applications for
Stanford are pretty general and are
like,' What are your activities?"'she
said. "If you were home babysitting
your brother while your parents are
working, then you don't have an ac
tivity."
Kim agreed with Solorzano that
more needs to be done on campus
for first-generation and low-income
students. She wished that faculty
mentors who shared socially mobile
experiences were provided for stu
dents.
"1 think more needs to be done
on campus versus trying to encour
age more kids to come," she said.
"I've heard of a lot of kids who have
dropped out or are really struggling
or getting depressed. It's more
prevalent in kids who come from so
cioeconomically disadvantaged
backgrounds because they don't
know what first-class life is like.
Having adults who are older and can
guide you through is very helpful."
But the biggest concern low-in
come and first-generation students
expressed was the lack of awareness
about class issues on campus, a prob
lem that remains despite the admin
istration's efforts to push for diversi
ty. Kim recalled her own experi
ences as a new freshman.
"I felt like the token kid who was
wondering why I got in and ended
up thinking it was probably because
of my background." she said. "I
found it difficult to interact with a
lot of kids here. [Class] is not talked
about as much as it could be."
"Those of us who are low-in
come, first generation students don't
necessarily walk around with a sign
on our neck." Parker added."lt's not
as easily noticeable as other types ot
diversity."

crease in the number of low-income
and first-generation college stu
dents.
"I think the numbers have been
increasing," he said. "We're pretty
much in line with what Amherst is
trying to accomplish and that is to
provide access for qualified stu
dents."
2007 marks the first time that
Stanford admissions officers have
manually recorded the number of
first-generation college students ad
mitted — a term Director of Admis
sion Shawn Abbott defined as chil
dren with two parents who have not
earned four-year degrees.
Approximately 350 students ad
mitted this year were first-genera
tion college students. Shaw said the
number of first-generation students
amounts to roughly 14 percent of
the admitted class and 13.5 percent
of the incoming freshmen class.
Abbott, who said he could not
confirm a rise in the number of ad
mitted first-generation students
without solid data, cited the nation
wide trend as "a complement to our
traditional affirmative action poli
cies."
"It's actually surprising," he
said, "that it has taken so long for
American colleges and universities
to see the value of socioeconomic
diversity."
Though "first-generation college
student" and "low-income student"
are not mutually inclusive cate
gories. Abbot said that first-genera
tion status was one way that the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admission
measures socioeconomic diversity.
"A student's income is absolutely
not a factor in the admission
process." Abbot said. "Admissions
officers do not have access [to finan
cial data]. We do have access to a
candidate's life experiences, so if we
can ascertain that a candidate is
coming from a socioeconomically
disadvantaged background, that
could factor in positively in our ad
missions decision."
Abbot said that approximately
nine percent of Stanford undergrad
uates come from households with
incomes below $30,000 and about 12
percent come from families that
make between $30,000 and $60,000.
Shaw called the showing of low
income students in the class of 2011
a "strong percentage," though he
said he could not provide concrete
data. He commended Stanford's re
cent financial aid policies, which in
2007 will extend aid reduction to
families earning under $120,000.
"With these new financial aid
policies," Shaw said the student
body "will be more representative
across all four quartiles of the eco
nomic distribution."
Abbot and Shaw also said that
the University is trying to push for a
more diverse class through on-the
road recruitment.
"We're doing outreach in all 50
states." Shaw said. "We've increased
our outreach four- to five-fold in the
last year. We're trying in local com

munities in our outreach efforts to
not only go to those high schools
that have a history of college-bound
students, but those that don't.
After Admission
Neither Abbot nor Shaw could
extensively comment on the experi
ence of the increasing numbers of
admitted low-income and first-gen
eration students. But Shaw acknowl
edged potential concerns of such
students upon entering Stanford.
"There has to be a period of
adaptation." he said. " Iliis is a new
experience tor many kids. Getting
used to the environment is going to
take some time. I think ultimately
everybody does.
Associate Vice Provost and Dean
of Freshmen and Transfer Students
Julie Lythcott-H aims'B9 said she ap
plauded the University's efforts to
increase the number of low-income
and first-generation students. She
also championed efforts to reach out
to such students once they are on
campus.
"With an increased number [ot
such students], a critical mass devel
ops." she said. "You have a place to
turn to if you have other kids in your
midst who, like you. are first-genera
tion. There's a lot of common expe
rience that can be shared and the
participants are enhanced by collec
tive experience."
She said that efforts to identify
transition concerns for such stu
dents have been housed primarily in
the community centers, with which
many low-income and first-genera
tion students identify.
"In the Freshman Dean's Office,
we've only recently begun to tocus
on the community of kids we see [as]
being first-generation, "she said."l d
say we have a lot of work to do to
complement what is already being
done elsewhere. We'd like to join
that effort to reach out to first-gen
eration and low-income students."
Director of Freshman Programs
koren Bakkegard also applauded
the efforts of the Multicultural Edu
cation Training Organization
(METrO). the group that facilitates
"Crossing the l.ine" — a residential
program in which students can self
identify with diverse groups.
"Over the last five years, there's
been an increased awareness among
faculty, administrators and staff of
the presence of first-generation stu
dents on campus," Lythcott-Haims
said." We've always known our cam
pus is diverse socioeconomically.
The concept of being first-genera
tion, the terminology, is a newer con
struct."
"I am eager for first-generation
and low-income kids to let my office
know about how we can construct
programming efforts, outreach ef
forts. resource efforts," she added,
"so as to help them make a success
ful transition into Stanford.
Student Reaction
First-generation and low-income
students with whom The Daily
spoke expressed mixed reactions to
Stanford's admissions push. Some
students applauded the administra
tion's efforts, but said that further
changes were needed to help Stan
ford embrace its diverse student
body.
Milton Solorzano '07 said the
University must take further steps
to promote class awareness.
"Sometimes, the University
across the board has a tendency to
say, 'If we can announce this num
ber. we can announce this policy,
then we've done our job,"' he said.
"It tends to be something that the
University falls back on."
"The thing that I would really
like to see is a commitment made by
the Admissions Office to make sure

that there's some structure to it,
some substance," he added. "If y ol |
admit more [first-generation and
low-income students], but never
make them feel welcome, how does
that benefit?"
Roxanne Parker '10 commended
the University's diversity outreach
and said she hoped that Stanford
would do more to reach out to low
income communities in recruitment,
citing her own experience in
Philadelphia.
"It's a matter of getting the word
out," she said." If you come from the
high schools most low-income stu
dents go to, Stanford isn't really
talked about. For people from more
wealthy high schools, Stanford has
put on presentations. Stanford put
on a presentation in my area, hut 1
only found that out because I went
on the Web site."
Stephanie Hwang '09 — who re
cently completed a documentary on
the low-income, first-generation ex
perience at Stanford with Nicole
Kim '09 for their Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) 2 class — pro
posed that applications be more tai
lored to low-income students, as she
said many do not think they can get
into Stanford.
"I feel like the applications for
Stanford are pretty general and are
like,' What are your activities?"'she
said. "If you were home babysitting
your brother while your parents are
working, then you don't have an ac
tivity."
Kim agreed with Solorzano that
more needs to be done on campus
for first-generation and low-income
students. She wished that faculty
mentors who shared socially mobile
experiences were provided for stu
dents.
"1 think more needs to be done
on campus versus trying to encour
age more kids to come," she said.
"I've heard of a lot of kids who have
dropped out or are really struggling
or getting depressed. It's more
prevalent in kids who come from so
cioeconomically disadvantaged
backgrounds because they don't
know what first-class life is like.
Having adults who are older and can
guide you through is very helpful."
But the biggest concern low-in
come and first-generation students
expressed was the lack of awareness
about class issues on campus, a prob
lem that remains despite the admin
istration's efforts to push for diversi
ty. Kim recalled her own experi
ences as a new freshman.
"I felt like the token kid who was
wondering why I got in and ended
up thinking it was probably because
of my background." she said. "I
found it difficult to interact with a
lot of kids here. [Class] is not talked
about as much as it could be."
"Those of us who are low-in
come, first generation students don't
necessarily walk around with a sign
on our neck." Parker added."lt's not
as easily noticeable as other types ot
diversity."

Nearly 1,700 wide-eyed freshmen gather every .Sep
tember for New Student Orientation (NSO), donning
their identical blue name tags, chanting in unison to
dorm cheers and purchasing their very first Stanford T
shirts — blending into a sea of rod. But this year's in
coming class will likely hold a record number of admits
whose markings of social class are hidden amidst the
matching "Class of 2011 "T-shirts.
An increasing number of high-caliber schools are
pushing for socioeconomic diversity in admissions —
not just by boosting financial aid incentives, but also by
taking students' backgrounds into account when mak
ing admissions decisions.The New York Times recently
profiled Amherst College in Massa
chusetts as one of several making an
effort in this area, and Stanford ad
ministrators acknowledge a similar
desire to have students from all
bands of the wealth spectrum.
Admissions
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw said that Stanford has pursued
an "ongoing commitment" to diver
sity and access over the years —
though he did observe a recent in
crease in the number of low-income
and first-generation college stu
dents.
