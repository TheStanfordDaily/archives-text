The Dean of Students Office, with input from the
Associated Students of Stanford University, is engaged I
in developing a strategic plan for the next 5 years. We I
asked for ideas from undergraduate and graduate I
students regarding offices within the Dean of Students' I
unit. Dozens and dozens of you attended the feedback
sessions and shared your thoughts.
Your help allowed us to learn directly from YOU about
YOUR needs. Your voice regarding our strengths and
weaknesses matters and will help us meet your needs
in the best possible ways. There will be more room for
input on Action Plan Committees in the future.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR
FEEDBACK!
