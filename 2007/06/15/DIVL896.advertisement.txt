I Donate Instead of Landfill!
■ Reuse and Charities
Didn't manage to stuff all of your clothes, books, bedding, furniture, and
office supplies into those two tiny suitcases to go home?
Don't throw away items you don't want anymore that can still be
reused. Instead, donate them!
Clothing and Reusable Round Up
The Opportunity Center and Goodwill will team up to collect
K; clean jeans, tee shirts, sweatshirts and sweatpants, shorts, sleep
ing bags, caps, belts, unopened food, waterproof jackets, winter
jackets, sturdy shoes and athletic shoes, backpacks and rolling
luggage, school supplies and books. In addition, they will accept
fans, bedding, microwaves, refrigerators, furniture in good shape and
working bicycles. On June 11 donation barrels will be placed in resi
dence lobbies. Look for Opportunity Center and Goodwill trucks in West
Residences on Lane L and behind Lagunita and in the East Residences near
Toyon and Branner. From June 14-18 volunteers will begin collecting the donations and sorting them on cam
pus. Collections will end on June 19th. There is an ongoing need for all of these reusable items in our commu
nity, so please be sure to donate the reusable items that you do not want any longer.
Techtain - your trash is someone else's treasure. There is someone
else on campus that wants the very thing that another person is throwing away. Now there is a wav to connect
these people. Currently open to Stanford students, http://www.techtain.com is a socio-commerce
website that matches students who need an item to those who are parting with it or just about to trash the item
The site is free for students with an EDU account. Unlike eßay, Free Cycle, or Craigslist where you search and
scroll endlessly looking for what you want, Techtain uses an intelligent system that allows you to list what you
want, list what you have, then leave the rest to Techtain; once it is available, vou will get an email notification
The uniqueness of the platform is that it has the coolness effect of a GREEN social networking website with a
trust based community that maintains the integrity on the site. Sign in and check it out!
