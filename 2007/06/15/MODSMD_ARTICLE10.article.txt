Nine students charged with Fundamental Standard violations
stemming from the vandalism of the Band Shak last July have been
held "not responsible" by the Office of Judicial Affairs, the Band
said yesterday.
The Judicial Affairs panel decided that eight of the nine students
appearing before it had damaged property, aceording to Band mem
bers involved, but that none had violated the Fundamental Stan
dard.
The latest development comes after almost eight months of un
certainty for Band members. The Band Shak near Fncina 1 fall and
the Serra Complex was vandalized the night of July 17.21)00.
During the ensuing police investigation, nine students were iden
tified and implicated in the incident. On Sept. 14. the University
placed the Band on indefinite provisional status as a student organ
ization. named Associate Dean Chris Griffith as its interim director
and assigned her the task of approving performances. In November,
the Santa Clara County district attorney's office decided not to
press criminal charges.
The Daily contacted several administrators — including repre
sentatives of the Athletic Department, Student Affairs and Univer
sity Communications — seeking comment on the adjudication but
they were unable to speak about the issue, citing the Judicial Char-

ter's ban on discussion of any pro
ceedings. A 1
though initial damage estimates of
fered by the University ranged from
$30,000 to $50,000. the Band says
that the actual damage was around
$8,000.
As far as the students involved
were aware, they said the old Band
Shak modular was going to be de
stroyed by the University after the
Band moved out its decorations,
equipment and files into its new
Band Shak near the former
DeCuerre Squash Courts.

"Prior to the incident, the Band
was not given the indication that the
facility would be preserved after we
moved out," said Band Manager
Adam Cohen '07. in a release sent
yesterday as a response to inquiries
by The Daily. "The vandalism was
absolutely a mistake, but these are
still fundamentally good people
we're talking about, and I'm glad
that the panel chose to consider the
context of their actions."
One of the students whose case
was adjudicated last Friday agreed to
speak candidly about the incident
proceedings in exchange for
anonymity.
"(As the Band was moving out of
the Band Shak modular], there were
Band members that were occasion
ally damaging the building, inadver

tently and intentionally, with little
regard to the fact that the building
would be used again." the suspended
Band member said. "We had little
reason not to [damage the Band
Shak], Once one person started
doing something, the others fol
lowed suit. It did not get far out of
hand."
Members of the Band were opti
mistic about the recent ruling. The
suspended member described the
Judicial Affairs process as "long and
drawn out."
"1 am looking forward to this
chapter closing," he said. The end of
the Judicial Affairs case "will be the
punctuation mark."
