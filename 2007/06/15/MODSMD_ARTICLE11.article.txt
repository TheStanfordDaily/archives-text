After nine days and dozens of missed
meals, the eight remaining participants of the
hunger strike organized by the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SI.AC) broke fast
after the student group reached an agreement
with the University Friday afternoon regard
ing Stanford's living wage policy.
In his third personal meeting with student
representatives. President John Hennessy
agreed to make multiple changes to the exist
ing policy, with the effect of broadening the
number of contracted workers who earn a
wage minimum of $11.15 an hour with bene
fits, or $12.59 without benefits.
The agreement reached on Friday will ex
pand the living wage to apply to workers with
out regard for the duration of their contracts,
the number of hours they work or the duration
of time they are employed.
It does not, however, extend the living

wage policy to cover two of the groups exclud
ed by restrictions specifically targeted by the
SI .AC campaign: workers in unions and work
ers employed under aggregate contracts less
than $100,000 in value.
The amount of additional workers who
might be covered by the agreement is still un
clear. The University has yet to release an esti
mate, but SLAC spokesperson Matt Seriff-
Cullick 'OS said that, while he did not want to
speculate, the number might be "in the hun
dreds."
F3oth parties celebrated the compromise.
University officials talked up the importance
of the meetings, while SLAC activists empha
sized the bargaining power generated by the
fast.
"1 think this shows that when people sit
around a table and discuss issues that are im
portant. they can reach some compromise,"
said University spokesperson Alan Acosta."lt
may not be the absolute everything that either
side wanted, but it shows that when you sit
down and discuss issues that are important,
you can reach some resolutions and improve
them."

Seriff-Cullick offered a different assess
ment. "Most of what matters is not what goes
on in the negotiating room, it's what goes on
outside," he said.
Although SLAC' members downplayed the
role played by negotiation, the group's current
stance represents a softened version of earlier
positions made regarding the goals of the fast.
I lie problem is in the disjunction [that ex
ists] between the business side of the institu
tion and its function as a social actor." Seriff-
Cullick said on Monday of the difficulties
SL.AC faced in getting the University to drop
the collective bargaining restriction, which
bars union-represented workers from the liv
ing wage policy. "There's a very standard busi
ness mentality that prevails."
SLAC spokesperson Shamala Gallagher
'07 had a mixed reaction to the University's
concessions.
"Everyone's happy with the way things
turned out." she said."But there's still that one
restriction that we're still unhappy with."
According to SI.AC, the eight remaining
tasters - who had not eaten for over a week
began a modest diet of toast after being

taken to Vaden Health Center. While all
showed strong vital signs, many lost a signifi
cant amount of weight. One participant re
portedly dropped 1 l ) pounds over the nine-day
period.
The twelve fasters began their protest on
Apr. 12 in an effort to persuade the University
to change its living wage policies.
While relations between the student repre
sentatives and the University may have been
somewhat strained at times during the fast,
both sides ended the ordeal with amicable
words.
"So even though the fight for the justice of
the workers isn't completely over, this is a big
victory" Gallager said. "We congratulate the
University on revising the policy."
The University similarly noted the groups'
common goal.
"At times, you can't help there being a cer
tain adversarial quality," Acosta said. "But the
spirit of this on both sides has been to improve
this policy."
