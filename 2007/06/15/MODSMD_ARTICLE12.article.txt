## CARD WINS 13TH DIRECTOR'S CUP 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 13 was lucky for the Cardinal.
Despite a lackluster season for Stanford's major sports, the athletic depart
ment received its 13th straight Director's Cup.
Awarded by the U.S. Sports Academy to the nation's best collegiate sports
program, the cup is already Stanford's, though two major sports — baseball and
Softball — have yet to finish their postseasons. The Cardinal owns an unbreak
able, 2%.50 advantage over the second-place UCLA Bruins as of June 12. Final
standings will be released June 28.
Contributing to the Cardinal's victory were NCAA titles in women's cross
country and mens golf. Stanford also had runner-up finishes in men's swimming
and diving, women's volleyball and women's water polo, with 15 teams total gar
nering top-10 finishes. The Cardinal scored points toward the Director's Cup in
18 out of 20 possible sports.
The following is a collection of Daily articles on some of those top finishes,
along with the major victories and defeats of the Stanford sports season.
