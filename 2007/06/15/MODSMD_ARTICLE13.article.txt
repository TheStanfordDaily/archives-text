# Bruins douse Polo's title hopes
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Squaring off for the NCAA Cham
pionship on May 13, both the Stanford
and UCLA women's water polo teams
knew that early momentum would be
the key to the game. In the teams' first
three meetings of the season, the squad
that scored first was ultimately the vic
tor on each occasion — and the
NCAA title match proved no differ
ent.
With energy levels high and a palpa
ble tension in the air. the second-seed
ed Bruins took first blood midway
through the first period en route to
building a commanding 3-0 lead. The
Stanford defense eventually managed
to contain the UCLA onslaught, and
the Cardinal attack came to life in the
final period of play, as the top-seeded
Stanford women clawed their way
back to within a single goal of the Bru
ins.
But sophomore Lolo Silver's bid to
tie the score in the waning moments of
the game came up just short.as the Bru
ins held on to claim their third consecu
tive national championship by a nar
row 5-4 margin.
"Coming in, we knew we needed to
take a lead early," Stanford head coach
John Tanner said. "UCLA is a very
emotional team that plays great with a
lead, and giving up a three-goal deficit
is no way to close the lid on such an in
credibly talented and emotionally
charged team."
UCLA junior Courtney Mathew
son put the Bruins on the board with a
power-play goal with 3:11 remaining in
the first, and junior Jillian Kraus fol
lowed two minutes later by burying a
shot from the perimeter to put the Bru
ins up 2-0. The UCLA lead grew to
three as the Stanford offense continued
to struggle to find any rhythm whatso
ever. Silver gave the Cardinal a small
burst of momentum by sneaking a shot
from the right wing past Bruin goalie
Emily Feher. bringing the score to 3-1
at the half.
But neither team was able to muster

much offense in the third period,as the
lone scoring highlight came when
Mathewson notched her second goal of
the game to push the UCLA lead back
to three.
As the final period began, the Stan
ford women were playing as much
against the clock as they were playing
against the Bruins. But senior Katie
Hansen won the opening sprint for the
first time of the match, and Silver capi
talized on the opportunity by rifling a
long shot from eight meters away and
into the top right corner of the cage. Ibe
Stanford bench exploded a minute
laterwhen Silver scored her third ofthe
game on a perfectly directed lob over
Feher's head, bringing the score to 4-3.
UCLA head coach Adam Krikori
an immediately called a timeout to
slow things down, and the strategy

worked as Mathewson responded with
what eventually proved to he the
game-winning goal on the Bruins' next
possession. Stanford sophomore Kira
1 iillman converted a six-on-five advan
tage at 5:38, hut that was all the UCLA
defense would surrender for the re
mainder of the game.
fhe Cardinal had one final shot in
the last minute of the game as Tanner
called a timeout to set up his team's
final play. But after cutting around a
screen from senior Christina I lewko,
Silver was unable to get off a strong
shot under pressure from UCLA de
fender kacy Kunkel. The ball bobbed
up to the cage, where Feher scooped it
up to seal the UCLA victory.
