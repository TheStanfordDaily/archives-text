## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
T ivc Stanford baseball players were select
ed last week in the 2(X)7 MLB First-Year Play
er Draft. While none were chosen as high as
2(H)6 staff ace Greg Reynolds, who went sec-
ond overall to the Colorado Rockies, the
Cardinal's leading upperclassmen still did
well on the whole.
In somewhat of a surprise, the first Stan
ford player selected was junior right-hand
ed pitcher Nolan Gallagher, who went in
the fourth round with the 135 th overall se
lection to the Seattle Mariners. Gallagher
had a disappointing season statistically,
with a 7.27 ERA and 5-6 record, but
bounced back for a fantastic series against
Southern California to close out the sea
son. Against the Trojans. Gallagher pitched
live scoreless relief innings to help lead
Stanford to a .500 finish.
'Being at Stanford these last three
years has meant everything to me," Gal

lagher said to GoStantord.com. "Becom
ing a professional baseball player is a
dream, but playing for the Stanford base
ball program is also a dream...lt's helped
me to develop into the young man that 1
am. and I'm thankful for every second that
I've spent here, and the guys on this team
that I've spent it with."
Junior right fielder Michael Taylor, who
most had expected to be the first member
of the 2007 Cardinal oft the board, only
had to wait a short while longer for his own
selection, as the Philadelphia Phillies
picked him up with the 173 rd overall selec
tion in the fifth round. For Taylor, the
Phillies seemed to be the perfect fit. The
Phillies farm system has recently produced
such first-rate offensive players as second
baseman Chase Utley and reigning NL.
MVP Ryan I toward.
"They showed a lot of interest," Taylor
said to Mike Eubanks ofThe√üootleg.com,
"They were interested in my future power

potential,especially in that ballpark,sort of
along the same lines as Ryan Howard.
That's what they talked about. It's kind of
funny: this whole draft process, that me and
my advisor talked about how the same
things they're saying about me, they said
about Ryan Howard. Lo and behold. 1
went to the Phillies in the fifth round just
like Howard did [in 2001]."
Taylor's offense helped carry the Cardi
nal down the stretch, as the cleanup hitter
likely finished his collegiate career with a
12-game hitting streak and 16 multiple-hit
games in his last 19. Over that span,Taylor
batted .429 and notched seven home runs
and 31 RBI.
Three more Stanford juniors were se
lected after the fifth round on the draft's
second day. Right hander Erik Davis and
second baseman Adam Sorgi both went in
the 21st round to the Texas Rangers and
Philadelphia, respectively. Catcher Brian
Juhl was the final Stanford player chosen.

going to the Cleveland Indians in the 35th
round.
One other player the Cardinal was
watching closely was left-handed recruit
Jack McGeary, rated by Baseball America
as the 27th-best draft-eligible amateur
prospect. McGeary. a Massachusetts high
school senior, had committed to play tor
Stanford but could opt to turn pro instead;
he was selected early in the sixth round by
the Washington Nationals.
It was a relatively slow year for the Pa
cific-10 Conference on the whole, with the
league's first player selected, Oregon
State's Edward kunz, going to the New
York Mets with the 42nd pick overall.
Seven Stanford players were selected in
the 2006 draft, and all decided to begin
their professional careers. Iliis year's deci
sions are pending.
