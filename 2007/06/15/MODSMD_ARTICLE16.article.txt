# Golf crowned NCAA Champs
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Men's golf took the NCAA Championships by storm
May 30-June 2 in Williamsburg. Va. when the team won
its first national title in 13 years. The Cardinal achieved
its seasonlong goal after carrying the lead for the dura
tion of the tournament, firing a four-round. 11-under
par 1,109 (275-278-275-281).
"Winning the championship was a dream come
true," said head coach Conrad Ray, who himself was a
member of Stanford's 1994 championship team. "From
the minute we stepped on course, everything worked
out how it had to and we have had the perfect week.The
feeling is hard to put into words because we have
worked so hard this season for this single goal and
achieved it."
Stanford not only brought its eighth NCAA Champi
onship trophy back to the Farm — the first since before
Tiger Woods' time with the Cardinal — but also was the
only team from the top 36 nationally to finish the cham
pionship under par. The Cardinal men's consistently
outstanding performances in each round helped them
to demolish their competition's chances, as Stanford
eventually built a 12-stroke lead over second-place
Georgia (1.121).
"Winning was crazy," junior Rob Grube said."By the
15th hole. I knew that we had locked it up. It's a great
feeling walking down 18th fairway with coach, knowing
that we won the team title. It's pretty gratifying to see
the team waiting for me to finish so that we could hoist
the trophy."
Months of hard work all culminated for the Cardinal
in one wild run to the finish.
"Back in September, we were already working really
hard to achieve one thing, to play well during four days
in June," Grube said. "Now. nine months later, our
dream was realized by winning the tournament. Unfor
tunately, we all had to run to the airport right after the
tournament, but we held the trophy high all the way
through the airport."
Rounding out the 10 top-team finishes behind Stan
ford and the Bulldogs were Lamar University and Char
lotte (1125; five over par). Coastal Carolina (1128; eight
over par), Alabama (1,129; nine over par), UC'LA
(1.130; 10 over par). Georgia Tech (1,131; 11 over par),
and Minnesota and Florida (1.133; 13 over par).
Grube led the Cardinal throughout the champi
onship, helping to solidify Stanford's commanding vic
tory with his own third-place finish on a six-under-par
274. Grube held the top spot twice thanks to his top

notch play and rained 18 birdies over the four most com
petitive rounds of golf this season.
"My primary concern was for us to win team cham
pionship," Grube said. "Obviously, there was some syn
ergy with winning the second runner-up for individual
crown. Any disappointment over not winning the indi
vidual was completely overshadowed by the team victo
ry"

Though junior Rob Grube couldn't hold onto the individ
ual lead at the NCAA Championships, he led the Cardi
nal to its first team title in 1 3 years, finishing third.
California freshman Jamie Love
mark came back from a tie for 11th
to win the tournament. Lovemark
blitzed the course during the third
and fourth rounds with matching
scores of 64. helping him to earn his
final, nine-under 271. Stanley shot a
one-under 69 in the fourth round,
putting him ahead of Grube by just
one stroke.
Senior Zack Miller and sopho
more Daniel Lim also put forth
fierce performances for the Cardinal
as both fired a one-under 279 to fin
ish in a tie for 15th. Miller's best play
came in the third round when he
notched four birdies and his best sin
ule-round score of 67 (three under

par). Lim stayed consistent, scoring a
one-under 69 in the first, third and
fourth rounds.
In his first NCAA Championship,
freshman Joseph Bramlett jumped
up 18 spots in the individual stand
ings during the fourth round of play,
wrapping up the tournament in a tie
for 39th with a score of 285 (five over
par). Bramlett sank five birdies in
the final round for a one-under-par
69. In addition, Bramlett was named
to the NCAA Division I All-Fresh
man team in recognition of his per
formance at the NCAA Champi
onship and during the season.
Rounding out the individual per
formances in Stanford's final, tri
umphant victory was senior Matt
Savage, who took 64th in his final
NCAA Championships with a score
of 292 (12 over par).
"I think that people will be im
pressed with our finish as a team,"

Ray said. "Rob has been working his
tail off all year and capped off this
season with an awesome finish. Then
there are players like Matt Savage
who really fought hard and had some
solid rounds. Winning this champi
onship truly was a team effort — our
biggest strength all year was having
five guys who all contributed, which
has worked out well for nationals."
With seven team tournament vic
tories, including the NCAA crown,
and four individual victories from
Bramlett, Grube and Miller, the Car
dinal wrapped up a truly fantastic
season. Savage, Miller, Grube and
Bramlett are all listed on Stanford's
season-low stroke average list, and
the four — as well as Lim — have
been honored with all-conference
accolades.
After leading his team to victory,
Ray was named the recipient of the
Eaton Golf Pride Dave Williams

Award, and became just the second
national coach of the year in the
Stanford golf program's history. Ray
has been on the job as Stanford's
head coach since 2004 and was also
named as the Pacific Region and Pa
cific-10 Conference Coach of the
Year.

"Everything is a huge honor,"
Ray said. "Winning the NCAA
Championship and Coach of the
Year is so difficult. I am happy that
things have worked out for us be
cause there are so many great pro
grams and variables that go into win
ning those awards. We have made

some special memories that we will
carry with us forever. We are elated
to represent Stanford and prove to
the nation that we can achieve ath
letic and academic greatness."
