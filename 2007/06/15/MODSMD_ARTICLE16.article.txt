### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Men's golf took the NCAA Championships by storm
May 30-June 2 in Williamsburg. Va. when the team won
its first national title in 13 years. The Cardinal achieved
its seasonlong goal after carrying the lead for the dura
tion of the tournament, firing a four-round. 11-under
par 1,109 (275-278-275-281).
"Winning the championship was a dream come
true," said head coach Conrad Ray, who himself was a
member of Stanford's 1994 championship team. "From
the minute we stepped on course, everything worked
out how it had to and we have had the perfect week.The
feeling is hard to put into words because we have
worked so hard this season for this single goal and
achieved it."
Stanford not only brought its eighth NCAA Champi
onship trophy back to the Farm — the first since before
Tiger Woods' time with the Cardinal — but also was the
only team from the top 36 nationally to finish the cham
pionship under par. The Cardinal men's consistently
outstanding performances in each round helped them
to demolish their competition's chances, as Stanford
eventually built a 12-stroke lead over second-place
Georgia (1.121).
"Winning was crazy," junior Rob Grube said."By the
15th hole. I knew that we had locked it up. It's a great
feeling walking down 18th fairway with coach, knowing
that we won the team title. It's pretty gratifying to see
the team waiting for me to finish so that we could hoist
the trophy."
Months of hard work all culminated for the Cardinal
in one wild run to the finish.
"Back in September, we were already working really
hard to achieve one thing, to play well during four days
in June," Grube said. "Now. nine months later, our
dream was realized by winning the tournament. Unfor
tunately, we all had to run to the airport right after the
tournament, but we held the trophy high all the way
through the airport."
Rounding out the 10 top-team finishes behind Stan
ford and the Bulldogs were Lamar University and Char
lotte (1125; five over par). Coastal Carolina (1128; eight
over par), Alabama (1,129; nine over par), UC'LA
(1.130; 10 over par). Georgia Tech (1,131; 11 over par),
and Minnesota and Florida (1.133; 13 over par).
Grube led the Cardinal throughout the champi
onship, helping to solidify Stanford's commanding vic
tory with his own third-place finish on a six-under-par
274. Grube held the top spot twice thanks to his top

notch play and rained 18 birdies over the four most com
petitive rounds of golf this season.
"My primary concern was for us to win team cham
pionship," Grube said. "Obviously, there was some syn
ergy with winning the second runner-up for individual
crown. Any disappointment over not winning the indi
vidual was completely overshadowed by the team victo
ry"
