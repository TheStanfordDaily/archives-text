### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After trouncing No. 4 Washington to reach the title
match, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team saw
a late rally fall short as top-ranked Nebraska claimed
the four-game win and the 2006 NCAA Championship
in Omaha. Neb. on Dec. 16 [2006],
Stanford did not capture its second title in three
years, but did reach the Final Four for the 16th time in 2(i
years and the final match for the 12th — both NCAA
records.
But in front of a record crowd of 17.209 fans, the vast
majority pulling for Nebraska (29-5), the Cardinal (30-
4) came up short in the championship match, falling 3-1
to the top-ranked Cornhuskers.
"It was an amazing crowd tonight, an amazing tour
nament." head coach John Dunning said after the
match."This was probably the biggest match in women's
volleyball history in terms of scope."
Stanford carried the momentum of the semifinal into
the championship match, taking the first game 30-27.
The Cornhuskers, who beat a tenacious UCLA squad in
four games in the semifinals, tied the match with a 30-26
second game win buoyed by local fans. The next two
games were close, but Nebraska eked out narrow victo
ries twice, winning 30-27 and 30-28 to seal the champi
onship.
Stanford was firing on all cylinders in the first game,
offensively and defensively. The Cardinal notched 17
kills with only three hitting errors and posted seven
blocks in the first frame. After trading points, Nebraska
pulled ahead with an 8-5 lead. Stanford managed to tie
at 11 on a solo block by sophomore Foluke Akinradewo
and quickly built a four-point lead of its own. Nebraska
led as late as 24-23, but Stanford closed out the game on
a kill by senior Kristin Richards, 30-27.

Nebraska reeled off four points before Stanford
could get on the board in the second game, but the Car
dinal fought back to tie. Stanford led at 24-23, but Ne
braska put together a run to finish on top, 30-26, just as
the Cardinal had in the first game.
Sophomore opposite Erin Waller played the best
game of a career match in the third, but the Cardinal still
came up short. Waller notched two kills in the first three
points and with three consecutive kills closed a four
point deficit to just one,a 14-13 Nebraska lead. But after
a 27-27 tie.the Cornhuskers turned to AVCA Player of
the Year Sarah Pavan, a 6-foot-5 opposite, who deliv
ered the final kill in the 30-28 game.
Fighting to stay in the,match, the Cardinal gave up a
5-2 lead to Nebraska to start the fourth game, but re
gained the lead with a four-point run.The lead seesawed
back and forth until the Cornhuskers raced ahead 27-20.
The Cardinal was not ready to admit defeat, however,
scoring seven of the next nine points before Nebraska
clinched the title with a kill by Jordan Larson.
Pavan led the Cornhuskers with 22 kills and Tracy
Stalls had a team-high seven blocks. Libero Dani Bus
boom had 21 digs for Nebraska.
Waller led the Cardinal with a career-high IS kills on
.394 hitting, while four other players had double-digit
kills. Akinradewo finished with 15 kills and a match-high
eight blocks; Richards notched 14 kills to go with 12 digs:
sophomore Cynthia Barboza swatted 12 kills; and junior
Franci Girard had 10 kills and four blocks. Junior Bryn
Kehoe dished out 61 assists, served three aces and dug
14 balls, while sophomore Jessica Fishburn led with 20
digs.
Pavan was named the Most Outstanding Player of
the Final Four and was joined on the All-Tournament
list by her teammates Larson. Stalls
and setter Rachel Holloway. Bar
bo/a, Richards and Akinradcwo
were also named All-Tournament.
Stanford finished the season with
only four losses — a preseason de
feat at BY IJ. conference losses to
Washington and Southern Califor
nia and the championship. The four
graduating seniors—Richards, Nji
Nnamani, I izzie Suiter and Michelle
Mellard — leave the Farm with one
NCAA title (2004) and three Final
Four appearances (2003,2004,2006).
Richards is the all-time digs
leader in Stanford history with 1,597
and is fifth on the career list in kills
(1,819) and aces (126). Suiter's 198
blocks in her sophomore season was
the Cardinal's second-highest single
season total ever.
Also making the single-season
record books, Barboza notched 48
service aces in 2006. putting her fifth
on the all-time list, and Fishburn had
430 digs, also good for fifth. Kehoe's
1.473 assists is the fifth highest for a
single season (she set the school
record with 1.634 as a freshman in
2004) and she is already fourth on
the career list with a season left to
play. Akinradcwo's season hitting
percentage of .431 is the best ever by
a Stanford hitter and the second
highest total in the NCAA this year.
'1 "hough the players were crest
fallen after the close loss to Nebras
ka. the Cardinal came away with
memories of yet another record-set
ting season and great achievements
by individuals and the entire team.
"I'm really proud of our team."
Barboza said after the champi
onship. "I thought we had an amaz
ing season and obviously we would
have liked to come out with a win
tonight, but I am really proud of
every single member of our team. I
thought every player stepped up. We
had a great comeback in game four.
Next season starts now for us."
