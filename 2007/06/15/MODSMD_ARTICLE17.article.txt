After trouncing No. 4 Washington to reach the title
match, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team saw
a late rally fall short as top-ranked Nebraska claimed
the four-game win and the 2006 NCAA Championship
in Omaha. Neb. on Dec. 16 [2006],
Stanford did not capture its second title in three
years, but did reach the Final Four for the 16th time in 2(i
years and the final match for the 12th â€” both NCAA
records.
But in front of a record crowd of 17.209 fans, the vast
majority pulling for Nebraska (29-5), the Cardinal (30-
4) came up short in the championship match, falling 3-1
to the top-ranked Cornhuskers.
"It was an amazing crowd tonight, an amazing tour
nament." head coach John Dunning said after the
match."This was probably the biggest match in women's
volleyball history in terms of scope."
Stanford carried the momentum of the semifinal into
the championship match, taking the first game 30-27.
The Cornhuskers, who beat a tenacious UCLA squad in
four games in the semifinals, tied the match with a 30-26
second game win buoyed by local fans. The next two
games were close, but Nebraska eked out narrow victo
ries twice, winning 30-27 and 30-28 to seal the champi
onship.
Stanford was firing on all cylinders in the first game,
offensively and defensively. The Cardinal notched 17
kills with only three hitting errors and posted seven
blocks in the first frame. After trading points, Nebraska
pulled ahead with an 8-5 lead. Stanford managed to tie
at 11 on a solo block by sophomore Foluke Akinradewo
and quickly built a four-point lead of its own. Nebraska
led as late as 24-23, but Stanford closed out the game on
a kill by senior Kristin Richards, 30-27.

Nebraska reeled off four points before Stanford
could get on the board in the second game, but the Car
dinal fought back to tie. Stanford led at 24-23, but Ne
braska put together a run to finish on top, 30-26, just as
the Cardinal had in the first game.
Sophomore opposite Erin Waller played the best
game of a career match in the third, but the Cardinal still
came up short. Waller notched two kills in the first three
points and with three consecutive kills closed a four
point deficit to just one,a 14-13 Nebraska lead. But after
a 27-27 tie.the Cornhuskers turned to AVCA Player of
the Year Sarah Pavan, a 6-foot-5 opposite, who deliv
ered the final kill in the 30-28 game.
Fighting to stay in the,match, the Cardinal gave up a
5-2 lead to Nebraska to start the fourth game, but re
gained the lead with a four-point run.The lead seesawed
back and forth until the Cornhuskers raced ahead 27-20.
The Cardinal was not ready to admit defeat, however,
scoring seven of the next nine points before Nebraska
clinched the title with a kill by Jordan Larson.
Pavan led the Cornhuskers with 22 kills and Tracy
Stalls had a team-high seven blocks. Libero Dani Bus
boom had 21 digs for Nebraska.
Waller led the Cardinal with a career-high IS kills on
.394 hitting, while four other players had double-digit
kills. Akinradewo finished with 15 kills and a match-high
eight blocks; Richards notched 14 kills to go with 12 digs:
sophomore Cynthia Barboza swatted 12 kills; and junior
Franci Girard had 10 kills and four blocks. Junior Bryn
Kehoe dished out 61 assists, served three aces and dug
14 balls, while sophomore Jessica Fishburn led with 20
digs.

the Final Four and was joined on the All-Tournament
