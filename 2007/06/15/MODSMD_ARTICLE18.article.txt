the No. 1 Stanford women's cross-coun
try team lived up to its top hilling by cap
turing its second straight national title at
the NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Ind.on N0v.20 [2006].The men's
team finished fourth, a two-place im
provement from last year's title meet.
The victory was the third NCAA
championship in four years for the
women's squad, the favorite throughout
the season that was able to brush off the
pressures of either history or expecta
tions.
"We've treated this season as it's
own, not thinking about pressure from
last year's win or our position as fa
vorites," junior Arianna Lambie said.
"So this championship is exhilarating in
its own right."

Lambie paced the women with a
fourth-place finish in the 6.000-meter
race with a time of 20 minutes, 43.8 sec
onds lasl Monday morning. Lambie's
time counted for third place in the team
standings because an individual runner
from Yale, whose team did not qualify as
a whole, finished just ahead of her.
The next Stanford runner to cross
the line was junior Teresa McWalters.

competition (31st overall) in 21:18.2.
Sophomore Lindsey Flacks followed in
45th (56th overall) in 21:43.1. Seniors
Amanda and Katv Trotter rounded out
the Cardinal's top five. Amanda
claimed 58th place (70th overall) in
21:52.0, and Katy finished in 62nd (78th
overall) in 21:55.0.
Katy Trotter's 62nd-place finish was
key for the Cardinal's posting at the top
of the team standings. Each of the top
four runners from No. 6 Colorado, the
runner-up, finished ahead of the corre
sponding runner on Stanford's roster.
However, Trotter's finish well out
stripped ('olorado's fifth runner. Hrin
Marston. who claimed 131st place.

to challenge us," Iambic said. "But

Stanford had. . .Katy [Trotter] is the
most dependable runner I know, and

Hie race was also a success lor the
men's team, which claimed fourth

major role in boosting the men's
squad to its high finish by claiming
second place in the individual stand

30:44.9. Only senior Josh Rohatinsky
of Brigham Young beat Araia to the
