# Men make NCAAs on youth talent
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
A young Stanford men's basketball sqUad exceeded its relatively
low expectations for the 2006-07 season and looks poised for a break
out campaign next year.
This team's adventure began a year ago. Last June's graduation of
2005-06 starters Dan Grunfeld. Matt Haryasz and Chris Hernandez
put Stanford in a deep hole heading into this season. The off-season
loss of two assistant coaches only deepened that pit. Five incoming
freshmen and three sophomores had to form the nucleus of a team
that would start just one upperclassman: redshirt junior Fred Wash
ington.
Given the team's youth, the media picked the Cardinal to finish
seventh in the conference, and most did not expect an NCAA berth
for the first time in years. Yet, by the skin of its teeth, Stanford did just
that.
The squad finished with a respectable 18-13 overall record and 10-
7 Pacific-10 Conference mark, returning to the NCAA Tournament
after last year's hiatus to break an 11-year streak.
Perhaps the season's most salient moments came in January. First,
sophomore Lawrence Hill's 14-foot jumper beat the buzzer and
shocked eventual ACC regular-season co-champion Virginia. 76-75,
in Charlottesville, Va. The following weekend, Stanford came back
from being down by five late in the game to top Washington. 78-77 at
Maples. A last-second three by sophomore Anthony Goods saved the
day (and a blown nine-point lead) against Washington State, 71-68 in
overtime.
After a split with the Oregon schools, Stanford upped the ante
when Southern California and UCLA visited town. After a back in
jury sidelined him from July through November, freshman Brook
Lopez trumpeted his potential against the Trojans. Against them,
Lopez recorded the first triple-double in school records and an all
time Stanford-best 12 blocks against Southern California's touted
freshman Taj Gibson in a 65-50 Stanford rout.
Three days later, the Cardinal announced its arrival to a national
television audience when it rallied from 17 down to shock then-No. 2
(and eventual Final Four-competitor) UCLA, 75-68.
Even when the team wasn't winning at Maples, Stanford certainly
was giving fans their money's worth. The Cardinal twice defied the
odds to force overtimes with incredible shots (see Goods' 24-foot
contested three, forcing double overtime in a 90-86 loss to Gonzaga)
and equally unbelievable rallies (see overcoming a 20-point deficit in
an 85-80 overtime loss to Arizona).
But the season had its ugly moments, too.The team started with a
whimper, going down in double-digit fashion early at home to under
manned mid-majors Air Force (79-45) and Santa Clara (62-46).
Then, a high ankle sprain forced Goods to the sideline for the last
month of the regular season, and his team struggled on the road in his
absence. Playing some of the worst basketball any team in a Cardinal
uniform has played in recent memory, the young squad was swept by
the Washington schools in early February. The team played better in
its annual Los Angeles trip two weeks later, but still came up empty
handed.
Ultimately, the kicker to a 4-8 finish came in tournament play. First
up were the Pac-10 quarterfinals at Los Angeles' Staples Center,
where Goods missed two potential game-icing free throws, as USC
came from behind for an 83-79 overtime win.
A week later, in the NCAA Tournament at Kentucky, Stanford
was caught with its pants around its ankles. Louisville jumped to a 41 -
13 lead in what Johnson deemed Stanford's worst half of the year,
walking to a 78-58 victory in one of the most lopsided games of the en
tire tournament.
Still, the NCAA experience can only help this young squad, and
looking ahead to next year's roster gives even more reason for opti
mism. All five starters and virtually every critical player returns from
this year's team, with the only losses being reserve Carlton Weather

by and walk-on Chris Bobel.
Meanwhile, 6-foot-8, 210-pound, three-star power forward Josh
Owens arrives on the Farm from Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire
while sharp-shooting San Francisco transfer Drew Shiller becomes
eligible for play. Most importantly. Brook and Robin Lopez have
shown the physical ability to dominate Pac-10 play. A little polish over
the summer could drastically improve their games and Stanford's
overall fate.
With so much talent on the Cardinal squad, it's hard to imagine
Stanford not notching 10 wins in the conference, making a prolonged
appearance in the top 25 and picking up its first NCAA win of the
Trent Johnson era. Look for next year's team to do just that, and if it
catches a few breaks, make a serious push deep into postseason play

Freshman Robin Lopez and his brother Brook brought the Card back
to + he NCAA Tournament after a one-year hiatus. With only two sen
