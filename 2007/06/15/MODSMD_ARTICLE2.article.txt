The surprise choice of Dana Gioia "73 as
Commencement speaker on Monday had stu
dents scratching their heads and searching
Wikipedia for more information about the
poet and chairman of the National Endow
ment for the Arts. As University and student
leaders praised the Bush appointee, immedi
ate reaction from the senior class was mixed.
"The fact that a lot of us don't know who he
is," said Susan Rodriguez '07, "is not a good

sign."
A native California!! of Italian and Mexi
can descent. Gioia received bachelor's and
business degrees from Stanford before earn
ing a masters degree in Comparative Litera
ture from Harvard.
In addition to publishing three full-length
poetry collections. Gioia has contributed to
the New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Washing
ton Post and The New York Times.
In 2003, he was appointed by President
George W. Bush as chair of the National En
dowment for the Arts and.earlier this year, re
ceived unanimous confirmation from the sen
ate for his reappointment.

"Dana Gioia's life story is one of an un
yielding thirst for knowledge and relentless
dedication to the art of the written word,"
Hennessy said in a statement. "His experi
ences are a testament to the fact that educa
tion is a lifelong journey and that taking on
new challenges, while risky, can open doors to
remarkably rich existence. I believe such life
lessons are of tremendous value for those
about to embark on a new phase of life, and 1
am eager to hear his words of wisdom for our
graduating students."
Many said that in such a heated political
year, it would have been more pertinent to
bring in a figure with a background in govern

ment or foreign affairs.
"I am impressed with his credentials and
his experience," said Sasha Buscho '07. "But
given everything that's going on in the world
with the current war and the upcoming elec
tions, it would have been more effective to
have a political figure that could inspire us
about the present issues."
Mike Lazar '07 expressed disbelief that
Stanford could not exercise its apparent clout
to choose a more prominent Commencement
speaker.
"I'm really surprised that Stanford could
n't leverage it's reputation to find a more
prominent and well known speaker." he said.

Senior Class President Vivek Agrawal said
that while some students may not be directly
familiar with Gioia's work, the poet's back
ground in both business and art would allow
him to share a unique perspective with gradu
ating students.
"We feel that come commencement, he
will give a truly memorable speech," Agrawal
said. "He has spoken at alumni reunions be
fore and the audience found him quite person
able. He really targeted issues that people
were feeling regarding life after Stanford."
