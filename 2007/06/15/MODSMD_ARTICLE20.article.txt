# Women miss Sweet 16 in second-round upset
## Cardinal basketball fails to live up to Final Four expectations 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
At the start of the NCAATournament.it
seemed as if Stanford women's basketball
had come full circle. A No. 4 preseason
ranking and expected Final Four run were
nearly tossed aside by season slip-ups. but
Stanford pulled off a 29-5, 17-1 Pacific-10
Conference record and reclaimed the Pac
-10 Tournament title.
So with a No. 2 seed in the Fresno. Calif,
region, where its first two games would be
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal had come
around and was back on track to the Final
Four.
But the circle was never completed.
In the NCAA second round. Stanford
lost 68-61 to 10-seed Florida State.
"We're just really, really, really disap
pointed," head coach Tara VanDerveer said
after the stunning upset. "This will rank up
with all the opportunities that we've wast
ed. but I think this is a very unfortunate
wasted opportunity."
As senior center Brooke Smith put it.the
Cardinal just didn't get it done.
"We weren't playing well [in the first
half]," Smith said." 1 thought that we were
lucky to be up at halftime. We just didn't do
as well as we could have done, and we real
ly tried to improve on that, but we just did
n't get it done."
An 11-2 Seminoles run in the last 8:42
put to bed Stanford's hopes of its first Final
Four since 1997 and a chance at a fourth
straight Elite Eight appearance.
There are claims that Stanford played
"tight" on its home court — missed shots,
foul problems and more — and one only
need look back to start of the season for the
obvious amount of pressure that has fol
lowed the talented and touted team.
In the WNIT second round, Stanford lost
its high rank in a 55-52 upset loss to No. 24
Brigham Young. An 18-2 run by the
Cougars in the final 7:23 left the Cardinal
reeling as it couldn't make a shot in the
clutch.
"No one got it done," VanDerveer said in
a statement similar to the one she'd be mak
ing a little more than four months later."We
can't make the mistakes we're making and
expect to win."
The same held true as the Cardinal faced
its top competition of the season.Tennessee
(the future NCAA champion) assumed the
No. 4 ranking and had its 11th straight win
over No. 11 Stanford, 77-60. Only two days
later on the road, the Cardinal lost 74-69 to
then-No. 8 Georgia.
Stanford dropped to a 2-3 record, its low

est since the 1999-2000 season, when the
Cardinal went on to a 21-9 final and lost in
the NCAA second round to the Lady Hull
dogs.
"We played against two top-10 teams.
[and| we're disappointed in what we did,"
VanDerveer said."l think that we have very
competitive players, and [a loss) makes peo
ple even more competitive. It makes them
more determined."
That determination was needed soon
with Pac-10 competition around the corner.
Fortunately for Stanford, another good
thing come out of its November road losses:
the breakthrough of freshman forward
Jayne Appel.
Appel.a McDonald's All-American and
2006 Gatorade State Player of the Year,
came off an injured left shoulder to play in
the Nov. 13 BYU loss. But it was in the Ten
nessee game that she made her presence
known when she posted 23 points, five re
bounds and five blocks in 30 minutes of
play. She followed up with 16 points and
nine rebounds at Georgia.
More stellar performances followed, and
after twice earning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors, Appel said she felt like she
had "been able to piece it all together."
"Hopefully, for the rest of the year, it'll
be like that," she added.
And it was. As Appel stepped up for the
Cardinal, the women returned to form with
17 straight wins. The freshman proved a
force on the inside, along with Smith and
senior center Kristen Newlin. And at the
end of the season, Appel was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year and had averaged
13.2 points and 7.5 rebounds.
Another new face, freshman JJ Hones,
also found her place as the Cardinal's go-to
point guard. With sophomore Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude out on injury. 1 lones started
20 games and averaged 4.9 points, 3.9 assists
and 24.3 minutes per game until Feb. 4.
That day, Stanford watched another
point guard fall to injury. Just 39 seconds
into the game. Hones came off a three-point
attempt and tore her ACL: she was out for
the season.Tilings only went downhill from
there, though, as Stanford had its 17-game
streak broken by then-No. 21 California,72-
57.
As for the point-guard void, at first it
looked like it would be filled by junior
guard Candice Wiggins. But the Cardinal
was able to find a new star in Melanie Mur
phy; the freshman's late-season efforts led
her to average 14.6 minutes and 2.4 assists
per game as she helped get the ball inside to
Appel.
Wiggins would also encounter injury
trouble. The two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Year (a first-team AII-Pac-10 honoree this
season) had a more statistically subdued
season, averaging a team-high 16.9
points (less than last year's 21.8
points). But her presence was felt
even more all around the court, with
stellar ball-handling and team lead
ership.
It was no surprise then that Wig
gins wasn't the only one feeling the
hurt when she sprained her ankle for
a second time this season. (Wiggins
also struggled with an injured ham
string during the season.)
Stanford was able to close out the

conference season with six straight
wins, securing the Pac-10 regular
season title for the seventh straight
time. And when Wiggins did return,
in the first game of the Pac-10 Tour
nament, it was with a vengeance. In
the three games of the tourney, she
averaged 21.7 points and had two
huge defensive moves to pull out the
championship win over the Cardi
nal's top Pac-10 rival, Arizona State,
62-55.
"Candice gives everything she
can give," VanDerveer said after the
championship match. "She's the
most competitive person in the
room. She's phenomenal."
From there, the Cardinal found it
self a No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tour

nament and a No. 5 national rank.
After steamrolling Idaho State. 95-
58, Stanford's season was cut short
against Florida State.
With that, four members of the
team ended their Cardinal careers:
Smith, Newlin, Markisha Coleman
and Clare Bodensteiner. Smith and
Newlin will especially be missed in
the Cardinal's post. Smith averaged
13.9 points and 7.6 rebounds on the
season, while Newlin averaged 7.9
rebounds.
Now, Stanford must move on
without them. Although Wiggins has
only one more year left with the Car
dinal, the team's rising talent —
Appel, Hones, Murphy and Gold-
Onwude —will likely ensure future

As senior center Brooke Smith put it.the
Cardinal just didn't get it done.
"We weren't playing well [in the first
half]," Smith said." 1 thought that we were
lucky to be up at halftime. We just didn't do
as well as we could have done, and we real
ly tried to improve on that, but we just did
n't get it done."
An 11-2 Seminoles run in the last 8:42
put to bed Stanford's hopes of its first Final
Four since 1997 and a chance at a fourth
straight Elite Eight appearance.
There are claims that Stanford played
"tight" on its home court — missed shots,
foul problems and more — and one only
need look back to start of the season for the
obvious amount of pressure that has fol
lowed the talented and touted team.
In the WNIT second round, Stanford lost
its high rank in a 55-52 upset loss to No. 24
Brigham Young. An 18-2 run by the
Cougars in the final 7:23 left the Cardinal
reeling as it couldn't make a shot in the
clutch.
"No one got it done," VanDerveer said in
a statement similar to the one she'd be mak
ing a little more than four months later."We
can't make the mistakes we're making and
expect to win."
The same held true as the Cardinal faced
its top competition of the season.Tennessee
(the future NCAA champion) assumed the
No. 4 ranking and had its 11th straight win
over No. 11 Stanford, 77-60. Only two days
later on the road, the Cardinal lost 74-69 to
then-No. 8 Georgia.
Stanford dropped to a 2-3 record, its low

est since the 1999-2000 season, when the
Cardinal went on to a 21-9 final and lost in
the NCAA second round to the Lady Hull
dogs.
"We played against two top-10 teams.
[and| we're disappointed in what we did,"
VanDerveer said."l think that we have very
competitive players, and [a loss) makes peo
ple even more competitive. It makes them
more determined."
That determination was needed soon
with Pac-10 competition around the corner.
Fortunately for Stanford, another good
thing come out of its November road losses:
the breakthrough of freshman forward
Jayne Appel.
Appel.a McDonald's All-American and
2006 Gatorade State Player of the Year,
came off an injured left shoulder to play in
the Nov. 13 BYU loss. But it was in the Ten
nessee game that she made her presence
known when she posted 23 points, five re
bounds and five blocks in 30 minutes of
play. She followed up with 16 points and
nine rebounds at Georgia.
More stellar performances followed, and
after twice earning Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors, Appel said she felt like she
had "been able to piece it all together."
"Hopefully, for the rest of the year, it'll
be like that," she added.
And it was. As Appel stepped up for the
Cardinal, the women returned to form with
17 straight wins. The freshman proved a
force on the inside, along with Smith and
senior center Kristen Newlin. And at the
end of the season, Appel was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year and had averaged
13.2 points and 7.5 rebounds.
Another new face, freshman JJ Hones,
also found her place as the Cardinal's go-to
point guard. With sophomore Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude out on injury. 1 lones started
20 games and averaged 4.9 points, 3.9 assists
and 24.3 minutes per game until Feb. 4.
That day, Stanford watched another
point guard fall to injury. Just 39 seconds
into the game. Hones came off a three-point
attempt and tore her ACL: she was out for
the season.Tilings only went downhill from
there, though, as Stanford had its 17-game
streak broken by then-No. 21 California,72-
57.
As for the point-guard void, at first it
looked like it would be filled by junior
guard Candice Wiggins. But the Cardinal
was able to find a new star in Melanie Mur
phy; the freshman's late-season efforts led
her to average 14.6 minutes and 2.4 assists
per game as she helped get the ball inside to
Appel.
Wiggins would also encounter injury
trouble. The two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Year (a first-team AII-Pac-10 honoree this
season) had a more statistically subdued
season, averaging a team-high 16.9
points (less than last year's 21.8
points). But her presence was felt
even more all around the court, with
stellar ball-handling and team lead
ership.
It was no surprise then that Wig
gins wasn't the only one feeling the
hurt when she sprained her ankle for
a second time this season. (Wiggins
also struggled with an injured ham
string during the season.)
Stanford was able to close out the

conference season with six straight
wins, securing the Pac-10 regular
season title for the seventh straight
time. And when Wiggins did return,
in the first game of the Pac-10 Tour
nament, it was with a vengeance. In
the three games of the tourney, she
averaged 21.7 points and had two
huge defensive moves to pull out the
championship win over the Cardi
nal's top Pac-10 rival, Arizona State,
62-55.
"Candice gives everything she
can give," VanDerveer said after the
championship match. "She's the
most competitive person in the
room. She's phenomenal."
From there, the Cardinal found it
self a No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tour

nament and a No. 5 national rank.
After steamrolling Idaho State. 95-
58, Stanford's season was cut short
against Florida State.
With that, four members of the
team ended their Cardinal careers:
Smith, Newlin, Markisha Coleman
and Clare Bodensteiner. Smith and
Newlin will especially be missed in
the Cardinal's post. Smith averaged
13.9 points and 7.6 rebounds on the
season, while Newlin averaged 7.9
rebounds.
Now, Stanford must move on
without them. Although Wiggins has
only one more year left with the Car
dinal, the team's rising talent —
Appel, Hones, Murphy and Gold-
Onwude —will likely ensure future
At the start of the NCAATournament.it
seemed as if Stanford women's basketball
had come full circle. A No. 4 preseason
ranking and expected Final Four run were
nearly tossed aside by season slip-ups. but
Stanford pulled off a 29-5, 17-1 Pacific-10
Conference record and reclaimed the Pac
-10 Tournament title.
So with a No. 2 seed in the Fresno. Calif,
region, where its first two games would be
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal had come
around and was back on track to the Final
Four.
But the circle was never completed.
In the NCAA second round. Stanford
lost 68-61 to 10-seed Florida State.
"We're just really, really, really disap
pointed," head coach Tara VanDerveer said
after the stunning upset. "This will rank up
with all the opportunities that we've wast
ed. but I think this is a very unfortunate
wasted opportunity."
