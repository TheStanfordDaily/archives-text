# Card slides through updown year

It was a roller-coaster kind of year for Stan
ford softball in 2007.
The squad put together both seven- and 12-
game winning streaks on its way to a 35-21-1
overall record and a No. 18 final ranking. But
the Cardinal also stalled for a few weeks during
the Pacific-10 Conference season (7-13-1
record), dropping the team into the bottom
half of the standings.
And yet. Stanford recovered at the end to
finish on a high note. After losing the first game
of the NCAA Regionals to Fresno State, the
Cardinal fought back to eliminate the Bulldogs
before succumbing to LSU, 11-5, in a high-oc
tane affair the next day.
"There were a lot of highs and lows this
year." head coach John Rittman said. "It was a
year where we had some struggles in the Pac
-10, but it prepared us for a run in the postsea
son."
The Cardinal had been on a high arc head
ing into the conference season.The team came
out of its out-of-conference schedule with an
impressive 24-6 record, including tive wins in
five games at the Adidas Invitational in Miami,
Fla. Stanford even took two of three from the
Oregon schools in the first weekend of the Pac
-10 season.
Things started to unravel a little soon after,
as California took two of three from the C ardi
nal, followed by three road losses at the hands
of Arizona and Arizona State. The Cardinal
posted back-to-back wins in the conference
only once more after that opening weekend, as
the team slid from the top half of the standings
into the sixth spot, where it finished the season.
The entire conference schedule was by no
means a failure, though. The team's potential
shined through in April's three-game set
against Arizona and ASU, the top two teams in
the Pac-10.
