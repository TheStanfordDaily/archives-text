# Card slides through updown year
## 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
It was a roller-coaster kind of year for Stan
ford softball in 2007.
The squad put together both seven- and 12-
game winning streaks on its way to a 35-21-1
overall record and a No. 18 final ranking. But
the Cardinal also stalled for a few weeks during
the Pacific-10 Conference season (7-13-1
record), dropping the team into the bottom
half of the standings.
And yet. Stanford recovered at the end to
finish on a high note. After losing the first game
of the NCAA Regionals to Fresno State, the
Cardinal fought back to eliminate the Bulldogs
before succumbing to LSU, 11-5, in a high-oc
tane affair the next day.
"There were a lot of highs and lows this
year." head coach John Rittman said. "It was a
year where we had some struggles in the Pac
-10, but it prepared us for a run in the postsea
son."
The Cardinal had been on a high arc head
ing into the conference season.The team came
out of its out-of-conference schedule with an
impressive 24-6 record, including tive wins in
five games at the Adidas Invitational in Miami,
Fla. Stanford even took two of three from the
Oregon schools in the first weekend of the Pac
-10 season.
Things started to unravel a little soon after,
as California took two of three from the C ardi
nal, followed by three road losses at the hands
of Arizona and Arizona State. The Cardinal
posted back-to-back wins in the conference
only once more after that opening weekend, as
the team slid from the top half of the standings
into the sixth spot, where it finished the season.
The entire conference schedule was by no
means a failure, though. The team's potential
shined through in April's three-game set
against Arizona and ASU, the top two teams in
the Pac-10.
After dropping the weekend
opener to Arizona State. 4-1. the
('ordinal got up oft the mat to down
then-No. 4 Arizona 3-2 the next al
ternoon. Iliat victory was followed
by perhaps the gutsiest performance
of the year, as sophomore ace Missy
Penna dueled Arizona's pitcher to a
12-inning.O-O tie.
Rittman ideutilied those games
as one ol the most important points
of the year for his team.
"'llie Arizona weekend was defi
nitely a good weekend for us."
Rittman said."! like the way we bat
tled at home."
Iliat proved to be a recurring
theme for the Cardinal, as the team
battled back from a lirst-game loss at
home in the regional less than a

month later.
"After losing the first game, to
light hack and get to the regional
championship is a reflection of how
much character this team had."
Rittman said.
Iliat character was coining from
all parts of the squad this spring, es
pecially the freshmen. Rittman ac
knowledged that new players are
wild cards, hut he was enthused with
the performances and progress that
he saw this year.
"'lhere's always a lot of uncer
tainty with freshmen." Rittman said.
"Iliey have to make the transition to
college, to being away from home
and playing against tougher compe
tition. hut they did a great job of
coming in and learning and con
tributing."
Center fielder Alissa llaber and
catcher Rosey Neill led the youth
movement lor Stanford. Although
the team graduated two key contrib
utors— left fielder Jackie Rinehart

and shortstop 1 indsey Key — it will
see everyone else back next year.
1 laber led the Cardinal in the ma
jority of the offensive statistics, in
cluding batting average (.365) and
extra-base hits (21). Neill threw out
two-thirds of opposing base stealers
and called the games by midseason.
in addition to providing some pop
from the plate (seven home runs).
I laber also picked up a third team
All-America designation, becoming
only the fifth freshman All-Ameri
can in Stanford softball history.
Although there were disappoint
ing elements to the season, it did fin
ish on an upward trend. With 1 laber.
Neill. Penna and most of the starting
lineup returning next year.the stage is
set for serious progress by Stanford
softball in the upcoming seasons.
"The future," Rittman said,
"looks verv good."
