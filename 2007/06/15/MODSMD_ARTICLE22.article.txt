# Baseball struggles to finish even in rough season
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Part of Stanford's rich baseball tradition has
been its consistency. In the 13 previous seasons,
the Cardinal qualified for a NCAA Regional
every single year. I lowever. it was the 2007 team's
inconsistency in the middle of the season that lost
the Cardinal a 14th straight postseason berth.
Without an impressive late-season surge,
things could have been far worse. The Cardinal
(28-28.9-15 Pacific-10 Conference) rallied to win
nine of its last 10 and avoid the distinction of be
coming the first losing squad at Stanford since
1993.
The winning streak culminated in a road
sweep of Southern California that pulled Stan
ford out of the Pac-10 cellar.
"The memory I'm going to take away is how
we kind of overcame all the adversity we faced,"
junior reliever David Stringer said.'i heard that
this is one of the worst team records in 30 years,
and that's kind of hard to take, but toward the
end, the offense especially, really came together.
It speaks a lot to the quality of the team and the
caliber of the players that we were able to come
back to .500 from such a deficit."
In the first three weekends. Stanford started
the season with two tough series at perennial
powers Cal State-Fullerton and Texas. Coming
out of that gauntlet 5-4, the Cardinal then strung
together an eight-game win streak, improving to
9-0 at Sunken Diamond in the process.
Stanford ended its streak by becoming just the
fifth program to win 2500 games in a non-confer

ence weekend sweep of California.
"It speaks volumes to the expectations we
have as a program," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "To be consistent and have a winning tradi
tion over a number of years is quite an accom
plishment that's a credit to the people that have
played here."
After the win, Stanford went into a 30-game
slump it could not shake. The Cardinal went just
9-21 over the period, and the pitching staff —
whose season-ending 6.01 ERA is the worst in
Stanford baseball's 50 years of recorded history
— ballooned up to 7.90.
The problems were not confined to the mound
either. Stanford's 82 errors on the season led the
I'ac-10. and the team simply could not get the big
hit when it needed it most. Not surprisingly then.
Stanford lost its first six Pac-10 series of the year.
"It's unfortunate we were unable to break the
bad streak of luck we had for a month and a half
or so," junior pitcher Erik Davis said. "It's the
worst we've pitched probably ever. That's pretty
depressing, especially for me, because I didn't do
a very good job of setting tone for our younger
guys."
"The problems would vary from week to
week." Marquess added."Sometimes we'd walk a
lot of people, other times we'd give up a lot of hits
or get behind in counts. As crazy as it sounds,
when we started slowly — especially the older
guys — 1 think they were conscientious and
wanted to do well so badly that they pressed too
much and then it mushroomed for us."
