# Fourth straight NCAA title eludes women's tennis
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Continuing a Cinderella run with its third consecutive
upset. No. 12 UCLA ended No. I Stanford's season in
shocking style with a 4-2 win in the semifinal match of the
NCAA Championships on May 21. The Bruins' victory
snapped the Cardinal's own streak of three straight NCAA
titles and eight straight championship match appearances.
"They played probably their best tennis of the year."

said assistant coach Frankie Brennan. talking about UCLA
in a telephone interview from Athens, Ga."They [the Bru
ins] had nothing to lose."
UCLA stunned Stanford from the beginning by winning
the doubles point. It was only the second time this entire
season that the Cardinal lost the doubles point. And ironi
cally enough, the last time Stanford lost the doubles point
was in its 4-3 loss to Georgia Tech at the National Team In
doors on Feb. 3, breaking the Cardinal's 89-match winning
streak.

Losing the doubles point proved to be a huge pitfall fur
the Cardinal. The Bruins' momentum from their doubles
victory carried into singles play, where they saw victories
from Tracy Lin over Cardinal senior Anne Yelsey and Yas
min Schnack over junior Celia Durkin.
Down 3-2 to UCLA, the Cardinal had its last chance
with junior Whitney Deason and freshman Lindsay Bur
dette still out on the courts. Stanford needed victories from
both players to win the match.
While Burdette held the Bruins'
Elizabeth Lumpkin at match point,
Deason suffered a 6-7,6-1,6-3 loss to
Ashley Joelsen that ended the Car
dinal's season. The final score stood
at 4-2 — Burdette's impending vic
tory against Lumpkin was never
recorded.
Burdette praised the Bruins in
their victory.
"More than anything else, UCLA
played absolutely unbelievable,"
Burdette said. "They put their best
tennis on the court. They got to us."
The target that No. 1 Stanford
had on its back also played a factor
in the 4-2 loss. UCLA, having al
ready pulled off upsets over No. 5
Northwestern and No. 4 Florida, was
loose and ready to take chances,
while the Cardinal had the pressure
of winning a fourth straight national
title.
"We were a little tight," Brennan
said. "1 still feel in my heart of hearts
that if we played any team 10 times,
we'd be up on them. 1 think we have
the best team in the country, but it's
hard to do it day-in and day-out
every day."
Just a few days before, the Cardi
nal was confident after a 4-0 "pound
ing" (according to Yelsey) of Van
derbilt and 4-1 win over Miami.
Yelsey also described "a really, real
ly cool and calm mood" among the
team in Athens.
"We're having a good time; peo
ple aren't stressed out and it's a fun
atmosphere," she added.
But the Bruins' victory broke that
serenity, as UCLA move into the fol
lowing day's final, in which it lost 4-2
to the Cardinal's old foe, Georgia
Tech.
The loss was particularly hard on
seniors Theresa Logar and Yelsey,
who both played their final team col
legiate matches. The co-captain duo
only lost two games in its four-year
dual career, amassing an astonishing
record of 110-2.

Logar and Yelsey also starred at
the No. 1 and No. 2 positions for the
C ardinal this year, giving instant
credibility to Stanford's lineup. The
loss was naturally harder on the two
seniors.
By the time she was able to speak
over phone at 9:30 p.m. EST, Bur
dette said that she and most of the
team were over the loss.
"We came up short," she said.
"It's not the end of the world."
rhe Cardinal couldn't spend too
much time dwelling on the day's loss,
either. The individual champi
onships began two days later, and in
the end, Logar and Durkin survived
to the Round of 16, while Burdette
made it all the way to the NCAA
quarterfinals. The freshman also
paired with Yelsey to advance into
the doubles quarterfinals.
Despite the premature end to the
team's season, the women had plen
ty to be proud of. Battling injuries
and illness at nearly every juncture
this year, Stanford finished with an
impressive 24-2 record and was
ranked No. 1 in the country for most
of the season. The team also cap
tured a Pacific-10 Conference title,
going undefeated in conference play,
and earned the No. 1 seed for the
NCAA Championships.
"We have been through so much
adversity with injuries," Burdette
said. " rhis season was amazing re
gardless of how we finished up. We
all have that outlook now. Just be
cause we didn't win NCAAs doesn't
mean we didn't accomplish an unbe
lievable amount during the season."
Brennan also gushed over the
Cardinal women and their actions
both on and off the court, regardless
of the semifinal result.
"1 think all of Stanford Universi
ty should be so proud of how this
team represents this University,"
Brennan said. "We compete well, we
fight hard and we handle winning
well ... I couldn't be more proud of
how they handled themselves this
year. In defeat, they held their heads
high and they were graceful."

onships began two days later, and in
the end, Logar and Durkin survived
to the Round of 16, while Burdette
made it all the way to the NCAA
quarterfinals. The freshman also
paired with Yelsey to advance into
the doubles quarterfinals.
Despite the premature end to the
team's season, the women had plen
ty to be proud of. Battling injuries
and illness at nearly every juncture
this year, Stanford finished with an
impressive 24-2 record and was
ranked No. 1 in the country for most
of the season. The team also cap
tured a Pacific-10 Conference title,
going undefeated in conference play,
and earned the No. 1 seed for the
NCAA Championships.
"We have been through so much
adversity with injuries," Burdette
said. " rhis season was amazing re
gardless of how we finished up. We
all have that outlook now. Just be
cause we didn't win NCAAs doesn't
mean we didn't accomplish an unbe
lievable amount during the season."
Brennan also gushed over the
Cardinal women and their actions
both on and off the court, regardless
of the semifinal result.
"1 think all of Stanford Universi
ty should be so proud of how this
team represents this University,"
Brennan said. "We compete well, we
fight hard and we handle winning
well ... I couldn't be more proud of
how they handled themselves this
year. In defeat, they held their heads
high and they were graceful."
