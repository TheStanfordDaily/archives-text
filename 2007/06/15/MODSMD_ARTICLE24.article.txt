The Dean of Students Office and the ASSU spon
sored a town hall meeting last night to allow students
the chance to share their views about the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OSA), Old Union and Tresidder
Union.
One of the most prominent concerns of the assem
bled group of senators. Row house financial managers,
chairs of Greek organizations and student group pres
idents, centered around what they characterized as a
lack of both transparency and accountability on the
part of the OSA.
"There's a huge sense that the OSA is judge, jury,
and executioner," said Kat Kershner '08. "The same
person hears a complaint against your organization,
presses charges, decides your punishment and tracks
how that punishment is carried out. When you need an
objective voice, there is no one to go to."
ASSU senator Luukas lives '09 agreed, citing the
need for an appeals process for students unhappy with
OSA decisions. lives also criticized the "inconsistency
and capriciousness" of OSA decisions.
"It seems that, when they are faced with similar sce
narios taking place only a few weeks apart, they give
very different decisions," lives said. "1 wouldn't say

their decisions are biased because there's nothing sys
tematic [about the process], but the inconsistency
makes it extremely difficult for student groups to plan
events."
Other students disagreed with lives' assertion that
the OSA was unbiased. They contended that student
groups with a history of good management build up
more credibility with the OSA, and receive faster re
sponses to phone calls and emails which would other
wise be left unanswered for weeks.
"I feel that there's definitely institutionalized re
sentment on the part of the OSA," Kershner said. She
criticized the OSA for failing to recognize the turnover
that occurs within student groups, and for holding
grudges against groups for the mistakes of their pred
ecessors.
All of the assembled students agreed that the lack
of transparency within the OSA encouraged obfusca
tion on the part of the student groups and Greek or
ganizations attempting to navigate the OS As bureau
cracy.
One student who identified himself as "a member
of a Row house who's had a lot of trouble with the
OSA this year" was candid in his assessment of the
OSA.
"The whole thing reeks of legalese and bad faith,"
he said.
