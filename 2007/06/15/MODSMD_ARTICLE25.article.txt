BERKELEY, Calif. — When
Michael Okwo emerged from the
locker room to do post-game inter
views after Stanford's 26-17 loss to
California in the 109 th Big Game [on
Dec. 2, 2(X)6], he was wiping away
tears.
"1 don't think I have cried since 1
was six years old," the senior line
hacker said. "I really didn't think that
it would come out of me. There are a
lot of memories that come hack.
Football is such a big part of our lives
that you leave part of yourself be
hind."
Okwo and his teammates had
something to be proud of in the final
game of the season, but even their
best performance of the year wasn't
enough to retake the Axe against the
No. 21 Bears (9-3,7-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference). The Cardinal trailed by just
three points midway through the
third quarter and its two offensive
touchdowns was the most scored in
one game in Pac-10 play.
But mistakes haunted the Cardi
nal (1-11, 1-8) as they had all season.
As the defense had undoubtedly its
strongest outing of the season, Stan
ford's offense failed to capitalize on
opportunities throughout the game.
"Everyone was locked in and
ready to leave it all on the field,"
Okwo said. "That's exactly what we
came out and did. We were ready to
celebrate. At the end, we felt like we
deserved to celebrate on their field.
But we just couldn't get it done."
The biggest blow to Stanford's
chances came early in the fourth
quarter. Trailing 23-17, Okwo
stripped the ball away from Cal tail
back Marshawn Lynch at the Bears'
14-yard line. But Stanford couldn't
capitalize as the Cardinal moved the
ball just two yards before attempting
a 29-yard field goal. Sophomore
Aaron Zagory's attempt sailed wide
left and the Cardinal came away
empty-handed.
"We were unable to execute dur
ing that three-play series and missed
the field goal, as well," Stanford head
coach Walt Harris said. "When you
look back at the game, there were a
lot of really good plays by our of
fense, defense and special teams. Un
fortunately, that wasn't a really good

series for us."
Stanford got the ball back later in
the quarter, but again couldn't move
the ball. Cal kicked a field goal on
their final possession to put the game
out of reach.
While the Cardinal failed to take
advantage of a Cal turnover, the
Bears were quick to capitalize when
Stanford coughed up the ball. Late in
the second quarter, Ostrander
dropped back to hand the ball off to
freshman running back Toby Gerhart
from the Stanford 20-yard line. But
Ostrander never had a good grip on
the ball, it popped loose and Cal cor
nerback Syd'Quan Thompson
scooped it up and took it in for a
touchdown.
"I don't think anybody is totally
satisfied with our effort today," junior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander said.
"Yeah, we can see that there has been
improvement, but we had a chance.
We had a chance,so we're disappoint
ed."
The offense did have some big
moments, including a beautiful 51-

yard, one-handed touchdown recep
tion to senior receiver Evan Moore
early in the third quarter. The score
cut Cal's advantage to 20-17, but the
Cardinal could never take the lead.
The Cardinal's first trip to the end
zone came in the closing minutes of
the first half, when Ostrander found
freshman receiver Richard Sherman
on a slant route for an eight-yard
touchdown toss. Sherman beat Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Daymeion I lughes on the score.
Ostrander finished the game with
204 yards through the air to go along
with the two touchdown passes. Sher
man led the Stanford receiving corps
with 81 yards.
"I'm pretty sure that this is the
most success we've had moving the
ball down the field in a while," Os
trander said. "I thought a lot of our
guys — all of our guys — played with
a lot of heart and played really well. I
thought the line stepped up big-time,
and I'm proud of them for that."
The defensive line also played
well, limiting Lynch to only 67 yards

on the ground. Ihe Cardinal also
tagged Cal quarterback Nate Long
shore for a pair of sacks.
"We came out here and said.
"Don't give them an inch,and let's ex
ecute"' senior safety Trevor Hooper
said."l really felt in my heart that the
guys were out there doing that. I am
very proud of this football team. Very
proud of them."
But Cal found an offensive
weapon in a familiar place — with
receiver DeSean Jackson.The sopho
more recorded his fourth 100-yard
receiving game of the season with 127
yards on seven receptions.
The victory was Cal's fifth consec
utive Big Game win. The Cardinal
has not won since a 35-28 victory in
2001.
While the game concluded the
season for the Cardinal, the Bears
head to San Diego for the Holiday
Bowl. Cal will face Texas A&M Dec.
28 at Qualcomm Stadium.

California runningback Marshawn Lynch pushes off Card senior Michael Okwo in the 109 th Big Game on Dec. 2,
2006. It was a very difficult season for Stanford, with a 1 -8 record and head coach Walt Harris' firing. Next year at least
holds the promise of Harris' successor, Jim Harbaugh, and a second year in the new Stanford Stadium.
