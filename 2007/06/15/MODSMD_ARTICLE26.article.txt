Eleven students were arrested late yester
day afternoon outside of President John Hen
nessy's office after they participated in a five
hour sit-in to protest what they allege is the
University's refusal to join organizations that
would curb sweatshop labor in factories that
produce Stanford apparel.
Hie students were cited for trespassing and
taken away in plastic handcuffs after they re
fused to leave the lobby of the president's of
fice when it closed for the day. As police es
corted the protesters out of the building.

about 35 onlookers chanted in support.
"We are shocked and disappointed that the
University has chosen to do this to its stu
dents," said Bethany Woolman '09. who was
one of those arrested, "hut we are prepared to
deal with the consequences."
The protesters, including Woolman.
stormed Hennessy's office at 11:30 a.m. Al
though the office usually closes at 5 p.m., Hen
nessy's office closed at 4:15 p.m. yesterday. The
protesters were arrested and taken to the
Stanford police station at 4:30 p.m., where
they were held for 90 minutes before being re
leased around 6 p.m.
University officials questioned the timing
of the protest, which came a week before Hen
nessy had offered to meet with group leaders.

"I don't completely get why now," said Jeff
Wachtel, special assistant to the President, in
an interview with The Daily after the arrests.
"President Hennessy indicated that he want
ed to work with them and was ready to meet
with the students as soon as his schedule
opened up.
"This is an important issue, but there have
been other issues that the University is in
volved with and students may not realize that
it takes time."
Woolman confirmed that the group had
been invited to meet on May 29. but she said
the group declined the request.
"We don't need any more meetings," she
said."They have all the information they need
from us.Today we were asking for a response."

The Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition has
been trying to persuade the University to join
the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) and
its Designated Suppliers Program (DSP),
which, they say, would cut down on sweatshop
labor overseas.
Dan Shih '09, co-coordinator of the
Sweat-Free Coalition, said the end result of
the protest was not what the coalition had
envisioned, but that members felt com
pelled to take action because of what they
said was the University's reluctance to
make concessions.
"It didn't end the way we wanted it to," he
said. "We came in wanting one thing, to join
the WRC and DSP. E3ut we are not going to
give up because President Hennessy needs to

understand that it is not okay to arrest stu
dents for standing up for what they believe
in."
Although the protesters called their
demonstration an act of civil disobedience, ad
ministrators said the students' actions were in
appropriate. Wachtel said the students
brought kitty litter to the president's office
with the intent to defecate in front of Hen
nessy's receptionists.
About a week after the arrests, Hetinessy
announced in an op-ed in The Daily that the
University would join the WRC and the Fair
Labor Association (FLA) but not the DSP.
