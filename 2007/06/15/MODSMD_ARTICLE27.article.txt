Nostalgic images of students riding their bikes between the
arches of the Main Quad will now find their place alongside the
Stanford Indians in the Pantheon of forgotten Stanford tradi
tions.
Starting this fall. Stanford police will enforce a no-wheels pol
icy in the Main Quad arcades,prohibiting students from riding or
parking bicycles, skateboards and rollerblades in the covered
walkways.
Fhe new rule was added by Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (P I &S) to the pre-existing access policy for the Pedestrian
Zone, an area that covers most of the academic areas on campus
and is marked by gray on this year's campus maps.
" llie purpose of the policy is to create a safer central campus
tor pedestrians and bicyclists, preserve facilities, and minimize
the disruption ol I diversity activities through the elimination of
unnecessary vehicular traffic." said Bill I arson, supervisor of the
Pedestrian Zone Access Project.
Police statistics show that,on average, two students were hos
pitalized each week lor bicycle-related accidents last year,
though it is unclear how many of those occurred in the Main
Quad.
Fhe new ban will be advertised through signs and flyers for
the first six weeks of the quarter. After that, police will issue cita
tions to students biking in the arcades.
l"he use of skateboards and rollerblades has been illegal
throughout the Pedestrian Zone for more than 15 years, Larson
said, though police have never enforced the ban in those areas
and don't plan to start any time soon.
The University also added additional bike racks throughout
the Main Quad. When asked how they expected students to
bring their bikes to the racks if they couldn't ride them there, po
lice officers answered that students could dismount and walk the
bikes to the racks.
