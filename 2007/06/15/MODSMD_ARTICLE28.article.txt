After 15 years at Stanford, Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga is saying goodbye.
Fraga made his decision public on Mon
day saying that he and his wife will accept
positions offered by the University of
Washington (UW).They will assume their
new posts on July 1.
Hie possibility of Fraga departing had
ignited a fury of activism, as his past and
current students wrote letters to adminis
trators and alumni, signed an online peti
tion and created a Facebook in an effort to
convince the University to retain Fraga.
In a statement made public Dec. 18,
Fraga cited,among other things, UW's abil
ity to support his academic interests.
" Hie University of Washington, Seattle,
is giving us unique opportunities to build
upon our previous work," he said."lJW has
entrusted us both with the chance to help
make higher education achieve intellectu
al excellence and, at the same time, expand
access to college for all students.
"We both have devoted our lives to
these very purposes. We will work as hard
as we can to push ourselves and our new
colleagues to realize these goals that are
worthy of the faith students, families, and
the general public place in leaders of high
er education."
In addition, Fraga's new appointment
will give him the opportunity to help spear
head the University of Washington's facul
ty diversity outreach, both in retention and
recruitment of minority faculty members.
Students had lobbied the University in
recent weeks to match UW's offer in the
hopes of retaining the popular professor,
an effort that was ultimately in vain.
"1 really am speechless," said Flelen
Kim '06. "This is a great loss to Stanford
and the community."

When word leaked in December that Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga was talking to the University of Washington,
students and alumni petitioned the University to match UW's offer. Fraga will assume his post in Seattle on July 1.
