## Duke prosecutor in court, will face possible disbarment 
### AARON BEARD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RALEIGH, N.C.—More than a year after shocking
allegations emerged about Duke University's lacrosse
team, prosecutor Mike Nifong was back in court Tues
day—this time as the defendant.
The North Carolina State Bar charged the Durham
County district attorney with several violations of the
state's rules of professional conduct, all tied to his han
dling of the lacrosse case.
If convicted by a disciplinary commission hearing
the case, he could be stripped of his license to practice
law in the state.
Nifong won indictments against three lacrosse play
ers last year after a woman hired as a stripper for a team
party in March 2006 said she was raped. One of three
had graduated, but Duke suspended the other two. Crit
icism of Nifong's evidence and handling of the case in
creased through the summer. Then, when the bar filed
its initial ethics charges, Nifong turned the case over to
the state attorney general, who dropped all the charges.
"This didn t have to happen, and the horrible conse
quences were entirely foreseeable." Katherine Jean, the
bar official prosecuting Nifong, said during her 25-
minute opening statement. "The harm done to these
three young men and their families and the justice sys
tem of North Carolina is devastating."
The trial is expected to run for five days, and the
hearing commission chairman promised a quick verdict.
Reporters and observers —including the mothers of
David Evans and Collin Finnerty. two of the once
charged and now-cleared lacrosse players—packed the
state Court of Appeals courtroom where the hearing
was being held. Finnerty and the third player. Reade
Seligmann. are expected to attend the trial at some
point. Attorneys for all three players were in the court
room Tuesday.
Nifong aggressively pursued the case against the
players, at one point calling the lacrosse team "a bunch
of hooligans" in a newspaper interview.
That interview.along with several others made in the
case's early days, formed the basis of the bar's initial
complaint against Nifong. which said he made mislead
ing and inflammatory comments to the media about the
athletes.

"It took this case out of the court system and deposit
ed it into the hands of the public," testified Finnerty's at
torney. Wade Smith."! do believe the community was
inflamed because of those comments."
In his opening statement. Nifong's attorney. David
Freedman.said his client would testify that he regretted
making such statements. I le went on to recount the very
early days of the case, highlighting evidence he said led
Nifong to believe a crime had occurred."lt is not uneth
ical to pursue what someone may believe to be an un
winnable case," he said.
Jean said a Durham police investigator would testify
that Nifong pushed the case against Seligmann even
when told there was no evidence linking him to the
scene of the alleged crime. Freedman responded that
Nifong told police only that if they believed the ac
cuser's allegations against Finnerty, "then you have to
believe her on Seligmann."
"Mr. Nifong did not —did not—generate a warrant
on his own." Freedman said. "He had the investigators
go in to present their case to a grand jury.There will be
no evidence of any kind that they were instructed how
to present the case to the grand jury."
The bar has also alleged that Nifong withheld evi
dence from defense attorneys and that he lied to both to
the court and bar investigators.
In her opening, Jean detailed Nifong's meetings with
the director of a DNA laboratory he hired, at which she
said Nifong learned that none of the players' DNA
matched that material found in and on the accuser.The
bar has accused Nifong of keeping those test results
from the defense.
"TTiere is no evidence —none —of any sort of agree
ment with Mr. Nifong and anybody to exclude evi
dence." Freedman said.
Nifong asked the office of North Carolina Attorney
General Roy Cooper to take over the lacrosse prosecu
tion in January. By then, most experts and legal ob
servers had long since concluded the case could not be
won.
Cooper agreed in April and dropped all charges
against the three players. In a stunning rebuke, he said
there was no rape or attack, calling the indicted players
innocent victims of a rogue prosecutor's "tragic rush to
accuse."
