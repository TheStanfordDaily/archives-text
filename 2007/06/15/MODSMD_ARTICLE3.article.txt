## Imposter caught in Okada High school graduate Azia Kim squatted at Stanford for 8 months

Azia Kim was like any other Stanford freshman.
She graduated from one of California's most compet
itive high schools last June, moved into the dorms dur
ing New Student Orientation,talked about upcoming
tests and spent her free time with friends.
The only problem is that Azia Kim was never a
Stanford student.
Kim. an 18-year-old from Orange County who
graduated from Fullerton'sTroy I ligh School,lived in
Kimball throughout fall and winter quarter. She lived
in Okada, the Asian-American theme dorm, until
Monday night, when University staff finally caught
onto her ruse.
Friends aren 't sure of her motive for sneaking onto
campus and living a lie, but many speculate that she
felt pressure from overbearing parents to attend
Stanford — regardless of whether she was admitted.
What Kim's friends do know is that they are scared
and angry that someone slipped through the cracks
for eight months.
"Personally, I don't feel safe now that Stanford al
lowed this to happen and that they're not doing any
thing to ensure the safety of their students," said Amy
Zhou '08, Kim's roommate in Okada. "I think some
thing's definitely wrong with the system if this could
happen."

Kim declined comment for this story, unless the
newspaper agreed to withhold her name. She suggest
ed, but then declined, postponing publication one day
in exchange for speaking on the record.
Kim started her con on Sept. 18.2006, the day he
fore New Student Orientation began. She told Kim
ball roommates Jenssy Rojina '09 and Missy Penna
'09. a star softball pitcher, that she was a freshman
who was temporarily out of housing due to a techni
cal mixup. according to Zhou.
Rojina and Penna, who both declined comment,
believed Kim's story and let her sleep in their room.
Kim apparently told Rojina that she moved into Kim
ball because she disliked her assigned roommate.
Kim squatted in the 210-resident dorm — splitting
her time between her "room" and the Kimball lounge
— for the majority of fall and winter quarter.
"'I ate with this girl. I went to San Francisco with
this girl, she was like my sister' — that's what Rojina
said to me," said a friend of RojinaVShe told me that
[Kim] crashed there every night."
But come spring quarter, Kim's welcome in Kim
ball was wearing thin, so she set out to find a new
room. Okada resident Jennifer Lee 'OS told her that
Zhou's roommate was going to Japan for the quarter,
creating a vacancy in the one-room double.
"I remember she came to my room because the
door was open and she was asking if anyone wanted a
roommate." said Lee. Okada's ethnic theme associ
ate. "She seemed like a pretty typical Stanford stu
dent, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt . Not really suspect

able."
Kim moved into Okada lOS on Apr. 18. She told

student staff that Stanford Housing
had approved her transfer from
Roble because she had more friends
on East Campus. "At RA training,
this will be one of those stories that
you would never expect to happen,"
said a resident assistant who lived
with Kim. "It's kind of impressive,
how she was able to figure everything
out and trick so many people."
Still, Kim had neither a Stanford
ID nor a key, forcing her to sneak into
meals and enter her room through its
window, which overlooked the
Munger construction pit. the Wilbur
parking lot and a dumpster, three
feet off the ground. Zhou never no
ticed, as she spent nearly all her
nights in her boyfriend's room.
"She took off the screen and al
ways left one of the windows wide
open and the blinds up." Zhou said."l
just guessed she always wanted a
breezy room."
To avoid suspicion while in
Okada, Kim pretended to be a soph
omore majoring in human biology,
going as far as to buy textbooks and
study with friends for tests she would
never take. Residents of the 94-per
son dorm were none the wiser.

"She really knew her stuff, and re
ally knew the schedule," Zhou said.
"For Humßio, she would say, i have
a midterm Monday in this room,' and
1 knew that was true because my
friends are Humßio [students]."
Last Sunday, Okada RA Soo Kim
"08 triggered the beginning of the end
at the weekly staff meeting. An Otero
RA told her that Azia Kim had
claimed to live in Otero. Soo Kim was
suspicious and emailed Housing on
Monday. Only then — eight months
after Azia Kim first moved into Kim
ball — did the authorities finally re
alize what had happened.
"It's kind of crazy that it was
under our radar for so long," said Soo
Kim. "1 couldn't even imagine a
squatter situation. That was never
anything that I was conscious of."
It took Zhou even longer to find out
the truth — she said that Azia Kim
broke into her email account and
permanently deleted emails from
Housing that explained the situation.
Azia Kim pretended to move out
early Monday evening, removing
every visible object save for a light or
two.
But Zhou soon discovered that
Kim had simply hidden her clothes in
the closet. The RAs confiscated
Kim's possessions and posted a terse
notice on the door. A cab eventually
took Kim to an uncle's San Jose
house at 2 a.m.Tuesday morning.

Zhou is not taking any chances
though: She's ordered Housing to in
stall a chain on her window.
"To think that someone 1 trusted
to be a Stanford student with a key
was climbing in and out of windows
and that 1 was in the same room all
this time really freaked me out."
Zhou said.
Police are currently investigating
the situation. They could press tres
passing or theft of services charges —
Stanford Housing charges unautho
rized visitors $175 daily, bringing
Kim's eight-month liability up to
$42,(XX).
In the days following the May 24
revelation that Kim had been squat
ting on campus since September, it
became clear that the 18-year-old
had also duped local Reserve Offi
cers' Training Corps (ROTC) offi
cials into thinking she was an honor
roll Stanford student — she forged
transcripts and attended ROTC
classes to continue her ruse.
It was also revealed to The Daily
that for the last four years Elizabeth
Okazaki had attended graduate
physics seminars, used offices re
served for doctoral and post-doctoral
physics students and — for all intents
and purposes made the Varian
Phvsics Lab her home.

Originally published on May 24
Azia Kim was like any other Stanford freshman.
She graduated from one of California's most compet
itive high schools last June, moved into the dorms dur
ing New Student Orientation,talked about upcoming
tests and spent her free time with friends.
The only problem is that Azia Kim was never a
Stanford student.
Kim. an 18-year-old from Orange County who
graduated from Fullerton'sTroy I ligh School,lived in
Kimball throughout fall and winter quarter. She lived
in Okada, the Asian-American theme dorm, until
Monday night, when University staff finally caught
onto her ruse.
Friends aren 't sure of her motive for sneaking onto
campus and living a lie, but many speculate that she
felt pressure from overbearing parents to attend
Stanford — regardless of whether she was admitted.
What Kim's friends do know is that they are scared
and angry that someone slipped through the cracks
for eight months.
"Personally, I don't feel safe now that Stanford al
lowed this to happen and that they're not doing any
thing to ensure the safety of their students," said Amy
Zhou '08, Kim's roommate in Okada. "I think some
thing's definitely wrong with the system if this could
happen."

Kim declined comment for this story, unless the
newspaper agreed to withhold her name. She suggest
ed, but then declined, postponing publication one day
in exchange for speaking on the record.
Kim started her con on Sept. 18.2006, the day he
fore New Student Orientation began. She told Kim
ball roommates Jenssy Rojina '09 and Missy Penna
'09. a star softball pitcher, that she was a freshman
who was temporarily out of housing due to a techni
cal mixup. according to Zhou.
Rojina and Penna, who both declined comment,
believed Kim's story and let her sleep in their room.
Kim apparently told Rojina that she moved into Kim
ball because she disliked her assigned roommate.
Kim squatted in the 210-resident dorm — splitting
her time between her "room" and the Kimball lounge
— for the majority of fall and winter quarter.
"'I ate with this girl. I went to San Francisco with
this girl, she was like my sister' — that's what Rojina
said to me," said a friend of RojinaVShe told me that
[Kim] crashed there every night."
But come spring quarter, Kim's welcome in Kim
ball was wearing thin, so she set out to find a new
room. Okada resident Jennifer Lee 'OS told her that
Zhou's roommate was going to Japan for the quarter,
creating a vacancy in the one-room double.
"I remember she came to my room because the
door was open and she was asking if anyone wanted a
roommate." said Lee. Okada's ethnic theme associ
ate. "She seemed like a pretty typical Stanford stu
dent, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt . Not really suspect
ing anvthing. I just told her the rooms that were avail
able."
Kim moved into Okada lOS on Apr. 18. She told

student staff that Stanford Housing
had approved her transfer from
Roble because she had more friends
on East Campus. "At RA training,
this will be one of those stories that
you would never expect to happen,"
said a resident assistant who lived
with Kim. "It's kind of impressive,
how she was able to figure everything
out and trick so many people."

ID nor a key, forcing her to sneak into
