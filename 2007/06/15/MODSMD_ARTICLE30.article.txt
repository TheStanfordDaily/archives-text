## Grade scam hits local colleges 
### MICHELLE LOCKE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BERKELEY, Calif. — News that
dozens of community college stu
dents in the San Francisco Bay area
may have been hitting their check
books rather than textbooks in a
cash-for-grades scam highlighted an
academic dilemma: What to do
about cheaters?
College admissions officials say
most students are honest. Still, the
problem of shamming scholars, from
juiced-up resumes to purloined
prose, has prompted some adminis
trators to start double-checking the
veracity of student applications.
The idea of students shirking
their way through college doesn't
surprise John Barrie, who runs an
anti-plagiarism Web site called Tur
nitin.com.
"It's become easier; it's become a
lot more prevalent,"he said."lt's the
'end justifies the means' world these
days."
One of the latest cheating cases
came at Diablo Valley and Los
Medanos colleges in the Bay Area,
where officials believe dozens of stu
dents paid as much as $600 to have
their grades changed on the Contra
Costa County Community College
District's computer.
'ITie scheme was discovered in
January 2006 and may go back to
2000. officials say. Up to 60 students
may be involved and administrators
believe as many as 400 grades were
changed, some more than once.
The scam began soon after a new
management system was installed
and a student employee figured out
how to change grades and later told
others, the Contra Costa Times re
ported. Many suspected cheaters
went on to transfer to four-year col
leges. including some University of
California campuses.
Prosecutors, who are considering
whether to file charges, declined to
comment on the pending investigation.

Scott Viebranz, a chief sales offi
cer at krolls security firm — whose
Global Academic Verification divi
sion vets applications for a number
of top-ranked schools — said he
can't say empirically whether col
lege cheats are on the rise, but "my
opinion is that as the competition for
these top-rated schools has become
greater and as those positions have
become more coveted, that there
may be more of an impetus to fabri
cate," he said.
Viebranz's company mainly
serves graduate schools, and the vet
ting process routinely turns up dis
crepancies. including changing em
ployment dates to cover gaps and in
flating job titles, he said.
Undergraduate applications haven't
come under the same level of scruti
ny. although "we're hearing a lot of
discussion about how do we verify
student applications and how do we
ensure that what they're giving us is
correct," Viebranz said.
In the UC's 10-campus system,
officials use a spot-check program
that randomly selects about 10 per
cent of freshman applications —
about 7.000 last year.
Selected students are asked to
back up one claim _ for instance,
sending in a copy of a yearbook
photo showing they really were class
president. Officials also check tran
scripts sent in by high schools to see
if the claimed and actual GPAs
match.
Few applicants flunk the honesty
test, said Susan Wilbur. UC's direc
tor of undergraduate admissions.
Last year, two or three students had
their applications canceled as a re
sult of ignoring the request or being
unable to provide verification, and
another handful were weeded out in
the transcript check, she said.
"It just hasn't been our experi
ence that large numbers of students
are falsifying their applications,"
Wilbur said.
There's no one system that un

dergraduate schools arc using for
verification, although a number use
high-school-submitted transcripts as
a benchmark, said David Hawkins,
public policy director for the Nation
al Association for College Admis
sion Counseling.
In the Contra Costa case, a vet
ting program wouldn't have helped
ferret out cheaters.
Even now, officials at four-year
universities where the suspected stu
dents transferred say they won't be
able to take any steps until Contra
Costa district officials send out cor
rected transcripts.
No data are available on the
amount of cheating going on. Expe
rienced admissions officers say the
numbers may be higher with more
people applying, but the percentage
of faked applications probably has
n't changed much. Hawkins said.
"They say there was gaming of
the system 20 and 30 years ago." he
said.
At the University of Texas at
Austin, officials don't routinely dou
ble-check application data, although
they do look for red flags, such as an
essay that's streets ahead of a stu
dent's English grades, said Bruce
Walker, vice provost and director of
admissions.
"At some point you have to de
velop trust in this process." he said.
"Is there cheating going on? Yes. Is it
rampant and so much so that it is tilt
ing our freshman class in the wrong
direction? No."
According to Barrie. his Web site
regularly receives 100.000 papers to
be checked each day and 30 percent
show signs of copying. I le thinks the
issue of cheating students goes deep
er than some want to acknowledge.
"Nobody wants to be the first
person to step up and say.'You know
what? There's a problem and we're
going to do something about it.'"
Barrie said. "Nobody knows what
it's going to look like when you turn
over that rock."
