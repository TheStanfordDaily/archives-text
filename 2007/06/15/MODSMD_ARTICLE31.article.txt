## Graduate student formal carries steep price tag: $54K Production costs of student events per person Open bar, live entertainment contributed to escalating costs

This year's Graduate Student Formal prom
ises to be a one-of-a-kind event — at least in
how much it costs.
Planning for the event has been marked by
ad-hoc funding and several unexpected in
creases in costs that have rendered it one of the
most expensive student-organized dance
events at Stanford.
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) is
planning the event for the second consecutive
year. Last year, the formal cost the GSC only
$16,000. The same amount was allocated for
this year's formal.
But costs quickly started piling up well past
that number.
In late November, the event's planners
asked the GSC for an additional $10,000, saying
they needed the money for a live band. The
vote to allocate this extra funding passed unan
imously. One week later, formal planners asked
for another $ 10.0(X), this time to make sure they
had enough funds to sign contracts for the
venue and the entertainment.
"We have to know we have the money,"
GSC member and event planner Donna Win
ston. a graduate student in the School of Edu
cation, said at the time, adding that the money
would be returned to the GSC if it could be off
set by funds from the Graduate Student Pro
gramming Board (GSPB).
The GSPB contributed the funds — at the
expense of a spring mixer — but formal organ
izers are still holding onto the monev from the
GSC.
Ultimately,even the additional $20,000, plus
the original $16,000 allocated in the GSC's

budget, was not enough, forcing organizers to
raise ticket prices despite November claims
that they would not do so.
According to those organizing the formal,
the event's cost could rise to $54,000 if all the
600 available tickets sell out — as they did last
year and are expected to this year.
If all 600 tickets are sold, the formal will cost
$ l X) per person, far exceeding some of the most
expensive student dances on campus.
The Viennese Ball and the Senior Formal
not only accrue smaller event costs, but they
also attract over twice as many people, leading
to per person costs that are half that of the
graduate formal. The Sophomore Formal cost
only $10,000. despite drawing over 800 stu
dents.
About two-thirds of the total cost of the
graduate formal — approximately $35,000 —
will pay for food and drinks at the party, includ
ing a three-hour open bar. Another $10,000 is
going to pay for the entertainment, including a
live band that will perform two shows.
Event organizers say this year's formal is
costing more because of more expensive food,
an additional hour for the open bar and the live
band.
They added that the open bar and live en
tertainment make the party cost more than
similar events such as the Viennese Ball and
the undergraduate formals, which lack such
amenities.
Ilie graduate formal also stands out in an
other way. Where undergraduate formals can
usually accommodate most members of their
respective classes, the graduate formal has only
600 tickets available for a student body of over
8,000.
Most of the money for the formal comes
from the student fees paid by graduate stu
dents. Some in the GSC are concerned that the
event is paid for by the entire graduate student
population, even though relatively few can at
tend.
