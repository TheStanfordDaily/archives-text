## Fire guts former swimmer's home 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
ROSEVILLE, Calif. —
Olympic gold medalist Summer
Sanders was in town for a swim
meet that bears her name the
same day her family home in
nearby Granite Bay burned.
Sanders, 34, lives in Park City,
Utah, where her four Olympic
medals — two gold, a silver and a
bronze — are safely stored. But
she was at the Roseville Aquatics
Complex in suburban Sacramen
to for the Summer Sanders Invi
tational on Saturday when the
fire broke out.

Sanders' cell phone rang with
the news, just as the 200-meter
butterfly was about to begin.
Sanders' father, Robert Sanders,
66, is a retired dentist. His home is
on Carolinda Drive, about 20
minutes from the pool.
Her brother, Trevor Sanders,
said the fire destroyed his sister's
NCAA trophies from her years at
Stanford University, as well as her
Goodwill Games medals and her
1992 Babe Zaharias award for
amateur women athletes.
But no one, including the fam
ily cat, was injured. The cause of
the fire is under investigation.
