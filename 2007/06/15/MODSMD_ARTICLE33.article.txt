### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PALO ALTO, Calif. — Philoso
pher and Stanford University com
parative literature professor Richard
Rorty has died. He was 75.
Rorty died from pancreatic can
cer at his campus home on Friday, the
university said.
Rorty's landmark book "Philoso
phy and the Mirror of Nature"
(1979), rankled some of his peers by
arguing that there is no distinction
between objective and subjective re
alities, a theme he continued to de
velop throughout his career.
"I don't see much use for the idea
of philosophy as knowledge produc
tion," he said during a forum at Stan
ford in March 2001. "Philosophy is a
tradition of overlapping texts. It's not
a scientific discipline."
Rorty came to Stanford as a fel
low at the Humanities Center in 1996

and then joined the faculty of the
comparative literature department
in 1998. His decision to teach com
parative literature instead of philos
ophy reflected his belief that the two
were essentially the same.
He was born on Oct. 4, 1931 in
New York City. At the age of 14 he
enrolled at the University of Chica
go, earning bachelor's and master's
degrees in philosophy. He attended
Yale University from 1952 to 1956,
where he earned a PhD in philoso
phy.
The bulk of Rorty's academic ca
reer was spent at Princeton I Iniversi
ty, where he taught from 1961 until
1982, when he moved (in to the I )ni
versity of Virginia.
Friend and Johns Hopkins Uni
versity professor of philosophy,
Jerome Schneewind. said in a Stan
ford press release that Rorty "lived
in a peculiar relation to philosophy."
"He was a major figure in chal
lenging the accepted pieties of ana
lytic philosophy and the accepted
pieties of so-called continental phi
losophy," said Schneewind."Fie put a
bug in everyone's ear."
