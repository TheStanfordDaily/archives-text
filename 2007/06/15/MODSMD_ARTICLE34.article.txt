## Bedbugs infest East Florence Moore Hall

More than 20 sealed plastic bags filled with
notebooks, textbooks and linens sat outside two
quarantined East Florence Moore doubles last
night: their four occupants had been sent to live in
other dormitories around campus after University
officials discovered their rooms had been infested
by bedbugs earlier this week.
One exiled student agreed to speak with The
Daily but asked to remain anonymous, fearing that
people would mistakenly think she was conta
gious. "At first, everyone was really scared
about it,"she said."People were afraid to touch us.
When we were leaving they were like,'air hug.'"
Bedbugs are five to seven-millimeter-long in
sects that suck blood out of humans, usually at
night. They are not contagious, though they lay
eggs in clothes, making infestations transmittable

if dormmates borrow one another's apparel.
An infestation that occurred in Lagunita was
detected earlier this year, but the exiled student
said something has been amiss in East Flo since
September.
"I started getting bites two weeks ago," she
said."But the room next to mine got it from the be
ginning."
Her neighbors, finding mosquito bite-like
marks on their body, became concerned and went
to Vaden, where they were told nothing was
wrong. The problem only came to light later, when
one neighbor awoke in the middle of the night to
find bedbugs crawling up his arm.
Though the residents were medically sound,
the infestation forced them to leave their rooms
last Sunday. Because of the quarantine, they could
not take any of their belongings to their new resi
dences across campus.
"In the beginning, it was absolutely terrible, I'm
not going to lie," the East Flo resident said. "But
what made it easier to adjust to this new life was

the way Housing reacted. It felt like they under
stood what you were going through."
She said that having all of her books and notes
unavailable complicated her studies.
"It's been okay being secluded, but [the situa
tion] does affect me academically" she said. "But
my professors are really nice."
The quarantine process will end six weeks after
it began last Sunday.The rooms will be torn apart,
with the carpets ripped out, furniture removed and
walls repainted.
"We're doing the entire process that needs to
take place to make sure that the bedbugs are
gone," said Assistant Director for Housing Opera
tions Imogen Hinds. "It's a more costly operation,
but it's one we feel needs to be done in order to en
sure that the bedbugs don't return."
Despite an exhaustive effort by Stanford Hous
ing to exterminate the unwelcome pests, the bed
bugs resurfaced in FloMo in January.
