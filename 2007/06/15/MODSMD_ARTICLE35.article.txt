## Dependent health care program slashed 
### LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER

Jenny Shemwell was starting to worry. It was
December 2006, four months after her husband,
Jon, began his graduate studies at Stanford, and
Shemwell had not secured health coverage for
herself or for her young daughter Grace. With
cold and flu season underway, Shemwell consid
ered locating health insurance a top priority for
her family but found the task daunting.
A year earlier, Shemwell would have had no
trouble finding health coverage for herself and
Grace — they could have simply opted to join
Stanford's Dependent Health Care Plan. But
with the program's cancellation in September
2006. finding health insurance transformed from
a simple process into an ordeal that took nearly
half a year for the Shemwells and a few other
graduate student families.
For some of those affected, Stanford's deci
sion to cancel the plan raises questions about
whether the University has an obligation to en
sure that everyone living within its extended
community has access to health coverage.
"The University wants us all to have insur
ance but they don't feel like it's feasible or af
fordable to help us," Shemwell said. "So it's noth
ing."
In a system of increasingly expensive and
complex health coverage options, Stanford
maintains that as an employer and institution of
higher learning, it is committed to providing stu
dents with means and benefits sufficient for the

care and maintenance of their families.
"We understand the pressures and difficulties
that students have in this area," Vaden Health
Center Associate Director Amy Baldwin said in
an email toThe Daily. "Our staff in the Insurance
Office is deeply concerned and cares a great deal
about this issue."
Trumped by the high price of health care and
a renewed determination to cut costs, the Uni
versity's commitment has fallen short for as
many as 100 families.
One Ph.D. student in the social sciences, who
was granted anonymity due to the stigma at
tached to chronic health conditions, reported
medical bills totaling approximately $9,600 in
out-of-pocket medical expenses since the De
pendent Health Care Plan was cancelled. Both
her husband, who is also a student, and her son
have severe chronic health problems.
"It looks to me that Stanford is reducing its
responsibilities for student health care," she said.
"It gets more expensive every year."
Although costs were high under the Depen
dent Health Care Plan, she said, the switch to
outside health insurance carriers was worse.
"[The plan] was definitely better than having
insurance on the private market." she said. "It
was better than dealing with a company that had
no institutional relationship with me. If I disput
ed an insurance charge, having Vaden as an advo
cate was very helpful."
Education graduate student Matt Andrews,
who formerly represented students with families
on the Graduate Student Council (GSC), con
curred.
"If you have kids or if you have a pregnant

spouse, [private insurance] is pretty much not af
fordable," he said. "The other population that
was hurt is people who move to Stanford. You
talk to people who were three months without
health insurance."
Stanford students and their dependents are
offered access to both private and public health
insurance providers. Emphasis is placed on "no
cost" programs like Medi-Cal. Healthy Families
and Healthy Kids, which provide full preventa
tive care insurance to children and have no de
ductible.
But Andrews said the lack of options outside
of California's state plans might deter some from
coming to Stanford.
"The biggest problem [with the state pro
grams]," he said, "is that international students
don't qualify."
"It's really difficult to find out [about insur
ance]," said Xuehua Zhang, a fifth-year graduate
student from China studying in the School of
Earth Sciences. "The only way you find out is by
networking with other Chinese students. You
find out what the cheap options are.
"One candidate [prospective student] who
was here was really concerned about insurance
for three children."
In the near future. Baldwin promised, Vaden
will work with the GSC Health Care Task Force
to try to fix some of the problems facing students
trying to find health insurance for their families.
"We believe it is important for all students
and their families to have adequate health insur
ance," she said.
