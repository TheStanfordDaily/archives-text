## Four Years of Daily-ness in 500 Words 
### 
Four years goes by much too quickly.
Now, in 500 words or less, 1 am sup
posed to convey something moving
and insightful about my time here at Stan
ford. So 1 guess I am going to write about
my experience here at The Daily.
Since my freshman year 1 have held an
amalgam of positions on this paper —
each with its own quirks and unique per
spective. As a staff writer 1 wrote news ar
ticles and concert reviews. As a columnist 1
attempted to provide simple and prudent
advice on how to best take advantage of
technology in your day-to-day lives. Last
Spring 1 became a part-time political pun
dit — I went to DC. and tried my hat as a
Washington correspondent. Astute read
ers may even recall my failed one-week
stint as a news editor. All of these experi
ences have been personally rewarding —
if not high-paying. Hopefully they have
enlightened discourse on campus or, at the
very least, provided you with some reading
material during a boring lecture.
My favorite job at The Daily has been
serving on the editorial board — that
mighty and mysterious body that meets
regularly to draft anonymous staff editori
als on behalf of all Stanford students. For
the past 5 months I have been engaged in
passionate debates with my esteemed edi
torial colleagues.This is actually quite fun.
Should the notorious caterpillars be eradi

cated? If so. /row? What are the relative
merits of the proliferation of four latter
acronyms and abbreviations on this cam
pus? What do we think of McCain's
democracy speech on campus? What
should our foreign policy be on Iran and
why hasn't Lake Lag been filled already?
And... Gioia who''! No issue is too large or
small for debate, and no piece of campus
gossip or heresy is excluded from consider
ation.
My brief tenure on the editorial board,
however, provided me a unique insight
into why this campus is so ridiculously
cool. Members of the Stanford community
have a way of passionately taking up issues
and then carrying them through. Part of
the fun of being on the editorial board has
been commending these individuals when
they succeed. In the past year a group of
Stanford students got together and decid
ed to do something about climate change.
So they organized a world class conference

and brought in experts form around the
globe. They elicited national media atten
tion and cemented a growing consensus on
campus that Stanford needs to be world
leader in promoting sustainability and
clean energy. On the editorial board, 1 get
the preposterous honor of telling them
what an awesome job they did!
Going to Stanford is a little bit like liv
ing in a perpetual "Pinky and the Brain"
episode. Everywhere you turn, Stanford
students and professors are off doing crazy
interesting things. ITiis is a community fos
tered around individuals who go follow
their passions. That's pretty cool and I'm
proud to be a part of it.
It is even more of honor to contribute to
that community via a paper like The Daily
which is filled with witty comedic geniuses
such as Katie Taylor anil Darren Franich. 1
humbly hope I have elicited some small
fractions of the number of laughs that their
writing has produced over the years.
I'm grateful for a lot of friends and men
tors here at Stanford and 1 sure am going to
miss this place. It's been good times.
Thanks for reading!

Andrew Lcifer is leaving for Boston where
lie will learn to speak like Matt Damon and
hopefully complete a Ph.D. in Biophysics.
