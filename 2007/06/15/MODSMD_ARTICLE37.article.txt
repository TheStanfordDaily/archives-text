# Nothing Gold Can Stay,Ponyboy
## 
### 
Commencement is almost upon us,
and I thought I'd give everyone a
quick guide on what to expect.
The first graduation speech was very
frightening, because the speaker had no
graduation speeches to plagiarize. Robert
Frost quotes were not yet existent, let alone
mercilessly flogged by pimple-faced vale
dictorians, as has become the modern cus
tom.
In addition to words, occasionally the
speaker would do interpretive polka
moves. The main topic was not what the fu
ture held, but how to clean a fish. It took a
while to get better. Mendel Klinges, speak
ing at the Berlin College graduation in
1495, titled his speech: "My Lederhosen
and that Strange Rash."
This is why initially graduation numbers
were so small: Graduation speeches were
so bad that dozens of students would liter
ally self-immolate during a speaker's anec
dotes on the finer points of weather proof
ing. Thankfully, later Robert Frost came
onto the scene, and saved many a gradua
tion speaker from coming up with their
own material.
The idea of a commencement address is
to point forward while looking back at all
we have accomplished, and it is generally
considered bad form to discuss alternate
realities, strange dimensions where goat
men rule the world, and suggesting time is
not an arrow, but a swirling vortex not un
like a toilet bowl. Considering most of the

audience will be hung over, this last image
is to be avoided at all costs.
At a graduation, there are the com
mencers, who oversee the events, and the
commencees. who get commenced. If nei
ther group shows up. then there's a large
number of empty chairs and stages lying
around, and that means it's dangerously
close to becoming an a capella concert.
Controversial speakers are usually
avoided. People do not wish to be remind
ed of hard battles over dining hall food,
labor strikes on campus or the Hindenburg.
They prefer images of snow falling on
cedars, beautiful creatures in nature that
have a lifespan less than reality show stars,
and people who did not take the right path
in the fork in the road, but avoided traffic
altogether by taking the 280. You do not see
many massive failures speaking to graduat
ing seniors, telling them equally important
information on how to avoid failure: Yes, I
should not have bought drugs from the
hooker: no. arsenic doesn't 'preserve' fla
vor. In retrospect, joining the Band has only

brought me misery.
There has been controversy with our
own commencement speaker. I'm an Eng
lish major and I haven't heard of Mr. Gioia.
But I can see the choice from the adminis
tration's perspective: getting this Bush ap
pointee to speak before he, too, resigns.
Gioia is a man of integrity who will, when
faced with further scandal, bravely fall on
his pen (mightier than his sword).
Perhaps, in the far future, his name will
come in handy. Maybe at some future
gallery opening (the kind where everyone
eats bits of congealed whale on tooth
picks). some turtleneck-wearing fop will
mention that he's read Gioia. Then 1 will
say," Yes. Dmitri.doesn't he have a soft/girl
ish/troll-like voice? I assume that you. too,
have heard him." Dmitri, that emotional
hemophiliac, will be humiliated.
Finally. I'd like to leave you with my
thoughts that my father gave me:"'Nothing
gold can stay,' eh? That's baloney. Investing
in gold is just good business. And expensive
cars aren't bad either. Oh. and the real es
tate market is great right n0w...1 have no
idea why I spent all this money on you."

('/iris would like to thank the LSJUMB, VIS,
SSC, KO, DB, BL, OPs, mid any other
acronyms he may have forgotten that has
helped him along the way. After five years
writing this drivel, yon meet a lot of amazing
and kind people. Send complaints to
