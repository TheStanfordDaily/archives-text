# It's OK, He's Just a College Student
## 
### 
I still remember the morning February
7th, 2007 like it was yesterday. After
tossing and turning all night. I jumped
out of my bed at 8 a.m. and quickly navigat
ed to the Daily Web site to find my first pub
lished column. I scrolled down the page
with pride, still in disbelief that 1 was actual
ly a columnist. As some of you may know. I
still type with only two fingers.Through out
my years at Stanford I would never dream
of torturing myself by typing as an extracur
ricular activity However, as graduation ap
proached I refused to let my handicap hold
me back. Nothing could wipe the grin off my
face as I finally read the fruits of my labor
on that February morning. That is. until I
reached the bottom of the page and read my
very first online comment: "Boring!"
i cried for a week straight.
My stint as a Daily columnist has taught
me many valuable lessons, the first of which
is that readers only take the time to write a
comment if they have something negative
to say. So to all my online commenters,
you'll be happy to know this is my last pub
lished column. To my group of loyal fans,
also known as my mom and dad. I promise
to continue writing in the form of weekly

emails.
Perhaps more importantly, this column is
also the last piece I will ever write as a col
lege student. It's a scary thought. However,
graduating is not scary because 1 am afraid
of entering "the real world." It's scary be
cause 1 still have the acne and facial hair of
13-year-old, and suddenly I am expected to
be a mature, working adult. I have become
very accustomed to using the "college stu
dent" excuse. For example:
What? Is that guy wearing red bellbot
toms and a polka-dot tie to a formal?
It's OK. he's just a college student.
Is that guy writing an inaccurate column
about life as a stay-at-home-dad?
It's OK. he's just a college student.

After graduation 1 don't expect my
lifestyle to change very much. I'm still going
to eat cold pizza for breakfast and buy my
formal wear at Savers. Hie only difference is
I will now be considered a dead-beat twen
ty-something, not a typical college student.
Despite my unwarranted fear of gradu
ating, 1 am honored to be a member of class
of 2007. It has truly been a privilege to study
with my incredible professors and peers
over the past four years. I have no doubt
that my classmates are going to achieve
great things in the world, and I will be there
to crash their future award ceremonies.
1 want to thank Ben, Sini and the other
Daily editors for giving me a chance and
turning my nonsensical rambles into cohe
sive columns. They is good at catching my
mistakes! 1 would also like to thank my
mom, dad, Ryan and Stephanie for their un
yielding love and support. Lastly, thank you
to my friends, especially Lmily, for always
being there and letting me know that my
column is only boring to some people.

If you still iliink his column is boring, you
can email Kevin at kpadrez@stanford.edu.
