# Nobly Sat the Hippies
## 
### 
When the hippies attacked, you
could see the Hennessy admin
istration at its trademarked
worst.
There was Maureen Powers, who
once lectured me about traffic patterns
in the quad, before admitting that she
had no statistics and didn't know what
the Quad looked like. (Maureen: it's
square-y.) She was the bathroom moni
tor. She quietly read a newspaper and
refused to let the hippies use the toilet,
like some grade school teacher making a
horrific example of the class rascal. "We
are prepared to pee in our pants." one
hippie wrote on Sweat Free's live blog.
Thus does civilization fall.
And there was Nanci. Oh. Nanci.
what a time we've had. People tell me

that you think I've made this year hell
for you. Considering that you've made
the last four years hell foi me and every
one I know. I'd say we're pretty far from
even.
The police handcuffed the hippies
and took photos of them, while the audi
ence cheered and jeered. I strolled over
to Ms. Howe, who w;is looking on from

the sidelines with a bemused look on
her face. Whether it was amusement or
resignation or confusion, humanity
must ever ponder.
"Mey. are you Nanci Howe?" I said.
"Yes." She shook my hand.
1 said my name. She pulled her hand
back. Smiling, quite sincere. I congratu
lated her on another job well done. "I
didn't arrest them," she insisted. "I'm
not responsible for everything bad at
Stanford."
Let that be the career epitaph for all
our administrators: It wasn't my fault.'
No one is responsible for everything
bad at Stanford, because no one ever
tries to do anything good at Stanford.

And whose fault is that? Where
was the man who is supposed to
bring us together? Where was
our leader on this apocalyptic
day that saw 11 students carted
off in chains?
He had another appointment,
retreating into his web of bu
reaucracy like a loathsome cave
spider frightened by the coming
dawn. Because President John
Hennessy is scared cf hippies.
John, you goof, be a man! Use
logic! Explain to them that
sweatshops, morally repugnant
as they might be, are good for
local economies. Maybe that's
not true, but a lot of economists
think it is true, and they are
smarter than the hippies. Hippies
do not understand economics un
less it involves rainbows and
fairy dust.
It's not hard to make hippies
look stupid. It is almost impossi
ble to make them look noble. Hut
thev looked like rock stars when

the handcuffs went on.
In a year with at least five ap
parent suicides and two im
posters and fewer parties than
ever, a year in which the general
feeling among the seniors was
not "What a time we've had!" but
"How much worse can it get?",
the attack of the hippies was one
more miserably executed opera
tion by the Hennessy administra
tion. What an atrocious caval
cade of dunces, guilty bystanders
in the slow death of Stanford's
soul. John. Nanei. Maureen. Jeff,
Morris. Anne. Jane. Nate. Julie,
Greg: I'll give money to Stanford
only when you all finally leave
my school.
Pip pip, kids. See you at the re
union.
