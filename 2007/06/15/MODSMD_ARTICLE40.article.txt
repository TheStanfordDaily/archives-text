## Why I'm a Horrible Writer 
### 
Idid a horrible job of covering men's ten
nis for The Daily. Depending on who you
ask, you'll probably find people who
strongly agree and others who disagree. Re
gardless of what others think, I think that I
did a pretty subpar job. Because I'm one of
the biggest fans of Stanford Tennis, I'm
probably also one of the least objective writ
ers you'll ever meet, which causes a problem
when my position calls for unwavering neu
trality.
I've tried to make my articles impartial,
but it's painfully obvious that 1 bleed Cardi
nal. In the losses covered. I always try to in
clude a positive spin, and when the team
wins, my articles are just short of blowing
bells and whistles. I sympathize with the
team when it drops close 4-3 matches, and I
beam when it displays its dominance in shut
outs.
Although I may not experience firsthand
the emotions that the guys feel on the court.
1 empathize in a way that 1 can't even begin
to put into words.
I've developed as a writer in my time
here, because I love what 1 do. Former
Sports ME Jess Peters will attest to the fact
that the moment she offered me the tennis
writer position was one of my happiest at
Stanford. Seriously. I don't consider this a
job. Sure. I get the sparse paycheck, and
yeah, there are times when 1 dread writing
two or three articles a week. But if you ask
me if I consider writing a job. 1 wouldn't hes
itate for a second before shaking my head
no.
In fact. I feel so strongly tied to covering
the team that I asked one of my friends to fill
my position temporarily while I was abroad
with the promise that he'd take care of the
team while 1 was gone and return it to me
after I got back. Ironically, the team had its
most successful season in four years while 1
was in Santiago.
And please don't get me started on

what's going to happen after 1 graduate. I've
grown to he so overprotective of the team
that 1 can't imagine anybody else interview
ing my coaches and players, much less a
writer who doesn't know the difference be
tween topspin and slice. Heaven forbid the
new person make an overly critical remark
about the team.
I've gotten complaints from my editors
that my articles are too 'pro-Stanford,' hut 1
can't help it. I know how hard the guys work
and how hard it is when they lose after
they've tried their hardest and given it their
best shot. I am endlessly optimistic and
know that even after a rough season, the
team will come back stronger than ever next
year.
At the end of my Stanford career. 1 can
only say that I'm incredibly grateful to have
been a part of Stanford Tennis if even in this
capacity. Because 1 lacked the immense tal
ent to play on the varsity squad, I was in
stead given the opportunity to enjoy tennis
from another angle. And after four years
and over 100 articles, I appreciate tennis
from an entirely different perspective than
when I was simply a player.
So to Coach Gould, Coach Whit, Coach
Hodge and the players that have been a part
of the tradition that is Stanford Tennis: 1
hope that I've been able to give back to you
at least a fraction of what you've shared with
me.Thank you for giving me this opportuni
ty. You've enhanced my Stanford experience
in ways that I can't even describe.
And maybe this inability to articulate
how I feel makes me a horrible writer. Or
maybe it's my unfaltering loyalty to a team
that lost twice as many matches as it won this
year. But when it comes down to it, if that
loyalty is what makes me the worst writer
ever, I'm willing to live with that.

If you'll forever bleed Cardinal too. eon tact
