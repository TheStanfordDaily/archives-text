## SLUG: Where the hell did you come from? 
### 
I remember being so nervous when 1 en
tered Storke Publication Building for
the first time. I wasn't worried about the
article I had written, but I certainly was wor
ried that once my editor found out 1 was in
law school, he would say "thanks but no
thanks" to an old graduate student who had
no intention of becoming a journalist.
Instead, my editor. Brendan Selby, spent
over an hour teaching me the correct style
and format for a news story. He also encour
aged me to write another article for the fol
lowing week. 1 did and continued to write
for the Daily over the next three years.
During my first Daily banquet, Brendan
jokingly said that I should have won the
Dan Grunfeld Where the Hell Did You
Come From?' award. Perhaps he wasn't the
only one posing such a question.
Before coming to Stanford, I knew law
school would be my last chance to explore
my academic and extracurricular interests
without the added stress of a full-time job
and/or a family.
I wanted to interact with graduate stu
dents from across campus, so 1 became in
volved with the Graduate Student Council
and Graduate Student Programming Board.
1 believed in the importance of mentorship.
so I worked with Expanded Advising Pro
grams. I had always wanted to be a reporter
and to plan events for other students, so I
wrote for The Daily and became a communi
ty associate. I felt it was important to
fundraise for public interest law, so 1 coordi
nated Stanford Law School's annual Battle
of the Brains. I had grown up loving the en
dearing puns on the Jungle Cruise tour ride

at Disneyland,so I walked backwards telling
my own comic stories as a campus tour
guide.
I have loved my time on the Farm. As a
graduate student. 1 have been incredibly
blessed to experience Stanford as well as
Stanford Law School. Countless students,
faculty, administrators, and staff at the Uni
versity have forever changed my life for the
better. 1 leave Stanford with so many won
derful memories from dancing at the Grad
and Law Formats with my incredible fiance
to introducing tourists to Memorial Church
to making gingerbread houses with
Crothers 1 lall residents to serving tater tots
at Midnight Breakfast to hiding candy-filled
eggs at the Meyer-Buck House Easter I gg
Roll to feasting on garlic fries at dozens of
football and basketball games. 1 wouldn't
have changed a minute of it.
To those of you graduating, congratula
tions! I am truly honored to be a part of the
Class of 2007, and I look forward to getting
to know more of you at our upcoming re
unions. Carpe diem, learn to love what you
chose, and go big or go home.
To those of you staying on the Farm. I
envy you. Take advantage of as many op
portunities as possible and then give more
than expected back. Cause people to ask.
"Where the hell did you come from?" Go
Cardinal!
