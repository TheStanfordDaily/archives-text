## A
						Grand Tradition 
### 
1 picked up mint chocolate chip and
chocolate chip cookie dough ice
cream almost every Thursday for the
past year. Daily staffers prefer those fla
vors. and Thursdays always require that
final push to finish up the week. I can't
take responsibility for the weekly tradi
tion that honor belongs to Camille, our
fearless editor-in-chief for all of last year
but contributing to the continuation of
the tradition reminds me of the true value
of The Daily.
1 didn't show up at Stanford itching to
be journalist, and I'm not leaving that
way either. But that didn't keep me from
being drawn into office life from the first
afternoon I walked in to copy edit. In
fact, sophomore year was the beginning
of my time where The Daily was my home
away from home. Some would consider
my involvement a detour from my path to

"finding my calling" or "discovering my
true passion." But over the past year I
have spent several months of frantically
searching for a job or a path, and it's oc
curred to me more than once that The
Daily has been anything but a detour.
As my time in college comes to a close
I'm no closer to knowing what my future
holds, but I do have a community that has
challenged, entertained, supported and
sustained me. I know that the people
gathered in the office will change over
time, but I hope that when I do get a
chance to return for a visit. I will still find
half eaten cartons of ice cream nestled
amongst the beer bottles and week old
pizza.
