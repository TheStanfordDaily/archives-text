## What's on your iPod? From Neil Young to U2, eight Stanford playlists 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Daily asked eight administrators, faculty
members and students what they have on their
playlists.
John L. Henjiessy, President of Stanford Univer
sity

Most of what's on
my iPod are books!
Currently, Ulysses S.
Grant's memoirs is
what I am working on.
After that, Walter
Isaacson's "Benjamin
Franklin: An American
Life."
I do have some
music, but it's very
eclectic: folk (Joni

Mitchell and James Taylor), some older rock
(Neil Young and Beatles), Sinatra and swing era
jazz, and some classical music from Beethoven to
Chopin.

Lately I've been lis
tening to a lot of Fisch
erspooner — they've
got a crazy electronic
vibe going on, and the
music is great for relax
ing or studying. Ratatat
is another band I listen
to on repeat. The Lily
Allen CD has been in
pretty heavy rotation as

well, especially the track "Littlest Things." And
"Not About Love" by Fiona Apple is still one of
my favorite songs, even though her album came
out last year. She's such a strong vocalist and it's
refreshing to hear a female kicking buttocks all
over the place.

1 like a song that tells a great story and uses
tight harmony to underscore and heighten the
tension or pleasure or grief or joy told by the
lyrics. My favorite group is the Indigo Girls, who
are true masters at both the storytelling and the
harmony. Further in both genres would be Cros-

by Stills & Nash (e.g.,
"Southern Cross"). On
the pure storytelling
side alone 1 go for
artists like Roberta
Flack (e.g., "The First
Time Ever I Saw Your
Face") and John Mayer
(e.g.,"Daughters"). On
the pure harmony side,
I like the Eagles and
Simon & Garfunkel.

My weapon of choice right now is Rappin' 4-
Tay's "Don't Fight the Feelin'" album. It's local
and classic, like me. I've got Super Dave's debut
"Rain Like Thunder" on party shuffle for the
ladies. It goes down especially smoothly when
chased with a bucket of Patron, no lime. Sub
lime's "40oz" has been stuck in my head for the
past week, thanks to that adventurous night with
Miss Lupe. My favorite tracks right now are
Ratatat's "Seventeen Years,""The Message" [by]
Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, John
Mayer's new ballad "Mrazmerized" and every
thing by the lovely and talented Brodie Jenkins
['09]. But like the caning of Michael P. Fay, noth
ing explains my angst better than AC/DC's
"Thunderstruck."

I have a
large music
collection,
currently
with 14,262
tracks on my
iPod. I enjoy
music of
many genres,
and so right
now you

could find much of the Great American Song
book standards (sung by Frank Sinatra, Ella
Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nat King Cole, Sarah
Vaughn. Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney,
Nancy Wilson, plus more modern interpreters
such as Tiemey Sutton, Stacey Kent. Peter Cin
cottiand Michael Buble), and a huge collection of
classic jazz, by all the greats (such as Cannonball
Adderley, Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, Dave
Brubeck. Dizzy Gillespie. Duke Ellington. Louis
Armstrong, Oscar Peterson. Vince Guaraldi and
others).
My symphonic music collection includes most
of the works of many of the best-known com
posers, often with several different versions avail
able. So if Beethoven. Mozart, Handel. Haydn,

Mahler. Bach, or Tchaikovsky wrote it. 1 likely
have it. 1 also have a large collection of sacred
music in the Western tradition, mostly 12th to
16th century Latin settings.
On the more modern side, from my youth for
ward. 1 have the complete U2, Beatles, Ray
Charles, I luey Lewis and Chicago sets, to name a
few. At the risk of making my sons cringe, I will
admit to having Celine Dion, too, and the com
plete music of Madonna. From the contemporary
period, 1 am a big fan of John Mayer, Dave
Matthews Band, Bright Eyes and a whole hunch
of electronica/techno/trance (why do they bother
to name those songs?).
Lastly, 1 have many discs of music from Stan
fordfs choral and vocal groups. 1 just added a disc
from Talisman. And, of course, our version of "All
Right Now" — the one that the USC Band. uh.
copied.

Genre-wise. I think I'm most partial to Latin
music, house and hip-hop. though I'm not a music
snob, so I have guilty pleasures that lie in the
pop/top-40 range. I think I've come upon those
based on my history and my work, but I think the
biggest thing for me is the actual beats behind the
music. 111 think it's danceable,fresh and fun.then
I usually like it. So this means I don't have a fa
vorite artist but I do have favorite producers, like
Rick Rock, Just Blaze, Traxxamillion and The
Neptunes.

vorite is Kim Nalley.
