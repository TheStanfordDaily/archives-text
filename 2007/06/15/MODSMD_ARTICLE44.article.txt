# Spell check: setting the record straight
## 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Despite claims of grade inflation, there's one
area in which students might receive a failing
score: spelling. No, not the kinds of words Spell
Check catches, but words students use in their
everyday lives as Stanford students.
1 informally polled 70 students on these five
commonly misspelled names and only two were
successful in every word they tried. On average,
students' performance was a mere 33.9 percent
— imagine receiving that score on a final exam!
But who can blame them? It seems that stu
dents are confused for good reason, as mis
spellings circulate widely around campus to
send mixed messages. After looking at these
misspellings so much, even I was having doubts.
A problem set from the Humßio core last
quarter — a class that enrolled nearly 30() stu
dents— was entitled "Once Upon a Time in
Cubberly." (Yes, "Cubberly' without the extra
"e.")
In a search of the deleted items in my email
inbox (very scientific. I know), I found 45 in
stances of "Tressider" dating back to September
2006, and 107 emails that spelled the building's
name correctly — a mere 2.4:1 ratio.
And Ilie Daily isn't immune either. Search
ing ITie Daily's online archives — which date
back to 1998 — for the incorrectly spelled
"Tressider" yields 31 articles. Similarly, 35 arti
cles contain "Cubberly," 33 contain "Hen
nessey," and 12 contain "Arillaga." This is a con
siderable number, as at least four students read
each article after it is submitted, and The Daily's
style guide — though admittedly outdated —
contains each of the items in this feature except
Hennessy.
So here's the final word on these spellings.
After looking at this page, you have no excuses.
Tresiddcr: Two I)\ One S
At the center of campus.Tresidder Memorial
Union contains "almost every amenity imagina
ble in order to meet the needs of campus inhab
itants and members of the surrounding commu
nity," according to its Web site. The building
serves as a central hub and meeting area for
many students, yet why is it so hard to spell?
Only 23 of the 65 students who attempted to

spell "Tresiddcr" did so correctly, a 35.4 percent
success rate. The most popular wrong response
was "Tressider," which garnered 47.7 percent of
responses. Multiple students also spelled the
building "Tressidor (4.6 percent) and "Tresider"
(3.1 percent).
One out of lOstudentsinTresidderwhile tak
ing the test was successful in spelling the name
of the building where they were sitting, which is
named after Donald B. Tresidder '19, the presi
dent of the University from 1943 to 1948.
The Daily's style guide offers this mnemonic:
"Remember when spelling Tresidder there is
one's' for Stanford and two 'd's' for Donald."
Arrillaga: Two K's,Two L's
The Arrillaga name seems to be all over
buildings on campus. ITie Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation and the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center are both named for University
donor John Arrillaga, and the Frances C. Arril
laga Alumni Center is named for his wife.
Yet just over one-third of students (33.8 per
cent. or 23 of 68) could spell his last name cor
rectly. "Arillaga" was the most popular wrong
response,garnering almost half (42.6 percent) of
the responses. Others included "Ariaga " "Arri
gala," "Arilliaga" and even "Arrelligella."
Cubbcrley: With the E Before the Y

I know how Cubber
ley Auditorium, located
in the education build
ing. must feel. My name,
too, is commonly mis
spelled when the "e" be
tween the"I" and the
"y" is forgotten.
Cubberley was
named for the School of
Education's first dean.
Ell wood Patterson Cub
berley. His name was

the one with the lowest success rate among the
students I polled. Only 20 of the 63 students
(31.7 percent) who attempted to spell "Cubber
ley" did so correctly, with the vast majority (65.1
percent) spelling it without the extra "e."Ten of
14 students seated in Cubberley while filling out
their survey spelled it incorrectly. Many stu

dents, when told the correct spelling of the audi
torium. were in disbelief that there was an "e"
before the "y."
Hennessy: Without the E Before the Y
Dr. John L. Hennessy has been on Stanford's
faculty since 11>77l l >77 and has served as president
since 2000. but it seems students still can't man
age to spell his last name right.
One-third of students (21 of 63) spelled his
name right, a clear minority. Twenty (31.7 per
cent) wrote "Hennessey." including a final "e,"
with the rest providing versions varying the
numbers of n's. s's. and e's.
One student started writing his last name,
getting down the first few letters, but then
crossed it out and simply wrote "John H."
Mirrielees: Just Memorize It
Mirrielees.an upperclass residence where 435
students live in apartment-style housing, was
named after Stanford student and faculty mem
ber Edith Mirrielees, who graduated in 1907.
'ITiis word drew the most varied responses.
While a similar proportion of students got the
building's spelling correct (35.4 percent, or 17 of
48), almost no misspellings were repeated.
Of 31 students who spelled "Mirrielees"
wrong, there were 23 distinct responses, ranging
from "Meralies" to "Mierllies," "Mireles" to
"Mirrorlees."
One student realized my survey was a
spelling test and tried writing out "Mirrielees"
three different ways on the back of her test. (She
still spelled it wrong.)
About the Data
My data collection for this feature was in no
way the simple random sample mandated by the
AP Statistics class I took in high school, and
should not be taken as such. The sample was ad
mittedly skewed toward undergraduates (bl re
spondents reported undergraduate status, while
only seven were graduate students), students in
my classes and students I arbitrarily ran into
around campus. The small sample also should not
be taken as representative of the student popula
tion at large. I handed out surveys with questions
