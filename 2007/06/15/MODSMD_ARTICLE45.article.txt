Spiders are kinky creatures. Ger
man scientists recently discov
ered that when spiders copulate,
the male often leaves a bit of his equip
ment behind. The male spider starts
the foreplay by shaking the female's
web, but then he only has a few seconds
to mate before the much-larger female
devours him. In his haste to get it on
and still get away, the male often leaves
the tip of his sex organ lodged inside
the female's reproductive tract. His
severed member acts as a sort of
chastity belt that keeps other male's
sperm from making it inside his mate.
Makes foot fetishism look tame,
doesn't it?
Screwing in the animal kingdom is
extremely diverse and extremely
weird. In her book "Dr. Tatiana's Sex
Advice to All Creation," Olivia Judson
"91 points out that spiders are not

the only animals to plug
up their mates.
The honey
bee male
also leaves
his genitals
behind, but
he rips them
off so violent
ly that he dies
from his
wounds. The honeybee
is the exception, though,
as most animals opt for
gluing their lover shut.
rather than sacrificing
their manhood. For ex
ample, a house mouse
leaves a sperm plug so tough
that removing it means tearing the fe
male's womb. Another animal that
tries to seal his mate shut is the fox
squirrel. But the female squirrel is un
deterred— she just yanks out her
lover's sperm plug and makes a snack
of it.
Eating your man's sperm plug is far
from the weirdest thing out there.The
leopard slug, for instance, has sex while
dangling in mid-air, tethered to a tree
by a mucus rope. The slugs spend up to
an hour nestled together on a tree
branch, oozing mucus all over each
other. 1 lolding each other tightly, they
then take the plunge off the tree. Next,
the hermaphroditic animals unfurl
their phalluses from the sides of their
heads, and wrap them together to ex
change sperm. (Search "slug sex" on
You Tube for a truly amazing video.)
For a cousin of the leopard slug, this
phallus is almost three feet long —
imagine that dangling in your front
yard!
Animals can also be downright
slutty. Chastity belts like the spiders'
belie the myth of female fidelity. If fe
males were chaste, males wouldn't
need to go through the trouble of ce
menting shut their lover's reproduc
tive tracts!
Husband and wife biologists David
Barash and Judith Lipton co-authored
a book called "The Myth of

Monogamy." In surveying the animal
kingdom, the only animal they found
that was completely monogamous was
a bizarre flatworm that parasitizes fish
intestines. Males and females of the
species meet when they are young, and
their bodies actually fuse into marital
Siamese twins. So "in sickness and
health" is not really a choice.
Judson points to another animal as
a paragon of family values. Again,
virtue doesn't really play into the equa
tion. One type of mantis
shrimp lurks in
sandy

burrows and waits for fish to swim by.
I lusband and wife meet as adolescents
and build a home together out of
mucus and sand. Soft, squishy bodies
make the shrimp extremely vulnerable
should they leave the love nest. And.
since they lose the ability to make the
burrow-stabilizing mucus in adult
hood. making a new home is out of the
question. 1 fence, permanent domestic
bliss.
There are a few more documented
cases of animal monogamy. But Jud
son isn't confident these animals' vir
tuousness will stand up in court. After
all, at one point,almost all bird species
were considered to be monogamous.
Mating pairs nest together,preen each
other and cooperate to raise their
brood. An idyllic vision, until paternity
tests showed that many parents were
raising bastard chicks. Infidelity was
rife.
Just as many animals do not find
themselves held to one sexual partner,
many also do not limit themselves to
the opposite sex. Homosexuality has
been documented in over 300 species
of vertebrates. The most famous
LGBT animal is the bonobo, close
cousin to the chimpanzee. Dubbed the
