# Giant "ice cube" cools campus

### LINUS LIANG 
Buried deep beneath the Jordan
Quad Parking Lot is a tank so mas
sive that it can hold 4 million gallons
of water. Every night, tubes inside
the tank are filled with below-zero
temperature ammonia, turning the
water in the tank into a giant. 8-mil
lion-pound cube of ice.
"It's not really a big ice cube." it's
a series of 1-inch-diameter tubes,
said Robert Reid, the manager of
Stanford's Energy Service.
But how are they shaped?
"They're in rectangular blocks
that are 20 feet by 10 feet, and we
have 40 of them."
And how are they arranged?
Side by side. Reid said. And then
he admitted it.
"So from far away it could resem
ble a giant cube of ice."
This non-ice-cube contains 360
miles of the steel tubing Reid de
scribed. When these tubes are filled
with antifreeze, the water surround
ing the tubes turn into 3.5-inch diam
eter cylinders of ice.
Stanford is in the ice-making
business for one reason only: to save
$500,000 every year on energy costs.
In the summer, ice is created at night
when energy demands are low. Dur
ing the day, the stored energy is then
used to cool campus, by hooking up
to the chilled water system that runs
out to approximately 120 buildings
on campus.
The Ice Plant — an unmarked
building on the corner of Campus
and Jordan Way — is the largest fa
cility of its type west of the Mississip

pi. and one of four plants that com
prise' Stanford's Central Energy Fa
cilities. Within the walls is a crew of
approximately 30 people who con
stantly monitor and maintain the fa
cilities responsible for powering the
entire University.
Why Ice?
The technology behind the non
ice-cube and similar forms of energy
storage is not new. The tank itself
was built in 1976 to chill cold water.
But as the demand for energy in
creased. Stanford decided to spend
$22 million in I 9% to convert the fa
cility to an ice cooler. There was not
enough space to increase the size of
the tank, and ice can store almost
three times as much energy as water
in the same amount of space.
