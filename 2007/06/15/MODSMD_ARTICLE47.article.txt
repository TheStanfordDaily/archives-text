## This Is Not a News Article 
### 
I don't know if you've noticed, but while the
rest of Stanford worked productively on
homework, 1 was in The Daily's office, ig
noring my homework and writing articles.
It started out as a weekly pastime in the fall,
but by the time spring quarter began, working
at The Daily qualified as an obsession. Never
mind that 1 was a spring quarter senior with an
honors thesis to complete and three outstand
ing course requirements. I was a reporter first
and a student second.
Of course, there were upsides. Some of my
best Stanford memories are of sitting and laugh
ing in the newsroom with my coworkers, drunk
off that feeling of accomplishment that comes
every time I help to put out the paper. There
were staff parties and shared memories. More
importantly, there was the paper that was put
out every day and there were changes that came
in response to articles that 1 have written.
The news is not something that gets a lot of
respect, and reporters at least within my circle
of family and friends often get less. I've been
told that good papers are "rags" and journal
ists are "scum." According to people 1 care

about, the media has caused violence in youth
and, due to our biased coverage of politics, we
have failed to prevent the impending downfall
of modern society. But 1 am here to tell you
that even at Stanford University, the modern
belief that the news does not matter is a delu
sion.
This volume, the Daily has covered several
alleged suicides, the ASSU elections, the Azia
Kim story, the housing assignments debacle
and an incoming Stanford student who has
climbed Mt. Everest.
A good news article tells you a story about
something you otherwise would never have
considered. Sometimes it brings to light infor
mation that those in power would rather have
shoved under a rug. Sometimes it reaffirms the
terrible tragedy and the awe-inspiring might of
the human existence. For me, writing the news
is a vocation, one answer to the question of
what 1 was put on Earth to accomplish.
1 am so tired of hearing about how The
Stanford Daily isn't a very good paper. 1 am
tired of people 1 interview telling me they
can't talk in person because I will probably

misquote them. I am tired of checking my arti
cles online only to find comments posted by
anonymous critics that slam my reporting.
Comments like "Terrible reporting, pretty
much what 1 expected from the Daily, though"
are a matter of course for us.
Have some respect, Stanford. We have done
what we can do, and it was worth every Band
every hour of missed sleep.
This is not a news article. It is not unbiased;
it is not fair. In an earlier draft. 1 had a para
graph above this one. talking about the good
aspects of comments that slam my work, but I
took it out.
Rather, this is a plea. Please, Stanford, ap
preciate The Daily, if you can. Try to appreci
ate the service that its staff does for you. 1 am
leaving now and I am not coming back.The fu
ture of this paper and this community is out of
my hands.
As of now, that responsibility is yours.

Lia would actually love to hear your criticism.
