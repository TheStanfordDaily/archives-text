## Este Cuento Se a Acabado 
### 
I've never written anything about myself in
The Daily. 1 know that I would have been
an awful sports columnist, so I've stuck to
writing articles about other people for other
people. So bear with me here this final piece
is for my family and for myself.
The past four years at The Daily have flown
by, and 1 cannot believe 1 went from being
scared to enter the office as a freshman to
practically living there junior year. I decided
to take a break from writing my senior year,
but I couldn't bring myself to take a break
from The Daily so 1 stayed as a desk editor.
In the words of my Daily mentor Jess Pe
ters, " The Daily owns me." I think The Daily
has this odd way of pulling you in once you
become a part of it. I found myself defending
this paper countless times whenever some
body bashed it without really knowing how
much hard work goes into producing a college
paper.
Anyhow, I wanted to thank those who sup
ported me here, even if you never really
picked up The Daily to read it.
Thank you to my friends who know that I

love sports writing and for being interested
when I talk about it.Thank you to my Durand
drawmates and my Muwekma staff for under
standing why I was never around during din
ner or at night. Thank you to my peers, partic
ularly Jess and Calling for being amazing
sportswriters and beautiful, funny ladies.
Thank you to those (Andy) who heard me
bitch about The Daily during the small crazy
moments when I thought I hated it. Writers,
thanks for stories turned in on time whenever
I was editing because if you didn't, my head
would have exploded inside the tiny sports of
fice and people would have said. "See, 1 told
you, you should stop working there."
Thank you to F.ICs and MEs for your hard
work and friendliness, to Tim Crews in Wil
lows for being my grandpa in the world of
journalism and to everyone who wrote rec
ommendation letters as got one step closer to
my dream.
1 reached that goal last summer when I cov
ered the Dodgers for MLB.com. Now. 1 don't
really know what's next ... but that's okay.
Hopefully it will come to me while I do noth

ing this summer hut relax, enjoying the scenic
country and warm beaches of Mexico ...
(And now, I originally wrote this in Span
ish but decided to write it in English, just in
case someone other than my family is reading
this.)
Papi, thanks for reading every one of my
articles, for picking up The Daily every time
you came to visit me, even in issues in which 1
hadn't written anything, only edited.
Mami, thank you for going into Papi's
room, stealing his paper, cutting it up and sav
ing each one of my stories. You probably did
n't read all of them, but you understood how
much this meant to me.
Thank you, family, for all your support. 1
may not be graduating from human biology,
engineering or pre-law, but 1 am graduating
with a smile on my face and in my heart be
cause you always told me to pursue whatever
made me happy.
1 love you guys.
