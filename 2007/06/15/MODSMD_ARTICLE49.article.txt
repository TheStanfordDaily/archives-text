## Campus Life ProFros Profiled: Six new faces on the farm 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION OLD MAN RIVER 
Watching all those cute little ProFros last weekend
reminded me of a different, more innocent time. A
time when we actually bothered wearing high heels to
dasses. when we all seriously cared about the SAT
>cores of \ irtual strangers, when we feared there might
.ictuall) exist a mythical permanent record of every
:.rr-e we got recess detention in elementary school. In
sr.ort. Admit Weekend takes us all back to life before
„• .ce Generally, prospective freshman can be sorted
.. tew categories. Which of these did you fit into,
back in the day?
True-Blue Cardinal This spirited little filly has
j-per.i the past eighteen years dreaming of Lakeside
Dining and practicing her wacky walk; she knows all
Branner > dorm chants from the past five years and
she ac:ua;!> believes that we might win Big Game
again :n the conceivable future. The True-Blue Cardi
nal Pro Fro > .i Stanford devotee to the bone, and sent
in her earl> acceptance months ago. The only reason
she's going to Admit Weekend at all is to get a dose of
HoHoPalooza toi.de her over until MuFuUnSun and.
of course, to hecon-.e "besties 4eva!" with her RoHo,
HoHo and future RFs.

Haughty Harvardite: No force of man or God is
going to recruit this young Pro Fro to Stanford: he was
accepted to all sixteen universities he applied to. in
cluding two colleges at Oxford. You know this because
he told you within the first twenty seconds of conver
sation. Multiple times. He only applied to Stanford as
a practice application before sending off his envelopes
to all of the "real" schools back East. He spends the
entire weekend chain-smoking cloves and quoting
Ulysses, wearing a wool trench coat and wondering
when it's going to start raining. As he leaves, he shakes
your hand cordially, flicks you a custom-printed busi
ness card, and tells you to be sure to get in touch when
you decide you're ready to rumble with the real (i.e.
Bostonian) big boys.

The Party Animal: According to Facebook, this
profro's favorite movies are Animal House. Porky's
and American Pie 2. She came to The Farm to enjoy
her first real, alcoholic boy-girl party — and no stupid
"dry weekend" policy is going to stop her! The Party
Animal waltzes in to drop off her stuff on the Thurs
day of Admit Weekend; the next time you see her is
three days later. She reeks of gin and strawberry soda.
When you ask where she's been sleeping, she mutters
something incoherent about Xanadu's laundry room.
Sketch.

Scaredy McStageMom: This is the poor, cute little
high-school senior who gets dragged around all week
end by his over-eager, pro-Stanford parents. While
they take flyers and candy from every single booth at
the activities fair (including Campus Girl Scouts and
the Judo Club), he sullenly text messages his friends
back home. While his parents are forcing President
Hennessy to autograph a Nalgene, he is frantically try
ing to gnaw off an arm through the custom-made Stan
ford polo shirt his mommy dressed him in that morn
ing. His parents refuse to call him by anything but his
College Confidential admissions forum screen name.
In reality,this kid doesn't even know which colleges he
has applied to — he is just waiting patiently to go
somewhere (anvwhere!) more than 100 miles away

from home in the fall.
Typical quote: This kid's mother does all the talking
for him; it is currently unknown whether he is physi
cally able to speak.
Eager Beaver: This profro is so impressive that her
fifty-page resume is required reading for introductory
CS and MS&E classes. She maintained a 4.7 GPA,won
nationals in debate, initiated a gender studies course
at her school, single-handedly saved a family of fifteen
after Hurricane Katrina, and invented a moving,
speaking, artificial-intelligence-driven robot to play
with blind orphans whose parents died of AIDS in Bo
livia. Over the course of Admit Weekend,she started a
non-profit in East Palo Alto and learned Norwegian
She was so busy interviewing tenured faculty mem
bers during Admit Weekend that she could only sleep
two hours a night — but she managed to use that time
to donate plasma. Just looking at her makes you want
to take a nap.

Ideal Profro:This Pro Fro acknowledges that Admit
Weekend is a little dorky. but the people are cool. He
spends half of his time checking out the libraries and
potential academic tracks, and the other half grabbing
Late Nite with students and asking what Stanford life
is really like. He knows that there's no way to under
stand a university in one weekend, but he likes what he
sees and is pretty psyched for the next four years.
Typical quote: "It was nice to meet you. man. See
vou in the fall."


Typical quote:"Go Stanford!"


Typical quote: "After my interviews at Princeton,
Columbia, 1 larvard and Yale, it's so charmingly quaint
to visit your cute little farm."


Typical quote: "So, what does SAE stand for?''

Typical quote: "Would it be possible to play a varsi
ty sport, sing in an a cappella group and do a three year
co-term?"
