Men's swimming head coach Skip
Kenney intentionally removed the
times of five swimmers from the
team's media-guide record hooks,
the University confirmed yesterday,
following an investigation by The
Daily. Several of the swimmers ex
pressed in interviews their belief that
the omissions were purposeful and
vindictive â€” an effort to get back at
swimmers who left the program on
bad terms.
In an interview with The Daily
yesterday morning. Kenney denied
any bad blood with former swim
mers and maintained that the omis
sion was an honest mistake. By the
afternoon, however, the coach had
changed his tone, and the University
released a statement by Kenney in
which the coach apologized for "a se
rious mistake in judgment on [his]
part." "To exclude these
five student-athletes from our media
guide was an error, and it will be cor
rected immediately," Kenney stated.
"I apologize for my actions in this
matter."
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
told The Daily he had first spoken
with Kenney about the issue
Wednesday night.
"I think it's just a mix-up some
how," Kenney said by phone the next
morning. "I don't want to guess as to
why."
"1 don't believe they were acci
dental or a mix-up," Bowlsby later
said. "It was a very bad piece of judg
ment."
"It is a matter of maintaining the
integrity of the University's record."

he added."That's something that all
of us have responsibility for."
Bowlsby also released an official
statement yesterday, in which the
athletic director denounced the
omissions as "unacceptable" and
said the University "will immediate
ly restore our records to accurately
reflect the history of our men's swim
ming program."
"We will follow up with Coach
Kenney," he said, "and take appro
priate corrective and punitive steps
after the NCAA Championship
meet."
A careful examination of the
records shows that the missing times
were not randomly omitted. Each
swimmer whose name was missing
from the guide had his times re
moved from several different events,
meets and years.
'Hie times of Jason Plummer '92,
Rickey Eddy '06. Michael McLean
'06, Tobias Oriwol '06 and Peter
Carothers 'OK disappeared from the
2007 media guide's list of Stanford's
all-time top-15 performances. While
the times all appeared in the 2006
edition of the media guide, they were
also stricken from the top times list
on the official Stanford Athletics
Web site
(http://www.gostanford.com).
Two of McLean's times were also
omitted from the 2007 guide's Pacif
ic-10 Conference and NCAA Cham
pionship results from 2006, but re
main in athletic department press re
leases of the results from last spring.
Finally, the names of McLean and
Carothers do not appear in a graphic
featuring the 12 other Stanford
swimmers who received 2005-2006
Pac-10 All-Academic honors.despite
text on the following page that states
"14 were honored."

The Pac-10 confirmed that
McLean and Carothers continue to
hold their All-Academic records.
In terms of results, Kenney's
record is hard to dispute. Last month,
the men's swimming and diving team
took home its 26th straight Pac-10
conference title, and 19 swimmers
will represent the second-ranked
Cardinal at the NCAA Champi
onships, which start on Thursday.
Outside the pool, however, some
former swimmers discussed a string
of mistreatments, culminating, they
said, in the removal of their times
from the media guide.
Kenney has coached the Stanford
men's swimming team since 1979, a
run that has included seven NCAA
titles as well as the conference
record 26 Pac-10 championships. He
coached the United States men's
Olympic swimming team at the 1996
Atlanta games, in which American
male swimmers won 15 gold medals.
Kenney was known to hold a
grudge, and the swimmers whose
names were removed said in inter
views that they were not surprised to
find their names scratched from the
record hooks.
"This was obviously vindictive,"
said one former swimmer, who asked
to remain anonymous because he
still has ties to the University.
McLean, now an investment
banker based in San Francisco, said
he found the omission "disappoint
ing."
"The records are something you
assume only change when they get
broken." McLean said. "Stanford's
all about tradition, building off of the
past."
