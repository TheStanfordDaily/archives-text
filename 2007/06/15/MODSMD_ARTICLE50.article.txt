## The
						Liveliest of Arts 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION CRITIC 
Stanford Lively Arts recently announced
its 2007-2008 season, and several prominent
performances highlight a higher "star
power" quotient for next year.This is the first
full season led by new director Jenny Bilfield.
who was previously president of Boosey and
Hawkes, a music publisher. She has promised
to make Lively Arts programs, which has al
ways had problems attracting a critical mass
of student performance-goers, more accessi
ble to the student body. To that end, she
formed the "Lively Arts Street Team," creat
ed a new staff position specifically for student
engagement and promised more student
friendly performances and ticket prices
(some events can cost more than $50. even
for students). Because Lively Arts serves
both the Stanford audience as well as the
larger Bay Area community,balancing the in
terests of diverse audiences can be difficult.
A schedule of the 2007-2008 Lively Arts
season is now available online at http://livel
yarts.stanford.edu, although only the titles of
events are available. As a result, it is hard to
figure out the details of the events, apart from
the performers. Even with minimal details,
the upcoming season looks to be an impres
sive one. The most exciting event is the sea
son-opening performance (October 9). when
Philip Glass comes to town for a perform
ance based on "Book of Longing." a recent
book of poetry by Leonard Cohen. Glass will
be on keyboard. Cohen will be on video.
Glass is recognized as perhaps the foremost
of the "modern" or "contemporary" com
posers. I le is probably best known in popular
culture for the movie soundtracks he scores
for films like "The Fog of War," "Notes on a
Scandal" and"The Hours." but is also often
associated with Stravinsky. I le is arguably the
most well known living composer who does
not compose "Star Wars" music. It's unclear
what exactly the performance will be (spo
ken word? orchestral?), but the joint per
formance is guaranteed to be interesting.
L.A. Theatre Works arrives later in the
month, performing their much-discussed
"The Pentagon Papers." This dramatization
of a gripping period at the end of the Nixon
reign promises to be compelling, especially
because Theatre Works is known for "radio
theatre." November brings Alarm Will
Sound, an innovative classical music group
known for premiering works by modern
composers like Steve Reich.They will be per
forming "Son of Chamber Symphony," a new
work by John Adams, commissioned for
Lively Arts.

In bringing Philip Glass, Alarm Will Sound
and several performances from the Kronos
Quartet to Stanford, it seems as if Lively Arts
is emphasizing modem classical music, an in
teresting direction for Lively Arts to take.The
question of accessibility for the student popu
lation remains in question, however.
January is clearly the centerpiece month
for the 2007-2008 season.The Kronos Quar
ter will be performing "Sun Rings" with the
Stanford Chamber Chorale, in what has been
described as a "multimedia performance."
Renaissance man Spike Lee will be speaking
in Memorial Auditorium. Pianist Christo
pher O'Riley. known to many trendy indie
kids for his piano-only covers of Radiohead
songs, will be performing â€” although hope
fully his performance will not include inter
minable renditions of "Everything In Its
Right Place" and "Fake Plastic Trees." And to
top it all off. renowned jazz musician Wynton
Marsalis, will be performing with the Jazz at
Lincoln Center Orchestra at the end of the
month.
After a heady January, the program de
creases both in moxie and pace,although sev
eral notable performances remain. For afi
cionados of string quartets, no less than four
(Emerson, St. Lawrence, Turtle Island and
Julliard) are performing from February
through April. In addition, accomplished pi
anist Alex Toradze will be playing with the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra on Mar. 9, and
the day before will be performing solo. Both
performances are under a program called
"The Stravinsky Project." The versatile Elisa
Monte Dance Company performs on Apr. 14
and finally, the season caps off with the Jin
Xing Dance Company's collaborative per
formance with the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra and the Stanford Symphonic Chorus.
All in all. the season is definitely a step up
from 2006-2007'5. Philip Glass. Spike Lee.
and Wynton Marsalis' appearances at Stan
ford are much-awaited. The several innova
tively collaborative programs should be
unique and memorable performances.espe
cially the ones involving Stanford arts
groups. But Lively Arts still relies, it seems,
on string quartets and chamber music to fill
up the program, and while the prominence
of those groups is not objectionable, the
question remains of how much they interest
students.That beingsaid.it should be an ex
citing year and student attendance should
be higher than ever, especially if ticket
prices are lowered. A larger Lively Arts
presence on campus is certainly welcome,
and with such a diverse list of performances,
it seems that Bilfield's ambition is on its way
to being realized.
