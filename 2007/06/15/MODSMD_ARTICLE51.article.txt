## "Bare Witness" to the photography of Gordon Parks 
### NICOLE DEMBY INTERMISSION WITNESS 
In her book "On Photography,"
Susan Sontag writes, "there is some
thing predatory in the act of taking a
picture. To photograph people is to vi
olate them, by seeing them as they
never see themselves, by having
knowledge of them they can never
have; it turns people into objects that
can be symbolically possessed." "Bare
Witness." Cantor's new exhibit of 73
black-and-white works by recently de
ceased photographer, novelist and film
director Gordon Parks, is a reminder
that even Sontag was fallible. Many of
these outstanding photographs chroni
cle poverty and slum life in various
cities. These photographs never try to
elicit a specific emotional response
from the viewer by strong-arming him
into feeling pity. Instead, Parks used
his lens to explore exactly how his sub
jects see themselves not exclusively as
sympathy-inducing victims of impov
erishment. but as human beings with
complex psychologies that have been
shaped by their harsh realities.The ge
nius of these photographs is that they
resist portraying even their most desti
tute subjects as victims of the camera
or of their surroundings. Without sim
plifying his subjects or diminishing the
poignancy of the specific moment.
Parks captured lives shaped by the
rapidly shifting social forces of a post
war America and thus portrayed histo
ry in its most human form.
Gordon Parks is perhaps most-ac
claimed for his photography but was a
versatile artist, spawning the Blax
ploitation genre with his 1971 movie
"Shaft," publishing novels and poetry
and composing a ballet about Martin
Luther King, Jr. He was also an author
and a musician. The youngest of 15
children. Parks was born into poverty
in Fort Scott. Kan. in 1912. He began
his photography career as a woman's
portrait photographer, then started to
photograph Chicago's poor and Black
South Side. These photographs landed
him a job with the Farm Security Ad
ministration. where he photographed
under the supervision of the head of
the FSA's Information Division. Roy

Striker. Perhaps his most recog
nizable photograph-and the first
one the viewer encounters in the
main room of the Cantor exhibit
depicts Ella Watson, a black jani
tor at the Farm Security Adminis
tration building, standing in front
of an American flag with a broom
in hand and a mop in the back
ground. The photograph is called
"American Gothic, Washington.
D.C.," titled after the famous
Grant Wood painting of the same
name. I he American flag hovers
out of focus in the background, an
allegory for that which hovered
above African Americans as they
struggled against racism and other
workers as they strove to make a
living in America.
It was his relationship with
Striker that led him to work on the
Standard Oil Photography Project
in the mid '40s photographing life
in small towns and industrial cen

ters. Some photographs from the
project included in the exhibit
such as an image of a young
grease-plant worker, looking de
termined despite the nightmarish
setting of the plant-show the ten
tative hope and doubt of people
caught in the industrial thrust of
the nation. On the other hand,oth
ers show the encroachment of
mass culture into small towns. 1 he
aforementioned photographs
chronicling slum life that are the
soul of the exhibit, however, are
selections from photo essays that
Parks published in Life magazine.
In one series. Parks captures the
life of a young Brazilian boy,
Flavio da Silva, and his siblings
growing up in a squalid favela in
Rio de Janero.These beautiful and
affecting images capture the phys
ical conditions of people's impov
erished lives, yet they are intense
ly personal and psychological.
Parks engages with the subiect's
mental state at the moment his
lens captures them. In his high
contrast style, he draws the viewer
to the subject and the subject's hu
manity as something distinct from

the peeling walls, the dirty pits and
the tenements that surround
them.
These photo essays are being
displayed as high art, which speaks
to Parks' versatility as a photogra
pher. Even his most affecting pho
tographs, such as those of Flavio
tenderly feeding his younger
brother are beautifully composed
images. Struck initially by the pho
tographs from magazines that rid
ers would leave behind while
working as a waiter on a luxury
train car. Parks went on to have a
strong career as a freelance fash
ion photographer and worked for
Vogue. Regrettably, the exhibit in
cludes only one of his fashion pho
tographs.
A second, lighter room houses
Parks' portraits of famous artists
and historical figures. Again we
see his predilection for photo
graphing his subjects in dramatic
lighting, often streaming in from
one side. He captured his artist
subjects in their natural setting:
Duke Ellington playing piano,
Leonard Bernstein in Carnegie
Hall. Alberto Giacometti and

Alexander Calder surrounded by
their art. Also in the room are pho
tographs of Muhammad Ali, Mal
colm X and members of the Black
Panthers. Two photographs the
1977 photograph of prominent
Black Panther member Edridge
Cleaver and his wife Kathleen in
front of a portrait of Panthers co
founder Huey Newton, and a 1 1 >49
photograph of Ingrid Bergman in
Stramboli. dressed in white and
glancing loftily to the side while
three black-clad old women in the
background gawk at her-exempli
fy once more how good Parks'
skill at using his camera to connect
with his subject's psyche.
"Bare Witness" may not be as
accessible as the Richard Avedon
photographs downstairs, but they
are certainly just as resounding
and important. By forcing the
viewer to focus not only on the
subjects' characters but also on
their situations. Parks' photo
graphs transcend time and space
while at the same time conveying a
historical moment. The exhibit
runs from now until July 1 at Can
tor Arts Center.
