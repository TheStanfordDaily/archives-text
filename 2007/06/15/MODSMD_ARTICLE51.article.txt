## "Bare Witness" to the photography of Gordon Parks 
### NICOLE DEMBY INTERMISSION WITNESS 
In her book "On Photography,"
Susan Sontag writes, "there is some
thing predatory in the act of taking a
picture. To photograph people is to vi
olate them, by seeing them as they
never see themselves, by having
knowledge of them they can never
have; it turns people into objects that
can be symbolically possessed." "Bare
Witness." Cantor's new exhibit of 73
black-and-white works by recently de
ceased photographer, novelist and film
director Gordon Parks, is a reminder
that even Sontag was fallible. Many of
these outstanding photographs chroni
cle poverty and slum life in various
cities. These photographs never try to
elicit a specific emotional response
from the viewer by strong-arming him
into feeling pity. Instead, Parks used
his lens to explore exactly how his sub
jects see themselves not exclusively as
sympathy-inducing victims of impov
erishment. but as human beings with
complex psychologies that have been
shaped by their harsh realities.The ge
nius of these photographs is that they
resist portraying even their most desti
tute subjects as victims of the camera
or of their surroundings. Without sim
plifying his subjects or diminishing the
poignancy of the specific moment.
Parks captured lives shaped by the
rapidly shifting social forces of a post
war America and thus portrayed histo
ry in its most human form.
Gordon Parks is perhaps most-ac
claimed for his photography but was a
versatile artist, spawning the Blax
ploitation genre with his 1971 movie
"Shaft," publishing novels and poetry
and composing a ballet about Martin
Luther King, Jr. He was also an author
and a musician. The youngest of 15
children. Parks was born into poverty
in Fort Scott. Kan. in 1912. He began
his photography career as a woman's
portrait photographer, then started to
photograph Chicago's poor and Black
South Side. These photographs landed
him a job with the Farm Security Ad
ministration. where he photographed
under the supervision of the head of
the FSA's Information Division. Roy
