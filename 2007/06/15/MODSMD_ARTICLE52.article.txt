# Saving the planet (now!)
## 
### 
When mankind realizes how serious is the ecological imbal
ance of their planetary home, they must take the steps so urgent
ly needed to remedy the situation. I! men were to fail to respond
with sufficient resolution they would be guilty of surrendering the
planet to slow but inevitable destruction. What, then, the legacy to
hand on to their children? That this self-destruction should not
prevail all must act together, and make the necessary sacrifices.
This will entail a complete change in attitude to the integrity of the
planet and what are seen as the needs of men today.
It will not be easy for some to countenance the changes
needed but only by such change can the life of the planet be
assured. Already, deep inroads have been made into the essential
stock of trees on Earth. l)e-forestation has caused a growing loss
of oxygen and the rise of carbon gases. This is now at a critical
stage and requires immediate action.
The reality of global warming is now dawning on the minds
of millions, yet. despite the overwhelming evidence some still
deny that the actions of men are the cause.
We, your Elder Brothers, can say with full conviction that
the actions of men are responsible for eighty J)er cent of glob
al warming.
Maitreya*, you will find, will not be long in bringing this
urgent problem to man's attention, lie will face men with the
alternatives: the beneficial results of action now, on the one hand,
and the destruction which would ensue from doing nothing, or
too little, on the other. Thus, the decision is man's alone.
When men understand this thev will indeed rallv to the

cause. They will see that the future for their children depends on
action now, and will elicit from Maitreya and His group the nec
essary steps to take. Maitreya will advocate a simpler form of
living, one more in keeping with the reality of the planet's situa
tion. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary
there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the plan
et. This will proceed with quite unusual speed, so inspired by the
need for change will millions be. Thus will the gravest dangers
facing planet Earth be somewhat countered. This will encourage
many and boost their readiness for further changes.
Faced with the dilemma of necessary change men will come
to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing.
Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible. Only
through sharing can the bounty of Planet Earth be successfully
used. Only through sharing can this bounty be correctly husband
ed. Only thus can the Planet itself live in harmony with its environ
ment and with its inhabitants.
