## Simple Fare at the Alumni Cafe 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION CAFE GOER 
The Cafe: California Bistro
and Wine Bar, located in the Ar
rillaga Alumni Center, describes
itself as a "gathering point for
alumni, students, faculty and
staff whether for espresso in the
morning, a quick bite for lunch, a
mid-afternoon snack or a glass of
beer or wine in the evening." 1
very rarely see a restaurant de
pict itself so accurately.
The Cafe doesn't put on gour
met airs or claim the best food on
campus it serves quick, casual
food at reasonable prices, mak
ing it a solid choice for anyone. II
you're looking for something
more exciting, more exotic and
perhaps more risky, however,
this is not the place for you.
Although the Cafe has a small
array of breakfast foods, ranging
from bagels and fresh fruit to
muesli with apples and berries,
its lunch menu is by far its
strongest selection. My friend
and I were impressed with its em
phasis on fresh, seasonal and
healthy food choices I honestly
could have opted for anything on
the menu.
Like Tresidder and Olive's,
The Cafe hosts a small grab-and
go refrigerated aisle, with a vari
ety of familiar salads (Cobb. Cae
sar and spinach) and cold sand
wiches ("The Catalina." "The
Santa Barbara," etc, all found at
other campus eateries).
The Grilled Combo Plates
also looked like a well-portioned
option, including a small main
course, California rice blend, din
ner roll and fountain drink. Fi
nally, the lunch menu includes
specials like the I lot Sandwich of
the Week and Salad of the Sea
son.
My friend, a vegetarian, opted
for the grab-and-go Woodside
Egg Sandwich, though she noted
that there were plenty of appe
tizing vegetarian options to con
sider. She and I decided to split
the Napa Valley Spinach Salad,
and 1 went with the Wrap of the
Week, Chicken Tikka Masala,

and picked up a lemon bar and a
brownie at the cash register. We
were surprised to see that all of
this food came to less than twen
ty dollars much less expensive
than a comparable amount of
food in Palo Alto.
The Cafe has both inside and
outside seating, which is perfect
for the somewhat unpre
dictable weather Stanford has
been having recently. My friend
and 1 loved the Napa Valley
Salad, with its fresh spinach, ap
ples, goat cheese and raspberry
vinaigrette dressing, and found
the size perfect to split between
the two of us.The salad, though,
was the highest point of the
meal everything else was fine,
but nothing to write home
about.
My friend noted that the egg
salad was, "ehh ... kind of plain."
and I didn't recognize how my
wrap was supposed to resemble
any sort of Indian food. It was
bland, unlike any chicken tikka
masala I've ever eaten, but not
necessarily bad. Needless to say.
both entrees lacked the zest we
had anticipated.
We both enjoyed the brownie,
which would have gone wonder
fully with a milkshake or cup of
coffee (also offered at The Cafe),
but the lemon bar was far too
sweet and not lemon-y enough
(just like all of Stanford Dining's
lemon bars! Administrators, take
note).
Overall, our experience was a
pleasant one The Cafe has a
clean, friendly atmosphere with
nice seating and an appetizing
selection. It would be a wonder
ful place to take a non-adventur
ous eater, or simply to get away
from the rest of Stanford Dining
for lunch. The food is nothing
thrilling or even mildly striking,
though, and I think I really liked
the idea of the eatery more than
the eatery itself.
If I were above the legal
drinking age, I might be enticed
to go back for the wine bar and
beer on tap. Since I'm not, I don't
see myself returning to The Cafe
unless it is the most convenient
option.
