## Journeys with Joel 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION NARCISSIST 
Joel Stein '93 is a narcissist. But if I were anything
like him. I'd be obsessed with myself too. It's unlike
ly that any past Daily columnist has fashioned his
Stanford soap box into a bona fide fortress quite the
way Stein has. And if someone else has, chances are
he isn't as cute.
In the 14 years since he graduated, Joel has writ
ten for more publications than the average person
picks up in a lifetime, including Entertainment
Weekly, Time and the L.A.Times (where he current
ly writes a weekly column). If you haven't read his
stuff, you've probably seen him on TV as one of
those talking heads waxing nostalgic on VHl's "I
Love the 80s" and some of those other shows you
watch when nothing better is on.
I've always been a fan of Joel, so when I found out
he was coming to campus this week. I wrote him an
email asking for an interview. I'd like to say my
email was poised and professional, but, in retro
spect, it read more like one of those gushy fan let
ters you wrote to Jonathon Taylor Thomas in sth
grade after you stumbled on his address in Tiger-
Beat.
But unlike J IT. Joel Stein wrote back.
I'm not sure what I expected Joel to be like in per
son. Smug? Unpleasant? Only capable of speaking
in 20-second increments about why he loves the
80s?
After meeting with Joel in his hotel (it's not what
you think — he's happily married, ladies), taking
him to class and finally interviewing him in Bran
ner. where he lived his freshman and senior years
(as a Writing Tutor. Sketch.), I think I've figured out
his secret weapon: he's actually a genuinely nice
guy. Or a really good actor.
For someone who claims that quality humor
hinges upon judging people rather than listening to
them, he's surprisingly accessible. So much so that I
found myself talking to him about earwax and the
tennis lessons my mom made me go to in 4th grade.
Horrifying.
Joel is charmingly self-deprecating in the way
only someone with a healthy self-esteem (read: a
beautiful wife who shops at Anthropologic) can be.
Any straight man who drives a Mini Cooper has to
have some confidence.
Though he has a MySpace — and you wonder why
you have so many 16-year-old admirers, Joel — and
he pseudo-runs his own fan website,

f/ji'joelstein.com, he still refuses to believe that peo
ple actually want to read about him. In fact, he is
probably shaking his head in disbelief as he reads
this, horrified that we devoted so many pages to
him. See, Joel? I wasn't just pretending to work at
The Daily to spend time with you.
What surprised me most, though, is how remark
ably real Joel Stein is. When 1 took him to an Eng
lish class taught by a professor he once had, he was
nervous. I'm pretty sure he hated me for a moment
when he realized 1 was one of those kids who does
n't like to hide in the back row of class. But by the
time the class was over, he was energized, utterly
impressed by the same professor who had taught
him years prior.
Sure, Joel padded around Martha Stewart's TV
kitchen in sanitary booties when he wrote for her
show — she anally required it of all employees.

And. yes, he's toured the Playboy grotto and knows
that Hugh Hefner spends his days whittling away
the hours with his gardener and zookeeper, not hav
ing sex with women whose breasts are larger than
their heads. But he's still tickled to pieces by the
simplest things. Like the fact that I was wearing a
watch — according to him a very "20th century
thing." And that there are now so many students
here who ride skateboards and even more who are
well-dressed and (appear to be) showered. 1 get this
feeling Joel wishes he were back at Stanford just so
he could glide around campus on a skateboard in his
bright orange Nikes, so fresh and so clean.
Don't get me wrong, Joel has definitely moved up
the ranks since his heyday as a Daily columnist and
editor. But 1 get the feeling that he hasn't really
changed that much. While he's constantly getting
calls from snazzy people on his snazzy, 21st century.

multi-functioning cell phone, he still peppers his
speech with "like"sand "uh"s. And even a
"douchebag" here or there. What's more, when 1
met him for our interview, he was chatting animat
edly with his dad on the phone. For the record. I did
n't hear him call his father a douchebag.
Once again. I'd like to say that 1 remained poised
and professional during our interview(s). But I did
n't. I giggled more than a sth grader in Sex Ed.
There goes my dream of being Barbara Walters. If
1 'm lucky. I might still be able to wrangle an appear
ance as a talking head on "I love the 2000s."
At one point during our interview. Joel said:
"Don't meet your heroes and crushes.That's my ad
vice. You've projected so much on them and they
can't live up to it."
I'm still glad I met you, Joel Stein ... even if you
are going bald.

Joel Stein returns to the Stanford Daily and finally receives his long-overdue writer's check. He now writes columns for the LA Times and contributes to TIME magazine.
