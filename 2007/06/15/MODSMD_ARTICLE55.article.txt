# When your dad's more rode and roll than you are
## 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION DAD BAND EXPERT 
Your dad is loving his band. 1 think
he's going to quit his job," said my
mom. I laughed. My dad is a professor
of economics at a highly respected
university. "I'm not joking," she said.
For as long as I can remember,
we've had a drum set (rock and roll
variety, purchased circa 1960) in my
basement. Every so often, my dad
would disappear and a rhythmic
racket would waft up through the
house. A few years ago he started an
economics parody band with his co
workers for the department skit
night. So far, so nerdy.
But things got weird when he
started laying down drum tracks for a
band of three grad students.They call
themselves S Apostrophe, or, jovially,
the Plural Possessive. Apparently
they liked his drum work, because he
gradually became a full-fledged
member of the band. A real, actual
band.
All those years of practice in our
basement actually made him quite
good. It's almost as though his entire
adult life was nothing but an elabo
rate gestation in preparation for this
triumphant return to adolescence.
Suddenly the 45-year-old co-workers
waving tambourines in our basement
were replaced with indie-looking 20-
somethings with real guitars and
amps, who chatted and drank beers
while I paced around upstairs. Every
so often I had to stifle a strange urge
to scream down the stairs, "Will you
kids cut it the hell out?!"
Soon they were playing real gigs in
real venues, like the Blind Pig, which
has hosted the Smashing Pumpkins
and Nirvana, among others. About a
month ago. they released their debut
CD. I Was Born in the Dollar Store.
Recently, they were featured on
NPR's Open Mic.
They say it's a sad day when a fa
ther outlives his son. When a father

outcools his son, that's downright de
pressing. The album is ...well, it's pret
ty good. When I tell people my dad's
in a hand, I think they expect some
sort of retro rock. Maybe 70s covers,
something like that. But that's not the
sort of music S Apostrophe plays.
Or. for that matter, listens to. I
thought I was pretty cool when I dis
covered the Pixies in high school,
until I found all their CDs already
neatly filed in my dad's collection. On
their website (www.sapostrophe.
com) the band lists their influences as
Garrison Keillor, Paul McCartney,
Johnnie Walker, Frank Black and
Zack Morris. When I played the
album for my friends. Spoon and the
Shins came up.
The songs on Dollar Store range
from rockabilly hand-clapper "Yel
low Fever!" to moodier melodies like
"Whiskey & Robitussin." Ilie lyrics
display a literary bent in their self
conscious manipulation of language:
"When the pretense runs shallow /
and the shadows creep cross the
floor. /1 sit at my window and watch
the wind blow / without a metaphor."
But they also let their hair down in
non sequiturs held together by unex
pected rhymes: "We could ditch pur
gatory if we wrote our life stories
about marzipan and broken glasses
fresh-cut lawns recycled plastics car
alarms the light fantastic old red
barns and new black caskets ..."
Ultimately this album is about
missed opportunities, failed ro
mances, the way life seems to build
you up and let you down. But the up
beat melodies and skewed humor
keep it from getting bogged down in
its own ruminations.
