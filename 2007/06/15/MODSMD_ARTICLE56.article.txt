# Desert Storm: Coachella
## 
### JOSEPH BERGEN INTERMISSION DESERT STORM 
Normally my drives through the Mojave
Desert are fairly uneventful. I roll up my
windows against the super-heated air, crank
up the A/C and step on the gas. Perpetually
speeding toward a wavy water mirage on the
road's surface always just out of reach, 1
know that if my car breaks down — even if
it's on a well-traveled highway — that I'll
probably end up a bleached and desiccated
skeleton on the side of the road before the
same time the following day. But this past
Thursday, as I did last year. 1 set my course
for the heart of the desert and the Coachel
la Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Califor
nia.
This year the festival was expanded from
two days to three in order to accommodate
50% more rockin' out (and probably 50%
more sweet, sweet profit). In keeping with
the Coachella mantra "to explore the un
known. challenge your tastes, and whet your
senses," there were a plethora of musical acts
performing throughout the day and night
continuously across five stages. Some acts

you have probably heard of, some your par
ents have probably heard of and some that
pretty much no one has heard of.
This year was different than last year,
though, and it took me a while to figure out
what exactly it was. The water was still a
hefty $2, the sun still poured down boiling
heat, and the lines to get out of the parking
lots were still probably the longest lines any
one had to wait through. It came to me some
time the second day as I was throwing down
a bottle of water after a broiling Hot Chip
show: Where were all the hipsters? The scen
esters? The tragically hip that had flocked in
droves to the show last year? With their "suf
fer for fashion" and "never wear shorts" atti
tudes missing, I wasn't sure where I'd look to
for my next jagged undercut do or western
style flannel shirt.
To be fair, there were a decent number of
these kids crouched around in little knots,
more often than not sporting a Tiger Cub
Scout neckerchief. But their presence was
overwhelmingly overwhelmed (yes 1 did) by
Norms. People just like you and I. And if
anything, just a bit on the fratty side of
things with red rolled up bandanas around
the head (a la Willie Nelson) being the un-

spoken order of
the day. How bor
ing. If I wanted to
be like myself, I
would have stayed
in my two-room
double in Potter
and watched Star
Trek while eating
Ricker food. Be
lieve me, it's not as
awesome as it
sounds.
After having to
make the gut -
wrenching deci-

sion to pass up MSTRKRFT I weaseled my
way into the growing crowd for Kings of
Leon. As the set started and I continued to
navigate my way through sticky, sweaty bod
ies for better position I looked up to one of
the giant jumbotron screens flanking the
main stage and saw a rock star.There he was,
the lead singer and guitarist, with long black
hair, black jeans, and heeled snakeskin
boots. A sort of updated Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Kings of Leon played primarily
from their latest album to a re
ceptive crowd. They were cooler
than me. They were cooler than
you. They were even cooler than
your older brother (and he's
pretty cool). Who needs hipsters
when you have rock stars?
Then I thought back to the day
before when I saw the Arctic
Monkeys. They were c 001... I
mean as cool as someone still
going through puberty can be.
These guys are seriously young.
But aside from the fact that all
their songs started to blend to
gether and we couldn't under
stand a word through their thick
English accents, they managed to
conjure up quite the mosh pit.
(Mosh pit? I think that was 10
years ago, folks.) In the end
though, the popped collar of the
lead singer's polo just killed it for

me. I can't use that. I popped my
collar once my freshman year in
2001 (yes. I'm ancient) and the
night did not end we 11... we'll
leave it at that.
Still thinking back, I remem
bered Interpol's performance.
Now firstly. I'm not really a fan of
Interpol for some reason, hut en
dured being crushed and directly
in contact with no less than nine
other people while the roadies
set up the gear and the crowd
shuffled impatiently. When the
group came on. they were wear
ing black suits. While the lead
guitarist was wearing a semi-tra
ditional single-vented three-but
toned jacket, the bassist came out
wearing a maestro jacket with
tails and a vest. I lis newly musta
chioed face was somber as he
pounded out his bass line with a
cigarette perched between his
lips and the ash managing to
somehow stay on far past what
I've since calculated to be statis
tically possible. Again. I couldn't
use Interpol's fashion. I don't
wear three-buttoned suits (only

two), and I certainly don't wear
one with tails.
The Kings of Leon show had
ended. I stopped remembering,
and I again vied for better posi
tion as l'he Arcade Fire began to
set up. When Arcade rushed the
stage with 10 members in all, the
crowd went wild. Without going
into too much detail, the show
was amazing drawing on as much
old material as new from the
opening "Keep the Car Run
ning." to the closing "No Cars
Go." Hut I got kind of hung up on
the lead singer. He looked like an
Amish dude who forgot his hat.
I lip. hut not the hip I'm going for.
As I ran through thick crowds
towards the Justice set. I thought.
"Maybe rock stars aren't quite as
cool as I was thinking." And then
I remembered Hot Chip, the
group 1 saw just before I noticed
the lacking of hipsters. There
were five of them up on stage,
and if you had asked me who 1
thought they were, 1 probably
would have said I thought they
just shuffled out of their offices

at Google. I'hey were huge nerds.
Despite the heat they were all
wearing jeans, one was wearing a
comic book-styled T-shirt, and
another was wearing an unbut
toned blue Hawaiian shirt. I
looked on in disbelief as the lead
singer opened his mouth for the
first time and a voice came out
that totally didn't match him
came out. None of this mattered
though. I or 50 minutes they were
at the head of a sweaty pulsating
mass of people playing ridicu
lously good music. I'hey were
cool because they weren't cool
and they didn't care.
I didn't have much time to
dwell on this though because as I
approached the Sahara tent
where Justice was playing 1 could
feel the chunky beats emanating
from the ground upward. Almost
as good as Daft Punk was last
year... almost. But I danced more
than should have been physically
able and it was probably terribly
embarrassing. Hut I don't care.
Oh, and Rage Against the Ma
chine was there. Whatever.
