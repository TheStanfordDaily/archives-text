# Desert Storm: Coachella
## 
### JOSEPH BERGEN INTERMISSION DESERT STORM 
Normally my drives through the Mojave
Desert are fairly uneventful. I roll up my
windows against the super-heated air, crank
up the A/C and step on the gas. Perpetually
speeding toward a wavy water mirage on the
road's surface always just out of reach, 1
know that if my car breaks down — even if
it's on a well-traveled highway — that I'll
probably end up a bleached and desiccated
skeleton on the side of the road before the
same time the following day. But this past
Thursday, as I did last year. 1 set my course
for the heart of the desert and the Coachel
la Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Califor
nia.
This year the festival was expanded from
two days to three in order to accommodate
50% more rockin' out (and probably 50%
more sweet, sweet profit). In keeping with
the Coachella mantra "to explore the un
known. challenge your tastes, and whet your
senses," there were a plethora of musical acts
performing throughout the day and night
continuously across five stages. Some acts

you have probably heard of, some your par
ents have probably heard of and some that
pretty much no one has heard of.
This year was different than last year,
though, and it took me a while to figure out
what exactly it was. The water was still a
hefty $2, the sun still poured down boiling
heat, and the lines to get out of the parking
lots were still probably the longest lines any
one had to wait through. It came to me some
time the second day as I was throwing down
a bottle of water after a broiling Hot Chip
show: Where were all the hipsters? The scen
esters? The tragically hip that had flocked in
droves to the show last year? With their "suf
fer for fashion" and "never wear shorts" atti
tudes missing, I wasn't sure where I'd look to
for my next jagged undercut do or western
style flannel shirt.
To be fair, there were a decent number of
these kids crouched around in little knots,
more often than not sporting a Tiger Cub
Scout neckerchief. But their presence was
overwhelmingly overwhelmed (yes 1 did) by
Norms. People just like you and I. And if
anything, just a bit on the fratty side of
things with red rolled up bandanas around
the head (a la Willie Nelson) being the un-

spoken order of
the day. How bor
ing. If I wanted to
be like myself, I
would have stayed
in my two-room
double in Potter
and watched Star
Trek while eating
Ricker food. Be
lieve me, it's not as
awesome as it
sounds.
After having to
make the gut -
wrenching deci-

sion to pass up MSTRKRFT I weaseled my
way into the growing crowd for Kings of
Leon. As the set started and I continued to
navigate my way through sticky, sweaty bod
ies for better position I looked up to one of
the giant jumbotron screens flanking the
main stage and saw a rock star.There he was,
the lead singer and guitarist, with long black
hair, black jeans, and heeled snakeskin
boots. A sort of updated Lynyrd Skynyrd.
