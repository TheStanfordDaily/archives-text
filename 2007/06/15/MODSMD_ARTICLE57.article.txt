# It's time to think about your Stanford ending
## 
### LIA HARDIN INTERMISSION HALLOT COORDINATOR 
IT IS THE END of an era for the approxi
mately 37 seniors who opted not to go to grad
school or take a job on campus, and summer is
in the air.The vegetation has turned a pleasant
brownish color and because we're in California,
temperatures less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit
are a distant memory. For some of us, this is the
final quarter of our senior year at Stanford.
Times like these call for some perspective.
My favorite kind of perspective-getting en
tails rule breaking. Breaking a rule means cross
ing an invisible barrier. You cross that barrier,
and you look back at the world from the other
side, sticking your tongue out at it. You feel re
bellious. you feel free.
1 don't think I'm alone in this. We've all been
steam tunneling around this institution's twisty
innards since we were freshmen. We've all
snuck into some buildinp after-hours and stayed

up all night, drunk on that feeling of derring-do
that accompanies even our most insignificant
rebellions. We've all listed that Jack Kerouac
quote in our profiles. You know, the one that
goes: "the only people for me are the mad
0ne5...."
Because an end like this one ought to be spe
cial. let's continue to thwart expectations and
ignore unspoken rules. Let's take the time and
the effort to end our Stanford careers with piz
zazz. We're about to cross a significant symbol
ic threshold. We're done! We're finally finished!
No, seniors, we simply cannot allow finals to
come and go without adding a good dose or two
of creative debauchery and regulation-thwart
ing. So. without further ado. here are some nays
to end your Stanford career:
Head up to the Dish at sunrise. You're not
actually supposed to cross the fence at night,
but it's not really that difficult, if you don't mind
the mountain lions.The view from the top is ter
rific — the sun peeks its head out over the Bay

and the streaks of purples, pinks and oranges in
the sky are reminiscent of a pointing by that
artist whose name you've never bothered to re
member but whose artwork you will never for
get.
Ride the bus to a random destination. Ap
parently, Stanford students ride the public
buses so infrequently that even the 22, which
runs down HI C amino Real, is unexplored terri
tory. With gas prices heading skyward, embrac
ing public transportation in all its glory is a life
skill, and there are fun places to go, I promise.
. C»o to meet 21 professor whose work you ad
mire. Ibis is Stanford,and you might never have
another shot at a conversation with that bril
liant geneticist or the Nobel Prize winner
you've only ever heard about.
Organize an unregistered party. Call it a
gathering of Iriends but make sure to live it
up, seniors! Make sure to name the party some-
thing like, "Crazed Party at which
Minors will Undoubtedly Imbibe
Alcoholic Beverages and Engage
in Lewd Behavior." Afterwards,
send a leftover invitation to the
OSA.
Participate in random acts of
civil disobedience. Rallies organ
ized by Sweat-Free or any one of
the dozens of activist groups on
campus are perfect for this. Throw
yourself into the act of protesting,
even if you couldn't care less about
the cause. Shout loudly, participate
in socially unacceptable behavior
and embarrass yourself in public. If
you plan on going into politics,
wear a disguise and don't talk to the
media. You'll be fine.
Burst the Stanford Hubble be
fore you leave it. Stanford is called
a bubble so often that "the Stan
ford bubble" has become a point
less cliche, a piece of drivel that

means nothing. So we hardly leave
the buildings in which we live and
work and play. So what? Does any
one? In the next couple of weeks. 1
implore all of you to put some soap
on your hands and break through
that invisible iridescent mem
brane!
Hie most important thing is that
we do things that excite us, that
scare us, that change our lives.
I hen, when we turn back around at
look at campus we feel vertigo, we
feel freedom. But most important
ly, we end our Stanford career in
style.
We have this one chance to truly
become like Kerouac's mad ones,
and never let go of that feeling. For
all my pretensions, one of my weak
nesses is that I am not fearless. I sel
dom leave the confines of this cam
pus, which shelters me too much. I
think. But these last two weeks are
a chance for me to take a trip out
side of my comfort zone, to burst
my own self-inflicted bubble.
Come on. join me. Raging, we
can burn down these soapy fortifi
cations.
