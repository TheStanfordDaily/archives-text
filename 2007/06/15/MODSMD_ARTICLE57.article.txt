# It's time to think about your Stanford ending
## 
### LIA HARDIN INTERMISSION HALLOT COORDINATOR 
IT IS THE END of an era for the approxi
mately 37 seniors who opted not to go to grad
school or take a job on campus, and summer is
in the air.The vegetation has turned a pleasant
brownish color and because we're in California,
temperatures less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit
are a distant memory. For some of us, this is the
final quarter of our senior year at Stanford.
Times like these call for some perspective.
My favorite kind of perspective-getting en
tails rule breaking. Breaking a rule means cross
ing an invisible barrier. You cross that barrier,
and you look back at the world from the other
side, sticking your tongue out at it. You feel re
bellious. you feel free.
1 don't think I'm alone in this. We've all been
steam tunneling around this institution's twisty
innards since we were freshmen. We've all
snuck into some buildinp after-hours and stayed

up all night, drunk on that feeling of derring-do
that accompanies even our most insignificant
rebellions. We've all listed that Jack Kerouac
quote in our profiles. You know, the one that
goes: "the only people for me are the mad
0ne5...."
Because an end like this one ought to be spe
cial. let's continue to thwart expectations and
ignore unspoken rules. Let's take the time and
the effort to end our Stanford careers with piz
zazz. We're about to cross a significant symbol
ic threshold. We're done! We're finally finished!
No, seniors, we simply cannot allow finals to
come and go without adding a good dose or two
of creative debauchery and regulation-thwart
ing. So. without further ado. here are some nays
to end your Stanford career:
Head up to the Dish at sunrise. You're not
actually supposed to cross the fence at night,
but it's not really that difficult, if you don't mind
the mountain lions.The view from the top is ter
rific — the sun peeks its head out over the Bay

and the streaks of purples, pinks and oranges in
the sky are reminiscent of a pointing by that
artist whose name you've never bothered to re
member but whose artwork you will never for
get.
Ride the bus to a random destination. Ap
parently, Stanford students ride the public
buses so infrequently that even the 22, which
runs down HI C amino Real, is unexplored terri
tory. With gas prices heading skyward, embrac
ing public transportation in all its glory is a life
skill, and there are fun places to go, I promise.
. C»o to meet 21 professor whose work you ad
mire. Ibis is Stanford,and you might never have
another shot at a conversation with that bril
liant geneticist or the Nobel Prize winner
you've only ever heard about.
Organize an unregistered party. Call it a
gathering of Iriends but make sure to live it
up, seniors! Make sure to name the party some-
