# Miller's eye always on the future
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
In this Nov. 2, 2006 story, graduating senior Zack
Miller spoke of the "really big things" the Cardinal could
accomplish this year — and he was right: The Cardinal
took the NCAA title for the first time in 13 years.
Miller himself was a major factor in the win, firing a
one-under 279 for 15th individually (tied for second-best
among the Stanford squad). He also tied for 22nd at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships (later earning
first team All-Pac-10 honors) and scored 36th at the
NCAA West Regional on his way to becoming a third
team All-American.
Competing in all 13 of Stanford's events this season,
Miller had a final 71.4 stroke average (among Stanford's
top 10 all-time), nine top-25 finishes and five top-10 fin
ishes. He also earned three individual titles: the Gopher
Invitational, Prestige and CordeValle Classic.

When men's golf coach Conrad Ray was asked if
there was anything quirky about senior Zack Miller, it
didn't take him long to respond.

"Miller plays with two putters," Ray said. "He takes
a lot of harassment from the guys. It's really rare in golf
to see a golfer use two putters consistently but it has
worked well for him so far."
So...Miller uses two putters. The shorter one is used
for long putts, and the longer one is used for short putts.
Of course, there is more to the quiet and amiable
Miller than just his quirky putting. The senior is plan
ning to pursue a career in golf after graduation.
"It's an interesting yet uncertain path," Miller said.
"Once you turn pro you're definitely on your own. Pro
fessional golf is an extremely difficult profession at first
because people really only think of golfers who are top
players in world."
But Miller may just have what it takes to be one of
those top players himself someday
"Zack should definitely give it shot." Ray said. "To
be able to win and compete with the high skill level in
the Pac-10, it would be only the natural succession for
Zack to move on to the pros. He has a great short game
and a great touch. All of these things factor well into a

great professional career."
Throughout the fall season.
Miller has consistently proven that
he has the talent to make it in the
world of professional golf. Most re
cently. he was named the Golf World
Ciolfer of the Week for his perform
ance m the Prestige at the PCiA
West Tournament in La Ouinta,
Calif.
The Prestige was the first individ
ual win of Miller's collegiate career.
With the tournament on the line.
Miller had to cover 30 feet with two
putts. After overshooting the first
attempt, he pulled out his long put
ter and sunk the winning putt.
"It was the best golf experience
of my lite," Miller said. "What made
it great was just having my team
mates there to celebrate it with."
As a child. Miller was a three
sport athlete hut none of the three
was golf. Rather, he focused on
baseball, football and basketball.
" I"hough I love baseball, it was a
sort of blessing that 1 was never on a
good team," Miller joked. "It turned
me away from the sport and opened
me up to golf."
Miller's grandfather was the first
to introduce him to golf, when he
was just seven years old. His grand
father remains his biggest fan.
"My family tells me that I am a
younger version of him." Miller said.
Miller has received an over
whelming amount of family support
throughout his career. In high

school, his parents transported him
to tournaments all over the world,
including in Japan and Scotland,
leading to his inevitable recruitment
to Stanford. His parents have been
extremely supportive in his decision
to follow golf.
"At the end of my junior year. I
had to figure out which internship or
job 1 was going to pursue for the
summer," Miller said. "In the end. I
realized that I didn't want to give up
on golf just yet. So. I spent all sum
mer going to tournaments and get
ting the best help possible to im
prove my game for senior year."
Miller has had a fantastic fall sea
son thus far in 2006.1 le has won two
tournaments — a tie for first at the
Gopher Invitational and an individ
ual win at the Prestige — and has
compiled a 72.7 stroke average.
"So far it's been a great year."
Miller said. "Up to this point we've
been really successful. If we can end
it with a win. it'll be one of the best
falls we could have asked for. It's
nice to be a senior golfer on a team
that is competitive and that can do
really big things this year."
iliough Miller has big plans, he
keeps things in perspective and
stays humble.
"To deal with the pressure. I just
remember that at the end of the day.
whether I make this putt or not. my
life isn't going to change that much."
Miller said. "I'm going to hang out
with my roommate or talk to
friends. At the match, sometimes it
feels like do or die. but life goes on
after I walk off of the course."
