# Miller's eye always on the future

### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
In this Nov. 2, 2006 story, graduating senior Zack
Miller spoke of the "really big things" the Cardinal could
accomplish this year â€” and he was right: The Cardinal
took the NCAA title for the first time in 13 years.
Miller himself was a major factor in the win, firing a
one-under 279 for 15th individually (tied for second-best
among the Stanford squad). He also tied for 22nd at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships (later earning
first team All-Pac-10 honors) and scored 36th at the
NCAA West Regional on his way to becoming a third
team All-American.
Competing in all 13 of Stanford's events this season,
Miller had a final 71.4 stroke average (among Stanford's

ishes. He also earned three individual titles: the Gopher
Invitational, Prestige and CordeValle Classic.

Of course, there is more to the quiet and amiable
Miller than just his quirky putting. The senior is plan
ning to pursue a career in golf after graduation.
"It's an interesting yet uncertain path," Miller said.
"Once you turn pro you're definitely on your own. Pro
fessional golf is an extremely difficult profession at first
because people really only think of golfers who are top
players in world."
But Miller may just have what it takes to be one of
those top players himself someday
"Zack should definitely give it shot." Ray said. "To
be able to win and compete with the high skill level in
the Pac-10, it would be only the natural succession for
Zack to move on to the pros. He has a great short game
and a great touch. All of these things factor well into a

winning streak. Though their final season failed to live up to precedent, the duo's records will hold strong for years to come.
