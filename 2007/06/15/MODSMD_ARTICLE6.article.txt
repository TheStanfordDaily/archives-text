Santa Rosa police announced last night
that the body of missing second-year doc
toral student in electrical engineering
Mengyao "May" Zhou, 23. was found in the
trunk of her car. Zhou had been missing
since Saturday when she left her residence
in Rains House to run errands.
As word of Zhou's death trickled out. the
graduate community registered shock and
sadness, and many expressed surprise at the
apparent suicide of the second-year doctor
al student in electrical engineering.
"It was a terrible shock, as I think we v.ere
all hoping she would show up soon." said
Graduate Student Council (GSC) co-chair
and electrical engineering student Paul Gur
ney. "Like all of May's grad. student col
leagues at Stanford, I'm really sad about the
latest news."
Some students expressed surprise that a

student as driven, ambitious and seemingly
successful as Zhou would have taken her
own life.
"I am very shocked to hear this, and 1
can't believe she could have committed sui
cide. Even after she was found missing, 1
wasn't expecting her to turn out dead,"
wrote Yuki Konda in an e-mail to the Daily.
A fellow electrical engineering student,
Konda took a class with Zhou and worked
on a computer vision project with her.
"She was a very driven individual and
the main motivator of our group." he added.
"She did a lot of work."
Konda. like others, said that he was sur
prised to find out that foul play was not in
volved.
1 think it's just odd." he said, adding that
figuring out what might have driven Zhou
to take her own life is "hard to say since we
can't really see inside her mind."
Many graduate students found out about
Zhou's death through e-mail lists. One e
mail from Director of the Graduate Life Of
fice Chris Griffith, which labeled the death

"an apparent suicide," was sent to residents
of Rains House, where Zhou lived. Students
then forwarded the e-mail to other gradu
ate student lists.
"The atmosphere here has been con
cerned [since her disappearance]." said Eva
Steinle-Darling.one of two head Communi
ty Associates at Rains. "1 haven't spoken to
anyone who knew her personally, hut every
one was anxious and wondering."
Steinle-Darling also said that Zhou's
roommate is currently off-campus with
family friends in an effort to stay away from
the media.
Zhou was also a member of Women in
Electrical Engineering (WEE) until her
death. In an e-mail to the Daily, WEE pres
idents Ana Bertran Ortiz and Kamakshi
Sivaramakrishnan praised Zhou's academic
prowess.
"May was a driven student who was on
her way to embarking on a promising re
search program." they said. "She seemed to
have acclimated well to the academic life in
the department and Stanford in general."

Zhou was an undergraduate at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) be
fore coming to Stanford to pursue graduate
studies. Within a year of her arrival at the
Farm, she was awarded the Gabilan Fellow
ship to fund her research.
According to students who knew her.
Zhou passed the electrical engineering qual
ifying exams, which can often be a stressful
time for graduate students, on her first at
tempt as a first-year student last January.
"Transition into graduate student life at
Stanford and the Electrical Engineering de
partment can be challenging at times," Ortiz
and Sivaramakrishnan said.
Most students also expressed sympathy
for Zhou's family.
"My thoughts now are with her family
and friends," Gurney said. "1 can't even
imagine how difficult this must be for
them."
