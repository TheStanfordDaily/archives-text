For many Stanford student-athletes, graduation brings an end to both their ac
ademic and sporting careers. Some will continue on in the pros, others will let
their degrees help them through the working world, but all will carry the many
lessons they learned as part of the Cardinal, whether in the classroom, gym, on
court or on the field.
The following are the stories of a few of those graduating athletes, collected
from the past year of Daily articles. While some look forward to then-uncom
pleted seasons and others look back on all they had done so far, each left a mark
with the Cardinal, whether in the form of records, honors or championship titles,
and each has many things to share.
