# Newlin and Smith's paint power
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Though graduating seniors Brooke
Smith and Kristen Newlin didn't have
the Stanford postseason live up to the
expectations they expressed in this Mar.
2 story, the paint power of the duo was
undeniable.
Smith started in all 34 season games
and finished second in team scoring
(13.9 points per game) and rebounding
(7.6 per game). In Stanford's Pacific-10
Conference Tournament win, she
scored 11 points and eight boards
against Arizona State, and in the NCAA
first round she had a season-high 29
points on 13-of-17 shooting against
Idaho State.
Newlin also started all 34 games and
recorded six double-doubles on the sea
son. She led the team in rebounding
with 7.9 per game and contributed in
the clutch at the Pac-1() Tournament
with 10 boards and nine boards in the
semifinal and final, respectively.
Now, the duo is splitting off into the
WNBA. Smith was picked 23rd overall
by the Minnesota Lynx, while Newlin
went 34th to the Houston Comets.

For seniors Brooke Smith and Kris
ten Newlin. four seasons with Stanford
women's basketball came down to the
final seconds against Southern Califor
nia this past Sunday [Feb.2s]. With the
Cardinal down 51-50 against the
Women of Troy, and 2:28 to go, it was
time for the two centers to step up yet
again for the Cardinal.
Newlin responded to Sun Devil
Morghan Medlock's game-retaking
three pointer with a jumper at 2:14 to
go. USC's Eshaya Murphy countered
with a layup, but freshman center
Jayne Appel gave Stanford its own
one-point lead.
With just 11 seconds left on the
clock, and the Sun Devils still fighting
for an upset. Smith's two free throws
sealed the deal for the Cardinal. 56-53

— at the same time capping her and
Newlin's Stanford careers.
Except for the postseason, that is.
"[That was the end of] our regular
season, hut we really we see what's
coming up as a new beginning," Newl

in said. "We really want to keep the
season going as long as possible."
So, with the Cardinal s first game of
the Pacific-10 Conference Tourna

defenders and shooters, and they helped train rising star Jayne Appel.
mcnt tomorrow afternoon, and the
NCAA tournament just two weeks
away. Smith and Newlin are hoping for
many more tight finishes and victo
ries.
"We're both feeling a little sense or
urgency, knowing that it's now or
never for us." Newlin said. "Whatever
we want to get done, we have to do it
this year."
Promising to "bring a little extra
something" to postseason play, the
power duo on the paint is looking to
put the past behind them. Last Sun
day's senior day, featuring roses, hugs
from head coach I ara Van Derveer and
the customary snipping of the net was

swept away with tip-off.
"It was little hit emotional, hut we
put that all behind us, and once we
started playing, we knew we still had to
win that game to become Pac-10
champs," Newlin said.
The drive to clinch a seventh straight
Pac-10 regular-season title for Stan
ford pushed Smith and Newlin
through the final minutes and mo
ments. Now. though, the seniors are fu
eled by the drive to reclaim the Pac-10
Tournament title after last year's upset
at the hands of UCLA.
And. ignoring the elephant in the
room — at long last (after three
straight trips to the I lite l ight), a trip
to the Final l our, or daresay it. a na
tional championship — Smith and
Newlin agree that taking it one game
at a time is paramount.
"Coming into the postseason sen
ior year, we know we're only guaran

teed one more game, so we're focusing
on each one as it comes," Smith said.
"We know what we want, but we also
know it's a long way to get there."
Iliis weekend's tournament will
provide a barometei l<»r Stanford, es
pecially considering the possible
three-game absence of junior guard
Candice Wiggins. Smith and Newlin
are ready to step up as they already
have.
In the two games thus far without
the Cardinal's leading scorer. Smith
had 14 points (and 7 rebounds) against
UCLA and 13 points against the

lowed up with nine more against I JSC',
along with 10 points.'!he performanc
es finished off Stanford's 17-1 Pac-10
record — and put targets on the backs
of the two dominant seniors.
"We have to come out and play

with energy and with desire," Smith
said. "The teams in the Pac-10 are
going to come out wanting to beat lis.
We have to bring something to each
game; we have to play with a little bit of
attitude and really be aggressive."
Helping the two will be the Cardi
nal's recent leading scorer in Wiggins'
absence: the newly named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, Appel. She had
24 points and nine rebounds against
UCLA and a further 14 points and
nine rebounds versus the Women of
Troy.
Developing into yet another force
under the basket for the Cardinal.
Appel was quick to give credit on Sun
day.
"[Brooke and Kristen| have taught
me everything . . . throughout the
whole year, on and off the court," she
said.
Along with sophomore center

Morgan Clybum. Appel has taken on
Newlin and Smith in two-on two
games during practice all season. The
older posts avoid saying that the expe
rience h;is taught Appel "everything,"
though.
"Jayne's obviously a talented bas
ketball player," Smith said. "She picks
up and learns really quickly and has a
great attitude and outlook on the team
aspects of the game."
Smith and Newlin, themselves,
have proved largely beneficial to the
team, whether contributing to the
scoreboard or to the development of
the team. Reminiscing about their own
growth since their freshman seasons,
the duo is happy "showing (the
younger players] the ropes, helping
them figure things out and giving
back," Smith said.
"Hopefully we're setting a stan
dard for what they might be able to

pass on to younger kids coming in ."
Newlin added."l know I came in look
ing at the seniors, expecting to play as
hard as they played,so hopefully we're
leaving that work ethic in them."
That ethic will have to come
through in the coming weeks for the
Pac-10 and NCAA tourneys. With
blue-shaded images of Newlin and
Smith — as often seen, guarding the
basket from a shot attempt, in a display
of their height and strength — gracing
the posters for the NCAA first and
second rounds hosted at Maples, the
duo hopes, and believes, it can make
the effort to pull Stanford through the
postseason as far as possible.
"We definitely want to help the
team and make tile experience last as
long as possible," Smith said.

Women of Troy, and 2:28 to go, it was
time for the two centers to step up yet
again for the Cardinal.
Newlin responded to Sun Devil
Morghan Medlock's game-retaking
three pointer with a jumper at 2:14 to
go. USC's Eshaya Murphy countered
with a layup, but freshman center
Jayne Appel gave Stanford its own
one-point lead.
With just 11 seconds left on the
clock, and the Sun Devils still fighting
for an upset. Smith's two free throws
sealed the deal for the Cardinal. 56-53

— at the same time capping her and
Newlin's Stanford careers.
Except for the postseason, that is.
"[That was the end of] our regular
season, hut we really we see what's
coming up as a new beginning," Newl

in said. "We really want to keep the
season going as long as possible."
So, with the Cardinal s first game of
the Pacific-10 Conference Tourna

mcnt tomorrow afternoon, and the
NCAA tournament just two weeks
away. Smith and Newlin are hoping for
many more tight finishes and victo
ries.
"We're both feeling a little sense or
urgency, knowing that it's now or
never for us." Newlin said. "Whatever
we want to get done, we have to do it
this year."
Promising to "bring a little extra
something" to postseason play, the
power duo on the paint is looking to
put the past behind them. Last Sun
day's senior day, featuring roses, hugs
from head coach I ara Van Derveer and
the customary snipping of the net was

swept away with tip-off.
"It was little hit emotional, hut we
put that all behind us, and once we
started playing, we knew we still had to
win that game to become Pac-10
champs," Newlin said.
The drive to clinch a seventh straight
Pac-10 regular-season title for Stan
ford pushed Smith and Newlin
through the final minutes and mo
ments. Now. though, the seniors are fu
eled by the drive to reclaim the Pac-10
Tournament title after last year's upset
at the hands of UCLA.
And. ignoring the elephant in the
room — at long last (after three
straight trips to the I lite l ight), a trip
to the Final l our, or daresay it. a na
tional championship — Smith and
Newlin agree that taking it one game
at a time is paramount.
"Coming into the postseason sen
ior year, we know we're only guaran

teed one more game, so we're focusing
on each one as it comes," Smith said.
"We know what we want, but we also
know it's a long way to get there."
Iliis weekend's tournament will
provide a barometei l<»r Stanford, es
pecially considering the possible
three-game absence of junior guard
Candice Wiggins. Smith and Newlin
are ready to step up as they already
have.
In the two games thus far without
the Cardinal's leading scorer. Smith
had 14 points (and 7 rebounds) against
UCLA and 13 points against the
Women of Troy. Newlin had 10 re
bounds against the Bruins, and fol
lowed up with nine more against I JSC',
along with 10 points.'!he performanc
es finished off Stanford's 17-1 Pac-10
record — and put targets on the backs
of the two dominant seniors.
"We have to come out and play

with energy and with desire," Smith
said. "The teams in the Pac-10 are
going to come out wanting to beat lis.
We have to bring something to each
game; we have to play with a little bit of
attitude and really be aggressive."
Helping the two will be the Cardi
nal's recent leading scorer in Wiggins'
absence: the newly named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, Appel. She had
24 points and nine rebounds against
UCLA and a further 14 points and
nine rebounds versus the Women of
Troy.
Developing into yet another force
under the basket for the Cardinal.
Appel was quick to give credit on Sun
day.
"[Brooke and Kristen| have taught
me everything . . . throughout the
whole year, on and off the court," she
said.
Along with sophomore center

Morgan Clybum. Appel has taken on
Newlin and Smith in two-on two
games during practice all season. The
older posts avoid saying that the expe
rience h;is taught Appel "everything,"
though.
"Jayne's obviously a talented bas
ketball player," Smith said. "She picks
up and learns really quickly and has a
great attitude and outlook on the team
aspects of the game."
Smith and Newlin, themselves,
have proved largely beneficial to the
team, whether contributing to the
scoreboard or to the development of
the team. Reminiscing about their own
growth since their freshman seasons,
the duo is happy "showing (the
younger players] the ropes, helping
them figure things out and giving
back," Smith said.
"Hopefully we're setting a stan
dard for what they might be able to

pass on to younger kids coming in ."
Newlin added."l know I came in look
ing at the seniors, expecting to play as
hard as they played,so hopefully we're
leaving that work ethic in them."
That ethic will have to come
through in the coming weeks for the
Pac-10 and NCAA tourneys. With
blue-shaded images of Newlin and
Smith — as often seen, guarding the
basket from a shot attempt, in a display
of their height and strength — gracing
the posters for the NCAA first and
second rounds hosted at Maples, the
duo hopes, and believes, it can make
the effort to pull Stanford through the
postseason as far as possible.
"We definitely want to help the
team and make tile experience last as
long as possible," Smith said.
