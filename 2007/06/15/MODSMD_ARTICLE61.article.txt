### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Though graduating seniors Brooke
Smith and Kristen Newlin didn't have
the Stanford postseason live up to the
expectations they expressed in this Mar.
2 story, the paint power of the duo was
undeniable.
Smith started in all 34 season games
and finished second in team scoring
(13.9 points per game) and rebounding
(7.6 per game). In Stanford's Pacific-10
Conference Tournament win, she
scored 11 points and eight boards
against Arizona State, and in the NCAA
first round she had a season-high 29
points on 13-of-17 shooting against
Idaho State.
Newlin also started all 34 games and
recorded six double-doubles on the sea
son. She led the team in rebounding
with 7.9 per game and contributed in
the clutch at the Pac-1() Tournament
with 10 boards and nine boards in the
semifinal and final, respectively.
Now, the duo is splitting off into the
WNBA. Smith was picked 23rd overall
by the Minnesota Lynx, while Newlin
went 34th to the Houston Comets.

For seniors Brooke Smith and Kris
ten Newlin. four seasons with Stanford
women's basketball came down to the
final seconds against Southern Califor
nia this past Sunday [Feb.2s]. With the
Cardinal down 51-50 against the
Women of Troy, and 2:28 to go, it was
time for the two centers to step up yet
again for the Cardinal.
Newlin responded to Sun Devil
Morghan Medlock's game-retaking
three pointer with a jumper at 2:14 to
go. USC's Eshaya Murphy countered
with a layup, but freshman center
Jayne Appel gave Stanford its own
one-point lead.
With just 11 seconds left on the
clock, and the Sun Devils still fighting
for an upset. Smith's two free throws
sealed the deal for the Cardinal. 56-53

â€” at the same time capping her and
Newlin's Stanford careers.
Except for the postseason, that is.
"[That was the end of] our regular
season, hut we really we see what's
coming up as a new beginning," Newl

in said. "We really want to keep the
season going as long as possible."
So, with the Cardinal s first game of

under the Cardinal basket the past four years. Both were major rebounders,
defenders and shooters, and they helped train rising star Jayne Appel.
