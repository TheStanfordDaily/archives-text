# Logar and Yelsey's tennis dynasty
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Seniors Theresa Logar and Anne
Yelsey were on the cusp of making
history in this Jan. 31 article. Two
games away from tying the record
for 89 straight team wins, they were
also three games away from having
the streak broken hy Georgia.
Though the Cardinal's streak of
three NCAA titles in the time of
Yelsey/Logar was also broken in the
fourth attempt, these two top per
formers have created quite a legacy
at Stanford.
Their individual seasons ended
prematurely as well, with Logar los
ing in the Round of 16 and Yelsey
falling in the Round of 32 at the
NCAA Championships, but as a pair
or part of a team, they remain strong.

It has been eighty-seven match
es. That's the number of team
matches which seniors Anne Yelsey
and Theresa Logar of the women's
tennis team have played in their ca
reers.
87 also happens to be the number
of matches that the Cardinal has
won with the senior duo: they've
never lost a dual match in Stanford
uniforms.
The term "dynasty" seems to be
quite fitting for the three-time de
fending national champions, and the
two seniors have played a large role
in the team's astonishing success.
Both Logar and Yelsey, who
boast impressive accomplishments
over the years, were modest in eval

uating their roles in making history
(Stanford is only two match victo
ries away from tying the NCAA
record of 89).
Yelsey, a psychology major hail
ing from Newport Beach, Calif., at
tributed a large part of the team's
success over the years to the coach
es.
"1 feel like the coaches have
given us an opportunity over the
past few years to come together with
the best tennis players in the coun
try." she said. "I think that's how
Stanford tennis has become some
what of a dynasty...they do such a
good job of recruiting."
Both players have racked up nu
merous awards and accolades over
the course of their careers. Yelsey
has played on the WTA profession
al tour and even defeated a player
ranked among the top 1 (K) in the
world. She's played in the main dou
bles draw of the U.S. Open twice,
and has been nationally ranked her
self
But she was quick to deflect talk
about her individual accomplish
ments. Instead. Yelsey talked about
her teammates.
"To be able to compete and train
and spend all this time with these
talented tennis players and
friends...it's just amazing," she said.
Logar. an International Rela
tions major from Rochester Mills.
Mich., has also compiled an impres
sive list of accomplishments in her
time with Stanford. She received the
Block S — an award designated for
Stanford's Outstanding Female

Athletes in each class — three
times, was named to the 2(X)5-2(X)6
All-American team, was individual
ly ranked third in the nation at the
end of last season and advanced to
the singles finals of the NCAA
Championships last year.
Despite their lofty individual re
sumes. Yelsey and Logar both say
they have had a tremendous oppor
tunity in representing a university
like Stanford.
"The Stanford legacy attracted
me to this school since I was a young
kid," Logar said. "When you walk
out with that S' on your jersey it
means so much. You are Stanford,
and you are the best."
"Being a part of the last three
years of Stanford tennis has been
amazing," Yelsey added.
The duo both got off to a bit of a
slow start this fall.The pair's individ
ual rankings have dropped from
where they were at the end of last
season, but. as Logar explained, the
early season rankings are often
"bogus" anyway.
Yelsey was hampered by a quad
injury sustained in last year's
NCA A Championships and had to
spend much of the fall season work
ing back from that injury.
"It's all better now and I'm just
trying to get back in to match
shape," she said. "1 feel like I've
come back at just the right time."
As for life after the Stanford, the
two seniors have bright prospects.
Yelsey plans to pin sue tennis at
the professional level for the next
few years.
I played on the professional cir
cuit last summer and it went pretty
well." she said. "I'm going give it a
shot lor a couple years and see how it
goes. I m really looking forward to
it."
Logar was less sure of her situa
tion.
I m going to see how the season
goes.' she said."After that it's kind of
an open hook. I might he studying
for the LSAT or GMAT. I don't
think my tennis career is over yet. I
don t want to say that it is and I don't
want to say that i( isn't."
Regardless of what the two do in
their careers after Stanford.it is clear
that they have already left their
mark on the Cardinal tennis pro
gram. the national collegiate tennis
scene and the university they repre
sent.
