### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Llie four women 's water polo seniors were
right were they wonted to he 10 days after this
May 3 story: in position for an NCAA title.
Though those hopes were dashed by UCLA
in a tight, 5-4 upset, tlieii presence surely was
felt the four had a a unbilled eight goals in the
tournament (Hansen also had five saves in the
/ ( LA match), and all o/ them were named to
all tournament teams as well as honored as All-
Americans later this year.

for Stanford women's water polo's four
seniors, next weekend's NCAA Champi
onships will be a bittersweet last hurrah.'lhey
will lace up their Cardinal caps for the last few
times, aiming to bring a national title back to
the I arm for the first time in their careers.

ITiese four seasoned veterans — driver
Katie Hansen, two-meter Christina Hewko,
goalie Meridith McColl and two-meter de
fender Alison Gregorka — lead a Cardinal
squad that is seeded No. I in the NCAA Tour
nament for the first time since 2()02. the year
before I he four arrived at Stanford.
I he top seed was no surprise to the quaitet.
In the water, they quite literally do it all for
Stanford.
Hansen guides the offense from the
perimeter, controlling the pace of play and
providing a cannon of a right arm that has pro
duced 173 career goals. I lewko's scoring abili
ty at set has earned her two All-Amci ican hon
ors while Gregorka anchors Stanford's field
defense, shutting down opponents' best play
ers at the two-meter mark. McColl,a four-year
starter, has only improved with age, at times
single handedly keeping the Cardinal in tight

games.
Hut despite their individual accolades, all
lour speak lust about their team.That attitude
comes as no surprise to head coach John Tan
nei. who praised his veterans.
"'I hey're happy to fulfill their roles; they do
their jobs really well, and they take great pride
in that." lanner said. "But they also relish
being a part of something that is far greater, so
|they're] happy to be behind the scenes and
d< >n't need to have attention."
Not surprisingly, the seniors' leadership has
extended outside the confines of the Avery
Aquatic Center. Ihey have guided this year's
squad toward an identity, creating the same
sense of unity that initially drew them to Stan
ford.
"I feel like the people who end up here arc
kind«>l a different breed in general." Gregorka
said. "We choose to hang out with each other

out of the water, which certainly isn't some
thing everyone does, and I think that team dy
namic [really] carries over into the water."
Tanner also attested to the success the four
seniors have had in uniting this team, forging
them into N( 'AA-title fronti tinners.
"All four of our seniors biing very distinct
backgrounds and influence on things away
from the pool," he said "1 think any team is
successful only as much as the members of the
team are committed to one another beyond
just the games when fans are there."
The team named Gregorka and I lansen its
captains, but (Jregorka saicl that leadership has
been a collective effort.
"Yes, Katie and I are written down as being
the captains, but I feel like all four of us have a
veiy equal role," she said."l honestly think that
the four seniors have sort of made a pact to
lead it together this year."

Gregorka added that becoming a senior
has altered her perception of the team.
"I've always looked up to the upperclass
men, especially as a freshman and sopho
more," she said."They knew the rules,the sys
tem. the coaches and how to get everyone in
volved and a part of the team. Being one now
is a little funny, especially knowing that we are
the oldest and that is it our responsibility to
take on the role of being the leaders, not only
by example, but also by being the enforcers,
more or less."
Whatever formula McColl. Hewko,
Hansen and Gregorka have applied this sea
son. there's no doubt as to its efficacy. So re
gardless of the outcome next weekend, per
haps that result will stand as most important of
all.
