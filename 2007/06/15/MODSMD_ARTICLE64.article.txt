## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
While on course to be friends for life, seniors
Lauren I odd and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
w ere also on course to the Cardinal's best NCAA
finish since 2000, taking fifth at May's champi
onships.
Todd led Stanford in ninth individually, while
Tangtiphaiboontana was tied for 26th. The high
finish also came after the team tied for first at the
NCAA West Regional.
Tangtiphaiboontana finished her season with a
74. t) stroke average, nine top-25 finishes and five
top-I<> appearances. Todd scored a 74.9 average on
eight top-25 and four top-10 finishes.

Lven before entering Stanford, seniors Lau
ren Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana knew
that they were going to anchor the now-No. 11
Stanford women's golf team for years to come.
What they didn't know was that they would soon
become close friends as well, forging their friend
ship on and off the golf course.
Seniors in high school, Todd and Tangtiphai
boontana first met during a spring break tourna
ment in Arizona. At dinner, the two struck up
conversation knowing that they would soon be
teammates for the Card.
"The first thing I remember Lauren telling me
was. I'm a very sarcastic person, so if I throw out
any sarcastic phrases please don't hold it against
me,"'Tangtiphaiboontana said.
As Tangtiphaiboontana recounted their first
exchange of words,Todd chuckled in embarrass
ment.
"I was expecting the worst in terms of sar
casm, but Lauren wasn't that bad at all,"
Tangtiphaiboontana assured her teammate.
In their freshman year, the two could not hang
out much outside of practice and competition,
having to deal with the time pressures of school
and athletics. Still, their lifelong friendship would
begin that year.
Getting along "from the get-go," as
Tangtiphaiboontana said, the duo had fun fresh
man year, but truly developed their friendship as
sophomore. Since then, they've had forged a
unique, sister-like bond that transcends that of
mere teammates.
"We know what to say at the right time,"Todd
said. "We're good motivators for one another.
We're very competitive with each other, but not
in a bad way. If I'm not going to win anything. 1
want [the winner] to be Jennie."
Tangtiphaiboontana expressed the same sen
timents when asked about her second-half of the
tandem.
"Lauren is a great teammate — we're both
very competitive and supportive at the same
time."she said."l didn't know Lauren well before
coming into Stanford. 1 didn't think 1 would actu
ally have a best friend on the team."
This year, the two are setting career lows in
most statistical categories. Todd and Tangtiphai
boontana boast stroke averages of 74.0 and 74.7
per round, respectively. Both have also played a
team-high 26 rounds this season.
While Tangtiphaiboontana has been steadily
lowering her stroke average. Todd experienced
an off-year last season. As a junior, Todd's 76.2
stroke average was the highest it had ever been.
I"his year, though, she lowered her average to
74.0. second-lowest on the team, next to sopho
more Mari Chun.Todd credits her vast improve
ment to many factors, and among those is
Tangtiphaiboontana. Todd said that her team
mate became yet another putting and short-game
instructor for her.

"Jennie has an incredible short game," Ibdd
said. "She makes putts when she has to make
them. So. I've picked up a lot of things that she has
done."
Tangtiphaiboontana is also learning from her
friend as well. Noting Todd's ability to stroke the
ball. Tangtiphaiboontana tweaked her swing to
become the better player she is today.
Spending the last four years together has
brought Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd very
close, each knowing that they had a partner they
could count on.
"It's so much easier knowing every time 1 go
to work out, every time I go to practice and every
time I step on the field, that my friend is going to
be there,"Todd said.
Their experiences on the team have also been
similar. ITiough having played at the collegiate
level for many years, both players hadn't realized
their abilities to play at the pro-level until earlier
this season.
"Last year, when I played at nationals, it was
the first time in my career where I was in con
tention for the individual title," Tangtiphaiboon
tana said. "Usually I've never been in that posi
tion, especially at the national level, so to me. it
was a wake-up point."
"I thought to myself,' Maybe I am an actual
good player, maybe I can compete with all these
girls turning pro,'" she added. "It was a good con
fidence booster coming into this year."
Todd shared a similar anecdote, fitting for the
both.
"At the Stanford Intercollegiate last fall. I was
in the final group and it was pretty close," Todd
said. "1 played good golf, hung on, and it was the
first time I thought that I could compete with
those girls, compete at the highest level of college
golf. I hit some good strokes going down the
stretch, and it felt good doing so under pressure."
Despite their success these last four years, all
good things must come to an end. As the year
comes to a finish, the Stanford squad creeps clos
er to parting with its two longtime leaders.
Hven more so. Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd
come closer to parting with each other.
Though both will be playing in the Women's
US. Open Qualifiers later this year, their paths
will diverge for the first time in a while.
After the season finishes.Todd will be working
for Health Care Partners in Los Angeles and will
eventually head home to Phoenix. Ariz, for her
commercial real-estate license. She hopes to soon
turn pro and play out of her hometown.
Tangtiphaiboontana. on the other hand, is first
scheduled to play inThailand this summer. Later
on. she too will work for a health-care consulting
company, though in San Francisco — hundreds
of miles away from Todd. Eventually.Tangtiphai
boontana is looking at entering medical school.
When asked about keeping in touch post-
Stanford,Todd had no qualms about their friend
ship.
"1 definitely have faith that we'll stay close."
Todd said."l hope to be back in the Bay Area one
day.and I know she'll settle down here. 1 have
faith in our bond."
Offering another incentive, Todd added, "We
have to stay close — Jennie is going to be one of
my bridesmaids."
With June around the corner, the transition to
life without each other is larger than reality for
the two players. But after the last four years, it ap
pears as though nothing can break their bond.
"We travel in a pair," Tangtiphaiboontana
said. "You get one. you're going to get the other."

Seniors Lauren Todd (pictured) and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana never thought they'd become the strong leaders for women's golf
that they were this past season. Helping with each other's swing, putting and life off the golf course, they formed a strong bond.
