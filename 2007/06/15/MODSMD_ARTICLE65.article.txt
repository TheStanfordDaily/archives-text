# Rinehart's continued soft side for Cardinal Softball
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Jackie Rinehart is proof that the thrill of Cardinal sport
doesn't end with a Stanford graduation. In this May 24
story, the senior describes her plans to stick around Stan
ford Softball, and the sport in general, for years to come.

The phrase "coming full circle" has much meaning for
a leadoff hitter in softhall — the lineup starts and ends
with that player. And for senior Jackie Rinehart of the
Stanford softhall team, "coming full circle" has complete
ly defined her collegiate softhall career.
When she was eight, the Reno, Nev.-native started
playing baseball with her older brothers and father, seek
ing to be included in their practices.
"I always looked up to them Rinehart said. "[Base
ball] was always something I wanted to do with them."
Soon, though. Rinehart moved on to play with numer
ous softball teams; as she traveled around, she even came
to idolize a former Stanford softball star, Jessica Mendoza
'02.
"The person I've always look up the most is Jessica
Mendoza." Rinehart said. "She holds so many of Stan
ford's records and she's one of the best players on the U.S.
Olympic team."
Following in the footsteps of her idol, softball proved
Rinehart's own ticket to the Farm. And once here.she was
quickly thrust into the spotlight as the Cardinal's leadoff
hitter during its playoff run.
"Freshman year, going to the College World Series was
a huge thing for us right off the bat," Rinehart said. "From
then on. I took every single postseason extremely serious
ly, and I feel that I get better at-bats because of greater
concentration. It's simply all or nothing at that point."
And as the leadoff hitter, Rinehart did not disappoint.
In her freshman season, she started all 68 games for the
Cardinal, hitting .356 with SO hits, 40 runs and 13 stolen
bases. Rinehart also went on to set the single-season
record for at-bats (225).
With a strong first-year campaign under her belt. Rine
hart was able to establish herself at the top of Stanford's
order for the next three years. In that time, Rinehart has
not let up on any opposing pitchers, hitting over .300 each

season on the Farm. In fact, Rinehart will graduate as one
of only five players in Stanford history to have posted a ca
reer batting average above the .300 mark.
Although her numbers have come a long way, Rine
hart still looks back to the habits and rituals she picked up
at the start of her freshman year as sources of success.
"It's funny because I really try not to be superstitious,
but I've gotten into a routine that I've performed for four
years now," she said. "When 1 get in the batter's box, 1 al
ways enter the same way. When I 'm on deck. I do the same
routine to get relaxed and into the right mindset of hit
ting."
Rinehart has also kept up the freshman habit of hitting
last in warm-ups. But despite these throwbacks, Rine
hart's game is just as dependent on her adaptability.
"(Head] coach [John Rittman] always tell us that soft
ball is a game of failure,so if you're hitting .300, you're fail
ing seven out of 10 times." Rinehart said. "It's just taking
every at-bat as a new one. and even if you didn't have a
great at-bat the time before, you have to learn from it.
learn the pitcher's habits and go from there. I've always
had that mindset to learn from each at-bat and take it to
the next one."
Having developed a keen eye and knack for squaring
up the ball. Rinehart has been selected to three national
teams, including the USA Jr. World Team, the U.S. Elite
team and the World University team. On a bigger scale
than in her early Softball days. Rinehart has had the op
portunity travel the world, representing her country in in
ternational play. And in practicing with the game's best,
she's even been able to meet her idol.
"Jessica comes out to practice once a while,and it's one
of the coolest days when she takes the outfield with me,"
Rinehart said, "TTiose days, I get to play and talk with one
of the best in the game."
Back on the Farm, Rinehart has stood alone as Stan
ford's sole leadoff hitter, but she's also become a part of a
softball family. Planning to stay another year on campus
to finish her major in psychology. Rinehart figures she'll
remain close with the squad.
"I'm going be their biggest fan next year,"she said."l'll

Rinehart has spent so much of her
past four years with the Cardinal
women that when asked about a

couldn't choose a single one, only

I've played over 200 games in the

they play, we've been through a lot
