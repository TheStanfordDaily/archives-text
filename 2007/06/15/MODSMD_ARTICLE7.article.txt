President John Hennessy un
veiled "The Stanford Challenge"
yesterday, a five-year, $4.3 billion
fundraising campaign aimed at three
broad areas: seeking solutions to
pressing global problems, educating
students to become effective leaders
and sustaining a foundation of excel
lence.
According to University Trustee
Chairman Burt McMurtry, the com
prehensive Challenge will channel
resources into four primary initia
tives, including human health care,
international relations, environment
and sustainability and the arts. The
University will also allocate funds to
improve both graduate and under
graduate education at Stanford.
The ambitious University-wide
effort was unanimously approved by
the Board of Trustees and will focus
on multidisciplinary research and
teaching initiatives.
In a University press release,
Hennessy discussed the campaign s
goal of enabling Stanford to address
complex social and scientific chal
lenges.
"Stanford is uniquely prepared
among universities — by its breadth
of scholarship, entrepreneurial her
itage and pioneering faculty —to
provide research and real-world ap
proaches to address many of these is
sues," he said.
The Stanford Challenge will em
phasize collaboration among Stan
ford's many departments, centers
and institutes, administrators say.
"Stanford has a very strong tradi
tion of working across the disciplines
and being a nimble, collaborative
and entrepreneurial institution," said
Martin Shell, vice president of devel
opment, in an email to The Daily.
"Stanford also has a rich tradition of
a pioneering culture that spans di
rectly back to the vision of Jane and
Leland Stanford when they founded
the University. A major goal of The
Stanford Challenge is to build upon
those traditions and address the is
sues and opportunities facing hu
mankind in this new century."
The first component of the cam
paign seeks $1.4 billion to support
potentially transformative multidis
ciplinary initiatives, including the
three recently launched to address
global challenges. These initiatives
include the Initiative on Human
Health, the Initiative on the Envi
ronment and Sustainability, and the
International Initiative.
