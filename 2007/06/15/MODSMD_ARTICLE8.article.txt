The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted 12-1 tonight against holding a
runoff between the two top executive
slates of last week's elections, overruling
a motion brought to the council by Elec
tions Commissioner Bernard Fraga '08.
Before a packed audience of senators
and undergraduate students, Fraga ad
vised the Senate at yesterday's meeting
to hold a runoff between executive-elect
Avula/Jones and runner-up Brett and
Lakshmi. He cited an amendment to the
ASSU Constitution, which stipulates
that a two-slate runoff must be held if no
ticket receives a majority of votes in the
election.
Senate leaders, however, were quick
to point out that the ASSU bylaws allow
the Senate and Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) to overrule the Elections
Commissioner's recommendation with a
two-thirds vote.
Senate Chair and ASSU President
elect Hershey Avula '08 and senator and
Vice President-elect Mondaire Jones'o9
— who won the Apr. 12-13 election by
the slimmest of margins, scoring a 38-
vote victory over runners-up Brett Mam
mon '08 and Lakshmi Karra '08 — had
resigned from the Senate at the begin

ning of the meeting to comply with a
bylaw that prevents students from hold
ing both senate and executive positions.
As a result they could not vote, hut all
eight of their fellow Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC)-endorsed senators
voted against a runoff. Senator Danny
Arbeiter '08 was the sole dissenter.
In an interview with The Daily, Jones
downplayed the elections controversy.
"I feel that the real story tonight was
| Israeli divestment,"he said [See accom
panying article on the failure of the ini
tiative]."The issue discussed tonight was
really just a technicality. Even Brett and
Lakshmi agree with the decision that
both bodies came to."
Fraga said he felt compelled to call
for a runoff as stipulated by the Consti
tution.
"A literal definition of the wording
states that a majority of votes in the elec
tion must vote 'yes' or rank [the winning
slate] in the situation of an instant runoff
between the Executive slates," Fraga
said. "The obligation is to hold a runoff
[within 14 days] because that threshold
was not met." Senate mem
bers vigorously debated whether or not
to overrule Fraga's suggestion after he
told them about the runoff.
Some senators said they worried that
voter turnout, especially among gradu
ate students, would be lower in a second
election. Avula/Jones received strong
support from the graduate population in

the first election.
"Grad student turnout would be atro
cious were they to have another elec
tion," Jones said. "This is a time for
mending, not for increased polariza
tion."
Hammon.who attended the meeting,
said he played no role in bringing the
idea of a runoff to the table. He said a
former member of the Constitutional
Council contacted him and Fraga.
"I respect the judgment of the Senate
and the GSC," he said. "This is a very
rare case in terms of a lot of people ab
staining. Let the bodies do their job.
"If there is a runoff. I would like to
run. And if there's not a runoff, then I
will be happy to devote my energy to an
other worthy cause."
While most of the Undergraduate
Senate agreed with the election results.
Arbeiter said he thought the Senate had
overstepped its powers.
"It comes down to a matter of inter
pretation of the governing documents."
Arbeiter said. "Bernard absolutely did
the right thing in deciding to hold a
runoff election. The letter of Constitu
tional law says that is what he is sup
posed to do. I think it's ambiguous as to
whether the Undergraduate Senate in
this case has the prerogative to overrule
that decision."
