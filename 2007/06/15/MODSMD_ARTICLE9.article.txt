## Task force eyes mental health issues

Amid rising concern for mental
health on campus, a select group of
faculty, administrators and students
have been working behind the
scenes to better understand and im
prove mental health at Stanford.
The Student Mental Health and
WellbeingTask Force, as it is known,
was organized by Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Greg Boardman last
fall and reports directly to his office.
"The task force was created in re
sponse to the recognition that the
prevalence and complexity of stu
dent mental health issues has been
growing both nationally and here at
Stanford," Boardman said in an
email to The Daily.
The task force is composed of two
separate committees. The first is the
Campus Climate Study Group, led
by Acting Dean for Religious Life
Patricia Karlin-Neumann and Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) Director Alejandro Mar
tinez. TTie second is the Policy and
Practice Review Committee, headed
by Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, and Dean of
Students Maureen Powers.
While the groups are part of a sin
gle task force and study the same is
sues, they do so with different view
points.
"They're looking at it from the
practical perspective," Powers said,
"and we're looking at it from policy
perspective."
A third, smaller working group
charged with directly gathering in
formation about campus climate is
comprised of eight individuals who
also sit on the Campus Climate Study
Group.
The Campus Climate group
meets in its entirety twice a quarter,
but the small working group meets
on a weekly basis to gather informa
tion on the mental health climate at
the University and on what Pope
called a national mental health crisis.
When students get into Stanford,
she said, they immediately have to
begin to deal with issues related to
academic stress, and some students
do not have the skills necessary to
deal with the pressure.
"One of the things that the group
has tried to do is to look both at un
derlying causes and manifestations
of stress," said Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Resource
Center (LGBT-CRC) Director Ben
Davidson, who sits on the working
group of the Campus Climate com
mittee. "Sometimes they are indistin
guishable."
The task force's progress was
slowed earlier this quarter when it
shifted focus from information gath
ering to making resources available
to students, a transition following the
student deaths that occurred this
winter. The apparent suicide of
Mengyao "May" Zhou in January in
creased student and community con
sciousness about mental health is
sues.
"There have been four deaths in a
really small community," said Haas
Center Director Nicole Taylor, who
is also a Resident Fellow in Burbank.
"We needed to make sure to reach
out to the community and say,' These
resources are here.'"
"Mental health is an important
issue for our whole community," she
added. "Something needed to be
said."
Members of the Campus Climate
group emphasized that although the
response to the recent deaths has
been one of the group's most impor
tant functions thus far, the task
force's role is to evaluate the campus
climate as a whole, not to focus on
the smaller number of students suf
fering from acute mental health dis
orders.
"It's not serving an onibuds kind
of function," Karlin-Neumann said.
"I don't see us being engaged in a sui
cide prevention effort. We're in
volved in a campus climate evalua
tion."
Many task force members said
the most important campus climate
issue discussed thus far is the so
called Stanford Duck Syndrome' â€”
the idea that Stanford students are
calm on the surface but frantically
working to stay afloat underneath.
"The Stanford Duck Syndrome
comes up in almost every situation,"
Karlin-Neumann said.
But others did not place as much
emphasis on the analogy. Unlike her
colleagues on the Campus Climate
group, for example. Powers said that
the Stanford Duck Syndrome "has
not really been a part of our work."
Other people on the task force
also agreed,saying that too much at
tention to the metaphor could over
simplify mental health issues on
campus.
"Not everything about mental
health revolves around the Stanford
Duck Syndrome," said Alejandro
De Los Angeles'o7, a student repre
sentative on the Campus Climate
Study Group. "The mental health of
Stanford students cannot be re
duced to one oversimplified
metaphor. We're just not that sim
ple."
Friedman, who is also one of five
members of the task force's Steering
Committee, said that what the task
force ultimately recommends will
depend on the work they will be
doing in the upcoming months.
While the Stanford Duck Syndrome
figures to be a significant focus for
the task force, it is too soon to tell
what the results will be. he said.
"We do not know if we will be
making specific recommendations
for (the Stanford Duck Syndrome],"
he said. "That is not the stage we are
at right now."
