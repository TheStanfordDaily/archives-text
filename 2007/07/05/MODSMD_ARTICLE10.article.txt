## Band's provisional status lifted 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Band is finally "All Right Now" after a dra
matic year of silence in the stands. The Band was suspended
last August and later placed on indefinite provisional status
after the Band Shak was vandalized.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
announced on June 14 that he had lifted the indefinite pro
visional status ol the Band, which first tooted its newly rein
stated horns at Commencement on June 17. The announce
ment followed the Band's cooperation with a yearlong
review, which recommended the creation of an administra
tive position designed for working with the Band.
"In recent years, the University's relationship with the
Band was one more of toleration," Boardman said.
"Because the Band is a student organization, but it repre
sents Stanford in ways that other student organizations
don't, this really needs to he a partnership."
With the reinstatement of its privileges, effective immedi
ately. the Band can travel and control its own performance
schedule, hut the group remains on alcohol probation.
" The torch has now been passed back into our hands,
whereas before, it was in [the administration's] hands," said
Band Manager Adam Cohen "07. who served on the Band
Reinstatement Committee.
Boardman appointed the Band Reinstatement
Committee last fall when the Band's suspension was
changed to an indefinite provisional status.
After the committee submitted a report in April.
Boardman convened an advisory group to review the recom
mendations and provide feedback. The group agreed to the
reinstatement.
The committee recommended that a permanent adminis
trative director, responsible to the Dean of Students office,
be a liaison between the Band and the University. Associate
Dean of Students Chris Griffith, who has been working with

Band leadership since the fall as the leader of the reinstate
ment committee, will continue as interim director until a
replacement is found.
Cohen spoke positively about the group's relationship
with Griffith.
"It was nice to have some sort of administrative presence
so we can get the things we want," he said, "and it makes the
administration more comfortable because there's an adult
there. It's a win-win situation."
University representatives were quick to assert that the
additional administrative oversight will not sanitize the
Band's traditionally irreverent character.
"I think more than ever the University is committed to
continuing the tradition of the Band's creative spirit,"
Boardman said. "Now we're a partner with the Band, so we
want to help it be successful."
"I don't have any doubt the Band will continue to amaze
people, amuse people and engage the community," added
Griffith.
Cohen agreed that the performances the Stanford communi
ty has come to love will not change.
"Short of violating California laws or policies, in a clash
between the Band and administration, the Band wins."
Cohen said. "We're in control of our personality. We're
going to be just as crazy and unique and fun and awesome as
we've ever been. We're not going to change â€” and the
school doesn't want us to change, so it won't be a problem."
Both Band representatives and I Jniversity officials also
lauded the practical advantages of an administrative liaison.
University spokeswoman Kate Chesley said that since the
Band works closely with a variety of other partners, such as
Athletics and the Office of Student Activities, the new posi
tion will simplify the Band's relationships with administra
tors.
"It will make coordination and communication with the
