## Science News Roundup Pious Vitamin Deficiency 
### 
U.S. surgeons recently
removed a woman's gall
bladder through her mouth.
Doctors snaked surgical instruments
down the woman's throat and used
them to snip a hole in her stomach.
The surgeons slipped their tools
through the new hole, seized the
patient's gallbladder and pulled it
between her lips.
"Natural orifice" surgery is an
important breakthrough, as it elimi
nates scarring and hastens recovery
time by avoiding the trauma of slic
ing through abdominal muscles.
Surgeons have removed brain
tumors through noses and appen
dices through mouths. Doctors in
France even went through a woman's
vagina to remove her gallbladder.
1 just have to wonder about the
patient whose gallbladder was
yanked past her teeth. Was there a
funny taste in her mouth when she
woke up from surgery? "Did 1 fall
asleep without brushing my teeth?"
she may have wondered. "Oh yeah,
I had gallbladder rubbed all over my
tongue."
Natural orifice surgery is on the
rise, and we'll only see more organs
pulled out of unwitting noses,
mouths and vaginas. As an ironic
twist, delivering newborns via
Caesarean section is also on the rise.
Will there be a day when doctors
remove infants through women's
abdominal walls and appendices
through their vaginas?
In other news, human urine
could be used to grow better fish
food. Hatchery fish dine on plank
ton, which are usually grown on
nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers.
But researchers at Kalyani
University in India may have found
a better food source for the micro
scopic creatures.
In a study published earlier this
month, the researchers took human
urine from the university's urinals,
mixed it with ground water and
added plankton. The researchers
also fed the plankton various mix
tures of cow dung, cow urine and
poultry droppings. In the human
urine, plankton began reproducing
earlier, lived longer and produced
more offspring.
Using urine to feed plankton
would eliminate the environmental
hazards of commercial fertilizers,
which can end up in waterways and
cause harmful algae blooms. This
could be good news for the environ
ment. But I wonder about the plank
ton. I'm sure it's no accident that the
animals' food came from the univer
sity urinals, and not from women's
toilets.
Women on the birth control pill
and other forms of hormonal con

traception excrete these hormones
in their urine. When these com
pounds end up in the rivers, weird
things happen to fish. In the
Potomac River, male smallmouth
bass are sprouting eggs, and scien
tists blame pollution and the Pill. So
nourishing plankton with estrogen
laden urine is probably undesirable.
But even male pee isn't problem
tree. Antibiotics and other medi
cines can wind up in urine, and those
could affect developing plankton. If
using urine to grow fish food gains
traction, maybe the food source will
be collected from designated urinals
for drug-free boys.
News from the Middle East: fol
lowing fundamentalist dress codes
may be giving women vitamin D
deficiency. Sunlight exposure is the
main source of vitamin D for
humans, and researchers studying
Muslim women in the United Arab
Emirates who kept their entire bod
ies veiled outside their homes found
that all but two of 178 women were
deficient in the nutrient.
The women spent three months
taking vitamin D supplements, but
by the study's end, only 30 percent
had corrected their deficiency.
Researchers concluded that veiled
women need higher doses of vitamin
supplements than the general popu
lation. I guess Christopher Hitchens
can add "malnourishment" to the
list of ways religion poisons every
thing.
Some science fiction-style news:
laboratory-born life forms are one
step closer, thanks to a bacterial
genome transplant. The research
involved two species of
Mycoplasma, a small pathogen that
infects goats. Researchers purified
the DNA of one kind of
Mycoplasma and inserted it into
cells of a second Mycoplasma
species. The transplanted DNA
took control of the host cell —
effectively changing one species to
another. Eventually, researchers
aim to create a wholly synthetic
organism: a specially designed
species containing only hand-picked
DNA.
J. Craig Venter, genetics pioneer
and head of the institute who spon
sored the research, expressed hope
that the technology could be used to
make microbes that convert carbon


Shelby
Martin
dioxide into industrially useful fuels.
This is certainly a worthy goal and one
that makes it easier to forget the fact
that the line between species is being
blurred like never before. Humans
have been mucking around in DNA
for decades, but this is the closest
we've ever been to making new ani
mals from scratch. O brave new world,
that has such creatures in it!
