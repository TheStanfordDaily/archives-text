## Knowledge, Ignorance and Me 
### 
One of the first lessons one
learns when beginning a seri
ous study of something is
ignorance. Your lack of knowledge
is vast. You are without purchase in
a treacherous, inhospitable and end
less landscape.
It's a rather humbling (and, for
many, disheartening) experience.
And yet, we don't seem to learn the
right lesson.
We do, however, start off on the
right track. Met with the realization
that we are mere pimples on the big
white, splotchy face of intellectual
endeavor, we work (well, actually
we give up —but that's another
story).
Eventually, after a little time we
go from pimple to wart. Then to
large, unsightly blotch. And, before
you know it, we're covering every
little part of that face of knowledge
with the disgusting rash of compre
hension. Hooray.
(Okay, I admit, that was a dread
ful analogy. 1 mean, facial skin disor
ders as a metaphor for education?
That's absurd. On the other hand, 1
almost drove off the edge of the
Grand Canyon last week, so cut me
some slack.)
Anyway, where was I. Ah, yes.
Comprehension. So we understand,
we have it... covered. Knowledge is
ours. The world an oyster. Strippers
lining up to sleep with us. Or some
thing like that.

The only problem is, we don't.
We're not. We haven't. We are still
ignorant. All we've managed to do is
fool ourselves with a little illusion.
It is true that we are experts in
our field (or more precisely in some
tiny, miniscule, ever so small corner
of our field), but in the course of
thousands of years the sphere of
human knowledge has grown vast.
And we never seem to notice.
Secure in the knowledge of one
thing, we assume we know it all. We
forget the lesson of humility, but
cling on to the hard graft of knowl
edge acquired. And we find our
selves believing in the universality of
the latter.
Ihis might be worse for me
because I'm a physicist. Our arro
gance is almost without bound. We
preen ourselves with platitudes,
assurances that ours is the king of
the sciences and that, since science
bestrides human endeavor, we hold
all the answers. And so, we assume
the capability to pass judgment on
absolutely everything.
Be it biology or chemistry.
( limate science or engineering.
Economics or history. We insist that

we are not only qualified to hold an
opinion, but that ours is the right
one.
Actually, it's the former one of
those sentiments that's the real
problem. We are not qualified to
hold an opinion. We know nothing
outside of our fields, how on earth
can we even contemplate elevating
ourselves to the same level as those
who have studied half a lifetime or
more?
Hypocrisy is a funny thing. You
don't really recognize it even when
it's right in front of you if you're the
one blithely embracing it.
You know how it is — you sit
around with a few friends, watch
some stupid movie and laugh at the
idiotic science. Or, perhaps, you
read some ridiculous magazine arti
cle in which the author has no idea
about high school biology, but still
discusses genomics like she's being
doing it for years.
It could be the news, too.
Opinion writers are always drifting
off into areas outside of their exper
tise and getting it completely wrong.
So we mock.
Fiction writers as well. Oh, they're
the worst. They grab some hard fact,
and before you know it everything's
been twisted into some metaphysical
nonsense. Idiots. Why can't they just
stick to what they know?
