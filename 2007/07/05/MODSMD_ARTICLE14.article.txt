## Whiz-kid, 16, takes on Ph.D. at The Farm 
### JESSICA RICHMAN 
Andrew Hsu earned three
degrees at the University of
Washington by age 16 and became
the second-youngest individual to
graduate from the school. He pub
lished a book on Chinese-American
scientists and started the non-profit
World Children's Organization.
What's next for this 16-year-old whiz
kid? Stanford, as it turns out — Hsu
is coming to The Farm to complete a
Ph.D. in neuroscience.
The Daily: What, specifically, are
you studying for your Ph.D.?
Andrew Hsu: First year Ph.D. stu
dents rotate through a series of labs,
so I'll be taking the next year to work
with three different professors.
TD: How did you choose to study
neuroscience?
AH: I felt like the brain was a really
good thing to study. There are really
good tools being developed right
now and it's been studied a lot with
few results. Neuroscience is very
interdisciplinary, integrating all of
three of the fields — neurobiology,
biochemistry and chemistry — that I
studied at the undergraduate level.
1 thought specifically about
whether to go into graduate school
instead of medical school. Medical
school is really intense knowledge
gathering for four years, but it's still
learning what is already in textbooks,
not creating new things. I want to go
to graduate school to learn unknown
things.
TD: What are your aspirations in
neuroscience?
All: My strongest motivation is to
use the skills that I have built up to
help other people. I'm very interest
ed in cellular and molecular neurobi
ology and in applying my research to
the clinical setting. I want to do
things that are related to neurologi
cal diseases, such as Parkinson's or
autism.
TD: How do you gain the confidence
to do what you do?
AH: I don't really think that 1 have
any special sense of confidence.

When I entered college at age 10 or
11,1 was just going to the next step in
my education. 1 never felt that I had
to differentiate myself because of my
age because many people didn't
know how old 1 was. I just try not to
think about my age.
TI): How much do you think that
your home environment played a
role in vour successes?
AH I went to elementary school
around Seattle and then was home
schooled after fourth grade. Grades
are segregated by age, not skill. That
was really a turning point in my life.
Being home schooled really con
tributed to my emotional and mental
development. I'm very lucky to have
great parents that are supportive and
nurturing and have helped me pur
sue my dreams.
TI): Tell me about your desire to
help kids around the world.
AH: 1 founded an organization with
my brother (World Children's
Organization] dedicated to health
and language education. Our two
main products right now are English
language reading rooms in China
and Taiwan and developing water fil
ters for the Third World. We're also
looking at existing water filter
designs, trying to develop something
much cheaper and more robust.
Also, in the next year, we hope to
host an International Youth Summit,
bringing people together to talk
about health issues and language
acquisition in children.
TI): What advice do you have for
others who want to make more use
of their talents?
AH: It's really important to go out
and search for answers for yourself, if
your parents or teachers don't know
the answer. Email professors or
teachers or whomever you think can
help you achieve your goals. Also,
make good use of your spare time
because it really adds up to a lot. If
you're waiting at the bus stop or in a
restaurant, bring a library book or a
textbook. Don't waste vour time.
