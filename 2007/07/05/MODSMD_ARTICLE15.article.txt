# Farm goes up in flames

### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Firefighters brought a 177-acre brushfire
near the Stanford Dish under control on
June 25, and flames also threatened other
Stanford alfiliates: the raging Angora Fire in
South Lake Tahoe forced guests and staff at
Stanford Sierra Camp to evacuate the same
day.
The Palo Alto bla/e, which broke out
about a half-mile north of Frenchman's Gate
on Junipero Serra Boulevard, was reported
on June 25 at 4:13 p.m. and spread, quickly
toward Page Mill Road.
According to Palo Alto Fire Department
Chief Nick Marinaro "72, the brushfire
scorched 177 acres in the foothills before it
was contained that evening. Firefighters and
aircraft from several agencies, including the
California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, assisted in bringing the blaze
under control.
Certain sections of Page Mill Road and
Stanford Avenue were temporarily closed
on June 25 as a result. These are now open,
but the Dish area will remain closed until
further notice.
The uncharacteristically early-season
blaze spread quickly over the light grass near
the Dish, where a much smaller six-acre fire
burned in 2004.
Though the fire department initially
believed that the source of the blaze was a

malfunctioning generator at a water pump
ing station, Marinaro said that investigators
have found no indication that the fire was
caused by a mechanical malfunction.
"Our initial estimate was based on wit
ness accounts, hul our investigators are now
looking at a human cause," he said. "We're
continuing to investigate."
According to the most recent press
release from Fire Marshal Dan Firth, wood
en matches were found near the spot where
the fire is suspected to have started. But the
release concludes that it is still unknown
whether or not the matches "contributed to
or were the cause" of the Dish fire. The
Stanford Department of Public Safety is
continuing to investigate.
No injuries or structural damage were
reported, though the fire came within 500
yards of six houses on Page Mill Road. The
Stanford Department of Public Safety issued
a voluntary evacuation, but Marinaro said
that most residents chose to stay inside.
"None of the houses were imminently
threatened," he said. "We also sent units to
protect the Stanford observatory, but it was
never imminently threatened either. The fire
blew right past it."
But while Palo Alto residents chose to
remain home last week, those at Stanford
Sierra Camp were not so lucky.
According to the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF), the
Angora Fire in South Lake Tahoe burned

more than 3,1(H) acres just east of Fallen
Leaf Lake and Stanford Sierra Camp before
being fully contained on Monday. The fire,
which destroyed 254 homes, prompted Lt.
Gov. John Garamendi to declare a state of
emergency in California last week.
Sierra Camp Week Three guests and
staff members, including all student staff,
were evacuated on sheriff's instructions
when the fire began moving into the Fallen
Leaf basin on June 25. Sierra Camp COO
Dave Bunnett '83 and seven other staff
members remained at the camp in case of
potential fire damage. The evacuated staff
members stayed temporarily at Northstar at
la hoe until they were able to return to
camp.
Bunnett, who also serves as a fire captain
lor the local department, said in a phone
message last Thursday that Sierra Camp was
not physically threatened by the fire.
I he lire appears to be under control, but
we do have high winds expected for the next

three days," he said. "That makes it a little
scary."
In an email that he forwarded to The
Daily. Bunnett also wrote that the camp was
"doing ok."
"Everything beyond the ridge from the
ridge top hack is now black but what we see
from my office looks as it always has," he
said.
With an unexpected favorable turn in the
weather, the fire was eventually controlled
on Monday — a day earlier than the project
ed July 3 containment date. According to the
CDF, 260 fire personnel remain to monitor
the area.
1 hough Week Four of Sierra Camp was
canceled entirely, the camp plans to reopen
lor Week Five. Week Three guests will
receive refunds for any lodging expenses
incurred before the evacuation, and Week
Four guests will receive full refunds.
