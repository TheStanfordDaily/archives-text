## Tech teams roll out eco-friendly models 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Flailing powers of Detroit, take note: cutting
edge cars seem to be continuously rolling out of
the Stanford Solar Car Site.
Two separate Stanford teams, which share
workspace near the Medical School, have
announced major unveilings to display the latest
generation of Stanford cars built for ongoing
projects.
A team assembled by the Artificial
Intelligence Lab tested its new robot car, nick
named Junior, last month in Mountain View as it
prepared for the second round of Urban
Challenge — a Pentagon-sponsored contest that
will take place this fall. The Stanford Solar
Car Project team is also set to show off its next
generation vehicle, Equinox, to an audience in
the Science and Engineering Quad on July 14
before its race across the Australian Outback
this September.
The Stanford Racing Team that built Junior
— headed by Computer Science Prof. Sebastian
Thrun and Senior Research Engineer Mike
Montemerlo — was awarded $2 million by the
Pentagon in 2(X)5. The donation followed the
team's first-place finish in the Grand Challenge,
a 130-mile race in the Nevada desert designed by
the Department of Defense to spur innovation
in technologies that are applicable to automated
warfare.
That money went towards building Junior, a
blue 2(H)6 Volkswagen Passat station wagon with
a large sensor mount on top. Junior's steering,
throttle and brakes were customized by a
Volkswagen research lab in Palo Alto to be fully
computer-controllable. The car pushes the
limits of artificial intelligence engineering in its
ability to navigate urban traffic.
Last month's test near Shoreline Park was a
measured success. The robot car, which topped

out at 15 miles per hour, passed several tests,
including stopping at an intersection and passing
stationary vehicles. The trial was observed by
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (I)ARPA), and evaluated for
entry in the Urban Challenge, which will be held
on Nov. 3.
After the Grand Challenge entries proved
that robot cars could handle the rocky desert
environment, DARPA shifted its focus to an
urban warfare setting. The Urban Challenge
strives to showcase technology that could bring
the military one step closer to its goal of deploy
ing fleets of automated logistics vehicles onto the
battlefield within the next 10 years.
The advantages of deploying unmanned vehi
cles are apparent to a U.S. military growing
accustomed to suffering casualties in the desert
and urban battlefields of its recent campaigns.
The Urban Challenge will raise the bar for
Thrun and his colleagues.
"In the last Grand Challenge, it didn't really
matter whether an obstacle was a rock or a bush
because either way you'd just drive around it,"
Thrun said. "The current challenge is to move
from just sensing the environment to under

standing the environment."
The Artificial Intelligence Lab wrote soft
ware that allows Junior to actively learn and
improve its driving over lime with mapping, per
ception and planning skills. The Intel dual core
processor — stashed in the trunk — has four
times the processing power of the car's predeces
sor. The processor is required to compute the
data collected by a number of external cameras,
radars, GPS systems and a spinning laser range
finder mounted on the roof.
Meanwhile, the latest incarnation of the
Stanford solar car, designated Equinox, has been
completed and slated for exhibition next week.
The team builds a new car from scratch every
two years to compete in the World Solar
Challenge, a biennial race across the Australian
continent. Solstice, Stanford's last-generation
entry, won the stock car class in July 2(K)5 with
only commercially available, off-the-shelf parts.
Unlike Solstice, Equinox sports some cutting
edge technology upgrades that translate into
considerable performance boosts, said Alan
Laursen '07, the solar team leader. The new

parts include an expensive space
grade solar array and a digital elec
trical system.
The Challenge will be held the
third week of October, and teams
from across the globe will race from
the tropical northern city of Darwin
to the finish line in the parched
desert of Adelaide, on the southern
coast.
The historically successful
Stanford team has invited the public
to the vehicle's unveiling next week,
and expects many of its sponsors to be
present. University sponsors include

Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '19, The
President's Office and the School of
Earth Sciences. Commercial firms
Akeena Solar, Henkel, backpack sup
plier Jan Sport and high-performance
electrical car startup Tesla Motors all
made contributions.
Laursen strongly encouraged stu
dents to check out the car as well.
"After all, without the support of
the student body's special fees, we
could not afford to operate,"
Laursen said. "We have been build
ing furiously to get the car ready and
the unveiling gives us the opportuni
ty to rest and take pride in our
work."
