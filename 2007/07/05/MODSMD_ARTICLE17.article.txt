## Crimson econ. prof. turns Card Caroline Hoxby draws acclaim, controlversy 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has completed a consider
able coup in convincing Caroline
Hoxby, one of Harvard's most highly
regarded economists, to join the
University this fall after 13 years of
teaching in Cambridge.
A Loss for Harvard
National media outlets have cast
Hoxby's move as a decided victory for
Stanford — and a big blow for Harvard
— in the seemingly annual competition
of elite economics departments swoop
ing for each other's star faculty.
Economics Dept. Chair Tim Bresnahan
said he is enthusiastic about Hoxby's
imminent arrival and added that she will
arrive on campus later this summer,
before beginning to teach in the fall.
"There is an important movement
among young economists toward apply
ing rigorous and powerful economic
methods and new data to important
social problems," he said. "Caroline
Hoxby is a leader in that movement."
Hoxby said that a major determinant
of her move was that Stanford gave her
husband Blair — whose Harvard tenure
bid had reportedly failed — a tenure
offer in the English department.
While her husband will teach English
on The Farm, Hoxby will teach her hall
mark Economics of Education class to
Stanford undergraduates, as well as
public finance to graduate students.
The incoming professor said she
was "positively thrilled" to join
Stanford and wants to "contribute to
this campus," but she left some part
ing shots for Harvard.
"Stanford and other universities
have strong leaders and they're mov
ing forward," she said. "It's hard for
Harvard to move ahead if they're in
constant crisis mode."
Hoxby criticized former Harvard
President Lawrence Summers' 2(X)5
statements that there were differ
ences in the "intrinsic aptitude"
between men and women in the sci
ences. After the embattled Summers
resigned last June, Derek C. Bok
took over the post temporarily
before Drew G. Faust was perma
nently installed earlier this year.
Hoxby likened Bok to a "substi
tute teacher," and cited Harvard's
"well-known leadership problems"
as an indirect reason for her switch.
An Acclaimed but Controversial
Past
While Hoxby arrives at Stanford
with the stirring publicity of a star

within economics circles, she brings
a vita as highlighted by controversy
as it is studded with brilliance.
Her landmark paper, "Does
Competition Among Public Schools
Benefit Students and Tax Payers,"
published in 2000, argued that chil
dren perform better in cities with
more competing school districts and
became one of the most heavily
cited studies on the topic.
But in 2(X)5, Hoxby made head
lines when she became entangled in
a controversial spat with Jesse
Rothstein, a young professor at
Princeton.
Rothstein challenged the meth
ods used in Hoxby's 2(XK) paper and
claimed that the results would have
been insignificant had she used cor
rect models and data series. As an
UC-Berkeley graduate student,
Rothstein conducted research that
differed with Hoxby's findings, and
he later published a 69-page

"| Hoxby's a leader in] an important
movement among young economists toward
applying rigorous and powerful economic
methods and new data to important social
problems."
— Tim Bresnahan, Economics Dept. Chair

National Bureau of Economic
Research publication in an effort to
debunk the Harvard professor.
According to a July 2005
Harvard Crimson article, Hoxby,
who is black, claimed that
Rothstein's persistent scrutiny of
her work was a result of the "ideo
logical bias" of his Berkeley advisor,
David Card, and said that "there is
quite a lot of race and gender bias
going on here."
Rothstein, who is white, in turn
accused Hoxby of "name-calling"
and "ad-hominem" attacks.
In an interview with The Daily,
Hoxby firmly denied ever making
the controversial remarks, saying
that the "inexperienced reporter at
the time," Javier Hernandez, had
made a mistake.
"The reporter made that up or
attributed someone else's quote to
me," she said.
"That's not my style," Hoxby

added. She also said that she disput
ed the quote with The Crimson in a
letter to the editor and that die
newspaper subsequently ran a cor
rection.
Hernandez told The Daily, how
ever, that while Hoxby's letter was
indeed printed, no correction ever
ran. The reporter, who later became
The Crimson's managing editor,
said that emails and interview notes
substantiate his reporting.
"In an interview with The
Crimson and a follow-up email mes
sage, Hoxby repeatedly stated that
she believed the challenges to her
research were motivated in p;irt by
race and gender bias," Hernandez
wrote in an email to The Daily. "The
Crimson stands by a fair and honest
story that accurately reported
Hoxby's views."
In spite of the controversy that
surrounds her, Hoxby nonetheless
received considerable acclaim from
both students and peers at Harvard.
Her Economics of Education
course was often over-subscribed,
and she received nearly perfect
marks on her teaching perfor
mance. She was awarded a Phi Beta
Kappa Pri/.e as well as one of only
24 "Harvard College" professor
ships for outstanding undergradu
ate instruction.
