## CARDINAL ATHLETICS Card secures 13th Directors' Cup 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES SPORTS EDITOR 
It wasn't in question a few weeks ago, but
now it's official:
Stanford has earned its 13th straight
Directors' Cup.
The Cardinal finished the year with a grand
total of 1429.00 points, riding on the strength of
two national titles (men's golf and women's
cross country) and points in 19 of 20 possible
sports.
The Cardinal's nearest competition, UCLA,
finished a whopping 172 points behind
(1257.00 total) for its second straight year as
the runner-up, followed closelv by North
Carolina (1161.33), Michigan (1135.25) and

Southern California (1103.50) to round out the
top five.
The Directors' Cup is determined by the
Sports Academy and the National Association
of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and is
based on final NCAA Division-I standings of
up to 10 men's and 10 women's sports from
each respective school. Though 21 total sports
finished high enough to earn points for the cup,
Stanford had only 10 high finishes from the
Cardinal women (complemented by nine from
the men) count toward its official tally.
Among those were the NCAA titles in
men's golf and women's cross country, as well
as runner-up finishes in men's swimming and
diving, women's volleyball and women's water
polo. Eleven other Cardinal sports finished in

the top 10 nationally: men's gymnastics (third),
women's tennis (tied for third), women's swim
ming and diving (fourth), men's indoor track
and field (fourth), women's golf (fifth),
women's gymnastics (fifth), women's indoor
track and field (sixth), fencing (ninth),
women's soccer (tied for ninth), men's outdoor
track and field (tied for 10th) and women's
outdoor track and field (tied for 10th).
The Cardinal has won the award — which
was known as the Sears Cup prior to the 2003-
2004 season, when the U.S. Sports Academy
took over sponsorship — the last 13 years of
the trophy's 14-year history.
