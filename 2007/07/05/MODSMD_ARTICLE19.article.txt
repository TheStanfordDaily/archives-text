# CARDINAL BASEBALL
## Three sign MLB contracts Davis, Juki only ones yet to accept or reject MLB selections after June draft 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After five Stanford juniors were
selected in the annual Major League
Baseball First-Year Player Draft on
June 7-8, the futures of two remain
somewhat uncertain. Right fielder
Michael Taylor (173 rd pick overall)
and second baseman Adam Sorgi
(653 rd overall) both signed with the
Philadelphia Phillies on June 12,
while the first Cardinal player select
ed, right-handed pitcher Nolan
Gallagher (135 th overall), signed
with the Seattle Mariners on June 20
But right-handed pitcher Erik
Davis, chosen by the Texas Rangers
with the 650 th pick overall, and
catcher Brian Juhl, selected by the
Cleveland Indians with the 1,063 rd
pick overall, have yet to sign. Teams
have until Aug. 15 to sign their draft
picks â€” should the Rangers and
Indians fail to sign Davis and Juhl,
respectively, by that date, the pair
would be free to return to Stanford
for their senior seasons.
Only high-school graduates and
college juniors and seniors are eligi
ble for the draft, with juniors facing
a particularly interesting decision.
Their ability to return to college
gives them added leverage in con
tract negotiations, but should they
come back and not drastically
improve their draft stock the follow
ing season, they won't have that
same leverage again and will likely
receive a smaller contract.
Last year, seven Stanford players
were selected. All went on to sign
professional contracts.
