# Editor's Welcome
## July Fourth at The Daily Trading in fireworks for a celebration of words 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
It's the Fourth of July and I'm sitting at The
Daily office. At first, I ask myself: why?
Why am I not celebrating with my friends?
Why am I not watching fireworks? Why am I
sober?
I can hear fireworks cracking outside; I can
almost see my friends laughing around a bonfire
at the beach. Wistfully, I remember the Fourth of
Julys of my childhood spent surrounded by
friends and family on Central Park's Great Lawn.
I would lie staring at the colorful fireworks thun
dering overhead against the New York City sky
line, highlighted by the Empire State Building, lit
up in red, white and blue for the occasion.

I'm reminded of my favorite literary' quote,
from the opening pages of Jack Kerouac's "On
The Road," in which the narrator, Sal Paradise,
frames the novel's eccentric hero. Dean
Moriarty: "The only people for me are the mad
ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the
same time, the ones who never yawn or say a
commonplace thing, hut burn, burn, burn like
fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like
spiders across the stars."
So all these things come to mind as I wonder
why I'm not out celebrating the most American
of holidays.
Then I realize it's because there's somewhere
else I'd rather be — here, at The Daily, working
hard to put out a newspaper.
While everyone working on the summer vol
ume has other obligations — be they classes,
research projects or summer jobs — we are all
firmly committed to our newspaper.
Over the summer, The Daily is a misnomer.
Rather than a daily paper, our summer publica
tion is a modest, tabloid-style weekly. While it
would be next to impossible for our small sum
mer staff to turn out a newspaper every day, it is
my hope that the extra time afforded by weekly
publication will allow for more in-depth report

ing and provocative features.
For the next nine weeks. The Stanford
Weekly, which will be distributed around campus
every Thursday until Aug. 30, will provide the
Stanford community with the stories that may
not earn ink anywhere else.
While organized team sports do not compete
over the summer, our sports staff will provide fre
quent updates on Stanford athletes as they com
pete at the individual level, participate on nation
al teams and prepare for next season.
Our entertainment staff will keep a lively
watch over the campus arts scene in addition to
reviewing the summer blockbusters scheduled to
come out over the next two months.
Our columnists will continue to enliven our
opinions page with their wit and incisive look into
life at Stanford and beyond.
And our news team will stay on top of the
issues and stories that affect all levels of the
Stanford community.
While the pace of life on campus slows over
the summer, those of us who work at The
Stanford Weekly will not rest until we have sup
plied you, our readers, with the high quality
newspaper you are accustomed to.
