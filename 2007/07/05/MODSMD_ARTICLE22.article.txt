# What's next after Who's Now?
## 
### 
Like any true sports fan, I love
ESPN.
And like any sane 19-year-old
male, I grew up on Sportscenter.
Keith Olberman, Dan Patrick and
Stuart Scott were mv idols, just as
much as the athletes they reported
on.
Thankfully, then, ESPN has kept
up-to-date over the years with the
broad changes in communication,
from starting ESPN: The Magazine
to launching ESPN.com, which hap
pens to be my home page.
Regardless of the medium, how
ever, ESPN has always been reli
able. complete and entertaining.
There's a reason why the company is
the worldwide leader in sports —
just as it claims.
But for that same reason, I'm dis
gusted by ESPN's new, interactive
series Who's Now: Determine the
Ultimate Sports Star. Infusing the
worlds of pop culture and sports
even more, the show intends to
determine who the hottest athlete in
America is today.
Let alone the fact that I'm
abhorred by the thought of the
show, the judging standards of
Who's Now are vague and ambigu
ous. In the inaugural episode, which
was played as part of Sportscenter,
considerations including who
showed up at whose party and who
made the most news headlines were
at the center of the discussion.
A 32-person tournament com
posed of sports stars was drawn up,
in the process blaspheming the
NCAA Tournament with mentions
of 1 vs. 8 match-ups and 4 vs. 5 bat
tles.
For one reason or another, a
bunch of executives thought it would
be cool to have a popularity contest
between the likes of Tiger Woods
and Matt Leinart; Kobe Bryant and
Ronaldinho; and Maria Sharapova
and Vince Young.
It sounds kind of cool on paper,
but come on. Does anyone actually
care?
And that's not even the worst
part. ESPN hired many of its
respected journalists and writers —
including Michael Smith, Michael
Wilbon and Kirk Herbstreit (well,
maybe he's not so respected) — to


Jack

Above the Rim
debate the question that people
have pondered for ages: Who's hot
ter — Reggie Bush or Danica
Patrick?
Please excuse me while 1 go
puke.
1 understand that this kind of
stuff is commonplace in the 21st
century. With shows like Dancing
With The Stars and The Bachelor
making up some of the "best" that
television has to offer, ESPN's ver
sion doesn't seem all that bad.
Heck, even Sports Illustrated,
the king of sports writing since the
beginning of time, has sections enti
tled "Who's Hot, Who's Not" and
athlete factoids gauging their pop
culture tastes.
But something needs to change.
If we don't stop stunts like this now,
Shaquille O'Neal will be appearing
in Avril Lavigne music videos and
Matt Leinart will be dating Paris
Hilton. Oh, wait.
Why do we need to stop this?
Because unlike many other forms
of entertainment, sports have never
completely relied on pop culture
and the media. The world of sports
doesn't center around popularity
and "hotness" — and it shouldn't.
A walk-off home run induces
several thousand people to rise to
their feet — not because the first
baseman was dating Lindsay
Lohan, but because walk-off home
runs are probably the best thing
since sliced bread. A buzzer-beater
excites the masses — not because
of its implications on a cultural
level, but because buzzer-beaters
appeal to the simplest of human
instincts: surprise and elation.
I understand that it's inevitable
for the worlds of pop culture and
sports to collide, but media outlets
like ESPN don't need to force it on
fans with a joke of a series like
Who's Now. It's not necessary. And
I'm confident that no sports fan
over the age of eight is going to
appreciate it.
I've been watching ESPN since I
was five years old and have rarely,
it ever, been disappointed. The
company has stood for both excel
lence and entertainment in the
sports media industry since the day
it was created.
But after viewing the Who's
Now debacle a few days ago, the
only thought that crossed my mind
was: et tu, Brute?

Jack Salislmry has had enough of ath
letes going to prison, let alone dating
people who have been to prison. If you
agree, contact him at jack24@stan
