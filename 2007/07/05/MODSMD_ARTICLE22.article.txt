# What's next after Who's Now?

### 
Like any true sports fan, I love
ESPN.
And like any sane 19-year-old
male, I grew up on Sportscenter.
Keith Olberman, Dan Patrick and
Stuart Scott were mv idols, just as
much as the athletes they reported
on.
Thankfully, then, ESPN has kept
up-to-date over the years with the
broad changes in communication,
from starting ESPN: The Magazine
to launching ESPN.com, which hap
pens to be my home page.
Regardless of the medium, how
ever, ESPN has always been reli
able. complete and entertaining.
There's a reason why the company is
the worldwide leader in sports —
just as it claims.
But for that same reason, I'm dis

series Who's Now: Determine the
Ultimate Sports Star. Infusing the
worlds of pop culture and sports
even more, the show intends to
determine who the hottest athlete in
America is today.
Let alone the fact that I'm
abhorred by the thought of the
show, the judging standards of
Who's Now are vague and ambigu
ous. In the inaugural episode, which
was played as part of Sportscenter,
considerations including who
showed up at whose party and who
made the most news headlines were
at the center of the discussion.
A 32-person tournament com
posed of sports stars was drawn up,
in the process blaspheming the
NCAA Tournament with mentions
of 1 vs. 8 match-ups and 4 vs. 5 bat
tles.
For one reason or another, a
bunch of executives thought it would
be cool to have a popularity contest
between the likes of Tiger Woods
and Matt Leinart; Kobe Bryant and
Ronaldinho; and Maria Sharapova
and Vince Young.
It sounds kind of cool on paper,
but come on. Does anyone actually
care?
And that's not even the worst
part. ESPN hired many of its
respected journalists and writers —
including Michael Smith, Michael
Wilbon and Kirk Herbstreit (well,
maybe he's not so respected) — to
