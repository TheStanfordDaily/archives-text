## 
### 
Sophomore outside hitter
Cynthia Barboza took her license to
kill international during the last
weeks of June.
Though the U.S. Women's
National Volleyball team finished
fourth at the Pan-American Cup in
Colima, Mexico, Barboza came
away with 14 kills in the final two
matches, helping lead the U.S. team
to a 2008 FIVB World Grand Prix
bid.
The American women went
undefeated in pool play, but lost in
the semifinals to Brazil, 25-15, 25-

15, 25-18. Barboza had five points
on an ace and four kills in the
match.
She followed that performance
up with 10 points (all on kills)
against the Dominican Republic on
June 29. Barboza had just one
attack error on 26 swings, hut it was
n't enough to keep the national
team in contention for third place.
The U.S. women fell 25-19, 26-28,
25-18, 28-26.
