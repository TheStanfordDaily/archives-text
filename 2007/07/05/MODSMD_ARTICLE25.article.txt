## AT THE MOVIES TRANSFORMERS: More than meets the eye 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION OPTIMUS PRIME 
Robots. In. Disguise.
II those three words don't get you to stop read
ing this review and into the theater, you clearly did
not grow up in the 1980s. Alter spending countless
hours as a child in the midst of the endless battle
between the heroic Autobots and the evil
Decepticons, transforming them from cars to
robots and hack again, you might say I'm a fan of
the Transformers. Now. director Michael Bay's
live-action "Transformers" takes one of my
favorite childhood memories and brings it into the
21st century with explosive results.
I he plot of "Transformers" is topical at best.
Both factions of giant robots have landed on earth
looking for the something called the All-spark.
Some of them are gtxxl, some of them are bad.
The good ones protect humans, the bad ones kill
them. This isn't Shakespeare by any means. There
are plot holes and glaring logic issues galore, but I
guarantee that nobody is plopping down their
nine bucks to see the next Oscar contender.
The plot is thrown in almost as an afterthought.
Sam Witwicky (Shia Leßeouf) and all the human
characters dominate the first half of the film with
some pesky character development. Fortunately,
it doesn't take long for the action to get in gear
and when it hits the road, it's in high gear. Smartly
paced, "Transformers" makes sure that we care
about the characters first because if the giant
robots had shown up at the very beginning to blow
up buildings, the human characters would be col
lateral damage for my attention.
"Transformers" thrives on action and this is
where Michael Bay Ilexes his blockbuster
Cineplex muscles. Shot with the slick visuals and
the mesmerizing slow motion silhouettes against
he is known for (see "Bad Boys II"),
the film is beautiful in an a way only a Michael
Bay movie can be.
The Transformers license was ready-made
for Bay. Explosions, car chases, explosions,
guns, explosions, hot women (Megan Fox),
explosions, snarky one-liners and explosions are
all present and are dripping with cool. Cynics
called the cartoon a hall-hour toy commercial
but to call the film's blatant, yet strangely appro

priate, product placement by
GMC anything but a two
hour car commercial would

seem silly. Bay embraces his commerciality to
deliver an unapologetically sellable movie —
expect to see new Transformers on toy shelves
and a sequel in theaters sometime in the next
few summers.
As a fan of the franchise, watching cars trans
form into walking, talking robots with hundreds of
moving parts is a visual feast. Top it off with the
inclusion of Peter Cullen (the original voice of
Optimus Prime in the cartoon) as the new
Optimus. and the film pushes it over the top in
terms of nostalgia. With some less than subtle ref
erences to the show's theme song and the 1986
animated film, fans of the Transformers will lie
tickled pink by the producers' (Steven Spielberg
included) respect for the giant robots.
"Transformers" is certainly not more than meets
the eve, but damn if it isn't fun to watch.
