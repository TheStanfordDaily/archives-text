# A 						swingin' time at Frost
## 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION BIG BAD INTERMISSION MOMMY 
Frost Amphitheatre came alive on the
night of July 3 as Grammy-nominated swing
band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy performed for
Stanford Lively Arts' traditional pre-
Independence Day celebration. Hie grassy
arena, rarely seen by students — except dur
ing that gigantic peer mentor luncheon during
New Student Orientation — was packed to
the brim with local and Stanford community
members.

As people of all ages settled down with
iheir lawn chairs and picnic baskets, the jump
ing sounds of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy began.
The band, which also plays jazz and blues, is
comprised of guitarist and vocalist Scotty
Morris, drummer Kirt Sodergren. acoustic
base player Dirk Shumaker. pianist Glen
Marhekva, trumpet player Karl Hunter, saxo
phone and clarinet player Karl Hunter and
saxophonist Andy Rowley. Whew.
Throughout the night. Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy played everything from "Minnie the
Moocher" to old Louis Armstrong favorites.
The band invited the audience to call back
in songs such as "Go-Daddy-O."
With time, a few couples even began
dancing in the sidelines and some
plucky little kids let loose with some
original moves — even a cartwheel
or two.
Although it's rare that a musical
group can appeal to such a wide
range of ages. Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy seemed to be just the ticket.
Generation gaps closed as teenage
boys asked their mothers to dance
and parents twirled their giggling
toddlers into the air. The swinging
tunes were just that infectious.
As the sun began to set, more
people abandoned their inhibitions,
turning the grassy ground into a bona

fide dance floor. The hand's version
of "The Jungle Book" song "I Want
to be Just Like You," was a crowd
pleaser. Those who weren't on their
feet were bobbing their heads to the
beat, and even the younger members
of the audience were waving their
glow sticks back and forth.
When the band finished their set
at 9:30, no one was ready to stop
dancing. After the crowd rose to its
feet and chanted for an encore. Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy returned to hid
everyone adieu with their song "So-
Long-Farewell-Goodbye."
The echoes of swing music dis
solved as the fireworks show blasted
into the inky sky. Although the fire
works were accompanied by a seem
ingly never-ending medley of John
Philip Sousa's well-known military
marches, the sounds of Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy were what lingered
through the night.
