# A 						limerick, a quatrain and haiku about Michael Moore's SiCKO

### NAT HILLARD INTERMISSION BARD 
There once was a man from Flint, Michigan,
Who made fighting big healthcare his "misshion"
He sailed to Guantanamo,
My thoughts: "1 don't wanna go!"
But the prisoners are in a better condi-ti-on*
*Note: Moore calls Guantanamo "The only
place on American soil with free universal

healthcare."
Alas, for all is now in disarray
Mis-shapen chaos of well-meaning forms.
Our health is subject now to those who pay.
And this, my friends, has stirred some
mighty storms.
Summer sun is hot
Blockbuster concerning my healthcare
Now I softly weep.
