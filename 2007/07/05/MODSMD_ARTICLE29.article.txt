## Without dancing girls or singing gangsters, Once gives us a new kind of movie musical 
### DANIEL HIRSCH INTERMISSION CROONER 
'Once'
Dir. John Carney

Like any independent film with a
quirky and irreverent love story,
"Once" by writer-director John
Carney, contains many of the usual
elements: sullen, earnest and down
beat guy meets adorable and quirky
girl, who does charmingly quirky
and irreverent things (in this case,
it's her Czech accent and her pen
sion for dragging a vacuum cleaner
down the streets of Dublin like a
cocker-spaniel), he falls for her, she
kind of likes him, but of course
things get in the way. But, unlike the
usual fair, "Once" is a musical.
We're not talking about a "West
Side Story" or "Oklahoma" kind of
musical. "Once" gives us a movie
musical for the muted-indie
acoustic-folk crowd. Glen Hansard
siars as the heartbroken singer-song
writer playing on the streets of
Dublin trying to get by on his music,
but has to work in his father's vacu
um repair shop. When not moon
lighting as an actor, Hansard is the
front man for an Irish rock band The

Frames; a band for which Carney
once played bass. Czech vocalist
Marketa Irglova joins Hansard as
the aforementioned girl who sells
roses on the street and plays piano.
The two meet and begin talking
when the girl's Hoover needs some
lixing. She is taken by his evocative
guitar playing. He soon learns that
she plays piano and writes her own
songs. And before you can say C
major, they are making beautiful
music together.
Hansard and Irglova do indeed
sound nice together, both on and off
the screen. In fact, many of the
songs from "Once" can be found on
Hansard's solo album "The Swell
Season" on which the two collabo
rated. In this light, it's hard not to
see the film as a sort of documen
tary of their real story (they are dat
ing in real life as well). Carney's
camera work foregrounds the real
ism of the film. He shoots many
scenes with a hand-held camera cre
ating an almost cinema verite quali
ty. In the opening shot, a junkie
relieves himself in an alley only a
few feet from Hansard singing his

heart out to a gray and gritty Dublin
avenue. The whole film walks a
strange line between its subdued
and mellow realism and the theatri
cality of a musical. It only really
deviates from real life when
Hansard and Irglova burst into full
song in the back of a bus or in the
middle of a piano shop.
This of course is a convention of
musicals; that characters sing irra
tionally and often. In one scene,
Irglova goes into a convenience
store in the middle of the night to
buy batteries so she can listen to
Hansard's demo on her Walkman.
As she walks down the street in her
pajamas and slippers she sings
sweetlv as she thinks of lyrics to his

tunes. It's somewhat unrealistic and
definitely theatrical, but the whole
thing is done so effortlessly that it
has a haunting, transcendental
effect. Her gentle crooning of "If
You Want Me" is somehow as nat
ural as if she humming privately to
herself. In another notable scene,
Irglova and Hansgard go to a party
full of musicians in which everyone
shares a song. Carney's direction is
so gentle and rooted in realism that
the scene lacks any pretense or con

trivance. People sing with such ease
in "Once," thai it suggests our own
lives could be a bit more musical.
"Once" docs fall victim to many
of the cliches of quirky love stories.
Often its suffers from its own mel
lowness and noticably lacks dramat
ic tension. Yet, when Irglova and
Hansgard gel together and play,
they are as rousing and uplifting as a
huge Busby Berkeley number, but
in their own quiet, bittersweet and
acoustic way.

BLIMEY: Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova ponder why Ireland is so
depressing. Good thing there's music and Guinness to dull the pain.
