# CELEBRITY GOSSIP
## PARIS HILTON FINDS GOD!!! 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION STALKERAZZI 
During these three months without dorm
events or frat parties, you may be feeling a lit
tle deprived of gossip. Fortunately, summer is
prime season for celebrity dirt. So read on to
find out who's in, who's out and who's doing
the oP in-out-in-out. (Hint: Jessica Simpson
with just about everyone except John Mayer.)
Christian Bale may be taking the title
"American Psycho" too seriously: For a
scene in his latest film, "Rescue Dawn," he
ate an entire bowlful of live maggots.
Director Werner Herzog told reporters that
he wanted to steer away from CGI animation
of the creepy scene so that audiences would

be able "to believe their eyes again." Um, I
see where you're going with this. Wern, but if
you want to make the movie feel authentic,
why not just shoot the sex scenes for realsies?
Apparently Apple will let just about any
one get on the wait list for their iPhones. This
weekend, Lindsay Lohan was photographed
pretty smugly snuggling up to the haute little
device. Of course, this doesn't make up for the
fact that she's still in rehab, still under investi
gation for her DUI and still hasn't made a hit
movie since 2004. But maybe her wardens will
let her knit a cute little phone cover during
arts and crafts time in her rehab center.
Amy Winchouse is already bored with her.
like. 15 seconds of fame. During a recent inter
view with Spin magazine, the tattooed, heavy
drinking songstress apparently cursed a blue
streak and said she plans on leaving the music
industry in the near future. Then she took a mir
ror shard and carved the phrase "1 love Blake
[Fielder-Civil, her husband|" into her stom
ach—right before the reporter's eyes. Aww, and
they say romance is dead. It's just masochistic.

Michael Jackson's friends and family are
planning an intervention in hopes that it may
save the pop singer's life. Apparently, he has
been using the boring downtime between
felony charges to self-medicate on booze and
anti-depressants. Insiders said they knew he
was plummeting to rock bottom when he was
witnessed vomiting blood. Come on, guys,
let's leave the man be. Frankly, of all the bod
ily fluids that could come out of Michael
Jackson, blood is the one we should be least
concerned about.
Spice Girls fans rejoice! Decade-long
rumors of an official Spice Girls Reunion tour
have finally been confirmed! Unfortunately,
the girls seem to hate each other even more
now than they did when the group broke up in
1998. There has been major behind-the
scenes friction as Geri "Ginger" Halliwell
refuses to make group appearances, Mel
"Scary" Brown consistently runs late to inter
views, and the two no one cares about try to
force-feed Victoria "Posh" Beckham.
Speaking of Mel B, a recent paternity test

confirmed her claims that the father of her
two-month-old child is Eddie Muqihy, despite
his vehement denials of any relationship.
Happy late Father's Day, Eddie, whether you
like it or not. But whatever you do, please
don't star in yet another "Shrek" rehash just to
scrape up the child support.
It's been a tough few weeks for Britney
Spears. The single mom of two has been spot
ted partying hard in L.A., and has publicly
refused support from her own mother, Lynne
Spears. The rift finally became so embittered
that a few days ago, Britney delivered a
restraining order to her mother, who, after
wards, reportedly sat on her trailer steps in
utter shock. Yes, her trailer. I couldn't make
this up if I tried.
Oh, and apparently something happened
with Paris Hilton this week, too. She got out of
prison and then found God while being inter
viewed by Barbara Walters. But honestly, who
even cares anymore? With all the crazy stuff
going down in Hollywood right now, Paris is
actually starting to look somewhat normal.
