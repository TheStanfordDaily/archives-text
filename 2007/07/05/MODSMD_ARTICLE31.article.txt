'Live Free or Die Hard'
Dir. Len Wiseman

Bruce Willis seems to bleed from
the head a great deal. In every one of
these "Die Hard" films, I'm always
shocked by the opening ten minutes
or so because they depict his charac
ter. John McClaine, with a clear com
plexion and looking normal.
Mc( laine's character is always
embodied by a bleeding head that
seems to recall war paint or leaking
machismo. Thankfully, in this film,
he begins to bleed quickly and that
means the action starts early.
In Live Free or Die Hard" (Dir.
I en Wiseman), the anachronistic
cowboy rides again. McClaine origi
nally was the everyman who finds
lumsell in the wrong place at the
wrong time." But in "Live Free" he

seems more like a robotic killing
machine. Did he really need to crash
that car into that helicopter? To coun
teract this uninspired turn, the writers
imbue McClaine with another cliche
premise — self-awareness in the
film's quieter moments. Thankfully,
there aren't too many quiet moments.
Sure, his family again hates him and
that seems like it's a bad thing, but
once again the important thing is he
has to prove how much he loves his
family by killing a lot of people.
For all its over-the-top violence
and explosions, its humorous one-lin
ers and far-fetched plot, the movie
works better than any action film I've
seen in a while. It's funny at points but
doesn't take every pause in the action
to offer dark humor. It's classic action
movie stereotypes but provides a new
challenge for McClaine's traditional

sh(K)t-l'irst approach by setting him
against technology and its excesses.
This time, cyber terrorists (led by
Timothy Olyphant) manage to hack
into the US's most vital security sys
tems and manage to knock out utili
ties, transportation and defense for
almost the entire nation. The only
hackers who arc capable of helping
have been killed off before the open
ing credits are finished, except for
one: the Mac Guy, er Matt Farrell
(Justin Long). Farrell is saved by a
reluctant John McGaine, who now
must escort the frightened nerd to
DC to help save us all. The script fea
tures so many credits (original charac
ter creators were acknowledged) the
plot is unsurprisingly hole-filled.Yet,
you overlook that the film depicts a
US government that doesn't employ
hackers and a US Military that is

helpless against ten men with guns
and a laptop. In order to clear the way
for McClaine and the Mac Guy to
save the day, the writers just kind of
depict the US security forces as a
bunch of five year olds with wooden
swords. This sets up a fantasy world
that paces nicely with a new peril
seemingly every ten minutes.
Farrell, as the emblematic face of
the "Mac Vs. PC" commercials, plays
the poster-child for our web surfing
generation well. He's a bit paranoid,
lacking skin pigment, and obsessed
with action figures, yes, but also apa
thetic, smart and eventually swayed

to the belief that America is worth
saving. His interactions with Willis's
character seem stilted at times, hut
are expected considering the genera
tion gap. One of the funniest juxtapo
sitions is when MGaine busts into
FarrelFs friends' place, the home of
the hacker known as "the Warlock"
(Kevin Smith).
But while Farrell is a nice addition
to the franchise, the reason why the
films have endured is because of
Willis' portrayal of McClaine.
McClaine is, as one villain quips, "a
Timex watch in a digital age." He's a
timeless hero, a cowboy sent once
again to solve the modern problems
of the day, whether they are foreign
mercenaries or cyber terrorists who
know kung fu. In this way, McClaine
is always the hero of the age and
always the in the wrong place at the
wrong time. So let's watch McClaine
take on cyber terrorists, futuristic
planes, and the ennui generation —
he'll kill them all — and with really
cool explosions.
