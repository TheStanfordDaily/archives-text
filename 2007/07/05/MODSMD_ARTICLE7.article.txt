## SPECIAL EVENTS Gioia talks art appreciation to grads 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
About 1.6(X) undergraduate students
received their Stanford degrees on June 17,
and became part of the first graduating
class to hold its Commencement festivities
in the newly renovated Stanford Stadium.
With the blaring sun reflecting onto an
estimated 27,(MX) onlookers.
Commencement speaker Dana Gioia '73,
MBA 77 implored graduates to discover
the value of art over entertainment, as he
delivered a stinging critique of modern
popular culture.
Gioia, the chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, was a surprise
pick to speak at the ceremony. Many stu
dents were upset when administrators
announced his selection in late January.
The poet, who became a businessman
and later a Bush appointee, was quick to
make light of his dark horse status.
"A few students were especially con
cerned that I lacked celebrity status," Gioia
said. "It seemed I wasn't famous enough. 1
couldn't agree more. As I have often told
my wife and children, 'I'm simply not
famous enough.'"
This deadpanned tease received the
biggest laugh of the day, and Gioia used it
as a jump-off point for his critique of popu

lar culture. In contrast to the current
celebrities of the NBA and "American
Idol," the Hawthorne, Calif.-native cited
the popular, intellectual figures of his child
hood, including Robert Frost, Louis
Armstrong and Alfred Kinsey.
"1 don't think Americans were smarter
then," Gioia said of the mid-20th century,
"but American culture was."
He bemoaned the "loss of recognition
for artists, thinkers and scientists" since that
time, which has "impoverished our culture"
— and even politics.
"When a successful guest appearance on
* The Colbert Report' becomes more
important than passing legislation," Gioia
said, "democracy gets scary."
However, he also recognized his own
interest in the "free market," noting that he
worked 15 years as an executive in the food
industry. Gioia also admitted that he adores
his big-screen TV — exemplary of a "soci
ety of unprecedented prosperity."
"But we must remember that the mar
ketplace does only one thing," he added. "It
puts a price on everything."
Gioia told the crowd that "art is an irre
placeable way of understanding and
expressing the world" — a world in which
art itself has been pushed aside by enter
tainment and consumerism.
The poet pointed to education as the

"one social force...strong enough to coun
terbalance this profit-driven commercial
ization." But, he added that with arts edu
cation suffering from budget cuts and the
decisions of "myopic school boards," a
national consensus is needed to revitalize
interest and investment in the arts and sci
ences.
"To compete successfully," Gioia said,
"this country needs continued creativity,
ingenuity and innovation."
This is the job Gioia left to Stanford
graduates. And. before ending with a piece
of his own — a section from his 2(XX) poem
"Autumn Inaugural" —Gioia reminded
students that their intellectual support sys
tem at Stanford is coming to a close.
"And now you face the choice of
whether you want to be a passive consumer
or an active citizen." he said.
Student reaction to the speech was gen
erally positive, according to John Shen '07.
With Gioia having admitted his non
celebrity status early on. many students
were more comfortable with what he later
said.
"I was moved by the fact he wasn't
afraid to say that he was less well known
than other speakers," Shen said. "He was
really humble about his orinins — like his

mixed heritage and the fact that he's
a first-generation student; I think a
lot of people can relate to that."
Gioia's speech followed the seem
ingly incongruous Wacky Walk, in
which graduates make a spectacle on
their way across the football field.
The traditional "walk" — long con
sidered a highlight of the ceremony
— saw individual students with
handmade signs, groups carrying
oversized caterpillars and re-enact
ments of the trek up Palm Drive.
President John Hennessy noted
after the walk that the continuation

of such traditions was important in
the 116 th Commencement, as was the
beginning of new ones in the lives of
the graduates and Stanford.
But the June 17 ceremony was
only one of several events to com
memorate graduation, which
included smaller departmental
graduation ceremonies, senior din
ners and parties in the nights
before. After the main ceremony
in the stadium, students, friends and
family members flooded campus as
receptions were held, flowers and
balloons were handed out and pic
tures were taken.
1,597 undergraduate students
received Gioia's challenge to engage
the arts. 1,644 bachelor's degrees were
awarded, along with 2,085 master's
degrees and 968 doctoral degrees.
