## BP gives $7.5 million to University 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
The University announced last
week that the BP Foundation has
pledged a five-year grant worth
$7.5 million toward the Program
on Energy and Sustainable
Development. The donation from
the BP Foundation — funded by
energy giant BP — will aid the
study of modern energy markets.
"BP's support has allowed our
program to study the world's
most pressing energy problems,
such as global warming, energy
poverty and the prospects for the
world oil market," said Law Prof.
David Victor, who is the director
of the program.
"In addition to BP Foundation
support, we learn from BP's
experience as an energy compa
ny," he added. "They operate in
all the markets where we do
research — such as in China and
India."
The BP grant announcement
comes a little more than a month
after Stanford took considerable
criticism for accepting as much as
$100 million from ExxonMobil

for climate and energy research.
Ties to ExxonMobil drew crit
icism from alumni and prompted
notable donor Steve Bing '87 to
rescind a planned $2.5 million gift
to the University in March; Bing
also announced that he would no
longer donate to Stanford.
