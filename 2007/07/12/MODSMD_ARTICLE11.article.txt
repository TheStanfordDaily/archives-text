# The
						last man to know everything

Everything is a big word. It
means, well, everything.
Despite this fact (or maybe
because of it) there's a great deal of
competition to claim the title of this
week's column for one's favorite
intellectual.
Some quick work on Google
gives a list of names from the well
known to the delightfully obscure.
Milton. Young. Mill. Kircher (no, I
have no idea who Kircher is either,
but apparently he perfected the
Aeolian harp — again, no idea).
Aristotle. Jefferson. And so on.
While debating the relative mer
its of the above can provide hours of
entertainment on a rainy Sunday
afternoon (really, you haven't expe
rienced intellectual bliss until you've
extensively discussed the likely out
come of an Aristotle vs. Jefferson
Death Match), I am more interested
in the one point of agreement
between supporters of different his
torical celebrities: No one knows
everything anymore.
(Well, actually, I'd be inclined to
say that most people don't know
anything at all —but the general
idiocy of myself, my friends and
everyone else on the planet can wait
for some other time.)
The reason given for the absence
of Renaissance men and women
from our society is that knowledge is
too vast. No one mind could possi
bly comprehend the details of every
subject. And, even if it could, there
are not enough days in a lifetime to
accumulate the knowledge.

The generalists are no more:
Welcome to the age of specializa
tion.
With the reality of the situation
comes the inevitable over-enthusias
tic acceptance of the Zeitgeist.
Generalism is more than dead — it's
derisible. It may be the case that
condemnation of broad but shallow
knowledge is not universal, but it is
certainly a commonly implied belief
in academic circles. Experts are so
ready to dismiss the opinion of any
one who does not share in their
expertise that it is all but impossible
to maintain a breadth of knowledge.
1 tind this troubling on a number
of different levels — not least of
which is that I treasure my elemen
tary school status as a know-it-all,
and wish dearly that 1 could main
tain that reputation now that I'm
(slightly more) grown up.
On a more philosophical note,
specialization devalues intellect
itself. One of the great joys of learn
ing is the application of your newly
acquired knowledge to diverse top
ics — to take the conclusions of one
argument and apply them to other
situations is the essence of using
knowledge, rather than simply
acquiring it.
It's not, might I add, that poly

maths don't exists; it's just that
they're not taken very seriously. To
be more precise, their polymathe
matics is not given much value. We
afford multiple talents a similar sort
of acknowledgement as we do
celebrity — it's impressive, it's cool
and we'd like to sleep with it, but we
don't value it as being particularly
useful.
(A brief aside. Yes, I know I'm
not offering any evidence, but hon
estly, evidence takes too much effort
to accumulate.)
Even if you managed to escape
the intellectual stigma, it would still
be virtually impossible to be a seri
ous generalist. Learning is rarely
presented in an accessible form —
the exposition of knowledge tends
to occupy the extremes, either
dumbed down beyond recognition
or requiring years of initiation into
the mysteries before understanding
can come.
Leaving the sociology of general
ity and drifting back to the alleged
impossibility of knowing everything,
I think, even here, I have my doubts.
Of course, you can't know every
thing. Everything is, as pointed out
above, a lot. But I don't see why you
can't be superficially conversant in
everything. I'd even argue that
should you achieve that cursory,
shallow knowledge, you're doing as
well as Kircher ever did.
After all, we live in a world ot
ever expanding intellectual achieve
