# Holt's Harangue
## "Man vs. Wild" vs. underpants sunhat 
### 
Man vs. Wild is my new addic
tion. Its host. Bear Grylls,
forcibly strands and then
informatively rescues himself from
such remote locations as the Moab
Desert, the middle of the Australian
outback, and the forests of Wilfred
Brimley's mustache.
A camera crew follows him
around and tapes his exploits but
only intervenes when he is seriously
in danger. Otherwise they just laugh
their heads off as he forces himself
to drink animal byproducts, wear his
undergarments as hats, and make
crude shelters out of his own tears.
The crew, meanwhile, carries
around harp-seal powered air condi
tioners.
The crew doesn't laugh that hard,
however, because in order to sur
vive, Bear Grylls ate his previous
film crew.
But he makes no mention of this
as he soberly explains to the audi
ence that most snakes in the
Australian outback can be killed
and eaten if one needs to survive.
He keeps assuring us his main rea
son for doing these ludicrous things
is because of his need for "survival."
This resembles the "self-preserva
tion" instinct of most humans,
except it includes a fat check from
Discovery Channel.

So he cites "survival" as the rea
son why he's tackled the bison,
smeared its blood on his face and
declared himself the God of
Leopards.
You overlook the fact that when
presented with a difficult situation,
and while repeating his need to sur
vive, he will always choose the path
that presents the most danger.
"Well, there's a really treacherous
cliff with sharp rocks that I can climb
to get down to the valley floor. Or 1
can walk 50 feet and take this well
worn path. The cliff it is." No matter
how many times the college kids yell
at the TV screen, he'll always choose
the path with the sharp pointy rocks
or the poisonous trees or the subze
ro quicksand. He has the survival
instinct of a slutty teenager in a
Jason film.
If you can watch this show with
out identifying with this man, you
are probably not a human. You are
probably a relative of one the many
endangered species he feasts on
every show. The show's format basi
cally involves him wandering
through some pristine deserted
wilderness. Occasionally, the cam
era will pan to a beautiful and rare
animal that is native to this land.
Whenever the camera highlights an
animal, you are fairly certain that

this man will sneak up on it, beat its
head in, and then lecture you on its
nutrition value. I encourage the
viewer to explore some of these des
olate places soon before the next
season starts and more local species
become extinct. This leads me to
believe that there is no thing as nat
ural selection, just animals that
haven't met Bear Grylls.
Despite all of this, what's great
about this show is that you can
relate to him. When he tells you, in
his accent, that he's removing his
underpants to make a nice sunhat, it
makes you want to offer your own.
You begin to believe that you too
could survive a similar situation, if
only you had his trusty belt of
kitchen spices.
Many college students watch
Man vs. Wild. We watch it because
Grylls is essentially reaffirming our
fears of what the world is like: terri
ble parties, not a bar in sight and
you're wearing your underpants on
your head and you don't know how
you got there. He is, we think, teach

ing us real-worlu skills. Perhaps we
will not he dropped in a temperate
forest with nothing but our favorite
frisbee to fight off panda bears.
Perhaps we will merely have to nav
igate job interviews, networking,
dating and, yes, surviving in this new
world.
Just this past week 1 had a job
interview in L A. at a literary firm.
I faced the brutal deserts of dry
humor, the oppressive heat of
inspection and, yes, poisonous
questions regarding my resume.
But, having learned quite a deal
from Man vs. Wild, 1 was prepared.
1 could survive. They told me they
were looking for someone more
qualified, and then asked if I had
any experience working in the
entertainment industry as a talent
agent. 1 told them that if one need
ed to survive, most snakes could be
cooked and eaten in the
Austrialian outback. They thanked
me for my time, and 1 knew that as
I shook the interviewer's hands, he
wasn't staring at the eyes of an
unconfident college grad. He was
staring jealously at my underpants
sunhat.

Chris doesn t have anything funny to
say in this space. Send complaints to
