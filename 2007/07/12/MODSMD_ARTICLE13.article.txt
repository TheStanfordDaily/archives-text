## Midwest to Far East: The Amazonian city of lights 
### 
Igrew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Long since past its heyday, a time
when German butchers chris
tened it "Porkopolis," the town
stands today as a pillar of conserva
tivism holding up a mighty, corn
covered Midwestern temple. 1
wouldn't particularly recommend it,
unless you are over 60 years old
and/or have a gun rack on your
Hummer.
Yet, as much as I might want to
shake the moniker, 1 am a
Midwesterner. Driving far enough
northward, you notice my home
town begin to merge with cornfield.
I speak slowly sometimes, and some
part of me wants in all situations to
uphold the status quo. The rampant
gossip inherent in the hen-like
Midwestern social circles finds echo
in my Instant Messenger conversa
tions. Not to mention, I own a pair
of overalls or two.
It is from this perspective that I
approach the Republic of China. I
arrived several nights ago, scarred
mentally and physically by 19
straight hours of travel.
How did I end up here? In the
end, I don't really know. I have
learned Chinese since I was in
kindergarten — a bright-eyed little
white boy with an inability to tie my
shoes and only a tiny inkling of
where China was on a map. My par
ents had enrolled my brother and
me into a foreign language elemen
tary school, a result of my father's
sinophilia. And given the fact that

the population of Ohio is 0.4 percent
Chinese, I was learning a language
that seemed kind of useless at the
time. While the other kids went to
summer camps with fake Native-
American inspired names, I spent
my summers learning Chinese in a
Minnesota Mandarin immersion
camp.
Now, here I am, in a Shanghai
hotel, breathing air of sub-optimal
quality and reading Wikipedia arti
cles about how to use Eastern-style
toilets. I'm in China for the next
eight weeks, teaching children,
whose parents have loads of dispos
able income, how to take the
American SAT.
My first stop: Shanghai. Though I
have been here for only two days, I
think I've got the place figured out:
Shanghai is an odd combination of
Las Vegas and the Amazon rainfor
est. Neon lights assault the viewer
from every conceivable angle, seem
ingly serving no other purpose than
to color the walls of my hotel room
24 hours a day. At times, Shanghai
may even outdo the "City of Lights"
in terms of flamboyance, despite the
fact that gambling is illegal here and
these signs are mostly illuminating
not-so-exceptional stores. Every
shop with a staff larger than two
people has deemed it necessary to
adorn its storefront with overly illu
minated Chinese characters.
The rainforest portion of the
Shanghai identity is painfully appar
ent the second you step off of the

plane. The city feels as if there is a
large, sweaty man breathing on you
at all times. The average humidity
level hovers around 90 percent and
the temperature is usually in the
high 80s (Fahrenheit). Fairly fre
quently, the man spits: It rains daily,
and even when it doesn't, it mists.
One tourism website 1 visited notes
playfully, "you might want to bring
along a personal fan!" Yet this fails
to acknowledge that personal fans
are powerless in the face of oppres
sive humidity.
While Shanghai may not be host
to such exotic beings as the spider
monkey and the macaw, it does
indeed have the exotic closet-sized
used sock store (50 cents for six
socks!...not like I would know or
anything) and the black market
bootleg shops with the overly grab
by attendants. As a sidenote: When
I entered one of these shops yester
day, one of the shop attendants
screamed, "White man! White man!
Buy polos to make nice look for
sexy girl".
Shanghai certainly does have a
local flavor to it. The locals take
pride in their eating establishments,
numerous and delicious. My second
day here, I purchased a duck head

and, I think, a large, red, duck
sausage. Ordering the head was actu
ally an accident — 1 was speaking
through a small hole roughly five
inches in diameter and the woman
mistook my wish for "duck leg" (a
drumstick, I had hoped) with "duck
head" — but the resulting cranium
was actually not so bad. Yesterday
afternoon, I ate the Chinese equiva
lent of popcorn chicken — a dish
than can only be described as pop
corn claws, chewy little morsels laced
with the bones from chicken feet.
Bootleg stores abound, selling
pre-theater releases, American box
office films and, oddly, a large num
ber of nature documentaries.
Perhaps the best part of these stores
is the Chinese slapstick comedy
movies, whose covers feature make
up laden cross-dressing old men sur
rounded by a large number of con
fused-looking women suitors.
And this is China. From the
Midwest to the Far East, I have made
the journey of a lifetime. I expect in
the weeks to come to see new sights,
hear new sounds and taste new fla
vors. This is truly only the beginning.
To quote the great Natasha
Bedingfield, whose CD I saw at the
store down the street, "The rest is still
unwritten!"
