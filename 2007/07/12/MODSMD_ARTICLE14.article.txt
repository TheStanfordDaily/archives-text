## A
						new Old Union opens its doors Building will house ASSU, community centers, dining 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
It's official: Old Union is new again.
The construction portion of the project was
completed last week, and the student groups
and offices housed there have already moved
into their new digs. The building needs some
final touches — such as signage and window
treatments — but is set for a fall quarter grand
opening.
All of Old Union, including the eatery, will
be ready for a grand opening during the week
of Sept. 25, according to Director of Tresidder
Meeting Services Jeanette Smith-Laws.
Smith-Laws said that the ASSU, Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE), the Asian-
American Activities Center, the Native
American Center, the Center for Religious
Life, the Office of Student Activities, El Centro
Chicano and The Chaparral have all relocated
to the new building.
Old Union will also house a new campus
eatery, open late on weekends, in which stu
dents will be able to use dining points. The as
yet unnamed eatery will be open Monday
through Thursday 8 a.m. to 1 a.m., Friday 8 a.m.
to 2 a.m., Saturday 12 p.m. to 2 a.m. and Sunday
12 p.m. to 1 a.m. Its theme and name will be
finalized at a meeting next week.
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 said
that he expected the Old Union eatery to be an
important new space on campus next year.
"The new eatery will be an amazing place
for students to come relax, enjoy a meal and
meet with their peers," he said.
The recently vacated spaces in Tresidder
Union which used to house the ASSU and
other student spaces are also being reexamined.
"We are taking this opportunity to evaluate
how Tresidder can become a better space," said
Smith-Laws. "Tresidder will balance retail and
administrative space as well as meeting rooms."
ASSU Vice-President Mondaire Jones '09

said he "loves" the new ASSU office — though
it is physically smaller than old Tresidder office,
Jones championed visibility over square
footage.
"Our main desire for the new office," Jones
said, "was that students would he able to see it
and feel free to drop in to chat about anything
they wanted."

Avula also hoped that students would take
advantage of the meeting rooms of varying size
and function along with the Old Union
Courtyard while studying, meeting for groups
and clubs and hanging out.
But the practical advantages of the new
building are not its only assets, according to
Smith-Laws.

"When we were moving in the Native
American Center, everyone was moved by how
beautiful the center is." Smith-Laws said.
"When students get back on campus, that's
what's going to give it energy. I think it's going
to be the real jewel of campus."
