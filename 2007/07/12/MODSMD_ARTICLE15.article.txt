## ME building plan pushes ahead 2009 structure approved by Trustees 
### SALONE KAPUR 
The plan for a new $12.7 million
mechanical engineering building
was approved by the Board of
Trustees last month, following more
than a year of planning and debate.
ITie building will be situated on
the east side of Lomita Mall, between
Panama Mall and Santa Teresa
Street — conveniently located adja
cent to the existing Mechanical
Engineering Research Laboratory.
Mechanical Engineering Dept.
Chair Fritz Prinz said the new build
ing's approval comes after many
months of discussion about the
plan's financial feasibility.
"It has been a slow process," he said.
"We have been planning this project
for the past year and a half at least.
As with any major decision, there

were intense debates over many
aspects of the plan, such as whether
it was cost-effective."
The three-story building will
house faculty, staff and student
offices, as well as laboratories, con
ference rooms and collaborative
spaces. Though the design will incor
porate new courtyards, it will also
ensure that the large Chinese elm
already in the area is preserved.
Prinz said the new building will
fulfill the needs of the mechanical
engineering department, which is
currently crunched for space in the
Durand Building.
"The engineering departments
are undergoing transformations in
all their facilities," he said. " There
was a big need to consolidate and
create more space for the people in
ME Department, who are currently
living in cramped quarters in
Durand."
Prinz was confident about the
benefits of the new building.
"1 don't see any negative conse

quences or setbacks involved with
this project at all," he said. "This
movement will bring two groups in
ME — mechanics and biomedical
— together, creating incredible
intellectual synergies. Additionally,
the building will incorporate the lat
est energy-efficient architecture and
technology."
As a result of the construction.
The Storke Student Publications
Building — which currently houses
The Daily —as well the adjacent
Building 630, will be demolished.
Prinz said that he and the plan
ning committee do not foresee any
delays in the mechanical engineer
ing building's construction schedule.
The project will return to the Board
of Trustees for design approval in
October, project approval next
February and construction approval
next June. The building should be
completed by December 2009.
