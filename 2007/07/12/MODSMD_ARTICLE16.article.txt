## SCRL talks solar panels 
### KATHLEEN RYOU 
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders (SCRL) hopes to woo
President John Hennessy as well as
other faculty and staff as it pushes
its solar panel campaign. The orga
nization is urging Stanford commu
nity members to install photovoltaic
panels on their in order to
lower the University's carbon foot
print.
If SCRL — which has partnered
with solar panel design and installa
tion company Solar City — rounds
up enough supporters within a 15-
mile radius, homeowners will benefit
from a 20 percent group discount.
Coupled with state and federal
rebates, the net installation price
could range from $20,(XX) $50,000 —
about half the market price.
"If the threshold (for the dis
count! were met, we could offset a
million pounds of carbon over the
next 20 to 30 years," said Mary-Lou
Zoback, the project's chair.

But time is running out for SCRL.
Even with the extension of the dis
count deadline from next week to
Sept. 28, Zoback said the program,
which was launched in mid-May, is
still having trouble meeting the new
deadline due to The panels' high cost.
Zoback has not lost hope. She
claimed that Hennessy has
expressed some interest in
installing a solar panel system in his
home, potentially putting his stamp
of approval on the initiative. She
also said that if the Stanford
Campus Recreation Association
agreed to install solar panels on top
of its pool and tennis club, SCRL
would be 50 kilowatts closer to its
goal of installing 175 kilowatts
worth of panels.
According to Zoback, however.
SCRL will need about 50 more
homes to sign on to the initiative if
these efforts fail.
