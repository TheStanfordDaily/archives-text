## SPECIAL EVENTS World-class soccer visits the Farm Chelsea challenges Club America in Saturday's Disney Friendship Cup 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
After a long hiatus, the "other"
football will finally return to
Stanford Stadium at 6 p.m. on
Saturday.
English powerhouse Chelsea FC
will take on 14-time Mexican cham
pion Club America in the Disney
Friendship Cup this weekend.
Stanford Stadium has been used for
occasional Major League Soccer
games in the past, but it has not host
ed international teams since the
1994 World Cup and the 1999
Women's World Cup.
Chelsea is sure to be a big attrac

tion for soccer fans in the Bay Area.
The "Blues" have spent a lot of
money over the last four years to
attract world-class players, and their
lineup reflects that. In addition to
English stars John Terry and Frank
Lampard, Chelsea boasts an impres
sive array of foreign talent, including
former European Player of the Year
Andrei Shevchenko and current
African Player of the Year Didier
Drogha. New arrival Florent
Malouda, who just signed his con
tract this week, might make an
appearance as well.
"We are bringing our full squad,
including new players," Chelsea
coach Jose Mourinho said. "So, fans
in America will have the chance to
see some very good matches."
In spite of Chelsea's fearsome
lineup. Club America will hardly be
a pushover; the Mexican team won
the North American club champi

onship in 2006 and finished third at
the World Club Cup later last year.
Chelsea's star power is not the
only obstacle the Mexican team will
have to overcome, however. A few
of Club America's usual starters,
including goalkeeper Guillermo
Ochoa, are currently playing with
their national teams at the South
American championships, while
Paraguayan forward Salvador
Cabanas was just knocked out of the
tournament and might opt to rest
rather than play on Saturday.
Chelsea is making a preseason
tour of the U.S. for the fourth
straight summer as part of a contin
uing effort to build a global fan base.
Club America is also no stranger to
summer visits to its northern neigh
bor; last August, the team battled
Spanish-side FC Barcelona to a 4-4
tie in Houston.
Coming off last fall's renovations.

the new Stanford Stadium will get its
first taste of world-class soccer since
the 19905, when it hosted eventual
World Cup champion Brazil three
times. Sweden and Romania also
played a quarterfinal match in the
1994 tournament at The Farm.
More recently, the U.S. women's
national team beat Brazil at
Stanford Stadium to advance to the
1999 Women's World Cup final.
After the game against Club
America, Chelsea will head south to
Los Angeles to play the Suwon
Bluewings (from South Korea) on
July 17 before squaring off against
Major League Soccer's Los Angeles
Galaxy on July 21, in what is widely
expected to be English star David
Beckham's first match with his new
American club.
