## Wiggins rules World Championships, U.S. golden 
### 
Candice Wiggins is on top of the world now.
The junior guard helped lead the Under-21 USA
Women's Basketball team to a gold medal at the

FIBA U2l World Championships in Moscow,
Russia this past week.
After a tight, 90-88 win over Australia in pool
play, the American women faced off against the
Aussies again on Monday in the championship
match. This time it was a much easier, 96-73 win
for the Americans.
One of five scorers in double figures for the
U.S., Wiggins netted 14 points on the night. The
Americans led from the start, opening the game
on a 15-3 run; by halftime the U.S. had a 15-point
lead.
While the U.S. led by as many as 19 points
with 10 minutes to play, defensive slip-ups late in
the game let the Aussies back in the contest, as
they pulled within eight points. The American
women used a 10-0 run, however, to secure the
gold in the final minutes.
The win followed an 86-61 semifinal victory
over host Russia in which Wiggins scored 27
points in 22 minutes; she was 4-for-6 from the
three-point line. Despite a 13-0 surge by the
Russians to start the game, Wiggins helped bring
the U.S. back and led the squad to the final.
