# Kicking MLS up a notch
## 
### 
A joke going around the foot
ball circles goes, "Why do so
many American kids play
soccer? So they don't have to watch
it." Soccer may be a huge pastime
for America's youth, but it's beyond
question that at the pro level the
sport is just not getting it done.
And it's an item of concern to
many people. Every time the World
Cup comes around, a pack of front
runners gets swept up and wags fin
gers at the United States' penchant
for sports not called soccer.
These sports arguments invari
ably become political arguments —
America doesn't want to play with
the rest of the world; Americans
aren't patient enough to appreciate
the game; if only we had kicked the
futbol around with Uncle Nikita in
Moscow, we could have bagged the
whole Cold War and he never would
have taken his shoe off.
This is all typically overheated
rhetoric. Soccer is officially called
"association football" and has no
more natural claim to the name
"football" than the American or
Canadian varieties. The patience
charge is easily falsifiable, though —
this is a country where tens of thou
sands of fans pack a baseball stadi
um to watch a pitchers' duel where
four guys might get on base.
Of course, there's a difference:
Every time a pitch is thrown, there's
a chance for some action. At the
highest level, a soccer game might go
90 minutes without even a real shot
on goal.
1 he archetypal image of pro soc
cer to the average American must
consist of avowed metrosexual
David Beckham (bending more than
the ball) ripping his shirt off and
inciting violent mobs, while a broad
caster shouts "GOOOOOOOAL"
for five minutes. As the hooligans
trash the stadium, Beckham head
butts an opponent who insulted
Posh Spice — a campy, amalgamat
ed stew of Europe's strangest
images.
It's a shame that the World Cup,
virtually a glorified all-star tourna
ment, brings out the worst in the
game rather than the best —own-
goals, scoreless games, a team flop
ping its way to the top and an MVP
who got himself ejected from the


Topher
Anderson
biggest game of the year because he
couldn't keep his temper under con
trol.
If you claim to simply dislike soc
cer, the insecurity rages and you're
lectured on how it is the world's
game, how it's the real "football"
and we should embrace it to help the
national image.
Soccer as broccoli. Wonderful.
The situation must be all the more
humiliating now that we've taken to
watching poker on television.
The European soccer ethos has
still found a way to invade American
sports — by exporting otherwise
sound basketball players famous for
their flopping. (Vlade Divac is the
punchline example.)
The national attempt at a profes
sional league. Major League Soccer,
registers below the NHL on the
American radar screen. Considering
the southern part of the country is
almost completely dissociated from
ice hockey, that says something.
Seems Americans don't turn out
unless they're videotaping their own
child's game. Still, MLS and its
advocates could use some tweaks to
help itself out.
First, they should accept that it's
never going to be "the only sport."
With the exception of some British
Commonwealth countries (more on
that below), most of the developed

world puts soccer at the top, supple
mented by a healthy, but lower, dose
of tennis, cycling or basketball.
America's economy and taste are
both diverse enough to support sev
eral professional sports leagues and
a vast array of middle- and high
school sports offerings (including
soccer), publicly funded through the
school systems. It'll never be a sin
gle-sport country and the singular
glory of soccer just ain't happening
here.
Second, change the wannabe-for
eign names of some teams. Outside
vocabulary (draw, nil, kit, side) may
be one thing, but teams named Real
Salt Lake (Is there such a thing as
fake salt?) and DC United (United
from what?) are classic examples of
imitating success while marketing to
the wrong crew.
MLS may be trying for the exot
ic, but the league's misguided
attempts support the idea that
they're selling someone else's prod
uct, not their own. People already
with a taste for international soccer
aren't going to be further turned by
a fake, English-style club name. The
soccer-crazy Hispanic market is
growing, but they're in the fold
already; middle-class white and
black America is the crowd that
needs to be sold.
That being said, avoiding the
conventional American sports para
digm is not necessarily a bad thing
— from steroids in baseball to the
NFL's continuing homogenization

to "me-first" NBA showboating and
an NHL that can't keep its shirt on
straight, we could use a change in
attitude.
MLS is not a movement of out
side investors — the late Lamar
Hunt, a football tycoon who was
seminal in the rise of the NFL, was a
strong advocate of pro soccer. Thus
it is all the more perplexing why this
group of successful American busi
nesspeople can't get their league to
stick.
Perhaps Americans are saturat
ed. With so many NFL games being
decided by field goals, maybe
Americans have seen enough kick
ing lor a year by the end of January.
For example, the NFL tried to tap
the Mexican market by holding a
20()5 game in Mexico City; the game
was very well attended.
Interestingly, the tilt between the
Cardinals and 49ers featured six
field goals and only two touch
downs.
Regardless, Australia, rather
than Europe, might be a more sensi
ble model for American soccer
advocates. The Aussies devour not
one, but four types of football —
two varieties of rugby, soccer and an
endemic form called Australian
Rules Football — to go along with
world dominance in cricket and a
cyclist who is currently one of the
best in the world. Absent the
American salary structure, the
Aussies also have a refreshing dis
like of self-absorbed athletes and

manage regional (intra-state donny
brooks in footy) and international
(New Zealand, South Africa and
England in rugby) rivalries with
grace and passion. In this sphere,
soccer coexists peacefully with
more-popular national sports.
The American palate could prob
ably use a heightened sense of inter
nationalism in sport. Simply shoving
in another country's game, however,
is not the way to develop it.

Christopher I'. Anderson thinks that
crazy European image just got worse
with the Spire Girls reuniting. If you
agree and J ear for David Beckham, let
him blow at cpaiiders@stanford.edu.

attempts support the idea that
they're selling someone else's prod
uct, not their own. People already
with a taste for international soccer
aren't going to be further turned by
a fake, English-style club name. The
soccer-crazy Hispanic market is
growing, but they're in the fold
already; middle-class white and
black America is the crowd that
needs to be sold.
That being said, avoiding the
conventional American sports para
digm is not necessarily a bad thing
— from steroids in baseball to the
NFL's continuing homogenization

to "me-first" NBA showboating and
an NHL that can't keep its shirt on
straight, we could use a change in
attitude.
MLS is not a movement of out
side investors — the late Lamar
Hunt, a football tycoon who was
seminal in the rise of the NFL, was a
strong advocate of pro soccer. Thus
it is all the more perplexing why this
group of successful American busi
nesspeople can't get their league to
stick.
Perhaps Americans are saturat
ed. With so many NFL games being
decided by field goals, maybe
Americans have seen enough kick
ing lor a year by the end of January.
For example, the NFL tried to tap
the Mexican market by holding a
20()5 game in Mexico City; the game
was very well attended.
Interestingly, the tilt between the
Cardinals and 49ers featured six
field goals and only two touch
downs.
Regardless, Australia, rather
than Europe, might be a more sensi
ble model for American soccer
advocates. The Aussies devour not
one, but four types of football —
two varieties of rugby, soccer and an
endemic form called Australian
Rules Football — to go along with
world dominance in cricket and a
cyclist who is currently one of the
best in the world. Absent the
American salary structure, the
Aussies also have a refreshing dis
like of self-absorbed athletes and

manage regional (intra-state donny
brooks in footy) and international
(New Zealand, South Africa and
England in rugby) rivalries with
grace and passion. In this sphere,
soccer coexists peacefully with
more-popular national sports.
The American palate could prob
ably use a heightened sense of inter
nationalism in sport. Simply shoving
in another country's game, however,
is not the way to develop it.

Christopher I'. Anderson thinks that
crazy European image just got worse
with the Spire Girls reuniting. If you
agree and J ear for David Beckham, let
him blow at cpaiiders@stanford.edu.
