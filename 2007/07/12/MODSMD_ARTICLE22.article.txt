# Kicking MLS up a notch

A joke going around the foot
ball circles goes, "Why do so
many American kids play
soccer? So they don't have to watch
it." Soccer may be a huge pastime
for America's youth, but it's beyond
question that at the pro level the
sport is just not getting it done.
And it's an item of concern to
many people. Every time the World
Cup comes around, a pack of front
runners gets swept up and wags fin
gers at the United States' penchant
for sports not called soccer.
These sports arguments invari
ably become political arguments —
America doesn't want to play with
the rest of the world; Americans
aren't patient enough to appreciate
the game; if only we had kicked the
futbol around with Uncle Nikita in
Moscow, we could have bagged the
whole Cold War and he never would
have taken his shoe off.
This is all typically overheated
rhetoric. Soccer is officially called
"association football" and has no
more natural claim to the name
"football" than the American or
Canadian varieties. The patience
charge is easily falsifiable, though —
this is a country where tens of thou
sands of fans pack a baseball stadi
um to watch a pitchers' duel where
four guys might get on base.
Of course, there's a difference:
Every time a pitch is thrown, there's
a chance for some action. At the
highest level, a soccer game might go
90 minutes without even a real shot
on goal.
1 he archetypal image of pro soc
cer to the average American must
consist of avowed metrosexual
David Beckham (bending more than
the ball) ripping his shirt off and
inciting violent mobs, while a broad
caster shouts "GOOOOOOOAL"
for five minutes. As the hooligans
trash the stadium, Beckham head
butts an opponent who insulted
Posh Spice — a campy, amalgamat
ed stew of Europe's strangest
images.
It's a shame that the World Cup,
virtually a glorified all-star tourna
ment, brings out the worst in the
game rather than the best —own-
goals, scoreless games, a team flop
ping its way to the top and an MVP
who got himself ejected from the
