## ALBUM REVIEW SIR RICHARD BISHOP: "While My Guitar Violently Bleeds" 
### SCOTT COOMES INTERMISSION KZSI CONTRIBUTOR 
Sir Richard Bishop, guitarist of
the Sun City Girls, released the
instrumental album "While My
Guitar Violently Bleeds" last month.
The title's variation from the song it
references seems far from incidental;
Charles Gocher, drummer of Sun
City Girls, passed away in February,
leaving behind bandmates Richard
and Alan Bishop. This album marks
Bishop's first release since the band's
end. Although the material was
recorded prior to Gocher's death,
the title contextualizes the music as a
bold form of mourning. While the
emotions on the album range widely,
from the tense dread of "Zurvan" to
the chaos of "Smashana", this is an
unmistakably dark release.
Listening to a guitar album
requires a different sort of listening
than when hearing a full band; the
guitar must simultaneously evoke an
ego or a protagonist as well as the
world that this personality inhabits.
Sometimes these elements might

only be felt as an absence; a spare
melody will feel lost with no sound
bed and the listener will cling to any
suggestion of a melody amidst layers
of ambient saturation.
Bishop plays games with the
landscapes and personalities of his
compositions, making "While My
Guitar Gently Bleeds" a disorient
ing experience. As the album cover
hints, this music is a masterful self
annihilation, terrifying in its graceful
and single-minded drive towards the
destruction of its own narrative.
Melodies wander just long enough
to hint at a structure, before veering
off into unexpected directions. All
that lingers from these teasing ven
tures are the formless emotions they
elicit. Bishop's melodic figures leave
the listener stranded, by pulling him
or her into certain moods and then
dissolving without offering an
escape. Perhaps this is how the
album captures the mourning that
its title both references and denies.
The flamenco-tinged "Zurvan"
begins the album with two minutes
of dramatic guitar quotes, suspend
ing the formation of the narrative for

a good while. Bishop then trans
forms these figures into a more orga
nized composition; Hurries of notes
gradually increase in intensity, and
return to the same dissonant cadence
just often enough to draw these frag
ments together.
"Smashana" consists of disorient
ing, hut hypnotic, guitar squeals on
top of a lush bed of ambient howls
and echoes. This track veers towards
drone-like boredom, so it perhaps
serves best as a bridge between the
two more interesting pieces.
Bishop transitions out of the tur
bulence of "Smashana" with
"Mahavidya". At first, this twenty
five minute piece seems just as dis
orienting. although much more
friendly; the squeals and blasts of
ambience soften, as Bishop per
forms playful acoustic guitar frag
ments above undulating tambura
buzzes. Like in the album's first half.
Bishop delivers a series of dramatic
melodic figures that only cohere in
their mood, rather than as a pro
gression. The problematic melodic
fragments, however, reveal a shade
of joy missing from the rest of the

album. The listener is still subjected
to the same brutality and wandering
emotions, but Bishop turns this aim
less violence into a triumph.
Across its forty-three minutes,
Bishop's release lacks a narration
and closure that one might hope to
find within a statement of grief.
Nonetheless Bishop still can manip
ulate the emotional tones of his

songs through his melodic frag
ments. Without sacrificing its blind
fury and chaos, the album eventually
achieves happiness while finding nei
ther peace nor resolution. The
length of the tracks may make this
album a bit difficult to access, but
with serious attention. "While My
Guitar Violently Bleeds" proves to
be a striking listen.
