## Grand Theft Wagon 
### BRANDON SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION COWBOY 
From the makers of "Grand Theft Auto" (GTA) comes this
new addition to the series. "Grand Theft Wagon" (GTW) uses
the classic gameplay of GTA and updates it with a throwback to
the days of Oregon Trail. Game Designer Kawasaki Hitachi
Montezuma calls the game "a revolution in concept, like sliced
bread, or cold fusion." Obviously high praise â€” but does the
game live up to expectations? 1 was able to get a sneak preview
of the game and play a beta version, and let me tell you: I never
knew the West was this wild.
In GTW, you play as either Renegade Bull, the Native
American teen just trying to get by on his humble land and pro
tect it from the ruthless expansionist invaders, or Loco Jose, a
small-time bandito trying to make it big by recapturing Texas for
Mexico. Like in all games in the GTA franchise, these crazy teens
get points by scoring some hits of peyote, smoking the peace pipe,
and, naturally, rockin' the wagon with some hot white harlots.
The gameplay itself is incredible. Montezuma learned a les
son from Oregon Trail and gave the people what they wanted:
realism. As a loner out on the hot and dry plains, it becomes a
real task to actually hunt for food. Unlike in the Oregon Trail
counterpart, the buffalo move faster than .2 miles per hour, and
they charge at you. For once, gathering food is as risky as killing
a policeman. Beyond this. GTW has added perks, such as the
ability to contract dysentery, gangrene and if you sleep with the
right prostitute, syphilis. And this is just the beginning.
GTA offers the gamer the ability to wield automatic rifles
and other assorted deadly weapons. In GTW, the Bowie knife
and lasso are your best friends, and if you're lucky, you can steal
a pistol or a shotgun from someone. But be careful, because
unlike in GTA, one gunshot to the head will kill you. and these
wild-westerners have something you don't: automatic aim. They
practice their quick draw, and the wagon-riders who sit shotgun
REALLY take their job to heart. My advice is approach from

the back of the driver's side.
Your first task in GTW is of course a simple one: steal a
horse. This gets you used to the controls and guarantees you
learn how to ride your horse. The next trick is keeping the horse
alive, as you have to find pasture for it to graze on. properly
equip it with horse shoes, and ensure that it doesn't get shot.
After this is accomplished, you can ride out into the vast expan
sive prairies and begin your grand adventures.
The game has many side quests that fans of GTA will surely
enjoy, such as holding up the Pony Express for a hefty ransom,
intercepting and decoding telegraphs, repairing your wagon
wheel and fording the occasional river. I don't want to give
away too much, as this game should be played by everyone, but
I will say that the graphics are amazing. The vast expansive
nothingness of the Midwest really comes to life in all its mono
chromatic glory. While some of you may miss the green pixilat
ed wagons crossing the black background. I guarantee this game
will provide the cure for your nostalgia, while still managing to
pack in all the heart pumping action you'd expect from GTA
game. It looks so real, I can even smell the horse dung.
