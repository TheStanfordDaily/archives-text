### KATE HAYES INTERMISSION BUCKEYE 
Akin to homemade Reese's cups, these peanut butter
halls covered in chocolate are made hy pretty much
everyone who lives near my grandmother in western
Ohio. Hence their name: —Ohio is "the Buckeye
State."

•1.5 cups peanut
hutter (smooth)
•a stick of butter
•lots of powdered
sugar (4-6 cups)
•a bag of chocolate
chips, or a bar of
baking chocolate
•toothpicks and a
cookie sheet

Thoroughly mix together the butter and peanut
butter. Stir the sugar in a little at a time (around half
a cup works well) until the dough is very dry and
almost crumbly. Pack this dough into small balls
about an inch and a half in diameter, and then put
them on a cookie sheet. Stick a toothpick in each ball
before placing the sheet in the freezer. Leave them
overnight.
Before you take them out the next day, melt the
chocolate chips (this can be done in the microwave, but
a double boiler results in smoother chocolate, which
makes the next part easier) in a bowl. Dip each ball into
the melted chocolate, and leave them out to harden.
Now, these buckeves are readv to eat!
