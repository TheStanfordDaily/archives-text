## Reflections on McEwan's beach 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION BEACH BUM 
lan McEwan is very much a lit
erary rock star (witness the talks he
gave at Stanford winter quarter),
but one who hasn't crossed the line
into celebrity and ostentation, like
Chuck Palahniuk and Jonathan
Safran Foer. He writes good novels,
his prose is perhaps the best in the
English language (although Claire
Messud in "The Emperor's
Children" might give him a run for
his money) and he's unafraid to
write about the most difficult of
topics, sex.
That topic remains the focus of
his latest novel, "On Chesil Beach"
— or novella, for it is a small
dimensioned book and barely 200
pages, and easily readable in one
day. The first third of the book was
already published as a short story in
The New Yorker, and was excellent
on its own. The question, however,
is whether the last two thirds of the
novella add anything to it.
McEwan is all about detail, and
the premise of his story is mired in
it. An English couple in 1962 ("a
time when a conversation about
sexual difficulties was plainly
impossible"), just married and are
to consummate their love.
The consummation proceeds
awkwardly, as one would expect.
It's heinously awkward. McEwan's
omniscient narrator alternates
between both character's perspec
tives, and fills in much of the back

story in alternate chapters. It com
prises the most interesting parts of
the novel — Edward's desire to
hide his "mentally damaged" moth
er from the world and his self-cen
tered ambition as well as Florence's
introverted, singular focus on music
and her emotionally distant rela
tionship with her parents. Florence
and Edward come from different
social classes, but agree politically;
he wants more physically, and
despite her belief that she loves him
(and the reader does come to
believe that), she is repulsed by
most physicality.
Their approaches to marriage
and the wedding night itself seem
to be shaped by their personal
psychologies, the dynamics of
their interaction and Florence's
sense of "duty." At one point,
Florence revealingly comments
that she sometimes feels like a
mother, sometimes a daughter, to
Edward. He is missing a real
mother figure, she has daddy
problems. It works.
McEwan can only squeeze so
much out the story, however, and it
proceeds slowly, bordering on too
slowly, at 203 pages. Much more
could have been spent on the after
math — divorce due to "noncon
summation;" Edward's frequent
romantic disappointments;
Florence looking for him in the seat
he once promised he would sit in at
her new quartet's premiere, several
years afterward. It is hard to
believe that after more than a vear

of intense emotional interaction,
they would never speak again for
the rest of their lives, much less try
to find each other again. One won
ders if perhaps focus could have
been not on the aborted consum
mation itself, but rather its effect on
their lives.
"On Chesil Beach" is too small,
however and too limited to become
McEwan's defining novel. It is
much less ambitious than most of
McEwan's previous novels. For a
full-length work, it's very focused
on the two newlyweds — they're
the only characters, really — and
rarely delves into larger social
themes, as he did in his novel
"Saturday." "On Chesil Beach"
might have worked better as a short
story, even if it was broken up into
two or three installments in The
New Yorker. Written by a novelist
with such prodigious and obvious
talent, it is somewhat disappoint
ing. Still, it's a short book and
worth reading, if only to savor the
prose.
