# SUMMER READS
## Not-so-desperate 
### EMMA TROTTER INTERMISSION HOUSE-KEEPER 
I can't deny that Ellen Baker's
debut novel "Keeping the House"
may appear long and baffling if you
judge it by page numbers alone.
Even for us Stanford students, it can
be daunting to tackle a book with
over 500 pages during summer vaca
tion — unless it's Harry Potter, of
course. But I encourage you to curb
that instinct and take a crack at
"Keeping the House" this summer. 1
promise you'll be able to finish it
well before the release of the con
clusion to Harry's story on July 21st.
Baker relates the story of Dolly
Magnuson, a 1950s housewife stuck
in a suffocating marriage to an older
soldier whom she set her heart on
when she was only 12-years-old. In
order to escape her unhappiness,
Dolly gradually begins to neglect
her household chores and focuses
on fixing up the grandest house in
all of Pine Rapids, Wisconsin: an
abandoned mansion which once
belonged to the prosperous
Mickelson family. The architecture
and personality of the stately house
fascinate Dolly; she fantasizes that
living there with her husband, would
heal their broken bond and give her
a sense of belonging in the tight-knit
community. The plotline alternates
between Dolly's narrative and tales
of the Mickelsons, which Baker
reveals part by flashback and part
by the wagging tongues of the gos
sipy ladies in Dolly's quilting club.
The story revolves around the dif
ficult choices that many women
often encounter, but don't let that
deter you. 1 remember thinking to
myself about two thirds of the way

through the book that I could get lost
in the lives of the characters forever.
The story has its fair share of roman
tic entanglements, family betrayals
and all sorts of intriguing twists and
turns. Sparks really fly when Dolly
meets one of the Mickelsons in per
son, and he confides in her more
than it seems her husband ever will.
Not only is the plot fascinating, but
Baker's use of language captivated
me as well. Maybe I HUM is finally
getting to me, but I thoroughly
enjoyed the delightful metaphors
appearing throughout Baker's prose.
For example, she once referred to
music as "billowing" from a pianist's
fingers.
Give "Keeping the House" a try
this summer. It's a fun and fast read,
and maybe, like Dolly, you can use
it to escape the realities of your own
life for a while.
