## Harry shows his 'Sirius' side 
### TYLER PARKER INTERMISSION FIFTH YEAR 
'Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix'
Dir. David Yates

A familiar wizard is back in multi
plexes this weekend to crash
"Transformers'" box office party.
The fifth Harry Potter movie install
ment, "Harry Potter and the Order
of the Phoenix," preps the rabid
Potter fan-base for the release of
Harry's final literary escapade, to be
released on July 21. Salivating fans
will have to wait and look to the
screen this weekend as new director
to the series, David Yates, tries his
hand at magic.
The movie is certainly the dark
est yet as Harry is forced to deal
with new revelations, pain, and
loss. The premise poises Harry and
Professor Dumbledore versus a
new antagonist, Cornelius Fudge,
the head of the Ministry of Magic.
Fudge denies and refutes all claims
of a return by You-Know-Who and
attempts to smear the names of
Harry and Dumbledore in the
process. If that isn't enough, Harry
must also deal with the discovery of
a personal connection with the dark
lord, a possible love interest, a
crazy new Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher (played bril
liantly by Imelda Staunton), and his
OWL (Ordinary Wizardry Level)
exams.
Hogwarts certainly feels differ
ent in Harry's fifth year and while
some may not welcome the change
in atmosphere, it comes together for
an intriguing fifth installment that
remains faithful to the series. (Don't
forget that the series changed pace
in the books as well!) I larry and the
gang are forced to mature quickly

and they do so in convincing fash
ion. A new side of the wizard com
munity is exposed (via the Order of
the Phoenix) and offers a fresh
experience. The audience is also
treated to several interesting new
characters in Luna Lovegood and
Professor Umbridge, both of which
add a surprising amount to the expe
rience.
At times, the movie feels like it
drags and one may get the feeling
that it is simply a placeholder in the
series. T his feeling quickly disperses
as the film explodes into one this
summer's best climaxes. The first
wizard free-for-all in the series is
done gorgeously, followed by an
incredible interpretation of a highly
anticipated duel between two top
notch wizards. I wouldn't want to
give anything away, so I recommend
you get to the theatre and embrace
the new direction the series is tak
ing.
