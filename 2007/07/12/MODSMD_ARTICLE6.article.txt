## CRIME Campus tree dweller evicted 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
After spending the better part of a decade
sitting cross-legged in quiet solitude and listen
ing to his short-wave radio, Worden Miller has
finally been evicted from his tree grove home
on Stanford property.
Now passing his days with suspicion and
anxiety at the Veterans Administration hospi
tal in Menlo Park, Miller fears that he has for
ever left his radio, his tranquil study and a sense
of safety back under his tree 50 yards off Palm
Drive.
Stanford Police initially arrested him on July
4 on a misdemeanor trespassing charge. Miller
appeared in Santa Clara County Superior
Court the following day and pled not guilty. He
was released after his pre-trial date was set for
early September, and police took him back to
his tree, where he had long sat with his wheel
chair and grocery cart.
But by Monday morning, all that remained
next to the tree was a worn sleeping bag, old
newspapers, several trash bags and an olive,
extreme-weather military-issue winter jacket.
Stanford police had already taken Miller to
Valley Medical Center.
"They've kidnapped me twice and now this
is taking away my freedom," Miller said via
phone from the facility's patient care unit.
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Deputy Chris Cohendet, who has been at the
Department for five years, said that police have
been routinely checking on Miller since
Cohendet first arrived. Miller claimed to have
spent seven-and-a-half years in the grove.
Stanford police, fearing that Miller's physi

cal and mental condition had been deteriorat
ing, checked him into to a Veterans
Administration hospital for 33 days last year.
Police said that Miller's legs had atrophied to
the point that he is severely handicapped.
"He can't move, so he's been sleeping in a
rotting sleeping bag and defecating in the envi
ronment," Cohendet said.
The Department of Public Safety consulted
the University's legal counsel last fall and
issued Miller a "stay away" order, which Chris
Mattison, Miller's public defender, said was
simply an attempt to get her handicapped client
off the University's hands before he died on
campus.
Mattison questioned why the University
decided to evict Miller now.
"He's got real problems with his legs, but this is
how he lives," she said. "How has anything
changed? I haven't seen a compelling reason
why he has to leave now instead of two, three
or four years ago. If they let him stay there until
he dies, which is what he wants, then that's it,
we're done."
The University's legal representatives did
not respond to specific questions about Miller,
but Director of Communications Alan Acosta
issued a statement about the case.
"Over the last several years we have consult
ed with local social service providers and the
Veteran's Administration in efforts to encour
age Mr. Miller to seek needed assistance," he
wrote. "Unfortunately, he has chosen not to
avail himself of those services. As a result, the
University has issued a "stay away' letter to Mr.
Miller and we are hopeful that he will comply
with this directive."
Cohendet insisted that the police were fol

lowing through with their moral obligation.
"We can't just leave him there at this point,"
he said. "We've used the criminal system to
provide Miller proper medical attention."
Miller doesn't see it that way.
"They've been harassing me day and night
for years, and now they break into my home,"
he said. "It wasn't good enough that 1 had a
court appearance; they had to just to harass me.
I sit quietly in the sunlight and cat fresh food.
I'm no big-time criminal."
Miller said he used to work on a destroyer as
an electronic technician with the U.S. Navy. He
added that he was lucky enough to leave the
Navy before combat operations began.
"I heard them shoot the guns a couple of
times," he recalled. "It was really loud, but that
was it."
He thinks he may still have family in upstate
New York, where he formerly worked as a
technician.
Miller said that for years, friends would
bring provisions to his encampment. He also
claimed to shop at Andronico's supermarket
and said he chatted with other shoppers about
health topics â€” as Miller's last few years have
been devoted to the study of health, there is no
conversation topic he likes more. He listens
faithfully to alternative medicine doctor Bob
Marshall's daily radio program on AM 770.
This was Miller's life until police, he
claimed, began harassing him, before stealing
his sleeping bag for three months and eventual
ly taking him to the hospital where he now
waits nervously.
Miller is very suspicious of the
treatment he is currently receiving,
and said he has refused to take a
number of medicines, afraid that
synthetic drugs would degrade his
DNA and hasten his aging.
He is also nervous about the nurs
es; he said he looks into their eyes
and sees that they want to psycholog
ically probe him and feed him
unhealthy, processed food and syn
thetic drugs. When he walks around
to talk to the veterans who suffered
permanent trauma or injury in the
war, he becomes deeply moved, and
he blames the government.
"Have some pity on the men over
here, won't you?" he implored.
"There are real veterans here and
they're being screwed. How is our
government any better than Vichy
France?"
He still doesn't understand why
the police won't leave him alone, and
he dislikes being confined in the hos
pital. He often thinks about how
much he appreciates the open air of
his grove home, because "most of
society is a concentration camp."
"History of man is a history of
slavery, and freeing yourself is not a
joke," he said solemnly.
So if he is eventually released and
free to do whatever he wishes, what
would he choose to do?
"I'm not really that imaginative,"
Miller said. "I'd just sit under the
tree and be quiet, really, and keep
mv fresh outlook."
