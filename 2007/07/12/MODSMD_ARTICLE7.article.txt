## ASSU airport shuttle earns mixed reviews Program expected to continue despite cost 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
A June trial run of the shuttle service that ferried students to
the San Francisco and San Jose airports saw nearly 4(H) passen
gers, a number high enough to keep supporters of the program
optimistic about its return for Thanksgiving break. However, oth
ers saw its run at about 20 percent capacity as evidence that the
cost of the service outweighs its usefulness.
Originally a campaign promise made by ASSU executives
Hershey Avula "08 and Mondaire Jones '09, the airport shuttle
program was sponsored by the Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC).
The program easily passed in the Senate, with members voting
14-1 in May to provide $7,000 for the program, but GSC members
allocated only $3,500 — half of what was expected — for the ser
vice. While funding for this year's program was drawn from ASSU
and GSC general reserve fees, supporters hope to fund the shuttle
service with special fees by next spring.
The Trial Run
According to a spreadsheet of students who bought tickets for
the shuttles online, only 374 seats
were purchased out of a possible
1.980 seats in 44 shuttles. Jones, who
authored the bill, said he expects the
number of users to increase "expo
nentially."
•What happened this past quar
ter was that though several hundred
students decided to use the service, a
quarter of the student population
was automatically ineligible because
seniors were staying for gradua
tion," Jones said. "Graduate stu
dents and a large number of under
graduates stay on campus for the
summer as well."
"Thanksgiving holiday is going to
be very different," he added. "There
will be more students looking to use
the program, and the window of
lime for vacation is narrower."
Avula said that the early date of
the pilot program was scheduled in
part to allow students more time to
decide if they considered the airport
shuttle a valuable service.
"We also want students to know
that we're working for them," he
added. "We're all about getting
things done and getting results as
quickly as possible."
Avula added that the total num
ber of students using the service was
a better indicator of the program's
success than the fullness of the shut
tles.
"Our goal was to have about 300
riders, which we thought would vali
date the shuttle service," he said.
"We were pretty pleased with the
results. The point at which we prob
ably would have cut the program
would have been if we'd gotten 200
riders or fewer. Since there were
closer to 400, there's a much bigger
likelihood that the program will be
back for Thanksgiving."
Thanksgiving Runs
Funding for the Thanksgiving
version of the shuttle service, how
ever, will be put to another vote in
both the Senate and the GSC — and
not without a few adjustments.
Though Avula and Jones said
that student response to the airport
shuttles was generally positive, they
also noted that they received com
plaints about shuttle drivers who
whizzed past the stop at Tresidder
Union or cut it close in rush hour
traffic.
"We're working with Parking and
Transportation Services, which sub
contracted the company that provid
ed the shuttle, to provide refunds for
at least the shuttle ticket and hope
fully for the cost of the taxi or shut
tle that students had to order to get
to the airport," Avula said. "It's
something we're very concerned
about."
Senator Jonathan Kass '10 said
he will continue to support the shut
tle.
"The ASSU has not met since the
shuttle service debuted as it has
been summer, so we have not dis
cussed it as a group other than
through email," he said in an email
to The Daily. "I can't guarantee
what others will do, and this service
at the moment relies on many fac
tors like how the Senate and the
GSC will vote in the fall, but 1 will
certainly be supporting this service
again for Thanksgiving break."
Avula and Jones said that orga

nizers had hoped to use smaller
shuttles with fewer seats, but that
they had been booked. More impor
tant than capacity, they said, was
providing a valuable service to stu
dents.
"This was among the initiatives
we have planned to reduce the cost
of living for students," Jones said.
"There were some who felt as
though the airport shuttle service
might be a waste of money in that
the price we pay to fund the service
won't be made up through the $5
service charge. My response is that
the service is supposed to be just
that, a service, and we're not trying
to make money off this program in
any way."
In addition, he pointed to the
$320,000 remaining in the general
fee reserve fund.
"The amount of money we spent
relative to what's been sitting in the
reserve is somewhat inconsequen
tial," he said. "The point was to
determine whether or not this thing
was going to be worth bringing back
in the fall, and whether it was some
thing students were genuinely inter
ested in."
Debate Stirs
Other senators, however, were

less sanguine.
Senator Jose Benchimol '08, the
only dissenting vote on the initial
shuttle bill, said in an email to The
Daily that he had argued against the
shuttle program as one that was too
expensive and would incur a "huge
loss."
"The ASSU should not have as
its goal to be profitable, but to
attend (to] students' needs," he said.
"So are we attending to their needs
when we run a project that results in
losses of approximately $9,000 — or
the equivalent of paying $30 per
user?"
He said he had also been con
cerned about what he saw as a fail
ure to determine procedures for how
to evaluate the success or failure of
the program.
"1 believe that this year's results
were a reflection of the management
of the program and mainly the lack
of demand for this service," he said.
"People have their ways of getting to
the airport. Had we charged nothing
1 believe the usage would be similar.
Furthermore, 20 percent capacity is
incredibly low — not just for me but
for Hershey and Mondaire as well,
at least before the program took
place. They'd said in voting that they
were expecting at least 50 percent

capacity, but we had several buses
with five or fewer people."
Senator Stuart Baimel '09. who
voted in support of the shuttle bill,
said he was concerned that the
amount of demonstrated student
interest in the pilot program would
not be enough to justify what he
characterized as the increasing cost
of the shuttle service to the Senate's
reserve funds, which he said were
supposed to be used as a buffer.
"To authorize the program the
first time, we needed to draw a rea
sonably large sum from the ASSU
reserves," he said. "To fund it again,
we'll have to get more money, and 1
don't see the GSC chipping in. So
we'll have to use these funds to pay
for this program for Thanksgiving,
winter and spring, since it won't be
up for special fees until then."
Baimel said that the pilot pro
gram showed that the cost was too
high to continue with unless an alter
native source of funding could be
found.
"We can spend money from our
reserve accounts, but if we fund this
program for the entire year, we
won't have much money for any
thing else," he said. "1 think the 18.9
percent usage rate was a little low. I
don't see people using |the shuttles]

more than (hey do now, and while
4(X) students is substantial, it won't
be for that kind of money."
While Baimel admitted that it
would be unlikely for further fund
ing to the shuttle program to be
voted down, he suggested several
changes that could be made.
"Since this program is so closely
associated with the ASSU execu
tives, I think they should contribute
money out of their own accounts,
even if it's just symbolic," he said.
"That would go a long way to show
ing that they're committed to it.
We're also going to have to figure
out how to publicize this campaign."
Benchimol, however, was less
forgiving.
"1 think we should learn the les
son that this pilot taught us and stop
it for the following quarters," he
said. "Cheap transportation will
continue to be provided for the 374
riders via the Caltrain and other
public transportation. It might take
30 to 45 minutes more, hut would be
without a doubt a better option to
students who are essentially paying
about 30 dollars per user of the
ASSU shuttle."
