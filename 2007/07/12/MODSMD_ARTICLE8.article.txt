## Further farm fires spark investigations 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Firefighters got little rest after a
human-caused June 25 brushfire
scorched almost 2(X) acres near the
Stanford Dish. A July 1 fire on
University Avenue and a smaller
July 5 blaze that charred another
20 acres in the Stanford foothills
kept them scrambling, as did inves
tigations into the causes of the
above fires.
The July 5 foothills fire, which
broke out to the north of the June
25 site near Junipero Serra
Boulevard, was reported last
Thursday at 1:20 p.m. Local and
regional firefighters, supported by
helicopters and aircraft, were able
to contain the blaze by 4:30 p.m. on
the same day.
According to Stanford
Department of Public Safety
Deputy Chris Cohendet, two fire

fighters were treated for heat
exhaustion, but no structural dam
age was reported.
"The field was closed, so
nobody was at the site," Cohendet
said. "The fire wasn't in the same
location as the one on June 25, hut
it did move a little bit and butted
up against the burned areas. In
fact, the burned shrubs helped con
tain the [July 5] fire."
Cohendet said that a section of
Junipero Serra Boulevard was
temporarily closed to accommo
date responding units. Power to
about 2,(XX) houses was also briefly
shut down while firefighters from
nearby cities and from the
California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection worked to con
trol the blaze.
The cause of the fire is still
unknown. The Dish area will
remained closed until further notice.
The investigation into the cause
of the June 25 fire by the Stanford
Dish, however, has been closed.
Although the fire department origi
nally believed the fire was caused by
a malfunctioning generator,
Cohendet said that two juveniles
were responsible for starting the
171-acre blaze.
"The juveniles were playing with
matches and tried to light some
dried grass, and that's how the fire
was ignited," Cohendet said. "Ihe
juveniles along with a passing wit
ness attempted to extinguish the
fire, but unfortunately it spread. The
parents of the juveniles then came
forward to the police department to
let us know what had happened."
The juveniles were interviewed
by Stanford Department of Public
Safety officers before being released
to their parents. Cohendet said that
a case report had been written and
forwarded to the Santa Clara
Juvenile Probation Department for
review.
He also gave advice to residents
coping with a particularly dry sea
son.
"Be careful," he said. "Don't
play with matches, don't put ciga
rettes out on the ground, and throw
out trash. Even discarded glass can
start a fire, so be cautious."
Meanwhile, the investigation
remains underway regarding the
cause of the University Avenue fire.
Sections of University Avenue were
reopened to road traffic on Tuesday
after a Julv 1 fire gutted the second

floor of a commercial building that
housed a Walgreens and a Subway.
According to a press release from
the Palo Alto Police and Fire
Departments, the fire occurred at
approximately 9:30 p.m. and took
local and regional firefighters more
than five hours to control.
No injuries were reported, but
structural damage was estimated at

According to a weeklong exami
nation conducted by the National
Response Team from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives (ATF), along with ATF
special agents from the San
Francisco Field Division, the blaze
was an arson fire. The Palo Alto
Police Department and local ATF
special agents are continuing to
investigate.
