## Science News Roundup New ways to make babies 
### 
Sometimes, when a man and a
woman love each other very
much, they hug each other in a
special way and have a baby. Other
times, it isn't quite so simple. This
week's Science News Roundup is all
about how science steps up when
babymaking breaks down. It's been
a good week for infertility break
throughs, and a good week to
devote a whole column to the sub
ject of assisted reproductive tech
nology.
Our first story this week: A
Canadian mother is saving her own
eggs for her daughter's future use.
Seven-year-old Flavie has Turner
syndrome, a disorder characterized
by short stature, malfunctioning
ovaries and underdeveloped sec
ondary sex characteristics. While
most women have two X chromo
somes, Flavie only has one, and her
abnormal ovaries mean she is
almost guaranteed to be infertile.
But Turner syndrome doesn't affect
the uterus, and Flavie has a good
chance of delivering a healthy baby
in the future if she uses a donor egg.
That's where mom comes in. If
Flavie wants to have kids, and she
uses her mother's eggs to make
them, she'll give birth to her genetic
half-sibling. Flavie's mother said she
won't compel her daughter to use
the eggs. "I want to give her the
option," she told reporters. "If she
had needed another organ such as a
kidney, I would volunteer without
any hesitation at all, and it is the
same kind of thought process for
this."
Maybe childrearing won't fit in
with Flavie's future plans. Or, if she
does want kids, maybe she'll have a
different donor in mind. Her moth
er's eggs will wait patiently until she
decides.
Moving from eggs to their male
counterpart: U.S. scientists have
produced baby mice from cloned
mouse sperm. The researchers
cloned the sperm by injecting sperm
heads into enucleated mouse eggs.
The resulting "pseudosperm" began
to divide, producing a cluster of
sperm cells. These aren't your nor
mal swimmers, though. They are
spherical and lack tails, meaning
that they must be injected directly
into egg cells through a tiny needle.
Still, the technique could be valu
able in certain cases of male infertil
ity. One in 300 men can't impreg
nate their partners because they
make next to no sperm. Cloning
sperm cells could be a solution for
these men. "If we can find just three
or four sperm in a sample, we could
grow them up," said one of the sci
entists involved in the break
through.
Back to the female reproductive
system: This week, doctors
announced the birth of a bouncing
baby girl, the first to be born from

an egg matured in the laboratory
and then frozen for later use.
Traditionally, a woman undergoing
in vitro fertilization is given a series
of hormone injections, which cause
several of her eggs to ripen at once.
Doctors then harvest the eggs, swirl
them around with some sperm in a
Petri dish, and transfer the resulting
embryos into the mother's womb.
The new procedure, called "in
vitro maturation" skips the hor
mone treatment altogether. A
woman can now have her immature
eggs siphoned out at any time,
ripened in the laboratory, and
lrozen for later use. This is of critical
importance to women who would be
harmed by the traditional course of
hormones.
And the procedure might not just
be for adult women. Researchers
announced this week that eggs from
a five-year-old girl could be matured
in vitro. Doctors in Israel extracted
eggs from sixteen prepubescent
girls, all of whom had cancer.
Chemotherapy is likely to leave
these patients infertile, but it was
previously considered impossible to
salvage the immature eggs of prepu
bescent girls. With the new technol
ogy, the girls now have eggs on tap,
should they choose to have kids in
the future.
I suppose this is all great news,
but I'm having a hard time getting
excited about it. Why do individuals
fork over fistfuls of cash, submit to
endless needle jabs and invest in all
manner of heroics to produce a
genetically related child. Why don't
people just adopt?
Perhaps the drive to have biolog
ical children is stronger for some
people than others. Maybe I don't
understand it because most of my
friends are lesbians, and the
American classic of Mom, Dad and
2.5 kids has never been an option for
LGBT folk. The queer community
has sort of gotten over the idea that
a baby arrives when a man and
woman love each other very much.
Then again, maybe that's exactly
why LGBT individuals should be
excited about assisted reproductive
technologies. After all, such tech
nologies are creating families like
never before. In vitro fertilization
requires sperm, eggs, and a womb,
but there are no rules about who
those parts come from. A lesbian
can harvest her eggs, mix them with
sperm from a sperm bank and

implant the resulting embryos in her
partner's womb. Not exactly the tra
ditional story of mom + dad = baby.
Mom + dad = baby has had its
day, and now it's a bit obsolete.
Today we can either decry the
breakdown of the nuclear family, or
we can celebrate the diversity that
assisted reproductive technologies
have helped bring about. I choose to
celebrate.
