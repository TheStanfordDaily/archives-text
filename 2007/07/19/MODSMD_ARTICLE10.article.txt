## Sketch Understanding 
### 
It has been frequently pointed out
to me that how I choose to spend
my life is a waste of time. The
study of theoretical physics (espe
cially as it pertains to the earliest
fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
a second of the universe's history) is
mostly useless.
This is not just a problem with
theoretical physics; esoteric knowl
edge is, by its very nature, esoteric.
It's difficult to make a coherent
argument that the dedicated study
of the use of adjectives in medieval
French literature has much bearing
on the lives of most of the people on
the planet.
This is not to say that all academ
ic pursuits are necessarily pointless.
Many are naively worthwhile (med
ical research being an obvious
example here) and still others are
arguably of some value if one
believes in the accuracy of extrapo
lation (say, military history).
There are also many areas of
active research that, while without
purpose right now, may have some
use in the future. History is, after all,
littered with apparently pointless
discoveries that eventually changed
the world.
When asked the use of his recent
discovery of electromagnetic induc
tion (electric motors and whatnot,
for the scientifically-stunted),
Michael Faraday famously inquired
as to the use of a newborn baby.
Ever since then scientists have been
hurling the same epithet whenever
the practical value of their work is
questioned — no defense is more
robust than a wisely chosen anec
dote.
The problem, however, is that
most things mocked as useless are,
in fact, useless. What's more, many
of them are obviously useless —
vast amounts of academic endeavor
have no purpose other than to satis
fy curiosity.
Okay. Fair enough. We're just
trying to satisfy our insatiable need
to know. Maybe that's not so bad.
Maybe easing curiosity has value of
its own.
For a start, it's foolish to believe
that progress is always directed. You
can't just pick a goal and march
directly towards it — before a dis
covery is made we have little idea of
how to make it. Answers can come
from surprising directions.
Furthermore, that's not how peo
ple work. We enter the academic
world because we are curious and
we work on the problems that ignite
that curiosity. Constraining the
problems that a budding thinker
should think about seems as likely
to force people into different
careers as anything else would.
Even aside from the necessity of
blind curiosity for intellectual
progress, I would argue that assuag
ing curiosity has great value in and
of itself. The achievements of

humanity are not just practical, they
are abstract too. The wheel was a
great invention, but so was the
novel.
The practical is labeled thus
because it either improves the qual
ity of life or extends its length.
Impractical, idle speculations on
iambic pentameter may not hold off
senility, but they do do something
for the quality of existence.
The value of being human
becomes greater the more we (col
lectively) know. What it means to be
human in a world where we under
stand the details of how billions of
cells working in concert can produce
life is both different and greater
than possessing humanity without
such knowledge.
While I'm very fond of this
worldview, and use it to great effect
when defending my decision to
spend a lifetime leeching money
from those who pursue more practi
cal pursuits, there are some prob
lems.
Well, actually, there's one prob
lem. It doesn't happen. Humanity's
curiosity is not assuaged by my (or
anyone else's) probing of the dark
hidden recesses of intellectual
progress. The assuaging fails because
the results of such probing rarely
make it out into the mainstream.
Instead knowledge is jealously held
within a small circle of experts.
Actually, jealously is not really
the right word. I think it's rather
more the case that we a) don't
believe anybody cares and b) don't
think they could understand even if
they did.
Unfortunately, this completely
defeats the purpose of pushing back
the boundaries of human compre
hension. One cannot claim to have
added to the value of humanity, to
the store of its knowledge and
understanding if the only people that
grasp your achievements are you
and a handful of others in your field.
We owe it to those who finance
our pursuits not just to understand,
but also to explain, and explain to
everyone. There does not exist a
subject that cannot be put in lan
guage that everyone understands.
And we cannot claim to be extend
ing the frontiers of human knowl
edge unless we show everyone what
those frontiers look like.

Since I am as guilty as the next man
when it comes to jealously guarding
useless knowledge, email navins@

explanation of how to calculate prob
abilities in eternal in flation.
