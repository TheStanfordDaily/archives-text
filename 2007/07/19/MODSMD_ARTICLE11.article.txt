## Smoking for your health 
### 
Nearsighted people who also
have trouble seeing close up
are in a bind. My mom has
worn glasses for distance vision since
she was a kid, but now (along with
countless other baby boomers) she's
also having trouble reading. She
wore contacts to my sister's gradua
tion so she could see the students
onstage, but then she couldn't read
the program.
People like her sometimes wear
reading glasses over their contacts,
but it turns out there might be a bet
ter solution.
The FDA recently approved a
LASIK eye treatment designed to
surgically customize each eye. The
surgery corrects all the nearsighted
ness in one eye and only part of the
nearsightedness in the other eye.
The fully corrected eye is used for
distance vision, and the under-cor
rected eye is used for seeing things
close-up.
Bionic eyes aren't new, but per
manently differentiating eyes is
novel. Instead of switching between

contacts and reading glasses, people
like my mom can now just switch
eyes.
News from the other end of the
body: Johnson & Johnson is seeking
foreign approval for dapoxetine, a
drug designed to fight premature
ejaculation. In 2005, the FDA reject
ed the drug because of side effects
including nausea and momentary
loss of consciousness. (The article I
read didn't say when these losses of
consciousness occurred. Were they
during sex? If a man faints in fla
grante, does that count as lasting
longer?)
Johnson & Johnson tested their
drug on men who ejaculated an aver
age of one minute after the start of

intercourse. Their partners were
actually timing them with stopwatch
es. Take a minute to picture that.
("Ready, honey? On your mark, get
set, go!") In clinical trials, men taking
a placebo lasted only two minutes,
while the men on dapoxetine lasted
three to four minutes.
Dapoxetine is a selective sero
tonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),
which puts it in the same class as
Prozac and other popular antidepres
sants. For some people who take
them, these antidepressants can have
serious sexual side effects, including
difficulty in reaching orgasm. The
problem can be so bad that a lot of
patients go off their SSRIs, but men
with premature ejaculation some
times take SSRIs to cause this "prob
lem." Dapoxetine has the same
effect, but it would be a better choice
than other SSRIs because it works
faster and stays in the body for a
shorter time.
Now for some confusing news: It

turns out smokers are less likely to get
Parkinson's disease. The effect has been
observed for years, but it was confirmed by a
recent review that pooled data from over
11 ,(XX) patients.
Current smokers were 32 percent less likely
to get Parkinson's than their non-smoking
counterparts, and the protective effect was
seen even in people who quit years earlier.
Cigarette smokers weren't the only ones
affected, since people who smoked pipes and
cigars also had a lower risk of Parkinson's.
The way smoking prevents Parkinson's is
unknown. It's possible that chemicals like nico
tine or carbon dioxide could be protecting the

specific neurons implicated in Parkinson's dis
ease. Or, the cigarette smoke could be acting
on certain enzymes to prevent the formation of
brain-damaging toxins. Another idea is that
certain traits make some people both more
likely to smoke and less likely to get
Parkinson's.
People who smoke and get lung cancer
don't get much sympathy. It's their own fault
they're sick; they shouldn't have been smok
ing. I hope the same doesn't happen to
Parkinson's sufferers. It's their own fault
they're sick; they should've been smoking!
The whole thing makes me feel like some
malevolent entity is throwing around double
binds with deadly diseases. I'm ready to give
up and go eat a pint of Haagen-Dazs. If it caus
es heart disease, it must protect against
Alzheimer's.
