## The 						Chinese Kansas 
### 
I left Shanghai last Friday morning.
I left behind the 50-cent egg and
dough cakes from the closet-sized
shop around the corner, the danger
ous midnight taxi rides, and the inex
pensive pirated handbags marketed
by overzealous old women. As my
morning taxi sped past a sign touting
"Intelligentized design" and Hello
Kitty themed roadside knickknack
shops, I began to realize how much I
would miss this place. 1 was on my
way to the train station, heading for
the capitalist powerhouse of
Shenzhen. Going only on hearsay, I
feared the worst.
Up until 1979, Shenzhen was the
middle of nowhere: the Chinese
Kansas. Farmers milled about, carry
ing buckets to and fro and singing
peasant songs in a lovely tenor. I
would have loved to visit such a town
in such a state, to experience life in
the Chinese countryside. But along
came Big Business. The Chinese
leader Deng Xiao Ping, realizing the
benefits of a province directly adja
cent to the British possession of
Hong Kong, decided to bend the
rules a bit and allow foreign invest
ment in a supposedly Communist ter
ritory. He called his creation
"Socialism with Chinese characteris
tics."
Falling on the heels of Chairman
Mao's failed reforms, his project
helped to kick-start the Chinese
economy, by essentially surrendering

to capitalism. The result was a city
with more skyscrapers than temples,
more Pizza Huts than roadside food
stands, and more cars than bicycles.
Shenzhen, or so I had heard from a
friend, was a "Wenhua ShaMo," or
literally, a cultural desert.
My first impressions, on arriving,
only confirmed this observation. I
devised a new phrase to describe
Shenzhen: "America with Chinese
characteristics." Behind a thin veneer
of Chinese identity lies a Western
core. Against my better judgment, I
ate McDonalds last night. Chanel,
Prada, and Gucci bags pop up in the
most unlikely places. And cars actu
ally obey traffic signs.
Thoroughly disenchanted with
the cultural prospects of this
Western megalopolis, my mind wan
dered back to the train ride 1 had
taken from Shanghai to Shenzhen.
Though 1 didn't realize it at the time,
this train ride is one of the most
Chinese experiences I have encoun
tered in China.
There was quite a bit of culture
clashing from the outset. My three
coworkers and I each happened to

have three bags — a backpack, a
smaller bag for electronics/medicine,
and a larger bag meant for a two
month stay in China. This just so hap
pens to be three more bags than the
average Chinese person travels with,
with a girth three times larger than
the average Chinese train hallway
can accommodate.
We bumbled down the narrow
corridor, made all the more narrow
by the large number of train passen
gers sitting along the sides of it. Our
foreignness was almost painful. But
out of the blue, there came our sa\
ior: a man with extraordinarily
disheveled hair, a tattered white polo
shirt with flowers on it, and a large
cigarette package sticking out of his
pocket.
The man took it upon himselt to
help us pack away our bags, assuring
us that placing them in the rooms ol
the other passengers was not a prob
lem. As a coworker and I lifted the
bags to place them in the overhead
compartments, he urged us on with
Communist sayings about the value
of hard work and cooperation. I
quote: "The Great Leader Chairman
Mao teaches us: Working together,
the proletariat can accomplish any
thing!"
We settled in, ready to take naps,
but our guardian followed us into the
cabin, and began an epic conversa-


Nat
Hillard
tion. In the course of roughly 10 hours, we
learned from this animated man the following
things: to marry women in Shanghai requires a
dowry consisting of cigarettes, flowers, a large
leg of ham, expensive tea, a fruit basket, and
potent alcohol; MSG is actually good for your
health, and fried food helps to keep the brain
alert; women from northeast China are inher
ently better at soccer; and learning English is
a lot like butchering a pig. In speech heavily
laden with Communist undertones, the man
laid down his personal view of the world, all
the while taking up a large portion of my
already small bed and shaking the bunk with
his profuse laugher.

Though he exited the train before we went
to bed, my coworkers and I soon made the
acquaintance of our unnecessarily loud bunk
mates, more out of necessity than genuine
friendliness — their talking continued on into
the wee hours of the morning. At 4 a.m., hav
ing awoken us with loud fist pounds on the
table, they taught us how to play a Chinese
card game called "Run for Your Life."
Sitting here, now, in Shenzhen, in a high
rise apartment complex with air-conditioning,
I may as well be in Cincinnati. But make no
mistake, Shenzhen is a Chinese city. I will be
here for perhaps two more weeks, and in
those weeks, I will make every effort to
explore its Chinese identity. I may not find
another man so skilled at prolonged and yet
culturally-authentic chatter, but I will surely
look for him.
