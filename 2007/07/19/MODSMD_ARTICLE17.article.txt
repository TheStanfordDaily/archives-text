# Fútbol en Stanford

Stanford Stadium was inundated by crazed football
fans on Saturday. No, the fans weren't there for a
Stanford football game; they weren't even there
for the American version of football. Instead, nearly
50,000 followers flocked to the Farm for a soccer match
between international powers: Chelsea FC and Club
America.
Although Club America started Saturday's match
stronger, quicker, and more together as a team, by the
final whistle U.K. powerhouse Chelsea looked as com
fortable in Stanford Stadium as on its home field at
Stamford Bridge.
The British Premier League Champions were at the
beginning of a preseason training swing through the
United States when they arrived on the Farm this past
weekend. Initially overwhelmed by its opponents from
Mexico City — and perhaps by the fireworks and con
fetti cannons in the America cheering section in the
north end zone — Chelesa gathered strength across its
roster for a 2-1 win. Goals from a player in his first
appearance for Chelsea and from a man who has been
with the team for a decade gave the English the Disney
Friendship Cup.

And, despite gridloek on El Camino
Real until and past kickoff, a reported
crowd of 47,329 watched the clash
between the storied English and
Mexican clubs. A majority of specta
tors sported America's yellow jerseys,
but there was also a vocal Chelsea con
tingent, along with many local families
who have been deprived of profession
al soccer matches since the San Jose-
Earthquakes moved to Houston in
2005.
America pressed Chelsea from the
beginning and it paid off three minutes
into the match when midfielder Juan
Carlos Mosqueda ricocheted a shot off
Chelsea captain John Terry and past
diving goalkeeper Peter Cech. The

Mexican squad kept up the tempo
through the first half hut did not find
the net again.
Chelsea finally managed to mount
an attack fifteen minutes in, but
America keeper Armando Navarrete
notched several key saves to take a
shutout into halftime.
As an exhibition, the match did not
have the normal three-substitution
limit — a fact both teams took advan
tage of, nearly emptying their benches
at the start of the second half. In total,
16 new players took the field out of the
break and of the starters only
Navarrete and Terry played the entire

90 minutes.
While America pressured the
Chelsea defense with its starters, the
battle between the benches was
another story. America only rarely
ventured into the Chelsea penalty
area in the second half, while its
defenders had their hands full.
Spearheading Chelsea's second
half attack were Saloman Kalou and
African Player of the Year Didier
Drogba — who are both from the
Ivory Coast. Kalou's speed and
Drogba's powerful shot gave the
America defense problems, eventu
ally allowing the Chelsea frontline to
break through. Drogba had a shot
barely knocked wide by the defense
in the 74th minute and only a minute

later Chelsea notched its first goal.
Navarrete fielded a high ball in
traffic and could not keep control,
dropping it to the feet of Chelsea
forward Florent Malouda — a new
arrival from France, who recently
signed with the English club.
Malouda put the ball past a pair of
fullbacks into the undefended net to
even the score.
The tie only lasted ten minutes,
as Chelsea struck again in the 84th
minute. Kalou won a footrace into
the corner, where he was taken
down by an America defender.
Malouda sent the resulting free kick
arcing into the center, where Man of
the Match Terry headed the ball
emphatically into the back corner of

the net.
America had an opportunity to
even the score with a free kick in
Chelsea's half late in the game, but
the ball rolled through the penalty
area and out of bounds untouched.
Chelsea was satisfied to hold posses
sion as the time ran out, clinching
the 2-1, comeback win.
Chelsea continues its trip through
California this week, highlighted by
a Saturday matchup with the MLS'
Los Angeles Galaxy, in what is
expected to be English superstar
David Beckham's first appearance
with his new American club.
