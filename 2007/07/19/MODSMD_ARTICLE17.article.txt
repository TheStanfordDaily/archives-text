# Fútbol en Stanford

### Rebecca Harlow 
Stanford Stadium was inundated by crazed football
fans on Saturday. No, the fans weren't there for a
Stanford football game; they weren't even there
for the American version of football. Instead, nearly
50,000 followers flocked to the Farm for a soccer match
between international powers: Chelsea FC and Club
America.
Although Club America started Saturday's match
stronger, quicker, and more together as a team, by the
final whistle U.K. powerhouse Chelsea looked as com
fortable in Stanford Stadium as on its home field at
Stamford Bridge.
The British Premier League Champions were at the
beginning of a preseason training swing through the
United States when they arrived on the Farm this past
weekend. Initially overwhelmed by its opponents from
Mexico City — and perhaps by the fireworks and con
fetti cannons in the America cheering section in the
north end zone — Chelesa gathered strength across its
roster for a 2-1 win. Goals from a player in his first
appearance for Chelsea and from a man who has been
with the team for a decade gave the English the Disney
Friendship Cup.

And, despite gridloek on El Camino
Real until and past kickoff, a reported
crowd of 47,329 watched the clash
between the storied English and
Mexican clubs. A majority of specta
tors sported America's yellow jerseys,
but there was also a vocal Chelsea con
tingent, along with many local families
who have been deprived of profession
al soccer matches since the San Jose-
Earthquakes moved to Houston in
2005.
America pressed Chelsea from the
beginning and it paid off three minutes
into the match when midfielder Juan
Carlos Mosqueda ricocheted a shot off
Chelsea captain John Terry and past
diving goalkeeper Peter Cech. The

Mexican squad kept up the tempo
through the first half hut did not find
the net again.
Chelsea finally managed to mount
an attack fifteen minutes in, but
America keeper Armando Navarrete
notched several key saves to take a
shutout into halftime.
As an exhibition, the match did not
have the normal three-substitution
limit — a fact both teams took advan
tage of, nearly emptying their benches
at the start of the second half. In total,
16 new players took the field out of the
break and of the starters only
Navarrete and Terry played the entire
