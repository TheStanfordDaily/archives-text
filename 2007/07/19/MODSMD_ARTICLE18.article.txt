## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Barboza flies international 
### ERIK ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team may have to wait until
late August to begin its 2007 cam
paign. but outside hitter Cynthia
Barbo/a isn't biding her time until
another national championship
bid — instead, she's gone interna
tional.
Coming off a stellar sopho
more season in which she
returned from a torn ACL to lead
the Cardinal in both kills and
aces, Barboza is taking her show
on the road. One would think that
after playing 110 of 111 games this
season and becoming an All-Pac
-10 team member and a first-team
All-American, the rising junior
would take a break and catch her
breath for next season.
But think again. The closest
thing to a break for Barboza was a
beach trip with teammate Bryn
Kehoe in late April. But the duo
wasn't looking to catch a few rays
in San Diego. Instead, the pair
represented Stanford in the
Powerade Collegiate Beach

Volleyball Championships. They
defeated Cal Poly easily in the
semifinals, 21-16, 21-12, before
losing an intense match to
Nebraska in the finals 21-19, 21-
23, 16-18 to take second.
Returning to the Farm,
Barboza finished up the spring
season and her final exams. And
with the academic year over,
Barboza packed her bags again
and headed down to Mexico.
Finally getting to take that
vacation? Nope. Barboza was
joining the U.S. Women's
National Team at the Sixth
Annual Pan-American Cup in
Colima.
Things started slowly for Team
USA when it dropped its first
game to Argentina, 17-25.
Barboza got the team rolling soon
after, though, delivering three
kills during a key, 7-3 run. After a
25-20 victory in the second game,
Barboza again led the offense in
the third for a 25-23 USA win.
The Americans took the fourth

game easily, 25-16, and Barboza
finished the match with 15 points
and 13 kills.
Immediately challenged by the
best in the world, Barboza had to
adapt her play to the international
atmosphere.
"International volleyball is on a
different level than college volley
ball in the U. 5.," Barboza said.
"Every day you are pushing your
self to a new level, pushing your
self to do things you've never done
before in some of the toughest
competitive situations you have
ever seen."
But Barboza and the rest of team
USA seemed up to the challenge, as
they defeated Costa Rica (25-14,25-
15, 25-13), Trinidad and Tobago
(25-8, 25-9, 25-5) and Mexico (25-
18, 25-12, 25-11) to finish pool play
undefeated. Barboza did not play
against Trinidad, but powered the
Americans when she was on the
court: 10 points, five kills, four aces
and five digs against Costa Rica, fol
lowed up by 13 points, nine kills and

three aces against Mexico; she also
recorded a block in each of those
matches.
Things got tough for Team
USA in the semifinals, however, as
Brazil handily defeated the
Americans 25-15,25-15,25-18. The
U.S. then dropped the third-place
match to the Dominican Republic,
although it was a much more tight
ly contested affair at 25-19, 26-28,
25-18, 28-26. Barboza was again
excellent for the U.S., notching 10
points on nine kills against the
Dominicans.
While cut short from a top fin
ish, Barboza knows that playing
with the national team is some
thing special and she is cherishing
every moment of it.
"Playing with the national team
has always been a great honor,"
she said. "Every day you get the
chance to play with and against the
best players in the world and that
experience is invaluable."
Barboza has yet another chance
to get that experience this summer
as she continues with the national
team. The American women are
currently in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

for the Pan-American Games.
There, Barboza continued to
impress with 26 kills over the first
three matches. Team USA faced
Brazil yesterday to start the medal
round, but fell short, 25-13, 25-20,
25-20.
While Barboza's hopes to take
home a medal are limited to
bronze now (Team USA chal
lenges for it today in Brazil), she
knows that her dip into the inter
national scene this summer has
made her a better player in prepa
ration for NCAA competition.
"Every day out here with the
[national] team, I learn a lot from
the veteran players around me,"
Barboza said. "1 am just trying to
soak up the whole experience and
use it to my advantage when I get
back to [Stanford]."
Barboza will continue to train
and compete with the national
team this summer. Eventually the
team's roster will be trimmed
down for the 2008 Summer
Olympic Games in Beijing, China.
