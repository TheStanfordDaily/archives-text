## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Barboza flies international 
### ERIK ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team may have to wait until
late August to begin its 2007 cam
paign. but outside hitter Cynthia
Barbo/a isn't biding her time until
another national championship
bid â€” instead, she's gone interna
tional.
Coming off a stellar sopho
more season in which she
returned from a torn ACL to lead
the Cardinal in both kills and
aces, Barboza is taking her show
on the road. One would think that
after playing 110 of 111 games this
season and becoming an All-Pac
-10 team member and a first-team
All-American, the rising junior
would take a break and catch her
breath for next season.
But think again. The closest
thing to a break for Barboza was a
beach trip with teammate Bryn
Kehoe in late April. But the duo
wasn't looking to catch a few rays
in San Diego. Instead, the pair
represented Stanford in the
Powerade Collegiate Beach

Volleyball Championships. They
defeated Cal Poly easily in the
semifinals, 21-16, 21-12, before
losing an intense match to
Nebraska in the finals 21-19, 21-
23, 16-18 to take second.
Returning to the Farm,
Barboza finished up the spring
season and her final exams. And
with the academic year over,
Barboza packed her bags again
and headed down to Mexico.
Finally getting to take that
vacation? Nope. Barboza was
joining the U.S. Women's
National Team at the Sixth
Annual Pan-American Cup in
Colima.
Things started slowly for Team
USA when it dropped its first
game to Argentina, 17-25.
Barboza got the team rolling soon
after, though, delivering three
kills during a key, 7-3 run. After a
25-20 victory in the second game,
Barboza again led the offense in
the third for a 25-23 USA win.
The Americans took the fourth
