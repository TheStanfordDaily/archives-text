# The 						(Barry) Bonds that break us
## 
### 
your eyes.
You, the Cincinatti Reds fan who
openly encourages his son to boo
one of the greatest athletes of our
time.
You. the overly righteous sports
writer who criticizes and ostracizes
the very man he was praising just
years ago.
You, the major-league player
who knows very well just how
juiced-up today's game is, yet
decides to place all of his misguided
anger on an outcast of a player — a
player who might be the best of all
time.
You, the commissioner who
turned a blind eye to the juiced era
during the '90s and into the first half
of this decade.
But most of all, you. Yes, you. If
you watch baseball, then there's a
good chance I'm talking to you.
You, the fan who digs the long ball,
the fan who cried tears of joy when
McGwire and Sosa left Roger Maris
in the dust and who stood in awe at
Barry's 73 home runs during the
2001 campaign. You're the very
same hypocrite in the stands now,
trying to demean one of the greatest
players of all time by waving a silly
homemade asterisk.
Open your eyes, all of you.
With Bonds just a few homers shy
of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time
home-run record, mixed feelings
and even anger have abounded
around the country. Many think that
Bonds does not "deserve" to break
the record. "He's a cheater," they
say.
Fans around the country, regard
less of their location and team affili
ation (unless that would be San
Francisco) have rallied around dis
dain and hatred for Bonds. And
yeah, he probably did cheat.
The evidence in the Game of
Shadows is convincing and leaves
readers with many of their suspi
cions confirmed. And yes, it's physi
cally evident to the naked eye that
Bonds gained a significant (and sus
picious) amount of weight as his
career progressed.
But what about the other guys?
What about guys like Sammy
Sosa, Mark McGwire, Rafael


Jack
Salisbury
Above the Rim
Palmeiro, and Jason Giambi? They
were all heroes to fans, and for
some reason, they still are. Sosa has
proven an even bigger cheater than
Bonds — who can forget the corked
bat incident in 2003? Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa were
heroes to you, yet Barry Bonds is a
menace and a cheater. Something's
amiss here.
Some of these guys may have
even lied during grand jury testimo
nial, yet they still are held in relative
favor. They're just as big of cheaters
as Bonds —if not bigger —yet
baseball has turned a blind eye to
their situations.
Because, after all. Bonds isn't the
real culprit in this whole ordeal.
The culprit is you. Bud Selig.
You've promoted a juiced game and
reveled in the profits of a juiced
product. And now, caught up in the
gusts of a media storm with feelings
of self-righteousness, you threaten
to not even show up to one of the
game's most historic moments.
It's you, Curt Schilling. You've
competed in a juiced game for years
and know it. You might not have
been using steroids yourself, but
you're definitely aware of how it
affects the game. Yet you still have
the immature and pathological urge
to call attention to yourself by blast
ing Bonds over the radio.
It's you, the media who did its
best to portray Bonds as a darling
during his 2001 run and now ostra
cizes him at every possible turn.
It's you, the fan who willingly
turned a blind eye to steroids back
when Sammy and Mark were mak
ing history. But now that Barry's
doing it, it's a threat to your morals,

your children, and the sanctity of
baseball.
It's all of us. We all caused this
mess, yet in nearly biblical fashion,
all of the fame (or infamy) is resting
on one man's shoulders.
And if you ask me, I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of hearing people irra
tionally demean Bonds' career. I'm
sick of hearing about steroids.
I understand that they're a part
of the game — it's not something
that I relish, but I do live with it.
Nearly every sport is going to have
issues with performance-enhancing
drugs, but does baseball need to
take it to McCarthy-like propor
tions?
Because that's all this really is. A
modern-day witch hunt directed at
one of the game's best players of all
time — whether or not he cheated
and whether or not he holds both
home run records. What we have
right now is the American mob
mentality at its finest.
Many fans have already dis
missed Bonds before he even
breaks the record. Never has such
apathy been seen for the breaking
of a record so hallowed and sacred.
As for me? I'm going to watch
Bonds break the record. And, I'm
going to enjoy it. I'm going to
appreciate his record for what it is
— a remarkable accomplishment in
a period of increased power and hit
ting.
It may pale in comparison to the
marks of Ruth and Aaron, but it is
what it is.
As for the rest of you who don't
plan on watching: You might miss
out on history, but just be aware
that you're the ones who helped
make it.
