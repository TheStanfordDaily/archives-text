# The
						(Barry) Bonds that break us
## 
### 
your eyes.
You, the Cincinatti Reds fan who
openly encourages his son to boo
one of the greatest athletes of our
time.
You. the overly righteous sports
writer who criticizes and ostracizes
the very man he was praising just
years ago.
You, the major-league player
who knows very well just how
juiced-up today's game is, yet
decides to place all of his misguided
anger on an outcast of a player â€” a
player who might be the best of all
time.
You, the commissioner who
turned a blind eye to the juiced era
during the '90s and into the first half
of this decade.
But most of all, you. Yes, you. If
you watch baseball, then there's a
good chance I'm talking to you.
You, the fan who digs the long ball,
the fan who cried tears of joy when
McGwire and Sosa left Roger Maris
in the dust and who stood in awe at
Barry's 73 home runs during the
2001 campaign. You're the very
same hypocrite in the stands now,
trying to demean one of the greatest
players of all time by waving a silly
homemade asterisk.
Open your eyes, all of you.
With Bonds just a few homers shy
of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time
home-run record, mixed feelings
and even anger have abounded
around the country. Many think that
Bonds does not "deserve" to break
the record. "He's a cheater," they
say.
Fans around the country, regard
less of their location and team affili
ation (unless that would be San
Francisco) have rallied around dis
dain and hatred for Bonds. And
yeah, he probably did cheat.
The evidence in the Game of
Shadows is convincing and leaves
readers with many of their suspi
cions confirmed. And yes, it's physi
cally evident to the naked eye that
Bonds gained a significant (and sus
picious) amount of weight as his
career progressed.
But what about the other guys?
What about guys like Sammy
Sosa, Mark McGwire, Rafael
