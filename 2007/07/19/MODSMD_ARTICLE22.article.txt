## PREDICTING THE FUTURE...OF HARRY BY MERLIN'S BEARD: The Deathly Hallows Foretold 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION DEATH EATER 
On July 21st, 2(X)7, the world will hold its
breath. At midnight, parents will grudgingly
revoke any form of bed time and across the globe
the young and young at heart will sit up all night
to answer one question: what happens in" Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows?" All hand
wringing aside, much of this question can already
be answered with some degree of certainty. The
3.341 pages of the six books already in canon
hold many veiled clues pertaining directly to the
conclusion to the series. By closely examining
these traces — as well as probable homage, the
hero's journey, and Rowling's public statements,
— and then filling in the gaps with educated
guesses, it is possible to form a semi-complete,
highly-probable vision of the events that will
transpire in the seventh and final book.
First of all, it's important to establish the
finality of Dumbledore's death. Rowling has
made it abundantly clear that death is as final in
the wizard world as it is in the muggle one. That
is not to say, however, that Dumbledore will not
play a role in the book. In Sorcerer's Stone,
Harry receives a Chocolate Frog card of
Dumbledore, but Dumbledore's face on the
card eventually leaves. In the first hundred pages
of the series, Rowling has planted an important
tool for the final lxx)k. In Order of the Phoenix
when Dumbledore is replaced as Headmaster of
Hogwarts and Chief Warlock of the
Wizengamot, he declares that he's fine with the
demotions as long as they "don't take him off the
chocolate frog cards." At the beginning of
Deathly Hallows, Harry will open a chocolate
frog card during his obligatory stay at the
Dursleys and discover that Dumbledore has
traveled from his portrait in the headmaster's
office to the frog card. He will continue to advise
Harry throughout the story from this convenient
manifestation — like a wizard cell phone.
During the summer, Harry will undertake a
trip to Godric's Hollow, the place where his par
ents were killed. Rowling was recently asked if
the name Godric's Hollow had anything to do

with Gryffindor house founder Godric
Gryffindor. She replied, "I'm impressed."
Voldemort is believed to have used a relic from
each of the Hogwarts house founders (i.e.,
Slytherin's locket or Hufflepuffs cup), yet the
Gryffindor relic is still unknown. It will probably
lie discovered, captured, and destroyed very
early in the seventh b<x)k. The destruction of a
Gryffindor horcrux will leave Harry with three
more horcruxes to find and four more to destroy
(we know that one of the seven still resides with
in Voldemort). This is of course taking into
account Tom Riddle's diary, which was
destroyed in The Chamber of Secrets, as well as
Marvolo Gaunt's ring, which was destroyed by
Dumbledore sometime between Order of the
Phoenix and Half-Bl<x>d Prince.
Dumbledore's own speculations point in very
logical directions to find the three remaining hor
cruxes. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry and
Dumbledore discover fake locket in a sea cave,
only to discover that the true horcrux has already
been found by someone identified as R.A.B. Of
course, R.A.B. is Regulus Arcturus Black,
younger brother of Sirius Black. This is evinced
by a study of the many translations of the books.
In editions where 'Black' is translated, for
example, to 'Mustra' in the Finnish edition, the
letters R.A.B. are replaced by the obvious
R.A.M. If Regulus was able to destroy the
locket, which is doubtful, there are only two
more horcruxes. If not, the locket found in the
Black House (which now belongs to Harry) dur
ing Order of the Phoenix roughly matches the
description.
Dumbledore believes that Nagini is quite
possibly a horcrux, created on the night that
Voldemort killed Frank Bryce. The snake
played a vital role in the resurrection of
Voldemort by sustaining him with her "milk"
and the two seem to share an intimate bond (the
fact that they are both snake-like raises ques
tions about just how intimate). The final hor
crux is almost certainly Hufflepuffs cup as it

is the only relic that has been
developed to any extent.
Assertions that Harry could

be the final Horcrux arc fundamentally flawed in
that Voldemort has been bent on killing Harry
since his resurrection, and he would surely not
want to destroy a seventh of this soul.
Furthermore, accidental horcrux creation seems
unlikely, not to mention the fact that it would
necessitate Harry's death — something that will
be discussed later.
Snape is certainly still employed by the Order
of the Phoenix. Despite his seemingly evil actions
in Half-Blood Prince, several factors point to his
irrefutable innocence. ITiere are several individ
ual instances that cement Snape's overall good
intentions, many of which occur in Order of the
Phoenix. Snape tells Harry what it is like to lie to

Voldemort, as if Snape has
experience. "The Dark
Lord, for instance,

almost always knows
when somebody is
lying to him. Only
those skilled at

Occulumency [i.e.
Snape] are able to
shut down those

feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and
so utter falsehoods in his presence without detec
tion."
Rowling is using this exchange to explain how
Snape is able to lie to the powerful Voldemort
without detection. The events at the conclusion
of Half-Blood Prince are perhaps the hardest to
explain away, yet even they can be justified.
Snape kills Dumbledore (in fact Dumbledore
begs him to, "Please, Severus,") because this is
the most advantageous course of action for the
Order of the Phoenix and for Harry.
Furthermore, Snape does not kill Harry when
Harry tries to stop him after Dumbledore's mur
der. Snape refuses to jinx Harry but also refuses
to allow himself to be called a coward. Snape is
not a Judas; he's more of a Jack Bauer ... a big,
greasy Jack Bauer.
In children's literature in general, the char
acters with the bleakest outlooks on life are the
ones that perish. It makes their disappearance
ultimately more manageable. Snape has no
family or friends to speak of, and therefore
would benefit very little from living. He's cer
tainly dead. Similarly, Wormtail and the
Malfoys have nothing to lose and will die as
well. The same is true of Neville.
On the other side of that reasoning, Harry
must live. Despite an overwhelming poetic jus
tice that would be served by him dying, he will
live. Similarly, protagonists in children's litera
ture always survive, and he has so much too live
for. Hagrid would have died, until Rowling
wrote Maxime into the story, giving him a rea
son to survive.
Obviously, Voldemort dies. Evil mast be van
quished. At the end of Deathly Hallows, the
Weasleys will become Ham's surrogate family.

Harry will, with McGonogall's help ("I will

assist you to become an Auror if it is that

last thing I do!"), be accepted to the Auror
department of the Ministry Magic. He
will begin Auror training and use those
skills to hunt down the remaining death
eaters. Arthur Weasley will become the

new minister of magic.
At midnight on July 21st. all specula
tion will be silenced when one of the
most anticipated books of all time is
released in the biggest popular culture
event in recent memory. It's going to be
epic, and anything that Rowling has, in
fact, written, will he sure to surprise
even the best predictions.
If anyone wants to send Loren the
7th book in Tanzania, he would great
ly appreciate it. Just no tellsies!
