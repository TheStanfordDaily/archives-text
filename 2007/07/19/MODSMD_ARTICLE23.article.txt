# ALBUM REVIEW
## My Spoon is too big: indie rock review 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION SPOONER 
Spoon is perhaps one of inde
pendent music's most accessible
groups of artists. When 1 saw them
live at the Pitchfork Music Festival
last year, the crowd was huge, and
filled with people coming to see them
from all across the United States. The
audience was as diverse as a music
festival based in the Midwest could
be. Nonetheless, two scantily clad
girls who seemed about 17-years-old
stood out among the dominantly
skinny, white male independent
music lovers. Before Spoon s set, they
were animatedly expressing their
enthusiasm for Spoon's arrival.
"Oh my God!" one said to anoth
er, "I can't believe we're finally going
to see Spoon!" In the 30 minutes of
waiting for Spoon, the two loud girls

revealed to anyone who within a 20-
foot radius that they had driven eight
hours just to see Spoon. Even more
remarkable was what happened dur
ing the set: amongst a sea of men who
didn't even try to hob their head to the
music, the two shimmied and grinded
to "My Mathematical Mind" and
"The Way We Get By."
Happily, Spoon's latest album,
"Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga" lives up to its pre
decessors, "Gimme Ficton" and "Kill
the Moonlight." "Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga"
is perhaps a little bit inferior to
Spoon's previous two albums as it is a
little less original than the other two;
the new album feels in many ways like
the logical extension of "Gimme
Fiction." Nevertheless, the latest
effort of the Austin, Texas-based
band, their sixth full record to date, is
charmingly fun and playful, as the
album's name readily suggests.

Because of its mixture of playful
ness and confidence, "Ga Ga Ga Ga
Ga" feels like a record that Spoon
front man Britt Daniel has always
wanted to do, but never got around
to creating. Witness the first track,
"Don't Make Me A Target." In it,
Daniel sings nonsensically of
"nuclear dicks with their dialect
drawls" and a man who "smells the
inside of closets upstairs / The kind
where nobody goes." As an opener,
the song was slightly disappointing,
because of how similar it is to songs
on Spoon's previous albums. Despite
its strengths, the song still feels a little
bland, because its the same old
Spoon: slick, repeated guitar with
well balanced, sharp drums backing
up the sound.
But my feeling of disappointment
dissipated by the album's second song,
"The Ghost of You Lingers." Starting

with a series of repeated keyboard
chords, the song quickly diverges from
Spoon's past with an enigmatic,
haunting foghorn-like sound that sets
the mood perfectly for a song that
asks: "Would you ease my mind / The
ghost of you lingers."
The third song, "You Got Yr.
Cherry Bomb," illuminates the
bands' liveliness. In this light and play
ful song, Daniel asks for his listener to:
"Blow out that cherry bomb for me /
It's gonna burn right up your sleeve."
Several songs later, "Eddie's Ragga"
features some of the most memorable
lines of the album. Imposed on top of
alternating guitar riffs and hi-hat,
Daniel sings of a woman who told the
singer: "It's hopeless I'm a slut for the
New York Times / She made my heart
soft, wore an aiguillette on her arm /
She never been to Texas, never heard
of King Kong."

Despite (or perhaps because of) its
fun atmosphere, "Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga"
has its flaws. Several songs are too
similar to Spoon's previous work and
other songs like, "Don't you Evah,"
get a little boring towards the middle.
Nonetheless, "Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga" pro
vides highly accessible independent
music that is both exciting and enter
taining. Fortunately for Spoon, the
album's sense of fun will keep its fans
happy. And this, of course, means that
those amusing scantily-clad girls will
be coming back for more.
