### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION CHUCKER 
"I Now Pronounce You Chuck
and Larry" is like "Green Card"
meets "the Birdcage"— only a little
less tasteful and featuring Adam
Sandler. To be clear, managing expec

tations is critical when approaching
this movie. If you expect a cinematic
experience which forgoes cheap
laughs or has a transformative impact
on gender relations, you'll he very dis
appointed with this movie...and, gen
erally speaking, with life.
However, if you assess "1 Now

Pronounce You Chuck & Larry" with
the Adam Sandler-movie-quality lit
mus test, you'll be pretty freakin'
blown away. Yes, on that level, it's tol
erable summer movie-fare— don't
all rush to the theater at once, now.
Still grieving widow Larry
Valentine (Kevin James of "King of

Queens" and "Hitch" fame) finds
himself unable to extend his firefight
er pension to his children unless he
remarries due to a technicality in the
insurance system. Now, before you
check to make sure you didn't wander
into Michael Mix>re's healthcare beat
down, "Sicko," here's where things
get interesting. Rather than con
fronting the ridiculous bureaucracy
head on, Larry opts to alleviate his
plight by climbing aboard "the dude
train." Having conveniently saved
life-long bud and fellow firefighter
Chuck's (Sandler) life the day before,
Larry cashes in all his guilt chips and
makes Chuck file for a civil union,
thus entitling him to Larry's pension
benefits. Seems like the thing to do.
Aside from the logical limitations,
this set-up doesn't seem bold, absurd,
or even fresh for 20()7. Countless sit
coms and movies have done the whole
'playing gay' routine. From the forced
dude-on-dude kiss, the expectation to
dance well, and the final epiphany
about the importance of acceptance
— been there, done that.
"Chuck and Larry" proves at least
moderately amusing in that it's rife
with jokes outside of the film's basic
premise. Sure, plenty of bits fall flat:
"Ugly Betty" has cornered the market
on the prepubescent boys with ... er,
flamboyant tendencies — Larry's
budding thespian of a son joke seems
worn. And Rob Schneider, decked
out in pseudo-yellowface as an Asian-
Canadian rabbi, has secured an indeli

ble place in my nightmares for the
foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the
film presents enough unexpected,
albeit crass, gags to remain fresh for its
nearly two-hour running time. It helps
that every actor, ever, in the history of
film seems to make a cameo in this
Hick. I think 1 was even featured
briefly in the film's closing half-hour.
True story.
Finally, by nestling "Chuck and
Larry" safely in the pit of medioc
rity, the film avoids even attempting
to draw deep conclusions or to
preach in favor of alternative
lifestyles or norms of tolerance. Too
often, lowbrow films betray their
own foundations by forging a last
ditch, half-assed closing act attempt
to impart wisdom of redeeming
social value. This film mercifully
makes no attempt to even remotely
reflect the challenges of coming out
— beyond having trouble finding
dudes willing to play pickup basket
ball with you. Thankfully here, the
pedantic soap box only extends as
far as Sandler proclaiming, "Don't
say f-[okay, this is one f-word I'm
actually not spelling out], it's hurt
ful." Because the movie doesn't
attempt to go outside it's potty town
boundaries, at least the movie
remains consistent and true to its
own skeezy origins.
Hey, given a summer of sequels
and the canon of Adam Sandler
flicks...there are worse things to do
with two hours of your life.
