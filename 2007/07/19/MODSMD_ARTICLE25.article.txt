## A 						few strokes short of a master work 
### DAN HIRSCH INTERMISSION PAINTER 
Told through the eyes one of
Spain's most revered great masters,
Francisco Goya, "Goya's Ghosts"
tells a sweeping tale about Spain at
the end of the Inquisition and in the
midst of Napoleonic wars with
France. It is chock lull of corrupt
priests, torture, political intrigue,
good-looking period costumes, and
scenes of the artist at work. In the
hands of writer-director Milos
Forman and producer Saul Zaentz,
who collaborated on such award
winning films as "One Hew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and
"Amadeus" (19N4), the film is as
beautifully rendered and as well
crafted as a Goya master work.
However, it lacks the visceral and
emotional power of the expressionis
tic style that made Goya famous.
Forman and Zaentz create an film
that attempts to understand a tumul
tuous historical moment. It is a fasci
nating time, especially given contem
porary political circumstances. The
topical parallels are hard to miss: reli

gious fanaticism, the use of torture to
produce testimony, etc. At one point,
a French officer rallies his troops
before invading Spain by telling
them that the Spanish people will see
them as liberators and "throw flow
ers at their feet."
Javier Bardem, Natalie Portman
and Stellan Skarsgard perform ade
quately; however, the film lacks the
concentrated obsession that Salieri
aims at Mozart in "Amadeus" or the
ferocity with which the inmates revolt
against Nurse Ratched in "Cuckoo's
Nest." Portman takes on double duty
in the second half of the film, playing
both a deranged Ines, released from
fifteen years in the Church's prison,
as well as a young courtesan. Though
she successfully creates two distinct
characters, they both come off as
rather flat and one-sided. Bardem's
Brother Lorenzo, who shifts alliances
and commits various evil deeds to get
ahead, merely broadcasts sliminess
rather than ambition. We do not get
the sense that a deep force within
Lorenzo propels him to action.
Finally, Skarsgard's portrayal of
Goya lacks the torment that we
would expect from a painter known
for his graphic and troubling depic
tions of war. Skarsgard's Goya mere
ly looks bothered as his country
crumbles and he is unable to do any
thing. Perhaps if Forman spent less
time worrying about both depicting
the Napoleonic wars as well as taking
us through various plot twists and
turns, these characters could have

existed in a more profound and cap
tivating way.
For a film called the "Goya's
Ghosts," Forman's film was alto
gether too busy and too messy to be
haunting. When looking at one of
Goya's later works, "Saturn
Devouring his Son," (1820) in which
the terrifyingly bug-eyed and wild
haired Roman god bites off his son's
head, the viewer can feel the aging
artist's growing insanity and the tor
ment of war and violence. Those
frightening eyes and bloody lips stay
with you long after you have looked
away. Though well crafted, "Goya's
Ghosts" does not deliver any such
uhouls.
