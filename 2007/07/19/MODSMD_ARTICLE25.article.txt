## A
						few strokes short of a master work 
### DAN HIRSCH INTERMISSION PAINTER 
Told through the eyes one of
Spain's most revered great masters,
Francisco Goya, "Goya's Ghosts"
tells a sweeping tale about Spain at
the end of the Inquisition and in the
midst of Napoleonic wars with
France. It is chock lull of corrupt
priests, torture, political intrigue,
good-looking period costumes, and
scenes of the artist at work. In the
hands of writer-director Milos
Forman and producer Saul Zaentz,
who collaborated on such award
winning films as "One Hew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and
"Amadeus" (19N4), the film is as
beautifully rendered and as well
crafted as a Goya master work.
However, it lacks the visceral and
emotional power of the expressionis
tic style that made Goya famous.
Forman and Zaentz create an film
that attempts to understand a tumul
tuous historical moment. It is a fasci
nating time, especially given contem
porary political circumstances. The
topical parallels are hard to miss: reli

gious fanaticism, the use of torture to
produce testimony, etc. At one point,
a French officer rallies his troops
before invading Spain by telling
them that the Spanish people will see
them as liberators and "throw flow
ers at their feet."
Javier Bardem, Natalie Portman
and Stellan Skarsgard perform ade
quately; however, the film lacks the
concentrated obsession that Salieri
aims at Mozart in "Amadeus" or the
ferocity with which the inmates revolt
against Nurse Ratched in "Cuckoo's
Nest." Portman takes on double duty
in the second half of the film, playing
both a deranged Ines, released from
fifteen years in the Church's prison,
as well as a young courtesan. Though
she successfully creates two distinct
characters, they both come off as
rather flat and one-sided. Bardem's
Brother Lorenzo, who shifts alliances
and commits various evil deeds to get
ahead, merely broadcasts sliminess
rather than ambition. We do not get
the sense that a deep force within
Lorenzo propels him to action.
