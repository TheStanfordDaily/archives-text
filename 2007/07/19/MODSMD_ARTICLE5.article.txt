## SCIENCE & TECH New SLAC director to take charge 
### CHLOE NICOLAISEN 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) has named Physics Prof. Steven
Kahn as its new director of particle and par
ticle astrophysics. His appointment comes
as current director Persis Drcll steps down
after six years â€” and just in time for a con
tract renewal between SLAC and Stanford.
"There will be a competition to select the
new contractor to manage the laboratory
and Stanford will definitely be in that com
petition," Kahn said. "The commitment to
this project is three to five years, and the
current director feels that after eight years
of service, this would be too long of a com
mitment for him."
In accepting this new position, Kahn will

step down from his role as deputy director
at the Kavli Institute for Particle
Astrophysics and Cosmology but will main
tain his professorships at both Stanford and
SLAC.
"I do want to maintain my teaching
while in this position because students bring
lots of fresh questions, lots of new ideas. It
keeps me on my toes," he said.
Following his official appointment Aug.
1, Kahn plans to promote the growth and
evolution of SLAC's technology.
"I think that SLAC is now a more
diverse laboratory than it has been histori
cally. The historical area of SLAC which is
in particle physics is still a vibrant field, but
it has broadened in recent years to include
particle astrophysics which probes the fun

damental forces of the universe and its con
stituents," he said. "There are numbers of
new experiments we've been developing
which will advance this field."
Kahn also praised how far SLAC has
already come in the field of particle physics.
"SLAC has a very distinguished history
including a large number of Nobel prizes.
We have an outstanding technical staff and
facility," said Kahn. "We are associated
with one of the greatest universities in the
United States. SLAC has a very solid foun
dation and I think we have a very bright
future."
