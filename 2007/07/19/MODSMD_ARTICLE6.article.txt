# FIRE!
## Dish to reopen Sat 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
The walking paths near the
Dish — closed for almost four
weeks — are expected to open
again on Saturday. The popular
trails were closed by the
University after two fires in late
June and early July scorched near
ly 200 acres in the Stanford
foothills.
The Dish will be open from 6
a.m. to 8 p.m. until Aug. 31, though
the area will be closed when the
National Weather Service issues
Red Flag Warnings, which desig
nate days with an exceptionally
high risk of fire.
According to the Stanford
Report, the University is taking
other precautions to safeguard the
Dish area from fire during a partic
ularly dry season. Firebreaks have
been expanded and updated in the
foothills, and fire hydrants will be
installed behind homes on

Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The investigation into the cause
of the 2()-aere July 5 blaze, howev
er, is still pending. Two firefighters
were treated for heat exhaustion at
the fire, but no structural damage
was reported.
"We still don't know the origin
of the July 5 fire," said Stanford
Department of Public Safety
Deputy Chris Cohendet, "and
investigators have not yet deter
mined the cause."
The June 25 fire that burned
171 acres was started by two juve
niles playing with matches.
"Our investigation is conclud
ed," Cohendet said. "If anything
further is to be done, it will be up
to the Santa Clara Juvenile
Probation Department."
Updated information about the
Dish is available at the Foothills
Hotline at (650) 926-0275.
