## Abizaid returns to Farm from D.C. 
### STUART BAIMEL 
If Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice returns to Stanford in
2(X)9, she will not be the only national figure hack on the Farm.
Retired Army Gen. John P. Abizaid, former commander of the
U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), is returning to the
Hoover Institution as its first Annenberg Distinguished Visiting
Fellow.
Abizaid ultimately hopes to teach student seminars, possibly
with former Secretary of Defense and Hoover Fellow William
Perry '49, who is also an engineering professor. In the meantime,
his research will focus on what he described as "national security
structures and organizations for the 21st Century."
National security, he said, is "creaky" and too Cold War
oriented, and needs to be more "agile and flexible" to combat
the threat from non-state actors. Abizaid also championed
greater integration between different agencies — including
defense, intelligence, and diplomacy — in order to effectively
fight terrorism.
He added that his firsthand experience in the Middle East will
better enable him to study policy aimed at reforming the nation
al security apparatus.
Abizaid succeeded Gen. Tommy Franks as commander of
CENTCOM in 2003, overseeing the military in the Middle East,
the Horn of Africa and Central Asia, with
responsibility for 200,000 American
troops.
He also served as a National Security
Fellow at Hoover from 1992-1993, when
he was a Lt. Col. Abizaid called his earlier
experience at Stanford "eye-opening,"
and decided at the end of his three
decades of military experience to return to
the Bay Area, where he was born.
"I love it here," he said.
