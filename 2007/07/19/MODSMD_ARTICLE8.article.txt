# Dunia Moja project bridges continents

### KATHLEEN RYOU 
Stanford may still lack a study abroad
program in Africa, but the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies has
found a different way to bridge the conti
nental divide. The Dunia Moja project —
Swahili for "one world" — enables stu
dents in Africa and at Stanford to collabo
rate via cell phone.
About 25 undergraduate and graduate
students participated in the program's pilot
run this past spring quarter, and the pro
gram is expected to continue into the com
ing year. Stanford partnered with the
University of the Western Cape in South
Africa, Mweka College of African Wildlife

Management in Tanzania and Makerere
University in Uganda.
Participants are equipped with cell
phones donated by Ericsson, and are given
memory chips containing a series of videos
and PowerPoint presentations that they can
watch or listen to on their phones.
Shelley Goldman, professor of educa
tion and principal investigator of Dunia
Moja, said that this approach was more
hands-on and collaborative than the broad
casted series of lectures typical to distance
learning.
"We're testing and designing a new ver
sion of distance learning with mobile tech
nology that also includes global collabora
tion for faculty and students," she said.

Students can also chcx)se to view their
cell phone-provided material on a CD so
that they can print out the slides.
Additionally, they can share text messages
and images, and even make calls while a
class is in session.
The project also includes a mohlog, an
online interface with postings sent directly
from participants' mobile phones.
But there are still some kinks to work
out, according to Victor Vuchic, who pro
vided the technical support for the mohlog.
He said that the project faced connectivity
difficulties in remote parts of Africa.
Despite some technical glitch
es, doctoral student Ugochi
Acholonu believed that the
learning project has been suc
cessful.
"Communicating through the
moblog helped [students] dispel
some misconceptions and stereo
types and broadened [their] per
spectives," Acholonu said.
