## Pearl film sparks debate Friends of alumnus Daniel Pearl criticize "A Mighty Heart" 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Daniel Pearl '85 and Asra Nomani used to talk and
laugh so much at work that The Wall Street Journal's
Washington bureau editors had to separate their desks as
if they were two chatterboxes in kindergarten. For nine
years, the two were colleagues and best friends, sharing
jokes, secrets and words of encouragement. Pearl's
Stanford-era stories were consistently hilarious and his
relationship advice never failed. Nomani warmly
recalled.
On Jan. 23, 2002 the 38-year-old Pearl failed to show
up at Nomani's dinner party in Karachi, Pakistan.
Terrorists had abducted Pearl, who was researching
alleged links between Pakistani intelligence and "shoe
bomber" Richard Reid, as he headed to what he believed
was an interview with a Muslim cleric. Pearl was ultimate
ly beheaded after a month in captivity.
More than a year later, Mariane Pearl published a
first-person account of her desperate attempt to find her
husband, and Hollywood's interest piqued. When
Nomani was approached to serve as a consultant for the
filming of "A Mighty Heart," based on Mariane Pearl's
New York Times bestseller of the same title, she agreed.
She tried to help. She wrote a 200-page chronology.
She says she fought glib Hollywood executives in busi
ness suits for even tiny script changes. But in the end, as
she sat down to watch the film days before its release, she
didn't feel relief or closure. She felt anger — and then
guilt.
"1 was devastated when 1 watched the final movie,"
said Nomani, who currently leads a faculty-student pro
ject investigating Pearl's death at Georgetown
University.
She is not alone. "A Mighty Heart" earned a warm
reception from critics, and Mariane Pearl made public
her support of the production — but the film has been
criticized recently by some of the people who knew Pearl
best.
Howard Kaplan '85, a surgeon in New York and one
of Pearl's closest friends at Stanford, said he was "not
pleased" when he heard the announcement that Brad Pitt
would produce the film, which would star his wife
Angelina Jolie.
Kaplan has not yet seen the movie, and doesn't know
if he will. He said that he doesn't want his memory of
Pearl, who he described as "a sweet individual without a
mean bone in his body," to become tainted by something
that is "quasi-fictional."
"I knew Danny the person," Kaplan said. "When
someone made a movie, Danny became an icon and
Danny the person got completely lost in the media
firestorm."
When contacted by The Daily, Pearl's father, Judea,
declined to directly comment but in his response attached
an essay published by The New Republic, in which he
chastised director Michael Winterbottom's comments
that "A Mighty Heart" and his earlier film "Road to
Guantanamo" were "very similar."
Pearl warned viewers: "I am worried that 'A Mighty
Heart' falls into a trap [...] of moral equivalence."
Nomani also found faults with production's content as'
well.
Around the time of the release
of "A Mighty Heart," Nomani went
against the tide of critical praise
and slammed what she believed
was the filmmakers' failure to
develop Pearl's character, writing
that "Danny himself had been cut
from his own story" in a fiery
Washington Post column.
"The worst thing to me as a friend
of Danny's was that his soul was sac
rificed," she told The Daily.
She said that every supporting
character, including Daniel Pearl,
was subdued to provide contrast for
the leading actress.
"It was made for Angelina,"
Nomani said flatly. "This movie was
used as a vehicle to elevate her star."
For Nomani, the film's faults
didn't stop there. She said a baby in
her house that Mariane Pearl wrote
about in her book was reduced in the
film to nothing more than "a cute

prop for Angelina to kiss."
To promote the movie.
Paramount Pictures even began a
"Nominate the Most Inspiring
Ordinary Hero" contest to choose a
winner to send on a trip to the
Bahamas. The winner of the contest,
Nomani said, would have to relin
quish his "moral rights."
Her list went on.
"At the end of the day this was a
commercial enterprise," she said
dryly. "You can just imagine the
board room where people who arc
3,000 steps removed from the indi
vidual and actual chain of events are
pontificating about the vision that
they see."
Finally, Nomani pointed a finger
at herself. After all, she is arguably
the biggest critic of a movie she
helped make. Why did she collabo
rate with the filmmakers if she had
doubts?
"I deeply felt this responsibility
to Danny to support everything that
Mariane needed and wanted," she
explained. "Now 1 do feel a sense of

guilt for having participated, and
that was why I wrote the Post article
to come clean."
A few days after her column was
published and she appeared on TV
to speak about her reaction to the
film, the outspoken Nomani faded
from headlines and resumed work
ing quietly on her investigation of
Pearl's murder at Georgetown.
"Danny, ultimately, is dead," she
said. "I'm not delusional about what
the movie could've done for him. It
couldn't have brought him back."
But she said she hoped her pub
lic criticism helped present a differ
ent perspective on the story and
provoke thought.
"What troubled me was that for
the rest of us who live on this earth,
we have something sick happening
in the way that we're making com
mercial enterprise out of tragedy,"
she said. "That's something we
need to ponder in society."
