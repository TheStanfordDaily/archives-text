# Science News Roundup
## Brains, STDs and monarchs 
### 
In Marseille, France, a 44-year
old man went to the hospital.
His left leg felt weak, he said.
Doctors ordered a CT scan and
almost fainted at the result: The
patient had almost no brain.
The story was published in
Lancet this week, and the accompa
nying picture (available at
http://www.nature.com/news/2007/
070716/full/070716-15.html) is hor
rifying. The center of the man's
head is a gaping dark hole. His
brain matter is squeezed in a thin
film coating the inside of his skull.
The patient's condition was
cause by hydrocephalus, sometimes
called ''water on the brain."
Normally, fluid swirls around inside
the skull and is drained back into
the circulatory system. With hydro
cephalus, the drainage system gets
backed up, and the resulting Hood
swells the skull and squishes brain
tissue. In childhood, the patient was
treated with a shunt, a special tube
inserted in the brain to release the
trapped fluid. The treatment kept
him alive and healthy, and the dra
matic nature of his true condition
went unnoticed until the recent
brain scan.
What's most surprising about
the case is how little the man's con
dition affected him. His 10 was
tested at 75 â€” which is on the low
end, but nowhere close to dooming
someone to a life spent drooling in
a wheelchair. The man was married

with two kids, and worked as a civil
servant. By all accounts, lie was liv
ing a very normal life.
This case embodies my greatest
fear that there is something horri
bly wrong with my body and 1 am
just prancing around, totally oblivi
ous. One time, 1 had a bizarre
dream that my bones were secretly
made of cheese, and 1 couldn't calm
down for a week. This story doesn't
exactly assuage my fears. The man
has an orange peel for a brain,
when most people have the whole
orange. And he had no idea until
his leg started hurting. It's enough
to make me sign up for a MRI
today.
Prurient news from Down
Under: Australian koalas are in
trouble. The fuzzy animals are
showing up everywhere with blad
der infections, respiratory ailments,
and pinkeye. The cause of these
koala woes? Chlamydia. The sexu
ally transmitted disease can blind
the animals, leave them infertile,
and even kill them outright. But
there's new hope for koalas this
week, because scientists just

announced that trials for a chlamy
dia vaccine will begin soon.
Researchers plan to give the vac
cine to a small number of koalas,
monitoring them for the effective
ness of the shot and any adverse
reactions. If the vaccine works well,
wild koalas could be rounded up
and injected.
Vaccines for sexually transmit
ted diseases are controversial.
Religious conservatives were in a
tizzy this year about Gardasil, the
vaccine that protects women
against genital warts and cervical
cancer. So far, no one seems upset
about vaccinating koalas. However,
the koala vaccine was developed
using research done towards a
chlamydia vaccine for humans.
Maybe the protesters will hit the
streets if the drug comes out for
people.
From STDs to monarchs: Queen
bees exert impressive control over
their subjects. The workers feed
their queen and groom her, bravely
die for her in battles with neighbor
ing hives, and even stamp out their
own childbearing aspirations to care
for her brood. To keep her under
lings in check, the queen emits a
bouquet of powerful pheromones.
Researchers announced this week
that the queen's chemical cocktail
keeps worker bees from becoming
disgruntled.

To study the insects,
researchers made use of electric
shocks and itty-bitty bee hand
cuffs. They strapped the bees
down, and sent a puff of a particu
lar odor along with a mild electric
shock. The agitated bees extended
their stingers. After a few repeti
tions, the bees brandished their
stingers at the smell alone.
But bees exposed to the queen's
pheromones behaved differently.
They never learned to associate the
shock with the odor, and they
wouldn't extrude their stingers in
response to the smell alone. The
bees could still associate smells
with food, showing that the queen's
pheromones specifically blocked
the bees from forming negative
associations. The queen is actually
chemically preventing the workers
from learning to hate her! A lot of
company bosses might enjoy that
ability.
