# Holt's Harangue
## Sports scandal at Camp Woodchuck 
### 
As the head counselor in
charge of sports activities
here at Camp Woodchuck, I
warn to come forward and acknowl
edge that there is an investigation as
to whether or not one of our sports
counselors fixed capture the flag
games.
1 his is one of the most serious sit
uations. no, the most serious situa
tion that I have ever experienced in
my life. My sense of betrayal is
immense. 1 have cried quietly under
my bunk for days, refusing food,
water, and lanyard making. If we
can't get our counselors to play fair,
well I might as well trade in my
whistle and become an arts and
crafts instructor. No offense, Ms.
Perkins.
Wc take this investigation very
seriously, and I can tell you today
that we will do everything we can to
find out the truth. All sports activi
ties have been canceled until we can
get to the bottom of this. Instead, we
will have a four-hour arts and crafts
slot. I believe the activity today is
wallet-making.
This is a betrayal of the trust of
capture the flag fans, families, and
the greater camp counselor com
munity. I'm not sure if the wounds
can ever be healed, but I wanted to
come forward and explain the
facts.
Over the course of the last few
weeks, points have been shaved,
calls have been made and flags have
been hidden in illegal places to
ensure that certain outcomes came
out. 1 won't even get into the rumors
that people were tagged "out" and
never reported for jail.
As we are all aware, the alleged
counselor officiated the game where
the Number One seed Denver
Dudes were upset by the 16 seed
Ninja Killers in round one. He was

also present for the late-game calls
of the infamous match between the
Delta Girl Squad and t ho
Interstellar Funk Stars. Perhaps
Cabin Two had a reason to be para
noid. for the fix may have been in.
At this point, we have not decided
to nullify any of the results, so calls
for the Pirates of Cabin Six to turn
in their victory bandanas are
uncalled for. Right now. they can
keep their trophy and their positions
at the head of the lunch line.
While we do not know at this
time the exact motivations for all of
the counselor's alleged actions, I've
had a counselor-to-counselor pow
wow with him and he's told his side
of the story. He said that the Ninja
Killers bribed him with their share
of afternoon snacks, and we've
always known that this particular
counselor loved his individual serv
ings of pudding. Ninja Killers,
you're on trash duty for a week. In
regards to the Funk Stars, he admit
ted his motivation was because he
thinks one of their players is "a little
prick."
No, we have no confirmation at
this time that the counselor had any
ties to our rival camp, Camp
Superstar, though we are investigat
ing possible links. We encourage all
campers not to spread rumors but to
get really excited for our annual
camp field day where we'll once
again prove our superiority to those
insufferable Superstar Campers. Go
Woodchuck!
This is serious business, folks,
and 1 don't want to leave any doubt
as to the severity of ihe accusations.
If the investigations prove to be
true, then the counselor will be
stripped of his sports counselor
whistle and will possibly lose his
canoe privileges as well.
After the investigation finishes.

we will see if there are changes that
can be made to our officiating
process and perhaps our hiring
process. Cynics will point out that
we control minute things like man
dating campers wear shoes and team
colors during the game; yet, they
argue, we struggle to control major
things like fairly officiating the
games. However, this is not an
excuse to stop wearing shoes in the
dining hall: I'm looking at you,
Cabin Nine.
This was an isolated case of a
criminal individual and not at all
indicative of the caliber of the rest of
the camp staff or corruption of the
sanctity of the camp spirit. In no way
is it possible that other counselors
could be bribed, distracted by co
counselors in bikinis, or otherwise
compromised in their judgment in
officiating games ever again.
Brave Chief Woodchuck is still
our camp mascot, and we still
believe in loyalty, honesty and
friendship. People may wonder why
we've all had this long meeting when
these are just games and this is just a
summer camp, but these are ideals
that we live by and should be taken
seriously. 1 do have some good
news, however, as tonight instead of
sloppy joes we'll be serving tacos.
Get excited!

Chris thinks it's a damn shatne what's

Suns fan he's not surprised. Send
