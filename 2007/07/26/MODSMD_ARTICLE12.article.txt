## An open letter to Chinese adverting executives 
### 
To Whom It May Concern: My
name is Nathaniel Hillard.
Perhaps you have heard of me
— I really am quite the celebrity in
the Xi'An Community Access
Channel circuit. You might well have
seen my special on American col
leges, in which 1 lecture to a half
filled auditorium of controlling par
ents and pre-teenagers about the
importance of the SAT.
Being such a distinguished per
sonage, I thought it appropriate to
offer commentary on the current
advertising trends of the mainland.
Not to mention, 1 hail from America,
the land in which advertising knows
no limits.
Allow me to say right off the bat
that 1 love what you've done with the
city of Shanghai. Neon really is the
light of the future, and your efforts to
literally paint the town red (albeit
with a sickening glow of unnatural
light) seem to be paying off. In
America, we have the phrase "burn
into your memory." You take this to
new levels.
Your talent for turning night into
day is apparent in Shenzhen, as well,
though to a somewhat lesser degree.
I worry about a pesky thing called
"discretion," which should of course
be avoided at all costs in the advertis
ing world. Turning the lights off at 10
p.m. may well be a way to appease
the grandmas of the world, but you
are missing out on valuable advertis
ing time. The hours from 10 p.m. to 5
a.m. are golden, and can help you
capture the drunkard, pervert, and
drug addict demographic — a largely
untapped goldmine of consumer
buying power.
But I think 1 should move on to
what really amounts to an "elephant
in the room," the issue of cartoon
spokespeople. I must say that this is
the area in which we part ways. I am
frankly quite disappointed with the
number of products marketed by car
toon characters in China. Simply put,
this number is too low. We need to
take a page from the book of our
neighbor to the east, and expand the
cartoon mascot market to literally
include everything with some sort of
visible surface.
Sadly, China is in such a state that
only public utilities, beverages, meat
products, toiletries, paper products,
cigarettes, books, video games, web
sites, greeting cards, maternity wear,
children, home decor, garden and
patio furniture and (last but certainly
not least) diabetic supplies feature
cartoon-themed packaging.
If there is anything the Japanese
market has taught us, it is that cute
ness sells — everything. Don't be dis
couraged by what we call GT, or
"Good Taste." GT may be appropri
ate for such extreme circumstances
as, say, the marketing of cancer ther
apy drugs, but I see little need to hold
back from selling everything else
with the aid of large-eyed, macro
cephalic mascots. Our ideal model
here is of course that of Hello Kitty.
Perhaps some tips arc in order to
ensure maximum cuteness. Though

doubtless you already know much of
this, perhaps the reason for your
dearth of cartoon advertisements is
that you have never seen cuteness
codified.
An important specification to
keep in mind is "The Golden Ratio."
This refers to the mathematic ratio of
the diameter of an effective mascot's
head (in centimeters) to its eye size
and its body length. This proportion
should roughly be 3:2:1. Implied here
but not explicitly stated is that all
three of these regions should be as
circular as possible.
Remember as well to create friends
for your mascot. Your box of denture
glue simply wouldn't be complete
without a whole cast of characters,
and even a storyline. Let's create a
hypothetical mascot and call him
"No-Teeth." He is a comically elder
ly man, surely nearing his end hut
still genial, with unnecessarily puck
ered lips and oversized glasses. No-
Teeth's problem is that his dentures
keep falling out of his mouth, and
various animals keep getting a hold
of them.
Luckily, No-Teeth is friends with
one of the animals, a boa constrictor
snake named Skanky. On every box,
Skankv helps No-Teeth find his den
tures by fatally wounding and then
slowly digesting whatever animal has
happened to pick No-Teeth's teeth
that day. This need not be gruesome
— simply comically exaggerate the
resulting lump in Skanky's body.
This brings up a related point,
and surely one that you well under
stand, relating to age, gender, and
cultural sensitivity. Yesterday, while
out shopping, I found a product
entitled "Heißen YaGao," or
"Black people toothpaste." Its mas
cot, Darlie, is an African American
man wearing a tuxedo and a large
top hat. smiling widely to show off
his white teeth.
Products such as this let certain
members of your constituency know
that you haven't forgotten them. It is
the politically correct way to say: "I
appreciate your race and its people,
and recommend in light of this that
you purchase this product." While
surely, you are making great strides
in this area, 1 would recommend that
you expand this practice as well.
In closing, you have done a very
good job, but you can certainly do
better. When it comes to marketing
your goods to the greatest possible
number of people, let the words of
the Great Sage Hello Kitty be your
guide: "You can never have too
many friends."
Sincerely,
Nat Millard
