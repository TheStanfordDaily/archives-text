## SPORTS BRIEFS Cardinal swimmers reap seven golds at Pan-Ams 
### 
Stanford swimming made its pres
ence felt worldwide at this past
week's Pan-American Games in Rio
De Janeiro, Brazil. Rising sopho
more Julia Smit led the Cardinal
charge, striking gold four times with
five medals total.
Last Thursday, Smit kicked off an
excellent weekend with first place in
the 100-meter backstroke and a lead
off swim in the Americans' gold-win
ning 4xloo freestyle relay. On Friday,
she went on to break the Pan-Am
record in the 200-meter individual
medley with a personal-best 2:13.07.
Smit's final gold came in the
4xloo medley relay, when she led off
with a personal-best 1:01.94 for the
backstroke and the U.S. went on to a
Pan-Am record 4:04.60. The rising
international star followed up with a
silver medal in the 200 backstroke,

garnering another personal best
(2:11.IS) and breaking the previous
Pan-Am record.
While she was the only Cardinal
woman at the Pan-Am Games, Smit
was joined by Andy Grant, who
claimed a total of three medals. The
rising senior gathered silver medals
in the 4xloo and 4x200 freestyle
relays, but came up with top honors
in Monday's 4xl (K) medley relay.
While Grant wrapped up the
record-breaking American swim
with a 48.75 time (3:34.37 total), he
was joined in the race by Randall Bal
'03 (53.83). Bal also earned individ
ual gold in the 1(X) backstroke for a
Pan Am Games record (53.66) and
the fourth-fastest time this year.
Another alum, Peter Marshall '04,
took silver in the same event.
