# Wiggins, Appel team up to bring Pan-Am title back to U.S.

### 
It took 20 years, but the U.S.
earned its first women's basketball
gold medal at the Pan-American

Games since 1987, partly thanks to
the Cardinal's Candice Wiggins and
Jayne Appel. The duo — which had
barely been born when the
Americans last won gold — played
key roles in the U.S.'s 79-66 win
over host Brazil.
Wiggins started Tuesday's game
and netted four points and two
rebounds in 19 minutes of play.

while rising sophomore Appel
made only a brief appearance in
the final.
The Pan-Am gold medal is the
second in Wiggins' summer collec

tion: The rising senior also led
Team USA to a win at the FIB A
Under-21 World Championships
earlier this month.
