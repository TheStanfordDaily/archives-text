### 
The U.S. will have a direct
llight to Beijing, China next
year thanks to the efforts of
three Cardinal water polo
players. Rising junior Jessica
Steffens, recent grad Alison
Gregorka '07 and alum
Brenda Villa '03 helped Team
USA bring home the gold
from the Pan-American
Games this week, clinching an
Olympic bid.
The 6-4 victory over
Canada on Sunday was
pushed by Gregorka, who.
while better known for her
defense, contributed two
goals. Steffens and team cap
tain Villa were also important
to the American defense,
which held its opponents to
4.3 goals per game during a 7-

bers rising junior Jessica Steffens and
Brenda Villa '03 snagged gold and a
U.S. Olympic bid at Sunday's Games.
While Gregorka and Steffens arc new to the Olympic
circuit, the 2008 trip to Beijing gives Villa another shot
at the team gold following silver and bronze finishes in
2000 and 2004, respectively.
