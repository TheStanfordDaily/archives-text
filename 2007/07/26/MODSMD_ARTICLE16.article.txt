# Every given Sunday, NFL fails
## 
### 
Two weeks ago I critiqued the
feeble attempts at exposing
Americans to soccer. So, in
the interest of equal time, I'll take
on America's own sporting power
house: the National Football
League.
For a while now, we've seen data
attesting to the fact that the NI L is
the most popular league in the coun
try and the most organized, with the
best balance between owners and
players, and the best commitment to
parity.
So, forgive me for being like the
kid in The Emperor's New Clothes,
who pointed out the emperor was
naked: 1 love football, but I don't
enjoy the NFL.
For starters, I just don't find its
games compelling. Save for the bot
tom-feeding Lions and Texans,
games between non-elite teams
seem almost random. Between
inconsistency, poor quarterback
play, and cookie-cutter strategies,
there just doesn't seem to be any
rhyme or reason to which middling
team is going to beat its middling
opponent. The underbelly of the
"Any Given Sunday" setup is that
equality and mediocrity have
become indistinguishable.
And as opposed to soccer, the
rules of which seem immutable
throughout the ages. NFL rules uid
their enforcement are being con
stantly tweaked in the name ot com
petition and — let's be honest here
— a marketable product. Throwing
the football sells tickets, and that's
what the NFL wants.
The "Peyton Manning Rules
put in place after the Patriots
mauled the Colts' receivers in the
2(H)4 AFC Championship Game
are an iconic example of this. Rules
protecting receivers from downiield
contact were "re-emphasized" to the
point of absurdity. As expected,
defensive passivity was enforced,
and there were also a lot of silly
pass-interference and holding calls
which put officials in a position to
decide games.
It's nothing new. The passing
game is ridiculously favored in
today's pro rules.
Offensive linemen are allowed to
hold pass rushers; receivers aren't
allowed to be touched more than


Christopher R
Anderson
five yards downfield; pass interfer
ence pills the hall at the spot of the
foul, even if a questionable call
moves the ball 50 yards. It's impossi
ble to compare the great quarter
backs of the I%o's to today's
passers because of the slanted rules
that Johnny Unitas and Sonny
Jurgensen never benefited from.
After beating the Colts in the
2(K)6 playoffs, the Steelers' Jerry
Porter suggested that the question
able officiating came from the
league's desire to give Manning a
Super Bowl. Jerry was half right: the
game wasn't fixed, but the rules
were fixed in the direction the
league wanted. It was just a coinci
dence that the re-emphasized rules
favored the league's most marketed
star, wasn't it?
This sort of unified power is
made possible by the strong NFL
top-down hierarchy, developed in
the I%o's to manage the league's
growth vis-a-vis tradition-rich Major
League Baseball. Revenue sharing,
a salary cap and a weak collective
bargaining agreement are vestiges
of this policy to keep any one ele
ment from getting out of control and
threatening the interests of the
league at large.
To its credit, the NFL has been
proactive on some potential prob
lems, delivering modest but signifi
cant fines and suspensions for oil
field misdemeanors and illicit
behavior like criticizing officials. It's
also developed a semi-transparent
substance policy to head off a situa
tion like baseball's current one.
But there is a downside.

Supposed journalism outfits like
ESPN have become de facto adver
tisements for the product. NFL mar
keting takes root in very subtle ways
that you might not notice if you
weren't watching out for it: things
like referring to "football" instead
of pro football, as if the college
games weren't played the day
before, and gradually allowing
broadcasts to omit colleges and
hometowns in player introductions.
The biggest downside is the
homogenization of the game. For all
the brilliance of its players and
coaches, the on-field NFL product is
very conservative. Risk aversion is
job one, so much so that many
game-time calls are decided on
beforehand and written on the lam
inated crib sheet that paranoid
coaches put in front of their mouths
when calling plays. No one wants to
make the risky call that costs his
team a game and have to answer for
it, hearing the"I told you so" of
people who said he should have
taken the safe move.
Add to this the fact that most
teams are pretty much running the
same sort of offense, and you've got
a set up for a lot of those "mirror
matchups" that don't really tell you
much about either team involved.
The need for these rule changes
comes from the dominance of
defenders over offensive players in
toughness and diversity of skill.
The size-first demands of pass
blocking creates overstuffed offen
sive linemen whose primary
weapon is the grabbing fist. This
predisposes them against effective
run blocking, but what the heck
running the ball doesn't sell any
tickets, so why not turn them into
phone booths?

The last systemic matter is that
the offenses arc set up so that the
best quarterback normally wins;
since there are only a handful of
really high-quality quarterbacks
today, that means a lot of teams
scraping by with Jalopy offenses.
NFL football is nothing like the
game played by high schoolers, and
barely resembles the college game
that feeds its rosters. So when for
eigners tell me they find our brand
of football boring, i dig deeper, and'
1 usually find they've got a point
they are seeing the same issues I'm
seeing. So, I advise them to sample
college football.
The NFL paradigm can be
described by comparison to its spon
sors — the Big Three: Budweiser,
Miller and Coors. The quality of
their products is secondary to mar
keting and revenue. Most of their
brands are variations on the same
swill formula, and their advertising
departments spend untold sums
convincing the masses that their
beer is world-class. (I allow for dif
ferences in beer opinion, but if you
think Natural Light is a high-quality
product, we're not in the same uni
verse of discussion.)
The more I thought about the.
new, tasteless Rolling Rock —no
longer brewed in Latrobe,
Pennsylvania but in a Budweiser
facility in Newark — the more I saw
the analogy to pro football. 11ere's
another way of putting it:
Why is American beer served
cold?
So you can tell it's not urine. *

of pro football, as if the college
games weren't played the day
before, and gradually allowing
broadcasts to omit colleges and
hometowns in player introductions.
The biggest downside is the
homogenization of the game. For all
the brilliance of its players and
coaches, the on-field NFL product is
very conservative. Risk aversion is
job one, so much so that many
game-time calls are decided on
beforehand and written on the lam
inated crib sheet that paranoid
coaches put in front of their mouths
when calling plays. No one wants to
make the risky call that costs his
team a game and have to answer for
it, hearing the"I told you so" of
people who said he should have
taken the safe move.
Add to this the fact that most
teams are pretty much running the
same sort of offense, and you've got
a set up for a lot of those "mirror
matchups" that don't really tell you
much about either team involved.
The need for these rule changes
comes from the dominance of
defenders over offensive players in
toughness and diversity of skill.
The size-first demands of pass
blocking creates overstuffed offen
sive linemen whose primary
weapon is the grabbing fist. This
predisposes them against effective
run blocking, but what the heck
running the ball doesn't sell any
tickets, so why not turn them into
phone booths?

The last systemic matter is that
the offenses arc set up so that the
best quarterback normally wins;
since there are only a handful of
really high-quality quarterbacks
today, that means a lot of teams
scraping by with Jalopy offenses.
NFL football is nothing like the
game played by high schoolers, and
barely resembles the college game
that feeds its rosters. So when for
eigners tell me they find our brand
of football boring, i dig deeper, and'
1 usually find they've got a point
they are seeing the same issues I'm
seeing. So, I advise them to sample
college football.
The NFL paradigm can be
described by comparison to its spon
sors — the Big Three: Budweiser,
Miller and Coors. The quality of
their products is secondary to mar
keting and revenue. Most of their
brands are variations on the same
swill formula, and their advertising
departments spend untold sums
convincing the masses that their
beer is world-class. (I allow for dif
ferences in beer opinion, but if you
think Natural Light is a high-quality
product, we're not in the same uni
verse of discussion.)
The more I thought about the.
new, tasteless Rolling Rock —no
longer brewed in Latrobe,
Pennsylvania but in a Budweiser
facility in Newark — the more I saw
the analogy to pro football. 11ere's
another way of putting it:
Why is American beer served
cold?
So you can tell it's not urine. *
