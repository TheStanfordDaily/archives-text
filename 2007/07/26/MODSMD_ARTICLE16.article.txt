# Every given Sunday, NFL fails
## 
### 
Two weeks ago I critiqued the
feeble attempts at exposing
Americans to soccer. So, in
the interest of equal time, I'll take
on America's own sporting power
house: the National Football
League.
For a while now, we've seen data
attesting to the fact that the NI L is
the most popular league in the coun
try and the most organized, with the
best balance between owners and
players, and the best commitment to
parity.
So, forgive me for being like the
kid in The Emperor's New Clothes,
who pointed out the emperor was
naked: 1 love football, but I don't
enjoy the NFL.
For starters, I just don't find its
games compelling. Save for the bot
tom-feeding Lions and Texans,
games between non-elite teams
seem almost random. Between
inconsistency, poor quarterback
play, and cookie-cutter strategies,
there just doesn't seem to be any
rhyme or reason to which middling
team is going to beat its middling
opponent. The underbelly of the
"Any Given Sunday" setup is that
equality and mediocrity have
become indistinguishable.
And as opposed to soccer, the
rules of which seem immutable
throughout the ages. NFL rules uid
their enforcement are being con
stantly tweaked in the name ot com
petition and — let's be honest here
— a marketable product. Throwing
the football sells tickets, and that's
what the NFL wants.
The "Peyton Manning Rules
put in place after the Patriots
mauled the Colts' receivers in the
2(H)4 AFC Championship Game
are an iconic example of this. Rules
protecting receivers from downiield
contact were "re-emphasized" to the
point of absurdity. As expected,
defensive passivity was enforced,
and there were also a lot of silly
pass-interference and holding calls
which put officials in a position to
decide games.
It's nothing new. The passing
game is ridiculously favored in
today's pro rules.
Offensive linemen are allowed to
hold pass rushers; receivers aren't
allowed to be touched more than
