# Buehler powers U.S. defense to reclaim Nordic Cup
## 
### 
Soccer star Rachel Buehler knows how to defend
the U.S. against Germany: The redshirt senior helped

hold the German Under-23 National Team scoreless
(4-0) on Tuesday for a second Nordic Cup in three
years.
Alter captaining the Cup-winning team in 2(X)5,
Buehler helped the Americans regain the title follow
ing last year's loss to Germany. Buehler and the rest of
the U.S. defense held off the Germans as well as
Norway (1-0) and Sweden (1-0) in the past weekend's
games.
Shutouts are nothing new to the defensive captain:
She helped Stanford to 15 last season.
