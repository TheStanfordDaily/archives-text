## Team wins Google 3-D design prize Student project wins Sketch Up competition 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford took top honors earlier this month
in Google's SketchUp contest, in which teams
of competitors from different schools designed
3-D models of their respective campuses. Led
by Steven Lehrburger '07 and Joseph Bergen
'07, Stanford's team emerged in the top seven
out of 364 other schools registered for the con
test.
The Stanford team's contest entry is visible
to the public on the 3-D Buildings layer of
Google Earth, which, according to
Lehrburger, "feels pretty cool."
The winning teams will travel to Google's
headquarters in Mountain View from Aug. 6-
9. All expenses will be paid for by Google,
including airfare, transportation via limousine
and hotel accommodation.
"This isn't as exciting as it might be for an
east coast school since it is only 15 minutes
away," said Lehrburger, "but it is still pretty
cool."
He noted that Google will even be paying
for one of his team members to fly back to
Mountain View from China.
Lehrburger and Bergen, both
Architectural Design majors, worked closely
with John Barton, a lecturer in Architectural
Design at the University, to design a Student
Initiated Course (SIC) that would double as

Stanford's team for the SketchUp contest.
The course was called "Putting Stanford on
the Map."
"The [SIC] program seemed like it would
provide a good framework for organizing the
project and motivating students to stay
involved," Lehrburger said.
"It seemed that the [SIC] route made sense
to make [the project] attractive to students
already on a busy schedule," Bergen added.
Lehrburger said that he and Bergen

worked to comprise a team of both
Architectural Design majors and those outside
the field.
"Joseph and I selected students for the class
with a short questionnaire, and we made selec
tions based off of past experience, interest in
the subject and other time commitments,"
Lehrburger said. "It took a lot of planning,
coordination, and dedication as well as many
emails to get everything done."
According to Bergen, the team took thou

sands of photographs of campus buildings
before setting out to model them in 3-D.
The Stanford team joins six other schools
that excelled in the SketchUp contest: Purdue
University, Concordia University, Indiana
University Purdue University Fort Wayne,
Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering,
Dartmouth College and the University of
Minnesota.

Google Earth users can now see Stanford's campus in 3-D, thanks to the efforts of a student design team that banded together after forming a
student initiated course. The group will proceed to the next round of competition, which will be held in Mountain View from Aug. 6-9.
