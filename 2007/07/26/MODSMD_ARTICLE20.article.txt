Electrical Engineering Prof. Umran Inan Ph.D '77
outshined stiff competition in receiving the 2007 Allan
Cox Medal for Faculty Excellence Fostering
Undergraduate Research. As Director of the Space,
Telecommunications and Radioscience (STAR)
Laboratory, he offers his undergraduate students the
opportunity assist in his technological research.
"I was surprised and very pleased [to receive the
award]," he said. "Undergraduates ask the most prob
ing questions, and they're enthusiastic and contribute a
lot."
The Cox Medal recipient is selected by a committee
of faculty from the School of Engineering, the School
of Earth Sciences and the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Inan was recognized in particular for his commit

ment to the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program, which is funded by the National
Science Foundation.
He and his research assistants aim to better under
stand the physics of the near space. Inan studies the
ionosphere and how satellite communication is affect
ed by radiation. The lab collects data from 30 different
research stations located in places like Antarctica,
Europe and Australia.
The Cox Medal was established to commemorate
the memory and work of the late Allan V. Cox, former
professor of geophysics and dean of the school of earth
sciences. The Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education selects the recipient, and the
bronze medal has been given out annually since Cox's
death in 1987.
