## CAMPUS MUSIC Jazzing things up this summer 
### ALLYSON STEWART INTERMISSION JAZZERCISER 
If you're still holding your own
against the campus-wide conversion
to a 9-5 workday and find yourself
awake around ten or eleven tomor
row night, you'll notice that those
guys wearing bowler hats around
White Plaza lately have got things
pretty locked down at the CoHo. In
contrast to the chai-scented silence
wafting through the place winter
quarter, these guys have trans
formed the CoHo into a rowdy
laughter-infused Coffee House
the type with great jazz and so much
noise you can actually read.
Between 10 p.m. and midnight
during the next two weeks(except
Fridays and Saturdays), the CoHo is
hosting talented saxophonists,
pianists, bassists, trumpeters, and
percussionists who improvise joy
ously unrestrained riffs and solos
into some smooth nights of jazz.
These jam sessions are held as a
part of the summer long Stanford
Jazz Workshop. The Workshop
consists of the Summer Jazz
Festival — a nightly concert series
at Dinkelspiel and Campbell
Auditoriums featuring professional
jazz musicians from around the
country, a jazz camp for teenagers
during the last two weeks of July, a

jazz residency for adults that runs
the first week in August, and night
ly jam sessions at the CoHo. The
Workshop has been up and running
since June 23rd but won't be over
for another two weeks, when every
thing wraps up with the already
sold-out performance from
renowned sax player Lee Konitz on
Aug. 3.
The Stanford Jazz website adver
tises the workshop as a summertime
"healthy dose of straight-ahead
jazz, flavored with innovative mod
ern stylings, traditional, blues, salsa,
Brazilian, and other cross-cultural
approaches to musical improvisa
tion." The improvisers range from
professional jazz musicians to the
featured jazz counselor or even a
camper.
The mood is upbeat and these
guys are good — in fact the sounds
are nudging the CoHo as close as it
will ever get to Birdland, or at least
a coffee house Although the
doors swing open at about half past
ten and a few litters of teens from
the Stanford Jazz workshop scam
per in with their hipster hair and
habit of crowding around the crepe
guys, things are surprisingly enter
taining at the CoHo. If you can for
give the crowds of campers, the ses
sions are offering a taste of serious
ly high-quality jazz — and it's free.

If you can't stand the sight of
someone under the age of twenty
ordering a mocha latte or you're
looking for something a little more
formal, definitely check out the
Festival schedule. The concerts usu
ally start at 7:30 and you can still get
student tickets online for $10-$2 O.
You can check out a complete
lineup of the upcoming concerts
