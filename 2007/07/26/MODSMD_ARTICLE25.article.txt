# CELEBRITY GOSSIP
## Britney uses couture to mop puppy poop 
### w BY KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION STALKERAZZI 
This week has been like Christmas for
celebrity gossip bloggers. In case you haven't
been following the nonstop coverage, Lindsay
Lohjin is responsible for the snort heard 'round
the world. Early Monday morning she was
arrested while in an aggressive car chase with
her ex-second assistant. Two DUIs in three
months versus one hit movie in three years
it's clear Lindsay is finally playing to her
strengths.
Lohan was released on a $25.1 XX) b;iil for
three charges, including driving on a suspended
license and possession of cocaine. According to
Calh.irnia law, she could face up to six years of
jail time. Too bad she couldn't coordinate her
incarceration with Paris Hilton's, or else the
friends could have spent a pleasant cellblock
slumber party shooting the blow. Oops, I mean
breeze.
Never to be outdone in the crazy depart-

mcnt, this week Britney
Spears gave an interview so
over-the-top that OK!
Magazine says it might end
her career. Brit refused the
help of professional hair
and make-up crew, repeat
edly used the bathroom
with the door open, wiped
fried-chicken grease all over
a $300 dress, and let her

puppy make a poopy all over a $2,7(X) gown.
Then Britney stormed out of the interview,
stealing almost $16,(XX) worth of clothes and
jewelry from the magazine's wardrobe depart
ment.
The actual photos and quotes from the
interview are so disturbing that OK! Magazine
is refusing to print them (and, coincidentally,
to pay Brit the cool million they promised for
the exclusive tell-all.) Girl, it's one thing to be
the trashiest tart in the trailer park, but when
you're too tackv for even OK! Magazine, it's

time to rethink your life choices.
This week Star Magazine asked which
Hollywood blonde recently dumped her musi
cian boyfriend because he liked to watch guy
on-guy porn while they were getting it on.
Jessica Simpson might as well have sent this out
on her own personalized stationary. Shame she
and John Mayer didn't work out, though -
"Bluesy and Floozy" had such a ring to it.
Natalie Portman continues her frustrating
streak of staying fully clothed on camera. While
all the nice, normal celebrities are flashing their
wobbly bits willy-nilly for the photogs, Portman
used a body double for erotic scenes in her
recent film Goya's Ghosts. She says if the body
double shots are peddled as genuine on the
internet she will be "really, really angry." Yeah,
well imagine how the rest of us feel, Natalie.
Jessica Alba recently broke up with Cash
Warren, her boyfriend of two years, over the
phone. While promoting "Fantastic Four"
overseas, she called her now-ex-lover and said:
"I'm not in love with you anymore," according

to an carwitness. Hours later she sent her per
sonal assistant to pack Warren's junk up and
move it out of her house. Apparently the
Invisible Woman has a heart of steel.
Nicole Richie is in her second trimester of
pregnancy, but plans for her upcoming marriage
to Joel Madden have hit a major snag. Madden
is considering demanding a paternity test to
ensure the baby is his. Judging by the list of
prospective fathers, Nicole has had more lovers
than meals in the past three months. Neither of
these facts bodes well for the poor baby.
Finally, in perhaps the only heart-warming
news of the week, the 59th Annual Primetime
Emmy nominations were announced and"The
Sopranos" was duly rewarded its their final sea
son of blood, gore and guvs whacking guys. The
show swept drama series categories with a stag
gering 15 nods. "Ugly Betty" rocked the prime
time comedies with an impressive 11 nomina
tions. And Disney Channel's "That's So
Raven" earned a completely inexplicable one
nomination.
