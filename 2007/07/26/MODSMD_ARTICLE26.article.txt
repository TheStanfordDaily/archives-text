## Autumn runways 
### BEN CASEMENT INTERMISSION FASHIONISTA 
A few weeks ago, the fashion pack —
models, editors, buyers, journalists — con
gregated in Paris for the semi-annual haute
couture shows. Couture has had ups and
downs lately, with house after house closing
its doors and the client pool shrinking. But
this month's shows were encouraging, for
several reasons: the quality of the clothes,
the crop of new designers in the mix, and
mounting evidence that couture is enjoying
a bit of a resurgence.
Haute couture is a relic of the 19th cen
tury, when wealthy Parisian women would
order entire wardrobes from the likes of
Charles Worth and Jacques Doucet.
Couture is made laboriously by hand, from
the most expensive fabrics, and calls for
multiple fittings and prototypes made from
muslin. The final product fits the customer
perfectly, disguises or even corrects physi
cal imperfections (sartorial cosmetic
surgery), and can cost from tens to hun
dreds of thousands of dollars for a single
garment.
No one makes money on couture — the
costs of producing it are vast. Christian
Dior is said to have spent $2 million on its
show this season. It is a matter of pride for
the oldest houses and lends credibility to
newer ones and it is one of the few areas of
fashion in which artistry still complements
commercial concerns. Worldwide, it is
bought by a tiny group of women, estimat
ed to range in number between seventy and
two hundred, typically including Saudi
princesses, the wives of Russian entrepre
neurs. and the vestiges of European royal
ty.
It is Dior's 60th anniversary this year,
and John Galliano, the label's current
designer, made a lavish presentation at
Versailles to an audience of thousands. Not
to be outdone by the setting, the clothes
recalled the New Look, introduced by the
house in 1947. However, it was embellished
in trademark Galliano style with pastel col
ors, suggestions of royalty and subtle hints
of the designer's native Spain. The silhou
ette was wasp-waisted and full-skirted,
complete with ruffles, pleats, embroideries.

and ridiculous hats.
Viewing the show, one might wonder
who would wear such over-the-top clothes.
The answer, of course, is hardly anyone,
but then Galliano is unconcerned with the
client. 11 it weren't overblown, it wouldn't
be Galliano.
Chanel's show was the best of the week,
despite a light rain falling on the Pare de
Saint Cloud, where the show took place
under a series of tents. Karl Lagerfeld, who
has designed the label since the eighties,
presented yet another take on the classic
Chanel jacket-and-skirt ensemble, embell
ished with feathers and embroidery around
the cults, the collar, and down the sides.
Afterward he explained the look as flat
tened — "Everything is flat on the front, it's
all side ellects" — an idea which brought
out the kind of subtle elegance real-world
couture customers might jump at. Critical
accessories included headscarves and gogg
ley sunglasses.
At 32, Riccardo Tisci is the youngest
designer to lead a major house, creating
both haute couture and ready-to-wear for
Givenchy. Under his leadership the house's
haute couture clientele has more than quin
tupled, from five to twenty-nine. But edi
tors and journalists frequently find his
vision jumbled and confusing, and this sea
son was no exception, with its mix of soft,
artfully proportioned clothes, leopard
print, and subtle S&M references. First, the
good: slimly tailored jackets and blazers in
soft tans and creams with cinched-in waists
and puffs of fur around the hips and shoul
ders as well as artfully-draped gowns with
ballooning, futuristic shoulders.
Interspersed was a succession of jackets
and hats in leopard-print and a number of
dresses and tops featuring the kind of asym
metric buckles and straps you might spot
on a dominatrix. The show had definite
strong points, but on the whole one feels
Tisci could use more constructive criticism
in the design process.
