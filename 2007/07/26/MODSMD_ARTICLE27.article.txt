# ALBUM REVIEW
## Float down this Okkervil River 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION OKKERVILER 
During Admit Weekend, I was
fortunate to hang out with two
other Profros who shared my
music tastes. As we traded iPods
to look at each other's music
libraries, one of my new friends
remarked with surprise that I had
two Okkervil River albums.
"They're really good," she
remarked, "but I thought they
were just an Austin band." I
agreed with her first point, that
they were good — really good —
but replied that I was under the
impression that Okkervil River
was a pretty well-known band,
relatively speaking, of course.
Okkervil River's latest album.

"The Stage Names," builds on
Okkervil River's previous suc
cesses, most notably their spec
tacular 2005 release, "Black
Sheep Boy." While "The Stage
Names" isn't quite as focused and
unified as "Black Sheep Boy,"
"The Stage Names" is still a gor
geous, clearly passionate album.
Unlike the dark, melancholy
"Black Sheep Boy," "The Stage
Names" revels in its glistening,
optimistic energy. The opener,
"Our Love is a Movie or Maybe"
develops with repetitive guitar
riffs; seconds later, frontman Will
Sheff begins to sing in a half-whis
per. Later, the percussion comes
in, and the transformation from
silence to a full-blown, epic song
is completed, complete with the

"oohh, oohh"s of the back-up
vocals.
Sheff's vocals are chock-full of
passion and substance. In the
song, and especially in the second
song, "Unless It's Kicks," you can
almost feel the spit that's coming
off Sheff's lips — he sings with so
much emotion that he can't possi
bly care if his audience is getting
drenched. Jim Eno of Spoon, who
produced the album, has left
these "Haws" in Sheff's voice in

the album, and in doing so, has
wonderfully created an album that,
while more produced and perhaps
more distant than "Black Sheep
Boy," retains Okkervil River's
beautiful organic sound.
It is Shelf's passionate voice that
carries the record. He displays an
impressive vocal range, which he
exhibits in both the album's tri
umphant and tender moments. In

the fifth track. Sheff sings about a
man reading his daughter's diary, "I
only read one page, then put it
away / Talk about your big mis
takes." Backed by soft, understated
guitar and xylophone, Sheff
poignantly asks of himself, "Is she
someone I betrayed?"
Yet as good as Sheffs voice is, it
sometimes fails him. At times,
Sheffs voice is awkward and harsh.
This is perhaps most evident in "A
Girl in Port," the album's sixth
song. In the song, Sheffs voice, for
once, seem to be a little forced.
Clocking in at a little more than six
and a half minutes, "A Girl in Port"

overstays its welcome; halfway
through, the song turns into bland
mush.
Despite "A Girl in Port" and a
two other disappointing songs near
the end of the album, ultimately,
"The Stage Names" is very impres
sive. The closer, "John Allyn Smith
Sails," which alternates between
resignation and triumph, summa
rizes the album perfectly; Sheff dis
plays his vocal range, succeeding in
both the melancholy and the tri
umphant. And so, Sheff demon
strates why, with more albums like
these, Okkervil River won't be
"just an Austin band" for long.
