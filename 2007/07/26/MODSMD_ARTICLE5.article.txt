## FACULTY & STAFF Search ends for new registrar Printup to be replaced by U Chicago registrar 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
University Registrar Roger
Printup announced in February that
he would retire at the end of the
2(K)6-2(H)7 academic year after 14
years at the University — sending
administrators scrambling to find

someone who
could follow in his
footsteps. The six
month search
recently came to a
close when former
University of
Chicago Registrar
Thomas Black was
selected for the
position.

"It was impor
tant that we find the right person
with just the right combination of
experience and talent," said Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. "Tom is a highly regard
ed professional with an established
reputation, having served as regis
trar at several notable universities."
But Black noted that he has large
shoes to fill.
"I find it a distinct honor to suc
ceed Roger Printup as registrar,"
Black said. "I've known Roger for
many years and he is well respected
among professional registrars
nationwide."
Black hopes to spearhead efforts
of integrating technology into his
office's functions as he takes on his
new role.
"I don't have a specific change
agenda already mapped out for
Stanford," Black said, "but 1 hope
what i can do is stimulate our think
ing about how technologies can be
better used to get the results we are
seeking."
Black said that his previous dri
ves to implement new technologies
will serve as the foundation for his
efforts at Stanford.
"I've been in higher education
administration at four different insti
tutions for 30 years," he said.
"During this time, I've come to
appreciate what technologies can
and cannot do to make organiza
tions more effective and why.
He noted that one of his office's
most important duties is that of pro
viding information support services
— and that technology is a key part


Thomas Black
of this role.
"Our community needs and
thrives on information," he said.
"For example, students want and
need information on courses being
offered, our faculty members need
to know the progress of their stu
dents and various administrators
require information to make better
policy decisions."
"By applying technologies
appropriately," he added, "the reg
istrar supplies accurate, meaningful
information, reliably in flexible and
timely forms."
Black said he supports the use of
electronic transcripts.
"The electronic transcript is one
manifestation of the information
support services," he said. "I believe
there will be many more [initiatives]
to come."
Black expressed enthusiasm
towards his new position and
embraced a change for both himself

"Tve come to
appreciate what
technologies can do
to make
oiganizations more
effective."
— Thomas Black,
University Registrar

and Stanford.
"What is ahead will be very
exciting if not a hit unpredictable,"
he said. "What better place to
embrace the future than at
Stanford, where thoughtful people
wish to make meaningful differ
ences with their lives?"
