## Pricey renovation expected for Med Center 
### MELODY DYE 
Stanford University Medical
Center is now set to begin the final
planning stages of a multibillion
dollar renovation of its hospitals

and medical school facilities, fol
lowing the completion of prelimi
nary negotiations with the city of
Palo Alto. The redevelopment is
expected to begin in 2010, with the
hospital remaining fully operational

during reconstruction.
The Medical Center has pro
posed adding over 1.3 million
square feet to its hospitals and
entirely replacing its medical school
facilities; many existing buildings

are slated for demolition. The
planned improvements will go a
long way toward remedying the cur
rent shortage of patient beds, and

will substantially modernize teaching and
research facilities.
The redevelopment plan has been driven
in part by California Senate Bill 1953, which
dictates that all acute care medical facilities
must retrofit or rebuild seismically unsound
buildings by 2013, such that by 2030, the
facilities could remain open in the after
math of a major earthquake. State hospitals
must comply or risk losing their operating
licenses.
While the mandate has served as an
impetus to action, the Center's proposed
construction goes far beyond its seismic
requirements. Stanford Hospital and the
Children's Hospital will both be redesigned
and significantly expanded, outfitted with
state of the art imaging equipment, an
expanded emergency room, additional sur
gical suites and private rooms for every
patient to facilitate family-centered care
and more space-effective intensive care
units.
The overhaul of the Medical School cam
pus will also complement recent changes in
the curriculum, allowing for interdiscipli
nary collaborations between educators,
researchers and clinicians.
"Aspects of research programs will [now
more] closely align to clinical programs,"
said Medical School Dean Phillip Pizzo,
who called the redevelopment plans "truly
transformative."
But the construction will not come with
out a hefty bill. As hospitals across the state
struggle to meet stricter seismic standards in
time for the state-mandated deadline,

The challenge here is
to bring out the best
thinking... of both
Stanford and Palo Alto
to solve this problem."
— Yoriko Kishimoto,
Palo Alto Mayor

demand for structural engineers and hospi
tal construction materials has risen and
costs have kept pace.
The current cost estimate for the hospi
tals' redevelopment plan falls just over the
$1 billion mark. The medical school project
has been an even higher price tag at $1.3 bil
lion.
Stanford will not seek state or federal
funding to support construction, despite the
multi-billion dollar price tag. To finance the
endeavor, the Medical Center will rely
instead on operations revenues and heavy
borrowing, with a small percentage of fund
ing coming from donors.
Incoming patients will also bear the
brunt of construction costs, paying on aver
age nearly $I,(KK) more a day to stay at
either of the hospitals. Medical School offi
cials could not confirm whether insurers will

cover the fee hike or if increased fees will
substantially change patient demographics.
While spokesmen for the Medical
Center have described the redevelopment
project in glowing terms, the plans have
stirred controversy in Palo Alto. Concerned
citizens and council members have argued
that the Medical Center's expansion, which
is estimated to bring in an additional 2,5(X)
employees, will considerably increase traf
fic, strain city services, reduce affordable
housing and limit open space.
While the Palo Alto City Council
approved the Medical Center's draft area
plan on July 23, Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto
M.B.A. '79 has lingering concerns, but
remains open to compromise.
"The challenge here is to bring out the
best thinking and the best ideas and app!]^-.
the brains of both Stanford and Palo Alto to "
solve this problem," she said. "[We must]
ask, how do we increase in density like this
without the negative impact?"
Now that the draft has been approved,
work will begin on an environmental impact
report to assess what kind of development
agreement will benefit both the Medical
Center and the city of Palo Alto.
"We expect the [Medical Center's] appm- s
cations to be coming in over the next couple
weeks." Kishimoto said. "This is our oppor
tunity to work together on integrating a
planning framework, to address each
other's needs and develop a little more of a
trust relationship."
