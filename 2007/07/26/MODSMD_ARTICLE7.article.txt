## Bush awards prof, science medal Shyer to be recognized for Med School research 
### SALONE KAPUR 
School of Medicine Professor
Emeritus Lubert Stryer will jour
ney to the White House tomorrow
to receive the 2006 National
Medal of Science from President
Bush — the nation's highest honor
for scientific achievement.
Stryer. who studies neurobiolo
gy and cell biology, is one of eight
scientists to receive an award.
Psychology Prof. Gordon Bower

and Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron
M.S. *62, National Medal of
Science winners for 2005, will join
Stryer at the White House cere
mony honoring the 2005 and 2006
laureates.
35 Stanford scholars have won
the award. Since its establishment
hy Congress in 1959. the National
Medal of Science has recognized
individuals studying the physical,
biological, mathematical, engi
neering, social, and behaviorial
sciences.
Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo was quick to praise Stryer's
accomplishment.
"We were all thrilled when Dr.

Lubert Strver was named as one of
the 2006 awardees," he said.
"First, for Dr. Stryer who has had
a remarkably productive career
and who is most worthy of this
honor and recognition and second,
for the further distinction that this
honor brings to the School of
Medicine and Stanford
University."
Stryer is best known for the
development of a DNA chip used
in genetic analysis. Stryer devel
oped a light-directed method of
generating microarray "gene
chips" during his 1989 leave from

Stanford. The method is currently used by
Affymetrix, the Santa Clara Company at
which Stryer serves as the chair of the scien
tific advisory board.
Stryer has also researched how the reti
na processes light. He has pioneered tech

niques like fluorescence spectroscopy to
study proteins on the molecular level, and is
the author of the textbook "Biochemistry."
"He is highly intelligent, broadly educat
ed and naturally curious," Pizzo said.
"Importantly he has been willing and able
to address big problems and questions —
which is why his research has had such an
impact."

Chemical and Systems Biology Prof. Tobias

Meyer celebrated Stryer's well-rounded
intellectualism.
"I think an understanding of Lubert is
incomplete without mentioning his deep
interest in music, art, and the outdoors," he
said. "I believe that he got much of his
inspiration for his research while hiking in
the mountains, listening to music or con
templating art."
