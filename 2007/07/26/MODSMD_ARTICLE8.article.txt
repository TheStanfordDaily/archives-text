## Sketch Puberty 2.0 
### 
I think I'm developing a pot bellv.
No, that's a lie, there's no "I
think." I'm developing a pot
belly. A pot belly. I look in my floor
to-ceiling mirrors each morning
(yes, I'm very vain) and I cannot
help but notice my increasing
resemblance to a) a protein
deprived third world child and b)
my father.
Actually, the third world child
thing is not so true as it used be. I
can no longer see my rib cage and
my indolent American life has
fleshed out my spindly limbs some.
As for turning into my father, well
I've still got a good four inches in
height even if everything else goes
downhill.
Still, even if I'm not exactly trans
forming into either an advertise
ment for Oxfam or into dad's dop
pelganger, I'm not entirely sanguine
about the chubbification process. I
may have been called all manner of
names when I was in school and
safely as thin as a rake, but I like
that me and I knew him well. There
was a large investment of time and
effort in making skinny Nav viable
and the change is troubling.
I've written before on the trou
bles that come with one's late twen
ties, on how this is in some sense the
most difficult period in one's life.
On how, whilst you struggle with
who you are during teenage years,
as you approache the magic three
oh, you have to find out who you're
not. Well, it turns out that it's not
just your mind and soul that need to
figure this one out — your body gets
to struggle too.
Puberty is widely considered to
be awkward. This is because it is
awkward. However, it is generally
awkward in a good way. The end
result of the change is desirable
(unless of course you make your
money singing about God in an
unreasonably high-pitched voice,
then you're screwed). You start as a
boy/girl and finish as a man/woman
complete with a whole set of new
(and fun) toys.
The fading of youth and its atten
dant vigor as one moves into cheap
car rental territory (that's 25+ for
you young 'uns) is not quite so
pleasant an experience. Things start
to sag and bulge and wrinkle in a
thoroughly unpleasant fashion.
I think it's safe to say that no one
gets prettier as they age. This isn't to
say everyone over 30 is ugly; it's just
that they were better looking in the
past. The qualification of beauty
with age doesn't really exist when
you're 22 — people just don't say
things like "he looks good for his
age" until the decades get into
triples.
It's not that your body is failing
you (after all. the same is true for
your peers, so at least your sex life is

unlikely to be affected); no, the real
issue is that you've peaked.
Whatever potential you have has
been exhausted and now you have
to come to terms with your (many)
inadequacies.
In much the same way as realiz
ing that you will not be successful is
a defining characteristic of this peri
od in your life, so it is with the
acknowledgement of the failings of
your flesh to live up to Adonis-like
(maybe in this day and age we
should replace that with Pitt-like)
perfection.
There is a marked difference
between the realization that you
have failed and the realization that
you cannot succeed. The latter is
where your body is now — its
imperfections set for eternity, with
only decline available as an avenue
for change.
One of the nice things about
being young is that you can always
tell yourself that there's time to
change. Time to do those things you
dream about. Growing up, on the
other hand, well growing up is the
gradual removal of those chances to
change. It's the ossification of
habits, of skills, of everything that
makes you who you are.
To be honest, ossification is not
quite the correct word, not every
thing is set in stone — things are
allowed to get worse. Which brings
me back to my burgeoning pot
belly.
I had almost resigned myself to
being out of shape, weak, feeble,
and sticklike. Sure, I'd like the
toned body and all the rest, but I
could live without it. And so, com
fortable- in my inadequacy. I was
ready to face aging. I have an entire
wardrobe designed to make stick
thin look sexy. I spent years inuring
myself against playground insults, I
have that whole self-depreciation
thing down perfect.
But now, in what can only be
described as another demonstration
that God hates me, I find myself
with new physical failing to deal
with. It's the beginning of the end.
Of course the "end" is long and
drawn out. so at least we'll all have a
while to reminisce about the good
old days when bodily change meant
voices changing, hair growing, and
other delights.
