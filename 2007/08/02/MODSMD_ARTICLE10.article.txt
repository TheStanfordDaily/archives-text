## Nasal love 
### 
A nasal spray to combat shyness
is in the works. The spray's
active ingredient is oxytocin, a
mammalian hormone implicated in
maternal behavior and romantic
bonding. Researchers spritzed the
hormone into the nostrils of 70 indi
viduals with social phobia, a disorder
marked by paralyzing anxiety in
social situations. After a few snorts of
oxytocin, the volunteers reportedly
become less anxious and more social
ly engaged.
Oxytocin is powerful stuff. It facil
itates a woman's contractions during
labor and delivery, aids her in breast
feeding and plays an important role in

cementing the bond between mother
and child. Sheep mothers given oxy
tocin antagonists shun their new
borns. while virgin sheep injected
with the hormone nuzzle every lamb
in sight. Oxytocin makes a new moth
er smile and coo at her shrieking baby
while everyone else on the vicinitv is

ready to smother it.
Oxytocin is sexy, too. Ecstasy, the
"love drug", seems to work hy stimu
lating oxytocin activity. Rats injected
with the hormone get spontaneous
erections; humans of both sexes
release floods of it during orgasm,
and plasma levels of the hormone art
higher in people who claim to be
falling in love.
All this makes me sort of uncom
fortable with the idea of casually
squirting it up someone's nose.
Oxytocin is the closest thing to a love
potion we've got. At the risk of sound
