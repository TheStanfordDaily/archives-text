## Nasal love 
### 
A nasal spray to combat shyness
is in the works. The spray's
active ingredient is oxytocin, a
mammalian hormone implicated in
maternal behavior and romantic
bonding. Researchers spritzed the
hormone into the nostrils of 70 indi
viduals with social phobia, a disorder
marked by paralyzing anxiety in
social situations. After a few snorts of
oxytocin, the volunteers reportedly
become less anxious and more social
ly engaged.
Oxytocin is powerful stuff. It facil
itates a woman's contractions during
labor and delivery, aids her in breast
feeding and plays an important role in

cementing the bond between mother
and child. Sheep mothers given oxy
tocin antagonists shun their new
borns. while virgin sheep injected
with the hormone nuzzle every lamb
in sight. Oxytocin makes a new moth
er smile and coo at her shrieking baby
while everyone else on the vicinitv is

ready to smother it.
Oxytocin is sexy, too. Ecstasy, the
"love drug", seems to work hy stimu
lating oxytocin activity. Rats injected
with the hormone get spontaneous
erections; humans of both sexes
release floods of it during orgasm,
and plasma levels of the hormone art
higher in people who claim to be
falling in love.
All this makes me sort of uncom
fortable with the idea of casually
squirting it up someone's nose.
Oxytocin is the closest thing to a love
potion we've got. At the risk of sound

ing like an abstinence pledger,
shouldn't the oxytocin bond between
two people be special? I'm not sure I
would want to feel indiscriminately
bonded to everyone in the room, even
if it made me less shy around them.
In other news: Department of
Agriculture scientists developed a
low-calorie watermelon. The new
summer fruit has only half the sugar
of conventional melons, making it
suitable for diabetics and dieters. If
farmers get behind the melon, it
could hit supermarkets by the end of
the summer.
I have to admit I'm skeptical of the
need for "diet fruit." I also can't imag
ine that the low-sugar melon has the
same juicy taste I'm used to, and it
seems the Department of Agriculture
agrees.
"A little artificial sweetener can be
sprinkled onto the fruit to give it a fla

vor that's comparable to convention
al watermelons," said a spokesper
son. Maybe scientists should geneti
cally engineer the watermelons to
produce artificial sweetener and save
consumers that step. Splenda water
melons! I'd buy one of those.
Good news for the cappuccino
addicted: Caffeine seems to protect
mice against skin cancer. The rodents
in question were hairless mice â€”
pale, wrinkly creatures that remind
me of Gollum in the Lord of the
Rings movies. Their exposed skin
made them vulnerable to cancers
when researchers blasted them with
UVB rays.
But those rays didn't cause cancer
in all mice equally. Before the exper
iment began, the mice were divided
into four experimental groups. The
first group sipped caffeinated water
(the human equivalent of one to two
cups of coffee per day), and the sec
ond group ran on an exercise wheel.
A third group exercised and drank
caffeine, and the control group did
neither. All the mice were exposed to
lamps that generated damaging UV

radiation.
The UV rays burned through the
mice skin cells, wreaking havoc on
their cellular DNA. Cells ttx) dam
aged to repair themselves committed
suicide in a process called apoptosis.
A mouse needs apoptosis to stay
healthy, because any damaged cells
that ignore orders to self-destruct
have the chance to develop into can
cerous tumors.
The mouse study was designed to
see which mice were the best at offing
their damaged cells. The animals that
drank caffeine had a 95 percent
increase in UV-induced apoptosis,
while the animals that got exercise
showed a 120 percent increase.
Surprisingly, the caffeinated runners
showed nearly a 4(X) percent increase
in cell suicide, suggesting a synergistic
effect between exercise and caffeine.
Researchers are so far at a loss to
fully explain their results. But it's
enough for me. I'm off to pour myself
a tall glass of diet Coke.
