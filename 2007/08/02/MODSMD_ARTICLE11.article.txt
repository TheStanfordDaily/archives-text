## Narrow mind, broad waist 
### 
Middle age is much written
about and, more important
ly, much aphorized about.
The same is not true of one's late
twenties — the jokes are bad, the
quotes are none existent and the lit
erature has a little of the "airport"
about it. (Of course, we do have all
the sitcoms and most of the romantic
comedies, so it's not a total white
wash.)
Still, the absence of collective wis
dom is not so bad. since many of the
well-held truths of the middle years
apply (or, at least, start to apply)
around now. Take, for example, the

quote that inspired this week's title:
"Middle age is when broad mind and
narrow waist swap places."
Since last week's piece dealt with
the broadening of the waist (and
other issues) it seems only appropri
ate to discuss the counterpoint today.
The dangers of narrowing one's

mind are superficially obvious .Alter
all, most of us have spent main years
railing against the intolerance of gen
erations past. Whilst much of this
alleged intolerance is of a kind that
merits serious discussion (racism, sex
ism, etc.), much is not. I've been as
worked up about the soft homopho
bia of family friends as often as I have
been about the constant dismissal ot
an evolving popular culture (since, as
we all know, popular culture peaked
whenever the arbiter in question
turned 16, and it's been decline and


Navin
Sivanandam
fall since then).
Shallow as I am. it's the trivial that
I'm concerned with. I find it deeply
puzzling and not a little disturbing
that we can so readily dismiss the
new, despite having scoffed at our
parents and their ilk for doing the
same.
A large part of the problem is the
widely held misconception that one's

likes and dislikes have some value.
People continually labor under the
misconception that personal prefer
ence is important. It's not. And
moreover, preferences are often
wrong.
Don't get me wrong, disliking
things is fine (for example, 1 hate chil
dren under the age of 22), it's just that
one shouldn't make the mistake of
overvaluing one's opinion. Let me
give you a food-based example: Lots
of people hate fish — they find the
taste and the smell repellent. This is,
however, wrong. Fish is great, there's
a whole spectrum of flavors that can't
be found anywhere else and if you
close eyes, you picture yourself in any
sea in the world ...
(Other examples of "wrong" pref
erences are almost too numerous to
list, but standout ones include Coors,
Miller and Budweiser.)
But I digress, now where was I?
Ah ves, the dangers of personal pref
erence. Preference is not only wrong,
it is also restrictive. It traps you into
believing you have experienced it all
and found your niche, when, in reali
ty, such a thing can only ever be an
illusion. All you do is close your mind
to possible treats for the senses and
stimuli for the mind.
It takes time to get to like things.

And effort. Foolishly dismissing a
new experience is not only foolish, it's
lazy and intellectually dishonest.
"Intellectually dishonest" may
seem a little harsh, but consider refus
ing to try deep-fried cockroach just
because you've never eaten it before,
and note that the academic equiva
lent would have been not believing in
gravity, 'cos it was, you know, new.
1 think, ideally, one needs to main
tain a Zen-like (you know. I have no
idea what that actually means) bal
ance between everything. All options
should be considered, all tastes
should be sampled and all adventures
should be jumped into.
It's an appealing idea, when you
really start to think about it. Every
day is a new experience. Every possi
bility is open. Everything is available
for exploration.
There is, of course, one small
downside with all this. Most experi
ences aren't actually any good, and if
you did keep an open mind, you'd
almost certainly be miserable all the
time.

I'm hoping that after muling this you II
all he convinced to try all manner of
new things. If your personal list
includes orgies please email
