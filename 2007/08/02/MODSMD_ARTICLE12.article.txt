## Iconic filmmaker to teach course "Grizzly Man" director Herzog receives arts grant 
### MELODY DYE 
Filmmaker Werner Herzog will soon be
turning his eye away from the camera and
toward classes of Stanford students. His
recently announced winter quarter visit will be
the highlight of the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts' (SICA) 2007-08 sea
son of programming.
President John Hennessy spearheaded
SICA in early 2(X)6 with seed funding from his
office and money gifted from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Now in its infancy,
SICA has a six-figure pilot fund and a man

date to develop arts programs that encourage
performance and exhibition.
SICA will direct this funding in part toward
building a series of talks hosted by Herzog on
his work and creative vision. Herzog will
screen two of his recent films and lead a mas
ter-class for MFA students in the
Documentary Film and Video Program, which
will also be open to undergraduates with a
demonstrated interest in film.
The visit was first proposed by Prof. Jan
Krawitz and Prof. Kris Samuelson *73, both
of the Art Department's Film and Media
Studies Program. Krawitz said that they had
hoped to secure a grant to bring a documen
tary filmmaker to campus whose body of
work would appeal to the general Stanford
population.
Herzog, she said, was particularly appealing
because of his eminence as a director, his pro

lific and eclectic body ol work, and his expres
siveness about his films.
"He's one of the more interesting filmmakers
working today," she said, "and he's someone
people have heard of."
Herzog, a crossover director who has made
both documentary and narrative features, is
known for pushing the envelope, both in his
madcap production style and in his imagina
tive approaches to storytelling. In his fictions,
like the 1982 film "Fitzcarraldo," he
has pushed actors to extremes in the name of
realism; in his documentaries, like the 2005
film "Grizzly Man," he's fictionalized ele
ments in the name of art.
As Krawitz remarked, and as many film
experts would agree, Herzog '"traverses
between the genres with a certain fluidity that
makes him brilliant in both."
Krawitz praised SICA for making visits like

Herzog's possible and for funding artists in
residency, a move that she thinks will inspire a
new dialogue between the general Stanford
community and its artists.
"(SICA| is thinking about the arts in really
expansive ways and opening up to new ideas,"
she said. "For many of the years that I've been
here, the arts have been in a shadow, but this
initiative has been truly instrumental in push
ing them back out into the limelight."
Including Herzog's visit, SICA will fund 13
initiatives in the arts next academic year,
including the Stanford Storytelling Project, a
KZSU radio-program set to air the creative
works of students and Stegner fellows and a
"Meet the Artist" lecture series aimed to
encourage dialogue between students and
prominent artists, musicians and performers.
