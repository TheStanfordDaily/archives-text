# SCIENCE & TECH
## Summit brings in tech gurus and CEOs Facebook and Farm host entrepreneurs 
### ELLIOT ONN 
On one side of El Camino Real,
start-up CEOs, venture capitalists and
technology experts gathered yesterday
to discuss the future of the industry at
Arrillaga Alumni Center. On the other
side, a group of summer interns and
high-tech employees in their 2()s and
30s assembled at one of the many
Facebook offices that dot downtown
Palo Alto.
On campus, at the Stanford Summit,
CEOs with haircuts conjuring images of
John Edwards had to get over their
stage fright, as they listed the hot points
of their businesses and products in
timed presentations. Some were look
ing for funding for their company, but
most were looking to network.
In Palo Alto, Terry Chay, a roving
young technologist, organized "Lunch
2.0," Valley-speak for a gathering of
young techies who take advantage of
free food at companies in return for the
techies' combined presence, which cre
ates an ephemeral hub for the exchange
of industry information.
The purposes of both groups are
similar, but their differences loom
large. At the Summit, a Hurry of tan
suits mingle with dark suits, while
shrimp is served on sticks. One young
entrepreneur pouts at the lunch offer
ings and asks a waitress whether "there
will be any more protein."
Lunch 2.0 is largely comprised of
jean clad college sophomores imbibing
Facebook's beer and munching off veg
gie platters. A ticket to the Summit
costs a cool $3,000; Lunch 2.0 is free.
The Summit plays host to presiden
tial candidate and Senator John
McCain (R-AZ), who asserts that
Silicon Valley and American ingenuity
hold the key to resolving Islamic

extremism through the development of
green technologies.
Mark Jen — a former Google engi
neer who achieved notoriety when he
was fired 10 clays into his job after writ
ing about the company in a personal
blog — addresses the audience at
Lunch 2.0. Jen has become something
of a revolutionary among the techno
rati.
Many of the participants at Lunch
2.0 work at Google, Yahoo and other
Web 2.0 startups. Aaron Nemoyten and
Alex Notov will launch their Facebook
application, Quesdots, in the next
week. Quesdots will allow users to con
nect to others who have similar ques
tions about a topic.
Nemoyten and Notov, who initially
met at a Meet Up.com event, hope their
application will expand beyond
Facebook's closed networks, which
allow only those people who are friends
to communicate.
At the Summit, a lot of the buzz sur
rounds Linden Labs, which created
Second Life, an Internet-based virtual
world based on user interaction. Jaron
Lanier — a distinguished computer sci
entist and thinker who last year
authored a controversial paper citing
fault with online collectivism — is an
equity holder in the company.
"In Second Life, it's not a network.
It's not like you have a 'friends list.'
Instead, you're using the geography of
the space to connect to people," Lanier
says."I actually prefer it to the explicit
social networking that's happening on a
lot of the giant sites."
The networking events prove to be a
short exercise of what some of the com
panies are hoping to accomplish in
online communication. In a region dic
tated by Moore's Law, which says that
technology doubles every 24 months,
one wonders whether the groups on
opposite sides of El Camino represent
an informal changing of the guard.
