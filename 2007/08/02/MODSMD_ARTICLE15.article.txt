## Internet project gears up at Stanford 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Researchers outlined plans for
Stanford's "clean-slate initiative"
last month, part of a global effort
to redesign the basic structure of
the Internet. The project aims to
start with a "clean slate," as
researchers imagine how they
would design the Internet if they
could start anew.
Associate Professor of
Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science Nick McKeown
is the project's team leader.
"We want to look back in 20
years and see that we — here at
Stanford — have had a significant
impact on the future Internet,"
McKeown said in an email to The
Daily. "With the breadth of world
class expertise here on campus,
and the proximity to the center of
the networking industry, Stanford
is well-placed to do it."
According to Stanford's Clean
Slate team, researchers affiliated
with the effort believe that the
Internet has significant deficiencies
in security and mobility. The site
outlines five key areas for project
ed research: network architecture,
heterogeneous applications, het

erogeneous physical layer tech
nologies, security and economics
and policy.
Governments worldwide are
interested in the clean-slate initia
tive because of its relationship to
Internet surveillance efforts, such
as blocking pornographic or politi
cally sensitive Web pages and
tracking those who distribute such
material.
"In theory [the project] would
be an excellent idea, but I think
there are political issues to over
come," former FBI official Les
Szwajkowski told the International
Herald Tribune. "There would be
a reluctance to say you have an
investigative agency at the table
involved in a deep reworking of
the Internet."
Still, Szwajkowski admitted
building in surveillance controls
would certainly cut government
costs down the road.
In addition to partnering with
other universities around the
world, Stanford's clean-slate initia
tive is working closely with Cisco
Systems, Japan's DoCoMo and
Germany's Deutsche Telekom.
