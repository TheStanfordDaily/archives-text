## ASSU launches summer party initiative Execs, plan Sigma Chi party, laud success of first effort 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
Summer at Stanford is normally a
sleepy time, so the ASSU is bringing
out the pajamas.
The ASSU will sponsor a paja
ma-themed party at Sigma Chi this
weekend, following the success of its
July 21 Summer Jam 2007 at
Tresidder â€” the first event in the
ASSU's new summer party initia
tive.
ASSU Vice President
Mondaire Jones '09 said that he
and ASSU President Hershey
Avula '08 realized the "dearth of
social options on campus over the
summer" and began planning
Stanford's first ASSU-sponsored
summer parties.
ASSU officials lauded the success
of the July 21 kick-off summer party,
which Jones described as "the first
of its kind."
"We gave out 350 wristbands that
night," Jones said. "Oak West was
packed."

"The first one went so well,
people who had doubts about the
ASSU's potential to throw a dance
party will likely be willing to
attend the party at Sigma Chi," he
added.
ASSU Senator Stuart Baimel '09
said he was pleasantly surprised at
the first party's turnout.
"I was very surprised at the
turnout of the first ASSU party," he
said. "I didn't think that so many
people would come out. I'm not sure
about the success of the second one,
but I'm optimistic. It's great that the
ASSU is contributing to the summer
social scene."
Jones said this weekend's party
will probably be the summer's last,
as the ASSU gears up for Full Moon
on the Quad, the Mausoleum party,
Big Game Week and the grand
opening of Old Union.
"We want students to know that
the ASSU is constantly working on
their behalf, even in the summer
months," Jones said. "Creating
social options are just one way we
plan to do that."
The ASSU's upcoming "House
Party" will be held at Sigma Chi on
Saturday from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.
