## Farewell to "The Genius" Bill Walsh 1931-2007 
### Christian Torres 
Stanford football legend and former athletic director Bill Walsh passed away on Monday morning
at his Woodside, Calif, home. The three-time Super Bowl champion coach died at age 75 after a
long battle with leukemia.

Walsh was a fixture of both the Cardinal
and national sports scenes. His Hall-of-Fame
turn as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
from 1979 to 1988 was bookended by a total of
five seasons leading Stanford football. 1977-78
and 1992-94.
While he may be best remembered for his
NFL accomplishments and his innovative
West Coast Offense, Walsh's many years at
Stanford — whether as head coach or. in his
later years, as an adviser and interim athletic
director — resonate just as strongly in
Cardinal history.
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby lamented
the loss of "a great friend" to the Stanford ath
letics family at a press conference on Monday
afternoon. Walsh, who was interim athletic
director when Bowlsby was hired, helped
Bowlsby transition into his position and
remained a special assistant up until his death.
"Even before I arrived at Stanford last
year. Bill reached out and said, 'Call upon me;
I am happy to help,'" Bowlsby said. "Through
the 12 months that ensued, nothing could have
been more spot on.
"Bill, in a short time, taught me an awful
lot about the challenges that were here, what
the opportunities were, who the people I
could trust were and who the people 1 ought
to keep an eye on were," he added.
When Walsh became head football coach,
he was no stranger to Stanford athletics. A
former wide receiver for San Jose State
University, Walsh also served as a defensive
backs coach for the Cardinal in the 1963 and
1964 seasons.
Walsh assumed the head coaching job 13
years later and found immediate success.
Following a lackluster 6-5 record in 1976, the
Cardinal went 9-3 under Walsh in 1977, even
tually winning that year's Sun Bowl. It was the
Cardinal's first bowl victory in six years, and in
the following season, Stanford went 8-4 on its
way to a Bluebonnet Bowl victory.
Former Cardinal running back and NFL
player Darrin Nelson '81 said that Walsh's tal
ent was evident in the coach's two Stanford
coaching seasons prior to his transition to the
professional leagues.
"His offensive was innovative then as
well," the 1977 freshman said in a University
press release. "He was also a fabulous person
who was funny, caring, considerate and always
thought about his athletes."
When Walsh stepped on to the national
scene as head coach of the 49ers, many of
those traits became front-and-center as he
found and developed some of the NFL's
greatest talent. At Monday's conference, NFL
Hall-of-Famer Steve Young, Super Bowl
XXIII MVP Jerry Rice and the 49ers' Kccna
I urner all paid their respects to the man who

propelled their careers.
"He knew talent; he knew how to mold it,"
Rice said, describing the chance Walsh took
on him; Rice was an unlikely draft pick from
Mississippi Valley State University.
Super Bowl ring dangling from the chain
around his neck, Rice added that he had
longed for the day when he would be induct
ed into the NFL Hall of Fame — with an
introduction from Walsh.
Turner shared a similar account of being
under Walsh's tutelage for 11 years. The for
mer 49ers lineback described how his rela
tionship with Walsh evolved over the years
from student to co-worker and friend.
"He knew talent;
lie knew how to
mold it."

When Walsh returned to Stanford in 1992.
Turner joined him as outside linebackers
coach and gained a better understanding of
the man manv called "The Genius" of foot
ball.
"1 think at Bill's core he was a teacher,"
Turner said, adding that Stanford was a spe
cial place for Walsh because it brought togeth
er a high standard of education and sport in
which Walsh felt comfortable being instru
mental.
The 1992 season was Walsh's most success
ful of his three years of Cardinal coaching
after his return from the 49ers, with a 10-3
record and Blockbuster Bowl win. The years
following were more difficult, with 4-7 and 3-
7-1 records, respectively, and the legendary
coach stepped down.
"When you're young, the euphoria of win
ning balances out the heartache of losing,"
then-athletic director Ted Leland said in a
University press release. "When you get
older, the euphoria isn't as high, but the
heartache is just as big, so the euphoria is tem
pered. Bill wasn't having fun winning and he
was really struggling with the losses. So he
stepped down."
Walsh didn't leave Stanford for good, how-
