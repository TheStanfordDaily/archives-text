## WOMEN'S TENNIS Tennis stars go West 
### ELIZABETH PRATT STAFF WRITER 
International tennis stars took over Taube
Family Tennis Center this past weekend, but a few
of Stanford's own also made their presence felt at
the 37th annual Bank of the West Classic.
The event is the longest-running women's-only
professional tennis tournament in the world, and
boasts a former champions list that reads like a
who's who of women's tennis: past winners
include Billie Jean King, Martina Hingis and
Venus Williams. This year, the Tier II Sony
Ericsson Women's Tennis Association (WTA)
tour event featured a 28-player singles draw and a
16-team doubles draw with $6<X),(KK) of total prize
money on the line.

The weekend before the start of the tourna
ment, a 16-player qualifying tournament tcx>k
place to fill four spots in the main singles draw,
and the winners of a four-team doubles qualifying
tournament took the final spot in the main dou
bles draw.
Three Stanford players were given wild cards
to participate in the qualifying tournament: rising
seniors Lejla Hodzic and Whitney Deason, as well
as their former teammate, Anne Yelsey '07.
Hodzic and Deason both lost in the first round,
but Yelsey went as far as the second, knocking out
American Mami Inoue 6-4, 6-1 in the first round
before falling to American Raquel Kops-Jones
(ranked No. 186 in the world) 6-2,6-3. Hodzic had

lost to American Jennifer Yen 6-1,6-3, and
American Alexandra Stevenson took out
Deason 6-2,6-2.
Two former Stanford players did, how
ever, make it to the main singles draw:
Amber Liu '06 and Lilia Osterloh, who
attended Stanford from 1996-1997 before
turning pro.
Liu, the 2(X)3 and 2(K)4 NCAA singles
champion, had a strong first-round show
ing but fell 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 to Grecian Eleni
Daniilidou, ranked No. 44 in the world.
Osterloh, who won the NCAA singles
championship as a freshman in 1997,
recorded two upsets in the tournament on
her way to the quarterfinals. In the first
round, she eliminated another former
NCAA singles champion, No. 72 Jill
Craybas, 6-2,7-5. And in the second round,
Osterloh recorded the biggest upset of the
tournament by stunning 2007 Wimbledon
finalist and No. 2 seed Marion Bartoli
(ranked No. 12 in the world) 5-7,6-4,6-3.
The Card alum's run came to an end in
the quarterfinals, where she lost to the No.
8 seed, Austrian Sybille Bammer (No. 21 in
the world) 6-2,6-1. As a result of her strong
play at the Bank of the West, Osterloh
jumped 26 spots in the WTA singles rank
ings, from No. 106 to No. 80.
Stanford was represented in the dou
bles tournament as well. Liu and Yelsey,
who previously played together in their

collegiate careers, received a wild card for
the main doubles draw. They played the
top-seeded team of Japan's Ai Sugiyama
and Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik in the
first round, losing 6-1,6-2.
Though many American players com
peted in the Bank of the West, it was the
international contingent who made the
most noise. In the singles final, 20-year-old
Russian and No. 1 seed Anna Chakvetadze
defeated unseeded Indian Sania Mirza 6-3,
6-2. Chakvetadze moved up to No. 6 in this
week's WTA rankings, a career high after
her back-to-back titles at Cincinnati and
Stanford. Mirza moved up from No. 35 last
week to No. 31 this week in the singles
rankings, matching her career high.
The final singles match featured almost
no net play, with both players slugging it
out from the baseline. Though
Chakvetadze turned in seven double faults
in the first set, her baseline play was solid,
which allowed her to prevail over the hard
hitting Mirza. Usually it was Mir/.a who
determined the fate of a rally by crushing a
winner or, more often, committing an
unforced error.
Following the singles championship,
both players returned to court 30 minutes
later to compete in the doubles champi
onship match. It was the first year that both
singles finalists also reached the doubles
final of the Bank of the West since 1997,
when Martina Hingis routed Conchita
Martinez 6-0, 6-2 in the singles title match
before teaming up with Lindsay
Davenport to overpower Martinez and
Patricia Tarabini 6-1, 6-3 for the doubles
title.
Chakvetadze could not follow in
Hingis' footsteps to take home two cham
pionships in one day, however. Much to
the delight of the Mirza's vocal Indian fan
base, Mirza and her Israeli partner Shahar
Peer, the No. 3 seeded doubles squad, took
down the unseeded team of Chakvetadze
and Belarussian Victoria Azarenka in two
exciting, hard-fought sets 6-4, 7-6 (5).
Chakvetadze and Mirza seemed con
tent to split the titles, passing the time
between awards ceremonies chatting and
paying each other compliments during
their speeches.
'i played very consistent tennis, and I
am confident that I can continue to do that
in future tournaments," Mi/.ra said, while
Chakvetadze called her win "a great feel
ing."
