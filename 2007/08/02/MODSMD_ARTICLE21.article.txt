# The 						celebration in Iraq
## 
### 
Halfway around the world,
something strange is going on.
In Baghdad, men, women and chil
dren are filling the streets, wrapped in
national Hags and celebrating with
each other in unadulterated peace
and joy.
Sunnis and Shiites are dancing
together, putting their differences
aside to share the euphoria.
And in Jakarta, Indonesia, 15 soc
cer players and their coach are still
basking in the honor and pride that
they brought to their nation in captur
ing the Asian Cup, Iraq's first title
ever. With a goal by captain Younis
Mahmoud in the 71st minute, the
Iraqis sealed victory against 3-time
champion Saudi Arabia this past
Sunday.
The game was emblematic of the
rest of the tournament; Iraq came in
as a huge underdog against the heavi
ly favored Saudis. But playing with
the weight of a broken nation on their
shoulders, the Iraqis relied on tena
cious defense and timely scoring to
stun their opponents.
"This is such a moment of joy and
pride for the entire nation," Iraq goal
keeper Noor Sabri said to The
Scotsman. "The entire country cele
brated. leaving aside all their preju
dices.
"What does this mean? The peo
ple of Iraq pushed us to this win and
we owe this to them."
The team's inspiration wasn't
exclusive to Sunday, though. Iraq
shocked tournament favorite
Australia in the preliminary rounds,
3-1. The team also beat Vietnam 2-0
in the quarterfinals and came out on
top against South Korea in a 0-0 semi
final match that was won 4-3 on
penalty kicks. Despite their status as
heavy underdogs coming into the
Asian Cup, the Iraqis didn't lose a sin
gle game over the span of the tourna
ment.
The team had to battle with more
than just its opponents, too. Just four
days before its 1-0 win over the
Saudis, a suicide bombing in Baghdad
killed 51 fans celebrating the previous
win over South Korea. This weighed
on the minds of the players as they
brought glory to their country.

Arabia restored national pride and
unity to a people in desperate need of
just that, at least for the time being.
Because when it comes to soccer, it's
not about black and white, Sunni.
Shiite or Kurd â€” it's not about who
you are; it's about what you do. And
for the past few weeks, it was about
the efforts of 15 men, putting togeth
er everything that they had in com
peting for their country.
And for many back in homeland
Iraq, it was more than just that. It was
about hope.
I'm not here to talk about politics
or the current situation in Iraq.
What's done is done. But in the
meantime, it's easy to forget about

the living and breathing people that
the current situation has drastically
affected. Facing threats of violence,
suicide bombers and general unrest,
Iraqis have it hard. And despite the
currently bleak outlook for the coun
try, things are probably going to get a
lot worse before they get a lot better.
But a glimmer of hope made its
way into the streets on Sunday. Not
worrying about the terror, the vio
lence or their religious and ethnic
affiliations, Iraqis were able to cele
brate the improbable triumph of their
beloved team. Forgetting the atroci-

ties they face on a day-to-day,
moment-by-moment basis, for one
time the people of Iraq were able to
express themselves in primal screams
of ecstasy and joy, rather than of rage
and terror.
Soccer might be just a sport: a
simple game based around a ball, 11
players on a team and two goalposts.
As this weekend showed, though, it's
more than just that. It's about a
country and its people. It's about
having the hope and strength to
move forward in times of turmoil
and death.

With all the bad and disheartening
things that have clouded the forefront
of the sports world in the last few
weeks, it's refreshing to finally hear a
story that didn't involve Michael
Vick, Bud Selig or Tim Donaghy.
But I'm not the one to talk on all
of this. I write this piece worlds away
from war and chaos, sitting in the sub
urban strongholds of Los Angeles,
Calif. I'll leave the last few words of
this column to Iraq coach Jorvan
Vieira, who put it best:
"This is not just about football ...
this is more important than that," he
said to The Scotsman. "This has
brought great happiness to a whole
country.
"This is not about a team, this is
about human beings."
