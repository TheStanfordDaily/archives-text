# The
						celebration in Iraq
## 
### 
Halfway around the world,
something strange is going on.
In Baghdad, men, women and chil
dren are filling the streets, wrapped in
national Hags and celebrating with
each other in unadulterated peace
and joy.
Sunnis and Shiites are dancing
together, putting their differences
aside to share the euphoria.
And in Jakarta, Indonesia, 15 soc
cer players and their coach are still
basking in the honor and pride that
they brought to their nation in captur
ing the Asian Cup, Iraq's first title
ever. With a goal by captain Younis
Mahmoud in the 71st minute, the
Iraqis sealed victory against 3-time
champion Saudi Arabia this past
Sunday.
The game was emblematic of the
rest of the tournament; Iraq came in
as a huge underdog against the heavi
ly favored Saudis. But playing with
the weight of a broken nation on their
shoulders, the Iraqis relied on tena
cious defense and timely scoring to
stun their opponents.
"This is such a moment of joy and
pride for the entire nation," Iraq goal
keeper Noor Sabri said to The
Scotsman. "The entire country cele
brated. leaving aside all their preju
dices.
"What does this mean? The peo
ple of Iraq pushed us to this win and
we owe this to them."
The team's inspiration wasn't
exclusive to Sunday, though. Iraq
shocked tournament favorite
Australia in the preliminary rounds,
3-1. The team also beat Vietnam 2-0
in the quarterfinals and came out on
top against South Korea in a 0-0 semi
final match that was won 4-3 on
penalty kicks. Despite their status as
heavy underdogs coming into the
Asian Cup, the Iraqis didn't lose a sin
gle game over the span of the tourna
ment.
The team had to battle with more
than just its opponents, too. Just four
days before its 1-0 win over the
Saudis, a suicide bombing in Baghdad
killed 51 fans celebrating the previous
win over South Korea. This weighed
on the minds of the players as they
brought glory to their country.
