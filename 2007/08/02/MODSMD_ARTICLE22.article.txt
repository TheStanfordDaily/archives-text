## Harbaugh, experts pick USC in Pac-10 
### KEN PETERS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - New
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh's pre
season rankings have the Southern
California Trojans at No. 1 â€”possi-
bly of all time. "There is no question
in my mind that USC is the best team
in the country and may be the best
team in the history of college loot
ball," Harbaugh said Thursday at the
Pac-10 football coaches' annual
media day.
USC coach Pete Carroll smiled
when he came to the podium later
and was told of Harbaugh's assess
ment, which might put some added
pressure on the Trojans. "You've
gotta love Jim, huh? I'm glad he
thinks that," Carroll said. "There's
no way 1 would have any way of
understanding what that's all about.
"We're just a bunch of guys trying to
put together a terrific team, and we'll
see how far that takes us."
Alter pausing for a moment,
Carroll grinned and added quietly,
"Thanks, Jim."
The four-time defending Pac-10
champion Trojans were selected for
the fifth year in a row as the favorite
to win the conference title. They
received all 39 first-place votes in a
preseason poll of media members
who regularly cover the conference.
Only three times in the 46 years of
the poll has a team been an unani

mous preseason pick to win the title
_ and it's been USC every time,
including 2(X)4 and 2005.
For the fourth consecutive year,
California was picked to finish sec
ond. The Golden Bears tied USC for
the league championship last season
when both finished with 7-2 confer
ence records.
The Trojans got 390 points in this
year's balloting, with 10 points for
No. 1 in the conference and one
point for No. 10. Cal received 323
points, and UCLA was third with
305.
Arizona State (242 points) and
Oregon State (237) rounded out the
top five, followed by Oregon (226),
Arizona (162), Washington State
(115), Washington (98) and Stanford
(47).
The poll has correctly predicted
the Pac-10 winner 24 of 46 years, and
has been right seven years in a row.
Former Washington State, Miami,
Oregon State and NFL coach Dennis
Erickson. back in the Pac-10 with
Arizona State, said the Trojans
should be in the NFL.
"They're as good as there is in the
country," he said.
Washington State coach Bill Doha
considers the Pac-10 relatively well
balanced, with the exception of the
Trojans.
"USC obviously is the cream of
the crop right now. I think the rest of
the league is pretty even," Doha said.
