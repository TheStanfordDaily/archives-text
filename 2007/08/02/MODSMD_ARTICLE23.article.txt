## AT THE MOVIES "HOT ROD" could use some repairs 
### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION HOTTIE 
SM.-fueled farces glorifying once
unsung professions have become a
box-office go to staple. Pick a job,
anv job! Call Will Ferrell (or any
available SNL proxy), sit back and let
the cash roll in. Having already
enshrined anchormen and NASCAR
drivers soundly within the pantheon
of cinematic greatness, "Hot Rod"
pays homage to the truly overlooked
last action hero, the stuntman.
And not even one of those classy,
'established' union member stuntmen;
tins is the story of Rod Kimble (Andy
Samberg — whom I hear spends vari
ous lazy Sundays with his dick in a box
... oh. those cra/.y kids), an aspiring
daredevil with a dream. What dream?
To summarily kick the shit out of his
elderly stepfather in hand-to-hand
combat, of course. Hey. not everyone
can afford a family therapist and drugs
to work out their "daddy issues."
Alas, that rat-bastard fate ruthless
ly preempts Rod's whoopassin'
dreams by afflicting his stepdad
(Deadwood's lan McShane) with a
life threatening illness. Since the
Kimble family lacks the coverage and
dough to bankroll the costly opera
tion. Rod logically decides to raise the
money by becoming a stuntman
extiaordinaire. As you can tell, this
premise is steeped in reality.
Hveryone knows countries boasting
socialized medical systems are 60%
less likely to produce amateur stunt
men. It's science.
With that. Rod, his half-brother
Kevin (Jorma Taccona, also of
"Lonely Planet") and compadre
Dave (fellow SNL-er Bill Hader)
commence training and raising the
money necessary to stage the 'big
jump' to earn that elusive $50,(XH).
Really, the "plot" amounts to
Samberg catching fire, smashing into
objects and things generally explod

ing. It's "Jackass" with snippets of
dialogue and random crap in
between. So does Rod fulfill his des
tiny, get the girl, save his stepfather
and then commence the beatdown
shortly thereafter? Who the fuck
cares?! The folks behind the movie
didn't; just enjoy the ride. Almost like
porn, you get the sense that everyone
onscreen is just waiting out the dia
logue until the real shit goes down.
"Hot Rod" fronts no pretense of
ambition. The barebones plot is
almost begrudgingly fleshed out sim
ply so this can meet the definition of a
movie — not just an amalgam of
"Lonely Planet" or SNI. shorts.
Indeed, its best moments stem from
random tangents and bizarre side
gags. It's almost as though Samberg &
co were given this story as a lame
premise to improvise with on "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?"
Whether punchfighting ala
"Footloose," bursting into flames at a
children's birthday party, making an
old man crap himself or just giving the
camera one of his patented oil-center
smiles, Samberg may not have quite
found his cinematic sweet spot yet,
but it could've been a lot worse. Isla
Fisher (a.k.a the future Mrs. Sascha
Baron Cohen) is woefully underused
as Rod's would-be love interest;
Kimble must win her from her schem
ing assbag of a boyfriend, played by
Will Arnett.
On a basic level, "Hot Rod'
remains hamstrung by stars, writers
and a director who boast an uncanny
talent for digital shorts but strain to
sustain humor for 90-minutes. Where
past SNL catastrophes took one-joke
characters and futilely attempted to
build a cogent plot around them, the
"Lonely Planet" boys spurn the
notion of a story arc and haphazard
ly weave a series bits together. Ihe
result has is its moments; few, how

ever, elicit the uproarious laughter
of even one will-timed Adam
Sandler doodie joke.
"Hot Rod" sets its sights low
but delivers on all the basics. While
Andy Samburg's first foray onto
the big screen does not crash and
burn, it hardly constitutes a risky,
let alone death-defying stunt.
