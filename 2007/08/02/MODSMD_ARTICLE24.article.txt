# AFTER THE MOVIE
## Stars of "Hot Rod" heat it up 
### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION HOTTIE 
Intermission sits in on an inti
mate, except for the other 4(H)
terrifying people, Q & A wIthe
"Lonely Planet" comedy team to
discuss "Hot Rod." First, we must
set the scene accordingly:
Movie ends. Star Andy Samburg,
co-star Jorma Taccone and direc
tor Akiva Schaffer step to the
front of the theater.The three
makes the obligatory/shameless,
"We're from the Bay Area refer
ence" ... the audience seems
nonetheless enthralled to no end.
The audience, comprised of a
frigliteningly large and loud
"Lonely Planet" contingent com
mence asking questions which
seem only slightly less absurd after
having watched "Hot Rod".
Given the throngs of eager askers
of inane questions, your
Intermission reporter struggled to
jot down and attribute quotes with
one hand, while raising his hand
to be recognized with his freehand
(hehe — freehand, that's sexual!)
Q: Now that you're famous, whose
ass can you kick?
Samberg: Akiva's (stares at Akiva
suggestively).
(the audience rejoices with giddy,
free-movie screening induced
enthusiasm)
Q: We saw how this battle turned
out in the movie, but who do you

think would win a fight between a
taco and grilled-cheese sandwich?
Sambcrg: I think Denise
(Intermission reporter to this day
has no due who the hell Denise is
and when she formulated said
opinion.) got it right the tirst time.
Really, if you follow the logic laid
out in the movie, grilled cheesc
wins in a fair fight. Yes, follow the
logic of this movie. (Says some
thing else which makes the follow
ing apparently comprehensible)
Sure, it's racist... but it's true! It's
a cruel world.
Akiva: So far, these are the best
questions ever.
Q: Did you do your own stunts in
the movie?
Sambcrg: Only a few. To be hon
est I was saving my best stuff for
"Harry Potter," "Die Hard" and
"Bourne Ultimatum" ... which
also comes out on August 3rd
but don't watch that... watch this
(said to the crowd of people who
just watched Hot Rod for free). 1
was saving all the good action lor
these other movies... screw this lit
tle thing.
Q: What advice would you give an
aspiring Ninja?
Akiva ... or Jorma ... who knows:
Um, Chlamydia?
(audience seems both amused and
sated... hut then:)
Samhcrg: You completely ditched
the advice part of the question! It
should have been, "Don't get
Chlamydia, aspiring ninja."

Q: Andy, you've made no secret
of your love for sandwiches.
What's your favorite?
Samberg (conveniently standing
between Akiva and Jorma):
You're looking at it. (cuddles the
two in closer)
(audience basks in the palpable
undercurrent of man-love)
Q: Did you freestyle the punch
dance you performed in the
movie?
Samberg: Nah, it all came down
to Kevin Bacon. You all owe a lot
of stuff to Kevin Bacon. Many of
you would not exist if not tor
Kevin Bacon's on screen perfor
mances. His punch dance —
undeniably one yf the most
boner-inducing clips of all time.
Man, the day we shot that ... the
trees were dripping with sex.
(Intermission report is confused
and upset ... but kind of likes it
and doesn't know why.)
(And then, after II failed attempts
at recognition, they recognize me
and my now battle-weary raised,
left-hand — this, too, has sexual
undertones.)
INTERMISSION: How much of
what we just saw on screen was
actually in the script and how
much of it was just you guys
screwing around?
Akiva: Much of it was planned —
you can't improvise a car explo

sion. But there were plenty of stuff
done on the fly. Like the scene with
Rico holding the TV after the riot
that wasn't in the script. I just asked
a prop guy to bring a TV and it
ended up extending a bit.
(Akiva keeps talking for another
minute listing off stuff ... while
Intermission reporter gets the evil eye

from a mom in the audience for
dropping the f-bomb in front of her
kiddie. Hut seriously, who takes their
toddler to see "Hot Rod"?!?!)
Q: So you saw us watching and react
ing to the movie. Was there any
scene where you expected more of a
reaction than you got?
Akiva: Actually, we weren't in
here when ya'll watched it. But
we've screened the movie for test
audience and changed a lot of stuff.
Some things we had to cut because
it got weirdly sexual and creeped

people out. At one point a charac
ter yells, "Bets your bahv wiener
and let me suck on it." The audi
ence had been on board the whole
way ... but that's where they drew
the line.
Q: I low was it performing "Dick in a
Box" in Madison Square Garden?
Samhcrg: Ridiculous. Timberlake
blessed us with his hotness skills —
18 thousand screaming ladies.
Lcss-than-tactful follow up Q: You
should perform with him again ... at

the San Jose concert on August 6th.
{Yeah, this was a statement, not a
question.)
Sambcrg: Yeah, you should totally
text him that.
(audience erupts in laughter and
appreciation of a 29-year-old using
their "lingo".)
Sanihcrg (sealing the deal): No
"J/K"s!
And with that, the trio departs...to
the next theater which began its
"Hot Rod" Screening 40 minutes
later ... so many Q & A sessions, so
little time.
