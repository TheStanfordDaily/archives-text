## Stanford Theater takes on Africa 
### SYED SAYEED INTERMISSION TRAVELER 
Watching Stanford Summer Theater's pro
duction of Lorraine Hansberry's "Les
Blancs" this past Saturday, I was troubled as I
saw struggle within struggle within struggle. I
watched, enthralled, as freedom fighters ral
lied villagers: "Send us warriors! KILL THE
INVADER!" I was moved as I watched three
brothers trying to pull each other together as
politics, race and beliefs tore them apart.
The play, which was written as rebels
fought for the independence of the Belgian
Congo in the 19505, offers more than a
glimpse at a turbulent moment in history.
The destructive legacy of colonialism that
persists to this day in Africa is one of the
thought-provoking subject matters that
emerges in Stanford 2(K)7 Summer Theater's
summer festival, entitled Africa on Stage.
For the last ten years, Stanford Summer
Theater has put on a series of summer the
ater festivals. The project brings professional
actors to campus to perform in plays that
locus on one theme. This year's program
includes performances of four plays:
Lorraine Hansberry's "Les Blancs." Dan
Hoyle's "Tings Dey Happen," Femi
Osofisan's "Farewell to Cannibal Rage" and
Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin's "Oda Oak
Oracle." It also includes an 8-week series of
free films that all relate to Africa.
Rush Rehm, the Stanford Drama
Professor and Stanford Summer Theater
Artistic Director, has been working on the
project since the fall of 2(X)6. The African
focus, he said, arose after a friend decided to
adopt a child from Africa. This led him to
pursue a latent interest in Africa (he'd lived
in Egypt in 1977); he then joined Stanford's
Committee on African Studies and the
African Studies Association. The Africa
themed festival also was inspired by Rehm's
interest in staging Hansberry's "Les Blancs."
"The play deals with the issues of race,
colonialism, revolutionary struggle and resis
tance to occupation with intelligence, passion
and deep insight, viewing these realities from

a variety of perspectives." Rehm said. "'Les
Blancs' is frighteningly contemporary,
extending its resonances beyond Africa to
the war in Iraq, to the occupation of the West
Bank and to other comparable situations."
The themes of this year's performances
are provocative and challenging. "Les
Blancs," for example, left me questioning
where exactly my loyalties laid in the struggle
between colonizers and rebels.
"It's remarkable how a play written more
than forty years ago is still so relevant to
many of the conflicts in the world today,"
said Stanford Summer Theater producer
Amanda Gelender. "Hansberry's play, writ
ten decades before America's War on Terror,
blurs the line between 'terrorist' and 'free
dom fighter' for example," she pointed out.
"The ethical debates regarding military occu
pation and colonialism that this play under
takes are still pressing today."
The festival approaches present day con
flicts as well as African culture more general
ly, showcasing a diverse array of dramatic
performances.
Dan Hoyle's "Tings Dey Happen," per
formed July 5 through July 8, addressed poli
tics in Nigeria, a nation where enormous oil
profits accompany harsh inequity and
oppression. The one-man show, written and
performed by Hoyle, follows an array of
characters, ranging from prostitutes to the
American ambassador to Nigeria as it weaves
an image of the situation in the country.
While Hoyle's and Hansberry's produc
tions address politics, "Farewell To Cannibal
Rage" and "Oda Oak Oracle" offer a
glimpse of African culture through an
African lens. "Farewell to Cannibal Rage"
follows a Romeo-and-Juliet story based in
Africa using music, dance and improvisation.
"Oda Oak Oracle" addresses the range of
religious traditions that have influenced
Alrica, and features African performers.
"Farewell to Cannibal Rage" is playing from
August 9-12, and "Oda Oak Oracle" is play
ing from Aug 23 through Aug. 26. See
