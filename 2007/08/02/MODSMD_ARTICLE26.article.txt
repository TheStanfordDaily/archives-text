## Jazz giants assemble in Dink 
### ALEX COLEY INTERMISSION 
Kenny Barron, celebrated jazz
pianist, is glad to he at Stanford.
"It's hot as hell in New York," the
onetime partner of Dizzy Gillespie
remarked as he took the
Dinkelspiel stage this past Sunday
along with fellow virtuosos Terrell
Stafford (trumpet), Dayna
Stephens (tenor saxophone). Matt
Wilson (drums) and John Wiitala
(bass), as they prepared to execute
yet another successful show in the
star-studded Stanford Jazz Festival
lineup.
I he crowd, mostly comprised of
Stanford Jazz Workshop students,
their parents and area locals, was
treated to a superb performance by
the quintet, which was performing
together for the first time. The set
was a healthy mix of standards: a
cool rendition of "Softly as a
Morning Sunrise" to open the show;
a couple of Barron originals (han

dled admirably by all); one groovy
Bossa Nova and a Thelonious
Monk tune that had the jazz savvy
audience juiced.
Barron had the look of a wizard,
hunched over the keys like he was
incanting spells. But the magic was
all in his lingers. His duet perfor
mance with Stafford (on flugelhorn)
of a classic ballad, "Blame it on my
Youth," was a highlight of the show.
Barron's solo, deftly lingered and
interlaced with poignant pauses,
achieved a tenderness and warmth
that is rare. The tune, aptly titled,
immediately leaped to youth
anthem status in this young review
er's mind.
But it was Terrell Stafford's
explosive energy on trumpet that
really stole the show. A former
member of McCoy Tyner's Latin
All-Star Band, Stafford showcased
this Latin influence with flair,
injecting fiery tone into much of his
playing. A truly gifted musician.
Stafford is a recipient of well

deserved accolades. His solos were
atmospheric and by all rights virtu
osic, his stage presence a sight to
behold. Equally impressive was
Stafford's ability to alternate flugel
horn with trumpet, providing a neat
tonal juxtaposition of liquid and
fire.
The other members performed
wonderfully. Matt Wilson, one of
the best drummers in the business,
proved he is master of the entire
drum kit. literally playing the rim of
his snare as well as the drumhead.
Dayna Stephens on tenor and
bassist John Wiitala, both affiliated
with the Stanford Jazz Workshop,
produced inspired solos all night
long.
Barron, et al. will be on campus
all week, performing in various
events as the Workshop comes to a
close. The Festival culminates this
weekend with an All-Star Jam
Session on Friday and a Lee Konitz
concert on Saturday. Jazz fans â€”
you don't want to miss out.
