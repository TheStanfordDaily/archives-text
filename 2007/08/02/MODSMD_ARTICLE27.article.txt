## Yosemite illuminated 
### NICK PARKER INTERMISSION NEOPHYTE 
The writing is on the wall of the Cantor Arts
Center's Ruth Levinson Halpern Gallery, home
of the museum's newest exhibition: "Yosemite's
Structure and Textures," which opened last
Wednesday and will remain at Cantor until Oct.
28.
"The park is a paradise that makes even the
loss of Eden seem insignificant," wrote the nat
uralist John Muir in 1900 in reference to
Yosemite, which is the subject of more than 50
black and white photographs and maps on dis
play in a minimalist exhibit on the museum's
second floor.
In addition to Ansel Adams' iconic portraits
of the park, the gallery also features a number of
photographs from some of the first outsiders to
visit Yosemite. Carleton Watkins, Eadweard
Muvbridge and George Fiske — all 19th centu
ry artists — lugged their old-fashioned cameras
to the often-vertiginous vantage points, from
which they captured some of the first images of
the park.
Watkins, Muybridge and Fiske shared more
than just photographic genius and a love for
wilderness, however. Each artist's life was
tumultuous and, ultimately, tragic. Watkins
(1829-1916) spent much of the 1 S6f)s in
Yosemite and specialized in 15 x 20 inch mam
moth-plate prints. Watkins' work was influential
in convincing Abraham Lincoln in 1864 to
approve the Yosemite Grant, which laid the
groundwork for the creation of Yosemite
National Park in 1890. Watkins was successful in
his time, but the 1906 San Francisco earthquake
destroyed his studio and the dejected artist was
declared mentally insane in 1909.
Muybridge (1830-1904) is the only non-
American whose work is on display in the exhib
it. After suffering brain damage in an 1860 stage
coach accident, the Englishman traveled to the
park in the 1860 sand 1870s. Muybridge. like
Watkins, focused on Yosemite's distinctive fea
tures, but his photographic career was derailed
in 1875 when he was tried and acquitted for
murdering his wife's lover before being struck

by a car and killed in 1904.
Fiske (1835-1918) photographed the park in
the 1870s and 1 S8()s before his house burned and
many of his negatives were destroyed in 1904.
One of the first outsiders to spend a winter in
Yosemite, Fiske committed suicide at his home
in the park in 1918.
Of the 19th century artists, Watkins' work
stands out as the most engaging and the most
eye-catching. I lis mammoth-plate prints capture
the essence of Yosemite — the rich contrast of
the park is clearly evident in his photographs
nearly 150 years after they were produced.
Particularly striking is his ISM print "Tasayac,
The Half Dome," which depicts the majestic
granite monolith standing guard above Mirror
Lake, whose placid waters have an almost mag
ical quality. The blurred ripples (likely a result of
the long exposure time necessary in the 19th
century) call attention to the sharp foliage on the
shore and the tear-streaked face of Half Dome.
Watkins' 1861 "Piwyac, The Vernal Fall"
captures the same blurred, static quality of water
as the Merced river cascades over a 300-foot
waterfall, and his 1866 photographs "The
Domes from the Sentinel Dome" and "The
Vernal and Nevada Fall" offer the same timeless
views of the domes and waterfalls that surround
the periphery of Yosemite Valley that visitors to
Glacier Point enjoy today.
In contrast to Watkins' mammoth prints, the
photographs of Muybridge and Fiske are small
and relatively uninspiring. Both artists were
trailblazers in the art of scrambling to striking
vantage points to capture a distinctive and
unique perspective on Yosemite's photogenic
features, and Muybridge pioneered the move
ment to introduce clouds into previously cloud
less prints. (The long exposure time required by
19th century cameras meant that clouds were
usually omitted from photographs.) Despite
their status as innovators, however, the work of
Muybridge and Fiske has not stood the test of
time as well as Watkins' photographs, which
bear a striking resemblance to the 20th century
work of Ansel Adams.
Adams (1902-1984) first visited Yosemite as
a teenager in 1916 and used his heart-stopping
photographs to bring the park into the public
eye for the next 50 years. Often credited with
launching and catalyzing the modern environ
mental movement, Adams had such a strong
impact on Yosemite that a large swath of wilder
ness that lies just outside the park now bears his
name.
Many of Adams' most compelling photos of
the park (and, indeed, many of those on display
at Cantor) were taken during the dead of win
ter, when the artist could most effectively cap
ture Yosemite's striking contrasts. Perhaps his
most famous portrait of the park, the 1960 pho
tograph he called "Moon and Half Dome,"
unveils the frosted cap of the iconic granite
dome bathed in the light of a full moon.
"Clearing Winter Storm" (1944) is another
example of Adams' uncommon photographic
vision. As low-hanging, ominous storm clouds
drift through the valley, seemingly sweeping the
treetops on their methodical march, shimmer
ing Bridalveil Fall and the hulking face of HI
Capitan pierce the winter air in the foreground.
Many of Adams' wintertime photographs —
including those he took in the high country at
Tuolumne Meadows and one that features for
mer University president Donald Tresidder '19
cross-country skiing in the Yosemite backcountry
— highlight the contrast between sheet-white
snow and dark gray granite that makes Adams'
work so striking and so accessible.
Despite the generational gap between
Watkins (and Muybridge and Fiske) and
Adams, the artists' photographs are remarkably
similar. In a way, the Cantor exhibit that juxta
poses their work allows Watkins and Adams to
transcend time, just as the park they pho
tographed remains every bit as wild and capti
vating today as it was 150 years ago.
