## Bourne again...for the last time? 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION 
Who needs tuxedoes, shaken-or
stirred-it-doesn't-matter martinis
and ridiculously drawn-out poker
games when you've got Jason
Bourne? He represents a new era of
spy movie, one fitted for our dark
age of war and big budgets. There is
no girlfriend of the evil boss to steal
away, or casinos to look suave in. In
fact, there isn't a single witty remark
at all; Matl Damon, the title charac
ter, is dead serious for two hours
straight. And we love him for it.
"The Bourne Ultimatum" is the
third, and most likely final, install
ment in the Bourne series, based on
books by Robert Ludlum. It's hard
to say for sure, though, as the first
two films both had neat, comprehen
sive endings, and look where we are
now. Damon commented in an inter
view that it would be hard to make a
fourth, considering the lack of an
available plot, and he's right: after
three films, there isn't much Bourne
left to cover.
This installment is the most
straightforward. A semi-amnesiac
after being thrown into the water
after an aborted mission in the first
film. Bourne remains haunted by his
past, which he can never quite
resolve. He wants to find his true
identity, to know where he came
from, to return to his pre-superagent
self. In order to do so. he has to kick
a lot of ass around the world, includ

ing most Western European capi
tals. Africa and New York City.
Directed by Paul Greengrass, who
also directed the overdone second
Bourne movie, "The Bourne
Supremacy," this film shares all the
hallmarks of the Bourne films
very quick cuts with the camera, a
fast-paced, drum-heavy score, CIA
bureaucrats in rimless glasses bark
ing out orders, blurry flashbacks and
incredibly elaborate car chase
scenes. They're all here, alive and
well.
There is no romantic intrigue in
this one, despite the presence of
Julia Stiles, and the emotional
weight of "The Bourne Legacy" is
lost in the elaborate car chase
scenes (with the trademark shaky
hand-held camera) and tense
moments in CIA situation rooms.
There simply isn't much emotion
left, most of it already being sorted
out in the first two; but the action
scenes are certainly distracting, if
not compelling, and make up for
any lacking emotional depth. The
chase scenes and gunfights are the
best of the trilogy. Bourne, howev
er. does return to the training facili
ty when he was first inducted into
the superagent training program
(which includes waterboarding
Bourne), which is moving, and
eventually finds out his true identi
ty.
Unlike the first two films, howev
er, Greengrass puts his toe, but just
his toe, into the pool of heavy ideas.

SPOILER ALHRT: The final scene,
with Bourne in the water after hav
ing jumped off a building, is reminis
cent of the first scene of the first
film. There's also the question of the
CIA essentially having a blank
check to carry out extralegal opera
tions, including Operation
Treadstone (or Blackbriar, or what
ever it became in this film), which
Bourne came out of. The shadowy
evil boss of the film, who we only see
a few times, turns out to be the CIA
director, showing that an illegal con
spiracy can reach all the way to the
top. The message here, of course, is
that intelligence operations should
come with strong Congressional
oversight, and the public would be
outraged if it knew some of the
ClA's more insidious activities.
There is even a whistleblower at the
end.
Damon, Stiles, David Strathairn
(Edward Murrow in "Good Night
and Good Luck"), Joan Allen and
others all turn in pitch-perfect per
formances. The star remains
Damon, however, who's built an
eye-popping critical career, with
films such as "Good Will Hunting,"
"The Good Shepherd," "The
Departed," the Ocean's films and
"Syriana." He's at his best here,
which keeps the film moving along
briskly, if not at a breakneck pace.
We witness what might be the end of
Jason Bourne, and I, for one, am
reluctant to return to tuxedoes and
casinos.
