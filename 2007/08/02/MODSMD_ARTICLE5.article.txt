## MEDICAL SCHOOL Heating system's efficiency draws debate 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The engineering teams of Stanford Medical
School's inadequately budgeted Redwood City
outpatient facility have recently come under
fire for allegedly sacrificing energy efficiency in
an attempt to cut down on swelling costs. In
light of President John Hennessy's repeated
calls for the University to "lead the way" in
global sustainability efforts, critics have called
the engineers' decision-making evidence of
Stanford's hypocrisy and baffling fiscal short
sightedness.
According to Steve Dobberstein, a senior
engineer at the Norman S. Wright Company,
Stanford's contractors turned down a highly

efficient heating, ventilation and air condition
ing (HVAC) system designed by his firm in
order to save roughly $8(K).(XX) in initial costs.
His firm's HVAC equipment utilized an
advanced heat recovery system that would have
eliminated the need for natural gas.
By Dobberstein's calculations, the equip
ment chosen bv the University will use MX) kilo
watts more electricity to cool the buildings on a
hot day and 15 million BTUH of gas to heat the
buildings on a cold day. To put things in per
spective, he claimed that the difference
between the two systems equals the carbon
dioxide impact equivalent of 312 cars on the
road driving 12,(MX) miles per every year of the
building's operation.
Critics see the energy inefficient equipment

as contradictory to the University's public aspi
rations of being a leader among environmental
ly conscious academic institutions.
In 2(X)2. the University created the multi
million dollar Stanford Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP). The director of the
project at the time, Lynn Orr, said that GCEP's
goals would include "identifying the most
promising technologies for low-emission, high
efficiency energy supplies and overcoming
legal, safety and cost barriers."
At the 2(X)4 launch of the Stanford Institute
for the Environment, Hennessy said that
Stanford is "uniquely positioned to lead the
way and to make a difference in this worthwhile
effort." Last fall, Hennessy announced the
Stanford Challenge, which included a $250 mil

lion fundraising campaign for the Initiative on
the Environment and Sustainability.
II the $800,(KM) figure given by Dobberstein
is accurate, the amount would represent a small
fraction of the $200 million budgeted for the
facility, and an even smaller percentage of the
money used for the Medical School's frequent
construction projects, which include an immi
nent multi-billion dollar renovation at the main
hospital campus.
"On paper, Stanford wanted to be green and
look for ways to reduce energy use," said
Wayne Womer, the liaison for the Stanford
project from Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E),
which supplies the utilities for the facility. "Now
they don't want to go with it because
of the expense."
Womer confirmed that the con
struction teams had shelved the orig
inal setup for a cheaper, less efficient
option.
"The original installation
would've saved them 1.1 million kilo
watt hours and 176,(XX) therms per
year," Womer said. "The project was
way under-budgeted, and something
had to be cut."
Mark Tortorich, Stanford
Hospital's vice president of planning,
designing and construction,
explained that a robust construction
economy worldwide has driven
prices up by 10-12 percent, and as a
result, the University found its pock
ets shallower than expected.
"We've been a victim of that just
like every other owner [of build
ings]," he said.
The engineers' solution, Tortorich
said, was "value-engineering," a term
that simply means saving money by
cutting components while keeping as
much functionality and efficiency as
possible.
Certain architectural embellish
ments have already been nixed, and
the original HVAC systems were
another casualty of the capital opti
mization process.
In order for the original equip
ment to fit, Tortorich said, the archi

tectural screen on the roof of the
building would have to be raised.
More steel would be needed, and
another structure spanning the
height of the roof to the foundation
would have to be built to support the
additional weight of the screen and
the equipment.
Dobberstein claimed, however,
that the system had been redesigned
to accommodate the architectural
screen and Stanford's changing
needs. He also said that the decision
did not make long-term financial
sense, arguing that the electric and
gas savings of the original system
were worth $240,(XX) per year, and
that installation would have been
$15(),(XX) cheaper, since the equip
ment did not use natural gas and did
not necessitate additional wiring
requirements.
Furthermore, California law pro
vides incentives for corporate energy
efficiency by allowing building own
ers to claim a rebate with PG&E for
exceeding efficiency standards.
Womer calculated the original rebate
to be $430,(XX). The new, less efficient
system will garner a considerably
lesser rebate, Womer said, although
he has yet to receive the information
from Stanford needed to recalculate
the exact amount.
Tortorich dismissed any claims
that the PCi&E rebate plus the annu
al energy savings would outweigh the
initial expenses of the efficient sys
tem in the short run.
"There's no payback to the hospi

tal through increased savings and
energy consumption for a long, long
time," he said.
Tortorich said that altering the
architectural screen alone would cost
$4(X),(XK), plus the energy efficient
equipment would have cost "mil
lions" of dollars, dwarfing
Dobberstein's figure of $8(X),(XX).
Later, however, when asked again
if the less efficient system would save
the University less than $1 million in
initial costs, Tortorich said: "That's
undetermined."
He added that Stanford takes its
environmental responsibilities very
seriously. Double-glazed sunscreens
have been installed to the windows
on three sides of the building to insu
late heat, he said, which represent an
investment of $3-4 million.
"There are other ways to create
energy savings," Tortorich said. "We
already far exceed the requirements
of the California building code.
We're able to achieve our objective
at a lower initial cost."
Some of the building project's
engineers maintained that since the
equipment has not yet been finalized,
it is be too early to pass judgment on
its efficiency.
Dick Bourne, M.S. '68, the
Director of the Western Cooling
Efficiency Center at UC-Davis, said
he doubted that any other equipment
would rival the efficiency of the prod
uct created by Des Champs, the com
pany that designed the energy effi
cient system.

"It's certainly possible that they
might find a way to accomplish the
same efficiency with less expensive
equipment," Bourne said. "But 1
can't come up with something that
would offhand."
Bourne said the efficient system
would have cost only $S(X),(XX) more
than the less efficient system to
install. Furthermore, he said the effi
cient system would have saved the
University $25(),(XX) per year, and
would therefore have paid for itself
in two years.
The news of the controversy soon
began to spread. Engineers discussed
the replacement of the HVAC sys
tem, while University officials appar
ently made efforts to handle commu
nications on the matter delicately.
Doug Henry, the on-site project
manager, did not return phone calls
from The Daily despite repeated
attempts to reach his office last
Wednesday and Thursday. When
approached at the construction site
last Friday, Henry declined to com
ment, but said that "there's a lot of
misinformation in those emails"
without elaborating on the origin of
the emails or their contents.
He did add, however, that he had
begun to collect data to present to
Tortorich, to refute the "misinforma
tion."
Jonnie Banks, the Hospital's
Public Information Officer, said she
was not aware of any emails, but told
The Daily that Henry may have been
referring to her recent memo to the

engineers, which designated which
personnel could speak to reporters
about the equipment.
Banks also explicitly prohibited
The Daily from any future unan
nounced visits to the construction site
to talk to engineers, which she said
were "not kosher." She added that all
inquiries must be directed to her
office.
During the telephone interview
with Tortorich, Banks participated in
the conference call, but spoke only
once â€”to warn Tortorich against
speaking off the record. Tortorich
confirmed that he saw "an email
chain" on his personal digital assis
tant regarding the HVAC equipment
replacement, but said that he could
not elaborate on many specifics
because negotiations with contrac
tors are still taking place.
Critics insisted that the allegations
were not an attempt to stain the
University's reputation. Rather, the
University's shroud of secrecy wors
ened concerns that Stanford's engi
neers did not appear to abide by any
financial logic.
"Here's a chance to save all this
carbon dioxide, it's either a one, two
or three year payback, and for most
companies, that's good and they
would take it," Dobberstein said.
"Stanford seems to wear being a
good neighbor on their sleeve, but
this is a poor decision."
