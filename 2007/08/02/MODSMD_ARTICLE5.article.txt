## MEDICAL SCHOOL Heating system's efficiency draws debate 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The engineering teams of Stanford Medical
School's inadequately budgeted Redwood City
outpatient facility have recently come under
fire for allegedly sacrificing energy efficiency in
an attempt to cut down on swelling costs. In
light of President John Hennessy's repeated
calls for the University to "lead the way" in
global sustainability efforts, critics have called
the engineers' decision-making evidence of
Stanford's hypocrisy and baffling fiscal short
sightedness.
According to Steve Dobberstein, a senior
engineer at the Norman S. Wright Company,
Stanford's contractors turned down a highly

efficient heating, ventilation and air condition
ing (HVAC) system designed by his firm in
order to save roughly $8(K).(XX) in initial costs.
His firm's HVAC equipment utilized an
advanced heat recovery system that would have
eliminated the need for natural gas.
By Dobberstein's calculations, the equip
ment chosen bv the University will use MX) kilo
watts more electricity to cool the buildings on a
hot day and 15 million BTUH of gas to heat the
buildings on a cold day. To put things in per
spective, he claimed that the difference
between the two systems equals the carbon
dioxide impact equivalent of 312 cars on the
road driving 12,(MX) miles per every year of the
building's operation.
Critics see the energy inefficient equipment

as contradictory to the University's public aspi
rations of being a leader among environmental
ly conscious academic institutions.
In 2(X)2. the University created the multi
million dollar Stanford Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP). The director of the
project at the time, Lynn Orr, said that GCEP's
goals would include "identifying the most
promising technologies for low-emission, high
efficiency energy supplies and overcoming
legal, safety and cost barriers."
At the 2(X)4 launch of the Stanford Institute
for the Environment, Hennessy said that
Stanford is "uniquely positioned to lead the
way and to make a difference in this worthwhile
effort." Last fall, Hennessy announced the
Stanford Challenge, which included a $250 mil

lion fundraising campaign for the Initiative on
the Environment and Sustainability.
II the $800,(KM) figure given by Dobberstein
is accurate, the amount would represent a small
fraction of the $200 million budgeted for the
facility, and an even smaller percentage of the
money used for the Medical School's frequent
construction projects, which include an immi
nent multi-billion dollar renovation at the main
hospital campus.
"On paper, Stanford wanted to be green and
look for ways to reduce energy use," said
Wayne Womer, the liaison for the Stanford
project from Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E),
which supplies the utilities for the facility. "Now
