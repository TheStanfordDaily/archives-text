## Summer school costs irk students 1,021 study at Farm, others go elsewhere 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
Ellen Truxaw '09 drags herself
out of bed at the sound of her 7 a.m.
alarm every weekday during the
summer. She rubs her eyes, remem
bering that she has been awake until
2 a.m. because of her job as a High
School Summer College mentor.
Her physics lecture doesn't start
until 8:30, but the trip to class is
more difficult than a bike ride to the
Quad. Ellen has to make the mini
mum half-hour commute from
Stanford to Santa Clara University
(SCU). Her first thought when she
wakes up, even before she begins
frantically studying for quizzes: cof
fee.
"I have to have caffeine or I'm
going to pass out," she said.
For $230 a unit, non-enrolled stu
dents like Ellen can take summer
classes at SCU. with a 15-unit
course load totaling $3,450. A com
parable number of units at Stanford
adds up to $10,998. The $7,548 Ellen
saves in tuition by commuting to
SCU was the prime reason for her
summer school switch.
"My main motivation was finan
cial, but 1 had also heard a lot of
good things about Santa Clara," she
said. "My parents really didn't want
to pay for anything. There was no
way I could pay for physics here. 1
could pay mostly for Santa Clara,
and my parents are paying the $500
difference."
Though 1,021 Stanford under
graduates take advantage of the
100-plus Stanford classes in 30
departments available over the sum
mer, the price of summer tuition
sends many students scattering to
other schools. And due to the high
price of enrollment, summer cours
es at Stanford are next-to-impossi
ble for students who typically
receive financial aid.
The Financial Aid Office (FAO)
offers limited funding for matricu
lated students. Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper reported that
approximately 30 students were
offered summer loans, while 20
were offered scholarship funds.
Students who traditionally receive
scholarships from Stanford are not
necessarily eligible — only students
facing special circumstances, such as
needing an extra quarter to gradu
ate. received grants.
Cooper admitted that students
on financial aid are at a disadvan
tage when it comes to taking sum
mer courses at Stanford because of
the price of admission. Though she
was sympathetic, she said that she
championed other alternatives to
studying at Stanford.
"I do know many financial aid

students take one class at home for
a less expensive option and seem to
manage that without significant
impact," she said. "They're able to
work and earn some money."
Cooper said that she does not
foresee a change of plans in the
FAO's philosophy towards stu
dents' financial aid because the
FAO expects students to use that
time for work and research.
"For students enrolled we do
have a summer earnings expecta
tion," she said. "We expect them to
earn at least $2,100. We're not
encouraging students to attend
Stanford in the summer because we
want them to earn money."
Nonetheless, Director of
Summer Programs Patricia Brandt
lamented Stanford's loss of financial
aid recipients in its summer courses.
"1 don't really see any reason
why [financial aid] shouldn't be
available during the summer," she
said. "It's difficult to take anything
outside your major. It's very nice if
you can come during the summer
and take some electives."
Despite the economic constraints
on both students receiving financial
aid and students whose parents are
not willing to shell out almost
$11,000 in summer tuition, hundreds
of families are willing to make the
sacrifice. Along with 1,021 under
graduates, nearly 400 high school
students take summer classes, most
of whom participate in the residen

tial High School Summer College
Program.
According to Brandt, high school
students are slightly more fortunate
than their undergraduate counter
parts when it comes to summer
finances.
"They get small grants, moderate
scholarships," she said. "Nobody
gets a full scholarship. For them, it's
to show that they can do the work
and to help with their college admis
sions."
Brandt said that 2(X)7 also serves
as the pilot year for the Stanford
Summer International Honors
Program, which brings 10 students
from universities in Mexico to
Stanford for the summer and pro
vides them with special program
ming.
Additionally, 193 undergradu
ates from other schools make the
journey to Stanford for the summer.
For many of these students and
their families, summer at Stanford
was worth the high price tag.
David Anderson, a two-time
summer student and a-rising junior
at UC-Irvine, said that his parents
were willing to foot the housing bill
and tuition because he loved
Stanford so much.
"The first time I came here, 1 did
it because 1 initially wanted to go to
Stanford, and 1 knew about their
engineering program," he said.
"The second time 1 came back
because it was just such a good

experience the first time. 1 was
going to take a class again by the
same professor and I met a bunch of
great people."
University of Wisconsin-
Madison rising sophomore Kaitlin
Murphy came to Stanford for the
summer because of the University's
strong biology program. Though
Murphy initially chose a state school
over Stanford because of the cheap
er tuition, she said a summer at
Stanford was worth the money.
"1 wanted to come here original
ly, but the University of Wisconsin
has in-state tuition so it made much
more sense," she said. "But the
tuition is costing me the same
amount to be here as it is for the
entire year at home. My parents
agreed they would pay for it. I have
to pay them back."
Stanford undergraduate Emily
Hsi '09 also noted that taking sum
mer courses elsewhere or doing an
internship instead of staying at
Stanford are options that have their
own opportunity cost for Stanford
students. She said that she appreci
ates the greater challenge of
Stanford courses, along with the
dorm atmosphere on campus.
Hsi added that staying at
Stanford to take classes reduces the
academic stress students face during
the regular school year.
"I think it loads off a lot of stress
during the year and probably is a
better investment of time than

doing a summer internship," she
said. "Then, you can take a lighter
load during the year and focus on
recruiting. It is worth it if you think
of the stress you relieve."
Elisa Nasol '09 agreed that tak
ing summer courses freed up her
other three quarters. Nasol said that
she wanted to take physics during
the summer to fill pre-med require
ments and use her other time at
Stanford to take upper-division
Human Biology classes.
But Nasol decided that SCU was
a better option for her summer
study.
"So if I'm not going to transfer
the units, I might as well take it at
Santa Clara where it's cheaper," she
said. "It's closer to my home, and
it's almost on the same caliber as
Stanford."
In the end, Ellen Truxaw also
found motivations other than finan
cial ones for taking physics at SCU.
Truxaw said that she will get trans
fer credit equivalent to the Physics
20 series for a summer's worth of
intensive work.
"Santa Clara has a reputation of
being a really great place to learn
physics," she said. "It's supposed to
be a little bit more laid back, and the
professor is supposed to be really
good. It's a class of about 90 percent
Stanford students for half the price."

2 a.m. because of her job as a High
School Summer College mentor.
Her physics lecture doesn't start
until 8:30, but the trip to class is
more difficult than a bike ride to the
Quad. Ellen has to make the mini
mum half-hour commute from
Stanford to Santa Clara University
(SCU). Her first thought when she
wakes up, even before she begins
frantically studying for quizzes: cof
fee.
"I have to have caffeine or I'm
going to pass out," she said.
For $230 a unit, non-enrolled stu
dents like Ellen can take summer
classes at SCU. with a 15-unit
course load totaling $3,450. A com
parable number of units at Stanford
adds up to $10,998. The $7,548 Ellen
saves in tuition by commuting to
SCU was the prime reason for her
summer school switch.
"My main motivation was finan
cial, but 1 had also heard a lot of
good things about Santa Clara," she
said. "My parents really didn't want
to pay for anything. There was no
way I could pay for physics here. 1
could pay mostly for Santa Clara,
and my parents are paying the $500
difference."
Though 1,021 Stanford under
graduates take advantage of the
100-plus Stanford classes in 30
departments available over the sum
mer, the price of summer tuition
sends many students scattering to
other schools. And due to the high
price of enrollment, summer cours
es at Stanford are next-to-impossi
ble for students who typically
receive financial aid.
The Financial Aid Office (FAO)
offers limited funding for matricu
lated students. Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper reported that
approximately 30 students were
offered summer loans, while 20
were offered scholarship funds.
Students who traditionally receive
scholarships from Stanford are not
necessarily eligible — only students
facing special circumstances, such as
needing an extra quarter to gradu
ate. received grants.
Cooper admitted that students
on financial aid are at a disadvan
tage when it comes to taking sum
mer courses at Stanford because of
the price of admission. Though she
was sympathetic, she said that she
championed other alternatives to
studying at Stanford.
"I do know many financial aid

students take one class at home for
a less expensive option and seem to
manage that without significant
impact," she said. "They're able to
work and earn some money."
Cooper said that she does not
foresee a change of plans in the
FAO's philosophy towards stu
dents' financial aid because the
FAO expects students to use that
time for work and research.
"For students enrolled we do
have a summer earnings expecta
tion," she said. "We expect them to
earn at least $2,100. We're not
encouraging students to attend
Stanford in the summer because we
want them to earn money."
Nonetheless, Director of
Summer Programs Patricia Brandt
lamented Stanford's loss of financial
aid recipients in its summer courses.
"1 don't really see any reason
why [financial aid] shouldn't be
available during the summer," she
said. "It's difficult to take anything
outside your major. It's very nice if
you can come during the summer
and take some electives."
Despite the economic constraints
on both students receiving financial
aid and students whose parents are
not willing to shell out almost
$11,000 in summer tuition, hundreds
of families are willing to make the
sacrifice. Along with 1,021 under
graduates, nearly 400 high school
students take summer classes, most
of whom participate in the residen

tial High School Summer College
Program.
According to Brandt, high school
students are slightly more fortunate
than their undergraduate counter
parts when it comes to summer
finances.
"They get small grants, moderate
scholarships," she said. "Nobody
gets a full scholarship. For them, it's
to show that they can do the work
and to help with their college admis
sions."
Brandt said that 2(X)7 also serves
as the pilot year for the Stanford
Summer International Honors
Program, which brings 10 students
from universities in Mexico to
Stanford for the summer and pro
vides them with special program
ming.
Additionally, 193 undergradu
ates from other schools make the
journey to Stanford for the summer.
For many of these students and
their families, summer at Stanford
was worth the high price tag.
David Anderson, a two-time
summer student and a-rising junior
at UC-Irvine, said that his parents
were willing to foot the housing bill
and tuition because he loved
Stanford so much.
"The first time I came here, 1 did
it because 1 initially wanted to go to
Stanford, and 1 knew about their
engineering program," he said.
"The second time 1 came back
because it was just such a good

experience the first time. 1 was
going to take a class again by the
same professor and I met a bunch of
great people."
University of Wisconsin-
Madison rising sophomore Kaitlin
Murphy came to Stanford for the
summer because of the University's
strong biology program. Though
Murphy initially chose a state school
over Stanford because of the cheap
er tuition, she said a summer at
Stanford was worth the money.
"1 wanted to come here original
ly, but the University of Wisconsin
has in-state tuition so it made much
more sense," she said. "But the
tuition is costing me the same
amount to be here as it is for the
entire year at home. My parents
agreed they would pay for it. I have
to pay them back."
Stanford undergraduate Emily
Hsi '09 also noted that taking sum
mer courses elsewhere or doing an
internship instead of staying at
Stanford are options that have their
own opportunity cost for Stanford
students. She said that she appreci
ates the greater challenge of
Stanford courses, along with the
dorm atmosphere on campus.
Hsi added that staying at
Stanford to take classes reduces the
academic stress students face during
the regular school year.
"I think it loads off a lot of stress
during the year and probably is a
better investment of time than

doing a summer internship," she
said. "Then, you can take a lighter
load during the year and focus on
recruiting. It is worth it if you think
of the stress you relieve."
Elisa Nasol '09 agreed that tak
ing summer courses freed up her
other three quarters. Nasol said that
she wanted to take physics during
the summer to fill pre-med require
ments and use her other time at
Stanford to take upper-division
Human Biology classes.
But Nasol decided that SCU was
a better option for her summer
study.
"So if I'm not going to transfer
the units, I might as well take it at
Santa Clara where it's cheaper," she
said. "It's closer to my home, and
it's almost on the same caliber as
Stanford."
In the end, Ellen Truxaw also
found motivations other than finan
cial ones for taking physics at SCU.
Truxaw said that she will get trans
fer credit equivalent to the Physics
20 series for a summer's worth of
intensive work.
"Santa Clara has a reputation of
being a really great place to learn
physics," she said. "It's supposed to
be a little bit more laid back, and the
professor is supposed to be really
good. It's a class of about 90 percent
Stanford students for half the price."
