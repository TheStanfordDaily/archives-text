## McCain makes second Farm visit GOP candidate gets mixed reviews 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Before a large room of Silicon
Valley venture capitalists and IT
executives fiddling with Ã¼biqui
tous Blackberries, presidential
candidate and Senator John
McCain (R-AZ) delivered the
keynote address at the AlwaysOn
Stanford Summit yesterday after
noon.
Hundreds of guests gathered
at the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
hear a brief speech by the 70-
year-old Senator, who then sat
down for 30 minutes of dialogue
with AlwaysOn CEO Tony
Perkins and Hoover Institution
Fellow Peter Robinson MBA *90
before taking questions from the
audience.
McCain championed green
technology, repeatedly called for
a smaller government and iterat
ed his hawkish stance on foreign
policy.
The Senator's talk was framed
as a "fireside chat,"and took
place on the second day of the
two-and-a-half day gathering of
technology executives.
AlwaysOn, a technology media
firm, demonstrated its innovation
by letting audience members text
live comments that were dis
played on large monitors in the
room.
McCain departed from a con

servativc routine as he appealed
to the Bay Area audience by
emphasizing the need to address
climate change in his opening
speech. He again struck a liberal
Kennedyian chord by urging
Silicon Valley's "best and the
brightest" to participate in
Washington decision-making.
And yet McCain, whose cam
paign is fast floundering, failed to
convincingly win over the sub
dued hall. His attempts to joke
about French President Nicolas
Sarkozy's unlikely support of the
U.S. fell upon mostly unrespon
sive ears, and there was scarce
applause beyond the appropriate
ly courteous.
Enthusiastic applause finally
arrived when McCain vowed that
if his hid for the presidency suc
ceeded, he would immediately
close the heavily-criticized mili
tary prison at Guantanamo Bay
and ensure that torture conduct
ed by American soldiers is wholly
eliminated.
McCain also briefly touched
on immigration, acknowledging
defeat in his attempt to push an
immigration bill earlier this year
that was supported by President
George W. Bush.
"We failed to convince the
American people that we're seri
ous about securing the borders,"
he said. "I still believe we need a
temporary work program."
