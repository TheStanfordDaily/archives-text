## McCain makes second Farm visit GOP candidate gets mixed reviews 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Before a large room of Silicon
Valley venture capitalists and IT
executives fiddling with übiqui
tous Blackberries, presidential
candidate and Senator John
McCain (R-AZ) delivered the
keynote address at the AlwaysOn
Stanford Summit yesterday after
noon.
Hundreds of guests gathered
at the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
hear a brief speech by the 70-
year-old Senator, who then sat
down for 30 minutes of dialogue
with AlwaysOn CEO Tony
Perkins and Hoover Institution
Fellow Peter Robinson MBA *90
before taking questions from the
audience.
McCain championed green
technology, repeatedly called for
a smaller government and iterat
ed his hawkish stance on foreign
policy.
The Senator's talk was framed
as a "fireside chat,"and took
place on the second day of the
two-and-a-half day gathering of
technology executives.
AlwaysOn, a technology media
firm, demonstrated its innovation
by letting audience members text
live comments that were dis
played on large monitors in the
room.
McCain departed from a con

servativc routine as he appealed
to the Bay Area audience by
emphasizing the need to address
climate change in his opening
speech. He again struck a liberal
Kennedyian chord by urging
Silicon Valley's "best and the
brightest" to participate in
Washington decision-making.
And yet McCain, whose cam
paign is fast floundering, failed to
convincingly win over the sub
dued hall. His attempts to joke
about French President Nicolas
Sarkozy's unlikely support of the
U.S. fell upon mostly unrespon
sive ears, and there was scarce
applause beyond the appropriate
ly courteous.
Enthusiastic applause finally
arrived when McCain vowed that
if his hid for the presidency suc
ceeded, he would immediately
close the heavily-criticized mili
tary prison at Guantanamo Bay
and ensure that torture conduct
ed by American soldiers is wholly
eliminated.
McCain also briefly touched
on immigration, acknowledging
defeat in his attempt to push an
immigration bill earlier this year
that was supported by President
George W. Bush.
"We failed to convince the
American people that we're seri
ous about securing the borders,"
he said. "I still believe we need a
temporary work program."

comment, and it was displayed on the monitors:
"Secure the borders? How, with a fence? Silly."
McCain slammed swelling government appropri
ations for frivolous projects, such as the six federal
programs designed for displaced workers, or the $3
million devoted to studying the DNA of bears in
Montana. He also pushed for tax cuts that would
accompany smaller government and a return to fis
cal conservatism.
"Republicans over the last six years presided over
the greatest increase in government spending since
the Great Society," he said. "That's not conservative
values."
When the dialogue shifted towards foreign poli
cy, McCain did not budge from his expected hard
line.
Robinson raised the issue of confronting China, a
country that has enjoyed double-digit economic
growth for the past decade and a meteoric rise in
international status, asking McCain to "tell me how
I should feel about this."
"There's a certain nervousness that comes with
the re-ordering of the world's superpowers,"
McCain replied. "They do stupid things; they do
dumb things."
Offering an example of unwise action, McCain
cited the Chinese military exercise last year in which
a missile destroyed one of China's own space satel
lites, sparking diplomatic tensions worldwide. The
destroyed satellite, McCain reminded the audience,
was orbiting at the same altitude as many American
satellites.
But he assured that Americans had the technical
expertise and strength of character to prevail.
"We will always dominate, we will always stay
ahead," he said.
McCain maintained his support of the "surge" of
American troops in Iraq, and painted a picture of
American bravery and perseverance in the midst of
130-degree Iraqi summer heat.

McCain, who has consistently garnered praised
for his straight talk, made no attempts to mirror
Bush's justification for the war on grounds of freeing
an oppressed Iraqi people. Instead, he bluntly stat
ed: "We are there for American interests first."
The Senator depicted a precarious strategic situ
ation of the Middle East. McCain said that with the
strong presence of Islamic extremism that could spill
over into a destabilized Iraq, the country is of vital
strategic importance to America. He also ques
tioned the wisdom of the current administration's
recent $20 billion sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.
When Robinson portrayed McCain as a morally
steadfast figure who has staunchly kept some unpop
ular positions at the cost of lagging in pre-election
polls, the Senator offered a sound bite: "1 would
rather lose a campaign than lose a war."
After audience members sat through the conver
sation between Robinson and McCain, they began
more aggressively questioning the presidential can
didate than did the apparently sympathetic Hoover
fellow.
One journalist asked McCain to speak "beyond
platitudes" on the U.S. trade deficit with China, and
McCain dismissed the concern as an non-issue and
instead emphasized the need to keep a hard line
towards irrational Chinese leaders who censor the
Internet and do not keep promises of democratic
autonomy to Hong Kong.
Another audience member persistently told the
Senator that the Chinese, motivated by emotional
nationalism, would have no choice but to attack
Taiwan if the island declared independence, and
asked how the Senator would prevent a war.
McCain said that such a scenario was inconceivable,
but promised to maintain America's protecting atti
tude toward the nation considered a rogue state by
Beijing.
As he left the summit with bodyguards, McCain
entertained one question from The Daily regarding
the status of his struggling campaign finances.
"It's fine, it's fine," he answered as he quickly
entered a black Chevrolet Suburban. "Thank you
for asking."
