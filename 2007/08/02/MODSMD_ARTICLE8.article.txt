## Natural Philosophy A 						soldier for a different cause

He stands without moving
behind the shop window.
One of his hands lies open,
making a decisive chopping ges
ture. The other sits curled around a
stick that long ago rotted away. His
hair is tied in a bun, and he wears
armor that has long since gone out
of fashion.
To his left and to his right there
are shelves. And upon each shell
has been placed, of all things, a cell
phone. It is as it the outstretched
hand were only a minute ago hold
ing the phone, hut set it down
before I happened to pass.
This is the mighty terracotta
warrior. The proud symbol of the
power of the Chinese nation, his
regality is astonishing. One look is
enough to inspire awe in even the
casual observer. And placed along
side him, the cell phone: a compa
rably powerful representation of a
Western invention.
This shop window is China in
miniature: a culture with a long and
distinguished history, standing
awkwardly alongside a newfangled
Western toy.
1 read about a court case just
now in Beijing. A man who goes by
the name of Shan is suing the
McDonald's Beijing branch, for
printing their receipts in English.
He claims that this interferes with
his ability to know what he has just
purchased. How much is he suing
for? I Renminbi. This is the equiv
alent of roughly 13 cents.
The case is meant to be a sym
bolic gesture. By forcing
McDonald's to print their receipts
in Chinese, Shan wins a victory for
Chinese nationalism. He means to
ride on the coattails of a previous
ruling that forced Starbucks out of
the Forbidden City.
But again, we see the terracotta
warrior selling cell phones. The
most European feature of this case
is not that the receipts are printed
in English, hut that the case exists
at all. In solving his dispute through
the method of litigation, Shan has
betrayed a particularly Western
side — he has become a part of the
Culture of the Law Suit.
I see a version of this uneasy and
unsure relationship with the West as
I walk down the street here in
Xi'An. I am in the part of Xi'An
that foreigners don't visit. On the
other side of the city from the terra
cotta warriors, there is nothing real
ly famous for Westerners to gawk at.
1 live in a tenement apartment.
Outside my window, my neighbors
play Ma Jiang at all hours of the day
and night, listening to Beijing opera
music. And I stick out like a sore
thumb, with my blond hair and blue

eyes.
Yesterday, on niv way to work, I
was stopped by not one, not two,
but three Chinese police officers.
Grabbing my shoulder, one of them
rather violently spun me around
and proceeded to tell me in a very
matter-of-fact voice that foreigners,
and more specifically, white peo
ple, aren't allowed in this area. "Is
this guy serious?" I remember
thinking.
It kind of makes sense —my
workplace is a school that is part of
a medical hospital for the People's
Liberation Army. They naturally
assume that any foreign-looking
person is a spy, gathering secrets
for the American government. But
why white people? If I were the
American government, and I were
genuinely interested in spying on
China, I would definitely use a
Chinese-looking spy.
The police officers stopped me
for a full 45 minutes, berating me
with questions and demanding to
see my Chinese II) card (which, of
course, I did not have). Eventually,
they sent me back to my house, to
find my boss and prove that I was
actually an employee of the school.
I was a full two hours late to the
class I was teaching and I had been
unnecessarily humiliated. The rule
at military centers, as I found out
later, is that foreigners are allowed
to enter, but cannot spend the night
in the establishment. I was not
breaking any rules.
I see the anger of these police
men as an expression of anger at
the West itself. To these three men,
I was a walking and talking embod
iment of Western capitalism and
imperialism. To these men. I was a
staunch supporter of American
trade policies, a Wall Street banker
and a militant ethnocentrist to
boot.
In a more painful way, I see this
same anger every time a child cries
at me. This is a uniquely Chinese
phenomenon. In America, most
children very much like me, finding
in my slapstickery a common bond.
But so far, in China, three children
have bawled upon seeing my face.
One of them was prompted by his
mother: "Look at our foreign
brother. Look how different he is,
how long his nose is!" Everv time,

the child stops crying as soon as the
mother shields it from my view.
Now, I'm not the prettiest boy
you'll ever see, hut I'm fairly cer
tain the children aren't crying
because I'm ugly.
As angry as my presence might
make the populace, China is
already undeniably Western in
many ways. The word "Western"
has become meaningless, as mod

cm China works to syncretically
blend the old and the new, in a cul
turally distinctive way. But the
blend isn't complete, and awkward
ness has ensued. It seems as if even
China doesn't know what Chinese
culture means anymore.
I hope you accept my musings,
realizing they are from my personal
point of view. I am not an expert,
and I don't think I ever will be. But
I am writing what I have seen. And
I have seen a terracotta warrior
who looks like he's holding a cell
phone.
