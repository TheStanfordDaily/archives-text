## Cancerous news 
### 
Why don't whales get can
cer? Alter all, cancer
develops when a single cell
builds up one too many genetic
errors and goes haywire — dividing
uncontrollably, hijacking its host's
nutrients and crowding out organs
and tissues. Big animals like whales
have lots of cells and long lifespans.
That means lots of chances for one
of those whale cells to turn malig
nant. Why aren't whales gigantic,
flippered tumor-balls?
Biologists at Arizona State
University might have found the
answer. It seems whales could fight
tumors with tumors. Within a single

tumor, natural selection should
favor the most aggressive cells —
ones that grow and divide and slurp
up nutrients faster than their neigh
bors. These aggressive cells could
create a "hypertumor" that stran
gles the parent tumor by cutting off
its nutrient supply.

The Arizona State biologists
designed a computer simulation
that started with a single run-of-the
mill tumor. Realistic mutant strains
were programmed in to interact
with the tumor, and the simulation
was run for animals of all different
sizes. Hypertumors showed up in
most of the simulations, but large
animals like whales had the greatest
number.
Tumors upon tumors! Where
will it end? The researchers know
that what plays out in a computer
screen might not show up in real


Martin
life. It remains to be seen whether
hypertumors are actually cropping
up on living whales. The whole
thing is so tantalizingly strange that
I'm hoping the bizarre tumors do
exist.
Speaking of tumorous animals,
Tasmanian devils in Australia have
a real problem. Tasmanian devils
are terrier-sized animals that look
like a cross between an otter and a
sun bear, but don't let their cuteness
fool you. As crazed as their Looney
Tunes namesake, the real animals
are ferocious fighters with the
strongest bite of any living mammal.
But the animals are facing a
threat even more ferocious than
they are: a bizarre and disfiguring
facial cancer. The cancer is actually
contagious, and uniquely so. Most
"infectious cancers" are caused by
viruses. (Cervical cancer is caused
by the human papillomavirus, for
example.) But the Tasmanian devils
don't have a virus. They are actual
ly getting sick by swapping cells.
One devil gets cancer cells from
another through fighting and biting,

sharing a food source or aggressive
mating. (Ouch.) The cancer causes
grotesque tumors that crowd out
eyeballs and teeth, eventually leav
ing the diseased animal unable to
open its mouth to eat.
The good news for the devils this
week came in the form of
Australia's new synchrotron, a $220
million particle accelerator that
opened last week. In addition to
smashing up electrons, the synchro
tron could be used to biochemically
compare the hairs of healthy and
sick Tasmanian devils. If there's a
consistent difference between the
two groups, the test could help
quarantine devils before they even
show symptoms.
There's news for human cancer
patients this week too. Two stories
hit the presses about the human
papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV is a
sexually transmitted virus that caus
es cervical cancer, the fifth deadliest
cancer in women. Scientists made
history last year with the release of
the Gardasil vaccine, a three-injec
tion sequence that protects against
the two strains of HPV most likely
to cause cance r .
The vaccine is great news for
everyone, and the news got even
better this week when University of
North Carolina scientists

announced that the strains causing
cervical cancer are largely consis
tent across continents. In other
words, getting the Gardasil vaccine
in Asia is just as good as getting it in
North America.
As a further incentive to get the
vaccine, it turns out you don't even
have to have sex to catch HPV. This
week, a University of Washington
epidemiologist found traces of HPV
under the fingernails of young men.
If individuals are walking around
with the virus on their hands, that's
an additional route of infection that
could explain the presence of the
virus in infants and young girls who
have never been sexually active.
Religious conservatives don't
want girls vaccinated against HPV
because they think it would pave
the way for all manner of licentious
behavior. (As if the only thing keep
ing adults from 24/7 orgies is a par
alyzing fear of cervical cancer.)
Hopefully this new discovery will
explode any moral opposition to the
vaccine. I end with a public service
announcement: Women, I implore
you, protect yourself from a deadly
cancer. Get your HPV vaccine
today!
