Why don't whales get can
cer? Alter all, cancer
develops when a single cell
builds up one too many genetic
errors and goes haywire — dividing
uncontrollably, hijacking its host's
nutrients and crowding out organs
and tissues. Big animals like whales
have lots of cells and long lifespans.
That means lots of chances for one
of those whale cells to turn malig
nant. Why aren't whales gigantic,
flippered tumor-balls?
Biologists at Arizona State
University might have found the
answer. It seems whales could fight
tumors with tumors. Within a single

tumor, natural selection should
favor the most aggressive cells —
ones that grow and divide and slurp
up nutrients faster than their neigh
bors. These aggressive cells could
create a "hypertumor" that stran
gles the parent tumor by cutting off
its nutrient supply.

The Arizona State biologists
designed a computer simulation
that started with a single run-of-the
mill tumor. Realistic mutant strains
were programmed in to interact
with the tumor, and the simulation
was run for animals of all different
sizes. Hypertumors showed up in
most of the simulations, but large
animals like whales had the greatest
number.
Tumors upon tumors! Where
will it end? The researchers know
that what plays out in a computer
screen might not show up in real
