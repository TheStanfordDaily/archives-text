## Piano tuners and other questions 
### 
There are many deep ideas in
Physics â€” from explaining the
birth of the universe to
answering questions about dripping
taps. In a complex and often baffling
world, my chosen field of study is
illuminating and readily provides
the illusion of understanding in a
variety of situations.
(Illusion is. of course, the impor
tant word here, since we're invari
ably just making everything up in a
desperate attempt to show off, keep
getting paid and impress the girls.
Well, that impressing girls thing is
mostly wishful thinking, but one dav

...)
Deep ideas arc sadly often quite
complex; simple things are rarely
simple; and, in fact, when trying to
explain the world, one is usually
quickly mired in a swamp of num
bers and equations, which is gener
ally very unpleasant.

Now, there is an interesting sot of
problems where none of this is true.
They are rarely deep (though they
can point one in the right direction
for depth), and are often whimsical.
What's more, neither problem nor
solution is ever particularly
involved. Such problems come cour
tesy of Italian-American physicist
Enrico Fermi: Fermi Problems.
Without going into tedious
details (since I really don't want to
write about physics, I get enough of
that at my day job) Fermi problems
