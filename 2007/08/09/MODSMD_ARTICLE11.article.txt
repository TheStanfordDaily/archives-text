## Piano tuners and other questions 
### 
There are many deep ideas in
Physics â€” from explaining the
birth of the universe to
answering questions about dripping
taps. In a complex and often baffling
world, my chosen field of study is
illuminating and readily provides
the illusion of understanding in a
variety of situations.
(Illusion is. of course, the impor
tant word here, since we're invari
ably just making everything up in a
desperate attempt to show off, keep
getting paid and impress the girls.
Well, that impressing girls thing is
mostly wishful thinking, but one dav

...)
Deep ideas arc sadly often quite
complex; simple things are rarely
simple; and, in fact, when trying to
explain the world, one is usually
quickly mired in a swamp of num
bers and equations, which is gener
ally very unpleasant.

Now, there is an interesting sot of
problems where none of this is true.
They are rarely deep (though they
can point one in the right direction
for depth), and are often whimsical.
What's more, neither problem nor
solution is ever particularly
involved. Such problems come cour
tesy of Italian-American physicist
Enrico Fermi: Fermi Problems.
Without going into tedious
details (since I really don't want to
write about physics, I get enough of
that at my day job) Fermi problems


Sivanandam
are all about estimation. They
involve a sort of refined approach to
coming up with ballpark figures or
figuring out quick-and-dirty equa
tions. The whole process relies on
making good assumptions (or, at
least, convincing ones), along with
careful disassembling of seemingly
intractable questions.
The canonical Fermi problem is
the one referenced in the title:
"How Many Piano Tuners Are
There in Chicago?" (Apparently,
according to Wikipedia, the appro
priate answer is 125.) This, obvious
ly (and thankfully), has nothing to
do with physics. But that's why
Fermi problems are fun: Once you
get the idea, you can answer all sorts
of things.
(Incidentally, if any of you have
ever sat through an interview for a
consulting job, you may well have
seen this sort of thing before. In a
clear demonstration of innovation
and foresight on the part of the
occasional corporate recruiter, ask
ing prospective employees about
light bulbs in Bolivia, golf balls in
America or batteries in Sweden is
considered probing.)
So what's the point of all this? And
why have I just written 400 words
about golf balls? Well, with a little
imagination (along with a few drinks
and another couple of tipsy physi
cists), one can apply this whole Fermi
analysis to more interesting problems
concerning, say, the Stanford gradu
ate student population.
For example, one could ask how
many graduate students are getting
action on any given night. Hmmm,
8,000 students, say 25 percent in
relationships with locals (or each

other), each of those getting it on
twice a week gives 4,(XK) per week or
570 per day. Let's call through in a
few one-night stands and call it 6(H)
... Actually this seems a little high,
but 1 figure it's in the ballpark.
What else? How about drinking?
How many pints are drunk each
night by Stanford grads? (Evidently
the appropriate answer here, given
the utter dearth of fun, is not
enough, but let's work it out any
way.) 1 figure 20 percent of the stu
dents have a drink on any given
night. Maybe half of those are beers.
Average of two beers per drinker
gives a total of 3,2(K) pints per night.
Seems a bit high. But 1 live in hope
that this much booze is being drunk.
This whole column was inspired
by an inebriated conversation with
some friends on Saturday night. At
some point the conversation turned
to orgies (as it's prone to do) and we
tried to calculate the number of
orgies that take place per week.
Figuring an orgy as three or more
people, ignoring the graduate stu
dent population (obviously) and
assuming that we only really need to
consider Friday and Saturday
evenings gives a good starting place.
Unfortunately, it gets a bit tricky
from here. But after reading
through this piece you should have
figured out the idea by now, so
maybe you can finish off this one by
yourselves.
Finally, how about fun? How
many grad students are having fun
at any moment? Fifteen waking
hours, 8,000 students, 98 percent
who hate everything about their
lives, and two percent who are
crazy. Which leaves no one having a
good time. Sounds about right.

your own Fermi problems, email
