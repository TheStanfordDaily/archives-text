# Holt's Harangue
## Kids say the darndest things (about me) 
### 
ve been working as a sum
mer camp counselor for the
last four summers. This is
what 1 imagine the kids at my
camp say about me, their humble
counselor:
"Isn't it completely funny how
Chris always, 'Say something if
you're not here,' during roll call?
That joke never gets old."
"1 know. It's so totally funny. Just
like that time he dressed up as a
pirate to get us excited for capture
the flag."
"When I grow up, I want to be just
like him."
"Oh my god, Chris hasn't shaved
in four days. That's so cool."
"Yeah, he looks like a hotter ver
sion of Heath Ledger, Ewan
MacGregor and Jake Gyllenhall,
only totally straight."
"When I turn 18. I'm going to
marry him."
"Not fair! I called it first!"
"Let's go to bed early before
lights out time."
"Yeah. I heard that when you
leave your light on past lights out, he
throws rubber snakes at your win
dow."
"I heard they were live."
"Let us never disobey him."
"Chris is so old. He's like 23."
"That's old. I hope when I'm his
age I'm married and am already a
millionaire."

"Chris keeps trying to ruin the
ending for Harry Potter."
"I don't care what his co-coun
selors say, he's not being a jerk; he
believes we deserve to read better
books."
"I guess he's right; Dobby killing
everyone would have been a way
cooler ending."
"Chris says the work of obscure
ska bands from New Jersey is better
than my favorite band."
"I have no idea why I ever
thought otherwise."
"Teach us more, oh wise one!"
"That plaid hat is so cool."
"Don't you think it's funny how
he rolls his eyes whenever the other
counselors talk about safety?"
"Oh yeah, totally. It's like he
doesn't care about our well-being!"
"I could totally see him writing for
Saturday Night Live someday."
"Yummy."
"Wasn't it funny how Chris
pretended the brakes of the van
were out and we were all going to
die?"
"Yeah, you know. I was crying
hysterically at the time, but he's a
funny guv."
"And talented."
"Sure the other counselors smile
more, but that makes his respect
more special."

"He is the best Risk player 1 have
ever seen."
"Oh look, Chris is listening to his
iPod while he's supposed to be on
lifeguard duty."
"I'm sure it's because he respects
and trusts us enough to know that we
can take care of ourselves."
"I bet his book is much more
interesting than observing our mun
dane lives."
"Has anyone seen Chris? I'm
bleeding from the head."
"You should probably go to the
hospital."
"It seems Chris has shut his door.
Let's not bother him. He's probably
sleeping."
"He works really hard to take care
of us."
"I'm sure my head will stop bleed
ing eventually."
"Let us quietly play games and go
to bed without him having to yell at
us in a half-assed manner."
"One day, let us found a nation in
his honor."
