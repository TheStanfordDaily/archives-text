# Duke process of the law
## 
### 
The debate continues at Stanford
about how much of a split should
he allowed between the college
athlete p<x)l and the student body at
large. Duke University is just wrapping
up a live-lire study of such an issue with
the now-infamous Duke lacrosse rape
case, and the results show there is a
small but significant portion of the stu
dent body and faculty whose hatred ol
"athletic privilege" is impervious to
fact, truth and justice.
As the travesty that was the Duke
lacrosse rape case winds down, the
average person can barely be expected
to understand the myriad details of the
year-long ordeal that inflamed the ten
sions in Durham, N.C. and almost sent
three innocent men to prison.
It's a complex case and a difficult
timeline to follow, if only because it
boggles the mind to think that one per
son with a handful of conspirators
could be so nefarious in so many differ
ent ways. Having followed it from the
start, let me try to shed some light on
the case.
Following a March 2(X)6 Duke
lacrosse team party at which she was
hired to perform, a black stripper false
ly claimed she was raped. Embroiled in
an election for his job, the county dis
trict attorney brazenly violated his pro
fession's ethics, law enforcement pro
cedures and the law itself to indict three
white men for sexual assault, rape and
kidnapping.
Witiiin a month the sham of the
arse was exposed, but the DA kept at
it. And with increasing desperation, he
and a small gang of accomplices tried to
railroad three innocent people into 30-
year prison terms, all the while playing
up the racial angle of the case to his
own political benefit.
On the side, a rainbow of critics and
commentators declared the accused
guilty on the basis of their race, gender
and social status, disregarding the
growing hill of exculpatory evidence.
This posse included a portion of the
Duke faculty and went as high as a
journalist for The New York Times.
In April 2(X)7, the state attorney
general declared the case a hoax and
dropped the charges, stating that
"these three individuals are innocent

from his post, and still faces contempt

That's the short version. Make no mistake:
every step of the way, there was even less rea
son to believe that the stripper, Crystal
Mangum, had been violated, let alone that the
indicted men had committed the crime. Alter
what she described as a brutal gang rape,
Mangum showed up at the hospital with only
minor trauma to the legs. I ler statements on
the incident varied wildly, varying in number of
assailants (from two to five) and the manner in
which she had been violated. I ler statements
contradicted that of her co-worker and every
one interviewed at the party.
Meanwhile, behind in an electoral race for
his job. District Attorney Mike Nifong pulled
out all the stops to energize Duke's black com
munity. giving do/ens of interviews and claim
ing he was sure a rape had occurred. Showing
the disrespect for due process that was to mark
the entire case, Nifong sneered that hiring
counsel was proof of guilt, and railed against a
code of silence from the players. This was a flat
out lie — in fact, team members had volun
teered to give statements, DNA and poly
graphs.
The first person Mangum identified with
** 100 percent certainty" as lx.-ing at the party
was a player who was miles away in Raleigh the
entire time. I ler identification (in a procedural
ly Hawed, pick-anyone lineup) of three other
men produced the indictments.
But one of them. Reade Seligmann, left the
party before the alleged attack occurred — an
alibi proved by a cab driver, an AI M camera,
cell phone records and a dorm key-card mani
fest. Prior to the indictments, Seligmann's
attorney requested a meeting with Nifong to
present this evidence. The DA refused to
meet, however, and the family instead released
the evidence to the world. Nifong, nonetheless,
won his primary shortly after and was later re
elected.
After staling that DNA testing would rule
out innocent players, Nifong changed his tune
in April when no match was found between
forensics and the players, save for one player
who, along with two percent of all males,
couldn't be ruled out (a far cry from a match).
At this point, most reasoned observers con
cluded that the case was of null merit.
This didn't stop the pattern of harassment
that had emerged since the case began, espe
cially from Duke itself. A gang of potbanging
students (apparently with better things to do
than get educated) and other protestors sur
rounded the house where the party had been
held, with signs saying "castrate" and "Sunday
morning, time to confess." A group of N8 pro
fessors took out an ad condemning a campus
"social disaster," a thinly-disguised attack on a
group of their own students.
Duke English Prof. Houston Baker issued a
hysterical, racist and unsubstantiated letter
demanding the dismissal of every player on the
team and the abolishment of the lacrosse pro
gram. The campus priest told a parent he
wouldn't minister to the team until they "con
fessed their sins."
This lynch mob was not quelled by Duke
president Richard Brodhead, who stated
"whatever they did was bad enough" and sug
gested the case go to trial so the players would
have the opportunity to "prove their inno
cence."
Openly staling "it's not about the truth,"the
Duke athletic director demanded the lacrosse
coach's resignation before indictments were
even obtained. Duke was sued and later settled.
The harassment continued at the classroom
level, where a professor with an open anti-ath
lete bias failed two lacrosse players. (One
whose graduation was almost blocked by the
failing grade received a settlement.)
Few at Duke were willing to stand up
against the tide, and the voices of reason didn't
come from the media. Indeed, some members

of the media seemed content to slough off their
guilt by rejoicing in the players' suffering. These
normally liberal commentators became reborn
Puritans, screaming that these men deserved
their Kafka-esque experience for having a
tasteless spring break party.
List I checked, it's not against the law to pay
someone to take her clothes off. And not to
minimize the problem of criminal underage
drinking, but it hardly stands to reason that hav
ing a few beers should get someone falsely
accused of rape.
Among critics, much was made of the play
ers' middle-upper class roots, variously imply
ing that they lived a life without consequences,
could buy off the justice system or shouldn't
receive sympathy due to the comfort of their
everyday lives. Too many media figures simply
wanted them to be guilty, if only to satisfy their
stereotypes of wealthy white jocks as over-priv
ileged hooligans or to make the case into a
racial allegory.
One of these figures was New York Times
reporter Duff Wilson, whose laughably pro-
Nifong coverage lapsed into all-out mendacity
at times and earned him the nickname "witness
for the prosecution" from Slate columnist
Stuart Taylor.
No less a man than media satirist Jon
Stewart took these fools to task, saying "those
three Duke kids who spent the last year pre
sumed guilty of assaulting a black woman
because the issue had huge symbolic resonance
with the media? Tunis out they didn't do any
thing."
In December, another bomb dropped and
the case collapsed. The defense discovered that
in addition to not having lacrosse player DNA
on her, the accuser carried the DNA of four
other men — and Nifong and the DNA lab
director had conspired to suppress DNA
details helpful to the defense. Nifong was
removed from the case at that point, and the
attorney general put the case on a path toward
proper resolution.
The case would not have seen the light of
truth without its own gang of heroes. Among
them were local reporters and bloggers dedi
cated to the simple principles of fact, logic and
measured analysis. To name just one, lid
Bradley, the CBS reporter who died before the
charges were dismissed, had the courage to
openly question the case on national television
after long-form interviews with the accused
highlighted the holes for all to see.
Nifong's absurdity is, paradoxically, the sil
ver lining. Without his preposterous pursuit of
the case as it collapsed around him. the world
might see these charges as a he said-she said,
not-enough-cvidence incident that was
squelched by slick lawyers.
In criminal justice, the tie goes to the
accused. Instead, by continuing to go forward,
Nifong disgraced himself and opened the door
to the players' exoneration.
Thanks to a minister of injustice, justice pre
vailed.
Voices at Duke and elsewhere pounced on
the case to stump for a repeal of scholarship
athletics. However, the destructive firestorm
that ensued showed that it was a vocal minority
of faculty members and administrative
enablers, rather than an athletic team, that was
out of control. The case certainly puts some of
the more shrill voices opposing big-time sports
in a different light.

entire time. I ler identification (in a procedural
ly Hawed, pick-anyone lineup) of three other
men produced the indictments.
But one of them. Reade Seligmann, left the
party before the alleged attack occurred — an
alibi proved by a cab driver, an AI M camera,
cell phone records and a dorm key-card mani
fest. Prior to the indictments, Seligmann's
attorney requested a meeting with Nifong to
present this evidence. The DA refused to
meet, however, and the family instead released
the evidence to the world. Nifong, nonetheless,
won his primary shortly after and was later re
elected.
After staling that DNA testing would rule
out innocent players, Nifong changed his tune
in April when no match was found between
forensics and the players, save for one player
who, along with two percent of all males,
couldn't be ruled out (a far cry from a match).
At this point, most reasoned observers con
cluded that the case was of null merit.
This didn't stop the pattern of harassment
that had emerged since the case began, espe
cially from Duke itself. A gang of potbanging
students (apparently with better things to do
than get educated) and other protestors sur
rounded the house where the party had been
held, with signs saying "castrate" and "Sunday
morning, time to confess." A group of N8 pro
fessors took out an ad condemning a campus
"social disaster," a thinly-disguised attack on a
group of their own students.
Duke English Prof. Houston Baker issued a
hysterical, racist and unsubstantiated letter
demanding the dismissal of every player on the
team and the abolishment of the lacrosse pro
gram. The campus priest told a parent he
wouldn't minister to the team until they "con
fessed their sins."
This lynch mob was not quelled by Duke
president Richard Brodhead, who stated
"whatever they did was bad enough" and sug
gested the case go to trial so the players would
have the opportunity to "prove their inno
cence."
Openly staling "it's not about the truth,"the
Duke athletic director demanded the lacrosse
coach's resignation before indictments were
even obtained. Duke was sued and later settled.
The harassment continued at the classroom
level, where a professor with an open anti-ath
lete bias failed two lacrosse players. (One
whose graduation was almost blocked by the
failing grade received a settlement.)
Few at Duke were willing to stand up
against the tide, and the voices of reason didn't
come from the media. Indeed, some members

of the media seemed content to slough off their
guilt by rejoicing in the players' suffering. These
normally liberal commentators became reborn
Puritans, screaming that these men deserved
their Kafka-esque experience for having a
tasteless spring break party.
List I checked, it's not against the law to pay
someone to take her clothes off. And not to
minimize the problem of criminal underage
drinking, but it hardly stands to reason that hav
ing a few beers should get someone falsely
accused of rape.
Among critics, much was made of the play
ers' middle-upper class roots, variously imply
ing that they lived a life without consequences,
could buy off the justice system or shouldn't
receive sympathy due to the comfort of their
everyday lives. Too many media figures simply
wanted them to be guilty, if only to satisfy their
stereotypes of wealthy white jocks as over-priv
ileged hooligans or to make the case into a
racial allegory.
One of these figures was New York Times
reporter Duff Wilson, whose laughably pro-
Nifong coverage lapsed into all-out mendacity
at times and earned him the nickname "witness
for the prosecution" from Slate columnist
Stuart Taylor.
No less a man than media satirist Jon
Stewart took these fools to task, saying "those
three Duke kids who spent the last year pre
sumed guilty of assaulting a black woman
because the issue had huge symbolic resonance
with the media? Tunis out they didn't do any
thing."
In December, another bomb dropped and
the case collapsed. The defense discovered that
in addition to not having lacrosse player DNA
on her, the accuser carried the DNA of four
other men — and Nifong and the DNA lab
director had conspired to suppress DNA
details helpful to the defense. Nifong was
removed from the case at that point, and the
attorney general put the case on a path toward
proper resolution.
The case would not have seen the light of
truth without its own gang of heroes. Among
them were local reporters and bloggers dedi
cated to the simple principles of fact, logic and
measured analysis. To name just one, lid
Bradley, the CBS reporter who died before the
charges were dismissed, had the courage to
openly question the case on national television
after long-form interviews with the accused
highlighted the holes for all to see.
Nifong's absurdity is, paradoxically, the sil
ver lining. Without his preposterous pursuit of
the case as it collapsed around him. the world
might see these charges as a he said-she said,
not-enough-cvidence incident that was
squelched by slick lawyers.
In criminal justice, the tie goes to the
accused. Instead, by continuing to go forward,
Nifong disgraced himself and opened the door
to the players' exoneration.
Thanks to a minister of injustice, justice pre
vailed.
Voices at Duke and elsewhere pounced on
the case to stump for a repeal of scholarship
athletics. However, the destructive firestorm
that ensued showed that it was a vocal minority
of faculty members and administrative
enablers, rather than an athletic team, that was
out of control. The case certainly puts some of
the more shrill voices opposing big-time sports
in a different light.

The debate continues at Stanford
about how much of a split should
he allowed between the college
athlete p<x)l and the student body at
large. Duke University is just wrapping
up a live-lire study of such an issue with
the now-infamous Duke lacrosse rape
case, and the results show there is a
small but significant portion of the stu
dent body and faculty whose hatred ol
"athletic privilege" is impervious to
fact, truth and justice.
As the travesty that was the Duke
lacrosse rape case winds down, the
average person can barely be expected
to understand the myriad details of the
year-long ordeal that inflamed the ten
sions in Durham, N.C. and almost sent
three innocent men to prison.
It's a complex case and a difficult
timeline to follow, if only because it
boggles the mind to think that one per
son with a handful of conspirators
could be so nefarious in so many differ
ent ways. Having followed it from the
start, let me try to shed some light on
the case.
Following a March 2(X)6 Duke
lacrosse team party at which she was
hired to perform, a black stripper false
ly claimed she was raped. Embroiled in
an election for his job, the county dis
trict attorney brazenly violated his pro
fession's ethics, law enforcement pro
cedures and the law itself to indict three
white men for sexual assault, rape and
kidnapping.
Witiiin a month the sham of the
arse was exposed, but the DA kept at
it. And with increasing desperation, he
and a small gang of accomplices tried to
railroad three innocent people into 30-
year prison terms, all the while playing
up the racial angle of the case to his
own political benefit.
On the side, a rainbow of critics and
commentators declared the accused
guilty on the basis of their race, gender
and social status, disregarding the
growing hill of exculpatory evidence.
This posse included a portion of the
Duke faculty and went as high as a
journalist for The New York Times.
In April 2(X)7, the state attorney
general declared the case a hoax and
dropped the charges, stating that
"these three individuals are innocent
Hie DA was disbarred in June, lifted
from his post, and still faces contempt
charges that could put him in jail. T he
players' families reached a sizable set-

tlement with Duke University.
That's the short version. Make no mistake:
every step of the way, there was even less rea
son to believe that the stripper, Crystal
Mangum, had been violated, let alone that the
indicted men had committed the crime. Alter
what she described as a brutal gang rape,
Mangum showed up at the hospital with only
minor trauma to the legs. I ler statements on
the incident varied wildly, varying in number of
assailants (from two to five) and the manner in
which she had been violated. I ler statements
contradicted that of her co-worker and every
one interviewed at the party.
Meanwhile, behind in an electoral race for
his job. District Attorney Mike Nifong pulled
out all the stops to energize Duke's black com
munity. giving do/ens of interviews and claim
ing he was sure a rape had occurred. Showing
the disrespect for due process that was to mark
the entire case, Nifong sneered that hiring
counsel was proof of guilt, and railed against a
code of silence from the players. This was a flat
out lie — in fact, team members had volun
teered to give statements, DNA and poly
graphs.
The first person Mangum identified with
** 100 percent certainty" as lx.-ing at the party
was a player who was miles away in Raleigh the
entire time. I ler identification (in a procedural
ly Hawed, pick-anyone lineup) of three other
men produced the indictments.
