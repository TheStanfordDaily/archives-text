# Duke process of the law
## 
### 
The debate continues at Stanford
about how much of a split should
he allowed between the college
athlete p<x)l and the student body at
large. Duke University is just wrapping
up a live-lire study of such an issue with
the now-infamous Duke lacrosse rape
case, and the results show there is a
small but significant portion of the stu
dent body and faculty whose hatred ol
"athletic privilege" is impervious to
fact, truth and justice.
As the travesty that was the Duke
lacrosse rape case winds down, the
average person can barely be expected
to understand the myriad details of the
year-long ordeal that inflamed the ten
sions in Durham, N.C. and almost sent
three innocent men to prison.
It's a complex case and a difficult
timeline to follow, if only because it
boggles the mind to think that one per
son with a handful of conspirators
could be so nefarious in so many differ
ent ways. Having followed it from the
start, let me try to shed some light on
the case.
Following a March 2(X)6 Duke
lacrosse team party at which she was
hired to perform, a black stripper false

an election for his job, the county dis
trict attorney brazenly violated his pro
fession's ethics, law enforcement pro
cedures and the law itself to indict three
white men for sexual assault, rape and
kidnapping.
Witiiin a month the sham of the
arse was exposed, but the DA kept at
it. And with increasing desperation, he
and a small gang of accomplices tried to
railroad three innocent people into 30-
year prison terms, all the while playing
up the racial angle of the case to his
own political benefit.
On the side, a rainbow of critics and
commentators declared the accused
guilty on the basis of their race, gender
and social status, disregarding the
growing hill of exculpatory evidence.
This posse included a portion of the
Duke faculty and went as high as a
journalist for The New York Times.
In April 2(X)7, the state attorney
general declared the case a hoax and
dropped the charges, stating that
"these three individuals are innocent
Hie DA was disbarred in June, lifted
from his post, and still faces contempt
charges that could put him in jail. T he
players' families reached a sizable set-
