starting in 15 games for the
Cardinal and ranking fourth on the
team in scoring (four goals and two
assists). At the same time she was
receiving international accolades,

International Women's Player of
the Year.
The next month of training for
Riley includes a match against the
top-ranked U.S. team, the reigning
Olympic champion. The Women's
World Cup begins Sept. 10, with
New Zealand's first match against
Brazil.
