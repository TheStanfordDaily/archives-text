## Bridge team takes home second place at nationals 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Bridge Team took
home a second place finish at the
2007 North American Collegiate
Bridge Championships in Nashville
last month, falling to champion
UCLA in a nail-biting final match.
Despite their under-the-radar sta
tus on campus, the Stanford Bridge
Team has been a dominating force in
the collegiate bridge scene in recent
years. In four of the last five years,
the group has placed among the
nation's top three bridge teams.
The squad's four-person squad
includes Belinda Gu '07, a graduate
student in computer science; Eric
Mayefsky '06, a graduate student in
Economics; Jonathan Pines '07; and
Elena Grewal, a research assistant in
the School of Education. The team
earned the right to compete in the
Nashville tournament in February
after winning all five of their qualify
ing matches in the regional competi
tion — earning the highest score of
the four national finalists.
Mayefsky, the club's president,
attributed the team's successful
record to its history of having talent
ed players.
"For a number of years, Stanford
was lucky to have a critical mass of
sorts of very good players," he said.
"This allowed a number of us who
came to Stanford as intermediate
players to have people to learn from
and improve our skills relatively
quickly."
In preparation for the tourna
ment, the squad continued to hold
weekly practices every Tuesday
night at Tresidder Union well into
the summer months. Additionally,
team members practiced online and
attended a few bridge club games in
Palo Alto.
From the start, the team knew
that UCLA would be the toughest
competition — a prediction that rang
true in Nashville.
"Our main competition was defi
nitely UCLA," Gu said. "Four teams
qualified for the finals in Nashville:

Princeton, Queens, UCLA and us.
On Saturday, we played a round
robin, where the top two teams went
to the finals and the bottom two
teams played for third. We tied with
UCLA for first in the round robin,
and played them in the finals. It was
a close match, but in the end we
lost."
Despite their loss to UCLA, how
ever, Gu said the team thoroughly
enjoyed its time in Nashville.
"The championships were amaz
ing" she said. "It was just so fun to
get a free trip to Nashville for a
weekend and play bridge for three
days straight. It was also really nice
to get to know the people from the
other college teams and meet other
young people who share my passion
for bridge."
Stanford Bridge Team members
emphasize that, though they have
been successful in the competitive
arena, bridge at heart remains a pas
sion and social activity.
"I've been playing bridge ever
since I was 11, since my family is real
ly into card games," Gu said.
"However, 1 didn't start playing
competitively until 1 got to Stanford.
There are just so many friendly
'junior' bridge players here — like
Eric Mayefsky — and they intro
duced me to the world of
Tournament Bridge."
Grewal agreed, emphasizing the
camaraderie among the team's mem
bers.
"It's been wonderful." she said. "I
have learned so much from the more
experienced players, and everyone is
really nice and friendly. We have a
lot of fun."
To introduce more students to
bridge, Mayefsky will be teaching a
student initiated course this fall, and
the team plans to hold weekly "sanc
tioned" games on campus starting in
January. The games will be recog
nized bv the national league and
counted in the national ranking sys
tem.
