## SLAC receives two-year contract renewal 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) granted Stanford a two-year
extension of its $316 million contract
to manage the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), just in
time for the Sept. 30 deadline.
In November 2006, the DOE
announced that it would open bid
ding for SLAC's management con
tract for the first time in 44 years.
The decision stemmed from a 2003
decision to open such lab contracts
to interested competition.
" The SLAC contract was unilat

erally extended by the Department
of Energy for two years," said Vice
President of the Office of the
General Counsel Debra Zumwalt in
an email to The Daily. "This is a fair
ly common practice and will give
more time for the DOE to issue a
Request for Proposal."
