## AT THE MOVIES Rush out of the theater. Now. 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION ELITE 
Monday night's advanced screen
ing of "Rush Hour 3" was a popular
event. In fact, it was so popular lhat
the theater needed to call in the
police to calm down angry filmgoers
who were barred from entering the
oversold auditorium. A film critic
sitting beside me questioned the
film's apparent appeal, "Can you
believe how much people love this
stuff?" Another critic responded
with a mixture of frustration and
resignation,"I honestly don't under
stand it."
Appalled by the smug elitism
around me, 1 was determined to
enjoy "Rush Hour 3." 1 figured it
wouldn't be too difficult. The first
two "Rush 1 lour" were enjoyable, if
uninspired, action-comedies and
marketing for the third installment
implied very little had changed.
And indeed very little has
changed. The plot is threadbare,
Tucker's high-picthcd blabbering
dominates the proceedings and kung
lu battles transpire at regular inter
vals. Nevertheless, much to my cha
grin, I find myself siding with the
haughty critics this time around.
Despite Jackie Chan's effortless
appeal, lazy screen-writing and a
stale feeling pervade "Rush 1 four 3"
from beginning to end. It's not the
summer's most disappointing sequel
(that honor goes to "Spider-man 3"),
but it might be the most pedestrian.
This third installment sees
Inspector Lee (Chan) and Detective
Carter (Chris Tucker) travel to Paris
to battle a wing of the Chinese triad.
As with other "Rush Hour" movies,
there is very little sophistication to

the movie's situations and interac
tions. In fact, the film's structure can
be summarized as follows: Lee and
Carter visit a location, engage in a
verbal and/or physical sparring
match and then move on to the next
location. Alter SO minutes, the
movie's "surprise" villain is
revealed. Ten minutes later, the vil
lain is dispatched.
I can forgive the rather stream
lined plots. But one thing I've never
understood about the "Rush Hour"
movies is how little they exploit
Chan's physical abilities. There are
numerous light scenes in "Rush
Hour 3," but they are short-lived
and not nearly as innovative as simi
lar light scenes in Chan's Hong
Kong movies. There's certainly
no'hing on display here to rival the
stunt work in "Drunken Master II"
or the "Project A" movies.
"Shanghai Knights," arguably
Chan's best American movie, is the
only film in recent years to capitalize
on the aging star's potential.
"Rush Hour 3" therefore lairs
better as a comedy. Tucker report
edly received $20 million for his par
ticipation in the movie, his first role
since "Rush 1 lour 2," and the stand
up comic's motor-mouthed dialogue
is central to nearly every scene. This
is a mixed blessing. Though Fucker

has undeniable charisma, only a
handlul of his lines are truly funny.
Yvan Altai is more successful play
ing a French taxi driver obsessed
with becoming a gun-toting
American. On the other hand.
Roman Polanski's small role as a
French Detective who gives Lee and
Carter rectal probes is nothing short
of embarrassing. The influential
director hasn't appeared in an
American movie since 1992. What
motivated Polanski to appear in the
movie is beyond me â€” unless he's
attempting to send America a not
so-subtle message.
The film is somewhat redeemed
bv its climax atop the Eiffel Tower.
The scene is alternately brutal,
funny, tense and ludicrous. "Rush
Hour" series director Brett Ratner
is often dismissed by film-goers as
inept, but this scene is skillfully con
structed indicating that the tilm's
weaknesses lie more in its screen
play that its direction. This is also
true of Ratner's "X-Men: Hie Last
Stand" which is well-directed but
hampered by a frustratingly limp
screenplay.
"Rush Hour 3" comes at the end
of one of the most franchise-inten
sive summers in Hollywood history.
Though it is opening in the wake of
vastlv superior action sequels like
"The Bourne Ultimatum" and "Live
Free or Die 1 lard," the action-com
edy will likely fair well at the box
office. Nevertheless, 1 suspect
enthusiasm for a fourth movie will
be limited. Of course, I could be
wrong about this. In which case look
for me in the inevitable screening
for "Rush I lour 4," shaking my head
in disbelief and wondering what
people see in these silly movies.
