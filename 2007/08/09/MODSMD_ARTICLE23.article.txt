## Fantasy films fly again with "Stardust" 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION SKYPIRATE 
I grew up in a time when fantasy
lilnis were a dime a dozen. Movies
like the whimsical "Neverending
Story" or the mind trip called
"Labyrinth" were common fare in the
19S()s. transporting audiences into
worlds where Muppets reigned
supreme and acting took a backseat
to wonder. Somewhere between
"Chronicles of Narnia" and"The
Bridge to Terabithia," fantasy films
lost their charm. With the exception
oi "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy,
the lantasy genre was as good as dead
in my book.
I hen came director Matthew
Vaughn's "Stardust."
Equal parts Terrv Gilliam and
Peter Jackson, "Stardust" marks
Vaughn's first foray into the fantasy
realm. Known for his edgv work on

'Stardust'
Dir. Matthew Vaughn

"Layer Cake," his newest film could
not be further from London's crimi
nal underworld.
Based on acclaimed writer Neil
Gaiman's ("Sandman, "Anansi
Boys") book of the same name,
"Stardust" is undeniably one of the
best films of the summer. Superlatives
aside, in the summer of a half dozen
blockbuster threequels where unorig
inality is the name of the game,
"Stardust" at the very least has an air
of freshness that these other franchis

es have seemingly lost.
As with most good fantasy stories,
the film begins in England (or a rea
sonable facsimile). "Stardust" follows
the tale of the hapless Tristan Thorne
(Charlie Cox) as he tries to win the
heart of the shallow but beautiful
Victoria (Sienna Miller) by retrieving
a shooting star (played wonderfully
by Claire Danes) that lands just
beyond a magical wall that borders
his quaint quiet village. Adventures
ensue, good triumphs over evil and
everyone lives happily ever after.
The story threatens to become
cliche if it not for its fantastical sense
of humor. The chorus of dead ghost
brothers vying for the dead king's
(Peter O'Toole) crown provide a
hilarious counterpoint to the some
times overly dramatic main storyline.
For everv moment in which the

melodrama becomes overdone, a
cleverly crafted joke comes along
to deflate it. It's a testament to the
strength of the script when you
can get lost in the story and not
worry about the corniness that's
inherent in a film about witches
and magic spells.
Which brings me to the best part
of the film. While the action, art
direction and special effects are all
top notch, the highlight of the film
is its casting. Though Charlie Cox is
passably forgettable as the protago
nist. Robert De Niro as the ruth
lessly foppish sky-pirate, Captain
Shakespeare, and Michelle Pfeiffer
as the malevolently wicked Lamia
the witch make every moment they
grace the screen an absolute joy.
Their performances alone make the
film worth watching. To cap it all
off, Ricky Gervais' ("The Office")
turn as an underhanded merchant is
so memorable that it is a shame it is
so short. The foundation of the film
is its characters, each unique and
brilliant in their own way.
"Stardust" is a wonderfully
crafted adaptation full of action
and humor that rekindles the fal
tering fantasy genre. Matthew
Vaughn and Neil Caiman have
created a beautiful, absorbing
world that is a must see for anyone
who grew up with fantasy films of
the 1980s or anyone who is simply
tired of the endless sequels this
summer. Forget the fifth "Harry
Potter;" you know what happens.
Instead, go watch "Stardust" —
you'll be pleasantly and magically
surprised.
