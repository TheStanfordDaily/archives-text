## Fantasy films fly again with "Stardust" 
### VICTOR FUSTÃ‰ INTERMISSION SKYPIRATE 
I grew up in a time when fantasy
lilnis were a dime a dozen. Movies
like the whimsical "Neverending
Story" or the mind trip called
"Labyrinth" were common fare in the
19S()s. transporting audiences into
worlds where Muppets reigned
supreme and acting took a backseat
to wonder. Somewhere between
"Chronicles of Narnia" and"The
Bridge to Terabithia," fantasy films
lost their charm. With the exception
oi "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy,
the lantasy genre was as good as dead

As with most good fantasy stories,

sonable facsimile). "Stardust" follows
the tale of the hapless Tristan Thorne
(Charlie Cox) as he tries to win the
heart of the shallow but beautiful
Victoria (Sienna Miller) by retrieving
a shooting star (played wonderfully
by Claire Danes) that lands just
beyond a magical wall that borders
his quaint quiet village. Adventures
ensue, good triumphs over evil and
everyone lives happily ever after.
The story threatens to become
cliche if it not for its fantastical sense
of humor. The chorus of dead ghost
brothers vying for the dead king's
(Peter O'Toole) crown provide a
hilarious counterpoint to the some
times overly dramatic main storyline.
For everv moment in which the
