### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION LIFE COACH 
As the summer wears on, our computer nerd pallor evolves into crispy tans, fat school year savings
dwindle down to just enough money to under-tip the server at your local pub and that once-in-a-life
time dream internship you bragged to all your friends about in June is starting to show its gulag streak.
Whether it's out of boredom or because you got fired from your real job (I swear that camper was
legal!), this might be the perfect time to pick up a summer job on the side. Here are some options that
will pad your wallet and your resume.

On the Resume: Freelance Marketing Consultant
In Actuality: Charge incoming freshman a modest
fee to inject a little cool into their Facebook profiles.
For us, Facebook is a mere social accessory, but for
those adorable oh-leveners who have yet to spend a
night in a Wilbur twin extra-long, Facebook is the
entirety of their Stanford social existence. Help them
put their best faces forward by deleting "hilarious"
quotes from their beloved AP calc teachers, adding a
few intriguing interests and putting is-my-zombie-
LOLcat-graffiti-hot-or-not applications in the trash
where they belong. And for the love of Pete, convince
them to get rid of those Myspace bathroom-mirror-and
camera-phone pictures while there's still time to avoid
social pariah-hood.
Earning Potential: $10 per profile — but if their
favorite quote is "Carpe Diem," it's going to cost extra.
On the Resume: Director of Transportation
In Actuality: Help your friends avoid DUls by moon
lighting as a professional designated driver. Since 5-
SURF is closed for the summer, horn in on their terri
tory by shuttling your wastey-faced friends from bar to
bar. Since there are only two or three actual bars in Palo
Alto, you'll pay almost nothing for gas. Bonus: Drunk
people are usually quite generous tippers, .lust be sure
they don't let their generosity overflow onto your uphol
stery.
Laming Potential: $20/ hour plus an 38% gratuity.
On the Resume: Personal Relations
In Actuality: Have you had personal relations of the
adult variety with a highly placed campus administrator
or government official? If not, are you good enough at
Photoshop to manipulate photos to imply the contrary?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you to blackmail
them. I'm just suggesting you let them know about the
evidence in your possession and negotiate a hefty mon
etary reward in exchange for your sustained silence. Oh.
I guess I am telling you to blackmail them.
Laming Potential: Infinite. This isn't the sort of thing
you want to try more than once, but if you play your
cards right it can result in a cushy job in a corrupt orga
nization. Hello, paid vacation time.

On the Resume: Sales Manager
In Actuality: Peddle the junk that's been clogging
your room since freshman year to naave tourists and
grad students. Every year when you pack your room you
vow to simplify, so whv not do it and make a few bucks
in the process. Set up a card table filled with your old
Ashlee Simpson posters and stolen dining hall coffee
mugs and pawn everything off on the highest bidder. If
you can wail until NSO. you can make a bundle con
vincing future Branner-ites that only a Freon-leaking
mini-fridge full of warm Natty Lites (only $5 a can!) will
make them cool.
Earning Potential: $l(X)-$600
On the Resume: Screenwriter
In Actuality: Write Will Ferrell's next hit comedy.
Step 1: Choose a marginally humorous sport (hint:
ice skating, Nascar, soccer and basketball have been
done; midget-tossing has not). Step 2: Drink a han
dle of Southern Comfort. Step 3: Club yourself on
the head with the empty bottle until you pass out.
Voila! Now just wipe the drool off your computer
screen, dumb the draft down a little bit and it's sure
to be next summer's big blockbuster, .lust don't for
get to write in Rob Schneider's obligatory racist
cameo.
Earning Potential: $S<K),(MX)-SI.(KX).(HX>.


WRITER'S BUCK: Our suggestion: buy booze first
worry about writing later.


ICE COLD: Tastes like chump money


DRUNK MOBILE: How do you think I paid for my rims?
