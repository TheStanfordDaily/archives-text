### JENNIFER LIU INTERMISSION AUSTENIAN 
'Becoming Jane'
Dir. Julian Jarrold

One might be forgiven for think
ing that there's something familiar
about "Becoming Jane;" the engag
ing cager-to-please film that aims
to do for Jane Austen what a cross
dressing Gwyneth Patrow did for
Shakespeare: explain exactly how a
biographical 1 y unexceptional author
managed to produce an exceptional
body of work. As the author of six
novels treasured for biting social
commentary and finely wrought
romantic entanglements, Austen
also died at the age of 41 without
ever having wed.
In "Becoming Jane," though, it is
1795, and twenty-year-old Jane is
ripe for a love affair earth-shaking
enough to inspire a manuscript titled
"First Impressions" — which will
eventually become the novel that
the film's target demographic will
recognize as the inspiration for an
awfully similar 2005 production
called "Pride and Prejudice."
Despite its dependence on liter
ary cannibalism, "Becoming Jane" is
an affecting, if slightly formulaic,
love story in its own right. Directed
by Julian Jarrold and written by
Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams,
the film is based on passing refer
ences in Austen's correspondence

with her sister of her brief flirtation
with a young Irish lawyer named
Tom Lefroy. From there,
"Becoming Jane" draws on tried
and true variations of Austen novels
to create the necessary ingredients
for a successful period romantic
comedy.
Young Jane (Anne Hathaway,
appropriately doe-eyed and spunky
by turns) finds her prospects limited
by inheritance laws and dreams of
scratching out a living for herself
with her pen, despite others' efforts
to marry her off to the socially awk
ward nephew of the local grand
dame (Maggie Smith). But her life
— and writing, apparently — gets
much more interesting when the
dashing and unsuitable Tom Lefroy
(James McAvoy), disrupts her quiet
country existence with fast city man
ners, an intellectual new reading list
and attractive emotional baggage.
One tumultuous affair later.

crammed with Austenian plot
devices that include Money, Not
Enough of and Relatives,
Disapproving, Jane emerges from
the experience having loved and lost
— and armed with an interesting
new idea for a novel. She has, the
filmmakers would like you to
believe, Become Jane.
Unfortunately, this implication
strikes the only sour note in an oth

erwise sparkling production. Even
nuanced performances by a roundly
stellar cast don't disguise the film's
suggestion that in addition to the
plot for one of her novels, Austen's
actual skill as a writer is owed in part
to a young man who criticizes her
writing and introduces her to real lit
erature. To its credit, the press cov
erage for "Becoming Jane" makes
no claims to historical accuracy. But

it's difficult to wholly embrace a film
that shortchanges the author it tries
to celebrate — which is a shame,
because the film's laudatory inten
tions are clear enough in its obvious
and loving attention to detail. If the
heroine were only anyone other
than Jane Austen herself,
"Becoming Jane" would have been
a film any Austen adaptation could
aspire to.
