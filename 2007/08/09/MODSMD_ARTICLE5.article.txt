## Statewide bike race to kick off at Stanford in '08 700-mile race will bring Olympic athletes, local revenue 
### MELODY DYE 
Stanford may already be overflowing with bicy
cles, but more cyclists are on their way.
Representatives from the University and the city of
Palo Alto announced last month that they will co
host the "prologue" of the 2(X)8 Amgen Tour of
California bicycle race, one of the premier cycling
events in North America-.
The statewide race — a 700-mile road course that
winds through twelve host cities — is scheduled to
kick off at Palo Alto City Hall on Feb. 17.
Competitors in the local event will complete a 2.5-
mile time trial that stretches down University
Avenue to Palm Drive, circles the Oval and wraps
up at Campus Drive and Galvez Mall. The partici
pant!}' finishing times will establish their starting
positions in the opening stage of the race.
The event — pegged by some as the top road
race in the U.S. — drew a record-setting 1.6 million
live spectators this year. So far, the Tour has gener
ated over $200 million for the state in revenue. By
event organizers Af£G estimates, the 2008 Tour will
attract well over a hundred Olympic caliber athletes
from around the world and more than 18 profession
al cycling teams. This year's winner, California
native Levi Leipheimer, went on to place third over
all in the Tour de France.
Palo Alto Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto MBA '79
said she is thrilled that the event will be held locally.
The plan was proposed by Palo Alto resident Jim
Ochowicz, president of the board of directors of
USA Cycling, and Kishimoto said she "jumped at
the chance."
"Cycling is such a perfect symbol for both Palo
Alto and Stanford culture because it symbolizes
both our green economy and our commitment to
healthy living," she said, calling it a "great opportu
nity" both to forge a common partnership with
Stanford and to promote alternative means of trans
portation.
The local event will cost nearly $195,000 to cover
public works services and security. That financial
burden, shared equally by Stanford. Palo Alto and
AHG. will be shouldered largely through fundrais
ing efforts aimed at local businesses. A local orga
nizing committee, manned by Classics Prof, and
cyclist J.G. Manning, has already begun such efforts.
While organizing costs arc steep, local businesses
can expect a high rate of return on their investment,
if past host cities are any indication. Organizers esti
mate that the event will attract some 5(),O<X) specta
tors and will get two-hours of national television
coverage. They expect the airtime and influx of
tourists to be an economic windfall both for the city
and the University.
The revenue from the race will benefit charitable
causes as well. The race's head sponsor, biomedical
giant Amgen, has thus far raised over $1 million for
cancer support and awareness programs and plans
to continue its efforts through the upcoming year.
