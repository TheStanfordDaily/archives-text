## OBITUARY Noted alum passes away Stanford says farewell to former Trustee Mel Lane 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford lost one of its most influential
alums and donors on July 28, when
Melvin B. Lane '44 passed away due to
complications from Parkinson's disease at
the age of 85.
The Lane family name resonates across
campus, from the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West to
Green Library's Lane Reading Room. The
latter, featuring never-ending bookshelves
and comfortable leather chairs, honors Mel
Lane and his wife Joan for their support of
the library's reconstruction following the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Born in 1922 in Des Moines, lowa, Lane
moved to San Francisco six years later after
his father purchased Sunset magazine. He
was educated at Palo Alto High School,
then attended Pomona College before
transferring to Stanford, where he graduat
ed with a bachelor's degree in economics.
After serving in the U.S. Navy during
World War 11, Lane began working at his
father's magazine with his brother, Bill
Lane '42.
The elder Lane described his brother as
"warm," "easy to communicate with." and
"compassionate." The two had a lifetime of
shared interests, from Pomona to Stanford,

the Navy and
Sunset magazine.
"We were
both referred to
as 'peas in a pod'
by people who
knew us equally
well." Lane said.
"We had the
same goals but
different person
alities and
responsibilities."

"When we sold Sunset |to l ime Warner
in 1990), people thought we would go our
separate ways, but we took offices right
next to each other with an adjoining confer
ence room," he added. "Through our
whole life together, I always considered
Mel my best friend."
After he and his brother sold the maga
zine, Mel Lane went on to serve as a mem
ber of the University's Board of Trustees.
Most notably, he was active in the
Memorial Church rebuilding efforts after
the 1989 earthquake.
Renowned for his dedication to the
environment. Lane also served as chairman
of the California Coastal Commission — a
position to which he was appointed in 1972
by then Gov. Ronald Reagan — and the
San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission. In addition, he
played a key role in funding and supporting
environmental initiatives at Stanford.
"He was in many ways instrumental in
helping to develop current environmental

institutions, especially in California," said
Buz/ Thompson *73, director of the Woods
Institute for the Environment.
Thompson and Lane worked closely
together on environmental issues and the
advisory council for the Woods Institute,
and Thompson said that Lane demonstrat
ed a remarkable capacity for engendering
cooperation.
"He really stepped in and created envi
ronmental management agencies and con
servation agencies that were effective and
largely trusted by all sides," Thompson
said. "Mel was one of those people who
could really bring people together and
solve problems, and all this was extremely
valuable to us as we were building up the
Woods Institute."
Thompson described Lane as warm,
compassionate and giv ing.
"Mel was somebody who was extremely
generous in his advice, in his support and he
was one of the smartest minds on environ
mental issues, but Mel was also somebody
who was always quite humble," he said.
"He was a truly lovely man. One of the
nicest and most generous people I've ever
met in my life."
Lane is survived by his wife. Joan
Fletcher Lane, daughters Whitney Miller
and Julie Lane Gray, four grandchildren
and his brother. There will be a memorial
service in his honor at Memorial Church on
Sept. 11.
