With the backing of Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto MBA '79, the
Palo Alto City Council voted Monday to finance an exploratory
committee to study the design, implementation and impact of a
parking permit program along the College Terrace streets.
College Terrace is a small neighborhood that lies just south
west of Stanford campus, adjacent to Escondido Village. The
neighborhood, which has free parking along its residential
streets, has become increasingly congested with parked cars,

that a permit system would place "a value on every parking
space."
The City Council took up the issue last month after a series of
vocal complaints from Palo Alto residents and is now faced with
the central question of whether a permit system would be the
best means to alleviate the congestion.
Some College Terrace residents have objected to the expense
of the program. Others have worried that visiting friends and
family will finance the program â€” in parking tickets. Council

members have also wondered whether instituting a permit sys

Despite these reservations, the Council has voted to launch
an evaluative study of the system. The study, which should con-
