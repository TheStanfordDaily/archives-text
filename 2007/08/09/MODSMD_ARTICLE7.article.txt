## City Council reviews parking permits 
### MELODY DYE 
With the backing of Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto MBA '79, the
Palo Alto City Council voted Monday to finance an exploratory
committee to study the design, implementation and impact of a
parking permit program along the College Terrace streets.
College Terrace is a small neighborhood that lies just south
west of Stanford campus, adjacent to Escondido Village. The
neighborhood, which has free parking along its residential
streets, has become increasingly congested with parked cars,
many of them belonging to Stanford students and employees.
Residents of the neighborhood speculate that because costs
for campus permits are so high, ranging up to $S(X) a year in
some cases, many Stanford students and workers park in College
Terrace to save on parking costs.
"It's no wonder that some people choose not to park on cam
pus when they can opt for free parking," Kishimoto said, adding
that a permit system would place "a value on every parking
space."
The City Council took up the issue last month after a series of
vocal complaints from Palo Alto residents and is now faced with
the central question of whether a permit system would be the
best means to alleviate the congestion.
Some College Terrace residents have objected to the expense
of the program. Others have worried that visiting friends and
family will finance the program — in parking tickets. Council

members have also wondered whether instituting a permit sys
tem in College Terrace will simply move the problem several
blocks away, as savvy commuters choose to park in other, unreg
ulated neighborhoods.
Despite these reservations, the Council has voted to launch
an evaluative study of the system. The study, which should con-

elude within the next year, will be
financed in part by $100,000 from
Stanford's general use permit
fund. It will explore the potential
expenses of such a system, includ
ing one-time costs such as signs
and a software tracking system, as
well as recurring costs, such as
administration and enforcement.
The aim is to keep the program
cost-neutral, using revenues to off
set upkeep.
"It can be complex to actually
nail down the right design and
method of implementation,"
Kishimoto said, explaining the
importance of the study. "But it
can't be rocket science, seeing as
