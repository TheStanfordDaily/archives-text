## Natural Philosophy A 						daredevil's cuisine

ou have a little bit of
food on your face," says
A one of the students sit
ting next to me. As I swipe away the
offending blotch I wonder: Could
this be the gelatinous sheep blood or
the cow stomach? The thought
leaves my mind as 1 move to shovel
more chicken legs into my bowl of
garlic sauce and vinegar.
I have reached a new stage in my
culinary experience: The"I honestly
don't care what this is, or where it
came from" stage. And it's a good
stage to be at, especially in China.
The food here really is amazing,
mouth-watering and flavorful. But
before you can truly enjoy it, you
have to put certain reservations
aside.
First, von have to acknowledge
that you will be eating unfamiliar
animals, and unfamiliar parts of ani
mals that are already familiar. Rat,
snake, horse, camel and basically all
of the animals of the Chinese zodiac
(save for the dragon) are considered
fine dining. I saw a booth by the side
of the road yesterday that special
ized in scorpions, tarantulas and var
ious other insects, and though it
might well have been for the novel
ty, there seemed to be no shortage
of customers. In addition, bones,
claws, stomachs, intestines and even
l ull animal heads are all fair game. I
have eaten more kinds of animals
here than you can find on one of
those "the cow goes Moo" toys for
children, and I conclude, the human
goes, "Mmmmmm".
Before PBTA gets on me, how
ever, I will note that before traveling
to China, I really was mostly a vege
tarian. So much so, in fact, that for
the sake of convenience, 1 told peo
ple I didn't eat meat. In practice, this
policy had quite a few exceptions,
including chicken, well-cooked
bacon and taco meat.
I lowever, PETA, I have some
thing to share: It is impossible to be
a vegetarian, or even quasi-vegetar
ian. in China. Chinese chefs manage
to put meat in every conceivable
edible substance, preparing dishes
running the gamut from meat
stuffed bread to meat-stuffed meat.
There are indeed quite a few veg
etables. but they are prepared in the
oil of some meat and often taste like
meat themselves. I had some
almond milk yesterday, and even
that tasted like meat.
I have found myself having to
expand my meat horizons in China.
Chicken here is very different, and
actually, probably the least flavorful
of the meats. I have found lamb, and
I love it. It may be extremely cute
when alive, but it is extremely ten
der when dead. On the weird parts
of animals front, blood, in pudding
form, is both whimsical AND deli

cious.
Another fact that I have learned
to accept is that the majority of
restaurants in this country can bare
ly meet the food sanitation stan
dards of China, to say nothing of
more stringent American codes.
While I was troubled by this at first.
1 now attend to street side shops
without much of a wince. Of course,
I still show a bit of discretion, hut
for the most part I accept that food
here just isn't that clean most of the
time.
I noticed in the past week that
various restaurants around the cor
ner were undergoing construction,
all at the same time, and were all
temporarily closed for several days.
I asked one of the shop owners why
they were closing, and lie informed
me that they were undergoing
health inspections. But my response
was more frustration than concern:
The place where I used to get those
tasty meat buns was closed, and I
would have to look somewhere else!
I was mostly kidding, but there
are many questionable yet tastv
food options in China. If there is one
lesson China has taught me, it is that
food can be sold out of everything
from the back of a truck to the back
of a bicycle and still taste very deli
cious.
These roadside shops can suffice
for a quick snack, but for a longer
meal, one needs to check out hot
pots and barbecues. Hot pots, or
"huo guo" are massive feasts of
Chinese delicacies, prepared do-it
voursell style in a steaming and boil
ing pot right at your table. While
often dangerous, the delectable
food is more than worth the second
degree burns you might very well
incur while trying to eat it. It is also
relatively healthy, as most Chinese
food is fried. Weird food abounds,
but your personal bowl of sauce will
cover any odd tastes you might find.
These restaurants are also great for
large numbers of people: 1 took my
class of 15 people out to dinner last
night to one of these, without any
trouble.
Barbecues, on the other hand,
are a lot less formal. You pick which
meat you want at the door, and
skewers are delivered to your table
with no questions asked. With a
price of one yuan (about 13 cents)
per skewer, you can get very lull
very fast. And. if vou can eel used to


Hillard
the view that fat on your meat is a
treat, you're in for a Chinese
Halloween!
Add to all of this that food is
very, very cheap. If you avoid costly
outlets such as the stately KFC and
the palatial Pizza Hut (seriously, I
saw one yesterday outfitted with a
full mock-art deco interior), you

won't be spending more than three
American dollars a day on good
food.
1 still have three weeks ahead of
me in China, and roughly 50 meals,
and I couldn't be more excited. With
my newfound policy toward
Chinese food, I should enjoy all 50
even more than 1 have my previous
Chinese meals. And, as bad as this
may sound, I hope to wipe much
more sheep blood from my face in
the weeks to come.
