Ladylike female mice can act like
sex-crazed males with the flip of
a genetic switch. The modified
females mount other mice (both male
and female), perform pelvic thrusts
and emit ultrasonic love songs usually
made by males. These altered female
mice are really good at acting like
males, but it turns out they're pretty
bad at acting like females. If they give
birth to pups, they do a poor job nurs
ing them and are lackadaisical about
protecting them
The gender-bending behavior was
launched by knocking out a single
gene called 'I RPC2. TRPC2 is crucial
for normal functioning of the

vomeronasal organ â€” a pheromone
sensing region of the mouse nose.
The effect is surprising because the
females' brains are unaffected, and
their sex hormone levels remain the
same. Knocking out a sensory organ
is all it takes for a mouse to complete
ly switch gender roles.

I'm sure this is all very interesting
for the mouse community, but does
the research have any applications tor
humans? Could we change human
behavior by tweaking some
pheromone receptor? It's unlikely,
since we don't have the right equip
ment. In humans, the vomeronasal
organ undergoes only partial devel
opment, and there doesn't seem to be
any connection between the brain
and the shriveled organ. So the
human vomeronasal organ probabK
doesn't hold the key to human gender
roles.
