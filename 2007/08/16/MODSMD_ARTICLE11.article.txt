## I'm not fat, just big-boned 
### 
Ladylike female mice can act like
sex-crazed males with the flip of
a genetic switch. The modified
females mount other mice (both male
and female), perform pelvic thrusts
and emit ultrasonic love songs usually
made by males. These altered female
mice are really good at acting like
males, but it turns out they're pretty
bad at acting like females. If they give
birth to pups, they do a poor job nurs
ing them and are lackadaisical about
protecting them
The gender-bending behavior was
launched by knocking out a single
gene called 'I RPC2. TRPC2 is crucial
for normal functioning of the

vomeronasal organ — a pheromone
sensing region of the mouse nose.
The effect is surprising because the
females' brains are unaffected, and
their sex hormone levels remain the
same. Knocking out a sensory organ
is all it takes for a mouse to complete
ly switch gender roles.

I'm sure this is all very interesting
for the mouse community, but does
the research have any applications tor
humans? Could we change human
behavior by tweaking some
pheromone receptor? It's unlikely,
since we don't have the right equip
ment. In humans, the vomeronasal
organ undergoes only partial devel
opment, and there doesn't seem to be
any connection between the brain
and the shriveled organ. So the
human vomeronasal organ probabK
doesn't hold the key to human gender
roles.

Still, I can't stop thinking about
these mice. The gender-bending
females were normal in all respects
except for their broken nose organs.
Even so, they performed all the
appropriate male behaviors, suggest
ing that the instructions for acting like
one of the guys were present in their
brains all along.
Now 1 move into wildly specula
tive territory. Suppose we humans
also have some sort of gender-specif
ic instructions hardwired in our
brains. If we're like mice, our brains
would contain instructions for both
genders, and the appropriate circuit
would be activated depending on
what body we were born into. If, as in
mice, a quick genetic switch was all it
took to activate the behavior patterns
of the opposite sex, could that be a
biological mechanism to explain
homosexuality? 1 doubt my idea will
stand up to peer review, but I've
heard sillier theories.
In other news: Could your bones
be making you fat? We generally
think our skeletons are kind of boring

— the inert scaffolding for our more
exciting muscles and tissue. But this
picture isn't quite true. It turns out
bone secretes a vital hormone that
helps regulate bltxxl sugar and fat
deposition.
The hormone is called osteocalcin,
and it communicates with beta cells in
the pancreas and fat cells to regulate
the body's insulin levels. Researchers
got the idea to look for metabolic
activity by the skeleton when they
discovered that a hormone produced
by fat cells was regulating bone mass.
When researchers began looking for
what bones were saying to fat, osteo
calcin showed up as the messenger.
Research in rats showed that
increasing osteocalcin activity kept
the animals from developing type 2
diabetes and becoming obese. If
humans are similar, new therapies for
diabetes could soon focus on the
skeleton.
From diabetes to drugs: University
of Florida researchers announced this
week that they are working with anti
doping authorities to come up with a
way to test athletes for doctored
DNA. "Gene doping" could be the
next big thing for unscrupulous com
petitors, as more conventional ways
of cheating become easier to detect.
For example, erythropoietin, or

EPO. is a hormone thai increases red
blood cell production and can boost
an athlete's stamina. Athletes are
banned from using EPO. and tests for
the illegal substance have ruined the
careers of several notable Tour de
France cyclists.
An athlete could get around the
drug test by simply injecting himself
with the gene for EPO, inducing his
body to churn out red blood cells just
as if he had taken the hormone itself.
And anti-doping authorities would be
none the wiser.
Testing for gene doping won't be
easy. It's not clear how scientists
could distinguish an injected copy of a
gene from its naturally occurring
twin. But the scientists should have
some time to figure it out, since the
technology for effective gene doping
hasn't quite arrived. For example,
macaque monkeys injected with the
EPO gene pumped out so many red
blood cells that they actually clogged
their blood vessels. Eventually, how
ever, the drug may be available for
humans, and anti-doping authorities
want to be ready — especially with
the 2(X)8 Olympics just around the
corner.
