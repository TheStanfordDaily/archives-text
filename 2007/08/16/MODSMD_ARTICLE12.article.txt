In principle, this is not a particu

it's because I need to fill up the
space somehow or other, but also
because, although this sort of thing

are over and people are starting now
jobs, new schools and all that.
Accordingly, demand for rooms is
high.

responded to my ads, leaving me
with a fascinating selection of folks
to pick from, most of whom were
