I've recently found myself in the
position of flatmate hunter
(actually, 1 find myself I this
position fairly often, it's almost as if
I'm difficult to live with) and, as
such, have spent the last two weeks
immersed in the vagaries and joys of
finding people to live with.
In principle, this is not a particu
larly interesting task. It involves tak
ing pictures, writing ads and reading
hundreds of emails — all of which
can he a shade tedious.
Furthermore, if doing it is dull, read
ing about it is even worse.
So why am writing about this

instead of more interesting topics
(for example, physics)? Well mostly,
it's because I need to fill up the
space somehow or other, but also
because, although this sort of thing
is boring in principle, in practice it
can be educative.
San Francisco is a popular place

to live amongst the young and
debauched (the debauchery is a fan
tasy of mine — in reality, not so
much). Moreover, such popularity
expresses itself most vigorously .it
this time of year. Summer vacations
are over and people are starting now
jobs, new schools and all that.
Accordingly, demand for rooms is
high.
Something like 200 people
responded to my ads, leaving me
with a fascinating selection of folks
to pick from, most of whom were


Sivanandam
probably serial killers, child rapists
or Marxists (yes, as horrible as it
sounds, there are in fact Marxists in
San Francisco).
Generally speaking, I am some
what of a hermit. I shelter in my
apartment, watch TV and try not to
associate with Other People. Whilst
this is a pleasant way to live, some
times I wonder what the rest of the
world is like and hunting for people
to live with is a good way to find out.
Furthermore, unlike most other
aspects of life, the folks I meet via
Craigslist all want me. They beg for
my attention and wish nothing more
than to have the light of Nav shine
upon them. Contrast this, if you will,
with what happens when folks nor
mally meet me — instead of wor
ship, I get contempt, disdain and
mockery.
And, you know, power is rare
when one is a graduate student. And
respect? Even rarer. You're at the
bottom of the academic totem pole;
even undereducated undergradu
ates rank higher, for they are still
young and curious (and, invariably,
better-looking).
I don't know about you, but I
crave respect. I long to be wor
shipped/waited on hand and
foot/lavished with attention. Of
course. I don't actually expect that

to happen anytime soon (or, in fact,
ever), so it's especially pleasant to
tint! myself in a situation where my
undeniable superiority is acknowl
edged.
There are other situations in life
where is sort of thing happens (if
you're good-looking, it's pretty
much every situation in life), hut
they infrequently touch upon the
lives of the young for they usually
require the wealth and station that
come with age. No, absent accidents
of faith, the only way to get respect
without actually having to earn it, is
to be selling something rare and
desirable.
Of course, rare and desirable
usually involves sex (never going to
happen: If you can't give it away,
getting people to pay for it is a little
tricky) or drugs (legally problemat
ic), and so opportunities do not
abound. On the one hand, now that
I think about it, I suppose a good
apartment in SF is a little like crack.
When you find it there's a desperate
burning need to have it. And you'll
battle furiously for your fix.
There's much more 1 could write
on the subject of living in the city
(and, more importantly, apartment
hunting in the city), but since I'm
basically at my word limit I have no
reason to continue. Just need a pithy
one-liner to finish on.

If you know any pithy one liners,
please append them to the end of this
column. Email navins@stanford.edu
