## WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD McLain looks, leaps ahead 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
Erica McLain has taken hundreds, maybe
even thousands of jumps in her track career, but
none as big as the one she took this past May at
the 2007 Pacific-10 Conference Championships.
On the Stanford track and the same runway
she has trained on for the past three years,
McLain leaped straight into the American record
books, triple-jumping 46 feet, 5 1/2 inches and set
ting an American collegiate record.
The soon-to-be senior is quietly becoming one
of the most successful and decorated athletes in
Stanford history. Besides being an NCAA cham
pion, l()-time Ail-American and five-time Pac-10
champion, McLain has also competed for the U.S.
national team since she was 16.
"It has been one of the most amazing and
rewarding experiences of my life," said McLain,
who added that being with Team USA has been a
change of pace from college athletics as she
remains one of the youngest members of the
team.
McUiin was just 19, for example, when she
traveled to the 2(X)5 World Track and Field
Championships in Helsinki, Finland. Age got the
better of her, she said, and she failed to live up to
her expectations. Looking back, she considers the
experience a reality check.

"I know that in the future the members of
Team USA will become my teammates and
friends, just like now at Stanford," McLain said.
"That's why, no matter what, I wouldn't trade
anything for the chance to compete international
ly."
And the future is coming fast for the 21-year
old from Piano, Texas.
Just a few months ago, McLain placed third in
the triple jump at the USA Track and Field
Championships in Indianapolis to secure herself a
spot for this month's World Championships in
Osaka, Japan. A foot injury soon after, though,
changed her plans.
Choosing to bide her time with yet another
year at Stanford ahead, McLain looked forward
to the greater competition she faces in less than a
year: the 2(X)8 Olympic Trials.
"1 have a lot of work to do," McLxiin said,
adding that she was nervous for the coming com
petition. "But based on my progress last season
and my other successes and failures, I am confi
dent I will be ready to give it my all when it counts
the most."
Having spent her collegiate career getting
ready for a chance at the Olympics, McLain is
already a favorite to qualify for the triple jump;
her past results have more than prepared her for
the 2(X)8 trials.
This past season, McLain bounced
back from failing to qualify for the
NCAA long jump championships by
winning the indoor triple jump title by
nearly a foot. She again proved her
strength in the 2007 Big Meet against
UC-Berkeley: Despite an injured and
wrapped-up leg, she mustered up
enough to win both the long jump anil
triple jump events. McLain's 10 team
points helped ensure a victory over
Cal for the women's team.
And at the 2007 NCAA Outdix>r
Championships, McLain took third in
the long jump, but suffered a crushing
defeat in the triple jump when
Hampton University's Yvette Lewis
overtook her on the final jump. It was
not McLain's best performance, but
after four straight days of competing,
she felt like there was nothing more
she could do.
"The four day competition takes a
lot out of you," she said. "I knew 1 was
tired, but I didn't have another day, so
I gave it all I had."
Though she was disappointed,
McLain still went on to earn the 10th
Ail-American honor of her collegiate
career. The jumping star attributes
her continued success to a combina
tion of factors, including her coach.
Ldrick Floreal, friends and family.
"Hrica has grown in her ability to
recognize her potential ;is an athlete,"
said Floreal, who has been with
McLain since the start of her colle
giate career. "She has realized that
there is a part of you that knows what
you can do and accomplish, and
another part that gets it done. Over
the past three years, she has recog
nized those two levels and succeeded
at both."
"Sometimes it is hard to mold a
champion, because it requires the ath
lete to buy into the system that [a
coach] is selling, as well as make a
transition from thinking that you can
be good to knowing that you are gixxl
enough to compete with the best," he
added. "Erica knows her abilities and
has made that transition."
McLain said she has learned to
trust herself as she transitions to the
international stage.
Despite missing the World
Championships this summer, McLain
has not stopped training. Always
looking to tiie future, she said she
needs to improve her jump by almost
a foot to secure a spot in the 2(X)8
Olympics.
Another successful year at
Stanford will help toward that goal,
setting McLain up nicely for a Beijing
berth.
"It would be a wonderful gradua
tion present to myself," she said.
