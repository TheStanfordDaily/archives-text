## WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD McLain looks, leaps ahead 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
Erica McLain has taken hundreds, maybe
even thousands of jumps in her track career, but
none as big as the one she took this past May at
the 2007 Pacific-10 Conference Championships.
On the Stanford track and the same runway
she has trained on for the past three years,
McLain leaped straight into the American record
books, triple-jumping 46 feet, 5 1/2 inches and set
ting an American collegiate record.
The soon-to-be senior is quietly becoming one
of the most successful and decorated athletes in
Stanford history. Besides being an NCAA cham
pion, l()-time Ail-American and five-time Pac-10
champion, McLain has also competed for the U.S.
national team since she was 16.
"It has been one of the most amazing and
rewarding experiences of my life," said McLain,
who added that being with Team USA has been a
change of pace from college athletics as she
remains one of the youngest members of the
team.
McUiin was just 19, for example, when she
traveled to the 2(X)5 World Track and Field

better of her, she said, and she failed to live up to
her expectations. Looking back, she considers the
experience a reality check.

"I know that in the future the members of
Team USA will become my teammates and
friends, just like now at Stanford," McLain said.
"That's why, no matter what, I wouldn't trade
anything for the chance to compete international
ly."
And the future is coming fast for the 21-year
old from Piano, Texas.
Just a few months ago, McLain placed third in
the triple jump at the USA Track and Field
Championships in Indianapolis to secure herself a
spot for this month's World Championships in
Osaka, Japan. A foot injury soon after, though,
changed her plans.
Choosing to bide her time with yet another
year at Stanford ahead, McLain looked forward
to the greater competition she faces in less than a
year: the 2(X)8 Olympic Trials.
"1 have a lot of work to do," McLxiin said,
adding that she was nervous for the coming com
petition. "But based on my progress last season
and my other successes and failures, I am confi
dent I will be ready to give it my all when it counts
the most."
Having spent her collegiate career getting
ready for a chance at the Olympics, McLain is
already a favorite to qualify for the triple jump;
her past results have more than prepared her for
