## Nnoli retires before season 
### 
Stanford football already has a
new coach for the 2(XT7 season, but
it will now need a new starting lull
back as well. Emeka Nnoli, the
Cardinal starter for 10 of last sea
son's games, will retire before his
fifth year due to medical amplica
tions.
Nnoli made the announcement
on Monday after receiving med
ical advice on the bone-weakening

avascular necrosis he suffers from in both hips. Hie
starling fullback told GoStanford.com that he was
hoping the condition would clear up before having "a
big season" under new head coach Jim Harbaugh,
but the best choice for him now is to "stay out and let
it heal on its own."
"It's unfortunate because I've played with these
guys for five years," Nnoli said. "1 know they're going
to do big things this year and go to a bowl game."
N'noli rushed for 49 yards on 19 carries last season.
He also caught eight balls for 62 yards after moving
into a position previously held by Nick Frank '06,
who also retired from Stanford football due to a cer
vical spine condition.
