## Card swimmers make World-wide splash 
### 
Stanford swimming was again at
the front of the pack in its third
major competition of the summer,
the 2007 World University Games.
Across the Pacific in Bangkok,
Thailand this past week, rising
senior Brooke Bishop and rising
sophomore Elaine Breeden helped
the U.S. claim a silver medal in the
4 x 100 medley relay. The duo swam
the leadoff and third legs, respec
tively, for a 4:03.96 final —just 0.85
seconds behind gold medal-winning
Japan.
The Cardinal women also gar
nered personal-best times at
Bangkok's Aquatic Stadium.
Breeden's 27.08 in the 50-m fly put
her seventh place, while Bishop's

25.40 in the 50-m freestyle placed
her in fifth. Bishop also had a per
sonal-best 1:02.11 in the 100-m
backstroke, taking fourth.
On the men's side, Stanford was
represented only by its alums.
Markus Rogan '04 captured gold in
the 200-m backstroke (1:56.66),
while Hongzhe Sun '07 took sixth in
the same event. Rogan also went on
to garner a silver medal in the 100-
m backstroke, and Shaun Phillips
'07 took sixth in both the 200-m
freestyle (1:49.01) and the 400-m
freestyle (3:53.70).
Two incoming Cardinal swim
mers also made a splash in
Bangkok: Chad La Tourette won
the 1500-m freestyle in a Games
record and personal-best 15:00.26,
while Kate Dwelley claimed bronze
in the 200-m freestyle with a per
sonal-best 1:59.35.
