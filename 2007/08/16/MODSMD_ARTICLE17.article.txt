# Enthusiasm soon known
## 
### 
We're in the middle of August,
and that can only mean one
thing.
Forget the baseball pennant race,
the scorching weather or trips to the
beach.
The real story is that college loot
ball teams around the country have
begun their training camps, and in just
a few weeks we'll he kicking off yet
another crazy season.
Wherever you go —be it
Tuscaloosa, Ala. or Pullman, Wash.
— optimism reigns supreme. Every
team shares a clean slate and visions
of bowl-game glory — even if that
team won just a single game last year
after having its worst season in school
history.
And yes, I am talking about
Stanford.
With the arrival of Jim Harbaugh
last January, a previously morbid and
deflated program got exactly what it
needed: a young and energetic coach
with an impressive track record
(Harbaugh led the University of San
Diego Toreros to back-to-back 11-1
seasons). He is a brash, unabashed
and loud kind of guy —just the coach
that Stanford Football could use after
its apathetic 2(KKi campaign.
And after all, with the dire nature
of last season, it was only fitting for
the Cardinal to hire a new coach with
the old moniker of "Captain
Comeback" from his playing days.
Within his first few weeks at
Stanford, Harbaugh promised to
bring an "enthusiasm unknown to
mankind" to the once-dead program.
And so far, he's kept to his word.
Just a few months into his tenure.
Harbaugh made national headlines
when he stated that USC head coach
Pete Carroll would be leaving the
program in the next year or two,
which Carroll vehemently denied
before issuing a tongue-in-cheek chal
lenge to Harbaugh.
"If he's going to make statements
like that, he ought to get his informa
tion right," Carroll said to the Los
Angeles media. "And if he has any
questions about it, he should call me."
Harbaugh responded not so
tongue-in-cheek, however: "We bow
to no man. We bow to no program
here at Stanford University." Those
arc words you don't hear too often
from the coach of a team that just
went 1-11.
But Harbaugh didn't stop there in
making headlines. In May, he made
comments to the San Francisco
Examiner about the storied


Jack
Salisbury
Above the Rim
University of Michigan football pro
gram. Harbaugh went to school at
Michigan and played for the
Wolverines.
"The [Michigan] athletic depart
ment has ways to get borderline guys
in and, when they're in. they steer
them to courses in sports communica
tions," he said. "They're adulated
when they're playing, but when they
net out, the people who adulated

them won't hire them."
Needless to say, both former
Michigan players and coaches were
incensed by his comments.
Like him, love him or hate him,
you simply can't ignore Jim
Harbaugh.
Some of the statements he's made
are immature, speculative and possi
bly straight-up incorrect, but they're
all refreshing compared the comatose
personality of Walt Harris —who
haunts many of my sleepless nights.
Call Harbaugh's tactics cheesy,
tacky or even lame and you're proba
bly right. But it's the best for thing for

the current state of the program.
Harbaugh understands exactly
what Stanford needs after a season
like 2(X)6: an injection of adrenaline
and — as he would put it — "enthusi
asm unknown to mankind."
Under Harbaugh, the Cardinal
has talked the talk. But it's a whole
different thing to walk the walk. In
looking at the returning roster from
last season, things might not be as bad
as they seem for a team that went l
-11 last year.
The one positive from the season
long debacle was that a boatload of
freshmen saw significant playing

time. Play-making wide receiver
Richard Sherman, hard-nosed run
ning back Toby Gerhart and the ath
letic Austin Vancy all saw more
action than freshmen usually do.
Also back are senior receivers
Mark Bradford and Evan Moore, two
incredibly talented players who have
been slowed by injuries. Throwing to
them will be fellow senior T.C.
Ostrander, who showed signs of poise
and ability after taking over for Trent
Edwards midway through last season.
And if it matters, the Cardinal put
up a gotxl fight in the Big Game,
hanging with Cal for four quarters. II

Harbaugh is able to channel a perfor
mance like that for every game this
year, things might not be so bad.
Questions still abound, however,
and the fact remains that this is near
ly the same Stanford team that went
1-11 last year. One thing is certain,
though: we'll soon find out just how
well Harbaugh can back up his talk.

You (tin try contacting Jink Salisbury at
jack24(a stanford.edu, ha! be forewarned
that lie bows to no comments.
