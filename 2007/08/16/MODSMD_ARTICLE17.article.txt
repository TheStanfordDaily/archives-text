# Enthusiasm soon known

We're in the middle of August,
and that can only mean one
thing.
Forget the baseball pennant race,
the scorching weather or trips to the
beach.
The real story is that college loot
ball teams around the country have
begun their training camps, and in just
a few weeks we'll he kicking off yet
another crazy season.
Wherever you go —be it
Tuscaloosa, Ala. or Pullman, Wash.
— optimism reigns supreme. Every
team shares a clean slate and visions
of bowl-game glory — even if that
team won just a single game last year
after having its worst season in school
history.
And yes, I am talking about
Stanford.
With the arrival of Jim Harbaugh
last January, a previously morbid and
deflated program got exactly what it
needed: a young and energetic coach
with an impressive track record
(Harbaugh led the University of San
Diego Toreros to back-to-back 11-1
seasons). He is a brash, unabashed
and loud kind of guy —just the coach
that Stanford Football could use after
its apathetic 2(KKi campaign.
And after all, with the dire nature
of last season, it was only fitting for
the Cardinal to hire a new coach with
the old moniker of "Captain
Comeback" from his playing days.
Within his first few weeks at
Stanford, Harbaugh promised to
bring an "enthusiasm unknown to
mankind" to the once-dead program.
And so far, he's kept to his word.
Just a few months into his tenure.
Harbaugh made national headlines
when he stated that USC head coach
Pete Carroll would be leaving the
program in the next year or two,
which Carroll vehemently denied
before issuing a tongue-in-cheek chal
lenge to Harbaugh.
"If he's going to make statements
like that, he ought to get his informa
tion right," Carroll said to the Los
Angeles media. "And if he has any
questions about it, he should call me."
Harbaugh responded not so
tongue-in-cheek, however: "We bow
to no man. We bow to no program
here at Stanford University." Those
arc words you don't hear too often
from the coach of a team that just
went 1-11.
But Harbaugh didn't stop there in
making headlines. In May, he made
comments to the San Francisco
Examiner about the storied
