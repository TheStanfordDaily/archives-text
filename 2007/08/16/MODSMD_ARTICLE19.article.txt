## AT THE MOVIES SUPERBAD- you will dig it 
### BRANDON SILBERSTEIN CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION DOUBLE TEAM 
Superhad may not capture the
headlines that other big budget
films will this summer, but Seth
Rogen ("Knocked Up") and Evan
Goldberg ("Da Ali G Show") cralt
one of the smartest and most honest
teen sex comedies in years.
The plot, like any good teen sex
comedy, is pretty forgettable. The
movie centers around three friends
in high school trying to finally get
laid with their respective dream
girls. Cliche, thy name is teen come
dy. Rogen does a good job of play
ing up the obvious youthful earnest
ness of the characters, particularly
with the bombastic Seth (Jonah
Hill).
Initially, you might be put off by
Hill's overly-wacky performance,
as it's not as convincing as his
cohorts. Once the movie kicks into
gear, however, you come around.
He and his best friend, Evan
("Arrested
Michael Cera) are going to two dif
ferent schools for college and are
worried their friendship will end.
Evan, for his part, is the more sym-

'Superbad'
Dir. Greg Mottola

pathetic of the two; as anyone who
lias seen the canceled Fox sitcom
will attest, he knows how to cap
ture the nervous embarrassed
teenager.
The most obvious comparison
to "Superbad" is actually not
Rogen's other hit comedy,
"Knocked Up," but teenage com
ing-of-age films like "American
Pie" and the classic John Hughes
films of the 1980s. The banter
between the characters and the
focus on enduring male friendship
(with some obvious sexual tension
played for awkward laughs) is rem
iniscent of Rogen's other work
with writer Judd Apatow.
However, the situational, awkward
and often absurd twists in the film
link it to other coming of age films.
It balances the vulgar and weird
ness of the age with heartfelt and

believable moments.
1 lonestly awkward moments
abound in the film, from Seth's
failed wooing of Jules (Emma
Stone) to Evan's painful version of
"These Eyes" played to a bunch of
cokeheads. Unlike a lot of the
gross-out moments that character
ize the genre, the awkwardness is
derived from the all-too-realistic
universality of growing up. Then
again, the entire story arc involving
the cops (Seth Rogen and Bill
Nader). Fogell (Christopher Mintz-
Plasse) and a fake ID that bares the
name "McLovin" is so absurd that it
nearly steals the show. Abusing
their police powers to the fullest,
they help drive the story forward
and teach the nerdy Fogell a little
bit about life, including how to get
down with one's bad self — nay,
one's Superbad self.
Superbad is this decade's
"American Pie," a clever buddy
comedy and coming-of-age film
with an ambiguous message about
friendship. Rogen seems to have a
talent of vaguely conveying some
sort of strong ideal without getting
sappy or melodramatic. I lie tilm is
loosely sentimental, awkward and
funny — maybe that's why it's accu
rate too.
