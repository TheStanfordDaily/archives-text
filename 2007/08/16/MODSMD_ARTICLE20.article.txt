## Top viral videos of the summer You Tube Broadcast Yourself 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION VIROLOGIST 
The only thing in entertainment more fleeting than Britney
Spears' marriages is internet fame. Remember when "Dick In
A Box" was popular? Yeah, me neither. This summer, a few
viral videos have hit the big-time through sites like Digg and
Youtube. Here are the ones you should definitely check out
before they get crowded out by the next Diet ( oke and Mentos
craze.
Video: Battle at Kruger
Search You Tube for buffalo lions crocodile awesome
Result: View the African exotic food chain in all ot its convo
luted, bloody glory. A few lucky safari-goers in Alrica shot the
haul of a lifetime (on their camcorders — lighten up. Phi A)
when a herd of buffalo attempted to stampede some lions. Lion
cubs take a baby buffalo hostage, then play tug-01-war with a
full-grown crocodile before the rest of buffalo come in to enact
sweet gory justice. And if you listen carefully in the back
ground, you can hear a Discovery Channel wildlife photogra
pher shooting himself for not getting this footage lirst.
Video: Filipino Prison Thriller Remake
Search You Tube fur: prison inmates thriller
Kesult: Who says prisoners have it easy? Somewhere
between back-breaking labor and, um. social reform, over
1500 prisoners at a correctional institute in the Phillipines
had the time to choreograph and perform a move-perlect
remake of Michael Jackson's "Thriller video. The footage
looks suspiciously like it's shot from a guard tower, but
these guys know their moves. Extra kudos go out to the fel
low who pulled his hair in a pony tail and dressed up in a

halter top to play MJ's girlfriend in the vid. What 1 really
want to know is how did someone in a prison get away with
suggesting and organizing this production without getting
beaten up?

Video: Debate '08: Obama Curl vs Giuliani Girl
Search You Tube for: obama girl giuliani girl

It's good to see the youth of America taking a personal interest
in issues that affect this country. If only they all could do it in
booty shorts ...

Result: I lot twenty-somethings using their sex appeal to
receive support from grody old men is no new thing, but
lately You Tube seems to have it backwards. This video is
one in the larger trend of hot chicks shaking their bikini-clad
bots to endorse candidates. Obama Girl and Hott4Hill were
two of the hottest videos of the summer, but this latest entry
by production company Barely Political (an understatement
if ever I've heard one) takes the cake. I earns ol ()bama and
Giuliani supporters square off in a debate that consists
mainly of statements like "gonna Barack the vote" and
gyrating in public fountains. Finally a plaltorm America can
get behind.
Video: Merrv Miller Interviews Holly Hunter
Search You Tube for: merry miller worst interview ever
Result: This train wreck of an interview will make you leel
better about not going for that degree in communications.
Novice interviewer Merry Miller completely capsizes a
cushy celebrity segment for internet soft-news show "What s
The Buzz." ABC publicly apologized for the botched bit.
blaming a technical error that made the interviewer unable
to hear Holly Hunter's answers. But does that really excuse
Miller's mispronunciations, insipid comments, squinting at
the teleprompter and misidentifying the broadcasting net
work? Money can't buy schadenfreude like this.
