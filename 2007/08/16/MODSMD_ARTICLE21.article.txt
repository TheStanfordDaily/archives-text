# OUT OF THE BUBBLE
## Destination: Bluff, Utah 
### ALLISON STEWART INTERMISSION BLUFFER 
It's about that time of the summer when work has
started to wrap up and autumn quarter has yet to
begin. Now is the perfect time for that last summer
road trip, but you can't quite decide where to go. If
you want to see a side of the American West that
northern California just doesn't offer, head down the
coast and across the Mojave Desert toward the San
Juan River in Bluff, Utah.
As an intrepid explorer, I wrangled a friend into
joining the weeklong sojourn, packed my boots and
headed for the Utah landscape. Here's a travelogue
of my foray into nature and what you might
encounter 011 your very own fantastically natural
adventure.
Day Due
As it turned out. the road between Palo Alto and
Bluff runs through one of the most stunning routes
you can drive if you are a geologist, or. well, any
body. Thus the representative student body on this
trip consisted of me. my friend and fifteen geology
majors.
Our caravan hit 101 going south through the
strawberry fields and cow pastures of the Central
Valley. The hills were nursed by a week of rain and
massive granite formations crumbled through the
topsoil. Think Lord of the Rings territory. If you
start out from campus in the morning, these gran
ite-flecked hillsides last until dusk, when you'll
head into a long pass with colonies of glistening
white wind turbines that rival in number those you
pass en route to Yosemite.
A few more minutes along the dusty desert road,
and we piled out into what I could only trust was
actually a campsite, tossed down sleeping pads and
tucked in for a cool desert night in the Mojave.
Day Two
Rustling into wakefulness, I rolled up and nearly
rolled off of a steep ledge into the desert. We'd
camped on the edge of a sharp incline, just a few
meters above the dark orange and brown hazed
expanse that stretched untouched for miles in front
of us. The Mojave spans about 22.(HH) square miles
across four states, and is littered bv tons of Joshua
trees. Their cragged branches stand amidst rough
brush and cacti, holding up torches of orange pom
pom flowers. In the summer, temperatures here reg
ularly near 1(H) degrees.
The group piled back into our vans and sped
along the last few hours, past alluring signs for the
Grand Canyon and Mesa Verde, eyes sealed 011 the
rugged scenery until we reached the Bluff town limit.

Bluff
Population: 4(H). Mormons settled the town in
IKBO as a part of the Hole in the Rock expedition.
Bluff borders the present day Navajo Nation in
southern Utah. The towering Navajo sandstone cliffs
surround the town's 4(H) residents who also happen
to drink water so pure and smooth they've nick
named it "bluff champagne."
We booked rooms at the Decker Horse Inn. The
place is a historic landmark and not too expensive. If
you get hungry, you can head to the edge of the town,
and you'll find the Twin Rocks Cafe that has some of
the best Navajo fry bread around. Streets one hun
dred feet wide (enough room to turn around a horse
carriage), two restaurants in town, absolutely no beer
for sale and crushingly beautiful — that's Bluff.
Day Three — The River
You can book group river tours with Wild Rivers
Expeditions, a little operation about a two-minute
walk from Decker Horse Inn. If you're not so inter
ested in the pursuit of class 5 rapids, don't fret
because the river is pretty calm and the guides are
fun to be around and are also really knowledgeable
about the area. Our comedic guide had festooned the
"Ice Princess," (a white-gowned doll) to the bow of
the raft to bear the brunt of the splashes.
Day Four
We camped on the side of the river opposite the
Navajo land.
The Navajo Nation covers about 27,(HK) square
miles of land, spreading across all of northeastern
Arizona, into Utah and New Mexico. There are
about 3(H).(HH) Navajo (traditionally the Dine people)
still living in the U.S. and more than half live within
this sovereign territory that is still peppered with tra
ditional hogans.
The famous Butler Wash rock art panels along the
river draw anthropologists from around the world to
study and examine the animals, humans, gods and
unexplained forms drawn into the rock thousands of
years ago just beyond the banks. You'll even find
ancestral cliff dwellings close by that your river
guides will point out as hiking destinations if you're
inclined. The whole area is overflowing with an inter
esting history that you'll want to uncover.
Day Five
After three long days 011 the river, we hauled the
rafts out at the river's end in Mexican hat, Utah. As I'd
come to expect, this town also had its own landmark
landscape: a colossal sombrero-shaped rock balances
011 a stone pinnacle hundreds of feet above the river.
No big surprise, it's Utah. I shook the red sand out of
my jeans, and we headed back to California.

Take a good long look at the beautiful scenery. According to Al Gore, it will
all be gone by the time you are twenty five. Look on the bright side — at least
the beach will be closer to home.
