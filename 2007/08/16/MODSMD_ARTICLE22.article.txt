## Reunions: the search for more money? 
### DEAN SCHAFFER INTERMISSION REUNIONITE 
Summer is a time for reunions with
friends, family and — estranged hand
members? Maybe that last one doesn't
apply to you, but it seems relevant in a time
when hands are reliving their glory days
left and right — The Police, Rage Against
the Machine and Smashing Pumpkins have
all recently retrieved their instruments
from dusty closets and hit stages across the
country. In a time of stagnation in the
record industry, many wonder just what
these reunions mean for fans and musicians
alike.
The Police: Andy Summers, guitarist in
The Police, recently said in an interview,
"It just all sounds non-creative to me. The
kind of chemistry in our band, there's no
reunion." That makes sense — a band
breaks up, gets back together and goes on a
highly publicized international tour of huge
arenas. Reunion? Never.
Despite their protestations, The Police
are essentially creating and exploiting nos
talgia. At Dodger Stadium, they opened
with "Message in a Bottle" and did exactly
what the crowd expected — belt out hit

alter hit with expert skill and precision.
Don t Stand So Close to Me" sounded as
good as ever, and the aging crowd relished
every moment of the set and its three (yup,
three) encores.
Rage Against the Machine: Rage began
their unexpected tour by headlining
Coachella. The group has since added a few
shows in the States but has said nothing
about long-term plans.
Unlike The Police, Rage are back with a
vengeance. Tom Morello is still a DJ mas
querading as a virtuoso guitarist, and Zack
de la Rocha remains one of the angriest,
most powerful vocalists in modern music.
At the Rock the Bells festival in San
Bernardino, their bone-crushingly heavy
riffs kept nearly every fist in the air from
opener "Guerilla Radio" to closer "Killing
in the Name Of."
Commanding a crowd of 60.000 isn't
easy, but Rage can do it like none other.
When delivered by de la Rocha, lines like,
"All hell can't stop us now!" and "Fuck no,/
I won't do what you tell me!" could galva
nize a revolution. Like The Police, Rage
focused on their hits, but their riveting per
formance made me think they were never
gone in the first place.

Smashing Pumpkins: Billy Corgan has also
excavated the hones of the past hy reviving
his '90s chart-topping act, Smashing
Pumpkins; "I want my hand hack," Corgan
said. But clearly, having your band back
doesn't really require band members —
only drummer Jimmy Chamberlain has
returned to Corgan's flock. The group has a
new album ("Zeitgeist') and is touring the
States and Europe.
The Pumpkins and Corgan have drawn
heavy criticism as profiteers for releasing
multiple versions of "Zeitgeist" (six, by my
count), but this chrome-domed, self-hating
superstar always keeps a few tricks up his
sleeve. The show I attended at the
Fillmore, the last of a nearly two-week res
idency, had two "sets" — one acoustic, one
electric. Billy and Co. surprised everyone

by opening with a com
pletely new tune
("Mama") that was actual
ly written just a few days
before. In fact, six of the
13 acoustic songs were
written during the tour.
And several songs in the
electric set had been com
pletely reworked since
their original studio

release (including a remarkably improved
"Shame"). The Pumpkins are my favorite
band, and to see them live and hear songs I
didn't know was jarring but exhilarating.
The Bottom Line: Reunions can shake our
faith in a band's artistic intentions, but,
when done right, they offer up a chance for
growth and new direction. The Police have
definitely lost some musical integrity —
although 1 enjoyed their performance, I
can't ignore their money-grubbing. And
Rage? Well, let's just say the world needs
more bands like Rage to keep the govern
ment and those evil multinational corpora
tions on their toes; I'll gladly welcome
Rage back any time, under any circum
stances.
And then there's the Pumpkins.
Criticize them and their new album if you
must, but they are truly pushing the enve
lope, and not in the same way as they did in
the '90s. Back then, loud guitars were
enough; now, it takes breaking away from
the surefire formulas and surprising audi
ences with what they never could have
expected ... though we all know the real
reunion was your awkward embrace with
last year's summer fling. So much for sum
mer love.
