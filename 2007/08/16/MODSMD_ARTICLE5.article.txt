## STUDENT LIFE Parking permit prices to increase 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS 
Student drivers will have to dish out extra
cash for parking permits for the 2007-2(X)8
school year. Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) announced last week. But a
price hike is not the only change in store for
those who want a car on campus. P&TS has
also begun negotiations with vendors to bring
a car-sharing program to Stanford this fall, at a
time when the students grapple with pricey
permits and restricted parking spaces from
construction projects.
Under the new pricing system, an academ
ic year "A" permit will cost $603, an increase
of $51 over last year's price. A "C" or
"Residential" permit will cost $234, an
increase of $18 from last year. Current parking
permits expire Aug. 31. and permit holders
will be required to display new stickers begin

ningSept. 1.
"Our costs are going up." said Brodie
Hamilton, director of Parking and
Transportation Services. "Virtually all of our
costs are covered by parking permit fees, so
increases in our budget are reflected in permit
prices."
1 lamilton said he does not believe that the
increased permit prices will worsen the fre
quency of fraudulent behavior in which stu
dents doctor their own permits.
"The price increase is so small, most stu
dents are going to be paying about another
$1.50 per month," he said. "I don't see that
such a small increase will encourage such dras
tic behavior."
Rather than the higher permit prices, stu
dents were more concerned with other restric
tions in the University's parking system.
"If prices are going to increase $20, I'm still

going to pay for it without much complaining,"
Barry Burns '09 said. "It's the logistics more
than the pricing. I don't want to have to deal
with a situation where I go to pick someone up
at their dorm for five minutes and risk getting
a ticket."
The residential permit system requires stu
dents to park only in designated lots on cam
pus. These permits generally restrict students
to parking in the vicinity of their current dor
mitories, making parking across campus diffi
cult.
Hamilton said that these parking restric
tions were generated by students who were
unable to park in the limited spaces near their
dormitories due to the influx of nonresidents
who were visiting friends or using facilities on

Stanford affiliates will have to dish out as much as
$51 extra dollars for a parking permit next year.
Zone-based parking will continue, limiting students
to parking lots near their residences.
the other side of campus.
Burns suggested that the
University should nevertheless make
some changes to allow students to get
across campus.
"Unless it's the weekend or after 4
p.m., there is no easy way to park
across campus," Burns said. "They
should at least have 10-minute load
ing zones outside of major residence
halls like they do at Tresidder so that
you can easily pick someone up with
out much hassle."
The increase in permit prices
comes at a time when parking is at a
premium on campus. Although con
struction of a 1,200-space parking
structure under Wilbur Field has
begun, the project has displaced 130
spaces and is not expected to be com
pleted until March 2(X)8.
Hamilton said that the University
has taken several measures to miti

gale construction-related parking
shortages, including the construction
of a 100-space lot last year between
the Wilbur and Stern residential com
plexes, as well as additional parallel
parking spots on Campus Drive. He
said the University also plans to
implement attendant-assisted park
ing in the lot behind Tresidder Union.
In light the parking crunch,
Hamilton said that P&TS is also com
mitted to developing alternative
transportation programs to reduce
the number of individuals who feel
the need to have a car on campus.
Hamilton said that the University will
bid on a car-sharing program that
would allow students, faculty and
staff to reserve a car over the Internet
on an hourly or daily basis. Clusters
of loaner cars would be distributed
around campus and be available for
about $8-9 an hour.
"These prices include everything
from gas and insurance to general
maintenance," Hamilton said.
"We're hoping we can get a long

term commitment from the vendor
and expect that it will be very success
ful."
Freshman would also have access
to the program, according to
Hamilton. He said he expected fresh
men to be key consumers of the car
sharing system because they are not
permitted to have cars on campus.
Kate Youngman '08, who has
never had a car on campus, praised
the program for offering students
greater flexibility and mobility.
"I've gotten by biking locally or
getting a ride from a friend,"
Youngman said. "Sometimes it can
be a hassle, but it's still not worth it
for me to buy a car. A lot of people
would be happy to know they have
another option."
Youngman explained that there
have been plenty of situations where
she has needed access to a car but did
not want to burden her friends. To
travel to her physical therapy
appointments, she knew she had the
option of calling a taxi, but she said

that taxis cost much more than the
proposed car-sharing program.
"It's also environmentally con
scious," Youngman said. "There is
already too much traffic and too
many parking lots. 1 would hate to
tear down more greenery to build
new ones."
Hamilton also encouraged stu
dents and staff to take advantage of
the public transportation already pro
vided by the Marguerite Shuttle
Service, as well as the Commute
Club, which provides incentives for
off-campus commuters to carpool.
"We're always looking to encour
age individuals to use alternate trans
portation in any form when they're
commuting to campus," he said.
"Whether they're sharing a ride, tak
ing a bus, riding the train or biking
around campus, every little bit helps
both from a traffic standpoint and air
quality."
