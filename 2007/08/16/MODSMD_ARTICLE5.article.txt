## STUDENT LIFE Parking permit prices to increase 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS 
Student drivers will have to dish out extra
cash for parking permits for the 2007-2(X)8
school year. Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) announced last week. But a
price hike is not the only change in store for
those who want a car on campus. P&TS has
also begun negotiations with vendors to bring
a car-sharing program to Stanford this fall, at a
time when the students grapple with pricey
permits and restricted parking spaces from
construction projects.
Under the new pricing system, an academ
ic year "A" permit will cost $603, an increase
of $51 over last year's price. A "C" or
"Residential" permit will cost $234, an
increase of $18 from last year. Current parking
permits expire Aug. 31. and permit holders
will be required to display new stickers begin

ningSept. 1.
"Our costs are going up." said Brodie
Hamilton, director of Parking and
Transportation Services. "Virtually all of our
costs are covered by parking permit fees, so
increases in our budget are reflected in permit
prices."
1 lamilton said he does not believe that the
increased permit prices will worsen the fre
quency of fraudulent behavior in which stu
dents doctor their own permits.
"The price increase is so small, most stu
dents are going to be paying about another
$1.50 per month," he said. "I don't see that
such a small increase will encourage such dras
tic behavior."
Rather than the higher permit prices, stu
dents were more concerned with other restric
tions in the University's parking system.
"If prices are going to increase $20, I'm still

going to pay for it without much complaining,"
Barry Burns '09 said. "It's the logistics more
than the pricing. I don't want to have to deal
with a situation where I go to pick someone up
at their dorm for five minutes and risk getting
a ticket."
The residential permit system requires stu
dents to park only in designated lots on cam
pus. These permits generally restrict students
to parking in the vicinity of their current dor
mitories, making parking across campus diffi
cult.
Hamilton said that these parking restric
tions were generated by students who were
unable to park in the limited spaces near their
dormitories due to the influx of nonresidents
who were visiting friends or using facilities on

Stanford affiliates will have to dish out as much as
$51 extra dollars for a parking permit next year.
Zone-based parking will continue, limiting students
to parking lots near their residences.
