# FACULTY & STAFF
## Profs. extend hand to North Korea 
### STUART BAIMEL 
Two Stanford professors and a visiting
scholar were part of a group of specialists
that visited North Korea last week, just
ahead of the upcoming six-party talks
regarding the country's nuclear program.
Former Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC)
Director John W. Lewis, a professor of
Chinese politics, was accompanied by
CISAC Co-director Siegfried Hecker and
Boh Carlin, a visiting scholar at CISAC
and former State Department diplomat for
North Korean affairs. John Merrill, a State
Department intelligence analyst, joined
the Stanford faculty on the trip.
According to a statement issued by
Hecker and Lewis on the CISAC website,
the Stanford professors discussed topics
ranging from North Korea's nuclear pro
gram to the country's health and education
policies. Special focus was given to North
Korea's Yongbyon reactor, which Heckei
declared "shut down," as well as building
relations with North Korean policy experts.
The professors both support engaged

diplomacy with North Korea to resolve the
nuclear issue and promote economic
development.
Hecker and Lewis both declined
requests for interviews, in the interest of
not impacting the six-party talks, which
begin today in Shenyang, China, and con
tinue throughout August. The talks are
part of ongoing efforts to cease North
Korea's nuclear program and end the
country's isolation by opening its doors to
economic development.
Chris Hill, the chief U.S. envoy to North
Korea, disavowed any official capacity of
the trip in a statement to The New York
Times. Lewis and Hecker will not have any
role in the upcoming negotiations and
most likely will not take part in any of the
working groups covering specific policy
areas, including the nuclear issue. Lewis,
however, works with the State Department
as an informal advisor.
This is not the first time Hecker and
Lewis have been to North Korea. Lewis
has visited the Asian state 15 times in the
past 20 years, and Hecker has traveled
there four times. Both professors also visit-

Ed the country in October 2(X)6 after North
Korea's semi-successful nuclear lest and
subsequent decision to return to the six
party talks.
When North Korea's Vice Minister
Kim Gye Gwan visited the U.S. in March,
he requested a two-day meeting with
Meeker, Lewis and several others.
According to a soon-to-be-published
CIS AC memo, Kim credits Lewis for con
vincing the U.S. to negotiate directly with
Nortli Korea.
The recent visit is part of ongoing
"Track 2" negotiations — unofficial inter
actions involving non-governmental offi
cials — between North Korea and the U.S.
Hecker, Lewis and former Secretary of
Defense and Management Science and
Engineering Prof. Bill Perry have been
active in these negotiations.
"The U.S. and DPRK [Democratic
People's Republic of Korea | are working
to normalize their relations, but it's some
what unclear what that means beyond
establishing diplomatic relations,"
Director of the Shorenstein Asia-
Pacific Research Center Gi-Wook
Shin said. "Normalizing relations
should mean more than just that —
social and cultural exchanges as well.
Track 2 negotiations can he very use
ful for deepening relations."
