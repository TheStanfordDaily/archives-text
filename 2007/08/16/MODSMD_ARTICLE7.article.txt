## SLAC faces layoffs as research evolves 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has long earned interna
tional renown for its work in particle and
astroparticle science. But as SLAC shifts
its projects toward the field of photon sci
ence. the jobs of those working in particle
physics research may hang in the balance.
Five workers at the End Station A
experimental facility — where quarks
were discovered — have faced the reper
cussions of SLAC's changing priorities.

Three technical workers, a physicist and
an engineer have been laid off.
"There have been isolated layoffs asso
ciated with a program change," said SLAC
Director of Communications Neil Calder.
"These are not budget-driven layoffs; they
are simply part of the changing research
priorities of the lab. It's a small number.
This happens consistently."
SLAC Director of Human Resources
Lee Lvon '65 added that laid off union
workers can "bump" less experienced
workers with similar jobs in other parts of
the lab. forcing another worker to find a

job outside of SLAC. The three laid off
technicians are part of the United
Stanford Workers union.
"The bargaining unit people have a
right to bump other bargaining unit peo
ple in terms of our agreement with the
union," Lyon said. "Someone who has
been hired more recently than them with
the same classification — they can take
their job. At least one has [bumped some
one else| and a second might [bump oth
ers]."
SLAC is home to 1,600 workers,
and, according to Lyon, layoffs are
common. In 2005, SLAC laid off 66
workers due to a lack of Department
of Energy funds. Lyon said that five
to 10 workers were laid off last year,
along with five to 10 thus far in 2007.
"It's just part of how the business
runs," Lyon said. "Different experi
ments don't run any longer or a pro
gram ends. We look for places for
staff but if we can't find it, they are
subject to layoff. They have what is
called rehire preference — if they're
laid off and apply for a job they have
preference over equally qualified
applicants."
Lyon said the small particle
physics experiments at End Station
A will no longer be supported bv
SLAC. The changing of End Station
A's priorities couples with SLAC's
shifting focus toward photon science
that is to take place between now
and 2009.
"Scientific projects at a big lab
like SLAC are constantly in evolu
tion," Calder said. "The End Station
A series of experiments and installa
tions are coming to a final point.
This is particle physics research. At
SLAC there is an overall change tak
ing place, there is more emphasis on
the photon science research rather
than the particle physics research for

which SLAC bccame famous."
In September 2008, SLAC will
also shut down its Baßar project, a
particle physics experiment that has
been running since 1999. Calder
called the project "the last big parti
cle physics experiment at SI.AC."
The center hopes to move in a new
direction in 2009, when it begins
operating its Linac Coherent Light
Source photon science project, the
first x-ray free electron laser.
Calder said that financial motiva
tions are partially responsible for the
shift away from particle physics. He
said that SLAC will continue to add
to the field through contribution to
international projects, such as a par
ticle accelerator in Geneva, and, he
hopes, an international linear collid
er in 2020.
"| Particle physics] costs a lot of
money," he said. "To stay at the
energy frontier where the new dis
coveries will take place demands
very large and expensive equipment.
Now particle physics experiments
are international projects."
"The realization of this
changeover and planning for it has
been over the last few years," Calder
added. "In any organization change
is always something that's difficult to
negotiate, but there's extraordinary
excitement of having this new instru
ment."
