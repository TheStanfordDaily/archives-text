## SLAC faces layoffs as research evolves 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has long earned interna
tional renown for its work in particle and
astroparticle science. But as SLAC shifts
its projects toward the field of photon sci
ence. the jobs of those working in particle
physics research may hang in the balance.
Five workers at the End Station A
experimental facility — where quarks
were discovered — have faced the reper
cussions of SLAC's changing priorities.

Three technical workers, a physicist and
an engineer have been laid off.
"There have been isolated layoffs asso
ciated with a program change," said SLAC
Director of Communications Neil Calder.
"These are not budget-driven layoffs; they
are simply part of the changing research
priorities of the lab. It's a small number.
This happens consistently."
SLAC Director of Human Resources
Lee Lvon '65 added that laid off union
workers can "bump" less experienced
workers with similar jobs in other parts of
the lab. forcing another worker to find a

job outside of SLAC. The three laid off
technicians are part of the United
Stanford Workers union.
"The bargaining unit people have a
right to bump other bargaining unit peo
ple in terms of our agreement with the
union," Lyon said. "Someone who has
been hired more recently than them with
the same classification — they can take
their job. At least one has [bumped some
one else| and a second might [bump oth
ers]."
