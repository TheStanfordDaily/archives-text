## Israel boycott sparks debate 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
The tensions stirred by the calls for Stanford's
divestment from Israel made last year by members of
Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel (SCAD and
some ASSU Senators have reemerged. A boycott of
Israeli Universities passed in May by the British
University and College Union (BUCU) has prompted
protest throughout the United States, raising the ques
tion — where does Stanford stand?
The New York Times ran a full-page advertisement
on Aug. K. sponsored by the American Jewish
Commission (AJC). with a statement by Columbia
President Lee Bollinger denouncing the British boycott
of Israeli Universities.
The Times ad included a list of almost 3(H) universi
ty presidents who endorsed Bollinger's statement,
which criticized the boycott and the BUCU for
"hold[ing| intellectual exchange hostage to the political
disagreements of the moment" and stated that "if the
British UCU is intent on pursuing its deeply misguided
policy, then it should add Columbia to its boycott list,
for we do not intend to draw distinctions between our
mission and that of the universities you are seeking to
punish."
Notable supporters of the petition included UC-
Berkeley President Robert J. Birgencau. Northwestern
President Henry S. Bienen and University of
Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann.
Noticeably absent from the list of signatories, how
ever, was Stanford President John I lennessy.
Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to the President, told
The Daily in an email that Hennessy had already
signed a similar petition opposing the boycott.
"President I lennessy joined in a much more widely
and earlier circulated petition," Wachtel said, "which
includes not just presidents, but also Nobel Prize
Winners and other distinguished academics."
The earlier petition included signatures from
Economics Prof. Emeritus Kenneth
Arrow, a Nobel Prize-winning econo
mist and other Stanford professors
and academics. The petition has over
K).(XX) signatures and was sponsored
by the Scholars for Peace in the
Middle East (SPME).
A number presidents who signed
the earlier SPME petition were also
included on Bollinger's list, including
Gutmann and MIT President Susan
Hock field.
The SPME petition stated that its
participants "will regard ourselves as
Israeli academics and decline to partic
ipate in any activity from which Israeli
academics are excluded."
Though Hennessy has made his
opposition to the BUCU's boycott
clear, the recent New York Times ad
has sparked debate on campus, with
some students arguing that Hennessy
should do more to stand up to the aca
demic boycott and others celebrating
that Hennessy, while personally
opposed to the boycott, is not making
an effort to align Stanford with ARC
petition.
"We were certainly disappointed to

see that President Hennessy did not
sign the statement supporting Israeli
universities and condemning the boy
cott." said Andrew Ehrich '()9. presi
dent of the Jewish Student
Association.
Ehrich acknowledged that "the sit
uation in the Middle East is incredibly
complex," but he said that "a fair and
final peace can only be reached if all
sides reach out to each other."
"Condemning some of the leading
educational and research institutions,"
Ehrich added, "serves only to inflame
rhetoric and distort the issue."
Other students students supported
Hennessy's decision to refrain from
signing the AJC petition.
"SCAI appreciates President
Hennessy's objectivity regarding the
American Jewish Committee's peti
tion censuring Britain's University and
College Union's consideration to boy
cott Israeli academia," Fadi Quran '10,
co-president of Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel, said in a state
ment to The Daily.
Quran acknowledged that SCAI
chose to exclude academic boycotts
from its campaign, but noted that "we
do understand the motivations behind
the |BUCU's) call to deliberate the
boycott of Israeli universities."

Quran said that it was the SCAl's
opinion that their approach, which is
"divestment from corporations that
directly violate human rights and sup
port oppression in Israel and the
Occupied Palestinian Territories [...] is
the most appropriate way towards
peace therein."
ASSU Senator Stuart Baimel '09
began circulating a petition asking
I fennessy to sign the Bollinger state
ment.
Baimel acknowledged that
Hennessy's signature on the SPME
petition was important; however, he
reiterated that he would continue
efforts petitioning Hennessy to the
AJC petition as well.
"There's a clear difference between
the two petitions," Baimel said. " The
SPME is individual — Hennessy per
sonally agrees to boycott the boycott,
so to speak."
"The Bollinger one is more power
ful," Baimel continued, "in that it com
mits the entire university to boycott
the boycott, [and] puts the whole
weight of Stanford University in oppo
sition to the BUCU's attempt to stifle
academic debate."
