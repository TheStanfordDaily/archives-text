Karaoke. If there is any better
proof that the human race is
inherent!) ridiculous. I would
like to hear it (and see it) blasted
from a 3-foot speaker system and
displayed on a projected TV screen
with background images of poppy
fields.
Before the complaints start
rolling in. 1 should say first off that I
am well aware that karaoke is a
Japanese word, and was invented in
Japan.
According to my trusty friend
Wikipedia. (which this time I had to
access through a proxy server
because of The Great Firewall of
China), karaoke was invented hy
the Japanese singer Daisuke Inoue
in the early 19705. Looking for a way
for his adoring fans to more easily
sing along to his brand of disco
fusion (trust me, it's not pretty),
Daisuke affixed a cassette tape to a
IV set. He named his invention
"karaoke," from the Japanese
words for "empty," or "void" and
the hnglish word, "orchestra". I find
the first part of this derivation to be
particularly apt.
Unfortunately, the man did not
patent his invention, and thus
missed out on the opportunity to
make billions of dollars from our
misery. Today, the fruits of his labor
have blossomed into an over $10 bil
lion-dollar-a-ycar business, with
entire buildings dedicated to
"karaoke boxes," or rooms with a
TV screen and attached micro
phones that you can rent out by the
hour.
This business is alive and well in
China. Here, it is known affection
ately as KTV, or "Ka la OK." the
first two words being characters and
the "OK" bit being from the
Western alphabet. Interestingly
enough, while "ka la" is surely a
transliteration from the Japanese,
one can only but wonder about the
inclusion of "la." whose character
can mean to pull, or in the case of
"la du/i," (duzi means stomach) to
have loose bowels.
As in Japan, these KTV parlors
have become a popular destination
for teenagers and businessmen
alike, with in-the-room activities
running the gamut from enjoying
the latest pop song to sealing a busi
ness deal. It is fairly common to go
"KTV" (yes, it is used as a verb
here) right after a large banquet. It
is also common to have a kind of
street side KTV, in the form of a
competition to see who can irritate
the judges least.
Since I have arrived in China, I
have unwittingly found myself
singing karaoke numerous times,
and thus feel prepared to offer a

walkthrough of a typical KTV expe
rience:
You enter a large building, with
more stories than you feel is appro
priate for a venue of this nature.
Well-dressed waiters and/or wait
resses take your coat, and provide
bags for any umbrellas you might
own. You take a crowded elevator
up four or five flights, and along the
way, get a preview of the singing
voices of your fellow elevator
patrons. "Not bad!" you mentally
exclaim. As you exit, you note that
the hallways smell like a sort of
sweet vanilla coffee. Where they get
this scent remains a mystery, as they
do not serve coffee at most KTV
places.
Walking down the hallways, you
will inevitably encounter the prob
lem of The Open Door â€” the floors
have been packed as tightly as possi
ble with private rooms, and occa
sionally, you will be forcibly
exposed to the singing prowess of
the other guests of this establish
ment. Needless to say, everyone in
China has a wonderful, beautiful
singing voice, so this is never a prob
lem.
You arrive in your room to find a
large leather couch, as well as a pro
jector screen, with up to five micro
phones 011 the table. Along the sides
of the room, the waiters have placed
various elements of the typical
rhythm section. An assortment of
hand tambourines, triangles and
even maracas make your personal
band complete!
There is a sudden rush to choose
songs, and your hosts are always
quick to choose American songs
that they have heard of, so you can
sing along as well. This inevitably
boils down to the Billboard top 50
hit singles from 1997, interspersed
with the Beatles, and, oddly, the
particularly unkaraoke-able Linkin
Park.
As the machine fires up. you
begin to understand the true pur
pose of the picture portion of
karaoke. This is not to inform you of
the words of the songs, but to pro
vide ridiculous and unnecessary off
topic visual accompaniment.
Singing "I wanna see you out that
door, baby bye bye bye" with the
visual supplement of a crying child
