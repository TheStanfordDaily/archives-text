## The 						foreigner identity crisis

4 4 A y|\v Humps" blares over a
l\/l loud stereo system. All
i* Aaround me, gyrating
pelvises signal that at least someone
is having a good time. The smell of
alcohol is heavy in the air, and pink
collared shirts abound. White faces
drift in and out, pushing their way
through the crowd, paired into
newly-formed couples. Bubbles fall
from the ceiling, as the IJ.I cuts off
the music and the audience finishes
the chorus of a popular Justin
Timberlake song.
No, this isn't the living room of
SAL:; this is Beijing. But at first
glance, you really couldn't tell the
difference. Welcome to the Beijing
Expatriate (or "expat" as its con
stituents lovingly call it) community
community in which I have
unwittingly found myself a member.
1 he scene is the dance club
"Mix," not to be confused with the
nearly identical club "Vies," across
the street. A throng made up of
roughly 70 percent Europeans, 10
percent Americans, and 20 percent
native Chinese people (mostly older
men ...) populates an area the size of
a small barn, dancing in a way that

would suggest precisely this location.
Every five minutes or so, the
masses are rained on from above by a
torrent of oddly malodorous fake
snow. I hey listen to American rap
music, and a screen in the back pro
jects images from a randomly gener
ated set of rap videos, which have
nothing to do with the music being
played. All around the club are bars,
in which the attendants and cus
tomers alike speak English more or
less fluently. The only sign that you
are in China is the fact that the
English isn't perfect. These bars have
odd names, such as "Moscow Army
Bar" and "Purple." Men stand out
side of them and encourage you to
enter with promises of "good time,
tasty drink and pretty girl."
Upon entering, you see a menu
tilled with lish and chips, onion rings
and even burritos (who eats burritos

in China?!), written entirely in
English. In terms of drinks, these
bars have a bit of a habit of tacking
on a few zeros to the end of regular
street prices, and getting away with it.
A can of coke can end up costing
eight American dollars, a literal 3,000
percent increase from what you
would pay on the street.
All this aside, it is almost like a
parallel universe, a theme park won
derland for Westerners. What a treat:
We expats can experience all the
wonders of a foreign country, without
ever leaving home! Several streets
away, small shops hawk the relics of
Chinese history, in even more broken
English. "Looka looka," they yell
"Handsome boy, you buy purse
cheap". Terracotta warriors and vari
ous reproductions of Chairman Mao
memorabilia plaster the walls of a
long alleyway. Though ostensibly sep
arated into stalls, almost every single
stall sells identical merchandise. And
again, almost everyone around me is
a Westerner.
Most of these people, however,
are not expats (who live in or stay in


Nat

a foreign country for an extended
period of time), hut rather belong to
another breed of foreigner: The
tourist. Taken in by what they
believe to be authentic cultural
goods, they spend their precious few
nights wandering these alleyways
and buying knock-offs at exorbitant
prices. Like the expats, most do not
speak any Chinese, relying on a cal
culator to do their talking. But the
similarity really stops there. The
tourists in these alleyways at least
show some appreciation for Chinese
culture. Most would simply like to
decorate their mantels with interest
ing overseas finds. It is another ques
tion entirely whether these tourists
are romanticizing a culture they are
barely aware of.
As I travel to various Chinese
landmarks, I notice a huge number
of fellow foreigners, wearing their
cameras around their necks and
sticking out, like me, like a sore
thumb. I can certainly identify with
this group somewhat, given my
need to see the famous sites of this
country. But they lack a certain
shame, a guilt that is made appar
ent by their being tourists in the
first place. And they simply cannot
get any greater kind of understand

ing about a country.
The feeling I get is that neither the
expat nor the tourist is going about
things the right way. On the one
hand, selfishly ignoring the culture of
another country and supplanting it
with your version of Western deca
dence is morally wrong. This is the
w< ;st incarnation of the cultural
salad bowl, in which the French crou
tons are actively poised against the
Mandarin oranges.
But on the other hand, going to a
country simply because you believe it
is "exotic" is ignoring the truth
behind the cultural experience. A
culture cannot be defined with a
series of hokey posters and faux
bronze statues. I have no idea how to
define a culture, and certainly no
idea at all how to define Chinese cul
ture, but this surely isn't the way to
go about it.
These two poles, the expat and
the tourist, are in many ways oppo
site sides of the spectrum. It seems
like the truth should lie somewhere
in the middle. I would like to believe
that the way to "get a feel" for China
is neither to go clubbing with
Europeans nor to go buying "Long
live Chairman Mao" posters.
Rather, you can only get this feel
through talking to its people, and
they are more than willing to talk.
The only thing that is left is for you
to do is listen.
