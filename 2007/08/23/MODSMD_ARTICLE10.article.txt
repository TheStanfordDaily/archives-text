## The foreigner identity crisis

4 4 A y|\v Humps" blares over a
l\/l loud stereo system. All
i* Aaround me, gyrating
pelvises signal that at least someone
is having a good time. The smell of
alcohol is heavy in the air, and pink
collared shirts abound. White faces
drift in and out, pushing their way
through the crowd, paired into
newly-formed couples. Bubbles fall
from the ceiling, as the IJ.I cuts off
the music and the audience finishes
the chorus of a popular Justin
Timberlake song.
No, this isn't the living room of
SAL:; this is Beijing. But at first
glance, you really couldn't tell the
difference. Welcome to the Beijing
Expatriate (or "expat" as its con
stituents lovingly call it) community
community in which I have
unwittingly found myself a member.
1 he scene is the dance club
"Mix," not to be confused with the
nearly identical club "Vies," across
the street. A throng made up of
roughly 70 percent Europeans, 10
percent Americans, and 20 percent
native Chinese people (mostly older
men ...) populates an area the size of
a small barn, dancing in a way that

would suggest precisely this location.
Every five minutes or so, the
masses are rained on from above by a
torrent of oddly malodorous fake
snow. I hey listen to American rap
music, and a screen in the back pro
jects images from a randomly gener
ated set of rap videos, which have
nothing to do with the music being
played. All around the club are bars,
in which the attendants and cus
tomers alike speak English more or
less fluently. The only sign that you
are in China is the fact that the
English isn't perfect. These bars have
odd names, such as "Moscow Army
Bar" and "Purple." Men stand out
side of them and encourage you to
enter with promises of "good time,
tasty drink and pretty girl."
Upon entering, you see a menu
tilled with lish and chips, onion rings
and even burritos (who eats burritos

in China?!), written entirely in
English. In terms of drinks, these
bars have a bit of a habit of tacking
on a few zeros to the end of regular
street prices, and getting away with it.
A can of coke can end up costing
eight American dollars, a literal 3,000
percent increase from what you
would pay on the street.
All this aside, it is almost like a
parallel universe, a theme park won
derland for Westerners. What a treat:
We expats can experience all the
wonders of a foreign country, without
ever leaving home! Several streets
away, small shops hawk the relics of
Chinese history, in even more broken
English. "Looka looka," they yell
"Handsome boy, you buy purse
cheap". Terracotta warriors and vari
ous reproductions of Chairman Mao
memorabilia plaster the walls of a
long alleyway. Though ostensibly sep
arated into stalls, almost every single
stall sells identical merchandise. And
again, almost everyone around me is
a Westerner.
Most of these people, however,
are not expats (who live in or stay in
