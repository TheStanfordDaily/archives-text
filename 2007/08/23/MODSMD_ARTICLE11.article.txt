# Holt's Harangue
## Your Resume, Your Radio 
### 
Stop me if you've heard this one
before. You wake up at 5 a.m.
to go to get a taxi for the air
port. As you leave your dorm, you
notice high school campers stumble
back from a night spent clubbing.
Later, you arrive at the airport and
have your only good suit scanned
several times by security people. It
seems they too cannot believe you
are wearing a suit today. You fall
asleep on the airplane while listen
ing to your iPod. You realize that
the Aerosmith song "I Don't Want
To Miss a Thing" is stuck in your
head. You consider getting back
together with your ex- girlfriend.
10 a.m: Arrive in LA. Check
voice mail. Listen to a voice message
that informs you your job interview
has been canceled. Become the only
cursing yuppie who throws in
"Damn the Man!" between epithets.
Then, you call the high-powered
production company who was sup
posed to be interviewing you. You
tell them that they have to see you
today, cause you have flown down
from Stanford just to see them. You
surprise yourself that you seem
vaguely threatening, an adjective
only used to describe you if people
don't return your Muppet DVDs.
Apparently, not many people
threaten high-powered production
companies, and they tell you if you
hurry they can fit you in. You're not
sure if you've just proven you have
big brass ones or this is a trap.
Though you wonder if production
companies bouncers all have pony
tails and goatees too, you brave the
interview.
You get a taxi and use all but six
dollars to get to a faceless building
in a neighborhood you cannot
afford. Marble floors and three sec
retaries with headsets greet you.
Headsets remind you of mission
control for NASA and then that
crappy "I Don't Want To Miss A
thing" song from that space movie is
back in your head. You imagine
Billy Bob Thornton on all of their

faces and you vomit a little in your
mouth. You decide now that breath
ing on your interviewer would be a
bad idea. You wait in the hollow,
cold marble hallway tor eternity.
You realize that you cannot live
without that ex-girlfriend.
Eventually you get your hand
shaken by a man dressed less-well
than you, and judging by his gelled
and carefully disheveled hair, he's
either here to interview you or he's
late for his Pert Plus commercial. It's
the former, and you wonder if his
suspicious gaze is due to your supe
rior dress or your lack of hair care
products. In this primitive land, your
scent reeks of outsider. Now he will
take you to his chieftain, and you
will prove your worth by beating
your proverbial chest and telling
him how much you like data entry.
His office is gray, but not cement
gray, which means someone actually
decided to paint it like this. He has
no degrees on the wall, meaning he's
a temp. He lectures you for 45 min
utes on what he docs for a job and
what you would do. You keep say
ing "ok," and "sounds good," and
even a "yup" to seem down to earth.
You realize that the interview
process basically consists of being
lectured until your attrition wears
down and the surviving candidates
are hired. In this way, it's like
FEMA. You check the wall clock
and you haven't answered a ques
tion yet. I don't want to miss a thing.
Dammit.
Finally, you're asked how you see
yourself in this company. While you
initially want to say "leading armies
into battle and crushing competitors
underneath my mighty battle axe"
you fall back on your experience in
customer service, PR work and
training sea lions to recycle orphans.
He is passive. He asks you about
your grades; you tell him.
He thanks you for your time.
Knowing that you blew the last of
your money on this interview/lec
ture where you answered two ques

tions, you figure you should at least
get your money's worth out of him.
You ask him what else your resume
could use for something like this. Ik
says it's perfect, and you know that
means you're so not getting this job.
Even if he did actually think that, his
higher ups aren't going to respect
someone whose opinion of someone
is "oh, they're perfect." You're not a
Flemish painting, you are a potential
employee. Now thoroughly
depressed, you wonder if your ex
will take you back, or your flirta
tions with L.A. will permanently
doom us. L.A. means nothing to me,
baby.
You head back to the airport
using the L.A. bus system. This is in
itself an accomplishment because
the search for LA's mass transit sys
tem is the subject of the next
Indiana Jones movie. You begin to
peel off parts of your fine yuppie
attire, revealing the obscure band t
shirt inside. You sit between a man
with a rare coughing disorder that
lets him think it's appropriate to
cough on you and a woman with two
lazy eyes. You give them names in
your head, such as "Coughy" and
"Cookie Monster." Cookie Monster
gets off after a couple stops but
Coughy will transform himself into a
mother of three and sit next to you
on the flight home, her children
clawing at the remains of your suit.
You arrive at the airport and you
call your friends, who reassure you
that you're infinitely employable,
and that this is only the beginning of
the job search. On the flight home,
you contemplate ways of killing
Aerosmith.
