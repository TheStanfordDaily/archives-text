## GOLF Frosh Kim leads Card hopes at U.S. Amateur 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After dominating the competition en route to the
NCAA title this spring, Stanford men's golf has
proven itself once again a forceful presence on the
national stage at this week's 2007 U.S. Amateur
tournament at the Lakeside and Ocean Courses at
the Olympic Club in San Francisco. The second
round of match play begins today.
Three Cardinal golfers — rising sophomore
Joseph Bramlett, rising junior Daniel Lim and
incoming freshman Sihwan Kim — entered the U.S.
Golf Association (USGA) tournament this year and
were among the 7,398 competitors looking to claim a
spot on the U.S. Walker Cup team.
The Amateur Chamfion will receive an exemp
tion into the 2008 U.S. and British Opens, a likely
invitation to compete in next year's Masters
Tournament, and a 10-year exemption into the U.S.
Amateur field, provided, of course, that he remains
an amateur.
After an initial cut narrowed the field to 312
golfers, two rounds of stroke play eliminated all but
the lowest 64 scorers. While Lim was eliminated in
the stroke play rounds (he finished 14 over par with
scores of 73 and 81), both Kim and Bramlett
advanced to the first round of match play, which con
cluded yesterday.
Bramlett lost to Chris Kirk yesterday in 19 holes,
despite being 2-up through 13 holes, and Kim is the
only remaining Cardinal hope.
Yesterday was frustrating," Bramlett said. "They
threw me out [of the tournament | early, but 1 played
relatively decent and hope I can do better through
out the upcoming year at Stanford."
No stranger to the U.S. Amateur, Bramlett qualified
for the tournament in 2002 as a 14 year-old, and the
rising sophomore remains the youngest player to
compete for the U.S. Amateur crown. K i m
finished stroke play with a score of 144 (73-71) in a
tie for 25th. In the first round of match play yester
day. Kim faced off against Norway's Marius Thorp.
The soon-to-be Cardinal golfer sprinted out to a 4-
up lead through five holes, but faded down the
stretch, only to hang on for a 1-up victory over the
Norwegian.
Like Bramlett. Kim is no stranger to USGA com
petition. He won the 2004 U.S. Junior Amateur at
the Olympic Club.defeating David Chung of
Fayetteville, N'C in the final. While former Stanford
standout Tiger Woods was the junior tournament's
youngest winner ever in 1991, Kim was a mere
22 days Woods' senior when he won the title as a 15
year-old.
Now the phenom remains the Cardinal's only
U.S. Amateur hope, and he has the lull support of
his teammates.
"It was good seeing Sihwan play wel. in the tour-

MATURE AMATEUR: Rising sophomore Joseph Bramlett fell one stroke short of advancing to

nament," Bramlett said. "It looks
like he is going to be able to really
help us out next year."
And whether or not Kim moves
past the round of 32, Bramlett said
the tournament has been a sign of
good things to come for the
Cardinal.
"Though this tournament was
more focused on the individual than
the tournaments that 1 play with
Stanford, it was nice seeing a few
Stanford guys on the field," he
said."Having three of us qualify for
this tournament and then play rela
tively well marks a good start for
this year. This tournament will help
us to build confidence and work
hard so that we can improve on last
year and have another good year of
golf on the Farm."
