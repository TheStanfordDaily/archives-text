# A 						grab bag of sports
## 
### 
Rather than taking the usual
approach this week, I
thought I'd offer up some
thing that's a little more of a grab
bag of what's up in the sports world.
Sure, it may not be straightforward,
but what is anymore?
STATE OF THE CONFERENCE
Let's start off with a bit of a State
of the Union address for the Pacific
-10 Conference. Amidst the market
ing machine that Stanford football
has become, it may be difficult to
remember that the Cardinal isn't
alone with its "Our house. Our
team. Our dream." Here's the short
skinny on all of the Pac-10 teams,
north to south:
Washington
What appeared to be a break
through 2(X)6 season went down the
tubes when the team's best player
got hurt. After two years at the helm
of a completely forlorn program.
Tyrone Willingham is on the hot
seat in the eyes of the fans. 11nsk\
Nation apparently iongs for the days
of Don James and NCAA proba
tion. Whether or not Willingham is
the man for the job. UW asked lor
these growing pains when they hired
Slick Rick Neuheisel.
Washington State
Injuries derailed the Cougars'
late-season bid for a bowl game, and
personnel losses have left this year's
team with serious holes. WSU has
the Pac-10's most experienced quar
terback in Alex Brink, but without
some pleasant surprises, this could
be the end of the line in the Bill
Doba era.
Oregon
A program that needs to prove its
toughness and its ability to finish a
season might be helped or hurt by a
simmering quarterback controversy
and a new offensive coordinator.
Defensive losses since the spring
won't help matters either.
Oregon State
The conference's most pleasant
surprise punctuated last season with
a last-second comeback win in the
Sun Bowl. A new quarterback is
only one of several puzzles for Mike
Riley, one of the nation's most
underrated coaches.
California
Despite losses at tailback and

Anderson
defensive line, Cal looks to keep the
engine humming for a sixth-straight
winning season. The pressure is on
early — the Bears get a season
opening chance to avenge last year's
pounding at the hands of the
Tennessee Volunteers.
Stanford
With new head coach Jim
Harbaugh highlighting athletic
director Bob Bowlsby's first full sea
son, Cardinal football is in great
position to improve. But with
injuries, depth issues and a tough
schedule, the team could be much
better and not do any better than
last year's 1-11 record.
UCLA
A wildly inconsistent 2006 season
has been largely forgotten in favor
of the Bruins' victory over USC.
Unless something has changed in
Westwood. don't expect to see the
same UCLA team two weeks in a
row.
Southern California
The Trojans are loaded and laud
ed — what else is new? USC likely
won't give away ballgames the way
it did last year; opponents will have
to beat them straight up. Pete
Carroll could be on the brink of leg
end status in modern-day college
football.
Arizona State
Ever since its 1997 Rose Bowl
loss, this has been a head-case pro
gram that could never get over the
hump. Dirk koetter, the coach who
let the players pick the 2006 starting
quarterback, was sent packing. Say
what you will about new Sun Devil
coach Dennis Erickson, but he
knows how to win.
Arizona
Despite improved recruiting and
defensive performance, the Wildcats

have been a zoo of offensive inepti
tude. Coach Mike Stoops is running
out of time to prove himself — if
shifty OB Willie Tuitama can't stay
healthy, the only question in Tucson
will be: "Is it basketball season yet?"
BAG THE COACHES' I*OLL
Someone has to say it: the college
football coaches' poll is a fraud. It
should be abolished.
On its face, the concept seems
sound: who better to evaluate foot
ball teams than coaches? Once you
go beneath that thin veneer, though,
its failures are obvious. Head coach
es don't have the time to watch
other teams' games. They watch
their own team's tape, and they
scout the opponent. Maybe there
are some highlights in between, but
nothing close to comprehensive
study.
Coaches must either rank teams
in ignorance (making the poll's
results garbage), or hand off the task
to someone in the know (crossing
the line of fraud). Both cases hap
pen and they both stink.
This is without mentioning the
conflict of interest. With million
dollar bowl payouts and incentive
bonuses on the line, manipulating
the system (by voting rival bowl can
didates down, or ranking opponents
up to raise strength-of-schedule) is a
temptation the public can't disre
gard. College coaches have enough
to do without facing a weekly ethical
crisis.
CELEBRITY STALKERS ON (".ABLE
Last Sunday, ESPN broadcast a
four-minute infomercial for
Cleveland quarterback Brady
Quinn disguised as the highlights of
the Browns-Lions preseason game.
We kept getting updates from Linda
Cohn, highlighting Quinn's every
move as he waited to go into the
game. ("He's chomping at the bit...
finally going to come into the game
...") We saw almost as many clips of

him on the sideline as we did of
actual football.
It was a reprise of the worldwide
leader's fulsome NFL Draft cover
age, stalking Notre Dame's Quinn
and Stanford's Trent Edwards
through their frustrating afternoons
of being picked lower than expect
ed.
Given this warmup, I fully expect
to see an ESPN reality show starring
Quinn, which could keep him busy
until he wins the starting job. That's
if we get to see the games at all
we are long past the time when
ESPN showed sports.

Stanford football all season long on
