# A grab bag of sports
## 
### 
Rather than taking the usual
approach this week, I
thought I'd offer up some
thing that's a little more of a grab
bag of what's up in the sports world.
Sure, it may not be straightforward,
but what is anymore?
STATE OF THE CONFERENCE
Let's start off with a bit of a State
of the Union address for the Pacific
-10 Conference. Amidst the market
ing machine that Stanford football
has become, it may be difficult to
remember that the Cardinal isn't
alone with its "Our house. Our
team. Our dream." Here's the short
skinny on all of the Pac-10 teams,
north to south:
Washington
What appeared to be a break
through 2(X)6 season went down the
tubes when the team's best player
got hurt. After two years at the helm
of a completely forlorn program.
Tyrone Willingham is on the hot
seat in the eyes of the fans. 11nsk\
Nation apparently iongs for the days
of Don James and NCAA proba
tion. Whether or not Willingham is
the man for the job. UW asked lor
these growing pains when they hired
Slick Rick Neuheisel.
Washington State
Injuries derailed the Cougars'
late-season bid for a bowl game, and
personnel losses have left this year's
team with serious holes. WSU has
the Pac-10's most experienced quar
terback in Alex Brink, but without
some pleasant surprises, this could
be the end of the line in the Bill
Doba era.
Oregon
A program that needs to prove its
toughness and its ability to finish a
season might be helped or hurt by a
simmering quarterback controversy
and a new offensive coordinator.
Defensive losses since the spring
won't help matters either.
Oregon State
The conference's most pleasant
surprise punctuated last season with
a last-second comeback win in the
Sun Bowl. A new quarterback is
only one of several puzzles for Mike
Riley, one of the nation's most
underrated coaches.
California
Despite losses at tailback and
