## Medical center proposes new "hospital zone" to city 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Medical Center pro
posed last week the creation of
a'Hospital District' as it plans to
expand its medical facilities by 1.3
million square feet. The new district
would in effect be a rezoning of the
current area in which the Medical
Center resides.
The existing zone classification for
the facility limits the amount of con
struction permitted on the land and
sets a building height limit of 50 feet.
Interim Director for Government
and Community Relations for
Stanford Hospital and Clinics
Andrew Coe said the rezoning would
"be unique in Palo Alto and apply
only to this project area."
Though tensions between the city
of Palo Alto and the Hospital have
run high regarding the expansion,
city officials seemed happy to at least
consider a new hospital zone. Bern
Beecham, a Palo Alto City Counsel
member, told The Daily that the
rezoning proposal was "appropri
ate."
"A hospital has unique require
ments, so it does make sense to have
a zone specifically for hospitals,"
Beecham said, "in order to allow us
to more precisely specify what will be
allowed in that zone."

Beecham added, however, that
should the new zoning proposal take
effect, the Medical Center will not be
given free-for-all permission to
expand without limit.
"No one should anticipate that
calling it a different zone will make
any issue easier for the city and the
University," Beecham said. "All of
the issues will still have to be
resolved, regardless of the name of
the zone."
Along with its proposed zone
shift, the Medical Center also
released data regarding its projected
employment increase — a subject
that has raised concerns with Palo
Alto officials regarding increased
traffic and the effect this will have on
the environment.
If the hospital expansion takes
effect, the Medical Center expects its
number of employees to increase by
1,991, bringing the number employ
ees up to a maximum of 11,934.
These employees will be split among
the School of Medicine, Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and
Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
"This increase is actually less than
many were speculating it would be,"
Coe said. "The increase is needed to
meet the increased demand for ser
vices to patients. We are increasing
the number of hospital beds, expand
ing the emergency room by nearly

four times its current size and, in gen
eral, adding much needed capacity to
facilities that are currently under
sized and unable to meet the commu
nity demand for medical services."
Beecham agreed that the pro
posed employment increase might
not have as large an impact on the
city as some originally feared.
"Palo Alto area has roughly
90,(XX) employees, so this is an
increase of roughly one percent,"
Beecham said. "It isn't doubling the
traffic impact, it's adding a thousand
commutes a day. The proportion of
impact may be low."
But Beecham was not positive in
his assessment of the expansion's low
traffic impact. He told TTie Daily that
the issue would be studied extensive
ly by the city before any decisions
were made regarding the rezoning
and the expansion. The city's

Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
will look at the imoact of the traffic
increase on the
Coe said he believed that once the
EIR has been completed, fears
regarding the project's effect on the
environment will be adequately
addressed.
"The environmental review which
the city of Palo Alto will conduct for
these projects will assess those
impacts and suggest mitigations to
offset them as a way to address con
cerns and fears people may have," he
said.
Both Coe and Beecham said they
expected the vote to approve the pro
posed project and rezoning to occur
in late 2008, after the EIR has been
completed.
