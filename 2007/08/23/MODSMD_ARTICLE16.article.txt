## Stanford racing team advances to semifinals 
### ANDREW SCHNEIDER 
The Stanford Racing team is one
step closer to victory in the Urban
Challenge, an autonomous ground
vehicle competition. The Defense
Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) announced two
weeks ago that the team will be
among 36 semifinalists for the com
petition.
Having tamed the rugged Mojave
Desert in 2005, the Stanford Racing
team now aims to conquer the
asphalt jungle of urban congestion
with its second robotic vehicle, a
computerized Volkswagen Passat
station wagon nicknamed Junior.
A qualifying event in late
October will cut the competing
teams down to the 20 that will com
pete in the final Urban Challenge
race on Nov. 3.
Two years ago, the Stanford
Racing Team's fully autonomous
Volkswagen Touareg nicknamed
Stanley won the 2005 DARPA
Grand Challenge's $2 million top
prize. Stanley successfully navigated
a fixed route of 132 miles through
the deserts of Nevada and Southern
California.
The team's latest vehicle has
been equipped to handle the chal
lenges of the streets. Junior is outfit
ted with modified steering, throttle
and brakes and is completely com
puter-controllable: high-tech sensors
and multiple GPS receivers enable
Junior to accurately calculate its
real-time global position within 50

centimeters, and laser radars scan in
every direction 15 times a second to
detect and track obstacles.
According to team leader and
Computer Science Prof. Sebastian
Thrun, Junior can understand all of
the components of a traffic scene,
recognizing everything from stop
signs, to lane markers, to other cars
— enabling it to make numerous
decisions, such as where to turn.
DARPA — the research arm of the
Department of Defense — conducts
its annual robotic vehicle race in
support of a 2001 Congressional
mandate to make one-third of oper
ational ground combat vehicles
unmanned by 2015.
Thrun said he had no qualms
about contributing to a project relat
ed to military action, saying that
DARPA has a long history of devel
oping positive technologies that ben
efit the general public. He cited the
Internet as one such creation; the
Internet was originally developed by
DARPA as a packet switching net
work called ARPANET.
Thrun also noted that the
Stanford Racing Team's ultimate
aim is to develop a vehicle that will
serve as a model for more advanced,
safer cars.
"Our goal," Thrun said, "is to
contribute to humankind at large by
reducing the number of traffic acci
dents. We'd like to make driving a
more productive activity."
