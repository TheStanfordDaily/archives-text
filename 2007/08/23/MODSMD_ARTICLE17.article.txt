## ALBUM REVIEW Raccoo-oo-oon: "Behold Secret Kingdom" review 
### SCOTT COOMES KZSU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many rock songs unfold in a
predictable fashion. As a track
begins, an opening guitar riff disori
ents the listener with an unfamiliar
take on a blues progression or an
underused mode. Upon a few repe
titions and with the introduction of
the standard pop trappings (4/4
rhythm. I-IV-V chord pattern, etc.),
the problematic fragment becomes
sanitized and domesticated. This
shift from unfamiliar territory back
to the expected and comfortable
conventions makes rock music so
gratifying; contrary to its image, it is
not the call to rebellion, but the pre
sentation of risky musical ideas and
their subsequent emasculation, that
defines most of the genre.
The ideological implications of
this are fairly transparent and a little
dangerous. Experimental music that
purposefully deviates from pop con
ventions, however, all too often
loses the drive and joy that makes
the rock illusion so convincing.
Thus, the choice for the discerning
rock enthusiast often falls into
empty (but fun) gestures at subver
sion, hedonism, self-pity and boring

pretension. Some recent psychedelic
and noise rock hands have been
attempting to bridge the gulf
between approachability and
uncompromising experimentation.
lowa City's Raccoo-00-oon is
among the few that manage to defy
the genre's formulas while retaining
its joy and energy.
Earlier this year, Raccoo-00-oon
released "Behold Secret Kingdom"
on labels Release the Bats and Not
Not Fun. While the band's excellent
album "Is Night People," reissued a
year ago, used experimental effects
to grant the psychedelia a playful
edge, the noisiness of "Behold
Secret Kingdom" makes listening an
unsettling experience.
Nevertheless, Raccoo-00-oon
somehow managed to create a much
more exciting album out of the
gloom and unstable intensity.
Processed freak-folk moans, free
jazz percussion, saxophones, elec
tronic chirps and growls and power
ful guitar combine into an intense
mass of sound. While many of these
elements characterize the rest of the
band's work, "Behold Secret
Kingdom" combines them in innov
ative ways, granting them a wide
palate of atmospherics at their dis

posal.
Each of these ingredients is
potent enough to dominate the
music on their own. but Raccoo-oo
oon blends them into a piercing, psy
chedelic stew that is a hit tricky to
consume, despite its tastiness. The
band does little to offer the listener
an easy entry point into the music
and it is refreshing to listening to a
rock album that does not guide you
by the hand through the scary parts.
From the beginning, Raccoo-oo
oon steeps the listener in their
chaos. Album opener "Broken
Branches" staggers in with a moody
and paranoid riff looking for a dirty
fight. A grumbling guitar wanders
on top of the off-kilter melody and
by the time the dissonant vocals
enter, the music is already a giant,
wonderful mess. Raccoo-00-oon
seems to take a risk by throwing the
listener into the thick of such psy
chedelic confusion from the begin
ning of the album but it seems to
work within the context of the rest
of the music.
The disorientation wipes away
the standard conventions while
introducing Raccoo-00-oon's own
musical logic. "Mirror Blanket"
seems a bit more coherent, with cool

and moody vocals moaning over a
funky beat. A distorted electronic
melody that falls somewhere in
between mutant bird calls and
processed fireworks drives the song.
In both of these tracks, it seems dif
ficult to find the "center" of the
music, as the vocals, melodies and
percussion all melt together without
any personality or voice to pull the

listener along.
"Visages of the Fox" takes this
absence a hit further, as ominous
percussive rattles and modified
vocal howls swirl around an empty
axis, until quiet, rumbling guitar
enters as a substitute. While the first
three songs do offer some great

atmospheric textures, they certainly
aren't catchy and their cool dark
ness require a bit of deep listening.
With "Antler Mask," however,
Raccoo-00-oon finally throws the
listener a distinct and precise musi
cal idea. "Antler Mask" recalls "Is
Night People" with its joyful call
and response riffs on top of free
jazz sax and percussion. Even when
Raccoo-00-oon offers a tangible
bit of rock guitar, they manage to
imbue it with a quite subtle How of
tension and release. The piece gets
messier and messier with sax
squeals and percussive rumbles,
until it breaks clear into a clear,
almost poppy, rock song.
"Diamonds In The Dunes"
offers nearly three minutes of pret
ty staccato guitar melody. The calm
relaxation is only slightly unnerving,
the lone hint that the track is mere
ly a prelude for the album's most
genius moment. Right as
"Diamonds" awkwardly sputters
out, "Invisible Sun" kicks in with
the full band playing at full volume.

Saxophone roars over the pounding
drums while the guitar throws an
angry and violent fit. The intensity
eventually subsides for a few final
moments of processed weirdo
effects, the dizzy calm after the
storm.
"Fangs and Arrows" returns to
the feel of the beginning of the
album with a free jazz edge. Layers
of saxophone whine and electronic
scream builds until eventually dying
out. The track is still convincing,
although it is a bit disappointing that
the intensity does not go anywhere.
The album finishes heavy with "Tail
At Prospect Peak." Ominous and
slow beats over blasts of industrial
noises serve as an introduction for a
slow, brooding guitar groove. The
last two tracks, though strong, fail to
live up to the "Invisible Sun," the
album's climax, and the strong sense
of direction that drove the first three
quarters of the album feels watered
down by the end.
Despite this weaker conclusion,
"Behold Secret Kingdom" remains
a solid album. Ideological implica
tions of their experimentation aside,
the strange sonic territories that
Raccoo-00-oon explores are not
only challenging but also fun, which
is the point of rock music in the end.
