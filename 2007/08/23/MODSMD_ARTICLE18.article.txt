## Avenue Q: Full frontal puppet nudity 
### ALEX COLEY INTERMISSION Q-BERT 
Even if your knowledge of Broadway
musicals is, like mine, limited to "Rent:
The Movie," you've probably heard
something about "Avenue Q," the Tony
Award-winning Broadway musical cur
rently playing in San Francisco. You Tube
connoisseurs will have seen the clips
already — clips of puppets (yes, puppets,
like on "Sesame Street"), singing songs
with outrageous titles like: "Everyone's a
Little Bit Racist," "It Sucks to Be Me"
and "If You Were Gay." Sound like a
musical fit for the 12-15 year old demo
graphic? Surprisingly, it reaches out to a
much wider (and older) audience.
It's easy to see why. The subject mat
ter is painfully relevant: Life, with a cap
ital L — not the cushy living we enjoy for
four precious years on the Farm. The
Life presented in "Avenue Q" is a scary
one, haunted by bills, rent money and the
specter of (unemployment. We're also
supposed to follow a love story, but it
takes a backseat to its irreverent humor
and painfully honest take on real life.
Anyone who has graduated college
should feel straightaway for the charac
ters. Those of us still in college have rea

son to be afraid of what looms ahead.
The inhabitants of this dilapidated block
on "Avenue Q," a forgotten street in
what looks to be Brooklyn, have a wide
age range. From wide-eyed post-grads
like Princeton, the jobless English major
searching for his "Purpose" in life to the
weary, burnt out 30-something neighbor
named Christmas Eve, a recently immi
grated Japanese landlord.
Other characters include Princeton's
love interest Kate Monster, a kinder
garten teacher's assistant with big
dreams; Rod, the paradoxically Gay and
Republican investment banker; his scrub
by longtime roommate Nicky; the porn
addicted Trekkie Monster; and best of all,
Gary Coleman, played beautifully by a
woman. Each of the wonderfully eclectic
"Avenue Q" residents must deal with the
problems of life's infinite hardship as they
strive against all odds towards success.
Nostalgia for more youthful days
lingers, and judging from the titles of
songs like "I Wish 1 Could Go Back to
College," you might wonder if "Avenue
Q" isn't much more than a mushy throw
back to greener pastures.
From the moment Princeton, essen
tially a bastardized Muppet, takes the
stage, you know that "Avenue 0" is

more than sentimental drivel. Driven by
the potty-mouths of its puppets, whose
voices ring out expletives in tones evok
ing sappily sweet "Sesame Street,"
"Avenue Q" aspires to the level of top
notch parody. The writers were openly
going for an adult-oriented "Sesame
Street." aimed to teach not four year old
kids but bright-eyed twenty-two-year
olds like Princeton just what they can do
"with a B.A. in English." Indeed, the
show's finale underlies a basic aphorism
we'd all do to keep in mind: aside from
death and taxes, "everything in life is
only for now" — and that includes unem
ployment, depression, poverty and inse
curity.
But does the show really live up to its
edgy reputation? Not in my mind. "South
Park" has been offering biting, politically
incorrect social commentary (combined
with a large serving of toilet humor) in
primitive cartoon form for years, delight
ing fans of all ages. It raised the bar in
1999, when its creators transformed the
TV show into a full blown, feature-length
Hollywood musical. Five years later,
Avenue Q made its Broadway debut.
"Avenue Q" is worth the price of
