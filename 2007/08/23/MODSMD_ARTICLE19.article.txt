# SPREAD THE MOUTH LOVING
## Throw a national "Kiss and Make Up Day" party 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION SERIAL SMOOCHER 
F.very couple who has ever fought knows
the best way to make up is making out. Why
not put this knowledge to work by throwing a
party to celebrate National Kiss and Make Up
Day, which falls on Friday, August 24th.
Here's everything you need to throw the best
(and probably only) National Kiss and Make
Up day party in your hall. After all, it serves
the dual purpose of giving you a reason to
throw one last summer bash and ensuring
you'll have fewer enemies going into the next
social season.
Invite List: The point of the holiday is to
bury the hatchet on old grievances, so invite
anyone and everyone who has ever rankled
you. The PWRI prof you'll never forgive for
that A-? Sure thing, as long as you don't mind
making out with him. Former dormmate
you've been maliciously facebook stalking
since freshman year? She's a shoo-in. Make
sure to invite a few people your close friends
hate too —just don't brief your buddies on
the guest list first. Go ahead and invite that
scheming dirtbag ex that your best friend never
quite got over. If the party goes well, she might
just end up getting under him before the ice in

everyone's drinks has melted.
I decorations: Look, we're college kids —
hide the overflowing laundry hamper, wipe the
beer rings off your University-issued furniture
and you're ready to go. But if you want to take
decorations to the next level, why not hang a
lew KISS posters on the wall. Smooching is
right in the band name, and judging by their
foundation-crusted mugs, they know a thing or
two about make-up. If you don't have any
KISS posters of your own (thank goodness)
just troll the halls listening for World of
Warcraft noises and the guys inside will proba
bly be able to help you out.
Cocktails: Any good party with "kiss" in the
title needs a little social lubrication. Some
libidinous-themed cocktails should get peo
ple's juices flowing. Here's a few:
Dracula's Kiss: Coat the bottom of a marti
ni glass with half an ounce of grenadine, then
add ice and 1 oz. black cherry vodka (Smirnoff
has a decent one). Top with cola and garnish
with maraschino cherries. Like a kiss from an
actual vampire, this should leave your guests
wanting more. Or cause them to dig into one of
your major arteries. Either way, it's win/win.
Strawberry Kiss: In a martini shaker, shake 1
oz. tequila, V2 oz. light rum, 1 oz. chocolate
liqueur and 1 oz. half and half. Strain into mar

tini glass and garnish with a fresh strawberry.
Or, more realistically, dump into a big red cup
and chug.
Party (fames: This party is the perfect
excuse to trot out a few classic kissing games
like Spin the Cell Phone. Kiss or Dare, or Hide
and Go Get It. Ah, to be in middle school
again. Try a round of "Mmm Melt" as an ice
breaker (literally). To play, seat guests in a cir
cle and make sure to snag a spot between two
people with whom you wouldn't mind sucking
face. Then give one player an ice cube. The
goal of the game is to pass the cube from per
son to person using nothing but your mouths.
The cube will start to melt after a few passes.
After a few more, so will you. To spice things
up, start several cubes going in different direc
tions. Or just give everyone their own cube and
start that orgy you've always wanted.
But kissing is only one half of the Kiss and
Make Up equation. In order to ensure you'll
have invitees for next year's bash, it's wise to
plant the seeds of a few new vendettas that will
need kissing and making up in the future.
A few rounds of Stool of Repentance should
do the trick. To play the game, one person
leaves the room and the rest of the players go
around and state one of his sins. "He's vain,"
"She really buys her shoes from Target," "He

hit my tongue during spin the cell phone" —
you get the idea. When everyone's had their say,
the victim is led back in and sits on a st(X)l. The
charges against him are read one by one and he
tries to guess who said what. If he guesses an
accusation correctly, the accuser is the next vic
tim; if not, the victim is led back outside while
the rest of the players go at him again. Careful,
though. After two rounds as the victim in this
game, even Mother Teresa would be ready to
shank a bitch.
If the party goes well, you'll have ended
some feuds, started a few new ones, made out
with a ton of random people and gotten com
pletely plastered. And isn't that really what the
warm spirit of forgiveness is all about?
