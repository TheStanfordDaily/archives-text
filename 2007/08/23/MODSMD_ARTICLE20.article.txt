### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION TRAILER TRASH 
"Kate and Leopold" retread, it is, but
I'll bet you $5 that it'll be better than
that Meg Ryan-Hugh Jackman cata
strophe. The Princess' prince comes
to New York in order to save her but
he too is woefully out of place...but

poke fun at its animated classics in
order to appeal to a wider audience
and the result looks suprisingly hilar

fully out of place. If this sounds like a
