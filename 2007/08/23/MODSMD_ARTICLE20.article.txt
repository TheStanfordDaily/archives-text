### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION TRAILER TRASH 
"Kate and Leopold" retread, it is, but
I'll bet you $5 that it'll be better than
that Meg Ryan-Hugh Jackman cata
strophe. The Princess' prince comes
to New York in order to save her but
he too is woefully out of place...but
wait, is our Princess falling in love
with her contemporary Knight in
Shining Armor, played by James
Marsden ("Hairspray")? The answer
is probably yes but the trailer never
fails to entice, except when it throws
in a stereotypical "sassy black
woman" in case it had forgotten any
movie-going demographics.

"I'm Not There"
Director: Todd Haynes
Starring: Christian Bale, Cate
Blanchett, Richard Gere and Heath
ledger
Opens: Nov. 21,2(K)7 (New York and
Los Angeles)
"I'm Not There" follows the life of
pop culture icon Boh Dylan and fea
tures six different actors in the lead
role, including Cate Blanchett. The
trailer does not offer any insight as to
how these various performances have
been integrated to create a cohesive
plot but it does offer an exciting
glimpse into what should be an inter
esting film. Most astonishing is the
varied kx>k of the film. Each segment
follows a different stage of Dylan's
life, and each has a distinet style. Oh,
and in case you were wondering if
Blanchett makes a convincing Dylan,
the jury's still out on that one.
"Enchanted"
Director: Kevin Lima
Starring: Amy Adams, Patrick
Dempsey, James Marsden and Susan
Sarandon
Opens: Nov. 21, 2(X)7
Well, Disney's finally decided to
poke fun at its animated classics in
order to appeal to a wider audience
and the result looks suprisingly hilar
ious. In "Enchanted" an animated
princess (Adams) ends up in modern
day Manhattan where she is delight
fully out of place. If this sounds like a

"There Will lie Wood"
Director: Paul Thomas Anderson
Starring: Daniel Day Lewis, Paul
Dano, Ciaran Hinds
Opens: Dec. 26, 2(K)7 (Limited
Release)
Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie
Nights." "Punch Drunk Love") adapts
Upton Sinclair's "Oil!" in his latest
film. The trailer juxtaposes a mono
logue from Daniel Day Lewis' charac
ter with snippets from throughout the
film, revealing little of the plot and
building dramatic tension with every
second. What the plot is I can only
guess but 1 do know that I'll be first in
line when this film opens in December.

"Lions for Lambs"
Director: Robert Redford
Starring: Tom Cruise, Robert
Redford and Meryl Streep
Opens: Nov. 9, 2(X)7
If you've been waiting all year for a
film about how you're responsible for
neverending wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, this trailer should get vou
excited. This is Tom Cruise's first film
with new production partner United
Artists hut the trailer is standard
I lollywood political fare, with Mervl
Streep acting tongue-tied and Tom
Cruise wearing a vest and asking
insightful questions like, "Yes or No?"
Robert Redford informs a young man
(probably acting as metaphor for the
American people) tTiat "Rome is burn
ing." Thanks, Bob. Glad we cleared
that up. At the end of the trailer, "1 .ions
for Limbs" asks us what we stand for. I
stand for not seeing this movie.
