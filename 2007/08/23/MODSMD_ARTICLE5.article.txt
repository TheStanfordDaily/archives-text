## STUDENT LIFE Roundabouts to regulate bike traffic 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS 
Students accustomed to racing through White Plaza and
the notorious "Intersection of Death" will be slowed by two
bicycle roundabouts being installed this summer by the
University's Department of Planning.
The roundabouts will help divert traffic flow around two
permanent structures at the southern end of Lasuen Mall in
front of the clock tower and at the northern entrance to White
Plaza. New sidewalks will also be installed to separate pedes
trians from the stream of bicycles that pass through one of
Stanford's busiest thoroughfares.
"The goal is to slow down students," said Associate
Director of Campus Planning and Design Kathy Blake.
"Right now people go through the intersections full speed
ahead, and it can be very dangerous."
According to construction plans for the roundabouts, stu
dents will travel counterclockwise around one of the turn
arounds and into a two-lane straightaway between the
Barnum Center and Building 500 that will direct them into a
second roundabout. Ground-painted bike traffic signs are
expected to help direct bicyclers through the interchange.
The roundabouts are part of a larger master plan to
redesign the center of campus, along with the renovation of
Old Union and plans to create more lawn space in White
Plaza in order to improve its available space for performance
events.
Blake said that students, faculty and staff who participated
in interviews and workshops identified the locations for the
planned roundabouts as a source of major concern given the
heavy volume of traffic these areas receive during a normal
day. She also noted that while a trend in bike collisions was
not the original impetus for the design concept, anecdotal evi
dence of reported collisions and nervous pedestrians crossing
into the intersections drove calls for the roundabouts.
"In transportation planning, bike circles are all over the
place and have been very successful," Blake said, citing simi
lar structures at UC-Davis and other locations. "It will be
interesting to see how the construction will go since we don't
have a culture of bike circles on campus yet."
Last year the Stanford Band constructed a rudimentary
roundabout in front of the clock tower to help improve traffic
flow. Blake said that while plans for the roundabouts were
already being considered, the Band's efforts helped accelerate

the implementation of the project.
Planning officials have also reduced
the amount of landscaping inside the
circles to make room for student art
work and design conccpts after stu
dents adorned last year's makeshift
structure with a sculpture and some
decorations.
While the students with whom
Blake spoke welcomed the changes,
others worried that the roundabouts
might impede traffic flow.
"I've had some close calls," Aaron
Kofman 4 09 said. "But bikers are
capable of navigating the intersection
themselves. It seems like everything
will slow down and make passing
through more difficult."
