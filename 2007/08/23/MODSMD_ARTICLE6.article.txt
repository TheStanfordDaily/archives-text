## Renowned lit prof passes away Jay Fliegelman loses battle to cancer and liver disease. 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
Acclaimed Americanist and English Prof. Jay Fliegelman Ph.D.
'77 passed away on Aug. 14 after succumbing to liver disease and
at nee r. He was 58.
A graduate of Wesleyan University, Fliegelman was acting direc
tor of Stanford's American Studies Program from 1991-1994 and
chair of the English Department from 1994-1997.
Undergraduates knew Fliegelman best for his "American Literature
and Culture to 1855" course that American Studies Director and
English Prof. Shelley Fisher Fishkin called "legendary." Fliegelman
was known for developing striking new ideas in the middle of lec
tures and spiraling off onto insightful tangents.
"He would lecture pretty much without notes," said Associate
English Prof. Gavin Jones. "He would re-read everything if he was
teaching a course and basically come up with entirely new material.
He was so emotionally and intellectually engaged with it that he
wouldn't repeat himself."
"He had an intense personal relationship with the writers he read
and taught," Fishkin added in an email to The Daily. "He conveyed
their ideas with as much of a sense of intimacy and immediacy as if
he were reporting a recent conversation with a friend."
Fliegelman, who taught the course for nearly 30 years and made
this winter's version the finale, lectured as long as his health held out.
"He taught through the winter quarter and in fact wanted to con
tinue teaching as best as he could until he just didn't have the
strength," said English Department Chair and Prof. Ramon
Saldivar. "He tried to teach a course in the spring, but by that time
his illness had advanced."
Beloved by many students, Fliegelman received both the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching and the ASSU Award tor
Outstanding Teaching.

"His love for literature was only sur
passed by his love for teaching," said
Pagan Harris '09, who took
Fliegelman's American literature
course. "His approach to his work and
to his students was one that fully
encompassed the spirit of academia —
a genuine appreciation for the pursuit of
knowledge and the full embrace of the
joy that accompanies sharing knowl
edge with others. I really did love this
guy: a great, great professor."
"His intellectual curiosity was infec
tious," Fishkin added. "Rarely could
you come away from a conversation
with Jay without a burning desire to
read something you hadn't read before.

He had a passion for learning and a passion for teaching and he
shared both with his students and colleagues. No question was too
small — or too big."
Students and colleagues lauded Fliegelman as one of the top fig
ures in his field, while also celebrating his personal warmth and
approachability.
"He has been so supportive of his students, and also of junior lac
ultv members such as myself," Jones said. "He basically gave his life
to others selflessly in the way in which he would read the work of
others. He had this knack to get inside your project and almost
inhabit it and figure out what it was really about."
Former graduate advisee Chris Phillips Ph.D. '07 also described
Fliegelman's "hip playfulness" — exemplified in how the professor
once joked at a Modern Language Association conference,
"Fliegelman is the name, colonial's my game."
Students gathered for a May 20 "Jay Fest" celebration to honor
Fliegelman s life and work. Over 65 participants from across the
country convened for panels and a last chance to be in Fliegelman's
presence.


JAY FLIEGELMAN
"It was very moving," Phillips said.
"Jay was in high form at that time. He
knew already what was going to hap
pen, but he was enjoying being with
the people who he cared about."
Phillips credited Fliegelman with
inspiring him to enter the Ph.D. pro
gram in English. Phillips was the last
student to graduate from the program
as Fliegelman's advisee, a realization
he ailled "moving."
He described Fliegelman as both
professionally and personally inspir
ing.
"He was particularly amazing with
his wife, Chnstine," Phillips said. "I
knew Jay for several years before he
and Christine got together, and he had
more of a bachelor persona. When he

and Christine got together, he found
the person he was supposed to go
through his life with. They seemed
complete when they were together."
Fliegelman was also an avid collec
tor of rare books. He purchased
books from the 16th through 18th
centuries, and developed a course
three years ago that used his personal
library to explore the history of book
publishing.
One of the first books in the profes
sor s collection was Frederick
Douglass' "My Bondage and My
Freedom." According to Phillips,
Fliegelman discovered the book in a
fellow professor's collection and began
bragging about its unique qualities —
Douglass gave this particular copy to
the woman who bought his freedom.
The professor sold the book to
Fliegelman, but at a much higher cost
after he learned of its worth.
Fliegelman learned liis lesson. He
once walked out of an antique book

shop with a $200 copy of the Iliad in
French. But the seller had neglected to
look at the second title page, overlook
ing the priceless inscription from the
French embassy to "His Excellency
James Madison" on the president's
second inauguration.
Prof. Saldivar said the English
Department has been hoping for sev
eral years to find another professor
who could supplement Fliegelman's
early American literature work. The
search for such a faculty member will
commence in September.
"It's not to replace Jay," Saldivar
said. "[The appointment] was intend
ed to be a complement. With someone
as famous and important as Jay, you
can't just go out and replace them."
There will be a memorial for
Fliegelman sometime during autumn
quarter.
