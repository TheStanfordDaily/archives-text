## Stanford takes fourth in national rankings 
### STUART BAIMEL 
Eager high school students across the
country thumbed through last week's
issue of US News & World Report, des
perate to see the college ranking so wide
ly anticipated that the press release
announcing their publication was actually
embargoed to generate suspense. After
claims of leaked rankings lit up Internet
blogs for weeks, the official rankings
were released last Friday, met by a
firestorm of controversy about their pre
sumed importance.
Stanford remained fourth in maga
zine's 2008 ranking, part of the annual
"America's Best Colleges" issue, trailing
only perennial list-toppers Princeton,
Harvard and Yale.
The ranking methodology takes into
account factors including the SAT scores
of incoming students, the percentage of
freshmen in the top 10 percent of their
high school class, the percentage of alum
ni who donate and, the most controver
sial criterion of all, "reputation" — a cat
egory in which college presidents score
institutions other than their own.
"We're pleased to be recognized as
one of the top universities in the coun

try," said Jeff Wachtel '79, special assis
tant to President John Hennessy.
The rankings have received much crit
icism this year, as a rising tide of universi
ty presidents, education advocates and
commentators have decried the list as
misrepresentative of the mission of high
er education.
Their cries against the rankings
echoed the sentiments of former
University President Gerhard Casper in
the mid-19905. Casper declared in an
open letter to US News & World Report
that universities can no more easily be
ranked than magazines, calling the list
"utterly misleading."
Lloyd Thacker, director of the
Education Conservancy, a Portland. Ore
based advocacy group and think-tank, is
building an alliance of college presidents
against the rankings. Sixty-four presi
dents have signed onto a letter refusing to
submit the statistical data that forms the
backbone of the rankings.
Wachtel said that Stanford will contin
ue to submit data for the ranking system.
"[The rankings] do not affect
Stanford's behavior much," he said. "We
are pursuing a path we think is right. The
rankings have no effect on the faculty's

approach to research."
While Wachtel claimed Stanford was
above succumbing to ranking-mania,
Thackcr argued that some schools want
nothing more than to boost their status.
"Rankings become important for self
image and portraying success," he said.
Thacker noted that need-based aid at
universities has remained constant in the
past decade while merit-based aid has
increased six fold, as colleges more
aggressively pursue high-scoring students
in an effort to rise in the rankings.
Stanford does not offer merit-based
aid.
"It's irresponsible to rank colleges,"
Thacker said. "The rankings imply a
degree of precision and authority that is
not supported by educational research.
They do not measure what really matters
in higher education."
The rankings have spawned an entire
industry that Thacker said amounts to
more than $4 billion annually.
Management consultants for universities
alone account for $1 billion of that total.
Thacker said the figures reflected the
"commercialization of hit>her education."
