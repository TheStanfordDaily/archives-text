## Sketch Addiction 
### 
1 think I may have an addictive
personality. Not in the sense that
after people get the smallest
taste of Nav, they can't stop coming
hack for more (rather the opposite
is true, in fact). No, what I mean is
that when I latch onto a new vice,
I find it very hard to let go. Sadly,
my vices aren't particularly inter
esting. I'm not an alcoholic
(although I'm continually working
on changing that state of affairs). I
don't really do drugs (I'm not cool
enough). I'm not really addicted to
nicotine (I'm very good at giving
up smoking—l've done it more
times than I can recall). And I'm
not a nymphomaniac (this is not
due to a lack of trying). My vice is
something else: The Internet.
I've written before on the dan
gers of the Internet, in particular
how its existence is destroying the
possibility of achievement in grad
uate school. However, today I
want to focus not on the conse
quences, but rather on the thing
itself. Let us explore the meander
ings of the insidious beast and dis
cover how it drills holes into our
minds and fills them with multiple
copies of Paris Hilton.
Amongst my internet-addicted
triends, I think the various sub-cat
egories of electronic fixation break
down into four distinct branches.
First off, there's sport. Some folk
just can't get enough. And, with
the help of the Web, there's really
no limit. I have friends whose
knowledge of high school
prospects each year is so detailed
that, when it is combined with
their equally in-depth knowledge
of the heartthrobs of the gridiron,
I start to ponder motives.
Following sports online is dis
tinctly different from doing it in
person. The emphasis changes
from the thing itself to the process.
We start to care as much for the
backroom deals that got David
Beckham to L.A., as for the preci
sion of his footwork. But I digress.
Physics. Now, I realize that fol
lowing physics online might not be
a universal phenomenon. And.
what's more, one might naively
think that this aspect of addiction
is not such a bad thing for a physi
cist. Alter all, it would seem a nat
ural part of the job.
The problem is, though, that
following physics online tends to
be the equivalent of reading super
market tabloids instead of the
Paper ol Record. Blogs. We read
blogs about physics. Blogs that are
as filled with gossip and idle chat
ter, as they are with anything else.
Third up: Entertainment. This
is the real leech of the bunch.
Celebrity gossip. It is amazing how
many hours can be put into

researching the precise blood alco
hol level of Lindsay Lohan on any
given day. It's also surprising that
so many budding academics
choose to fill their minds with fac
toids about the sex lives of
Hollywood stars as a distraction
from work.
Finally, we come to my person
al vice. Politics. I think 1 must
spend at least four hours every day
hopping from one political blog to
another. In fact, I just took a 10
minute break from writing this col
umn to find out what The New
Republic and The National
Review had to say this morning
(Armenian genocide seems to be
on everyone's minds).
Like my earlier example of
sporting obsession, following poli
tics online is of a very different
quality to actually involving one
self. It's much more like a game.
You become slowly obsessed not
with what people are saying, but
rather with how and why. The art
of winning and, more importantly,
that of beating the other guy, takes
center stage in online discussions.
Actually, this really is a univer
sal property of online forays.
Process takes precedence over
principle (principle is not really
the most appropriate word here,
but it's the best beginning with
"p"). This is not necessarily a good
or a bad thing— it's just the
nature of the beast. The
rapid hack and forth of informa
tion lends itself best to intellectual
guerrilla warfare. It's easy to be
unconsidered and aggressive (and
a lot more fun, too), so that's what
we do. Furthermore, it's much
more addictive.
Spending hours reading foreign
policy essays in international rela
tions journals is dull. Passing that
time reading 300 word snippets
and a dozen dilferent blogs, how
ever ... Well, let's just say it gives
me a buzz like nothing else.
Like all addicts, I tell myself I
could quit anytime. I just do this
out of boredom. If there is some
thing else that needed to be done,
I could drop the 'net in a heart
beat. In reality, though ... Well,
guess what I'll be doing after I fin
ish this sentence.
