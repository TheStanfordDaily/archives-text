## Red rice, obesity viruses & smart birds?

£ £ he was all over him like
white on rice." We might
Vj have to update the old say
ing, because it turns out rice wasn't
always white. Ten thousand years
ago, all rice was red. Research pub
lished this week shows that white
rice today takes its color from a
mutation in a single gene in red rice.
The mutation truncates a critical
protein in the molecular pathway
leading to rice's red color.
The research suggests that early
farmers selected the pale variety of
rice and spread it all over the world.
White rice cooks faster, and its hull is
easier to pick off — two traits that
would have made it a more valuable
crop than its red relative.

the days of hysteria over genetically
modified foods. There are certainly
valid reasons to be worried about
wanton doctoring of DNA, but it
brings some perspective to the issue
to realize that when it comes to our
food, it's all been genetically modi
fied. The standard "non-modified"
white rice is actually a mutation
spread by early farmers.
Now for some weirder news:
Could obesity be spread by a virus?
Adenovirus-36 is a common bug that
causes respiratory and eye infections

in humans. Researchers at
Louisiana State University
announced this week that the virus
may be causing more that sneezes
and watery eyes: it could be acceler
ating the obesity epidemic.
The researchers used hunks of fat
sucked out of patients via liposuc
tion, and isolated adult stem cells
from the tissue. These powerful stem
cells are capable of turning into
bone, cartilage, fat and muscle. In
this experiment, exposing the cells to
adenovirus-36 turned them into fat
cells.
Adenovirus-36 has come under
scrutiny before. Previous research
showed that chickens and mice
injected with the virus gained more
weight than the control group.
Another study found that 30 percent
of obese people were infected with
adenovirus-36, compared to 11 per
cent of skinny individuals.
But there may yet be hope. In

addition to demonstrating the nefar
iousness of adenovirus-36, scientists
may also have uncovered a way to
fight it. The same research group
from Louisiana announced that
they've found the specific gene in
adenovirus-36 that makes infected
animals fatter. According to the
researchers, the gene could be tar
geted in future human therapies such
as vaccines and antiviral medicines.
A vaccine against obesity? I'm a bit
skeptical, but what the heck. Sign me
up — and then pass me the potato
chips.
Ornithological news: Some very
smart crows are proving that "bird
brain" may actually be a compli
ment. New Caledonian crows look a
lot like their local relatives, but they
live only in a smattering of islands off
the coast of Australia. In 2(X)2, the
crows impressed researchers by clev
erly making tools out of wire, a
material they don't encounter in the
wild.
Two birds, Betty and Abel, were
choosing between a straight piece of
wire and a hooked piece of wire to
retrieve a small bucket of their
favorite meat. When Abel flew off
with the hooked wire, an undeterred

Betty simply tweaked the straight
wire into a hook and snatched her
snack.
It turns out the crows' talents
extend even further. Researchers at
the University of Auckland reported

this week that the birds can sponta
neously use one tool on another tool
to get a snack. The awed researchers
called it "meta-tool use."
The crows were presented with
some meat in a hole, along with a
stick too short to reach the snack.
They also got a longer stick that
could access the food, hut it was out
of reach inside a box. The clever
crows used the short stick to get the
long stick out of the box, and then

used the long stick to snag their tasty
snack.
Six out of seven birds solved the
problem on their first try — evi
dence of true reasoning ability rather
than simple trial and error. The
crows actually do as well as apes in
solving the problem. Not bad for a
bunch of featherbrains!
