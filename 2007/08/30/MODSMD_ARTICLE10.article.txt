## Let me buy you a drink, beetle style 
### 
Do you read your horoscope?
Evidently the month you
were bom is supposed to
influence your personality and for
tune. I'm a Pisces, so I'm supposed
to be compassionate, empathetic,
sensitive and dreamy.
As a proud skeptic, I don't put
any stock in astrology, but I may
have prematurely dismissed the
idea that one's birth month is influ
ential. It turns out that when you
were born has a big effect on your
eyesight.
In a study published this week,
researchers at Tel Aviv University
looked at data on 300,(XX) Israeli

youths and correlated their months
of birth with incidences of near
sightedness. Individuals born in the
summer months were far more like
ly to need glasses than those born in
the winter —those with birthdays
in June and July had a 24 percent
greater chance of nearsightedness

than those born in December and
January.
The correlation is all about sun
light. Previously, scientists studying
nearsighted chickens realized that
their eyeballs lengthened when
exposed to prolonged illumination.
(Nearsighted eyes are longer than
normal.) Weirdly, this lengthening
process seems to be under the con
trol of melatonin, the hormone that
sets the body's circadian rhythms.
According to the Tel Aviv scien
tists, more hours of sunlight means
less melatonin production, which

leads to a longer, nearsighted eye.
So, if you were horn in the summer,
you might want to start looking at
eyeglass frames now.
From ophthalmology to psychol
ogy: Scientists at Duke University
have bred mice with a rodent ver
sion of obsessive-compulsive disor
der. The obsessive-compulsive mice
cower in the corners of their cages
and groom their faces raw. A press
release photo shows a mouse whose
compulsive grooming erased half
the fur on its face, leaving bald and
bloody patches. The mice are simi
lar to obsessive-compulsive
humans, who often show pathologi
cal grooming behavior, including
hair-pulling, skin-picking and exces
sive hand-washing.
The discovery of the obsessive
compulsive mice was a lucky acci
dent — nobody was looking for
mentally ill rodents. The Duke
researchers' original intent was to
do basic research into how individ

ual brain cells communicate. They
used genetic engineering to knock
out a neurotransmitter called
SAPAP3, and the resulting mice
showed up with sores and bald
patches. Videotaping confirmed
these wounds were self-inflicted,
and the researchers realized they
had discovered a mouse model for
OCD.
Like humans with OCD, the
obsessive-compulsive mice got bet
ter when given a class of antidepres
sants called SSKIs. The rodents
could also provide insight into drugs
beyond SSRIs. If faulty SAPAP3
has a role in human OCD. the neu
rotransmitter could be a novel drug
target for the 2.2 million Americans
who suffer from this debilitating
disorder.
X-rated news from the insect
world: It turns out female beetles
may have sex because they're
thirsty. University of Exeter biolo
gists studied Callosobruchus macu
latus, a small brown beetle that is a
serious agricultural pest. The male
of the species has an enormous vol
ume of ejaculate, accounting for up
to 10 percent of its body weight.
(Imagine a human male with 20 lbs

of semen!) There's a reason male C.
maculatus climax so copiously
it's their "nuptial gift" to females,
who can absorb water from the ejac
ulate left in their reproductive tract
after mating.
Given this information,
researchers began to wonder if
female C. maculatus might have sex
to remedy dehydration. To test the
idea, some female beetles were give
unlimited access to water, while
others prevented from getting any
water at all. The water-starved
females mated 40 percent more
often than females who had plenty
of access to water.
The research into dehydrated
beetle sex is the weirdest piece of
science news I've seen all summer.
I'm imaging a beetle version of
"Maxim", with tips for scoring with
the ladies. "Take her out to dinner,
and don't buy her anything to drink!
She'll be so thirsty she won't be able
to keep her hands off you!"
Hopefully no human males will take
ideas from C. maculatus.
