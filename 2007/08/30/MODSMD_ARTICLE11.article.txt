## Putting Out 
### 
People often ask mc whv I pur
sue a career in physics. After
all. failure is inevitable.
That dream career as the next
Einstein isn't really going happen.
And there are so many other (much
better paid) options. Why do I stick
with studying the universe when I
could be a Master of it instead?
Posing the above to friend earlier
this week I got (with a little para
phrasing) the following answer:
"It's like dating a really hot girl
who won't sleep with you. You
know there's no point. You know
you should walk away. But some

how you can't, you have to wait for
her to do the breaking up."
And, you know, I think he's on to
something.
(I should point out at this junc
ture that I'm only guessing that the
analogy worksâ€”l really have no
personal experience of the scenario
in question.)
We're driven by the illusion of
hope. The fantasy that, despite the
enormous amount of evidence to
the contrary, it's all going to be
alright.
As it happens, this particular
problem with my life has been

brought into sharp focus recently.
I've been starting the process ol try
ing to find a job; my days are cur
rently filled hunting down potential
postdocs, requisitioning recommen
dation letters and filling in forms
The process is long, arduous and
ultimately futile. While I suspect it
won't be a complete washout (lin
gers crossed), I can't help but feel
that this journey is going to end up
