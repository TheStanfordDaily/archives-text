## Putting Out 
### 
People often ask mc whv I pur
sue a career in physics. After
all. failure is inevitable.
That dream career as the next
Einstein isn't really going happen.
And there are so many other (much
better paid) options. Why do I stick
with studying the universe when I
could be a Master of it instead?
Posing the above to friend earlier
this week I got (with a little para
phrasing) the following answer:
"It's like dating a really hot girl
who won't sleep with you. You
know there's no point. You know
you should walk away. But some

how you can't, you have to wait for
her to do the breaking up."
And, you know, I think he's on to
something.
(I should point out at this junc
ture that I'm only guessing that the
analogy worksâ€”l really have no
personal experience of the scenario
in question.)
We're driven by the illusion of
hope. The fantasy that, despite the
enormous amount of evidence to
the contrary, it's all going to be
alright.
As it happens, this particular
problem with my life has been

brought into sharp focus recently.
I've been starting the process ol try
ing to find a job; my days are cur
rently filled hunting down potential
postdocs, requisitioning recommen
dation letters and filling in forms
The process is long, arduous and
ultimately futile. While I suspect it
won't be a complete washout (lin
gers crossed), I can't help but feel
that this journey is going to end up

with me alone and miserable, teach
ing Physics 101 to wannabe farmers
in the middle of nowhere.
You see, I, like most folk who
enter this game, probably am not
good enough to succeed. The people
that make it through the academic
assault course to tenure are really
damn smart. They kinda scare me
with their general smartness, hard
work, superhuman stamina, etc.
I am not smart, hard working or
superhuman. In fact, I fully expect
to fail. I go to sleep dreaming of
greatness, but with the sure knowl
edge that it is poorly-paid, ill
respected mediocrity that awaits me
in reality.
So, why bother? Why stick with
it? It's not like there aren't any
other options? What's more, those
other options are better-paid, less
stressful and more likely to afford
you a social life. You know what
typical back-up careers are for my
peers? Finance or Google.
Let's think about that for a sec:
We choose to continue being miser
able, despite the fact that, should we

choose, we stand a better chance of
being ridiculously wealthy or work
ing for THE free food company
(and you know how we feel about
free food).
Well, it's like the man said: You
just keep hoping she's gonna put
out. You can't let go, because if you
do the O.(KKKK) 1 percent chance of
success hits zero proper. You're fol
lowing your dream. It may be miser
able. Each day might feel like walk
ing on razor blades. Each failure
might seem like a poke in the eye
with a blunt pencil. But tomorrow,
tomorrow you could Figure It Out.
You know, one day you could just
Get It. For every story of a child
genius, there are a dozen more
about someone who was mediocre
until they were halfway through a
postdoc in Alaska or until they hit
junior faculty status at some third
tier college.
If it ever happened, I'd stick with
that chaste supermodel for a hell of
long time. In fact, given the smallest
possible chance of success, I'd be
like a damn barnacle. Hope, for all
its mislea Jing tendencies, is still the
greatest urug on Earth.

I'm off to Burning Man today.
Surrounded by hippies for days. Wish
me luck at navins@stanford.edu.
