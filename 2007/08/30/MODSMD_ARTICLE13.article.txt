## Munger construction irks students 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS 
Bulldozers will continue to buzz around
campus this fall as construction chugs
along on the Munger residential complex
and the underground Wilbur Field parking
structure. While the parking garage is
expected to be completed later this acade
mic year, students will have to wait until
2(X)9 for the opening of the Munger com
plexâ€” construction delays have pushed
ixick the project's start date.
The Munger housing project will pro
vide 358 residential units for 600 graduate
students. The four-level Wilbur Field
underground parking structure will
include 1,187 parking stalls and is sched
uled to open in March 2008.
Construction on the sites began in
February 2006 but experienced setbacks
early in the process.

"Start of construction was delayed
about eight months to allow for a better
bidding environment for the project's buy
out and to accommodate the availability
of major subcontractors," said Jack
Cleary, associate vice president of Land,
Buildings and Real Estate.
Cleary said that several associated pro
jects were completed during this delay
time to help streamline the construction
of the actual residential complex, such as
the realignment of Campus Drive and the
relocation and renovation of the five his
torical houses that previously lined
Salvatierra Walk.
As the Munger and Wilbur field con
struction gets further off the ground, stu
dents may be woken by the noise as early
as 7 a.m. during the upcoming school year:
Santa Clara County officials have
approved general construction hours from

then until 7 p.m., Monday through
Saturday. Noise reduction devices, con
struction timing and other mitigation mea
sures have been implemented to minimize
noise disturbance.
Some students nevertheless worry
about the impact that the construction wiil
have on their residential experiences.
Rebecca Perez 'OS will serve next year
as an ethnic theme associate in Casa
Zapata, which is adjacent to the Munger
construction site. She lived in Casa Zapata
during her sophomore year when the
University began to relocate the houses
lining Salvatierra Walk.
"When 1 left Zapata at the end of my
sophomore year, I would sometimes get
awoken by the construction," Perez said.
"But it wasn't that big of a deal because I
