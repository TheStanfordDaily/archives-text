## Dartmouth decision prompts Board review 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS 
Dartmouth College has made national
news with its hotly debated plan to revise
its Board (if Trustee election process,
sparking dialogue in schools across the
country about the proper role for alumni
in university governance.
Alumni Association President Howard
Wolf 'SO told The Daily that the Stanford
Board of Trustees member selections are
set up in such a manner that the
University will escape a similar controver
sy.
Dartmouth's Board of Trustees has
instructed a new governance committee to
review the composition of the board and
its selection process. Of the 16 trustees
who are Dartmouth alumni, half are elect
ed directly by the college's alumni and
confirmed by the full board.
In a letter to Dartmouth's alumni,
incoming Chair of the Board of Trustees
lid Haldeman wrote that several alumni

expressed concern that the 116-year-old
tradition "has become increasingly politi
cized and taken on many of the trappings
of a modern political campaign." Open
campaigning in the last board election
brought over $ 1 ()(),()()() into the race,
according to The Dartmouth, the college's
student newspaper.
Alumni dissatisfied with the pending
end to the Trustee campaigns have
formed the Committee to Save
Dartmouth College, which has circulated
a petition among alumni opposing the
change in the trustee selection process.
The committee recently purchased a full
page advertisement in The New York
Times that ran last Tuesday, calling on
alumni to "act now to save democracy at
Dartmouth."
At Stanford, eight of about 35 Trustees
are selected through a committee process
administered by the Stanford Alumni
Association. The association's board of
directors appoints an Alumni Committee

on Trustee Nomination that solicits nomi
nations from among alumni, reviews
applications, conducts interviews and rec
ommends candidates for acceptance to the
lull Board of Trustees. The committee
typically receives hundreds of applications
from alumni interested in serving.
"Unlike normal processes on boards
where you don't even know you are being
considered until being asked to serve, we
actually reach out to the alumni body and
ask alumni to submit applications express
ing interest in serving on the board," Wolf
said. "It's a very long, very involved com
mittee-driven process that yields candi
dates who can serve the University at the
highest level."
Wolf said that Stanford formerly had an
election process that was discontinued
because of a tremendous decline in alumni
voting and in the quality of candidates will
ing to compete publicly for these positions.
