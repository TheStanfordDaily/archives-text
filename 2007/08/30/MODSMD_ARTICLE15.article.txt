## Faculty campaign donations on rise 
### MELODY DYE 
Newly released data reveals that Stanford affiliates arc
more politically active than many of their peers the
University currently ranks seventh in the amount of pri
vate faculty contributions to 2(X)8 presidential contenders
The faculty contributions go overwhelmingly to candidates
from the Democratic Party.
Over the past 20 years, Stanford has consistently ranked
in the top 15 universities with faculty making federal cam
paign contributions, according to an analysis of federal
campaign contributions done by the nonpartisan ( enter
for Responsive Politics (CRP). Stanford has often placed
among the top five universities.
The CRP measures donations of all Stanford affiliates
— from high-level administrators to students, professors
and staff. Because the CRP only records donations of more
than $2(X), older affiliates tend to be the most highh repre
sented.
In the 2(XX) presidential election, Stanford ranked third
with contributions totaling nearly $500,000, two-thirds <>l
which went toward Democratic candidates. Stanford was
fourth in the 2(X)4 presidential campaign, with in
donations. An overwhelming 92 percent of contributions in
2(X)4 went to Democratic candidates.
So far, contributions from Stanford affiliates for the
2(X)8 presidential campaigns total just under $1(H),(KX)
More than 1 (X) Stanford affiliates have made donations u
presidential campaigns thus far, and 89 percent of the
money has gone to Democratic contenders. Sen Barak
Obama (D-1L) has received nearly 40 percent of the con
tributions, while Sen. Hilary Clinton (D-NY) has garnered
about 25 percent.
But Stanford's professors are not alone in their political
activism.
Obama has received nearly $1.5 million in contributions
from academia, while Clinton has received $940,(XX1. Not;
single Republican candidate has broken the $S(X).(XH
mark. Seventy-six percent of the industry's federal contri
butions this cycle have gone to Democratic candidates.
Education ranked eighth among industry donors in the
2(X)4 election cycle and ranks 16th in the current camp aim
season.
Academia was not always so influential. A decade ago
total campaign contributions from universities hoverec
around $7 million per election cycle. That changed in 2(XK)
when contributions more than doubled to $17 million, lr
2(X)4, contributions more than doubled again, coming in al
$38 million.
That year, University of California system affiliates con
tributed more to John Kerry's campaign than any othei
single employer nationally, donating more than double tin
amount given by Kerry's largest corporate donor.
Luke Rosiak, a researcher at the CRP. suggested thai
widespread opposition to President George W. Bush ha 4
galvanized political activism among academics.
"The amount of money people [in general] are spend
ing to influence politics has certainly increased over time
but there's definitely something else going on here."
Rosiak said. "You don't need to be an expert in campaigi
finance to see that there was just an astronomical jump ir
political giving among academics in 2004."
After all. college campuses have long been known loi
their liberal politics.
"It hasn't surprised anyone who these academics are
giving to — what's surprising is how much they're giving.
Rosiak said.
This new level of activism has alarmed conservatives
leading some to suggest that liberal partisanship amotn
academics compromises the academic credibility of theii
institutions by polarizing and politicizing university cam
puses. Conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly said a'
much on a recent show, citing Rosiak's analysis of the edu
cation industry.
Rosiak said he didn't know if he agreed that investing it
political campaigns jeopardized academic neutrality. Ihi
bottom line, he said, was that professors "do have a right tc
participate in the democratic process."
Dr. William Dement, a professor of psychiatry a
Stanford, agreed.
"University faculty tend to be more politically awart
than a lot of groups and a little more
well-informed," he said. "Until the
state pays for elections, the candi
dates need to raise an enormous
amount of money to be successful.
My contribution is only the tiniest lit
tle drop in the bucket."
