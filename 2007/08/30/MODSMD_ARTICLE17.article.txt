## STANFORD FOOTBALL Football opens season with UCLA New coach Jim Harbaugh lends Card into 2007 campaign with "enthusiasm unknown to mankind"

In 2(K)fi, Stanford football saw its
first year of action in a gorgeous
new stadium, led by a veteran
coach, a highly touted senior quar
terback and a team that had just
barely missed out on bowl-game eli
gibility in 2(X)5. Largely because the
Cardinal still has yet to earn a single
victory in its sparkling new home
venue, the 2(K)7 season will open
with a Stanford team now led by
Jim Harbaugh in his first year as a
Division 1-A head coach.
As a new era dawns for Stanford
football, the Cardinal hopes to take
another step forward and wash
away the stench of an abysmal 1-11
2(XKi season by notching a win over
a nationally ranked. Pacific-10
Conference opponent.
No. 14 UCLA was 7-6 last sea
son and will come into Stanford
Stadium looking to get its season off
to a rollicking start, and recent his
tory is certainly on its side. The
Bruins crushed the Cardinal in a 31-
0 romp at the Rose Bowl last year.
Indeed, Stanford is winlcss in its last
three matchups with UCLA, and
has been shut out twice over that
span.

NOTES: UCLA leads 43-31-3.
Stanford opens its 113th season
of intercollegiate football when it
plays host to UCLA on Saturday.
Stanford is coming off a 1-11
season in 2006 while the Bruins
went 7-6 and advanced to the
Emerald Bowl. UCLA returns a
Pac-10 leading 21 starters,
including 10 on offense and 10
on defense, from a team that
ranked second in the conference
in total defense.

For Stanford fans, the contcst offers more than just the chance to
see the Cardinal square off against a solid opponent for its season
opener; it also marks I larbaugh's Pac-10 coaching debut, after leading
the University of San Diego to a 29-6 record over the past three sea
sons.
To be sure, it's a big moment for the coach whose Stanford career
has so far been marked more by his comments on Southern California
coach Pete Carroll and the standards to which Michigan's student ath
letes are held. Now is the time for the refreshingly straightforward
coach to demonstrate what unbridled enthusiasm can do for a team
that finished at the bottom oi the Pac-10 just one year ago.
"I know that they're going to play hard," Harbaugh said. "It's so
different from any other sport. College football has no preseason, no
exhibition season. Going into an opener in college football, you don't
know exactly where you are. That's why the opener's always so big

each year — we'll know where we're
at after that opener."
Harbaugh seemed confident in his
quarterbacking situation heading
into Saturday, as senior T.C.
Ostrander will finally be handed the
reigns of the Stanford attack in his
fifth year with the program.
"He's been the guy that's been
respected by all of his teammates and
all of the coaches since early on,"
Harbaugh said of his fifth-year quar
terback. "Just in the way that he pre
pares, the way that he works, the
time that he devotes to the game and
his performance level, he — like
many of the seniors — reflects a
group of guys that are tired of getting
their butts kicked. They want to
make a statement in their final go
around here at Stanford."
The Cardinal rushing attack
would also appear to be in good
hands heading into the season, as
Harbaugh said he considers both
junior Anthony Kimble and sopho
more Toby Gerhart to be starters
and has lauded the work of true
freshman fullback Owen Marecic in
camp.
But most of all, Saturday should
be an intriguing first test to see just
how well Harbaugh s promised level
of "enthusiasm unknown to
mankind" will stack up against the
Bruins' talented roster, which
includes 20 returning starters on
offense and defense. The UCLA
defense, headlined by the nation's
top returning sack-artist — senior
defensive end Bruce Davis — should
pose a significant challenge to a

Stanford offense still adapting to
Harbaugh's system.
1 iarbaugh had plenty of praise on
Tuesday for Davis and head coach
Karl Dorrell's highly touted defen
sive unit.
"That extremely fast, quick
speed-rusher is a guy that can have a
tremendous impact on the football
game," Harbaugh said of Davis. "He
was the sack leader in the country
last year. He's a tremendous football
player and we've got great respect
for him."
"I mean they are solid,"
Harbaugh later added. "This is a
legitimate big-time defense; there's
no question about it."
On the offensive side of the ball,
UCLA's approach is much more
uncertain heading into Saturday's
contest. The Bruins' first-year offen
sive coordinator, Jay Norvell, was a
protege of Bill Callahan at Nebraska
and a colleague of Harbaugh with
the NFL's Oakland Raiders; he is
expected to run a West Coast style of
offense with UCLA. The new Bruins
offense will be coping with a retooled
Stanford defense that is switching to
the 4-3 scheme under new defensive
coordinator Scott Shafer. Shafer's
defense at Western Michigan was the
llth-ranked unit in the country for
2006.
The Cardinal hosts UCLA
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Kickoff is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.
and the game will be broadcast
nationally on Fox Sports Net. The
game is the first of four straight home
competitions to open the Cardinal's
2007 season.
