## STANFORD FOOTBALL Football opens season with UCLA New coach Jim Harbaugh lends Card into 2007 campaign with "enthusiasm unknown to mankind"

In 2(K)fi, Stanford football saw its
first year of action in a gorgeous
new stadium, led by a veteran
coach, a highly touted senior quar
terback and a team that had just
barely missed out on bowl-game eli
gibility in 2(X)5. Largely because the
Cardinal still has yet to earn a single
victory in its sparkling new home
venue, the 2(K)7 season will open
with a Stanford team now led by
Jim Harbaugh in his first year as a
Division 1-A head coach.
As a new era dawns for Stanford
football, the Cardinal hopes to take
another step forward and wash
away the stench of an abysmal 1-11
2(XKi season by notching a win over
a nationally ranked. Pacific-10
Conference opponent.
No. 14 UCLA was 7-6 last sea
son and will come into Stanford
Stadium looking to get its season off
to a rollicking start, and recent his
tory is certainly on its side. The
Bruins crushed the Cardinal in a 31-
0 romp at the Rose Bowl last year.
Indeed, Stanford is winlcss in its last
three matchups with UCLA, and
has been shut out twice over that
span.

NOTES: UCLA leads 43-31-3.
Stanford opens its 113th season
of intercollegiate football when it
plays host to UCLA on Saturday.
Stanford is coming off a 1-11
season in 2006 while the Bruins
went 7-6 and advanced to the
Emerald Bowl. UCLA returns a
Pac-10 leading 21 starters,
including 10 on offense and 10
on defense, from a team that
ranked second in the conference
in total defense.

For Stanford fans, the contcst offers more than just the chance to
see the Cardinal square off against a solid opponent for its season
opener; it also marks I larbaugh's Pac-10 coaching debut, after leading
the University of San Diego to a 29-6 record over the past three sea
sons.
To be sure, it's a big moment for the coach whose Stanford career
has so far been marked more by his comments on Southern California
coach Pete Carroll and the standards to which Michigan's student ath
letes are held. Now is the time for the refreshingly straightforward
coach to demonstrate what unbridled enthusiasm can do for a team
that finished at the bottom oi the Pac-10 just one year ago.
"I know that they're going to play hard," Harbaugh said. "It's so
different from any other sport. College football has no preseason, no
exhibition season. Going into an opener in college football, you don't
know exactly where you are. That's why the opener's always so big
