# STANFORD FOOTBALL
## Questions abound for 2007 Cardinal squad 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
Cardinal football kicks off its 2(H)7 season on
Saturday, with its third head coach since Tyrone
Willingham left the program after the 2(K)1 sea
son. Five years is an eternity in modern college
football, and in that time the program has hit a
serious blight: a 16-40 record.
The pieces appear to be aligning, however, to
turn the ship around.
The (Juartcrhack-turncd-Coach
The latest in a family of coaches, new head
coach Jim Harbaugh comes to Stanford after a

short but complete search by athletic director
Bob Bowlsby. Harbaugh compiled a 29-6 record
at the University of San Diego, a non-scholar
ship Jesuit college, in his first head coaching
stint.
Harbaugh was the first Michigan quarterback
to make it big in the NFL, and says he carries the
style of late Wolverine coach Bo Schembechler.
He still loves to play the role of the quarterback
being a high-energy leader, jumping in on
drills and making brash statements to the media.
The Offense
Last season, a lack of healthy players doomed
the Cardinal offense; the team only twice scored

more than one offensive touchdown last season.
The good news is that there are options for
fifth-year senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander:
junior Anthony Kimble and sophomore Toby
Gerhart form a speed-and-power combination at
tailback. Big tight end James Dray, a sopho
more, is regarded as one of the better talents in
the Pacific-10 Conference at his position. And
the wide receivers show complementary skills —
senior Evan Moore is tall and physically domi
nating, senior Mark Bradford is the skilled tech
nician who can catch in coverage and sophomore
Richard Sherman can make catch-and-run big
plays.
1 he most critical segment of the offense will be
the line. Center Tim Mattran, a senior who missed
the entire 2(X)6 season, anchors a group with tons of
experience but little to show for it. Without running
lanes and pass protection, the new West Coast
offense will falter. Offensive success will require a
lucky streak of good health — Ostrander's backups
are green — and an ability to balance run and pass.
The Defense
The Stanford defensive staff switched from a 3-
4 to a 4-3 alignment, a more conventional college
scheme, in the offseason. While the change increas
es pressure on the inside linebacker and defensive
tackle, the ends are freed to harass quarterbacks.
Backup tight end Erik Lorig, a sophomore, was
moved to defensive end and projects to start oppo
site junior Pannel Egboh. Senior Chris Horn and
sophomore Ekom Udofia anchor the inside of the
line.
Sophomore linebackers Clinton Snyder and
Fred Campbell are young but talented, along with
elders Peter Griffin, a senior, and junior Pat
Maynor.
Meanwhile, depth at defensive back is thin,
causing big concern for the team. After senior Nick
Sanchez, senior Tim Sims and junior Wopamo
Osaisai, cornerback experience is non-existent, and
the safety positions lack bodies. The best news for
the Cardinal defense is that coordinator Scott
Shafer has a track record of being involved in turn
around jobs.
The Kicking Game
Stanford has traditionally shown great attention
to the special teams. That was not the case in 2(X)6,
and the results showed on the field. Kickoff returns
were fumbling adventures, punter Jay Ottovegio
(now a senior) sustained his first blocked punt and
two teams returned blocked field goals for touch
downs.
Senior Brent Newhouse is a blue-chip long snap
per and gunner Osaisai can get downfield and stop
punt returns before they start, as well as return
kickoffs with flair. The placekickers have yet to
earn their stripes, but with extra attention from

coach D.J. Durkin, the Cardinal kicking game
should again be a strength that keeps the team in
ballgames.
The Young Folks
Harbaugh has said that a dozen freshmen could
end up playing this season, depending on injury and
depth constraints. Fullback Owen Marecic has
established himself as a starter in the absence of
Emeka Nnoli. In the event of injury problems,
freshmen receivers may see playing time.
Linebackers Max Bergen and Jonathan Frink
have looked impressive in practice, as has safety-
Taylor Skaufel. Top-flight recruit Kellen
Kiilsgaard, expected to play safety or quarterback,
has swapped positions twice and is now practicing
as a tight end.
The Mash Unit
The injury bug that has hit Stanford football the
past few years has not let up. Projected starting full
back Emeka Nnoli. beset by health problems from
the day he stepped on campus, was dealt a final
blow when he was diagnosed with avascular necro
sis (tissue death) in his hips. He is the third
Stanford player in as many seasons who has had to
retire from football.
Other camp injuries include innumerable ham
strings, a broken hand (sophomore safety Bo
McNally) and a concussion (junior defensive tackle
Gustav Rydstedt).
The Coaches
1 larbaugh has chosen a staff that is for the most
part young, energetic and cohesive - many of them
worked with him at USD. Two Stanford alums
(Chris Dalman and David Shaw) are on the offen
sive staff, and both have coached in the NFL.
The coaching staff appears to relish its role as
teachers of the game, and all have a history of suc
cess.
The Schedule
The Cardinal's docket is once again one of the
toughest in the nation, though it is mitigated by an
eight-game home schedule and all three non-con
ference opponents coming to Palo Alto. The
Cardinal gets a bad break having to go to chilly
