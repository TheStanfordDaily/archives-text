# How good are the Trojans?

WT* here is no question in m\
mind that USC is the best
-1- team in the country and
may be the best team in the history
of college football." — Jim
Harbaugh, during the Pacific-10
Conference's media day on July 26.
In all seriousness, though (since
it's hard to take Jim Harbaugh seri
ously at this point), just how good
are the Trojans going to be this
year?
It's an important question, seeing
as the Pac-10 goes as USC goes. The
rest of the country looks down on
the conference — you don't have to
look any further than LSU head
coach Les Miles, who slighted the
Pac-10 in comparison to the SEC,
despite the fact that the Trojans
have humiliated top SEC teams m
recent years. And oftentimes, the
only way for a conference like the
Pac-10 to get respect is through its
top dog.
As Stanford's very own head
coach said it, the Trojans shouldn't
have any trouble in representing the
conference this year. Many, just like
Harbaugh, believe this to be the best
USC team ever, surpassing the not
so-long-ago heydays of Matt
Leinart, Reggie Bush and Carson
Palmer.
The Trojans return nearly every
one from a squad that made a one
loss Michigan look like a high school
team in last year's Rose Bowl. USC
has never had this many starters
returning, and as always, the recruit
ing cupboard is full with Pete Carroll
running the ship.
The defense is stacked, featuring
three of the best linebackers in the
country: Keith Rivers, Brian
Cushing and Ray Maualuga. You
might remember Maualuga from
last year's USC-UCLA game He
was the guy who nearly beheaded
Bruins quarterback Patrick Cowan
in the fourth quarter, a video clip of
the hit became an immediate
You Tube favorite.
But questions still linger. For
example, many ask, "Is this team too
talented?" And as absurd as that
sounds, they may have a point: A
