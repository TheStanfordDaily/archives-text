# How good are the Trojans?
## 
### 
WT* here is no question in m\
mind that USC is the best
-1- team in the country and
may be the best team in the history
of college football." — Jim
Harbaugh, during the Pacific-10
Conference's media day on July 26.
In all seriousness, though (since
it's hard to take Jim Harbaugh seri
ously at this point), just how good
are the Trojans going to be this
year?
It's an important question, seeing
as the Pac-10 goes as USC goes. The
rest of the country looks down on
the conference — you don't have to
look any further than LSU head
coach Les Miles, who slighted the
Pac-10 in comparison to the SEC,
despite the fact that the Trojans
have humiliated top SEC teams m
recent years. And oftentimes, the
only way for a conference like the
Pac-10 to get respect is through its
top dog.
As Stanford's very own head
coach said it, the Trojans shouldn't
have any trouble in representing the
conference this year. Many, just like
Harbaugh, believe this to be the best
USC team ever, surpassing the not
so-long-ago heydays of Matt
Leinart, Reggie Bush and Carson
Palmer.
The Trojans return nearly every
one from a squad that made a one
loss Michigan look like a high school
team in last year's Rose Bowl. USC
has never had this many starters
returning, and as always, the recruit
ing cupboard is full with Pete Carroll
running the ship.
The defense is stacked, featuring
three of the best linebackers in the
country: Keith Rivers, Brian
Cushing and Ray Maualuga. You
might remember Maualuga from
last year's USC-UCLA game He
was the guy who nearly beheaded
Bruins quarterback Patrick Cowan
in the fourth quarter, a video clip of
the hit became an immediate
You Tube favorite.
But questions still linger. For
example, many ask, "Is this team too
talented?" And as absurd as that
sounds, they may have a point: A

scarce for many top prospects, and it
could cause dissension among the
players.
Other things are up in the air,
such as which USC receiver will
emerge as the go-to-guy after the
program lost standouts Steve Smith
and Dwavne Jarrett last year. There
was no question as to who the play
makers were among past USC
champions. On this team, however,
it's much less clear. Many arc
expecting big things from junior
wide receiver Patrick Turner and
the stable of nine — yes, nine —
running backs that USC features,
but it remains to be seen who will
step up at the skill positions.
Yet the biggest question of all
comes down to a quarterback fea
turing a both biblical, yet bodily
name: John David Booty.
This is supposed to be the year
for the redshirt senior, a top high
school prospect who was forced to
sit and watch under the Leinart
reign. Booty stepped up as the
starter last year, and at times he
showed why he was so highly
regarded out of high school, with
monster performances rivaling
those of Leinart's past.
However, in the few close games
the Trojans actually played. Booty
didn't exude the confidence nor
charisma that most champion quar
terbacks possess.
He was rattled bv the crowd

against Oregon State, as the Trojans
lost on a missed two-point conver
sion, and he was shaken up by the
swarming pressure of UCLA's
defense in the Trojans' 13-9 loss.
Both games ended on Booty mis
takes: The Beavers took down the
Trojans after Booty forced an
impossible throw to stud receiver
Dwayne Jarrett and the Bruins
sealed victory after Booty was acro
batically intercepted by backup line
backer Eric McNeal.
Booty has had his share of critics
during his time thus far at USC. This
is supposedly his year, his team and
his title to win (or lose). But from an
onlooker's perspective, something
tells me that he just doesn't have the
right stuff.
While Matt Leinart had the
moxie to throw deep on fourth and
10 from his own 19 — and with a
season on the line — Booty seems
much less resolute. While Leinart
had no problem in calling his own
number for a OB sneak in USC's
2005 win against Notre Dame (a
field goal would have tied the
game), Booty would probably defer
to the coach.
That may be speculative and it
may be unfair, but in what I've seem
from Booty, it's the conclusion I've
come to. Soon enough he'll have his
chance to prove the haters—-and
Les Miles — wrong.

Jack Salisbury had the strength not to
make a single "Booty" pun in this entire
column. To congratulate, contact him at
