## Spikers down Long Beach Freshmen contribute in Cardinal's easy threegame sweep of 49ers 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
They may be new to Stanford,
but the freshmen on the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team
are veterans of the game. On
Saturday, three rookies helped their
team to a three-game sweep of No.
19 Long Beach State in the
Cardinal's season opener.
Junior outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza, a Long Beach native,
returned to her hometown for the
first time in a Stanford jersey and
spearheaded the Cardinal attack,
while two freshmen hailing from
Southern California — Alix
Klineman and Cassidy Lichtman
started their collegiate careers in
front of friends and family as well.
Junior libero Jessica Fishburn is also
from the Los Angeles area.
Returning from USA National
Team duty over the summer,
Barboza and junior middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo led the team's
offense, with senior setter Bryn
Kehoe at the helm. The trio, all
returning Ail-Americans, were ably
supported by three newcomers: out
side hitter Klineman, right-side hit
ter Lichtman and defensive special

ist Gabi Ailes.
Though stepping into the major
hole left by the graduation of four
seniors who played in three Final
Fours and won the Cardinal a cham
pionship, the freshmen did not miss
a beat. They will surely make their
presence felt as Stanford — ranked
behind only defending national
champion Nebraska — looks for
ward to December's Final Four in
Sacramento. This past weekend's
sweep of the 49ers was a good first
step toward that goal.
Long Beach State came out firing
in the first game, but missed its first
two serves to keep the score close.
The 49ers built a slim lead, which
they managed to hold until the mid
way point of the game, when
Stanford finally tied the score and
built a lead on a seven-point service
run by Akinradewo. Stanford put
the game away, 30-26, on a miss by
the 49ers.
Long Beach again took the first
point in the second game, but the
Cardinal quickly jumped out in
front. Trailing by only three at 12-9,
Long Beach fell back down the
stretch and the Cardinal pushed its
lead into double digits. Long Beach
battled back and held off several
game points, but Stanford sealed the
30-19 win on a tip by senior middle
blocker Franci Girard.
For the third time in a row, the
49ers scored first in the final game.
Neither team could build a lead

larger than two points thereafter,
until Stanford finally pulled away to
win by three. In the closest finish of
the match, Stanford finally clinched
the win on a missed Long Beach
serve.
Barboza led Stanford's offensive
charge with IK kills on the evening at
a .4N4 clip. She also tied with Kehoe
with a team-high 10 digs. Kehoe
dished out 45 assists with the team
hitting .427 overall.
The Stanford middle attack was
perfect — Akinradewo and Girard
hit error-free with 10 and nine kills,
respectively. Klineman and
Lichtman chipped in seven and six
kills, respectively.
Last year's Big West Co-Player
of the Year Alexis Crimes had 20
kills for Long Beach, but also gar
nered nine errors. Quincy Verdin
hit a team-high .542 with 15 kills for
the 49ers, while Long Beach libero
Talaya Whitford notched a match
high 14 digs. After dropping both
matches on the weekend, the 49ers
fell to No. 24 in Monday's poll.
The Cardinal will play on the
road once again next weekend at
the Diet Coke Classic in
Minneapolis, Friday through
Sunday. The Stanford women first
meet No. 12 San Diego, then host
No. 9 Minnesota and finally No. 23
Ohio.
