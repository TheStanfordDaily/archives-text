## MEN'S GOLF Kim excels at US Amateur Incoming freshman advances to round of 16, loses in 19 holes 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Incoming freshman golfer Sihwan Kim
proved his mettle and made the Cardinal
proud in last week's U.S. Amateur tourna
ment. After making his way through two
tedious rounds of stroke play and two com
petitors in match play to make it to the tour
nament's final 16, Kim fell to UNLV's Kddie
()lson.
The Stanford newcomer outlasted a cou
ple of his future teammates on the Lakeside
and Ocean Courses of San Francisco's
Olympic Club. Junior Daniel Lim failed to
make it past the stroke play cut, while sopho
more Joseph Bramlett lost in the first round
of match play.
Kim beat Norway's Marius Thorp 1-up in
the first round and dispatched Trevor
Murphy easily in the second round, winning
4 and 2.
Playing for a spot in the quarterfinals,
Kim lost to Olson in 19 holes in the closest
match of the round of 16.
Kim and Olson were not strangers going

into the match: Kim eliminated Olson earlier
this summer at the 2007 California State
Amateur tournament. History seemed to be
repeating itself last week as Kim took a 2-up
lead through four holes. The soon-to-be
Stanford freshman maintained a lead until
the 12th hole, when he hit a tree with his tee
shot and Olson tied the match.
The two were tied after regulation and
went to the par-5 first hole to determine the
winner in a sudden death playoff. Olson
made an eight-foot birdie putt on the first
playoff hole to secure the victory and send
Kim packing.
