The Stanford men's soccer team begins
its 2007 season tomorrow night with a
match-up against the defending NCAA
champions, No. 1 UC-Santa Barbara.

The Cardinal meets the Gauchos in
UCSB's first official game since defeating
UCLA in the 2006 College Cup final.
Stanford just barely failed to qualify for the
NCAA tournament, despite beating archri
val No. 10 California 2-1 in overtime on the
last day of the regular season. The Cardinal
went 7-7-4 in 2006, beating two ranked
opponents (Cal and Oregon) and tying
national runner-up UCLA twice on the sea
son.
Stanford coach Bret Simon used 10 of
the same players in his starting lineup in
two exhibition matches this past week.
Redshirt senior Andrew Kartunen will
probably start in goal after missing the
entire 2006 season, while junior Tim Jones
and senior Scott Bolkan were constants in
preseason defense. Senior Dan Shapiro and
sophomore Thiago Sa Friere look set to
start at forward after getting the nod in both
exhibition games.
The Cardinal's leading goal-scorer from
last season, senior Evan Morgan (five
goals), came off the bench in both exhibition
contests as well. Morgan started in 17 of
Stanford's IK games last season.
Midfielder Bobby Warshaw is the only
member of Stanford's freshman class —
rated ninth in the country by College Soccer
News — to nail down a starting spot in pre
season. although others among the talented
nine-member class are assured of significant
playing time this year.
In the two exhibition contests this past
week, the Cardinal lost 1-0 to Denver before
balancing its preseason account by crushing
Sacramento State 5-1. Freshmen Warshaw

and Daniel Leon, sophomores Michael
Strickland and Brant Bishop and senior
Scott Bolkan scored tor the Cardinal.
UCSB won ils lone preseason match
against Westmont by a 2-0 margin. The
Gauchos visit Maloney Field for a 7 p.m.
match tomorrow night.
