# Daniel's TOP 205

### 
We're back for Year Two, baby. Unlike the other polls, this one controls for dif
ferences in schedule and ranks on actual strength. Teams aren't ranked
based on their win-loss records, but on whether they could beat the team ranked
below them.
1 Is the Trojans' D the best ever? An entire two
deep could start on Sundays soon.
2 Cakewalk road slate, too: the Mississippis,
Kentucky and Alabama.
3 OKLAHOMA The o line needs to get healthy, but the
Sooners' secondary is the nation's best.
4 EX AS Defense is down, but QB McCoy, RB Charles
and star WR Sweed are back.
5 The Big Four (QB Henne, RB Hart, WR
Manningham, OT Long) are back, but the back
seven are a big Q.
6 0 STATE Only LB Laurinaitis returns, and recruiting class
es have been sick.
7 WES! VIRGINIA Best odds for the title, save USC, but teams
ranked 2-6 would crush them by 20.
8 Ditto. QB Brohm, LB Williams from Miami
should roll through the weak Big East.
9 UCLA Crazy pick No. 1. 20 starters returning, and the
D should be great. Biggest Q is Coach Dorrell.
10 Old-school football (LBs Hall and Abidi are
ACCs best) in an emotional year.
11 FLORIDA STATE Back from the dead? D line could be the
nation's best; new staff could revamp the O.
12 1 1 CAROLINA Crazy pick No. 2. Might only win eight in the
SEC, but Spurrier will win big games with his D.
13 FLORIDA Lost four to the NFL â€”in the first round! Only
two D starters are back, but recruits are near
USC-level.
14 Michigan, Fresno State and Cal all in
September. RB Stewart could top the USC sta
ble.
15 ALABAMA Their QB would be named John Parker Wilson.
O nothing special, so season rests on the D.
16 MIAMI Seventh floor crew might not hit seven wins,
with @ Oklahoma, Texas A&M, @ FSU and VT.
17 CALIFORNIA Tedford's teams win by stuffing the run. Only
five back (two of front seven) on D.
18 Laughing? You won't be on Oct. 14. The O is
just okay, but the D would be among the Pac
10's best.
19 Eight return on the O, and back seven is great.
Q's are QB Morelli and a young D line.
20 Just four back on D, one in front seven. O is
good enough to carry for a while.
21 RB Lane (274 lbs) and four O linemen return
after 207 rush yards per game last year.
22 HAWAII No. 10 in my results (vs. power) poll, because
12-0 and BCS as likely as not in WAC.
23 TENNESSEE Fulmer's killing the program. No creativity on
O? Another four-loss season? Double check.
24 1 -2 punch of QB Teel, RB Rice back, but the
stars won't align like last year.
25 WISCONSIN I'm not buying the hype. lowa (duck Michigan
and OSU) will post a better record.
