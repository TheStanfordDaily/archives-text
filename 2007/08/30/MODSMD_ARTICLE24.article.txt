We're back for Year Two, baby. Unlike the other polls, this one controls for dif
ferences in schedule and ranks on actual strength. Teams aren't ranked
based on their win-loss records, but on whether they could beat the team ranked
below them.
1 Is the Trojans' D the best ever? An entire two
deep could start on Sundays soon.
2 Cakewalk road slate, too: the Mississippis,
Kentucky and Alabama.
3 OKLAHOMA The o line needs to get healthy, but the
Sooners' secondary is the nation's best.
4 EX AS Defense is down, but QB McCoy, RB Charles
and star WR Sweed are back.
5 The Big Four (QB Henne, RB Hart, WR
Manningham, OT Long) are back, but the back
seven are a big Q.
6 0 STATE Only LB Laurinaitis returns, and recruiting class
es have been sick.
7 WES! VIRGINIA Best odds for the title, save USC, but teams
ranked 2-6 would crush them by 20.
8 Ditto. QB Brohm, LB Williams from Miami
should roll through the weak Big East.
9 UCLA Crazy pick No. 1. 20 starters returning, and the
D should be great. Biggest Q is Coach Dorrell.
10 Old-school football (LBs Hall and Abidi are
ACCs best) in an emotional year.
11 FLORIDA STATE Back from the dead? D line could be the
nation's best; new staff could revamp the O.
12 1 1 CAROLINA Crazy pick No. 2. Might only win eight in the
SEC, but Spurrier will win big games with his D.
13 FLORIDA Lost four to the NFL —in the first round! Only
two D starters are back, but recruits are near
USC-level.
14 Michigan, Fresno State and Cal all in
September. RB Stewart could top the USC sta
ble.
15 ALABAMA Their QB would be named John Parker Wilson.
O nothing special, so season rests on the D.
16 MIAMI Seventh floor crew might not hit seven wins,
with @ Oklahoma, Texas A&M, @ FSU and VT.
17 CALIFORNIA Tedford's teams win by stuffing the run. Only
five back (two of front seven) on D.
18 Laughing? You won't be on Oct. 14. The O is
just okay, but the D would be among the Pac
10's best.
19 Eight return on the O, and back seven is great.
Q's are QB Morelli and a young D line.
20 Just four back on D, one in front seven. O is
good enough to carry for a while.
21 RB Lane (274 lbs) and four O linemen return
after 207 rush yards per game last year.
22 HAWAII No. 10 in my results (vs. power) poll, because
12-0 and BCS as likely as not in WAC.
23 TENNESSEE Fulmer's killing the program. No creativity on
O? Another four-loss season? Double check.
24 1 -2 punch of QB Teel, RB Rice back, but the
stars won't align like last year.
25 WISCONSIN I'm not buying the hype. lowa (duck Michigan
and OSU) will post a better record.

Washington State in November, hut
of its four road trips, Stanford won
at three of the four road sites
(WSU. Arizona and Oregon State)
two seasons ago.
Non-conference opponents San
Jose State and Texas Christian are
no joke — the I lorned Frogs from
Fort Worth are a legitimate "BCS
busier" threat and the Spartans
have taken a number of high-profile
contests from the Cardinal.
Big Game against Cal is now on
Dec. 1. rather than rivalry weekend,
and follows a Thanksgiving week
end lilt against Notre Dame. The
schedule change could prevent a
post-Big Game letdown loss in the
event the Cardinal keeps the Bears
from winning their sixth straight
game in the rivalry.
This Saturday, the Cardinal
opens with talented but historically
inconsistent UCLA, who defeated
USC last season but also got wiped
off the field by several less-talented
opponents. The Bruins have
received a lot of national hype for
being a No. 14 team — UCLA over-

confidence could be a setup for a
"trap" game. They might he too
shocked to recover if Stanford
pounces on a lead.
Between repeatedly firing coor
dinators. preparing his team poorly
and hosing the paperwork of a star
recruit, head coach Karl Dorrell is
on the hot seat in the eyes of Bruin
fans. The pressure is on the oppo
nent in Stanford's home-opener.
The Final Word
Following a 1-11 season, there's
nowhere to go but up. However,
between injuries, depth and a tough
schedule, the team could be much
improved and still count its wins on
one hand. With the history and
obstacles, a three-win season should
be considered a success —if the
Cardinal ends up bowl-eligible (six
wins or more), Harbaugh should be
named Pac-1() Coach of the Year.
With the change in attitude and
scheme and improved athletic
department support, fans should
expect a more viewable football
experience. With student tickets
completely free this year, Stanford
students will be front and center for
a program on the upswing.
