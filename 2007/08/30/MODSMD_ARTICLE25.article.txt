## Harbaugh brings brash talk, high energy to Farm 
### JOSH DUBOW THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Jim
Harbaugh has challenged some of
college football's biggest power
houses before he's even coached his
first game at Stanford.
Whether it's reviewing arch rival
California's graduation rates, the
academic standards at his own alma
mater Michigan, or speculating that
Southern California coach Pete
Carroll is ready to leave for the
NFL, Harbaugh has shown no fear
of any opponent.
"I really just say what I think,"
Harbaugh said. "I tend to be frank."
Harbaugh's bold pronouncements
and outspoken comments are a far
cry from previous coaches Walt
Harris and Buddy Teevens. While
talk alone won't rebuild a program
that was foundering when I larbaugh
replaced Harris last December fol
lowing a 1-11 season, it has made
Stanford relevant after years of
being overlooked.
It's a change that is welcomed by
players who had grown tired of
being beat up on the field and
ignored off it.
"It's fun having a coach who is so
enthusiastic," defensive lineman
Udeme Udofia said. "It's good to
have a coach say we're trying to beat
you. It's different but we welcomed
it. It shows the coaches believe in us
and what we're trying to do."
Whether that brash style will lead
to a more competitive season on the
field for Stanford is an open ques
tion. Stanford set a school record for
losses last season and has won just
16 games the past five seasons under
Harris and Teevens.

Tyrone Willingham and Bill
Walsh are the only coaches in the
last 30 years to put together consec
utive winning seasons at Stanford, a
feat Harbaugh is hoping to repeat.
"Our only goal is to win,"
1 larbaugh said. "We have objectives
and when you hit those objectives,
those are the things that build your
poise and confidence and pride in
yourself, your teammates and the
team. There are objectives that can
be hit. We've already seen one,
which was getting this team in shape.
But the only goal is to win."
Harbaugh arrived at Stanford
with the pedigree of a winner,
whether it was as a star in college at
Michigan, as "Captain Comeback"
during his 15-year NFL career or in
his three seasons at non-scholarship
Division I-AA San Diego, where he
posted a 29-6 record.
Even though he is now 43, that
competitive spirit evidenced by side
line shoutdowns he had as a player
with former Chicago Bears coach
Mike Ditka shows up every day on
the practice field.
Whether it's trash-talking defen
sive players and coaches after the
offense wins a drill or jumping into a
drill to throw a pass or take a hit
from a defensive player, Harbaugh
goes about practice as if he's still a
player.
"I swear he still wishes he was
playing," receiver Evan Moore said.
"1 le loves to demonstrate. That's his
favorite thing to do. When he
demonstrates you get the idea that
he's doing it just to go through the
motions again to get that feeling. It's
obvious that he loves the game of
football and he wishes he was still
playing."
