# SUMMER ACTIVITIES
## SUMMER ACTIVITIES Top ten things to do before summer is over vs. Things NOT to do before summer's over 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION DEAR ABBY KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION DEAR CRABBY 
1. Read — Many of us embark on summer
with a long list of books we want to read and
return in September with a sad sigh that we
barely got through the first few. Do yourself a
favor and make time around your other sum
mer activities to put a dent in that list — or
start a whole new one. Wander around book
stores and try on a best seller for size. Visit
your public library and comfortably browse
without having to map out jumbles of ridicu
lously long call numbers from the Socrates
card catalog. Revisit an old favorite. Indulge in
a novel you would feel too guilty spending
time on during the school year. Moral of the
story: Read. Extra points if you're outside.
2. Catch fireflies — Ok, does anybody actually
do this? Where I live, the only (lies I can catch
at night are mosquitoes. Mmm, West Nile.
Frolicking into the twilight for fireflies just
seems so darn summery though, so do it if you
can. Double extra points if you read outside by
the light of fireflies.

3. Buy fresh summer produce — Meander
around a farmer's market and sink your teeth
into the sweet deliciousness of summer fruits.
Peaches, nectarines, apricots. Figs.
Strawberries, raspberries, cherries. If you pre
fer your fruit to flirt with each other, bake a
pie or fashion together a fruit salad served
with ice cream.
4. Make popsicles — You know the drill.
Juice, paper cups, popsicle sticks, sticky fin
gers Endless fun and refreshment. Try adding
in some of those fresh fruit slices for a flavor

SLEEP—Enough said.

5 1/2 . Sel up a tent in your backyard and sleep
in it — I his is a more festive approach to num
ber live— you can tell people you went
camping when, in reality, you were just drool
ing in a slumber two feet away from your front
door.

6. (io see a film — Catch a summer block
buster or one of those sleeper hits as they were
meant to be seen on the big screen. While the
ater tickets can be ridiculously pricey, there's
just something magical about going to the cin
ema. Hunching over your burning laptop in
Green's Media and Microtext dungeon just
doesn't feel the same.
7. Hit the beach — Summer isn't summer
without getting some sand in your toes, nurs
ing whatever body part you accidentally forgot
to put sunscreen on and being horrified by the
sight of old European men in Speedos. If you
don't live by water, a kiddie pool and a bag of
sand from your local craft store will do the
trick.
8. Take a road trip — Whether you do it
Kerouac style or go the Britney way on the
"Crossroads," get in your car and go, even if
just for an afternoon. Visit a friend who has
already started school or just drive until you
find a reason to stop. This can prove incredibly
cathartic, unless if you live in L.A., in which
case, just stay home and play with Map Quest
for awhile.
9. Make crafts — Remember summer camp
when you'd bring home lots of useless crap
that you proudly fashioned with your own
chubby fingers? Make a lanyard keychain or
try to remember those intricate friendship
bracelet techniques. Better yet, work on pret
ty creations to liven up your room next year.
Decoupage boxes and tissue paper flowers are
all the rage in the designing world right now.
Just try not to eat the paste this time around.
1(1. lie — Just plunk down somewhere with
your homemade popsicle and take a breather
from the MCAT-RESEARCH-INTERN-
S HIP-LS AT-G R E-G RAD SCHOOL
FUTURE-ACHIEVE ACHIEVE
ACHIEVE storm that's been clouding up
your summer. Bring back the summers ol yore
— when all you had to worry about was finish
ing your assigned summer reading book and
cleaning out your trapper keeper before the
first day of school — and let yourself rest there
for awhile.

1. Read your boyfriend's email. Nothing says
trust in a relationship like revealing your all
important email password to a steady beau. If
yours has taken the plunge or you're an adept
password cracker (hint: names of childhood
pets), then he obviously wants you to spend a
few hours a day going through his inbox. Men
hate emotional psychobabble — this way you
can judge his relationship with his mom and
how close is too close to an ex without forcing
him to look up from the game. While you're
at it. be sure to Hag all those ads for "cheep
VlagrC" 1 " as priority correspondence. Gee/,
some guvs can't take a hint.

2. Catch firecrotch. Summer's the perfect time
to make new friends, whether they be grad
students, high school stragglers left over from
EPGY, or the charming clientele at one of
those chic little biker bars in East Palo Alto.
Change your Facebook status to "Whatever I
can get," lather yourself up in baby oil, and
you're off to the races, sparky. In the fall, see
if you can apply your two dollars' worth of
free condoms toward an extra-strength dose
of the HPV vaccination at Vaden.
3. Produce an KP of yo' fresh rhyme/. "Yo I
spin my raps from the bay to Santa Barbara /
I've blown down more fellas than the guys in
Pearl Harbor / Yeah that's a slant rhyme but
if you're picky, son / You can just suck my
Emily Dickenson." Word to vo' advisor.

4) Make prison sangria. You know the drill.
Grape juice, ketchup packets, fruit snacks and
as much Kool Aid mix as you can steal from the
tax evader the next cellblock over. For yeast,
tie a few slices of moldy bread into an old sock.
Let all ingredients ferment in a triple-knotted
I lefty bag for three to seven days or until your
apartment smells like someone gutted a hobo.
5. WEEP. Enough said.

5 1/2. Set up a crying place in your dorm room
and weep in if. All the time. Fill a walk-in
closet with pictures of beloved dead relatives
and all the people who rejected you in high
school. Sil in there reading "Flowers for
Algernon" and just let it all out, buddy. Tears
are Neosporin for emotional ouchies.
6. Film your living will. Sure you're in the
prime of your life now. but the way people
drive on campus, one can't be too cautious.
Make sure your loved ones know who will get
your old IHUM readers and crappy bike in
the event of an emergency. To be extra classy,
post the video on You Tube. Maybe kraaa/.i
-boiB9 thinks "ur toatly gay" now. but who'll
have the last laugh once your account has
been inactive for three months? Not kraaazi
boiB9. He can't count that high.

7. Hit the bottle. They say (hat "mimosa" is
French for "it's never too early to start drink
ing." I say that a tumbler full of vodka at 10
a.m. is American for "screw the aphorisms,
let's get tanked." Helpful hint: buy cheap
low-grade vodka and strain it through a Brita
filter a few times. It doesn't improve the taste,
but do you really care?
8. Take a bad trip. Don't waste your money


THE MAGICAL FRUIT: So this is actually in
Spain ... deal with it.


Zizzzz: Zzzzzzdroolzzzzzzzz,


LET'S ALL GO TO THE MOVIES: And
moke out in the back row.




WEEP: She just found out that she got the fire
crotch ... from her boyfriend's e-mail.


FOPPISH DELIGHT: Drink up me hearties
yo ho.

jclsetting to Cancun this summer.
Strike a deal with one of the seedy
gentlemen prowling 1 laight St.and
\ou can take a trip without ever hav
ing to leave your dorm room. Whoa,
who knew that staring at the carpet
ing could be so, like, enlightening,
man.
l ). lake up "World of Warcraft."
You're an adult, by gum, and
you ve showered enough in your
lite, so why not take up
MMORPGs instead? Games like
VVoW can be just as expensive
and time-consuming as a serious
drug habit and without the fringe
social benefits. But your ex-friends
will all come clamoring back when
ihe\ find out you've become a level
4 I auren Warrior.
10. Be stressed: The MCATs are
100 hard and you're too stupid —
might as well spend every waking
moment of the summer torturing
V'ursell. After all, you only have
lour years here on the most beau
tiful campus in the world, sur
rounded by intelligent and sexy

peers. At the end of their life, no
one ever says, "1 wish I had spent
more time with the people I loved
doing things that made me happy."
They all wish they had taken the
harder calculus class hack when
thev were 19.


DRUNK MOBILE: How do you
think I paid for my rims?
