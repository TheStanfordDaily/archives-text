# BOOK REVIEW
## Three hundred and eighty-four splendid pages 
### EMMA TROTTER INTERMISSION BOOK WORM 
As I devoured Khaled Hosseini's "A Thousand Splendid
Suns" this past weekend. I kept expecting some clever word
play on "suns" and "sons," hut one never materialized. At least
not directly. One of the hook's foremost themes, however, is
the oppression of women, and therefore the superiority of
men. in Afghani society and how this oppression has abruptly
yet cyclically changed over time, from the Soviet occupation to
the period of Taliban rule and post-Taliban recovery. The
book's central characters are women, and although the book
delves deeply into their relationships with their fathers, sons,
husbands and lovers, it is most prominently a striking portrait
of what life has been like for women in Afghanistan for the
past 30 years.
"A Thousand Splendid Suns." released earlier this year,
is Hosseini's second novel and in some ways Hosseini is clear
ly trying to recreate his successful debut novel, "The Kite
Runner," which came out in 2(H)3. It was part of the three
books discussion for freshmen last fall and it was third on the
bestseller list in 2(X)5. Just looking at the two books, you can
see similarities in the fonts, colors and layouts of the two cov
ers.
Both focus on issues in modern Afghanistan, where
I losseini was born. However, despite these similarities, the two

books dramatically and enjoy
ably differ on closer inspection.
But rest assured â€”if you
enjoyed "The Kite Runner."
then "A Thousand Splendid
Suns" will likely be at least as
much of a treat.
The story opens with the
plight of fifteen-year-old
Mariam and her mother, Nana.
I ler mother, then a housekeep
er for the most well-off family in
the village of Herat, conceived
Mariam out of wedlock with
Jalil, the head of the house.
Already committed to three
other wives and their children,
he forces Mariam and her moth-

er to live as outcasts in a shack up in the hills above Herat. But
Jalil feels guilty, so he periodically sends his legitimate sons
with food and supplies to support Mariam and Nana. Every
Thursday, he visits Mariam. bringing presents and news of the
outside world, to which Mariam has never felt she belongs.
Mariam hero-worships her father and his visits are the high
point of her very existence. Nana, however, bitterly cautions
her against becoming too attached to Jalil, warning her, "Learn

this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle
pointing north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman."
But Mariam finds it impossible to fully heed her mother's
words.
The other central character is Laila, introduced after
Mariam's story has been much further developed, as she is a
generation younger than Mariam. So far, Laila's family life has
been much more stable. Her father, a former university pro
fessor, encourages her to pursue her education no matter what
the current climate for women in Afghanistan is. But when
Laila's brothers, who joined the jihad against the Soviets when
she was only a baby, are killed in action, it unhinges Laila's
mother and causes marital tension between her parents. The
unpleasantness at home drives Laila into the arms of Tariq, a
neighbor boy whom she thinks of as her "true" brother. But as
the fighting between rival factions enters Kabul, Tariq's family
decides to flee to the relative safety of Pakistan. The afternoon
before his departure, however, Tariq and Laila are powerless
to fight against the attraction between them and they make a
choice that alters the courses of their lives forever.
And that's not even close to half of this compelling story.
If you want to know the tumultuous and unpredictable ways in
which the lives of all these complex characters eventually inter
twine, find time to read Hosseini's "A Thousand Splendid
Suns" before classes start up again this fall. You won't be dis
appointed.
