# ALBUM REVIEW
## Architecturally unsound 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION CONSTRUCTION WORKER 
After hearing Architecture in
I lelsinki's 2(X)5 release, "In Case We Die,"
I eagerly awaited their next album. I loved
the sense of fun that created such a lush,
energetic album. Their twee pop sound
was refreshingly original; not only did the
band use the typical drums and guitars of a
normal band, the album featured, among
other instruments, a glockenspiel, synthe
sizers and concert strings. Even after lis
tening to the album over and over, it didn't
seem to get old. Still, I was more than
ready for something new from the band. I
had heard they had released an album,
"We Died, They Remixed," that (sur
prise!) was the original "In Case We Die"
... remixed.
But I didn't want remixes. I wanted
something new! So I approached
Architecture in Helsinki's latest album,
"Places Like Phis" with a lot of excite
ment. Unfortunately, "Places Like This"
is disappointing, especially compared to
the fun that was "In Case We Die." The
layered pop with its cutesy lyrics and
vocals is still there, but something is miss

ing from "Places Like This."
I'm not entirely sure what that some
thing exactly is, but I think it is the
unabashed sense of fun that pervaded "In
Case We Die." Sure, there's fun in "Places
Like 'Phis" — the album is filled with hand
claps and slick back-up vocals — but that
fun seems forced, even artificial. The lack
of self-consciousness is gone; now
Architecture in Helsinki seems to be con
sciously trying to replicate their upbeat
atmosphere of "In Case We Die," but for
all their attempts to recreate it, they can
not.
Take, for instance, the eighth and ninth
songs, "Lazy (Lazy)" and "Nothing's
Wrong." Both songs shift constantly, going
through distinct faster and slower phases
and different vocal styles, such as a near
whisper in "Lazy (Lazy)" and a falsetto in
"Nothing's Wrong," but for all these slick
shifts, the songs are conspicuously not
catchy. No sense of fun overwhelms the lis
tener, instead, it's almost — I never
thought I would say this about
Architecture in Helsinki — boring.
At times the album is worse than bor
ing, it's borderline annoying. It's hard not
to be with back-up vocals like "Hey! Hey!

Hcv! J Icy! Hey!" and "Debbie Debbie
Debbie Down Down Debbie Debbie
Down ..." These repetitive vocals would
be excused if they were fun and used
sparsely, but often they are not. Instead of
amusing, they're just asinine.
I've been pretty harsh on "Places Like
This," perhaps unnecessarily so. The
album is not terrible; I'd say its above aver
age. There's plenty of good spots of the
album, such as the third song, "Hold
Music." "Hold Music" happily demon
strates the best of Architecture in Helsinki
— it's fun, friendly and genuine. The zany
adventurousness of "In Case We Die"
momentarily returns, with lyrics like "I
bought us a dragon / to lighten the load."
Yet, these moments are too few to salvage
the album.
Perhaps the reason why I wasn't a huge
fan of "Places Like This" isn't because of
the quality of the album itself, but my large
expectations for Architecture in Helsinki.
Unfortunately for me, the album, despite its
bright spots, is a bit of a let down. So I guess
I'll just have to wait for Architecture in
Helsinki's next album. And hopefully my
desire for another great album from them
with finallv be fulfilled.
