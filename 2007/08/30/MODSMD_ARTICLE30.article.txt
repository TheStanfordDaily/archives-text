# ALBUM REVIEW
## Forget the New Pornographers...try Caribou instead 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION PORN FIEND 
It's tough writing record reviews of
mediocre albums. It's incredibly easy
to riii apart terrible albums and it's rel
atively simple to highlight the good
features of a great album. But middle
of-the-road albums present a special
challenge: how do you balance your
criticism without boring your audi
ence? It's easy to write about an
album you're passionate about but
writing about an album that you're
lukewarm about? That's a challenge.

Which brings me to "Challengers,"
the recent album by The New
Pornographers, the album I originally
intended to review. It was pretty
decent; it was more gtxxJ than bad.
But as 1 sat down at my computer to
write the review, I grew a little wor
ried. I didn't want to write another
review about an album that, like
Architecture in Helsinki's "Places
Like This," was merely alright.
Luckily 1 remembered a recom
mendation from a friend who works at
his local college radio station for
Caribou's "Andorra." 1 ran to my load

record store and bought it. And after
listening to it a few times, I was excited.
Here was a record I could review!
The album's first song, "Melody
Day" starts immediately with no sort
of introduction or build up. "Melody
Day what have I done? / Now our
hearts are locked up tight again,"
Caribou (real name Daniel Snaith)
sings seconds into the song. From the
beginning, "Andorra" grabs you with
a sense of tender and enclosing imme
diacy and never lets you go.
Particularly grabbing is the over
riding sense of rhvthni that drives

each song. Every instrument, even
Snaith's vocals, seem to be transmu
tated into a sort of percussion instru
ment, as each note is played at exactly
the right time. Each drum beat and
guitar pluck is placed with a mathe
matical precision, never Ux> early or
too late.
This precision is displayed in the
third song, "After Hours," which is
one of the album's best songs. The
song begins with enveloping keyboard
and guitar chords, fades into silence

and then proceeds into an infectious
percussion section. Strange guitar
twitters echo. Suddenly, you're
caught in a world that's at once alien
and familiar; the lovely echoing gui
tars, which emanate distantly in the

atmosphere, create a juxtaposition
that places Snaith's voice all the clos
er. All in all, the effect is like a warm
summer night, as you're cocooned in
a comforting sensation that you don't
want ever to end.
If 1 sound pretentious writing
about a "world that's at once alien
and familiar" and guitars that
"emanate distantly in the atmos
phere," it's because I don't exactly
know how to write about this

"Andorra." It's a simple album but
extremely subtle. Some albums
overwhelm you with how great they
are — The Shin's "Chutes Too
Narrow," or, TV on the Radio's
"Return to Cooke Mountain" come
to mind — but for me, "Andorra"
isn't one of those albums. Instead,
it's a grower, as each listen reveals a
little bit more. And so, "Andorra"
is as easy to write about as it is easy
— and enjoyable — to listen to.
