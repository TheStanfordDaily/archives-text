# A 						BEARDED EXPOSÉ: NOW EVEN TWIRLIER!

### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION BARBER 
I or centuries, mankind has pondered the reasons why
follicular activity graces his visage. Beards and moustaches
in all their variations have on equal parts delighted and dis
gusted womankind for countless generations, begging the
question: why?
Any biologist could answer this question — probably
some cockamamie theory about how we're related to
chimps — but the champions of logic will find it as trou
bling as our reason lor existing. It seems quite absurd that
hair should grow on one's lace and not, say, on the under
side of one's feet. Yet, grow it does and no matter how
often we are shorn, the shadow ol the beard is always on
the horizon.
In all their shapes an sizes, from the eponymous
"Goatee or the sagacious "Fu Manchu," beard formations
are as mysterious to the common man as the difference
between pants and capris. What follows is a brief attempt at
explaining the existence and ultimate purpose of facial hair
in the grand scheme of the cosmos.
First, the historical precedent. Nearly all famous histori
cal figures have had facial hair in some variation. Here are
but a few:
Friedrich Nietzsche — grew it as he saw fit.
Satan— typical depictions of Beelzebub show him sport
ing a pointy goatee. Literally the epitome of evil. Watches
a lot of Oprah.
Hitler — a terrible human being, but historically significant
partially due to the goofy thumbprint moustache.
Freddie Mercury — Fat Bottomed Girls need an idol.
Stalin — the Iron Curtain of moustaches.
Ernest Hemingway — the all-testosterone beard. Also
comes in mojito.
Charlie Chaplin — the anti-Hitler 'stache. Equal parts
empathy and Scott Joplin rag time.
Hulk Hogan — shirt ripping handlebar, brother!
Rich Uncle Pennvbags — do not pass "Go." Do not collect
$2(X).
Charles Darwin— flowing white beard was the origin of
the species.
God — "thou shalt not shave" was the 11 th commandment.
Abraham Lincoln a.k.a. the chin strap of emancipation.

Whether your facial hair leads troops to heinous atroci
ties against humanity, paint melting clocks or merely tie up
distressed damsels on train tracks, one thing is clear
only people with beards or its tiny cousin, the 'stache, are
capable of creating history. Notice that none of the current
administration has any facial hair. Disaster was inevitable.
Even in nature, the animals with the greatest facial hair
are the fiercest. Walruses, bears, wolves and lions all have
some kind of hair growth around their facial regions. Some
of their beards cover their entire bodies. Certainly even
goats with their trademarked chin tuft can be considered
dangerous as they are capable of voraciously consuming
any material known to man. Even tin cans! Madness.
Still, why does this phenomenon occur? After a mere
three days of neglect, men transform from debonairly
handsome to Cro-Magnon. Is this lack of personal groom
ing reflective of intellectual fortitude, the lack of caring
directly correlated to a lack of intelligence? Quite the con
trary, the aforementioned instances indicate a trend: the
more hair one has on one's face, the smarter one tends to
be. Could Darwin have come up with a universal theory to
explain all of nature if his beard had not told him so? Of
course not, that would be preposterous.
How then, you ask, can these beard powers be utilized?
The uses of facial hair are manifold. Even a three-day stub
ble can cover unsightly acne better than any make-up can
hope. Avon should consider a new shade — call it Lazy
Man Beard Blush and make a fortune. A poorly maintained
moustache can look like a beaver just died under your nose.
A well maintained moustache can strike fear into the heart
of your enemies. It is deadlier than any knife. Mutton chops
have been shown to cure glaucoma. In fact, a beard grown
on a cherubic frat boy's face can turn a wet-behind-the-ears
young man into a neuroscientist who dabbles in primate
philosophy. True story.
So wield it proudly, fellow man! Sculpt that beard or
moustache into a finely chiseled chisel and chip away at any
nay saying disbelievers! Twirl thai mustachio! Stroke that
soul patch! Put beads in it. become a pirate! Beards no
know bounds, why should you?
But what about women, you ask? Though this theory
may be weakened by the author's own lack of facial/intel
lectual development, I refer you to the case of Janet Reno
versus Paris Hilton. Who do you think is smarter? Case
closed.
