## ADMINISTRATION Powers resigns from post Dean of Students leaves to spend time with family 
### ANDREA FULLER NEWS EDITOR 
Maureen Powers publicly announced
her resignation as Dean of Students last
week after serving in the post for only one
year. Powers will officially leave Stanford
on Sept. 14, but no solidified plan is cur
rently in place for finding her replace
ment.
Powers — who came to Stanford from
the City College of New York last
September — cited personal reasons as
the motivation for the departure, which
she called "quite sudden." According to
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, he and Powers first privately
discussed her resignation only a few weeks
ago.
"I'm leaving because I need to live clos
er to where my family is living — back
east," she said. "I'm going to be looking
for [another position] closer to my fami
ly."
While Powers was selected as Dean of
Students after a five-month search,
Boardman said the University's course of
action following her resignation is yet to
be determined. Whether an interim struc
ture will be created until a new Dean of
Students is found or whether the
University will find an immediate

replacement is
unknown.
"Right now
I'm looking at all
options,"
Boardman said.
"I'm going to he
spending the
next couple
weeks — maybe
longer — consid
ering the current
organizational

structure and the needs of our students,
our staff and the institution."
Boardman said that determining how
best to cope with Powers' departure is a
"top priority" in the coming weeks — par
ticularly due to its unfortunate timing at
the beginning of the academic year.
This is not the first time in recent histo
ry that the Dean of Students Office has
faced a potential restructuring. Following
former Dean of Students Marc Wais'
departure in 2(X)3, the office was led by a
series of interim and short-lived replace
ments, including Boardman himself.
"For me a critical piece of this is [find
ing] someone who can bring some stability
to the organization," Boardman said.
"There have been five different structures
and five different deans in the last five
years, which doesn't lend itself to what we
really want."
Though Powers' departure marks yet
another upheaval in the office, Boardman
applauded her accomplishments during

her short time at Stanford.
"She was not afraid to tackle an issue or
policy that others might avoid, and was
willing to take action to right a situation,"
he said. "Dean Powers brings a breadth
and depth of experience to her work as
dean. She excels in situations of stress and
conflict. It came down to appreciating the
importance of her family commitment and
obligations, and I don't think that can be
underestimated."
Powers said she had "no complaints"
about her job and enjoyed the efforts in
which she was involved, such as helping to
orchestrate the opening of Old Union,
working with student government, and
improving the operations of the Office of
Judicial Affairs. She lamented, however,
that she did not have the opportunity to
finish up the "strategic planning effort"
that aims to analyze the successes and fail
ures of each department in the Dean of
Students Office.
"I thoroughly enjoyed working with
Stanford students," she said. "They were
interesting and intelligent, very committed
and very diverse. I learned a great deal
from them while I was here. I also appre
ciated working with various departments
in the Dean of Students unit. I appreciate
Boardman and the Provost and the
President hiring me. I'm sorry that it
turned out as it did, that I need to relocate
to be nearer to my family at this time."
