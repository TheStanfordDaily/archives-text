## Student journalist under fire in Uganda

Kampala, Uganda - Katherine Roubos
'07 stumbled into a storm of controversy
this week more befitting a Hollywood
movie than a first-time journalism intern
ship: religious leaders and hundreds of pro
testers rallied in the Ugandan capitol
Tuesday, calling for her deportation
because of her controversial articles on gay
rights.
"1 knew I was taking a risk writing about
the issue, but the extent of the response has
been totally unexpected," said Roubos,
who has been interning at the Kampala
based Daily Monitor since July 2.
The backlash began after Roubos —
originally from Minnetonka, Minn. — was
assigned three stories on gay and lesbian
Ugandans, who have become increasingly
vocal in their demand for equal rights. The
articles examined an ongoing gay rights
court case, evaluated why police do not
arrest gays and covered a press conference
in which gay activists called for equal rights.
Homosexual acts are illegal in the Hast
African country, and offenders may face
life in prison if convicted. Many Ugandans
are suspicious of gays and lesbians, and

conspiracy theories that Westerners are
working to repeal the ban on homosexual
ity abound. While other media organiza
tions covered the press conference and
court case, Roubos' nationality made her
an easy target for anti-gay activists.
Tuesday's protest drew religious lead
ers, politicians and more than 2(X) of their
supporters to a local rugby field, where they
called for the media to stop covering LGBT
issues. Protesters targeted Roubos along
with the Aga Khan — leader of 20 million
Ismaili Muslims and owner of Nation
Media Group, which publishes the Daily
Monitor. A student band from a nearby pri
mary schix)l played drums and brass instru
ments to fire up protesters, who waved
signs that read: "Deport Catherine (sic)
Roubos" and "Agha (sic) Khan — fire
Catherine (sic) Roubos — the homo pro
pagandist."
Standing under a multicolored banner
reading "Interfaith Rainbow Coalition
against Homosexuality" alongside pastors,
priests and imams, organizer and pastor
Martin Ssempa railed against Roubos
and he had done his homework. Ssempa
said that he had performed a Google search
and discovered that Roubos was involved
with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and

Transgender Community Resource Center
at Stanford, which led him to decide she
must be a lesbian herself.
"This is not journalism, but rather crim
inal propaganda." said Ssempa, who held a
young boy in his arms as he rallied the
crowd.
Minister for Ethics and Integrity Nsaba
Buturo was also on hand to represent the
ruling party. Amidst the cheers of support
ers, he assured the crowd that the govern
ment has no intention of repealing the ban
on homosexuality before denouncing for
eign journalists who advocate for gay
rights.
"Allegations that homosexual elements
have penetrated our media are being inves
tigated," Buturo said before going on to
describe homosexuality as a "weapon of
mass destruction."
For Roubos, the experience has been
profoundly frustrating. Stories about the
protest have been syndicated in dozens of
newspapers and on MSNBC and the BBC
Web sites, winning her kudos from
American friends and gay activists world
wide. But the local notoriety has been
wearing on her.
