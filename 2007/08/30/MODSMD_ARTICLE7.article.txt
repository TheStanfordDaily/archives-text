### SALONE KAPUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Electrical Engineering prof, emeritus Ronald
Bracewell died of heart failure at his campus home on
Aug. 12. He was 86.
Prior to his death, Bracewell and his family lived on
Stanford campus for 51 years.
Bracewell's scientific prowess influenced broad
realms of science and technology. He was international
ly renowned for his contributions to magnetic reso-

nance imaging — work that pio
neered common medical diagnostic
tools such as MR Is and CAT scans.
Additionally, Bracewell was well
known for his work in radio astrono
my. In 1%1, he constructed a com
plex telescope consisting of 32 dish
antennas from which NASA pro
duced daily solar maps for the Apollo
moon landings. The telescope, which
has since been dismantled, was con-

sidered the first of its kind to give automatic printed
outputs that could be distributed worldwide.
Originally from Australia, Bracewell arrived at
Stanford in 1955. In his first year at the University, he
co-authored the first text on radio astronomy.
Bracewell taught classes until 1991, hut was often in his
office in the Packard Building in the years afterwards.
He continued to meet with graduate students and share
his research with faculty and alumni groups in the days
before he passed away.
Bracewell's jovial nature endeared him to students
and faculty alike.
Antony Fraser-Smith, professor emeritus of electri
cal engineering, met Bracewell in 1968 when he first
came to Stanford. A native New Zealander, Fraser-
Smith reminisced about their shared cultural heritage
and playful quips they would often exchange about the
other's native country as they passed each other's
offices.
"We had a lot of fun together," Fraser-Smith said.
"We used to argue and joke about all sorts of things
about Australia and New Zealand around the corridors
and as he passed me in my office. But more than any
thing I'll miss him because he was a touch of Australia
at Stanford. He reminded me so much of my country —
there is something about home that, no matter how nice
everyone is in the U.S., you can't reproduce anywhere
else. He was that for me — a little piece of home."
Bracewell's broad range of interests extended to his
passion for the trees on campus. Upon arriving at
Stanford. Bracewell set out to identify each species of
tree on campus. 1 le also taught a popular seminar called
"I Dig Trees" in the late 19705. Over the years,
Bracewell led countless tree tours and published Trees
of Stanford and Environs — a 300-page book that cata
logs the more than 350 species of trees on campus.
Richard Pantell Ph.D. '54, professor emeritus of
electrical engineering, praised Bracewell's well-round
ed intelligence.
"He is known for his diverse set of interests, includ
ing flora and fauna and geology, in addition to his pro
fessional activities," he said. "I lis ability to discuss, intel
ligently, almost any topic set him apart. |l will miss] his
warmth, his sense of humor, and his constant stimulat
ing discussions."
A memorial in Bracewell's honor will likely be held
at the beginning of autumn quarter.
