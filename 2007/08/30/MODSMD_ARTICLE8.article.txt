## Natural Philosophy "Hello. My name is Dog Feces. Fack you!" 
### 
I was greeted with this quaint lit
tle phrase several days ago, at
three o'clock in the morning,
by a Chinese man pointing violent
ly in my direction, wearing short
shorts and a button down shirt
with only two of the buttons done
up. He had swaggered in from the
upper floor of an early morning
restaurant that sold oddlv un-
Chinese cheeseburgers and
catered to the "rock and roll all
night" crowd of Beijing nightlife.
As my mouth dropped to the
floor in horror at this utterance,
Dog Feces proceeded to literally
strangle one of the members of the
eight-person posse we had man
aged to accrue that night. Feces,
whom none of us recognized,
shook the scruff of the man's shirt
lor roughly a minute, pointed
directly between his eyes, and
yelled, "FACK YOU!" once more.
"FACK YOUR HAIR. IT IS
BALDING!"
He was quite flushed, and his
eyes were so open that he looked a
bit like a character from Japanese
anime. He was very drunk.
Luckily, the "balding" man he
had chosen to strangle was also
quite inebriated, but still jolly, and
invited Dog Feces to sit down with
us. And what followed was the
most ridiculous, but at the same
time most interesting, conversa
tion I have ever witnessed.
I have a theory: A culture is
only fully revealed when it lets its
guard down. For better or for
worse, when a culture stops caring
about its "image," it can finally let
the world know who it is. In many
ways, cultures experience the
"insecure teenager" phenomenon.
Overcompensating for an inner
insecurity, teenagers buy out the
shelves of identity-defining stores
such as Hot Topic, looking for the
flashy, jet-black, I-Don't-Care-
About-You attitude conveniently
summarized on a t-shirt. But fun
damentally, you can learn little
about people by looking at the
image of themselves that they try
to present. Mr. Emo Hot Topic, I
know nothing about you except
that you probably have a lot of
wallets hanging from those chains
coming out of your pockets.
The same is true with culture.
Confronted with a changing and
globalized world, the natural
response is to buy out the "Hot
I'opic" of a shared historical tradi
tion. Stores spring up selling terra
cotta warrior reproductions, say
ing to foreigners far and wide,
"Buy our 'culture!'" And an entire
industry develops around tourism

at famous historical sites, complete
with entrepreneurial beggars
offering everything from straw
dolls to caricatures done with cal
ligraphy brushes.
But I feel as if this type of "cul
ture" is nothing more than a cari
cature of itself. It takes a face and
exaggerates the notable features
to unrealistic proportions. It takes
a short and unrepresentative list of
hobbies and turns them into a two
dimensional cartoon. On a cultural
level, it takes a list of holidays and
traditions and turns them into a
two-dollar figurine you can put on
your mantel.
Culture is more real than that,
much less salable and much more
experiential. You find raw culture
in the unguarded ramblings of a
drunkard, the offhand comments
of a taxi driver or the dinner table
chatter of a large restaurant.
Which brings me back to Dog
Feces. What struck me most was
how uninhibited he was, even for a
drunk man. F.very five minutes, he
would point to another person
around the table, and resume his
rounds of "PACK YOU" 's. But
every time he began, he would
express a different concern he had
about American culture. My table
was called racist, sexist, violent,
sexuali/ed and intolerant, based
on nothing more than our country
of origin. By comparison, Chinese
culture lacked any kind of discrim
ination. practiced peace and
chastity and extended an inviting
hand to all visitors. I offer a direct
quote from Feces' mouth:
"American culture is more racist
because it is not as pure as Chinese
culture."
When asked about the Chinese
government, he said he believed in
nothing more than raw power,
which the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) happened to possess.
He had the red star of the CCP
sewn to the back of his pants.
This man's views were not and
could not be written in a brochure.
He was far from polished, and his
condition at the time prevented
him from being on guard. His
words of wisdom were punctuated
with loud English cursing and acts
of random violence (including try


Not
Hillard
ing to open the front zipper on a
pair of my friend's pants and biting
his neck several minutes later).
Yet here was something genuine.
His views on life, liberty and gov
ernment were cultivated in a gen
uine cultural context: He had
never been outside of China.
Though in no way representa
tive of the average Chinese person,
he was direct evidence of what
growing up in China can produce. I
should note here that mv

encounter with Dog Feces was just
as positive as it was negative. His
friendliness and (intentional)
humor were refreshing, and his
views were certainly very interest
ing. I should note as well that 1 am
far from an American apologist â€”
I agreed with much of DF's criti
cism of American culture, though
maybe not to the same degree.
But I will say firmly that this
man is a Chinese man. Just as I am
an American. Neither of us is fully
representative of our respective
cultures, though in a way, we are
part of them.
I left China several days ago,
and I have to admit, I didn't take
many pictures. But this was due to

more than the practical considera
tion of the crappiness of Chinese
"Duraccl" batteries. In truth, more
important than the physical pic
tures are the mental ones. And I
will not leave China with pieces of
glossy paper, but a collection of
impressions.
Dog Feces is certainly not on
the cover of my mental Chinese
scrapbook, but he is on the last
page, right behind the sour milk
guy by the side of the road and my
last Shanghai taxi driver. And
scrawled under his picture is not
"fack you," but two entirely differ
ent words: "Thank vou."
