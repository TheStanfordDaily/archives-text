The Roundtable at Stanford University
(ilohal population increases, surging economic growth in new economies and an unabated
appetite for fossil fuels all are driving huge demand and competition for the world's natural
resources. At the same time, climate change is upon us.
Add to that instability across the Middle East and the growth of extremism and internation
al terrorism. The complexities of today's world are confounding and frightening.
Still, groundbreaking research on alternatives to fossil fuels, breakthroughs in energy effi
ciency and progress in addressing threats to ocean and fresh water offer reasons for hope.
Join us for a provocative roundtable discussion exploring the complex interconnections
among these issues and what we can do as individuals and a nation to address them.
Panelists
Hoover Visiting Fellow Thomas L. Friedman
General John Abizaid New York Times columnist
The Hon. Stephen Breyer John L. Hcnnessy
