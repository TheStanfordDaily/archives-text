We conserve water here.
Blue skies and golden hills are a Stanford hallmark, but they both
mean that water supplies are limited. Please adopt the following
habits during your time here to make sure there is enough water
for people, agriculture, and wildlife:
• Report plumbing leaks and running toilets by calling 5-1602
(for student housing) or 3-2281 (anywhere else on campus).
• Minimize time spent in the shower.
• Don't flush trash down the toilets.
• Run only full loads of laundry, or (if possible) adjust the water
level setting to match your load.
Call 723-4570 or visit http://facilities.stanford.edu/conservation
