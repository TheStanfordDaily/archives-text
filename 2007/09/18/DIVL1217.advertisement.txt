LiAr: Lively Arts.
This is a program
that claims to
bring entertaining
speakers and per
formers to campus
several times a
year. Acronyms
can be deceiving:
Lively Arts is actu
ally pretty great.
This year they're
bringing Philip
Glass, Roseanne
Cash and more
string quartets
than you can
shake a conduc
tor's baton at.
