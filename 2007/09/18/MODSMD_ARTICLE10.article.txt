# OFF-CAMPUS
## Okazaki evicted from UCLA 
### AMIT ARORA MANAGING EDITOR 
It appears that what took Stanford four years
to do, UCLA was able to accomplish in four
months.
In May 2007,The Daily reported that Eliza
beth Okazaki, over the course of four years, at
tended graduate physics seminars, assumed a
locker space, and. for months at a time, procured
rooms in which to sleep in the Varian Physics
Lab. Although she claimed to be a visiting schol
ar in the humanities and, at times, suggested that
she was working with noted string theorist Prof.
Leonard Susskind. Okazaki offered no proof to
substantiate any of these claims and. within two
days of The Daily investigation. University offi
cials asked her to leave campus.
Her destination: UCLA. Enlisting the help of
a faculty member in the UCLA philosophy de
partment, Okazaki secured a Bruin Card as a de
partment "affiliate," enabling her to access and
loan library materials and store her possessions
in lockers in the UCLA recreation center. After
four months of posing as an interdisciplinary
scholar interested in the philosophy of music,
Okazaki was stopped by officers of the UCLA
Police Department last Wednesday, and her
Bruin Card was taken away from her.
The quick action against Okazaki was spear
headed by the efforts of one particularly vigilant
university employee. In an interview with The
Daily, Edward Blancarte, a student affairs offi
cer in UCLA's ethnomusicology department,
said that he quickly began to connect the dots
between the somewhat eccentric individual he
met in the music department in the middle of
August and the impostor he had read about in
The Daily last May.
"This girl came in. and I just started to make
connections," Blancarte said. "When I made that
initial connection, it was just a really strange
feeling, and when all the evidence started to
back that up. I was really surprised."
Unlike administrative officials in the Vari
an Physics Lab who, many doctoral physics
students suggested, failed to investigate
Okazaki properly while she was at Stanford,
Blancarte followed through on his initial sus
picions. In telephone conversations with
Okazaki's landlady in Bel Air, Blancarte con
firmed that the individual who spent six to
eight hours each day in the Music Library was,
in fact, Okazaki.
In the end of August, according to Blancarte,
Okazaki moved to a residence in Westwood and
also began to use the lockers in UCLA's John
Wooden Center to store some of her personal
belongings. Certain that Okazaki was about to
make UCLA her home just as she had done at
Stanford. Blancarte informed the philosophy
department, the Bruin Card office, the recre
ation center and the police department of his
doubts about the circumstances by which
Okazaki had been granted affiliate status.
While numerous calls to the UCLA Police

Department were not returned and Bruin Card
office manager Nancy Tran declined to com
ment, Prof. Donald Martin, the chair of UCLA's
philosophy department, told The Daily that
Okazaki appeared to be a credible scholar when
she requested access to the library in early June,
and he acknowledged that he signed her appli
cation as department chair.
"She represented herself as someone who
wanted to work on a philosophy project in the
summer here," Martin said. "She wanted a li
brary card, and a member of the faculty thought
it sounded reasonable."
But by the second week of September, the
philosophy department and the Bruin Card of
fice both agreed to revoke Okazaki's Bruin-
Card, and, on Sept. 12, officers from the UCLA
Police Department approached Okazaki at her
usual spot in the Music Library and successfully
obtained the student identification card from
her.
Okazaki's ties with UCLA have still yet to
be completely severed, though. As of press
time, Okazaki has 16 books and CDs checked
out from the music library, and, although she
promised to return the materials when her Bru
in Card was revoked, she has yet to return to the
library.
"I don't want to aggravate her," said Bridget
Risemberg, the library's head of circulation
services. "I don't even mind if she uses the li
brary. I just want her to return the materials."
But it does not appear that Okazaki is ready
to terminate her stay at the Southern California
school; Henry Lim,the library's technical servic
es assistant, told The Daily that Okazaki con
tacted him just hours after her Bruin Card was
revoked and asked him to check library materi
als out under his name for her use.
That Okazaki seeks to take advantage of the
sympathy shown to her by others was of little
surprise to those interviewed by The Daily.
"She's very manipulative," said ethnomusi
cology department receptionist Carol Pratt.
"She really plays on people's emotions."
While on the Farm. Okazaki capitalized on
the non-confrontational attitude of graduate
students and physics faculty members; at
UCLA, she was able to enlist the support of staff
members in caring for her dying cat. One music
department employee told The Daily that he
helped Okazaki administer subcutaneous intra
venous fluids to the moribund cat. and Lim said
that he later drove Okazaki to the crematorium
after the cat died of renal failure.
To Blancarte, Okazaki's story ultimately
evinces the inefficiencies that pervade college
campuses and administrations.
"I'm coming to realize how uncoordinated all
of UCLA's systems are," Blancarte said.
"UCLA's bureaucracy is vast to the point that
people can slip into the cracks easily."
At the very least. Blancarte can still measuie
Okazaki's stay in months and not in years â€” a
luxury hardly available to those of us at Stanford.
