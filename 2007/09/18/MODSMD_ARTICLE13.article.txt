When Leland Stanford opened the doors to
his university in 1891. it was viewed as de
cisively different from its East Coast
counterparts. In particular, the main quadrangle
was a concrete testament to this proud divergence.
Built in the form of mission-style revival. Stanford's
academic center looked out onto the world. Its gar
ish sandstone massing, set ablaze with red tiled
roofs, proudly declared a fierce allegiance to the
ideology of the Wild West. The message was clear:
This was to be an institution for academic pioneers
boldly blazing their way into an optimistic future.
The architecture of our campus matched the ethos
of our university.
Over 1 (X) years later. Stanford still embodies this
pioneering spirit. Our university is renowned for
the entrepreneurial vibe that permeates campus
culture. The founders of Google, Yahoo, Nike and
Victoria's Secret all attended Stanford. We are a
community that sets itself apart by being different
and taking risks.
t Why. then, are Stanford's buildings of today so
lackluster? From the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
the Graduate Community Center, the more recent
structures on campus look like they belong in an in
dustrial park.Try to picture a corporate logo on the
side of Sweet Hall. The image is not so difficult to
conjure.
Industrial buildings are often designed to be un
interesting because companies move, merge and
declare bankruptcy. Most of these buildings are not
expected to last more than 25 years. They are built
for quick assembly and cheap deconstruction.
So what kind of message does Stanford send
when it lets its new buildings look like an adden
dum to the Googleplex in Mountain View?
Granted, not every building constructed post
-1900 looks as though it were carelessly ordered
from a catalog. When Stanford decides to take ar
chitectural risks, the results are often noteworthy.

t might be excusable to build what amounts to a
series of aggrandized chicken coops if they were not

of the old Main Quad. The most environmentally
innovative building on campus is not even Stan
ford's, but, rather, the Carnegie Institution's De
partment of Global Ecology building.
The biggest victims of Stanford's mindless build
ing tactics are its students. The Lakeside Houses
and the Lomita Court Houses, such as Jerry and
680, are concrete cell blocks which completely dis
courage community-building. Fortunately, half of
these houses are occupied by inherently social fra
ternities, and they all primarily offer two-room dou
bles. If 680 Lomita consisted of only two-room
triples, this terrible building probably wouldn't fill
the same niche.

the architecture of Manzanita Park alienates resi

ford might be ready to build buildings on campus
that stand up to the strength of its founder's pio

Ultimately, Stanford should reevaluate its cur
rent building values. Yes, it is easier to let donors
serve as the bland masterminds to their sterile
buildings. Yes, it is easier to cut project budgets in

Donald Gellespie, architect of Wellesley College's
victorious student union. But how will these build
