# Where have all the campus activists gone?

In perhaps the strongest rebuke of President
Bush's Iraq policy to date, the I louse of Repre
sentatives voted 246-182 last Friday against the
administration's plan to send 21,500 additional
troops to the front lines. Although the anti-surge
resolution is non-binding, it sends a clear message
to the Bush administration that lawmakers are in
creasingly weary of our open-ended commitment
to the war-ravaged nation.
Ilie I louse vote also reflected Americans' grow
ing outrage over the war's disastrous planning and
execution. With war approval ratings near all-time
lows, Americans have never before been so united
against the Bush administration's Iraq policy. The
Democrats' sweeping gains in the midterm elec
tions are evidence that public opposition to the war
has reached a fever pitch.
Not so here on campus. As we approach the
fourth anniversary of the ill-fated campaign's
launch — longer than American involvement in
World War II — student dissatisfaction with the
war does not appear to have kept pace with that of
most Americans. When dissent arises, student reac
tion to the war has been muted.
During the height of the Vietnam conflict in the
late '60s and early '70s, hardly a day went by without
an anti-war demonstration at the University. Stu
dents and faculty members alike colluded to op
pose an unpopular war. In collaboration with
protests throughout the nation, mobilization on a

massive scale forced national policy makers to lis
ten to student concerns.
Protests against the Iraq war, in contrast, have
fallen far short of those against Vietnam in both fre
quency and size. To he fair, some smaller events
have been staged on campus. Student and faculty
activists organized a series of "Books not Bombs"
rallies in White Plaza during the first year of the
war, but these protests have not been replicated
since. President Bush's visit to the Hoover institu
tion of April 2006 drew an impressive crowd of ac
tivists and onlookers, although it is unclear how
many were explicitly protesting the war. In Novem
ber, an anonymous student group called "projec
tAliveTo" sketched 900 chalk outlines of fallen sol
diers and civilians to raise awareness of the loss of
life resulting from the war. Yet beyond these no
table instances of student activism, discussion of the
war has been largely limited to lecture halls and
email chat lists.
Of course, Iraq differs from Vietnam in one crit
ical aspect: The government has not instituted a
civilian draft, nor is one likely to occur. Vietnam-era
protests often focused as much on the draft as on
the conduct of the war itself. Further, the 58,000
American fatalities suffered during Vietnam is a
figure which dwarfs the 3,100-plus American sol
diers who have lost their lives in Iraq. Absent the
credible possibility of a draft, it can be easy to lose
sight of the grave peril faced by thousands of our
brave troops in Iraq.
Yet even if direct comparisons with Vietnam are
imperfect, they help to illuminate the relative lack

of concern with which students have met the war on
this campus. Although the possibility of being draft
ed is minimal, our generation surely must be
alarmed by the administration's refusal to construct
a timeline for a troop drawdown or to provide ade
quate incentives for Iraqis to assume responsibility
for their own security. If nothing else, students
should be concerned with the deficit spending ne
cessitated by the war's outsized costs, the interest
on which will be funded by taxes on our future earn
ings.
If students are truly apathetic about the Iraq de
bacle, perhaps the time has come to fight the temp
tation to succumb to the omnipresent Stanford
bubble. The substantial number of students who
harbor unspoken misgivings about the war should
bear in mind that silence is easily mistaken for com
placence, or even tacit support.
Public demonstrations are not necessarily the
best course of action for students to take, as protests
can be divisive, ineffective or even counterproduc
tive. Alternate forms of expression can be more
fruitful, ranging from writing senators and repre
sentatives to taking part in discussion forums. But
let us strive to engage in a constructive dialogue
about an ill-fated war that seems to have reached a
breaking point in the national psyche, but about
which many students appear to remain dispassion
ate. If circumstances allow, perhaps the fruits of that
discussion can effect change at a broader level.
