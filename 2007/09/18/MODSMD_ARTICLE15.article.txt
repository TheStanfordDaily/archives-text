# Sweat-free tactics questionable

Last week's sit-in by the Stanford Sweat-Free
Coalition at President Hennessy's office, the
culmination of a year-long campaign pressur
ing the University to sell only apparel i hat had been
produced in humane conditions, should be com
mended for its passion but questioned for its meth
ods.
Similar to the Stanford Labor Action Coalition's
campaign for a comprehensive living wage policy
for on-campus workers, Sweat-Free Stanford's mo
tivations are clearly principled. A commitment to
fight worker exploitation is both socially responsi
ble and in line with the policies alreadv adopted by
Columbia, Cornell and Harvard. And given that
Hennessy announced in a Tliesday op-ed that S
should be commended for its victory.
Yet while the passion of these activists is not in

question, we must question whether Sweat-Free's
actions last week were warranted. Hennessy has
met with Sweat-Free representatives numerous
times over the past several months and had pro
posed an additional meeting that would have con
vened this week. In his op-ed, he claims that he was
already committed to signing on to the WRC and
was planning to inform Sweat-Free organizers of
this change in University policy at the missed meet
ing.
Sweat-Free Stanford may have felt that the
University and Hennessy were "stalling," as they
wrote in their IXiesday op-ed ("Why we took over
the President's Office," May 29). But given the re
peated meetings and Hennessy's recent acquies
cence to one of their key demands, legitimate
channels for dialogue don't seem to have been ex
hausted. This raises concerns, then, that Sweat-
Free Stanford's decision to have a sit-in was some
what rash and counterproductive — we can only

wonder whether Hennessy compromised because
of the sit-in or in spite of it. By resorting to atten
tion grabbing tactics like this, Sweat-Free implies
that stance only makes future cooperation be
tween the administration and student groups
more difficult. And in our experience with this
issue. University leaders have been fairly respon
sive.
Stanford will take a stronger position in support
of the well-being of the garment workers it indirect
ly employs, which is great news for workers and
Sweat-Free alike. Hennessy's protests aside, the
University did not actually take the initiative in im
plementing these reforms until after Sweat-Free
took more drastic action. But by acting without
meaningfully taking the consequences of their ac
tions into account, the 11 activists who stormed the
presidents office risked painting themselves —
and, more importantly, their cause — as more
about the act of protesting than its results.
