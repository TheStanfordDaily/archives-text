## Life in the Freshman Dorm 
### 
Living in an all-fresh
man dorm is the best
and worst thing that
will ever happen to you. It's
summer camp with booze
and video games and friends
with benefits; it's boarding
school with a few hundred

extra rules and regulations, plus an RF governess and a crusty old
Dean, ruining all your fun. You'll make close friends, fellow students
as young and confused and excited as you; you'll get trapped in the
hermetically sealed funhouse, a bubble within a bubble. Freshmen
from four-class dorms know more people from more parts of campus,
but only because four-class dorms define boredom. None of them
have the kind of memories we made in Larkin.
Larkin 2003-2004 was a very particular time and place, like '60s San
Francisco or the Weimar Republic — often ecstatic, occasionally trag
ic, sometimes boring, always memorable.
There was enough vomit to fill a vomitorium from the late deca
dent decline of the Roman Empire. Important lesson, kids: When
you're running into the bathroom in the middle of a Power Hour to
boot and rally, it's better to projectile all over the floor than anywhere
near the sink. The floor can be cleaned, by you, in the morning. Sinks
have pipes that need clearing by poorly-paid janitors who really have
better ways to spend their lives. Not all the regurgitation was alcohol
related; the girls' bathroom got clogged with body image issues
But the best things about the freshman dorm, the stuff that lasts
forever, are just feelings you get, in quiet moments, when the past feels
close. 1 can remember waking up on a Sunday afternoon on my futon
— I'd been too lazy to climb into bed the night before. Some other
people slouched into our room. There was no thought of doing any
thing useful — our bodies and souls were wrecked from a week of
weekends. Someone suggested we pop in a movie. The girl from down
the hall had never seen "Scarface." My roommate and I both had the
DVD — we were young men, and this was 2004. We watched the
movie, some of us typing on our laptops, all of us lying splayed out
across the futon and the floor. From down the hall you could hear the
guys playing HALO and NFL Street. The spring sun came in through
the window. It could have been any hour of the day. I didn't feel tired,
and 1 didn't want to move.
Someone on the inside told me that ResEd — the few staff mem
bers left from those days who haven't quit or gotten sacked — gener
ally refers to our year's Larkin as the worst freshman dorm in history...
...Proving they don't know anything about freshmen, dorms or his
tory.

Everyone from Larkin who got sent to the Residence Dean is now work
ing at ci Fortune S(H) Company for an impressive salary. Darren Franich
is the tragic exception. Email him at dfranich@gmail.com.
