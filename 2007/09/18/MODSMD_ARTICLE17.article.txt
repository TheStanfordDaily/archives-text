# Holt's Harangue
## A 						warm welcome to Dean Rumsfeld 
### 
Donald Rumsfeld, for
mer Secretary of De
fense, is coming to
Stanford as a Hoover Fellow.
Many are wondering about
the selection, pondering the
wisdom of placing a politi
cian in an academic environ
ment. Others are wondering

why, if the Hoover Institution wanted a frightening warmonger, it did
n't just dig up Genghis Khan's frozen corpse. But these liberal criti
cisms 1 dismiss, just as I do most of Modest Mouse's work.
I believe Stanford needs Donald Rumsfeld. This conviction brings
me to the second important piece of news that has struck Stanford:
our Dean of Students, Maureen Powers, has resigned from the fast
paced life of the West Coast to return to the relaxed Northeast. She
finds traffic, cold weather and New Yorkers more low-key than Stan
ford students. She will be missed.
1 propose that Donald Rumsfeld become the new Dean of Stu
dents. Liberals have questioned placing a politician in our academic
environment, but 1 can tell you that I've been surrounded by nothing
but academics at this university; that just proves we're not really com
mitted to diversity.
In contrast, while many conservatives point to the educational
value of Rumsfeld's experience, anyone who is familiar with his inter
views over the last few months knows he doesn't remember anything.
Rather, we need his innate administrative skill.
Critics also often overlook Rumsfeld's softer side. The media too
often focus on the content of Rumsfeld's policies rather than the con
text in which Rumsfeld explains them. When he was briefing Presi
dent Bush about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, people con
veniently forget he was playing catch with his grandson, Jimmy. The
liberal media often found his hand signals during speeches threaten
ing, but this habit is due to his background as a children's puppeteer.
Similarly, the media focused on the disaster at Abu Gharib, not even
noticing that, during the press conference, his face showed the rem
nants of face paint he had worn to lighten the spirits of patients in a
local veterans' hospital.
He'll be an ally of the students, something Maureen (Over) Powers
was not. When confronted with the knowledge that prisoners were
being forced to stand for four hours, Rumsfeld replied that he stood
eight hours a day and didn't see what the big deal was. He's seen a lot
in his days, and this hardened attitude will ensure that our catastro
phes will seem mild in comparison to the stuff that he's seen. So when
Dean Rumsfeld is confronted with student indiscretions, 1 imagine
he'd be able to add some much needed perspective. Through his ac
tions, many Americans and Iraqis were killed in brutal and senseless
ways.
In comparison, Johnny Q. Student's third alcohol citation doesn't
seem so bad. Yes, the sorority probably shouldn't have made its
pledges drink so much and then run laps. But Rummy's dealt with in
terrogators who kidnapped suspected terrorists to illegal and secret
prisons all over the world where they were waterboarded and had to
read the original script to "Cats." So, really, I imagine that Dean


Chris
Holt
Rumsfeld would be pretty tolerant
of student misbehavior.
He'd also be a big supporter of
the administration. Why, he's
renowned for his loyalty to govern
ing bodies. No matter how contro
versial the decision, Dean Rumsfeld
would put up a good front. If the
University accepted money from a
donor who sought to erect a 300-
room building without windows or a
large gym without showers. Rummy

would stand by the administration's
decision. If the administration de
cided to close the CoHo (wait...nev
ermind) and instead put in a bird
bath for Arrillaga's pet zebra. Dean
Rummy would explain to the stu
dents why it's for the best. He'd reas
sure us with things like,"lt's compli
cated" and "hard work."
Some students have expressed
cynicism at the appointment of
Rumsfeld. They suggest that
Rummy would not be likely to en
gage students in an active debate,
and, instead, his very presence
seems to implicitly support numer
ous war crimes and one of the least
popular administrations in record-

Ed history. Many claim that even
conservatives consider him the em
bodiment of failed policy and a
blight on their party While the
Hoover Institute is a separate body,
these students assert that his selec
tion is an embarrassment to the
greater campus community and an
insult to the innumerable soldiers
and civilians that have lost their
lives in Iraq.
To these foes, 1 can only reply:
you go to school with the ethics you
have, not with the ethics vou want.
