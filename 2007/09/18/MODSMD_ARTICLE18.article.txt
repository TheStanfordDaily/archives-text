# A
						nerdy debate: FroSoCo versus SLE
## 
### 
When I filled out my housing
preference form as a wide
eyed Pro Fro the summer
before 1 arrived at Stanford, I remem
ber being intrigued by the "Fresh
man-Sophomore College" option. It
looked different from all the other
boxes 1 could check (all-frosh/four
class, co-ed floor/single-sex floor). So
I wrote my little FroSoCo "applica
tion" essay, and voila! 1 gained entry
into one of the most mocked and mis
understood organizations on campus.
When I arrived in September. I
started to hear a lot of smack about
my dorm, but I didn't understand
what everyone was complaining
about. ITiey said that FroSoCo kids
lived a profoundly lame existence, but
my fellow FroSoCoans and 1 had lots
of fun — and I don't just mean play
ing Scrabble. We had plenty of the
kind of disinhibited good times that
your parents wouldn't want to hear
about. Living in the Fro never held us
back from the pleasures of freshman
year: 1 went fountain-hopping, kissed
seniors (and sketchy grad students) at
Full Moon, joined Band, ran crew for
Gaieties, frequented parties at the
frats and Row houses and hung out in
Naranja, Donner and Roble. And al
though the stumble home might have
taken a little longer. I was always
happy knowing that I was going
home. FroSoCo really is a family, one
that you can't graduate from, one that
welcomes you back for Friday night
barbecues at Dean Bravman's house
even after you leave. Also, my cushy
two-room double with loft space cer
tainly compared favorably to those
Lag micro-doubles.

I think the stereotypes about the
Fro being an isolated nerdcamp arise
from the misconception that, like
SLE. we have mandatory extra class
es, or something. FSC doesn't require
that you do anything but live there,
but the opportunities provided to
FroSoCoans are unparalleled. Be
sides the requisite Snow Trips and
Scavenger Hunts, the dorm calendar
is chock-full of a variety of programs:
Oral Communications workshops on
editing your resume, trips to San
Francisco to see shows, Passover
Seders, Brownie Nights, movie
screenings, panel discussions and. of
course, the Dean's Dinners and
Lunches, where residents can meet,
hear lectures from and dine with lu
minary professors whom Dean Brav
man invites to the dorm. You're not
required to show up for a single one of
these events, but you're never at a loss
for intellectual or social stimuli.
The Fro also has some pretty
rockin' resources and facilities. Of
course, there are the famous two
room doubles. There's also Ricker
Dining, which, though peanut-averse,
serves what I consider the healthiest
and tastiest fare of any of the dining
halls on campus. And because the
FSC staff is larger than that of compa
rably-sized dorms, as a resident, you
have more in-house resources and
more adults from whom you can seek
aid and advice. For about 160 resi
dents. we have 17 student staffers, an
oral communications director, a pro
gram associate, four college directors
(RFs, basically) and Dean Bravman
and his wife, Wendy Wright. The FSC
senior staff is one of the dorm's secret

weapons. Not only are they some of
the coolest, kindest people who drive
around a red wagon full of cookies
and milk during finals, but our college
directors also happen to be the Direc
tors of Undergraduate Advising and
Research and Freshman and Sopho
more Programs.
Ilien there's John Bravman — the
man, the myth, the Provost for Under
graduate Education, the BadAss
Dean with a DVD collection that ri
vals Media & Microtext. If all that re
ally floats your boat, you can opt to re
peat the FSC experience during your
sophomore year; it's the only place on
campus where you're guaranteed to
be able to stay for two years, if you
want. (If you do stay, it counts as an
unpreferred year in the Draw, which is
pretty sweet.)
Though often misunderstood,
FroSoCo is a pretty fantastic place to
live. Although I decided not to stay for
my sophomore year. 1 felt drawn back
to my former home by my senior year.
Being on staff and living in FroSoCo
last year was one of the best experi
ences of my Stanford career — I loved
the comfortable, collegiate atmos
phere. the dynamic and supportive staff
and my charming, quirky, brilliant resi
dents. So, before you kntx-k FroSoCo,
take the time to go and see what it's re
ally all about. It may be all the way out
in Governor's Corner, but your mama
didn't think it was too far last night.

Hello. My name is Natalie, and
I'm a SLErd. A SLE kid. A
kid who was in SLE.
So what is SLE, you might he
wondering (and by "you," 1 mean
freshmen). By now, you may have
heard something vague about it or
remember coming across the word in
your mess of papers to fill out a few
months ago. In short. SLE (pro
nounced "slee") stands for Struc
tured Liberal Education, a unique
program in which about 100 fresh
men live and learn together for a
year on the east side of Florence
Moore Hall.Translation: No IHUM,
no PWR. noTAs and an interrelated
9-10 unit curriculum that carries
throughout all three quarters of
freshman year.
Like FroSoCo residents, SLE kids
are often the brunt of many a joke on
campus. If Stanford were a play
ground. the SLE kids would be the
ones getting taunted for reading dur
ing recess, and the FroSoCo tikes
would be the ones who were ostra
cized because they lived too far away
for a proper play date. Unlike FroSo-
Co. however, we are joined together
by more than just our residence, and
we do not reap the benefits of Vice
I'rovost John Bravman's shnazzy
barbecues and ginormous movie col
lection.
1 learned about SLE after a friend
of mine who was a sophomore at
Stanford told me that not doing SLE
was one of his biggest regrets. As you
move past freshman year, you'll find
a lot of students who express the
same sentiment. For every IHUM
mer who mocks us from afar or in
stantly judges us after finding out
that he is conversing with a SLE kid,
there's someone who has a ton of
SLE friends or who wishes he had

known that this gem of a program ex
isted— and that he hadn't listened
to the overwhelmingly negative
feedback from students who have
probably never even spoken to a
SLE kid.
Granted. SLE is not for everyone,
and even a handful of SLE kids
might not have the fondest memo
ries of the program. The point, how
ever. is to understand where we're
coming from.
Our dinner table conversations
sound just like yours. For the most
part, we aren't chewing the fat about
" Ihe Republic" over our (eight fla
vors of) ice cream. We, too, talk about
that Chem 3IX test we bombed or
that party coming up next weekend.
But if students do want to continue
strains of intellectual dialogue from
lecture, they can rest assured that
they won't be stared at like a leper.
What's not to like about Florence
Moore? FloMo may not resemble
the hotel where you had your high
school prom (i.e.. Branner).but it's a
cozy little place. We've got windows
bigger than Lag's mini doubles, and
we're all connected by the infamous
catwalks — the perfect place to nap
on a hammock, catch some sun or
have some good, clean fun.
The location can't be beat. I
haven't ridden a bike once (partly
due to the fact that 1 forgot how to
ride one. It happens), and it's never
been a problem. If I lived in FroSo-
FarAway, on the other hand. I'd be
sporting a pretty sweet limp right
now. Plus, it's a lot easier to take the
walk of shame or teeter back home
from a party when you're only 10
steps away from the Row (for the
record, I've done neither).
Moving beyond that surface stuff,
the beautv of SLE lies in its building

of community. Nothing forges bonds
like spending so many hours a week
learning together, eating together
and going nuts about a paper togeth
er (after all. we all have the same
deadlines in SLE). Although we re
ceive lectures from faculty members
across many disciplines, our sections
are led by a core of faculty members
who really form the heart of SLE.
And we have the coolest RF family
on the block — they invite students
over once a week during The Daily
Show for fresh-baked cookies.
I think back to how integral SLE
was to my memories of freshman
year. Staying up late to talk about re
ligion in the hallways. Sighing in frus
trated unison during paper study
breaks. Exchanging looks of confu
sion during the obscure foreign films.
Celebrating after finishing each
paper. Celebrating even more after
surviving the 24-hour final. Leaving
the oral final with the knowledge
that we just carried on a conversation
about the Holocaust, Virginia Woolf,
Picasso, Plato and Freud in one 10-
minute period.
I've never quite understood why
SLE gets such a bad rap around cam
pus. OK. 1 guess 1 understand,but it's
still so silly. Is it the reading? 'I"he fact
that we all live together?'lTiat we like
to learn and aren't afraid to admit it?
Isn't that why we all came to Stan
ford in the first place?
We're Sexy, Luscious and Educat
ed, and damn proud of it. As Socrates
and a pretentious IHUM kid would
say, an unexamined life is really not
worth living.
