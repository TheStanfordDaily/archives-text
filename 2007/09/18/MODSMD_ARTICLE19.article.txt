# Letter to the Editor
## 
### 
We write to express our deep
concern at the appointment
of Donald Rumsfeld as a
"distinguished visiting fellow" at the
Hoover Institution. As members of
the Stanford community who consid
er our country's fulfillment of its
highest ideals as part of the Universi
ty's educational mission, we feel this
appointment is a clear diminishment
of our institution's and, indeed, our
country's values.
Mr. Rumsfeld bears major re
sponsibility for condoning torture as
an instrument of national policy, for
callous disregard of international law
and for the precipitous erosion of our
civil liberties. While Secretary of De

fense, Mr. Rumsfeld knowingly de
ceived the American public in push
ing for an unnecessary war and a now
disastrous military occupation. Fur
thermore, he has done a signal dis
service to democratic debate, an in
dispensable element in educational
and democratic institutions univer
sally, by accusing those who raised
questions about this war at its incep
tion of being unpatriotic and even
treasonous. Such a dampening of vig
orous democratic discussion and in
tellectual inquiry entirely contradicts
Stanford's motto: "The wind of free
dom blows."

Sincerely,
Andrew Altschul.
