# STUDENT LIFE
## Freshmen use Facebook more than ever Site allows students to make friends before school starts 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is one of a handful of schools na
tionwide that does not tell incoming fresh
men who their roommates will be until the
first day of New Student Orientation (NSO).
It is a source of pride for the University,
which hopes withholding the information
will be conducive to a better dorm atmos
phere.
Until recently, this secret of dorm life
brought freshmen to campus without know
ing a soul. There were no familiar faces, and
students had no way to know if anyone else in
the dorm was bringing a Play Station.
When the Facebook revolution took the
nation's colleges and universities by storm in
2004, it eliminated this aspect of mystery.
Now, incoming freshmen form friendships
and make plans with their new classmates
months before they even arrive on campus.
The social networking site has become the </r
facto homepage of countless college students,
and Stanford's Class of 2011 has put Face
book to use by excitedly planning for the up
coming year before it begins today.
Prachi Priyam '11 created the "Stanford
2011" Facebook group the very night she was
accepted under Stanford's Single-Choice
Early Action program last December. Now,
as NSC) has officially begun, the group boasts
more than 1.400 members â€” about 80 per
cent of the freshman class. In February,
Priyam used Facebook to meet up
with other Bay Area admits on cam
pus and has since used the site to
learn about both future classmates
and life at Stanford.
"[The group] has been a great re
source about SPOT trips, advisors and
when we should have certain mailings,
amongst other things," she said.
Priyam is not alone in her reliance
on Facebook as a source of informa
tion before school starts.
"[l] joined the group at probably
5:10 p.m. on Dec. 15," said Stephanie
Werner' 11." 1 n other words, immedi
ately."

Through Facebook. Werner and
other Chicago area admits have or
ganized get-to-know-you dinners
and other social events, and they are
even gearing up for a game of Cap
ture the Flag during NSO.
"For us. it's a vehicle to get ques
tions answered, share similar inter
ests and concerns and build up com
munal excitement," she said.
While freshmen may get to know
their peers before school starts, staff
in all-freshmen dorms will not accept
Facebook friend requests from in
coming students until after NSO.
Residential Education (ResEd) re
quires that staff members have mini
mal interaction with freshmen be
fore they arrive on campus, said Eric
Boromisa '09, a Head Peer Academ
ic Coordinator (HPAC) in Branner.
"It's really important that [the

freshmen] don't come in with any
preconceived notions," said Fagan
Harris '09. a Branner Residential As
sistant (RA). "We want them to
come in on equal footing and discov
er it all and enjoy that excitement of
opening day together."
Despite Res Ed's efforts, dorm
Facebook groups are buzzing with
students' speculation about dorm
cest, co-ed showers and poker
games.
Sam Alimi '11 used Facebook to
organize a beach trip to Santa Cruz
earlier this month.
"Basically, 1 wanted people to
have an opportunity to meet other
kids before school started," he said.
"[That way], we can go to Stanford
already knowing some people, mak
ing the first couple weeks a lot less
daunting."

Nevertheless, Branner RA
Arpeet Shah '09 pointed out that
Facehook can only do so much be
fore school begins.
"You don't actually know each of
these people," he said, referring to
the hundreds of Facebook friends
that many freshmen already have.
Although she is active on Face
book, Georgia Andrews '11 admit
ted that making lasting friends might
come down to meeting people the
old-fashioned way. despite the
changes wrought by Facebook.
"I'm coming with a box of Russell
Stover chocolates." she posted on the
wall of the "Rinconada '(TZ-'OS" Face
book group. "I'm supposed to use
them to make friends."
