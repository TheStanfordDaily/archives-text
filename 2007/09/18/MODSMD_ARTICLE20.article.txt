## Race for Facebook app Stanford students create Graffiti application for online social network 
### CHRISTIAN TOM DESK EDITOR 
Part I: An Application is Born
May 25 marked a new era for Facebook. as Joachim De Lom
baert '09 and Alex Onsager 09 spent the night hacking at their
keyboards and ironing out the kinks in long lines of computer
code.
Just the day before. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made
a stunning announcement at a developers' conference in San
Francisco. In a new age of the online social network, his compa
ny would now allow anyone to write individual programs or "ap
plications" for Facebook users and, notably, to make a profit off
advertising if they chose.
Brainstorming for a killer idea. De Lombaert and Onsager
came up with Graffiti, an application which would allow Face
book users to post messages more imaginatively than ever be
fore on their friends' walls — that is, with more than just text.
The two Stanford students worked through the night, sacrific
ing sleep in an effort to finish the project as quickly as possible.
"For me, it was an awesome moment to sit down right |until]
it was done," said De Lombaert, who estimated he and Onsager
worked for 30 hours straight.
Their goal from the start, he said, was simply to create some
thing that others would want to use. something to which their
friends would say, "Wow, you made this?"
The Stanford juniors were not the only ones to think of a
Graffiti application, however. While they worked, three other
young Fac book developers in the Boston area embarked on
their own extended coding adventure. After Facebook's ground
breaking announcement.Tim Suzman and Mark Kantor, recent
graduates of Boston's Brandeis University, along with Ted Suz-

man. now a freshman at Washington University in
St. Louis, jumped at the chance of a lifetime.

ITie three worked feverishly to rewrite a previous
version of a graffiti concept. Their application, added

to the Facebook Application Director)' a few days
later, would become Graffiti Wall, one of the most pop-

ular on the entire site.
[Note: in this article, "Graffiti" refers to the applica
tion launched at Stanford while "Graffiti Wall" refers to

Suzman and his co-founders' application. The Stanford
students placed their work on the site first, forcing the

other students to give their program a longer name.]
"We knew it was a massive opportunity," said Tim Suz-

man. "But we knew it would be incredibly fast-paced. We
knew we couldn't afford to sit around and build things at

our leisure."
Like De Lombaert and Onsager. the Graffiti Wall team
worked nonstop on their code.
"There was not a lot of sleep involved,"Tim Suzman said

It was a lot of adrenaline."
Although both groups sacrificed comparable time and

sleep. De Lombaert and Onsager's application has yet to gain
the broad appeal of its competitor. The Graffiti Wall is widely
regarded as one of the top applications on Facebook, both in
popularity and written online reviews.
The question, then, is why?
Fart II: Viral Growth
Neither party took strong action to promote its new Face
book application at first.The group members placed the applica
tions on their respective profiles, eschewing any advertising or
advanced marketing techniques.
"Quirkily enough.only we used it at first," said De Lombaert,
explaining that their friends eventually saw the program as he
and Onsager wrote on each other's walls. "When we launched,
we were just excited to share."
While Tim Suzman and his partners chose the same route as
the Stanford students, their application was picked up by the

community far faster
than its competitor.

"When we launched, we
didn't tell any friends," Suzman

said. "We put [Graffiti Wall] on our

own profiles to see what would hap
pen just virally."
For the Graffiti Wall creators, this

viral growth was immediate — and explosive.
The number of Graffiti Wall users grew exponential-

ly from 40 users at the end of the first day to more than 1 million
after merely eight days.
While both groups initially used the same tactic to market
their product, they did have different end results in mind.
"If their graffiti [application] was the PC" De Lombaert said,
"ours was the Mac. We were always in it for the fun."
Suzman's goals were always more concrete and tangible in
comparison to his Stanford counterparts.
Where De Lombaert and Onsager saw an outlet for creativi
ty and entertainment, the Suzman team was reaching for some-
