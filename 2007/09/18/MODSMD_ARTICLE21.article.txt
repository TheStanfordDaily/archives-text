# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Construction projects underway all across campus 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
As hordes of new students pour onto cam
pus today and throughout the next week,
they will likely notice construction in promi
nent places.
Students accustomed to racing through
White Plaza and the notorious intersection
of Death" will now be slowed by two bicycle
roundabouts installed this summer by the
University's Department of Planning.
The roundabouts will help divert traffic
flow around two permanent structures, one
at the southern end of Lasuen Mall in front of
the clock tower and one at the northern en
trance to White Plaza. New sidewalks will
also be installed to separate pedestrians from
the stream of bicycles that pass through one
of Stanford's busiest thoroughfares.
"The goal is to slow down students," said
Kathy Blake, associate director of Campus
Planning and Design. "Right now people go
through the intersections full speed ahead,
and it can be very dangerous."
According to construction plans for the
roundabouts, students will travel counter
clockwise around one of the turnarounds and
into a two-lane straightaway between the
Barnum Center and Building 500 that will di
rect them into a second roundabout.
Ground-painted bike traffic signs are expect
ed to help direct bicyclers through the inter
change.
The roundabouts are part of a larger mas
ter plan to redesign the center of campus.
Other projects include the renovation of Old
Union and plans to create more lawn space in
White Plaza in order to improve available
space for performance events.
Blake said that students, faculty and staff
who participated in interviews and work
shops identified the locations for the planned
roundabouts as a source of major concern
given the heavy volume of traffic in these
areas during a normal day. She also noted
that, while a trend in bike collisions was not
the original impetus for the design concept,
anecdotal evidence of reported collisions
and nervous pedestrians crossing into the in
tersections drove calls for the roundabouts.
"In transportation planning, bike circles
are all over the place and have been very suc
cessful," Blake said, citing similar structures
at UC-Davis and other locations. "It will be
interesting to see how the construction will
go since we don't have a culture of bike cir
cles on campus yet."
Last year, the Stanford Band constructed
a rudimentary roundabout in front of the
clock tower to help improve traffic flow.
Blake said that, while plans for the round
abouts were already being considered at that
time, the Band's efforts helped accelerate the
implementation of the project. Planning offi
cials also reduced the amount of landscaping
inside the circles so as to make room for stu
dent artwork and design concepts after stu
dents adorned last year's makeshift structure
with a sculpture and some decorations.
While the students with whom Blake
spoke welcomed the changes, others worried
that the roundabouts might impede traffic
flow.
"I've had some close calls," Aaron Kof
man '09 said. "But bikers are capable of nav
igating the intersection themselves. It seems
like everything will slow down and make
passing through more difficult."
In addition to the bike circles, bulldozers
will continue to buzz around campus this fall
as construction continues on the Munger res
idential complex and the underground
Wilbur Field parking structure. While the
parking garage is expected to be completed
later this academic year, students will have to
wait until 2009 for the opening of the Munger
complex — construction delays have pushed
back the project's start date.
The Munger housing project will provide

358 residential units for 600 graduate stu
dents. The four-level Wilbur Field under
ground parking structure will include 1,187
parking stalls and is scheduled to open in
March 2008.
Construction on the sites began in Febru
ary 2006 but experienced setbacks early in
the process.
"Start of construction was delayed about
eight months to allow for a better bidding en
vironment for the project's buy-out and to
accommodate the availability of major sub
contractors," said Jack Cleary. associate vice
president of Land, Buildings and Real Es
tate.
Clear>' said that several associated proj
ects were completed during this delay time to
help streamline the construction of the actu
al residential complex, such as the realign
ment of Campus Drive and the relocation
and renovation of the five historical houses
that previously lined Salvatierra Walk.
As the Munger and Wilbur Field construc

tion projects get further off the ground, stu
dents may be woken by the noise as early as
7 a.m. during the upcoming school year:
Santa Clara County officials have approved
general construction hours from then until 7
p.m.. Monday through Saturday.
Noise reduction devices,construction tim
ing and other mitigation measures have been
implemented to minimize noise disturbance.
Nevertheless,some students worry about the
impact that the construction will have on
their residential experiences.
Rebecca Perez '08 will serve this year as
an ethnic theme associate in Casa Zapata,
which is adjacent to the Munger construction
site. She lived in Casa Zapata during her
sophomore year when the University began
to relocate the houses lining Salvatierra
Walk.
"When I left Zapata at the end of my

sophomore year, I would sometimes
get awoken by the construction,"
Perez said."But it wasn't that big of a
deal because 1 would need to get up
early anyway to go to class or run er
rands."
Perez instead cited larger con
cerns about the impact of construc
tion on the dorm community in sur
rounding residences. She worried
that with fewer people occupying
Casa Zapata — due to the conver
sion of the dorm's doubles into single
rooms — the dynamic of the dorm
may be adversely affected.
"The Zapata 1 knew was definite
ly not the same after the first year of
construction,"she said."! worry that
with fewer people it will be much
quieter and less active in the Stan
ford community. In a way, the con
struction could really restrict the
personality of the dorm."
Other projects are also in the
works for the upcoming year. Ac
cording to Cleary. construction will
also be completed later this year on
the Yang and Yamazaki Environ
ment and Energy Building, the first
of four buildings that will make up a
second Science and Engineering
Quad. Demolition of the W. W,
Hansen Experimental Physics Labo
ratory complex later this year will
also clear the way for construction of
the School of Engineering Center
and the Nanotechnology Center, the
second and third buildings of the
new quad.

Construction is in progress for the four-level Wilbur field parking structure, which will include 1,187 parking stalls and is scheduled to open in March 2008. Construction began in February 2006.
