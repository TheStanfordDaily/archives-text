## ASSU executives share plans for year Avula and Jones answer questions about goals 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
ASSU President Hershey Avula
08 and Vice President Mondaire
Jones '09 have already taken steps to
accomplish their campaign promises.
In an email to The Daily, they de
tailed their accomplishments thus
far, as well as their plans for the up
coming year.
T he Daily: What should incoming
freshmen know about the ASSU?
What are its strengths and weakness
es in regard to addressing students'
concerns?
Avula/Jones: Freshmen should
know that the ASSU represents all of
them. It stands for the Associated
Students of Stanford University and
is meant to advocate on behalf of all
student interests. The strengths are
that it represents all students and is
the most powerful advocacy group
on campus. We also have the re
sources and passionate leaders a
group needs to accomplish change at
Stanford and address students' con
cerns. The biggest weakness is that
students often do not feel comfort
able coming to the ASSU and often
do not know what it really does. Also,
because we are supposed to repre
sent all students, we sometimes fail to
direct adequate attention to niche
groups of students.
The Daily: Since freshman year,
you've both been involved in various
aspects of the ASSU. How will you
apply what you have learned to your
leadership in the coming year?
Avula/Jones: We hope to apply
[what we've learned) toward increas
ing the credibility of the ASSU as a
beacon of student advocacy and are
proud to see the successes we have
already achieved over the spring and
summer quarters in areas like cost of
living. Old Union and social pro
gramming.
The Daily: During your cam
paign. you mentioned several lofty
goals, such as expanding study
abroad, encouraging sustainability
and promoting graduate and faculty
diversity. Is it really in your power to
make these happen? What practical
steps will you take?
Avula/Jones: Our most important
promise is to give these projects our
best effort, and —at the risk of
sounding radical — that could mean
anything legal and within reason.
The Daily: One of your goals was
to create an ASSU-sponsored air
port shuttle. Are you considering any
changes to this plan in light of the
trial run in June?
Avula/Jones: Certainly. The trial
run. while successful in light of the
constraints it faced, can stand to be
improved. We expect the Ihiinksgiv
ing period to increase the numbers
we saw in the spring drastically. We
also are considering asking Parking
& Transportation Services to sub
contract a different company.

The Daily: It seems like a lot of
students are behind reviving Course
Guide. Could you explain what this is
to freshmen and the practical steps
you'll take to bring it back?
Avula/Jones: Actually, we have
already taken the steps necessary to
revive the Course Guide. Check one
off on our long list of things to do, 1
guess. The Registrar has made a
commitment to the ASSU Execu
tives that course evaluation data
will be available to students online
through Axess beginning in the fall.
For all incoming frosh: the Course
Guide used to be a copy of student
reviews of classes. The new Course
Guide will be available online and
will allow all students to see how
their peers evaluated the content of
each course and the professors who
taught them.
T he Daily: You mentioned anoth
er Stanford tradition, Big Game
Bonfire. What obstacles will you
have to overcome to revive this event
as well?
Avula/Jones:To be honest, the ob
stacles standing in the way of the Big
Game Bonfire are both numerous
and substantial. For starters — and
this is probably most important —
we were recently told we couldn't do
the bonfire by Stanford's senior land
use group. To make up for this, we're
working with the Stanford Concert
Network to ensure an amazing Big
Game Concert as well as organizing
a memorable Row Block Party that
same weekend.
The Daily: What are your goals in
relation to the Office of Student Af
fairs (OS A)?
Avula/Jones: For starters, we
hope to serve as an effective media
tor between student groups and the
OSA. More specifically, we hope to
work with the OSA on its plan to cre
ate a new Web site that will take to
heart many of the suggestions
brought forth by students at last
spring's Dean of Students SWOT
(Strength, Weakness, Opportunity
and Threats) sessions. We hope this
Web site will go a long way toward
making policies more transparent
and easily accessible to students, as
well as create a forum for complaints.
The Daily: In your opinion, what
accomplishments will make this year
at Stanford a success?
Avula/Jones. Restoring the credi
bility of the ASSU through success
ful advocacy work and relatively
flawless, large-scale social events;
making the new Old Union the hub
of student life on campus: more pro
grams that reduce costs for students;
successful promotion of the sustain
ability ideakgettingthe University to
adopt more practical and visible
steps toward improving faculty and
graduate student diversity: a greater
focus on graduate student advocacy
issues; making students feel comfort
able coming to the ASSU with their
concerns; and, while we have no con
trol over this. Stanford going to a
bowl game!
