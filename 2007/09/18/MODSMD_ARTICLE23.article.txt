What do Dean Larry Kramer and Profs.
Pamela Karlan and Robert Weisberg J.D.'79 of the
Law School have in common, other than having
clerked for Supreme Court justices in their
younger days? All three will join nine colleagues
to lecture a class designed specifically for non-law
students in the Law School's new offering."Think
ing Like a Lawyer."
The class, in which 12 law faculty will attempt to
provide a survey of the central facets of the legal
profession in a single quarter, is both ambitious
and unprecedented.
"This is an experimental class." Kramer said.
"We don't know if it's going to work, but if it does
it's going to be amazing. There's nothing like this
anywhere."
Kramer and other law faculty said that they be
lieved a summary of the legal profession is rele
vant for a variety of graduate students in the hu
manities. business and the sciences.
"I think this course, at [its] core, is about giving
students in the University who are interested in
law, cither because they're going to be interacting
with laws and the legal system as part of their pro

fessional life or in their dissertations or academic
studies, the opportunity to get a really thoughtful,
conceptual overview of some of the issues that
legal academics and lawyers face," said Vice Dean
Mark Kelman.
"We think that our discipline has a sort of core,"
agreed Kramer. "There's a mix of core principles
and a way of thinking about them. If you under
stand that and you're out in the world confronting
what's weird about the law. it'll seem less weird."
To convey this basic understanding, the course
will expose graduate students to a variety of topics
in the legal profession, from criminal and constitu
tional law to bankruptcy and investor protections.
Participating faculty members will lecture one to
three classes apiece in their areas of expertise,
meaning that students will be immediately ex
posed to scholars on the cutting edges of their re
spective fields.
"We tried to identify among our faculty people
who within particular fields would be the best pro
fessors for helping people get to the core of that
field," Kramer said. "The idea is that we're going to
be exposing graduate students to many different
perspectives, which will make it more interesting."
"We had to coordinate a lot of different peo
ple." said Kelman. "It's not just me sitting there
teaching a subject that 1 know a little bit about
from law school."
The result promises to be a whirlwind tour of
the legal profession. Karlan.a leading national ex

three hours — to instill the basic principles of con
stitutional law into her students.
"I don't think you have to adjust your teaching
style, you just have to adjust the kind of material
you present." she said. "You're going to have to hit
some of the high points."
Kelman said he came up with the idea 15
months ago while he was sitting on the Committee
on Graduate Education.
"We were dealing with a lot of issues on the
growth of interdisciplinary education and the ways
