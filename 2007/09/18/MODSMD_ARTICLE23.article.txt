## New law school course appeals to all Course teaches graduate students in all fields how to think like a lawyer 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
What do Dean Larry Kramer and Profs.
Pamela Karlan and Robert Weisberg J.D.'79 of the
Law School have in common, other than having
clerked for Supreme Court justices in their
younger days? All three will join nine colleagues
to lecture a class designed specifically for non-law
students in the Law School's new offering."Think
ing Like a Lawyer."
The class, in which 12 law faculty will attempt to
provide a survey of the central facets of the legal
profession in a single quarter, is both ambitious
and unprecedented.
"This is an experimental class." Kramer said.
"We don't know if it's going to work, but if it does
it's going to be amazing. There's nothing like this
anywhere."
Kramer and other law faculty said that they be
lieved a summary of the legal profession is rele
vant for a variety of graduate students in the hu
manities. business and the sciences.
"I think this course, at [its] core, is about giving
students in the University who are interested in
law, cither because they're going to be interacting
with laws and the legal system as part of their pro

fessional life or in their dissertations or academic
studies, the opportunity to get a really thoughtful,
conceptual overview of some of the issues that
legal academics and lawyers face," said Vice Dean
Mark Kelman.
"We think that our discipline has a sort of core,"
agreed Kramer. "There's a mix of core principles
and a way of thinking about them. If you under
stand that and you're out in the world confronting
what's weird about the law. it'll seem less weird."
To convey this basic understanding, the course
will expose graduate students to a variety of topics
in the legal profession, from criminal and constitu
tional law to bankruptcy and investor protections.
Participating faculty members will lecture one to
three classes apiece in their areas of expertise,
meaning that students will be immediately ex
posed to scholars on the cutting edges of their re
spective fields.
"We tried to identify among our faculty people
who within particular fields would be the best pro
fessors for helping people get to the core of that
field," Kramer said. "The idea is that we're going to
be exposing graduate students to many different
perspectives, which will make it more interesting."
"We had to coordinate a lot of different peo
ple." said Kelman. "It's not just me sitting there
teaching a subject that 1 know a little bit about
from law school."
The result promises to be a whirlwind tour of
the legal profession. Karlan.a leading national ex

three hours — to instill the basic principles of con
stitutional law into her students.
"I don't think you have to adjust your teaching
style, you just have to adjust the kind of material
you present." she said. "You're going to have to hit
some of the high points."
Kelman said he came up with the idea 15
months ago while he was sitting on the Committee
on Graduate Education.
"We were dealing with a lot of issues on the
growth of interdisciplinary education and the ways
we thought students could benefit
from exposure to the rest of the I Uni
versity." Kelman said. Although he
entered the Committee looking for
ways law students could gain from
exposure to other departments, Kel
man said he began thinking about
what the Law School could provide
for other graduate students.
"1 realized there are people in po
litical science, education. Manage
ment Science and Engineering (MS
& L) and the Business School who
are dealing with legal questions and
are dealing with lawyers a lot," he
said. "I thought it was an interesting
thing we might be able to offer to
people from the rest of the Universi
ty."
Difficulties remain for the new
course, however. Despite the ambi
tions of its architects and the all-star
faculty lineup which is set to teach it.
"Thinking Like a Lawyer" has strug
gled to attract students.
To publicize the course. Kramer
said that the Law School contacted
deans and department chairs at the
University's other schools, as well as
faculty in departments in which they
felt the most interest existed. Ihey
asked these faculty to pass the word
on to their students.

•• Thirty people signed up: there
ought to be 3(K) people signed up,"
Kramer said.
But he ehalked up the low enroll
ment to the fledgling status of the
class.
"Even among graduate students,
the vast majority of course selection
is based on a sort of grapevine," he
said. "It takes time for changes in
curriculum to make their wav into"
the student consciousness.
ITie students who do plan to take
the course are enthusiastic.
"The main reason I'm taking it is
academic curiosity," Alex Smyth 05.
who is pursuing a master's degree in
MS & E. wrote in an email to The
Daily."The lecture topics look inter
esting and the lecturers distin
guished."
Smyth said he is also considering
attending I aw School in the future
and plans to use the class as a "very
basic introduction" to the field. He
heard about the class from a flier
sent to the MS & IE chat list.
According to Kelman. "Thinking
Like a Lawyer" was designed for stu
dents like Smyth, lie said the I aw
School plans to continue the course
next year.
"Our plan is to do it again if it
goes well." he said. "If there's de
