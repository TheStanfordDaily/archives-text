## Gov. vows to veto gay marriage bill Schwarzenegger holds firm in commitment 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger said Mon
day that he won't reconsider his deci
sion to veto a bill legalizing guy mar
i iage and will keep vetoing the meas
ure ;ts long as lawmakers send it to
him.
The Republican governor said he
won't change his position unless vot
ers overturn an anti-gay marriage
initiative that Californians adopted
in 2000.
"It would be wrong for the people
to vote for something and for me to
then overturn it." Schwarzenegger
said. "So they can send this bill down
as many times as they want. I won't

do it."
The bill would redefine marriage
as a civil contract between two peo
ple. but would still let religious
groups refuse to sanction the unions.
Schwarzenegger vetoed a gay
marriage bill in 2005, citing the (>1
percent of voters who favored
Proposition 22 in March 2000.
He announced in February that
he would veto the bill again if it
reached his desk this year. Despite
the announcement, lawmakers ap
proved it before adjourning last
week.
Sehwarznegger has until Oct. 14
to act on the measure.
Geoff Kors, executive director of
the gay rights organization Equality
California, said Proposition 22 only
bars California from recognizing
same-sex marriages performed out
side California.
The gay marriage bill, by Assem
blvman Mark Leno, D-San Francis-

Co. would amend a different section
of law that covers marriages per
formed in California.
Kors said he hopes Schwarzeneg
ger sticks by earlier comments that
he will abide by the state Supreme
Court's ultimate decision on whether
California's ban on same-sex mar
riage ban is unconstitutional. Hie
high court's ruling could come next
year.
"We're extremely disappointed
he is taking a position on the bill
without meeting with a single les
bian-gay family, as we have asked
him to do the last two years." Kors
said."l low would he feel if this was
a bill affecting who he could
marry?"
Schwarzenegger's comments
were in response to a question during
a Capitol news conference on an en
dorsement of his health care plan by
the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce.
