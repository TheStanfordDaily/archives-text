SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Facebook Inc. is offer
ing to pay up to $250,000 to software developers who
create applications that help make its rapidly growing
online social network an even more compelling Inter
net hangout.
The new incentives, announced Monday evening
by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbergat a high-tech
conference, are part of a $10 million fund financed by
Accel Partners and Ihe Founders Fund, a pair of ven
ture capital firms already connected to the Palo Alto
based company.
Accel is one of Facebook's biggest stockholders,
while The Founders' Fund is run by Pay Pal co
founder Peter Thiel, an early investor in the company
who remains on its board of directors.
The fund will give grants ranging from $25,000 to
$250,000 to developers interested in building appli
cations for the platform. The awards will be deter
mined by a panel that includes Zuckerberg,Thiel and
Accel partner Jim Breyer. who also sits on Face-

book's board.
Any developer who hasn't already raised ven
ture capital will be eligible to apply for the grants.
Recipients must agree to give Accel and The
Founders Fund the first chance to invest in any
business that sprouts from the applications placed
on Face book.
ITie call for more software applications marks the
latest step in Facebook's evolution from a Web site
that once was primarily a place for college students to
flirt and exchange information.
Facebook finally began accepting non-students
last year and then, four months ago, set up a platform
to make it easier for outside applications to run on its
site.
That has proven to be a boon for other sites like
music-sharing service iLike.com and photo-sharing
service Slide Inc. that built popular applications on
Facebook.
Those applications in turn have helped make Face
book even more popular, although it still ranks as the
second most trafficked Internet social network be
