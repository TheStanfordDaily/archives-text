CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -
Here's a dream-come-true for Web
addicts: college credit for watching
You Tube.
Pitzer College this fall began of
fering what may be the first-ever
course about the video-sharing site.
About 35 students meet in a class
room but work mostly online, where
they view You Tube content and post
their comments.
Class lessons also are taped and
posted. Students are encouraged to
post videos. One class member, for
instance, posted a 1:36-minute video
of himself juggling.
Alexandra Juhasz, a media stud
ies professor at the liberal arts col
lege. said she was "underwhelmed"
by the content on You Tube but set up

the course, "Learning from
You Tube." to explore the role of the
hugely popular site.
Class members control most of
the class content and You Tube
watchers from around the world are
encouraged to comment, Juhasz said.
She hopes the course will raise
some serious issues about You Tube.
such as the role of "corporate-spon
sored democratic media expression."
according to her Sept. 4 posting.
"I would like (the students) to be
more self-aware consumers and pro
ducers within the media culture that
they've inherited," Juhasz told the
Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.
You Tube is "a phenomenon that
should be studied," student Darren
Grose said. "You can learn a lot
about American culture and just In
ternet culture in general."
