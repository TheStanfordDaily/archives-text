## Football overpowers San Jose State in 37-0 romp for first win in new stadium, improves to 1 -1 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The lowly San Jose State Spartans (0-3) were just
what the doctor ordered: Stanford (1-1) claimed its
first win in 308 days — its first in the new stadium
and its first under rookie Coach Jim Harbaugh.
Toby Gerhart, the bruising sophomore tailback,
blew the game open early in the third quarter on an
eye-popping run. He started to his right and hit two

holes just before closing with quick, decisive cuts.
Tacklers grasped and missed, Gerhart's out
stretched left arm shed the last defender and Stan
ford had a 13-yard touchdown and 16-0 lead. The
Spartans never threatened again.
"I loved him. 1 really did," Harbaugh said of Ger
hart. "He really brought a balance to our game, a phys
ical presence. He was dragging people, knocking them
off the ball."
Gerhart was tackled from behind on his
longest run of the day, a 48-yarder in the second
quarter that would have otherwise gone for six.
But what he lacks in speed he makes up for in
power, vision and a nose for daylight otherwise
missing from the tailback corps. He is finally
healthy after an injury-filled freshmen year, and
with No. 12 Oregon, undefeated Arizona State,
No. 1 USC and a deceptively tough TCU on deck,
the timing couldn't be any better.
"1 think times are changing," Gerhart said.
"Hopefully we can build on this and keep run
ning."
Senior place kicker Derek Belch set Stanford
en route to 37 points — four more than it scored
in last year's five home games combined. His 52-
yarder in the first quarter was Stanford's longest
field goal in eight years, and his 37 and 50-yarders
in the second quarter gave the Cardinal a 9-0
halftime lead.
"Coacjh .Harbaugh, Coach Durkin looked at
me and a:ikcd If I thought I could make it," Belch
said of his first kick. "When they ask you, that
means they have confidence that you know what
you can do, you're the decision maker. So I pret
ty much walked out there and said, 'Alright, it's
going in."'
The offensive line pass-protected beautifully
for senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander, who hit his
rhythm in .the fourth quarter. His 46-yard pass to
a wide open Richard Sherman made the score 23-
0, senior tailback Anthony Kimble (80 yards)
added a 14-yard score a minute later and Ostran
der's 27-yard check-down to junior tight end
Austin Gunder provided the final margin.
Still, it was another poor showing for Ostran
der. especially considering the time he had to find

targets. An underthrown ball to double-covered
senior wide receiver Evan Moore in the end zone
was his only pick of the day, but he forced his re
ceivers into tougher catches and misfired more
than his 18-of-28 for 220 yards stats would sug
gest.
But there to bail out Ostrander was a defense
that gave San Jose State just 32 rushing yards, 163
total yards and 23 minutes of possession. The
Cardinal's defensive star was sophomore safety
Bo McNally, who broke up Adam Tarfalis'
fourth-down bootleg pass in the second quarter
and then picked off the Spartan quarterback in
the fourth quarter for the final nail in the coffin.
Before booking your trip to Pasadena, remem
ber that San Jose State has only scored 17 points
in three games this year and was missing its two
best tailbacks Saturday night. They looked like a
high school team at times, and SJSU Coach Dick
Tomey didn't hold back on his team.
"We were awful," he said. "We were badly
coached. We played bad."

The Cardinal, meanwhile, allowed UCLA 624
yards in the season-opener, so whether it can im
prove any against explosive Oregon will be a
much more decisive test.
A halftime ceremony honored the late legend
Bill Walsh, who played at SJSU and coached at
Stanford.
"1 know Bill Walsh was here tonight," Har
baugh said. "There were times 1 could just feel
like he was on the headset. There's just part of me
that believes he was looking over us tonight."
The Stanford Band also unleashed its funniest
performance in years at halftime. The Band pre
tended to have been reformed into a traditional
USC-style marching band, playing an emotionless
"All Right Now" and "Tribute to Tribute to Troy."
The Tree then escaped from his cage to knock
over the Band, and they were their old scattered
selves, right down to taking their time as they
formed the N in F-U-N.

minutes than the opponent does, snaps it 25 more times and converts a majority of its third downs, it's
going to have a number of opportunities to score.
The opportunities didn't go unfulfilled. The Cardinal offense settled foi field goals in the first half,

Time of possession: Stanford 37:17

7.7 yards per pass attempt and the over 60 percent completion rate are both very good for a ball
control passing game like Jim Harbaugh's West Coast scheme. When a team holds the ball for 14 more
minutes than the opponent does, snaps it 25 more times and converts a majority of its third downs, it's
going to have a number of opportunities to score.
The opportunities didn't go unfulfilled. The Cardinal offense settled foi field goals in the first half,
but pounding away at the Spartans' defense paid off for four touchdowns in the second half Control
ling the ball enhanced field position and kept San Jose State's opportunities — just seven offensive
plays in the critical third quarter — at a minimum.

Sophomore tailback Toby Gerhart sprints toward the end zone in Saturday's 37-0 shutout victory over San Jose State. Gerhart ran for 140 yards and a touchdown in the contest, which
was the Cardinal's first shutout win since 1996. The win improves Stanford's record to 1 -1 and was the Cardinal's first victory in the new stadium.
