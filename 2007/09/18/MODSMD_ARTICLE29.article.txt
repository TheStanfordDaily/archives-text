# Stanford Football 101
## 
### 
Every so often, I'm reminded of the
unique challenges we at The Stanford
Daily face on an annual basis. And, as
you've probably guessed from the lede, this is
one of those times.
Writing a column on Stanford football to
an audience that's probably going to consist
primarily of fresh guys and gals on the Farm is
an interesting challenge. Do I start with the
short-term prognosis (a terrifying slate of
games against Oregon. Arizona State, South
ern Cal and TCU) or the long-range hope
first-year Cardinal coach Jim Harbaugh has
rekindled in the program? The immediate
past of the team (horrific), or the storied his
tory of one of the nation's oldest (dating back
to 1892) football traditions?
It's probably best to stay in the here and
now. but, to help our new frosh friends out,
maybe a brief history lesson would help. Suf
fice it to say, you newcomers to the Farm
should be glad you weren't here to see the
Buddy Teevens or Walt Harris eras — you
didn't miss much. Well, aside from hopeless
ness and acrimony.
But that's in the past now, as Stanford
hired Walt Harris to replace the 10-23 Buddy
Teevens and Harbaugh to replace the 6-17
Harris. And for the first time in quite a while,
the team seems to have attracted a real air of
excitement. Not the kind of excitement that
would lead you to believe that a Pac-10 title is
just around the corner, but an enthusiasm
that, at the very least, seems to suggest the
Cardinal is, at long last, headed in the right di
rection.
It was an open secret in 2006 that the Car
dinal and their head coach were far from on
the same page. Some rumblings and rumors
suggested that, had Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby not decided to make a change fol
lowing the season. Harris would have had a
mutiny on his hands, with numerous players

supposedly unwilling to play for the coach for
another year.
Thankfully for the program and the play
ers, it didn't come to that, but the mere exis
tence of these rumors speaks volumes of just
how low the 1-11 Cardinal sank in 2006.
I relate to you these stories, ye formerly
happy and ignorant frosh, not to discourage,
but to put things in perspective. I m sure plen
ty of you came from places like Austin.
Gainesville or Los Angeles, where teams are
expected to win early and often.
And now that you newcomers know where
the Cardinal has been, maybe it's safe to tell
you where the team is going. Here and now,
the best we can hope for is probably gradual
and steady improvement. And so far, at least,
the Cardinal has delivered.
Since the day Harbaugh arrived and began
to put his stamp on the team, the players I've
spoken with have had their love for the game
rekindled. That may not match up to Har
baugh s promised "enthusiasm unknown to
mankind," but it's a big step up from previous
seasons.
And. hey, Stanford has already matched
last season's win total, and we're only two
games into the year. Downing San Jose State
at home 37-0 on Saturday was a major mile
stone for several reasons, not the least of
which was that it was a new head coach's first
victory and the Cardinal's first win in its new
home stadium — hopefully soon to be re
named after the late, truly great Bill Walsh.
But that's a topic for another column.
Maybe most importantly, in the 37-0 shut
out romp, Stanford handled an opponent it
had a chance to defeat. The team's schedule
certainly ranks among the most difficult in the
nation — the Cardinal faces the usual slate of
Pac-10 powerhouses as well as non-confer-


Denis
Griffin
Janls and Raves
ence terror TCU — so Stanford
needs to take the games it can win.
Long story short, a successful sea
son for Stanford in 2007 would look
significantly different from a success
ful season for any other team in the
conference. USC.for instance, is a na
tional title contender if they just win
every game they should. Cal is prob
ably competing for a Rose Bowl
berth if they just win the games they
should and a couple in which the tal
ent levels are close.
For Stanford to win just four
games, the Cardinal would have to
win every game in which its talent
level would lead you to believe it has
a chance and probably snatch at least
one win from a team that has it out
matched. That's the reality of the sit
uation following some of the darkest
seasons in the program's history.
Of course, as the intensity of Har
baugh and his team's renewed pas
sion for the game on and off the field
have shown, they won't necessarily
be satisfied with a "rebuilding" kind
of year. Nor should they be. consider
ing that, in the words of the single
greatest NFL quote producer of the
last 10 years. Herm Edwards. "Hello
- you play to win the game."
And for the Cardinal in its third

game of the season, that will mean
that last week's sensational sopho
more running hack Toby Gerhart,
who rushed for 140 yards and a
touchdown on 12 carries, will play a
big role in controlling the football. A
strong rushing game will help keep
the ball out of the hands of a danger
ous Oregon spread offense that fea
tures the spectacular Dennis Dixon
at quarterback and the bullish
Jonathan Stewart at running back. If
the Ducks have had a weakness this
season, it's been their run defense.
So now that you fresh frosh have
been warned on the Farm, you can
make the trek to the gorgeous Stan
ford Stadium, now in its second year,
and watch a team filled with a fresh
sense of purpose.
Fueled by exciting sophomores
like Gerhart, receiver Richard Sher
man and safety Bo McNally, the
team will also have a calming and
mature influence from veteran sen
iors likeT.C. Ostrander, Mark Brad
ford and Evan Moore, who have al
ready been to hell and back in their
time here.
Win or lose, I've already seen
enough from this team in '07 to see
that the program is changing, and,
given where it's been oh-so-recently,
that can't be a bad thing.

Denis Griffin is already sold on Jim
Harbaugh. If you possess "an enthusi
asm unknown to mankind" too, con
