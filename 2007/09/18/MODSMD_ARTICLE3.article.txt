High school students across the country so
eagerly anticipated U.S. News & World Re
port's 2008 college rankings that the publica
tion was actually embargoed to generate sus
pense. After claims of leaked rankings lit up
Internet blogs for weeks, the official rankings
were finally released on Aug. 17, met by a
firestorm of controversy about their pre
sumed importance.
Stanford remained fourth in the maga
zine's 2008 ranking — part of the annual
"America's Best Colleges" issue — trailing
behind only perennial list-toppers Princeton,
I larvard and Yale.
The ranking methodology takes into ac
count factors including the SAT scores of in
coming students, the percentage of freshmen
in the top 10 percent of their high school
class, the percentage of alumni who donate
and, the most controversial criterion of all.
"reputation" — a category in which college
presidents score institutions other than their
own.
"We're pleased to be recognized as one of
the top universities in the country." said Jeff
Wachtel '79, special assistant to President
John Hennessy.
The rankings have received much criti
cism this year as a rising tide of university
presidents, education advocates and com
mentators have decried the list as misrepre
sentative of the mission of higher education
Their cries against the rankings echoed
the sentiments of former University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper in the mid-19905.
Casper declared in an open letter to U.S.
News & World Report that universities can
no more easily be ranked than magazines.
