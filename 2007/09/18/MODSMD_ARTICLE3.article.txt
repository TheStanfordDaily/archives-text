## Stanford takes fourth in rankings

High school students across the country so
eagerly anticipated U.S. News & World Re
port's 2008 college rankings that the publica
tion was actually embargoed to generate sus
pense. After claims of leaked rankings lit up
Internet blogs for weeks, the official rankings
were finally released on Aug. 17, met by a
firestorm of controversy about their pre
sumed importance.
Stanford remained fourth in the maga
zine's 2008 ranking — part of the annual
"America's Best Colleges" issue — trailing
behind only perennial list-toppers Princeton,
I larvard and Yale.
The ranking methodology takes into ac
count factors including the SAT scores of in
coming students, the percentage of freshmen
in the top 10 percent of their high school
class, the percentage of alumni who donate
and, the most controversial criterion of all.
"reputation" — a category in which college
presidents score institutions other than their
own.
"We're pleased to be recognized as one of
the top universities in the country." said Jeff
Wachtel '79, special assistant to President
John Hennessy.
The rankings have received much criti
cism this year as a rising tide of university
presidents, education advocates and com
mentators have decried the list as misrepre
sentative of the mission of higher education
Their cries against the rankings echoed
the sentiments of former University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper in the mid-19905.
Casper declared in an open letter to U.S.
News & World Report that universities can
no more easily be ranked than magazines.
calling the list "utterly misleading."
Lloyd Thacker, director of the
Education Conservancy, a Portland,
Oregon-based advocacy group and
think-tank, is building an alliance of
college presidents against the rank
ings. Thus far. 64 presidents have
signed a letter refusing to submit the
statistical data that forms the back
bone of the rankings.
Wachtel said that Stanford will
continue to submit data for the rank
ing system.
"(The rankings] do not affect
Stanford's behavior much," he said.
"We are pursuing a path we think is
right.The rankings have no effect on
the faculty's approach to research."
While Wachtel claimed Stanford

was above succumbing to ranking
mania, Thacker argued that some
schools want nothing more than to
boost their status.
"Rankings become important for
self-image and portraying success,"
he said.
Thacker noted that need-based
aid at universities has remained con
stant in the past decade while merit
based aid has increased six fold as
colleges more aggressively pursue
high-scoring students in an effort to
gain ground in the rankings.
Stanford does not offer merit
based aid.
"It's irresponsible to rank col
leges," Thacker said. "The rankings
imply a degree of precision and au
thority that is not supported by edu
cational research. They do not meas
ure what really matters in higher ed
ucation."
The rankings have spawned an
entire industry that Thacker said

amounts to more than $4 billion an
nually. Management consultants for
universities alone account for $1 bil
lion of that total. Thacker said the
figures reflected the "commercial
ization of higher education."
Many components of the rank
ings are arbitrary, according to
Thacker. The "alumni giving rate"
measures the percentage of alumni
who donated, which he said is much
more about the slickness of a univer
sity's fundraising campaign than
"alumni satisfaction." as U.S. News &
World Report claims.
The "alumni giving rate" category
also fails to measure the dollar
amount of donations. For example,
about 39 percent of alumni donated
to Stanford last year, but the Univer
sity raised a total of $903 million,
much of that money coming from
other sources. Princeton, on the
other hand, raised only about $250
million, but 61 percent of alumni

contributed, and the New Jersey
school was consequently ranked
higher in the "alumni giving rate"
category.
School of Education Prof.
Denise Clark Pope '88, who has
publicly advocated for a less stress
ful college admissions process, also
denounced the ranking system as
creating undue pressure for high
school students.
"[The rankings] are adding to the
problem instead of being the solu
tion," she said. "There's a misconcep
tion that highest-ranked is best.They
foster an incorrect message that
everyone should strive for the high
est-ranked schools.
"It's crazy to rank schools on an
overall basis," she added. "Each per
son is looking for different compo
nents."
