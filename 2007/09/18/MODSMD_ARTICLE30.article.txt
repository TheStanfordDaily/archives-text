# Oregon to provide tough test
## Cardinal could be hard pressed to stop Ducks' high-powered offense 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It may still be summer, but don't be fooled
— Saturday's visit from Oregon might just be
Stanford's most important game of the sea
son.
The Cardinal's first two games were
blowouts that played perfectly to form and
revealed little. UCLA torched Stanford's
suspect pass defense 45-17 in the season
opener before the Cardinal rebounded to
run over undermanned San Jose State 37-0
last Saturday, just as expected.
So Saturday night, under the glare of the
stadium lights and the eyes of thousands of
new students, Jim Harbaugh will find out
whether he has made any progress in his nine
months here. His team will see if it belongs on
the same field as one of the Pac-10's best.
Stanford faced Oregon twice under Walt
Harris, and both times the Cardinal got
creamed. Oregon just had too much speed,
from running back Jonathan Stewart (once
the top tailback recruit in the nation), to
wideouts now playing on Sundays, to Dennis
Dixon, their whirling dervish of a quarter
back. Harris was fired because he lost his
team after too many one-sided defeats like
these, and on came Jim I larbaugh, who's con
vinced a team and a fanbase that the Cardinal
will bow to no one.
On paper. No. 13 Oregon's every strength
seems perfectly calibrated to exploit a Stan
ford weakness or neutralize a Cardinal
strength. Defensively, the Ducks' front seven
is nothing special, but their secondary is
something fierce. Corners Jairus Byrd and
Walter Thurmond are both proven, top
notch starters, and safety Patrick Chung

might just he the best of the hunch — his po
sition coach compares him to NFL star
Shawne Merriman.
Bad news for Stanford, whose receiving
corps of sophomore Richard Sherman and
seniors Mark Bradford and Evan Moore
headlines the offense. Last season's quarter
hack, Trent Edwards, did throw for 224 yards
last year against Oregon (3-0), but unless sen
ior quarterback T.C. Ostrander can drastical
ly improve his accuracy to Edwards' level, he
won't match even that modest statistic on
Saturday.
That puts scoring largely in the hands (if
Stanford's rushing attack. The Cardinal ran
for 276 yards in last week's shutout of San
Jose State but mustered only 52 ground yards
against UCLA. Stanford's offensive line
needs to create rushing lanes as well as it has
been pass blocking of late, the coaching staff
needs to start sophomore back Toby Gerhart
— by far the team's best threat — and Ger
hart needs to do something special with his
touches if Stanford wants to keep it close.
The Cardinal offense has such little mar
gin for error because Oregon's attack has
looked downright unstoppable thus far. It
starts with offensive coordinator Gary Crow
ton's spread scheme that has taken college
football by storm this decade. The look un
veils four- or five-receiver sets, forcing oppos
ing defenses to keep up with the speed on the
perimeter. So far this season, no one's been
up to the challenge: the Ducks have scored
48,39 and 52 points in blowouts of defenses
easily as stout as Stanford's.
Dixon is threat number one. In Michael
Vick-like fashion. Dixon has completed 65
percent of his passes for 565 yards, seven
touchdowns and no interceptions this season,
and has run for 276 yards and three scores.
Stanford's green defensive ends — senior
Udeme Udofia, junior Pannel Egboh and
sophomores Griffin and Erik Lorig —
will need to stay wide to contain the mobile

senior.
Of course, that slows any pass rush and
opens lanes for Stewart, who is merely aver
aging 7.5 yards per carry and would likely
start for any Pac-10 school save IJSC. Safety
Bo McNally can continue to provide aggres
sive run support, but it's on Stanford's line
hackers to make quicker reads and crash the
rushing lanes hard. That's a tall order for a
group that lost Michael Okwo, last year's de
fensive MVP, to the NFL Draft and may have
lost this season's star, sophomore Clinton
Snyder, to a pinched nerve last week.
Even if the Cardinal can do what Hous
ton, Michigan and Fresno State have not and
somehow slow the Ducks' rush attack, that
still leaves the matter of receivers Brian
Paysinger and Jaison Williams, who have
combined for 20 catches, 319 yards and four
touchdowns on the young season. Aside from
McNally, Stanford's secondary has really
struggled, so unless God's a Stanford fan, it
looks like it's going to be a long Saturday for
the defense.
While the task is tall, the stakes are even
higher. This is what a top-20 team looks like,
and if Stanford wants to be one anytime
soon, it better show something Saturday at 7
p.m. An outright win is probably too tall an
order for the double-digit underdog Cardi
nal. But to fight, to show the fans and recruits
needed to turn this mess around that Stan
ford could one day soon beat a ranked team
like Oregon, this is a must.
Ihat's doubly true considering that the
Ducks kick off the hardest stretch of the
schedule — undefeated Arizona State and
No. 1 USC are on deck. And if the football
team doesn't want to lose yet another year of
would-be freshmen fans to Harris-like in
competence, it better show some life on Sat
urday.
