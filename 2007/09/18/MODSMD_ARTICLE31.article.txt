# UCLA pounds Cardinal in opener
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Jim Harbaugh era started much the same
way the Walt Harris era ended — in lopsided de
feat. Still, even in a 45-17 UCLA rout, Stanford
showed flashes of respectability missing from the
Farm since Tyrone Willingham patrolled the side
lines here six years ago. Only the upcoming weeks
will tell whether those glimmers of hope will prove
to be mirages or the start of something bigger.
"A lot of positive things 1 can see from the
field." said Harbaugh. "I don't think the score was
indicative of how we played. 1 think we've got a
football team now."
That was the mood in the Stanford locker room
and among the Cardinal faithful Saturday after
noon.
An offensive line that yielded an NCAA-high
50 sacks last year stopped the revolving door im
pression and started playing like a unit. Senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander was sacked four times
but was only hurried on a few others, despite a ca
reer-high 59 pass attempts on the afternoon.
"They definitely did better today," junior tail
back Anthony Kimble said. "Guys sticking on
guys, guys noi blowing assignments — 1 feel like
the line this year has a great understanding of the
scheme."
Unlike last year, the players and the playcallers
fought until the end, as the Harris quick kick has
made way for the Harbaugh onside kick. That's a
change 24 months too late, even though a third
quarter Aaron Zagory squib failed badly, leading
to a quick UCLA touchdown.
More importantly, Harbaugh displayed a
gameday awareness his predecessor sorely lacked.
He saw his offense was outmatched between the
tackles and was wise enough not to belabor the
point, instead giving his playmakers — tailback

Anthony Kimble, receivers Mark Bradford and
Richard Sherman and a strong cadre of tight ends
— the ball on the perimeter, in position to go one
on-one with Bruin defenders.
The players stepped up to the challenge. Kim
ble ran for 71 yards on 14 touches, and sophomore
tight end Jim Dray caught Stanford's first touch
down of the season on a nine-yard left-to-right
drag route just before the halftime horn.
But Stanford's most explosive play of the day
belonged to sophomore Sherman, who used
UCLA's aggressive defensive scheme to his ad
vantage on a slant-and-go route in the third quar
ter. An early fake to the inside saw Sherman shred
one corner and receive an Ostrander lob all alone
on the left sideline. The coup de grace came mo
ments later, as Sherman paused to let two defend
ers over-pursue, only to cut inside and sprint the
final 30 yards to paydirt untouched.
"We had seen them jumping on slants all day.
jumping, jumping, and 1 told Coach about it, and
he gave me the play I wanted." Sherman said. "I
saw him bite and just put my head down and ran as
fast as 1 could. I saw the DB [defensive back] had
an angle on me, so I acted like 1 was going to go for
the score, but 1 cut back and took it in. It looked
like I kind of surprised both of the DBs because
they pretty much froze, so it was a great feeling."
But amidst the hoopla, the team and the fans
seemed to gloss over what went wrong. And there
was plenty.
ITie defense struggled mightily. The Bruins
racked up 624 yards. 338 of them on the ground.
Running back Kahlil Bell ran over, around and
through a Cardinal front seven for 195 yards and
three scores. The 6.8 yards per carry allowed is a
bad omen for a unit expected to tie among the
team's worst.
The bigger disappointment, then, was a defen
sive backfield that UCLA quarterback Ben

Olson and friends torched for 286 yards and five
scores. UCLA's receivers, who pale in compari
son to the conference's elite units at Cai and
USC,beat returning cornerbacksTim Sims a sen
ior. and junior Wopamo Osaisai for four touch
downs. The entire secondary struggled, especially
on fade routes, often not locating the ball until
too late, if at all.
It was Ostrander's first start removed from
Trent Edwards' shadow, and it showed. He strug
gled with his accuracy and timing, misfiring on sev
eral deep balls and slants. Postgame, Harbaugh
called his gunslinger "gutty," but it seems likely
that questions about his arm are preventing the
coaches from fully exploring the offensive play
book.
Stanford's running attack also didn't do much,
netting just 52 yards on 26 carries. The fact that
banging sophomore tailback Toby Gerhart was a
gameday scratch (hamstring injury) didn't help
matters, nor did a dominant UCLA defense re
turning 10 starters from last year. Even so, run
ning between the tackles is the most fundamental
element of organized football, and Stanford's
line, one of the Pac-10's most experienced, needs
to start run-blocking as well as it pass-protected.
UCLA struck first on Olson's 19-yard fade to
Joe Cowan, and a six-yard fade to Gavin
Ketchum made it 14-0 just 38 seconds into the
second quarter. Dray's score halved the deficit
before halftime, but UCLA responded with
touchdown strikes to Dominiq Johnson and
Cowan to push their lead to 28-10 in the mid
third. Stanford responded to a 39-yard Kai For
bath field goal with Sherman's 70-yard score to
pull within 31-17 with 11:25 to go. A 15-yard pass
to Brandon Breazell and a 24-yard Chris
Ramirez run gave UCLA its final margin.
