First-year head football coach Jim Harbaugh
has only been a full-time coach for less than a
decade after a long playing career. But he had a
head start on some of his colleagues — he was
born into the profession.
Harbaugh noted in his introductory press con
ference that all the men in his family were coach
es. His father Jack was an assistant coach at Michi
gan and Stanford before head coaching stops at
Western Michigan and Western Kentucky. His
brother John is the secondary coach for the
Philadelphia Eagles. His brother-in-law Tom
Crean is the head basketball coach at Marquette
University in Milwaukee, whose Dwayne Wade
led team advanced to the Final Four in 2003.
And it doesn't stop there: former college foot
ball coach and ESPN analyst Mike Gottfried is
Jack's cousin, and Gottfried's nephew Mark Got
tfried — Jack's godson — is the head basketball
coach at Alabama.
Jack Harbaugh spent seven seasons (1973-
1979) as defensive backs coach at Michigan, put
ting his young son into regular contact with leg
endary Wolverine head coach Bo Schembechler.
The young Harbaugh tagged along to practice and
never failed to get in the coach's hair. "I must have

kicked him out of 100 practices," Jack said. Young
Jim even once put his feet up on the head coach's
desk.
Jack took the Stanford defensive coordinator
job in 1980, and Jim starred at Palo Alto High
School across the street from John Elway and the
Cardinal. He worked summer jobs and went to
football camp at Stanford. But without a scholar
ship offer from Stanford — recruiters suggested
his skills were too raw — Jim Harbaugh became
the hometown hero at Michigan in Ann Arbor.
In his 1989 biography, Schembechler called
Harbaugh "the cockiest" quarterback he ever had
at Michigan. Jerry Hanlon. Harbaugh's position
coach, called him "as great a competitor" as any
player he'd coached.
"He can't stand people not being as competi
tive as him," Hanlon said, relaying a practice inci
dent in which Harbaugh chewed out receivers for
failing to chase after his deep passes.
Harbaugh's biggest moment came after a
shocking loss to Minnesota in 1986. In a distraught
Michigan locker room, Harbaugh made an off
the-cuff remark to a reporter regarding the next
week's game at rival Ohio State: "1 guarantee we
will beat Ohio State and go to Pasadena," the
quarterback proclaimed.
Hanlon was apoplectic. "I wanted to kill him!"
he said. Schembechler later said he told I larbaugh,
"You better be right!" and noted he would have
been more concerned if Harbaugh hadn't expect
ed to win. But Hanlon said that the head coach ral
lied the coaches around their field general.
"Bo told us, the son of a gun has made a state
ment, and now we're going to have to back it up,"
he said.

The Wolverines won 26-24. the second of Har
baugh's back-to-back wins over the Buckeyes. He
was named an All-American and Big Ten Player of
the Year that season.
Asked about Harbaugh's potential as a coach,
J1 anion described several characteristics apparent
in his playing days.
"1 le has studied the game of football — if you
don't know what you're teaching, you're not going
to be a good coach." he said.
Hanlon also praised Harbaugh's intense film
study with coaches and his desire to do more.
"He didn't just go out there and play the game,
he learned the little techniques (that need to be
taught to players]," Hanlon added.
With 16 years under center in the NFL, Har
baugh spent pro offseasons as an unpaid consult
ant on his father's Western Kentucky staff, where
he helped with scouting, recruiting and fundrais
ing for the Division 1-AA program. The Hilltop
pers won the I-A A National Championship in
2002.
"You will see some Bo in JioV'hjs father prom
ised, also alluding to Bears coach Mike Ditka as an
influence on his son's style.
Harbaugh's fans extend beyond his family,
though. Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema said enthu
siastically, "1 have heard nothing but good things
about Jim Harbaugh." Michigan broadcaster Jim
Brandstatter called him a "great kid" and said he
was "perfect for Stanford ... he believes, in all the
things: student-athletes, education and solid foot
hall."
