# Football: with Richard Sherman
## 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
A First Team Pac-10 All-Freshman se
lection in 2006. Richard Sherman was one
of the few bright spots during a 2006 Cardi
nal season mired by lackluster efforts and
embarrassing losses. As a true freshman,
Sherman capped off an impressive year
with 34 receptions, 581 receiving yards and
three touchdowns. Sherman has already
started off this season hot, scoring on a 70-
yard touchdown in the opener against
UCLA and turning in an encore perform
ance with a 46-yard touchdown reception
against San Jose State.
Wearing dreadlocks that would make
Bob Marley proud and hailing from Comp
ton. Calif., Sherman is both a talented and
determined individual —on and off the
field. The Stanford Daily had the opportu
nity to catch up with the budding sopho
more, who shared his thoughts on all things
Cardinal football.
On the arrival of Jim Harhaugh
He was tremendously excited and ener
getic. 1 didn't know too much about him at
the time. The first time I met him. he
seemed ready to change this program.
Right from the start, from the first time 1
met him. It was great to see a coach doing
that — running around the locker room
and changing the culture of the school,
changing the culture of the team and mak
ing it a lot more fun to play football at Stan
ford.

On the future of Stanford football
I see us winning a lot more games in the
next few years and winning howl games.
He's [Coach Harbaughj not afraid to take
risks. He's a players' coach. He knows what
we're going through. He knows when our
legs are tired and when we need rest, things
like that — the little things that coaches who
haven't played before wouldn't think of. 1
think he relates to it a lot better — the of
fense is great. It creates a lot of mismatches,
and that will definitely win a lot of games.
On "An enthusiasm unknown to mankind"
We're a lot more confident in what we
can do. We know we can win. Even though
we lost [in the season opener against
UCLA], there's still a chance we could have
won that game. The team is together. There
isn't any separation in our game.The coach
es encourage [us] and make sure we know
all our assignments. It's just an overall con
fidence of the team that has really im
proved, and players are playing with more
confidence.
On Harhaugh's brushes with the media,
Pete Carroll and his alma mater, Michigan
I really like it because it shows he has
confidence in the players and the program.
He has confidence in the things he can do,
and we're not going to be afraid of any
thing. I have the same attitude toward any
thing.
You can't back down from any chal
lenge. any challenger. There is no man bet
ter than you unless you let him be. That's
what he's been preaching: we can play with
anyone. I like it a lot.
On the influence senior receivers Evan
Moore and Mark Bradford have had on
him
I've learned a lot from both of them, es
pecially when I first got here. I learned the
little things, the releases and different tips
on what corner[back]s are watching for. It

has definitely helped tremendously; they
both have influenced the way 1 play a lot.
It's great to play behind them for one more
year until they both hopefully go to the
[National Football) League. It's been great
for me to have that.
On coming to Stanford after attending
Dominguez High School in Compton,
Calif.
It's definitely just different. It's much
different. The people here are a lot differ
ent — around where I'm from, our school
wasn't the best. The neighborhood wasn't
the best. There were a lot of problems
around.
Here, you can wear whatever you want
and go wherever you want without thinking
about it. I've come a pretty long way from
where I was in high school, and I feel like I've
developed into a better person and a better
player since I've been here.
On his own development as a player
I'm just trying to improve game after
game. Hopefully produce some more and
go to the NFL. I'm really excited to play
better and make the team better. That's
why I play football — I'm looking for
game-to-game improvement.
On senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander
He's a real smart guy. A great quarterback,
a great leader. He can bring us back; I have
tremendous faith in him because he's shown
me a lot of things and he's a great leader. I feel
real good with T.C. at quarterback.
On the rest of the season
We can win the rest from here. If we play
mistake-free and things go right, then we
can win every game there is. I definitely feel
like we're going to a bowl game this year.
I'm totally confident in that.
