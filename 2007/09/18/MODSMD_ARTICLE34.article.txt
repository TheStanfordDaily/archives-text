Mike Montgomery returns
to the Farm

The winningest coach in Stanford basket
hall history officially stepped back onto cam
pus on Aug. 30, but not to correct players'
shooting form or run rebounding drills. Mike
Montgomery returned to Cardinal Athletics,
accepting a position as an assistant to Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby.
Montgomery, 60, went 393-167 in his 18
years at the helm of Stanford basketball,
leading Stanford to a Final Four in 1998 and
multiple Pac-10 titles over the last decade. He
took the Cardinal to the second round of the
NCAA Tournament in 10 straight years be
fore taking over as the Golden State War
riors' head coach for two years starting in
2004.
"Mike Montgomery will be a tremendous
asset to our program in a number of ways,"
Bowlsby said. "His wealth of knowledge and
experience as an 18-year coach at Stanford
University is something from which the en
tire athletic department will benefit."
As an assistant to Bowlsby, Montgomery

will be responsible for much of Stanford's
fundraising and public relations, while pro
viding a steady influence on many of the de
partment's coaches.
It is unclear what Montgomery's involve
ment will be in the men's basketball program,
if any at all. Current coach Trent Johnson was
an assistant for several years under Mont
gomery.

Field Hockey Starts Off Hot

Boasting a record of 6-0, the No. 19 Cardi
nal field hockey team is ranked for the first
time in nearly six years. This is the first time
that the program has been ranked since 2001.
The team has been led by senior
midfielder Jess Zutz. who has six
goals so far on the year to go along
with her 14 total points. Zutz was in
strumental in the Cardinal's 2-1
upset of then-No. 9 Boston College
on Aug. 25. She also had the game
winner in a 1-0 win over Longwood
on Sept. 5.
"We are excited to break into the
top-20 this week," head coach Les
ley Irvine said to GoStanford.com.
"We have had an excellent start to
the season, and it means a lot to be
receiving national recognition." 1
The Cardinal is in the midst of
two weeks of rest; its next opponent
will be rival Cal on Sept. 23.

Men's Water Polo
Falls in Semis of
NorCal Open

The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo concluded this past weekend
with a fourth-place finish in the Nor-
Cal Open, which took place at UC-
Berkeley.
The team finished the tourna
ment in a disappointing manner,
with consecutive losses to USC (9-5)
and UCLA (13-9). Despite the per
formances of freshman driver Sage
Wright (two goals against USC) and
junior driver Andrew Drake (who
earned a hat trick against the Bru
ins), the Cardinal did not have near
ly enough firepower to match that of
its Southern California rivals.
The two losses dropped the pre
viously unbeaten Cardinal's record
to 3-2. Stanford resumes regular sea
son action this Saturday against the
Pacific Tigers at 12 p.m. The match
will take place at the Avery Aquatic
Center.

pleting the 8,000 meter course in a

McWalters won the 6,000 meters
with a time of 20:57. The Cardinal
