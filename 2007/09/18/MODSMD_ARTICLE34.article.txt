Mike Montgomery returns
to the Farm

The winningest coach in Stanford basket
hall history officially stepped back onto cam
pus on Aug. 30, but not to correct players'
shooting form or run rebounding drills. Mike
Montgomery returned to Cardinal Athletics,
accepting a position as an assistant to Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby.
Montgomery, 60, went 393-167 in his 18
years at the helm of Stanford basketball,
leading Stanford to a Final Four in 1998 and
multiple Pac-10 titles over the last decade. He
took the Cardinal to the second round of the
NCAA Tournament in 10 straight years be
fore taking over as the Golden State War
riors' head coach for two years starting in
2004.
"Mike Montgomery will be a tremendous
asset to our program in a number of ways,"
Bowlsby said. "His wealth of knowledge and
experience as an 18-year coach at Stanford
University is something from which the en
tire athletic department will benefit."
As an assistant to Bowlsby, Montgomery

will be responsible for much of Stanford's
fundraising and public relations, while pro
viding a steady influence on many of the de
partment's coaches.
It is unclear what Montgomery's involve
ment will be in the men's basketball program,
if any at all. Current coach Trent Johnson was
an assistant for several years under Mont
gomery.
