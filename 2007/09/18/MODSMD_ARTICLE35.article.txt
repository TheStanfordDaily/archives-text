# Daniel's POWER 25

We're back for year two, baby. Unlike other polls, this one controls for differ
ences in schedule and ranks on actual strength. Teams aren't ranked on their
win-loss records, but whether they could beat the team below them or not.
Rank Preseason Comment
1 use 1 QB worries overrated — Trojans just ran over Nebraska, will
do same to Pac-10.
2. LSU 2 Virginia Tech demolition is season's most impressive win to
date.
3. Oklahoma 3 QB Bradford is putting up PS2 numbers.
A* Ohio State 6 Defense wins titles, and I trust this D more than Penn State's or
Wisconsin's.
5. West Virginia 7 Facing Louisville doesn't look so bad, and Noel Devine is living
up to his name.
0 Texas 4 Scare vs. UCF suggests major issues, and Oklahoma is fast ap
proaching.
7. Oregon 14 Cal, USC both at home. The Bears can't stop Dixon's legs in a
week.
8. Florida 13 Only two starters on D back, but can't teach speed — I'm
sold. So is Tennessee now.
9. Penn State 17 Eight return on 0, and back seven is great. Questions are QB
Morelli and young D line.
10. California 15 No defense, but win two — Oregon, USC — and Sugar
Bowl, here we come.
11. So. Carolina 12 Told you so. Don't look now, but Spurrier's winning with de
fense.
12. Virginia Tech 10 Maybe LSU is that good? They would smoke any of these teams
below.
13. Wisconsin 25 I still think The Citadel foreshadows an upcoming implosion,
but who else to put here?
14. Alabama NR Almost makes up for putting UCLA in my top ten, right? But 38
points allowed?
15. Texas A&M 21 Great, now beat a team with a pulse — like Miami this week-
end
16. Georgia 20 If anything, this is too low, but the SEC East is unforgiving.
Could finish with five losses.
17. Michigan 5 Re-read thecriteria beforeyou laugh. TheAP isfickle, too much
talent not to rank.
18. Nebraska NR Showed enough against USC for me to believe. Big Red is back
(sort of).
19. Rutgers 24 They're swimming in the shallow end of West Virginia's pool.
20. Louisville 8 Defense is off hiding with Osama Bin Laden and those WMDs...
21. UCLA 9 ...and Karl Dorrell's mind. One-week grace period — they're
not 44-6 bad.
22. Tennessee 23 (Wrote preseason: No creativity on 0? Another four-loss sea
son? Check.) Yup.
23. Miami 18 Today, Gators steal top recruits. Tomorrow, South Florida? Must
beat A&M.
24. South Florida NR Win over Auburn looks less impressive this week, but they
could win the Big East.
25. Hawaii 22 Could go undefeated, but can't stop Louisiana Tech? Will not
break top 20 here.
