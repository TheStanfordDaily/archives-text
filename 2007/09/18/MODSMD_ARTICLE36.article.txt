# Women's soccer ranked No. 1 after torrid start
## Undefeated Cardinal use tough schedule to vault into top spot 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team,
a monster schedule has turned into the Card's
best friend in the young season.
After starting the year tied for ninth with
Boston College and Texas in the National Soc
cer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA)
preseason poll, the Cardinal (6-0-0) has since
vaulted into the top spot thanks to victories
against a high-caliber slate of teams, including
four top-12 opponents. Some pundits expected
Stanford to trip up against such strong opposi
tion so early in the season, but the Cardinal has
instead seized the initiative and come out un
scathed thus far.
The women began the season with a road trip
to the East Coast, coming away 2-0 winners
against Boston University in the first game of
the BU Terrier Classic. Sophomore forward
Kelley O'Hara immediately jumped back to the
top of Stanford's stat sheet, scoring the game
winning goal and bagging an assist on freshman

midfielder Morgan Redman's first collegiate
goal. O'Hara notched her second winner —
matching last season's output—just two days
later in a 1-0 win against then-No. 10 Connecti
cut. The Georgia native slipped in behind the
Huskies' defense to collect a through pass and
then sent it home with only 10 minutes left on
the clock.
Stanford returned to the West Coast for the
next pair of games hut would have to wait an
other week for its first home match of the year.
The SCU/Adidas Classic, hosted by Santa Clara

(although the Cardinal did not meet the Bron
cos) came first, with No. 10 Virginia and No. 9
Notre Dame on tap. Stanford shot out of the
gate against Virginia, stunning the Cavaliers
with a Kelley Birch finish and a Lizzy George
penalty kick within the first 10 minutes and just
managed to hang on for a 2-1 win as the Cava
liers mounted a spirited comeback attempt.
T\vo days later, the Card faced off against
Notre Dame. Although they were blitzed to the
tune of 7-1 by No. 3 Santa Clara in the first game
of the round robin, the Irish held the No. 2 rank
ing in the country at the time and were the
NCAA runners-up to North Carolina in 2006.
Notre Dame and the Cardinal traded goals in
regulation time — O'Hara got her third of the
season — before .Stanford took over the game
in overtime. The Cardinal's constant pressure,
resulting in five Stanford shots to Notre Dame's
zero, paid off when O'Hara was felled inside the
18-yard box by a Notre Dame defender, winning
a penalty for Stanford. Redshirt senior midfield
er Shari Summers converted the kick to win the
game for the Cardinal.
After Santa Clara could only manage a 0-0
draw against Virginia. NCAA coaches respond
ed by elevating Stanford to the top spot in the
poll, giving the Cardinal 28 out of 33 first-place
votes. The Cardinal lived up to the new ranking

in its home debut with a pair of victories over
Missouri and No. 12 Rutgers.
The young Missouri squad gave the Cardinal
fits all evening last Friday,coming back to equal
be twice after Stanford had taken the lead, first
via a Summers PK (won by freshman forward
Christen Press) and then again after Redman
flew in at the back post to knock in a cross from
Press. Salvation came in the form of junior de
fender Allison Falk, who headed a corner kick
against the crossbar before nodding in her own
rebound with just over two minutes remaining.
The win was tempered by a shoulder injury
for O'Hara. who collided with the Missouri
goalkeeper at full speed late in the second half.
She did not play in the next game, against Rut
gers.
Despite the loss of its star forward, Stanford
overwhelmed the Scarlet Knights on Sunday.
Summers headed in a corner kick and Redman
sprinted behind the defense to finish within 10
minutes of the start, making the score 2-0 before
the Rutgers players could get in the game. The
final score was 4-1. A nice dribble and finish by
Press and a thunderbolt from 25 yards by
George preceded a late consolation goal from
Rutgers.
