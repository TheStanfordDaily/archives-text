# With all its goalscorers returning, women's soccer looks to avenge last season's Sweet 16 disappointment

After suffering a heartbreaking defeat in
the NCAA Round of 16 last year, the Stanford
women's soccer team is hack with a strong
sense of purpose, and it's showing in the early
stages of this young season.
Getting bounced from the postseason al
ways stings, but the No. 1 Cardinal (6-0-0) got
ousted in exceptionally painful fashion last fall.
Playing on its home field in the Sweet 16
against Clemson, Stanford dominated regula
tion and a pair of overtime periods, registering
18 shots to the Tigers' three. A shot by then
sophomore Lea MacKinnon rang off the post
in the first half.
Still, the Cardinal could not find the back of
the net, a problem that persisted into the penal

ty shootout that decided the game. Clemson
was perfect, while a pair of misses doomed
Stanford to an off-season of what-ifs.
Virtually the entire squad — and every sin
gle one of its goalscorers — returns from that
loss, giving Stanford one of the most experi
enced teams in the nation. Seasoned veterans
form the team's backbone; senior goalkeeper
Erica Holland — who allowed only two goals
in nearly 1 ,(KX) minutes of play last year — is
supported by redshirt senior center defender
Rachel Buehler. while fellow redshirt senior
Shari Summers links defense to attack from
her central midfield position.
.Sophomore forward Kelley O'Hara, the
team's leading scorer (nine goals, two assists),
returns for her second year leading the Cardi
nal front line. O'Hara scored almost a quarter
of the Cardinal's goals last year despite joining

the team late in order to play with the U.S.
Under-20 World Cup team. With a full season
and a year of collegiate experience, she will be a
major threat this season; a panel of coaches se
lected O'Hara (along with Buehler) to the pre
season watch list for the Hermann Award, an
nually given to the nation's best college soccer
player.
O'Hara will be one of many pouring for
ward for the Cardinal this year. Coach Paul
Ratcliffe employs a 4-3-3 formation that maxi
mizes the number of players in the Stanford at
tack. Buehler and junior Allison Falk provide a
stable central defensive pair that lets outside
backs Marisa Abegg and April Wall join the at
tack. Senior Lizzy George is the center target
forward, while the two outside forwards
(whose ranks have been swollen by two im
pressive freshmen, Morgan Redman and

Christen Press) either attack through the mid
dle or buzz to the outside.
The Cardinal will also receive a midseason
boost with the return of sophomore forward
Ali Riley, who is currently in China with the
New Zealand national team at the Women's
World Cup. Riley is starting as an outside de
fender for the Kiwis, but Ratcliffe will probably
use her as a forward.
Although the coaches of the Pacific-10 Con
ference picked Stanford to finish second to
UCLA this season, the Cardinal has the defen
sive base and the firepower to push past the
Bruins to the top of the Pac-10, and perhaps be
yond. All things considered. Stanford might be
in its best-ever shape for a deep postseason
run.
