# Men's soccer striving for NCAA respect
## Missing from last season's NCAA tourney, squad eyes postseason berth 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
After the Stanford men's soccer team was
overlooked by the NCAA College Cup selec
tion committee in 2006, despite finishing the
season ranked third in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, no one doubted that head coach Bret
Simon would return with a motivated and for
midable squad. So it's not surprising that the
Cardinal seems to be picking up right where it
left off at the end of last fall.
Don't let Stanford's 1-2-2 record fool you: it
hardly reflects the closeness of the squad's
matches thus far. The Card has ended three of
its five opening competitions in double-over
time nail biters against Top 25 teams.
The footballers opened their season on
Aug. 31 with a 2-2 tie against No. 14 I JC-Santa
Barbara in two extra periods after storming
back from a 2-0 deficit against the defending
national champs. Although the Cardinal
dropped a 1-0 loss to Wisconsin a week later,
the team rebounded with a 2-0 win over the
University of Pennsylvania on Sept. 9. Stan
ford went on to post a 1-1 draw with No. 8
Santa Clara in another double-overtime game
before letting No. 25 University of San Fran
cisco slip away 2-1 in another two overtime
contest on Sunday.
The early games of the 2007 season have

most notably marked the return of senior
goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen, who redshirt
ed in 2006. Kartunen's absenee last season al
lowed sophomore John Moore to gain some
experience between the posts, but Simon is
likely to return Kartunen to the goal after his
performance on the U.S. Under-20 National
Team.
"We are quite fortunate to have both talent
and depth at the goalkeeping position | in
Moore and Kartunen] ," Simon said. "And. we
actually have two other talented goalkeepers
in Brent Stewart and Josh Nesbit. At this point,
though. Kartunen has returned to the full form
[and, consequently, has] gotten the majority of
time in goal, but [Moore] has also gotten game
time, and we'll probably continue that pat
tern."
Unfortunately, the same overabundance of
talent and depth has yet to be found in the Car
dinal offense. Last fall, then-senior Galen
Thompson and then-junior Evan Morgan com
bined for nine of Stanford's 18 goals. With

Thompson's graduation, the Cardinal was sure
to be shorthanded, but the gap in Stanford's
front line was only widened over the summer
when Morgan got injured.
"Morgan suffered a torn ACL during the
first week of our preseason training in August,"
Simon said. "We are still going through a little
bit of an adjustment period without [Morgan]
available to play."
Simon, though, is optimistic that the adjust
ment period will pass quickly and that new at
tackers will perform in future goal-scoring op
portunities.
"Up to this point we've attacked by commit
tee," he noted, though not disregarding individ
ual contributions. "Senior Scott Bolkan has
scored three times with his head, [twice] off set
plays."
The coach praised his experienced seniors
with leading the team.
"We have a great senior group," he said of
the seasoned players. "There are seven [in the
class], and all would be fitting leaders on any
team. Ultimately, the group forms a leadership
counsel that 1 rely upon to help guide our
team."
However. Simon's high hopes do not end
with his seniors. He similarly anticipates excel
lent seasons for many younger players, includ
ing sophomore midfielder Michael Strickland,
who was elected team tri-captain with Kar
tunen and senior midfielder and defender Kyle
Hency.
Simon predicts that even the freshmen will
be integral to the team's success.
"We have had an outstanding group of

freshmen join us "he said. "Our recruiting class
was ranked in some publications as the best on
the West Coast. Many have already con
tributed on the field, (including] Bobby War
shaw. who scored his first goal in [Sunday's
game against USF]."
Stanford faces Princeton. Davidson and the
College of Charleston at home before kicking
off the Pac-10 conference season with a match
against Oregon State.
"1 expect the Pac-10 to be tough as always,"
Simon said. There are lots of strong new play
ers in the league, so we can't wait to start con
ference games in October."
Simon also notes that the team will thrive on
the competitiveness of every opponent, as each
is significant in Stanford's attempts to garner
the recognition of the College Cup selection
committee.
"One of our team goals is to be back in the
NCAA tournament," he said. "I think the guys
are ready for that challenge."
With one eye on the long-term prize, the
Cardinal will not to let its gaze stray too far
from each remaining 90-minute hurdle.
"We'll have many close games this season,"
Simon said. "Such is the nature of men's inter
collegiate soccer, with great parity across the
board. 1 think one of our strengths this year will
be the skill and fitness level the team has
shown. [But] the strongest element [will be) the
team spirit and effort the guys must bring to
games and practices."
