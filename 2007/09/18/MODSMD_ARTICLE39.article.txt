# Golfer ends spectacular collegiate career
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford women's golf team teed off this past week
end to begin its 2(K)7-08 season, there was one individual noticeably
missing from the usual contingent, someone who was a constant
presence on the team for the last four years: Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana '07.
Tangtiphaiboontana, who graduated with a degree in biological
sciences in June, played in a total of 44 events for the Card during
her four-year collegiate career. One of the team's most consistent
and admired players during her tenure at Stanford, she was hon
ored as a captain on last year's team. Yet this is just one of many
honors Tangtiphaiboontana received for her play on the golf
course, her work in the classroom and her dedication to her com
munity.
Her many accolades include being named an Honorable Men
tion Golfweek All-American in 2007 and being given one of two
2007 Pac-10 Sportsmanship awards for her volunteer work at the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. For her academic
endeavors, she has also been recognized as a Pac-10 All-Academic
second team selection.
This combination of awards and honors left Jennifer with a
number of post-graduation options. Despite having exhausted her
collegiate eligibility, Tangtiphaiboontana didn't let that keep her
off the golf course. Last month, the newly minted graduate was part
of a team of three women golfers representing the United States at
the World University Games in Bangkok.Thailand.The trio ended
up taking third in the competition; Tangtiphaiboontana finished
fourth individually.
"1 was really glad to be able to play well and do well for the
team," said Tangtiphaiboontana. "It was also really nice to end my
career playing such a prestigious event."
Tangtiphaiboontana was also named Flag Bearer for the 144-
athlete United States contingent at the closing ceremonies, leading
Team USA into Rajamangala Stadium at the end of the event.
"I'm really proud that Jenni was one of the three players repre
senting the US at the World University Games," said junior Ki-Shui
Liao.a former teammate of Tangtiphaiboontana and current mem
ber of the Stanford women's golf team. "Not only was it impressive
that a Stanford student athlete was selected out of all the different
colleges to represent the US in golf at the World University Games,
but for it to be one of my teammates and friends, that's pretty amaz
ing."
Tangtiphaiboontana is no stranger to big-time competition and
humble recognition for her efforts. In Tangtiphaiboontana, coach
es, friends and teammates all see the same thing: a dedicated and
personable individual.
"I've always been impressed at how Jenni was able to balance
both academics and golf," Liao said. "She always got things done,
no matter how difficult or challenging it was, whether it was in the
classroom, in the gym during workouts or on the golf course."
Beyond her own accomplishments,Tangtiphaiboontana has left
a lasting mark on the Stanford women's golf team. Her leadership
over the past years has influenced younger golfers, like Liao. and
taught them how to work hard and succeed.
"We really miss the leadership that she showed and the role
model she set as one of the captains on our team last year," Liao
said.
Now back from Thailand, Tangtiphaiboontana is working for a
health-care consulting company in San Francisco and predicts suc
cess for the Card this year.
"I think the team this year is going to be great," she said. "I can
definitely see them accomplishing a lot this year and taking Stan
ford women's golf to the next level."
