# Donald Rumsfeld coming to Stanford
## Former secretary of defense to join Hoover as visiting fellow 
### PATRICK K FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a move that has set student and faculty
email lists abuzz with angry chatter even be
fore most students have returned to campus,
Donald 11. Rumsfeld will he joining the
Hoover Institution as a distinguished visit
ing fellow, the University announced Sept. 7.
It is still unclear when the former secre
tary of defense will begin the appointment,
and when — if ever — he will set foot on the

Farm. But the news regarding the man who
oversaw the nation's response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq has sparked a growing student and
faculty backlash — including talk of a mock
trial for war crimes, calls for a resolution in
the Faculty Senate condemning the appoint
ment and an online petition, with 1,305 sig
natures at press time.
'ITie debate has spurred political activism
rare at Stanford and broaches such topics as
campus partisanship, academic freedom and
the nature of the relationship between the
University and Hoover. The questions cur
rently asked may preview the looming dis
pute if and when U.S. Secretary of State and
former Provost Condoleezza Rice returns to

Stanford, a move she has said in numerous
interviews she intends to make.
Task force role
According to Hoover Director John
Raisian. Rumsfeld will serve on a task force
pertaining to national security, ideology and
terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11.
2001 terrorist attacks.
"1 am pleased that he will spend time dur
ing the coming year in thinking, writing and
advising on important matters of public pol
icy," Raisan said in a statement. "I have
asked Don to join the distinguished group of
scholars that will pursue new insights on the
direction of thinking that the United States
might consider going forward. 1 am delight
ed that he will participate in the delibera

tions of our task force."
Rumsfeld's ties to I loover, the conserva
tive-leaning think tank,are numerous. In the
past, he has served as a member of the
Hoover Board of Overseers and as a mem
ber of the executive committee of the board.
The Hoover Institution has not yet set a
timetable for Rumsfeld's appointment to
begin. Hoover Public Affairs Manager
Michele I loraney said; no other members of
the task force have been named. It is expect
ed to convene infrequently, with members
meeting from time to time then going back
to other endeavors. Rumsfeld is expected to
begin work on his memoirs, having met with
several New York publishing houses
during the summer.
Hoover is aware of the comments
in opposition to the appointment,
Horaney said, "but the appointment
has already been made." Rumsfeld's
position will consist entirely of work
for the task force, and he will not
teach classes.
Growing opposition
Many other prominent conserva
tives, including former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich and General
John Abizaid. the former command
er of US. Central Command, have
been named to fellowships at 1 ioover
with little fanfare. Hut the appoint
ment of Rumsfeld — whose actions
during the buildup to and waging of
the Iraq war are considered particu
larly egregious and distasteful by
many students and faculty — has
struck a particular political nerve.
"Many Stanford faculty are out
raged by this appointment of a war
monger and torture facilitator into
any part of the University environ
ment, even if the Hoover Institute is
not directly connected with the Uni
versity," said emeritus professor of
psychology Philip Zimbardo, whose
recent book "The Lucifer Effect"
holds the former defense secretary
directly responsible for the torture
and abuse of detainees in military
prisons such as Abu Ghraib. "The
perception of the world is that
[Hoover] is part of Stanford, a very
visibly erect part of our beloved cam
pus. We value truth, justice, peace and
respect for human dignity — princi
ples which this former Secretary of
War has consistently violated."
The unofficial platform of the fac
ulty opposition, an email sent by Eng
lish Prof. Robert Polhemus entitled
"Ten reasons why the appointment of
Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover In
stitution at Stanford as a Senior Fel
low is sad, ridiculous and con
temptible," has widely circulated and
garnered more than 40 responses
from like-minded faculty overnight,
Polhemus said.The email, which con
demns Rumsfeld for his "arrogance,
failure and incompetence," expresses
worry that Stanford's affiliation with
Hoover will damage the University's
reputation and differentiates Rums
feld from Gingrich or Rice by his lack
of "intellectual and academic experi
ence and/or some measure of
achievement."
"It [the appointment] really

struck me the wrong way," Polhemus
said. "The University should not be
supporting a guy like this."
Relationship with Hoover called into
question
I"he Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace has been a fix
ture on the Stanford campus since
former U.S. president Herbert
Hoover (Class of 1895) donated a
founding endowment of $S().(XX) in
1919. Its charter, which was approved
by the University Board of Trustees,
calls for the study of the forces be
hind modern political and economic
change. But beginning with the
tenure of former director Glenn
Campbell, the think-tank has
emerged as a prominent voice in con
servative politics, sometimes at odds
with Stanford's more liberal faculty
and student body.
Tension first reached a peak dur
ing the mid-1980s when a student and
faculty revolt effectively derailed
plans to place the Ronald Reagan
Presidential library on campus. Rela
tions have since improved. Polhemus
said, characterizing Raisian's tenure
as I loover director as one of compro
mise and good feelings.
"But a line was crossed with ap
pointment of Rumsfeld: he doesn't
have any previous academic back
ground," Polhumus said, adding. "We
should really reconsider I loover's re
lationship with Stanford at this
point."
There are no concrete proposals
for what a different relationship
would look like, but history suggests
it could involve "normal academic
governance," with appointments re
quiring the approval of the Universi
ty's academic committees. That
phrase was invoked during the Rea
gan library debate in 1984 and dis
missed by I loover fellows by chants
of "nag, nag, nag."
Such a reconsideration is not in
the University administration's
plans.
"The University is a place of free
expression of ideas, and there are
some ideas that generate controver
sy. but that's not a reason not to have
those ideas expressed," said Jeff
Wachtel, special assistant to Presi
dent John Hennessy. Appointments
and fellowships such as Rumsfeld's
are the prerogative of individual in
stitutions and departments. Wachtel
said, adding that the questions re
garding the relationship between the

University and Hoover are unfound
ed.
"Whenever there are controver
sial appointments, that question al
ways gets asked." he said. "One con
troversial appointment should not be
the basis in which you would change
a long-standing relationship. It's not
going to change the kind of relation
ship the University has with
I loover."
Nonetheless, the growing student
and faculty opposition movement
aims to make its position known and
its feelings heard. Plans are in the
works for a campus-wide collabora
tive protest against the appointment,
said Sam Dubai '08. who founded the
"Rumsfeld — You Are not Welcome
at Stanford!" group on Facebook.
"It was necessary for students to
be able to organize to express their
collective shock, disgust and anger
with the arrival of a war criminal on
Stanford's campus." said Dubai,
adding that politically inclined stu
dent groups such as the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle Hast, the Stan
ford Anti-War Coalition, Muslim
Student Awareness Network and
Amnesty International are likely to
mobilize against the appointment. As
of press time, the group boasted 220
members.
The conservative minority
Not all students are speaking out
against Rumsfeld or his new affilia
tion with Hoover. The University's
Republicans, the minority on campus
and often the sole conservatives in
lopsided political debates in class dis
cussions. have called for respect of
Rumsfeld's position as a prominent
politician. Some have attempted to
appeal to a sense of academic free
dom and the free exchange of ideas,
despite ideological disagreements
with Stanford's liberal majority.
"i would expect Stanford students
to be respectful of those they dis
agree with — especially when it is
someone within the mainstream of
American politics — but. then again,
these are also the same students who
tried to physically obstruct President
Bush from attending a meeting at
1 loover in April of 2006," said Carl
kelm '09. the incoming president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"So 1 can't say I'm completely
shocked |at the opposition]."

struck me the wrong way," Polhemus
said. "The University should not be
supporting a guy like this."
Relationship with Hoover called into
question
I"he Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace has been a fix
ture on the Stanford campus since
former U.S. president Herbert
Hoover (Class of 1895) donated a
founding endowment of $S().(XX) in
1919. Its charter, which was approved
by the University Board of Trustees,
calls for the study of the forces be
hind modern political and economic
change. But beginning with the
tenure of former director Glenn
Campbell, the think-tank has
emerged as a prominent voice in con
servative politics, sometimes at odds
with Stanford's more liberal faculty
and student body.
Tension first reached a peak dur
ing the mid-1980s when a student and
faculty revolt effectively derailed
plans to place the Ronald Reagan
Presidential library on campus. Rela
tions have since improved. Polhemus
said, characterizing Raisian's tenure
as I loover director as one of compro
mise and good feelings.
"But a line was crossed with ap
pointment of Rumsfeld: he doesn't
have any previous academic back
ground," Polhumus said, adding. "We
should really reconsider I loover's re
lationship with Stanford at this
point."
There are no concrete proposals
for what a different relationship
would look like, but history suggests
it could involve "normal academic
governance," with appointments re
quiring the approval of the Universi
ty's academic committees. That
phrase was invoked during the Rea
gan library debate in 1984 and dis
missed by I loover fellows by chants
of "nag, nag, nag."
Such a reconsideration is not in
the University administration's
plans.
"The University is a place of free
expression of ideas, and there are
some ideas that generate controver
sy. but that's not a reason not to have
those ideas expressed," said Jeff
Wachtel, special assistant to Presi
dent John Hennessy. Appointments
and fellowships such as Rumsfeld's
are the prerogative of individual in
stitutions and departments. Wachtel
said, adding that the questions re
garding the relationship between the

University and Hoover are unfound
ed.
"Whenever there are controver
sial appointments, that question al
ways gets asked." he said. "One con
troversial appointment should not be
the basis in which you would change
a long-standing relationship. It's not
going to change the kind of relation
ship the University has with
I loover."
Nonetheless, the growing student
and faculty opposition movement
aims to make its position known and
its feelings heard. Plans are in the
works for a campus-wide collabora
tive protest against the appointment,
said Sam Dubai '08. who founded the
"Rumsfeld — You Are not Welcome
at Stanford!" group on Facebook.
"It was necessary for students to
be able to organize to express their
collective shock, disgust and anger
with the arrival of a war criminal on
Stanford's campus." said Dubai,
adding that politically inclined stu
dent groups such as the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle Hast, the Stan
ford Anti-War Coalition, Muslim
Student Awareness Network and
Amnesty International are likely to
mobilize against the appointment. As
of press time, the group boasted 220
members.
The conservative minority
Not all students are speaking out
against Rumsfeld or his new affilia
tion with Hoover. The University's
Republicans, the minority on campus
and often the sole conservatives in
lopsided political debates in class dis
cussions. have called for respect of
Rumsfeld's position as a prominent
politician. Some have attempted to
appeal to a sense of academic free
dom and the free exchange of ideas,
despite ideological disagreements
with Stanford's liberal majority.
"i would expect Stanford students
to be respectful of those they dis
agree with — especially when it is
someone within the mainstream of
American politics — but. then again,
these are also the same students who
tried to physically obstruct President
Bush from attending a meeting at
1 loover in April of 2006," said Carl
kelm '09. the incoming president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"So 1 can't say I'm completely
shocked |at the opposition]."

In a move that has set student and faculty
email lists abuzz with angry chatter even be
fore most students have returned to campus,
Donald 11. Rumsfeld will he joining the
Hoover Institution as a distinguished visit
ing fellow, the University announced Sept. 7.
It is still unclear when the former secre
tary of defense will begin the appointment,
and when — if ever — he will set foot on the

Farm. But the news regarding the man who
oversaw the nation's response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq has sparked a growing student and
faculty backlash — including talk of a mock
trial for war crimes, calls for a resolution in
the Faculty Senate condemning the appoint
ment and an online petition, with 1,305 sig
natures at press time.
'ITie debate has spurred political activism
rare at Stanford and broaches such topics as
campus partisanship, academic freedom and
the nature of the relationship between the
University and Hoover. The questions cur
rently asked may preview the looming dis
pute if and when U.S. Secretary of State and
former Provost Condoleezza Rice returns to

Stanford, a move she has said in numerous
interviews she intends to make.
Task force role
According to Hoover Director John
Raisian. Rumsfeld will serve on a task force
pertaining to national security, ideology and
terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11.
2001 terrorist attacks.
"1 am pleased that he will spend time dur
ing the coming year in thinking, writing and
advising on important matters of public pol
icy," Raisan said in a statement. "I have
asked Don to join the distinguished group of
scholars that will pursue new insights on the
direction of thinking that the United States
might consider going forward. 1 am delight
ed that he will participate in the delibera

tions of our task force."
Rumsfeld's ties to I loover, the conserva
tive-leaning think tank,are numerous. In the
past, he has served as a member of the
Hoover Board of Overseers and as a mem
ber of the executive committee of the board.
The Hoover Institution has not yet set a
timetable for Rumsfeld's appointment to
begin. Hoover Public Affairs Manager
Michele I loraney said; no other members of
the task force have been named. It is expect
ed to convene infrequently, with members
meeting from time to time then going back
to other endeavors. Rumsfeld is expected to
begin work on his memoirs, having met with
several New York publishing houses
during the summer.
Hoover is aware of the comments
in opposition to the appointment,
Horaney said, "but the appointment
has already been made." Rumsfeld's
position will consist entirely of work
for the task force, and he will not
teach classes.
Growing opposition
Many other prominent conserva
tives, including former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich and General
John Abizaid. the former command
er of US. Central Command, have
been named to fellowships at 1 ioover
with little fanfare. Hut the appoint
ment of Rumsfeld — whose actions
during the buildup to and waging of
the Iraq war are considered particu
larly egregious and distasteful by
many students and faculty — has
struck a particular political nerve.
"Many Stanford faculty are out
raged by this appointment of a war
monger and torture facilitator into
any part of the University environ
ment, even if the Hoover Institute is
not directly connected with the Uni
versity," said emeritus professor of
psychology Philip Zimbardo, whose
recent book "The Lucifer Effect"
holds the former defense secretary
directly responsible for the torture
and abuse of detainees in military
prisons such as Abu Ghraib. "The
perception of the world is that
[Hoover] is part of Stanford, a very
visibly erect part of our beloved cam
pus. We value truth, justice, peace and
respect for human dignity — princi
ples which this former Secretary of
War has consistently violated."
The unofficial platform of the fac
ulty opposition, an email sent by Eng
lish Prof. Robert Polhemus entitled
"Ten reasons why the appointment of
Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover In
stitution at Stanford as a Senior Fel
low is sad, ridiculous and con
temptible," has widely circulated and
garnered more than 40 responses
from like-minded faculty overnight,
Polhemus said.The email, which con
demns Rumsfeld for his "arrogance,
failure and incompetence," expresses
worry that Stanford's affiliation with
Hoover will damage the University's
reputation and differentiates Rums
feld from Gingrich or Rice by his lack
of "intellectual and academic experi
ence and/or some measure of
achievement."
"It [the appointment] really

struck me the wrong way," Polhemus
said. "The University should not be
supporting a guy like this."
