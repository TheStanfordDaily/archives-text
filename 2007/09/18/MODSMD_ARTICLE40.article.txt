# Men's golf shooting for another NCAA title
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's golf team could not
have larger shoes to fill going into the 2(X)7 fall
season. Last year's list of accomplishments in
cludes winning the 2007 NC'AA golf champi
onship crown for the first time since 1994 and
racking up an NCAA-best seven team tourna
ment wins. Five golfers were placed on the Ail-
American team for the first time in program
history, which has shown the nation that Stan
ford will he a force to he reckoned with in years
to come.
Before play even began this season, the Car
dinal was already a national favorite among the

top golf teams in the nation. Stanford took the
No. 1 spot in the 2007-2(X)8 Golf World/Nike
Golf Preseason Coaches Poll, reeling in 19 of
32 first place votes. The Cardinal scored 759
points in the poll, followed by No. 2 Georgia's
714. Alabama is ranked third, followed by
Florida in fourth and UCLA in fifth.
Though the golf world may have high ex
pectations for the Cardinal, head coach Con
rad Ray '97 says the team has to put some work
in to play like last spring.
"The guys realize that last year was last
year," Ray said. "It is an achievement to cele
brate and enjoy, but we will have to start from
scratch again. We have work to do in certain
areas to get where we were last year."

Golf World magazine even publicized high
expectations for a few individual Cardinal
golfers when the magazine placed three stu
dents from the team on its Top-50 Players to
Watch list.The top Stanford golfer on the list is
senior Rob Grube. who was ranked in the
eighth spot after his third place showing at
June's 2007 NCAA tournament. Grube has
been named an All American in each of the
past three seasons and will look to become the
second four-time All-American golfer in Stan
ford history.
Also making the Top-50 cut are sophomore
Joseph Bramlett and freshman Sihwan Kim.
Bramlett's list of accomplishments includes
being chosen for the 2007 National All Fresh

man team, winning one individual tournament
and posting seven top-10 finishes last season.
Although he is only a freshman. Kim's
preparation for his collegiate debut has proven
extensive: he was the 2004 US. Junior Amateur
champion and has won eight American Junior
Golf Association tournaments.
Ray was also awarded his share of honors
after leading his team to an NCAA title last
year. He was named the 2(X)7 Pacific-10 Con
ference Coach of the Year and is only the sec
ond coach in program history to have received
the Eaton Golf Pride Dave Williams Award.
Stanford was even recognized as having one
of the top golf programs interna
tionally after the Cardinal was invit
ed to compete in the 2007 Topy Cup
U.S.-Japan Intercollegiate Golf
Championship in Tanagura, Japan,
where the squad took third. The
Cardinal finished with a score of 17-
under par, four shots behind second
place Alabama and five shots be
hind tournament champion Tokoku
Fukushi University.
"This was a good start to the sea
son for us." Ray said. "We definitely
have a much younger team since last
year, so I didn't know what to expect
in this first tournament. We had a
chance to win going into the final
round, and that is the only thing you
can ask for. Our final round was not
the best round, it was rainy and we
had a slow start,so we didn't make it
happen. All in all. it was a great trip,
and we learned a lot."
Kim led the Cardinal in his first
collegiate tournament, finishing
third individually with a three-day
total of nine-under 207. Kim began
the tournament with a 70 (-2) in the
first round before firing a five
under-par 67 in the second round.
He shot another 70 in the rainy third
round.
Grube finished in a tie for ninth
place with a five-under 211. After a
lights-out 67 in the first round tem
porarily vaulted the senior into a
four-way tie for first. Grube cooled
off with two consecutive rounds of
even-par 72 on days two and three.
Junior Daniel Lim also finished
in the top 15, placing in a tie for 13th
with a three-under-par 213.
Rounding out the Cardinal
scores were Bramlett in a tie for 21st
with a three-round total of 219 (73-
68-78 ) and junior Dodge Kemmer in
a tie for 44th with a score of 229 (77-
77-75).
Though the Cardinal may feel
some pressure to live up to its 2006
NCAA title, the team is ready for
the challenge according to Ray.
"Pressure is only a self-created
thing." Ray said. "Guys sign up to
play at a place like Stanford because
you are automatically considered to
be at the top of your game. Guys
look forward to that and the compe
tition surrounding the high level of
play and expectation. I think that
the rankings and expectations are a
positive thing. It really only matters
how you play in June, but we have a
lot of work until then."
