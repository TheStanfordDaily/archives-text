The Stanford men's golf team could not
have larger shoes to fill going into the 2(X)7 fall
season. Last year's list of accomplishments in
cludes winning the 2007 NC'AA golf champi
onship crown for the first time since 1994 and
racking up an NCAA-best seven team tourna
ment wins. Five golfers were placed on the Ail-
American team for the first time in program
history, which has shown the nation that Stan
ford will he a force to he reckoned with in years
to come.
Before play even began this season, the Car
dinal was already a national favorite among the

top golf teams in the nation. Stanford took the
No. 1 spot in the 2007-2(X)8 Golf World/Nike
Golf Preseason Coaches Poll, reeling in 19 of
32 first place votes. The Cardinal scored 759
points in the poll, followed by No. 2 Georgia's
714. Alabama is ranked third, followed by
Florida in fourth and UCLA in fifth.
Though the golf world may have high ex
pectations for the Cardinal, head coach Con
rad Ray '97 says the team has to put some work

Bramlett's list of accomplishments includes

champion and has won eight American Junior
Golf Association tournaments.
Ray was also awarded his share of honors
after leading his team to an NCAA title last
year. He was named the 2(X)7 Pacific-10 Con
