# Overcoming injuries critical to Cal's success
## 
### GREG BEACHAM AP SPORTS WRITER 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Although California certainly isn't
sinking, defensive coordinator Boh Gregory has plenty of holes to
plug.
The Golden Bears head into Pac-10 play this week with a No. 6
ranking, a 3-0 record and a wealth of talent on a quickly maturing
offense.
They also have serious concerns about their defensive depth
after three starters were knocked out of a 42-12 victory over
Louisiana Tech with potentially serious injuries.
Defensive linemen Matt Malele and Rulon Davis both hurt their
feet against the Bulldogs, with Malele likely tearing tendons and
Davis possibly incurring a stress fracture. Zack Follett, the Bears'
strong-side linebacker and emotional leader, also developed a neck
stinger in the first half and didn't return.
Most Cal fans don't know the names of the players who replaced
them against the Bulldogs, but Gregory professes confidence in
every player he coaches.
"1 liked the way we responded when guys went down, but we
won't really know about us until Pac-10 play." said Gregory, in his
sixth season as Jeff Tedford's right-hand man. "We'll see where our
depth is, and I think guys will step into bigger roles."
The extent of all three injuries wasn't known Sunday, but any set
back is bad news for a defense that's still working to replace the top
three players from last season. Cornerback Daymeion Hughes, line
backer Desmond Bishop and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane all
went to the NFL, leaving Gregory to rebuild his core.
C'al's line is its greatest concern, since Malele already was the
only returning starter from last season. Gregory filled the holes
against Louisiana Tech with everyone from fifth-year senior John
Allen, who recovered a fumble in the first extensive playing time of
his career, to promising freshmen Derrick Hill and Cameron Jor
dan.
The Bears hope Follett will be back for Saturday's home game
against Arizona, but Eddie Young and Michael Mohamed filled in
capably against Louisiana Tech.
"It's going to hurt us. but that's why we've got depth," said mid
dle linebacker Worrell Williams, who has been solid in Bishop's
place this season. "If they don't come back, we'll have other guys
stepping in. ready to play. We've got a lot of guys who have been
waiting for that chance."
Despite its holes. Cal's defense is showing signs of progress after
Tennessee moved the ball well in the Bears' opener. Cal had four
sacks and 12 tackles for loss against Louisiana Tech while allowing
just one play longer than 20 yards.
While lining up each week against the Pac-10's outstanding ath
letes and inventive offenses, Gregory's defenses usually rely on a
knack for killing drives by forcing turnovers.
"We're always talking turnovers _ get the ball." Williams sajd.
"We're a big opportunity team. We're gping to get to the route be
fore you. We want to stop them, but we'd rather have a turnover
than get them to punt it."
Cal has forced seven turnovers in its first three games, including
three by Louisiana Tech. which managed 274 total yards and sever
al sustained drives.
"Big plays have been huge," said defensive back Robert Peele,
who had an interception on a tipped ball."Teams have been driving
on us. but we somtjhow come up with a fumble or an interception.
We have the ability to force teams to make mistakes like that. We
don't care about yards so much.The only stat we keep is takeaways."
Louisiana Tech and Tennessee both had success against Cal with
a no-huddle offense, though Gregory couldn't understand why the
officials wouldn't allow him to substitute at times during the hurry
up drill, and Williams criticized the Bulldogs' quick-snapping tech
nique.
"They're supposed to give us a chance to get lined up, and they
were doing something that was borderline (illegal) "Williams said.
"We still got it done, and that's all that matters. It's all about the
scoreboard."
