# Stanford Myths Debunked
## 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION MYTHBUSTER 
People go to San Francisco on a regular
basis. Myth. Especially for freshman, this
simply does not happen. Sorry, folks. The
Caltrain is a hassle (only runs once an hour
on weekends), and campus offers students
more than enough to keep busy on the week
ends, from recovering from that hangover
the night before to working on that CS 106 A
program due on Monday. Some do make the
occasional venture into the city, but usually
no more than once a quarter. Enjoy that up
coming scavenger hunt; you probably won't
see the city for a long time.
Palo Alto is a had college town. True and
false. Palo Also isn't Chapel Hill or Cam
bridge, but it isn't half bad either. Aquarius is
a gem of an independent theater, and Uni
versity Ave. has a number of pretentious cof
fee shops and a plethora of Indian/Chi
nese/Thai restaurants. In short, you should
visit, if only to get off-campus once in awhile.
The places don't really cater to college stu
dents, but they'll take your money (and lots
of it) anyway.
No one cares ahout the Cal rivalry. True. 1
was surprised to find freshman year that at
Big Game, in our own stadium, the Cal stu
dent section was much larger and louder
than ours. No matter how much the Axe
Committee tries to make us care, we are only
interested in it enough to make cruel t-shirts

with phrases like "safety school" and "There
is one thing we do have in common...a Cal
acceptance letter." Leave the hatred, and the
crushing victories, to Cal.
Stanford football is had. Myth. They're
terrible. Last season in a nutshell: when we
lined up for a field goal against USC, our
only chance to score in the whole game, they
blocked it and took it to the house. USC 42.
Stanford 0. We finished the season 1-11 and
opened this season with a 45-17 shellacking
at the hands cf UCLA. Things are not look
ing good for the grand ol' Cardinal. But
there's always next year. Maybe if we just
"believe," they'll score a touchdown or two.
The Freshman 15. True and false. Stan
ford Dining takes pains to make a variety of
dining options available, and, many days, the
salad bar is the best option. Add that to the
long distances from dorms to class (science
majors in Wilbur. I feel bad for you) and
many students' frequent trips to Arrillaga
gym; some students lose weight. But it's also
hard to form an exercise regimen with con
stantly irregular schedules, so don't be wor
ried if you gain a few pounds. No one will no
tice, much less care. What you should watch
out for is when you come home, as your par
ents will probably try to feed you every two
hours after hearing about the dorm food.
Various lIIUIVI rumors. All true. Yes,
there is the"I MUM kid" who dominates dis
cussions and annoys everyone else. It could
even be you. Yes, you will read random texts

that don't make much sense. Yes, if you are
an engineer, you will he miserable. Yes. it's
better than PWR. but not by much. Yes. you
will realize that high school BS is nothing
compared to college BS. Good luck!
Fountain-hopping. Unverified. After ask
ing a couple of friends, there seems to be de
bate over whether students actually go foun
tain-hopping. One of my friends has been
several times, but I've been exactly zero
times. I was inclined to believe fountain-hop
ping was a propaganda tool during Admit
Weekend, but my sources tell me some stu
dents actually do go. Why they do, though, is
another question.
Stanford students don't date. True, most
ly. Most Stanford students romantically in
volved seem to be "Married" or "It's compli
cated." There's little in between, unfortu
nately — the extremes of "benefriends" and
"practically living together" seem to be easi
est to manage and the least stressful. That
said, a few students actually do "date" —
meaning they both actually go on dates (din
ner and a movie, etc.) and have relationships
that aren't "we are one person." "Dating" is
more nebulous, but also.potentially, the most
rewarding. And 1 firmly believe the lack of
dating should change. So go ahead, ask
someone out to dinner; you might start a hip
new trend.
SLK kids are celibate accordion players.
Myth. For some reason, there's a massive
stigma against SLE kids. In the eyes of most

students, having an inordinate passion for
Plato and Dante makes one socially awk
ward and unable to party. This is not to say
that SLE doesn't have its fair share of those
kids, but so does IHUM (see "Various
I HUM rumors" above). Hut SLE, more than
anything else, seems to typify the "work
hard, play hard" mentality. So take on that
SLE kid in Beirut. You just might be shamed
by a Plato-lover.
Premeds are intense. True. If you're a
premed, be prepared. If you aren't, be pre
pared to be around them. 1 don't know what
it is, but premeds seem to be the most
stressed — not only do they have tough
classes, but they have to worry about their
GPA being higher than the next guy's. And
then there's also massive competition for top
research positions. Stanford doesn't have a
reputation for being cutthroat, but, if anyone
is. it's your sleep-deprived, tense premed
next door.
People are not stressed. Myth. Many
Stanford students are afflicted with "Duck
Syndrome," paddling like mad underwater
but looking serene above the surface. Fact of
the matter is. Stanford students can be very
stressed, and not everyone pretends to be re
laxed and calm. In fact. I do not really know
anyone who does that. So don't be afraid to
show stress — it's healthy, and maybe you'll
even meet a cute, stressed-out boy or girl.
Overworked students need study-buddies
too, right?
