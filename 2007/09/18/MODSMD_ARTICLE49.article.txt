# WHAT YOUR DORM ROOM REALLY NEEDS

### MATT BUSH INTERMISSION SPACE SAVER 
Five things to bring to Stanford:
1. A hike and a helmet. A wheeled vehicle of some sort (in
j addition to bicycles, I've seen skateboards, scooters and a
Segway or two) is a must-have at Stanford. While you might
consider yourself patient enough to walk around our spa
cious campus, keep in mind that you might have to travel
from Nludd or Gates Building to Kresge Auditorium (nearly
two-thirds of a mile) in the 10-minute gap between classes.
You probably won't need a helmet for a bike ride across the
street, but you should consider one for any bike ride off-cam
pus. Outside the Stanford bubble, not only do the bikes not
rule the streets, but there's often less space for a bike between
the curb to your right and the cars whizzing by on your left
than the distance between the beds in a Lag mini-double
(which is saying something).
2. A futon, beanbag, or comfy chair. The housing-issued
chairs in your room might be just the torturously hard wood
en surface you need to get in the mood to write a torturously
hard paper, but they're not going to cut it when you need a re
laxing seat for curling up with a new book, taking a nap or
cuddling with your "study buddy" from I HUM section. If you
ever end up sexiled for an entire night, you'll be glad to have
something like this to drag into your neighbor's room instead
of sleeping in the lounge.
3. Cleaning supplies. Whether you're a hardcore student
or a hardcore partier, you may find yourself neglecting the
I messy state of your room for a few weeks straight and need
ing more than just a trash can to accommodate a surprise visit
from relatives. If you bring food in the room, you'll want
paper towels and wet wipes for drink spills and greasy fingers.
And if you get a portable vacuum cleaner, your hall will wor
ship you when the shared dorm vacuum inevitably goes miss
ing.
4. A water filter.The tap water and fountain water here are
perfectly safe, but not always the most appetizing (unless
you're into calcium and magnesium ions). Go for one of
these, rather than spending hundreds on bottled water, if you
like your water pure.
5. Duct tape. While you always have the option of logging
on to fix-it to repair your leaky room sink or to put the bed
frame you somehow broke back together, why have a creepy
repairman invade your personal space when you can just
patch it up with some duct tape and pretend it's good as new?
The material that allegedly holds the universe together has

limitless uses in a college atmosphere, including fashioning
your 1 ialloween costume and sealing shut the mouth of that
hallmate who sings in the shower.
Five things that are a waste of money or space:
1. Food. There's no need to buy a lifetime supply of ener
gy bars or Ramen when you can find so many other creative
ways to get free snack food at Stanford. Take a typical day:
free lunch at some 1 listory department seminar, pizza at your
dorm's house meeting â€” and your roommate told you to eat
as many of his grandma's cookies as you wanted, right? The
dining hall people don't mind if you take a brownie home
from dinner for a late-night snack, so what's to say you can't
stock an entire week of breakfast?
2. Condoms. 1 say this not to condemn sex (quite the con
trary). but to let you know that you can get 12 condoms (or
two dollars' worth of other sex goodies) per quarter for free
at the Sexual Health Peer Resource Center in Vaden (your
PHE will be glad to point you there). So don't bother buying
them before you move in. and spare yourself the embarrass
ing shopping trip with Mom or Dad!
3. Clothes or costumes you might not ever wear. We're a
casual, laid-back California university; you don't need a suit
and tie to meet with your advisor or go on your first date.
Dorm room closet space can be sparse; you won't be able to
fit your veritable zoo of animal costumes in there along with
the essentials. Part of the fun of being in a college dorm is bor
rowing clothing and costumes from your dormmates (and
trying to phrase your dorm chat-list emails requesting such
items so that they sound as needy as possible).
4. Winter clothes. Until about mid-November. Stanford is
as much of a picturesque sunny oasis as it is during the spring
or summer, so don't let a bottom drawer packed with umbrel
las and jackets painfully remind you that we have winters like
everywhere else. Wait to bring your mass of winter clothing
until you come back from Thanksgiving Break when you ac
tually might need it.
5. Childhood mementos. A small framed picture of your
high school posse and that cute gift bear from your ex are one
thing... 18 years' worth of favorite toys and honor roll awards
are another. You might think your dozens of soccer trophies
will impress any visitors to your room, but your roommate is
inevitably going to use them, without your permission, as part
of a physics experiment. And how will your first college
hook-up react to the fact that you still sleep with your
blankie?
