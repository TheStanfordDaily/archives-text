Ihe Stanford Band is finally "All Right
Now" after a dramatic year of silence in the
stands. The Band was suspended in August
2006 and later placed on indefinite provi
sional status after the Band Shak was van
dalized.
The Stanford Band celebrated in White
Plaza this spring, donning color from tank to
tuba. Ihe Band, known for its zaniness, is
back in business this fall due to the lift of its
provisional status.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardnian announced on June 14 that he
had lifted the indefinite provisional status of
the Band, which first tooted its newly rein
stated horns at Commencement on June 17.
Ihe announcement followed the Band's co
operation with a yearlong review, which rec
ommended the creation of an administrative
position designed for working with the Band
"In recent years, the University's relation
ship with the Band was one more of tolera
tion," Boardnian said."Because the Band is a
student organization, but it represents Stan
ford in ways that other student organizations
don't, this really needs to be a partnership."

With the reinstatement of its privileges,
effective immediately, the Band can travel
and control its own performance schedule,
hut the group remains on alcohol probation.
"The torch has now been passed back into
our hands, whereas before, it was in [the ad
ministration's] hands," said Hand Manager
Adam Cohen '07, who served on the Band
Reinstatement Committee.
Boardman appointed the Band Rein
statement Committee last fall when the
Band's suspension was changed to an indefi
nite provisional status.
After the committee submitted a report
in April, Boardman convened an advisory
group to review the recommendations and
provide feedback. Hie group agreed to the
reinstatement.
ITie committee recommended that a per
manent administrative director, responsible
to the Dean of Students office, be a liaison
between the Band and the University. Asso
ciate Dean of Students Chris Griffith, who
has been working with Band leadership since
last fall as the leader of the Reinstatement
Committee, will continue as interim director
until a replacement is found.
Cohen spoke positively about the group's
relationship with Griffith.
"It was nice to have some sort of adminis
trative presence so we can get the things we

want." he said."and it makes the administra
tion more comfortable because there's an
adult there. It's a win-win situation."
University representatives were quick to
assert that the additional administrative
oversight will not sanitize the Band's tradi
tionally irreverent character.
"I think more than ever the University is
committed to continuing the tradition of the
Band's creative spirit." Boardman said.
"Now we're a partner with the Band, so we
want to help it be successful."
"I don't have any doubt the Band will
continue to amaze people, amuse people and
engage the community," Griffith added.
Cohen agreed that the performances the
Stanford community has come to love will
not change.
"Short of violating California laws or poli
cies. in a clash between the Band and admin
istration, the Band wins," Cohen said."We're
in control of our personality. We're going to
be just as crazy and unique and fun and awe
some as we've ever been. We're not going to
change — and the school doesn't want us to
change,so it won't be a problem."
Both Band representatives and Universi
ty officials also lauded the practical advan
tages of an administrative liaison. University
spokeswoman Kate Chesley said that since
the Band works closely with a variety of

other partners, such as Athletics and the Of
fice of Student Activities, the new position
will simplify the Band's relationships with
administrators.
"It will make coordination and communi
cation with the University much easier"
Chesley said.
"I'm happy the school is giving us re
sources to hire a personal advocate," Cohen
added.
Sammy Franco W. the Band's public rela
tions manager, said he could see both draw
backs and advantages to the creation of the
new role.
"We are a student organization," he said.
"Is an administrative director necessary?
We've lasted for years without one. Then
again, we have one now, and it's worked out
fine."
But even with administrative oversight,
the Band is not totally in the clear. Boardman
said that the Band could be returned to pro
visional status if it fails to cooperate with the
University.
Cohen said that the Band has no inten
tions whatsoever of vandalizing any build
ings.
"I'm keeping the Band on its best behav
ior," he said.
