1 Mattress pad: Generations of undergraduates have had sweaty, vomit cov
ered sex all over the mattress on which you are currently sleeping. Unlike
them, you're smart enough to use protection. A thick foam mattress pad will
not only protect you from the skeeze but will make your University-issued
bod more comfy for your own sweaty romps.
2. External hard drive: You're an adult now. and that means it's time to make
responsible decisions — starting with regularly backing up everything on
your hard drive. One day. this baby is going to be the only thing standing be
tween you and the crushing loss of three years' worth of term papers, saved
AIM convos and pirated seasons of "Lost."
3. Fleece blanket: Although you might have come to Stanford partly because
of the warm weather, it still gets chilly at night. Save yourself the trouble of
bundling up in your bulky extra long twin comforter or that heinous wool
sweater your grandma knitted for you and invest in a soft, fleece blanket.
These also come in handy for snuggling sessions or fitful naps in the lounge.
4. Lights! The quickest way to make your dorm room inviting? Sign a pact to
never turn on that offensive.giant chicklet light that descends from the center
of every darn room on campus. A desk lamp and a floor lamp will not only
make your room more cozy, but it'll also allow you to stay up late working on
last-minute reading without a) bothering your roommate and b) bothering
your eyes. If your fingers have already learned to switch on the chicklet as
soon as you walk in the door, at least cover it with a nice piece of fabric to dif
fuse that harsh stream of flouresence.
5. Electric Tea Kettle: Perfect for anything from morning oatmeal to after
noon tea to midnight instant coffee, an electric kettle comes in handy in so
very many ways. Flip a switch and, in mere seconds, you have hot, bubbling
H2O. Don't forget to invest in one with an automatic shut-off function, or —
if you forget to turn it off — you'll return home to a sauna or, worse, an incin
erated room.
6. Pocket Knife: OK, so we all know that pocket knives are handy little tools.
But just how handy? Where else can you find pliers for your futon, a can open
er for your soup, and a corkscrew for... in the palm of your hand? When your
roommate is complaining about his lack of a screwdriver, whip out your
Leatherman for a mini-Philips head, and let the games begin.
