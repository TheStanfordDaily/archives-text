# EVERYONE DOES IT—HERE'S HOW

### CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS INTERMISSION SANITATION SUPER HERO 
• M M hen 1 was first asked to write an artiele
M Mm M about what incoming freshmen would
M MM M need to know. I thought, my name and
MM MM phone number.Then I thought.no,it
MM would be much better to maintain an
W air of mystery, to keep my identity se
cret and comment from the sidelines, swooping in to
save the day before retreating to my lonely hideaway.
Then I thought, I should just make a poop joke. And
that is when I stopped thinking.
So today I hope to provide you with some advice
and information that might be useful and to remind you
of some things that you might want to remember. First
and foremost: everybody poops.
Strange to think that you may have forgotten that.
Perhaps you read the popular children's book by Taro
Gomi.or perhaps not. Still, at some point,you probably
realized that everyone, no matter their size, age, or
IHUM section,drops a deuce at some point during the
week.

Do not be ashamed. Do not blush at the thought of

your professor squatting over a bowl and making
some serious brown. When else are they going to

have the time to grade all those papers you keep sub-

mitting? So remember that even though vou are

now sharing a bathroom with 50 strangers.

none of them has any false impression

of what is going on in that stall. Be
proud and let it rip. But please flush

thoroughly. Just be
cause everyone

knows what's hap
pening does not

I c
mean that he'll ap
preciate the visual
evidence.

That said, you
have to make some

important deci
sions before you

embark on that
epic journey of re-

lief. First of all. where

are you going to drop off that precious cargo? Assess
your dorm's bathroom situation. Which is the closest to
my room? Which has the proper facilities? Then, if
you're like me, you can pick a favorite stall.
1 usually choose the one farthest from the door, un
less I don't like how the seat holds my cheeks. For pee
ing (because my dorm does not have urinals), I typical
ly choose the stall closest to the door. I see this choice as
an indication of the amount of time 1 plan to invest in
each activity. While an absolutely wonderful sensation.

peeing typically takes less time than pooping. Iliere
fore, I like to keep my pooping farther out of the way so
as to make room for those in a full-bladder rush.
At this time. I must note that there are places where
pooping is inappropriate. I will not go into specifics, but
just because something has running water does not
make it a dung-receptacle. Peeing is another story, but
keep in mind that, just as some object to the idea of a
yellow snow-cone, so do many object to the idea of pee
ing in a water fountain. When it comes down to the
more unfortunate bodily expulsions, like vomit, please
realize the clear hierarchy in place. A couch in the
lounge is a bad place to throw up. The hallway is also
not good.
A sink might seem like a good idea, but most are not
designed for that kind of roughage, and you will wind
up picking some out with your hands. Toilets are the
best because, assuming you hit the bowl, a simple flush
cleans it up.
Trash cans are second best, but remember to dump
them and rinse thoroughly. My favorite vomiting stall is
the middle one. between the peeing and the pooping

ones, because 1
have con-

vinced my
self that it

must be
cleaner.

If I think 1

may need a

long time, I bring a

cushion. Another note

about vomiting is that, unlike

peeing and pooping, many by

standers will go out of their way to
help you if it seems like you'll need it.
So if you've pooped or vomited on

some of your clothes, you will defi
nitely need to wash them. Some of you

have never done your own laundry,
which is an admirable feat in itself. If

you're worried that you might dump soap

into the lint screen, bleach your silk neckties,
wash your new colored shirts with hot water

or if you have no idea what any of those things even
mean, you should ask for assistance. There's no shame

in getting help the first time you do anything. If the per
son you ask for help is also cute, you could have a 10-
year on-and-off-again relationship in your future. (Re
member when Ross helped Rachel do her laundry for
the first time and then they started dating and eventu
ally had a baby? That's like real life.)
In case you're confused, let me lay down a quick tu
torial. First, take your clothes that are dirty. I lopefully
this is a reasonably small pile and not every single arti
cle of clothing you brought with you to college. 11 you

get out of the shower ar.d put on the same pair of socks
that you just took off, you have ignored your laundry
for too long. Hstablish a schedule with some regular
washings included. In my case, that meant 1 had to drop
physics.
Next, put your reasonably sized pile of laundry into
the empty washing machine. Put the correct amount of
detergent into the detergent-loading device usually lo
cated on the upper-left side of the top of the washer.
You can tell what the correct amount of detergent is by
reading the detergent container. Often times, this is not
given in the form of written instructions. Frequently, it's
just a line on the scoop or cap. Freshman year, someone
stole my scoop, so I had to estimate how much deter
gent I was holding in the palm of my hand.That was in
convenient, albeit somewhat refreshing in an unexpect
ed way.
Wash your clothes. This is usually done by closing

the door and press
ing a button. You
can get all fancy
with separating
your whites and
delicates and all
that jazz, but that's
a personal choice
(much like pubic
hair maintenance).
Dry your
clothes. Take your
wet clothes out of

the washer and place them in a dryer. Before you do so,
you should check the lint screen. A clogged lint screen
will cause your clothes to dry slower and could also
start a fire.There's nothing in that lint. Occasionally, de
pending on someone's personal choices, the lint might
have a pube, but don't worry — it's been washed and
dried by this point.
To prevent someone else from finding your pubes in
the lint screen, please clean it after you dry your clothes,
or you could make a personal choice that would elimi
nate the possibility of pubic hairs showing up in your
clothes altogether. Racy. Efficient. Probably going to
be itchy.
Which leads us into a nice transition about room eti
quette. Your room is your personal space. Ihus, it is a
space in which you will need to take care of some person
al things. ITiis might mean cutting your toenails, being
naked, masturbating furiously, or listening to Kenny
Loggins. Sometimes, you might do all of that at the same
time.That's line. Everyone likes Kenny Loggins.
However, do be considerate of your roommate. Ac
tually. be considerate of anyone that might come into
your room. Even if you have a single, the possibility that
someone else might see the place where you live is rea
son enough to keep things decent.

If you do have a roommate, learn his schedule. That
way. if you do decide to clear-cut your Australian Out
back, you won't hear a key in the door while you're de
ciding whether or not you could pull off a smiley face.
Same goes for masturbation.
Sex is different — since two people are involved, it's
not as easy to account for everyone's schedule. Figure
out a sign that people will recognize. 1 recommend.
"Hey. I'm having sex in here."That's usually enough.
You don't need to scream and grunt to make sure
everyone knows it's happening.The sign will be fine.
I'll give a few notes on balancing the sex thing with
the roommate thing. First, you probably should not
have sex with your roommate — although that seems
like it will fix the balancingthing.it will open up a whole
new can of worms.
Second, do not have sex with someone so often that
your roommate does not have access to his room. Not

"AT SOME POINT, YOU PROBABLY REALIZED THAT
EVERYONE, NO MATTER THEIR SIZE, AGE, OR IHUM
SECTION, DROPS A DEUCE AT SOME POINT DURING
THE WEEK. "

only is your roommate missing out on sex. but he's un
able to get work done. Speaking of which, why don't
you have work to do? (Jive your roommate a chance to
have sex for a while. You need to finish that problem
set.
Third, do not have sex with your roommate still in
the room. A roommate who normally would not want
to be in a room with you having sex is not suddenly
transformed into your number one sex fan simply be
cause that person fell asleep in his own bed. Be consid
erate. I lave sex some other time.
I'm exhausted, and I'm sick of giving advice to peo
ple that are currently only in my imagination. Still. 1
hope that 1 helped Tartouffe Michigan from Eagle
Rock. North Dakota, get more comfortable with his
new college environment. Basically, if you think about
other people's feelings,everyone will think that you are
a pretty decent individual. Stay clean, be constantly
aware of your situation and avoid inappropriate behav
ior.
If 1 had to sum up things-incoming-freshmen-need
to-know in one sentence, I would say. "Not pooping in
the sink is a good rule of thumb." It I were given two
sentences, my second one would be. "Oh, and have a
good year."
