# We Wish We had known
## 
### JACKIE BERNSTEIN IN PERMISSION SENIOR 
Oh, Freshman! Hie world is your oys
ter! Yet there are many things that you
do not yet know, things that you will
learn the hard way, and things that you
will never learn at all if no one tells you.
If I got to do it over again, here are the
things that 1 wish 1 had known from the
start:
Practical Daily Things
Bikes need to he locked. Really. If
you do not lock your bike, it will he
stolen. By me.To teach you a lesson.
Having printing money on your ID
card is one of those things that you don't
care about if you have it and are ex
tremely distraught about if you don't,
liven if you have a printer, the day will
come when you will have to use a print
kiosk. And on that day.the machine to
load your account will be broken, and
you shall suffer a grade reduction for
turning your paper in at 9:23 a.m.
Having a min-fridge and microwave
is your key to independence from the
Man: You will get hungry at 4 a.m. You
will not have a car. At this moment, you
will be thankful for your mini-fridge
and microwave.
The secret Safeway is far superior to
the normal Safeway in every capacity,
save for liquor, in which it is depressing

*
ly deficient; do not forget this last part.
There is nothing more humiliating than
making someone drive you to the secret
Safeway to buy booze and then having
to turn around because — oops — they
don't sell liquor.
Unique to Being a Freshman
Moving in packs of seven or larger is
a clear sign of your freshman status. It's
cool if your whole floor wants to go out
together, just remember that everyone
from a quarter mile away will know that
you are freshman. If your crew is on
bikes, aliens on the moon will know you
are a freshman.
IHUM is not really that hard. IHUM
will seem very stressful to you — at
least, at first. This has less to do with
IHUM and more to do with you being
stressed about classes. IHUM is actual
ly probably one of the easiest classes
you will ever take at Stanford. Do the
reading, go to some of the lectures,
never miss your section, and write your
papers early and have your TF proof
them. You'll be golden.
Being a freshman fall quarter is a
five-unit class — seriously. Treat your
fall quarter like another IHUM. You'll
find that you'll know a lot more about
Stanford than your friends who took 20
units fall quarter. And your life will be
much better.
Your energy and enthusiasm will

annoy and threaten upperclassmen.
Your status as a newbie is a mixed bless
ing — you are not yet jaded or cynical,
and you appear to get joy from tasks
that most upper classmen loathe, such
as running data sets or making fliers. For
this, you are more threatening than you
know, and that is why the senior in your
lab hates you.
Obscure, upper-division classes are a
blessing. If you walk into a classroom,
and it is full of grad students, you are. in
fact, in luck. These classes tend to be
smaller, more laid back, and you won't
have to contend with dozens of over
eager froslf Look for classes with no or
few prerequisites.
On Relationships, Parties and Other
Social Things
Do not date yourTA. No matter how
attractive you think they are, how bril
liant they seem to be, you will almost
lose your lust once they have given you
your grade. If you really like them, wait
ing a quarter won't be so bad.
Do not trick your RA into making
out with you, drinking with you or doing
otherwise illegal activities. They are
weak. They shall crack. It's not kind to
taunt them.
Everyone in your freshman dorm
will remember who you made out with.
So be scrupulous — or sneaky. Dorm
cest happens. Floorcest happens. But no

one
ever
for
gets.

Never

front-load
alcohol for

any event, especially Full Moon on the
Quad. With no alcohol allowed in Frosh
common spaces, it's understandable
how this happens. But, if you find your
self with your group of friends, rapidly
pounding drinks before it's time to go
somewhere, I guarantee that you will re
gret your decision the next morning.
FMOTQ is notorious for this. Watch
yourself. You have four years of drink
in&at Stanford — there's no rush.
Co-op and upper-row parties rock
because you won't be able to find them.
You will go to Sigma Chi, and it will be
unfun. You will go to Bob, and it will be
unfun. You will begin to wonder where
the fun parties are. People will talk of
happy hours and wine and cheese
events, and you will not know what they
mean. When the time is right, you will
discover them.
