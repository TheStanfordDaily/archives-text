# Oh, the Places You Should Go
## 
### Kat Lewin Jackie Bernstein Designed by Alexander Naruhiko Chee 
Best Hook-Up Spots:
Q Memorial Church: Make up some new sins to repent
in the middle of Memorial Church. Don't spend too
long there on a Saturday night, though, or you'll catch
the early morning Sunday Mass rush.
112 \ Middle of the Oval: Spend some time with a lover
L § J admiring the beautiful twilight glow of MemChu. Or
i ust h°°k up on the grassy field around the flower bed.
f~~ Mausoleum: Check out the architecture and outdoor
L § It art on a romantic walk around the Mausoleum, then
spend some time canoodling on the steps between the
sphinxes. If defiling a sacred resting ground is a little
too creepy for you, then walk a few yards to the Arizona
Cactus Garden. Just watch where you sit to make sure
you don't get pricked.
( \ Hoover Tower: Steal a "Sleepless in Seattle"-style
L/jJ smooch at the top of the Tower while looking out over
Stanford grounds. Or else get frisky in the elevator: The
285-foot drop may make this the only elevator in the
world in which you have time for a quick fling without
hitting the emergency stop button. Don't let the
tourists taking photos throw you off.
112 Post office: Although the post office isn't the most
LOJ; romantic building on campus, it is open 24 hours a day,
and it's usually empty at night. Take a companion there
for privacy if you both have one-room doubles, or just
hang out there alone when your roommate has sexiled
you yet again.

Fountain Hopping:
□ The Claw: Forget Lake Lag, this fountain in White
Plaza is the place to see and be seen (in your bikini)
come Spring Quarter. Friday afternoons, many
students bring sunglasses, beverages and inflatable
rafts to lounge in the blue. Just don't poke an eye
out climbing the Claw statue.
□ Red Hoop Fountain: Many groups of streakers like
to take a splash in this fountain (which, lore has it,
resembles a bent toothbrush) before running
through nearby Meyer Library. However, this
fountain is frequently turned off for weeks at a time
because of its erratic and illogical cleaning schedule.
O Tanner Fountain (in front of MemAud): This
fountain's large size, bright nighttime lighting and
strong jets of water make it a perennial FoHo-ing
favorite. If your roommate hasn't showered in a few
weeks, this is your best bet: The strong currents of
water will wash some of the grease out of his hair,
and, as a bonus, Kal kids frequently pour soap in this
fountain as a prank.
OOld Union Fountain: The fountain in New Old
Union isn't built to accommodate a crowd of
fountain hoppers, but it's a good place to dip your
toes at the start of a fountain binge. This one is
located in the middle of the Old Union square.
There's nothing quite as satisfying as casually
splashing around in it, watching the suckers in White
Plaza hustling off to class.
Lunch Spots:
( Thai Cafe: This cafe, located in the basement of the
|u |/j psych building, can be intimidating on your first
visit. The people who run it expect you to know
exactly what you want from the second you get in
line and have no time to waste while you choose
between entrees. The key is efficiency: Your first
time, either go with a cafe regular or point at the
guy in front of you and ask for"whatever he got."The
food is yummy enough to be worth the hassle.
C Bookstore Cafe: The second-floor cafe is the only
[2 jfl place you can still get a good deal in the Bookstore.
Nnhm# You can feast on a bowl of soup and half a Parisian
baguette for a paltry $4 —and if you're still hungry,
pick up a pastry for less than two bucks. Just be on
the look-out for yourTAs when you eat there
starving grad students have been known to haunt
the place for days on end.
r Olives: This may not be authentic Mediterranean
®11 1 cu ' sine ' b ut it' s a ste P U P fr° m your dining hall's
falafel; after a few years on campus, you'll begin to
forget what real food tastes like, anyway. Olives is
best to visit before lines get crazy during the 11:50
rush. Whatever you do, make sure to get there
before it closes at 2:30 or you'll spend the rest of the
day mourning the gyro that never was.
C ujfi Cubberly Cafe: This bookstore in the basement of
k}| T\ the School of Education is convenient for snack
N«Ur breaks when you're hitting the library: The line isn't
as long as the one at Moonbeans, and the food
selection is better. They sell fresh sandwiches, a
huge assortment of baked goods and standard
snacks like chips and candy. But leave your debit
card behind —the cafe is strictly cash-only.
C uah Bytes Cafe: For all the fuzzies out there, this deli
l@ J/] cious cafe (in the Packard Electrical Engineering
>»■■/ Building) might be the best-kept secret on campus.
The menu is small, but the food is fresh and
prepared with high-quality ingredients. Menu high
lights include panini sandwiches and to-die-for
personal pizzas.
/ >v Cool Cafe: If dining hall fare isn't cutting it, a salad
©IT or sandwich from Cool Cafe may just be worth the
trek all the way to Cantor. Make sure to eat on the
patio overlooking the Rodin Sculpture Garden and
Gates of Hell.
Frisbee Golf:
a First hole: Par 5. Tee off in the parking lot behind
Kresge Auditorium, standing next to the Nathan
Allen Parking Lot sign. Aim for the circular planter in
front of the Law School Courtyard.

Second hole: Par 3. Throw from the Law School
WW J Court V ar d (be sure to be quiet after midnight, or
150 people will sue you for public disturbance) and
aim for the landing of the staircase up to Meyer
Library.
Q Third hole: Par 5. After you stop to make fun of the
people who are already pulling all-nighters in
Meyer's 24-Hour Room, tee off from anywhere on
the Meyer balcony. Your goal is to toss the Frisbee
through the Language Corner arch in the quad.
Q Fourth hole: Par 3. From the Language Corner, fly
your Frisbee into the circle of dirt surrounding the
palm tree behind MemChu.
( Fifth hole: Par 5. This one's tricky if there's a sharp
[rail wind: Throw the Frisbee to the lamppost up the hill
from the Geology Corner.
Q Sixth hole: Par 5. Toss from the bricked area at the
base of the Geology Corner stairs and aim for the
square planter in front of theTerman Engineering
Building. Careful, though: The Frisbee must actually
land inside the corner to be worth any points.
t \ Seventh hole: Par 4. Tee off by the brick stairs near
Ict I I the quad and hit the fourth concrete support on
Wnmiinr Terman.
t \ Eighth hole: Par 2. Throw from anywhere near the

building in front ofTerman Pond).
Q Ninth hole: Par 4. Tee off from the archway by
Terman Pond and aim for the "Caution! Door
opening!"square in front ofTerman Auditorium
(room 153). If you're playing Stanford Frolf during a
school day, bonus points if the Frisbee ricochets off
students who are watching a lecture in the audito
rium.
Q Tenth hole: Par 4. From Terman, toss the Frisbee
toward the Daily Office (that would be the Storke
Publication Courtyard). Hit the pillar that says
"Press Courtyard Directory" for full points. Then
stop to make fun of The Chappie for being less cool
than Intermission.
£~"\ Eleventh hole: Par 3. Tee off in the concrete area
between Mitchell and Peterson Engineering and hit
w0 the circular flyer kiosk back in front of the Geology
Corner of the quad. If your Frisbee hits a flyer for a
sketchy psych study, you may sign up for the study
for extra points.
112 A Twelfth hole: Par 4. Tee off by Geology Corner and
LJ I aim for second palm tree on the left side of the
HwiiiP quad (between the Geology Corner and the Math
Corner). Try not to hit the Gay Liberation statue on
your way there.
t Thirteenth hole: Par 5. Tee off at the gates on the
LcJ I left-hand side of the quad and aim for the center
stone in the tile Rosette in the middle of the quad.

the Centennial Memorial Fountain In front of the
Bing Wing of Green Library.
0 Fifteenth hole: Par 4. Toss from the area between
the fountain and the quad (dodge any errant bikes)
and aim for the flyer kiosk between the Language
Corner and Cubberly.
a Sixteenth hole: Par 5. Tee off at the Clock Tower
and throw toward the Bird Cage in White Plaza.
Don't let the disk ricochet off of a frat party banner,
though: It's got to hit metal to count.
112 A Seventeenth hole: Par 4. Roll up your pants and
J tee off from anywhere inside The Claw fountain.
The hole Is either bollard between the back corners
of the Bookstore and post office.
a Eighteenth hole: Par 5. Tee off from the walkway

the Emergency Assembly Point by the sculpture on
theKresge Lawn. Victory!

Study Spots:
Green Library: The library mega-mecca. Check out
the Johnson Reading Room, the Bender Room and
the first-floor nook behind the periodicals.
C' v\ Law Library: Make sure to go incognito—a few
years ago, the law students raised holy hell when
they found out that undergrads were utilizing their
sweet study space.
£ g Lane Medical Library: Ideal for some SERIOUS
studying. You'll get dirty looks if your pencil makes
scratching sounds.
Bookstore: A great place to meet up with one of
your TAs or profs. And coffee is dirt cheap until 11
a.m. Also, the pastries are pretty delicious.
ao at Terman: A decent group study
location, and, if you live on West Campus, it's not as
far as some of the alternatives.
112 v\ Math Library: Stanford has 19 libraries, and the
smaller ones are pretty much all quieter (but jankier)
than Green. The Math library is an excellent case in
point.
r . vj Community centers (El Centro, LGBT, etc): These
centers have the benefits of comfy couches, a sense
of solidarity and oftentimes free (!) printing.
Places to sneak into:
A Disclaimer: We are not recommending that you go to
these places because most of them involve breaking
the law. However, if you're willing to take that risk,
here's where to go.
Q Steam-tunneling: The classic frosh excursion, with
most explorers entering the pipe labyrinth next to
MemChu. Be very careful to know how to get out
before you go in, and watch out for hot pipes
second-degree burns are not unheard of.
0 MemChu: If you can figure out how to do it (we
won't tell you here), the roof of MemChu is one of
the coolest places to sneak up to on campus.
0 Basement of the History Corner lecture room:
Want to watch a movie at 3am...0n a huge screen?
This room is epic. And the history corner is usually
unlocked 24/7.
oMemAud Main Stage: Stand in the same place as
the Dali Llama, Bill Gates, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Yoyo Ma. Orate to your thousands. A great place
to get over PWR2 jitters.
Places to People-Watch:
Cantor Arts Center: Aside from the possibility of
u i spotting Patience Young—one of the curators and a
campus icon—tourists, local families, professionals
and wandering artist-types are all extremely enter
taining to observe.
White Plaza: Bring a towel and lay out on the grass
2 iby the Claw. You're bound to see your friends manl-
J cally pedaling to class, fountain-hoppers, that guy
with the dog that looks like a lamb and tour guides.
Be sure to heckle the tour groups (in good fun, of
course)!
FloMo field: If you don't know what sloshball Is, this
8 Jls the place to find out. Watch drunk frat boys duke it
y out with each other over a keg and a klckball. Infi
nitely amusing. Equally entertaining to partake In
the festivities.
Lake Lag Bench, next to the Elliot Programming
Center: Sit on this bench for 30 minutes and observe
' runners, dog-walkers and couples breaking up and
making up. A personal favorite.

Best Hook-Up Spots:

you don't get pricked.
( \ Hoover Tower: Steal a "Sleepless in Seattle"-style
L/jJ smooch at the top of the Tower while looking out over

Q Tenth hole: Par 4. From Terman, toss the Frisbee

Study Spots:
Green Library: The library mega-mecca. Check out
the Johnson Reading Room, the Bender Room and
the first-floor nook behind the periodicals.
C' v\ Law Library: Make sure to go incognito—a few
years ago, the law students raised holy hell when
they found out that undergrads were utilizing their
sweet study space.
£ g Lane Medical Library: Ideal for some SERIOUS
studying. You'll get dirty looks if your pencil makes
scratching sounds.
Bookstore: A great place to meet up with one of
your TAs or profs. And coffee is dirt cheap until 11
a.m. Also, the pastries are pretty delicious.
ao at Terman: A decent group study
location, and, if you live on West Campus, it's not as
far as some of the alternatives.
112 v\ Math Library: Stanford has 19 libraries, and the
smaller ones are pretty much all quieter (but jankier)
than Green. The Math library is an excellent case in
point.
r . vj Community centers (El Centro, LGBT, etc): These
centers have the benefits of comfy couches, a sense
of solidarity and oftentimes free (!) printing.
Places to sneak into:
A Disclaimer: We are not recommending that you go to
these places because most of them involve breaking
the law. However, if you're willing to take that risk,
here's where to go.
Q Steam-tunneling: The classic frosh excursion, with
most explorers entering the pipe labyrinth next to
MemChu. Be very careful to know how to get out
before you go in, and watch out for hot pipes
second-degree burns are not unheard of.
0 MemChu: If you can figure out how to do it (we
won't tell you here), the roof of MemChu is one of
the coolest places to sneak up to on campus.
0 Basement of the History Corner lecture room:
Want to watch a movie at 3am...0n a huge screen?
This room is epic. And the history corner is usually
unlocked 24/7.
oMemAud Main Stage: Stand in the same place as
the Dali Llama, Bill Gates, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Yoyo Ma. Orate to your thousands. A great place
to get over PWR2 jitters.
Places to People-Watch:
Cantor Arts Center: Aside from the possibility of
u i spotting Patience Young—one of the curators and a
campus icon—tourists, local families, professionals
and wandering artist-types are all extremely enter
taining to observe.
White Plaza: Bring a towel and lay out on the grass
2 iby the Claw. You're bound to see your friends manl-
J cally pedaling to class, fountain-hoppers, that guy
with the dog that looks like a lamb and tour guides.
Be sure to heckle the tour groups (in good fun, of
course)!
FloMo field: If you don't know what sloshball Is, this
8 Jls the place to find out. Watch drunk frat boys duke it
y out with each other over a keg and a klckball. Infi
nitely amusing. Equally entertaining to partake In
the festivities.
Lake Lag Bench, next to the Elliot Programming
Center: Sit on this bench for 30 minutes and observe
' runners, dog-walkers and couples breaking up and
making up. A personal favorite.

Best Hook-Up Spots:
Q Memorial Church: Make up some new sins to repent
in the middle of Memorial Church. Don't spend too
long there on a Saturday night, though, or you'll catch
the early morning Sunday Mass rush.
112 \ Middle of the Oval: Spend some time with a lover
L § J admiring the beautiful twilight glow of MemChu. Or
i ust h°°k up on the grassy field around the flower bed.
f~~ Mausoleum: Check out the architecture and outdoor
L § It art on a romantic walk around the Mausoleum, then
spend some time canoodling on the steps between the
sphinxes. If defiling a sacred resting ground is a little
too creepy for you, then walk a few yards to the Arizona
Cactus Garden. Just watch where you sit to make sure
you don't get pricked.
( \ Hoover Tower: Steal a "Sleepless in Seattle"-style
L/jJ smooch at the top of the Tower while looking out over
Stanford grounds. Or else get frisky in the elevator: The
285-foot drop may make this the only elevator in the
world in which you have time for a quick fling without
hitting the emergency stop button. Don't let the
tourists taking photos throw you off.
112 Post office: Although the post office isn't the most
LOJ; romantic building on campus, it is open 24 hours a day,
and it's usually empty at night. Take a companion there
for privacy if you both have one-room doubles, or just
hang out there alone when your roommate has sexiled
you yet again.

Fountain Hopping:
□ The Claw: Forget Lake Lag, this fountain in White
Plaza is the place to see and be seen (in your bikini)
come Spring Quarter. Friday afternoons, many
students bring sunglasses, beverages and inflatable
rafts to lounge in the blue. Just don't poke an eye
out climbing the Claw statue.
□ Red Hoop Fountain: Many groups of streakers like
to take a splash in this fountain (which, lore has it,
resembles a bent toothbrush) before running
through nearby Meyer Library. However, this
fountain is frequently turned off for weeks at a time
because of its erratic and illogical cleaning schedule.
O Tanner Fountain (in front of MemAud): This
fountain's large size, bright nighttime lighting and
strong jets of water make it a perennial FoHo-ing
favorite. If your roommate hasn't showered in a few
weeks, this is your best bet: The strong currents of
water will wash some of the grease out of his hair,
and, as a bonus, Kal kids frequently pour soap in this
fountain as a prank.
OOld Union Fountain: The fountain in New Old
Union isn't built to accommodate a crowd of
fountain hoppers, but it's a good place to dip your
toes at the start of a fountain binge. This one is
located in the middle of the Old Union square.
There's nothing quite as satisfying as casually
splashing around in it, watching the suckers in White
Plaza hustling off to class.
Lunch Spots:
( Thai Cafe: This cafe, located in the basement of the
|u |/j psych building, can be intimidating on your first
visit. The people who run it expect you to know
exactly what you want from the second you get in
line and have no time to waste while you choose
between entrees. The key is efficiency: Your first
time, either go with a cafe regular or point at the
guy in front of you and ask for"whatever he got."The
food is yummy enough to be worth the hassle.
C Bookstore Cafe: The second-floor cafe is the only
[2 jfl place you can still get a good deal in the Bookstore.
Nnhm# You can feast on a bowl of soup and half a Parisian
baguette for a paltry $4 —and if you're still hungry,
pick up a pastry for less than two bucks. Just be on
the look-out for yourTAs when you eat there
starving grad students have been known to haunt
the place for days on end.
r Olives: This may not be authentic Mediterranean
®11 1 cu ' sine ' b ut it' s a ste P U P fr° m your dining hall's
falafel; after a few years on campus, you'll begin to
forget what real food tastes like, anyway. Olives is
best to visit before lines get crazy during the 11:50
rush. Whatever you do, make sure to get there
before it closes at 2:30 or you'll spend the rest of the
day mourning the gyro that never was.
C ujfi Cubberly Cafe: This bookstore in the basement of
k}| T\ the School of Education is convenient for snack
N«Ur breaks when you're hitting the library: The line isn't
as long as the one at Moonbeans, and the food
selection is better. They sell fresh sandwiches, a
huge assortment of baked goods and standard
snacks like chips and candy. But leave your debit
card behind —the cafe is strictly cash-only.
C uah Bytes Cafe: For all the fuzzies out there, this deli
l@ J/] cious cafe (in the Packard Electrical Engineering
>»■■/ Building) might be the best-kept secret on campus.
The menu is small, but the food is fresh and
prepared with high-quality ingredients. Menu high
lights include panini sandwiches and to-die-for
personal pizzas.
/ >v Cool Cafe: If dining hall fare isn't cutting it, a salad
©IT or sandwich from Cool Cafe may just be worth the
trek all the way to Cantor. Make sure to eat on the
patio overlooking the Rodin Sculpture Garden and
Gates of Hell.

FloMo field: If you don't know what sloshball Is, this
8 Jls the place to find out. Watch drunk frat boys duke it
y out with each other over a keg and a klckball. Infi
nitely amusing. Equally entertaining to partake In
the festivities.
Lake Lag Bench, next to the Elliot Programming
Center: Sit on this bench for 30 minutes and observe
' runners, dog-walkers and couples breaking up and
making up. A personal favorite.
