# DOING STANFORD ALL YEAR LONG
## 
### DEVON MAYLIE INTERMISSION OLD TIMER 
This piece originally ran on Sept. 22,2004.
There was a time at Stanford when corduroys were re
stricted to seniors; students from different graduating
classes were distinguished by the kind of hat they wore;
freshmen were dunked in tubs in Encina Hall — then
an all-male dorm — and students soaked up the sun on
Lake Lagunita. While these customs are long gone,
Stanford is still rich in offbeat traditions, from the Band
run in September to Wacky Walk at Commencement,
All year long. Stanford students can participate in a
range of activities that will give them a sense of home,
camaraderie and what exactly it means to be a Stanford
student. Here is a guide for incoming students to learn
the campus lingo, understand the history of the Cal ri
valry and discover a hidden place to make out.
FALL QUARTER
Full Moon on the Quad
Under the light of the first full moon of the quarter,
freshmen boys become men and freshmen girls become
women with the kiss of a senior, according to legend.
Full Moon on the Quad is also a favorite event for non
seniors to pucker up with a generous crowd. Originally,
the tradition was for couples to congregate in the Quad
to share a kiss under the moonlight.
Band Run
Meet the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band on a run through campus. With the tree in tow, the
run culminates in the Quad.
Flicks
Procrastinate on Sunday nights in Memorial Auditori
um at Flicks. Weekly movies are screened for free at 8
p.m. and 10 p.m. to undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. Flicks is not just a movie — it's a paper fight too.
San Francisco scavenger hunt

Get to know your dorm mates during a hunt in the big
city. From Big Al's sex shop to the tattoo parlor, the
team that executes the most outrageous assignments
(wearing the fewest pieces of clothing) is the winner.
Stanfor-dictionary
Learn what CoHo. FloMo, Pro Fro, MemChu and
FroSoCo mean. Or eschew them.
Big Game, Dec. 4
This battle of brawn is fought on the football field on
Dec. 4 between two schools whose students are more
renowned for their brains. The yearly rivalry began in
1892 when the older University of California chal
lenged fledgling Stanford to a friendly match. The inex
perienced Stanford boys had no equipment, no coach,
no uniforms and no playing field litis year the two meet
at Stanford for their 110 th match-up.
Pre-Big Game pump-ups: Rally. Countdown and Red
Hot Prof competition
In April 1899, during a pre-game bonfire rally, the
yell leader introduced a real axe into his "Give 'em the
axe" chant.directed toward Cal.The axe was used to de
capitate a straw effigy dressed in Cal's colors, gold and
blue. After Stanford's loss, Cal students nabbed the axe
and held it captive until 1930, when Stanford students
recovered it in a daring heist.The rescuers were immor
talized as the Stanford 21.
Today, the Axe Committee protects the battle
weapon and pumps up the spirit of the student body.
Camping out in White Plaza before the two teams crash
helmets, the committee marks each hour leading to the
game with the sounding of a train whistle.
Gaieties
Big Game season is not complete without Gaieties — a
student-written, -produced and -directed musical per
formed in preparation for Stanford's match against Cal.
Special performances by President John Hennessy and
other members of the administration are coupled with
shots at Cal. Dorms often reserve group seats in Memo
rial Auditorium to witness a show where anything goes.
Sixth Man Club

As football season comes to a close, basketball begins in
a newly renovated Mfples Pavilion. Sit in the student
section and cheer Stanford to victory. Who knows,
maybe Tiger Woods will show up at a game again this
year.
Secret Snowflake
In the spirit of the holiday season, dorm mates are se
cretly paired to devise embarrassing antics for their
partner to perform in front of their housemates.
Primal Scream
At midnight each night during Dead Week, students
yell at the top of their lungs from their windows to re
lieve their end-of-quarter stress and anguish.
WINTER QUARTER
Dorm ski trips
Hit the slopes or play poker in the cabin during dorm
ski trips to Tahoe and other nearby snow-bunny hot
spots.
Library Check-out
Hook up in Green Library's South Stacks, amidst rows
of dusty books. Hey, at least there's no roommate.
Screw Your Roommate
An opportune time to get set up with that hot chick you
have had your eye on in 1-Hum or that guy in the dorm
next door. The perfect blind date dance — set up your
roommate with a date, and your roommate sets you up.
Parents' Weekend
Parents invade campus for "back to school" lectures,
Q&A with Hennessy, special performances by campus
groups and, of course, quality time on campus with you.
Viennese Ball
The Viennese Ball Committee hosts the event so you
can show off your twinkle toes. Make sure you are
dressed appropriately — gowns and tuxedos are the
norm. The group normally charges students to attend
the event, but this policy created a stir on campus last
year. Some argued that the committee could not charge
students since it already received ASSU Special Fees.
Midnight Breakfast
Students take a break during paper-writing season for a
midnight meal, served by the University president and
other administrators. It is an annual event for students,
staff, and faculty to bond over bagels.
SPRING QUARTER
Fountain-hopping
Jump into a fountain to cool off on a hot day. Just watch
out for the red hoop one in front of Green — the bot
tom is sharp.

I risbee Golf
Run around campus throwing Frisbees at designated
landmarks. Nighttime preferable.
The Game
A 24-hour hunt where students decode elaborate clues
that lead to a final destination. First to solve all the clues
is the winner.
Assassins
Water gun in hand, perform covert missions to tag dorm
mates. Last one who has not been soaked is the winner.
Competition to be the Tree.
Adopted as a spoof on mascot selection processes at
other universities, the competition to become the TYee
was created by members of the Band in 1973. The Tree
accompanies the Band at athletic events and can also be
seen at on-campus rallies.
Tree hopefuls execute outrageous stunts (such as
scaling Hoover Tower) to win the honored position.The
Tree, however, is not the official symbol of the Univer
sity - that would be Cardinal, the color. In 1930, the Uni
versity adopted the Indians as an additional mascot.
Due to concern that the mascot presented a racist
stereotype of Native Americans, in 1972 the ASSU
voted to discontinue the Indians. Stanford students
then picked Robber Barons as the mascot, but the Ath
letic Department ignored their wishes and decided to
stick with simply the Cardinal.
Pledge Parties
New pledge classes throw elaborate bashes to out-do
their fellow fraternities.
Exotic Erotic
No entrance with more than two pieces of clothing.This
party was once rated by Playboy magazine as one of the
wildest on any college campus.
Admit Weekend
Be a RoHo or a HoHo and hang out with a Pro Fro.
Boat Dance
Dorms rent a floating vessel and hit the deck to con
clude freshmen dorm bonding.
Wacky Walk at Commencement
Only Grad students walk in straight lines. Undergrads
must pour into the stadium unorganized, chaotic and
dressed down, often with only cap and gown and noth
ing underneath.
Steam tunneling
Explore Stanford's underground tunnels, but watch out
for rats and asbestos. Also, be sure not to get locked in,
as that would lower your chances of returning for soph
omore year.
