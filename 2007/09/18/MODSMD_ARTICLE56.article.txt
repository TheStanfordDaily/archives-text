How to be THAT kid in IHUM:
| In every IHUM class, there will be that kid. You'll quickly be able to
identify him or her: They'll always be on time, early even, arid will have
their lips so securely fastened to your TF's hindquarters that you'll be
amazed that they can talk so much. And talk they will. In fact, they won t
stop talking. Your first IHUM section, everyone will be out to prove that
they belong at Stanford, and everyone will be trying to be smarter than that
other kid who just dropped the Emily Dickenson reference — hint: it in
volves a lot of dashes. Use these helpful guidelines to identify the IHUM
kid(s) in your section, and please try to resist the urge to punch them in the
face.
1. IHUM kids start every sentence with the words. "1 feel that..."This is the
main phrase to look out for. If someone uses it, they have proven that they
don't think about what they are saying, they only feel it.
2. They do all the reading. TWice.
3.They use the words "dichotomy,""juxtaposition" or "anachronistic" in any
combination.
4.They finish thoughts with needless addendums such as "ergo," "therefore"
and "whereas."
5. They refer to a canon like it's not something on a pirate ship.

6. They say "vis-a-vis" and don't mean the brand of marker.
7.They use an excessive number of Latin phrases like "quid pro quo"
or "ipso facto" because they took Latin as a foreign language in high
school.

8. They think that ethos, pathos and logos are their best friends.
9. They start every sentence with the word "basically." So, um, basi
cally, they don't really know what they're saying, they just basically!
want to talk for the sake of talking. Basically.
10. Here's a fun one. They refer to chapters you haven't read yet or
aren't even supposed to have read."l know we're not supposed to be
at Chapter 13 yet, but if you read ahead then you'll see that..." Hey,

IHUM kid — way to make everyone in your section feel like an idiot.
Oh, by the way, now they hate you.
1 l.They refer to the argument the professor made in lecture. Yes, it can
be supportive and enlightening, but it also calls out the kids who slept
through lecture. (
12. When they finish, you realize that they've word vomited all over your
shirt — they haven't actually said anything of value. And you realize J
that you can never get the time they spent jabbering back. (Don't worry,
word vomit comes out with bleach.)
