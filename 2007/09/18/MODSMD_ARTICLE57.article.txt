# Frosh talk
## 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION LINGUIST 
Small talk is an awkward and undevel
oped skill for all people, but particularly
for Stanford students. During high school,
most future Stanford students were doing
research and studying during homecom
ing. Because of this social inexperience,
many of us come to campus confused
about how to get to know each other.
Like most things in our lives, we devel
op a standard, regular formula for com
munication. In the case of small talk, these
standards come in the form of basic "get
ting to know you" questions. The main
problem with small talk is that it sounds
trite because it's formulaic. The clever stu
dent. however, can find a way to avoid
sounding cliche. Start out by fol
lowing up on these questions with cre
ati v e

questions. For example:
"Where are you from? "
"Sacramento?"
"Oh really ? Are the cops friendly in the
Sacramento?"
The other thing to do is to throw these
questions completely out the window and
ask about topics that you actually think
are relevant or interesting. For example:
"What do you think about the investment
of government funds into hydrogen fuels
versus other types of green tech?"
or
"What would you like the next president
to do in and for Iraq?"
This may throw people off at first, and
your question may be met with a moment
of silence and confusion, but I promise
that Orientation will be far more interest
ing because of it.
The best way to inform the upperclass
men of your freshman status (aside from
wearing your lanyard around your neck)
is through conversation. Here are

some questions to avoid:

1. Where are you from?
As you progress through your
Stanford career, this question will
develop as well. At first, it means,
"What is your hometown?" Gradu
lally, it becomes, "What dorm are
you in?" Eventually, you are going
to have to notice the switch, hope
fully without making the social faux
pas of answering the former late in

the year.
"Sacramento."
"Noooo, 1 mean what dorm?"
2. What IHUM are you taking?"
As with "Where are you from?" this
question will evolve. It will, however, be
mostly tonal, from the intonation of anx
ious curiosity to anger and bitter disap
pointment, especially if you have the

workload of Mass Crusades and Geno
cide.
3. Are you a techie or fuzzy, and what are
you majoring in?
I actually had an odd Admit Weekend
experience because of this ominous ques
tion. 1 call the question ominous because
if you are a fuzzy, you know that the engi
neering major you are talking to is judg
ing you. If you have not learned this al
ready, then you will: many techies, espe
cially in their early months at Stanford,
have a superiority complex about their
majors. I do not hate techie majors — in
fact, my two best friends and my
boyfriend are all techies — but I vividly
remember my discussion with some guy
from Admit Weekend.
"Fuzzy or techie? "
"Fuzzy?"
"Wait, which one?"
"I'm a history major."
" Well, I guess that's respectable."
4. Where else did you apply?
The question that everyone knows the
answer to but is going to ask anyway. I've
never quite understood the purpose of
this question, but it seems to be essential
ly about sizing everyone else up. I think
that everyone feels a bit out of place and
questions whether he or she belongs here.
I can assure you that Richard Shaw is an
evil genius who makes no mistakes, so we
all know that you got into and belong at
an elite school.
5. Why did you decide to come to Stan
ford?
This question is, perhaps, more com
monly asked by staff members than any
one else. The answer? The weather was
awesome, and the girls were hanging out
in bikinis reading chemistry books.
