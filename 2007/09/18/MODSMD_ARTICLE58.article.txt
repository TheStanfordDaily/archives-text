ROXY SASS
INTERMISSION MILKMAID
The campus is filled with fresh meat and Roxy
is first in line for the NSO buffet. Young frosh,
you have before you four years of dormcest.
awkward laundry room hook-ups and indis
criminate dance floor humping. Think of Stan
ford as Human Sexuality 101. The following is
a syllabus prepared by Dr. Roxy; read it. learn
it and get ready for more hands-on lab experi
ence than you can handle.
Obligatory course rules: 1) Just because Cap
tain Morgan is saying "yes" doesn't make it
consensual. 2) There's no way to study for a
chlamydia test, so make sure to always wear a
condom (and a bike helmet, if you're a grad
student). 3) The best way to get to know a stu
dent body is by exploring a few of its student
bodies. Here are some Stanford-specific posi
tions to get you in the mood.

The Green Gambol: The best part of having a
study buddy with benefits is taking steamy
study breaks. All that talk about Balzac can get
a girl hot. Forget the South Stacks:The place to
go in Green for a quasi-clandestine hook-up is
the "Being John Malkovich"stacks in the Bing
Wing — those half-height floors filled with ob
scure books nobody checks out. Ladies, perch
yourself on a deserted desk and wrap your legs
around your man, and make sure to wear a
skirt for easy access. This way, if some random
grad student wanders in. he won't get a good
look at the action. Gentlemen, remember, in a
public place speed is king: Bone up on anato
my books in advance because you don't have
time for a 20-minute detour on the way to her
G-spot. You may flunk the midterm you're
studying for, but your partner will give you a
four point ohhhhhh.
Lagunita Mini-Double-Header: Most one
room doubles on campus are so small that with

one wrong move, your cozy little twosome
might become a surprise boytoy-plus-his-for
merly-sleeping-roommate sandwich. Roxy
says why not use it to your advantage? If you
and your lover stumble back to his place and
his roomie has already crashed, don't wake the
poor guy up just to sexile him — that's plain
bad manners. Instead, with a few well-orches
trated moans and sexy dirty talk on your part,
soon he'll be wide awake and rarin' to join in.
ITiis segues perfectly into...
The HooverTower:A position a trois (which is
French for "stop counting and just do me al
ready") perfect for getting wild. Two partners
engage in doggy-style while the lucky bastard
in front receives oral (that's the Hoover) from
the middle partner. ITic bread layers of the
sexwich support themselves by leaning into a
double high-five over the middle partner
(that's the Tower.) While you're going at it. try
to refrain from making witty comments about
the height of the tower's shaft — it's not polite
to talk with your mouth full.
New Old Union of the Monkey: Roxy knows
how hard it can be to get out of that mission
ary-doggie-cowgirl-repeat rut. so for a mid
quarter pick-me-up, try this Kama Sutra gem.
Gentlemen, lay flat on your back with your
thighs against your chest and lower legs
straight up in the air, then seat your partner on
the backs of your thighs. Thrust while lifting
your partner's torso with your feet. Warning:
Do not attempt this on a bunk bed.or it will re
sult in bruised foreheads and bent or broken
machinery. Like the epic three-year construc
tion on Stanford's New Old Union, sex in this
position is complicated, labor-intensive and
lasts for quite a while. Unlike the majority of
Stanford construction projects (legend has it
that the crane-filled abyss by Wilbur was once
a field...), it will end in your lifetime.
Enjoy your homework over the next four
years, and be sure to let Roxy know if you feel
you're falling behind. She'd be glad to give you
a little one-on-one tutoring
