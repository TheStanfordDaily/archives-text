# 5 Habits of Highly Annoying Roommates
## 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION ROOMINATOR 
Since the dawn of dorms, roommates
have possessed the power to make or
break the entire higher education experi
ence. There have been good roomies, de
cent roomies, distant roomies, and even
invisible roomies (usually athletes who
disappear disturbingly early in the morn
ing to lead healthy lives).
But as luck and statistics would have
it, each year will find some students fac
ing that scourge of humanity - the awful
roommate. This isn't just the annoying
roommate or the awkward roommate or
the roommate whose "quirky charms"
gradually become bothersome. No, this is
the roommate who makes Attila the Hun
look like a keeper, and who will have you
praying for super-long PWR papers to
take you away to the library.
At this point, you've only just moved
in, and figuring out the fridge situation
probably hasn't fully revealed the charac
ter of your other half. So it seems only fair
to warn you about what might lie ahead.
"The Slob" — Let's face it: when you
filled out that disconcertingly short ques
tionnaire about your personal habits, you
probably cleaned yourself up a little.
Don't worry, we all did it. Nobody really
cares that you listed yourself as a six on
the messiness scale when you're really a
10. The problem comes when you're
rooming with another so-called six who's
really a 27. If you find yourself returning
from class every day to discover that a
tornado has hit your room,you're in trou
ble. 71ie solution? "Encouragement." A
pile of "recovered" items atop a bed and
the holiday gift of a dust buster all subtly
say you care.
"Hie Hygienic Hazard" — Perhaps
even more terrifying than The Slob is the
biohazard roommate. He clips his toe
nails over the carpet, leaves used tissues
strewn in his wake and, when feeling
deathly ill. takes a liking to hanging out
on your bed. Short of quarantining him in
the laundry room, you have few options.
Those not willing to become a pre-med in

hopes of discovering a miracle cure for
his general ickiness will probably want to
invest in a hazmat suit and a gas mask. At
the very least, boil water and sterilize
your belongings from time to time.
"The Borrower" — For those who
didn't quite grasp the concept in kinder
garten, learning how to share is part of
being a roommate. It's nice, too, to discov

books and snacks. But when you sudden
ly find your shrinking collection of tank
tops to be directly proportional to her
growing one, well, it doesn't take a math
major to figure out what's up. For those
not big on confrontation, remember that
the best defense is a good offense: be
come a Hygienic Hazard yourself. After
all, nobody wants that kid's stuff.

cially awkward kid down the hall will
agree that friends are fun. It's not so en
joyable, however, when your roomie
challenges his buddies to a 24-hour video
game marathon or tells her friends that
your room is now "party central." While
living with friends seems like a dream, it
only takes about a week before privacy,
quiet time and sleep become essential.

one benefit of such living conditions'? By
the end of the year, you'll be able to sleep
through just about anything.
"The Romantic" — Love is, well,
lovely. Really. It should bring us all hope
to see it flourishing, whether on-campus
or long-distance. It can be tough to keep
that perspective, though, when your
roomie cuddles and coos with his girl
friend or webcams with her boyfriend
into the wee hours of the morning. Ideal
ly, such constant exposure to the joys of
romance would inspire you to look for
love yourself, but no one's going to blame
you if you start humming "The Breakup
Song."
"The Chatterer" — Yes, you have
friends and family at home, and yes, it can
be difficult to be away from them. But
once your roommate's phone begins to
meld with her ear, you can be pretty sure
that things have gone too far. After all,
does she really need to chat with her
friends while you're napping, with her
parents while you're working, and with
her friend down the hall while you're de
bating the best way to kill her? This one's
easy: People lose cell phones all the time
at college, so who's going to suspect you?
"The Oblivious Cohabiter" — Last
but not least comes the roomie with no
sense of personal space. This is the one
who wanders around naked, who doesn't
understand concepts like privacy, and
whose trouble with fractions means he
confuses his half of the room with the
whole of the room. The answer to your
problem lies in some combination of
locks, blindfolds and an invisible electric
fence (all three, if you can manage it).
But honestly, where's getting angry
going to get you? It's hardly the solution
to your problem. Instead, consider your
roommate a spouse from whom separa
tion, annulment and divorce are not op
tions. Who knows? Maybe it'll save you
some time in couples' counseling down
the road. After all. college is a learning
experience.


er that you have two wardrobes at your "The Constant Host" — College is all After awhile,politeness goes out the win
