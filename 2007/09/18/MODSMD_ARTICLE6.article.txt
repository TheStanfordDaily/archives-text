## Transgender rights added to policy revision Nondiscriminatory Policy expands to include gender identity 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Students will likely not notice a two
word change when they crack open the first
page of their 2007-2008 Bulletin, hut these
two words are groundbreaking ones for
transgender rights at Stanford. The phrase
"gender identity" has been added to Stan
ford's Statement of Nondiscriminatory Pol
icy — a change many in the transgender
rights community celebrate, even though its
practical impact remains unclear.
The Statement of Nondiscriminatory
Policy prohibits discrimination in the
"rights, privileges, programs and activities
generally accorded or made available to stu
dents at the University."The statement also
forbids discrimination "in the administra
tion of its educational policies, admissions
policies, scholarships and loan programs,
and athletic and other University-adminis
tered programs" consistent with "its obliga
tions under the law."
"Gender identity" is specifically listed in
the second sentence.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman said that a committee of senior
administrators convened to propose this
policy revision, which President John Hen
nessy recently accepted. Boardman said that
the phrase will be added to the Administra
tive Guide and "applies to students, staff and
faculty alike."
"Regarding the ramifications of the poli
cy." Boardman added."l believe that the re
vision sends a strong message that Stanford
is interested in addressing and supporting
the needs of the transgender community."
The policy change comes about thanks to
a group of transgender students and allies
who geared up a campaign for transgender
rights during the 2006-2007 academic year.
Harriet 07, a transgender student and
movement organizer who asked not to be
identified by her real name, estimated that
the University is home to "several dozen"
transgender students, faculty and staff.
With the backing of the LGBT-CRC, ;i
LGBT law student group called OUTLAW

and Safe and Open Spaces at Stanford, the
students calling for a policy change began
meeting with top-level administrators.
LGBT-CRC Director and Assistant Dean of
Students Ben Davidson '04 said administra
tors were willing to learn more about gender
identity issues and ways for their offices to
be more responsive.
"I think the change will send a strong
message to current and prospective students
— as well as to faculty and staff — that
Stanford takes the needs of the transgender
members of our community seriously," he
said. "I imagine it will be especially encour
aging to those who are closeted or question
ing their gender identities."
According to Harriet, the central issue of
the transgender rights campaign was health
care discrimination. Harriet said that the
student and faculty health insurance plans
contain clauses that deny care for transgen
der-related issues, such as hormone level
monitoring.
"[Vaden administrators] were very re
ceptive," she said. "They said they'd start
looking into making changes. The clauses
weren't there because of malicious intent —
it's just common for any health insurance
plan."
Although Harriet celebrated gains for
the transgender community such as the ad
dition of gender-neutral bathrooms to Old
Union, she said that transgender students
face a number of other obstacles besides
healthcare — such as roommate pairing.
"If a student is in transition or they have
transitioned, it can be hard getting them
paired up with a roommate who is accepting
of them." she said."ln the past. Stanford has
had single-sex rooming only."
But exactly what changes the new
Nondiscrimination Policy will bring about
remains unclear. Director of the Diversity
and Access Office Rosa Gonzalez said she
didn't know of any subsequent policy revi
sions in the works.
"Even with this change of language,
[transgendered persons] were already pro
tected by California law." she said. "We're
more than anything being explicit — it says
that Stanford is a very welcoming and di
verse place. Students, staff, they can make a
request and it would go through the same
