A taste of the Islands
Experience a taste of the tropics right in Palo Alto when you savor
Trader Vic's island-inspired cuisine and exotic cocktails. Escape to Trader
Vic's for a memorable dinner or for drinks and light fare in the Mai Tai
Lounge.
Start your visit with a Mai Tai, Trader Vic's most famous cocktail. This
refreshing rum-and-citrus concoction was invented more than 60 years ago
by Trader Vic's founder Vic Bergeron at the first Trader Vic's restaurant in
Oakland, California. Other tempting libations include the Fog Cutter, the
Potted Parrot and the Scorpion Bowl. The lounge offers a variety of small
plates and appetizers, such as Cosmo Tidbits, Crab Rangoon, Cheese
Bings, Bongo Bongo Soup and Barbecued Pork Spareribs.
Trader Vic's legendary cuisine blends Polynesian, Creole, Indian and
Chinese influences in fresh combinations. Some of the most popular items
on the dinner menu are prepared in the Chinese-style wood-fired oven,
including Indonesian Rack of Lamb and Pork Chops Hawaiian. Other
favorites are the Calcutta Curries and Mahi Mahi Steak with Macadamia
Nuts. Finish your meal with a tropical treat like Macadamia-Crusted Key
Lime Pie or Coconut Creme Brulee.
Trader Vic's has four dining areas that offer intimate art-filled settings. The

decor is Polynesian-inspired and features authentic giant wooden Tikis, masks and artwork from around the Pacific
Rim. Weather permitting, outdoor dining is offered on the lushly landscaped veranda.
Planning a private party or special event? The restaurant and adjacent banquet facility can accommodate up
to 250 guests in a variety of settings, from the formal dining room to a grand ballroom with cathedral ceilings.
