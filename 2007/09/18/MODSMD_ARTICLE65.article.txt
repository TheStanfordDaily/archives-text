Food is the national passion of Singapore and "Shiok!"
is the phrase most often heard uttered by a Singaporean
when he or she has enjoyed a meal.
Singapore is a multi-ethnic society made up of
Chinese, Malay, and Indian, whose immigrant forefa
thers brought with them rich food traditions from across
Asia.
Typical Singapore food is thus an exciting blend of
culinary heritage based on some of Asia's greatest cui
sine. This combination creates a unique and dynamic fla
vor livelier and far richer than the traditions from which
they stem.

Menu highlights include:
Seafood Mee Goreng: Indian-style pan-fried noodle with
prawns, calamari, onion, peas, carrots, potatoes, egg,
Chinese greens and beansprouts in a spicy sauce.
Singapore Pepper Crab: A very unique dish, starting with
fresh Dungeness crab and Chinese seasonings, adding
Indian black pepper, enriching the flavor with butter and
then tossing in Malay bird's-eye chilies for a knock-out
result. A must try!
Fragrant Chicken: Chicken marinated in fragrant shrimp
paste sauce and deliciously fried till crispy on the out
side and moist on the inside. Served with refreshing
side of pineapple cucumber chutney and sweet chili
sauce.
SHIOK! Singapore Kitchen offers a selection of authentic
Singaporean food in a casual and friendly environment.
We hope you will enjoy the flavors and find it a Shiok!
experience too! ■
