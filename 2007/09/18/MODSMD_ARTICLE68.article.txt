If you're seeking first-rate South Asian dining in the Palo Alto
area, look no further than Darbar Indian Cuisine, recently the
winner of the Best of Palo Alto award for Best Indian Food for
the fifth straight year.
The family-owned establishment, located just off
University Avenue on High Street, is handsomely furnished
with many traditional paintings gracing the walls. The service
is polite and impeccable, and waiters are happy to recom
mend good starting dishes.
And the food is fantastic. If you're starting with an appe
tizer, try the Vegetable Samosa or Pakora, onion fritters made
with lentil flour. For something meatier, beef, chicken, fish,
and prawn starters are also available.
Most main courses come with Pilau Rice and a generous

serving of Nan bread, useful for diluting the
spicy taste of most of the items on the menu.
The restaurant does a fine job with the quin
tessential Indian entree-Chicken Tikka
masala. His Tandoori chicken, served in a
mild, creamy sauce, is Darbar's most popu
lar dish. It makes a great entry point for
those unsure about what to order. Also high
ly recommended is the Mango Lassi, a sweet
drink made from mango juice and home
made yogurt. It's the perfect complement to
any meal at Darbar's.

The more adventurous connoisseur of
spicier foods will find much to enjoy here as well. Order the
Vindaloo and the waiters will warn you, 'That one is spicy."
They're not kidding. Whether you order chicken, shrimp,
lamb, prawns, beef, pork, or vegetable Vindaloo, eat slowly
to avoid sweating. Take advantage of the opportunity to
converse and savor the meal.
Dcirbar also caters to the vegetarian crowd with a wide

selection of meatless dishes. In addition to mixed vegetables
in curry sauce, Palak Paneer, creamed spinach and home
made farmer's cheese, comes recommended by the man
agement. Paneer Do Playza, farmer's cheese with bell pep
pers, onions, and spices, is another tasty option If you're
looking for a dining experience completely different from
typical American, Italian, or Mexican fare, stop by Darbar.
You won't be disappointed. â–
