Blue Chalk Cafe provides a great weekend alternative
for locals looking for a big-club atmosphere minus the 30
minute trek to the City or San Jose. On an average week
end, an estimated 500 people show up to this extremely
popular destination.
Catering to the 21 to 35 year-old crowd, Blue Chalk
attributes its success to its friendly bartenders, two fully
stocked bars, pool tables, shuffleboards, great food and
PLENTY of dance space. Even the 150 patrons they
expect on slow weeknights will have no trouble finding
room in the two level building. If the second floor bar is
too crowded, try making your way to the first floor and
its corner bar, where you can grab a cozy seat next to
one of two fireplaces. Too hot? Find a spot on the spa

cious patio out front.
The weekend at Blue Chalk starts on Thursday night
with Stanford Night and live bands from 7-10. As if
Stanford students weren't already regular goers, Blue
Chalk offers Beer Pong Thursday's, with $10 pitchers of
any beer from 9pm until close. Cover is only $5 on week
ends and the DJ switches over to Hip-Hop and R&B.
Blue Chalk is also open Monday thru Thursday, and
any small or large group can reserve space any day of
the week. Parking is available across the street under Palo
Alto City Hall, providing easy access-definitely a plus.
Blue Chalk's restaurant specializes in Southwest-inspired
cuisine (Left at Albuquerque menu) until 10 p.m. The
main attraction at Blue Chalk, however, is its nightlife. â–
