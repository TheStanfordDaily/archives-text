Located less than two miles from Stanford down El
Camino Real, Celia's Mexican Restaurant is a fine destina
tion for delicious and moderately priced south-of-the-bor
der cuisine.
The family-owned establishment is handsomely fur
nished for a restaurant with entrees ranging in price from
$8 to $17. Bright murals adorn the walls and handsome
wooden carvings grace the tops of the booths, evoking a
cantina in the dusty West more than a century ago.
The food served lives up to the precedent set by the
restaurant's decorations. Appetizers such as quesadillas,
nachos, and tortilla soup are all available for the diner
seeking a complete culinary experience, but the entrees
themselves are more than ample for all but the hungriest
patrons. Popular dishes include Carnitas con Polio and
Polio en Crema, both featuring sauteed chicken breasts
with bell peppers and onions. For those seeking the taste
of mariscos, or seafood, the Cancun Platter of crab,
prawns and chicken is a favorite. Celia's fajitas are also
delicious and are served piping hot, sizzling and snapping
as though they are still on the grill. Those seeking more
conventional fare will have no trouble at Celia's; the restau
rant offers a "North of the Border" section on their menu,
featuring New York Steak, burgers, and chicken sandwich-

es. For dessert, split a platter of Sopapillas, fried tortilla
chips with honey cinnamon and vanilla ice cream.
Service is polite, prompt, and attentive, keeping drinks
full and clearing "dead" plates unobtrusively. If you're seek
ing a wide selection of authentic Mexican cuisine at a price
that wont break the bank, you want to support a Peninsula
business, or you just want Mexican food good and close,
Celia's comes highly recommended. ■
