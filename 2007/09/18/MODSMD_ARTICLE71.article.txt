AAanager Attila Varsanyi reels off the names of Applewood Pizza's competition-Skip's,
Dominos, Pizza My Heart-but his eyes never reveal any fear, and that may be because he
knows he's already got the competition beat. The Los Altos pizza joint offers 18 different pie
combinations, but Varsanyi says the Menlo Combo with pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage,
and vegetables is the most popular. And for those that like to mix and match, Applewood
has 33 toppings to choose from, from standard favorites like anchovies and pineapple to the
more exotic smoked salmon and BBQ beef. The prices are right too, with a large one-top-

ping pizza going for just $12.75 and steep discounts offered for event catering.
* Applewood doesn't just do pizza either, with linguini and fettucini pasta offereings start
ing at just $5.75. Still Hungary? You can also try their Langos (Hungarian garlic bread), or
the ever-popular Hungarian goulash.
There are three Applewood locations to choose from; two on El Camino in nearby Menlo
Park, and one in Los Altos. The Los Altos location delivers to Stanford, so for a nominal deliv
ery fee, you too can enjoy an avocado and prawn pizza while penning your next IHUM mas
terpiece. ■
