Not just another of Palo Alto's cafe scene, Sehbali is a
cute little place with a difference — designed from head
to toe to be a student hangout. Conveniently located
next to Stanford Theater, Sehbali is nestled inside Mills
the Florist.
Named for a brother and sister, Sehbali is a twin
establishment with an exotic Arabian Nights theme. The
front is a cafe with a warm, inviting, 105-year classic
wood-toned ambience. In the back is the Sehbali
Hookah Shop.
Both Sehbalis feature free Internet, but with a twist.
Their wireless WiFi internet is the newest and fastest and
comes with expert technical support. There is also a
high-speed wired network, and an abundance of power
outlets.
The cafe features India's renowned Malabar
Monsoon, an organic, fair-trade, full bodied espresso
and coffee, with very low acidity and a slightly spicy,
astonishingly persistent aromatic crema -- very popular
in Europe since the British India Raj. Also served is a
wide variety of teas and exceptional home brewed plain
or subtly spiced Chai. Sehbali's chaat (a zesty Indian
"street" snack) and Mango Lassi (an Indian Yogurt drink)
haves become smashing hits. With an international fla
vor, Sehbali sports a wide variety of great sandwiches,

including their flagship Sehbali Prime Rib, as well as a
selection of salads, wraps and savory pies. As for
desserts and flavored drinks, simply sinful.
The adjoining Hookah Shop is a buzzing Arabian
Nights scene, where you can hang out with your date or
friends and smoke a shared Hookah (water pipe). The
emphasis is on culture, congregation and togetherness.
And the water-filtered smoke is unique, with a variety of
fruit flavored aromatic tobaccos. Did I mention belly
dance nights?
For fine food, a good time or simply to relax or
study, lap-top friendly Sehbali is the place, so hot, and
oh sooo cool. ■
