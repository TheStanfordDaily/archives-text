Wa, k into Chef Chu's and
you are immediately drawn to
the framed photographs that
hang near the front desk. The
owner, Lawrence Chu, with
Margaret Thatcher. Chu with
Benazir Bhutto. Chu with John
F.Kennedy Jr. The list of digni
taries and celebrities that have
passed through this Peninsula
landmark goes on and on. But
the wild success of his name
sake hasn't dulled Chu's pas
sion. Chu, 63, is in the restau-

rant everyday, dreaming up new dishes and shaking the
hands of his guests-prime minister and ordinary Joe
alike.
Once you weave through the crowded front-area
(always make a reservation) and find your seat, the tor
turous task of choosing your dinner begins. With a
menu packed both with exotic sounding delicacies and
traditional Chinese favorites, this can be a real chal
lenge. We decided on the pot stickers and some BBQ
pork buns, and after just a few bites, our entire party was
in agreement that they were the best we had ever tasted.

Choosing main course proved tough too, but we
eventually settled on Grilled Beijing Beef and Cashew
Chicken. The beef, marinated and wok-roasted with
Beijing bean sauce and green onion, was especially deli
cious. For dessert, the delicious fried banana and ice
cream sundae was an exclamation point on a perfect
meal.
In addition to lunch, dinner and brisk take-out busi
ness, Chef Chu's can host larger groups in its private
banquet room. Ii also rents out the entire second floor
for parties with 80 or more people. â–
