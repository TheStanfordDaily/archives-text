back from a summer trip in
Europe, you might wonder if you will ever
find in the Bay Area the same cozy atmos
phere and great food you enjoyed at this
little bistro in the South of France while
sipping on a single espresso and munch
ing on a croissant. But as you enter the
recently face-lifted Town and Country
Village Shopping Center in Palo Alto and
arrive at Douce France, you will stop won
dering and feel you have traveled back in
time.
When you step foot into Douce
France you might first be struck by the
number of customers sitting with their
computers plugged to the wall, you
guessed right, Douce France is among
the very few cafes offering free WiFI, the

only American addition to this fully
European-style cafe.
Walking further into the store will
give any first timers another delightful
surprise: the incredibly large selection of
breakfast, lunch, dessert and coffee
treats Douce France offers. If you feel
overwhelmed by so much choice, just ask
owner Victor or any employee what
would make your taste buds go
"woohoo" and they will gladly describe
the fillings of each sinful delicacy.
Depending on the person serving you,
you might even catch a quick lesson of
Italian, Spanish or French!
On your quest for good food, excel
lent coffee, free WiFI, friendly service and
affordable prices close to campus, Douce
France gets a check mark in every box â–
