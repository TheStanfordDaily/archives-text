## Powers resigns as Dean of Students Boardman plans to search for replacement clean soon 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Maureen Powers publicly announced her
resignation as Dean of Students last month
after serving in the post for just one year.
Powers left Stanford on Sept. 14, but no solid
ified plan is currently in place for finding her
replacement.
"1 am continuing to study the [office's] or
ganization and consider how best we can
serve students," Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman said. "At this point we
have not begun a search. 1 hope to have an
announcement about my plans in the next
week or two."
Powers — who came to Stanford from the
City College of New York last September —
cited personal reasons as the motivation for
her departure, which she called "quite sud
den." According to Boardman. he and Pow
ers first privately discussed her resignation
only a few weeks prior to the announcement.
"I'm leaving because I need to live closer
to where my family is living — back East,"
she said. "I'm going to be looking for [anoth
er position] closer to my family."

While Powers was select
ed as Dean of Students after
a five-month search. Board
man said the University's
course of action following
her resignation is yet to be
determined. Whether an in
terim structure will be creat
ed until a new Dean of Stu
dents is found or whether
the University will find an

immediate replacement is unknown.
"Right now I'm looking at all options,"
Boardman said just after the announcement.
"I'm going to be spending the next couple
weeks — maybe longer — considering the
current organizational structure and the
needs of our students, our staff and the insti
tution."
Boardman said that determining how best
to cope with Powers' departure is a "top pri
ority" in the coming weeks — especially with
its unfortunate timing at the beginning of the
academic year.
This is not the first time in recent history
that the Dean of Students Office has faced a
potential restructuring. Following former
Dean of Students Marc Wais' departure in
2003, the office was led by a series of interim
and short-lived replacements, including
Boardman himself.
"For me, a critical piece of this is [finding]

someone who can bring some stability to the
organization," Boardman said. "There have
been five different structures and five differ
ent deans in the last five years, which doesn't
lend itself to what we really want."
Although Powers' departure marks yet
another upheaval in the office. Boardman
applauded her accomplishments during her
short tenure at Stanford.
"She was not afraid to tackle an issue or
policy that others might avoid, and was will
ing to take action to right a situation," he said.
"Dean Powers brings a breadth and depth of
experience to her work as dean. She excels in
situations of stress and conflict. It came down
to appreciating the importance of her family
commitment and obligations, and I don't
think that can be underestimated."
Powers said she had "no complaints"
about her job and enjoyed the efforts in
which she was involved, such as helping to or
chestrate the opening of Old Union, working
with student government and improving the
operations of the Office of Judicial Affairs.
She lamented, however, that she did not have
the opportunity to finish up the "strategic
planning effort" that aims to analyze the suc
cesses and failures of each department in the
Dean of Students Office.
"I thoroughly enjoyed working with Stan-


Maureen Powers
I
ford students," she said. "They were
interesting and intelligent, very com
mitted and very diverse. 1 learned a
great deal from them while 1 was
here. 1 also appreciated working

with various departments in the
Dean of Students unit. 1 appreciate
Boardman and the Provost ard the
President hiring me. I'm sorry that it
turned out as it did, that I need to re
locate to be nearer to my family at
this time."
