# STUDENT LIFE
## Questions linger about Azia Kim 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Charges have yet to be filed against Azia Kim. an 18-year
old from Orange County who was caught impersonating a
Stanford student in May after living as an impostor on cam
pus for nearly eight months last year.
Kim's deception brought a media circus to Stanford last
May after The Daily reported that she had successfully elud
ed discovery and posed as a Stanford freshman for nearly the
entire year. Kim lived in University dorms, ate meals in the
dining halls, enrolled in Santa Clara University's Army Re
serve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and even attended
classes and took exams, all without being enrolled in the Uni
versity.
According to Kate Chesley, Associate Director of Uni
versity Communications, the scandal and ensuing investiga
tion prompted administrators to form a committee to ad
dress concerns in relation to residential accountability and
communication between residence authorities.
In the meantime, however, there is still the matter of
what, if any. repercussions Kim will face for squatting on
campus for eight months.
"The University's internal investigation was completed
and forwarded to the vice provost of student affairs," Ches
ley said. "It is not a public document and will not be released
in totality or in summary. It will remain an internal document
only."
Despite the high profile nature of the case, the Universi
ty's progress in filing a criminal case against Kim is unclear.
Chesley said the Stanford Police Department concluded its
investigation into the case and forwarded it to the office of
the District Attorney for Santa Clara County, which handles
the University's criminal court cases. However. Javier Acala,
Supervising District Attorney for Palo Alto, said the county
DA's office has yet to receive the case from Stanford Police.
"Our records indicate that nothing has been sent to the
DA so far," said Stanford Police Deputy Chris Cohendet. "I
don't know if there's follow-up on our end that needs to be
completed."
Cohendet said Kim's case is still technically open and that
no charges have been filed so far. He said that several
charges, including fraud and criminal trespassing, could be
filed eventually, but that the timeframe for any such charges
is unclear.
"It all depends on what's currently going on [in the de
partment]." Cohendet said. "Typically, cases are forwarded
to the DA's office in a timely manner."
When the extent of Kim's deception was revealed toward
the end of spring quarter, alumni and parents expressed con
cern about the campus' vulnerability to illegal intrusion.
"Essentially, this was a case of'the perfect storm' combin
ing three elements," Chesley said. "A very bright and re
sourceful young woman who was highly motivated to be at
Stanford: the very trusting, friendly and generous students
she deceived; and some gaps in our processes for accounting
for students in the residences and communicating internal
ly."
According to Chesley, the University has been working
since the incident to address and fix the problems that al
lowed Kim to slip through the cracks.
