The Roundtablc at Stanford University
Global population increases, surging economic growth in new economics and an unabated
appetite for fossil fuels all are driving huge demand and competition for the world's natural
resources. At the same time, climate change is upon us.
Add to that instability across the Middle Hast and the growth of extremism and internation
al terrorism. I he complexities of today's world are confounding and frightening.
Still, groundbreaking research on alternatives to fossil fuels, breakthroughs in energy effi
ciency and progress in addressing threats to ocean and fresh water offer reasons for hope.
Join us for a provocative roundtablc discussion exploring the complex interconnections
among these issues and what we can do as individuals and a nation to address them.
