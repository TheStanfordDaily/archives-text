# What is Day In The Life?

The Band banned. Sweat-free Stanford.
Both of these subjects inspired heated argument across campus
last year, with anti-administration sentiments often running high.
They've run much higher in the past: in April 1971. a powerful bomb
explosion tore a jagged two-foot hole in the office ceiling of then-
University President Richard Lyman.
We discuss current drinking habits on campus. But what do we
have to compare to? Take 1984. when most current seniors were but
a speck in their parents' eyes. According to a survey conducted then,
one out of every two students drank alcohol at least once a week,
with one in ten drinking more often. Would that make for a better
campus? Worse? You decide.
Page Two's "Day in the Life" is a daily feature designed to remind
students of Farms past, whether with information relevant to current
debate, or just interesting curiosos from a different time. We hope
you'll be a reader.
