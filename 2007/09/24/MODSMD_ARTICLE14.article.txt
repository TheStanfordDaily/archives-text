## Editor's Welcome 
### 
My first exposure to The Daily was as
a nine year-old boy. It was July 1995,
the summer after third grade. I had
come to campus with my father — who was
here fulfilling his duties as president of the
Alumni Association — to participate in
Stanford Baseball Camp.
One morning before baseball began, my
dad. who was once himself editor of this ven
erable newspaper, brought me to The Daily
offices to'show me the place he'd loved so
much as a student in the 19605. At the time, I
couldn't have cared less about the place; all
I wanted to do was run around on the
Sunken Diamond and do what I loved most:
play baseball.
Twelve years later, my priorities have
changed. 1 have since shelved my bat and
glove in favor of a keyboard and an insa
tiable thirst for news.
For the past three years. I'm proud to say
that I've spent more time at The Daily than
1 have in class. In that time. I've eaten more
cheap Chinese food and cold pizza than I
care to remember, and I've lost more sleep
than I'll probably ever make up.
But I've also been part of a vibrant com
munity of students dedicated to producing a
professional, informative newspaper for
their friends and classmates. For five nights
a week, we work tirelessly to bring you the
campus word.
My mother — who. like my father, spent
much of her working life in a newsroom
calls journalists "adrenaline junkies." 1
never really understood what she meant
until we broke the Azia Kim story last year,
when a handful of us stayed at The Daily of
fice until 5 a.m. double and triple-checking
facts and quotes to make sure every little de
tail was right. When the story about the 18
year-old impostor blew up and grabbed na
tional headlines the next day. I knew exactly
what my mom was talking about.
Ihe Azia Kim scandal may never have
surfaced were it not for The Daily's intrepid
news staff. And while news is the backbone
of any newspaper. The Daily also prides it

self on offering the area's most comprehen
sive coverage of Stanford Athletics, from
football to field hockey.
Our Opinions page continues to provide
a creative outlet for sarcastic columnists and
a staid forum for serious campus discussion,
while Friday's weekly Intermission pullout
has the campus arts scene covered.
ITiat's not to say we get everything right;
if there is something you think we can im
prove, please let us know. Our doors are al
ways open (if you can navigate your way to
our often-hard-to-find office in the Storke
Publications Building near Roble Hall and
Terman Engineering) and we're always lis
tening.
Or, better yet, if you want to get involved,
we're always looking for eager new writers,
photographers, graphics artists and layout
designers. And there's no experience neces
sary. Whether you edited your high school
paper or simply want to try your hand at
journalism, there's a place for you at The
Daily.
And whether you read every story in the
paper or flip immediately to the crossword
and Sudoku, 1 hope that Ibe Daily will be
come a fixture of your college experience.
Welcome to The Stanford Daily, Volume
232; it's going to be one hell of a ride.
