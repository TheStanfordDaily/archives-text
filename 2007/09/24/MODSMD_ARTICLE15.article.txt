# Holt's Harangue
## Socrates' Dialogues on Home Furnishing 
### 
Plato is by many accounts one of our
most influential thinkers. Millions
have read him and have been influ
enced by the likes of the The Republic.The
Parmenides, and The Symposium. But now
recent studies have unearthed a hidden
masterpiece: Plato's dialogues depicting
Socrates as he moved out of university
housing and into his first veranda. In addi
tion to elucidating his thoughts on man and
free-will. Socrates finally reveals his influ
ential thoughts on home furnishing. ITiis,
the so called, "Ikeaides" is quite a revolu
tionary work.
Plato describes Socrates debating with
his entourage on a Saturday night in an
Athenian salon. After enough rounds of
Dionysius's finest. Socrates lips got loose
and he began to argue about the evils of a
local artisan shop, which to modern readers
translates as "Ikeaides."
To begin the first debate, a young The
bian named Uritestes, whose name got
some obvious chuckles in the Senate, asked
about the nature of the display room. The
Thebian asked Socrates whether the dis
play room of Ikeaides is a real place, purga
tory or possibly just Hades itself. In one of
his most profound analogies. Socrates ar
gued that the displays at Ikeaides were like
siren songs calling sailors to their doom.
Many a fool, he argued, was drawn to the
displays' shiny well-lit surfaces, but they
were doomed to heartbreak and off-center
cabinets. For if the body was a prison house
for the soul. Ikeaides was a prison house for
idle shoppers.
Mere is where Socrates' theory of the
ideal comes into play. He previously argued
that there is an ideal of "justice" but hu
manity could not attain it: we witnessed but
shadows in a cave of this ideal. Here.
Socrates differs from this line of reasoning
and says that while there is an ideal chair
that we as humans can never attain, it does
exist, and it's on display in aisle five.
Aristotle and Plato differed over this
theory, for while Plato believed that we
would never actualize the idealized piece of
furniture, Aristotle argued that Pottery
Barn has much more reasonable prices.
Much of modern thought is derived from
this split in rhetoric.
Plato then describes to the reader
Socrates' journey at the local veranda fur
nishing supplier and the deep questions
that spawned therein. I le wondered if there
was such a thing as a towel and such a thing
as a pony, why there needed to be a towel in
the shape of a pony? Furthermore, what
purpose is there for a toothbrush that is
also a clock? Timeaus argued that it was
"clever" and Pharisees believed it was

"somewhat practical" while Socrates final
ly pointed out that like the shell of a hermit
crab, one discards a toothbrush and conse
quently the clock. Everyone eventually
agreed the object wasn't marketable and
should be dropped from the spring catalog.
Socrates then questioned Ikeaides's use
of the term "system." For there are a system
of planets, he argued, a system to conduct
war. but many were baffled at the idea that
a shelving unit could be a "system."
Himineus argued that it could be an inte
grated plan for decorating a bedroom. He
argued that with this desk/drawer combina
tion. he could maximize his storage space
and finally get something to compliment
his collection of rocks that look vaguely
like Jon Voight. Socrates argued that
I limineus wears a dishtowel for a toga and
throws grapes at traffic. A fool, Himineus
was no match for the rhetorical ability of
Socrates.
In a later dialogue, a question was final
ly asked by the Spartan Jennistes. He asked
if objects were named as people were
named, if they could be considered people
as well. This problem was particularly per
plexing because Jennistes had married a
dinner table named Claire.
But Socrates quickly pointed out the
flaw in Ikeaides's system of naming furni
ture. The object is placed with meaning by
the mind, by the being. But the object does
not then go around voting for Laßouche or
displaying rational thought.
Next. Socrates went to the root of the
"naming question." If an object is named,
he argued, after its creator, who created the
objects from Ikeaides? Are they man. are
they objects themselves, or perhaps they
are demons sent by Zeus himself? Eventu
ally, to refute Jennistes, he found that the
creator of Ikeaides furniture is like the
child whose Popsicle birdhouse collapses
and kills all the occupants. Whoever designs
such furniture, he argues, are not true men,
nor objects, bur rather children who for
some fucking reason believe a piece of
cardboard would be enough to support a
hundred pounds of lumber.
