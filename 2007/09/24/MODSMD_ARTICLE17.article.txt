# Public Editor
## 
### 
Several years ago, in the wake of a scan
dal in which one of its reporters fabri
cated stories,The New York Times cre
ated a public editor position. The goal was
to have an independent, objective critic of
the paper who would represent the read
ers in examining and challenging the
paper's work. Last year. The Daily fol
lowed suit, with former managing editor
Whitney Sado '06, now a law student, tak
ing the role and writing several columns
over the course of the year.
Starting today. 1 am The Daily's new pub
lic editor. My plan is, more or less, to follow
The l imes' model. I intend to write columns,
most likely every few weeks (but more often
if necessary), in which 1 will both discuss
general issues of journalistic practice at The
Daily and offer criticisms of and thoughts on
specific articles.
I am not an insider at The Daily. Other
than one letter to the editor and being quot
ed in one story, I've never written for or been
otherwise involved in the publication.This, 1
believe, is crucial. There is a danger that an
insider, attuned to all of the very real chal
lenges of full-time Stanford students pro
ducing a newspaper, would end up as an
apologist for the paper's mistakes. Further
more, since 1 don't know much about how
The Daily is produced, as 1 learn about its
inner workings in writing my columns, I can
relay this to you, the readers. This increased
transparency will, I hope, both push The
Daily to reexamine those of its practices that
should be reformed and inspire trust where
it is doing things right.
TTiis volume's editor-in-chief. Nick Park
er, told me that he wants me to really be a
critic of the paper.and that's what I intend to
be. The Daily, to be frank, has a very mixed
record. It has had glorious moments in its
history. In the 1970s,The Daily fought a po
lice search of the paper's offices all the way
to the Supreme Court. Though The Daily
lost the case. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, it led
to the 1980 congressional Privacy Protection
Act. which gave papers more freedom from
police searches.
Many times, however. The Daily has

failed to live up to this legacy. Recently, in a
scandal last winter, managing editor Dave
Herbert apparently exaggerated his role in a
news story about himself.The newspaper re
sponded by firing him from his editing posi
tion but failed to acknowledge the bigger
problem: the fact that there were no safe
guards in place to ensure that he recused
himself from editorial supervision of the
story.
The Daily should be a great college news
paper. Stanford is one of the world's leading
universities; what happens here can be im
portant to the rest of the world. The furor
over Donald Rumsfeld's recent appoint
ment at the Hoover Institution, which has
attracted national attention, demonstrates
this importance. Stanford's official news
service, as well as they might report the Uni
versity's affairs, cannot be expected to pro
vide an independent account of what goes
on here.The Daily needs to do just that, and
to serve as a public voice for the students. Al
though I may be critical of The Daily over
the course of my tenure as public editor, my
goal is to help The Daily become such a
great paper.
I hope that you, the readers, will contact
me with your concerns about The Daily and
its coverage. I can be reached by email at
publiceditor@daily.stanford.edu. Please
send me suggestions for what to address in
my column, thoughts about The Daily and
criticisms about how I'm doing my job. The
Daily regularly publishes letters to the edi
tor and op-eds from its readers, and I en
courage you to submit these via the normal
channels (opinions@daily.stanford.edu). I
may. in addition, occasionally publish in this
column thoughts sent to me from readers
(with their permission).
Finally, to both freshmen new to Stanford
as well as returning students. I want to en
courage you to work for The Daily. It's no
small feat for full-time students to produce a
daily newspaper, and The Daily always
needs more talented, dedicated writers.
There will be a few introductory Daily 101 X
sessions this week that will explain how to
get involved (the first will be held on

Wednesday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m.), or you can
email eic@daily.stanford.edu for more infor

Normally, 1 will devote more of my col
umn to specifics of The Daily's coverage, but
today 1 have only one bone to pick. Last Tues
day's Orientation Issue included a "Dining &
Nightlife Guide." Inside were sections about
a dozen nearby eating establishments. Each
eatery had a listing of hours and contact in
formation, enticing pictures, and a several
paragraph blurb describing the restaurant.
An attentive reader would probably have
been able to infer that the restaurants had
paid for and written their own "reviews,"
which had no by-lines. This was, indeed, the
case. But nowhere did The Daily say this.The
result, first, is a "dining guide" that is almost
completely useless to students.
More importantly, though, this makes the
reader doubt the credibility of the rest of
The Daily when it comes to the relationship
between advertising and reporting. Are In
termission staffers writing actual reviews
pressured to give positive reviews of restau
rants that advertise in The Daily? Parker as
sures me that this is not the case. Indeed, the
Intermission orientation section included a
refreshingly irreverent, honest guide to
some campus eateries.
Of course, it is completely legitimate for
The Daily to have an advertising supple
ment featuring restaurants. After all, it costs
a lot of money to print The Daily free of
charge to readers, and the dining guide
brought in needed revenue. But it is impor
tant to generate revenue in a way that makes
clear the distinction between the business
and editorial sides of the paper. In this case,
a simple solution would have been to clearly
print a disclaimer on each page noting that
these restaurants had paid to provide their
information.
