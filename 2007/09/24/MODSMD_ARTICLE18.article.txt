## Undefeated Card keep rolling Stanford improves to 12-0; No. 4 USC up next 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
If the Stanford women's volleyball team
was nervous going into its first conference
match of the season against cross-bay rival
California in Berkeley, it didn't show on the
court Friday night. Freshman outside hitter
Alix Klineman set a new career high with 22
kills and the No. 2 Cardinal fought back after
a game one loss to beat the No. 11 Golden
Bears in four games.
Playing the first Pacific-10 Conference
match of her career. Klineman led the Stan
ford offense, hitting at an outstanding .415
clip. Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo tallied nine of her 15 kills in a third-game
comeback and had a match-high eight blocks.
"Everybody is constantly adjusting and
learning and Alix really wants to improve."
head coach John Dunning said. "She works
hard every day to get better, working on dif
ferent parts of her game. And she is just step
ping up — neither she nor [freshman libero]
Gabi Ailes is playing like a freshman, even in
that setting. I think Cal is now one of the
toughest places to play in the Pac-10, with
their crowd and their band. But they played
aggressively and confidently."
With the win,the Cardinal (12-0) remained
undefeated, one of only six teams in the nation
— and one of three in the Pac-10 — with a
perfect record. Stanford had to fight for this
one. however, as the team fell behind early in
the match.
I"he Golden Bears (10-2) shocked the Car
dinal out of the gate, scoring six of the first
seven points of the match, including two serv
ice aces.
"I think it is one of your goals on the road
to win the race to five." Dunning said. "But
sometimes it doesn't go the way you want. 1
think we had a pretty good idea of how good
Cal was and how important the match was.
'I"he fans are amazing for their team and their
team was really excited."
After a timeout, Stanford answered with a

4-1 run. but could not close the gap entirely.
Despite tying the score twice, the Cardinal did
not lead once in the first game, losing 30-27 on
a service error.
Stanford opened the second game with two
points, but Cal charged into the lead once
again, quickly going up by four. 'ITie Cardinal
battled back to tie at 20,21 and 23 before final
ly regaining the lead at 24-23 on a pair of kills
by Klineman and Akinradewo. Cal stayed
close, but Stanford closed out the game, 30-26,
on another Klineman kill.
Just as it did in the second. Stanford built a
small lead to start the third game before losing
it to the Golden Bears. Cal broke a 13-13
deadlock with a 7-1 run and looked poised to
win the game. Stanford trailed 28-22 but
stepped up its intensity to reel off six straight
points with junior opposite Erin Waller serv
ing. Four different Stanford hitters notched
kills in the run. Waller missed her serve on
game point, but the team held on to win 32-30.
"One of the cool things about volleyball is
that it's not over until it's over," Dunning said.
"When one team gets that far ahead, you may
not know it but you can let up a bit, thinking
that you are going to win. And then you also
need someone to serve six or seven points in a
row, and Erin had seven really good serves.
"We played well around Erin's great serv
ing, and maybe Cal let up for a second. And
when you get two or three points, the pressure
flips to the other team to stop you." he added.
"That was amazing momentum and really car
ried over into the fourth game.That is the kind
of magic that seasons are built on."
Riding the momentum of the third-game
comeback, the Cardinal quickly left Cal be
hind in the fourth game, leading 10-4 after a
Klineman ace. Hie Golden Bears would not
come any closer than four points down the
stretch and Stanford won the game 30-25 on
an Akinradewo kill.
In addition to Klineman's 22 kills and Ak
inradewo's 15. junior outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza tallied 14 and Waller chipped in 11.
Barboza led all players with IS digs with fresh-

her past the l,()()()-dig mark for her career.
"Bryn is another player who came into col
lege very prepared." Dunning said. "She ar

her team to the national championship in her
first year. So that set the tone pretty well. We
have a lot of weapons that she can go to. and
she is very good at what she does. So it is no
