# No. 1 Stanford shocked by Denver
## 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer
team split at the Colorado Tournament
this past weekend, winning a 1-0 match
against Colorado on Friday before los
ing to Denver by the same score yester
day. It was the first loss of the year for the
Cardinal.
Freshman goalkeeper Kira Maker
made her second and third collegiate
starts over the weekend in place of usual
starter Erica Holland. Maker notched
the first shutout of her career against the
Buffaloes but could not hold Denver off
as the Cardinal offense fired blanks Sun
day afternoon.
Stanford (7-1-0) generated plenty of
shots in both games but had trouble
guiding them past the opposing goalies.
The Cardinal had a season-high 18 shots
against Colorado before firing off 14
against Denver, but the team left the
weekend with only one goal to show for
those efforts.
With star sophomore forward Kelley
O'Hara still out nursing a shoulder in
jury, the goalscoring burden has fallen to
Stanford's other players. Two freshman
forwards. Christen Press and Morgan
Redman, are now leading the front line
along with junior Lizzie George. Press
and Redman have combined for four
goals and three assists this season, but

the savior on Friday was junior left back
Marisa Abegg.
Abegg, who had just two goals in two
seasons with the Cardinal and concen
trates primarily on defense, emerged ten
minutes into the second half against Col
orado to fire home a rebound after fel
low junior Allison Falk missed on an ini
tial attempt. Abegg had already hit the
post on an earlier shot before scoring the
game-winner.
However, no unlikely hero emerged
in the second game of the weekend
against Denver. Pioneers' goalkeeper
Mackenzie Snyder kept the Cardinal at
bay all game, making five saves. Maker
was only forced into two saves, one in
each half, but Denver's Jenna Billingsley
beat the Cardinal defense to a pass
across the top of the six-yard box and
knocked one in to make it a 1-0 game in
the 87th minute. Denver held on for the
next few minutes to preserve the victory
and hand the Cardinal its first loss of
2007.
Press had three shots while redshirt
senior Shari Summers and Falk each
contributed two against the Pioneers.
Both of Press and Summers's shots were
on goal, while Falk directed both of her
headers wide of the net.
Sophomore Ali Riley, who had been
away on national team duty at the
Women's World Cup with New Zealand,
returned from China to bolster the Stan-

Junior Allison Falk has been one of the key players for the top ranked Cardinal so far this year. Stanford's
No. 1 ranking may be fleeting, however, as the team fell to Denver this past weekend, 1 -0.
