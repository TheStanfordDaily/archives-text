# Old Union new again
## Celebration week to introduce renovated student center 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of renovations, the new Old
Union is finally open. Tomorrow's noon dedication
ceremony will kick off a week of celebrations to high
light the newly renovated student union's facilities.
Tomorrow's ceremony will be led by Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 and will feature performances
from a variety of student groups. It will be followed by
a variety of events in the coming week, including the
re-openings of F.l Centro Chicano, the Student Activi
ties Fair and a 10 p.m. Friday performance by a Gram
my award-winning artist whose name officials refuse
to disclose.
Director of Student Unions Jeanette Smith-Laws
hopes that the variety of events will cement Old
Union's place as a center for student expression.
"I think that everyone will find niches here," Smith-
Laws said. "When you come in you'll find that any
thing is possible. You might find a jazz series going on
or watch the screening of a film."
The three buildings of Old Union, which were orig
inally built in the 19205, are also welcoming back some

old inhabitants. El Centro Chicano will return to its
home in the Nitery, one of the buildings in the com
plex. which will also house a black-box theater for stu
dent productions. The Asian-American and Native
American community centers have also returned to
the Clubhouse, another renovated Old Union build
ing. Meanwhile the central building will accommodate
the ASSU and the Offices of Religious Life and Stu
dent Activities.
In addition to the groups returning to their previ
ously held spaces, there are a number of noticeable
newcomers to the buildings, including a new cafe de
signed to replace the CoHo, which recently closed
down.
Smith-Laws said Old Union's facilities were de
signed with flexibility in mind.
"All the furniture moves," she said. "You can create
any kind of set-up depending on the need."
According to Smith-Laws, the philosophy underly
ing the new complex is that students will be able to
take the lead in determining how it is used. Whereas
Tresidder Union is primarily a retail and administra-
live space. Old Union is designed as
a hub of student activity.
"We have a programming
committee, but the intent is for
Old Union to provide open flex
space for all kinds of student
ideas," she said. "We want to be
come a hub where anything is
possible.
1 have been extending invita
tions to students to come seek me
out and bring me ideas and my cal
endar has been filling up with all
kinds of groups."
Smith-laws said I l iCKs and
several performance groups have
alrcad) come to her with ideas for
programs. She is also keen on host
ing the products of various class
projects.
"Students create these wonder

ful things and then they just sit in
their rooms," she said.
()ld Union may also be a source
of income for student groups. Dur
ing the summer, when students
groups are often dormant, the reno
vated space will be rented out to
conferences in order to generate
revenue that can flow back into stu
dent activities.
Because the building is stu
dent-oriented, Smith-I.aws said
Old Union will continue to change
with the needs of the groups it
serves.
" The Union will evolve," she
said. "It's hard to say what it will
look like a year from now."
