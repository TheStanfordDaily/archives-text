## Celebration week to introduce renovated student center 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of renovations, the new Old
Union is finally open. Tomorrow's noon dedication
ceremony will kick off a week of celebrations to high
light the newly renovated student union's facilities.
Tomorrow's ceremony will be led by Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 and will feature performances
from a variety of student groups. It will be followed by
a variety of events in the coming week, including the
re-openings of F.l Centro Chicano, the Student Activi

the Clubhouse, another renovated Old Union build

the ASSU and the Offices of Religious Life and Stu

In addition to the groups returning to their previ

newcomers to the buildings, including a new cafe de

Smith-Laws said Old Union's facilities were de

"All the furniture moves," she said. "You can create
any kind of set-up depending on the need."
According to Smith-Laws, the philosophy underly

take the lead in determining how it is used. Whereas
