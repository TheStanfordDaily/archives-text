## New engineering major offered 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
In yet another example of the
growing recognition of environmen
tally friendly energy solutions, the
School ol Engineering announced
the creation of an interdisciplinary
major in atmosphere and energy last
week. Ihe program — one of the
first of its kind in the country — will
link the study of atmospheric phe
nomena and energy solutions.
" Ihe major will create students
who will have the skills to do things
that .ire in high demand," Civil and
Environmental Engineering Prof.
Mark .lacobson said in a statement
last week. "[These students will]
come up with creative solutions to
global warming and pollution while
<ilso addressing energy needs."
Ihe new undergraduate program
follows in the footsteps of the suc
cessful Atmosphere/Energy Pro
gram for graduate students, which
grew from 37 applicants three years
ago to 70 this year.
Ihe new major represents one
more facet of the dramatic increase
in climate and energy research at
Stanford in the past few years. East
year, oil tycoon .lay A. Precourt '59
donated $30 million to found the
Precourt Institute for Energy Effi
ciency and Ward W. Woods' 64 donat
ed another $30 million to the Stan
ford Institute for the Environment,
which was renamed in honor of
Woods and his wife Priscilla.
In addition, the Jerry Yang and
Akiko Yamazaki Environment and
Energy Building, which is named
after alums Jerry Yang '90 and his
wife Akiko Yamazaki '90 and is de
signed to facilitate interaction be
tween multiple departments with in
terests in sustainable energy studies,
is scheduled for completion later this
year.
