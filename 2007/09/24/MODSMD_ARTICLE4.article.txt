## Freshmen get second advisor in program change 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
New Student Orientation (NSO) is much
the same every year, but this year's freshmen
had a little extra help when it came to advice
about scheduling and picking classes. Whereas
freshmen of old met with a single academic
advisor during NSO. members of the Class of
2011 have a second advisor from the Office of
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR).
Beginning this year, UAR advisors have
been chartered to provide assistance to stu
dents at every stage of their careers, according
to the UAR Web site. Such advisors can pro
vide valuable information about curricula, re
search opportunities, fellowships and scholar
ships, professional school requirements and
preparations for graduate school.
As the academic interests of freshmen
change in the months leading up to
their arrival on campus and during
their first quarter at the University,
preassigned academic advisors are
often insufficient in and of them
selves.
"I think the reason for the second
academic advisor is that some stu
dents would get a faculty advisor in a
department that they were not inter
ested in, and so that advisor would
not he very useful to them." said
Jesse Weinstcin-Gould '09, a peer
mentor who works with advisors to
provide academic counseling and
support to freshmen and sopho
mores.
"Iliis second advisor acts as sort
of a safely net so that there is at least
someone who has some knowledge
about a broad range of departments
and knows all the requirements."
Unlike academic advisors, how
ever. the new I JAR advisors do not
work directly with peer mentor
groups, according to Pin-yi Ko '09,
another peer mentor.
"1 don't really interact with the
second advisor," she said.
"We did not have to arrange
meetings with the second advisor or
even really have to make contact
with thcm."Weinstein-( lould added.
Former peer mentors said fresh
men are often concerned with the
lack of organized advising meetings,
and they questioned the extent to
which an additional advisor could
solve this problem.citing instead the
need for a residential advisor.
"Regardless of how many there
are, I think random advisors aren't
really that helpful." said llieresa
/.hen '09. "(Rut| if I had an official
advisor and a more low-key residen
tial advisor, maybe I would've
sought more help."
"Our advisor talked about both
academics and extracurrieulars,"
said Nabill Idrisi '09. "But I also
think we had a really good one. 1 like
the UAR's idea of addressing the
problem of mismatched academic
interests and faculty advisors."
IJAR advisors have offices in
both Sweet Hall and in freshman
residences. Athletes can also seek
advice from the academic director
