### MICHAEL DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Apple executive Scott Forstall '91, M.S.
'92 urged the Class of 2009 to adopt
"growth mindsets" and seek new chal
lenges in his keynote address during Ju
nior Convocation yesterday afternoon.
"More is in you than you know." said
Forstall, who is currently the head of de
velopment for iPhone software at Apple.
He called on the Class of 2009 to abandon
"fixed mindsets" when choosing a major,
advising students not to preoccupy them
selves with appearing intelligent at the ex
pense of valuable opportunities.
Major selection remains an issue for
students entering their junior year. Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman '79 said in his introductory
address.
"There are 450 names in 'the book of
the dead,'" Bravman said,holding up a red
leather bound book filled with the names
of juniors who have not yet declared a
major.
In his speech, Forstall reassured stu

dents that knowledge gained in the class
room will be applicable to life after gradu
ation. While at Stanford, he said that he
often thought his classes, while challenging
and interesting, would be of no use in the
workplace.
"1 was proved very wrong." Forstall
said of his experience with Apple.
Forstall graduated from Stanford with
an undergraduate degree in Symbolic Sys
tems in 1991 and earned an M.S. in Com
puter Science the following year. Before
leading the i Phone project, Forstall devel
oped famous user interfaces such as Mac
intosh OS X, which remains the standard
operating system for Apple computers.
When asked why Apple decided to de
velop its own cell phone, Forstall said that
there were two truths about cell phones.
"First, everybody has one," he said.
"Second, everybody hates the one they
have."
Forstall shared his "more is in you" phi

culean things." he said.

of passage for students [entering|
their junior years." said Junior ('lass
President Jordan Goldberg'o9.
While many juniors use fall quar
ter to study abroad, the class presi
dents felt it was necessary to remind
those still on campus that they are
not alone.

class together," Lu said,"just sit that
they know that there's still a majori
ty of people on campus."
