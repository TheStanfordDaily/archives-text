# QUACK ATTACK: CARD FALLS 55-31
## Stanford's 28 second-quarter points not enough 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Superior speed is as absolute as grav
ity in today's college football.The slow
er team can soar for awhile, but they al
ways crash back down to Earth.
Sure enough, Stanford (1-2,0-2 Pac
-10) was resplendent against No. 13 Ore
gon (4-0,1-0 Pac-10) for a quarter Sat
urday night, building a 31-24 halftime
lead (after trailing 21-3 early) on the
strength of four unanswered touch
downs and three Duck turnovers.
But the slower Cardinal hit the
ground with a thud. Oregon scored 34
unanswered points to end the game in a
55-31 victory that showed how far Stan
ford Football has come â€” and how far
it has to go.
"We got hit in the mouth in the first
quarter, and we came back, came back
swinging." senior tailback Anthony
Kimble said. "When they came out
punching in the second half, we didn't
come back."
Duck quarterback Dennis Dixon put
up 382 yards and five scores, and tail
back Jonathan Stewart ran for 160 yards
and a touchdown on an evening when
the only team stopping Oregon was
Oregon.The Ducks racked up 589 total
yards, averaging nearly 10 yards per
pass and five per run Saturday night at
Stanford Stadium.

punt, Oregon drove 86 yards in 11 plays
for the go-ahead score, a Jeremiah
Johnson 12-yard dash up the middle on
fourth-and-two.
