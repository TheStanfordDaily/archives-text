# QUACK ATTACK: CARD FALLS 55-31
## Stanford's 28 second-quarter points not enough 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Superior speed is as absolute as grav
ity in today's college football.The slow
er team can soar for awhile, but they al
ways crash back down to Earth.
Sure enough, Stanford (1-2,0-2 Pac
-10) was resplendent against No. 13 Ore
gon (4-0,1-0 Pac-10) for a quarter Sat
urday night, building a 31-24 halftime
lead (after trailing 21-3 early) on the
strength of four unanswered touch
downs and three Duck turnovers.
But the slower Cardinal hit the
ground with a thud. Oregon scored 34
unanswered points to end the game in a
55-31 victory that showed how far Stan
ford Football has come — and how far
it has to go.
"We got hit in the mouth in the first
quarter, and we came back, came back
swinging." senior tailback Anthony
Kimble said. "When they came out
punching in the second half, we didn't
come back."
Duck quarterback Dennis Dixon put
up 382 yards and five scores, and tail
back Jonathan Stewart ran for 160 yards
and a touchdown on an evening when
the only team stopping Oregon was
Oregon.The Ducks racked up 589 total
yards, averaging nearly 10 yards per
pass and five per run Saturday night at
Stanford Stadium.

Oregon tight end Ed Dickson reeled
in a high and fast 31-yard Dixon strike
to tie the contest at 31 four minutes into
the third quarter. After a quick Stanford
punt, Oregon drove 86 yards in 11 plays
for the go-ahead score, a Jeremiah
Johnson 12-yard dash up the middle on
fourth-and-two.

yard Matt Kvensen field goal in the early
fourth and a 50-yard Dixon pass to Jaison
Williams with five minutes left provided the
final margin.
"Not to take anything away from Ore
gon, hut most of the stuff they got, we gave it
to them with mental mistakes — blown cov
erages or not staying in our g;ip." sophomore
safety Bo McNally said. "That was pretty
consistent throughout the game for us. We
didn't come with the right mindset on de
fense."
Three Duck fumbles in the early second
quarter opened the door for the Cardinal.
And unlike in past seasons, where Stanford
would have checked out after falling behind
14-0 three minutes in and 21-3 after a quar
ter, the Cardinal capitalized.
"For us, one of the problems the last few
years here has been that we haven't reacted
to adversity well." senior quarterback T.C.
Ostrander said. "The fact that we came back
and took a lead is a testament to the new at
titude of the team."
One minute into the second quarter,
Dixon's fourth-and-one pitch was behind
Stewart. ;ind junior end Pannel Egboh
pounced on it for the Cardinal. ITie next

play, Oregon's defensive line crashed tot)
hard to its left on a draw, and Kimble cut
back up the middle and sprinted 60 yards
untouched to cut the deficit to 21-10.
One minute later, Oregon's Andiel Brown
dropped a Jay Ottevegio punt and Stanford
sophomore linebacker Clinton Snyder fell on
it at the Duck 34. Stanford took advantage, as
a three-yard Kimble touchdown run tight
ened the score to 21 -17.
F\vo plays later, sophomore defensive
lineman Levirt (iriffin stripped Oregon's
Jaison Williams and recovered at the Stan
ford 38. Ostrander (25-of-44, 262 yards, two
touchdowns, one interception) capped the
ensuing drive with to go in the half on
Stanford's most beautiful play-call of the
season. Kimble ran a play-action left, which
Oregon bought, as the Card had been run
ning well off-left tackle. Ostrander boot
legged right, and Oregon's defense forgot
about sophomore tight end Ben Ladner on
the left sideline, to the tune of a 31 -yard go
ahead touchdown.
Iben.with under a minute left in the half.
Ostrander found senior receiver Mark
Bradford on a 12-yard out route in the right
corner of the north end zone, where the

game's first 10 touchdowns were scored.
Oregon made a 26-yard field goal with five
seconds to go in the half, hut Stanford led 31-
24 at the break after a dominating 28-3 sec
ond quarter.
"I don't think I've ever been a part of any
more exciting of a second quarter in my en
tire life," Coach Jim 1 larbaugh said.
But the Ducks took the other three
quarters convincingly. The first snap of the
game, Dixon playfaked a dive to Stewart,
and then lofted a pass to uncovered receiv
er Cameron Colvin (136 yards), who went
71 yards untouched for a score. After a
quick Stanford punt. Stewart scored from
10 yards out to push Oregon ahead 14-0
less than four minutes in.
"I'm sure people in the stands were
thinking when they run that first play from
scrimmage for touchdown, 'Oh. another
year, whatever. " sophomore tight end Ben
1 .adner said."But we weren't thinking that."
Stanford responded with a 39-yard
Derek Belch field goal the next drive. The
teams then traded punts, and Oregon's
Brown broke a return down the left sideline
to the Cardinal 5. That set up a four-yard
Dixon touchdown run for a 21-3 Oregon

lead with 2:40 left in the fist.
For Stanford,hanging with a top team be
fore fading is nothing new. The Cardinal
jumped to a 28-17 halftime lead over top
ranked, defending national champion USC
in 2004, also in many students' first game on
campus. But Stanford's offense could not
move in the second half, USC won 31 -28 and
Buddy Teevens was fired at the 4-7 season's
end.
Under Walt Harris in 2005, the Cardinal
led UCLA 24-3 with eight minutes left, hut
UCLA scored the game's final four touch
downs in a 30-27 overtime victory. Stanford
finished 5-6 that year. 1-11 the next.and Har
ris too was canned.
After yielding 100 points and 1,213 yards
to UCLA and Oregon. Stanford's search for
a Pac-10 offense it can slow gets no easier, as
explosive No. 23 Arizona State (4-0) visits
this Saturday at 7 pm.
Stanford's young defense needs to
come around quickly. Nine Pac-10 teams
scored 27 points this weekend, and every
winning team scored at least 44.
