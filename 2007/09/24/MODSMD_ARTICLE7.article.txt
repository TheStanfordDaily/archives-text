## ResEd acts to prevent another Azia Confidential new policies, training for dorm staff 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the Azia Kim story broke
last spring, student reaction was very
mixed. Comments on The Daily's
Web site ranged from cries to press
charges against the 18 year-old im
postor from Orange County to calls
for the University to admit such a
