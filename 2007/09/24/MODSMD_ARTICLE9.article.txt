September 24,1973
Santa Clara County sheriffs detectives and officers
of the Stanford Department of Public Safety remain
baffled by the brutal murder of a physics student here
nearly two weeks ago.
Early on the morning of Sept. 11, a jogger found the
body of David Sidney Levine, a senior in physics from
Ithaca, N.Y., on a walkway just east of the Meyer Li
brary. Levine's assailant had stabbed him 15 times in
the back and side.
Contacted on Friday, Santa Clara County Undersh
erift Tom Rosa said," We haven't had any breaks at this
pointing the case." He added that eight to 10 investiga
tors from his office were still trying to solve the mur
der.
Rosa said that his office and Stanford Public Safety
Department have both supplemented their on-campus
patrols at night.
Caution Urged
Stanford Public Safety Sapt. Frank Benederet
urged students and the general public to be sensibly

cautious when on campus at night.'il a motive isn't es
tabished for the murder of David S. Levine, then
there's a possibility that a maniac is on the loose."
Detectives said that there was no sign of a struggle
near the spot where Levine's body was found, indicat
ing his assailant took him completely by surprise. Po
lice found Levine's empty wallet in his pants pocket
and virtually ruled out robbery as a possible motive for
the murder.
On the day of the murder. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons announced that the University is offering
a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of Levine's murderer.
Information Sought
Witnesses saw Levine leaaving the physics depart
ment at approximately 1 a.m. the day he was killed. In
vestigators believe he was slain while returning to his
home in the Mirrielees Apartments in Escondido Vil
lage.
The murder was the second on the main campus in
the past decade. In 1969, Dr. Leslie Kuhanek was shot
to death at the Medical Center by a gunman.
Levine was the son of Cornell University Agricultur
al Engineering Prof. Gilbert Levine. At the request of his
family, the University established a David Levine
Memorial Fund to help students studying in physics.
