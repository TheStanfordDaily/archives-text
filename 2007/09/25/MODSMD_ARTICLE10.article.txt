## Opinions Editors' Introduction Daily columnists: your face, in grayscale 
### 
Anyone can be a columnist. Really.
Anyone. You don't need to know
someone at ITie Daily. You don't
need to have written for your high school
newspaper. You don't need to be a commu
nication or English major. Churn out a 6(X)-
800 word opinion essay on the war in Iraq.
Ugg Boots or Dormcest. Bam! A column is
born, and you are now a columnist.
The Daily is looking for outstanding
columnists. We want a diverse set of writers
who will enthrall the jaded Row RA as he
eats his morning bagel. Writers who will
make President Hennessy pen a Letter to
the Editor in response to a column. Writers
who will inspire jealousy in online readers
who are stuck at some cold, gray school
where they have to read columns written by
cold, gray people in their own school's
paper.
We are looking for passionate communi
cators who have something to write about
and are not afraid to do it. Were you that per
son in your 111UM section? Do you love get
ting into debates at the dining hall table?
Have you done Mock Trial or Model United
Nations? Had a radio show or posted videos
to You Tube? Writing a column is just anoth
er way to perform. It is your opportunity to
connect with an audience on a weekly basis.
And not just a Stanford audience — a glob
al audience. An old columnist's most loyal
reader was a philosopher in Berlin (and her
mother, of course).
Having a column is an outstanding way

for someone to fill what he perceives as a
void in content at The Daily. Do you think
that student activism gets unfair coverage?
Ethnic groups are marginalized? Grad stu
dent interests are ignored? This is your op
portunity to lend your voice to The Daily.
It is a job that carries a lot of visibility
and responsibility with it. Consider this: In
yesterday's paper, the Editor in Chief,
Nick Parker, had his signature at the end of
his reader welcome; columnists have their
picture printed alongside their articles
every week. If Rummy comes to campus,
he'll know what you look like, and we bet
he will not have liked your column about
him very much at all. Fortunately, to even
it out, that cutie in O-Chem might recog
nize you. too.
Reliability is important, as well, though
less glamorous to write about. A columnist
needs to love tracking down a story and dis
covering the facts before they judge. And
then there's the weekly deadline — you
need to be able to commit to turning in your
pieces on time, every week.
Anyone can be a columnist. We want
you. Outstanding, unique, passionate, gutsy,
responsible, reliable YOU. Applications are
due this Friday, Sept. 28, at 5 p.m. Show us
what you've got, and don't be shy.

In Ho Lee and Jackie Bernstein can be
reached at inholee@stanford.edu and
jaher@stanford.edu. Applications should he
submitted to opinions@daily.stanford.edu.
