"No to Rumsfeld" Response
Something is wrong with our elite univer
sities when the visit of the most influential
actor in international terrorism in the world
today (President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
of Iran) to Columbia receives less of a
protest than the appointment of one of the
most decorated public servants of this gen
eration (former Secretary of Defense Don
ald Rumsfeld) to the Hoover Institution.
While stressing the virtue of "disinterest
ed enquiry." the "No To Rumsfeld" petition
leaves out Mr. Rumsfeld's unparalleled
record of service to his country in favor of
baseless, ad hominem attacks. Born into
modest means, Mr. Rumsfeld earned an
ROTC scholarship to Princeton, where he
graduated with honors; served in the Navy
was elected to the House of Representatives
at 29, where he served four terms; has been a
high-level advisor to every Republican pres
ident since Dwight Eisenhower; was the U.S.
Ambassador to NATO; has been both the
youngest and oldest Secretary of Defense;
and has held distinguished fellowships at nu
merous universities and think tanks.
Any fair-minded person, regardless of his
opinions of Mr. Rumsfeld's policy decisions,
cannot deny that this man's life has been
dedicated to patriotic service. More than al
most any person alive, he has had a front
row seat to high-level policymaking in the
post-war period.
Any person who knows Rumsfeld, re
gardless of his political opinions, would reject
the implication of the petition that the man's
motivations are in any way evil. Unlike the
vast majority of professors who signed the
petition. Rumsfeld's ideas and policies were
taken out of the ivory tower and applied to
the unpredictable, chaotic and brutal world
during one of the most consequential periods
in American history. Implications that Mr.
Rumsfeld's motivations for his policies were
different from the goal of achieving greater
security for our country and world simply
contradict the entire history of his life. While
heated debate and disagreement over his de
cisions should, of course, be welcomed, out
right vilification of Mr. Rumsfeld's motives
betrays the academic spirit that the petition
— and Stanford — espouses. Rumsfeld's

presence gives the Stanford community a
fantastic opportunity to engage in intellectu
al discussion about the history that has un
folded before our eyes — the joke will be on
us if we lose this opportunity due to juvenile,
unjustified vilification.

1 know why Stanford football lost to Ore
gon. It wasn't poor defense, it wasn't Ore
gon's faster play and it wasn't our slowing
second half offense. No, it was you. You.
Stanford students, failed your football team
this weekend when it needed you the most. 1
come from Michigan. I know a thing or two
about big football games, about supporting
your team and about upsetting visitors. I was
simply appalled by the participation from
Stanford students this weekend.
Let me tell you how you failed your team.
First, noise. You do not intimidate opposing
teams by beginning to scream with 10 sec
onds left on the play clock. You start in the
huddle. The whole idea is to shake the of
fense. fire up our defense and make calling
an audible a nervous moment for the oppos
ing 08. Second, the wave. Where I come
from, you do not start a wave when your
team is down or anytime in the first half. It
distracts fans from their number one job —
making noise.
For a student body that seems to have so
much school spirit with dorm chants, side
walk chalking and spirit committees, you are
pathetic in the football stadium, where it
matters the most. Stanford has no home field
advantage because of your apathy; you hide
behind your band, acting like you care about
the game.
Before you send harsh words my way.
please prove me wrong this weekend when
nationally ranked Arizona State comes to
town. Your football team will appreciate it,
and we can all hold our heads high. Go Car
