# In Pursuit of the Epic
## This column has everything 
### 
So when I took this two week gig as a
guest columnist, I got to thinkinY'What
does it mean. Alex Coley, to be a colum
nist for The Daily?" Well, after a few solid
minutes of contemplating this and that, run
ning various abstract ideas and notions
through my understandably thick skull, the
very first and only answer that appealed to
my simple mind was this: to be a Daily
columnist is to be a glory-seeking egomaniac
whose every word is drenched in cliche, easy
enough on the throat to be downed like
Mike's Hard, a veritable "Opiate of the
Masses." as certain distinguished philoso
pher-revolutionaries.
And that's just what I think I'll do. Except,
this time, it won't just be one dose of cliche, it
will be an overdose! I owe it to the freshman
class of Oh-Leven to expose them, right off
the proverbial "bat." to the impressive scope
of issues (of both the local and global vari
eties) which The Daily's staff is traditionally
capable of probing in each volume with ut
most subtlety of analysis and keenness of
eye. But here I'll do the economical thing and
squeeze all that juicy Daily cliche into one
slimmed down, easy to swallow package.
You see.certain critics (not excluding irri
table alumni and parents) like to "rake
muck" by pronouncing that we columnists
regurgitate the same old columns year after
grindingly dull year, producing and repro
ducing ad nauseam/infinitum such triteness
as "What 1 Did This Summer (Besides Eat,
Sleep, and Work)" or "Fill Lake Lag" or
maybe "Stanford Cops and the OSA and All
Important Administrative Figures Can
Maybe if I stuff it all into
one column, get it out of the way, 1 say to my
self. these loud-mouthed strumpets will quit
their slandering.

So, first off, I want to declare that What 1
Did This Summer was this: 1 delightfully frit
tered away my summer on the simultaneous
ly flammable and inflammable pastures of
the Farm, hitting golf balls in all manner of
direction, velocity, and spin and conducting
research. Unfortunately, nothing eventful
whatsoever occurred, and. thus, spinning an
edgy and hip column out of such a dull 10
weeks would be a formidable challenge — a
challenge that a Daily columnist, of course,
could meet.
And then there's always FMOTQ. which
is approaching with the speed of. well, a lunar
cycle. 1 know freshmen haven't yet had the
acronym hardwired into their p - br
after nearly 10 days of Stanford piogr;-
ming, you know, when you add up Admit
Weekend and NSO, carry the one and all
that, so to clarify: F(ull) M(oon) O(n) T(he)
Q(uad), only the most over-hyped and wa
tered down Stanford tradition of all time!
Normally, I'd say we ought to have at least
two or three columns devoted to teaching
freshmen how to pronounce the thing. That
way we could all learn to be adept at com
plaining about how disappointing it will in
variably be!
1 could say something about Big Game,
but ever since we started to suck, no one
talks pigskin anymore. So instead, what
about some roommate drama,or an exegesis

on the latest bonehead move by geek of the
century, Mark Zuckerberg? And of course
we'll need another go at categorizing the
(pick a number) types of campus bikers, in
cluding a witty dig at grad students in hel
mets. Or a shocking and in-depth exposition
on the everyday life of the Daily Columnist
(oh so exotic!) in a journalistic move unri
valed in narcissism. What about some expla
nation to that classic metaphysical
quandary: the nonexistence of the Stanford
Dating Scene?
Sadly, it's been nearly 800 words, and
we're barely past midterms of fall quarter
(OK. 1 took some liberties at the beginning).
But maybe that's a good thing. The freshmen
could use a fresh slate of "rehashed"
columns, and maybe so could I. Many of us
will faithfully read the Opinions section no
matter how repetitive it is said to be. which is,
in truth, not nearly as repetitive as some crit
ics make it out to be. I'll read that New York
Times publication when I want politics. The
homey columns that form the backbone of
•ration are hewn of an an
. m ested stone, so try to show
s< me ■ pcct why don't you?
Bui uicre s no need to despair, cynics.
Last year we got Azia Kim. This year, who
knows what scandal Donald Rumsfeld will
bring? Something legendary always goes
down, as they say, and then we can all cherish
it for years, long years, until we're old enough
to browse The Daily at work from faraway
offices in downtown Palo Alto or Mountain
View and, between sips of coffee, debate
whether to scold these students so exultant in
their immaturity, or to laugh.

Alex Coley swears there's no point here. If you
beg to differ, email him at coley@stanford.edu.
