## Four players score hat tricks in water polo win 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Alter scoring only 14 goals in its
previous two games, the No. 4 Stan
ford men's water polo team erupted
for 20 scores in its 20-11 victory over
No. 15 Pacific last weekend. Four
Cardinal players recorded hat tricks,
led by sophomore utility Drac Wigo,
who had five goals.
"Offensively, everyone came to
gether." Wigo said. "We played real
ly well as a team. We're still working
through all the little kinks. We have a
freshman that starts, so we're work
ing that out. I was pretty pleased
with how we did this weekend,
though."
Wigo got some help from his twin
brother Janson, a sophomore utility
who netted three goals of his own.
Junior utility Will Hindle-Katel and
freshman driver Sage Wright also
carded hat tricks. Freshman utility
Jeffrey Schwimer, redshirt sopho
more two-meter offense Ryan Mc-
Carthy and redshirt freshman driver
Will Smith all contributed to the
cause with third-period goals to seal
the victory.
Senior goalkeeper Sandy Hohen
er tallied 15 saves in three periods of
play.
"1 felt like everybody played
well," Janson Wigo said. "We lost two
important games the weekend be
fore this. We trained really hard that
week, and we all felt pretty confident
going into [the Pacific game].
"Every one of us is a good shoot
er. We all stepped up and we all did

the job that we were supposed to
do."
Led by its powerful offense, the
Cardinal sprinted out to an 11 -5 lead
and never looked back. Every player
got into the pool. and. while Pacific
put up 11 goals, the final outcome
was never in doubt.
With the win. the Cardinal im
proved to 4-2 after suffering two
tough losses to top-ranked USC and
No. 3 UCLA List week.
"We've been working a lot these
last couple of weeks" Drac Wigo
said. "We had a rough tournament
against USC and UCLA. We felt
that we deserved [the win against
Pacific]. We were really in the game:
everyone was competitive, and we
just came together."
Head coach John Vargas made
goalscoring the focus of last week's
practices, and it showed in the team's
offensive explosion against the
Tigers.
"I think the main thing was our
offense," Janson Wigo said. "The
whole week before [the game] we
were training on offense, doing a lot
of driving drills. We put it in our head
that offense is our main thing, and
we got it done."
Despite the two early-season
losses, Stanford is looking forward to
a strong year, as the team lost only
two starters from last year's squad.
The Card has high hopes, and many
of its members believe they are ca
pable of bringing home a national
championship.
"1 have really good feelings about
this season." Drac Wigo said."We still
