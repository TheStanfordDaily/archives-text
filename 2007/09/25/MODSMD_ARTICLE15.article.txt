could beat the team below them.

Rank Last Week Comment
1 1 Only Pac-10 team to hold foe under 27 last weekend.
Book Sugar Bowl flights.
2. 2 That South Carolina team — and that fake field goal
— underrated.
3. no State 4 Looks like Michigan/Ohio State for the Big Ten title.
Somethings never change.
4. 01 lahoma 3 With Texas, Texas A&M and Nebraska all looking ugly,
door is wide open.
5. I est Virginia 5 Goodbye Louisville. Like Sooners, Mountaineers take
their league by default.
6. 8 Last week's Ole Miss hiccup like the South Carolina
near-upset of last year?
7. F.i fornin 10 Last of the legit teams. Should run for 250 and a Won
suspect Oregon D...
8. ;xas 6 On-field results shaky. But You Tube the Horns dancing
to "Crank Dat." Hot.
9. Oregon 7 ...But Ducks are at home. Likely at-large Rose Bowl
berth at stake in Eugene.
10. /irginia 'sch 12 VT 44, William & Mary 3. No team's better at blowing
out weaklings.
11. Michigan 17 New faces on D the difference vs. PSU. Next four weeks
are laughers.
12. Penn State 9 Paterno: world's only coach less creative than Lloyd
Carr. Worst OB of Top 25.
13. South Carolina 11 Mercury News' Wilner has them 4th. That's too high,
but 2nd best in SEC East.
14. Georgia 16 Gusty end zone fade on first offensive snap of overtime
pays off vs. Bama.
15. Wisconsin 13 Don't let the gaudy record distract you. Nation's most
overrated team at No. 9.
16. Miami 23 Nation's most underrated team after A&M rout. Soon
ers hang 50 on everyone.
17. emson NR Tigers and Boston College always collapse mid-season,
but have to rank now.
18. LA 21 Last week forgiven (hey, no Pac-10 team plays D) after
beating Huskies.
19. Boston Co iege NR Three top-50 wins? Again, guess I hove to believe.
Should start 7-0.
20. iabama 14 What, Soban isn't God after all? Now zero margin for
error in SEC West race.
21. South Florida 24 Shown more than Rutgers. Notion's next big program,
given the Florida talent.
22. Arizona State NR Should start 7-0 with a sick OL. Tennessee, Missouri
just left out of final slots.
23. Rutgers 19 South Florida and West Virginia of home, but overrat
ed at 10 due to last year.
24. Nebraska 18 Ball State alum David letterman would've teased for
weeks but for late FG miss.
25. Hawaii 25 Finale vs. Washington for BCS berth? Fresno State,
Boise State both lackluster.
