# Chun leads Card at NCAA Preview
## Stanford in 13th after day one, but only five strokes out of sixth with two more days to play 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
After taking 12th place at the Mason
Rudolph Championship in its first tourna
ment of 2007. the Stanford women's golf
team sits in a similar position at one of the
year's toughest tournaments, the NCAA Pre
view in Albuquerque. New Mexico.
The team is in 13th place after the opening
round of play. Despite its place in the stand
ings. the Cardinal is only five strokes behind
the top six teams.
In the first round, Stanford saw particular
ly strong performances from junior Mari
Chun and sophomore Catherina Wang. Chun
recorded a four-under-par 69. putting her in
fourth place individually.
"She didn't do exceptionally well

[today]," head coach Catherine O'Connor
said of her top golfer. "She did a great job
managing her game and making the most of
what she had. Mari is one of the best players
in the country. She is going to be there for us.
and I rely on her day in and day out."
Wang added to the Cardinal's effort with
an impressive score of her own. tallying a
two-under-71 in Monday's round.
"Catherina came in as a very highly tout
ed recruit and proved quite a bit last year,"
O'Connor said. "She's come back this year
and has really played very well and solidly for
us so far."
It is no wonder that the Cardinal finds it
self in the middle of the pack after the first
day of action — the NCAA Preview features
1S of the nation's top teams, and, according to
O'Connor, is probably the strongest field

Sept. 24 - Sept. 26
GAME NOTES. Currently in 13th place after the first
round, the Cardinal will look to make up the six-stroke
deficit separating Stanford from the leaders. Junior
Mari Chun recorded the fourth-best single round score
with a four-under-par 69 in the first round. Teammate
Catherina Wang scored a Iwo-under 71 and is tied for
ninth individually.

Stanford will face all year.
"It's one of the best fields we'll see in the
country" O'Connor said. "These are definite
ly the best teams in the country from the east,
central and west regions. We'll see the teams
that we'll see at the national championship.
For all intents and purposes, it's just another
tournament — it just happens to be the best
in terms of field and teams."
This tournament is being held in Albu
querque, which will also play host to the
NC'AA Championships at the end of the sea
son in May. Hence, the tournament is simply
a preview ot sorts for the real championships
down the road — a chance for the players to
feel out the course while sizing up possible
future competition.
Duke currently leads the field at the
NCAA Preview with a low score of 287, while
Pac-10 powers UCLA (2m) and USC (292)
are second and third respectively. Stanford is
not far behind, however, with an overall team
score of 301.
"Monday wasn't bad but we need to get a
[better] third and lourth score in,obviously,"
O'Connor said.
"I'm not looking at our place in the field
right now but more at where we can improve
going in tomorrow to close up some of those
gaps," she added.
Aside from its competition, the Cardinal
has had to deal with the growing pains that
come with having a young and relatively in
experienced team.The lineup of five does not
include a single senior but features two fresh
men. Piper Miller and Rebecca Durham.
Miller shot a seven-over-par 80. and
Durham fired an eight-over 81 in the pair's
first tests on the national collegiate stage.
Although not overly excited. O'Connor
said she was not disappointed with her young
team's performance.
"It's been a really crazy last three weeks
for us since we've been on campus," she ex
plained. "It's our second competition, and
we've really been all over the place. We have
two juniors, one sophomore and two fresh
men in the lineup. We're just trying to get
going, staying focused on what we do well
and make it better for tomorrow."
Stanford resumes tournament play today,
with the second round of competition begin
ning at 8 a.m.
