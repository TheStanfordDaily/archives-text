## Sexual health ranking drops forty spots Sexual education and resources compared in nationwide college survey 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Imagine what would happen if, after just one year,
Stanford fell 37 places in U.S. News & World Re
port's annual college ranking list. What kind of out
cry could the University expect from students and
alumni? What sort of changes could we expect to see
on campus?
While Stanford may never have to face the reality
of plummeting from fourth to 41st in the magazine's
list, the University's sexual health resources ranking
has, in fact, fallen that many places in the span of a
single year.
Trojan, one of the nation's leading condom manu
facturers, released its second annual Sexual Health
Report Card on Sept. 10. The Report Card surveyed
139 colleges and universities from every state and
major NCAA Division 1 conference and graded the
sexual health resources and services made available
to the student bodies of each school.
Stanford, which carried the number four spot in
last year's Report Card, fell to number 41 this year.
