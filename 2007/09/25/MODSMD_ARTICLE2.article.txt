## Sexual health ranking drops forty spots Sexual education and resources compared in nationwide college survey 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Imagine what would happen if, after just one year,
Stanford fell 37 places in U.S. News & World Re
port's annual college ranking list. What kind of out
cry could the University expect from students and
alumni? What sort of changes could we expect to see
on campus?
While Stanford may never have to face the reality
of plummeting from fourth to 41st in the magazine's
list, the University's sexual health resources ranking
has, in fact, fallen that many places in the span of a
single year.
Trojan, one of the nation's leading condom manu
facturers, released its second annual Sexual Health
Report Card on Sept. 10. The Report Card surveyed
139 colleges and universities from every state and
major NCAA Division 1 conference and graded the
sexual health resources and services made available
to the student bodies of each school.
Stanford, which carried the number four spot in
last year's Report Card, fell to number 41 this year.
three places below UC-Berkeley
and worse than every Ivy League
school save Cornell. The University
of Minnesota was rated first, tied
with the University of Wyoming.
Louisiana Tech University ranked
last.
While much of the survey re
mained the same, Trojan did expand
the criteria this year as part of its na
tional "Evolve" campaign for in
creased sexual dialogue. Major rank
changes from last year, therefore,
were not uncommon â€” the Uni
versity of Wyoming jumped 91 spots
into the top slot this year.
Here at Stanford, sexual health
resources and information are made
available to the student bodv

through the Sexual Health Peer Re
scurce Center (SHPRC) at Vaden
Health Center.The SHPRC is a Vol
untary Student Organization fi
nanced through ASSIJ Special Fees
funding. It is almost entirely run by a
student staff under the supervision
of Vaden's Health Promotion Ser
vices.
Donnovan Yisrael '89. manager
of sexual health and relationship
programs at Vaden. said that he does
not see any significant change that
has occurred in the SHPRC within
the past year that could account for
the change in the Trojan ranking.
()verall, he credits the SHPRC and
its staff with providing the campus
with sexual health information and
resources ranging from pamphlets
and contraceptives to weekly classes
on sexual health.
"The SHPRC has been around in
some form or another since I was a
student, and 1 was a student in the

late '80s," Yisrael said. "It's really
great to have a student-run organi
zation that we don't have to do much
to keep going."
While Yisrael praised the
SHPRC staff members for the sexu
al health services they offer to the
Stanford community, he also sus
pects it is rare for an independent
student organization to handle both
the resource distribution and infor
mational classes for a university's
sexual health services.
"They're essentially a self-run
and self-sustaining organization." he
said.
According to Sev Guardado 09,
the Dorm Outreach Coordinator for
the SHPRC, the major obstacle the
center faces is making the student
body aware that the SHPRC exists
and getting students to take advan
tage of its services.
"1 think that the biggest problem
isn't that the resources aren't there,"

Guardado said. "We have a really
great set of counselors. I think the
biggest problem is that people really
don't know that we're there."
One of Guardado's goals for the
SHPRC as the quarter progresses is
to start a monthly newsletter, in ad
dition to increasing contact with
Resident Assistants (RAs) in fresh
man dorms and making freshmen
aware of the resources available to
them.
During New Student Orientation
each year. University officials make
an effort to inform freshmen of the
sexual health resources available on
campus, specifically in programs like
the "Real World: Stanford" and in
discussions with dorm Peer Health
Educators (PHEs). Even so, the
practical information does not al
ways reach the entire freshman
class.
"1 think they did a good job of ex
plaining what services are avail

able," said Alex Carney '11."But not
so much where to go or how to go
about getting them."
By SHPRC policy, all Stanford
undergrads are guaranteed $2 worth
of free sexual health supplies per ac
ademic quarter, and additional sup
plies are available at a significantly
reduced cost. These supplies include
personal lubricants, dental dams and
male and female condoms of all
shapes, sizes and flavors.
However, some of Stanford's
peer institutions trump the Univer
sity when it comes to providing sex
ual health resources and supplies:
the USC's sexual health resource
room provides unlimited free con
doms for all students, while Cal Tech
has free condoms available in all
housing facilities.
While Stanford may have some
room to improve in providing sexual
health resources to students, at least
according to Trojan, Yisrael advised

that universities in general pay clos
er attention to the sexual health of
their student bodies, stating that, at
Stanford, the importance of sexual
health is often underemphasized in
favor of more aggressive issues such
as alcohol education and relation
ship abuse prevention.
"Sexual health 20 years ago when
AIDS just came out was like the
hottest issue around," Yisrael said.
"It's an ongoing need, but it's not at
the top of the priorities for the Uni
versity or even for Health Promo
tion Services."
The SHPRC is located on the sec
ond floor of Vaden Health Center
and is open Monday through Friday
from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., though it has
been closed for the entire summer
and is not scheduled to reopen until
Oct. 1.
