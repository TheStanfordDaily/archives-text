The all-female a cappella group Counterpoint reenacted Justin Timberlake's "Dick in a Box" skit at last night's "O-
Show" in Memorial Auditorium. Two student dance groups and all nine a cappella groups performed at the show, an
annual New Student Orientation event featuring Stanford artistic talent.
