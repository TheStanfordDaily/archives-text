## Video game system increases research output 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM DESK EDITOR 
Looking for an excuse to tell your parents before you
buy that new Play Station 3 (PS3)?
Tell them you're helping medical research. You won't
be lying.
In fact, PS3 consoles contribute tremendously to
Stanford's Folding@Home protein folding research.
The video game systems perform over 75 percent of the
program's work, even though they comprise only 16
percent of the total machines working on the project.
When proteins in the body prepare to execute a task,
they go through a process known as protein folding, ac
cording to Folding@Home head Vijay Pande, a profes
sor of structural biology and chemistry. When proteins
do not fold properly, scientists believe, illnesses such as
Huntington's Disease and cystic fibrosis can occur.
The Folding@Home project uses the concept of dis
tributed computing to parcel out lots of work to many
individuals across the world via the Internet. At first,
this included only personal computers, but in 2006 the
project started utilizing PS3s, which can be connected to

do calculations for the research. l"he
results were staggering.
According to the group's Web site,
trajectories that used to take years to
plot now take just a few weeks or
months.
"The primary advantage of the
Play Station 3 is pure speed," Pande
said, adding that the gaming machine
is capable of calculations up to 20
times faster than the earlier methods.
The modeling and calculations in
volved in understanding protein fold-

ing require an extraordinary amount of
computer processing power — millions
of operations per second. With even in
dustry standard supercomputing re-

sources, this could mean years' worth of number
crunching: Pande's group's first simulation, on
Alzheimer's disease, ran nonstop for nearly two years
straight.
That's where the PS3's powerful processor comes in.
With this huge gain in power from the video game sys-

tem has come a great leap in research
progress. Last week, the project
reached the peraflop mark; a flop is a
floating point operation per second,
and one peraflop equals 10'' opera
tions per second.
Pande compared that number to the
number of people in the world as a
point of reference.
"If you gave everyone on the planet a
calculator and they hit the keys in one
second, that would be one-sixth the
power of a Play Station 3," Pande ex-

plained."And that's just one PlayStation3.
We have 30 to 40 thousand active."
The research data collected from the

Folding@Home project has led to articles
in a number of prestigious scientific publications, includ
ing a 2007 paper in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Now all you need to do is to buv some games.
