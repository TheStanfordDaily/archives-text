GAME NOTES: After a pair of wins last weekend, the
Stanford men will look to extend their winning
streak to three on Friday against the Cougars,
who lost for the first time last week to Central
Florida. Senior Dan Shapiro has scored three
goals in Stanford's last two outings and is the sec
ond highest scorer in the ftac-10 this season.

Head coach Bret Simon applauded
the level of play through the weekend.
"In general, we were pleased with the
two wins over the weekend," he said. "I
believe that both teams we played posed
interesting problems and [that they] will
be strong teams as the season progresses
and in their conference play."
Despite the convincing wins, however,
the team has some room for improve
ment. In what has become standard prac
tice this season, the Cardinal offense was
anemic for much of the first half in both
matches.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro's goal in
the 27th minute against the Tigers
marked only the second time this season
that Stanford has scored before the half
time whistle. Shapiro found the back of
the net after controlling a pass from
freshman forward and midfielder Bobby
Warsi.aw at the top of the 18-yard box.
Stanford fired eight first half shots on
goal while holding Princeton to just one.
Shapiro stormed into the second half,
scoring again in the 51st minute before
the Tigers finally got on the board.
Princeton notched its only goal on a
header by Teddy Schnieder after Stan
ford's sophomore goalie John Moore left
the goal box to deflect another shot.The
Cardinal quickly regained its two-goal
lead, however, as Warshaw added a third
