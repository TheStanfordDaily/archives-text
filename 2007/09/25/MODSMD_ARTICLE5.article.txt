GAME NOTES: After a pair of wins last weekend, the
Stanford men will look to extend their winning
streak to three on Friday against the Cougars,
who lost for the first time last week to Central
Florida. Senior Dan Shapiro has scored three
goals in Stanford's last two outings and is the sec
ond highest scorer in the ftac-10 this season.

Head coach Bret Simon applauded
the level of play through the weekend.
"In general, we were pleased with the
two wins over the weekend," he said. "I
believe that both teams we played posed
interesting problems and [that they] will
be strong teams as the season progresses
and in their conference play."
Despite the convincing wins, however,
the team has some room for improve
ment. In what has become standard prac
tice this season, the Cardinal offense was
anemic for much of the first half in both
matches.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro's goal in
the 27th minute against the Tigers
marked only the second time this season
that Stanford has scored before the half
time whistle. Shapiro found the back of
the net after controlling a pass from
freshman forward and midfielder Bobby
Warsi.aw at the top of the 18-yard box.
Stanford fired eight first half shots on
goal while holding Princeton to just one.
Shapiro stormed into the second half,
scoring again in the 51st minute before
the Tigers finally got on the board.
Princeton notched its only goal on a
header by Teddy Schnieder after Stan
ford's sophomore goalie John Moore left
the goal box to deflect another shot.The
Cardinal quickly regained its two-goal
lead, however, as Warshaw added a third

Junior midfielder TJ Novak and the Cardinal won twice last weekend, giving up only a single goal in the
process. The Cardinal will face a challenge from the College of Charleston, which just lost for the first timp
score five minutes later.
There were two yellow cards
handed out in the contest, one to jun
ior T.J. Novak and one to Princeton's
Devin Muntz.
"1 don't believe this weekend's
games were overly physical." Simon
said. "We generally had a little more
[possession] than our opponents.
Both Princeton and Davidson play
with a lot of effort, are well coached
and have a lot of pride, so they cer
tainly competed hard. Sometimes,
that bubbles over to fouls. I think our
players handled themselves well and

kept pushing the game forward and
positively."
Stanford dominated Davidson in
the first half Sunday, registering nine
shots, but could not manage a goal
and entered the break knotted in a 0-
(I tic
Shapiro scored his team-high
fourth goal of the season with a head
er to the left corner of the net in the
50th minute.The senior is the second
leading goalscorer in the Pac-10,
trailing only Washington's Kevin
Forrest, who has six scores.
The Cardinal held a dominating

19-2 advantage over the Wildcats in
shots, and junior midfielder and for
ward Tom Montgomery capitalized
on a cross from sophomore midfield
er and forward Thiago Sa Freire late
in the second half to give Stanford
the 2-0 lead it held to the finish.
Simon addressed his team's slow
starts and weak finishes thus far this
season.
"Our biggest concerns have been
with the first 10 minutes and the last
10 minutes of our games." he said.
"We would like to be stronger and
sharper early in the game and be bet

ter able to finish out the end of games
when we are in the lead.The first sets
the tempo for the first half and the
second allows you to secure a lead
late in the game. And those are two
areas where we haven't excelled
yet."
The Cardinal won't take to the
field again until Friday, when it takes
on the College of Charleston (6-1-0)
in the squad's last non-conference
game.
