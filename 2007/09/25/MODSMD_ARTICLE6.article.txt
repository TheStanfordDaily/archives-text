Starting this fall, Facebook will no longer be solely a
forum for friendly wall posts and guilty late night pro
crastination. The online social networking site has infil
trated all aspects of college life and now has a place in
the Stanford classroom.
Computer Science 377W: "Create Engaging Web
Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Face
book" is a new experimental course offered this quar
ter. ITie class will be taught by B.J. Fogg '95, director of
the Persuasive Technology Lab, and Dave McClurc. a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur and software developer.
Dan Aekerman-Greenberg'oB will serve as the course's
teaching assistant (TA).
The instructors of the class hope to gain insight into
the realm of human online interaction by studying the
psychology of Facebook. The inspiration for the course
came from the Persuasive Technology Lab's interest in
Facebook's ability to influence the beliefs and actions
of its users, such as donating money to a cause.
Although the class is offered through the Computer
Science Department, it aims to give students from all
academic backgrounds the opportunity to build and
market user-friendly applications via the Facebook
platform and the course's instructors have encouraged
students from all disciplines to enroll. Students will
work in groups of three to create applications and mon
itor the way others use them, thus utilizing a variety of
skill sets.
"The class is not so much about Facebook but the in
teraction between the user and the web applications,"
Fogg explained. "Therefore, the class is not focused on
the building of Facebook applications but, rather, how
to create persuasive and engaging user experiences. In
order to do this, we'll look at numerical measurements
like number of users and engagement but also qualita
tive measurements like feedback from users."
Ackerman-Greenberg, who has worked for Fogg in
the Persuasive Technology Lab for the past year, added
that Facebook is an ideal platform through which to in
teract and learn.
"8.J., Dave and 1 have been really excited by F ace
book," he said. "Facebook provides an awesome oppor
tunity to look at the way people interact on the Web on
our own terms, as we are able to create and tailor our
applications as we wish. It is an ideal testing ground."
The course has created quite a buzz on campus and
beyond. About % students have already registered on
Axess for the class, which will ultimately be capped at
40 to 50 students. Additionally, Ackerman-Greenberg
