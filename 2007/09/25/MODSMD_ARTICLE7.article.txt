## Former prof, gives large gift Despite financial loss, Doty donates to Med school 
### VICTOR CRUZ 
When former Sehool of Medicine
Prof. James Doty gave a gift of stock
to the department of neurosurgery in
2000, the donation was only a fraction
of the entrepreneur's $75 million for
tune.
In the same year. Doty also placed
a down payment on a $5 million San
Francisco home, purchased an Italian
villa and was in the process of buying
an island in New Zealand. Shortly
after giving Stanford the stock, the
dot-com bust left Doty $3 million in
debt, but the neurosurgeon decided
not to rescind his donation to the
University — a gift that amounted to
$5.4 million when the University re
cently sold Doty's stock, effectively
releasing the largest portion of his re
maining assets.
Despite his personal losses. Doty
remained optimistic about both his
donation and his work.
"Neurosurgeons get paid well," he
said. "1 never expect anyone to feel
sorry for me that 1 gave away every
thing. 1 think that the moral of the
story is not about the wealth but ful
filling obligations. When I was $3 mil
lion in the hole, 1 could have gotten
out of the donation, but 1 said I
wouldn't."
Doty amassed a fortune of $75
million by involving himself in proj
ects that interested him.
"Don't get me wrong," he said.
"The money is great, but it came sort
of as a by-product of the projects I
was involved in."
Doty's interests and financial re
sources intersected in his develop
ment of medical technologies. Dur
ing his residency. Doty developed an

electrode for monitoring brain activ
ity during surgery. He also started a
company, Neurotechnics, to manu
facture and sell the electrode.
"|lt| is still used around the
world," he said. "But the point of all
this is not that 1 was interested in
making money. ITie company came
from looking at these problems."
Doty's donation came in the
form of stock from a company
called Accuray, which centers
around a technology called "cy
berknife." 'ITiis technology, devel
oped by Neurosurgery Prof. John
Adler. employs extremely precise
radiation to treat tumors. Doty
served as Accuray"s CEO from 1997
to 1999 and made his donation to
Stanford the following year.
Doty's gift is one of the largest
ever from a faculty member. Ac
cording to Department of Neuro
surgery - Chair Gary Steinberg, pri
vate donations like Doty's have be
come more important in funding re
search at the School of Medicine in
recent years.
"Traditionally the NIH [National
Institutes of Health] has been a huge
source of money," Steinberg ex
plained."lt still is,but it is tough times

for the NIH and we have been de
pending more and more on private
philanthropy."
The hulk of Doty's gifts will be
used to endow a chair in the neuro
surgery department.
The first recipient will be Neuro
surgery Prof. Pak Chan. "He's a bril
liant scientist who is investigating cell
death," Steinberg said. "The endow
ment will allow Dr. Chan to continue
pioneering new techniques used in
neurosurgery."
Since the sale of the stock in
2006, Doty said he has been focus
ing on new projects with the Dalai
Lama Foundation in hopes of bring
ing neuroscientists and the Dalai
l.ama together for a symposium on
neural cognition. Doty said he
hopes to define and look at the
anatomic basis of altruism and com
passion. two traits that Doty has
taken to heart.
"What saddens me is that there
are not more who actually donate to
projects that concern them," he said.
"It's really a question of how much
wealth you need."
