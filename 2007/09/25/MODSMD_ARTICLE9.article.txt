U freshmen and transfer stu
dents anxiously waited to
meet their roommates, with
whom they would live for the entirety of
their first year at Stanford. The new stu-

dents had filled out forms earlier in the
summer detailing everything from their
music preferences to their sleep patterns.

But instead of being paired by a computer pro
gram or by an administrator, the job of roommate
matching fell to three Stanford students. New Un
dergraduate Housing Coordinators Jodi Harris
'09, Tricia Huerta "07 and Adhanet Keflezighi
'09.

The threesome's job description includ
ed "[delving] into the psychology, quirks
and eccentricities of the Class of 2011."

ITiey spent this summer assigning stu
dents to dorms and putting together

about 800 rooms (doubles, triples, quads
and a few singles), a process that 1 larris and

Huerta called "difficult, yet exciting."The Daily
had a few questions for these matchmakers, who
responded jointly in an email reviewed by a
Housing Assignments media relations represen
tative before publication.
The Stanford Daily: What do you aim for in creat
ing a match? What would the ideal roommate pair
look like?
Jodi Harris and Tricia Huerta: We aim for a pair
that is different enough to learn from each other
but still feel comfortable sharing their living
space with one another. We often look for simi
larities in student's passions, but with different
focuses. For instance, maybe two girls love to

dance,
but one prac-

tices ballet while
the other dances

salsa. Maybe they
share a learned language
or have a die-hard love for surf-

ing. We hope that roommates are
open enough with each other that, over
time, thev will discover these shared interests.

TSI): How do you use the information on the forms
to get a sense of the individual's personality?

ALEXANDER NARUHIKO CHEE/The Stanford Daily
,IH & TH: We first look at
objective details, like bedtimes or a student's so
cialness/messiness self-rating. Study habits and
music preferences are also taken into account.
Beyond that, we look at more specific aspects,
like past extracurricular activities, academic inter
ests and personal hobbies.The last major aspect of
the roommate form is the Comment Box. Stu
dents get to write to us about concerns or specific

needs that they have. From this, we can hear the
individual's voice and, depending on how much
they write, get a sense of their personality. We use
all of these in combination with one another to
piece together a concept of the student and do our
best to find someone who will complement them.
TSI): Did you have sole responsibility for the
roommate matching, or was there some adminis
trative oversight as well?
JH & TH: Student Housing feels that it is impor
tant that current students do the roommate
matching, as we can add the Stanford student's
perspective to the process. We have had room
mates in the past — we know what works and
what doesn't, what changes over time (sleep
schedules) and what doesn't change (messiness).
We meet with individuals from several different
departments at the beginning of the summer to
get input for the roommating process, but we are
trusted to make the actual matches, [though we]
are in constant contact with Student Housing.
TSI): Students often trade stories about interesting
roommate matches, such as pairing a Mary-Kate
and an Ashley, putting the shortest and the tallest
students in the dorm together or compiling a quad
whose residents are named Matthew. Mark, Luke
and John. Is there a lighter side to this job?
JH & TH: While such funny coincidences have oc
curred in the past, these pairs are never done
purely for laugh factor. They are generally put to
gether because of sincere compatibility We do not
seek out "cute" roommate pairs, but we enjoy it
when these do arise. We take pleasure in getting to
know each and every' freshman and transfer, and
we wish them all the best in the coming school
year!
