How I Write
"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts
and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the conversation
will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to
examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss
how a writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition,
overcomes various impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations.
Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors and Advanced Writing, Stanford Writing Center,
in a conversation on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers producing work in all fields and
genres.
Sponsored by the Hume Writing Center, Undergraduate Advising and Research, and the Program in
