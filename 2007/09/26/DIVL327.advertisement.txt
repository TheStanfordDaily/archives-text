When
decisions in
one city can
power another.
The energy that powers cities and towns, countries and continents
depends on feats of science and engineering. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline is 1,086 miles long and carries gas from the Caspian Sea to the
Mediterranean. While in the Gulf of Mexico we have one of the world's
deepest offshore production platforms, Atlantis, and a deepwater pipeline
system that lies in more than 6,500 feet of water and covers 450 miles.
This is what we are doing today. Imagine what you could be doing
tomorrow. We have opportunities in a range of engineering, science and
business roles, where you will gain the expert skills to innovate, create
and excel. Look beyond the limits.
