## I wish I were back in college 
### 
Over the summer, 1 had the opportuni
ty to see to the delightful musical
"Avenue Q" (for those of you who
haven't, check it out on You Tube), a song
and dance routine based on the trials and
tribulations of post-college life. Oh, and
there are puppets, lots of puppets.
(Since I've always been weirdly fascinat
ed by puppets, the show was right up my
alley. However, if you watched the "Child's
Play" movies during your formative years,
you may be disturbed by the graphic scenes
of sex and unemployment.)
Entertainment is provided by jokes, the
occasional piece of physical comedy and, of
course, the music. Songs include such mas
terpieces as: "It Sucks to Be Me" and
"Everybody's a Little Bit Racist."
As you can imagine, this is my kind of
show. In fact, watching it was a particularly
gnawing experience. The comedy and the
wit are pitched with a tone very similar to
my column. But funnier, much funnier. Ac
tually, whilst I laughed during the perform
ance. I walked out at the end feeling rather
depressed at the demonstration of what
one could achieve if one were, you know,
talented.
One particular moment of resonance
was the song "I Wish I Were Back in Col
lege." Hilarious. And I get it,'cos you know,
you leave college, life is shit, so you wish you
were back (since everyone's college experi
ence is a continual drug-fuelled sex-fest,
with all-night partying, friends for life and
homework).
On the other hand. I am back in college.
The fact that I chose to continue my studies
is because life is not so great outside of the
rarified atmosphere of academia. Further
more, five years ago, when I started my grad
school applications, I was fully expecting
that 1 would not only get an immersion in
theoretical physics, but I would also get an
other chance at fucking around.
I was wrong.
Well, aside from the immersion in
physics, every aspect of life in grad school is
nothing like being back in college. (Well,
apart from the obvious fact that one is, you
know, back in college.)
The greatest thing about undergraduate
life is not the sex or the drugs. It's the lack of
responsibility. More precisely, it's the sense
that you don't have to worry about the fu
ture. You're young; you can push all of that
decision-making off to the future.
Needless to say, this isn't the case in grad
uate school. There's no pushing decision
making off into the future. This is your ca
reer. This is when you become who you will
be when you die. No more speculating about
what you'll do when you're grown up â€”
you're grown up now.
There's no difference from having a real
job. Except that you get paid less. And have

less fun. And are more miserable.
Also in the responsibility vein: You can
no longer avoid those niggling adult tasks.
Paying bills. Buying cars. Finding housing.
Grocery shopping. Cooking. Pension-plan
ning. Complaining about the youth of
today.
To some large degree it's having to do
these tasks (or some subset of them) that
makes people long for their college days.
The problem is that this stuff is not a func
tion of being in college; it's a function of
growing up. And once you grow up, you
can't grow back down again.
In retrospect it seems ridiculous that I
could have believed grad school would be
an extension of my undergraduate days.
Clearly that part of my life could only last
for so long. But, I still can't help myself.
Whenever I doze off in my office (which is
frequently) 1 find myself imaging how life
should be in grad school...
Wake up each morning at 11 a.m. Roll
out of bed bleary eyed after a heavy night
partying (I should note that at least my fan
tasy is realistic enough that it doesn't in
volve rolling out of someone else's bed) and
stumble out into the common room of my
dorm.
There, I and my fellow partiers would
gather, collectively drink coffee and relate
our wild stories from the night before. After
an hour or so, we'd then stumble off to get
ready and then head to a leisurely lunch at a
student eatery, filled with like-minded folk
from every walk of academic life.
Afterwards, we'd settle in for a few hours
of intense work and become productive.
Progress would be continual and rapid.
Knowledge would fill us all, with healthy
bantering between students and faculty
keeping everyone sane.
A late dinner would mark the end of
work and the beginning of playtime. Some
times crazy partying, other times intellectu
al dinner parties or culturally-expansive
events. And finally to bed, to sleep and then,
back to the beginning.
Of course, it's nothing like this in reality.
My gentle afternoon reverie is usually inter
rupted by the sound of my approaching ad
visor and the accompanying realization that
I have work to do and nothing else to fill my
life. And neither do you.
