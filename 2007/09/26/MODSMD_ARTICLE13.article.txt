## 
### JORDAN CHAZIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a one-and-a-half years and $20
million worth of renovations, Old
Union officially re-opened its doors
yesterday at a noon ceremony held in
the Union courtyard.
Stanford Taiko opened the ceremony loudly
and without introduction, immediately grabbing
the attention of the students, faculty and alumni
who had gathered for the occasion, and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph. I). *82 gave a speech in
which he said the renovation of the Union will ef
fectively turn it back into a center for student life,
as it has been in the past.
The new Old Union, said Jeanette Smith-Laws,
assistant dean for student unions, is committed en
tirely to supporting students. One look around the
inside of the main building — there are inviting
couches around every corner — tells you that this
space was meant to be home to students looking
for diversity in their choice of places to study.
When John Arrillaga '60 cut the red ribbon
adorning the columns of the main building (a la
Stanford Stadium last year) a loud whistle blast
from the back of the courtyard announced the ar
rival of the Stanford Band, which concluded the
ceremony with a rendition of "All Right Now"
after which the crowd was invited inside to take a
peek at the new complex.
Students and faculty alike were excited about
the opportunities presented by the new space.
"It's very impressive,"said Giana Gallo'l l,who
attended the event with Jessica Salinas '11. "I'm
Native American and Jessica is Latin American, so
I'm sure we'll be spending a lot of time here [in El
Centro Chicano and the Native American Cultur
al Center]."
Residence Dean Valentina Del Olmo expressed
her satisfaction with the variety of study spaces.
"It's a furniture showcase in there," she said, re
ferring to the abundance of chairs and couches.
"Frankly, I'm jealous."
Old Union will be open seven days a week until
2 a.m. and its cafe. Axe and Palm, is meant to re
place the CoHo, which closed for good this sum
mer.
