## Card struggles at premier NCAA event Women's golf currently in 17th place at the NCAA Preview in Albuquerque; Chun tied for 15th place individually 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Competing at one of the toughest courses it will
play on all year, the Stanford women's golf team sits
in 17th place at the NCAA Preview tournament in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. The team's aggregate
score is 29-over-par (613) as it moves into today's
third round of play.
"I don't think it was one of our best scoring days
and 1 think we have some work to do but it's only
the beginning of the season," said junior ki-Shui
Liao.'l think our team has a lot of potential. We still
have a good chance to go out there tomorrow and
play well, so I don't know why we won't."
Junior Mari Chun had the top score of the day
for the Cardinal, tallying a three-over-par 76 on the
day, putting her in a 15th place tie individually.
Freshman Rebecca Durham was close behind Chun
with a four-over-par 77 while sophomore Catherina
Wang chipped in with a six-over-par 79.
Duke leads the tournament, while the Pac-lOtrio
of USC. Arizona State and UCLA sit in second,
third and fourth respectively.
The inexperienced Cardinal had a tough time at
the demanding course, which will also host the
NCAA Championships in May.
"It can definitely be a tough course to play well if
you're not going to be making the fairways." Chun
said. " Ibis course really makes you pay attention
and focus on each shot - each drive and approach
shot. The greens are very undulated, so every single
shot you are forced to focus and really put in your
full concentration.
"We'll be playing (the course] in the spring so ei
ther way we'll have to get used to it." Liao added.
