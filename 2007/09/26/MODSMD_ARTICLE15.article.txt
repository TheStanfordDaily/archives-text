# All hail the Anti-Walt

### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Driving to campus at the conclu
sion of a desolate three-day road trip
from Saint Louis — seriously, try
driving through Wyoming sometime
— a college football score on the
radio instantly grabbed my attention.
"At the halt it's Stanford leading
Oregon 31-24."
Shocked. 1 turned to my father and
said, "Now that would be a signature
win for Jim Harbaugh."
To which, he replied with a perfect
ly straight face: "That would be a sig
nature win for God."
So. while we all know that the final
score didn't turn out all that rosy for
the Cardinal as Oregon romped
through the second half en route to a
55-31 win. for one brief moment we all
believed in Stanford football again.
Call him the semi-divine Jim Har
baugh.

I kid, of course. It will take more
than a renewed sense of energy and
urgency through the first three
games of the season to make Har
baugh a true success on the Farm.
But already there is some indication
that the coach who has touted enthu
siasm and a competitive spirit as
keys to a Cardinal turnaround is on
the right track.
You see, the guy known as Captain
Comeback in his playing days in the
NFL just seems to"get it.'Twice, trail
ing in the second half, Stanford went
for it on fourth down. Under Walt
Harris last year, both of those tries
probably wouldn't have happened.
Indeed, last year those drives might
have ended with stealthily planned
third down punts intended to win the
battle of field position.
While I'm not knocking the occa
sional surprise punt —in the right
circumstances it can be a sound strat
egy — it clearly wasn't what the Car
dinal on the field or the fans in the
stands wanted to see last year. It said
that Stanford wasn't really out to win
football games last year, but rather to

avoid embarrassment. Because gen
erally speaking, conservative minded
football isn't how you pull off upsets.
And, as Harris found out at sea
son's end, his overall message was a
bad idea, as he was replaced with a
coach who has, so far, been the anti-
Walt. Aggressive, vocal and, at times,
controversial. Harbaugh has so far
been exactly the cure one might have
envisioned for the then-lifeless Stan
ford football program one year ago.
You can see it in his fire on the side
lines, at team workouts and even at
press conferences.
Because the first thing that needed
fixing wasn't the football on the field,
it was the air of hopelessness off of it.
Only at times during the always emo
tional Big Game was there a sense
that maybe the Cardinal could pull
off the upset.
Believe it or not, there was a time
when pulling off the upset was a big
part of Stanford's identity. Restoring
that knack for knocking off the fa
vorites will have to be a big part of
Harbaugh's rebuilding work. Be
cause, frankly, it's unlikely the Cardi
nal will dodge the role of the under
dog for the rest of this season. The
temporary scare Stanford gave the
Ducks on Saturday night was a good
first step in that direction.
Of course, it's not just enthusiasm

and hope that Harbaugh has brought
to the Farm; he and his staff have
brought results as well. Statistically,
the Cardinal have improved by leaps
and bounds. Last year, under Harris,
Stanford rushed for 781 yards with a
pitiful 2.1 yards per carry average.
This season under Harbaugh, a rush
ing attack returning most of its key
contributors has already gained 468
yards on a healthy 4.4 yards per carry
average.
The Cardinal have also added ex
plosiveness to their passing attack, av
eraging 279 yards per game through
the air in 2007 as opposed to the '06
mark of 167 yards per contest.
Basically, programs don't get
much worse than Stanford was last
year. Harbaugh has brought back a
level of respectability and hope on
and off the field that hasn't been seen
around here for some time.
The semi-divine Harbaugh? Not
just yet.The Anti-Walt? Now there's
a label 1 think Stanford fans every
where could support whole-heart
edly.

Denis Griffin is a senior who wonders
if we '11 all be worshipping at the church
of "an enthusiasm unknown to
mankind" sometime soon. Let him
