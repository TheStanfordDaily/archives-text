Driving to campus at the conclu
sion of a desolate three-day road trip
from Saint Louis — seriously, try
driving through Wyoming sometime
— a college football score on the
radio instantly grabbed my attention.
"At the halt it's Stanford leading
Oregon 31-24."
Shocked. 1 turned to my father and
said, "Now that would be a signature
win for Jim Harbaugh."
To which, he replied with a perfect
ly straight face: "That would be a sig
nature win for God."
So. while we all know that the final
score didn't turn out all that rosy for
the Cardinal as Oregon romped
through the second half en route to a
55-31 win. for one brief moment we all
believed in Stanford football again.
Call him the semi-divine Jim Har
baugh.
