# Men's and women's tennis look to maintain past prestige
## Cardinal seeks 29th NCAA bid after missing tourney last season 
### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ilie Stanford men's tennis team refuses to let ugly
memories from last year prevent it from reasserting it
self as a dominant NCAA power this year. While last
season was marred by injuries, inconsistent play and a
brutal schedule, this year's squad hopes to return to its
winning ways.
"I expect Stanford tennis to get back to where we be
long, which is at the top," said junior Jeff Zeller. "Last
season is over and done with.We know what we need to
work on to be successful, so we aren't going to dwell on
the past."
Injuries and a demanding Pac-10 schedule hurt the
Cardinal last year.
"It is clearly evident in our results that injuries hurt us
a lot last year," junior Blake Mullcr said. "And although
we may not have gotten the wins, we did gain a lot of ex
perience. It also gave all the young guys the chance tosee
what it takes to play at the collegiate level and it showed
them where we need to be."

One of last year's bright spots occurred in May. when
then-sophomore Malt Bruch — who was hurt for much
of the year — became only the third player in Stanford
history to win consecutive Pac-10 singles titles.
Bruch also teamed with Muller to win the Pac-10
doubles title last year, making him one of only two play
ers in Stanford history to win Pac-10 titles in both singles
and doubles in the same season. Despite his success at
the conference level, however. Bruch was forced to with
draw from the NCAA singles and doubles champi
onships due to injury.
Kevin Kaiser. Paul Morrissey and Richard Wire
all sophomores — were consistent members of the six
man lineup and will return for the new season with a
year's worth of experience in dual match play.
Wire, who played both No. 1 and No. 2 singles at times
last year, said he is eagerly anticipating building on his
success from last year.
"I am looking forward to this season." said Wire, who
is from England. "Some matches have extra meaning for
me, such as [this Friday's] match where we are playing
the University of Great Britain. I have friends on the
team and I want to show them how great Stanford ten
nis is by beating them."
