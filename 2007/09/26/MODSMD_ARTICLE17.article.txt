Irreplaceable.
That's what Theresa Logar *07 and Anne Yelsey "07
were as Stanford women's tennis players the last four
years. The Cardinal women were the anchors to a squad
that engineered three national titles and an unfath
omable 89-match win streak.
With their departure, however, the team's dominant
1-2 punch is missing at the start of this season.
"ITieresa and Anne were two of the most competitive
people 1 have ever witnessed in my entire life." sopho
more Lindsay Burdette said. " ITieresa was much more
outspoken and goofy at times, and that brought such an
element to the team. Meanwhile, Anne's ability to lead
and to he stern and confident really helped us at times as
well.
"They just complemented each other so well and they
were great leaders and seniors."
In addition to leading the squad. Logar and Yelsey
have left a permanent mark on the program.

"You could never replace Theresa or Anne," said sen
ior Celia Dm kin. "They were such unique personalities
and they've always been role models to me. But. our team
will definitely build in different ways as it grows."
Despite losing Logar and Yelsey. the team's goal re
mains the same: reclaim the national championship that
slipped away from them last year.
"We almost went undefeated last year except for two
losses," Durkin said. "And 1 think we can go undefeated
this season."
Iliis year's team is younger than in year's past. Last
year. Burdettc was the only freshman on a mature Cardi
nal squad. This year, there are four new players, three of
them freshmen.
"It's good having a lot of freshman on the team be
cause there's so much energy," Durkin said. "The new
freshmen have a very all-court game which is great for
singles and doubles. They are adding a ton to the team
and they're already fitting right in."
But. with new players comes adjustment, according to
head coach Lele Forood.
"We have a lot of turnover on this year's team,"
Forood said. "Right now, it's all about getting the new
players up to speed not only with adjustment to college
but also with practices and their game. We like to see

what they do well and what they need
to work on in the fall."
While the newest members of the
Stanford team acclimate themselves,
the burden of carrying on the win
ning tradition has fallen on the shoul
ders of returning players like Durkin,
who is ranked ninth in the ITA pre
season rankings.
"Celia spent this past summer aca
demically in Europe for her German
Studies major," Forood said. "She
took a step back from her tennis this
summer but now she's really revved
up for the start of her senior year."
Returning with Durkin are fellow
seniors Whitney Deason and Lejla
Hodzic who will also provide much
needed leadership for the young
squad.
Also returning is junior Jessica
Nguyen, who suffered a foot injury at
last season's end, but is now healthy

and retains a No. 15 preseason rank
ing.
"Its improved," Nguyen said."lt's
fortunately at about 95 percent right
now. I played on it over the summer
and it felt fine. So hopefully it'll stay
up through the season."
Forood said she has confidence
that Nguyen's injury has healed and
will not affect the junior's play.
"We got through the injury issues
early in the summer and Jessica was
able to start competing the second
half of summer," Forood said. "So ob
viously, it's all systems go for her. I'm
looking for great tournaments from
her in the fall."
The final piece to Stanford's puz
zle was last year's freshman phenom
Burdette, who is currently 16th in the
rankings.
"Lindsay obviously had a great
freshman year," Forood said. "So she
got a chance to play some more this
summer and she's just that much
more experienced entering this year.
She now knows what the college
landscape is like and 1 think she'll
have a pretty good start to this season

as well."
Having already showed she ean
perform at the collegiate level, Bur
dette has lost her element of surprise,
but welcomes the challenge that high
expectations bring.
"On paper, there's more pressure
on me to perform this year so 1 need
to do a good job of not letting that
pressure get to me," she said. "Ihis
year 1 hope to do a little better in the
fall. Because I'm coming in this year
at 16, I'll have more of an opportuni
ty by getting in singles matches and
improve my ranking."
While the squad is loaded with tal
ent, its members know that talent
alone does not win championships.
"Over the summer, everyone
builds their games so much so it's like
coming in with a new group," Nguyen
said. "We come in together and we
know we've all worked hard. So com
ing into the season, we'll keep work
ing hard and it'll show up in our
matches."
