Irreplaceable.
That's what Theresa Logar *07 and Anne Yelsey "07
were as Stanford women's tennis players the last four
years. The Cardinal women were the anchors to a squad
that engineered three national titles and an unfath
omable 89-match win streak.
With their departure, however, the team's dominant
1-2 punch is missing at the start of this season.

freshmen have a very all-court game which is great for
singles and doubles. They are adding a ton to the team
and they're already fitting right in."
But. with new players comes adjustment, according to
head coach Lele Forood.
"We have a lot of turnover on this year's team,"
