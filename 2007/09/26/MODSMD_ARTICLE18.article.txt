## Microsoft ponders $500 million investment in Facebook Offer would pin value of Facebook at $10 billion 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Setting the
stage for a possible bidding battle. Microsoft
Corp. is mulling an investment in Facebook
Inc. that would value the rapidly growing
online hangout at $10 billion or more, ac
cording to a report published Monday.
Citing unnamed people familiar with the
matter. The Wall Street Journal said Mi
crosoft is holding preliminary discussions
that could culminate in a $300 million to
$500 million investment in Facebook, a Palo
Alto social-networking site founded just
31/2 years ago.

In exchange for the money, Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft would receive up to
a 5 percent stake in privately held Face
hook. which has previously raised nearly
$41 million from venture capitalists and
other individual investors.
Facebook declined to comment on the
reported discussions as did Microsoft, which
branded the report as "rumor and specula
tion."
An outright sale of Facebook is consid
ered unlikely. Mark Zuckerberg, Face
book's 23-year-old co-founder and chief ex
ecutive. has repeatedly expressed his desire
to remain independent. He rejected a $1 bil
lion acquisition offer from Yahoo Inc. last
year.
Facebook also has been exploring
whether to raise more money from venture
capitalists to help expand its current payroll

of roughly 300 employees and finance other
parts of its ambitious expansion plans.
With more than $100 million in annual
revenue, Facebook is believed to be a prime
candidate for an initial public offering of
stock next year or in 2009.
If Facebook's talks with Microsoft heat
up, it could draw online search leader
Google Inc. to the negotiating table, too.
"Google would love to keep it out of the
hands of Microsoft or at least drive up the
price," said Forrester Research analyst Josh
Bernoff.
Two years ago, Microsoft and Google
vied against each other to buy a 5 percent
stake in lime Warner Inc.'s AOL, with
Google ultimately prevailing by agreeing to
invest $1 billion into the company as part of
a wide-ranging advertising partnership.
Microsoft already is delivering online

ads to Facebook in the United States as
part of an agreement that expires in 2011.
Citing unnamed sources, the Journal also
reported Microsoft and Facebook are con
sidering extending the current contract
and expanding the advertising to other
parts of the world.
Already a popular online hangout
among teens and adults, Facebook has
broadened its appeal during the past year by
allowing people of all ages to set up person
al profiles on the site and making it easier
for other Internet companies to run their
applications on its users' pages.
By building its own computing platform,
Facebook has emerged as more a threat to
Microsoft, Bernoff said. Investing in Face
book is one way for Microsoft to hedge its
bets, he said.
With about 42 million active users, Face

book ranks as the Web's second most traf
ficked social network behind News Corp.'s
MySpace.com.
Now, it appears some of the biggest
names on the Internet are vying for a piece
of the action.
Having been rebuffed by Facebook.
Yahoo is testing a new social service called
"Mash" and recently struck a deal to deliver
ads in England and Ireland to the social net
work Bebo. Meanwhile, the blogosphere is
buzzing with speculation that Google plans
to introduce new social networking prod
ucts later this year.
"We're always looking for new ways to
help our users connect with each other,
share information, and express themselves,
but we don't have any new details to share
at this time," Google said in a statement pro
vided Monday.
