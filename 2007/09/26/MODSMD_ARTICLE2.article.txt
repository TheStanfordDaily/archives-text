# Universities nationwide confront campus safety issues following Virginia Tech massacre
## Emergency plan for campus crisis expanded 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly six months after a student killed 32
people before turning a gun on himself at
Virginia Tech, university officials across the
country have had time to reflect on the mas
sacre and determine how best to prevent a
similar tragedy from occurring at their
school.
According to a recent article in The Los
Angeles Times, colleges nationwide are
ramping up security efforts in the wake of the

April shootings. Among them, USC, UC-
Irvine and Pepperdine University have each
rolled out new systems for alerting students
on their respective campuses in case of an
emergency.
USC's "Trojan Alert" system uses various
methods to reach students, including text
messages and emails. The system is capable
of immediately notifying all USC students
and their parents in the event of an earth
quake, malevolent gunman or other threat to
campus safety.
Last Mav, President John Hennessv an

nounced in a letter to the editor printed in
ITie Daily that Stanford would he creating a
committee headed by Vice President of lousi

University's existing emergency protocols as
well as campus-wide communication sys
tems.
"Currently, Stanford can. within minutes,
send an emergency email message to every
one with a Stanford email address," Liv
ingston said in an email toThe Daily."We can
also deliver an emergency voice mail to each
voice mailbox on the Stanford phone sys

tem."
According to Livingston, the panel re
viewed the Virginia Tech report findings,
which largely criticized the school for its in
ability to contact students and lock down
dormitories after the 112 irst of the two separate
shootings occurred. Had communication
been better and had classes been canceled,
the report said, the death toll might have
been lower.
The panel is still in the process of applying
these ideas to campus safety programs at
Stanford. Livingston said.

"Our emergency protocols are good, but
the realities of today's society demand that
they be even better," Hennessy acknowl
edged in his letter.
Many students are skeptical of both the
possibility of such a tragedy happening at
Stanford and of the effectiveness of existing
campus safety measures.
"I don't think that sort of thing would hap
pen here," said Pam Geist '08. "But if it did.
we'd be no better off [even with the mass
