## Guilty plea in cash-for-grades scam 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MARTINEZ,CaIif. (AP) A former community col
lege student who worked in the school records office
pleaded guilty Tuesday to helping classmates get their
grades changed on official transcripts in a scam that en
abled some students to transfer to four-year universi
ties.
Julian Revilleza, 26. pleaded guilty to 15 felony
counts of fraudulent computer access under a deal with
prosecutors that calls for him to be sentenced to one
year in Contra Costa County jail instead of the four
years in state prison he faced.
Revilleza, who preparing to graduate from Califor
nia Polytechnic State University when he was arrested
in July, also agreed to help authorities in their ongoing
investigation of the cash-for-grades scandal at Diablo
Valley College. Prosecutor Dodie Katague described

Revilleza as the mastermind of the cheating plot, which
involved students paying employees in the admissions
office to change their grades on college computers.
"The sentence, 1 think, is a good sentence," Katague
said. "It punishes him and sends a signal to other peo
ple: Don't even try this."
Defense lawyer Stephen Naratil said Revilleza "re
alized what he did was wrong, and he wanted to resolve
it as quickly as he could."
So far, criminal charges have been brought against
34 current or former Diablo Valley College students.
Katague said he is reviewing evidence against 21 other
people.
An investigation by the college found that about 4(X)
grades were raised over the six years the scheme was
ongoing. Some of the students who had their grades
changed transferred to University of California cam
puses that are reviewing their eligibility.
