### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's California Beta chapter of Phi Kappa Psi frater
nity received the Grand Chapter Award at a recent leadership
conference,distinguishing the University's chapter as the most
in line with the national fraternity's goals.
The Stanford chapter also received the award — which is
given annually to one of more than 100 chapters nationwide —

These lofty sentiments can sometimes make Phi Psi a social
outsider on campus.
"I think Phi Psi is an excellent fraternity for those commit

be named due to personal ties to the fraternity."However, I am
doubtful that its presence contributes meaningfully to the
Stanford social life. In my mind, having a fraternity house gives
the organization an obligation to bring the Stanford communi
ty together through social functions."
While acknowledging that Phi Psi, which some students call
a "franerdity," has a reputation for being a little bit geeky. Of
ficer described the numerous alternative social events Phi Psi
organizes and sponsors.
"Although we do not throw fratty keggers, much of the cam
