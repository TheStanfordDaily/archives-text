## New Harry Potter class casts spell on freshmen 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There may not be any more Harry
Potter books coming out. but the magic
will continue at Stanford this fall with
"Harry Potter and the Arc of Story
telling," a highly coveted Student Initi
ated Course (SIC).
A giddy crowd of nearly 100 hopeful

students gathered in Building 460 last
night for a chance to explore various
themes of the best-selling book series.
But early in the evening.course leaders
Caley Anderson '08 and Christine O'-
Connell '08 broke the news that the
class would be capped at 20 students.
When they said the lucky students
would be selected via random lottery
not sorting hat — the crowd broke out

in protest.
"We thought there might be 30. 40
people max," said O'Connell, who
sported a lightning bolt on her fore
head. "When we saw the number signed
up tin Coursework. we were shocked."
The class is the first at Stanford to
tackle the entire Harry Potter series in
one quarter. Last winter, a similar SIC
led by Ari Neumann '07 focused on pre

dictions for the seventh book based on
clues provided in the first six.
"With the seventh book out. J.K.
Rowling has said all she's going to say.
and it's our turn to discuss what it
means." O'Connell said.
Each week, students will discuss a
different overarching theme, such as

"Families," "Foreshadowing" and
"Harry as Hero." To receive credit
for the course, each student must
complete a six-page paper on a cho
sen Harry Potter theme.
Motivations for taking the class
varied among students. Some fresh
men were urged to take the course by
O'Connell, who is a Resident Assis
tant in Cedro, while others wanted a
chance to discuss the beloved books
in an academic setting.
"We've all been Harry Potter fans
since childhood, and it's so cool to
talk about it now in the intellectual
setting of Stanford," said Emily Rials
'11, showing her Potter pride with a
pair of signature round black specta
cles, taped at the sides. "When you
put it in that context, it's so much
more than a children's book."
A pack of excited students left the

crowded classroom eager to enter
the class lottery, but only the lucky 20
will return next Tuesday night to dis
cuss Book 1 and "Beginnings." the
first theme of the course. But if the
level of enthusiasm among potential

Its so much
more than a children's
book.
