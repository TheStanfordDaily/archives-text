## Summer fires near Dish Flames swept foothills around campus for first time in years 
### ADAM SOWLATI STAFF WRITER 
After several years without any major tires,
the Stanford foothills exploded this summer in
a series of conflagrations that charred much of
the area near the Dish, leaving the popular run
ning and walking destination blackened and
closed for use for four weeks in June and July.
The initial fire ignited on June 25 when two
youths inadvertently set fire to some brush
while playing with matches.Their efforts to stop
the spread of the flames were unsuccessful, and
the fire ultimately burned 171 acres of land be
fore being brought under control.
According to Department of Public Safety
Deputy ( hris Cohendet, the investigation into

the June 25 fire is closed, and the case has been
sent to the District Attorney's juvenile depart
ment. which could press charges against the
youths.
[lie foothills were again engulfed in flames
on July 5 in a fire that burned 20 acres.The cause
of this fire remains unknown, but Cohendet
said that no evidence has been found that
would indicate criminal activity. Neither fire
damaged any structures and no one was seri
ously injured, but two fire fighters did fall victim
to heat exhaustion.
While the Stanford foothills may appear to
be a cinder box. fires in the area are relatively
uncommon, and the last significant fire in the
area before this summer was in W l )2. Despite
the large gap in time between blazes, however,
several new precautions have been put in place
to ensure the safety of structures and people in
the area surrounding campus.

Over the summer, two fires burned more than 200 acres in the foothills surrounding the Stanford campus. Although the flames did not
cause serious damage, charges may be pressed against two youths responsible for starting the first blaze with matches.
