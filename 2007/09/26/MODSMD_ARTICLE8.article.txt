September 26,
1942: Pi Phi's
Nocturnal
Serenity Upset By
Midnight Prowler
Four engagements in
three days should he
enough for any sorority,
but when you throw in a
midnight burglar to cap
the climax, you have a
wonderful beginning for
the new school year.
Fortunately, their noc
turnal visitor, a soldier on
leave from San Luis Obis
po, was apprehended the
next day, but the Pi Phiss
were given a night they
will not soon forget.
Hearing a strange
noise at two in the morn
ing, Ginny Reagan and
Annie Gallery threw open
their door to investigate.
There stood the modern
version of the barefoot
boy, slightly built, tasteful
ly dressed in green slacks
with a blue tweed coat,
and barefooted.
