September 26,
1942: Pi Phi's
Nocturnal
Serenity Upset By
Midnight Prowler
Four engagements in
three days should he
enough for any sorority,
but when you throw in a
midnight burglar to cap
the climax, you have a
wonderful beginning for
the new school year.
Fortunately, their noc
turnal visitor, a soldier on
leave from San Luis Obis
po, was apprehended the
next day, but the Pi Phiss
were given a night they
will not soon forget.
Hearing a strange
noise at two in the morn
ing, Ginny Reagan and
Annie Gallery threw open
their door to investigate.
There stood the modern
version of the barefoot
boy, slightly built, tasteful
ly dressed in green slacks
with a blue tweed coat,
and barefooted.
higher quality beverages than they
will see anywhere else on campus,"
he said."l am very proud of keeping
a bar that is exciting for drinkers
and non-drinkers alike."
Some students agreed with this
image of the fraternity.
"1 have friends and know some
pretty great people that are current
y members of Phi Kappa Psi," said
Cyrus khajvandi TO in an email to
Fhe Daily."l think they get an unde
serving rap from the campus com
munity, who in part see them as
being antisocial and living the clois
tered life."

Phi Psi does throw a couple of
big parties, like the annual Battle of
the Bands and The Winter of Our
Disco Tent. The fraternity also or
ganizes several academic events,
such as the Looking Ahead Speaker
Series, which attracted a standing
room-only crowd to the Tresidder
Oak Room last year.
Officer said these alternative so
cial gatherings helped Phi Psi win
the national award.
"They looked at what individuals
in the chapter are involved with,
and taking leadership on the cam
puses seemed like a big part of it,"
he said.
According to Officer, when Phi
Psi recruits pledges this year, the
award itself will be less significant
than simply being a good fraternity.
"It's something good to mention.

hut selling the award isn't as impor
tant as selling why we got the
award," he said. "We're not the frat
tiest fraternity on campus, but we're
not trying to attract freshmen who
just want to show up at our house
and drink,either. Like 1 said,joining
Phi Psi is a commitment for life."
The Stanford chapter recently
introduced a six-week pledge peri
od— shorter than many of the
other fraternities on campus, which
often have a pledging period that
carries over from spring to the fol
lowing fall — which was adopted by
the national fraternity as the stan
dard.
"We treat our pledges like full,
active brothers," Officer said.
