## Opinions Editors' Introduction Edit Board members: faceless but enlightening 
### 
Yesterday, we wrote about the oppor
tunities available as a Daily colum
nist. If you prefer not to broadcast
your picture next to every article you write
hut still want to write about issues that ex
cite you,The Daily's editorial board may be
the way to go.
"What is the edit board?" you ask. It's a
group comprised of several people — a
few Daily staffers, the two opinions editors
(i.e., yours truly), and some students (i.e.,
potentially you. dear reader!) who are not
otherwise associated with The Daily. The
Board gets together every week to discuss
issues affecting Stanford campus —
whether it's the Azia Kim scandal, the de
velopment of an environmentally friendly
dorm or the University's crackdown on a
campus party. We adopt our stances based
on a majority vote, then assign Board
members to write a piece based on our dis
cussion. The resulting editorial will be a
detailed, extensively researched piece ex
pressing the Board's opinion while still re
specting counterarguments. All editorials
will be anonymous, to ensure that the arti
cles are collaborations, not merely the
opinions of a single writer.
But there is still room for minority
opinions. If the Board can't reach an
agreement, it will publish two edits re
flecting both sides of the argument. Fur
thermore, if one or two Board members
strongly disagree with the majority, they

can choose to write an opposing editorial
that carries their names.
So what do we expect from you? We're
looking for students who are not only cog
nizant of campus happenings, but can form
eloquent, intelligent opinions about them.
Strong editorial board members are team
players who can work with dissenting opin
ions. Equally important, however, is de
pendability — editorial board members
must commit to writing at least one article a
week, rain or shine.
If this job sounds intriguing and stimulat
ing, you should apply for a position — all
students are welcome! Just send us two sam
ple editorials (600-800 words), 10 potential
edit ideas and a short cover letter which con
tains your contact information and any pre
vious writing experience. Email applications
to opinions@daily.stanford.edu by Friday,
September 28 at 5 p.m. (A little early, we
admit, but we're sure that you've come up
with at least five topics in the time that it
took to read this article!) If you have any
questions, send them to Jackie Bernstein
(jaber@stanford.edu) and In Ho Lee (in
holee@stanford.edu). We're eager to read
your applications and hear about your
ideas!

Jackie Bernstein and In Ho Lee are the opin
ions editors for Volume 232. They can be
reached at jaber@stanford.edu and
