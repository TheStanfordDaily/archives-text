WASHINGTON (AP) —President Bush and
Congress are headed toward another showdown on
war spending, this time sparring over nearly $190 bil
lion the Pentagon says is needed to keep combat in
Iraq afloat for another year.
Sen. Robert Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, vowed Wednesday not to "rubber stamp"
the request and said it was time to put Bush's policies
in check.
"We cannot create a democracy at the point of a gun,"
said Byrd. D-W.Va., whose speech during a Senate
hearing on the spending request was interrupted sev
eral times by cheers of anti-war protesters.

' Sending more guns does not change that reality,"
Byrd said.
Hie tough rhetoric was reminiscent of last spring,
when Congress passed and Bush vetoed a hill funding
the war through September but ordering troop with
drawals to begin by Oct. 1. Democrats still lack the
two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential
veto.
If approved. Congress would have appropriated
more than $760 billion for the two wars, having already
approved of $450 billion for Iraq and $127 billion for
Afghanistan.
Testifying before Byrd's panel. Defense Secretary
Robert Gates acknowledged that America's "difficult
choices" on the war "will continue to be a source of
friction within the Congress, between the Congress
and the president and in the wider public debate."
But Gates said he hoped Congress would approve
money that is needed by the troops.
"Under some of the most trying conditions, they
have done far more than what was asked of them, and
far more than what was expected," he said.
The Pentagon had already requested $147 billion
for the wars; Gates went to Capitol Hill to ask for an
additional $42 billion. The money would pay for the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2008 budget year,
which begins Monday.
Gates said the extni $42 billion was necessary to
buy vehicles that can protect troops against roadside
bombs, refurbish equipment worn down by combat
and consolidate U.S. bases in Iraq.
More specifically, the request includes some $11
billion for 7.000 mine-resistant vehicles.This is in ad
dition to the 8.000 vehicles already planned for field
ing.
Congress has not yet approved any of the money
but was on track this week to pass a stopgap spending
bill that would keep the war afloat for several more
weeks. Tliis gives Democrats, divided on whether to cut
off money for the war, time to figure out their next
step.
Since Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in
Iraq, testified this month. Republicans have said they
are willing to give his strategy more time to work. GOP
members have blocked Democratic bills ordering
troops home.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed its first war-relat
ed bill in months: a nonbinding measure suggesting
Baghdad limit the power of its federal government and
give more control to Iraq's ethnically divided regions.
The White House said it was unbothered by the 75-23
vote because the resolution made clear Bush should
press for a new governing system only if the Iraqis
want it.
"I think the message has been sent to the Iraqi gov
ernment that our military presence is going to — has
begun to — shrink in Iraq, and the expectation of the
commander in the field is that it will continue to
shrink."
