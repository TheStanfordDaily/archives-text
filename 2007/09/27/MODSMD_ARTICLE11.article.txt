## Editorial Board The
						joy of a syllabus 
### 
ripihe Stanford Syllabus site is an excel
lent but underused resource for both
professors and students. Developed
by Academic Computing with the support
of many Stanford administrative depart
ments. this online repository of course syl
labi has generated a fair amount of publici
ty.
Unfortunately, not all professors post
their syllabi on the site ("Few profs share
syllabi," Oct. 23, 2(X)6). We applaud those
faculty members who have already posted
syllabi in time for the start of winter quarter
and urge the rest to take advantage of this
resource.
The syllabus site helps professors and in
structors organize their classes more effec
tively. Having syllabi online could greatly
reduce the amount of chaos that goes on
during the first week of class. Students are
less likely to come into class, pick up a copy
of the syllabus and leave immediately.This is
especially important for professors who
need accurate estimates of enrollment num
bers— estimates that affect decisions like
whether to hire an extra teaching assistant
or schedule extra office hours.
Reducing the amount of chaos during the
shopping period also benefits students.
Being able to view course syllabi online al
lows students to make well-informed choic
es at the start of the quarter. This reduces
overall anxiety, especially for freshmen still
unfamiliar with Stanford academics. This
new online resource may be particularly
helpful for students who have to choose be
tween two or more classes scheduled at the
same time, especially if both classes are
small-group seminars with limited enroll
ment.
Professors should note that they are by
no means obliged to post course materials in
their entirety. Syllabi posted on the site do
not have to be perfectly complete. But even
the most minimal amount of information
posted on the site will help the shopping
process run more smoothly.
At the very least, syllabi should provide
students with a good sense of the workload
required for the class. As such, they should
give an idea of the amount of reading per
week and the number of problem sets, pa
pers. quizzes, midterms, exams and projects.
Professors should also consider including
their grading policies in their syllabi.
Posting a syllabus ahead of time is a good
way to dispense with boring administrative

details. Syllabi can also he used to specify
mundane details, such as how frequently the
class meets and whether there is an optional
section or additional field trips.
With this online system, professors can
easily modify the syllabus at any point, as
more details get confirmed. Moreover, they
can remove any information they don't
want students to access. Post an old syllabus.
Post a draft syllabus. Anything is better than
nothing. Even after the quarter is over, pro
fessors can still post their syllabi online for
future reference.
Professors would benefit from having
students who are more focused and more
likely to have read the syllabus ahead of
time. Students would be better prepared to
ask questions about the course content, in
stead of asking annoying questions about
what books to buy or how many papers they
have to write.
Currently, the Stanford Syllabus site may
duplicate some of the functions available on
Coursework. The new site should be inte
grated with Coursework or Axess, although
this is contingent on the sustained populari
ty of the site.
Until then, professors should post their
syllabi in both places. Some courses are not
open to self-registration on Coursework.
which prevents students from viewing the
syllabus unless they are already enrolled.
Also, students are generally unable to access
syllabi from previous years on Coursework.
No class should be exempt from posting its
syllabus online — neither large introducto
ry classes like IHUM, Math 51, Econ 1A or
the Biology core, nor obscure classes of
fered by boutique departments.
We recognize the hidden potential in this
Web site and hope that it will develop into a
valuable repository of information for fu
ture students. This quarter, students should
ask their professors to post their syllabi on
line, and we would be especially grateful if
professors would be willing to spend the
weekend scouring their hard drives for old
syllabi.

This editorial was first published on Jan. 11,
2007. Since its original publication, hundreds
of new syllabi — including ones for such core
courses as Econ 1A and the biology core —
have been posted.
