## An open letter to my theoretical son 
### 
Dear Felix,
You're my son and I'm your father
when he was 22. I'm writing from
September 27.2007. I'm in a rut,son.
I graduated Stanford with a degree in film
studies, which is sexier than English and
twice as unemployable. I'm living at your
grandparents' house and commuting up to
SF for a job that pays in experience and fills
a bank account about as much as sunshine
and smiles. I am almost purposefully un
healthy, staying up too late every night, eat
ing all the wrong foods, drinking all the
wrong alcohol. I can't imagine a future past
next week, let alone keep my room clean.
If you're reading this, then that's all in the
past.
I'd like to think that we're a big happy
family, living in a big house in a safe part of
a dangerous city, and besides you there's two
boys, Finnegan and Figo, and two girls. Flora
and Federica. But I'm old enough to know
I'm not mature enough to go through life
without two divorces, a bastard child, an
eviction notice and some kind of addiction.
Not like I don't plan on living a long and
happy life. I just know I'm too dumb to ever
be content. I probably ended up marrying
the wrong girl, which could be why our mar
riage didn't last, or why it did. In all likeli
hood, you're going to rebel against every
thing I stand for. You'll probably want to be
a lawyer, like your grandpa and your uncle.
I never knew anyone at college who
talked about children. It's a taboo topic, like
cocaine and trust funds. Even the crazy
Christian girls who wore engagement rings
to graduation were getting jobs. You could
say I come from a certain kind of America
— coastal intellectual liberal fop — but
your grandpa came out of Stanford, too, and
when he graduated, half his friends were en
gaged or married or living with the people
they'd swap rings and divorce papers with.
Adulthood, building a family, watching a lit
tle clump of your genetic material learn to
walk and talk and whine — these were
things people thought about back then. Not
so much. now. Or at least, not for a while. It's
already a problem over in Europe — plenty
of people just don't want to have babies, re

belling against the natural instinct to pass
our bloodline along, defeating evolution
with planned unparenthood.
So there's a good chance that you don't
even exist and I'm writing this to my imagi
nary' friend who lives in the ether. Even if I
do have kids, the world could go all Cormac
McCarthy on us before you get the chance
to read this. But if you do exist, then this is
the future and the Internet has only gotten
bigger and cooler. So maybe someday, when
you're 11 or 12. you'll type my name into a
search engine, or zap my name into the com
puter chip in your brain, or whatever kids
are doing in the 20305.
You'll find a bunch of articles I wrote when
I was in college.These articles will effective
ly destroy any chance I had of assuming any
moral high ground, since I reference all
manner of chemical, sexual, criminal and
political depravity. It will warm my heart
when I try to discipline you for smoking
weed and you say,"But Dad. I just wanted to
be more like you." I won't show it, but I'll be
touched. Then your mom will ground you
and yell at me.
Your boring present is my impossible future,
Felix. Am I a successful writer, with critical
praise, bestsellers, movie deals, Pulitzer
prizes and a roguishly handsome picture on
the cover of Vanity Fair, shot by Annie Lei
bovitz? And if I'm successful, does that
make it more or less likely that you're the
product of a happy marital coupling or the
little unlucky miracle that shotgunned me
into a loveless marriage?
Hopefully it's the first one, but hey. don't
worry: penicillin was a mistake, too.

If Darren Franich ha* a daughter who is read
ing this in the 20305, he would like to give her
two special messages: That dress is too reveal
ing, and go ask your mother. Email him at
