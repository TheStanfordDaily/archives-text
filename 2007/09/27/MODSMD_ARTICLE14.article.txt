Stanford women's golf completed
competition at the NCAA Preview yes
terday coming in 17th place out of 18
teams at the tournament held in Albu
querque. N.M.
The Cardinal shot a combined 46-over
(922) for the tournament, finishing behind
the likes of Duke, USC, UCLA, Arizona
State and Vanderbilt, who rounded out
the top five. The Blue Devils took home
the title with an aggregate score of 16-
under (860), edging USC by a single
stroke.
Junior Mari Chun finished in a tie for
26th place individually with a three-over
par (222). Sophomore Catherina Wang
was the second best Cardinal golfer, fin
ishing with a nine-over (228). putting her
in 58th place. Freshmen Rebecca Durham
and Piper Miller finished in 68th and 83rd,
respectively in their first collegiate tour
nament. Junior Ki-Shui Liao rounded out
the Cardinal five, coming in 88th place in
dividually
While the Cardinal did not necessarily
finish where it would have liked, the tour
nament provided some much-needed ex
perience for a young team that lacks a sin
gle senior in its lineup. ITie NCAA pre
view featured some of the best programs
in the country and was held on one of the
nation's toughest courses — the very
same track where the NCAA champi
onships will be held in May.
"It's one of the best fields we'll see,"
coach Caroline O'Connor said. "These

are definitely the best teams in the coun
try from the East. Central and West re
gions. These are the teams that we'll see at
the national championship. For all intents
and purposes, it's just another tournament
— it just happens to be the best in terms of
field and teams."
With its newfound experience, the Car
dinal will have a chance to fine-tune its
game in the next two weeks. The team is
off until the Edean lhlanfeldt Invitation
al. which starts on Oct. 8.
