# Andrew Kartunen Men's Soccer
## Senior overcomes injury to lead Cardinal 
### BY HALEY MURPHY 
M hey say that the best goal-
J/j£ keepers are the ones with
the most experience," Stan
ford men's soccer goalie
Andrew Kartunen said.
"And 1 like to think that I've experienced a lot
to this point in my life at my position."
Anyone who is familiar with the redshirt
senior's career can hardly argue. Kartunen
started kicking a soccer ball against the garage
with his brother at age four and was named to
the US. National Team for the first time 10
years later. He still wears number 18 — the
number issued to him for his debut on the in
ternational stage — but the lingering influ
ences of World Cup play are apparent in more
than the number on his jersey.
"Playing with the national team has always
been an invaluable experience for me," Kar
tunen said. "It's an honor to represent your

country, especially in a World Cup, no matter
the level. Playing at the international level
forces you to limit your mistakes and concen
trate every time you step out on the field. It re
ally taught me how to be a professional, both
on and off the field, and 1 enjoy every minute
of being a part of it."
Maintaining professionalism became easi
er said than done for Kartunen in 2006. when
his would-be senior season was halted by in
jury. Coach Bret Simon knows that few players
share the dedication and poise displayed by
Kartunen in his efforts to return to the game.
"Andrew has had a bumpy road due to in
juries [which] have been doubly difficult in
that they've not only forced him to take time
off from playing in goal, but have also [forced]
him to take time off from school," Simon said.
"So he's had some huge hurdles to overcome
to get back on the field. 1 really admire and ap
preciate the efforts he's made."
After spending a year recovering, Kar-

"I feel lucky to be playing again...To me, it's an accom
plishment in itself to be back playing for Stanford"

tunen has entered the 2007 season with a
deepened sense of excitement and passion for
the game.
"The past 18 months of injuries were a dif
ficult process, and there were points when I
doubted even returning to [playj." he said. "1
feel lucky to be playing again, and even lucki
er to be playing at a high level.To me, it's an ac
complishment in itself to be back playing for
Stanford, and that's really what drives me and
excites me about my final season here."
During the 18-month recovery period,
Simon also saw Kartunen establish himself as

a team leader through his role as an elected tri
captain.
"Through this difficult time Andrew has
developed personally," Simon observed. "He's
come to demand more of himself and ask
more of his teammates, and he's been a good
mentor to our younger goalkeepers, who all
have great physical abilities but need to learn
the nuances of the game. I le's not naturally ex
troverted. but he's grown into an on-the-field
vocal leader."
Kartunen. though, considers his habit of
calling instructions to his teammates a necessi
ty for his position.
"[As a] goalkeeper, I'm the only one on the
field that's able to see everything," he noted.
"It's my responsibility to stay engaged and di
rect my teammates to make my own job easi
er. If I can put my teammates in the right spots,
then that means that I might not have to make
as many saves. Communicating with and moti
vating my teammates is something I've been
taught and always have tried to do."
With just one game before the start of Pac
-10 play. Kartunen is intent on not looking too
far ahead in the team's future.
"I'm in the mind-set of dealing with each
day as it comes," he said. "(Hut) we have the
talent to be as successful as the 2(X)2 team [the
last Cardinal team included in the NCAA Col
lege Cup], so we just need to continue to im
prove as the season progresses [and] limit our
mistakes in games. I think if you ask anyone on
the team, not only do they want to make it to
the NCAA tournament, but they want to win
games in the NCAA tournament as well."
In order to get to the tournament, the 3-2-2
Stanford team will need to perform well
against tough Pac-10 opponents like No. 17
UCLA, No. 22 Cal and No. 24 Washington.
Kartunen believes that the ('ardinal is capable
of competing with the best.
"I imagine that the Pac-10 will be very even
this year and will ultimately be up for grabs,"
he said. "If we can play with a lot of heart and
energy and remain focused for l X) minutes,
then we can win the Pac-10. Our challenge will
be to bring that to every game we play for the
rest of the regular season."
With 20 saves on the season, and a steady
stream of instructions spewed from between
the posts, Kartunen is on the way to helping
Stanford do just that.
