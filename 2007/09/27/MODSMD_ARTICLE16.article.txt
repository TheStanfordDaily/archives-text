# Don't mess with the West
## 
### 
Go anywhere outside the West
Coast and you'll find that the
Pac-1() isn't too hot when it
comes to football.
Year after year, opposing confer
ences, coaches and players lament
USC's easy schedule on the weak
and laid-back West Coast, forgetting
that the Trojans have run over SEC,
Big 12 and Big Ten teams nearly
every chance they've had (well, save
for Vince Young anil Co. in 2006).
Just look at what LSU head coach
Les Miles had to say before this sea
son even started.
"1 can tell you this, that they have
a much easier road to travel." Miles
said of the Trojans. "They're going to
play real knock-down drag-outs with
UCLA and Washington, Cal-Berke
ley, Stanford — some real jugger
nauts — and they're going to end up,
it would be my guess, in some posi
tion so if they win a game or two, that
they'll end up in the title [game].
"1 would like that path for us. I
think the SEC provides much stiffer
competition."
I find it funny that Miles called
out a team like Cal — the very same
team that put up 45 on the vaunted
Tennessee Volunteers, who happen
to play in the very same conference
that LSU competes in.
But enough of the verbal Hinging.
Let's just look at the facts.
In 2003, the Trojans crushed Big
Ten champ lowa 38-17 in the Orange
Bowl. In 2004, they claimed a split of
the national championship after
beating Big Ten champ Michigan 28-
14 in a game that wasn't as close as
the score indicates. In 2005, they hu
miliated the Big 12's Oklahoma 55-
1 ( ) in a game many thought USC did
n't deserve to be in because of their
"easy" Pac-10 schedule. The Trojans
lost to Texas in 2006 in a classic that
we all remember, but went right back
to their easy winning ways last year
after dominating highly touted
Michigan in the 2007 Rose Bowl.
I think Miles has things mixed up.
Apparently, the "real knock-down
drag-outs" that he mockingly speaks
of take place against USC's BCS op
ponents. At least the facts suggest so.
In th ese five yea rs.fi i>e of th e Troj a ns'
six total losses came to teams in the
Pac-10.
The biggest indictment against
the Pac-10 is that the conference
plays no defense. During last Satur
day's conference play, the winners of
each of the games scored at least 44
points. The lowest score for all 10
teams was 27 points. So it would
seem that our defenses really are that
bad. But maybe our offenses are just
that good.
The greatest testament that the
conference is more about the offens
es being good than the defenses
being bad has to come from non-con
ference action, however.
So let's take a look at the greatest
indicators: the premier games that
Pac-10 teams have played so far this
year.
Oregon put up 39 against defen
sive machine Michigan, USC scored
a cool 49 against the Big 12's Nebras
ka and Cal had no trouble dropping
45 on Tennessee, a team that rarely
gives up more than 30.
Notice a pattern?
The simple fact is that the Pac-10
is a quarterback's conference, an of
fensive coordinator's haven, a wide
receiver's dream. Whether it's the
spread-option offense, the West
Coast offense or multiple hybrids of
both, Pac-10 offenses are more so
phisticated. exciting and productive
than those of any other conference.
You may think that the defenses
are weak, and that's true to an extent.
But it's not as simple as that.
Pac-10 football is about a philoso
phy. a style of play that a lot of fans
and coaches just don't seem to un
derstand. It's a philosophy rooted in
the mind of Stanford's late and great
Bill Walsh: the notion that running
the football doesn't always come
first. Pac-10 football is more than just
a way of diagramming plays and con
cocting schemes; it's a way of life.
