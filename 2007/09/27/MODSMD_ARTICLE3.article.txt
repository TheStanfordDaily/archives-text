# Fellow faces Senate test
## Critics block Evers' appointment to key D.C. education post, others support Hoover scholar 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Hoover Fellow Williamson
Evers was nominated in February by
President George W. Bush to be assis
tant secretary of education for plan
ning, evaluation and policy develop
ment he hardly could have expected
such a protracted l ight for his confirma
tion.
The controversial Evers B.A. '72,
M.A. '76, and Ph.D. '87, a specialist in
education, currently sits behind a desk
in Washington at the Department of
Education, where he is a Senior Advi
sor to Secretary of Education Margaret
Spellings.
Now, roughly eight months after he
received the nomination, a drawn-out
confirmation saga rumbles on as the
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Ed
ucation. Labor and Pensions and its De
mocratic majority refuse to move for
ward.
Accusations of Evers' insufficient

credentials, misuse of statistics and a
lack of professionalism — he reported
ly once made physical threats during a
policy-related discussion — have inun
dated the Senate committee, while his
supporters have trumpeted Evers'
courage and dismiss the allegations as
ad honiinem attacks from bitter foes.
"Bill is an accomplished academic
with extensive credentials and experi
ence studying and writing about educa
tion policy issues." Spellings said in a
statement. "His focus on developing
policy that is proven effective by scien
tifically based research will make him a
valuable asset to the Department and
students and families across the coun
try. I hope the Senate will move quickly
to confirm Hill so he can hit the ground
running in this important role."
Political Science Prof, and Hoover
Fellow Terry Moe said the post will re
main empty until 2009 unless Bush by
passes the Senate and appoints Evers
during a Congressional recess.
Known as a politically active un
dergraduate who often protested on
campus. Evers was heavily involved
in the Libertarian party after gradu
ation and became editor of Inquiry
Magazine, a publication of the Lib
ertarian-leaning Cato Institute.
Evers gained renown — and his
noxious reputation — during the
19905, when California was overrun
by the "Math Wars," a bitter dispute
among educators over whether sub
jects like math and science should
emphasize a more intuitive, hands
on approach or rote memorization.
When he protested a progressive
1992 California curriculum frame
work that called for practices like
group learning. Evers won the atten
tion of the media. The Hoover Fel
low — whose children went to
school in the Palo Alto School Dis
trict at the time — staged a 1994
media stunt in which he drove to
school district offices in a truck with
a toilet mounted in the bed so he
could "flush" copies of the frame
work document.
Evers' vociferous involvement in
the debate vaulted him to interna

tional renown and California Gov
ernor Pete Wilson appointed him to
a commission to evaluate education
standards in the late 19905. It was
during this period that Evers made
the enemies that now haunt his nom
ination.
Delaine Eastin, former superin
tendent of California public schools,
said both Democrats and Republi
cans on Evers' committee struggled
to work alongside him.
"He would talk constantly, and
when he wasn't talking to the group
he would talk to the person next to
him or whoever would listen." Eastin
recalled. "He really does pretend to
know much more about teaching
children than he really does know,
and. as a result,he tends to be rude to
people who are on the cutting edge
of educating children. He dismisses
people who are educators in the K
-12 system, he dismisses people who
are teaching in higher education."
Eastin said that many educators
have similar feelings about Evers
but are afraid to speak out publicly.
The result is a cloud of mystery sur
rounding the origins of the attacks
on an increasingly frustrated Evers.
who said he could not speak to re
porters while he awaits his confir
mation.
"What's inexcusable isn't the ex
istence of opponents," said Charles
Finn, Jr., a Hoover Fellow and

prominent conservative education
guru, in an email to The Daily. "It's
the Senate's procedural dithering
and the critics who, via innuendo,
whisper and back-stab and seek to
'bork' Evers without ever looking at
him — or Chairman [Ted] Kennedy
|l)M . \| in the eye."
Earlier this week, The Daily ob
tained an unpublished 36-page re
port, authored in late March and
presented to the Senate committee.
The document extensively de
scribed Evers' "insufficient creden
tials." "disregard for evidence,"
"misuse of statistics" and "unprofes
sional behavior." Several of the re
port's authors are believed to be
Evers' opponents from the 1990s
dispute in California.
The report indicated that a CSU-
San Bernardino professor "stated in
an interview that Evers confronted
her one day and told her not only
that she needed to obey him but also
communicated what she understood
to be a physical threat, man to
woman, if she chose to work for the
[Standards] commission."
The unpublished document also
stated that Evers would walk away
from his seat at the table and talk
with his supporters in the audience
whenever a Standards commission
member with opposing opinions tes
tified. The list of his alleged trans
gressions continued at length.

Some critics argue that Evers,
who campaigned for Bush in 2000
and helped define the president's
education policy, is the latest bene
factor of Bush's rash of cronyism.
But given his Bay Area. Libertarian
background. Evers would seem to
be an outsider, if anything. Indeed,
Bush had the power to appoint
Evers to the post without a confir
mation during the summer Congres
sional recess, but chose not to.
"Evers doesn't come out [of the]
same background as Bush, and this
guy isn't your traditional neocon,"
said Michael Klonsky, a liberal edu
cation blogger who heads the Small
Schools Workshop in Chicago and
was a member of President Bill Clin
ton's Advisory Panel on School Vio
lence. "Evers isn't a Texas conserva
tive. He's more of a think tank guy,
an ideologue without any real quali
fications to make education policy.
He'll fit right in with the bureaucra
cy, but 1 think it's a bone thrown at
the Cato Institute."
The unpublished report held a
different view: "Mr. Evers' record of
repositioning his views to advance
his career do not reflect well on his
capacity for principled, sound judg
ment, an essential skill for the de
manding position of responsibility
he now seeks."
Evers' opponents often say he has
no place whatsoever in education

policy despite his numerous books
on education as well as contribu
tions to the op-ed pages of publica
tions such as the Education Week,
The Wall Street Journal and The
New York l imes.
"He's interested in politics, and
he's not an educator," said an Oak
land-based education insider who
has been frequently quoted in edu
cation publications and was granted
anonymity given the sensitivity of
the nomination process. "He has a
Ph.D. in political science. He likes to
use the position to do something po
litical. Look at everything that he
has published. This is about him get
ting to the microphone."
But former governor Wilson, the
California commissioner for the Es
tablishment of Academic and Perfor
mance Standards, the Santa Clara
County Superintendent of Schools,
numerous Stanford faculty and vari
ous parents and community mem
bers have rallied behind the man who
they say is particularly committed to
improving inner-city education.
"Tempers flared on both sides
during the math debate," said
Mandy Lowell, a Palo Alto parent
and school district board member
during the 19905. "People on both
sides were hot-tempered and attack
ing the person rather than the posi
tion. I wouldn't want to judge any
body on how they behaved in the

Math Wars."
In an attempt to refute claims of
Evers' unwillingness to listen, Low
ell said Evers was the first Santa
Clara County school hoard member
in over a decade to visit the district
school boards during his tenure to
explain the goings-on at the county
level and to actively seek input.
"I don't think the Bill Evers 1 saw
during the Math Wars is the same
Bill Evers five years later," Lowell
said. "He's learned to be a less ag
gressive advocate."
R. James Milgram, a professor of
mathematics, said that the Math De
partment was "right with Bill Evers"
through the debate. He added that
Evers is "extremely sensible" and
that "when he sees things that are
obviously wrong, he reacts."
Milgram, who is a member of the
NASA Advisory Council, rebuffed
claims that Evers is not qualified.
"Look at my own situation," he
said. "I'm a mathematician, but I'm
sitting on this NASA council. It
doesn't come from my degree. It
comes from my hobby, a hobby that
I do well."
Despite President Clinton's plea
for "politics to stop at the school
house door," Evers' saga has per
haps proved that little has changed.

of educating children. He dismisses
people who are educators in the K
-12 system, he dismisses people who
are teaching in higher education."
Eastin said that many educators
have similar feelings about Evers
but are afraid to speak out publicly.
The result is a cloud of mystery sur
rounding the origins of the attacks
on an increasingly frustrated Evers.
who said he could not speak to re
porters while he awaits his confir
mation.
"What's inexcusable isn't the ex
istence of opponents," said Charles
Finn, Jr., a Hoover Fellow and

prominent conservative education
guru, in an email to The Daily. "It's
the Senate's procedural dithering
and the critics who, via innuendo,
whisper and back-stab and seek to
'bork' Evers without ever looking at
him — or Chairman [Ted] Kennedy
|l)M . \| in the eye."
Earlier this week, The Daily ob
tained an unpublished 36-page re
port, authored in late March and
presented to the Senate committee.
The document extensively de
scribed Evers' "insufficient creden
tials." "disregard for evidence,"
"misuse of statistics" and "unprofes
sional behavior." Several of the re
port's authors are believed to be
Evers' opponents from the 1990s
dispute in California.
The report indicated that a CSU-
San Bernardino professor "stated in
an interview that Evers confronted
her one day and told her not only
that she needed to obey him but also
communicated what she understood
to be a physical threat, man to
woman, if she chose to work for the
[Standards] commission."
The unpublished document also
stated that Evers would walk away
from his seat at the table and talk
with his supporters in the audience
whenever a Standards commission
member with opposing opinions tes
tified. The list of his alleged trans
gressions continued at length.

Some critics argue that Evers,
who campaigned for Bush in 2000
and helped define the president's
education policy, is the latest bene
factor of Bush's rash of cronyism.
But given his Bay Area. Libertarian
background. Evers would seem to
be an outsider, if anything. Indeed,
Bush had the power to appoint
Evers to the post without a confir
mation during the summer Congres
sional recess, but chose not to.
"Evers doesn't come out [of the]
same background as Bush, and this
guy isn't your traditional neocon,"
said Michael Klonsky, a liberal edu
cation blogger who heads the Small
Schools Workshop in Chicago and
was a member of President Bill Clin
ton's Advisory Panel on School Vio
lence. "Evers isn't a Texas conserva
tive. He's more of a think tank guy,
an ideologue without any real quali
fications to make education policy.
He'll fit right in with the bureaucra
cy, but 1 think it's a bone thrown at
the Cato Institute."
The unpublished report held a
different view: "Mr. Evers' record of
repositioning his views to advance
his career do not reflect well on his
capacity for principled, sound judg
ment, an essential skill for the de
manding position of responsibility
he now seeks."
Evers' opponents often say he has
no place whatsoever in education

policy despite his numerous books
on education as well as contribu
tions to the op-ed pages of publica
tions such as the Education Week,
The Wall Street Journal and The
New York l imes.
"He's interested in politics, and
he's not an educator," said an Oak
land-based education insider who
has been frequently quoted in edu
cation publications and was granted
anonymity given the sensitivity of
the nomination process. "He has a
Ph.D. in political science. He likes to
use the position to do something po
litical. Look at everything that he
has published. This is about him get
ting to the microphone."
But former governor Wilson, the
California commissioner for the Es
tablishment of Academic and Perfor
mance Standards, the Santa Clara
County Superintendent of Schools,
numerous Stanford faculty and vari
ous parents and community mem
bers have rallied behind the man who
they say is particularly committed to
improving inner-city education.
"Tempers flared on both sides
during the math debate," said
Mandy Lowell, a Palo Alto parent
and school district board member
during the 19905. "People on both
sides were hot-tempered and attack
ing the person rather than the posi
tion. I wouldn't want to judge any
body on how they behaved in the

Math Wars."
In an attempt to refute claims of
Evers' unwillingness to listen, Low
ell said Evers was the first Santa
Clara County school hoard member
in over a decade to visit the district
school boards during his tenure to
explain the goings-on at the county
level and to actively seek input.
"I don't think the Bill Evers 1 saw
during the Math Wars is the same
Bill Evers five years later," Lowell
said. "He's learned to be a less ag
gressive advocate."
R. James Milgram, a professor of
mathematics, said that the Math De
partment was "right with Bill Evers"
through the debate. He added that
Evers is "extremely sensible" and
that "when he sees things that are
obviously wrong, he reacts."
Milgram, who is a member of the
NASA Advisory Council, rebuffed
claims that Evers is not qualified.
"Look at my own situation," he
said. "I'm a mathematician, but I'm
sitting on this NASA council. It
doesn't come from my degree. It
comes from my hobby, a hobby that
I do well."
Despite President Clinton's plea
for "politics to stop at the school
house door," Evers' saga has per
haps proved that little has changed.

When Hoover Fellow Williamson
Evers was nominated in February by
President George W. Bush to be assis
tant secretary of education for plan
ning, evaluation and policy develop
ment he hardly could have expected
such a protracted l ight for his confirma
tion.
The controversial Evers B.A. '72,
M.A. '76, and Ph.D. '87, a specialist in
education, currently sits behind a desk
in Washington at the Department of
Education, where he is a Senior Advi
sor to Secretary of Education Margaret
Spellings.
Now, roughly eight months after he
received the nomination, a drawn-out
confirmation saga rumbles on as the
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Ed
ucation. Labor and Pensions and its De
mocratic majority refuse to move for
ward.
Accusations of Evers' insufficient

credentials, misuse of statistics and a
lack of professionalism — he reported
ly once made physical threats during a
policy-related discussion — have inun
dated the Senate committee, while his
supporters have trumpeted Evers'
courage and dismiss the allegations as
ad honiinem attacks from bitter foes.
"Bill is an accomplished academic
with extensive credentials and experi
ence studying and writing about educa
tion policy issues." Spellings said in a
statement. "His focus on developing
policy that is proven effective by scien
tifically based research will make him a
valuable asset to the Department and
students and families across the coun
try. I hope the Senate will move quickly
to confirm Hill so he can hit the ground
running in this important role."
Political Science Prof, and Hoover
Fellow Terry Moe said the post will re
main empty until 2009 unless Bush by
passes the Senate and appoints Evers
during a Congressional recess.
Known as a politically active un
dergraduate who often protested on
campus. Evers was heavily involved
in the Libertarian party after gradu
ation and became editor of Inquiry
Magazine, a publication of the Lib
ertarian-leaning Cato Institute.
Evers gained renown — and his
noxious reputation — during the
19905, when California was overrun
by the "Math Wars," a bitter dispute
among educators over whether sub
jects like math and science should
emphasize a more intuitive, hands
on approach or rote memorization.
When he protested a progressive
1992 California curriculum frame
work that called for practices like
group learning. Evers won the atten
tion of the media. The Hoover Fel
low — whose children went to
school in the Palo Alto School Dis
trict at the time — staged a 1994
media stunt in which he drove to
school district offices in a truck with
a toilet mounted in the bed so he
could "flush" copies of the frame
work document.
Evers' vociferous involvement in
the debate vaulted him to interna

tional renown and California Gov
ernor Pete Wilson appointed him to
a commission to evaluate education
standards in the late 19905. It was
during this period that Evers made
the enemies that now haunt his nom
ination.
Delaine Eastin, former superin
tendent of California public schools,
said both Democrats and Republi
cans on Evers' committee struggled
to work alongside him.
"He would talk constantly, and
when he wasn't talking to the group
he would talk to the person next to
him or whoever would listen." Eastin
recalled. "He really does pretend to
know much more about teaching
children than he really does know,
and. as a result,he tends to be rude to
people who are on the cutting edge
of educating children. He dismisses
people who are educators in the K
-12 system, he dismisses people who
are teaching in higher education."
