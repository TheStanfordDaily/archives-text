# Fellow faces Senate test
## Critics block Evers' appointment to key D.C. education post, others support Hoover scholar 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Hoover Fellow Williamson
Evers was nominated in February by
President George W. Bush to be assis
tant secretary of education for plan
ning, evaluation and policy develop
ment he hardly could have expected
such a protracted l ight for his confirma
tion.
The controversial Evers B.A. '72,
M.A. '76, and Ph.D. '87, a specialist in
education, currently sits behind a desk
in Washington at the Department of
Education, where he is a Senior Advi
sor to Secretary of Education Margaret
Spellings.
Now, roughly eight months after he
received the nomination, a drawn-out
confirmation saga rumbles on as the
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Ed
ucation. Labor and Pensions and its De
mocratic majority refuse to move for
ward.
Accusations of Evers' insufficient

credentials, misuse of statistics and a
lack of professionalism — he reported
ly once made physical threats during a
policy-related discussion — have inun
dated the Senate committee, while his
supporters have trumpeted Evers'
courage and dismiss the allegations as
ad honiinem attacks from bitter foes.
"Bill is an accomplished academic
with extensive credentials and experi
ence studying and writing about educa
tion policy issues." Spellings said in a
statement. "His focus on developing
policy that is proven effective by scien
tifically based research will make him a
valuable asset to the Department and
students and families across the coun
try. I hope the Senate will move quickly
to confirm Hill so he can hit the ground
running in this important role."
Political Science Prof, and Hoover
Fellow Terry Moe said the post will re
main empty until 2009 unless Bush by
passes the Senate and appoints Evers
