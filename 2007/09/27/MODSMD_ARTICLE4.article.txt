### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Solar Car team is gearing up for the
semiannual World Solar Challenge in Australia next
month, scrambling to put the finishing touches on its
new vehicle before the competition begins in late Oc
tober.
From Oct. 21 through Oct. 28, cars entered in the
competition will travel from Darwin on the country's
northern coast to the southern city of Adelaide â€” a
journey of roughly 1,900 miles.
The last time Stanford entered the World Solar
Challenge was in 1995. when the team finished fifth.
This year's team hopes its car, named Equinox, will
improve on that showing.
Two nights before Equinox was scheduled to be
shipped to Australia, however, it fell victim to some
major mechanical failures.
