## Solar car team races to meet Oct. deadline Group prepares for Australia competition with focus on reliability 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Solar Car team is gearing up for the
semiannual World Solar Challenge in Australia next
month, scrambling to put the finishing touches on its
new vehicle before the competition begins in late Oc
tober.
From Oct. 21 through Oct. 28, cars entered in the
competition will travel from Darwin on the country's
northern coast to the southern city of Adelaide — a
journey of roughly 1,900 miles.
The last time Stanford entered the World Solar
Challenge was in 1995. when the team finished fifth.
This year's team hopes its car, named Equinox, will
improve on that showing.
Two nights before Equinox was scheduled to be
shipped to Australia, however, it fell victim to some
major mechanical failures.
"For example, the wheel that the
motor was mounted to, that entire
panel delaminated off the body of
the car," said Sasha Zbrozek '10.
"We made all the necessary fixes to
the car so that the panel would stay
on, but that meant we had less time
to test the car."
The team will arrive in Australia
a couple of weeks prior to the com
petition to iron out any last-minute
flaws in the design.
"There's never ample time,"
Zbrozek said. "But just having time
at all is a good thing."
The Equinox is a new and im
proved version of its predecessors.
The addition of a high-end solar
array to the car's arsenal will im
prove its performance. The new gal
lium arsenide solar array is capable
of converting the sun's energy into
electrical energy at 27 percent effi
ciency — top-of-the-line solar pan
els sold in the consumer market can
only convert solar energy at 20 per
cent efficiency.
Facing a talented field, the Stan
ford team knows it must avoid being
forced to repair Equinox if it is to
have a chance at winning the compe
tition.
"The thing that determined who
won the North American race in
2005 was how much of the race you
were moving," said Eric Ellenof 1 09.
Zbrozek said the team wanted to
strike a balance between efficiency
and reliability as it manufactured
the car.
The predecessor to Equinox was
named Solstice, which took home
first place in its division at the 2005
North American Solar Challenge.
Ellenof said the team's names for
Equinox and Solstice were borne
from a preventative mindset.
"In the past, Stanford solar cars
tended to have the word 'burner' in
[their] name," he said. "The trouble
was. every previous car with the
name 'burner' in it caught fire and
burned. So with Solstice and
Equinox there was a conscious deci
sion that we were going to stop using
that term in the cars' names."
