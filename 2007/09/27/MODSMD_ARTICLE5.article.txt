## GSC shuts down Comedy Club Group's $8,000 budget cut to $2,480 by last night's Council vote 
### SUSANA MONTES 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) denied
$8,000 of funding — the maximum amount of
money the Council gives to a graduate student or
ganization — to the Comedy Club at its first meet
ing of the year last night.
The Comedy Club planned to showcase 30 com
edy events during the 2007-2008 academic year with
the money petitioned, but the GSC only approved
$2,480 for the group—money which will come
from the graduate student general fee.
"This is the normal amount we give to student
groups," said Kristina Keating, a
doctoral student in the School of
Earth Sciences and co-chair of the
Council.
According to Melahn Parker,
co-founder of the Comedy Club,
the group requested $8,000 in order
to bring professional comics who
have TV credits and national recog
nition to campus.
"We have to pay them [comics]
something — these guys are pro
fessionals," Parker said. "The

comics we have had since January
2006 are good, and some have even
performed for free. But the head
liners are usually paid $500 a show.
They are professionals and do
this for a living. This is a decent
pay."
According to GSC parliamen
tarian Adam Beberg, graduate stu
dent organizations are given a "big
bonus" when they start off, but are
expected "to kind of draw into and
to work with the Concert Network,
or with the Speakers Bureau to get
more monetary support."
"The Comedy Club has been the
best use of GSC funds ever," Park
er said. "It has benefited the most
people at the lowest cost, and I'm

incredibly disappointed that the
Council no longer wishes to sup
port the club as it has before."
But Beberg argued that the GSC
doesn't approve funding based on
the number of students listed on a
group mailing list.
"For a group of this [small] size,
this is way beyond [what] we have
ever done," he said.
Parker said the club has around
350 members.
The Comedy Club has hosted 59
shows since January 2006. The
events are held on Tuesdays at 9
p.m. at The 750.
