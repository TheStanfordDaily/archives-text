## Study finds increase in dorm fires 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
While the old campus firehouse is now
home to some student groups, a history of
dorm fires at the University and a nation
wide surge in residential blazes suggest that
fire prevention is more important now than
ever.
According to the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA), the estimated number
of fires occurring in campus housing across
the nation has increased substantially since a
low of 1,800 fires was recorded in 1998.
In 2005, an estimated 3,300 fires blazed in
college dormitories, and campus fires result
ed in 39 deaths and close to 400 injuries on
campuses between 2000 and 2005. According
to the NFPA. in-room cooking is responsible
for 72 percent of these fires.

While campus fires nationwide have in
creased in recent years, the incidence of large
fires has not increased at Stanford.
"Stanford has been fortunate that it has
had very few major fires over the years," said
Associate Director of Student Housing Imo
gen Hinds. "To our knowledge, no students
have been injured in fires (in the past few
years]."
She added that smaller fires have been
caused by candles, halogen lamps and other
"now prohibited items," in addition to fires
caused by unattended cooking in student
apartments. In August, an Escondido Village
apartment fire was thought to have been
started by electrical cords.
But the University has had its share of
major fires in the past.
The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house
was destroyed by a fire in 1960, and a faulty

electrical cord caused a
major fire in Storey in 1980. In 1991
the Delta Tau Delta
house was destroyed in what-IH
appeared to he an arson fire.
Hinds said that fire safety has]
always been important at Stan-'
ford.

"From 1898 to 1976, students
formed part of the fire force at

Stanford until the City of
Palo Alto assumed con-^^

trol of the campus fire
department," she said, j

bunkhouse at the old Fire Truck
House on Santa Teresa Street and
later at the new fire station on Serra
Street."
Though the student firefighting
team no longer exists. Hinds told
The Daily that increasing fire safe
ty is important to the University.
All campus residences and apart
ments have smoke detectors, and
all undergraduate residences ex
cept Wilbur Hall are equipped with
sprinklers â€” which will be in

stalled in Wilbur in 2009.
The University takes a number
of precautions to reduce the fire
risk in campus housing, including
mandating quarterly fire drills,
fines for flammable materials in
dorm rooms and fire-retardant re
quirements for party decorations.
Hinds suggested ways in which
students can do their part to reduce
fires on campus. She recommended
that students locate the exits clos
est to their dorm rooms, keep hall
ways clear in order to have a fast es
cape path and use fire-safe exten
sion cords.
