## Study finds increase in dorm fires 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
While the old campus firehouse is now
home to some student groups, a history of
dorm fires at the University and a nation
wide surge in residential blazes suggest that
fire prevention is more important now than
ever.
According to the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA), the estimated number
of fires occurring in campus housing across
the nation has increased substantially since a
low of 1,800 fires was recorded in 1998.
In 2005, an estimated 3,300 fires blazed in
college dormitories, and campus fires result
ed in 39 deaths and close to 400 injuries on
campuses between 2000 and 2005. According
to the NFPA. in-room cooking is responsible
for 72 percent of these fires.

While campus fires nationwide have in
creased in recent years, the incidence of large
fires has not increased at Stanford.
"Stanford has been fortunate that it has
had very few major fires over the years," said
Associate Director of Student Housing Imo
gen Hinds. "To our knowledge, no students
have been injured in fires (in the past few
years]."
She added that smaller fires have been
caused by candles, halogen lamps and other
"now prohibited items," in addition to fires
caused by unattended cooking in student
apartments. In August, an Escondido Village
apartment fire was thought to have been
started by electrical cords.
But the University has had its share of
major fires in the past.
The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house
was destroyed by a fire in 1960, and a faulty

electrical cord caused a
major fire in Storey in 1980. In 1991
the Delta Tau Delta
house was destroyed in what-IH
appeared to he an arson fire.
Hinds said that fire safety has]
always been important at Stan-'
ford.

"From 1898 to 1976, students
formed part of the fire force at

Stanford until the City of
Palo Alto assumed con-^^

trol of the campus fire
department," she said, j
"Student firefighters,
