GAME NOTES: The Pac-10's top fwo teams will battle it
out with their undefeated records on the line. Stanford
freshman Alix Klineman will look to continue her suc
cessful first season after a career-high 22 kills in the Car

Americans, juniors Cynthia Barboza, Foluke Akinradewo
and senior Bryn Kehoe will also be instrumental in secur
ing a Stanford victory.

a pair of top conference foes. No. 4 USC and
No. 5 UCLA.
Stanford (12-0, 1-0), picked to repeat as
conference champion in 2007, is the highest
ranked team in the Pac-10 at No. 2 in the na
tional poll. The Trojans (12-0,2-0) and Bruins
(12-1, 2-0) are not far behind, however, with
No. 8 Washington and No. 10 California right
on their heels.
The Trojans come into the weekend with
the same 12-0 record as Stanford after beating
Arizona State and Arizona last week. So far in
2007, three opponents have forced USC into a
fifth game, most recently Arizona, but the Tro
jans have come away with the victory each
time. Against the Wildcats. USC lost the first
and third games before rallying to tie the
match and finish with a 15-10 game five.
