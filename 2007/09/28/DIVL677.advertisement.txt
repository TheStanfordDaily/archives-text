FEMST 101. INTRODUCTION TO FEMINIST STUDIES
(Same as ENGLISH 1728.) What is feminism and why does it matter today? This introduction
to Feminist Studies offers a brief overview of feminist history and thought, but focuses on
some of the most interesting and urgent debates over the status and meaning of feminism in
the 21st Century. We will explore the wide range of feminist theories and practices across
topics that intersect with gender inequality such as race, health, socio-economics, sexual
orientation, international perspectives, new media, civil rights and political change, as well
as across a range of disciplines - including philosophy, education, social sciences, visual
culture, literary and ethnic studies, and performance and expressive arts.

•ENGLISH 187. BROKEBACK: QUEERING WESTERN LITERATURE
The myth of the heterosexual, masculine West is about to be debunked. In this seminar,
we will consider the ways in which the West is a queer region by looking at a wide range of
writings from across the twentieth century. Drawing on queer theory and ideas about
geography and space, we will focus our critical energies on looking at how sexual queerness
becomes articulated as regional queerness: outsiders living on the edge of the nation,
along the borderlands, and in the diaspora.
