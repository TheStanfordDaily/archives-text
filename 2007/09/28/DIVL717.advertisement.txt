If you've made il this far through The Daily, congratulations. Now stifle your yawns and rub the bored out of your eyes
'cause you're finally to the good stuff. Intermission is run by a small band of renegades who have managed to infiltrate
the prestigious Daily system. To put it in context, if the Storke Publication Building were the Baldwin brothers, The
Daily would be Alec (respectable old blowhard) and Intermission would be his pill-popping, bloated younger brother
Daniel. (That would make The Chappie brother Billy —you know, the one no one cares about.)
In case you hadn't guessed, we are concerned with pop culture, along with campus arts, music, FOOD, entertainment,
humor and basically everything else you care about (i.e. sex).
So, who are "we?"
Natalie Jabbar is a junior majoring in English (yay poverty). When she is not holed up at the Daily, you can find her
roaming the halls of Cardenal in East FloMo (yay SLE), where she is an RA. She has a pathological fear of nametags,
because they cannot convey the fact her name is actually pronounced "Nuh-tall-ee"—even though she's short.
Natalie Justicz is actually a different person, although they both have curly hair, sweet glasses and late October birth
days (yay Full Moon). She pronounces her name the correct way and is the PHE in sweet, sweet C-House. Come to
her for Band-Aids...and condoms.
Kat Lewin is a senior majoring in Slavic Literature and currently spends most of her time praying that Putin gets us in a
second Cold War so she will have some shot at gainful employment after graduation. Rumor has it she once played
beer pong with Brosef Stalin, the Chief Secretary of the Broletariat. She started this rumor.
Now that you've skimmed our descriptions, come work for us. Whether you were the Editor-in-Chief of your high
school bi-monthly "newspaper" or spent your days hate-blogging about your job at Blockbuster, we want to hear your
voice.
Intermission has a simple writing philosophy. You know how they say people can tell whether you're smiling when you
answer the phone? We say that people can tell if you're wearing pants by the way you write. Take your pants off. Get
comfortable. Welcome home.
Where else will you get the chance to interview celebrities (like Sigourney Weaver, Chuck Norris and Jerry Seinfeld),
get sent to Coachella, dine at snazzy restaurants for free and throw gummy bears at the ceiling?
We're looking for people to write, take photographs, do layout and eventually make us obsolete in the office to which
we are rapidly becoming accustomed. Pants are always optional.
Get in Intermissionary Position. E -mail us at intermission.daily@gmail.com.
Awesome,
Natalie. Natalie & Kat
