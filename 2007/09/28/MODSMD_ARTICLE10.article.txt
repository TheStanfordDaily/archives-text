### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Physicist Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, director
emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SL AC), died of a heart attack on Monday in his Los
Altos home at the age of 88.
Also known as "Pief," Panofsky oversaw the con
struction of SLAC that began in 1961 and served as
the center's founding director until his retirement in
1984.The former physics professor also worked as a
particle physics researcher and machine builder and
served on the President's Science Advisory Com
mittee during the Eisenhower, Kennedy and John
son administrations. In addition. Panofsky chaired
the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on
International Security and Arms Control from 1985
to 1993 and was president of the American Physical
Society in 1974.
Born in Berlin in 1919, Panofsky earned degrees
from Princeton University and the California Insti
tute of Technology before working as a staff physi
cist at the University of California-Berkeley. He
joined the Stanford physics department in 1951.
Among other honors, Panofsky received the Na
tional Medal of Science in 1969 and the U.S. Depart
ment of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 1979. His
memoir, "Panofsky on Physics, Politics, and Peace:
Pief Remembers," will be released next week.
"TTie world has lost a truly great man," said Per
sis Drell, acting director of SLAC, in a Stanford
News Service release. "Piefs impact on particle
physics was enormous, but, in addition, everyone
will remember him for his unflinching integrity, per
sonal warmth and desire to fight for the principles
he believed in."
Panofsky is survived by his wife, Adele, and five
children: Richard, Margaret, Edward, Carol and
Steven. Plans for a memorial service are pending.
