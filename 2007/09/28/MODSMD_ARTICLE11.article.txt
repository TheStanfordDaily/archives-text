## Marine conservation: not quite a walk in the park 
### KT MERTES 
Earlier this week, two Stanford faculty members helped
launch a system to protect more areas in California that has
already generated local controversy.These new parks, how
ever. are located underwater rather than on land, so you
might not be able to see them for yourself.
Protecting marine resources has always been an ex
tremely complex undertaking. Without scuba divers,
snorkelers or submarines, most marine life is practically in
visible.
Additionally,creating a Yosemite at sea is nearly impos
sible â€” terrestrial parks use donated or bought land, but
the ocean is considered common property and cannot be
treated in the same way. And while forests or plains have
distinct boundaries such as mountain ranges or rivers, ma
rine systems are defined by water temperature or currents
and so tend to be larger, more homogenous and more in
terconnected.
Thus, marine conservation has always lagged behind
terrestrial environmental protection efforts. California,
however, is trying to buck this trend.
In 1999, the state legislature passed the Marine Life Pro
tection Act (MLPA), which authorized the redesign of Cal
ifornia's network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
Three years later, the California Department of Fish and
Game attempted to designate new MPAs but was thwart
ed by opposition from commercial and recreational fishing
groups.
In 2004, the Department partnered with the Resources
Legacy Fund Foundation, a Sacramento-based institution
that matches privately sourced funding with conservation
initiatives. The MLPA process became much more collab
orative.
A bipartisan Blue Ribbon Task Force and a Scientific

Advisory Team were created, and public involvement was
orchestrated through a Regional Stakeholder Group, open
hearings and online materials. Senior law lecturer Mar
garet Caldwell sits on the Blue Ribbon Task Force, and
Hopkins professor Stephen Palumbi is a member of the
Science Advisory Team.
The Scientific Advisory Team determined what marine
habitats (such as sandy beaches, kelp forests, rocky reefs
and others) most needed protection, as well as the optimal
MPA size for species of concern.
Palumbi's research on the genetics and dispersal pat
terns of marine larvae led to the Team's recommendation
to space MPAs 30 to 60 miles apart, ensuring that each
MPA would protect both current inhabitants and future
generations.
After more than two years of intensive effort, the Task
Force submitted several alternative plans to the California
Department of Fish and Game. Earlier this year. 29 MPAs
that protect 18 percent of Central Coast waters were ap
proved.
This week, the program officially went into effect and
has already been met with widespread public response.
Many local fishermen have expressed their concerns
about the economic consequences of the program, as half
of the new MPAs are strictly "no-take zones."This, they as
sert, may put some fishermen out of business and drive
costs up for suppliers and consumers. Some even dispute
the positive effects that scientists say MPAs will have on
fish stocks.
While it is too early to speculate about the ultimate ef
fects of the new MPAs, it seems that even after a lengthy
and arduous collaborative process, debate between envi
ronmental and economic interests is far from settled.
