University summer news
highlights: Bandsmen
get probation

The Stanford Band has given
many impromptu concerts in Meyer
Library, hut their performance on
May 24 may have been the last for a
long time. That concert came after
administrators had announced a new
hard-line policy against library
noise-makers â€” and it resulted in
disciplinary probation for two band
leaders.
Band manager Kent Blumberg
and drum major Jim Jett were each
placed on probation for a quarter for
leading 50 band members and the
Dollies into Meyer.They played two
songs before departing.
President Lyman upheld the deci
sion of the Stanford Judicial Council
that the two bandsmen deserved
punishment. But both seemed sur
prised at the university action.
"It's a place we like to play in be
cause we get an enthusiastic re
sponse" said Jett. "We didn't expect
any trouble." Added Blumberg, "As
long as I'm around anyway, the band
won't go to that library again."
