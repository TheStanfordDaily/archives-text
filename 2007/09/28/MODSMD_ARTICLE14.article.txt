# Clicking through the years
## The 						Stanford Web sites evolution over the past decade

You're surfing the Internet from the back of Econ
1A when a thought pops into your head: I wonder
what majoring in Chem is like?
You pull up stanford.edu, mouseover the sidebar on the
left and click on the dropdown list to select "Departments."
Scroll down a bit. Click. "Welcome to the Department of
Chemistry." Piece of cake, right?
But it wasn't always this easy.
We plumbed the depths of the Internet Archive
(web.archive.org) to flash back to 1997. All that's on the
screen when the page loads is a "Stanford University" head
er and some pictures of the Quad. You scroll down a bit and
move your head closer to the screen to read the text against
the bright blue background.
Blue? On a Stanford website? (It was meant to represent
the California sky, explains Scott Stocker.the web develop
er currently responsible for stanford.edu. Still.)
You find the link — "Schools," under "Teaching" and
"Research." Maybe Chem is in the School of Earth Sci
ences? Click. I Imm. Doesn't look like it. Back.Try again: the
School of Humanities and Sciences. Eek — a plain white
redirect page. Something about the www-leland name
being retired, and documents being moved under "/le
land/." Whatever that is. Click through. Finally: the link to
Chemistry.
One thing is obvious:"Design standards progressed a lot
over that time," Stocker said.
Since those toddler days of the Internet, the Stanford
Web site has undergone two major design modifications.
The first redesign, around Christmas 1998, got rid of the
blue, added news and moved up the links so that users did
n't have to scroll down. Easier to navigate to the Depart
ment of Chemistry, but still no neat color pictures of test
tubes once you got there.
More features were added in 2002, when the familiar
graphics bar was added to the top of the page, along with
more prominent placement for Stanford events on the right
side of the page. According to University Web developer
Aaron Cole, these events target one of the biggest markets
for stanford.edu: people outside the University.
Since 2002, developers have mostly worked on improve
ments not visible to the average Web site visitor, such as
how the site looks on cell phones.Though they have no new
designs currently in progress — only goals — the develop
ment team hopes to launch a new Web site within the year.
Stocker is optimistic.
"We'll be kicking off the project this fall," he said.

1995 Ten years ago, this bosk, simply designed site -with a background to mimic the
California sky -would have greeted you at www.stanford.edu.


2003: This screenshot from four years ago looks similar to today sate, with o bor of
celebratory photogrophs above links on the left and events on the right


7000: The Chemistry Deportment Web site features the standard blue links simply laid
out on a blank background At the bottom? A counter to tally visitors


With the down of the 21st century, Web designers ditched the blue background,
but held onto on elementary design.


Today sWeb site is easy to navigate ond easy on the eyes Developers hope to
introduce a new site design in the coming weeks


2007 The department s current site, streamlined and professional, bears olmost no
resemblance to Hs ancestor
