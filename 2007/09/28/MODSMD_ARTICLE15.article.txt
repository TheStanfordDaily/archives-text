## Editorial Board Roundabout misses the point 
### 
The new roundabouts at White Plaza
and the intersection of Panama Mall
and Lasuen Mall, better known as the
"Intersection of Death," are a positive step
toward slowing down cyclists who are used to
racing through the busiest bike intersection
on campus. Unfortunately,considerations for
pedestrians and precedent seem to have
been left out of the roundabout planning pic
ture.
According to a Daily article from over the
summer ("Roundabouts to regulate traffic."
Aug. 23,2007), Associate Director of Campus
Planning and Design Cathy Blake "said that
students, faculty and staff who participated in
interviews and workshops identified the lo
cations for the planned roundabouts as a
source of major concern given the heavy vol
ume of traffic these areas receive during a
normal day. She also noted that while a trend
in bike collisions was not the original impetus
for the design concept, anecdotal evidence of
reported collisions and nervous pedestrians
crossing into the intersections drove calls for
the roundabouts."
While we appreciate the effort to create
some form of traffic control through these
dangerous campus intersections, the ways in
which pedestrians are to interact with this
new system are largely unclear. Defendants
of the roundabouts point out that there are
two very tidy and visible sidewalks flanking
the new roadway between the roundabouts.
But how are students supposed to walk from
the Language Corner to Meyer Library with
out getting side-swiped by a bike?
The new roundabouts also imply an inter
esting shift in pedestrian power. Prior to the
concrete roundabouts and lack of signage, a
large amount of responsibility was placed on
the cyclist to avoid collisions. Moreover, in
the state of California, pedestrians have the
ultimate right-of-way at a crossing. However,
the signage at the Intersection of Death inti
mates that bikers have the ultimate authori
ty. Are there crosswalks? No. Instead,a series
of arrows directs only biker traffic. Consider

ing the bike-oriented signage, the pedestrians
must now yield to the bikers.Though this was
probably not the planners' original intent.it is
how the current signs inform the traffic.
A second project fault is the complete in
flexibility of the system. The excessive sig
nage. coupled with sprawling cement barri
ers. was perhaps intended to be foolproof.
Certainly, pedestrians aside, the new system
clearly marks the direction in which bikes are
supposed to travel â€” although some bikers
have proven the system unclear by biking
clockwise around the barriers. Unfortunate
ly. the rigidity of the new system makes it al
most impossible for a biker to respond intel
ligently to a potential collision. Picture your
self as a biker: What would rather do, hit a
pedestrian or collide into a wall of concrete?
It's a tough call.
Prior to the installation of the new round
abouts, students offered their own solutions
to the Intersection of Death. Last year, there
was the tongue-in-cheek class project that
placed a sculpture composed of collided
bikes in the center of the intersection. After
only a short while, it was replaced by a Band
constructed roundabout.The smaller size still
shaped the area's traffic pattern, but the ef
fect was softer and allowed for greater traffic
flexibility.
Echoing the history of the intersection,
the new roundabouts were left purposefully
bare to welcome student artwork and design
concepts. We support the thought behind this
gesture. I lowever, perhaps instead of hoping
to inspire more student installations, the de
signers should have looked more closely at
the roundabouts already produced. Studying
the redeeming properties of the previous
projects, namely flexibility and smallness of
scale, would have made sense before creating
a massive zone of cumbersome and sprawl
ing concrete barriers and signage that leaves
pedestrians sprinting for safety. The idea of
the roundabouts was a good one. but the
planners should have exercised more fore
sight prior to completing the project.
