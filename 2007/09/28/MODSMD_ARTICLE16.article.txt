## Our faulty memories 
### 
And so it begins: door-propping, lug
gage-carrying, book-buying, hot
neighbor scouting. We funnel onto
campus once again, the school year brimming
in all of its potential — new dorm rooms, new
classes, new beginnings.
Moving in brings with it the pomp and cir
cumstance of any time-honored tradition. A
parade of parents is followed by an orchestra
of idling car engines and choreographed
move-in moves: the sofa up-the-stairs shim
my. the kick-to-open-up-the-propped-door.
At the end of this procession, though, the
adults wave goodbye as they watch their kids
march on.
I look forward to move-in day and the first
day of classes with absolute excitement —
friends, relationships, learning. What's not to
like? I get to organize my desk drawers exact
ly how 1 want. I am master and commander of
my room layout. And there is the bliss of of
fice supplies: new Sharpie colors and neon
Post-Its. Gel pens or ball point? Binder or
notebook?
All I have to do. however, is think back
less than four months, when a deranged,
sleep-deprived image of myself pulled out
her hair studying day and night, leaving the
confines of her room only for caffeine, bath
room pit-stops and commiseration with dor
mmates over the evils of the quarter system.
Only a few more hours of torture, I would tell
myself, and finals would painfully, excruciat
ingly, thank-the-lord fully be over.
Summers free me from the chains of
studying and cramming. 1 swear off all analyt
ical thinking, not to mention critical analysis,
from June onward. When summer rolls
around, though. I immediately pine for
school once more.
Is my memory really that short? Or that
bad'.'
I suppose that as cycles go. the yearly aca
demic shuffle is a well-timed one. As soon as
summer jobs start getting sour or living at
home becomes too restricting, it's back to the
land of no vegetables, no bedtimes and parties
just around the block. When classes start to
drag and spring temperatures rise, we are set
free once again to bask in the joys of home
c<K»ked meals, candles in our rooms and pets.
We are scholastic dogs, who beg to enter the
palm-o-plenty world of Inland, whine for care
free summer days and then whimper to enter
the world of academia once more.
I think, partially, it's the ol' "You never
know what you've got until it's gone." We
don't appreciate the lazy Sundays until finals
leave our circadian rhvthms narrowly close

to disrepair. We don't appreciate the excite
ment of class offerings until quality entertain
ment during the summer becomes watching
the cat — while it's napping. (I swear some
times they flick their tales to a beat even
while they are completely asleep.)
1 guess the next thing always tends to just
shine bigger and better. That grass is always
greener. iPods continuously get skinnier and
screenier. Studies have shown that humans
are more excited and aroused by prospective
relationships than they are by their reality. Or
take Marilyn and Elvis — they are so damn
famous because they never reached their full
promise. Mystery and potential are attrac
tive. Possibility is intoxicating.
Reliving the long, excruciating hours in
Green isn't.
It is just easier. f<?r us and those around us,
to gloss over the bad. You only hear about the
wins in Vegas, the girls that said yes and the fi
nals that were aced while hung-over. I. too,
don't want to relive the boring, the rote or the
friends that didn't turn out to be great friends.
I know I'd rather not be reminded of my most
potent recent follies, embarrassments and
heartbreaks.
1 think the bad comes to us in bursts of
truth — the picture of an ex or a random run
in with an ex-friend sends us reeling into hon
est reminiscence. We tell our friends and our
parents all about the fun and the good things
that happen all the time, but only occasional
ly arc our sloppy memories punctuated by
moments of sharper self-reflection. It is in
those rushes of things gone bad. regrets, and
(hopefully) lessons learned that we adapt,
change and grow.
At least, that's when I hope it happens..
So here's to the excitement of class and to
highlighter pens with Post-It notes built in.
And here's also to finishing a summer that
was fun (but often lonely), to keeping in bet
ter touch with the friends I love, to procrasti
nating less ridiculously and to working hard
er. Here's to the excitement of a new year,
and learning from the last four.
