## Women set to take shot at Dons, Gaels No. 4 Stanford seeks to rebound after upset loss to Denver 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's soccer
team will get a chance to bounce back this
weekend as the Cardinal hosts the Univer
sity of San Francisco and Saint Mary's fol
lowing the squad's first loss of the season
against Denver last Sunday.
Stanford (7-1-0), then ranked No. 1 by
the National Soccer Coaches Association
of America (NSCAA), went to Colorado
last weekend to play two games in three
days at Rocky Mountain altitudes. The
Cardinal just managed to overcome Col
orado in the first game thanks to a second
half game-winning goal from junior left
back Marisa Abegg. but was unable to re
peat that success against Denver. Stanford
found itself on the wrong end of another 1-
0 game after the Pioneers' Jenna Billings
ley found the back of the Cardinal net with
less than four minutes to go. Billingsley
was named the NSCAA Player of the
Week.
Sophomore forward Ali Riley has re
turned from World Cup duty with New
Zealand in time to bolster the Cardinal
lineup, which has been missing sophomore
forward Kelley O'Hara for two weeks due
to a shoulder injury. Freshmen forward
Christen Press and midfielder Morgan
Redman and junior forward Lizzy George

have stepped up to lead the forward line in
her absence. Freshman Kira Maker has
also stood in for senior Erica Holland in
goal for the last three games. Maker sand
wiched a shutout against Colorado be
tween two fine one-goal-against efforts
versus Rutgers and Denver.
The Cardinal will likely get back on
track right away against USF.The Dons (0-
5-2) have lest five straight games — all by
two goals or more — and have only scored
just four goals all season. Fiona O'Sullivan

GAME NOTES: The No. 4 Cardinal will get a chance to
bounce back strong this weekend after dropping their
first game of the season, as Stanford was upset by the
Pioneers in the Colorado Tournament. Tonight, the
Cardinal faces a USF squad that has scored just 4
goals all season and currently stands at 0-5-2. Sun
day against the Gaels, Stanford should face a much
tougher test. St. Mary's has won 3 consecutive games
and will take on the Cardinal at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

team with 12 shots and a goal
apiece, but opponents are out
shooting San Francisco by more
than a two-to-one margin, a statis
tic that is unlikely to change
against a Stanford team that
racked up 32 shots in two games
last weekend.
St. Mary's (4-3-2) will come to
Stanford in opposite form, having
won three consectutive games. The
Gaels swept Sacramento State and
Valparaiso at home last weekend
after beating Vanderbilt in
Nashville, Tenn. the week before.
Redshirt sophomore forward Allie
Weiner leads St. Mary's with four
goals and five assists; forward part
ner Alex Ciliento, a freshman, has
four goals and one assist to her
name.
