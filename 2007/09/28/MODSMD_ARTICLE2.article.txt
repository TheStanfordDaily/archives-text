# SPARKING HOPE
## Card out to cool red-hot No. 23 Sun Devils 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford (1-2, 0-2 Pac-10) faces its third
straight ranked Pac-10 opponent in No. 23 Ari
zona State (4-0,1-0 Pac-10) tomorrow at 7 p.m.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, there's not
much reason to think the third time will be a
charm.
At 450 yards and 39 points per game, Arizona
State's offense is putting up numbers like No. 11
Oregon, last week's opponent, or No. 1 USC,
next week's foe. Though those teams are faster
than the Sun Devils, Arizona State counters with
nine returning starters and an offensive line
among the conference's best.
The offense leans heavily on a rush game
that averages 173 yards per contest behind the
one-two punch of tailbacks Ryan Torian and
Keegan Herring. Neither back is a super-star
athlete (though Torian was Second Team All-
Conference last year), but they've combined
for 567 vards and seven touchdowns already in
2007.
Perhaps as worthy of credit is an offensive
line that returns all five starters and entered the
season with a combined 79 starts under their
belts. Center Mike Pollak, left tackle Brandon
Rodd and right guard Paul Fanaika are the front
five's anchors; each was All Pac-10 last year. Ex
perience matters at every position in football,
but nowhere more than the offensive line, so
look for Stanford's young front seven to struggle
in its stiffest test of the season to date.
Through the air, quarterback Rudy Carpen
ter has 11 touchdowns and over 1 .(XX) yards this
season.That's nothing new for the 6-foot-2 jun
ior, who merely led the NCAA in passing effi
ciency as a true freshman.
Converted tailback Rudy Burgess and
speedster Michael Jones headline a thin receiv
ing corps. Even so, tomorrow's tilt might be the
wideouts' coming-out party.
That's because Stanford's defense isn't just
young, it's practically still nursing — seven un
derclassmen are likely to start on defense to

morrow. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the unit ranks
100 th out of 119 in the nation and dead last in the
Pac-10, yielding 459 yards per contest.
On the offensive side, the Cardinal isn't
world-beating, but it's doing its part to win foot
ball games with a healthy average of 435 yards
per game.
Sophomore tailback Toby Gerhart is still out

with a sprained knee suffered in the Cardinal's
sole win of the season against San Jose State two
weeks ago. but senior Anthony Kimble and
freshman Jeremy Stewart both had success run
ning the ball against Oregon. A healthier offen
sive line has raised its level of play from that of a
difficult 2(K)6, both opening holes for the tail
backs and giving senior quarterback T.C. Os

trander time to find his targets, but will now be
missing probably its best player in junior left
tackle Allen Smith. Smith is out for at least six
weeks with a torn left patellar tendon sustained
in the opening minutes of Saturday's game
against Oregon.

NOTES : Tomorrow's game against
Arizona State will mark the second
time Stanford has faced an unde
feated opponent. It will be a battle of
first-year coaches in harbaugh vs.
Erickson, although Erickson already
has experience in the Pac-10 as the

Sun Devils lead the all-time series,
14-9.

Junior running back Anthony Kimble ran all over the Ducks on Saturday, with two touchdowns and 1 20 yards on 1 6 carries. More of the same will be need
ed from Kimble if Stanford is to have any chance of upsetting No. 23 Arizona State. The Sun Devils have buiit a strong rushing attack of their own behind
their veteran offensive line. Arizona State's five starters up front have combined for 79 career starts at the collegiate level.
Ostrander has struggled with his
accuracy this season but looked bet
ter against the Ducks than in his pre
vious two starts. ITie Cardinal receiv
ing corps is also likely to be weak
ened. however, as senior receiver
Mark Bradford is unlikely to play fol
lowing the death of his father earlier
this week. Bradford racked up 72
yards receiving against the Ducks,
making him Stanford's leading re
ceiver in the game.
Underachieving Arizona State
coach Dirk Koetter was fired last sea
son.and the Sun Devils responded by
hiring a proven winner in Dennis Er
ickson. Lrickson, whose credentials
are unrivaled, has won two national
titles at Miami, took bottom-feeder
Oregon State to the BCS and a top
five finish and was twice an NFL.
head coach.
The Sun Devils appear to have
bought into his system, winning each
of their first four games by double
digits, most impressively beating
Oregon State 44-32 last Saturday, de
spite splitting the Beavers a 19-0 first
quarter lead. Slow starts have been a
theme for Arizona State, as the Sun
Devils gave up 14 unanswered points
two weeks earlier to Colorado before
going on to win 33-14.
Arizona State appears likely to
open 7-0. with only Stanford and the
Washington schools in the next three
weeks of a backloaded schedule,
rheir season should become much
more difficult beginning Oct. 27, as
they face Cal, Oregon, UCLA and
USC in consecutive weeks.
For Stanford, meanwhile, the
game represents the last of four
straight home games to open the
2007 season. More importantly, to
morrow's contest is the second week
of a three-week death march, with
the Oregon loss still lingering in Stan
ford's craw and a visit to top-ranked
USC on deck.
The schedule gets considerably
easier after this three week spurt,
however: Stanford's first four Pac-10
opponents are a combined 14-1,
while its last seven foes are 13-15. If
the Cardinal can make it through the
next two weeks in relatively good
health, there just might be a season to
salvage after all.

The Sun Devils appear to have
bought into his system, winning each
of their first four games by double
digits, most impressively beating
Oregon State 44-32 last Saturday, de
spite splitting the Beavers a 19-0 first
quarter lead. Slow starts have been a
theme for Arizona State, as the Sun
Devils gave up 14 unanswered points
two weeks earlier to Colorado before
going on to win 33-14.
Arizona State appears likely to
open 7-0. with only Stanford and the
Washington schools in the next three
weeks of a backloaded schedule,
rheir season should become much
more difficult beginning Oct. 27, as
they face Cal, Oregon, UCLA and
USC in consecutive weeks.
For Stanford, meanwhile, the
game represents the last of four
straight home games to open the
2007 season. More importantly, to
morrow's contest is the second week
of a three-week death march, with
the Oregon loss still lingering in Stan
ford's craw and a visit to top-ranked
USC on deck.
The schedule gets considerably
easier after this three week spurt,
however: Stanford's first four Pac-10
opponents are a combined 14-1,
while its last seven foes are 13-15. If
the Cardinal can make it through the
next two weeks in relatively good
health, there just might be a season to
salvage after all.
