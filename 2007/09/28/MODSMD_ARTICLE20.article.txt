# Gabi Ailes and Alix Klineman Volleyball
## Fresh faces boost Cardinal 
### BY REBECCA HARLOW 
For most Stanford freshmen, the first day of classes is the
beginning of their college experience. But the four fresh
men of the No. 2 Stanford volleyball team had lived on
campus for more than a month, not to mention winning 13
straight matches on the court, before even starting
IHUM.
"It's weird to see all these people," libero Gabi Ailes, who lives
n Lagunita, said. "But I'm excited to get to know a lot of them."
Ailes and outside hitter Alix Klineman have been on the court
.or nearly every point of the Cardinal's preseason and conference
Â»lav, fitting in easily with the veterans returning from a squad that
>layed for a national championship in 2006.
Klineman is Stanford's leading hitter and recorded a career-high
2 kills in a four-game victory over No. 10 California last Friday
>iight. Ailes anchors the Cardinal defense and is the dig leader on
the roster.

Ihe pair, along with
classmates Cassidy
Lichtman and
Stephanie Browne, has
tepped onto the court
/ith a confidence and
poise rarely seen in new
comers to the college
game. They credit their
older teammates for
welcoming them and for
helping them adjust to
the speed and power of
NCAA volleyball.

Freshmen adjust
quickly to the college
game to soar into key
roles for No. 2 Stanford

"I really like all the girls," Kline man said of her teammates.
"They have made the transition really easy It doesn't really feel like
I'm that new. Nobody is saying, oh, you're the freshman, go do
something different. We are all a team."
Klineman.a 6-foot-5 recruit out of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and
Nebraska native Ailes came to Stanford from very different places,
but listed similar qualities that attracted them to the Farm.
I think it was the balance of everything [that attracted me]," said
Klineman.the top-ranked recruit from her graduatingclass."ln the
end. it felt really comfortable here."
In addition to Stanford, Ailes also considered top-ranked Ne
>raska and Missouri, where she would have played with older sis
er latum, a senior libero.
"I chose Stanford because of the academics, of course." she said.
"And so I could get out and do something new."
Now she finds herself not only in a new place but also in a new
position.
"I was an outside hitter in high school,so it is totally different,"
the 5-foot-7 Ailes said. "It's a new position. Really hard balls are
coming at you. It's pretty fun."
Like Klineman, Ailes is grateful to her older teammates for
making her collegiate debut a good experience.
"I loved preseason,living with the girls inTVancos and spending
so much time together," she said. "My sister plays at Missouri so I
know that they don't get to hang out a lot in preseason unless they
get together because a lot of them live off campus. I really didn't
think I would be this close to all the girls so fast."
On the court, the freshmen got a taste of top competition against
several ranked opponents in the preseason, including No. 3 Penn
State, but finally faced a Pac-10 opponent for the first time in Cal's
11 aas Pavilion last week. Both were surprised by the raucous atmos-
