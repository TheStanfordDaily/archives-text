# Men's soccer faces unfamiliar foe
## 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
In its last game before the start of
conference play, the Stanford men's soc
cer team faces the College of Charleston
tonight at 7:30 p.m. on Maloney Field.
The Cougars won their first six games
before falling 3-2 to Central Florida on
Sept. 21. Friday marks the first ever
meeting between the Cardinal and
Charleston, which will force Stanford to
be resourceful against the unfamiliar op
ponent.

1 lead coach Bret Simon has spent the
week gathering information about the
Cougars (b- I 0) to prepare the Cardinal
(3-2-2) as best he can tor the contest's
unknowns.
"The ('ollege of Charleston is off to a
great shut." Simon said. "We rarely get
to see teams from the southeast, but I'm
very familiar with Coach Lundy and as
sociate head coach Ralph Poison —
they are great coaches and leaders, so
I'm not surprised that they have an ex
cellent team this year. At this point, we
are still trving to get to know a little

more about [the Cougars]."
Senior goalkeeper Andrew Kar
tuncn is not worried by Charleston's tal
ent. While the Cougars are armed with a
quick offense, including sophomore Ka
reem Yearwood, who has scored nine of
Charleston's 15 goals on the season and
ranks second in the NCAA in goals-per
game. Kartunen feels that Stanford's
hunger to lengthen its two-game win
ning streak will give the Cardinal the
edge.
"It will be a challenge this week
end playing against the College of
Charleston because we really don't
know a whole lot about them," Kar
tunen said. "[But] 1 think we're in a
great position right now because we
feel like we can win any game we play
in as long as we bring energy to the
game. We know we're talented
enough to win games, so it comes
down to a desire to win and [to] play
harder than the other team. If we do
that, we'll win a lot of games."

Likewise. Simon has encouraged
his players to focus on their own play
and the aspects of the match that they
can control.
"It's important that we build on
the success of the past weekend,"
Simon said. "We should be mindful of
Charleston, but not so engrossed that
we stray from the things that have
helped us be successful."
Mindful of its coach's philosophy,
the team will likely turn to its most re
cent offensive standouts, freshman
midfielder Bobby Warshaw and sen
ior forward Dan Shapiro — who has
had three goals in the last two games
—to lead them past Cougar goalie
Corbin Waller. Waller has allowed
only four goals this season, ranking

18th in the nation.
Stanford will need to be on top of
its game from the outset, as Yearwood
and the Cougars have netted six shots
in the opening period this season.The
Cardinal defense will he tested to
contain Yearwood, while Stanford's
front line will be looking to provide a
spark early in the game to get the mo
mentum quickly on its side.
A win this evening would place
Stanford's record in the thick of the
early Pac-10 race, an especially im
portant feat, given an upcoming visit
from No. 24 Washington during thf."
first week of October.
