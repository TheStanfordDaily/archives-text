# Men's soccer faces unfamiliar foe
## 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
In its last game before the start of
conference play, the Stanford men's soc
cer team faces the College of Charleston
tonight at 7:30 p.m. on Maloney Field.
The Cougars won their first six games
before falling 3-2 to Central Florida on
Sept. 21. Friday marks the first ever
meeting between the Cardinal and
Charleston, which will force Stanford to
be resourceful against the unfamiliar op
ponent.

1 lead coach Bret Simon has spent the
week gathering information about the
Cougars (b- I 0) to prepare the Cardinal
(3-2-2) as best he can tor the contest's
unknowns.
"The ('ollege of Charleston is off to a
great shut." Simon said. "We rarely get
to see teams from the southeast, but I'm
very familiar with Coach Lundy and as
sociate head coach Ralph Poison â€”
they are great coaches and leaders, so
I'm not surprised that they have an ex
cellent team this year. At this point, we
are still trving to get to know a little

more about [the Cougars]."
Senior goalkeeper Andrew Kar
tuncn is not worried by Charleston's tal
ent. While the Cougars are armed with a
quick offense, including sophomore Ka
reem Yearwood, who has scored nine of
Charleston's 15 goals on the season and
ranks second in the NCAA in goals-per
game. Kartunen feels that Stanford's
hunger to lengthen its two-game win
ning streak will give the Cardinal the
edge.
