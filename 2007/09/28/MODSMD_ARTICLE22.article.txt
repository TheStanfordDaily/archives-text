## Edwards gets his chance this Sunday with the Bills 
### 
Former Stanford quarterback
Trent Edwards will make his first ca
reer NFL start this weekend as the
Buffalo Bills host the New York Jets
this Sunday. The rookie was thrust
into the spotlight last weekend when
Buffalo's starter, J.P. Losman,
sprained his knee early in Sunday's
game against the New England Patri
ots. The league has since fined Patri
ots nose tackle Vince Wilfork $12,000
for the hit that injured Losman.
Edwards experienced mixed re
sults on Sunday, directing a drive
that went 80 yards and was capped
by a Marshawn Lynch touchdown
run. But for the game, the former
Cardinal standout was 10-20 for 97
yards and an interception.
It's now common knowledge
that the late Stanford and San
Francisco 49ers legendary coach,
Bill Walsh, played a significant role
in Edwards being selected in the
third round of April's NFL Draft
by the Bills.
Walsh put in a call to his old col
league, Buffalo General Manager
Marv Levy, who made the decision
to select Edwards on the first day of
the draft.
"That's all very flattering," Ed
wards told USA Today. "I want to go
out there and prove that their opin
ions of me were correct."
