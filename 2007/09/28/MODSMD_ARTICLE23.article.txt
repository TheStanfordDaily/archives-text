Hosting 45 colleges and 57 high school squads
from around the country'. Stanford cross country' is set
to compete this weekend at the 34th Stanford Invita
tional.
The event is one of the biggest of the weekend on
the West Coast, attracting mostly schools from Cali
fornia. And although it isn't the first event of the year
for Stanford, it serves as a kick-off of sorts for the rest
of the year, as redshirt sophomore Anne St. Geme ex
plained.
"This is the start of the season," St. Geme said.
"This is the first race for a lot of collegiate teams that
are coming."
Almost as notable as the collegiate races will be
the high school events that take place this Saturday.
The Stanford Invitational is the biggest tournament
of the weekend to many California high schools,
where a number of the state's top high school runners
will be racing their best at the collegiate setting of the
Stanford Golf Course.
Cardinal women's cross country comes into the
Invite with high hopes; the team is currently ranked
No. 1 in the nation and is coming off of back-to-back
national titles.
Ihe men's squad also expects a great deal of itself
this season; the team starts the year No. 6 after their
fourth place finish in the national championship last
year.
Although the Invitational will not be the most in
tense of events for the team this year, it helps ease the
Cardinal into the daunting regular season that awaits.
"It's a great way to start off the year in terms of
team camaraderie because we get all the track ath
letes out there [to help as volunteers], so they get an
idea of what the distance runners are doing," St.
Geme explained."The distance runners really appre
ciate the track runners going out there and helping
out with logistics."
After the Stanford Invitational, the Cardinal
squad will be off for two weeks until the Bronco Invi
tational on Oct. 13.The event will be hosted by Santa
Clara.
