# Women trounce Trojans
## No. 2 Stanford Volleyball dominates in sweep of No. 4 USC 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
proved last night that it deserves the No. 2
rating it has earned in the national poll,
sweeping No. 4 USC, 30-21, 30-27, 30-21.
Both teams came into the match undefeat
ed, but it was the Cardinal who left that way.
Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo hit .680 with a match-high 18 kills, and
freshman libero Gabi Ailes had 18 digs in
the three-game victory. Stanford improved
to 13-0 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10, while
USC fell to 12-1,2-1.
The Cardinal got off to a quick start,
going up 7-3 on back-to-back USC errors.
The TYojans closed to within two, but Stan
ford quickly pushed the lead back to six and
forced a second USC timeout. Stanford
reached game point after two aces by Bar
boza, and Akinradewo finished the game
with a kill. 30-21.
Barboza took over the offensive load in
the second game, swatting eight kills. Stan
ford again built a large lead early on, but the
Trojans closed the gap this time, taking
their first lead at 20-19. After trading points
down the stretch, the Cardinal finally
pulled away and won on a block by Girard
and Klineman.
Despite the momentum of a two-game
lead, Stanford found itself down at the start
of the third game. Akinradewo broke an
11-11 tie with a pair of kills, and the Cardi
nal held the lead the rest of the way. Junior
right side hitter Erin Waller pounded the
ball down the line to end the match and
hand the Trojans their first loss of 2007.
Joining Akinradewo in double digits on
offense, Barboza tallied 15 kills,and Kline
man chipped in 12. Klineman recorded a
double-double with 10 digs. She and Bar
boza also led the Stanford serving effort
with two and three aces, respectively.
Stanford had 12 blocks in the three
games, led by Klineman with two solos and
three assists, and Kehoe and Girard with
five assists each.
USC senior Asia Kaczor led the Trojans
with 12 kills, and Jessica Gysin had 10.
Tonight. Stanford will play host to a sec
ond top-five team as No. 5 UCLA visits
Maples. The Bruins came back from two
games down to win in five over Cal in
Berkeley last night.
Stanford holds only a slight edge in the
all-time series, but head coach John Dun
ning has not lost to UCI.A in his six seasons
on the Farm.That match will start at 7 p.m..
with free admission for students, and will
feature the annual Dig for the Cure breast
cancer research fundraiser.
