## Axe & Palm: We Miss the CoHo 
### JANET KIM INTERMISSION AXE GRINDER 
Let us all take a moment to feel sorry for
Axe and Palm, Stanford Dining's much
hyped new cafc in Old Union. For all of the
griping the University gets about its bureau
cratic labyrinth and draconian parly poli
cies, the much-hyped, heavily ballooned
opening of Old Union suggests a softer side
to the administration: a well-intentioned,
moneyed uncle who desperately wants his
nephews to like his Christmas gift.
Unfortunately for all involved. Axe and
Palm is an extravagant gift most Stanford
students didn't ask for, and its displacement
of the iconic, beloved CoHo has turned stu
dent opinion against the cafe before it has
even had a chance to make a ease for itself.
The quality of the cuisine is mixed. Axe
and Palm serves an array of foods: the übiq
uitous to-go items that grace the coolers at
all Stanford Dining-run cafes on campus are
present here, too, in orderly, refrigerated
shelves. The pre-packaged sushi, sandwich
es, salads, organic drinks and fruits are re
freshingly familiar and, as is the case with
most Stanford Dining-run establishments,
tend to be the most consistently tasty op
tions at Axe and Palm.
For those craving caffeine, the cafe also
offers the same range of drinks from Peet's
Coffee that the CoHo served up in its hey
day, as well as pre-made pastries from
Peet's. (As far as I could tell, the quality of
the caffeinated beverages seemed fairly
consistent with those from other Stanford
establishments. One of my dining compan
ions, an unnamed but infamously flamboy
ant student government official, claimed
that his cappuccino featured higher-quality
froth than the same drink from the CoHo,
but closcr inspection proved that he was full

of shit.)
Cold desserts are a wel
come addition to the cen
tral campus cafe: Axe and
Palm serves up milk
shakes and root beer
floats, in addition to sun
daes and banana splits, al
though the free-standing
barrels of ice cream fea
tured in the CoHo near
the end of its reign arc
nowhere to be found. Al
though the chocolate
shake is on the watery side
and docs not quite live up
to the campus-wide stan
dard set by Stern Cyber
Cafe's shake (which fea
tures real chocolate ice
cream and chocolate
syrup, in addition to whole
milk), it bests Lakeside
LateNitc's attempt, which
combines scoops of

droopy vanilla with a cascade of syrup.
The hot-serve menu, on the other hand,
is less appetizing. First off, there are no
crepes. Axe and Palm has done away with
perhaps the most popular food item at the
CoHo in favor of a made-fresh menu that's
almost identical to that of Lakeside LateN
ite with little of the panache that makes the
Lagunita dining complex a haven for greasy
late-night snacks.
An order of French fries brought forth a
small basket of the spuds cut shoestring
style, lukewarm, limp and over-seasoned;
the general consensus at my table (which
consisted largely of college-aged males, no
less) was that the fries weren't worth the
calorics. The turkey avocado sandwich con
sisted of a generous helping of turkey, un
memorable pepperjack cheese, wilted Ice
berg lettuce, onion and tomato, all served
on the signature giant stale roll that Stan
ford Dining seems to buy, hoping that
somebody, someday, will walk in looking
for a sandwich whose bread overwhelms its
contents. The avocado in said turkey avoca
do sandwich was nowhere to be found.
The Caesar chicken salad tossed by the
kitchen featured slices of chicken breast,
crisp croutons and the reasonably tasty Cae
sar dressing that comes with every pre
packaged Caesar salad on campus; the
browning and wilted greens, however, were
of lower quality than the salads next to the
to-go counter.
Our verdict: if you crave a salad, make a
short walk across the street to Tresidder,
where the tossed salads are genuinely deli
cious and fresh, or grab a to-go. There's no
reason to order from the kitchen, especially
since the dressing comes on the side in a
one-use plastic container, making it abun
dantly clear that the friendly folks in the

kitchen just tossed a pre-packaged salad
onto a plastic plate. In fact, if you want a fill
ing meal — a sandwich, a salad, some fries,
real ice-cream — hop on over to Tresidder,
if it's open.
None of the members of my party tried
the breakfast items, which include standard
plates like breakfast sandwiches, eggs, pan
cakes and toast, but, having tried breakfast
at various Stanford Dining venues (which,
as I hope 1 have emphasized enough, is the
monopoly that controls most campus cui
sine), we assumed they'd probably be safe.
For increased familiarity, Stanford Dining
has even placed, behind the counter, the
giant tubes of cereal that arc present in
every dining hall. Why yes, you are using
your Cardinal Dollars on the same people
who make your free dining hall food!
To be fair, Stanford Dining was also re
sponsible for the oversight of the CoHo;
what Axe and Palm lacks in comparison to
both the cafe it has displaced and the near
by Tresidder Union is a sense of identity.
This shortcoming is even evident from the
interior, which (as promised) features gor
geous granite surfaces everywhere and
combines the diner theme with that of a sit
down cafe. The sitting area is literally split
into two. with a cluster of booths in the sec
tion nearest to the counter and tables with
moveable chairs in the windowed section.
The wall decorations — vector art and
photographs by Stanford students, presum
ably— arc chic and minimalist, and they
complement the tan walls very well, but it's
hard to tell what the sitting space is sup
posed to be. Is it a reinterpretation of Green
Library's sunny, window-side sitting area?
Is it a reinvention of the cracked wood ta
bles at the CoHo? Are we in a jazzed-up,
idealized diner? One of my dining conipan

ions mentioned that the space reminded
him of the Treehouse. And so it does, with
its juxtaposition of booths and free-standing
tables — except that the Treehouse serves
much better food and a jolly array of alco
holic beverages, and it has a clear sense of
what it is (a sports bar).
It's hard to tell exactly what Axe and
Palm wants to be. And it's hard to tell if stu
dents will want to be there, especially given
that Axe and Palm is essentially a full-day
LateNite operation, but without the shab
by-chic charm (and crepes) of the CoHo.



This is the New Old Union. The Neo-Union? The Nold-Union?
