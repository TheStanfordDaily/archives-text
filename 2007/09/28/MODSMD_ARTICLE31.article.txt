## AT CANTOR: YOSEMITE ILLUMINATED 
### NICK PARKER INTERMISSION ESCAPIST 
This piece originally ran on Aug.

The writing is on the wall of the
Cantor Arts Center's Ruth Levinson
Halpern Gallery, home of the muse
um's newest exhibition: "Yosemite's
Structure and Textures," which
opened last Wednesday and will re
main at Cantor until Oct. 28.
"The park is a paradise that makes
even the loss of Eden seem insignifi
cant." wrote the naturalist John Muir
in 1900 in reference to Yosemite,
which is the subject of more than 50
black and white photographs and
maps on display in a minimalist ex
hibit on the museum's second floor.
In addition to Ansel Adams' icon
ic portraits of the park, the gallery
also features a number of pho
tographs from some of the first out
siders to visit Yosemite. Carleton
Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge and
George Fiske — all 19th century
artists — lugged their old-fashioned
cameras to the often-vertiginous
vantage points, from which they cap
tured some of the first images of the
park.
Watkins, Muybridge and Fiske
shared more than just photographic
genius and a love for wilderness,
however. Each artist's life was tu
multuous and, ultimately, tragic.
Watkins (1829-1916) spent much of
the 1860s in Yosemite and special

izcd in 15 x 20 inch mammoth-plate
prints. Watkins' work was influential
in convincing Abraham Lincoln in
1864 to approve the Yosemite
Grant, which laid the groundwork
for the creation of Yosemite Nation
al Park in 1890. Watkins was success
ful in his time, but the 1906 San Fran
cisco earthquake destroyed his stu
dio and the dejected artist was de
clared mentally insane in 1909.
Muybridge (1830-1904) is the only
non-American whose work is on dis
play in the exhibit. After suffering
brain damage in an 1860 stagecoach
accident, the Englishman traveled to
the park in the 1860 sand 1870s.
Muybridge, like Watkins, focused on
Yosemite's distinctive features, but
his photographic career was derailed
in 1875 when he was tried and acquit
ted for murdering his wife's lover be
fore being struck by a car and killed
in 1904.
Fiske (1835-1918) photographed
the park in the 1870 sand 1880s be
fore his house burned and many of
his negatives were destroyed in 1904.
One of the first outsiders to spend a
winter in Yosemite, Fiske commit
ted suicide at his home in the park in
1918.
Of the 19th century artists,
Watkins' work stands out as the most
engaging and the most eye-catching.
His mammoth-plate prints capture
the essence of Yosemite — the rich
contrast of the park is clearly evident
in his photographs nearly 150 years
after they were produced. Particular

ly striking is his 1866 print "Tasayac,
The Half Dome," which depicts the
majestic granite monolith standing
guard above Mirror Lake, whose
placid waters have an almost magical
quality. The blurred ripples (likely a
result of the long exposure time nec
essary in the 19th century) call atten
tion to the sharp foliage on the shore
and the tear-streaked face of Half
Dome.
Watkins' 1861 "Piwyac, The Ver
nal Fall" captures the same blurred,
static quality of water as the Merced
river cascades over a 300-foot water
fall, and his 1866 photographs "The
Domes from the Sentinel Dome"
and"The Vernal and Nevada Fall"
offer the same timeless views of the
domes and waterfalls that surround
the periphery of Yosemite Valley
that visitors to Glacier Point enjoy
today.
In contrast to Watkins' mammoth
prints, the photographs of Muy
bridge and Fiske are small and rela
tively uninspiring. Both artists were
trailblazers in the art of scrambling
to striking vantage points to capture
a distinctive and unique perspective
on Yosemite's photogenic features,
and Muybridge pioneered the move
ment to introduce clouds into previ
ously cloudless prints. (The long ex
posure time required by 19th centu
ry cameras meant that clouds were
usually omitted from photographs.)
Despite their status as innovators,
however, the work of Muybridge
and Fiske has not stood the test of

time as well as Watkins' pho
tographs, which bear a striking re
semblance to the 20th century work
of Ansel Adams.
Adams (1902-1984) first visited
Yosemite as a teenager in 1916 and
used his heart-stopping photographs
to bring the park into the public eye
for the next 50 years. Often credited
with launching and catalyzing the
modern environmental movement,
Adams had such a strong impact on
Yosemite that a large swath of
wilderness that lies just outside the
park now bears his name.
Many of Adams' most compelling
photos of the park (and, indeed,
many of those on display at Cantor)
were taken during the dead of win
ter. when the artist could most effec
tively capture Yosemite's striking
contrasts. Perhaps his most famous
portrait of the park, the 1960 photo
graph he called "Moon and Half
Dome," unveils the frosted cap of
the iconic granite dome bathed in the
light of a full moon. "Clearing Win
ter Storm" (1944) is another exam
ple of Adams' uncommon photo

graphic vision. As low-hanging, omi
nous storm clouds drift through the
valley, seemingly sweeping the tree
tops on their methodical march,
shimmering Bridalvcil Fall and the
hulking face of El Capitan pierce the
winter air in the foreground.
Many of Adams' wintertime pho
tographs— including those he took
in the high country at Tuolumne
Meadows and one that features for
mer University president Donald
Tresidder '19 cross-country skiing in
the Yosemite backcountry — high
light the contrast between sheet
white snow and dark gray granite
that makes Adams' work so striking
and so accessible.
Despite the generational gap be
tween Watkins (and Muybridge and
Fiske) and Adams, the artists' pho
tographs are remarkably similar. In a
way. the Cantor exhibit that juxta
poses their work allows Watkins and
Adams to transcend time, just as the
park they photographed remains
every bit as wild and captivating
today as it was 150 years ago.

tographs, which bear a striking re
semblance to the 20th century work
of Ansel Adams.
Adams (1902-1984) first visited
Yosemite as a teenager in 1916 and
used his heart-stopping photographs
to bring the park into the public eye
for the next 50 years. Often credited
with launching and catalyzing the
modern environmental movement,
Adams had such a strong impact on
Yosemite that a large swath of
wilderness that lies just outside the
park now bears his name.
Many of Adams' most compelling
photos of the park (and, indeed,
many of those on display at Cantor)
were taken during the dead of win
ter. when the artist could most effec
tively capture Yosemite's striking
contrasts. Perhaps his most famous
portrait of the park, the 1960 photo
graph he called "Moon and Half
Dome," unveils the frosted cap of
the iconic granite dome bathed in the
light of a full moon. "Clearing Win
ter Storm" (1944) is another exam
ple of Adams' uncommon photo

graphic vision. As low-hanging, omi
nous storm clouds drift through the
valley, seemingly sweeping the tree
tops on their methodical march,
shimmering Bridalvcil Fall and the
hulking face of El Capitan pierce the
winter air in the foreground.
Many of Adams' wintertime pho
tographs— including those he took
in the high country at Tuolumne
Meadows and one that features for
mer University president Donald
Tresidder '19 cross-country skiing in
the Yosemite backcountry — high
light the contrast between sheet
white snow and dark gray granite
that makes Adams' work so striking
and so accessible.
Despite the generational gap be
tween Watkins (and Muybridge and
Fiske) and Adams, the artists' pho
tographs are remarkably similar. In a
way. the Cantor exhibit that juxta
poses their work allows Watkins and
Adams to transcend time, just as the
park they photographed remains
every bit as wild and captivating
today as it was 150 years ago.
