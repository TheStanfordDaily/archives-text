## Put Yourself In Library Lockdown 
### Seth Shamban INTERMISSION PROBATE 
To those who enjoy and feel comfortable
working in their own room: Congratulations!
To those for whom a few hours of desk-side
studying feels like being locked up in Alca
traz: Join the club. My three years at Stanford
| have changed me from someone who wrote
at his desk to someone who writes on lawns
with a legal pad and reads in coffee houses
with friends across the table.
This article is an ode to those restless many
who roam campus searching for a decent
place to work. Finding another place to study
when you need to escape from your room is
liberating and endlessly rewarding. It may
even help you befriend a few of your fellow
I Stanford inmates.
The best place to study is wherever you
feel comfortable. For me, that means avoid
ing the normal study hot spots, such as the

Lane and Bender Reading Rooms and
Meyer Library. I like to start near my roost,
inching outside my door and testing the hall
way for studyability. In some dorms, the hall
is too social to be an adequate study area, but,
late at night, it is often the best place to be.
Areas close to your room offer all the com
forts of home — and easy access to study ma
terials — without the distractions of your
room. If the hall doesn't work out, I highly
recommend the lounge or the dining hall of
your dorm. Depending on where you live,
these areas are often desolate and offer a re
prieve from the stress of working because
they are large, open, well-lit and familiar. I've
written more papers sitting at dining hall ta
bles than anywhere else.
If you need to be in some kind of library, I
suggest the carrels on the third floor of Bing's
East Wing. They may be a little worn down
and dated, but they offer the quiet of the li
brary with the privacy of home. The protec

tion they offer from the prying eyes of other
worker bees makes the experience comfort
able rather than intimidating. During Dead
Week, the library has extended hours during
which one can almost completely move in to
a cubicle and make it a kind of second home
for studying.
At some point, though, you'll have to
leave the indoors and get some vitamin D.
When the weather is nice, the shores of Lake
Lagunita can't be beat. Rarely visited by
those who do not intend to jog around the
perimeter, Lake Lag offers abundant quiet
and space to spread out and get some reading
done while enjoying the sounds of nature.
Birds dodge in and out of the grass, and rab
bits race through the bushes. If you're afraid
of getting dirty, make sure to bring a blanket
or towel. The wise Lake Lag studier will bring
snacks and make the whole experience a pic
nic for one.
Those interested in not being completely

alone while studying outdoors can find lots of
grass across campus, but possibly no better
spot than the patch next to the Claw in White
Plaza. With leafy trees providing ample
shade, and a cool floor of well maintained
grass, it's a perfect place to while away the
hours while sipping on Jamba Juice and
cracking open the Humßio reading that mag
ically piled up after the last problem set.
For those who really want to get away, a
quick jaunt to the CalTrain station opens up a
world of possibilities. One station to the north
is Borrone's, a popular cafe and study spot
adjacent to well-known independent book
seller Kepler's.
If. like me, you sometimes need the gentle
motion of travel to facilitate the reading
process, you can always ride the CalTrain
north to San Francisco, or south to Gilroy,
and,then ride it back to create two to three
hours of solid, movement-filled work.
