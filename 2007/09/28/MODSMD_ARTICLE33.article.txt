# The
						Zimbardo Effect: Beware the
## 
### Stuart Coleman INTERMISSION SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST 
Walking through the corridors in the base
ment of building 420 in the Main Quad, it
seems unremarkable. You'd never guess that,
36 years ago, terrible events unfolded within
those walls, during what we now call the Stan
ford Prison Experiment (SPE).
In his new book, "The Lucifer Effect: Un

derstanding How Good People Turn Evil,"
Philip Zimbardo, the creator of the SPE, de
scribes for the first time in incredible detail the
events of the week-long experiment and ap
plies the lessons learned to similar situations,
such as the infamous Abu Ghraib scandal.
The book starts with a brief discussion of
the nature of evil and how a situation can trans
form ordinary people into monsters (the so
called "banality of evil"); this is the focus of the

book, which he expands upon exten
sively as the book progresses. Zim
bardo then quickly moves into a nar
ration of the events of the SPE, in
cluding its rationale and methodolo
gy. All of the participants were
young, middle-class men who were
randomly assigned to be either pris
oners or guards in a mock prison,
though every single participant said
that if they had been given the choice,
they would have chosen to be a pris
oner (this was during the Vietnam
War. and many expected to be arrest
ed during protests).
The results of the experiment arc
well-known: the guards, especially
those on the night shift, used any
means possible to break the prison
ers. The most common method was
hour-long "counts," in which the pris
oners had to say their numbers any
way the guards wanted, from count
ing by twos to singing, while any error
(or no error at all) was cause for pun
ishment. usually in the form of jump-
I
112

ing jacks or push-ups. Counts happened at all
hours of the day and exhausted the prisoners.
On the second day, there was essentially a
riot, with some of the feistier prisoners actively
fighting the guards. Because of this incident,
the guards started to use some devious tactics,
including taking away beds and clothes, run-

ning the prisoners' blan
kets through sticker
bushes — which left be
hind painful stickers
that took hours to pick
out — and culminating
in degrading homoerot
ic acts similarto those at
Abu Ghraib.
By the end of one
week, several prisoners
had gone home, one was
on a hunger strike and
the rest were utterly bro
ken. just surviving hour
by hour. The "bad
guards" used the prison
ers as toys, and the
"good guards" did what

little they could to help. It took Zimbardo's
girlfriend weeping at the plight of the prisoners
for him to come to his senses and cut the exper
iment short.
The next section of the book discusses the
implications of the SPE. along with other relat
ed research. The main conclusion is that situa
tional forces are extremely powerful and can
compel good people to evil actions. This is the
heart of Zimbardo's "bad barrels" metaphor:

it's not "bad apples," but, rather, "bad barrels"
that turn good people bad. Finally, he takes
this large body of research and applies it to
Abu Ghraib, putting leaders such as Donald
Rumsfeld "on trial" for the situation they
helped create, using inside information he ac
quired while testifying for one of the disgraced

guards.
By the end of the book. Zinihardo is repeat
ing himself quite a bit; the last chapters arc the
same arguments rehashed and repackaged.
However, "The Lucifer Effect" is still a power
ful book with an important message, and the
details of the Stanford Prison Experiment arc?
simply riveting. I highly recommend it and
guarantee you will never see the basement of
Jordan Hall the same way again.
