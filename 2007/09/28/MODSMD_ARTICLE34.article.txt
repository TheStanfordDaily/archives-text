# In Cardinal Blood

### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION CAPOTE FANATIC 
Everyone knows that the easiest ways to get arrested
on campus are carrying a red cup out of a frat party on
Mayfield and biking with both of your iPod earbuds in
— a white-collar crime if there ever were one. Howev-

er. what many students don't know isihat within Stan
ford's hallowed halls is a legacy of spilled blood and

gory crimes. A history of homicide, depravity and to
tally psychotic graduate students that we like to call
"True Crime: Stanford."

The Mausoleum Matriarch
Jane Stanford was the woman famous for running
Stanford after her husband's death. She shaped
the University's stance on arts education and co
. Ed education — but the one thinn she had no con-

trol over was her own mysterious murder.
The crime went down as thus: On January 14,
1905. Jane knocked back a g'ass of Poland
Spring Water and pronounced that it tasted
queer (in the old-timey sense of the word,
guys). Chemical analysis showed that the

water was spiked with a fatal dose of strychnine.

Reeling from the shock. Jane look off for Honolulu and booked a
room in a posh resort. Then, on February 15, Jane asked room ser-

vice to send up a solution of bicarbonate of soda

(apparently Turns had not yet been in
vented). gulped it down and promptly
kicked the bucket.

Many would be prepared to chalk up the
death of a 76-year-old lady to natural

causes, but an autopsy revealed the cause
of death to be strychnine poisoning. The
real scandal, though, started when the pres-

ident of the University, David Starr Jordan,
convinced a roomful of doctors that she real
ly died of heart failure.

Did President Jordan have something to
hide? Did the founders of Berkeley have a

bone to pick with Madame Stanford? Was it
really wise to drink untested bicarbonate of
soda only a month after a murder attempt? We
may never know.

The Butchered Bride
This brutal 1974 slaying remains one of the most chilling unsolved
mysteries in the Bay Area. One October evening. 19-year-old Arlis
Perry took a walk with her husband Bruce, who was a Stanford
sophomore at the time. After the couple got into a minor dispute
about tire pressure, Arlis stormed off to Memorial Church to pray.
No one knows exactly what happened while she was in there, but.
at 5:40 a.m., her body was discovered hidden under a pew. Her jeans
and underwear had been removed, and two 24-inch altar candles
had been used to sexually assault her. A 5 1/2" ice pick was driven
into her head'and the handle broken off so it could not be detected
until the autopsy.
The only definitive evidence on the scene was a partial palm print
on one of the candles. Investigators logged hundreds of hours exam
ining suspects and evidence, and theorists came up with dozens ot
occult-based theories. In spite of all the talk about Satanists and
"Son of Sam" serial killing connections, the crime remains unsolved.
The (>rad Student Slayer
In August 1978, mathematics graduate student Theodore Streles
ki pled guilty to murdering his faculty advisor. Apparently Streleski
was frustrated because he hadn't received his degree after 19 years
of schooling. And you thought taking nine years to get a Ph.D. was
tough. But instead of giving up and getting a job as a high school calc
teacher. Streleski took matters into his own hands by arranging a
meeting with his advisor and bludgeoning the man to death with a
ball peen hammer.
Immediately afterward, Streleski turned himself in to the police,
under the impression that his act was "justifiable homicide." Streles
ki said his victim deserved his gory end because he had denied Stre
leski promotions and departmental honors, demeaned his work and
once insulted Streleski's shoes.
Obviously. Streleski was no law student, or else he would have
been able to predict his conviction for second-degree murder. He
was sentenced to seven years in jail. Upon his release in 1985. how
ever. Streleski said in interviews that he still considered his crime
"logically and morally correct."
So think twice the next time you're templed to tell a graduate stu
dent, "Hey, nice shoes, Pythagorus." That insult,may be your last.
