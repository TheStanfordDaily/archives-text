# How not to get arrested
## 
### AUSTIN ZUMBRO INTERMISSION SHERIFF 
If you're like me, you're paranoid that, at some point, you'll
be arrested. Maybe that's because I was raised on movies like
the Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile, but I'm al
ways afraid that I'll wake up one day to find myself sitting in
front of an angry jury handing me a life sentence. While it
would be nice to make friends with Morgan Freeman or Tom
Hanks, I suspect that real prison is much less inspirational, so
I've been busy practicing ray key-swallowing and tunnel-dig
ging-
You might think that this sort of thing could never happen
on Stanford campus, but think again! A number of things that
you do every day might get you arrested, and you probably
have no idea. But fear not, dear readers. I will spare you the in
dignity of passing keys and crawling into your measly three
foot tunnel week after week. Here are some steps you can take #
to avoid being wrongfully convicted of a crime on campus.
Do not have an identical twin.
Identical twins are always trouble, particularly if they have
some sort of facial hair or wear eyeliner. Most likely, if that
identical twin commits murder, fraud or treason, he'll try to pin
it on you, so watch out. You can fix this problem simply by get
ting a haircut or crashing your bike. Being identical might seem
all fun and cute, but those 80-year-old ladies that have worn
identical outfits since the day they were born are putting them
selves at a terrible risk. You just wait. Soon, one of them is going
to be hightailing it to Mexico while the other rots in the slam
mer.
Do not plot to kill your spouse.
This ends badly. Even if you were just going to "scare her a lit
tle," or you were just drunk and confused, it's never a good idea
to consider that sort of thing. What if someone does kill your
spouse? What then? Who are they going to think did it? The
sad, drunk person with the pistol. Won't you feel foolish.
Do not buy a pistol.
Particularly a revolver. This seems like common sense. In fad,
never buy aknife, candlestick, rope, wrench or lead pipe. If you
must purchase one or all of these items, you should not place
them in either your study, hall, lounge, library, billiards room,
conservatory, ballroom or kitchen. If you find one of these
items, don't touch them without gloves. And if someone does
get murdered with one of them, even if you're not sure which
one it is or what room it happened in, please report it to the po
lice. They can conduct a much more thorough investigation
than you ever could. After all, you're just a party guest, or
maybe a French maid.

Do not wear a leather mask that you sewed yourself.
I don't care how cool you think it looks. If someone turns up all
chopped into sausage, the jury is no longer k>oking at the sad
wino with the pistol — they're looking at you.
Do not discover a government secret.
You would probably stumble upon this sort of thing accidental
ly, so be careful. Most government secrets are hidden in puzzle
books, like word searches and crosswords, but it's usually the
last puzzle in the book, and it's usually really hard. Strange
computer files might also contain government secrets, Because
of this, you should never look at a computer screen in a room
with extensive writing on the walls, particularly if that writing is
in red and prominently features the names and faces of politi
cal candidates. Steer clear of anything involving JFK, Roswell
and the Teapot Dome Scandal. Never look too closely at the
* original copy of the Declaration of Independence, and never,
ever try to find out what Lincoln kept in that hat.
Never invest in a company that throws birthday parties for its
CEOs.
Especially if those parties have ice sculptures. That's a clear
sign that you're about to be posed, painted and framed.
While in a public space, do not drink out of a red cup.
Red cups are often found at parties, and they often contain al
cohol. Many people, including law enforcement officers, will
make assumptions. We all know the adage about what happens
when you "assume," but it's still not a good idea to carry around
a mirror and a packet of powdered sugar.
Do not hold drugs for a friend.
Even if it's true, that's like the oldest line in the book. To avoid
having this ever happen to you, make sure that if your friends
ever give you anything, you ask if it has drugs in it. For exam
ple, "Thanks for letting me borrow your economics textbook,
John. By the way, are you hiding drugs in this?" If your friend
has thought of a particularly clever way of hiding drugs in the
item, 1 guarantee that he'll be more than happy to show you.
Do not paint your hand red.
You stupid sucker.
Remember, all of these are just precautions. There are certain
things that you just can't account for. If, for example, a gaggle
of robe-wearing virgins begins killing in your name. you can do
little but shave off the beard and issue a press release. Life can
be screwy like that. But with a little bit of luck and a lot of cau
tious preparation, if the long arm of Johnny Law ever does
come a-knockin', you can probably pin it on somebody else.
