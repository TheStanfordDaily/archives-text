## GIVE THESE 'INNOCENT CRIMINALS' A CHANCE 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION SMOOTH CRIMINAL 
Ben Harper went old school on his latest album in more
ways than one. Not only is the two-CD set "Lifeline" filled
with gospel. '70s Motown-funk influences, but Harper record
id his latest album over a seven-day period using a 16-track
inalog tape machine. The LP starts with a note from Ben, who
roasts, "no computers or pro-tools were used anywhere in the
process."
Ben wrote the lyrics to all of the songs, and he and his band
members wrote all of the music — a feat that is, lamentably,
growing far too infrequent in the music world. The CD pack
age includes a DVD of a live performance of the 11 songs on
[he CD. further proof that Ben and his crew only need a mike
ind an amp to showcase their raw vocal and instrumental tal
jnt. Harper produced the album, too.
The band recorded the album just after finishing nine
nonths of touring in Europe, trying to capture the six-man
group's fine-tuned musical tightness and chemistry — the
»roup practiced every day during sound checks while on tour.
'It just makes sense." Harper wrote about the timing for the
ilbum. "You've got all your best equipment [on tour], and our
nusical abilities are never as sharp or as heightened as when

you've been consistently on the road."
From the man who brought us the folksy "Steal My Kiss
es," the reggae "Burn One Down" and the poppier "Dia
monds on the Inside," Harper's eighth studio album also
packs a range and fusion of sounds. The album opens with the
thoughtful and unhurried "Fight Outta You,'' which leads
into a keyboard-heavy, danceable "In The Colors." "Needed
you Tonight'" is an explosive, soulful song about living with a
broken heart, while "Say You Will" is an up-beat, gospel
meets-funk song, complete with female back-up and a call
and-response chorus.
"Put It On Me" is also a quirky and quaint throw-back '70s
R&B song about a beautiful spendthrift: "She eats nectarines
with honey/ spends her daddy's money so easy/ she cuts cher
ry pie/ while she looks you in the eye/ so easy." He finally re
alizes, "I was lost out in the desert while/ you were busy swim
ming in wine/ You put it on me/ then left me lonely."
"Heart of Matters" is a pleading, affecting song about un
requited love in which Harper sings, "I wish I could find a way/
to sing the life back into you and II but now I am afraid/ it is
just too late to lie."
The disc ends with Harper and his guitar onstage alone —
the hypnotizing and exotic "Paris Sunset #7," a slide guitar in

strumental, flows into the title track of the album, a slow, con
templative song about hope. Harper says that life is too shor
to wait but changes the last chorus affirmatively, singing "]
could hold out for a lifetime/ yours or mine/ yours and mine
can't you see me reaching for/ your lifeline."
Harper's vocals are natural and evocative and vary as wildl\
as the influences on his album, which rises with energy,
to a slower, folksier tempo and rises again into an upbeat funk
number. The album is short, only 40 minutes long, but eacl
song is well-crafted, deliberate and expertly executed — Ber
can sing, and his boys sure can play. "Lifeline" has a rare, im
mediate sound that's almost under-produced, overflowing
with honesty and sincerity. Every song has its charm, and to
gether they form a powerful, moving album that's worth a lis
ten and a watch.
