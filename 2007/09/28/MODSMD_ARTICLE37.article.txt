# Iron & Wine: A New Sound Set Free
## 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION SHEPHERD 
Sam Beam, the founder of Iron & Wine, has an enormous
beard. But it's not a standard set of whiskers like you or I
might grow. No — this is an unruly mound of flaming red
hair. It's the kind of heard grown by a man deliberately
flouting the conventions of polite society. The sort of beard
that says,"I live all alone in a swamp, without a single friend
or mirror." A breed of beard that silently, but firmly, rejects
the prospect of superficial pop success.
And. until now. Sam Beam has approached Iron and
Wine much like he has approached his beard: as an uncom
promising individual. His first two albums were fiercely cre
ative, personal and low-tech affairs. Shunning any sort of
studio polish, Iron & Wine's indie folk was based solely on
Beam's talents as a composer and lyricist. Fortunately,
Beam's talents elevated Iron & Wine's works above most
conventional indie ballads. His sound was more like fragile,
melodic poetry: landscapes of Southern Gothic imagery,
lovesick nostalgia and tender childhood memories. And he
communicated this all through a hushed whisper and the
spare strumming of his guitar and banjo. Over the course of
his first two albums, Beam crafted a style that exuded sin
cerity and originality but rarely strayed from the core ideas
of his project.
But with its third full album. Iron & Wine have expanded
their sound dramatically. "The Shepherd Dog" takes the sig
nature Iron anWine sound to its most lush and polished incar

nation yet. The project, once the lone work of Beam in his
Florida home, now features a full-time back-up band and full
recording studio. As originally hinted at in their last EP. Iron
& Wine have incorporated frantic paces, organ, xylophone,
funky percussion and other exotic instruments into the mix.
Put together, these new instruments add calypso, saloon-style
piano and even twitch funk to the band's standard palette of
folk, country and Southern rock.
The album's first track, "Pagan Angel and a Borrowed
Car" demonstrates this new approach well. The track starts
with the distant click of drums and slide guitar in a gauzy and
metallic sheen, much like Iron & Wine's early recordings. But
with the swift crack of a snare drum, the song begins to reveal
itself as a rich layering of guitars, vocal harmonies, drums and
flourishes of piano. Meanwhile, Beam sings in his usual beau
tiful but cryptic style. "While with his gun the pagan angel rose
to say J 'My love is one made to break every bended knee."'
The band continues to experiment, throwing in a
Caribbean, dub-like sound to the song "Innocent Bones,"
which is the band's most adventurous turn yet. "Boy With a
Coin" features a catchy, circular acoustic riff and memorable
melody. In this song. Beam weaves several tales reminiscent
of 800 Radley's gifts to Scout in "To Kill a Mockingbird," a
Southern Gothic classic that Sam Beam has no doubt read
many a time. Then comes "The Devil Never Sleeps." The
band creates an almost Motown-sounding rocker, complete
with funky piano and bongo drums. It's a far cry from the
plaintive ballads of previous albums.


Stylistically, "The Shepherd's Dog" is a whole new era for
Iron & Wine. The hand, previously a prisoner to its own for
mula, has set itself free to explore different styles. But, thank
fully for the listener, Beam and company retain the core spir
it of the band. Beam's ideas and emotions and persona are still
the focus of the project. And, thankfully. Beam's beard re
mains untrimmed.
