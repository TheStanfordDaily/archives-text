Prisoners and college students have ab
solutely nothing but one thing in common!
We are both on a budget.
I've read that inmates get a set number of
meal tokens — they can use them on meals
or trade them with fellow prisoners for ciga
rettes and other items. Similarly, many col
lege students get a set number of tokens, or
moneys, from mum and dad, working, selling
off body parts, etc. And at least some of
those moneys have gotta go to clothes.

Now. there are ways to make a little money
go a long way when building a wardrobe. Lis
ten closely.
Being Cheap, er. Thrifty: Beginner's Version
Never buy anything at retail. In my
younger, more ignorant days, I did maybe

purchase one or two pieces at retail. But
those one or two articles are my most hated
pieces of clothing because two weeks later
they went on sale, and then I realized I had
paid $60 for a sweater I could have bought
for $30. Fashion goes in then out very, very
quickly. Stores get in new merchandise
weekly, and, when they do, guess what hap
pens to the old stuff? It goes on sale. And
then smart people buy it.
Shop on eßay. Often. I've had people tell
me they do not shop on eßay because 'isn't
everything on eßay USED?" Um no.
Don't be ignorant. Some things are used,
yeah, but many many things are new and
new with tags. Some things people buy and
change their mind about, some things peo
ple get as gifts, some things people find for
cheap and resell for profit. In any case,
most everything on eßay is below retail —
at least a little, if not a whole lot. And we
like things below retail. See the previous
paragraph.

Shop at places like Forever 21 and H&M.
Both companies' designs are relatively in
expensive and always incredibly in sync
with current trends. Shortly after Paris
Hilton was spotted in a $400 floral chiffon
dress from Foley & Corinna. Forever 21
had a replica dress on their website for,
like, $30. It sold out in a few days and there
after could be found on eßay for upwards
of $100. That doesn't happen with every ar
ticle of clothing from F2l or H&M, but the
point is that you should shop there. Their
stuff is cheap and cute.
Being Cheap, er. Thrifty: Advanc ed Version
Recycle your clothing. I don't have anything
from more than two years ago unless I still
wear it on a fairly regular basis. What do I do
with my old clothes, you ask? 1 sell them on
eßay. People will buy anything on eßay.
You could even sell your old socks on eßay,
and foot fetish pervs would buy them. You
might be perpetuating foot fetish perverted

tiess, but it just might be worth it. You could
buy new socks with the old socks you sell.
And when you wear out those socks, you can
sell them on eßay and use the money to buy
a new batch of new ones. You may never
have to spend money on new socks again. Or
shirts. Or pants. You get it.
Occasionally splurge on a few designer items.
Well, emu maybe a little more than occasionally,
and a little more than a few. But whatever. I do
this because you can look like you spend a bunch
of money on your outfits when you really don't.
Onedesignerpiececan automatically boost your
entire outfit. A $20 Forever 21 dress, for exam
ple, instantly looks better when you pair it with a
Marc Jacobs purse. A vintage tee looks better
withapair of Diesel Zathan772's (my all-time fa
vorite men's Diesels. Drool). You get it.
But, alas, 1 can't impart all of my secrets.
Then you would all dress as well as I do. And
that is so not happening.
