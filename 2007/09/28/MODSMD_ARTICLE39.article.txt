# Fall TV to keep you off the streets
## 
### BY ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION ANTENNA HEAD 
True story: Once upon a time, there was a lit
tle girl who grew up without television. De
void of such a marvelous form of entertain
ment, she turned to other pursuits, like read
ing, which made her smart and got her into
Stanford. But deep down inside, she always
knew that something was lacking. Then she
got to college and suddenly — thanks to the
Internet and the kid down the hall with a TV
— she discovered what she'd been missing.
That little girl, in case it wasn't already obvi
ous, was yours truly. Now a devout TV watch
er and critic par excellence (because not all
shows arc created equal), I've come to bring
you the good, the bad and the downright
ridiculous of fall TV.
1 won't bore you by telling you to watch well
established shows like "The Office," "He
roes" or "Ugly Betty." Either you already
watch them or you have several dozen people
currently after you to do so; in either ease, you
don't need me hounding you. I'm here to give
advice about the new shows, the untested
ones and the ones for which some guidance is
most needed, since adopting a new show can
be a big commitment. Do you have to watch
all of them? No. In fact. I wouldn't recom
mend it. unless your hardest class is kickbox

ing. But you may want to give some of them a
try — at the very least, they'll give you a
break from CS homework.
Pushing Daisies (ABC): Possibly the most
buzzed-about new show of the season and al
ready the darling of critics everywhere,
"Pushing Daisies" tells the story of a quiet pie
maker whose touch has the power to bring
the dead back to life. Unfortunately, said
miraculous gift has a few restrictions, the
most important of which is that he can never
touch the reanimated person again, or else
that person will die for good. This poses a few
complications when our pie maker brings
back his murdered childhood sweetheart,
only to be unable to touch her — ever. It's a
cute idea with cute characters and cute
voiceovers by Jim Dale (who also voices the
1 larry Potter audio books), and. even though
the soundtrack sounds like it's straight out of
"Desperate Housewives," it's definitely
worth a watch. (The premiere won't air until
Oct. 3, but those with an hour to kill can find
it floating around on the Internet.)
Gossip Girl (CW): At the other end of the
spectrum is "Gossip Girl." Though its pre
miere has already aired, it seems worth men
tioning just as an example of the extraordi
nary' pain that TV has the power to inflict.
While many thought it impossible to make
the characters of Cecily von Ziegesar's novels

any shallower or more insipid, creators Josh
Schwartz and Stephanie Savage somehow
pulled it off. Even the brilliant Kristen Bell,
who voices the titular Gossip Girl herself,
made sure to sit with the cast of "Heroes" at
the Emmys. Take a page from her book and
keep your distance.
Reaper (CW): The CW's other new biggie,
"Reaper," looks a little more promising (al
though I write this prc-premiere, so who real
ly knows). It's a supernatural dramedy featur
ing Sam, a general slacker, who turns 21 and
discovers that his parents have sold his soul to
the devil. Then, as if the lack of familial love
weren't enough, he discovers that the devil
has a job for him as the "Reaper," capturing
escaped souls and sending them back to Hell.
He gets help along the way from his other
slacker friends while simultaneously trying to
ask out his co-worker. Andi. It's hard to tell
yet whether this one will become the TV ver
sion of "Dogma" or is doomed itself. Still, at
least it's not full of rich New Yorkers wishing
they were on "The 0.C."
Ilionic Woman (NBC): Let me say up front that
1 like seeing comic book superheroes emerge
onto the screen as much as the next person. Re
ally. But so help me. this just kxiks silly. Jamie, a
struggling San Francisco bartender (played,
strangely enough, by the British Michelle
Ryan), gets into a terrible accident and is saved

by a cutting-edge operation performed by her
boyfriend. During the operation, she receives
artificial, enhanced body parts, including legs, a
right arm. an eye and an ear. and the latter is also
injected with special nanomachines that allow
her to heal über-quickly. All of which sounds
OK in theory, but "Smallville" may already
have played out the superhero card. The com
mercials that ran all summer at movie theaters,
however, were, shall we say, uninspiring (and
Jamie's squealing during her fight scenes made
one wonder why a bionic voice box wasn't in the
cards, too). But maybe I'm just bitter — after
all, bionic legs would really improve my soccer
game.
Chuck (NBC): Though the premiere of this
new comedy may have been overshadowed
by that of "Heroes" on the same night, it does
have a little something special going for it.
Chuck, a computer techie working at a Best
Buy-esque megastore, receives an email en
coded with state secrets. Suddenly, the geeky
underachiever is on the radar of both the CIA
and NSA and is forced into the world of espi
onage and state assassins. Sure, the special ef
fects may be a little lacking, and the writing
leaves something to be desired, but it's excit
ing because Chuck's past at Stanford brings
up prominent mentions of the school, the
Quad and the Engineering Department with
in the first three minutes of the show. Hooray
for school spirit!
