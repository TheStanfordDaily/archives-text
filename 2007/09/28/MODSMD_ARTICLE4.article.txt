# T.C. Ostrander Football
## T.C. takes control of the spotlight 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN 
For the first time since his high
school years, fifth-year senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander is
unquestionably at the helm of
his team. Serving primarily as
Trent Edwards' backup for the past four
seasons. Ostrander saw only occasional
action on the field, but in 20()7 has al
ready racked up six touchdown passes,
two fewer than the eight he threw in his
previous four years on the Farm.
Although Ostrander says he has al
ways approached his job as if he were
the starter, he admits he has noticed a
difference now that he is the clear
leader of the offense. That, along with
plenty of help from a new coaching staff,
has been a big factor in the senior signal
caller's improvement this season.
"I think in general that I've just be
come a better quarterback." Ostrander
said. "Understanding the game and
managing it is probably the one area I
think I've improved the most.
"As far as from a quarterbacking
standpoint, it's the first time I've had a
coach with a lot of quarterbacking expe
rience." he added. "Being a fifth-year
senior, there's a lot I know about foot

ball, hut he knows a lot of details that
you can't really pick up except hy play
ing the position. And for me. that's been
the good part — having somebody
who's been in the same situation, who's
seen these things from the same vantage
point as I 'm seeing them."
Born at the Stanford Medical Center
and quarterbacking practically at Stan
ford's doorstep at nearby Mcnlo-Ather
ton 1 ligh School, Ostrander has always
had deep ties to the Stanford program.
His father, Clint, was a Cardinal track
and field athlete and once held the
freshman record in the pole vault. With
all those connections and having seen
plenty of Stanford games in his youth,
playing for the Cardinal has been some
thing of a dream come true for Ostran
der.
"The first time |1 ran out onto the
field] it was pretty surreal," he said."Es
pecially at the Old Stanford Stadium,
because that was where I had watched
the games. Going onto the field was un
believable — almost a weird experi
ence. Rut I've gotten used to that now.
