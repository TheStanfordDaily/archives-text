# T.C. Ostrander Football
## T.C. takes control of the spotlight 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN 
For the first time since his high
school years, fifth-year senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander is
unquestionably at the helm of
his team. Serving primarily as
Trent Edwards' backup for the past four
seasons. Ostrander saw only occasional
action on the field, but in 20()7 has al
ready racked up six touchdown passes,
two fewer than the eight he threw in his
previous four years on the Farm.
Although Ostrander says he has al
ways approached his job as if he were
the starter, he admits he has noticed a
difference now that he is the clear
leader of the offense. That, along with
plenty of help from a new coaching staff,
has been a big factor in the senior signal
caller's improvement this season.
"I think in general that I've just be
come a better quarterback." Ostrander
said. "Understanding the game and
managing it is probably the one area I
think I've improved the most.
"As far as from a quarterbacking
standpoint, it's the first time I've had a
coach with a lot of quarterbacking expe
rience." he added. "Being a fifth-year
senior, there's a lot I know about foot

ball, hut he knows a lot of details that
you can't really pick up except hy play
ing the position. And for me. that's been
the good part — having somebody
who's been in the same situation, who's
seen these things from the same vantage
point as I 'm seeing them."
Born at the Stanford Medical Center
and quarterbacking practically at Stan
ford's doorstep at nearby Mcnlo-Ather
ton 1 ligh School, Ostrander has always
had deep ties to the Stanford program.
His father, Clint, was a Cardinal track
and field athlete and once held the
freshman record in the pole vault. With
all those connections and having seen
plenty of Stanford games in his youth,
playing for the Cardinal has been some
thing of a dream come true for Ostran
der.
"The first time |1 ran out onto the
field] it was pretty surreal," he said."Es
pecially at the Old Stanford Stadium,
because that was where I had watched
the games. Going onto the field was un
believable — almost a weird experi
ence. Rut I've gotten used to that now.

Stanford quarterback T.C. Ostrander has done solid work under center this year for the Cardinal, rack
ing up 828 yards and six touchdowns over Stanford's first three games of the season.
and really my focus this year has
been trying to get a program that I've
had a lot of passion for hack on the
right track and be a part of that."
Aside from his father's athletic ca
reer, Ostrander's family is loaded
with sports stars. His mother. Jacque
lyn. was a former competitive dis
tance runner, and his sister, Karin,
earned team MVP honors twice in
soccer at Georgetown. According to
the Cardinal veteran.his family back
ground has played a significant role
in the road he's traveled as an athlete.
"My family is just extremely com
petitive," he said. "Everything we do,
we're competitive in, and having that
kind of competitive attitude all the
time kind of pushed me towards
playing sports."
After a strong 31-point first half
showing against Oregon, the Stan
ford offense was shut out in the last
two quarters against the Ducks.
While Ostrander's overall stats in the
game were solid (25-44, 262 yards,
two touchdowns and one intercep
tion), he and his teammates will be
looking to rebound against a surpris
ing 4-0 Arizona State team.
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh of
fered praise for his quarterback in
breaking down what needed to hap
pen for his squad to defeat the No. 23
Sun Devils.
"For us, 1 really feel that we need
to be sound in what we do — in the
depth of our routes, in the precise
ness (sic) of our routes, how we pro
tect," Harbaugh said."lt's not a "trick
'em" kind of scheme, that's not how
you move the ball against this de
fense, or any defense for that matter.
That won't be our modus operandi.
But [rather, we're looking for] a
sound scheme,route running, protec
tion and a quarterback who throws
the ball accurately as T.C. has done.
When he has had a man open and the
time to get it to him. he has not
missed many."
Ostrander acknowledged the
challenge he faces against Arizona
State's defense this weekend.
"I think they have some definitely
talented players on defense, they
have some good team speed," he
said. "They're going to run around
the ball and they can cause teams to
make mistakes — that's how they've
been successful. But this week, like
any other week, our focus is going to
be to continue to improve on what
we do and to work on what we do, be
cause honestly if we do what we do
well, then we're going to be success
ful in the game."
Overall, though. Stanford's gun
slinger has held onto the same goals
he's had since he first arrived at the
Farm.
"My goal is to win football
games," Ostrander said "My goal is
to reverse the trend that's been going
on here. And if people say that I was
a winner, or that 1 helped turn this
thing around, that's really all I could
ask for."
