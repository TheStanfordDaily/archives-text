## King of the (Cheap) Thrill 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION KING 
"The Kingdom" is a very slick
production. It looks great, has some
nice performances and features two
tense action sequences. And yet the
whole thing reminds me of
"Rambo: First Blood Part II."
This is not to say the second
"Rambo" movie has a likable cast
or looks great. But it does share at
least one quality with "The King
dom": a desire to engage in social
commentary.
I like movies that have some
thing important to say, particularly
about serious issues like terrorism.
"Syriana" is a recent example that
comes to mind. But it's difficult to
get excited about a movie that seeks
to glorify violence while simultane
ously trying to distance itself from it.
ilt's an approach that's either too
subtle or too misguided for my
taste. But it can be quite funny
sometimes.
In the closing scenes of
"Rambo," for example. Stallone's

titular character stresses the United
States' moral responsibility to res
cue POWs in Southeast Asia. A fine
thing to say, but perhaps a little in
appropriate coming from a guy who
just killed 61 people with a machine
gun and rocket launcher. Sadly, the
juxtaposition of scenes in the final
moments of "The Kingdom" is no
less absurd.
"The Kingdom" doesn't start
out absurd, though. Taking cues
from real-life events in 2003, the
movie begins with a horrifying de
piction of a terrorist bombing in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
In response to the attack, the
FBI sends an elite team of special
agents to investigate. The troupe in
cludes Oscar winners Jamie Foxx
and Chris Cooper, as well as TV
stars Jennifer Garner and Jason
Bateman.
They are aided by a Saudi police
captain (a very appealing Ashraf
Barhom) who, among other things,
demonstrates to the audience that
not all Saudis are bad. As a matter
of fact, they can be rather compas

sionate and, well, a lot like us, real
ty-
Foxx, Cooper and Garner have
played these sort of roles so many
times before that they're automati
cally convincing. This is not true of
Bateman, who seems curiously mis
placed, like he's accidentally stum
bled onto the wrong set while film
ing "Arrested Development."
"The Kingdom" rarely benefits
from Bateman's comic relief, partic
ularly since it already has enough
levity in the form of Jeremy Piven.
Playing a variation of Ari from "En
tourage" and his drugged mob
snitch from "Smokin' Aces," Piven
steals every scene he's in as an
American diplomat determined to
prevent any further international
incidents.
Much of the film's plot in
volves the Saudi military's at
tempts to block Foxx's team
from tracking down the terror
ists responsible for the attack.
Those of you familiar with the
movie "Black Rain" will recog
nize the formula immediately

— it's another case of a back
ward culture stopping better
equipped Americans from
doing their job.
In "Black Rain." we have an ir
rational Japanese police force. In
"The Kingdom," we have an irra
tional Saudi military. The whole
thing might be construed as racist if

it weren't for that one Saudi police
captain.
Gosh, the screenwriters are
clever! Having said that, it's hard to
criticize "The Kingdom " on a pure
ly visceral level.
Director Peter Berg has demon
strated an ability to manipulate his
audience in "Very Bad Things" and

"Friday Night Lights," and this
movie's exciting, protracted climax
is a testament to this.
The scene begins with a startling
highway bombing and concludes
with a tense, claustrophobic apart
ment shootout. It's the film's high
point, and nearby audience mem-'
bers jumped in their seats during the

scene in which a Saudi terrorist is
knifed in the groin, leg and, final
ly, the head.
Had "The Kingdom" confined
itself to its action scenes and tal
ented leads, it would have been an
excellent action-thriller.
However, its desire to comment
on both US relations with the
Middle East and the cyclical na-

ture of violence seems inappropri
ate in a movie that relishes its action
scenes so much.
Informed discussion about ter
rorism and cultural differences is
certainly worthwhile; I'm just not
convinced a Hollywood action
movie is the correct forum.
