ROXY SASS
INTERMISSION PRISONER OF I.OVF

When you've been in a relationship for a few years, your sex life
can start to feel like being stuck in prison. Of course, with the kind of
studs Roxy dates, it's like being in prison on a tropical island — but
prison nonetheless. If you feel yourself starting to slip into a rut, here
are a few techniques to turn to for sweet, sweet release.
Use the prison library to study up on new sex positions. You
may think that sex books arc for old couples trying to stave off di-

vorce, but trust Roxy: a little erotic reading can

go a long way. Roxy especially recom-

mends books by Lou Paget; click away
from the porn for a few minutes and
pick up "Orgasms" on Amazon.com.
This book offers a variety of rear-entry,
male- and female-superior and side-by
side positions geared for your choice of
oral, manual, clitoral. anal or G-spot

stimulation

If you don't want to offend
your cot mate by suggesting

his or her moves have gotten

a bit monotonous, pretend

you bought the book as a
joke and spend some

recreation time to
gether flipping
through the pages.
Chances arc the sexy
drawings will turn you
both on (then those
oral exercises on page
78 will get you both
off).
Another fast track to

unlocking your libido is
having the occasional

romp outside of the bed
room —or at least some-

where more creative than
your regulation University

mattress. This campus has
tons of semi-clandestine
places just waiting for your

next throwdown. For the mild-mannered, Roxy suggests a

quick hook-up in a dorm seminar room (they're usually lock-

able), the History building late at night or the South Stacks

(look for the semi-private little nook near the books on

topsoil.)
If you really get adventurous, why not

have a go on the grassy knoll in front of
Terman Engineering building or inside

the glass walls of the clock tower? If done

in broad daylight, both are guaranteed to

cause major bike crashes — not that you'll care.

The same old sex is significantly more thrilling

when you risk getting caught, and one such venture might

inspire you to get risky with future love-making
Roxy's personal favorite way to enhance sex with

her steady partner is to add a third inmate. Shower 1
time, anyone? If that's too extreme, the next best
thing is to smuggle some toys into your usual routine.

Major condom companies like Trojan and Durex
sell little "play packs" complete with a lubricated

condom (which Roxy shouldn't have to tell you.

twice that you need to be using) and a one-use

vibrating cockring designed to fit around the

shaft of the penis. The ring may only vibrate

for 20 minutes, but trust Roxy, if you use it

right, you'll be vibrating for hours after

ward.

Finally, make sure you use the time between
you and your partner's "visiting hours" to get ex-

cited about your next conjugal visit. It may sound
a little Cosmo-magazine, but keep your partner
psyched about your sex life by constantly making
them wonder what you're going to do to them and

when you're going to do it. An illicit text message
during a class you both take or an evocatively erot
ic morning email exchange will get vou both excited

about locking yourselves up and seriously getting
down. After all. the real key to satisfying, rut-free

sex is enthusiasm. And tongue-work.
Seduce your fellow inmate (i.e., significant
other or casual fling) with these tricks, and Roxy
guarantees that you'll soon be getting (time) off
for naughty behavior.
