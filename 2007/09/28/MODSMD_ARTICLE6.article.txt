## Retooled course guide goes live on Axess 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
After years of neglect and unavailabil
ity, student course evaluations can finally
be viewed online with the reimplementa
tion of the course guide system. As of last
Tuesday, students can view information
about classes and teachers on Axess,
thanks to a joint venture between the
ASSU and the Registrar's Office.
Access to student advice on academic
classes has been limited in recent years.
For decades, the ASSU published a paper
course guide containing qualitative stu
dent feedback on professors and classes,
but transferring the guide online required
extensive time and effort.
The site was in disrepair by fall of 2005,
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 wrote
in an email to'lTie Daily. Due to the time
consuming method of manually inputting
each student comment, many classes had
little feedback or outdated comments,
while other classes were not included in
the online course guide at all.
"[With the guide] of virtually no use to
students," Avula wrote, "the Registrar
and the ASSU decided to shut down the
site on a temporary basis until we decided
how we would better provide course eval
uation data to students."
Since the closing of the site, restoring
the guide has been a campaign promise
for a number of ASSU candidates, includ
ing senators and executives.
"Personally, this has been a project
that I have been working on for almost

two years now," Avula wrote, "so it is
great to finally see us achieve our goal."
While the qualitative data of past
course guides is not available online, the
quantitative data gathered by quarter
end class evaluations — which have been
completed by students online since the
2005-2006 academic year — can be found
on the site. The numerical data has long
been used to help determine faculty
salaries and teaching award recipients,
but this fall marks the first time that such
information is available to students.
According to University Registrar
Thomas Black, the mean results of all
completed online evaluations for each
class are now available on the new site.
"Through the past year we've been
going through the process of perfecting
the collecting mechanism and the out
put," he said.
This summer, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 gave final ap
proval for the release of quantitative sta
tistical results to students. Black said,
paving the way for Tuesday's launch.
The new course guide is a treasure
trove of statistics. Quantitative evalua
tions rank each class from one to five in
categories ranging from "overall" to
"ability to engage" and "interaction with
students." Also displayed are the area av
erages for each department, allowing stu
dents to see how each class fared relative
to similar classes in the discipline.
True nitty-gritty details can be ac
cessed by clicking on a specific category.
For example, clicking on "interaction with

students" yields scores in the sub-fields of
"concern," "inspiring" and "availability."
The breakdown of survey respondents is
also available, revealing which percent
age of students were undergraduates,
how many expected to receive a "C" and
how long respondents spent working for a
class each week.
Although the new system may please
number-lovers, several notable features
of past guides are missing. Beyond the
nonexistent qualitative comments — the
hallmark of previous course guide itera
tions — the new system currently lacks a
sufficient search feature. Students look
ing for evaluations of a specific class
taught by a specific professor must select
the term the class was taught, the school,
the department, the instructor and finally
the class, making finding a particular eval
uation somewhat difficult and time-con
suming.
The guide's architects acknowledge

that the new system requires more work.
"We recognize that's awkward," Black
said of the clunky search interface.
Avula registered his disappointment
that student comments have not been re
leased as they were in the past.
"While I was incredibly excited to fi
nally have achieved our goal of restoring
the course guide, I was saddened to see
that the qualitative data from students
would not also be included," wrote Avula,
who credited other ASSU officials, ASSU
Vice President Mondaire Jones '09 and
past and present officials at the Regis
trar's Office for their help in bringing
back the guide. "This, however, is some
thing that Phillip Hon ['10], our ASSU
Executive Cabinet Chair of Academic
and Career Initiatives, and I are working
to have released, and I am confident we

will succeed in this."
Black said his office is currently
working with the ASSLJ to convene
a committee of student advisors
who will, among other things, offer
suggestions for improvements to
the guide.
"In terms of end-user function
ality," he said, "we definitely want
to know what you want."
