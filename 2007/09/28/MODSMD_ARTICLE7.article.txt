## University cuts "Friends of the Library" funding 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
To the dismay of faculty and community
supporters, the $80,000 annual funding for
the Association of the Stanford University
Libraries (ASUL) was terminated this past
month, following an unclear decision by the
University.
An established organization for the past
34 years, the ASUL. which is affectionately
known as the "Friends of the Library."
served as a support organization to the Uni

versity's libraries. Its responsibilities includ
ed hosting a number of programs, lectures
and workshops that were free and open to
the public.
While relying partly on member dues,
the ASUL's major source of funding was
the $80,000 yearly subsidy granted by-
Michael Keller, University librarian and di
rector of academic information resources.
In a May 24 statement issued to the group.
Keller warned its members that, on Aug. 31,
the University would end the funding that
had been granted for more than 10 years. In

its place, he urged the ASUL to raise an en
dowment.
Twenty associates of the ASUL re
sponded to the letter in late August with an
appeal to University President John Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy. Citing
a lack of time to raise the necessary funds, as
well as the miscommunication and misguid
edness of the University decision, ASUL
members urged Flennessy and
Etchemendy to reconsider. They have not
yet received a response.
Andrew Herkovic, director of commu

nications and development for Stanford
University Libraries, said that the Universi
ty had given the organization enough time
to make new financial arrangements.
"We gave them five years to accumulate
an endowment that would then support
them indefinitely," Herkovic said, adding
that the group had failed to raise the money
within the first two years and the Universi
ty was aware of its ongoing financial prob-
lems.
"There was no sustainable busi
ness plan to continue and we regret
fully decided to pull the plug because
it was not viable to continue,"
Herkovic concluded.
One member, who was granted
anonymity out of a concern for
overemphasis on their role in the
group, acknowledged that volunteer
organizations can be a potential chal
lenge for universities, but many mod
els of successful support organiza
tions like the ASUL do exist at col
lege campuses across the country.
The member also noted the
ASUL's frustration over the lack of
help from the University in raising
funds and the suddenness of the deci
sion to revoke the ASUL's charter.
The organization was, in effect,

"asked to commit suicide," the
ASUL member said.
In an email to The Daily, English
Prof. Bliss Carnochan. a member and
co-signer of the letter, said that there
was a lack of communication over
the decision between the University
and associates of the ASUL.
"The decision could have been
better prepared for and communicat
ed, if it was believed necessary, far
more thoughtfully," he said.
Herkovic agreed that there was
some miscommunication but said the
University did attempt to notify all
associates.
"We issued a letter to all members
in May informing of our intention to
close [the ASUL] down, unless some
one came up with a viable plan," he
said."But due to a systematic,clerical
screw up, we printed exactly half of
the 4(H) letters [needed to be sent).
Half the people never received the
letter at all."
The letter publicized a June meet
ing to discuss alternative options. Be

cause of poor attendance, no specific
plans were agreed upon. A follow-up
letter was sent, reporting the pending
cut-off in funding.
"Everyone received the second
letter which said, in fact, the game
was over," Herkovic said. "I can un
derstand why it seemed pretty sud
den to the members, but our analysis
and the disclosure about how dead in
the water the endowment campaign
was came late in the spring."
Despite their own demands and
hopes of a different outcome, ASUL
members said the group is unlikely to
continue its library support in the fu
ture.
"ASUL will probably not be re
constituted," Carnochan said. "1
think the community in particular
will be the poorer. Ibe University's
relationship to the community
should be handled with more sensi
tivity and care."
