## Frosh take on step-by-step fitness challenge Free pedometers flood class of '11 as part of campus health initiative 
### SHELBY MARTIN 
From IHUM to football games to
a cappella auditions. Stanford's new
freshmen have a lot of places to go.
Now, thanks to the Department of
Athletics and the Department of Or
thopedic Surgery and Sports Medi
cine, students can carry a hip-mount
ed companion on their journeys
across campus.
This week, all freshmen were
given a free pedometer as part of the
ongoing Stanford Freshmen Fitness
Challenge. Students are encouraged
to use their new pedometers to log
the number of steps they take each
day. Students can keep track of activ
ities other than walking too, as flyers
with step conversion rates for physi
cal activities including biking to class
(2000 steps for every 20 minutes) and
swimming (2000 steps for every 12
minutes) were also given out.
All dorms that have freshmen will
use the pedometers until Oct. 6 as
part of a campus-wide competition.
The dorm with the highest step aver
age per individual will receive free t
shirts and will be recognized at the
Oct. 13 homecoming football game.
Jennifer Sexton, coordinator of
Recreational Fitness and Wellness,
said the Challenge aims to help

freshmen explore campus, find out
about wellness-related activities and
discover positive stress-management
practices.
"Be active and take care of your
self," Sexton said, when asked the
purpose of the Challenge.
Some students are concerned,
though, that the message sent by the
pedometer distribution may be mis
interpreted by incoming freshmen.
Residence staff members from Bran
ner and Rinconada worry that the
pedometers could promote overex
ercising, especially among students
with body image issues.
The Branner Resident Assistants
[RAs] were so concerned that they
opted to pass out the pedometers to
freshmen without encouraging them
to log their steps.
"We weigh our responsibilities as
RAs to make sure that everyone is
living a healthy and balanced
lifestyle," explained Branner RA
Alif Khalfan '08.
Sexton assured that body image
concerns were taken into account in
planning the Challenge. As a precau
tion against overexercising, fresh
men can only record a maximum of
15,000 steps per day on their logs.
"We certainly did not want to feed
into the mindset of overachieve
ment," Sexton said. "We just want
people to create some good habits
while they're here."

Free pedometer hanging at her waistline, Cristina Gorrino '11 strides past the clock tower. All mem
bers of the freshman class received a pedometer this past week to track their daily number of steps as
part of a campus-wide competition aimed at promoting active, healthy lifestyles.
for the protection of her residents,
explained that the Challenge may
not he a very accurate measure of
dorm activity levels.
"They seemed excited at first,"
she said, describing the students' re
actions to the pedometer distribu
tion. "Then it took about 20 seconds
to figure out that it counts steps if
you shake it. Some of them sat
through FACES and shook their pe
dometers for three hours."
In Roble, according to Residen
tial Writing Tutor [RWT] lan Good
fellow '08, one freshman jokingly in
vited his peers to a pedometer
"shaking party."

Flaying with the pedometers
seems to be more about fun than
cheating, Goodfellow said, as stu
dents self-report their results and
are asked to sign an honor code
statement on their log sheets.
An hour after receiving his new
pedometer on Wednesday, Branner
resident Clay Heins '11 eagerly put
his to the test.
"I'm up to 1300 steps," Heins said,
having perfected a kind of bouncy
walk that maximized the number of
steps his pedometer was counting.
Asked if the pedometers would
increase freshman activity levels, he
re-checked his pedometer, then
jumped in place a few times.
"I've increased my activity lev
els!" Heins said.
