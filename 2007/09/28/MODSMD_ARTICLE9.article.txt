## Boardman reconfigures student affairs Office now organized around five associate vice provosts 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since the sudden departure of former Dean of
Students Maureen Powers earlier this month, the
office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) has undergone a significant reorganiza
tion, dividing Powers' responsibilities between five
associate vice provosts.
According to Vice Provost Greg Boardman, the
VPSA restructuring will spread the traditional
power structure among several different officers
under his supervision.
"Historically, the student affairs division has
been a flat organization, and it has included a de
partment led by a dean of students with a broad
focus and a variety of responsibilities," Boardman
wrote in an email toThe Daily. "For the new VPSA,
I divided the dean's area and appointed two highly
regarded administrators who have significant ex
perience at Stanford."
Chris Griffith and Sally Dickson, former associ
ate dean and associate vice provost, respectively,
joined three others already under Boardman's of
fice in the new roles. The vice provost said that he
had been considering altering the structure of the
VPSA for some time, and that Powers' recent res
ignation made his decision easier. He said he be
lieves that the VPSA's new structure will allow for
better cooperation between his office and other di
visions of the University.
"We have over 200 staff in the division and a
broad representation of programs and services
which makes it challenging to come up with just the
right structure," Boardman said.
"Stanford is, at its core, a decentralized institu
tion which depends on communication and collab
oration to establish viable partnerships among of
fices across campus," he added, responding to con
cerns about how the restructured VPSA will either
centralize or disperse the office's power.
"To a large extent VPSA is similar, and our
work is based on extensive collaboration among
staff and offices," he said. "The new configuration
is just as dependent on these networks and, to a
certain degree, reflects a consolidation of several
offices."
To fill the new associate vice provost slots creat
ed by the reorganization, Griffith, former associate
dean and director of the Graduate Life Office, has
stepped in to serve as associate vice provost over
seeing graduate life, judicial affairs, student activi
ties and student unions.
Dickson, currently the associate vice provost for
faculty development, will take on the responsibili
ties of overseeing a number of offices, including the
Career Development Center, the Haas Center for
Public Service, the Asian American Activities Cen
ter, the Black Community Services Center, El Cen
tro Chicano, the LGBT Community Resources
Center, the Native American Cultural Center and
the Women's Community Center.
In their expanded roles, Griffith and Dickson
