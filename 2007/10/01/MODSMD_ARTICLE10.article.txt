# Freshman poet: Its all about the love
## 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Students leaving lust Sunday's Faces of
Community performance (Faces) had
just one question: Who was that last
act? Closing the show was an inspiring
six-minute spoken word piece performed not
by an upperclassman, hut by a freshman still
new to the Farm.
"Sometimes 1 wonder what really lies in
one body/Sometimes I wonder what really lies
in one mind," the poem began. Six minutes
later, an energized and empowered crowd
showered Lyla Johnston' 11 with applause and
a standing ovation.
A wOek after Faces, freshmen vividly re
called the show's final act and were over
whelmingly positive about Johnston's per
formance, using words such as "emotional,"
"creative," "smart" and "amazing" to describe
it.
"What she talked about — what makes
man different from animals — was just a great
start to our college careers," Aysha Bagchi '11
said.
("horn Massey, associate dean of student af
fairs and coordinator of Faces, said he wanted
the freshmen at Faces to hear from one of their
own.
"1 really wanted Faces not just to talk down
to frosh," Massey said."l thought it might be a
great thing for a fellow freshman to talk to
them about how she sees the world, just com
ing into Stanford."
Massey first heard about Johnston's spoken
word experience during an early arrival pro
gram for Native American students and invit
ed Johnston to show him some of her work.
Impressed, he asked her to be a part of Faces,
and the two rehearsed several times before the
performance.
"The poem I read at Faces is just about re
specting yourself, respecting your own poten
tial — what you are, what you can do," John
ston said."lt's all about the love,pretty much."
Johnston said the piece she performed has
been in progress for two years. "It's an old one,
but it keeps getting changed and trans
formed." she said.
Massey said he liked Johnston's message
"about peace and what we're here for, not just
at Stanford but in life." he said. "It really hit
what I thought was the theme of Faces this
year. What she's talking about is moral and
ethical leadership, and I think that's really im
portant for people to hear, from frosh year
on."
Johnston had her first encounter with per
formance poetry when she went to a poetry
slam four years ago.
"I felt that sense of fire that you feel when
you listen to really good poetry," Johnston
said, "and I was pretty much hooked at that
point."
Johnston took a spoken word class and
made the varsity poetry team at her school.
Taos High School in Taos, New Mexico — the
first in the country to offer a varsity letter for
poetry.
Johnston's poetic prowess has taken her
from Los Angeles to New York for slams, and
she placed first in the National Anti-Tobacco
Second-1 land Slam in October 2005. Now. she
hopes to get involved with the Stanford Spo
ken Word Collective.
When she composes poetry. Johnston said
she tries to be an open vessel for whatever
thoughts might enter her mind.
"I don't think it's me writing all the time —
it's reality, maybe," she said, adding that she
usually takes emotions to their most extreme.
"If I want to write about something angry, I'm
not going to write about something a little bit
angry. I 'm going to write, you know.'shattered.'
'broken glass.'"
Massey said he was initially worried about
having a freshman perform but added that
Johnston handled the pressure extremely well.
Johnston herself admitted she was a little
nervous about performing in front of her fel
low classmates in the Class of 2011.
"I tried not to think about them too much,"
she said. "If I did, I would go crazy."

But Johnston also recognized the power
she had standing in front of the entire fresh
man class.
"With poetry you're kind of directing the
audience," she said. "Every single word you
say is going to trigger certain thoughts in each
person's mind, so you have a lot of control, a
lot of responsibility. I try to take care of the
minds I'm speaking to and plant seeds of hap

piness, inspiration, encouragement, anything
positive."
As Faces was her biggest crowd yet, John
ston added that it was exciting to be directing
so many people all at once.
"What is our potential?" she pondered at
the end of her poem. "It is exponential."
