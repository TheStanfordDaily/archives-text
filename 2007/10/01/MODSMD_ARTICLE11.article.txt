## Compost expands, some residences remain unserved Program has financial benefits; Mirrielees lacks nearby dumpster 
### MICHAEL DING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford composting efforts are alive and
kicking this year as all dining halls, most Row
houses andTresidder Union restaurants con
tinue to pursue the Farm's goal of going green.
The composting program, which is coordi
nated by the Peninsula Sanitary Service Inc.
(PSSI), was first introduced at the Wilbur din
ing hall in 2003. Together with recycling pro
grams, officials say composting has diverted 61
percent of Stanford's waste from landfills to
more environmentally friendly uses.
PSSI Manager of Community Relations
Julie Muir has headed the composting pro
gram since its inception. While Muir said that
initially only cafeteria workers and dining of
ficials received information about how to
compost organic waste correctly, the educa
tion effort has now been extended to the gen
eral student population.
"The reason composting started at dining
halls is because students don't have to do it
themselves," said Erin Gaines '06, the sustain
able food coordinator for Stanford Dining.'in
a dining hall, you only have to train the staff, as
opposed to training every single person at a
Row house or Mirrielees."
While the composting program has spread
to many campus residences and eating estab
lishments this year, some students find that
participation remains an inconvenience. Cara
Brook "10 said she has faced challenges while
trying to compost at Mirrielees.
Brook, who is a member of the environ
mental student group Students for a Sustain-
Stanford, said that she and her room
mates created a waste bin in their room for

compostable materials. But when they tried to
take the organic waste to a compost bin near
TOyon— because Mirrielees doesn't have its
own bin — they found it padlocked, forcing
them to take their waste into a dining hall for
disposal.
Gaines said that the compost bins had been
padlocked as a precaution: an entire compost
bin can be ruined by irresponsible students who
might throw non-biodegradable trash into it.
But padlocks on compost bins nearToyon
may not be the only factor deterring compost
ing among Mirrielees" residents. The lack of
composting locations near the large East
Campus apartment building creates extra
work for students wishing to separate their
waste properly.

"Walking to a distant compost bin at night
with a big bag of trash is not exactly the most
exciting thing to be doing," Brook said. "Peo
ple aren't inherently anti-composting or anti
recycling. It's just not a priority for them unless
it's made convenient."
Expanding the compost program has been
an economical decision for the University.
Per-ton waste disposal rates show that com
post facilities charge only $30 per ton of
garbage treatment while the landfill charges
$44 per ton. In addition, 50 percent of the
waste that is sent to compost facilities returns
for use in projects at Stanford. For example,
compost is used in the community gardens in
Escondido Village as a soil amendment. The
remainder of the compost is sold by the facili

ties for a profit.
Although the financial benefits of com
posting were a factor in the decision to expand
the program, officials said that the social and
ecological benefits of organic waste disposal
also played a role.
"If we could divert all the organic stream of
our waste,that would do wonders for the envi
ronment," Muir said.
She said she hopes that the composting
program can be extended even further, to aca
demic departments and University activities
such as New Student Orientation, for which
PSSI handled organic waste this year.
