## Investment club rides out market troubles Bosses of $200.000 portfolio react to summer volatility 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Most summers, members of the
Blyth Fund investment club take a
break from their academic year dis
cussions about portfolio monitoring
and buying securities. This year, due to
the market's turbulence over the past
three months, a flurry of correspon
dence among the Fund's nine voting
members led to several summer sales
of the $200,000 Fund's riskier posi
tions.
"The volatility this summer has
been unprecedented since I've been
with Blyth Fund," Connie Yu '09, co
president of the group, wrote in an
email toThe Daily. "Historically, we've
never made transactions over the
summer. We carefully evaluate our
portfolio at the end of spring quarter
and adjust our positions to match our
risk tolerance and expectations."
Yu added that the Blyth Fund usu
ally sells riskier, unstable stock that
could generate losses if left unattend
ed before summer quarter begins.
Fund managers can then sleep sound
ly over the summer and return to port
folio management in the fall.
This summer, however, the Fund
did not take its usual hiatus and in
stead made a few necessary transac
tions. As the Dow Jones Industrial Av
erage regularly experienced dramatic
1 (X)-point swings this past August,
Blyth Fund directors determined that
the market was too volatile, creating
unpredictability for equities and the
retail sector and making a summer
meeting critical.
"The market is going through a
much more severe correction than
many were anticipating," wrote Hin
Leung'oB, one of the Fund's directors,
in an August email to other group
members. "The overwhelming con
sensus is that the worst is still to
come."
Over the summer, the group's di
rectors voted by email to sell shares of
several exchange tracking funds, bas
kets of stock which reflect the prices

of indexes such as the Dow Jones.
NASDAQ and the Standard and Poor
500.
"We felt they were vulnerable," Yu
said.
She added that the Blyth Fund
also sold its stock in the organic food
retailer Whole Foods after its acquisi
tion of rival Wild Oats was approved.
The club has not escaped losses
from the recent subprime mortgage
crisis. Hie Blyth Fund holds shares of
Delta Financial Corporation, a com
pany that deals in high-risk mortgages
and has lost 50 percent of its value
over the past three months.
"We made quite a bit of gains and
sold off half our position during the
school year," Yu said. "But the half we
held on to has been hit hard."
Despite these losses, Blyth Fund
managers maintain that the group in
vests in fundamentally strong compa
nies that will eventually produce a
profit in the long term.
"We're a fundamentally driven
fund," said Max Rounds '08, the
Fund's other co-president."We invest
in companies that have strong busi
ness models and companies that
make good financial decisions. They
can be established companies or small
ones that we believe have the poten
tial to grow."
Rounds said he remains confident
that, despite recent volatility, Delta's
shares may be due for a rebound.
"We still believe the [Delta Finan
cial Corporation] stocks are a good
buy," Rounds said. "We will reevalu
ate the company once third quarter
numbers come out."
The Blyth Fund was established in
1978 when Stanford received a dona
tion from Charles R. Blyth. a well
known California financier.The Fund
has kept consistent financial reports
since 2(X)3. In the 12-month period
ending April 30, 2(K)7. the Fund beat
the gains of the S&P S(H) average by
8.18 percent.
Most of the Fund's capital gains
and dividends go toward operating
costs and reinvestment, but Rounds
said the group also donates 25 percent
of its earnings to the University.
