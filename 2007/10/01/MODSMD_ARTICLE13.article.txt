Stanford's endowment fund gen
erated a 23 percent return in the 12
months that ended June 30, the
management company that over
sees it announced Friday.
That heady gain outpaced even
the robust performance of the S&P
500 Index during the period, which
grew 20.6 percent. The Stanford
Merged Pool lund has grown an av
erage of 15.1 percent per year over
the past 10 years.
Hie total size of the endowment
fund, as of Aug. 31, was $ 17.2 billion,
up from $14.1 billion last year.
A Friday press release credited
international markets, private equi
ty and real estate investments for
helping to keep investment returns
high.
Consistently high returns, gained
through a portfolio with long-term
horizons, helped prompt the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees to in
crease the target payout, or the
amount spent of the total endow
ment. to 5.5 percent per year. It had
been 5 percent.
