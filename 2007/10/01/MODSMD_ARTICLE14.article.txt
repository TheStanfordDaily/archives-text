## Holt's Harangue Checkered shoes and crooked smiles 
### 
Hello everyone. My name is Chris,
and I'm excited to have been select
ed as a columnist for I"he Stanford
Daily. Over the next four years, I hope we'll
become great friends.
I'm originally from New Jersey, so I
imagine I'll have some self-deprecating
jokes that I'll occasionally throw in about
my weird background. My father was a reli
gious studies major at UC Santa Cruz and
still can?t remember how many drugs he
took. He?s now a corporate lawyer. If you
think that?s strange, my mom was in the
Stanford Band.
Iliis entire campus is so new and strange
to me. There is so much to comment on
here.
Maybe I'll write next week about 11IIJM
or PWR and talk about the crazy types of
people that one might encounter in said
classes. I bet there are interesting people
that are at times too knowledgeable or too
enthusiastic about the topics discussed. Or
maybe I'll write about Full Moon on the
Ouad and how it's not nearly as scandalous
as it once was. but. rather, a PG-rated hug
fest with none of the risque free-love it once
had. I have no idea —1 haven't experi
enced it yet. But whatever I write about, it'll
be completely original and different.
Later in my freshman year, 1 could total
ly see myself writing about joining a frater
nity and/or co-operative house. While ini
tially mocking both groups. I will find both
to have welcoming and interesting people,
and I must choose between them and the
love of a woman, in addition to solving the
mystery of the steam tunnel murders, in a
dramatic finale of season two.
1 look forward to spending the next four
years investigating this overwhelming place
and. hopefully, making it my own. During
my middle years Ill probably take up cam
pus causes. I wonder what kind of student
government Stanford has. I bet the average
Stanford student doesn't know about the
Machiavellian dealings that exist right
under their noses. Maybe I'll become a sen
ator and eventually a member of a high
profile committee, rising to popularity
among the caucusing student groups due to
my great collection of tweed jackets and my
ability to quote Sun Tzu with a dead-on
Sean Connery impression.
Maybe Ill grow tired of the cocktail par
ties and the petition-forging and decide, on
a whim, to blow the lid off a huge election
fraud cover-up and fight to expose the
grave injustices rendered by power-hungry
and corrupt politicians. No longer a suave
political hack, I'll be hailed as a hero for my

pivotal role in exposing corruption on this
most important of stages. I'll spend most of
my junior year writing from the front lines
of student protests, cutting my enemies
down with thinly veiled satire and causing
none-too-small a stir at faculty brunches.
Maybe I'll make a joke about pirates and
ninjas. because, man, is that topical.
During my junior year, perhaps I. too,
will study abroad and have a deep and mov
ing experience with a culture that is foreign
to me but provides some greater truth that
all cultures can appreciate. I will share these
groundbreaking nuggets of wisdom on a
weekly basis. 1 shall title this series of
columns "Pretentious Letters from Spain."
Then, when I return, I will have several
bitter senior moments. I'll become a bo
hemian who smokes cigarettes and uses
words like querulous to describe people. In
evitably. I'll feel the pressure of the real
world coming and will lash out at a system
that is seemingly unfun. or at least less fun
than when 1 was a freshman. Ill take on the
persons who crack down on parties or free
speech or free crack.
Maybe I'll do a piece examining the gen
erous donor who keeps funding and then
building all of these interesting buildings on
campus. 1 bet a well planned, balanced dis
cussion on how said donor is perceived by
students and how the administration relates
to him/her would be very interesting. I
imagine that such an investigative piece of
journalism would be welcomed by the .Stan
ford community because it discusses the
very soul of the University. I look forward
to writing it.
And. in the end. after I've written all 1
could have written. 1 would hope to write a
worthy and appropriate finale that captures
my love for this place. Maybe in that piece,
people would understand that my satires
were meant in the deepest love and respect
for the school I'd attended.
Hut I'm getting ahead of myself. My
name is C'hris I iolt. I write for The Stanford
Daily.
