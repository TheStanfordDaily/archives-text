# Jena 6: A threat to justice everywhere
## 
### 
On Thursday, Sept. 20. national news
sources estimated that between 15,000
and 20,000 people descended upon the
small rural town of Jena, I .a. Participants put
that number instead at 40.000 to 50,000. De
scribed as a "pilgrimage" by ('NN. this gather
ing was the result of a subversion of justice in
the LaSalle Parish for six high school students
who have come to be known as the "Jena 6."
For those unfamiliar with the case, the town
experienced a heightened level of racial ten
sion when three nooses were hung from a tree
on Sept. l,2oo6.afteragroupofblackstudents
sat under it. It was common knowledge that
the tree was reserved for white students. De
spite the principal's recommendation that the
three white students responsible be expelled,
the sch<H)l district superintendent imposed a
lighter three-day suspension for what he de
scribed as a "youthful prank."
Black students staged a protest at the tree,
and a series of events with racial overtones un
folded.lhe school's main building was burned
down. A black student. Robert Bailey, suf
fered injuries and was allegedly hit with a bot
tle while attempting to enter a social function
of white students. A simple battery charge wax
filed. and one student received probation.
Ihe next day. Bailey confronted another
white student who had been at the party. This
student threatened him with a shotgun. Bailey
and some friends wrestled the shotgun away
from him and unloaded it. yet they were
charged with theft of the gun. while the owner
received no punishment.
All these events led up to Dec. 4. 200f>,
when a white student named Justin Barker al
legedly taunted Bailey about his injuries,
mocked a number of students about the noos
es and used racial epithets. It is then alleged
that a group of students physically retaliated,
and Barker was taken to the hospital where he
was treated for his injuries. The injuries were
mild enough that he was able to attend a
school function that evening.

Six students were charged in regular and
juvenile courts with a combination of attempt
ed second-degree murder,conspiracy and bat
tery. Mychal Bell was charged as an adult,
though only 16 years old at the time. Bail was
set very high, above $70,000 for all. and many
languished in prison for months, unable to at
tend school.
As Martin 1 .uther King. Jr. once remarked.
"An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere." It is an injustice that students be
allowed to hang nooses, evoking decades of
lynchings that subverted the country's legal
system.continued second-class citizenship for
African-Americans and ended the lives of
countless innocent victims, both black and
white. Consider other similar symbols of hate
and violence and imagine whether the stu
dents responsible would receive just a slap on
the wrist, and think of the outrage they would
undoubtedly have caused. Where is the equal
ity?
Let me be clear. No one advocating for the
Jena b is condoning the use of violence. From
the outset, the rally was one of non-violence.
Comments made by the district attorney
about disaster being averted that Thursday
vent ion of the Lord Jesus
Christ? arc out rageous. Ihe acts of hate and vi
olence committed by white students have
gone relatively unpunished, while the acts of
violence committed by black students have re
sulted in excessive charges in which the same
district attorney has presented a tennis shoe as
a murder weapon. Where is the justice?
Ihe NAA( P is one of a number of organi
zations advocating for the Jena f>. Mychal
Bell?s inappropriate conviction as an adult
has been thrown out. and he faces a new trial
as a juvenile. Ihe FBI is also monitoring the
legal proceedings. I ,ast Ihursday. Bell was fi
nally released from prison, though he is now
confined to house arrest.
But the fight is not over. Bell is set
to face the same prosecuting attor
ney and judge in a juvenile court

whose trials have been overturned
twice. In a glaring conflict of interest
given a pending civil suit against the
school district, the district attorney
also serves as its legal counsel. The
fate of the Jena 6 remains unknown,
especially for those who are classi
fied as adults under Louisiana
statute at age 17.
Hie nation is watching Jena now.
Ihe House Judiciary Committee is
scheduled to hold hearings on the case
on Oct. 9. There is a consensus that
hate-crime legislation should cover

nooses, swastikas, burning crosses and
other symbols.
What can you do to help'.' Sign a pe

and stay informed about the case at
freethejena6.org, naacp.org or

the case are clear, il is fundamentally
not a question of black and white, but
of justice.
