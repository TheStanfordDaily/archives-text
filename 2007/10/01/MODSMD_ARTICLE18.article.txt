## Be bold for a better Burma 
### 
Last week, the world's eyes were set
on a little-known Southeast Asian
nation called Burma (official name:
Myanmar), as what began as a peaceful
protest by a few hundred saffron-robed
monks has become a political protest
1 ()(),()()() strong. On Monday and Tuesday,
these peaceful protesters — monks, stu
dents and workers — flocked to the
streets of Rangoon (Yangon). Burma's
largest city, to demand an end to the brutal
military regime that has oppressed the
Burmese people for over four decades.
"Democracy! Democracy!" they cried —
and what is now known as the Saffron
Revolution (named for the color of the
monks' robes) was born.
The wave of protests, which started
more than a month ago, began when the
Burmese government decided to raise gas
prices 500 percent overnight. In a miscalcu
lated move, the Burmese military junta ar
rested and tortured several protesting
monks. In response,monks around the pre
dominantly Buddhist nation organized
themselves and demanded an apology.The
regime refused to apologize, and protests
erupted with a newfound force last week.
What do the Burmese people want?
They want the release of all political pris
oners, including 1991 Nobel Peace laureate
Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation's beloved
and detained democracy advocate. They
want substantive political dialogue with
the military regime. They want a halt to all
human rights violations, an end to the de
struction of villages, a stop to child soldier
ing.'lTiey want.in short, what we all want —
democracy, peace and safety.
These are things the military junta re
fuses to give its people. As it dishes com
mands from its isolated jungle bunker far
from the capital city, the military junta also
carefully censors what information the
media obtains. According to Reporters
Without Borders and the Burmese Media
Association, about 10 Burmese reporters
have been attacked or banned from work

ing. including reporters from Reuters. Ac
cess to the Internet has been shut down in
Burma, and the police have been instruct
ed to search pedestrians and confiscate all
photographic and recording devices. Dur
ing this revolution, the military junta has
reported 10 deaths — but protesters report
far higher numbers.
Besides censorship, which has long
been an issue in the country — which
shares borders with India. China and
Thailand — the regime has responded to
the protest with characteristic force. Sol
diers have been sent to Rangoon from the
eastern part of the country where they
had been engaging in an ethnic-cleansing
war against Burma's Karen minority.
Burma's regime has destroyed twice as
many villages in eastern Burma as have
been attacked in Darfur. Sudan.
The original small protests were led by
an older generation of student leaders —
many of whom participated in the 1988 up
rising against political oppression and eco
nomic depression that resulted in a report
ed 3,000 deaths and 10,000 imprisonments.
At a time when the Burmese people peace
fully stood up to tyranny, the international
community shrugged its shoulders and of
fered little support.
Following the 1988 uprising, a new mili
tary junta took over, but nothing changed.
In 1990, the government surprisingly al
lowed free and fair elections to take place.
The National League for Democracy, a
party led by Suu Kyi. won 82 percent of the
vote. The government, however, declared
the election void and placed Suu Kyi under
house arrest, where she has remained for
12 of the last 18 years. Last week, authori
ties moved the aging woman from her fam
ily compound in Rangoon to the infamous
Insein prison, where other recently arrest
ed democracy leaders are being held and
likely tortured.
Although similar to the 1988 protests,
the current demonstrations are different in
a number of critical ways. First, the protests

are currently being led by monks, not stu
dents as in l l >BB. Monks are greatly revered
in Burmese society, and the government is
less likely to use force against them. An at
tack could escalate the protests further.
Second, the onset of modern technology
has allowed the world to monitor what is
happening more effectively. Although
Burma has sealed the country off to most
foreign journalists, Burmese journalists
and citizens are risking their lives by sneak
ing videos, text and photos to exile groups
through cell phones and the Internet.
Third, the international community is
paying close attention to the situation —
finally. Britain, Canada and France have all
warned the government against using vio
lence and have called for reconciliation.
Nobel Peace Prize recipients, led by South
Africa's Desmond Tutu and the Dalai
I.armi, have led the charge calling for more
sanctions against Burma and action by the
United Nations Security Council. Presi
dent George W. Bush, in his address to the
UN last week, offered his support to the
democracy demonstrators in Burma. He
called for new sanctions on Burmese lead
ers and, more importantly, for every gov
ernment around the world to use econom
ic and political leverage to encourage
change in the volatile country. In addition,
UN Envoy Ibrahim Gambari was sent to
Burma and met with government officials
last week; however, he did not meet with
the two top leaders.
For the sake of the Burmese people, let
us hope that the UN continues to act. And
please — for Burma,for Darfur.for human
rights abuses across the globe — please
take it upon yourselves to act. Visit the US
( ampaign for Burma's Web site (www.us
campaignforburma.org) and sign a petition
or write a letter. And visit White Plaza later
this week as Stanford students don their
own saffron-colored clothing and join the
monks in support of a new, free Burma.
