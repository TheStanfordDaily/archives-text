## Women blitz Bruins Stanford beats No. 5 UCLA a day after topping No. 4 USC 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
hosted two highly-ranked conference rivals last
week and protected its undefeated record, im
proving to 14-0, 3-0 Pac-10. Perhaps more im
pressive, though, the Cardinal made it look easy.
After dispatching No. 4 USC (13-1, 3-1) in
three games, 30-21, 30-27, 30-21, on Thursday
night, Stanford swept N0.5 UCLA (13-2,3-1) the
next night, 30-20,30-23,31-29.
"We knew they were really good," head coach
John Dunningsaid."! thought our team did a nice
job of getting ready and knew them very well.
There is lots of motivation on our team, general
ly for the season and also specifically for USC,
after they beat us at home so badly last year."
This time, the Trojans and Bruins were both
overwhelmed by the three-pronged attack of
freshman outside hitter Alix Klineman, junior
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza and junior mid
dle blocker Foluke Akinradewo.
Klineman and Akinradewo each averaged
about five kills per game, and Barboza chipped in
more than four. Akinradewo had only two errors
to go with her 30 kills on the weekend, hitting
.596.
The UCLA match turned out to be a defen
sive tilt, with neither team yielding a kill easily.
The Cardinal won by far the longest rally of its
season — nearly a minute of back-and-forth ac
tion — midway through the third game.
"We have worked very hard on defense,"
Dunning said. "And 1 think in both matches we
played excellent defense. We dug some great
balls and also the ones that we should dig. Very
few balls are dropping right now because we are
learning to play together, and we also have great
effort and concentration in the back row."
Four players on each team recorded double
digit digs in the match, which saw the Cardinal
and Bruins combine for 158. Stanford's 87 was its
highest total of the season and over 30 more than
in its five-game win over No. 3 Penn State two
weeks ago.
Klineman and UCLA libero Jade Machado
recorded 19 digs each to lead their teams. For
Stanford, Barboza and senior setter Bryn Kehoe

each had 17, and freshman libero Gabi Ailes con
tributed 14.
The Stanford block was also a major factor in
the victory, stuffing five balls in game one and
eight overall while slowing down several Bruins
attacks to help their diggers.
Stanford wasted no time claiming a first-game
lead over the Bruins, who had won a five-gamer
at No. 10 California the night before. Stanford
reeled off the first four points of the match, in
cluding a service ace by junior opposite Erin
Waller.
"We knew we did not start fast against Cal,
and it hurt us," Dunning said of Stanford's four
game win last week. "So we tried to start fast in
both matches this week, and we did a good job of
that."
UCLA finally got on the board, but the Cardi
nal would not be stopped, pushing its lead to dou
ble digits at 17-7 on a pair of Barboza kills. Stan
ford led by as much as 13 and eventually won the
game 30-20 on a Bruin's service error.
Stanford opened the second game with anoth
er quick run, scoring three points on a kill by
Klineman and two by Akinradewo. UCLA
fought back to tie at 10 and then 11 before a five
point Stanford run. Klineman scored four of the
five with kills, the fifth being a Barboza ace. The
Bruins stayed close but could not even the score,
and Stanford won 30-23 on an Akinradewo kill.
UCLA led for the first time in the match at the
start of the third game, with three straight service
aces by Juliane Piggott. Stanford fought back into
a tie, but UCLA again pulled out in front, leading
by as much as five. Trailing 27-22, Stanford
stepped up its game with five in a row to tie.
Stanford staged a similar comeback in its win
over Cal, overcoming a six-point deficit to win the
game on a 10-2 run.
"Once you do it once and you know that you
are capable, odds are you can do it again," Dun
ning said. "Against UCLA, we knew the situation
we were in, and we had just been there and been
successful. So we did not get anxious or upset or
nervous; we just played, and we played better."

klineman had a match-high 19
kills, just three short of her career
best, and 19 digs. Akinradewo tallied
12 kills on .500 hitting and notched
six blocks to go with a career-high

17 digs, while Kehoe also had 17 digs
and dished out 51 assists, with five
blocks as well.
The only bad news from the
weekend's sweeps is the loss of red
shirt sophomore Alex Fisher, who
fell and jammed her wrist against
USC and wore a splint on her left
hand the next night.
"She was playing great," Dunning
said. "She went in and changed the
game against DSC with a block and
four kills. She has just been getting
better and better. We know she is out
for a little while, but she is going to a
doctor who specializes in hands and
wrists to get it checked out early this

The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
hosted two highly-ranked conference rivals last
week and protected its undefeated record, im
proving to 14-0, 3-0 Pac-10. Perhaps more im
pressive, though, the Cardinal made it look easy.
After dispatching No. 4 USC (13-1, 3-1) in
three games, 30-21, 30-27, 30-21, on Thursday
night, Stanford swept N0.5 UCLA (13-2,3-1) the
next night, 30-20,30-23,31-29.
"We knew they were really good," head coach
John Dunningsaid."! thought our team did a nice
job of getting ready and knew them very well.
There is lots of motivation on our team, general
ly for the season and also specifically for USC,
after they beat us at home so badly last year."
This time, the Trojans and Bruins were both
overwhelmed by the three-pronged attack of
freshman outside hitter Alix Klineman, junior
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza and junior mid
dle blocker Foluke Akinradewo.
Klineman and Akinradewo each averaged
about five kills per game, and Barboza chipped in
more than four. Akinradewo had only two errors
to go with her 30 kills on the weekend, hitting
.596.
The UCLA match turned out to be a defen
sive tilt, with neither team yielding a kill easily.
The Cardinal won by far the longest rally of its
season — nearly a minute of back-and-forth ac
tion — midway through the third game.
"We have worked very hard on defense,"
Dunning said. "And 1 think in both matches we
played excellent defense. We dug some great
balls and also the ones that we should dig. Very
few balls are dropping right now because we are
learning to play together, and we also have great
effort and concentration in the back row."
Four players on each team recorded double
digit digs in the match, which saw the Cardinal
and Bruins combine for 158. Stanford's 87 was its
highest total of the season and over 30 more than
in its five-game win over No. 3 Penn State two
weeks ago.
Klineman and UCLA libero Jade Machado
recorded 19 digs each to lead their teams. For
Stanford, Barboza and senior setter Bryn Kehoe

each had 17, and freshman libero Gabi Ailes con
tributed 14.
The Stanford block was also a major factor in
the victory, stuffing five balls in game one and
eight overall while slowing down several Bruins
attacks to help their diggers.
Stanford wasted no time claiming a first-game
lead over the Bruins, who had won a five-gamer
at No. 10 California the night before. Stanford
reeled off the first four points of the match, in
cluding a service ace by junior opposite Erin
Waller.
"We knew we did not start fast against Cal,
and it hurt us," Dunning said of Stanford's four
game win last week. "So we tried to start fast in
both matches this week, and we did a good job of
that."
UCLA finally got on the board, but the Cardi
nal would not be stopped, pushing its lead to dou
ble digits at 17-7 on a pair of Barboza kills. Stan
ford led by as much as 13 and eventually won the
game 30-20 on a Bruin's service error.
Stanford opened the second game with anoth
er quick run, scoring three points on a kill by
Klineman and two by Akinradewo. UCLA
fought back to tie at 10 and then 11 before a five
point Stanford run. Klineman scored four of the
five with kills, the fifth being a Barboza ace. The
Bruins stayed close but could not even the score,
and Stanford won 30-23 on an Akinradewo kill.
UCLA led for the first time in the match at the
start of the third game, with three straight service
aces by Juliane Piggott. Stanford fought back into
a tie, but UCLA again pulled out in front, leading
by as much as five. Trailing 27-22, Stanford
stepped up its game with five in a row to tie.
Stanford staged a similar comeback in its win
over Cal, overcoming a six-point deficit to win the
game on a 10-2 run.
"Once you do it once and you know that you
are capable, odds are you can do it again," Dun
ning said. "Against UCLA, we knew the situation
we were in, and we had just been there and been
successful. So we did not get anxious or upset or
nervous; we just played, and we played better."

Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo nabs a kill in the Cardinal's win over UCLA on Fri
day. Stanford is currently undefeated at 1 4-0 and is ranked No. 2 in the country.
29-28 and closed out the match with
kills by Barboza and Akinradewo.
klineman had a match-high 19
kills, just three short of her career
best, and 19 digs. Akinradewo tallied
12 kills on .500 hitting and notched
six blocks to go with a career-high
seven digs. Barboza had 11 kills and
17 digs, while Kehoe also had 17 digs
and dished out 51 assists, with five
blocks as well.
The only bad news from the
weekend's sweeps is the loss of red
shirt sophomore Alex Fisher, who
fell and jammed her wrist against
USC and wore a splint on her left
hand the next night.
"She was playing great," Dunning
said. "She went in and changed the
game against DSC with a block and
four kills. She has just been getting
better and better. We know she is out
for a little while, but she is going to a
doctor who specializes in hands and
wrists to get it checked out early this
week."
The Cardinal will be back in ac
tion on the road this week at Oregon
State (8-8, 1-3) and No. 21 Oregon
(14-2, 3-1) on Thursday and Friday.
Both matches will be broadcast live
on KZSU.
