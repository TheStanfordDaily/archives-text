## Tresidder tradition closes doors CoHo permanently closed after Old Union remodel, no plans yet for filling empty space 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Unaware of the impending demise of the Coffee House
(Col lo),students left campus last June oblivious to the fact
that a favorite meeting spot and student concert venue was
cleaning its crepe griddle for the last time.
But the Col lo's closing was anticipated by the Univer
sity administration, if not students, as part of Old Union
renovations. Last week witnessed the opening of a new

campus eatery, the Axe & Palm, inside the refurbished
building.
As for the CoHo, Assistant Dean and Director of Stu
dent Unions Jeanette Smith-Laws said the administration
had not decided what to do with the newly vacant space,
saying only that it will be reintegrated into Tresidder
Union, where it is located. For now, it just means one fewer
acronym for new freshmen to learn.
The University wanted a dining option available in the
renovated Old Union in order to create a one-stop venue
for student groups.concerts and dining, Smith-Laws said.
"It's not like we're losing it," she said of the CoHo.

The new Axe & Palm eatery (top) begins normal operating hours this week, while the doors of the venerable CoHo
(bottom) are closed. It remains unclear what will take the creperie's place in Tresidder Union.
"We're just creating that ambience
here in the Union."
Students, however, were quick to
point out that the ambience of the
new eatery is not the same as the
eclectic feel of the Col 10.
"It's more like a diner than a cof
fee house," said Abimbola Dairo '10.
Rachel Sampson '10 called the
new eatery "a better Late Nite,"citing
similar greasy foods and operational
hours until 2 a.m.
Both students said they were re
serving judgment until they had tried

the Axe & Palm a few more times, but
they agreed that the new cafe has
faster service and more seating space
than the Col 10, though it lacks the co
siness of the older venue.
For many, the comfortable dim
ness of the CoHo and the promise of
seeing familiar faces made the Tresid
der space a favorite haunt. Now, up
perclassmen complain that the only
faces you'll see at the Axe & Palm are
ruddy freshmen.
"The CoHo was a great place to
meet people for group projects," said
Nina Joshi '09. She doubted that the
Axe & Palm would be able to repli
cate the lively yet productive atmos
phere of its predecessor.
Chris Butler, a development asso
ciate at the Office of Development,

said he missed the crepes but gave
the Axe & Palm an overall thumbs
up.
"It doesn't have the same charac
ter, but the food's good, "he said. "The
breakfast*selections are my favorite."
The menu items are based on the
results of student surveys, said Snuth-
Laws, who promised that "the menu
will evolve like the programs" in the
new Union.
A student-composed program
board for the Old Union space will
convene by the second week of Octo
ber to organize activities and pro
gramming for the new Old Union, in
cludinu the Axe & Palm.
