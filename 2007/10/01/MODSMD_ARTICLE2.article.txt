## Tresidder tradition closes doors CoHo permanently closed after Old Union remodel, no plans yet for filling empty space 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Unaware of the impending demise of the Coffee House
(Col lo),students left campus last June oblivious to the fact
that a favorite meeting spot and student concert venue was
cleaning its crepe griddle for the last time.
But the Col lo's closing was anticipated by the Univer
sity administration, if not students, as part of Old Union
renovations. Last week witnessed the opening of a new

campus eatery, the Axe & Palm, inside the refurbished
building.
As for the CoHo, Assistant Dean and Director of Stu
dent Unions Jeanette Smith-Laws said the administration
had not decided what to do with the newly vacant space,
saying only that it will be reintegrated into Tresidder
Union, where it is located. For now, it just means one fewer
acronym for new freshmen to learn.
The University wanted a dining option available in the
renovated Old Union in order to create a one-stop venue
for student groups.concerts and dining, Smith-Laws said.
"It's not like we're losing it," she said of the CoHo.
