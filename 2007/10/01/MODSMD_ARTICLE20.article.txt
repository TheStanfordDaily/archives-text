## Edwards gets win in first NFL start 
### 
Former Cardinal quarterback
Trent Edwards is a long way from the
2006 Stanford football season. In his
first career NFL start, Edwards led
the previously winless Buffalo Bills
to a spirited 17-14 victory yesterday
over the New York Jets, showing
both poise and ability in passing for
234 yards, a touchdown and an inter
ception on 22-28 attempts.
Edwards started the game in
place of Bills quarterback J.P. Los
man, who missed the contest because
of a sprained left knee.
Ironically. Edwards teamed with
former Cal star running back Mar
shawn Lynch, who scored a touch
down of his own in the contest.
Edwards may assume the starting
position from this point on — even if
Losman returns healthy — as Bills
head coach Dick Jauron hinted when
speaking to the media.
"I've always said, nobody's job is
secure," Jauron said. "From week to
week, we play whoever we think is
the best guy. So we'll see where it
goes."
Although Edwards looked poised
and confident in winning the Bills
their first game of the year, he com
mented on the work it took to pre
pare for the first start of his profes
sional career.
"It was a long week of practice
both mentally and physically," he
said to NFL.com reporter Chris
Brown."lt was a lot harder than any
thing I've ever been through with the
game of football. For all that hard
work and extra hours that I've put in,
from being the guy that's going to be
in there from the start was something
that was very, very enjoyable after
the game."
