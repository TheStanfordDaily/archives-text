# Cardinal can't break deadlock
## Missed opportunities hurt Stanford in 0-0 tie 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
"We'll head to overtime" is the
mantra of the season thus far for the
Stanford men's soccer team. Four of
the Cardinal's eight pre-conference
play matches have gone into two
overtime periods. Stanford (3-2-3)
lost one of these to No. 16 University
of San Francisco on Sept. 16, though
the Card tied No. 20 UC Santa Bar
bara, No. 6 Santa Clara and, most re
cently, an unranked College of
Charleston.
Stanford had home-field advan
tage in the meeting with the Cougars
(6-1-1) on Friday hut was unable to
nail down a win despite 21 shots. The
Cardinal and College of Charleston
drew 0-0 after 110 minutes of play.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro, who

leads Stanford in scoring with four
goals this season, attributed much of
the Cardinal's unproductive offensive
outing to a bit of bad luck.
"Obviously we outshot
Charleston," Shapiro noted. "Our

failure to score came in part from a
strong performance by [the Cougars']
goalkeeper and in part from a few un
lucky missed opportunities."

was not able to convert on any of its numerous opportunities.
