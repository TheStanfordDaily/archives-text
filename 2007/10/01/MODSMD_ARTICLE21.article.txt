# Cardinal can't break deadlock
## Missed opportunities hurt Stanford in 0-0 tie 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
"We'll head to overtime" is the
mantra of the season thus far for the
Stanford men's soccer team. Four of
the Cardinal's eight pre-conference
play matches have gone into two
overtime periods. Stanford (3-2-3)
lost one of these to No. 16 University
of San Francisco on Sept. 16, though
the Card tied No. 20 UC Santa Bar
bara, No. 6 Santa Clara and, most re
cently, an unranked College of
Charleston.
Stanford had home-field advan
tage in the meeting with the Cougars
(6-1-1) on Friday hut was unable to
nail down a win despite 21 shots. The
Cardinal and College of Charleston
drew 0-0 after 110 minutes of play.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro, who

leads Stanford in scoring with four
goals this season, attributed much of
the Cardinal's unproductive offensive
outing to a bit of bad luck.
"Obviously we outshot
Charleston," Shapiro noted. "Our

failure to score came in part from a
strong performance by [the Cougars']
goalkeeper and in part from a few un
lucky missed opportunities."

Sophomore Michael Strickland runs past a College of Charleston opponent
in a match played last Friday. The game ended in a stalemate as the Cardinal
was not able to convert on any of its numerous opportunities.
The first of these missed opportu
nities came just 4:56 into play when
sophomore forward Thiago Sa
Freire's opening shot went high. Sa
Freire tried again at the 23:47 mark
but was stopped by Charleston keep
er Corbin Waller. The Cardinal came
up empty-handed in five quick at
tempts before the halftime whistle.
In the final three minutes of the
opening period, junior Michael
Alexander's shot was blocked to
Shapiro, whose launch hit the frame
before Waller snagged the save. Red
shirt senior Kyle Hency had the next
go, missing wide at 43:02. Next, a cor
ner kick by sophomore midfielder
Michael Strickland found senior mid
fielder and defender Ryan Imamura,
who was again stopped by Waller, and
the Cougars' goalie thwarted Hency's

last attempt from the right side with
another save.
After the break. Stanford seemed
to maintain its offensive momentum,
keeping possession for most of the
period in College of Charleston's
territory. Freshman forward Bobby
Warshaw had five of the Cardinal's
nine second-half shots, including
back-to-back attempts at 68: l l ) and
70:57. Waller got to the first, a power
ful look from beyond the 18-yard
box, and the second missed just wide
of the posts.
Regulation ended in much the
same manner; Stanford's dominance
was interrupted only briefly by
breaks from the Cougars, though
both teams were still unable to find
the net. In a now-familiar position,
the Card — who has yet to score in
overtime play — found itself with
five more opportunities in the two 10-
minute extensions but could not con
vert.
Throughout the game, the Stan
ford defense limited Charleston to

just 11 shots, including only three
from leading scorer Kareem Year
wood.Hiis effort helped senior goalie
Andrew Kartunen register his fourth
shutout of the season, with two shots
on goal saved in the second half. The
Cougars' keeper Waller had a busier
night with nine saves.
Shapiro was not disappointed with
Stanford's overall play.
"1 thought the team played very
well at times against a strong
Charleston team," he said. '"Defen
sively. we were able to shut down one
of the most feared attackers in the
country [in Yearwood], and, offen
sively, we kept decent possession of
the ball."
With another tie in the record
books, Stanford looks for the chance
to prove itself in Pac-10 conference
play, which will open Oct. 5 with a
home game against Oregon State at
5:00 p.m.
