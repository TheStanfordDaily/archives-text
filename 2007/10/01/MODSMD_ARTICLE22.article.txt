### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's soccer team strung together a pair
of victories this weekend, first defeating the University of San Fran
cisco 3-1 on Friday before dismantling St. Mary's, 4-1, on Sunday.
Redshirt senior midfielder Shari Summers and freshman forward
Christen Press each scored twice and recorded an assist in the two
games.
The Cardinal (9-1-0) bounced right back to its best form after
suffering its first defeat of the season the week before against Den
ver. Any lingering memories of the loss were dispelled within the
first few minutes of the USF game. Summers converted a penalty
kick just 3:03 into the contest, giving Stanford a 1 -0 lead after Press
had been taken down in the box while going after a cross from
sophomore forward Ali Riley.
The Cardinal dominated the rest of the half against the Dons (0-
6-3) but did not score again until Summers was wrestled down at
the top of the USF box near the end of the first period. Summers
dusted herself off. stepped up and bent the resulting free kick over
the wall and into the left side of the goal.
