### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's soccer team strung together a pair
of victories this weekend, first defeating the University of San Fran
cisco 3-1 on Friday before dismantling St. Mary's, 4-1, on Sunday.
Redshirt senior midfielder Shari Summers and freshman forward
Christen Press each scored twice and recorded an assist in the two
games.
The Cardinal (9-1-0) bounced right back to its best form after
suffering its first defeat of the season the week before against Den
ver. Any lingering memories of the loss were dispelled within the
first few minutes of the USF game. Summers converted a penalty
kick just 3:03 into the contest, giving Stanford a 1 -0 lead after Press
had been taken down in the box while going after a cross from
sophomore forward Ali Riley.
The Cardinal dominated the rest of the half against the Dons (0-
6-3) but did not score again until Summers was wrestled down at
the top of the USF box near the end of the first period. Summers
dusted herself off. stepped up and bent the resulting free kick over
the wall and into the left side of the goal.
San Francisco got on the board in the early stages of the second
half — Jenny Jarvie scored a PK after Saniantha Brand was tripped

in the box by Stanford's Marisa Abegg
— but Stanford held the ball for much
of the rest of the game and added an
insurance goal, a header from junior
defender Allison Falk, in the dying
minutes to ice the victory.
The Cardinal took a little longer to
crack open the St. Mar> s (4-5-2) de
fense on Sunday. Senior forward Lizzy
George saw a close-range header bat
ted away by Gaels goalkeeper Tara
Lawson before sophomore midfielder
Alicia Jenkins had a shot cleared off
the line by a defender.
Stanford's breakthrough came in
the 22nd minute of the game thanks to
a brilliant piece of individual skill from

Press. The freshman gathered a pass
from Summers at the left corner of the
18-yard box before cutting inside and
lashing a right-footed shot off the un
derside of the crossbar and into the far
corner.
About 20 minutes later. Press
played a role in the Cardinal's second
goal, when she received a pass and
skipped past a defender on the left side
of the box. When Lawson rushed out
to save her shot,she could only deflect
the ball into the path of Stanford mid
fielder Morgan Redman, who scored
on an empty-net header.
The Cardinal sandwiched another
two goals around a St. Mary's score in
the second half. Redshirt senior de
fender Rachel Buehler dove to head in
an improbable goal off a corner kick
before Press notched her second of the
day, redirecting a Kristin Stannard
shot into the goal after a wild minute

that featured four Stanford shots and
another goal-line clearance from the
Gaels defense.
Stanford lost the No. 1 national
ranking after losing to Denver last
week, but tl»c team could regain it
when the new National Soccer Coach
es Association of America (NSCAA)
poll comes out on Tuesday.The Cardi
nal was the only team among the top
four to win both games this weekend.
No. 1 Santa Clara lost 2-0 to Cal on
Sunday, while No. 2 Portland and No. 3
Texas A&M fell on Friday. Portland
was defeated 2-1 by No. 8 UCLA in
overtime, while Texas A&M lost 3-2 to
Missouri in a Big XII match-up.
The Cardinal returns to the field
next Friday night when it hosts Santa
Clara.
