### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Plenty happened in the Cardinal's 41-3 loss to Ari
zona State Saturday night. Coaches yelled. Players
played. Fans cheered.
But, to put it short. Stanford could not run the toot
hall.
ITie end result was identical to that of every Pac-10
game this year so far: the Cardinal hung tough for the
tirst half before a talented and ranked opponent ran
away.
Unlike his demeanor after many of the team's previ
ous games, coach Jim Harbaugh did not reference a sil
ver lining after Saturday's loss to the Sun Devils.
"My one disappointment tonight is that 1 don't feel
we got better.and that's the first time I've felt that," I lar
baugh said."lt was such thorough ineffectiveness on our
part, you can't point to one phase and say that was the
reason." he said. "It was just thorough on all levels —
the way we executed, the way we coached."
Stanford rushed for minus-two yards on 2f> carries.

Toby Gerhart were on the sidelines didn't help, nor did
