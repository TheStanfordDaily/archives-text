# CARD BURNED IN LOSS TO ASU
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Plenty happened in the Cardinal's 41-3 loss to Ari
zona State Saturday night. Coaches yelled. Players
played. Fans cheered.
But, to put it short. Stanford could not run the toot
hall.
ITie end result was identical to that of every Pac-10
game this year so far: the Cardinal hung tough for the
tirst half before a talented and ranked opponent ran
away.
Unlike his demeanor after many of the team's previ
ous games, coach Jim Harbaugh did not reference a sil
ver lining after Saturday's loss to the Sun Devils.
"My one disappointment tonight is that 1 don't feel
we got better.and that's the first time I've felt that," I lar
baugh said."lt was such thorough ineffectiveness on our
part, you can't point to one phase and say that was the
reason." he said. "It was just thorough on all levels —
the way we executed, the way we coached."
Stanford rushed for minus-two yards on 2f> carries.
The fact that injured left tackle Allen Smith and tailback
Toby Gerhart were on the sidelines didn't help, nor did

Sophomore cornerback Chris Hobbs fumbles during a punt return in the second quarter of Stanford's 41 -3 loss to Arizona State on
Saturday. The Cardinal will face an even greater opponent this coming weekend when it matches up against No. 1 USC.
senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander's minus-39 yards on
seven sacks.
However, Stanford (1-3,0-3 Pac-10) ran just fine with
junior Anthony Kimble and freshman Jeremy Stewart
only a week before against an Oregon defense easily as
stout as Arizona State's (5-0,2-0 Pac-10) unit.
The Cardinal set season lows in announced atten
dance (32,125), total yards (235) and sacks allowed
(seven). Over its last six quarters of play, Stanford has
managed just 22 rushing yards and three points, a stretch
reminiscent of last year's season.
Ostrander made it clear that the team is different from
the 2006 squad, however.
"People are going to look and say, 'Oh. there's Stan
ford again,"' Ostrander said. "But we're not like that.
We're better than that. If we're going to represent this
school, we have to represent it better than we did
tonight."
A young defense that started six underclassmen and
just two seniors played its heart out for a half on Satur
day. Arizona State's average starting field position on its
first six possessions was its 41 yard line. Somehow, Stan
ford's defense held the Devils to two Thomas Weber field
goals, and the Cardinal was within 6-0 after the first 27
minutes.
Then Rudy Burgess broke the dam.The agile receiver
— a converted tailback — caught a 3rd-and-8 crossing
route that Stanford's linebacking corps didn't have the
speed to stop. About 62 yards later, Stanford's secondary
hadn't caught Burgess either, and the Devils led 14-0 —
after a two-point conversion — with 2:27 left in the first
half.
On Stanford's next snap, Ostrander misfired to soph
omore wide receiver Richard Sherman on a slant left, and
Omar Bolden returned the tipped ball untouched for a
pick-six. Ostrander did bounce back with an impressive
drive, however, leading a hurry-up offense to a 42-yard
Derek Belch field goal,cutting the Devils' lead to 21-3 —
a lead they would not relinquish.
"When you get down early, you put yourself in a posi
tion where you have to pass, you have to pass," junior
guard Alex Fletcher said. "And that's what it came down
to today. It was kind of just 'Get back on your heels and
see what you see' because they were bringing guys at us."
The deficit only grew as Arizona State scored on its
first four second-half possessions. Weber hit two more
field goals in the third, then Dmitri Nance and Keegan
Herring broke long touchdown runs of 17 and 72 yards
respectively, breaking the Cardinal defense's back in the
fourth quarter.
"Those big plays killed us," senior defensive end Chris
Horn said."Those little mental breakdowns are killing us.
To allow a 70-yard run — mental breakdown. Somebody
was supposed to be outside and they weren't, so they hit
it."
In the end, a litany of mistakes — three turnovers, two
missed Belch field goals, an inability to field squib kicks
— and the offense's lead boots mattered more than Stan
ford's first half-effort.
Ultimately, though, Stanford was physically out
matched against UCLA, Oregon and Arizona State, and
the team obviously faces the tallest of odds in this Satur
day's visit to No. 1 USC.
This team, therefore, will write its legacy in October
and November in winnable games against Arizona,
Washington State and. strangely, Notre Dame.
"I think we have enough leaders on this team who are
going to take this as an opportunity, as a challenge," Os

trander said. "Next week is a work week. You might be a
student-athlete, but you better be spending some serious
time on football. I think if we do that, we'll get better as a
team."
