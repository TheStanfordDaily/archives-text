### MELODY DYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Monday, Stanford acquired the entire
radio archive of New Dimensions Media â€” a
collection comprising thousands of hours of
historic interviews with public figures such as
Maya Angelou, Bill Moyers and the Dalai
Lama. Stanford is currently discussing the
possibility of making the archive publicly
available online.
"This archive will complement and enrich
our long-standing collections," said Roberto
Trujillo. head of the Department of Special
Collections and University Archives at the
Stanford University Libraries, adding that
there will be "a wealth of new content for stu
dents to examine and study."
New Dimensions is an independent, listen
er-supported organization that spotlights inno
vative and diverse viewpoints on a wide array of
cultural topics through its flagship radio show.
The program, which runs weekly on public
radio, reaches over 300 community venues in the

U.S., including San Francisco's KALW.9I.7 FM. It reach
es another 200-300 stations globally and is also available
through Internet and satellite radio.
New Dimensions co-founder Michael Toms said the
program is meant to address "cultural shifts and chang
ing landscapes in our society" and to provide a forum for
people to tell their stories in a powerful way.
"With the general media, you uet the idea that the

world's going to hell in a hand basket and there's 110 way
out,"Toms said. "We aim to convey knowledge, but also
hope; the hope in human possibility."
"Hope." he added, "is believing in spite of the evi
dence and working actively to change the evidence."
