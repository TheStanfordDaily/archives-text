# Stanford acquires interview collection
## Thousands of hours of recordings will be digitized, say archivists 
### MELODY DYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Monday, Stanford acquired the entire
radio archive of New Dimensions Media — a
collection comprising thousands of hours of
historic interviews with public figures such as
Maya Angelou, Bill Moyers and the Dalai
Lama. Stanford is currently discussing the
possibility of making the archive publicly
available online.
"This archive will complement and enrich
our long-standing collections," said Roberto
Trujillo. head of the Department of Special
Collections and University Archives at the
Stanford University Libraries, adding that
there will be "a wealth of new content for stu
dents to examine and study."
New Dimensions is an independent, listen
er-supported organization that spotlights inno
vative and diverse viewpoints on a wide array of
cultural topics through its flagship radio show.
The program, which runs weekly on public
radio, reaches over 300 community venues in the

U.S., including San Francisco's KALW.9I.7 FM. It reach
es another 200-300 stations globally and is also available
through Internet and satellite radio.
New Dimensions co-founder Michael Toms said the
program is meant to address "cultural shifts and chang
ing landscapes in our society" and to provide a forum for
people to tell their stories in a powerful way.
"With the general media, you uet the idea that the

world's going to hell in a hand basket and there's 110 way
out,"Toms said. "We aim to convey knowledge, but also
hope; the hope in human possibility."
"Hope." he added, "is believing in spite of the evi
dence and working actively to change the evidence."

The radio broadcasts will be a wel
come addition to the University's
collections. Some of New Dimen
sion's featured guests, such as envi
ronmental activist and inventor R.
Buckminster Fuller and "futurist"
and editor Stewart Brand, already
have papers and published works
archived at Stanford.
Trujillo dismissed Associated
Press reports that Stanford will not
disclose how much it spent acquiring
the collection. In fact, he said, there is
nothing to disclose. According to Tru
jillo, the collection is a deeded gift to
the University,and,while the Univer
sity will house the archive. New Di
mensions will retain all copyrights
and commercial rights.

There are some costs associated
with the acquisition, which Trujillo
said were minimal. Stanford will pay
New Dimensions a nominal fee to
prepare master copies of its record
inns, and the University will also pay
for the housing and upkeep of the
physical archive in its auxiliary li
brary. SAL-3, in Livermore, Calif.
TTie real expense will come in the
form of the digitization project envi
sioned for the archive. The hope is to
convert New Dimensions' over 3,500
interviews from analog to digital for
mat and to make the entire collection
publicly available online. For that,
the University will seek outside fund
ing.
"When we finish this project, the
whole archive will become part of the
public record,"Trujillo said.
The digitized collection, to be
hosted on Stanford servers, will be
accessible through Socrates. Stan
ford's online catalog, and through

public search engines such as
Google.
Both Toms and Trujillo are confi
dent they can secure funding for the
digitization of the archives.
"With the kind of influence Stan
ford wields, it shouldn't be a prob
lem." Toms said.
The two are currently talking with
several organizations, including
Google, to finance the project, and
they plan to apply for grant money.
The project does not yet have a con
crete timeline, but Trujillo expects it
will take several years.
"We're talking about converting
thousands of hours of interviews, so
that's going to take a chunk of time."
he said. "We're going to whittle away
at it, but there's no definite estimate
for when it's going to be publicly
available."
