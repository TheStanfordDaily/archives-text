## New weapon against PIN theft 
### SHELBY MARTIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ATM customers fearful of
"shoulder surfers," low-tech crimi
nals known for stealing PIN codes
by lurking behind users, may no
longer have to worry about finding
emptied bank accounts after they
fail to shield the keypad. A new
technology from Stanford re
searchers can ensure that your PIN
code is for your eyes only.
The program, called Eye Pas
sword. lets A TM customers use their
gaze to type in passwords. An invisi
ble infrared beam tracks users'
pupils as they stare at letters in an
on-screen keyboard.
Eye Password gained recent
media attention when it was fea
tured in the Sept. 17 issue of Busi
ness Week. Manu Kumar M.S. '05,
Ph.D. '07. lead researcher on the
project, described it as an "initial
foray" into using eye gaze tracking

for security applications.
The technology addresses a seri
ous security concern with conven
tional PIN-punching at the ATM.
Unlike linger typing, eye movement
is tough to track,effectively protect
ing ATM customers from shoulder
surfers.
Other alternatives to conven
tional keyboard password entry in
clude biometric strategies, such as
retinal scanning and fingerprint
identification. While such technolo
gies have a satisfyingly futuristic
feel, Kumar explained that they
have one main disadvantage.
"While it's easy to change your
password, it's obviously not so easy
to change your fingerprint or retinal
scan," he wrote in an email to The
Daily.
ATM users can change their
passwords more easily than they
can change their fingerprints. Un
like fingertips, passwords set up
using Eye Password can be changed

at will.
Kumar's team tested Eye Pass
word with 18 subjects in order to
compare error rates in password
entry and the time it took to enter
those passwords. While error rates
with Eye Password and convention
al keyboards were similar, the gaze
tracking technology took between
seven and 10 seconds longer than
conventional PIN entry.
Despite the extra time, over 80
percent of the test subjects said they
preferred Eye Password to conven
tional password entry methods.
Unfortunately, the technology
will not be seen at the corner ATM
anytime soon.
"Eyetrackers currently cost a
lot," Kumar said.
A $25,000 price tag on the de
vices means that widespread adop
tion is not yet practical. But Kumar
said he hopes this will change.
