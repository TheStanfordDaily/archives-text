CI.EAR LAKH OAKS, Calif.
(AP) — As a child in the 19505.
Loretta Kelsey grew up hearing
the sounds of Elem Pomo, an
8.000-year-old dialect spoken by
early peoples of Northern Cali
fornia along the shores of Clear
Lake in Lake County.
Since then, as an older genera
tion passed away, the language
they spoke went with them. Ac
cording to scholars. 59-year-old
Kelsey is the last fluent speaker of
Elem Pomo alive today
But Kelsey is not content to let
her native language die with her.
Instead, she has teamed up with a
prominent University of Califor
nia linguist to teach and docu
ment Elem Pomo to keep its
words — and the culture they
represent) — alive in the 21st
century.
"Our language is really right
here. It's in our ceremonies, our
lives.our people, our ways," Kelsey
said, gesturing to her reservation
along the lake's southern edge.
"You keep the language alive, you
help keep all of this alive."
When Kelsey was growing up,
her mother spoke no English,
only Elem Pomo. At the time,
many members of the 250-person
tribe were fluent. The past
decades have seen members die
off. join new churches or leave the
reservation for jobs.
The tribe traces its origins to
about 6000 B.C. Known for its
basket-weaving and bluegill fish
ing, the Elem Pomo flourished on
the banks of Clear Lake, once oc
cupying KO.(XH) acres. But white
settlers in the IK(XK meant dis
placement and abuse) — 200

Elem Pomo were massacred by the U.S. Army
in 1850 as retaliation for the murder of two
white ranchers.
Three years ago Kelsey's nephew, Robert
Geary, attended a statewide meeting of Indian
tribes interested in preserving their culture. After
Geary returned from the meeting and polled his
tribe members, he determined that Kelsey was
the only fluent Elem Pomo speaker left.
Kelsey and Geary looked to UC Berkeley's
linguistics department for help.
Serendipitously.they were teamed with Pro
fessor Emeritus Leannc Hinton, one of the na
tion's top Pomo language researchers.
Ihe duo found reel-to-reel tapes in the uni
versity's archive featuring Elem Pomo speak
ers, including stories told by Kelsey's father.
"California's tribes have been so fractured
over the years that it's very hard to tell how many
languages are still alive." said Hinton. "What
1 -orctta is doing is special. And for the last speak
er of a language, she's amazingly young."
The relationship has been fruitful for
Kelsey, who has conducted four language
camps for her tribe. Kelsey's also writing a dic
tionary and a phrase handbook, with the help
of Hinton and a couple of other linguists from
the UC system.
