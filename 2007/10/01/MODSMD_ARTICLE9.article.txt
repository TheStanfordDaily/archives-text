### LYNN BERRY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MOSCOW (AP) — Ihe former world chess
champion Garry Kasparov entered Russia's
presidential race on Sunday, elected over
whelmingly as the candidate for the country's
beleaguered opposition coalition.
Kasparov has been a driving force behind
the coalition, which has united liberals, leftists
and nationalists in opposition to President
Vladimir Putin. I Ic received 379 of 498 votes at
a national congress held in Moscow by the
Other Russia coalition, coalition spokeswoman
Lyudmila Mamina told The Associated Press.
Kasparov's place on the March ballot was
not assured. His candidacy still needs to be reg
istered and is likely to be blocked.
Even if he were allowed to run, Kasparov
would not be expected to pose a major chal
lenge to whichever candidate wins Putin's back-

ing.
"The goal of the Other Russia is not winning
elections, but to have an election." Kasparov
told APTelevision News,speaking in English on
the sidelines of the congress. "We're trying to
force the regime to accept our rights to partici
pate in free and fair elections, to agitate the
Russian population and Russian public to sup
port our ideas."
Kasparov argues that Putin's extraordinary
public support hinges on the Kremlin's full con
trol over the electoral process and national tel
evision.
With all major political decisions in Russia
now being made behind closed doors in the
Kremlin, Kasparov stresses the importance for
the Other Russia of following democratic pro
cedures.
In electing Kasparov on Sunday, the coali
tion chose among six candidates who had
won at least one regional primary in recent
months.
Kasparov was followed in Sunday's voting
by Sergei Gulyayev, a former member of St. Pe
tersburg's Legislative Assembly, who received
59 votes, and former Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov with 18, Mamina said.
Ihe Other Russia also chose Kasparov to be

one of three candidates to head the coalition's
list in parliamentary elections in December.The
others are former Central Bank chairman Vik
tor (ierashchenko and Eduard Limonov, a
provocative writer who heads the banned Na
tional Bolshevik Party.
The coalition, however, has virtually no
chance of participating in the election for the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
Only registered political parties can take part
and none of the political movements that make
up the Other Russia qualify.
State Duma seats are distributed among par
ties according to the percentage of the vote they
receive.
In putting forward its candidates on Sunday,
the Other Russia got a jump on United Russia,
the main pro-Kremlin party, which opens its
two-day congress on Monday. United Russia
also is expected to pick its "troika" of candi
dates to head the party list.
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading
party member, said Sunday that Putin could be
considered for the top spot. Putin is constitu
tionally required to step down when his second
term ends next spring, and uncertainty over his
future plans has added to the current political
uneasiness.
