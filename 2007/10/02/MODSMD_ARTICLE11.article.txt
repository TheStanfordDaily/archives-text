WASH INGTON(AP)—Thwart
ed in efforts to bring troops home
from Iraq. Senate Democrats on
Monday helped pass a defense policy
bill authorizing another $150 billion
for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The 92-3 vote comes as the House
planned to approve separate legisla
tion Tuesday that requires President
Bush to give Congress a plan for
eventual troop withdrawals.
The developments underscored
the difficulty facing Democrats in the
Iraq debate: They lack the votes to
pass legislation ordering troops home
and are divided on whether to cut
money for combat, despite a mandate
by supporters to end the war.
