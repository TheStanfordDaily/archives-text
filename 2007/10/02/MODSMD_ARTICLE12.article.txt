## Editorial Board Reconsidering college, again 
### 
This Sunday's "College Issue - ' of Hie
New York Times Magazine included in
its folds a reprinting of journalist Kick
Perlstein's provocative essay, "What's the
Matter With College," as well as the student
response selected by The Times as the win
ner of its College Essay Contest. With the
printing of Yale history student Nicholas
Handler's defense of "Ihe Posteverything
Generation" comes the end of Ihe Times'
sponsored portion of the nationwide debate
on the continuing relevance of a college ex
perience that is unique and distinct from the
professional world that follows it. However,
as our school year begins with management
consulting firms and high-tech start-ups al
ready hegemonizing landscapes once re
served for student-led student life, the issues
analyzed by Perlstein and Handler deserve
sustained consideration.
Perlstein's essay, initially targeted to
wards a student audience with a web launch
and summer release, pushed apocalyptic
statements such as. "College as America
used to understand it is coming to an end,"
and bemoaned the displacement of invigor
ating campus counter-culture with bureau
cratically produced pre professionalism, and
challenged current students to respond to
the question: "Is the college experience less
critical to the nation than it was a generation
ago?" Online forums and college blogs
across America swelled with responses.
Some were indignant at Perlstein's elitist
overtures and his lack of sympathy, or his ig
norance towards the very real financial and
social pressures that color the experience of
today's more economically diverse student
body. Others exhaled a sigh of recognition.
I landler's essay picked up the generation
gap argument and ran with it. I le claims that
our college experience is uniquely post
modern, post-revolutionary, post 9/11 and
everywhere riddled with irony. By casting a
wide post-modern net over everything from
Che Guevara T-shirts to the existential diffi
culty of "rebelling) against a generation that
is expecting, anticipating, nostalgic for revo
lution," Handler issues a defense for a post
literate generation. He is rosy-eyed about
the changes being created by our generation
via a technological revolution that we are
writing "in our own words." Handler's re
sponse is one that Stanford students, often
cast as leading the technological revolution
with our Google-worship and Silicon Valley
sensibilities, are likely to stand behind.
The essay, however, also reveals the mod
ern student's ability to use fine-tuned analyt

ic abilities and problem-solving skills, prod
ucts of elite education, to wriggle out of
philosophical conundrums with sprightly
agility. Behind the post-modern theory. Han
dler's argument swings around an accusa
tion, an excuse and a condescension: l.The
revolutions your generation enjoyed denied
us a chance to crystallize our identities
through genuine rebellion 2. Given the sorry
lot we've been given by history, our genera
tion will have to be excused when we "rebel
by not rebelling" 3. If you just can't see that
today's students are rebelling, it is because
you are old and looking for outdated modes
of revolution.
It is easy to see why Perlstein would have
liked this essay. It echoes the privileged voice,
self-righteous indignation and rebellion ob
sessed rhetoric of the original piece. News
flash:"Rebelling] by not rebelling" is still not
rebelling and only becomes rebelling in the
$40.(KK) a year world of post-modern linguis
tic theory. Handler's paradoxes make good
copy, and do express sentiments that many
students share. But on a more sinister level,
they also reveal our generation's growing
ability to tling the fruits of our elite educa
tions in the faces of those who would criticize
us for misusing them. ITiis ability becomes
particularly dangerous when it leads to self
delusion in addition to wicking off criticism.
Colleges and students are not the same now
as they were in the '60s, the '70s or the '80s.
In response to Perlstein and Handler, a
more honest view may be that our genera
tion is not rebelling: we are too busy "adding
value" to a globalizing economy and "maxi
mizing the utility"' of our own micro
economies. Again, a more sinister view may
be that those codes for corporate capitalism
and binge drinking reveal a marriage that
dominates college life today and brings us in
danger of entering a soma-induced automat
ed dystopia. A more practical view may be
that colleges now are so diverse and niche
marketed that there will be rebels and there
will be technocrats among the student body
just as there will be incubators for anarchists
and policy-makers within our bulging higher
education system.
The "college" that Perlstein refers to is
perhaps obsolete, but similarly antiquated is
the task of trying to sum up America's many
college experiences in a couple of essays. I
close on the same point 1 began with: the rel
evance of college education —or I'll say
what Perlstein really means, a liberal arts ed
ucation — demands the attention of both
the old and the young.
