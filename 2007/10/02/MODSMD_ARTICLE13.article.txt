# IN PURSUIT OF THE EPIC
## The
						true Stanford Challenge 
### 
So, my readers, I come to you today with
a confession: I have thus far failed in my
pursuit of the epic.
"Now Alex," you might say," What about
all that preachy stuff you once spewed,
about being epic and riding bikes no
hands/no feet/no-big deal style, or maybe,
like, more adventurously, romping through
Lake l.agunita or the steam tunnels and
other stuff that you could envision our
friends Harold and Kumar so righteously
approving of?"
Ibat's all fine and good. But right now
I'm talking about Epic with a capital E.
In order to fulfill my mission as the most
epic (alternatively the epicest or epicicest)
student to ever graduate this university, I
have only one aim:To bring Stanford I eland
University Junior (or whatever they call it)
all the way to the tipmost top of the U.S.
News & World Report: America's Best Col
leges rankings (hereafter USN&WR), up
from our embarrassing, near cellar-dwelling
spot at — shudder — number 112 our.
Now my plan is a one-step plan: Elegant
and simple like Maxwell's equations, except
only one instead of four. I am deeply con
vinced that the success of those bad boy. Ivy
league bruisers staring us down from the
top rests in one institution, and one institu
tion only: l"he Secret Society. Skull & Hones,
Scroll & Key. the Pore', the My. St. A s., as
the list goes on a chill runs down my spine.
The movers and shakers of our great nation
— it is through those inexhaustible capital
ist machinations which rumble on. as they
have for centuries, in lavish dining halls be
hind doors which no camera can penetrate,
that the great Ivy l eague universities of our
time have established themselves at the top
of That Vaunted Report.
Yet, we're far from incompetent here in
Palo Alto, birthplace of that Valley of Sili

con. Surely the USN&WR people know
that we created Google and, frankly put,
without CJoogle, not a damn soul would ever
read their bloated and biased report in the
first place! And that's probably why we, at
the very least, made it past those limping ex
cuses for universities trailing behind us in
The Report. Nevertheless, without a Secret
Society to throw around promises of death
and, worse, threats to destroy the Internet,
that elusive number one spot shall remain
perpetually out of reach.
Now you may think I'm making a jerk
out of all of you. "Surely. Alex, you realize
that the biggest and baddest Secret Society
of all is housed in that gigantic phallus mas
querading as a tower, plopped down on
campus somewhere in the vicinity of
MeniAudCome on. guys, you know I'm
hip to the Hoover Institution. But clearly
they don't get the idea, building gigantic
spires visible from the Dumbarton Bridge,
parading our nation's worst ever President
around the campus (and flying in military
choppers to boot), publicizing absurd hiring
decisions like that most recent blunder,
Donald Rumsfeld, and. worst of all.allowing
tourists into their main sanctuary of machi
nation! What could be more antithetical to
the tenets of Secret Society creation, and
preservation?
We need a place, or. better yet. multiple
