## THE
						LOWLY INTERNS I'm just not scandalous enough 
### 
It's hard to be an intern in Washington and
not think of Monica Lewinsky. I'm sorry. 1
know it's been more than 10 years, but here,
now. working in a government internship. I just
can't get it out of my head.
To start with. Monica was 21. I'm painfully
close. And while I'm building up the courage to
flirt with the occasional younger employee. I'm
not exactly scoping out my higher-ups with a
lustful eye. Maybe they just don't have the
mojo Slick Willie did.
But this leads to the other thing 1 just can't
stop thinking about. How the hell did Monica
get access to Bill? First, there's the regimented
schedule.as my anonymous friend pointed out.
"The President is not alone for more than fif
teen minutes at a time during the day."he said.
" Ihat means Monica had to be Speedy Gonza
lez." If you don't get it. 11l tell you when you're
older.
Second, not only did Monica have to be fast
then, it also means that there were tons of peo
ple who knew exactly what was going on. Any
one who has worked in government or any big
corporation can tell you that there are assis

tants, secretaries and handlers all over the
place, and you don't see the big boss without
going through them. It's really hard to get ap
pointments with people above your direct su
pervisor, and I don't work anywhere near as
important as the White House. (I'd tell you
where I do work but I want to make it to at
least the third week before getting fired. Writ
ing about your office in conjunction with Mon
ica can get you fired. Which shows the lingering
effect of the scandal.)
Sure, we can excuse the Secret Service, but
as those of you who watch 'I"he West Wing
know, there is at least a secretary and a person
al assistant immediately outside the Oval Of
fice whenever the president is in.There's also a
Chief of Staff, cabinet advisors, and countless
others going in and out of meetings with and
around the President. Among this parade of
puffy politicians, we interns are pretty faceless,
blending seamlessly into the background, but
still. I guess everyone just kind of laughed it off
with an "Oh. Bill" sort of chuckle.
Maybe nobody cared because this sort of
thing does happen all the time, and 1 just

haven't been working long enough to witness
it. Or maybe I'm just not a 21-year old female,
attracting all sorts of attention from older men,
which in her case was apparently embraced.
Maybe she was trying really hard. Maybe I'm
just incredibly unattractive.
Sex scandals without interns do happen all
the time, and I guess when you're not the pres
ident, it's easier to apologize, duck under the
radar or blackmail people into silence. As infa
mous as the infidelity and hypocrisy of Mark
Foley, Newt Gingrich, Larry Craig, and David
Vitter should be. in a few years their personal
lives might still be a wreck, but the national
name recognition will have dissipated. Already
forgot those sex scandals? Point made. Inci
dentally, all of these guys are Republicans, and
after thinking hard for a few minutes, I just
couldn't come up with any Democrats other
than Clinton. ITiere must be some, so let me
know if you think of any. Maybe they were for
gotten even faster.
leaving Monica for a second, one scandal
