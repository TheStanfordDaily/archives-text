Two recent controversial events —
Iranian president Mahmoud Ah
niadinejad's Sept. 24 speech at Colum
bia University and former Secretary of De
fense Donald Rumsfeld s appointment as a
"distinguished visiting fellow" at our own
Hoover Institution — raise related questions
about morality, free speech and academic
freedom. Liberal professors and students on
campus have started a petition opposing
Rumsfeld's appointment. Meanwhile, con
servatives generally applauded the Hoover
Institution's appointment while strongly op
posing Columbia's decision to invite Ah

madinejad to speak on campus. Both groups
cited "academic freedom," but the hypocrisy
is clear: politics was the driving factor.
Separating the two speakers is difficult —
one would think that academic freedom
would encompass the situations of both.This
is not to say that Rumsfeld and Ahmadinejad
are the same, or that their actions in the pub
lic forum can even be compared. One. howev
er controversial, was appointed by the presi
dent to a high post in the Cabinet, the other is
the Holocaust-denying leader of a dictator
ship. In both cases, however, the respective
university's prestige and brand are on the

line.
Not only is there a question of academic
freedom, hut, more specifically, the role of
universities in promoting this academic free
dom Universities — large institutions with
opinionated professors and students — invit
ed these figures to campus. Columbia was de
monized by Fox News and other conservative
news outlets, while Stanford has been con
demned by a group of liberal professors and
scores of alumni. These reactions show that
universities' obligations to protect and en-
courage academic freedom comes at
a great cost. In light of this cost, one
must question how strong that obli
gation should be.
Ahmadinejad runs a country that
is clearly a state sponsor of terrorism.
He's denied the Holocaust, and he
consistently refers to the United
States as "Great Satan." During his
visit to Columbia, he claimed there
were no homosexuals in Iran, dis
missing homosexuality as a Western
"phenomenon." Rumsfeld, while ob
viously not as inflammatory as Ah
madinejad, was roundly criticized
during his tenure as Secretary of De
fense by Republicans and Democ
rats alike,including a group of retired
generals and Senator John McCain
(R-Ariz.).
Should either Columbia or Stan
ford have put their reputations on
the line by sponsoring the presence
of these figures on their campuses?
While neither university endorses
the actions of their respective guests,
they are inevitably associated with
these men. Consequently, this associ
ation can sully their reputations.
Right-wing commentators made a
fake, but legitimate-looking Web site
for the "Columbia University School
of Terrorism." Any talk of "academic
freedom" and "free speech" certain

ly pales in the face of such sharp rhet
oric, and Columbia comes off look
ing much worse for it.
Universities are not selfless insti
tutions devoted to providing a place
for free speech. A university is an in
stitution with its own interests and
obligations. Accordingly, having
highly controversial figures appear
on campus inevitably leads to prob
lems — universities' overall mission
of educating students might be im
paired by the debate generated by
inviting controversial speakers.
Stanford is one of the most presti
gious universities in the world,
known across all fields for academic
excellence, but that reputation does
not come easily .The University must
maintain its reputation and attract
top students and faculty. Some of
them will inevitably be turned off by
extremely divisive speakers. The
prestige and excellence that Stanford
is known for in the public sphere is
limited, and must be exercised wisely.
Universities can't support every con
troversial speaker that comes their
way.
Some tough choices will have to
be made, and it's unclear whether
naming Rumsfeld a Hoover fellow
will benefit the University in the long
run. The deference to academic free
dom, however virtuous, may not be
worthwhile in light of the overall goal
of the IJniversitv.
