## Facebook warned by NY attorney general 
### MICHAEL GORMLEY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) The social net
working Web site Facebook has been
warned that it could face a consumer
fraud charge for failing to live up to
claims that youngsters there are safer
from sexual predators than at most
sites and that it promptly responds to
concerns, a spokesman for New York
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo
said Sunday.
"We expect an immediate correc
tion eliminating the dangers exposed
by our investigation," said the
spokesman, Jeffrey Lerner.

Cuomo announced last week that
he had subpoenaed Facebook after he
said the company did not respond to
"many" complaints by investigators
who were solicited for sex while pos
ing as 12- to 14-year-olds on the site.
Officials from Cuomo's office dis
cussed the issue with Facebook by
phone and fax Friday after they said
Facebook took three days to answer
calls and e-mails from state investiga
tors.
An official in Cuomo's office said
he and others are scheduled to meet
with Facebook representatives this
week and anticipate changes will fol
low immediately.

"We said, 'You have got to make
accurate representations on your
Web site," said the official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymi
ty because court filings haven't yet
been made. "What we told them is,
'Correct the language describing the
site and stop marketing yourself as
this pristine Web site ... parents have
a misimpression. You can't mislead
people."
Lerner said Facebook's contention
of being safer than most sites was ac
curate when it started out as a closed
site 31/2 years ago. But it's now much
larger, and the safeguards and appar
ently the response times for com

plaints aren't what they once were, he
said.
There was no immediate response
to e-mail and phone messages left for
a Facebook representative. But a
statement issued a week ago stated the
company was concerned about
Cuomo's claim that sexual predators
could use the site to meet with chil
dren.
"We strive to uphold our high stan
dards for privacy on Facebook and are
constantly working on processes and
technologies that will further improve
safety and user control on the site,"
Facebook spokeswoman Brandee
Barker said in the statement.
