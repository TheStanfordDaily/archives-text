## Hockey back in winning form, 2-1 over Pacific 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
After an unfortunate loss to Cal on Friday, the No.
20 Stanford field hockey team bounced back against
the University of Pacific on Sunday with a dramatic
2-1 victory The win was not assured until a final goal
in the 51st minute by senior Jess Zutz, who pushed
her team-leading goal tally to eight on the season.
Although the Cardinal had already defeated Pa
cific 4-2 in early September, this match was a little
tougher for the team, as it was played on an unfamil
iar surface on the Pacific campus.
"The game was played on grass, something we're
generally not used to." Zutz explained. "Grass is so
unpredictable. It's basically a lot more uncontrolled
than turf."
The match against Pacific marked the one and
only time that the Cardinal will see such a surface this
year, but it was a good test for the team.

GAME NOTES: No. 20 Stanford benefited from a second-half goal
by Jess Zutz in beating Pacific 2-1 this weekend after losing to Cal
in back-to-back games. The Cardinal will be back in action in two
weeks against the Wildcats who just lost their fifth straight match
and have not scored since Sept. 14.
"It took a lot of heart to go and beat
them on grass," Zutz said.
Coach Leslie Irvine was also encour
aged by what she saw in Sunday's victo
ry against Pacific.
"They were a hard team to play at
their home," she said. "It showed good
character to bounce back from the loss
[to Cal) on Friday."
The win against Pacific improved the
Cardinal's record to 7-2 overall and 4-1
in conference play. Stanford is in second
place in the NorPac conference behind
Cal, which has yet to lose a game.
NorPac consists of seven teams: Stan
ford. Cal. Pacific, Bradford. Davidson,
Appalachian State and Longwood. With
more geographic diversity than most
conferences, the league forces its com
petitors to often travel across the coun
try for even conference games.
Two days before the Pacific game, the
Cardinal dropped a non-league match
to rival Cal. ITie Golden Bears pulled
away in Stanford's first home match in
nearly a month, winning by the final

score of 4-1.
"We were disappointed with the out
come against Cal," Irvine said. "We felt
like we dominated a large portion of the
second half, but we set ourselves up for
an uphill battle [by falling behind]."
It was the second loss of the season
for Stanford; both losses have come
against the archrival Hears.
Despite the team's misses against
Cal, the women are ranked higher than
they've been in years,coming in at No. 20
in the national poll. And the team has a
lot to look forward to — there are only
two seniors on the squad. The Cardinal
has a youthful roster, boasting only four
juniors alongside nine sophomores and
seven freshmen.
"This is by far the strongest team I've
ever been a part of at Stanford," Zutz
said. "This is by far the strongest team
I've ever been a part of. period. We have
some really good players.
"We're able to attract field hockey
players who are also smart people, not
smart people who happen to be field

hockey players. We're incredibly quick
and what's really fortunate is that we're
very young."
The Cardinal will be off for two
weeks before taking on Northwestern at
home. After that, a non-conference
schedule with matches against the likes
of Wake Forest, Louisville, Georgetown
and Michigan awaits.
"We're really excited." Irvine said.
"It's going to give us a chance to estab
lish ourselves out of conference."
Looming even deeper on Stanford's
schedule is the NorPac tournament
which will take place during the first
week of November. Stanford will play
host to the competition, which will de
cide the NorPac's representative for the
NCAA Tournament.
"We're really excited about that,"
Irvine said. "It's a great opportunity for
us. We have some great talent and I'm
excited."
