## Hockey back in winning form, 2-1 over Pacific 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
After an unfortunate loss to Cal on Friday, the No.
20 Stanford field hockey team bounced back against
the University of Pacific on Sunday with a dramatic
2-1 victory The win was not assured until a final goal
in the 51st minute by senior Jess Zutz, who pushed
her team-leading goal tally to eight on the season.
Although the Cardinal had already defeated Pa
cific 4-2 in early September, this match was a little
tougher for the team, as it was played on an unfamil
iar surface on the Pacific campus.
"The game was played on grass, something we're
generally not used to." Zutz explained. "Grass is so
unpredictable. It's basically a lot more uncontrolled
than turf."
The match against Pacific marked the one and
only time that the Cardinal will see such a surface this
year, but it was a good test for the team.
