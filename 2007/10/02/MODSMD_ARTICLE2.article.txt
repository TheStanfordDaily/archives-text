### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was like a scene out of a I lollywood movie: an or
ganization dedicated to the wellbeing of sick children
discovered that one of its own had left the organization
and absconded with company money.
The Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's
Health reported last month that one of its former em
ployees embezzled approximately $350,000 from the
charity over the course of five years.
Hie foundation, a public charitable organization
that works to raise funds for pediatric research and care
— using grants made to the School of Medicine — un
covered the embezzlement during a routine accounting
check and released a statement to the public on Sept.
20.
llie Packard Foundation said it confirmed that all
donations made in support of the School of Medicine
were accounted for and were not affected by the theft.
David Alexander, President and CEO of the
Packard Foundation, said in a telephone interview with
llie Daily that company policy barred him from dis
closing the identity of the former employee. He did.
however, confirm that the suspected individual held a
position of authority in the founda
tion, which allowed him or her to
transfer and manipulate records for
funds within the organization.
"Basically, we had an individual
who, because of the responsibilities
of their position, was able to transfer
funds from our accounts to their
own accounts and then cover up the
transaction," Alexander said.
According to Alexander, after
the suspect stole nearly $350,000
from the foundation, he or she left
the company in June of this year.
Then, in late August, during a regu
lar check of the foundation's ac
counting processes, major discrep
ancies appeared in the accounts.
The organization's consultants. De
loitte & Touche USA. traced the dis
crepancies back to the former em
ployee.

Both the name of the suspect and
the information obtained through
the investigation have been handed
over to the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment. Alexander said. A criminal in
vestigation is now underway.
The funds taken from the foun
dation are covered by insurance. In
the meantime, the foundation is
looking to prevent future embezzle
ment by enacting changes to policies
and procedures involving handling
of funds.
"There's a number of suggestions
that have come through to us from
Deloitte," Alexander said. "Obvi
ously, we will be acting on every one
of their recommendations."
The Lucile Packard Foundation
for Children's Health, located in
Palo Alto, makes contributions to
nonprofit medical organizations
throughout Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties in addition to the
School of Medicine.
