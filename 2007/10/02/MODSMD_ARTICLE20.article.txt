GAME NOTES; After blowing out Pacific last week,
No. 4 Stanford squeaked by No. 3 UCLA for the 7-
6 win this weekend. The Cardinal will no* be able to
savor the victory for long, as the team will be back
in the pool Saturday with top-ranked USC in Los
Angeles. Stanford lost to USC in tournament play
earlier this season, but lost to UCLA in the same
weekend and reversed that result in conference
competition.

No. 4 Stanford avenged an early-season loss against No. 3 UCLA at home this weekend, winning
by one goal. The Cardinal will try to repeat the feat at top-ranked USC this week in MPSF play.
"We did the little things that are
hard and don't always get noticed.
We're not the biggest, strongest
players so we have to draw from a
lot of other tools and work that
much more together."
The win puts Stanford at 5-2 on
the season, and allowed them to re
deem themselves after a loss to the
Bruins two weeks ago.
The noise from the stands, which
were filled to capacity on the home
side, certainly made it easier for the
Cardinal to come out with a win.
"It was a great atmosphere at the
game with the hand coming," Fin
layson said. "We appreciate the sup
port from students and fans. Avery is
one of the toughest places to play in

the country because the fans arc
right on top of the players, so [other)
schools hate to play us at home."
A perennial contender for the
NCAA championship, the Cardinal
have high hopes that their team
work and the leadership of coach
John Vargas will have them in the
mix at season's end.
"If you look at ( a! Ol USC,
there's a lot of big guys." Finlayson
said. "USC particularly, and that's a
tool they can use. We've got a great
coach who does a wonderful job
managing personalities and en
abling us to exceed beyond our own
individual interests."
The team will seek to avenge its
loss earlier in the season to top
ranked Southern California. The
match takes place next Saturday in
Los Angeles.
