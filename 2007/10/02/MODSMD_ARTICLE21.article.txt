# No. 1 golfers finish fifth at Fighting lllini
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After two tough days of competition at
the Fighting lllini Invitational, the Stanford
men's golf team took fifth place, a disap
pointing result for the No. 1 ranked team in
the nation.The Cardinal managed a 36-over
par total of 876 at the Olympia Fields Golf
Course in Chicago, 111., hut it could not build
up enough momentum to overcome N0.7
Oklahoma State, who won the tournament
with a 17-over-par 857.
"Our guys were a little disappointed with
how we played, but there are a lot of things
we can learn from," head coach Conrad Ray
told GoStanford.com.
The individual winner, Oklahoma State's
Ricky Fowler, posted a seven-under 203 and
was one of two golfers in the pool of 60 com
petitors to finish the tournament under par.
No. 23 Texas finished second to Oklahoma
with a score of 864 with Indiana (870) and
No.B Florida State (874) at its heels to place
third and fourth in the team rankings, respec
tively.
Junior Dodge Kemmer secured the best
finish of his career after he moved up three
spots yesterday in the individual competition
to take seventh place in the tournament.
Kemmer was the only Cardinal golfer to nail
down a below-par score of 69 for the round.
Concluding the tournament with a 7-over
217, he helped the Cardinal maintain its fifth
place position over the many strong teams
participating.
Senior captain Rob Grube kept Kemmer
on his toes, tying with him in seventh place. It
was Grube's second top-ten finish of the year
after three consistent and controlled round
scores of 71,73 and 73 strokes.
Just behind his senior teammate, fresh
man Sihwan Kim posted a 9-over-par score
of 219 to earn a tie for 15th. Kim was tied with
Kemmer and Grube after the first two
rounds but let his game fall in the third round
when he scored a five-over-par 75. Though
the Invitational was only his second colle
giate tournament, Kim now has two top-25
finishes under his belt.
Also among the top five Cardinal golfers
were a pair of sophomores, Joseph Bramlett
and Jordan Cox. Bramlett fell ten spots
from Sunday and posted a final score of
223. putting him in a tie for 35th. Cox fell
five places from Sunday's position to finish
the tournament in a tie for 50th with a score
of 229.
This was only the Cardinal's second team
tournament of the year and it is fielding a
much younger team than last season. ITie
Cardinal lost seniors Zack Miller and Matt
Savage, who were consistent members of the
Cardinal roster. The young team is nonethe
less playing well for the start of the season,
notching two top-five finishes on the season
— third place honors at the lopy C up and
now fifth place at the l ighting lllini.
Ray admitted to GoStanford.com that
this tournament was a learning experience
for the guys to help develop their skills.
"It was a very difficult course, but it
showed us that we need to work on our short

game and save shots around the green." he
said. "We felt we could have played better,
hut it's a good time of year to learn what we
need to do to improve and identify what our
strengths and weaknesses are."
Now that the Stanford golfers have gained
some experience from these first two tourna
ments, they will head next to La Quinta, Calif,
in two weeks, where they will aim to repeat as
champions at The Prestige tournament at
PGA West.
