Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actu
al strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they
could beat the team below them.

Rank last Week Comment
1. LSU 1 Another week like this and top two could both lose and
still make the Sugar.
2. USC 2 Guess they are mortal after all. Last year, UW scare
started a month-long funk.
3. Ohio State 3 AP finally giving them props after five top-ten teams
lost. No substitute for 0.
4. Oklahoma 4 I still think they would score 40 on Cal.
5. California 7 Mighty long Rose Bowl drought might have come to an
end in Eugene.
6. Florida 6 Near-upset to inferior SEC team, then loss to Auburn?
Sounds like last year.
7. Oregon 9 Fell about ten inches short of forcing overtime. Michi
gan win looking better too.
8. Virginia Tech 10 Easy schedule means we know little about Hokies.
9. West Virginia 5 Gained 437 yards, but six turnovers in South Florida
loss. Won't happen again.
10. Michigan 11 Caveman offensive scheme doesn't work; nearly blew
Northwestern game.
11. South Carolina 13 This weekend's big winner. SEC East is for the taking.
12. Georgia 14 Ditto. At Tennessee this week is toughest remaining
road test.
13. Texas 8 QB McCoy questionable for Oklahoma. K-State loss an
other '06 repeat.
14. Wisconsin 15 At Illinois, at Penn State. Think the Cinderella run ends
over next two weeks.
15. Miami 16 'Cones could run away with weak ACC.
16. South Florida 21 Told ya. Now the pendulum swings too far the other
way â€” they're not No. 6.
17. UCLA 18 Actually trailed Oregon State 14-12 before 28-0 4th
quarter. ND, then Cal.
18. Arizona State 22 Defense biggest surprise of last weekend. That second
ary is legit.
19. Florida State NR Offense still non-existent. But defense probably top-ten
in country.
20. Boston College 19 Gotta have the easiest schedule of a BCS team, but
pickings are slim here.
21. Rutgers 23 Told ya With South Florida, West Virginia at home, still
could win Big East.
22. Hawaii 25 Run the table and BCS berth is all yours with weekend's
upsets.
23. Kentucky NR Way overrated, and next three (South Carolina, LSU,
Florida) will show it.
24. Nebraska 24 Ugly wins over Wake Forest and Ball State, ugly USC
loss. But who else here?
25. Missouri NR Kansas and Missouri only unbeaten teams left in Big
12. Wow.
