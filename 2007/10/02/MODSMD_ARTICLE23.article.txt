# Stanford sweeps at Invite
## Arianna Lambie repeats victory in women's race 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford Invitational lived up
to its name this past weekend, as the
host men's and women's cross coun
try teams swept the competition for
the second year in a row.
The men won easily with a score
of 37; the closest team behind them
was second-place Cal who scored 66.
Although Stanford did not have a
single runner finish in the top three,
its depth across the board led to its
relative easy victory.
Senior Neftalem Araia led all
Stanford runners with his 23:40 mark
in the 8,000-meter race. He was
backed up by junior Hari Mix
(23:46). senior Russell Brown (23:47)
and junior Hakon DeVries(24:l7) in
fifth, sixth and tenth, respectively

Freshman Justin Marpole-Bird
rounded out the Cardinal's lineup,
coming in twelfth place with his time
of 24:28.
As easily as the men won. howev
er. the No. 1 ranked women were
even more dominant. The women
took the Invitational with a score of
27, besting an Arizona State squad
that came in second with a final tally
of 78.
Senior Arianna Lambie took the
individual title with a time of 19:48.
Junior Alicia Follmar finished fourth
overall with her mark of 20:52, and
senior Lauren Centrowitz came in
sixth place at 20:55.
"I'm pretty excited," senior Cen
trowitz said. "We had a lot of fresh
men step up and run really well.
"I think we feel pretty confident
in the direction we're going. I know
how much harder we're going to
work throughout the season. I think
good things will come to us in No
vember."
The Invitational provided a
great opportunity for the Cardinal,

both as a tournament to ease it into
the season, and as a chance for it to
size up some of its west coast com
petitors.
Although happy with her team's
performance this past Saturday.
Centrowitz is aware that both the
men and women have a lot of work
to do before all is said and done this
year.
"As a senior I realize it's a pretty
long season," she said. "With that in
mind 1 think both teams are just
gearing up to reach the podium and
do whatever it takes to get there."
Aside from the collegiate compe
tition, the Invitational also played
host to numerous high schools from
all over California. German Fernan
dez of Riverbank High School
(Calif.) took the seeded boys' event,
running away from his closest com
petitor by an astounding 40 seconds.
He finished the approximately
three-mile course in 14:42.
