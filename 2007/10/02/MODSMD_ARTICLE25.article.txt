## Old Union to have programming board ASSU Executives envision new center of campus culture 
### JOANNA XU 
ITie newly opened Axe and Palm has morphed
Old Union into a livelier student hang-out spot
than it has been in past years, but the ASSU has a
grander plan in nund. The Executives and their
Cabinet plan to transform Old Union into the so
cial and cultural core of campus life, and the Old
Union Programming Board (OUPB) has been cre
ated to help achieve that goal.
"[The ASSU wants to] make Old Union a pre
mier destination on campus," said ASSU Vice Pres
ident Mondaire Jones *09 and ASSU Chair of Stu
dent Union Initiatives Ben Fong'oB in an OUPB
proposal.

The Board's first priority is to coordinate a wide
variety of student events in Old Union, including
live band performances, rallies for major Stanford
sporting events, visual art exhibitions and the
ASSU State of the Association Address. Members
of the OUPB have not yet been chosen, but ASSU
Executives are hard at work communicating with
student groups in the meantime.
"We're already communicating with the drama
department about performances in the lobby,"
Fong said. "We're getting the Stanford Concert
Network and local bands to perform in the Axe and
Palm."
Fong and Jones hope that these events will push
Old Union to be the number one meeting spot for
students on campus.
"Right now the campus doesn't really have a
central space," Fong said. "When students meet it's
usually in class or in the dorms, which is more a per
sonal space."
In addition to promoting Old Union as a flexi

hie, multi-purpose lounge, the OUPB will also
support educational theme events such as
Women's History Month, religious and cultural
celebrations and a variety of social and national
holidays.
'The Board will consist of 10 to 12 members, with
a minimum of three undergraduate representa
tives. But according to Jones, finding interested un
dergraduates is not a concern of the ASSU.
"There will probably be many more than three
undergraduates on the Board," he said. "The real
challenge will be getting graduate students in
volved."
Despite its ratio of undergraduate to graduate
students, Fong emphasized that, through its work
with Old Union, the OUPB will enhance student
life on campus for the entire student body.
"The Old Union is valuable," Fong said. "It can
be a social hub for all students."
