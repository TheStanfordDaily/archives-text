# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Housing handles high volume 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
While the Stanford community eagerly wel
comed the largest-ever freshman class last month,
many returning students had other priorities as
they anxiously awaited the announcement of their
fall housing assignments. With the most students
on campus in recent history, many questioned how
the University would accommodate the entire stu
dent body without constructing new residences.
Student concern about a housing crunch began
last spring, when many students with guaranteed
housing were not given an assignment in the Hous
ing Draw.
"1 was really disappointed when i found I was
n't assigned housing," said Panayiota Christidis'o9
in an email to The Daily. "The few weeks leading
up to when Draw results were released, my draw
mates and I had agonized over what preferences to
list for housing. So when everyone else found out
where they were living and we didn't, it was hard
to still have a significant unknown' about next
year."
Though Christidis and other students were left
unassigned in the spring, all guaranteed students
did finally receive a housing assignment before the
school year officially began this fall. In addition,all
unguaranteed women seeking housing have been
offered assignments. Seventeen unguaranteed
men remain unassigned.
Director of Housing Assignments Sue Nunan
explained that though there was an increase in
housing applications for this academic year, the
University can still guarantee housing to all eligi

hie students.
"In addition to a higher number of entering
student housing applieations, 70 more returning,
upper-class undergraduates entered the Spring
Housing Draw in May compared to 2(X)6." she
said. "The increase in entering and returning stu-

dent applications has not affected Stanford's abil
ity to guarantee undergraduates four years of
student housing, but we expect spaces in under
graduate housing to be tighter throughout the

C P "P &
academic year compared to last year."
In order to accommodate the increase in
students, Burbank was converted to an all
freshman dorm for the 2007-2008 school

year. The residence, which was previously a four
class dorm, will house 88 freshmen instead of 30 as
in past years. Students have also been housed in
guest cottages on west campus.
"Three guest cottages in Governor's Corner
and one guest room in Roble Hall are being used
as student rooms this year," Nunan said. "Three
study rooms that were converted to student rooms
last year were retained as student rooms again this
year. No student rooms were increased in occu
pancy compared to last year."
Though the housing situation is tight. Executive
Director of Student Housing and Chief I lousing
Officer Roger Whitney stated that construction
plans for additional undergraduate housing arc
underway.
TTie Housing Master Plan calls for building
additional undergraduate housing," he said in an
email to The Daily. "'Unstuffing' overcrowded un
dergraduate rooms; creating additional 'premier'
singles and two-room doubles; and offering more

all-freshman housing options within Florence
Moore, Stern and Wilbur Halls [are all part of the
Plan]. Preliminary planning is underway to con
struct additional housing â€” including a large resi
dence complex on the east side of campus and a
small 'green' house on the Row."
The housing office remains optimistic about
the increase in freshman matriculation. Instead of
having a negative impact on housing, housing offi
cials have embraced this opportunity to improve
housing options for all students.
"We used this change in yield as an opportuni
ty to move toward the increase in all-frosh housing
options outlined in the Housing Master Plan,"
Whitney said. "Overall, freshmen, transfer stu
dents and continuing upper-class students should
all benefit from the changes we have made in stu
dent housing in response to the increased fresh
man yield."
