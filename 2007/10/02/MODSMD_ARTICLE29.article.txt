In a two-page passage of his
bestseller "Dead Certain,"
Robert Draper rehashes then-
Governor George W. Bush's trip
to the Palo Alto home of former
Secretary of State George Shultz
in April 1998.
"Inside were the Big-Thinkers
of Stanford University's ghetto
for conservatives, the Hoover In
stitution: former Reagan econom
ic advisers Martin and Annelise
Anderson, economist John
Cogan. the college's impressive
young provost and Sovietologist
Condoleezza Rice, and the man
who had organized the meeting,
former Council of Economic Ad
visers director under the Bush ad
ministration Michael Boskin."
The author reports that Bush

spoke with Shultz's Hispanic
housekeeper in Spanish, "to her
tittering delight."
There had been a similar meet
ing of leading intellectual conser
vatives with Ronald Reagan in
1979.
"And now here was George W.
Bush, about to provide a dose of
deja vu," Draper writes. "After lis
tening to the others give their pre
sentations — and, being profes
sors. they all went overtime —
Bush spoke his piece."
Bush reportedly talked about
Social Security reform, the Inter
national Monetary Fund and the
future of India.
"When it was over, Shultz
rather giddily took George W.
Bush aside." according to Draper.
"He told Bush that back in 1979,
after Reagan's talk had conclud
ed. Shultz had brought him to the
very spot where they now stood,
and said. Run. We will support
you. And now, Shultz said, he
wished to say the same thing to
Bush."
