## Break into song "Shower singers," more trained vocalists join a cappella groups after weeklong audition process 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the first week of classes was hardly a
cakewalk for anyone, it proved an espe
cially exhausting test of endurance for
members of a cappella groups across cam
pus.
Afternoons spent tabling in White Plaza. All
nighters stuffing audition folders. And.finally, for a new
crop of baritones and altos alike, opportunity knocking
loudly on the door in the wee hours of Saturday morn
ing: roll-outs.
"I'm literally eating, breathing and sleeping Mendi
cants," said Mendicants president, Gus Horwith '10. at 6
a.m.Thursday after a night spent deciding call-backs.
Starting last TYiesday, a cappella groups conducted
annual auditions to recruit new members for the up
coming year.
I lorwith saw the process as a mixed blessing.
"It's really exciting, because we're determining who
we're going to spend the bulk of this coming year with."
Horwith said. "But |it's) also really stressful, because
there's just so much behind-the-scenes work to make
sure the process runs smoothly."
Groups began preparations far in advance.
"People put in a tremendous amount of work before
school starts." said Sidney Ee 10. musical director of
Mixed Company. Tasks included booking singing en
gagements at dorms, contacting dorm staff, designing
posters, stuffing callback folders and generally awaiting
the arrival of the talented class of 2011.
