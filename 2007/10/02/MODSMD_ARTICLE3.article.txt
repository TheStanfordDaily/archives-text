## Break into song "Shower singers," more trained vocalists join a cappella groups after weeklong audition process 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the first week of classes was hardly a
cakewalk for anyone, it proved an espe
cially exhausting test of endurance for
members of a cappella groups across cam
pus.
Afternoons spent tabling in White Plaza. All
nighters stuffing audition folders. And.finally, for a new
crop of baritones and altos alike, opportunity knocking
loudly on the door in the wee hours of Saturday morn
ing: roll-outs.
"I'm literally eating, breathing and sleeping Mendi
cants," said Mendicants president, Gus Horwith '10. at 6
a.m.Thursday after a night spent deciding call-backs.
Starting last TYiesday, a cappella groups conducted
annual auditions to recruit new members for the up
coming year.
I lorwith saw the process as a mixed blessing.
"It's really exciting, because we're determining who
we're going to spend the bulk of this coming year with."
Horwith said. "But |it's) also really stressful, because
there's just so much behind-the-scenes work to make
sure the process runs smoothly."
Groups began preparations far in advance.
"People put in a tremendous amount of work before
school starts." said Sidney Ee 10. musical director of
Mixed Company. Tasks included booking singing en
gagements at dorms, contacting dorm staff, designing
posters, stuffing callback folders and generally awaiting
the arrival of the talented class of 2011.
After the new students settled in. groups
performed selections at the New Student Ori
entation's O-Show and various dorms across
campus. Interested students found themselves
well-received in White Plaza as well, with nu
merous groups setting up informational tables
to recruit for upcoming auditions. For students
of all levels of musical experience, Tuesday
marked the beginning of first-round auditions.
"The audition pool [was] incredibly strong
this year," said Talisman member Maria
Duzon 09.
Not all auditionees boasted years of voice
lessons and performance awards.
"It's a really wide range of people who try
out." said Nikhil Kamat '09, president of Raa
gapella. an all-male South Asian-focus a cap
pella group.
Mostly, Kamat said, people who sing in a
cappella groups on campus have had either
personal vocal training or other musical expe
rience. like playing an instrument or singing in
school choirs. Others, a little under half, have
had no prior singing experience.
"Shower singers," Kamat described them.
He included himself in that category. "I ran
domly picked up singing while driving to
work, listening to the radio."
Having been in the same position as many
of his intimidated auditionees, Kamat found it
easier to relate to students who were interest
ed in singing, but not necessarily acquainted
with the performance aspect of a cappella.
"It's a really encouraging environment." he
said. "We all stand up when the person walks in,
and clap. Some people think they're wrong
when they're right. We encourage in the right
place."
Luke Henesy '10, a new member of Mixed
Company, actually found the welcoming audi
tion atmosphere more nerve-racking than
comforting.
"It was weird," Henesy said."lt appears to
be such a friendly and low-pressure environ
ment, and yet there is so much pressure on
everybody if you look at it objectively. It made
me more nervous, knowing that they would
appear happy no matter what."
While more technical elements like pitch
matching, scales, rhythm and range tests, and
solo renditions figured prominently in the se
lection process, personality also played a large
role. While groups are likely to spot a number
of well-qualified singers, they must likewise
ensure that the auditionee is compatible with
their musical style and group dynamics.
Following first-round auditions on Tuesday
and Wednesday, several groups held call-back
barbecues on Thursday and Friday as an op
portunity for socializing and further audition
ing. After all, accepted members will eventu

ally be spending a minimum of eight hours per
week with their group.
"We really don't have any specific criteria
for a potential recruit," said I lorwith.' We just
want to see how you can sing and then try to
figure out whether you'd mesh, personality
wise. with the returning members. It's not the
Inquisition or anything."
Criteria vary from group to group.
For Raagapella, Kamat said,"what's nice is
to have people with good soloing abilities.
Pitch and tone can be taught, but soloing is
something that's intrinsic to youi particular
vocal quality. We look for someone who can
really perform."

Overall. Duzon opined, "there's nothing
more attractive than seeing someone who
simply loves to sing."
Late Friday night, having spent the week
collecting their impressions of numerous po
tential members, all sleep-deprived a cappella
groups convened to determine, once and for
all. the new additions to their musical families.
Group members described the night as
long but exciting, with each negotiating their
picks under the arbitration of an a cappella
alumnus. In case of conflict, groups referred to
sealed envelopes containing the auditionees'
preferences. By early Saturday morning,
members emerged with yet another task: to

roll out their new recruits at the crack of
dawn.
Henesy went to sleep unaware of whether
it would be representatives from Mixed Com
pany. Fleet Street or neither group who would
greet him in the morning.
But when Mixed Company came knocking,
he remembers waking up with a big smile on
his face. Of the more than 100 auditionees for
the group. Henesy was one of the 10 lucky
ones.
"I was so confused," he said, "and yet real
ly happy"
