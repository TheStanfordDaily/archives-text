# Debates on political visits
## Across nation, college campuses alive with debates on politics, free speech 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week's visit by Iranian Presi
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Co
lumbia University brought the de
bate over campus politics and aca
demic freedom — a debate already
brewing at Stanford since the I ioover
Institution announced the appoint
ment of Donald Rumsfeld as a distin
guished visiting fellow in mid-Sep
tember — to the national spotlight.
Giving Ahmadinejad a platform
to make his views heard and get the
attention he craves — without facing
constructive debate — put Columbia
in a lose-lose situation, said Abbas
Milani. I (oover fellow and director of
the Iranian Studies Program. What
best defines academic freedom is an
engaging discussion and a serious
give-and-take with scholars, he said,
adding that such a format was missing
at Columbia last week.
In his introductory remarks, Co
lumbia's President Lee Bollinger de
fended the address as an exercise in
free speech. He then disparaged his
guest as "a petty and cruel dictator"
and said his denial of the Holocaust
was "either brazenly provocative or
astonishingly uneducated."
"It could have been handled much
better," Milani said in an interview
with The Daily. "When [Ahmadine
jad] makes an absurd statement, like
'there are no homosexuals in Iran,'
someone could have called him on it.
Instead it was comic relief."
Asked whether he would wel
come the Iranian president to Stan
ford. the Hoover fellow said he
would, on the condition that Ah
madinejad submit to a debate with a
panel of scholars, Iranian opposition
leaders and Jewish community lead
ers.
"I have no doubt that he would not
have accepted [those conditions)."

Milani said. "He only wants a free
ride."
Academic freedom and free
speech issues at college campuses
have also made headlines in Califor
nia. I JC-Irvine fired and then rehired
liberal scholar Edwin Chemerinsky
as founding dean of its fledgling law
school, while petitions of protest
from several hundred faculty mem
bers statewide caused the I Jnivcrsity
of California to rescind an offer to
former Harvard president Larry
Summers to speak at a UC Regents
dinner.
Critics have denounced the cam
puses in question as hypocritical and
out-of-touch with the rest of the
country. While unique, the episodes
display "a degree of weak nerves,
close-mindedness and herd thinking
that are the opposite of academic in
quiry and basic freedoms." The San
Francisco Chronicle's Editorial
Board wrote in an editorial published
last week. "It's a mistake to give in to
these protests. Free speech is not just
for the'right' views of history,science,
war or culture. It must be celebrated,
not suppressed, on our college cam
puses."
At Stanford, Rumsfeld's defend
ers have seized on similar sentiments.
As a two-time former secretary of de
fense, they argue, his experience is
tantamount to the mission of the
I loover task force on national securi
ty, terrorism and ideology.
"The general public has had to re
mind these universities that their
campuses should welcome thinkers
who have distinguished themselves
in their fields, regardless of politics
and ideology," 1 loover fellow Victor
Davis I lansen wrote in an op-ed pub
lished last week in The San Jose Mer
cury News."Here's a simple tip to the
clueless tenured class about why a
