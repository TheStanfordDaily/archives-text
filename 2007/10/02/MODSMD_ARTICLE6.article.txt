## Bush administration author visits Hoover Draper discusses new book, Bush While House 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Robert Draper, the bestselling author of
a new book that takes readers deep inside
the bubble of the Bush White I louse, paint
ed a picture of George W. Bush ;is deter
mined, confident and stubborn last night for
a I ioover Institution group.
"The president possesses intelligence of
a certain and very real kind." he said. "I le
can follow arguments quite well. I le's very
literate. He's very focused, which I think
leads people to believe he's something short
of intelligent.
"The president has a feature to him that's
not particularly attractive," Draper added,
"and it's petulance."
Draper's "Dead Certain." which is
ranked 14th on this week's New York Times
bestseller list, made headlines when it was
published last month because, in it the pres
ident talks with unusual candor about sub
jects ranging from his retirement plans to
Iraq. Draper described it as the first
"straightforward literary narrative of this
rather consequential presidency."
Bush insists on loyalty among his staff.
Draper said, and being comfortable with
those around him. Draper spent about 15
minutes of the hour-long event walking the
audience through Bush's presidential life:
from campaigning for the presidency in
New Hampshire to the present Iraq debacle.
"There's a point of view this administra
tion has adopted," he said. "That this war is

difficult. That things don't happen as
planned."
Asked about Iraq. Draper said: "I think
| Bush | honestly believes that it's not a mis
take."
I le added that Bush believed that there
were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
before the I IS. invasion and as late as April
2(H)(i, when Andy ('aid left the White I louse
as Chief of Staff, and possibly to this day.
| draper, a fellow Texan, scored six exclu
sivu interviews with the president, most re
cently in May. I le also talked to about 2(H)
others for the project.
lie told the largely conservative audi
ence that, when he was shopping his book
idea in 2004. he received rejections from
leaders in the "left-of-center" publishing in
dustry who strongly disliked the president.
Eventually he found a taker at Simon and
Schuster.hut he said they stipulated that the
book Iv published before 2(X)Â«S.
At first. Draper was unsure if Bush
would talk to him for the book. Draper said
he'd written SO percent of the book before
his first on-the-record interview with the
president.
"I had to go back and not just rewrite and
plug in quotations but really rethink aspects
of the book," he said. "The president, while I
thought I got it from the outset,nonetheless
revealed his concerns and what weighed on
him in a way I had not anticipated."
After the book was published, oppo
nents of the president pointed to some sec
tions as evidence that Bush has failed. Sup
porters said it shows the president as a
leader in wartime.

Robert Draper spoke at the Hoover Institution last night about his book, "Dead Certain,"
which includes new material including six exclusive interviews with the President
"The distinct feeling I've gotten
from the White House, which has
been steadfast in their 'no com

ment,' is that they're not pleased
with the kind of splash the book
generated," Draper said, noting
that White House officials will
probably like the book when the
dust settles.
