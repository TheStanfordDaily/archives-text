The Stanford Daily has selected a
group of six students to sit on its Edi
torial Board. The application process
was open and was advertised daily last week
in the Opinions section, as well as in an all
campus e-flier. The members of Volume
232's Editorial Board are a group of diverse
and exceptionally qualified individuals. To
inform readers, we've written up brief biog
raphies of each of the board members
below.

joring in history and lives in Maison Fran
caise. Cao is a returning member to the

weight crew team and loves to ride her road
bike, run, go to sleep early and listen to an
eclectic assortment of music (especially al
ternative and classic rock) in her free time.

but he still enjoys smooth jazz and long
walks on the beach. He lives in Flo Mo.

he WILL take a class from David Kennedy

wego, Ore. She is double-majoring in eco

The Editorial Board's published editori
als reflect a consensus of opinion amongst
board members, and we hope these brief in
troductions provide some insight into the
identities and actions of the board. Here's to
a lively Op-Ed section of Volume 232!
