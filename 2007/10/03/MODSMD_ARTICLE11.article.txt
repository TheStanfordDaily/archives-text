## Good-bye, cruel world 
### 
I've been fired. Well, not so much fired;
rather "They" have failed to renew my
contract. (Actually, I don't have a con
tract; I'm just an unpaid worker who slaves
away for love, duty and honor, but I'm sure
you get the idea.)
I'm unloved and unwanted (also.unwed
ded. unwarranted, unwaxed and unwashed -
sorry, was playing with dictionary.com). Cast
aside to make way for a younger generation.
From the giddy heights of weekly publica
tion I've been kicked back to the ranks of
the general public. No longer can I soar
above the herd; I must, once again, live
amongst you.
This is column 108 (9 less than Master
Christian Holt: damn you Holt, damn you).
In my writings I've tried to touch on such di
verse topics as: why my life sucks, how my
life sucks and what, in particular.sucks in my
life. It is true that some have interpreted this
breadth as a lack of focus, but I see the vari
ety of my interests as one of my greatest
strengths.
I had great plans for my final year as a
Daily columnist. So much to write about, so
much to share. I am, after all, a genius, and
before leaving I wanted to share a little
more wisdom with you, in order to enrich
your meaningless, insignificant lives.
However, do not fret at your loss. Since
much of what I write is filler to keep my
word consuming masters satiated (the ads
look so much better if framed by earnest
looking text), maybe I can give you a con
densed sample of the kind of mental stimu
lation you could have expected over the
year.
So, here we go — a lightning tour of at
least some of what I had left to say.
The Illusion of Diversity Despite being
planted in the tolerance fairyland of North
America, Stanford can be a little bit moron
ic when it comes to variety. 87 internally ho
mogenous groups are not diverse, that re
quires mixing with one another. Go on, give
it go.
I Hate You. So long as you cap it at mild
dislike, hate is really the only intellectually
serious way to deal with the vagaries of
modern life. Especially the existence of un
dergraduates.
Stanford is Corrupt. Now, to be honest, I
am sort of making this up, but if you can't
make shit up in a student newspaper, what
good is it? And, Stanford should be corrupt
— a $3 billion budget and no independent
checks and balances... If there's no corrup
tion. then the high esteem in which I hold
the university bureaucracy is going to swift
ly vanish.
I Want My Friends to Fail.This is a pretty
self-explanatory; other people's successes
upset me. And when I say upset. I mean that
when my peers win prizes and get jobs I feel
physically sick. And don't pretend that
you're not the same.
Global Warming is a Hoax. Nah. not real
ly, but I got you for sec. Plus, a title like that

would get me a good half dozen emails.
Have More Sex. It's almost a pointless
truism but really, we should all humping as
much as humanly possible. After all. it's
not like the opportunities increase as you
get older. Moreover (and this has been
bothering me for years) sex is both safe (so
long as you're not an idiot) and good (so
long as you're not an idiot). Also, I wrote
this column last year (it was censored as
too hot for publication) and I'm not one to
waste.
I could go on, there is, after all, so much
wisdom to share. But, honestly, I'm tired and
Monday night TV is about to kick off. More
importantly, I feel like I should take this op
portunity to say goodbye to my loyal reader
ship. Of course, said loyal readership doesn't
actually exist — even my friends stopped
reading years ago when I started repeating
topics.
It's quite upsetting really, after all these
years the only person that really cares about
my weekly words is me. But hey, at least that
means I have the intellectual audience tied
up-
On a final note, I thought I'd give you all
the quick version of my capstone column for
The Daily; I've been working on it for the
last couple of years (beats research). It's my
final word on grad school.
Failure. A lot of people will tell you that
the key to life is success. That humanity is
built on achievements and triumphs. Bull
shit. Society is built on failure. Of course it's
true that in the one. two, five, six or twenty
three years spent earning your graduate de
gree, you're invariably failing humanity and
yourself, whilst achieving nothing. But as
you do so you are the building blocks of
human progress.
It may take talent to succeed, but it takes
cojones to fail. And more to pick yourself up,
in order to fail again. And again. And again.
Any idiot can get a well-paying job. Find
a charming and engaging spouse. Have
beautiful, adorable children. And coast
through life with a smile on his face and a de
cent credit rating. However, it takes real
dedication to never give up on unhappiness
and an objective lack of status.
And that's what I want you to take away
from my c. 80,000 words. Be miserable. Be
unhappy. Be bitter and be twisted. And
above all. embrace failure.

would get me a good half dozen emails.
Have More Sex. It's almost a pointless
truism but really, we should all humping as
much as humanly possible. After all. it's
not like the opportunities increase as you
get older. Moreover (and this has been
bothering me for years) sex is both safe (so
long as you're not an idiot) and good (so
long as you're not an idiot). Also, I wrote
this column last year (it was censored as
too hot for publication) and I'm not one to
waste.
I could go on, there is, after all, so much
wisdom to share. But, honestly, I'm tired and
Monday night TV is about to kick off. More
importantly, I feel like I should take this op
portunity to say goodbye to my loyal reader
ship. Of course, said loyal readership doesn't
actually exist — even my friends stopped
reading years ago when I started repeating
topics.
It's quite upsetting really, after all these
years the only person that really cares about
my weekly words is me. But hey, at least that
means I have the intellectual audience tied
up-
On a final note, I thought I'd give you all
the quick version of my capstone column for
The Daily; I've been working on it for the
last couple of years (beats research). It's my
final word on grad school.
Failure. A lot of people will tell you that
the key to life is success. That humanity is
built on achievements and triumphs. Bull
shit. Society is built on failure. Of course it's
true that in the one. two, five, six or twenty
three years spent earning your graduate de
gree, you're invariably failing humanity and
yourself, whilst achieving nothing. But as
you do so you are the building blocks of
human progress.
It may take talent to succeed, but it takes
cojones to fail. And more to pick yourself up,
in order to fail again. And again. And again.
Any idiot can get a well-paying job. Find
a charming and engaging spouse. Have
beautiful, adorable children. And coast
through life with a smile on his face and a de
cent credit rating. However, it takes real
dedication to never give up on unhappiness
and an objective lack of status.
And that's what I want you to take away
from my c. 80,000 words. Be miserable. Be
unhappy. Be bitter and be twisted. And
above all. embrace failure.
