## Confessions of a mattress thief 
### 
To whomever left his mattress outside a
FroSoCo door the other night, I sin
cerely apologize. Please, take it hack: it
has done enough damage to my house and
my family.
Maybe 1 should explain.
Legend has it that the Hope Diamond is
the world's most unlucky diamond, having
played a role in the assassination of Louis
XIV and Marie Antoinette, and bankrupting
everyone who has ever held it for any
amount of time. Its obvious allure has taken
in hundreds of victims throughout history
and brought them to mysterious fates. And I
believe — no, I know — that I have received
the Hope Diamond of Mattresses.
' Wandering the FroSoCo halls late at night
several days ago with a trusty companion —
as I the adventurer am wont to do — I came
upon a mattress lying outside of a door on
the third floor.
Taking for granted that if something is
lying outside of a door it is free for the taking
and being a big fan of free crap. I decided
with my companion to "steal" the mattress
from its current location, and "spirit it away"
to my dorm, Larkin.on the other side of cam
pus.
This was no easy task. First, we had to get
the mattress down from the third floor. Iliis
entailed quite a bit of shoving from a bal
cony. over a plant trellis and onto a rack of
bikes. Even after all this the mattress was still
a mile from Larkin.
After attempting to slide the mattress
onto cardboard boxes and drag it behind our
bicycles and failing to "liberate" a golf cart
for our nefarious purposes, we finally settled
on a wonderful idea: strapping it to my back
while I hiked it across campus.
I had a cable bike lock with me to use as a
strap, and did just that. I was on top of the
world: a McGuiver-style clever renegade
traveling across a barren campus at 2 a.m.,
singing Rod Stewart's "Do Ya ITiink I'm
Sexy" with a 20 pound blue mattress dan
gling precariously from my shoulders (and at
least twice causing me to run into passing
pedestrians). When we finally reached

Larkin. I anxiously displayed my loot to all
present.
My roommate Kevin, the obvious matri
arch of our humble abode, was unfortunate
ly unhappy with me for having stolen some
poor FroSoCo-ian's mattress. He berated me
for inviting bedbugs to our dorm, causing the
room to smell bad. and.finally (and really,
this was a bit unwarranted), killing Jesus —
all because 1 had dared to improve our room
with a mattress-couch.

I believe —no, I
know —that I have
received the Hope
Diamond of
mattresses.

Several days went by without serious
repercussions. I lofted my bed to the highest
possible setting, and laid my newfound mat
tress under the old one. This amounted to a
"Super-Loft," in which my head was literally
only several inches from the ceiling. I
thought this was Super-Awesome.
After a time, however, a smell began to

permeate the room: rancid chicken meat.
Our room, usually foul-smelling (due to the
rotting fruit in the garbage can and the
spoiled milk in the fridge), had acquired a
new, decidedly worse smell.
Kevin immediately suspected our new
guest, and. according to his wishes. I created
a listing on SI J Post about a missing mattress,
hoping someone could relieve our room of
this horrible plague.
Here is where things took a turn for the
worst: I got a reply to my post. "Peter at
FroSoCo" kindly informed me that he'd left
his "bedbug-ridden" mattress out into the
hall and was waiting for the dorm staff to
come by and pick it up.
Needless to say. I freaked out. Kevin
and I immediately ran the mattress outside
to the dumpster. and prepared to burn it.
We removed our sheets, backed up our
hard drives, and searched our bodies for
red pocks. In our haste, we acquired quite a
crowd, themselves very concerned that
now they too would have bedbugs. I took
quite a bit of flak for my innocent adven
turing.
Before making a too-drastic move, we de
cided to find this Peter character and injure
him in some way.This was only just, as he had
caused so much grief. Biking back out to
FroSoCo, this time with a mob of three peo
ple. we hunted down Peter, who was inno
cently typing away at his computer.
Well, a long and awkward 20 minute con
versation later, we discovered this was not
the same Peter, and later, found that the mat
tress didn't have bedbugs after all. and that
the guy down the hall was pranking us.
What had started as a joke turned into a
knife: tearing apart the tender bonds of rom
mateship, dividing a dorm, and nearly maim
ing poor Peter.
Please, come and get your mattress: It has
done its karmic counter-attack already.

Although this adventure is from last year, Nat
anticipates many such future adventures in his
weekly column. Contact him at
