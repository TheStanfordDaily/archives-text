## Dining halls issue reusable thermoses 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
In an attempt to cut back on the use of dispos
able containers, Stanford Dining is distributing
reusable thermoses this week to all students with
meal plans.
"Our objective is to have students use the ther
moses instead of non-reusable cups." said Karen
Andrews, associate director of Stanford Dining, in
a press release. "That will help us reduce our pur
chases of disposables, and thereby decrease our
waste."
Each 20 ounce thermos comes with its own car
rying case and bears the slogan."Be cool, stay hot,
live green." The thermoses can preserve the tem
perature of both hot and cold liquids.
The reusable thermoses are part of Stanford
Dining's Live Green campaign. Past projects in
clude composting in student residences, providing
biodegradable to-go containers and purchasing
organic food from local producers.
"Live Green has a lot of initiatives, so every
one's involved and constantly thinking of new
projects we can take on," said Erin Gaines '07, sus
tainable foods coordinator for Stanford bining.
"The thermos distribution is very visible to stu
dents, but it's just one part of the culture of sustain
ability we are trying to create."
While current projects suggest environmental

ly-friendly options to students, the Live Green
campaign has more active plans in mind for the fu
ture.
"Stanford Dining is going to start charging stu
dents 35 cents for disposable cups to encourage
the use of the Live Green reusable thermoses and
therefore reduce waste and costs," Gaines wrote in
an email to The Daily.
Some students are dissatisfied with the new
thermoses and the rules that go with them.
"1 think the thermoses are a move in the right
direction, as long as people aren't throwing those
away as well," said Emily Bachelder '10. "But it's
obnoxious and underhanded to give us something
without saying what they're taking away."
"1 think a rewards system would be better." she
added.
According to Gaines, some students are having

trouble with properly using the thermoses, leading
to messy spills.
"Maybe we should attach directions or some
thing" Gaines said. "You're not supposed to
drink directly from the thermos; you're sup
posed to pour liquid from the thermos into
something else, like the cap, which is shaped like
a small cup."
In addition to the thermos distribution, Live -
reen is organizing other projects across campus.
Students are currently working on the creation of
a program to recycle cooking oil into bio-diesel
fuel. To learn more or get involved, visit Stanford
