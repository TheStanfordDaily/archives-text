## Expo showcases martial arts Ten campus groups aim to recruit freshmen

"lchi-Ni-San-Shi" shouted demon
strators last night, kicking off the Stan
ford Martial Arts Expo at Burnham
Pavilion with a fierce combat exhibi
tion.
Over fifty undergraduates, gradu
ate students and community members
attended the second annual expo. Dur
ing the evening, ten campus martial
arts groups treated attendees to a brief
taste of their skills, hoping to recruit
new members.
"The expo is the best opportunity
for students to decide what practice
they would like to try," said Shotokan
Karate Club President Nick Cizek, a
graduate student in physics. "We can't
really show what we're about at a nor
mal activities fair."
The expo is the only time each year
when students can see the great diver
sity of martial arts programs available
at Stanford all in one room. Perfor
mances included Brazilian Capoeira,
the traditional Filipino martial art Es
krima, Taekwando, Judo, Aikido,
Wushu, Shotokan, Jujitsu and Kenpo
Karate. Styles varied from graceful
routines to combat sequences, one of
which involved swords.
A question and answer session fol
lowed the demonstrations, and each
audience member had the opportunity

to speak with individual groups.
Freshmen made up approximately
half of the audience at Burnham Pavil
ion. Most students came with little ex
perience in martial arts, hoping the
expo would spark a particular affinity
for one practice or another, but some
had more particular motives for at
tending.
Samantha Perlman '11 said she
came because she saw martial arts
shows at New Student Orientation and
wanted to learn more. A Resident As
sistant in the Kempo program inspired
Aaron Kalb '11 to attend the expo,
though he admitted his primary com
bat sport was fencing.
Praveen Shanbhag. a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, related a horror
story of a recent trip to England that
inspired him to learn martial arts.
While at a bar. he said, he witnessed the
inappropriate pinching of a young fe
male by an inebriated townie and felt
compelled to defend the woman, only
to realize he lacked the physical means
to defend himself against the assailant.
He came to the expo hoping to find the
most "damage-inflicting" martial arts
practice to adopt and was considering
either Aikido or Jujitsu.
No matter what students' reasons
were for attending, martial arts groups
are hopeful that the Martial Arts Expo
helped them recruit new members.
Each club stressed that beginners were
welcome all first quarter and should
stop by their on-campus practices.
