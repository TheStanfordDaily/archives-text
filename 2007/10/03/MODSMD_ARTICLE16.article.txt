## Women open season at ITA Championships 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to describing the Stanford
women's tennis team roster, the word turnover
is a huge understatement. In each of the last
two years, the Cardinal squad has lost their top
two players from the previous year, most re
cently Teresa Logar *07 and Anne Yelsey '07.

Yet expectations for the Stanford women
have not diminished.
Gunning for an auspicious start to their
2007-2008 campaign, the Cardinal will travel to
Pacific Palisades, Calif, to compete in its first
big test of the fall season, the Riviera/Intercol
legiate Tennis Association (ITA) Women's AII
- Tennis Championships. The tourna
ment starts tomorrow and concludes on Sun

day.
Returning ITA Ail-Americans senior C'elia
Durkin, junior Jessica Nguyen and sophomore
Lindsay Burdette will represent Stanford as
competitors in the main draw of the singles. All
three will compete in a field of 32 top-ranked
players.
Durkin. Nguyen and Burdette. however,
will not be joined by fellow teammate Whitney

Deason . who lost 6-0.6-4 to Lenka Broosova
of Baylor yesterday in the qualifying round of
the Championships.
In the doubles qualifier, Burdette and
Nguyen suffered a similar fate, losing 8-3 to
Elizabeth Lumpkin and Stephanie Wetmore of
UCLA. Burdette was a late substitution for
Durkin, who had been slated to play with
Nguyen.
Despite the early qualifying round losses,
the team is in prime position for the singles
main draw — all three Cardinal representa
tives are in the top-20 of the ITA preseason
rankings.
Durkin, Nguyen and Burdette are ranked
ninth, fifteenth, and sixteenth respectively —
all career-highs.
However, history is against the Card. Its last
singles title at the Championships was in 1 WO,
and their last doubles title in 2000.
As the Card enter the new season, there are
many interesting story lines developing — can
the team reclaim the national championship
after losing to UCLA in the semifinals last
year? Can Stanford move on with the loss of
Logar and Yelsey? Who will step up in place of
last season's leaders?
In fact, the last Cardinal woman to reach the
finals of the singles draw was Erin Burdette 05,
older sister to Lindsay.
In her first taste of the All-American Cham
pionships, the younger Burdette will have the
chance to avenge her sister's final round loss to
Kops-Jones of California four years ago.
The ITA Women's Ail-American Tennis
Championships marks the first of four tourna
ments in the Cardinal's fall season. Next up,
Stanford will head home to host the ITA
Northwest Regional Championships.
In January, Stanford will begin its team sea
son against UC Davis, looking to start another
impressive win streak (the Cardinal ran off 8 l )
straight wins before losing to Georgia Tech last
February).
But. like any other season, Stanford's quest
for their fourth title in five years begins at the

players have moved on and how
many questions linger.
One thing's for sure though —
only time can tell whether this story
has a happy ending.
