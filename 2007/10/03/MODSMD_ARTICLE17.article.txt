The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team
has a host of experienced upperclassmen
throughout the middle of the lineup. Red
shirt seniors Rachel Buehler and Shari Sum
mers anchor the defense and midfield and
four juniors populate the starting lineup.
Hut recently, the team has been getting its
spark from a superb four-player freshman
class that has made a seamless transition
from high school soccer to playing for one of
the top college teams in the country.
This season, goalkeeper Kira Maker,
midfielder Allison McCann. and forwards
Christen Press and Morgan Redman joined
a Cardinal squad that retained nearly all of
its key players from 2006. The quartet also
started life on the Farm behind an outstand
ing class from the previous year. Led by
now-sophomores Kelley O'Hara, Kristin
Stannard and Ali Riley, that group of re
cruits was named the sixth-best in the
NCAA for their year by women's soccer
web site soccerbuzz.com.
The new group was only ranked 28th in
this year's evaluations, but the rankings
clearly don't tell the story. All four freshmen
have quickly made their mark on the 2007
season for the Cardinal. Injuries to the team
gave each of the freshmen an early chance,
and all of them seized the opportunity to
show what they could do.
Redman, with four goals and two assists,
sits atop the Stanford stat sheet with 10
points alongside redshirt senior Shari Sum
mers (5 G,O A). Redman also has two all-im
portant game-winning goals to her name.

Press is close behind with three goals and
three assists, while Maker has four wins, a
shutout, and a 0.67 goals-against average in
five starts. McCann's contribution does not
show up in the box score the way her team
mates' do, but she has been just as impor
tant. A prototypical quick midfield ball-win
ner. McCann has broken up opposition pos
session countless times this season and
starts Stanford counterattacks with accurate
passing.
Redman and McCann were the first of
the freshmen to step on the field, and they
made a quick impact. Redman, a slick and
speedy wing-forward, scored her first colle
giate goal twelve minutes before the end of
the team's first game against Boston Uni
versity to ice a 2-0 victory. McCann checked
into the Stanford midfield in the same game
and has scarcely left it since, starting the
next nine contests in a row.The two were the
only substitutes used by coach Paul Rat
cliffe in that first weekend.
Press, another skilled, two-footed for
ward, had to wait until the next week to get
on the field and she marked the occasion by
assisting on the Cardinal's equalizer against
then-No. 2 Notre Dame. After that she per
formed admirably during O'Hara's short in
jury-forced absence, running comfortably
down both wings before cutting inside and
hitting shots on goal with either foot.
Maker got her first start later than the
others but has been no less impressive. Ap
pearing against then-No. 12 Rutgers, the
athletic netminder made four saves in a 4-1
decision and has allowed just three goals in
over 400 minutes of play.
The keeper's experience is a perfect ex
ample of how the freshmen have found suc
cess. The support of their veteran teammates
has been critical. In Maker's case, senior
goalie Erica Holland and junior Alex Gam-

ble have been her guides.
"Erica has been a mentor
through it all," Maker said. "I'm
learning about how to interact with
the defense from her."
Speaking more generally about
the support the freshmen have got
ten, Maker said, "We're getting
thrown into a group of incredibly
dedicated, skillful individuals.
They've been really great helping
the freshmen to get adjusted."
Still, the frosh realize that they
have fought for playing time on a
team that won 15 games without
them last year, and that nothing is
guaranteed.
"It's a privilege to get on the
field and play in a team that's been
together this long," Maker said.
"I'm playing on a week-to-week
basis."
If Maker and the others keep
contributing in similarly effective
fashion, these four players will be
permanent fixtures in the side for
the entirety of their careers on the
Farm.
