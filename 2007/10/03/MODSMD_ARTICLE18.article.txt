# MLB Playoffs heat up
## 
### 
While ESPN was in the midst
of showing us the New Eng
land Patriots stomping the
Cincinnati Bengals in predictable
fashion, there was, in fact, a real game
being played elsewhere. A game that
had immediate implications — win or
go home. A game that surpassed even
the most enthusiastic hype.
For those of you who haven't
heard, the Colorado Rockies are in
the playoffs. Yes, those Colorado
Rockies. And if you haven't seen the
highlights of this game yet. do.
The Rocks won in the most dra
matic of fashions, overcoming a two
run deficit in the bottom of the 13th
inning. Colorado was facing an all
time great in San Diego Padres closer
Trevor Hoffman, and yet it was Matt
Holliday.Todd Helton,Troy Ililowitz
ki and co. who went on to win 9-8 and
are set to face Philadelphia in the
opening round of the playoffs.
On the heels of the New York
Mets' late season collapse, the Phillies
improbable rise and the Yankees'
midseason rebirth, perhaps it should
n't surprise anyone that the Colorado
Rockies are in the playoffs. But it
does. Say it to yourself aloud and
you'll note the distinct clash between
the words' Rockies' and playoffs' that
sounds as awkward as the gap be
tween Cubs' and contenders.'
But the Cubs are in the hunt as
well, and along with the previously
mentioned Phillies and the Cleveland
Indians, they will have a golden op
portunity to break out of a tradition of
countless years of disappointment
and mediocrity.
All in all. there couldn't have been
a better start to baseball's postseason
than the single game tie-breaker be
tween the Rocks and the Pads, a regu
lar season contest in name only. It was
the kind of game that reminded you
that for the MLB, the postseason
means that all bets are off.The certain
ties contained in the ridiculously im
mense sample size that is the 162-game
regular season vanish in the five and
seven game sets played in October.
That's led to some pretty enter
taining baseball in recent years. From
the 83-win Cardinals to the wild card
Red Sox. baseball's postseason ride
has seemingly been more exciting
than ever.
Which is why the almost inevitable
Yankees World Series Championship
this year is so hard to stomach.
Believe me, 1 wish I were predict
ing something else. I wish I really
thought that the Cubs. Phillies. Dia
mandbacks or Indians were the fa
vorites in this thing. But they're not.
Instead, it's the Yankees who seem to
have assembled the perfect storm of a
team that can't help but win titles.
At midseason. their collapse was
epic, and we all questioned whether it
was fair to write them off. They start
ed July at .500. But by the end of Au
gust. they were 14 games above that
mark and held on to finish the season
at 93-68.
The Yankees have a lineup that is
the envy of the major leagues, led by a
true superstar with something to
prove. Third baseman Alex Ro
driguez's play was legendary this sea
son, as the highest paid player in base
ball tried to shed his 'choker' label.
Of course, that particular stigma can't
be shed in the regular season, but hit
ting 56 homers with 156 RBI and a
.422 on-base percentage sure doesn't
hurt. A-Rod carried the Yankees in
2007. but for him to be viewed as a
clutch player, the bulk of his work is
still in front of him. Frankly, that
should terrify you if you're not a fan of
the pinstripes.
Not that A-Rod is a one man show
(though at times he certainly can be).
Surrounded by a more-than-compe
tent veteran lineup, the Yankees fea
ture a starting rotation with boatloads
of experience and a bullpen starring
the accomplished Mariano Rivera as
well as rookie sensation Joba Cham
berlain, the Yanks may just be the
most well rounded team out there.
Their only Achilles heel could be their
lack of a true ace to lead their rota
tion. which can create a big hole in the
postseason.
Still, it's New York that would ap
pear to have just the right mix of expe
rience, late season momentum, star

power and mystique to get the job
done. Plus, it's been far too long since
Steinbrenner's boys won it all —just
how long do you think the rest of the
league can hold their almost $200
million roster at bay? That's approxi
mately eight times the amount of the
league's lowest payroll, employed by
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
I hope I'm wrong. I hope that
somehow the Cubs avoid another
Bartman-esque incident, or the
Phillies suddenly find a pitching staff
aside from young phenom Cole
Hamels. I hope the Indians or Rock
ies break out of their decade long
slumps. I hope the Red Sox, Angels
or Diamondbacks can rediscover
some of that October magic that pro
pelled them to their own champi
onships this decade.
But I think that come November,
the whole of New York and most of
America will be praising this latest
incarnation of the pinstriped powers
from the Bronx.

Denis Griffin is delusional to think
that A ■ Rod will show up for this year's
playoffs. Let him know what you
think at djgriff@stanford.edu.
