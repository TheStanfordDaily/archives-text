## Senate discusses Rumsfeld, Old Union 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At the opening meeting of the
Ninth Undergraduate Senate last
night, the ASSU addressed controver
sial campus issues before targeting its
goals for the coming months.
Senator Patrick Cordova 09 dis
cussed the highly contested appoint
ment of former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumseld to begin the meet
ing. 1 le called attention to Rumsfeld's
position of distinguished fellow at the
Hoover Institution. Although Cordo
va refrained from voicing his own
opinion or that of any other senators,
he did acknowledge the approximate
ly 3.700 students that have signed the
petition opposing Rumsfeld's ap
pointment.
"While I would certainly not be of
the opinion that the Undergraduate
Senate should hold the power to invite
or uninvite faculty to participate in the
academy." Cordova said."l do feel as if

it is the role of the Undergraduate
Senate to he an advocate on behalf of
prevailing undergraduate opinion."
He encouraged other members of
the Senate to become involved in the
issue by staying in contact with the stu
dent body and proposing a solution
that reflects the majority's consensus
regarding Rumsfeld's appointment.
As the meeting progressed.
Jeanette Smith-Laws, assistant dean
for student unions, announced plans
regarding Old Union. She said that the
staff is still collecting ideas to improve
the newly renovated student center.
"We want to make it feel like it's
[the students') union," she said, "al
ways open and available."
All Old Union rooms are currently
open until 2 a.m. If student groups de
sire to use the space, sign-ups are easi
ly available, and groups can register up
to two years in advance.
ASSU Vice President Mondaire
Jones "09 updated the Senate on sum
mer progress regarding a variety of

campaign promises, which he is spon
soring with ASSU President Hershey
Avula '08. He highlighted the revival
of the Course Guide, the site that pro
vides students with online access to
students' comments and advice re
garding academic classes.
"Hershey and 1 negotiated the
issue of the Course Guide," Jones said.
"It's not really as visible as we had in
tended it to be, but we are working on
it."
Finally. Jones discussed the
ASSU's goal to push for gender-blind
housing for next year's draw. A com
mittee will be formed to focus on es
tablishing gender-neutral housing in
more than just co-ops.
The meeting concluded with time
allotted for brief updates from each
committee, but such news was scarce,
since most committees will be holding
their first meetings this week.
