## Community rallies for kids' health 
### DEVIN BANERJEE 
A crowd of doctors and faculty gathered at
Stanford Medical Center yesterday to rally in
support of a Congressional bill that would reau
thorize the State Children's Health Insurance
Program (SCHIP).
Last week, the bill passed both the Senate
and the House of Representatives, but the 265
votes collected in the House fell short of the
two-thirds majority required to override Presi

dent George W. Bush's expected veto.
"We are frustrated," said Arti Desai, a pedi
atric resident at Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital, part of the Medical Center. "1 think it's
ridiculous that Bush is trying to create some
kind of political game with this issue."
Implemented in 1997, SCHIP is a federal
program that provides health insurance for
uninsured children whose families earn too
much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford
private insurance. The 10-year program will ex

pire if Bush overrides the Congressional reau
thorization.
The President has said that the new bill,
which would expand the program's $5 billion
annual budget to $12 billion, is too expensive.
Furthermore. Bush has said he believes the
reauthorization would be an unnecessary step in
the direction of federalized health care.
Medical professionals at Stanford are not the
only ones speaking out in defense of
the bill. Thirty-five hospitals and
medical schools across the country
are holding their own similar events,
and participating institutions nation
wide are signing up daily.
"The small spark here has spread
to this national, raging fire," said Lisa
Chamberlain, a professor of pedi
atrics and a pediatrician at Stanford
Hospital."And as a litmus test to you

in Washington, if you have pediatri
cians across the country angry at
you, things are not going well."
The motto of yesterday's rally
was, "Stand for SCHIP. Stand for
kids," but underlying personal con
victions were evident in the speeches.
"The individuals that we're
speaking for can't speak for them
selves," said Medical School Dean
Philip Pizzo in reference to the 6.6
million children who currently rely
on SCHIP coverage for their basic
medical needs.
"It really is imperative for each of
us to take a stand on their behalf,"
Pizzo added.

"Children covered on these pro
grams are not numbers to us," Cham
berlain said. "They are faces and sto
ries and lives."
Pizzo ended his speech with a
message to the audience.
"Unite your voices,speak for chil
dren and make your message clear to
those who are in elected office that
we stand for children," he said, "and
that if they don't, at some point we
will make our voices well-estab
lished in terms of their futures as
well."
