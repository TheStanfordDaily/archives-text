# Endowment GROWS AGAIN
## Despite volatile economy, endowment fund continues decade of steady increase 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
It was another red letter year for
Stanford's endowment fund, which
grew about 23 percent to $17.2 billion,
as of Aug. 31.
ITie net gain alone amounted to
$3.1 billion, a figure larger than the
gross domestic product of Barbados.
And over the last decade. Stanford's
pool of money has grown an average
of 15.1 percent every year.
John Powers MBA '83, the endow
ment fund's chief executive, cau
tioned on Tuesday that the likelihood
of sustaining 20-plus percent annual
returns is low.
"The last four years, with the bene
fit of hindsight, will look like an in
credible golden period for endow
ment management, where literally all
cylinders were firing," he said during
an hour-long interview over breakfast
at the Faculty Club.
"Everything clicked," he added.
"It's fairly unprecedented that all seg
ments of the endowment pool will
perform as well as they have."
ITie financial markets roiled over
the summer when the market for sub
prime mortgages collapsed, setting off
a chain reaction that caused some
hedge funds to default and invest
ment companies to suffer painful loss
es.
Even though performance returns
were reported as of June 30 — before
the market corrections — Powers
said the endowment fund was still up
for the summer and that the Universi
ty avoided the kinds of hits that some

large funds sustained. ITie $17.2 bil
lion figure for the endowment was as
of Aug. 31. the end of Stanford's fiscal
year.
The potential for further market
declines and volatility concerns Pow
ers and his team of investment gurus,
so they are being cautious and have
taken a dim view on the credit mar
kets.
"We don't believe the shocks of
July and August have worked their
way completely though the system."
he said. "We still think risks in the do
mestic and global economies aren't
fully represented in the credit mar
kets."
He said the equity markets "have
actually rallied really strongly" since
August.
"To us." he said, "there still seems to
be a potential disconnect between
sources of risk in the economy and ef
fervescence in the equity market."
IT\e world's third largest university
endowment — behind only Harvard
and Yale — contracts with top man
agers in every sector to manage its in
vestments. The net result is a diversi
fied portfolio with long-term hori
zons. Risk is mitigated by spreading
out investments and using sophisticat
ed financial instruments designed to
limit downside potential.
Powers, wearing a light tan suit
coat,carefully pondered and thought
fully parsed his language as he reflect
ed on the endowment fund's perform
ance. An alumnus of the Graduate
School of Business, he took the helm
last year after Michael McCaffery
left with some of the fund's senior
0 managers to found his own compa
ny — Markena Capital.
Several other endowment lead
ers have left for the private sector,
where they can usually earn more
money. Most notably, after less than
two years on the job. Harvard's Mo
hamed El-Erian said last month
that he would return to work for his

old investment company in South
ern California at the end of the
year.
Powers said he has no intention
of leaving.
"I have no plans to do anything
other than this," he said, explaining
that he has re-staffed the Stanford
Management Company, which
oversees the University's invest
ment pool, and spent a long time
rethinking its investing methodol
ogy.
A group of lawmakers on Capi
tol Hill has been salivating over
burgeoning college endowment
funds.The Senate Finance Commit

tee held a hearing last week about
requiring more disclosure from the
generally secretive funds and in
creasing the amount that a college
needs to spend every year from its
endowment.
Lobbying groups have largely
come out against any changes.
"We're watching carefully,"
Powers said. "We'll respond as the
regulatory environment changes.
I'm confident that Stanford will be
in a pretty good place to adapt to
any change."
