## Portman talks finance 
### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Award-winning actress and social ac
tivist Natalie Portman addressed a packed
Kresge auditorium last night as part of the
Social Innovators Series, motivating her au
dience to fight poverty worldwide through
microfinance, an area in which the Holly
wood superstar has considerable experi
ence.
After a brief speech, the actress fielded
questions from the audience, which was
thoroughly impressed by the Golden Globe
Award winner.
Anthony Dick J.D.' 10praised Portman's
knowledge and presence during the event,
which was sold out.
"It was a riveting speech," he said, "full
of insights about how to implement pover
ty relief that actually works."
Laura Weidman MBA'o9attended Har
vard with Portman and spoke about the ac
tress' poise, intellect and commitment to
fighting global poverty.
"I was impressed — but not surprised
— with how she represented her cause,
fielded all sorts of questions and came
across as genuine for what she believes in,
standing in the forefront of what our pres
ent generation should be concerned with."
Weidman said.
Since graduating from Harvard in 2003,
Portman has served as Ambassador of
Hope for the Foundation for International
Community Assistance (FINCA Interna
tional), a leading microfinance organiza
tion that is committed to breaking the cycle
of global poverty.
FINCA has brought financial services to
hundreds of thousands of the world's low
est-income families by providing communi

ty-based savings opportunities and distrib
uting small business loans through its Vil
lage Banking Campaign.
Since its inception in 1984, FINCA has
helped more than 500,000 people over
come destitution and the organization
hopes to assist one million people by 2010.
FINCA concentrates on providing
socio-economic power to women out of a
firm conviction that women's financial in
dependence helps promote better educa
tion. nutrition and medical care while dis
couraging domestic violence and high
birth-rates among individual families.
"It has been absolutely compelling to
meet women who are ready to make deci
sions and break out of financial disenfran
chisement," Portman said."When you meet
a mother who is forced to sign a letter with
a thumb print because she can't read or
write and then you meet her daughter who
is graduating from university to go to med
school, this change all in one generation is
simply overwhelming. And it's only be
cause of microfinance."
Portman urged the audience to take in
dividual steps to contribute to microfinance
organizations through fund-raisers as well
as through online donations at www.vil
lagebank.org.
'The more microfinance organizations
are out there, the more competition there is
and it serves the interests of the poor," Port
man added. "Microfinance is not charity; it
is just widening opportunity for the people
who deserve it."
Portman also urged students to fight
poverty by using social-networking tech
nology, including MvSpace and Facebook.
