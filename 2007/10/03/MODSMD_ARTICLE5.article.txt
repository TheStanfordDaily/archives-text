## Senior quarterback suffers seizure Sunday, will miss Saturday's game 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
As if the odds weren't stacked high enough against
Stanford this Saturday as the Cardinal takes on the No.
2 USC Trojans in Los Angeles, another significant hur
dle materialized in the squad s path last Sunday.
Fifth-year senior and starting quarterback T.C. Os
trander suffered a seizure a day after his team's 41-3
home loss to Arizona State. Ostrander was watching for
mer teammate Trent Edwards of the Buffalo Bills take
on the New York Jets with current Cardinal teammates
at a local Palo Alto restaurant when he lost conscious
ness. He will not play against the Trojans on Saturday.
Ostrander was taken to Stanford 1 lospital, where he
underwent a series of tests. Me was released later that
day and will he re-evaluated on Monday.
Coach Jim Harbaugh said Ostrander will sit out Sat
urday's game against the Trojans.
"We are obviously happy for T.C. that all the tests
have come back normal." he said. "As a precautionary
measure, he will not suit up Saturday at USC"
Ostrander cited several factors that may have led to
his seizure, including a lack of sleep, dehydration and a
pain medication he had taken for the first time following
Saturday's game.
The senior signal-caller was still trying to come to
grips with the situation yesterday.
"Obviously it's tough to get my head around." Os
trander said in an interview with The Daily. "I never ex
pected anything like that to happen, but I think that we
have the situation well under control. So I 'm not worried
that it's going to last for more than this week, I'm
confident that I II be ready to go by next Tues
day."
"I was looking forward to this game [against
USC] for a while," he continued. "It's always a
great challenge to play a team that some would
call the best. It's a fun atmosphere down there."
Tavita Pritchard will start in Ostrander's place
for the Cardinal. The rcdshirt sophomore from
Tacoma. Wash, has appeared in three college
games, completing 1 of 3 passes for 10 yards.
"You hate to have an opportunity come like
this," Pritchard said.'T.C. is a good friend of mine
and having him go down like he did is something
you never want to see. But I've been preparing
my whole life for this, to be able to start at the Di
vision I Pac-10 level. So I'll definitely be ready "
Pritchard certainly has the genes to be an ef
fective college quarterback. His uncle. Jack

Thompson, starred at QB for Washington State in
the 19705, passing for a career 7,818 yards, a then-
NCAA record. Nicknamed the "Throwin'
Samoan,"Thompson went on to be the third over
all selection in the 1979 NFL draft
Asked what he brings to the table as a quarter
back, Pritchard touted his enthusiasm and love
for the game.
"Honestly, I think I just bring a passion for the
game," he said. "I love this game with all my heart,
[.ike coach said, I got bit by the football dog at a
very young age."
Ostrander is expected to accompany the team
to Los Angeles and was back in class on Monday.
Against Arizona State on Saturday, Ostrander
completed 20 of 35 passes for 237 yards and one
interception.
