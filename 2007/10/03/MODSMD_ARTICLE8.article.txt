October 3,1972: Cardinal
Returns Following Indian's
Ouster
Stanford athletic teams, having aban
doned the traditional Indian mascot for
the first time since Pop Warner instituted
the nickname in the early 1930'5, will
compete, at least temporarily, as the
Stanford Cardinals.
Cardinal, which represents a color,
not a bird, replaced the Indian as symbol
when a search by a committee of repre
sentatives from the Buck Club, an alum
ni organization; the Athletic Depart
ment; the ASSU; athletic teams; and
other concerned parties failed to find a
novel nickname which met with enthusi
asm. Stanford employed the name Cardi
nals before adopting the Indian as mas
cot some 40 years ago.
Meeting last spring, the committee
recommended Thunderchickens, a nick
name given the football team's defensive
front four last season, as the best succes
sor. The name received little backing.
New Athletic Director Jack Ruetz ex
plains that lack of support probably
stems from the fact that Thunderchick
ens is "too narrow a term. It doesn't apply
to all sports."
The term, he says, refers only to the
football team. Ruetz says he cannot
imagine swimmers of wrestlers compet
ing under such a name. He believes the
name's ludicrous connotation would
draw ridicule.
Buck Club Chairman John Hurlbut
does not approve of the name because
"although it meant a lot last year, it
won't have ongoing significance. It's a
one-year thing."
Thus, with no popular new nickname,
the Athletic Department reverted to Car
dinals on a one year experimental basis.
Ruetz accepts the decision to ban the In
dian mascot as "cast in cement" and says
that the Athletic Department is now
working hard to discontinue use of the
symbol on office stationery and other ma
terials. I le doesnotbelieve that the Indian
mascot has a good chance of returning.
Assistant Director of Athletics for
Administration Bob Young suggests
that "after what we had to go through"
in terms of cost and time to change the
nickname, another change would be too
difficult.
He believes that, even if the Universi
ty does officially adopt the name Cardi
nals, the Athletic Department will not
employ it to the same degree as it did the
name Indians. Rather, Young says, they
will make useof the name "Stanford" it
self to replace the Indian, for example.on
office stationery.
At present, the nickname of Cardi
nals has encountered little resistance.
Though a conservative alumni group
known as the "New Founders' league"
has urged in its publications the rein
statement of the symbol, general accept -
ance of the name Cardinals seems likely.
John Hurlbcrt sums up the present situa
tion of the Stanford nickname by con
cluding that "by lack of action, my guess
would be that we'll stay with Cardinals
for a while."
