## Activist talks LGBT history Popular author connects fight for gay rights with broader struggles 
### SHELBY MARTIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Transgender activist and author Leslie Feinberg
spoke to a group of over 100 listeners in Pigott Hall last
night about how LGBT struggles dovetail with the strug
gles against racism,poverty and imperialism.
Feinberg. who prefers the gender-neutral pronouns
"ze" and "hir," delivered a brief overview of LGBT histo
ry, starting with an account of how colonial oppression
brought misery to LGBT individuals. Spanish imperial
ists castrated native men for homosexual activity; the
British imposed anti-sodomy laws across Africa and
Asia; and the French brought anti-gay legislation to
Lebanon.
According to Feinberg, many of the conquered soci
eties had previously been tolerant of LGBT expression.
The histories of those cultures have been ignored by their
conquerors, explained Feinberg, and it is easy to assume
that LGBT communities have always been marginalized
simply because they are now.
'•'Things have changed throughout history, and they
can change again." Feinberg said.
Feinberg also discussed the Stonewall Rebellion, a
1969 clash between patrons of a gay bar and the police ar
resting them.The Rebellion was a watershed event in the
gay rights movement, and Feinberg explained that it was
inextricably tied to issues of race and class struggle. 'The
first person to fight back against her arresting officers
was Silvia Rivera, a homeless transgendered Latina.
Homeless youths living in a park across the street from
the bar joined the riots and threw pocket change at the

police.
It was the first time LGBT people fought back, said
Feinberg. and their captors found out that "a stiletto high
heel in the hands of an enraged transgender youth was a
formidable weapon against police oppression."
After Stonewall,gay rights advocates allied with groups
fighting racism, poverty and war, Feinberg explained.
"Before there was a Pride flag, we carried the North
Vietnamese flag," Feinberg said, referring to protest
against the Vietnam War.
fluey Newton, leader of the Blaek Panthers, famously
stated that the black liberation movement should be al
lied with the women's and gay liberation movements.
Labor leader Cesar Chavez was often found marching in
solidarity at gay pride rallies, waving the United Farm
Workers flag.
Feinberg concluded the talk by decrying anti-immi
grant laws, economic sanctions against Cuba and the war
in Iraq, calling for "rainbow solidarity" in the struggle
against oppression.
"Our LGBT movement has to be there," Feinberg
said. "We need to revive the spirit of Stonewall."
Feinberg is the author of "Stone Butch Blues," the
story of a masculine girl coming of age in the gay commu
nity of the 19605. Feinberg's most recent novel is "Drag
King Dreams," about a group of political activists in post
-9/1 1 New York.
Feinberg has also written two non-fiction books about
transgender issues and is a high-ranking member of the
communist Workers World Party.
After Feinberg's talk, listeners lined up to get copied
of their books signed, clutching copies of "Stone Butch
Blues" and nearly shaking with excitement to meet the
author of the landmark novel.
"I'm starstruck," said Jenna Queenan '11. "I've been
looking forward to this since August."
