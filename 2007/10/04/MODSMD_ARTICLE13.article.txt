BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) Move over "Leave Britney
Alone Guy." And all you cute little kitten videos, too.
The University of California, Berkeley, is joining the
You Ilibe generation, posting course lectures and other
campus happenings on the popular Web site.
"To a teacher who has a passion for teaching, this is
enormously exciting," said physics professor Richard A.
Muller. whose "Physics for Future Presidents." is among
the courses available online. "My students are every
where and 1 don't have to give them exams."
Berkeley and other universities have been broad
easting a variety of courses on the Web for some time.
The new venture, formally announced Wednesday, now
puts the Berkeley courses on You'Ribe.
Watching the videos is free and for the joy of infor
mation only, you won't get course credit.

"It's not meant as a substitute for going to class. You
can't interact; you can't be part of that dialogue," said
Ben Hubbard, co-manager of webcast.berkeley, a local
site delivering course and event content as podcasts and
streaming video.
Still, there's lots of interest from people outside cam
pus and even outside the country. Muller gets e-mail
from all over the world - "Even Timbuktu!" - and Hub
bard said course videos previously distributed online
through Google, Youllibe's parent company, scored
more than a million hits and about 7(X).(XX) downloads.
UC-Berkeley launched an audio podcast program
with more than 25 courses in 2(XXi and is slated to deliv
er 86 full courses (audio and/or video) and more than
100 events - 3,500 hours of content - in 2007.
More than 300 hours of videotaped courses and
events are now available at http://www.youtube.com/
ucberkeley and the catalog will be ex
panded.

"People from all walks of life have
access to this material," Hubbard
said. "We get just a ton of notes from
people who are lifelong learners."
Berkeley's courses join an eclectic

mix of content on You lube that
ranges from cute pet videos to the
breakout rant of the young man
known as "Leave Britney Alone
Guy," for his tearful defense of the
singer's much-panned performance
on the MTV Video Music Awards.
Muller, who started podcasting a
few semesters ago and is known for
presenting physics in an innovative
and relatively simple to understand
way, has found his audience is as di
verse as it is far-flung.

"1 get e-mails from high school stu
dents, 1 get e-mail from college stu
dents, people who graduated and
never learned this stuff. People listen
to this because they enjoy learning,"
said Muller, who is at work on a book
under the same title as his course that
he plans to have ready before Elec
tion Day.
1 le's happy to be part of YouTUbe
U.
"People who watch Youtube - it re
ally becomes a habit," he said.
