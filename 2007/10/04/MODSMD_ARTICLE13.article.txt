BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) Move over "Leave Britney
Alone Guy." And all you cute little kitten videos, too.
The University of California, Berkeley, is joining the
You Ilibe generation, posting course lectures and other
campus happenings on the popular Web site.
"To a teacher who has a passion for teaching, this is
enormously exciting," said physics professor Richard A.
Muller. whose "Physics for Future Presidents." is among
the courses available online. "My students are every
where and 1 don't have to give them exams."
Berkeley and other universities have been broad
easting a variety of courses on the Web for some time.
The new venture, formally announced Wednesday, now
puts the Berkeley courses on You'Ribe.
Watching the videos is free and for the joy of infor
mation only, you won't get course credit.

"It's not meant as a substitute for going to class. You
can't interact; you can't be part of that dialogue," said
Ben Hubbard, co-manager of webcast.berkeley, a local
site delivering course and event content as podcasts and
streaming video.
Still, there's lots of interest from people outside cam
pus and even outside the country. Muller gets e-mail
from all over the world - "Even Timbuktu!" - and Hub
bard said course videos previously distributed online
through Google, Youllibe's parent company, scored
more than a million hits and about 7(X).(XX) downloads.
UC-Berkeley launched an audio podcast program
with more than 25 courses in 2(XXi and is slated to deliv
er 86 full courses (audio and/or video) and more than
100 events - 3,500 hours of content - in 2007.
More than 300 hours of videotaped courses and
events are now available at http://www.youtube.com/
