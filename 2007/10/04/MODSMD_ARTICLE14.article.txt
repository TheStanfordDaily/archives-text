## Editorial Board Backup for Burma 
### 
Most of you have probably heard
something about the late summer
protests taking place in the isolated
Southeast Asian country of Burma (see note
at bottom).The last major uprising, which oc
curred in August 1988. resulted in 3,000 re
ported deaths. Then, as now, the overwhelm
ingly Buddhist nation's much-revered monks
took part in the protests and "overturned the
begging bowl" — an act of defiance in which
the monks refused alms offered by the mili
tary, denying the oppressive leaders the legit
imacy that giving alms to monks provides.
Then, as now, no international forces inter
vened. Does this have to be the case? If a peo
ple want change and are willing to risk their
lives to produce it, then shouldn't we help?
The answer is that we must help, and that we
may have to use force.
That is not to say that we should choose to
use force unthinkingly On the contrary,force
should only be used under very specific cir
cumstances and with very specific aims.
While invading Iraq without knowing for
sure about the existence of weapons of mass
destruction does not satisfy these conditions,
helping a people who are committed to strug
gle against a remorselessly oppressive mili
tary junta does. The situation in Burma is
quite different from Iraq. These differences
validate discussion about helping the
Burmese in ways that we shouldn't have tried
to help the Iraqis.
The Iraqis were not committed to strug
gle. Democracy is something that only works
when people really want it — after all, it's the
people who have to make it work.There is no
display of desire greater than mass protest in
the face of potentially deadly repercussions.
If the Burmese do not relent, if the current
pause in the protests is really just the calm be
fore the storm, then this is the opportunity we
must seize to free them. Whereas the interna

tional community denounced American uni
lateralism preceding and during the Iraq war,
it seems that the entire Western world is unit
ed behind the Burmese.
But why should we ever use force? Aren't
sanctions enough? Don't we live in an age
where diplomacy is supposed to solve prob
lems? Yes, ideally. Unfortunately though,
sanctions are often ineffective. In a military
junta, sanctions can often hurt the people
without affecting the government.
It seems that providing external pressure
would be an effective way to get the military
regime's attention and compel them to coop
erate with the citizenry'. After all, if uprisings
within the country are paired with resistance
from the outside, the junta will surely have to
make concessions. Of course, external pres
sure does not necessitate foreign troops
marching into the capital. If the global com
munity were to arm rebels or opposition
groups, incremental change might follow. So
far, pressure has been in the opposite direc
tion, with the United States encouraging
Shan rebels in the east to make peace with
the central government.
If the Burmese do not get help soon, our
window of opportunity will close, and it may
not be open again for some time. To encour
age and show support for the oppressed
Burmese, the international community must
stand firm against the military government.
The countries with the closest ties to Burma,
China and Russia, have so far been unwilling
to intervene. Which leaves the United States,
the European Union and Burma's Southeast
Asian neighbors to unite to undercut the mil
itary junta and restore democracy to the des
titute country and its citizens.

Note: The mime Burma is used throughout this
editorial in place of Myanmar, in defiance of the
military junta's official name for the country.
