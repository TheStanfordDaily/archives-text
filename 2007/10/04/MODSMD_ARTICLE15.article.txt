## Fixing and not fixing the Electoral College 
### 
The Electoral College is widely regard
ed as a crappy institution. We ail re
member that moment in middle
school when it was explained to us that al
though everyone votes for President,
they're not actually voting for the President,
they're voting for someone who promised to
vote for the person they would have voted
for.
Substantively, the Electoral College dis
torts the voting power of different groups. In
the last two elections, people have obsessed
over the votes of a few thousand Floridians
or Ohioans, where ten thousand Californi
ans changing sides wouldn't have caused
anyone to bat an eye. As a result of the mag
nified power of a few, the moment someone
declares for President, they suddenly re
verse their previously sensible positions
about corn ethanol (a stupid way to power a
car), long-term nuclear waste storage
(smarter than leaving it in urban industrial
facilities). Cuba (where sanctions are the
only thing that's kept the Communists in
power) and the Confederate flag (never ap
propriate to fly over a state capitol).This is
because our electoral system makes lowa
farmers, small-town Nevadans, Miami
Cubans and South Carolina racists a decid
ing voice in national politics.
Incidentally, the counterargument —
that voters in small states should have more
voting power per person than voters in big
states to protect them from being drowned
out — is totally specious. One might as well
say that voters from smaller demographic
groups should have more voting power per
person to protect them from being drowned
out. For example, when it comes to selecting
the President, two votes if you're over
eighty, three if you're Native American, and
six if you're transsexual. From a purely
philosophical perspective, there's probably
a better reason to overrepresent transsexu
als than lowans — they are much more like
ly to be drowned out in political debates —
but "one person, one vote" is a tried-and
true way to end arguments about how many
votes each different person deserves.
So how do we kick our 2(X)-year-old anti
democratic habit? There are three propos
als. (The worst of which a group of Giuliani
supporters tried to put on the ballot in Cali
fornia this June, but we'll get there in a mo
ment.)
The most obvious way to get rid of the
Electoral College is through a constitution
al amendment. The prospects for this are
pretty low. however. Although most people
live in safe states (which arc ignored) or big
states (whose voice is diluted by the elec
toral college).there are enough states with a
vested interest in the status quo that a con
stitutional amendment is not possible.

A second, more promising possibility is
to get a group of reform-minded states to
gether to fix the system. Each state would
pass legislation that allocates its electoral
votes to the winner of the national popular
vote, instead of to the winner of the popular
vote in that state. When enough states had
passed the law. they would all go into effect
at once.The Electoral College would contin
ue to meet and some states would still allo
cate their votes based on their own choice,
but the majority of the Electoral College
would always go to the winner of the nation
al popular vote
The third possibility (call it the "Kai
plan") is for states to individually try to
game the system, allocating their votes in
clever ways to amplify their voice in a sys
tem where some votes count more than oth
ers. For example, California could pass a law
that said if you get 59 percent of the vote
here, you get all the electors; for 41 percent
you get zero; and for every percentage point
you get above 41 percent you get three elec
tors. This would make a large number of
electoral votes depend on the preferences of
a small number of Californians. just like in
Florida or lowa. Presto, we're a swing state!
The nominees would never stop campaign
ing here.
And then there is the "fourth option" —
the proposal the Republicans recently tried
to put on the ballot. It would have assigned
California's electoral votes based on how its
Congressional districts vote — winner
take-all within these boundaries, rather than
within the state as a whole. But because Cal
ifornia's congressional districts are gerry
mandered to be either safe for Democrats
or safe for Republicans, they are less com
petitive than the state as a whole. Politicians
would have even less reason to campaign in
California. Furthermore, the proposal only
made it less likely that the person Californi
ans vote for will become president — it uni
laterally would have given up the power we
have within the current electoral system.
The Republican proposal was withdrawn
earlier this week. It was over almost before
it started: the campaign squabbled with its
major donor, liberal activists geared up
quickly to defeat the initiative, and newspa
pers widely reported that it hadn't made
that much sense to begin with. Good rid
dance. But it might be worth taking this mo
ment as an opportunity to consider a sensi
ble piece of legislation that helps reform the
Electoral College and counts every vote
equally.
