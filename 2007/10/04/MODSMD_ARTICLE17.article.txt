# Ire and Vice
## Trimalchio on West campus 
### 
One from a few days before Stanford
ended. The Wednesday before gradu
ation we're doing our annual Senior
Case Day, a ritual that looks cheesy-barbaric
if you aren't in the fraternity, but carries
unimaginable depth of meaning if you are.
Someone had the idea to title this year's
event"The 300 Spatens," and so around 2 or
3 p.m. there I was in White Plaza gulping a
bottle of beer with a red cape tied around its
neck.
The last thing I remember is splashing
through the Claw with my bros and the
TriDelts and several others. Everyone 1
know from four years of school walks by in
all directions.The feeling of life following its
correct path, of reaching a particular moun
taintop of my existence, heaven on earth. My
memory fails me, I wake up the next day with
a couple headaches and my friend has to ex
plain to me how 1 walked up to President
Hennessy, wearing nothing but a swimsuit,
smelling like a case of beer and a pack of cig
arettes. and told him to go fuck himself.
Another moment. December of last year.
I 'm taking "Cinema and Ideology," the kind
of class that's mostly grad students. Stanley
Kubrick is the easiest and most fun filmmak
er we study. I'm delivering my final presenta
tion, an intensive examination of the films of
Michael Mann — "Heat," "The Insider,"
"The Last of the Mohicans" and "Collater
al." which might be my favorite film ever. I've
spent more time on this one presentation
than on every class before junior year com
bined. I'm talking about the American
Dream. I hate public speaking, yet I find my
self giddy with excitement while I throw out
paragraphs of High Filmspeak — visual mo
tifs, pastoral imagery, Marcuse's Great Re
fusal, post-deconstruction.
I am in the throes of intellectual ecstasy,
and in the back part of my mind I am realiz
ing this is what college is all about — devot
ing hours and days to schoolwork in the serv
ice of an academic exchange of ideas.The au
dience laughs at my PowerPoint jokes. The
teacher tells me I did a good job. A preten
tious grad student marvels at all the ideas I
teased out of Mann's movies:"! thought they
were just crime films." I am consumed with
disgust for her elitism and appreciation for
her appreciation. I wonder, not for the first
time, if I made a mistake when I decided to

balance study with socializing. I wanted to
make up for all the parties I missed in high
school. 1 tried to experience every level of the
Stanford social scene — frat shitshows, co
op smokeouts, dorm keggers, Beirut tourna
ments outside Suites, King's Cup in the fresh
man dorm, dancing the night away every S
enior Pub Night in what pass for bars in down
town Palo Alto. I flirted with soft drugs with
out committing to addiction. What's the sum
of a couple hundred parties? Is it really im
portant to meet other people? Would I have
been fulfilled spending four years in the li
brary?
What's the sum of
a couple hundred
parties? Is it really
important to meet
other people?

There's more stories I wanted to tell you.
That's why I started writing a column. 1 had
other reasons — get girls to sleep with me,
show up Dave Herbert. I thought the job paid
— but i always thought being a Daily colum
nist was a little bit noble. You know, journalis
tic integrity. Woodward and Bernstein, the
truth rubbing off in black ink on your fingers.
I didn't have any opinions, really; the first four
months I was writing from Berlin, so my
columns were basically "Look what cool shit
I'm doing in Istanbul/Prague/Munich/the

Riviera this week!" I just wanted to write
about all the things that everyone talked
about but 1 never saw in The Daily. Sex and
drugs, yeah, but also important stuff like reli
gion, depression and administrative
douchebaggery.
1 wanted to tell stories about Stanford.
Football players doomed to losing seasons.
Softball players cursed with winning seasons
no one noticed.The friends you make during
NSO that you never see again. A former
child star who could never match up to the
character he played on television, even if he
didn't walk around Sigma Chi flexing in a
wifebeater. What it was like when Facebook
debuted back in freshman year, when it was
just us and Harvard and Yale and Princeton.
Girls who got thin, dudes who got fat. Breast
implants. Antidepressants. Insomnia. Hyper
somnia. Paddling a blow-up canoe over Lake
Lagunita. Kissing the girl of my dreams in the
middle of El Camino Real. Our dear depart
ed CoHo, a place you learned to love even
though you never liked it — the bands that
no one listened to, the coffee tasting like fla
vorless crude oil, the awful books in the tiny
bookcase in the corner.The CoHo was where
you went to study when you didn't actually
want to study. Actually, that was my overall
impression of college.
One more. Fm watching "24 Hour Party
People" with my brother the night before
NSO starts. My life is packed into suitcases
— clothes, DVDs, a Playstation, a new
Apple computer. 1 know Fm probably
going to meet my best friends and the love
of my life tomorrow. I always thought Fd go
to the East Coast for college. Instead, we'll
drive down Foothill to campus and stop at
our favorite bagel shop along the way. I
can't enjoy the movie. I can't think straight.
High school feels very far away. I have no
idea what my life will look like 24 hours
from now.
I go to sleep and try to dream about some
thing. I wake up and go to Stanford.

Darren Franich 's Daily career can be summed
up thusly: Germany, drugs, bicycles, existential
ism, imaginary girlfriends, imaginary children,
Maureen Powers sucks, Nanci Howe sucks, my
life sucks, sexistentialism, remembrance of
things past, insert self-deprecatory chortle
