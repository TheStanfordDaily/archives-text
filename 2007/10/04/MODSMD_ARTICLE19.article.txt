should not be sold short.
I"he undefeated Cardinal (14-0,3-oPac-10)

rently has the second-best hitting percentage
in the NCAA at .4%, just below Penn State's
Christa Harmotto at .497; Akinradewo is three

Beavers with 20 kills, two aces and 14 digs;
Stanford hit over .4(H) for the match. In Corval
