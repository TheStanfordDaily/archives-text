## Admins review Gaieties Howe, Lythoctt-Haims require script approval 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Gaieties — the annual Big Game
show performed by Ram's Head The
atrical Society — has exercised com
plete freedom to playfully offend stu
dent groups since its 1911 inception.
But this year, administrators for the
first time requested the entire script of
the show, known for its comedic vul
garity, before production night.
In the past, only portions of the
script that included administrator ap
pearances were shown to the relevant
administrators for approval. This
year's writers were required to show
the whole script to Nanci 11 owe, direc
tor of student activities, and Julie Lyth
cott-l {aims '89, dean of freshmen and
transfer students.
"They are not there to censor, per
se." said Chade Severin '07, head
writer for this year's show, "but they
want to offer their perception in terms
of the student body as a whole, and to
assure that Gaieties isn't egregiously
offending anyone."
The show has become increasingly
vulgar in recent years. The 2004 script
used the word "f—k" 60 times, com
pared to one time in 1989.
"1 saw Gaieties a couple of years
ago for the first time since I was an un
dergrade said Raphe Beck '92. "and I
was amazed by how raunchy the show
was compared to the ones we did."
In the 2006 production, entitled
"From Cal With Love," a sketch in
volving University benefactor
Charles Mlinger and a group of Na
tive Americans aroused so much ire
from various student groups and ad
ministrators that it was cut from the
remaining performances.
Severin said that the new review
process has been instated partly to en
sure that a similar situation does not
occur again this year.
According to Severin. Howe insist
ed that, while she needed to see the
entire script, she only intended to dis
cuss — not censor — the show's con
tent.
Both Ram's Head and administra
tors came to the review meeting pre
pared to talk about potentially contro
versial jokes. During the meeting, the
writers defended their jokes while ad
ministrators explained why they con
sidered some jokes unnecessarily of
fensive.
Severin toldThe Daily that very lit
tle was actually changed as a result of
the meeting. However, she did ex
press concern about the preservation
of the show's theatrical tradition.
"1 would suggest to the adminis
tration in the future that they explain
their overarching goal for the show,"
she said. "Gaieties has a reputation,
and if we're going to stray completely
from that reputation, there needs to
be an explanation [from the Universi
ty before we write the entire script]."
Many alumni were adamant
that the self-regulation of years
past should be sufficient for the
University.
"You're supposed to push the
boundaries of what's acceptable, but
hopefully with the result of being
funny," said Michael Green '95, head
writer for the 1994 show. "If it's funny,
no one is going to care how far you
push it."
Green added that the plot for the
production he wrote revolved around
a University-wide conspiracy to rid
the campus of fun.
"It's like,'Oh wow. they're actual
ly doini> it,'" he said.
