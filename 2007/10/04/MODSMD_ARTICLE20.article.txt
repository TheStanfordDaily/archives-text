# Women open vs. SJSU
## Cardinal swimming and diving looks to start season with a splash 
### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving team likes to set the bar
high. Finding last season with a No. 1
dual-meet ranking (10-0), a second
place finish at the Pac-10 Champi
onships and fourth place at the
NCAA Championships, the women
expect nothing less than perfection
for the upcoming season.
The Cardinal will have its first
chance to test the waters at 1 p.m. this
Friday, October 5 against the San Jose
State Spartans in the Avery Aquatic
Center. In the last meeting between
the Card and the Spartans. Stanford
walked away with a sweeping victory
of 109-30. The women are hoping for
a similar rout this year. And with Stan
ford's tough combination of the finest
coaching, returning veterans and
promising freshmen, this year's out-

come shouldn't be too different.
Third-year head swim coach Lea
Maurer, an Olympic gold-medalist
swimmer and new inductee into the
Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame, is
back at the Farm with a notable
coaching resume and several return
ing All-Americans.
Maurer has been impressed with
the tenacity and spirit of this year's
squad.
"As a team we are hungry for more.
I"he swimmers are attacking work
outs. yet laughing the whole way,"
Maurer said.
Despite coaching Stanford to its
highest finish at the NCAA Champi
onships since 2(X)2, Maurer thinks her
team can perform even better this
season.
"We want to have more individuals
score at the NCAA meet,and we want
the people who did score last year to
move up," said Maurer.
Or. Rick Sehavone, who won the
NCAA Women's Diving Coach of the
Year award last season for the third
time, begins his 30th season as Stan
ford's head diving coach. His experi
ence and expertise will surely help his
five female divers contribute signifi
cantly to the team effort,even with the
graduation of 2007 NCAA Female
Diver of the Year, Cassidy Krug.
The team also boasts the addition
of five freshmen — four swimmers
and one diver — who are sure to help
the Card continue its winning ways.
All five will have the opportunity to
make an immediate impact.
"1 love the addition of the new peo
ple to the team," said Maurer. "They
are energetic, kind and hard working.
They have not said a negative word as
they have faced some really hard chal
lenges. They have been awesome."
This year's swim team will bring
both speed and depth in nearly every
event. Brooke Bishop, a Senior Nation

al Champion in the 50 free,will lead the
team in the sprint freestyle events,
along with juniors Madeline Rovira
and Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy. Ex
pect newcomers Kate Dwelley and
Julie Smith to score big right off the bat
in the sprint freestyle events.
'ITie middle-distance and distance
freestyle events will be led by sopho
more Whitney Spence and senior
Elizabeth Durot, last year's Pac-10
Champion in the 500 free. Even
though all three swimmers lost to
graduation were distance specialists,
Spence and Durot will use their expe
rience on the national level to make
up for the lost points.
Sophomore stars Julia Smit and
Elaine Breeden should also continue
to impress this season. Smit, the 2007
Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year, will
fight for her first individual NCAA
title this year in the backstroke and in
dividual medley events. Breeden. who
claimed the national title in the 200
butterfly as a freshman, looks for an
other banner season in the butterfly
and individual medley events.
Finally. 2004 Olympian Caroline
Bruce, a redshirt junior, headlines the
breaststroke events once again this
season, this time with freshmen Liz
Smith and Kerry Kraemer alongside.
After winning two NCAA titles her
freshman season. Bruce has been
plagued with injuries for the past cou
ple of years. She is finally back and
ready to top the nation once again.
According to Maurer, Bruce and
the rest of the senior class will be the
key to taking the team to the top.
"The senior class has led the team
since day one. They haven't stopped
yet,'" Maurer said.
And don't expect them to stop
anytime soon.
