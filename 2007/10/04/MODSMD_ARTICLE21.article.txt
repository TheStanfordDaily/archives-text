### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's three rounds down. four to go for freshman Alex
Clayton of the Stanford men's tennis team.
Clayton, from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has had a re
markable run in the qualifying bracket of the ITA Ail-
American Championships in Tulsa. Okla. However, his
run in the qualifying bracket is over — his victory yes
terday moved him into the main draw of the tourna
ment. which starts today.
Clayton dismantled lid C'orrie of Texas yesterday in
three sets. After losing the first set 6-4. he muscled his
way back and won the next two sets 6-1. 6-4. Clayton is
one of 16 qualifiers that advanced to the main draw out
of the qualifying bracket.
"I have had some tough matches thus far," said Clay
ton. "But 1 am getting used to the conditions out here,
and I couldn't be more ready to play in the main draw.
"I lost the first set today, but 1 knew 1 was wearing
[Corrie] down and I knew he would get tired. 1 just
kept playing the same way and eventually the tables
started turning."
lTiis is Clayton's first big collegiate tennis tourna
ment. but the young freshman has excelled, becoming
used to the conditions of the college game and gaining
more confidence with each match.
He moves on to play Robbye Poole from the Uni
versity of Mississippi in the first round of the main
draw.
"[Poole] is a retriever. He will put balls in the court
and will fight really hard. But I feel prepared and
ready."
Junior Matt Bruch will also start
play today in the main draw. Bruch
draws Treat Huey of Virginia, who is
the No. 13-ranked singles player in
the nation. I luey is also a part of the

No. 1-ranked doubles team in the
tournament, so both Bruch and
Clayton should have ehallenging
first-round matches.

Bruch also starts play today in
doubles with junior Blake Muller.
The No. 2-ranked duo will play Alex
Cojanu and Keziel Juneau of
William & Mary in the first round.
