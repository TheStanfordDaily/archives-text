# A
						season like no other
## 
### 
South Florida is No. 6 in the na
tion. Boston College is No. 7
and Kentucky is No. 8. Yes. I'm
talking about college football. And
no. this is not a joke.
In a weekend of college football
that one ESPN writer deemed "In
sanity Saturday." the No. 3.4,5.7 and
10 teams in the AP poll all lost last
Saturday. Nine of the top 25 teams
overall lost, leaving fans from
around the country with nothing
else to do than sift through the after
math.
It's an aftermath that has turned
the world of college football upside
down — a world where South Flori
da, a team that moved to the Foot
ball Championship Subdivision (for
merly known as Division 1-A) only
six years ago, is the sixth-best team in
the nation.
It's a world where Cal, better
known for its past ineptitude and
wayward tree-huggers, is the No. 3
team in the country and set to face
No. 2 USC in a colossal match-up in
just over a month.
Don't forget the likes of Ken
tucky or Boston College, either.
Kentucky, the traditional whipping
boy of the SEC, is now 5-0 and riding
behind Heisman candidate Andre'
Woodson. As for Boston College,
they haven't been this good since
Doug Flutie was throwing Hail
Marys and being carried off of the
field — which in case you don't re
member, was a long time ago.
It's a world where Hawaii has the
most prolific passer in the nation,
and maybe the best chance of any
team of going undefeated during the
regular season. And let's not forget
about Appalachian State, a Division
I-AA school which defeated a Mid
west power that shall remain un
named.
But wait a minute. South Florida.
South Florida? Yep. South Florida.
Nothing has been more indica
tive of this newfound parity in col
lege football than coach Jim Leav
itt's squad. A school once known for
— well, nothing — is shaking the
very foundations of college football
as we know it.
Already winners against then-
No. 5 West Virginia and then-No. 17
Auburn earlier in the season. South
Florida looks as if it's in the driver's
seat for the Big East Championship.
The team is led by its stifling de
fense. which shut down West Vir
ginia's double-threat of quarterback
Pat White and Steve Slaton two
years in a row.
Let's just take a step back,
though. Forget the talent, the num
bers and the match-ups and take a
second to internalize this simple
fact: South Florida is the sixth-best
team in the nation.
Seriously, what the hell is going
on?
As an avid fan of the sport myself,
I can't lie: 1 have no clue what to
make of this.
Unlike college basketball, which
saw a progressive and noted move
ment from its mid-major programs
over time, this explosion of football
nobodies has come out of thin air:
there wasn't a single columnist,
writer or purported expert who
could have called Appalachian State
beating Michigan or South Florida
sitting only one spot out of the na
tion's top five.
It's still to be seen how long this
apparent shift will last, however; it
could be just a week or two before
the Floridas. the Michigans and the
Oklahomas of the world are back in
their rightful positions.
For all we know. South Florida is
a good team but will fade down the
stretch. Boston College may have a
great quarterback but they play in
the watered-down ACC and will get
beat down once they play real com
petition. And Kentucky, well, we'll
find out how good they are soon
enough: the Wildcats face the brutal
gauntlet of No. 11 South Carolina
today. No. 2 Lousiana State the week
after and No. 9 Florida the one after
that.
At this point, it's impossible to
tell how good anyone is. Aside from
LSU and USC, any team in the top
ten could be a blatant fraud, stealing
