## ACLU weighs in on Calif, frat dispute 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ORANGE, Calif. (AP) The
American Civil Liberties Union
wrote to the president of Chap
man University on Wednesday on
behalf of a group students who
say they were banned from pro
moting their fraternity on cam
pus.
The letter, written by the direc
tor of the Orange County office of
the ACLU, comes after a two-year
dispute between the students and
the school over a national Jewish
fraternity.
The students applied to start a
new chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu
in 2006, but that request was re
jected. The university then in
structed the students not to wear
their Greek letters, host on-cam
pus events or recruit or meet on
campus, said Hector Villagra, the
ACLU director.
They also were told to take
down their Facebook page, he
said.
Villagra said those restrictions
violated the students' right to free
speech and free association. He
said the group has the right to re
main active on campus as a club
even if they have been rejected as
a Chapman-based chapter of

Sigma Alpha Mu.
The students held a news con
ference Wednesday near Chap
man University.They have not yet
filed a lawsuit, but Villagra didn't
rule it out.
"We hope that this can be re
solved quickly and painlessly be
cause there really is no need for
anyone to be hauled into court
over this," he said.
Pascal De Maria, 21, president
of Chapman's aspiring Sigma
Alpha Mu chapter, said not all the
students in the group are Jewish,
and he was not accusing the ad
ministration of anti-Semitism.
Chapman has a large Holocaust
education center.
Mary Piatt, a spokeswoman for
the university, said Sigma Alpha
Mu was one of 13 fraternities that
applied for chapter status at
Chapman in 2006. Only one was
accepted, in part because the cam
pus is so small, she said. The
school has six fraternities and five
sororities.
She said when the group con
tinued to post "rush" fliers and
meet after they were rejected,
university officials became con
cerned they were establishing
themselves as an underground - and
therefore unregulated - fraternity.
She said other Greek houses were
also frustrated with the group.
"We don't believe that the ACLU
is fully aware of all the facts and
they're operating on just one side of
the story." she said of the allegations.
Sigma Alpha Mu was founded in
1909 in New York as a Jewish frater
nity and now has chapters at more
than 60 U.S. universities.
