## Energy-saving lightbulbs distributed to frosh Dorms compete for 100 percent personal use of enviro-friendly bulbs 
### KT MERTES 
Freshmen were able to cross at least one item off
their shopping lists this fall â€” lightbulbs. Every stu
dent in the Class of 2011 was provided with compact
fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), thanks to a program
initiated by the Office of Residential Education,
Student Housing and the Campus Housing Efficien
cy Solutions Program of the Resource Solutions
Group.
In the U.S., home lighting accounts for roughly
one-fifth of total electricity use, making efficient
lighting options like CFLs a key to minimizing ener
gy consumption.
Stanford's CFL program was initiated by
Maricela Montoy 08, Mike Tom '08 and Paul Wilson
'08.The students, who were inspired by their experi
ences in the "Energy Saving Projects at Stanford"
class, pitched the idea to the Resource Solutions
Group with the support of Student Housing's Sus
tainability Coordinator Nik Kaestner.The Resource
Solutions Group agreed to provide the CFL bulbs
for the initiative.
Dorms in which all freshmen use the new bulbs
will win an ice cream party.
"[We are] very impressed with how responsive
freshmen were and how cooperative they are in
using the CFLs," said the three student organizers in
an email to The Daily, citing Paloma as an example
of a dorm that has already achieved total coopera
tion.
Incandescent lightbulbs convert 90 percent of the
electrical energy they use into heat instead of light,
while CFLs only convert 30 percent into heat. CFLs
also last about 10 times longer than incandescent
bulbs and use 75 percent less energy overall.

CFLs are more expensive than their tra
ditional counterparts, mostly be-

cause they contain more glass
and electronic components

and must be transported
from manufactur-

ing plants in
China. However,
when lights are
turned on for
more than two
hours each day, the

lower energy use and "
longer life spans of
CFLs translate into
lower electricity bills.

" Through the joint
conservation efforts of
students and our depart
ment retrofit projects, we

have reduced annual hous
ing utility costs by $650,000,
which helps keep room rates in
check," said Rodger Whitney, exec
utive director of Student I lousing, in a

Stanford Report press release.
The light bulb project is Stanford's
largest student-led energy saving initiative to
date. The effort follows a 2006 pilot CFL ex-

change program in upperclassmen dorms operat
ed by Student Housing and Students for a Sustain
able Stanford. Student Housing is currently working
on extending the lightbulb program across campus.

"We are already working with Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford and the Sierra Club on phase two
and will be handing out CFLs to all undergrads
soon," Kaestner said in an email to The Daily.
Student Housing hopes to reach graduate stu
dents in the final phase of the project.
