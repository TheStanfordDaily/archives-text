# Crisis in Mexico
## PROFS CLAIM MASS FIRINGS AT FORMER STUDY ABROAD SPOT 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When Marcela Cuellar'oo looks back on
the quarter she spent at the Universi
dad de las Americas de Puebla
(UDLA) in Mexico, she remembers a
school "very comparable to Stanford."
She and other Stanford alumni have fond mem
ories of UDLA, where Stanford sponsored a winter
quarter-only program that lasted from 1998 to
2003, when it ended due to low enrollment.
"[Studying at the University] for me was a good
experience because it made me feel like they had
hope for the future in Mexico," said Violeta Bar
roso '00.
Today, the Mexican university is reeling, accord
ing to a number of UDLA student!) and faculty,
who estimate that nearly 70 professors and 120
staff have been fired or forced to resign since the
2005 appointment of the current rector, Pedro
Angel Palou.
Former UDLA Dean of Colleges and Interna
tional Relations Prof. Mark Ryan said that 24 full
time faculty were dismissed without formal review
in December 2005 and that 100 administrative
workers were dismissed in June 2006. The commu
nications and economics departments lost half
their full-time faculty last May. Ryan added.
The Firings
While UDLA administrators ignored repeated
requests from The Daily requesting comment, oth
ers involved with the school spoke at length about
the mass firings.
"Despite years of dedicated service, [professors]
were dismissed without any evaluations or re
views." Ryan, who was formerly an American Stud
ies lecturer at Yale, wrote in a statement. "The
cause, clearly, was merely their dissent, and the rec

tor's perception of them as a threat to his personal
power."
Ryan said the firings were often accompanied
by abrupt office lockdowns, computer impounds
and short-notice requirements to vacate university
quarters.
" ITiey reportedly were told that if they exer
cised a legal right to protest their firings, their sev
erance pay would be halved," he said.

"There is a climate of fear on campus
because nobody knows who will be the
next to lose their jobs."

Former part-time UDLA prof.

"Respected administrators who served UDLA
for decades were fired abruptly," added a former
part-time female professor who asked not to be
identified for fear of being banned from campus.
"There is a climate of fear on the campus, because
nobody knows who will be next to lose their jobs."
Toward the end of 2006. the administration
began enforcing a type of loyalty oath. Ryan said.
"A newly promulgated 'code of ethics' stated
that neither professors, employees nor students
could act in a way that 'negatively affects the insti
tution's image,'" Ryan said, quoting from the code.
"Any 'public declarations' that do not reinforce an
'image of the Institution as prestigious, solid, cohe
sive, pluralistic and open to dialogue and construc
tive criticism' implicitly became punishable, what
ever the reality."
Several professors also said that
Palou replaced the professors who
were fired with less qualified per
sonal supporters.
"Before UDLA's personnel di
rector was fired, he gave me the
names of seven political friends
Palou had hired as department
heads after firing their predeces
sors," said Neil Lindley, a former
member of the Consejo, UDLA's
advisory board. "The new people,
none of whom had university expe
rience, were paid three times the
salaries of those who were fired."
Alleged Conspiracies
Palou consolidated his power
further in May when he gained the
support of the Patronato — the
University governing board con
trolled by the Don Guillermo Jenk
ins family. One male professor who
asked not to be identified by name
said that Palou convinced Jenkins
that professors were conspiring
against the university.
"Guillermo Jenkins is an elderly
man now," the male professor said.
"He's ill. 1 think Palou's convinced
Jenkins that there are conspirators
and he's rooting out these conspira
tors. | Palou| fires anybody he sus
pects as not being loyal. He inter
prets loyalty as absolute approval
for what he wants to do."
Ryan said that Palou then fired
the university attorney and three
accountants investigating his fi
nances.
Lindley protested the firings,
emailing the Consejo and request
ing Palou's termination. Lindley
said he then received an email from
Eduardo Fermin Lastra.the UDLA
Provost, requesting his resignation
"due to incompatible views about
UDLA and its operation."
Lindley said that eight board
members soon resigned in protest of
the firings. I le added that Palou's of
fice then sent out a memo to all fac
ulty, staff and members of the Con
sejo. notifying them that the adviso
ry board would be dissolved.
Eighteen professors met in May
to discuss the firings at Ryan's
home, where they drafted a letter of
protest. A UDLA guard showed up
during the meeting, however, and
told Ryan to report to the Rector's
office, where he would sign his resig

nation. Thirteen of the professors
present at the meeting were fired,
Ryan said.
Palou then accused Ryan of con
spiring against the university.
"I was fired, although the official
version was that we — the group
that included Prof. Ryan — re
signed," said former Political Sci
ence and International Relations
Prof. Jose Luis Garcia-Aguilar. "
Under his paranoiac style of gov
erning, Palou called us 'enemies of
UDLA,' when in reality we wanted
reforms to stop the abuses of power
and return to the very essence of a
true university."
La Catarina
University affiliates also accused
Palou of censoring La Catarina, the
school's student newspaper.
Astrid Viveros, a recent graduate
and former La Catarina columnist,
said the communications depart
ment chair marched into the news
paper's office last January with sev
eral policemen and unplugged com
puters as Viveros tried to save files
onto a flash drive.
"They put a giant chain and lock
on the office door," said Monica
Cruz. La Catarina's summer editor.
"We felt like criminals."
The newspaper was reinstated a
few weeks later, following an inter
national media outcry, hut Viveros
and Cruz said that doing interviews
has been a nightmare for the staff,
with police taping them with video
cameras and trailing them home.
UDLA officials said the newspa
per enjoys free press rights.
"It is still functioning," wrote
UDLA spokeswoman Maria Lopez
Aguilar in an email to The Daily.
"We have total freedom of speech."
But Cruz said that when students
arrived on campus this fall, a new
staff took over the paper.
"I told the attorney we couldn't
publish until we had a guarantee
that censorship, threats and nega
tive consequences for writing at La
Catarina would never happen
again," she said. "It was not long be
fore La Catarina's advisor assigned
a new editor and asked him to form
a new staff."
A Damaged Reputation?
UDLA faculty now face two par

adoxical concerns — that recent
events may destroy the school's rep
utation and that they have gone
largely unnoticed by those who
could affect change.
Perhaps the most recognizable
name associated with UDLA is that
of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richard
son. who is also a Democratic candi
date for president. The UDLA Web
site lists Richardson as an honorary
member of the Consejo.
A spokeswoman at Richardson's
office said the Governor would not
answer questions about his relation
ship with UDLA.
Ryan and Lindley said that
Richardson is likely unaware of re
cent developments at UDLA, and
that the Consejo has been rendered
defunct.
"Honorary members never were
very active, except to be recog
nized at public functions," Lindley
said, adding that, "Richardson did
give a commencement address in
2003."
But UDLA has not gone without
sanctions from the international
community. According to Lindley,
Texas Christian University is in the
process of terminating its joint-de
gree programs with UDLA, and the
Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools (SACS) put the school
on "warning" status in January for
failing to provide evidence that its
governing board is not controlled
by minority interests and failing to
prove it has a "sound financial
base."
Faculty now worry about the de
teriorating reputation of what was
once one of the country's best uni
versities. Ryan lamented the impli
cations of the controversy for Mexi
co.
"Faculty, administrators, stu
dents, employees and alumni have
seen their university decline from a
place of participatory governance
and free and open expression into
an authoritarian milieu of repres
sion and fear," he said. "They now
find that the work of decades — to
create a first-rate, secular, private
and cosmopolitan university for
Mexico, and a bridge among Amer
ican nations — is unraveling."

to discuss the firings at Ryan's
home, where they drafted a letter of
protest. A UDLA guard showed up
during the meeting, however, and
told Ryan to report to the Rector's
office, where he would sign his resig

nation. Thirteen of the professors
present at the meeting were fired,
Ryan said.
Palou then accused Ryan of con
spiring against the university.
"I was fired, although the official
version was that we — the group
that included Prof. Ryan — re
signed," said former Political Sci
ence and International Relations
Prof. Jose Luis Garcia-Aguilar. "
Under his paranoiac style of gov
erning, Palou called us 'enemies of
UDLA,' when in reality we wanted
reforms to stop the abuses of power
and return to the very essence of a
true university."
La Catarina
University affiliates also accused
Palou of censoring La Catarina, the
school's student newspaper.
Astrid Viveros, a recent graduate
and former La Catarina columnist,
said the communications depart
ment chair marched into the news
paper's office last January with sev
eral policemen and unplugged com
puters as Viveros tried to save files
onto a flash drive.
"They put a giant chain and lock
on the office door," said Monica
Cruz. La Catarina's summer editor.
"We felt like criminals."
The newspaper was reinstated a
few weeks later, following an inter
national media outcry, hut Viveros
and Cruz said that doing interviews
has been a nightmare for the staff,
with police taping them with video
cameras and trailing them home.
UDLA officials said the newspa
per enjoys free press rights.
"It is still functioning," wrote
UDLA spokeswoman Maria Lopez
Aguilar in an email to The Daily.
"We have total freedom of speech."
But Cruz said that when students
arrived on campus this fall, a new
staff took over the paper.
"I told the attorney we couldn't
publish until we had a guarantee
that censorship, threats and nega
tive consequences for writing at La
Catarina would never happen
again," she said. "It was not long be
fore La Catarina's advisor assigned
a new editor and asked him to form
a new staff."
A Damaged Reputation?
UDLA faculty now face two par

adoxical concerns — that recent
events may destroy the school's rep
utation and that they have gone
largely unnoticed by those who
could affect change.
Perhaps the most recognizable
name associated with UDLA is that
of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richard
son. who is also a Democratic candi
date for president. The UDLA Web
site lists Richardson as an honorary
member of the Consejo.
A spokeswoman at Richardson's
office said the Governor would not
answer questions about his relation
ship with UDLA.
Ryan and Lindley said that
Richardson is likely unaware of re
cent developments at UDLA, and
that the Consejo has been rendered
defunct.
"Honorary members never were
very active, except to be recog
nized at public functions," Lindley
said, adding that, "Richardson did
give a commencement address in
2003."
But UDLA has not gone without
sanctions from the international
community. According to Lindley,
Texas Christian University is in the
process of terminating its joint-de
gree programs with UDLA, and the
Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools (SACS) put the school
on "warning" status in January for
failing to provide evidence that its
governing board is not controlled
by minority interests and failing to
prove it has a "sound financial
base."
Faculty now worry about the de
teriorating reputation of what was
once one of the country's best uni
versities. Ryan lamented the impli
cations of the controversy for Mexi
co.
"Faculty, administrators, stu
dents, employees and alumni have
seen their university decline from a
place of participatory governance
and free and open expression into
an authoritarian milieu of repres
sion and fear," he said. "They now
find that the work of decades — to
create a first-rate, secular, private
and cosmopolitan university for
Mexico, and a bridge among Amer
ican nations — is unraveling."

When Marcela Cuellar'oo looks back on
the quarter she spent at the Universi
dad de las Americas de Puebla
(UDLA) in Mexico, she remembers a
school "very comparable to Stanford."
She and other Stanford alumni have fond mem
ories of UDLA, where Stanford sponsored a winter
quarter-only program that lasted from 1998 to
2003, when it ended due to low enrollment.
"[Studying at the University] for me was a good
experience because it made me feel like they had
hope for the future in Mexico," said Violeta Bar
roso '00.
Today, the Mexican university is reeling, accord
ing to a number of UDLA student!) and faculty,
who estimate that nearly 70 professors and 120
staff have been fired or forced to resign since the
2005 appointment of the current rector, Pedro
Angel Palou.
Former UDLA Dean of Colleges and Interna
tional Relations Prof. Mark Ryan said that 24 full
time faculty were dismissed without formal review
in December 2005 and that 100 administrative
workers were dismissed in June 2006. The commu
nications and economics departments lost half
their full-time faculty last May. Ryan added.
The Firings
While UDLA administrators ignored repeated
requests from The Daily requesting comment, oth
ers involved with the school spoke at length about
the mass firings.
"Despite years of dedicated service, [professors]
were dismissed without any evaluations or re
views." Ryan, who was formerly an American Stud
ies lecturer at Yale, wrote in a statement. "The
cause, clearly, was merely their dissent, and the rec

tor's perception of them as a threat to his personal
power."
Ryan said the firings were often accompanied
by abrupt office lockdowns, computer impounds
and short-notice requirements to vacate university
quarters.
" ITiey reportedly were told that if they exer
cised a legal right to protest their firings, their sev
erance pay would be halved," he said.

"There is a climate of fear on campus
because nobody knows who will be the
next to lose their jobs."

Former part-time UDLA prof.

"Respected administrators who served UDLA
for decades were fired abruptly," added a former
part-time female professor who asked not to be
identified for fear of being banned from campus.
"There is a climate of fear on the campus, because
nobody knows who will be next to lose their jobs."
Toward the end of 2006. the administration
began enforcing a type of loyalty oath. Ryan said.
"A newly promulgated 'code of ethics' stated
that neither professors, employees nor students
could act in a way that 'negatively affects the insti
tution's image,'" Ryan said, quoting from the code.
"Any 'public declarations' that do not reinforce an
'image of the Institution as prestigious, solid, cohe
sive, pluralistic and open to dialogue and construc
tive criticism' implicitly became punishable, what
ever the reality."
Several professors also said that
Palou replaced the professors who
were fired with less qualified per
sonal supporters.
"Before UDLA's personnel di
rector was fired, he gave me the
names of seven political friends
Palou had hired as department
heads after firing their predeces
sors," said Neil Lindley, a former
member of the Consejo, UDLA's
advisory board. "The new people,
none of whom had university expe
rience, were paid three times the
salaries of those who were fired."
Alleged Conspiracies
Palou consolidated his power
further in May when he gained the
support of the Patronato — the
University governing board con
trolled by the Don Guillermo Jenk
ins family. One male professor who
asked not to be identified by name
said that Palou convinced Jenkins
that professors were conspiring
against the university.
"Guillermo Jenkins is an elderly
man now," the male professor said.
"He's ill. 1 think Palou's convinced
Jenkins that there are conspirators
and he's rooting out these conspira
tors. | Palou| fires anybody he sus
pects as not being loyal. He inter
prets loyalty as absolute approval
for what he wants to do."
Ryan said that Palou then fired
the university attorney and three
accountants investigating his fi
nances.
Lindley protested the firings,
emailing the Consejo and request
ing Palou's termination. Lindley
said he then received an email from
Eduardo Fermin Lastra.the UDLA
Provost, requesting his resignation
"due to incompatible views about
UDLA and its operation."
Lindley said that eight board
members soon resigned in protest of
the firings. I le added that Palou's of
fice then sent out a memo to all fac
ulty, staff and members of the Con
sejo. notifying them that the adviso
ry board would be dissolved.
