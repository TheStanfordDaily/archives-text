# Crisis in Mexico
## PROFS CLAIM MASS FIRINGS AT FORMER STUDY ABROAD SPOT 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When Marcela Cuellar'oo looks back on
the quarter she spent at the Universi
dad de las Americas de Puebla
(UDLA) in Mexico, she remembers a
school "very comparable to Stanford."
She and other Stanford alumni have fond mem
ories of UDLA, where Stanford sponsored a winter
quarter-only program that lasted from 1998 to
2003, when it ended due to low enrollment.
"[Studying at the University] for me was a good
experience because it made me feel like they had
hope for the future in Mexico," said Violeta Bar
roso '00.
Today, the Mexican university is reeling, accord
ing to a number of UDLA student!) and faculty,
who estimate that nearly 70 professors and 120
staff have been fired or forced to resign since the
2005 appointment of the current rector, Pedro
Angel Palou.
Former UDLA Dean of Colleges and Interna
tional Relations Prof. Mark Ryan said that 24 full
time faculty were dismissed without formal review
in December 2005 and that 100 administrative
workers were dismissed in June 2006. The commu
nications and economics departments lost half
their full-time faculty last May. Ryan added.
The Firings
While UDLA administrators ignored repeated
requests from The Daily requesting comment, oth
ers involved with the school spoke at length about
the mass firings.
"Despite years of dedicated service, [professors]
were dismissed without any evaluations or re
views." Ryan, who was formerly an American Stud
ies lecturer at Yale, wrote in a statement. "The
cause, clearly, was merely their dissent, and the rec

tor's perception of them as a threat to his personal
power."
Ryan said the firings were often accompanied
by abrupt office lockdowns, computer impounds
and short-notice requirements to vacate university
quarters.
" ITiey reportedly were told that if they exer
cised a legal right to protest their firings, their sev
erance pay would be halved," he said.

"There is a climate of fear on campus
because nobody knows who will be the
next to lose their jobs."

"Respected administrators who served UDLA
for decades were fired abruptly," added a former
part-time female professor who asked not to be
identified for fear of being banned from campus.
"There is a climate of fear on the campus, because
nobody knows who will be next to lose their jobs."
Toward the end of 2006. the administration
began enforcing a type of loyalty oath. Ryan said.
"A newly promulgated 'code of ethics' stated
that neither professors, employees nor students
could act in a way that 'negatively affects the insti
tution's image,'" Ryan said, quoting from the code.
"Any 'public declarations' that do not reinforce an
'image of the Institution as prestigious, solid, cohe
sive, pluralistic and open to dialogue and construc
tive criticism' implicitly became punishable, what
ever the reality."
