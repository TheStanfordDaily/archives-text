# Rape reports on the rise

### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Statistics reveal nine rapes reported on
campus in 2006, other crimes also increasing

Reported sex offenses at Stanford
spiked in 2006. according to the latest
Safety & Security Report, released last
Friday by the Stanford Department of
Public Safety. Of notable interest, the
annual tally showed that the number of
on-campus forcible rapes reported to
the police jumped from zero in 2005 to
nine in 2006.
The statistics are particularly rele
vant in light of a string of recent sexual
assault cases, including a sexual battery
incident that took place outside of

Kimball Hall last Monday night. But
officials hope to quell any fears of a
possible campus predator, indicating
that a jump in reported incidents does
not necessarily reflect an aetual rise in
sex crimes.
The magnitude of the increase in re
ported rapes came as a shock to offi
cials. After reviewing the 2006 figures,
Stanford Police Deputy Chris Cohen
det consulted Vaden Health Center
yesterday about the possibility of any
counting mistakes or double reporting
of figures. I le concluded, however, that
"this increase reflects the training and educational efforts
through Public Safety and Vaden."
"1 do not feel that there has been an increase in sexual as
saults." he said, "but feel that there has been an increase in re
porting."
Sandy Davis, the director of the YWCA Rape Crisis Cen
ter in San Jose, which maintains a branch center on campus,
held a similar view.
"When we look at Stanford and see that it has taken a
jump." Davis said, "we're guessing it's not about a greater
number of incidents but a greater willingness to come forward
and report."
The numbers most likely do not indicate the presence of a
predator. Davis added. Since the departure of the "serial grop
er" who prowled campus on a bicycle several years ago. no sex
ual predators have been suspected on campus.
Davis explained that her center established the Stanford
branch roughly two years ago, making an "educated guess"
that its presence may have coincided with the spike in the
number of reported sex offenses.
"Students are more aware of the resources available to
them and are more likely to use them," Cohendet added.
According to the Safety & Security Report, alcohol- and
drug-related arrests also rose in 2006. as did on-campus rob
beries. Burglaries have steadily decreased in recent years and
on-campus bicycle thefts have also dropped, although bikes
parked outside dorms were hit particularly hard in 2006.
