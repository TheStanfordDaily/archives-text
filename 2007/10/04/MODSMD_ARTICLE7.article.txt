## TV show takes swipe at Stanford ExxonMobil research conflict borrowed for script 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the space of 60 minutes, last Tues
day's episode of "Boston Legal" man
aged to combine the laughably absurd
with the starkly real in a not-so-subtle
swipe at Stanford.
The season premier of the hit series
— featuring an elevator sex scene be
tween Stanford's fictional legal counsel
and actor James Spader — managed to
touch on one of the most heated debates
currently surrounding the nation's top
research institutions.
Stanford and other leading universi

ties that have accepted research funding
from oil companies took a prime-time
blow last week as the ABC show bor
rowed facts from a real-life Stanford
controversy. The episode essentially re

GCEP's association with ExxonMobil.
On "Boston Legal," a Stanford grad
uate and lawyer at the firm reneges on a

$3 million donation to the University
under circumstances identical to Bing's.
During a courtroom scene dialogue, the
character addresses many of the real-life
concerns surrounding GCEP's contro-,
versial association with the oil giant.
"Do we think for a second these [oil
company] contributions won't tilt these
findings?" the character, Shirley
Schmidt, asks. "I no longer trust that re
search. A study to explore alternative
energy sources essentially funded by an
oil company ... would you swallow
that?"
Series producer David E. Kelley's
studio said that he was unavailable for
comment this week.
" The show is fiction." said GCEP Di
rector Franklin Orr. formerly the dean
