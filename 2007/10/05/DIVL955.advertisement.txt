, , . T *" 4 Let's start off with a classic indie angst mixtape. This is the sort of mixtape you'll
want for long drives at night, all alone, with only the haunted memories of your
i Virata 112 past. It's the old trusty CD that you can pop in after a breakup, a terrible midterm

| TFf" Cure or New Order: An upbeat song by one of these bands will always
leave you blue. Just throw on that bouncy beat and start crying.

» 2) Strong and angsty — Modest Mouse: This band has gotten a little big as of
0 HkUfiJ &W9 ' ate> ul l^c ' r ear| y was incredibly indie and incredibly angst-ridden.
ikib£4 Just pick something with crashing, noodly guitars and Isaac Brock screaming.
3) Cassiotone for the Painfully Alone: The name says it all. Ambiant, repetitive
slow-burners riff with 20-something depression.
4) Velvet Underground: Choose something morose and spacey — preferably
something referring to the angst of substance abuse.
12) Explosions in the Sky: Most EITS songs start slow then build to a crescendo.
This is perfect for the final track. Best of all, most of them are so achingly beau
tiful that they may make your life a bit more redeemable.

?<■ mtt, ~,juo Now we 'II touch on the romantic mixtape. The social politics involved with the romantic
lit ,1, mixtape arc best summarized by the theatrical production "A venue Q." In this musical,
n T a girl receives a mixtape from the guy she has a crush on. She searches frantically for signs
— in the title of the songs — that the guy likes her back.

V, jr M 1) Pet Sounds-era Beach Boys: Nothing says innocent, idealistic romance like "God
i cn Only Knows." The harmonies and orchestral arrangements are just so dreamy and fun.
2) Sufjan Stevens: It might be hard to find a specifically romantic song from this folk
ster, but so many of his songs evoke a wistful, melancholy mood that he might be a good
choice.
3) Iron and Wine: Sam Beam's breathy vocals and bleeding heart lyrics will surely melt
the heart of any listener. It's just so tender and loving!
4) Elliot Smith: Try something a bit more upbeat, without the biting cynicism.
12) Damicn Rice: He has that one song about staring at you a lot. It's all vocals and
1 angst and heartache. The a capella ending seals the deal. Great last impression.
Well, there you go. I'm sure in some capacity you were aware of the art of the mixtape.
It's a set of invisible rules that we all live by. All you need is a message, iTuncs and a CD.
