## Researchers unveil geology milestone 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Stanford geologists were part of
an unveiling yesterday of the first
rock samples extracted earlier this
month from an underground shaft
beneath the San Andreas Fault, ef
fectively setting a milestone in geol
ogy with possibly great scientific
consequences.
The four-inch wide cylindrical
samples of ash-colored rock were
lilted from a borehole that intersect
ed the San Andreas Fault at an angle
roughly 2.5 kilometers beneath the
tiny town of Parkfield,located at the
center of the California Central Val
ley. Parkfield, known as the "Earth
quake Center of the World." is par
ticularly seismologically active, and
researchers said the removed rock
would offer an unprecedented cross
section look at how tectonic plates
rub together as earthquakes are
born.
" I'llis physically takes us down
into the earth where that instanta
neous earthquake deformation oc
curs," National Science Foundation
(NSF) Researcher Kaye Shedlock
said while describing the drilling
process at a press conference yester
day morning. Before a crowd of two
dozen journalists and Bay Area tele
vision cameramen. Shedlock ex
plained that for decades, geologists
have wondered about the dynamic
workings, mineralogical makeup
and presence of fluids along the
Earth's faults.

"These questions could only be
answered by going down to where
the action is," Shedlock said.
Stanford geophysicist and princi
pal investigator Mark Zoback exu
berantly compared geologists' ex
traction of the rocks to astronomers
obtaining "moon rocks" for the first
time. Scores of geologists from
across the world are expected to de
scend upon Stanford in December
for an official unveiling to scientific
circles, and the University will likely
share some material with dozens of
research groups, the researchers
said.
While researchers acknowledge
that the elusive science of earth
quake prediction remains a distant
dream, they may now be able to at
least identify some usable predic
tors.
ITie borehole extended through
an area that annually sees hundreds
of thousands of tiny earthquakes,
some with all the force of a textbook
falling to the ground. The scientists
say that because even the biggest
earthquakes — such as the 9.3 mag
nitude quake off the Indonesian
shore that triggered the devastating
tsunami in late 2004 — begin as tiny
slippages along the faults, the ex
tracted rocks will effectively be
snapshots of nascent earthquakes.
Stanford, in conjunction with the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and
the NSF. began to drill in 2004 as part
of the first phase of the $25 million
San Andreas Fault Observatory at
Depth (SAFOD) project. The San

Andreas Fault is of particular inter
est to researchers because it is very
"slippery" — meaning plates slide
against each other unusually fre
quently. But for some reason, this
friction often does not cause the
massive earthquakes that would
occur elsewhere.
The samples extracted by
SAFOD may have already provided
an effortlessly vivid answer to this
old question of how the plates gently
slide.The samples on exhibit yester
day revealed streaks of a bluish
green mineral in the rock called ser
pentine. which is made of remnants
of ancient oceanic crust. Serpentine,

powder — when subjected to high
temperatures and water with silica.
And just like that,geologists have
made at least some headway on a
few of the most compelling ques
tions that previously stalled the field
for decades.
"We have the ability to answer
long-standing questions that people
have puzzled about for 40,50 years "
Zoback said. "The future is indeed
bright. The science will make
tremendous advances by having this
material."
