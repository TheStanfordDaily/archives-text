### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Professors from Stanford and George Mason
Universities received a five-year, $7 million
grant from the U.S. Department of Education
late last week. Prof. Sam Wincburg. chair of the
history education group at the School of Educa
tion, and George Mason History Prof. Roy
Rosenzweig were given the award for their de
velopment of an online clearinghouse for histor
ical education.
Wincburg worked with George Mason His
tory Prof. Roy Rosenzweig to propose the Web
site for K-12 history teachers, and the two pro
fessors received the government grant on Sept.
28.

"We were just notified that we had won a
competitive grant from the federal government
last week." Wincburg said on Wednesday.
"Today was actually our first conference call be
tween us and our partners in D.C."
Work will begin immediately on the site,
which aims to provide history teachers with cen
tralized access to online materials and better
teaching methods. According to Wincburg, over
the next five years, the project has the ability to
changc the way history is taught and received in
schools across the country.
"There is a huge potential for having a direct
impact on tens of thousands of people and the
people who study history," he said.
Sections of the site will include history edu
cation news, teaching materials and the best

practices for effective learning. There will also
he a policy research section with monthly policy
and practice roundtahle discussions that feature
scholars from Stanford and other campuses.
"That site is just getting underway," Wineb
urg said. "We wiil have the initial shell of the site
with preliminary resources done by the new
year. We will populate with content,or continue
to add information, in each of the succeeding
years of the five-year grant."
VVineburg and Roscnzweig have experience
with online history resources. In 2005. they de
veloped their first Web site,"Historical Thinking
Matters. I unded by a $500,000 Brant from the
William and Flora Hewlett Foun
dation. the project focused on cen
tral topics in U.S. history, emphasiz
ing the importance of reading pri
mary sources and critiquing histor
ical documents.
While "Historical Thinking Mat
ters" will continue running along
side the new Web site, Wineburg
said he never expected it to lead to
the clearinghouse project.
"We never in a million years
imagined that it would lead to some
thing like this," he said. "No one
knows how these things work out."
Daisy Martin, the associate di
rector for "Historical Thinking
Matters," will be the project direc
tor for the new project and oversee
its day-to-day operations.
"We couldn't have done this
project without her partnership,"

Wineburg said. "She has been in
strumental to the entire process."
Although the process is just be
ginning, Deborah Stipek, dean of
the School of Education, agreed
that the project would have a large
influence on those in the academia.
"This multimedia Web site will
make available materials that will
help teachers make history come
alive for students," she said in a
press release, adding that it will,
"foster their understanding of his
tory as an active process of inquiry
and analysis rather than facts to re
member."
Wineburg is excited for what lies
ahead and its potential impact on
the academic community.
"It makes Stanford, with George
Mason, one of the addresses for
being at the center for how stu
dents learn history and how teach
ers teach it,"he said. "It's going to
change the wav we do things."
