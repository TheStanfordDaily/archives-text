## Lake Lagunita sign confuses students 
### DEVIN BANERJEE 
Frequenters of Lake Lag and the
Stanford community in general
know all too well the irony of the sign
posted next to what many would in
stead refer to as a crater: "Welcome
to Lake Lagunita. Water activities
(swimming, boating, windsurfing,
etc.) are permitted at your own risk."
But a new sign, recently installed
on the trail surrounding the lake, has
caused a stir among the disillusioned:
"Reservoir 2 Maintenance Project
— Phase 3. Flushing water being dis
charged to Lagunita."
In fact, the two-week-long proj
ect. which began Sept. 26. is bringing
water to the barren land, but not for
the purpose of filling the lake. In
stead. water is being drained from
Domestic Water Reservoir 2. located
between Lake Lag and the Dish, for
cleaning purposes.
"We're gradually draining the
six-million-gallon reservoir for its

periodic cleaning," said Bob Hock
ey, a civil engineer with Stanford Fa
cilities and Operations. "You have
to wash it out because there's dust
and stuff."
As the manager of the Reservoir
2 Maintenance Project. Hockey
noted that the rate at which water
will be entering Lake Lag is far too
small to create any \ isible difference
in the water level.
"When the project is complete,"
Hockey said, "the lake will show no
more [water] than it does now."
As for the possibility of Lake Lag
ever being filled, that is up to the win
ter rains and diverted water that nor
mally flows from the nearby San
Francisquito Creek. According to
Hockey, though, the past year has
been one of the driest on record, and
the University has no current plans
to fully fill the lake.
