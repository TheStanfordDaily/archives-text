# GRADUATE LIFE
## Grads turn out strong for first orientation NGSO success in its first official year 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
When undergraduate freshmen
arrived on campus Sept. 18, they
weren't the first new students to be
welcomed to Stanford. Just one day
before. New Graduate Student Ori
entation (NGSO) began, and by the
end of the week, the first-of-its-kind
event was a success.
In addition to the traditional annu
al reception held by President John
Hennessy and his wife and the Grad
uate Orientation Activities Lunch
and Information Event (GOALIE),
NGSO revived the tradition of hold
ing a welcome barbeque. offered in
formation sessions and introduced
student group open houses, all well
received by many students.
Coordinators Farooq Khan and
Polina Segalova, both graduate stu
dents in mechanical engineering,
along with the Graduate Life Office
and 34 graduate student volunteers,
were behind the orientation. This
year's increased activities were meant
to welcome graduate students to the
Stanford community, much like in
coming freshmen.
Christine Griffith, then-associate
dean of the Graduate Life Office, said
that about 8(X) students attended the
welcome barbeque, which she noted
was an old tradition that had been
abandoned back in the 1980s.
"It was a freezing night.only about
55 degrees outside." Griffith said.
"But people were willing to come and
mingle, despite the weather."
For the information sessions,
which were collectively called "Grad

School 101." Griffith s;iid that aruund
200 students attended each ofthinour
sessions, amounting again to about
800 overall.
"It was all about passing along
some wisdom to new students, allay
ing some fears and answering ques
tions that are difficult to be answered
by anyone other than students who
have already gone through graduate
life," Griffith said.
Segalova felt that the events suc
ceeded in helping graduate students
acclimate to their new lifestyles, as
well as allowing them to meet their
peers.
"A lot of people stayed up to an
hour after each session just to ask
questions, talk and get to know each
other, which was exactly what we
were going for," she said. "1 think a
great gauge of the success of each of
our events was how many people
would stay after the actual program
had ended."
As for the community group open
houses, which featured organizations
like the ethnic group centers, the
women's center and the LGBT cen
ter. Segalova said that 20 to 50 stu
dents show up to learn more about
each community groups.
While Griffith said that she was
proud of the wonderful work of the
coordinators, she also credited the in
volvement of Vice Provost for Gradu
ate Education Patricia Gumport and
her own office.
"The vice provost and her staff
were a presence at so many of the ac
tivities. and we also had some faculty
who came as well."shesaid."lt wasn't
just the Graduate Life Office and the
students who were welcoming new
students. It was broad,through the en-
tire institution, from the president's
office to the vice provost of graduate
education, all the way to the students.
I think people really felt the amount
of value that graduate life and educa
tion was given at Stanford."
Regarding changes in the pro
gram for next year.Segalova said that
they might offer information sessions
at multiple times in order to reach the
largest audience because many stu
dents in the Medical School and the
Business School start classes earlier
than the rest.
But Griffith had a much simpler
plan.
"I might pick a night when it was
n't 55 degrees and the wind wasn't
howling to hold a barbeque," she
said.
