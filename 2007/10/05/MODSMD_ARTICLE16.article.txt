## Editorial Board Praise for USA PATRIOT Act rulings 
### 
The Editorial Board applauds a verdict
reached Sept. 26 when a district judge
from Oregon. Ann Aiken, ruled that
two provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act
were unconstitutional. Aiken argued that
the two provisions, which amended the For
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act, dismissed
the Fourth Amendment's requirement for
probable cause and allowed for unlawful
searches and seizures.The case under discus
sion was a common one, and the prosecutor,
Brandon Mayfield, was one of many whom
the government has mistreated using the
USA PATRIOT Act. Mayfield brought the
case to court after the FBI erroneously ar
rested and jailed him for two weeks in 2004
for suspected ties to the train bombings in
Madrid. Spain.
Such privacy issues are not unrelated to
Stanford and the world of academia. In the
spring of 2004. Professor Steven Kurtz of
the State University of New York (SUN Y),
Buffalo, woke up to find his wife dead.
When the paramedics arrived, they noticed
that Kurtz — who was working on a bio-art
project at the time — was in possession of
technical equipment that would normally
be found in a laboratory setting. Under ab
sunj provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act.
Kurtz was submitted to 22 hours of non-Mi
randized questioning. Moreover. Kurtz was
not allowed to return to his house to recov
er his wife's body until the Commissioner of
Public Health for New York State had in
vestigated samples of his project — a full
week later.
Aiken's decision against the controver
sial legislation came in a timely manner: it
was the second major blow to the USA PA
TRIOT Act from the U.S. District Court
level in less than a month. Only three weeks
earlier. New York's district judge Victor
Marrero deemed a different provision un
constitutional. I le stated that a section of the
USA PATRIOT Act, which authorized the
issue of a National Security Letter subpoena,
"offends the fundamental constitutional
principles of checks and balances and sepa

ration of powers." Writing on the USA PA
TRIOT Act's provision. Marrero noted that
the process was "constitutionally deficient
under the First Amendment in several re
spects." The first court denouncement of
the USA PATRIOT Act occurred in January
2004. when U.S. District Judge Audrey
Collins ruled that the act's ban on "expert
advice or assistance" was in violation of both
the First and the Fifth Amendments. Since
that time, the executive branch's act has been
under constant hut calm fire from both the
judicial and legislative branches of govern
ment. Rulings, amendments and calls for re
peal from both branches have had little ef
fect.
ITie USA PATRIOT Act was written in
the wake of the Sept 11,2001 attacks, in an at
tempt to fight terror and increase foreign in
telligence accessibility for law enforcement
agencies. I lowever. the act fails at successful
ly fulfilling its purpose; as Aiken wrote, "a
difficult balance must be struck in a manner
that preserves the peace and security of our
nation while at the same time preserving the
constitutional rights and civil liberties of all
Americans." Although Aiken agreed that
the goal had been "to break down barriers
between criminal law enforcement and intel
ligence gathering," she emphasized the re
sult was actually a ticket for the government
to ignore the Constitution's requirement for
probable clause.
The judges who have ruled against the
USA PATRIOT Act over the past three
years should be praised, as should the Con
gressmen and Senators who have written the
under-publicized bills condemning or re
pealing parts of the act. These actions, how
ever. are only stepping stones to a final and
necessary achievement .The government as a
whole, including the executive branch, must
decide against the underlying tenants of the
USA PATRIOT Act. Never should absolute
power he given to any part of the govern
ment. The liberties of American citizens
should never be sacrificed, regardless of how
well-intentioned the rationale.
