## Linguistic osmosis 
### 
I like.
Numchuck skills.
That's what she said.
When it comes to what to say, I've started
doing what all the cool kids are doing. From
movies to stand-up. I rapidly and all too will
ingly pick up the verbal catchphrases of pop
culture comedy and insert them into my
everyday vocab. I watch what we all watch,
and then 1 say what we all say. I. like so many
college kids, constantly undergo linguistic
osmosis.
The SNL shorts, comedy websites, and
You lube videos have made me into a verbal
lemming, vomiting back up the catchphrase
of the hour. Austin Powers just came out?
Yeah. Baby. Napolean Dynamite is all the
rage? Ill fry us up some kes-a-dill-as.
I am often amazed at how far the verbal
diffusion spreads. I hear "is nice" daily, and
not just from frat boys, but mousy girls,
stern-looking grad students and even from
my TA. When one person starts quoting
Mitch Hedberg, Dane Cook or Andy Sam
berg, everyone else jumps in with the punch
line.
I suppose the communal lexicon is a tes
tament to the power of marketing and com
mercialism — monkey see. monkey say.
It also extends beyond the movie world.
Brangolina. Bennfier and TomKat are part
of an ever-growing linguistic trend of our
celeb-obsessed culture. Gangstah, dawg,
hyphy, crunk, and wasty-face have swum
from rap and party cultures into mainstream
slang. Abbreviations are everywhere, too,
like "obvi" for obvious, "def" for definitely,
"inappro" for inappropriate and "totes" for
totally.
Even old slang seems to be back in style
— it's so dated, it's funny. Its revival is
spreading like wildfire. I swear that "oh,
snap." "sike" and "getting her digits" are
retro vogue.
There's also the dialect of instant mes
saging, which has been verbalized in all of its
gloried vowel-less acronym-o-plenty short
hand. I've heard friends say. glibly and oth
erwise. they are "jay-kaying," will "brb" or
are "lol."
Believe it or not, celebutante (a fashion
able celebrity), crunk (a blend of crazy
drunk), hoody (a hooded sweatshirt) and
yogilates (a combination of yoga and pi
lates) are all included in the most recent edi
tion of the Oxford English Dictionary. In the
world of multimedia and wireless internet.

terminology now disseminates with light
ning speed into everyday speech. We can
now use "crunk" in Scrabble, for God's sake.
Word, quite literally, travels fast.
More subtle, noncommercial linguistic
osmosis also comes from hanging around
friends with strong verbal mannerisms.
Their head bobs, hand motions and taglines
creep into your speech patterns until sud
denly someone says you have been sound
ing more and more like your neighbor.
Strangely-Inflected Steve.
Sometimes 1 even notice myself adjust
ing to my friends' most obvious verbal
habits. Whenever I am in a conversation
with Quick Talker, suddenly I. too, am trip
ping over my own tongue. I talk louder with
Loud Shouter,gesture more with Charades-
A-Lot and start adding accents and goofball
faces to conversations with Enthus-I-
Spasm.
It makes me sad to think that I am just a
boot-legged, plagiarizing conglomerate of
all the strongest traits from my verbally
dominant friends.
Am I really just a mimic? Some sad oral
Marceau (God rest) that only takes and
takes from the communal verbal pot? Every
joke is stolen and rehashed, every interest
ing oral emphasis pirated and then parroted
again and again? Do 1 have to rely on leach
ing other unique and funny things from
those around me. unable to be even vaguely
creative or funny on my own?
Perhaps we all quote films, music, and
each other because it defines the college cul
ture of our time and links us together as
teenagers and young twenty-somethings.
We feel united when we can quote from Zo
olander in unison. We find it funny, not our
parents, ergo de facto we are different from
our un-cool, "radical," "bitchin"' folks.
It is also just human to copy, reuse and
reincorporate. If we never took any ideas
from anyone else. 1 would be digging up tu
bers instead of You Tubing and gathering
acorns instead of buying an iPhone. Thank
