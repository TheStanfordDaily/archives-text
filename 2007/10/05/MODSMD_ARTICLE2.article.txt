# TOWERING TROY LOOMS
## Hobbled Cardinal set to face No. 2 USC 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With sophomore quarterbackTavita Pritchard
making his first start for Stanford (1-3,0-3 Pac-10)
on Saturday, it is impossible to imagine a more in
timidating opponent than No. 2 Southern Califor
nia (4-0,2-0 Pac-10). Thrust into action after T.C.
Ostrander suffered a seizure on Sunday, Pritchard
will take his first meaningful snaps against ar
guably the best program in college football.
Hie accomplishments of the Trojans under
head coach Pete Carroll are staggering: five
straight seasons of 11 wins or more, five straight
Pac-10 titles, two I leisman Trophies, two national
championships and four BCS bowl victories.
USC has taken the place held by Alabama in
the 19705, Miami in the 80s and Florida State in
the 90s â€” a perennial dream team, with a swag
ger that attracts top recruits like bear cubs to a
honey pot.
The Trojans enter Saturday's game with a 4-0
record, but a lackluster 27-24 win at Washington
has validated questions about USC's vulnerabili
ty. Southern Cal has lacked a big-play threat in the
mold of recent stars like Reggie Bush and
Dwayne Jarrett, and the tailback-by-committee
approach has failed to determine a consistent
starter. Injuries have dogged the deep USC ros
ter, particularly on the iine and at cornerback.
Two fifth-year seniors lead the Trojans' of
fense: quarterback John David Booty (89 for 135,
875 yards, 10 touchdowns, 4 interceptions) and
tailback Chauncey Washington (44 carries for 233
yards, four touchdowns). Tight end Fred Davis
and wide receiver Patrick Turner have combined
for 34 catches, 468 yards and three scores. Two
time All American tackle Sam Baker anchors the
offensive line.
Defensively, USC boasts an overwhelming
array of talent. Linebacking corps Brian Cushing,
Keith Rivers and Rey Maualuga may be the best
in the country. Safety Taylor Mays and defensive
linemen Lawrence Jackson and Sedrick Ellis are
among the most feared players in the nation.
Stanford comes into its first road game winless
in its last four Pac-10 contests. Last Saturday's 41-
3 loss to Arizona State, in which the team was kept
out of the end zone for the first time this season,
was a step back for the young squad. Although the
defense collected a season high six sacks, an array
of big plays and injuries doomed the Cardinal.
Pritchard will have to overcome his inexperi
ence if the Cardinal is to pull off what would be a
major upset. The third year sophomore is 1 for 3

for 10 yards in three appearances for his career.
Despite last week's blowout loss, head coach Jim
Harbaugh elected not to lift Ostrander against
Arizona State in order to give Pritchard experi
ence.
External factors are also at work against Stan
ford. Carroll's teams rarely play two bad games in
a row; USC followed up last year's loss at Oregon
State with a 42-0 blasting of Stanford.TheTrojans
fell to No. 2 in both polls after escaping from Seat
tle, surely a motivating factor for a team with na
tional title aspirations.
Then there are Cardinal coach Jim Har
baugh's offseason comments. In the spring, Har
baugh told Dennis Dodd of CBS that Carroll
would only be at USC for one more year before
returning to the NFL, citing second-hand sources
inside the program.
Carroll struck back, saying "If he's going to
make statements like that, he ought to get his in
formation right, and if he has any questions about
it he should call me."
When a Bay Area reporter asked Harbaugh if
he wanted to step away from his assertion, he de
clined. "We bow to no man. we bow to no program
at Stanford University," Harbaugh said.
While not having a reputation as a difficult fa

cility for visitors, the Los Angeles Memorial Coli
seum is a shrine of USC football, with seven huge
banners draped over seats commemorating the
school's Heisman Trophy winners. The 92,000
seats will be packed with cardinal and gold-clad
fans and the very loud Trojan Band. USC has not
lost a game at home since Stanford beat Carroll's
first team in November 2001.
In 2006, USC turned the new Stanford Stadi
um into a de facto home game, flooding the air
space with "Tribute to Troy" while the Trojans
cruised past the Cardinal.42-0.
Six USC players reached the end zone in the
romp, with Stanford committing three turnovers
to the Trojans' zero. Hie low point came late in the
3rd quarter, when Stanford lined up for a 33-yard
field goal to avoid the shutout. 302-pound defen
sive tackle Sedrick Kllis blocked the kick.andTer
rell Thomas returned it 71 yards for a touchdown
and a 35-0 lead.
Stanford's recent history with USC has not
been positive.The last Cardinal win came in 2001,
and the last competitive game was in 2004. That
year, a fake field goal and a first half-ending

NOTES: The Cardinal faces an uphill battle in
Los Angeles tomorrow, as Stanford takes on
perhaps the toughest opponent in the nation
Moreover, the Cardinal will be led by sopho
more quarterback Tavita Pritchard, who has
thrown just three passes in his collegiate ca
reer, after starter T.C. Ostrander suffered a
seizure at a local Palo Alto restourant on Sun
day. The Cardinal defense racked up a sea
son high six sacks against Arizona State, and
will need to apply plenty of pressure tomor
row to rattle fifth year senior Trojan quarter
back John David Booty.

Senior receiver Mark Bradford will be catching passes from a new quarterback Saturday night against
USC, as Tavita Pritchard takes over for T.C. Ostrander, who suffered a seizure on Sunday.
