## Ass-factor 
### 
Ass-factor: something so perceptible
and tangible that it could be quanti
fied on a numerical scale, hence the
'factor' part of it. ITiat chick you see on the
Precor every Thursday afternoon at Arrilla
ga? Ass-factor.That guy who sits 3 rows from
the front in IHIJM lecture? Ass-factor.The
working definition of ass-factor is "an
amount of sexual attraction." Ass-factor,
grammatically speaking, is a noun rather
than an adjective, so a person would have or
give off ass-factor as opposed to being ass
factor.
Now you may be thinking, "The grammar
lesson is nice but how does this apply to me?"
Where decisions involving interaction with
potential mating partners are concerned, my
reliable calculations show that ass-factor
pretty comfortably makes up around 20-35
percent of your decision and sometimes
completely dominates your thoughts. These
interactions aren't just your attempts to
hookup at a party. Ask yourself: what in
spired you to sit in that particular seat for lec
ture when there were other, more conven
ient seats available close to friends? Why did
you get up for that 9 a.m. class when you
stopped caring a long time ago?
Ass-factor is the key ingredient. We
weren't put on this Earth to become doctors;
our purpose is to procreate the human
species. Your biological role is to pass on
your particular set of genes, and that goes
hand in hand with chasing ass-factor.

So embrace it! Freud didn't blow all those
coke lines for nothing — he was trying to
make us more aware of our sexual desires.
Chasing ass-factor is more than just a duty;
it's a downright noble cause. Why else are 80
percent of songs about love? You should be
able to stand up on a table in Meyer during
finals and yell, "Hey, you know what? I'm
sick and tired of studying, and all I want to do
is get down and dirty with 20 of you fine
looking Stanford students right now!" And
you ought to receive thunderous applause
for it. If any of you are chasing ass-factor
under a guise right now, stop the justifica
tions and pat yourself on the back.
Good things come out of ass-factor, too:
community service, free drinks for girls and.
when the professor is good-looking, really
high lecture attendance. Do you go on a
study date unprepared? No way! You are
ready to impress for any question, academic
or otherwise. I myself have stayed in classes
where only the ass-factor kept me going. The
result? A+ grades in both. While studying
abroad in Australia. I had to choose to work

with one of two groups for a project worth 50
percent of my grade for a class: (1) a despon
dent, less-organized group with a smiling,
sexy and amazingly accented Aussie babe ra
diating ass-factor like a nuclear meltdown, or
(2) a diligent group of dudes. I chose the lat
ter ... and you know what happened? Two of
those dudes dropped out of the class and the
other two left me two hours to turn 13 pages
of garbage into an essay, while Aussie chick
was on top of her shit the whole way through.
Main point of the story — always go for ass
factor.
Sometimes, though, ass-factor can get the
best of you — it leads to heartbreak, it won't
hold a relationship together and overesti
mating the ass-factor can leave you coming
up short. And you might have to just plain
sacrifice it for competing interests, like ad
mission to the School of Engineering.
ITiese days. Stanford women are looking
mighty fine, and without a clear ass-factor
po'icy in place, the impending wave of Stan
ioid goddesses that appear at springtime can
be overwhelming. Plus, we are in college —
COLLEGE — where people have their
bodies looking right, the need to procreate
almost, not quite,but almost, trounces that of
getting a good GPA and everyone is at the
peak of their hotness.
So write the Provost, pressure the Regis
trar and ask to have ass-factor put on the cur-


Ziv
Shafir
riculum. Our school should become
a leader in this illustrious subject
and create "The Journal of Ass-Fac
tor," a publication that could rival
Playboy, if not in photography, then
at least with well-written academic
articles. And then maybe we'll have
a subject we won't mind cramming
for during midterms and finals.
