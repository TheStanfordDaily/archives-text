To the editor:
Yesterday's editorial about Burma
("Backup for Burma"] managed to he,at var
ious points, arrogant, ignorant, chauvinistic
and militarily aggressive — qualities that
have hardly endeared the U.S. to the rest of
the world during the past several years.
To begin with, you can add "vagueness"
and "inanity" to your list of offenses as well.
You write."lf a people want change and are
willing to risk their lives to produce it. then
shouldn't we help? The answer is that we
must help, and that we have may have to use
force" (your emphasis). By this logic, the U.S.
should threaten Israel with possible military
action until it withdraws from the occupied

Palestinian territories — for surely, the
Palestinians want change.
But this foreign policy formula, if it can be
called that, is really just meaningless. What
sort of change? And how many people? By
your prescription, we should aid not only the
Burmese opposition but the Tamil Tigers in
Sri Lanka and FARC in Colombia.
We have a golden opportunity to inter
vene in this matter, you argue.
"Whereas the international community
denounced American unilateralism preced
ing and during the Iraq war. it seems that the
entire Western world is united behind the
Burmese." This is a blatant sleight of hand.
The international community (and I very

much enjoy your slip from "international
community" to "entire Western world") was,
in fact, united in wanting to find a solution to
Saddam Hussein in 2(H)3; what it opposed
was American unilateral military action.
[Moreover,] you also fail to address the pos
sible unwanted ramifications of an invasion,
such as an escalation of killings by a desper
ate Burmese junta or involvement by China
leading to a confrontation between it and the
United States.
My heart goes out to those in Hurma
struggling for their freedom. No one could
fail to be mewed by the reports and images
that have been coming out of thai
country, usually in defiance of the
state-controlled media. Obviously
most world leaders share these sen
timents. I lowever. the\ have the re
sponsibility and matui it\ not to flip
pantly argue for ;i military invasion
even less one based on justification
and historical accounts that do nol
even pass the smell test.
