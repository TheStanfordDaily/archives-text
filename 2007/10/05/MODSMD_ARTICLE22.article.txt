## Cardinal upset at ITA Championships Stanford fails to win a match as underdogs rule the day 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
In a day of stunning upsets at the
Riviera/Intercollegiate Tennis Association
(ITA) All-American Championships, the
Stanford women's tennis team was the pri
mary victim, suffering three defeats in the
main draw and two in the consolation brack
ets. At the end of the day, the Cardinal did not
win a single match.
The first round of the main draw at Pacific
Palisades, Calif, saw upsets of five of the top
eight seeded players in the tourney, including
first seed Megan Falcon of LSU, who lost to
Vanderbilt's Amanda Taylor, 6-2,6-3.
Even more remarkable, perhaps, was the
fact that six of the eight qualifying players had
first round victories.
One of them came at the expense of Stan
ford; senior Celia Durkin lost to Maya Johans
son of Georgia Tech. Johansson, who made it
to the main draw out of the qualifying bracket,
led 6-4, 5-4 until Durkin, the eighth seed, re
tired from the match.
Johansson, ranked 56th in doubles, is un
ranked in the preseason singles polls.
A similar fate befell fellow Cardinal team
mate Jessica Nguyen, who dropped a 6-4. 6-3
decision to Arkansas's Aurelija Miseviciute in
a considerable upset, according to their pre
season ITA rankings — Nguyen was 16th,

while Miseviciute ranked 1 l l )th.
Completing the sweep of Stanford was
sixth seeded Zuzana Zemenova's defeat of
sophomore Lindsay Burdette. Burdette fell 6-
4. 6-4 to the Baylor star, leaving the Cardinal
winless for the day.
Zemenova, Fresno State's Melanie Gloria
and California's Suzi Babos were the only
seeded players to advance to the second
round.
With the trifecta of Cardinal losses, Stan
ford failed to advance any players to the sec
ond round for the first time this decade.
Last year, Theresa Logar '07 was the only
Cardinal woman to escape the opening round
of singles play. Logar then dropped a close de
cision to Megan Moulton-Levy of William and
Mary.The last Stanford player to reach the Ail-
American finals was Krin Burdette '05, older
sister to Lindsay.
In the consolation bracket, senior Whitney
Deason dropped a 4-6.6-0,6-4 decision to Ne
braska's Imke Reimers, while the team of Bur
dette and Nguyen fell 9-8(7) to Noelle Hickey
and Christy Striplin of Georgia Tech.
Durkin, Nguyen and Burdette begin play
today in the consolation bracket of the main
draw, where they hope to regain their form.
With three remaining tournaments in their fall
season, the Stanford women have yet to answer
many lingering questions about their depth.
After concluding play at the Ail-American,
the Cardinal will head back to the Farm to host
the ITA Northwest Regional Championships.
Oct 19-22.

Misviciute of Arkansas. It was one of many disappointments for the Cardinal on the tournament's first day, as Stanford failed to win a match.
