played a tough match against Denes I.ukacs of Baylor,also
a qualifier. But Clayton prevailed in three sets,s-7,6-4,6-4,
making him one of only four qualifiers left in the tourna
ment.

gles play. Bruch, who is ranked No. 36 in the nation in the
ITA preseason poll,dropped a tough contest to Treat Huey
of Virginia, the No. 12 player in the nation. Playing in his
first match of the season, Bruch competed well in the first
set and took Huey to a tiebreaker, but in the end did not
prevail and lost the match 7-6(4).6-3.

et, where he played much better and swept through Juan
Rebaza of Arizona State 6-0,6-3.1 le plays Ricardo Soriano

tion bracket.
