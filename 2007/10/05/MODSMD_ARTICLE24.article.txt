# Stanford soccer squads kick into high gear
## Men set to open conference play against OSU, UW 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
As Pac-10 play picks up. the Stanford
men's soccer squad is eying both the confer
ence title and a berth in the NCAA College
Cup. I"he Cardinal will face its first test this
weekend in a pair of key home conference
matches.
Stanford (3-2-3) first battles Oregon
State on Friday at 5 p.m. The Beavers (3-5-0)
arrive at Stanford having just ended a three
game losing streak with a 1-0 win over Loy
ola (Md). Oregon State is led offensively by

senior Nick Webb, with a team-high two
goals this season. Meanwhile, the Beavers
entrust their net to junior goalie Packy
Deeniha, who has posted two shutouts on
the season.
Last year, the Cardinal won both games
2-0. and the team is optimistic about this
year's match-up, especially due to the week
long break it has enjoyed since the 0-0 tie
with College of Charleston on Sept. 28.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro hopes that
the chance to recuperate will help Stanford
remain focused and energized during its up
coming matches.
"We have |had] plenty of time to rest for
the beginning of the Pac-10 season," Shapiro
said. "We need to win some games in the
Pac-10. but that should come naturally if we
play with the same intensity and
composure that we've shown over
the last few games."

to deviate from his usual training

"Our preparation for this week's
games hasn't been different than for
other opponents," Simon said. "The

ME NOTES: The Cardinal opens its Pacific
-10 Conference schedule with a match
against the Beavers, who just snapped a
three game losing streak with a victory over
Loyola (Md.). Stanford defeated Oregon
State twice last season, winning both game
2-0. Sunday, the Cardinal continues its con
ference schedule, hosting Washington,
which boasts a defense that has shut-out its
opponents five times this season.

certainty regarding the opposition."
I"his certainty will be especially
important during the Card's meeting
with Washington at 1 p.m. on Sun
day. The Huskies (5-3-1) spent much
of the season among the ranks of the
nation's Top 25 teams before drop
ping out this week after an overtime
loss at No. 13 Creighton on Saturday.
With a strong attack led by Kevin
Forrest's six goals, Washington sits
atop the Pac-10 in goals and goals
per game, with 13 goals in their first
nine contests. Not to be overlooked
is the Huskies' defense, which has
recorded a conference-leading five
shutouts in those matches.
Simon, though, noted Stanford's
ability to shut down a similarly dom
inant forward in Charleston's Ka
reem Yearwood.
"I was particularly pleased that
we were able to limit the number of
opportunities that Yearwood was
able to get," Simon commented.
"I le's a great talent, and it took real
attention to defensive detail by the
entire defensive unit. ITiat's a very
important building block as we go
forward [against Forrest and other
opponents]."
However, coach and team alike
feel that the most important thing
for this weekend and the remainder
of the season is to focus on Stan
ford's own strengths.
"At the end of the day the best
way to prepare is to have your game
in order," Simon said. "1 think we
have played quite well over the first
half of the season. We have played
confidently, and 1 think we are in a
good place to accelerate forward
during the Pac-10 conference play."
