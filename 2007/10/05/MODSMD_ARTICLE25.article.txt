game of the year.
The Cardinal (9-1-0) retook the top spot
in the National Soccer Coaches Association
of America (NSCAA) poll from the Bron
cos (7-1-1) this past weekend. Stanford was
the only team in the top four to win both of
its games last week. Santa Clara lost 2-0 to

California on Sunday.
Stanford heads into the match with a full
complement of forwards â€” a luxury that
the team has not had thus far in the 2(K)7 sea
son. Sophomores Kelley O'Hara and Ali
Riley will both he available for the Cardinal
after missing some time this year. Last week
end. O'Hara made her first appearance for
Stanford since sustaining a shoulder injury
against Missouri in mid-September, while
Riley made her first start since returning
from Women's World Cup duty with the
New Zealand national team.
The Cardinal swept two other Bay Area
rivals, the University of San Francisco and
St. Mary's, in convincing fashion last week.
Redshirt senior Shari Summers scored two
goals to lead the team to a 3-1 victory over
USE On Sunday, it was freshman
Christen Press's turn to score a pair
as Stanford cruised to a 4-1 win ver
sus St. Mary's.
Summers is tied with freshman
forward Morgan Redman atop the
Stanford scoring charts with ten
points from her five goals. Redman
has four goals and two assists.
The Santa Clara attack is led by
sophomore Kiki Bosio. who also has
ten points. She has three goals and

four assists. Two Broncos players,
Tina Estrada and Brittany Klein,
have both tallied four goals in the
season. Goalkeeper Megan McCray
has three shutouts in eight games for
Santa Clara.
Stanford will probably answer in
goal with freshman Kira Maker, who
has been standing in for senior Erica
Holland the past few weeks. Maker
has done well in her first taste of col
legiate action, making 12 saves and
allowing only three goals in five
games, all of them starts.
Maker has not allowed more than
one goal in any game she has played
in a Stanford uniform.
After today's heavyweight clash
the Cardinal will move forward into
the Pacific-10 Conference schedule.

in the Pac-10 this season, along with
No. 2 UCLA. No. 13 USC.and No. 18
