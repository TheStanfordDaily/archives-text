neighbors and environmentalists on the grounds that

through the stadium) and would also involve cutting
down a grove of oak trees.
A number of protesters have been pt rched in the
trees since last December in protest.
UC Police Asst. Chief Mitch Celaya said police are
talking to an "individual of interest" who was angry
after being arrested earlier in connection with the tree
protest and reportedly had threatened revenge.

day against the person, who voluntarily went to the po
lice station after getting a call from officers, Celaya
said.
A judge on Monday ordered tree-sitters to come
down from the trees, acting on a suit tiled by campus
officials. 1 lowever. there are still a number of people
on their perches.
Meanwhile, a hearing is ongoing into three lawsuits
seeking to block the athletic center project.
