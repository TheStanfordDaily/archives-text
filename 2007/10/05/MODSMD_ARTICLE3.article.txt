### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team kept quite a few streaks going with
last night's sweep of Oregon State. The
Cardinal has now won four straight Pac-10
matches, 15 consecutive matches overall in
2007 and 45 against the Beavers, who have
never beaten Stanford.
Behind the error-free hitting of junior
Cynthia Barboza and solid blocking across
the board, the Cardinal improved to 15-0,
4-0 Pac-10, with its 30-21,30-20.30-25 vic
tory over the Beavers (8-9.1-4).
Barboza had 17 kills on 35 swings to
lead the Cardinal, while junior middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo had 15 and
hit over .500. Oregon State's Rachel
Rourke was the top hitter on the court,
with 20 kills.
Stanford got out of the gates quickly,
with a four-point run including a pair of
kills by Akinradewo. The Beavers contin
ued to fall farther behind and the Cardinal
built a double-digit lead at 20-10. From
there, the team's traded runs until Akin
radewo sealed the win with her third kill of
the game and the I.oooth of her career.
It was Oregon State jumping out to the
early lead in the second, but the Cardinal
quickly closed the gap. After trading leads,
Stanford went ahead for good at 8-7 on an
ace by freshman libero Gabi Ailes. Oregon
State pulled within one. but Stanford so
lidified its lead with another Ailes service
run. Freshman outside hitter Alix Kline
man and sophomore Janet Okogbaa
ended the game with a block of a Rourke
attack.
Stanford wasted no time pulling ahead
in the third game, going up 6-2 on the
strength of four Akinradewo kills. Oregon
State played their best game of the match
but could not come within three down the
stretch. Akinradewo and junior right side
Erin Waller ended the match with a block.
