PREPARING FOR A CAREER FAIR
Career fairs are usually one day events set
up to connect large numbers of employers
with job fair participants. Employers are there
to recruit employees, so if you are interested
in looking for a job or finding out more
about a potential career, don't miss out.
Career fairs are typically sponsored by uni
versities, professional associations, local
employment agencies, or by a career fair
promoter.
Career fairs are usually free to those seeking
employment. These fairs are held at local
universities, hotels, and conference centers.
To find out about upcoming events check
your campus career center, the radio sta
tions, and newspapers. The National
Business Employment Weekly's event calen
dar lists many such events. Some fairs are
targeted for entry-level, technical, education,
or other specified groups and may be adver
tised through your campus clubs and organi
zations.
What can I expect? You can expect any
where from 25 to 350 employers represent
ed at different booths or tables. Employer
representatives are anxious to give away their

organization brochures and other promo
tional materials (key chains, pens, notepads,
etc.) they have brought with them. Their job
is to meet as many attendees as possible
and promote their organizations to YOU. It is
likely that the table you want to approach
will be crowded - be patient and observe.
You can also expect a carnival type atmos
phere with lots of background noise with
which you will have to compete. Sometimes
fair organizers will offer formal group presen
tations simultaneous to the job fair. This is a
great way to learn more about a specific
topic and also have a chance to introduce
yourself to an employer/presenter and get
some individual attention.
BENEFITS OF A CAREER FAIR.
Consider a job fair to be one-stop shopping.
What a luxury to have the opportunity to talk
to numerous employers at one time and
place. Some direct benefits of attending a
career fair include:
• An efficient and economical way to
make contacts
• Learning more about specific indus
tries, careers, and organizations
• Actually talking to a company repre
sentative instead of just mailing in or
submitting an on-line resume
• Asking someone in the field for feed
back about your resume, education, or
experiences
• Making a contact within the organiza
tion
Of course, if a career fair is such a good
deal then there may be hundreds to thou
sands of other people just like you trying to
talk to employers. This is why it is so impor
tant to BE PREPARED to get the most out of
attending a career fair.
Some fairs allow time for employers to
schedule interviews on-site, but many use the
time to screen applicants or collect resumes
to bring back to their organization. It is ideal
to be able to engage the recruiter in a con
versation so that they will remember you and
your skills. Do not be discouraged if this
does not happen; there can be numerous
people to compete with in this setting. Use
your time to collect valuable company infor
mation via conversation and distributed
materials so that you can write an incredibly
well informed cover letter stating your interest
in an organization.
The career fair can be separated into three
stages: 1) Before 2) During 3) After
1) BEFORE: THE PREPARATION STAGE
Do your homework. Contact the organization
sponsoring the event and find out some of the
following details.
• Is there an admission fee?
• How many organizations will be repre
sented?
• Is there a published list available ahead
of time or on the day of the event?
• How will the employers be organized?
Alphabetical order, by industry, etc.?
• What is the starting and ending time of
the event?
• What is the appropriate dress?

• Are there any special procedures to fol
low to participate? (i.e. submit resume
ahead of time)
Put together your resume. You may have a
dichotomy of interests and in that case it may
be ideal to have different versions of your
resume. Be realistic in your preparation time
and remember that it is most important to
have a well-polished resume that shows off
your education, skills, and experiences. Be
sure to have your resume critiqued by at least
three people. It is better to attend without a
resume than to NOT attend the job fair at all.
You can always pick up pertinent information
about an organization to use in a follow up
letter of inquiry or application.
Have a plan. It is very easy to feel intimidated
at such an event. Wandering around aimlessly
will only enhance this feeling. Have a plan -
even if your only plan is ro explore. This will
help you to have some idea as to which orga
nizations you want to approach. An example
of a plan may be geographic, industry based,
or by the majors requested. Many organiza
tions will publicize the types of majors or job
titles they are seeking. Be open-minded and
flexible; you might be surprised at what you
find.
Bring a pen, folder, note pad and/or some
sort of log sheet to keep you organized. A
highlighter can be useful to help indicate
which organizations you want to target on
your employer list. (If you forgot yours, don't
worry, you can always find an employer giving
one away)
Bring your pertinent questions. Your questions
will depend on your goals (career exploration
vs. job search). Sample questions may
include:
• What qualities and background are
you looking for in employees?
• I am currently a freshman so I have I
some time to plan ahead, what courses
would you recommend someone take
before being hired as a ?
• What is the application process for your
organization?
• Do you have a business card I can
have for future reference and contact?
2) DURING: THE ACTUAL EVENT
Hand out your resume. Have plenty of copies
of your polished resume easily accessible (if
you choose to distribute your resume). You
don't want to have to put down all the "free
bies" you collected to hand someone your
resume. If you have two versions of your
resumes, color-coding them can be very help
ful. Gray, white and off-white are all good
choices. A new trend is for employers not to
collect resumes on site but to just refer you
back to their web-site for on-line resume sub
mission. Try and use the face time at the fair
to gather pertinent information to enhance
your application.
Thank employers for any brochures or promo
tional materials you are given. This is not a
time to pick up stocking stuffers or birthday
gifts for your family. Be reasonable with your
consumption of recruiter giveaways.
Collect business cards and jot down a fact on
the back to jog your memory when you write

a follow-up letter.
Approach an employer representative and
introduce yourself Don't sit back and wait to
be approached. Shake hands, make good
eye contact, and tell the employer your name,
major, and interests. The more focused you
are the better. If you are unsure how you
would fit into the organization, ask the
employer open-ended yet specific questions.
What qualities do you look for in employees?
What kind of summer internships are avail
able?
Create a one-minute commercial as a way to
sell yourself to an employer. This is a great
way to introduce yourself. The goal is to con
nect your background to the organization's
need. In one minute or less you need to intro
duce yourself, demonstrate your knowledge of
the company, express enthusiasm and interest,
and relate your background to the organiza
tion's need, and end with a question. This is
meant to be a dialogue NOT a monologue.
Other dos and don'ts:
• Be assertive without being rude
• Be sensitive to others waiting behind
you
• Realize that recruiters like to talk to
groups
• Maximize your time at the career fair
• Observe other students/employers for
clues
• Don't ask about salary and benefits
• Don't monopolize someone's time
• Don't ask, "What do you have for my
major?"
• Don't exhibit a lack of direction and
focus
3. AFTER: THE FOLLOW-UP
You are only as good as your follow-up!
Keep track of those organizations and repre
sentatives with whom you spoke.
Send a thank you letter to those representa
tives you wish to pursue. This will set the
stage for future correspondence.
Dress appropriate! Professional is best unless
it's a more casual event.

phere with lots of background noise with
which you will have to compete. Sometimes
fair organizers will offer formal group presen
tations simultaneous to the job fair. This is a
great way to learn more about a specific
topic and also have a chance to introduce
yourself to an employer/presenter and get
some individual attention.
BENEFITS OF A CAREER FAIR.
Consider a job fair to be one-stop shopping.
What a luxury to have the opportunity to talk
to numerous employers at one time and
place. Some direct benefits of attending a
career fair include:
• An efficient and economical way to
make contacts
• Learning more about specific indus
tries, careers, and organizations
• Actually talking to a company repre
sentative instead of just mailing in or
submitting an on-line resume
• Asking someone in the field for feed
back about your resume, education, or
experiences
• Making a contact within the organiza
tion
Of course, if a career fair is such a good
deal then there may be hundreds to thou
sands of other people just like you trying to
talk to employers. This is why it is so impor
tant to BE PREPARED to get the most out of
attending a career fair.
Some fairs allow time for employers to
schedule interviews on-site, but many use the
time to screen applicants or collect resumes
to bring back to their organization. It is ideal
to be able to engage the recruiter in a con
versation so that they will remember you and
your skills. Do not be discouraged if this
does not happen; there can be numerous
people to compete with in this setting. Use
your time to collect valuable company infor
mation via conversation and distributed
materials so that you can write an incredibly
well informed cover letter stating your interest
in an organization.
The career fair can be separated into three
stages: 1) Before 2) During 3) After
1) BEFORE: THE PREPARATION STAGE
Do your homework. Contact the organization
sponsoring the event and find out some of the
following details.
• Is there an admission fee?
• How many organizations will be repre
sented?
• Is there a published list available ahead
of time or on the day of the event?
• How will the employers be organized?
Alphabetical order, by industry, etc.?
• What is the starting and ending time of
the event?
• What is the appropriate dress?

• Are there any special procedures to fol
low to participate? (i.e. submit resume
ahead of time)
Put together your resume. You may have a
dichotomy of interests and in that case it may
be ideal to have different versions of your
resume. Be realistic in your preparation time
and remember that it is most important to
have a well-polished resume that shows off
your education, skills, and experiences. Be
sure to have your resume critiqued by at least
three people. It is better to attend without a
resume than to NOT attend the job fair at all.
You can always pick up pertinent information
about an organization to use in a follow up
letter of inquiry or application.
Have a plan. It is very easy to feel intimidated
at such an event. Wandering around aimlessly
will only enhance this feeling. Have a plan -
even if your only plan is ro explore. This will
help you to have some idea as to which orga
nizations you want to approach. An example
of a plan may be geographic, industry based,
or by the majors requested. Many organiza
tions will publicize the types of majors or job
titles they are seeking. Be open-minded and
flexible; you might be surprised at what you
find.
Bring a pen, folder, note pad and/or some
sort of log sheet to keep you organized. A
highlighter can be useful to help indicate
which organizations you want to target on
your employer list. (If you forgot yours, don't
worry, you can always find an employer giving
one away)
Bring your pertinent questions. Your questions
will depend on your goals (career exploration
vs. job search). Sample questions may
include:
• What qualities and background are
you looking for in employees?
• I am currently a freshman so I have I
some time to plan ahead, what courses
would you recommend someone take
before being hired as a ?
• What is the application process for your
organization?
• Do you have a business card I can
have for future reference and contact?
2) DURING: THE ACTUAL EVENT
Hand out your resume. Have plenty of copies
of your polished resume easily accessible (if
you choose to distribute your resume). You
don't want to have to put down all the "free
bies" you collected to hand someone your
resume. If you have two versions of your
resumes, color-coding them can be very help
ful. Gray, white and off-white are all good
choices. A new trend is for employers not to
collect resumes on site but to just refer you
back to their web-site for on-line resume sub
mission. Try and use the face time at the fair
to gather pertinent information to enhance
your application.
Thank employers for any brochures or promo
tional materials you are given. This is not a
time to pick up stocking stuffers or birthday
gifts for your family. Be reasonable with your
consumption of recruiter giveaways.
Collect business cards and jot down a fact on
the back to jog your memory when you write

a follow-up letter.
Approach an employer representative and
introduce yourself Don't sit back and wait to
be approached. Shake hands, make good
eye contact, and tell the employer your name,
major, and interests. The more focused you
are the better. If you are unsure how you
would fit into the organization, ask the
employer open-ended yet specific questions.
What qualities do you look for in employees?
What kind of summer internships are avail
able?
Create a one-minute commercial as a way to
sell yourself to an employer. This is a great
way to introduce yourself. The goal is to con
nect your background to the organization's
need. In one minute or less you need to intro
duce yourself, demonstrate your knowledge of
the company, express enthusiasm and interest,
and relate your background to the organiza
tion's need, and end with a question. This is
meant to be a dialogue NOT a monologue.
Other dos and don'ts:
• Be assertive without being rude
• Be sensitive to others waiting behind
you
• Realize that recruiters like to talk to
groups
• Maximize your time at the career fair
• Observe other students/employers for
clues
• Don't ask about salary and benefits
• Don't monopolize someone's time
• Don't ask, "What do you have for my
major?"
• Don't exhibit a lack of direction and
focus
3. AFTER: THE FOLLOW-UP
You are only as good as your follow-up!
Keep track of those organizations and repre
sentatives with whom you spoke.
Send a thank you letter to those representa
tives you wish to pursue. This will set the
stage for future correspondence.
Dress appropriate! Professional is best unless
it's a more casual event.

PREPARING FOR A CAREER FAIR
Career fairs are usually one day events set
up to connect large numbers of employers
with job fair participants. Employers are there
to recruit employees, so if you are interested
in looking for a job or finding out more
about a potential career, don't miss out.
Career fairs are typically sponsored by uni
versities, professional associations, local
employment agencies, or by a career fair
promoter.
Career fairs are usually free to those seeking
employment. These fairs are held at local
universities, hotels, and conference centers.
To find out about upcoming events check
your campus career center, the radio sta
tions, and newspapers. The National
Business Employment Weekly's event calen
dar lists many such events. Some fairs are
targeted for entry-level, technical, education,
or other specified groups and may be adver
tised through your campus clubs and organi
zations.
What can I expect? You can expect any
where from 25 to 350 employers represent
ed at different booths or tables. Employer
representatives are anxious to give away their

organization brochures and other promo
tional materials (key chains, pens, notepads,
etc.) they have brought with them. Their job
is to meet as many attendees as possible
and promote their organizations to YOU. It is
likely that the table you want to approach
will be crowded - be patient and observe.
You can also expect a carnival type atmos
phere with lots of background noise with
which you will have to compete. Sometimes
fair organizers will offer formal group presen
tations simultaneous to the job fair. This is a
great way to learn more about a specific
topic and also have a chance to introduce
yourself to an employer/presenter and get
some individual attention.

• Actually talking to a company repre

3. AFTER: THE FOLLOW-UP
You are only as good as your follow-up!
Keep track of those organizations and repre
sentatives with whom you spoke.
Send a thank you letter to those representa
tives you wish to pursue. This will set the
stage for future correspondence.
Dress appropriate! Professional is best unless
it's a more casual event.

PREPARING FOR A CAREER FAIR
Career fairs are usually one day events set
up to connect large numbers of employers
with job fair participants. Employers are there
to recruit employees, so if you are interested
in looking for a job or finding out more
about a potential career, don't miss out.
Career fairs are typically sponsored by uni
versities, professional associations, local
employment agencies, or by a career fair
promoter.
Career fairs are usually free to those seeking
employment. These fairs are held at local
universities, hotels, and conference centers.
To find out about upcoming events check
your campus career center, the radio sta
tions, and newspapers. The National
Business Employment Weekly's event calen
dar lists many such events. Some fairs are
targeted for entry-level, technical, education,
or other specified groups and may be adver
tised through your campus clubs and organi
zations.
What can I expect? You can expect any
where from 25 to 350 employers represent
ed at different booths or tables. Employer
representatives are anxious to give away their

organization brochures and other promo
tional materials (key chains, pens, notepads,
etc.) they have brought with them. Their job
is to meet as many attendees as possible
and promote their organizations to YOU. It is
likely that the table you want to approach
will be crowded - be patient and observe.
You can also expect a carnival type atmos
phere with lots of background noise with
which you will have to compete. Sometimes
fair organizers will offer formal group presen
tations simultaneous to the job fair. This is a
great way to learn more about a specific
topic and also have a chance to introduce
yourself to an employer/presenter and get
some individual attention.
BENEFITS OF A CAREER FAIR.
Consider a job fair to be one-stop shopping.
What a luxury to have the opportunity to talk
to numerous employers at one time and
place. Some direct benefits of attending a
career fair include:
• An efficient and economical way to
make contacts
• Learning more about specific indus
tries, careers, and organizations
• Actually talking to a company repre
sentative instead of just mailing in or
submitting an on-line resume
• Asking someone in the field for feed
back about your resume, education, or
experiences
• Making a contact within the organiza
tion
Of course, if a career fair is such a good
deal then there may be hundreds to thou
sands of other people just like you trying to
talk to employers. This is why it is so impor
tant to BE PREPARED to get the most out of
attending a career fair.
Some fairs allow time for employers to
schedule interviews on-site, but many use the
time to screen applicants or collect resumes
to bring back to their organization. It is ideal
to be able to engage the recruiter in a con
versation so that they will remember you and
your skills. Do not be discouraged if this
does not happen; there can be numerous
people to compete with in this setting. Use
your time to collect valuable company infor
mation via conversation and distributed
materials so that you can write an incredibly
well informed cover letter stating your interest
in an organization.
The career fair can be separated into three
stages: 1) Before 2) During 3) After
1) BEFORE: THE PREPARATION STAGE
Do your homework. Contact the organization
sponsoring the event and find out some of the
following details.
• Is there an admission fee?
• How many organizations will be repre
sented?
• Is there a published list available ahead
of time or on the day of the event?
• How will the employers be organized?
Alphabetical order, by industry, etc.?
• What is the starting and ending time of
the event?
• What is the appropriate dress?

• Are there any special procedures to fol
low to participate? (i.e. submit resume
ahead of time)
Put together your resume. You may have a
dichotomy of interests and in that case it may
be ideal to have different versions of your
resume. Be realistic in your preparation time
and remember that it is most important to
have a well-polished resume that shows off
your education, skills, and experiences. Be
sure to have your resume critiqued by at least
three people. It is better to attend without a
resume than to NOT attend the job fair at all.
You can always pick up pertinent information
about an organization to use in a follow up
letter of inquiry or application.
Have a plan. It is very easy to feel intimidated
at such an event. Wandering around aimlessly
will only enhance this feeling. Have a plan -
even if your only plan is ro explore. This will
help you to have some idea as to which orga
nizations you want to approach. An example
of a plan may be geographic, industry based,
or by the majors requested. Many organiza
tions will publicize the types of majors or job
titles they are seeking. Be open-minded and
flexible; you might be surprised at what you
find.
Bring a pen, folder, note pad and/or some
sort of log sheet to keep you organized. A
highlighter can be useful to help indicate
which organizations you want to target on
your employer list. (If you forgot yours, don't
worry, you can always find an employer giving
one away)
Bring your pertinent questions. Your questions
will depend on your goals (career exploration
vs. job search). Sample questions may
include:
• What qualities and background are
you looking for in employees?
• I am currently a freshman so I have I
some time to plan ahead, what courses
would you recommend someone take
before being hired as a ?
• What is the application process for your
organization?
• Do you have a business card I can
have for future reference and contact?
2) DURING: THE ACTUAL EVENT
Hand out your resume. Have plenty of copies
of your polished resume easily accessible (if
you choose to distribute your resume). You
don't want to have to put down all the "free
bies" you collected to hand someone your
resume. If you have two versions of your
resumes, color-coding them can be very help
ful. Gray, white and off-white are all good
choices. A new trend is for employers not to
collect resumes on site but to just refer you
back to their web-site for on-line resume sub
mission. Try and use the face time at the fair
to gather pertinent information to enhance
your application.
Thank employers for any brochures or promo
tional materials you are given. This is not a
time to pick up stocking stuffers or birthday
gifts for your family. Be reasonable with your
consumption of recruiter giveaways.
Collect business cards and jot down a fact on
the back to jog your memory when you write

a follow-up letter.
Approach an employer representative and
introduce yourself Don't sit back and wait to
be approached. Shake hands, make good
eye contact, and tell the employer your name,
major, and interests. The more focused you
are the better. If you are unsure how you
would fit into the organization, ask the
employer open-ended yet specific questions.
What qualities do you look for in employees?
What kind of summer internships are avail
able?
Create a one-minute commercial as a way to
sell yourself to an employer. This is a great
way to introduce yourself. The goal is to con
nect your background to the organization's
need. In one minute or less you need to intro
duce yourself, demonstrate your knowledge of
the company, express enthusiasm and interest,
and relate your background to the organiza
tion's need, and end with a question. This is
meant to be a dialogue NOT a monologue.
Other dos and don'ts:
• Be assertive without being rude
• Be sensitive to others waiting behind
you
• Realize that recruiters like to talk to
groups
• Maximize your time at the career fair
• Observe other students/employers for
clues
• Don't ask about salary and benefits
• Don't monopolize someone's time
• Don't ask, "What do you have for my
major?"
• Don't exhibit a lack of direction and
focus
3. AFTER: THE FOLLOW-UP
You are only as good as your follow-up!
Keep track of those organizations and repre
sentatives with whom you spoke.
Send a thank you letter to those representa
tives you wish to pursue. This will set the
stage for future correspondence.
Dress appropriate! Professional is best unless
it's a more casual event.
This is the first issue in our series of quarterly Jumpstart Career Guides, a joint effort between the Stanford Daily, the CDC,
contributing magazines, and Stanford alumni Our intent in publishing Jumpstart is to pool together the vast resources
available at this University and deliver career guidance advice and cool news stories pertaining to select industries. This
issue we have chosen to focus on the Finance & Business. Biotech, and Environmental sectors We hope this will be a valuable
resource for many of you among the Stanford student body as you seek to learn about the vast array of career opportunities before
you and plan for the road ahead.
Sincerely,
The Stanford Daily

sell yourself to an employer. This is a great
way to introduce yourself. The goal is to con
nect your background to the organization's
need. In one minute or less you need to intro
duce yourself, demonstrate your knowledge of
the company, express enthusiasm and interest,
and relate your background to the organiza
tion's need, and end with a question. This is
meant to be a dialogue NOT a monologue.
Other dos and don'ts:
• Be assertive without being rude
• Be sensitive to others waiting behind
you
• Realize that recruiters like to talk to
groups
• Maximize your time at the career fair
• Observe other students/employers for
clues
• Don't ask about salary and benefits
• Don't monopolize someone's time
• Don't ask, "What do you have for my
major?"
• Don't exhibit a lack of direction and
focus

PREPARING FOR A CAREER FAIR
Career fairs are usually one day events set
up to connect large numbers of employers
with job fair participants. Employers are there
to recruit employees, so if you are interested
in looking for a job or finding out more
about a potential career, don't miss out.
Career fairs are typically sponsored by uni
versities, professional associations, local
employment agencies, or by a career fair
promoter.
Career fairs are usually free to those seeking
employment. These fairs are held at local
universities, hotels, and conference centers.
To find out about upcoming events check
your campus career center, the radio sta
tions, and newspapers. The National
Business Employment Weekly's event calen
dar lists many such events. Some fairs are
targeted for entry-level, technical, education,
or other specified groups and may be adver
tised through your campus clubs and organi
zations.
What can I expect? You can expect any
where from 25 to 350 employers represent
ed at different booths or tables. Employer
representatives are anxious to give away their

organization brochures and other promo
tional materials (key chains, pens, notepads,
etc.) they have brought with them. Their job
is to meet as many attendees as possible
and promote their organizations to YOU. It is
likely that the table you want to approach
will be crowded - be patient and observe.
You can also expect a carnival type atmos
phere with lots of background noise with
which you will have to compete. Sometimes
fair organizers will offer formal group presen
tations simultaneous to the job fair. This is a
great way to learn more about a specific
topic and also have a chance to introduce
yourself to an employer/presenter and get
some individual attention.
BENEFITS OF A CAREER FAIR.
Consider a job fair to be one-stop shopping.
What a luxury to have the opportunity to talk
to numerous employers at one time and
place. Some direct benefits of attending a
career fair include:
• An efficient and economical way to
make contacts
• Learning more about specific indus
tries, careers, and organizations
• Actually talking to a company repre
sentative instead of just mailing in or
submitting an on-line resume
• Asking someone in the field for feed
back about your resume, education, or
experiences
• Making a contact within the organiza
tion
Of course, if a career fair is such a good
deal then there may be hundreds to thou
sands of other people just like you trying to
talk to employers. This is why it is so impor
tant to BE PREPARED to get the most out of
attending a career fair.
Some fairs allow time for employers to
schedule interviews on-site, but many use the
time to screen applicants or collect resumes
to bring back to their organization. It is ideal
to be able to engage the recruiter in a con
versation so that they will remember you and
your skills. Do not be discouraged if this
does not happen; there can be numerous
people to compete with in this setting. Use
your time to collect valuable company infor
mation via conversation and distributed
materials so that you can write an incredibly
well informed cover letter stating your interest
in an organization.
The career fair can be separated into three
stages: 1) Before 2) During 3) After
1) BEFORE: THE PREPARATION STAGE
Do your homework. Contact the organization
sponsoring the event and find out some of the
following details.
• Is there an admission fee?
• How many organizations will be repre
sented?
• Is there a published list available ahead
of time or on the day of the event?
• How will the employers be organized?
Alphabetical order, by industry, etc.?
• What is the starting and ending time of
the event?
• What is the appropriate dress?

• Are there any special procedures to fol
low to participate? (i.e. submit resume
ahead of time)
Put together your resume. You may have a
dichotomy of interests and in that case it may
be ideal to have different versions of your
resume. Be realistic in your preparation time
and remember that it is most important to
have a well-polished resume that shows off
your education, skills, and experiences. Be
sure to have your resume critiqued by at least
three people. It is better to attend without a
resume than to NOT attend the job fair at all.
You can always pick up pertinent information
about an organization to use in a follow up
letter of inquiry or application.
Have a plan. It is very easy to feel intimidated
at such an event. Wandering around aimlessly
will only enhance this feeling. Have a plan -
even if your only plan is ro explore. This will
help you to have some idea as to which orga
nizations you want to approach. An example
of a plan may be geographic, industry based,
or by the majors requested. Many organiza
tions will publicize the types of majors or job
titles they are seeking. Be open-minded and
flexible; you might be surprised at what you
find.
Bring a pen, folder, note pad and/or some
sort of log sheet to keep you organized. A
highlighter can be useful to help indicate
which organizations you want to target on
your employer list. (If you forgot yours, don't
worry, you can always find an employer giving
one away)
Bring your pertinent questions. Your questions
will depend on your goals (career exploration
vs. job search). Sample questions may
include:
• What qualities and background are
you looking for in employees?
• I am currently a freshman so I have I
some time to plan ahead, what courses
would you recommend someone take
before being hired as a ?
• What is the application process for your
organization?
• Do you have a business card I can
have for future reference and contact?
2) DURING: THE ACTUAL EVENT
Hand out your resume. Have plenty of copies
of your polished resume easily accessible (if
you choose to distribute your resume). You
don't want to have to put down all the "free
bies" you collected to hand someone your
resume. If you have two versions of your
resumes, color-coding them can be very help
ful. Gray, white and off-white are all good
choices. A new trend is for employers not to
collect resumes on site but to just refer you
back to their web-site for on-line resume sub
mission. Try and use the face time at the fair
to gather pertinent information to enhance
your application.
Thank employers for any brochures or promo
tional materials you are given. This is not a
time to pick up stocking stuffers or birthday
gifts for your family. Be reasonable with your
consumption of recruiter giveaways.
Collect business cards and jot down a fact on
the back to jog your memory when you write

a follow-up letter.
Approach an employer representative and
introduce yourself Don't sit back and wait to
be approached. Shake hands, make good
eye contact, and tell the employer your name,
major, and interests. The more focused you
are the better. If you are unsure how you
would fit into the organization, ask the
employer open-ended yet specific questions.
What qualities do you look for in employees?
What kind of summer internships are avail
able?
Create a one-minute commercial as a way to
sell yourself to an employer. This is a great
way to introduce yourself. The goal is to con
nect your background to the organization's
need. In one minute or less you need to intro
duce yourself, demonstrate your knowledge of
the company, express enthusiasm and interest,
and relate your background to the organiza
tion's need, and end with a question. This is
meant to be a dialogue NOT a monologue.
Other dos and don'ts:
• Be assertive without being rude
• Be sensitive to others waiting behind
you
• Realize that recruiters like to talk to
groups
• Maximize your time at the career fair
• Observe other students/employers for
clues
• Don't ask about salary and benefits
• Don't monopolize someone's time
• Don't ask, "What do you have for my
major?"
• Don't exhibit a lack of direction and
focus
3. AFTER: THE FOLLOW-UP
You are only as good as your follow-up!
Keep track of those organizations and repre
sentatives with whom you spoke.
Send a thank you letter to those representa
tives you wish to pursue. This will set the
stage for future correspondence.
Dress appropriate! Professional is best unless
it's a more casual event.
