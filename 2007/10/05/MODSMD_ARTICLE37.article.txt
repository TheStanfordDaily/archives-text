Discoveries highlight importance of conservation in threat- almost a yard in length
ened tropical forest, says WWF

WASHINGTON - World Wildlife Fund scientists said today
that the discovery of 11 new animal and plant species in a
remote area in central Vietnam underscores the importance
of conservation efforts in the ancient tropical forests of the
region.
Within the ancient tropical forests of a region known as
Vietnam's "Green Corridor," scientists found a snake, five
orchids, and two butterflies as well as three other plants new
to science and exclusive to the Annamites Mountain Range.
Ten other plant species, including four orchids, are still under
examination but also appear to be new species.
"Discoveries of so many new species are rare and occur only
in very special places like the Green Corridor," said Dr. Chris
Dickinson, WWF's chief conservation scientist in the Green
Corridor. "Several large mammal species were discovered in
the 1990s in the same forests so these latest discoveries may
be just the tip of the iceberg."
The rainforests of the Central Annamites likely existed as con
tinuous undisturbed forest cover for thousands of years, and,
as a result, offer unique habitats for many species, said WWF
experts.
The new snake species, called the white-lipped keel
back, prefers living by streams where it catches frogs
and other small animals. With a beautiful yellow-white
stripe sweeping along its head and red dots covering its
body, the white-lipped keelback can reach 31 inches-

According to WWF
experts, all of these
species are at risk from
illegal logging, hunting,
unsustainable extraction of
natural resources and
conflicting development
interests. However, local
authorities - in particular
the Thua Thien Hue
Provincial Forest Protection
Department - have com
mitted to conserve and
sustainably manage these
valuable forests.
"The area is extremely
important for conservation
and the province wants to
protect the forests and
their environmental ser
vices, as well as contribute
to sustainable develop
ment," said Hoang Ngoc
Khanh, director of Thua
Thien Hue Provincial
Forest Protection
Department.
Stretching from the moun
tainous forests of the
Annamites to one of the
last remaining lowland
wet evergreen forests, the
Green Corridor supports
significant populations of
threatened species and
includes some of the
longest remaining stretch
es of lowland river with
intact forest habitat in
Vietnam feeding into the
Perfume River. Recent sur
veys found 15 reptiles and
amphibians and six bird
species among the threat
ened species living there.
It is also home to one of
the world's most endan
gered primates-white-

Three of the new orchid species are entirely leafless, a rarity
even among orchids. Containing none of the chlorophyll or
green pigment commonly found in plants, these orchids live
on decaying matter like many fungal species. The other new
plants include an aspidistra which produces a nearly black
flower and a newly-discovered species of arum with beautiful
yellow flowers. Arum plants have funnel-shaped leaves sur
rounding the flowers.
The two new butterfly species are among eight discovered in
the province since 1996. One is a skipper - a butterfly with
quick, darting flight habits-from the genus Zela and the other
is a new genus in the subfamily of Satyrinae.

cheeked crested gibbons-and the best location in Vietnam to
save the saola just discovered by scientists in 1992.
According to WWF experts, the forests of the Annamites are
important water catchments, supplying water for thousands of
people who depend on the region's rivers. Local ethnic
minority groups earn more than half of their income from the
non-timber resources of these same forests.
