### 
In these sections, we enlisted the
help of several Stanford Alumni
who have been, or are currently
involved in the energy or envi
ronmental sector. We asked
questions aimed at discovering
what they did in their time on the
Farm, about what led them
down their career paths, and
about any advice they have for
current students. Here are their
answers! You can reach these
alumni for career-related ques

MEREDITH LOPUCH
1999, AB ECONOMICS
1999, BS BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
2001, MS EARTH SYSTEMS
What did you study in college? What were
your favorite classes?
BS in Biology. BA in Economics. And MS in
Earth Systems. My favorite classes were the
upper division Marine Biology courses I took
at Hopkins Marine Station. I spent almost 2
years there between undergrad, grad, and
summers.
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join any
clubs or student organizations?
• Member of the Chi Omega sorority.
• Tutor for Ravenswood (Tutoring pro
gram for EPA middle school students).
• I spent almost 2 years at Hopkins
Marine Station.
• Student advisor for Hopkins Marine
Station for 2 years (senior year and 1 st
grad year).
• Sophomore college student (volcanol
ogy)
• Sophomore college TA for the Hopkins
Marine Station class (summer of my
junior year)
When you came to Stanford, did you have any
thoughts about your career plans? If so, what
were those thoughts?
I knew I loved the ocean and wanted a
career that would keep me connected to it.

In fact I only applied to schools that had a
Marine Biology program or station.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e.
work, volunteer, travel, other experiences)
What did you take away from those experi
ences?
• Freshman summer - chemistry classes
at UCLA - let me get ahead of Stanford
requirements and allowed be to take on
economics.
• Sophomore summer - SCRIPPS
Undergraduate Research Fellowship
(SURF program). This program let me
reaffirm my interest in marine biology but
made me question if academics (ie a
PhD) was the way forward for me.
• Junior summer - Intern in Water
Quality at the Monterey Bay Aquarium
(MBA) and Sophomore College TA. My
internship at the MBA allowed me to try
applied research. After this summer I
knew that academia would not be my
career path.
• Senior Summer - TA for a graduate
course in Biomechanics and Molecular
Physiology at Hopkins. This job reaf
firmed my interest in working with people
and teaching/sharing things that I was
passionate about.
• Grad year one Summer - Intern at the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF). This is the
summer I found my perfect job and
career path.
What was your first job after graduation and what
did you have to do to find it?
After my summer internship at WWF I contin
ued to intern there while I was a full time stu
dent finishing my MS and the following sum
mer this hard work paid off and I was hired
as a Program Associate. After 6 month I was
promoted and started directing WWF's
Community Fisheries Program.
The key with non-profit work is to be willing
to intern/volunteer to get your foot in the
door. Once you are in it is much easier to
get a job. I would strongly encourage stu
dents interested in this kind of work to try to
get internships in their senior year and build
a network.
What were the major responsibilities in your first
job? Was it what you expected?
As the Director of the Community Fisheries
Program I was responsible for all aspects of
development, supervision, and coordination
of the Community Fisheries Program. This
program develops opportunities for small
scale community fisheries, in WWF priority
marine ecoregions around the world, to
become more sustainable by successfully

moving through the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) certification program.
Managing the program requires supervision
of and coordination with over WWF staff
members and consultants from around the
world.
I thing was not expecting, and am now most
grateful for, was the opportunity to do exten
sive international travel. I have gained a
great respect for different cultures and cus
toms and am able to bring these lessons to
my daily life at home.
How did your career evolve after that? How did
you experiences lead to other opportunities?
About a year ago I started a transition within
WWF to take a lead role in our Sustainable
Seafood Initiative. Through this initiative I
working with major seafood buyers — like
Wal-Mart — to encourage and assist them in
using their purchasing power to secure
seafood from environmentally sustainable
sources, assess current seafood supply chains
for sustainability of supply, and use their sup
ply chain to improve fisheries.
What skills and experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
I am one of those few individuals where the
degree was really important for what I am
doing. I doubt I would be successful today
working with fisheries and with major
Seafood businesses if I didn't have the acad
emic/technical background in biology and
economics. The social networking skills was
the other most important skill I learned in
college.
Please provide a brief description of your current
role and examples of typical tasks or projects.
Meredith Lopuch is the director WWF's
Community Fisheries Program where she
develops opportunities for community fish
eries in priority marine ecoregions around
the world to become more sustainable.
Meredith is also a lead in WWF's
Sustainable Seafood Initiative. Through this
initiative Meredith works with major seafood
buyers — like Wal-Mart — to encourage
and assist them in using their purchasing
power to secure seafood from environmen
tally sustainable sources, assess current
seafood supply chains for sustainability of
supply, and use their supply chain to improve
fisheries.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career
the major projects or turning points.
See above. Taking advantages of internships

was a major turning point as well as con
stantly be self motivated in my work.
The turning point that launched me into my
new role was Wal-Mart's commitment that
within 5 years all of their fresh and frozen
wild seafood would be Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) certified. WWF is playing a
central role in helping Wal-mart achieve this
commitment.
If you could go back in time, what do you wish
you had known about the job-search process or
careers in general as a college freshman? Anothe'
way of putting this is, what resources do you wish
you had had at your disposal?
Better access to internships. My journey was
about trying things on until I found what fit.
It would be great if Stanford could provide
the alternatives list. IE If you don't want to be
a doctor or an academic but you like biology
you might consider. . . . and then help stu
dents make those connections.
What are a couple interesting things happening
right now in the environmental sector? Where can
students go to find out more information (i.e.
magazines, web sites, upcoming events)?
