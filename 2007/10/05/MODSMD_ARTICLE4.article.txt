backer Clinton Snyder has
been staring down a major ad
versary since the season
began for the Cardinal, inde
pendent of the team he lines up against
every week. But the third-year sopho
more, who has battled neck "stingers"
since spring practices began, may final
ly be gaining the upper hand.
By his own count, Snyder has suf
fered over five such stingers in the first
four games of the year, which have re
sulted in his being pulled from two con
tests early. A painful injury that in
volves the pinching of a nerve due to
surrounding inflamed tissue, stingers
are a frequent injury on the football
field, but rarely does one player suffer
so many over such a short span.

"I hope now I'm on the road back
up. but I've had some trouble." Snyder
said of his injuries. "It's just a pain issue
â€” the doctors tell me there's no dan
ger of permanent damage or anything
like that. It's just kind of a nerve situa
tion. And I've been getting treatment
on it and different procedures to try
and help it out. and it seems like it's
been responding to some of those
now."
The San Diego-area native has cer
tainlv played as though he's on the way
back. Snyder has notched a team lead
ing three sacks, two of which came in
last week's contest against Arizona
State, and his l c ) tackles over the past
two games have vaulted him into
