# Clinton Snyder Football
## Intensity carries Snyder past pain

backer Clinton Snyder has
been staring down a major ad
versary since the season
began for the Cardinal, inde
pendent of the team he lines up against
every week. But the third-year sopho
more, who has battled neck "stingers"
since spring practices began, may final
ly be gaining the upper hand.
By his own count, Snyder has suf
fered over five such stingers in the first
four games of the year, which have re
sulted in his being pulled from two con
tests early. A painful injury that in
volves the pinching of a nerve due to
surrounding inflamed tissue, stingers
are a frequent injury on the football
field, but rarely does one player suffer
so many over such a short span.

"I hope now I'm on the road back
up. but I've had some trouble." Snyder
said of his injuries. "It's just a pain issue
— the doctors tell me there's no dan
ger of permanent damage or anything
like that. It's just kind of a nerve situa
tion. And I've been getting treatment
on it and different procedures to try
and help it out. and it seems like it's
been responding to some of those
now."
The San Diego-area native has cer
tainlv played as though he's on the way
back. Snyder has notched a team lead
ing three sacks, two of which came in
last week's contest against Arizona
State, and his l c ) tackles over the past
two games have vaulted him into

Sophomore linebacker Clinton Snyder leads the Cardinal in sacks this season with 3, two of which came in Saturday s game against the Sun Devils. Sny
der was limited by neck stingers in the first two games of the season, but returned to record 19 tackles in the Cardinal s contests against Oregon and ASU
fourth place on the team in that stat
with 23 overall.
As a strong-side linebacker, Sny
der is in a unique position to make
an impact both as a pass rusher and
as a more traditional, run-stuffing
linebacker. That versatility has
clearly paid off for him this season,
as Snyder believes his ability to stay
on the field in numerous situations
has been a big factor behind his re
cent success. But the redshirt sopho
more also knows that his ability to
rush the passer is what makes him a
truly dangerous player for opposing
offenses.
"I can be out there in third-and
long situations rushing the passer,
and I can be out there first-and-ten
stopping the run,"he said. "[But] 1
was recruited here to be mostly the
pass rusher type — 1 mean every
where I was recruited that's what I
was recruited for."
Snyder, who describes himself as
an "effort" player, raved about how
well new defensive coordinator
Scott Shafer's scheme has meshed
with players' abilities. Hie Cardinal
played a tenacious,aggressive brand
of defense Saturday against the Sun
Devils that was spoiled by some big
plays for Arizona State spurred by
poor tackling. Stanford did, howev
er, notch six sacks and an additional
four tackles before losing Saturday.
"Coach Shafer's scheme has real
ly been great for us." Snyder said.
"The whole defense has really eaten
it up and bought into it, and one of
the things that comes from his men
tality is that everyone's flying to the
ball on every play. So most of those
sacks [against Arizona State]
weren't just flat-out beating people.
They were just hustle play type
sacks. Those are created from peo
ple just not giving up on the play and
going hard every time."
Standing at 1-3, the Cardinal
faces its toughest test of the season
tomorrow as it heads south to take
on the mighty Trojans of USC, a
team Coach Jim Harbaugh touted
as possibly the best in the history of
college football this past summer.
And with the offense missing sever
al key contributors and leaders in
left tackle Allen Smith, running
back Ibby Gerhart and. most re
cently, quarterback T.C. Ostrander,
the defense could be left to shoulder
the majority of that burden.
But Snyder strongly believes that
nothing should change in the Cardinal's
defensive approach as they prepare to
line up against what might be the na
tion's most talented team.
"I don't think we need to do any
thing different than what we've
been doing all year; we just need to
execute on every play," Snyder said.
"I'm not worried about their good
players because we have good play
ers. Defensively we just need to play
our game and keep doing what
we've been doing — and keep get
ting better."
