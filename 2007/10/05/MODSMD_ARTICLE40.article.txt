When Max Yao, Sloan '03, started his business in
Hangzhou in 2003, he wasn't only eyeing the growing
demand for his products in the domestic China market or
trying to lower his manufacturing costs. The CEO of
Focused Photonics Inc., a maker of toxic gas detection
devices, was also eager to tap China's growing engineer
ing talent pool to help him develop new products. His
company, now one of China's largest industrial instrumen
tation companies, has customers in biomedicine, pharma
ceuticals, and environmental protection. It competes with
global giant Siemens, has distributors in China, the United
States, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has growth plans
that include an upcoming IPO.
Leveraging opportunities in China to improve companies'
operations globally was a recurring theme of discussion
between Stanford faculty and company executives during a
faculty study trip to China in late March. As a recent GSB
graduate and Chinese American who has spent several
years working in China, I was hired by the School's Center
for Global Business and the Economy to develop cases on
companies operating there, and so I was thrilled to
accompany the 12 professors, experts in organizational
behavior, finance, economics, and strategy, as they
queried executives on the operating issues faced by com
panies in China's rapidly developing economy during a
faculty study trip designed and funded by the Global
Center.
Over two dozen Stanford alumni from Palo Alto, Mumbai,
Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai helped the Global
Center with logistics for the trip. Alums were so eager for
the faculty to get a full picture of doing business in China
that they offered to contact alums in competing firms.
Stanford's Beijing and Shanghai alumni chapters extended
warm welcomes to the faculty delegation at alumni events
held in both cities. From SAP's ultra-high-tech develop
ment labs in Shanghai to the cozy meeting rooms of start
up companies in Beijing and intimate meetings with
Stanford alumni over cocktails, a consistent theme
emerged: The country is moving from made in China to
innovate in China.
We learned that a coherent China strategy is more than
just shifting manufacturing production to the Far East and
arbitraging labor costs. For global business leaders, a well
thought out China strategy encompasses tapping a rapidly
expanding end-market, managing a complex operating
environment, attracting and retaining the best talent, and
developing ways to more fully integrate China into their
global value chains.
Some, like software giant SAP find China a lower-cost site

for R&D on global products while others look to tailor
products for the distinctive Chinese consumer market. Still
others are taking advantage of business incentives and
increasingly liberalized business policies provided by the
Chinese government in an effort to build domestic innova
tion capabilities.
In addition to its large manufacturing labor pool, China
has many engineers. The exact number of engineering
graduates in China is the subject of a heated debate at
the moment because statistics from the Chinese govern
ment sometimes combine two-year vocational engineering
degrees with the four-year degrees that are the standard
for calling someone an engineer in the United States.
However, most publications agree China produces at least
twice the engineers that the United States produces annu
ally, and the number is growing. This design talent is what
attracted SAP to invest in a large design center in
Shanghai.
"Rather than using China as a testing site, SAP China is
now responsible for the development of all SAP's small-to
medium-enterprise products," said Markus Alsleben, direc
tor of strategic planning for SAP Labs China. "We work
hard to ensure that China is fully integrated into our glob
al product development effort." With engineering costs a
fraction of those at its Palo Alto site, SAP finds the eco
nomics compelling. SAP also has dedicated R&D teams in
Shanghai and Chengdu developing China-specific prod
ucts because developing markets require slightly different
solutions.
As other companies start to sell to China's large end-user

market, they also realize that even seemingly universal
products require tailoring to fit Chinese businesses and
consumers. We were told several times that having an
R&D team in China is the best way to design what is right
for the target customers. Localization is as important in
sports, we learned, as in software design.
During a visit to the National Basketball Association's
China headquarters in Beijing, Professor George Foster,
who studies global sports organizations among other top
ics, asked Wendy Yu, senior director of NBA-China, to
explain how China came to be the largest outlet for tele
vised games and other products of the American basket
ball league. When Chinese basketball player Yao Ming
got drafted by the Houston Rockets and became a super
star, he brought NBA popularity to China, Yu said. But she
attributed the league's continued success to the ability to
localize production and distribution. For example, the NBA
reproduces its games with a local commentator because
U.S. humor and banter do not translate well into Chinese.
At halftime, the NBA replaces cheerleading with perfor
mances by Chinese pop stars. The phrase "NBA China" is
now among the top five most frequently searched terms
on Chinese search engines, the organization has over 2
million daily visits to its website, and currently it is the
largest NBA organization outside the United States.
Government incentives also play an important role in
infrastructure development for new business and in getting
existing businesses to move up the value chain. Recently
improved foreign investment policies encourage compa
nies to set up permanent offices in China. For example,
the Chinese government continues to liberalize its tradi-
