When Max Yao, Sloan '03, started his business in
Hangzhou in 2003, he wasn't only eyeing the growing
demand for his products in the domestic China market or
trying to lower his manufacturing costs. The CEO of
Focused Photonics Inc., a maker of toxic gas detection
devices, was also eager to tap China's growing engineer
ing talent pool to help him develop new products. His
company, now one of China's largest industrial instrumen
tation companies, has customers in biomedicine, pharma
ceuticals, and environmental protection. It competes with
global giant Siemens, has distributors in China, the United
States, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has growth plans
that include an upcoming IPO.
Leveraging opportunities in China to improve companies'
operations globally was a recurring theme of discussion
between Stanford faculty and company executives during a
faculty study trip to China in late March. As a recent GSB
graduate and Chinese American who has spent several
years working in China, I was hired by the School's Center
for Global Business and the Economy to develop cases on
companies operating there, and so I was thrilled to
accompany the 12 professors, experts in organizational
behavior, finance, economics, and strategy, as they
queried executives on the operating issues faced by com
panies in China's rapidly developing economy during a
faculty study trip designed and funded by the Global
Center.
Over two dozen Stanford alumni from Palo Alto, Mumbai,
Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai helped the Global
Center with logistics for the trip. Alums were so eager for
the faculty to get a full picture of doing business in China
that they offered to contact alums in competing firms.
Stanford's Beijing and Shanghai alumni chapters extended
warm welcomes to the faculty delegation at alumni events
held in both cities. From SAP's ultra-high-tech develop
ment labs in Shanghai to the cozy meeting rooms of start
up companies in Beijing and intimate meetings with
Stanford alumni over cocktails, a consistent theme
emerged: The country is moving from made in China to
innovate in China.
We learned that a coherent China strategy is more than
just shifting manufacturing production to the Far East and
arbitraging labor costs. For global business leaders, a well
thought out China strategy encompasses tapping a rapidly
expanding end-market, managing a complex operating
environment, attracting and retaining the best talent, and
developing ways to more fully integrate China into their
global value chains.
Some, like software giant SAP find China a lower-cost site

for R&D on global products while others look to tailor
products for the distinctive Chinese consumer market. Still
others are taking advantage of business incentives and
increasingly liberalized business policies provided by the
Chinese government in an effort to build domestic innova
tion capabilities.
In addition to its large manufacturing labor pool, China
has many engineers. The exact number of engineering
graduates in China is the subject of a heated debate at
the moment because statistics from the Chinese govern
ment sometimes combine two-year vocational engineering
degrees with the four-year degrees that are the standard
for calling someone an engineer in the United States.
However, most publications agree China produces at least
twice the engineers that the United States produces annu
ally, and the number is growing. This design talent is what
attracted SAP to invest in a large design center in
Shanghai.
"Rather than using China as a testing site, SAP China is
now responsible for the development of all SAP's small-to
medium-enterprise products," said Markus Alsleben, direc
tor of strategic planning for SAP Labs China. "We work
hard to ensure that China is fully integrated into our glob
al product development effort." With engineering costs a
fraction of those at its Palo Alto site, SAP finds the eco
nomics compelling. SAP also has dedicated R&D teams in
Shanghai and Chengdu developing China-specific prod
ucts because developing markets require slightly different
solutions.
As other companies start to sell to China's large end-user

market, they also realize that even seemingly universal
products require tailoring to fit Chinese businesses and
consumers. We were told several times that having an
R&D team in China is the best way to design what is right
for the target customers. Localization is as important in
sports, we learned, as in software design.
During a visit to the National Basketball Association's
China headquarters in Beijing, Professor George Foster,
who studies global sports organizations among other top
ics, asked Wendy Yu, senior director of NBA-China, to
explain how China came to be the largest outlet for tele
vised games and other products of the American basket
ball league. When Chinese basketball player Yao Ming
got drafted by the Houston Rockets and became a super
star, he brought NBA popularity to China, Yu said. But she
attributed the league's continued success to the ability to
localize production and distribution. For example, the NBA
reproduces its games with a local commentator because
U.S. humor and banter do not translate well into Chinese.
At halftime, the NBA replaces cheerleading with perfor
mances by Chinese pop stars. The phrase "NBA China" is
now among the top five most frequently searched terms
on Chinese search engines, the organization has over 2
million daily visits to its website, and currently it is the
largest NBA organization outside the United States.
Government incentives also play an important role in
infrastructure development for new business and in getting
existing businesses to move up the value chain. Recently
improved foreign investment policies encourage compa
nies to set up permanent offices in China. For example,
the Chinese government continues to liberalize its tradi-

tionally closed banking sector, and in April granted addi
tional commercial banking licenses to non-Chinese banks,
including HSBC and Standard Chartered. These licenses
prompted global banking giants such as Citigroup to
establish China offices instead of serving clients in China
from Hong Kong and to move experienced bankers in the
region to China to kick-start the business.
"The infrastructure development in China is simply amaz
ing even compared to what I saw seven years ago," said
Professor Glenn Carroll as we gathered to have lunch at
the food court of Beijing's crowded airport. We reflected
on the impressive skyscrapers that are reshaping the sky
line of China's old capital, the fresh paint smell encoun
tered in many of the boardrooms, and the miles of elevat
ed highways connecting the various sections of Beijing. In
fact, from 2001 to 2005, China added 15,350 miles of
expressways, more than doubling the total to 25,480
miles. The government's ambitions include overtaking the
United States' 46,000 miles of interstate by 2020. As
infrastructure continues to develop, it will drive growth in
related industries; for example, China's automobile market
is the world's second-largest auto market after the United
States with almost 6 million units sold in 2006, and fast
food chains such as McDonald's are planning to add out
lets near highway stops.
Rapid development does not stop at top cities like Beijing,
we were told, because regional governments also are
aware that infrastructure sustains economic growth.
Hangzhou, a city three hours outside of Shanghai, is a
good example. During an elaborate 10-course Chinese
lunch for the GSB delegation hosted by local officials, I
learned that the local government not only provides subsi
dies for real estate and infrastructure development, it also
provides tax breaks to attract companies to set up shop in
the historic city. A Hangzhou official told me that one of
the benefits for foreign companies in setting up shop in
Hangzhou's high-tech development zone is that these new
companies can be tax free for five years if they re-invest
their profits in the city. Hangzhou, known for its natural
scenic beauty and classical Chinese garden architecture,
has been a tourist attraction for centuries-it was a favorite
imperial retreat for Chinese emperors and royal consorts.
The influx of investment by multinational corporations has
added to local attractions a modern technology develop
ment zone just minutes away from the ancient city. This
impressive new area contains clusters of low-rise office
buildings surrounded by grassy areas that look similar to
campuses of technology companies in the Silicon Valley.
■
At the same time that China's economic growth has led to
the rapid development of such "hardware" as mushroom
ing skyscrapers, world-class highways, fast broadband
connections, and the seemingly übiquitous Starbucks cafes
and a dozen or so imitators, companies are still tackling
"software" issues. For many of the companies we visited,
managing China's vast and growing talent pool is the
most difficult. On the bus ride back to the hotel after visit
ing PetroChina in Beijing, labor economics Professor
Robert Flanagan started an animated discussion on
human resource issues facing Chinese companies: "In this
rapidly growing economy, companies are still not strategi
cally looking at human resource issues," he said. Others
agreed, commenting that the function of the HR depart
ment in many Chinese companies was to manage
employee information-in stark contrast with more devel
oped markets, where a clearly articulated HR strategy in
recruitment and retention can drive business growth.
Among the HR challenges they noticed were a shortage of
managerial talent, high employee attrition rates, and a
lack of a comprehensive, China-appropriate management

education.
Company representatives also described an extreme short
age of managerial talent. "The supply of experienced
managers has not kept pace with economic growth, and
many companies are asking employees to do jobs that
they are not qualified to do," said Frank Hawke, a
Stanford alumnus who is chairman of Kroll-Greater
China, a full-service global risk consulting firm with over
60 offices worldwide. Chinese returnees with their new
MBA degrees in hand are in high demand, but there are
still times when companies find Western-trained MBAs not
100 percent effective, given China's complex operating
environment. For example, Gary Dirks of BP-China told
the faculty delegation: "In working and negotiating with
the Chinese government, understanding what is not said
at the negotiation table is sometimes more important than
what is said."
Chinese senior executives such as Liang Xinjun, chairman
of Fosun Group, a Shanghai-based private investment
group, said he has chosen to attend a Chinese-based
executive MBA program rather than one in another coun
try because he wants to hone his management skills in a
program that he believes blends the rigor of Western-style
executive MBA education with teaching materials relevant
to China, such as case studies of companies currently
operating there. Working with the Chinese government is
such a complex topic that Professor Carroll said he could
have spent the entire week of the visit just probing the
nature of the political economy and the ways companies
interact with the government.
Attracting and retaining qualified workers is also a major
task in China. The wealth of opportunities for skilled work
ers means that companies face high employee attrition.
Alsleben of SAP China described how even though SAP
Labs' 281 new hires in 2006 were gleaned from 27,000
applicants, 6 percent of the new hires didn't show up for
their first day of work. In the world of China recruiting,
having a signed acceptance from a candidate does not
automatically translate into headcount. This and similar
examples helped faculty members such as economist
Andrzej Skrzypacz learn about the idiosyncrasies of the
Chinese marketplace and workforce.
According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting of
China, the yearly attrition rate of employees for most com
panies is around 15 percent, with multinational companies
reporting higher rates because Chinese nationals are
quick to move on if they perceive a glass ceiling. The
management teams of multinationals are aware of the
opportunities open to Chinese employees and are begin
ning to focus on retaining good, experienced employees
to improve company performance. Keith Davey, MBA '76,
vice president of planning and development at Ford-
China, summarized the shift: "Most multinational corpora
tions in the nineties relied mainly on expatriates to run the
China operations. The new strategy is to aggressively
localize senior management teams. In addition to cost
management, it gives strong signals to Chinese employees
that there is no glass ceiling. More than anything, it is a
motivational tool to inspire Chinese managers to believe
that one day they can also run a global Fortune 500 com
pany."
■
As China shifts its focus to innovation, companies face a
number of HR challenges that are not easily resolved, but
we observed a number of promising examples. Worksoft,
an R&D outsourcing startup based in Beijing, came up
with a creative HR system to manage both cost and attri
tion. COO David Chen explained: "In hiring, we don't

fight for top engineering talent from top universities in tier
one cities. Instead, we hire top graduates from top univer
sities in tier-two cities. In general, they are still very well
trained, are lower cost, and there is less competition for
them. When it comes to retention, we have a clear career
roadmap for each individual technical staff member, and
we offer them the opportunity to work abroad. For exam
ple, in the current Microsoft project, our engineers are in
the U.S. working with some of the best engineers in the
world. Most Chinese engineers value the opportunity to
work abroad and consider this part of the compensation."
Other positive trends included a report from former state
owned PetroChina that it was seeing an increasing num
ber of Chinese nationals choosing to come back from
abroad. Several top venture capital firms-Sequoia Capital
China and Chengwei Ventures-are run by Stanford GSB
graduates who are Chinese returnees, bringing back glob
al venture and operating experience from their time at
Stanford and in the Silicon Valley. (See sidebar) China's
explosive growth also is attracting overseas ethnic Chinese
and Taiwanese, who bring with them their Chinese lan
guage skills, cultural linkage, and world-class educations.
Some work in multinational companies and serve as the
bridge between the China operations and headquarters,
while others pursue more entrepreneurial opportunities.
Over the course of the trip, faculty members had a chance
to take a closer look at issues facing businesses in China's
rapidly developing economy: from the complex environ
ment within China to how Chinese operations play into
the global strategies of multinational corporations. They
had a chance to examine, question, and learn from a
range of companies and institutions. Finance Professor
James Van Home was interested to learn of activities at
the People's Bank of China to stimulate consumption and
felt that his visit to the bank on this trip provided the back
ground for comparison with other central banks: "A lot of
this experience will definitely make it into our teaching," he
said. Carroll, whose research is in organizations, found
that his visit and tour of Wal-Mart in China provided him
with additional details on the Wal-Mart case discussion in
the GSB classroom. Jeremy Bulow appreciated seeing a
business like Google from a different perspective, facing
different competitors. Hayagreeva Rao, interested in orga
nizational behavior and human resources, observed that
"Chinese companies are definitely seeing themselves in
the global context. Chinese companies in high tech, for
example, see their competitors as Google and Infosys
rather than just local competitors."
Just as China has shaped the global manufacturing land
scape in the last decade, it will no doubt make its impact
on the global innovation landscape in the years to come.
This means any global manager will find China an
inevitable agenda item. The impact of China on many
global companies will be profound: a large end-market, a
low-cost location for innovation and production, and
emerging Chinese competitors rising to challenge estab
lished global competitors. The faculty agreed that the trip
gave them a great deal to think about, and they began to
wonder how the perspectives gained on the trip would
affect their research. Some initiated contact with executives
for the development of case studies, and I am now work
ing with faculty on cases on Worksoft, Lenovo, and
Integrated Design Services. Others are hoping that more
of the Chinese companies we visited can be convinced to
engage in the development of candid cases on human
resource management before and after China's entry into
the World Trade Organization. I'll soon find out if I can
break cultural barriers by getting Chinese executives to talk
about managing human resources in companies where
Chinese Communist Party members are on the board.

graduate and Chinese American who has spent several
years working in China, I was hired by the School's Center
for Global Business and the Economy to develop cases on
companies operating there, and so I was thrilled to
accompany the 12 professors, experts in organizational
behavior, finance, economics, and strategy, as they
queried executives on the operating issues faced by com
panies in China's rapidly developing economy during a
faculty study trip designed and funded by the Global
Center.
Over two dozen Stanford alumni from Palo Alto, Mumbai,
Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai helped the Global
Center with logistics for the trip. Alums were so eager for
the faculty to get a full picture of doing business in China
that they offered to contact alums in competing firms.
Stanford's Beijing and Shanghai alumni chapters extended
warm welcomes to the faculty delegation at alumni events
held in both cities. From SAP's ultra-high-tech develop
ment labs in Shanghai to the cozy meeting rooms of start
up companies in Beijing and intimate meetings with
Stanford alumni over cocktails, a consistent theme
emerged: The country is moving from made in China to
innovate in China.
We learned that a coherent China strategy is more than
just shifting manufacturing production to the Far East and
arbitraging labor costs. For global business leaders, a well
thought out China strategy encompasses tapping a rapidly
expanding end-market, managing a complex operating
environment, attracting and retaining the best talent, and
developing ways to more fully integrate China into their
global value chains.
Some, like software giant SAP find China a lower-cost site

for R&D on global products while others look to tailor
products for the distinctive Chinese consumer market. Still
others are taking advantage of business incentives and
increasingly liberalized business policies provided by the
Chinese government in an effort to build domestic innova
tion capabilities.
In addition to its large manufacturing labor pool, China
has many engineers. The exact number of engineering
graduates in China is the subject of a heated debate at
the moment because statistics from the Chinese govern
ment sometimes combine two-year vocational engineering
degrees with the four-year degrees that are the standard
for calling someone an engineer in the United States.
However, most publications agree China produces at least
twice the engineers that the United States produces annu
ally, and the number is growing. This design talent is what
attracted SAP to invest in a large design center in
Shanghai.
"Rather than using China as a testing site, SAP China is
now responsible for the development of all SAP's small-to
medium-enterprise products," said Markus Alsleben, direc
tor of strategic planning for SAP Labs China. "We work
hard to ensure that China is fully integrated into our glob
al product development effort." With engineering costs a
fraction of those at its Palo Alto site, SAP finds the eco
nomics compelling. SAP also has dedicated R&D teams in
Shanghai and Chengdu developing China-specific prod
ucts because developing markets require slightly different
solutions.
As other companies start to sell to China's large end-user

market, they also realize that even seemingly universal
products require tailoring to fit Chinese businesses and
consumers. We were told several times that having an
R&D team in China is the best way to design what is right
for the target customers. Localization is as important in
sports, we learned, as in software design.
During a visit to the National Basketball Association's
China headquarters in Beijing, Professor George Foster,
who studies global sports organizations among other top
ics, asked Wendy Yu, senior director of NBA-China, to
explain how China came to be the largest outlet for tele
vised games and other products of the American basket
ball league. When Chinese basketball player Yao Ming
got drafted by the Houston Rockets and became a super
star, he brought NBA popularity to China, Yu said. But she
attributed the league's continued success to the ability to
localize production and distribution. For example, the NBA
reproduces its games with a local commentator because
U.S. humor and banter do not translate well into Chinese.
At halftime, the NBA replaces cheerleading with perfor
mances by Chinese pop stars. The phrase "NBA China" is
now among the top five most frequently searched terms
on Chinese search engines, the organization has over 2
million daily visits to its website, and currently it is the
largest NBA organization outside the United States.
Government incentives also play an important role in
infrastructure development for new business and in getting
existing businesses to move up the value chain. Recently
improved foreign investment policies encourage compa
nies to set up permanent offices in China. For example,
the Chinese government continues to liberalize its tradi-

tionally closed banking sector, and in April granted addi
tional commercial banking licenses to non-Chinese banks,
including HSBC and Standard Chartered. These licenses
prompted global banking giants such as Citigroup to
establish China offices instead of serving clients in China
from Hong Kong and to move experienced bankers in the
region to China to kick-start the business.
"The infrastructure development in China is simply amaz
ing even compared to what I saw seven years ago," said
Professor Glenn Carroll as we gathered to have lunch at
the food court of Beijing's crowded airport. We reflected
on the impressive skyscrapers that are reshaping the sky
line of China's old capital, the fresh paint smell encoun
tered in many of the boardrooms, and the miles of elevat
ed highways connecting the various sections of Beijing. In
fact, from 2001 to 2005, China added 15,350 miles of
expressways, more than doubling the total to 25,480
miles. The government's ambitions include overtaking the
United States' 46,000 miles of interstate by 2020. As
infrastructure continues to develop, it will drive growth in
related industries; for example, China's automobile market
is the world's second-largest auto market after the United
States with almost 6 million units sold in 2006, and fast
food chains such as McDonald's are planning to add out
lets near highway stops.
Rapid development does not stop at top cities like Beijing,
we were told, because regional governments also are
aware that infrastructure sustains economic growth.
Hangzhou, a city three hours outside of Shanghai, is a
good example. During an elaborate 10-course Chinese
lunch for the GSB delegation hosted by local officials, I
learned that the local government not only provides subsi
dies for real estate and infrastructure development, it also
provides tax breaks to attract companies to set up shop in
the historic city. A Hangzhou official told me that one of
the benefits for foreign companies in setting up shop in
Hangzhou's high-tech development zone is that these new
companies can be tax free for five years if they re-invest
their profits in the city. Hangzhou, known for its natural
scenic beauty and classical Chinese garden architecture,
has been a tourist attraction for centuries-it was a favorite
imperial retreat for Chinese emperors and royal consorts.
The influx of investment by multinational corporations has
added to local attractions a modern technology develop
ment zone just minutes away from the ancient city. This
impressive new area contains clusters of low-rise office
buildings surrounded by grassy areas that look similar to
campuses of technology companies in the Silicon Valley.
■
At the same time that China's economic growth has led to
the rapid development of such "hardware" as mushroom
ing skyscrapers, world-class highways, fast broadband
connections, and the seemingly übiquitous Starbucks cafes
and a dozen or so imitators, companies are still tackling
"software" issues. For many of the companies we visited,
managing China's vast and growing talent pool is the
most difficult. On the bus ride back to the hotel after visit
ing PetroChina in Beijing, labor economics Professor
Robert Flanagan started an animated discussion on
human resource issues facing Chinese companies: "In this
rapidly growing economy, companies are still not strategi
cally looking at human resource issues," he said. Others
agreed, commenting that the function of the HR depart
ment in many Chinese companies was to manage
employee information-in stark contrast with more devel
oped markets, where a clearly articulated HR strategy in
recruitment and retention can drive business growth.
Among the HR challenges they noticed were a shortage of
managerial talent, high employee attrition rates, and a
lack of a comprehensive, China-appropriate management

education.
Company representatives also described an extreme short
age of managerial talent. "The supply of experienced
managers has not kept pace with economic growth, and
many companies are asking employees to do jobs that
they are not qualified to do," said Frank Hawke, a
Stanford alumnus who is chairman of Kroll-Greater
China, a full-service global risk consulting firm with over
60 offices worldwide. Chinese returnees with their new
MBA degrees in hand are in high demand, but there are
still times when companies find Western-trained MBAs not
100 percent effective, given China's complex operating
environment. For example, Gary Dirks of BP-China told
the faculty delegation: "In working and negotiating with
the Chinese government, understanding what is not said
at the negotiation table is sometimes more important than
what is said."
Chinese senior executives such as Liang Xinjun, chairman
of Fosun Group, a Shanghai-based private investment
group, said he has chosen to attend a Chinese-based
executive MBA program rather than one in another coun
try because he wants to hone his management skills in a
program that he believes blends the rigor of Western-style
executive MBA education with teaching materials relevant
to China, such as case studies of companies currently
operating there. Working with the Chinese government is
such a complex topic that Professor Carroll said he could
have spent the entire week of the visit just probing the
nature of the political economy and the ways companies
interact with the government.
Attracting and retaining qualified workers is also a major
task in China. The wealth of opportunities for skilled work
ers means that companies face high employee attrition.
Alsleben of SAP China described how even though SAP
Labs' 281 new hires in 2006 were gleaned from 27,000
applicants, 6 percent of the new hires didn't show up for
their first day of work. In the world of China recruiting,
having a signed acceptance from a candidate does not
automatically translate into headcount. This and similar
examples helped faculty members such as economist
Andrzej Skrzypacz learn about the idiosyncrasies of the
Chinese marketplace and workforce.
According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting of
China, the yearly attrition rate of employees for most com
panies is around 15 percent, with multinational companies
reporting higher rates because Chinese nationals are
quick to move on if they perceive a glass ceiling. The
management teams of multinationals are aware of the
opportunities open to Chinese employees and are begin
ning to focus on retaining good, experienced employees
to improve company performance. Keith Davey, MBA '76,
vice president of planning and development at Ford-
China, summarized the shift: "Most multinational corpora
tions in the nineties relied mainly on expatriates to run the
China operations. The new strategy is to aggressively
localize senior management teams. In addition to cost
management, it gives strong signals to Chinese employees
that there is no glass ceiling. More than anything, it is a
motivational tool to inspire Chinese managers to believe
that one day they can also run a global Fortune 500 com
pany."
■
As China shifts its focus to innovation, companies face a
number of HR challenges that are not easily resolved, but
we observed a number of promising examples. Worksoft,
an R&D outsourcing startup based in Beijing, came up
with a creative HR system to manage both cost and attri
tion. COO David Chen explained: "In hiring, we don't

fight for top engineering talent from top universities in tier
one cities. Instead, we hire top graduates from top univer
sities in tier-two cities. In general, they are still very well
trained, are lower cost, and there is less competition for
them. When it comes to retention, we have a clear career
roadmap for each individual technical staff member, and
we offer them the opportunity to work abroad. For exam
ple, in the current Microsoft project, our engineers are in
the U.S. working with some of the best engineers in the
world. Most Chinese engineers value the opportunity to
work abroad and consider this part of the compensation."
Other positive trends included a report from former state
owned PetroChina that it was seeing an increasing num
ber of Chinese nationals choosing to come back from
abroad. Several top venture capital firms-Sequoia Capital
China and Chengwei Ventures-are run by Stanford GSB
graduates who are Chinese returnees, bringing back glob
al venture and operating experience from their time at
Stanford and in the Silicon Valley. (See sidebar) China's
explosive growth also is attracting overseas ethnic Chinese
and Taiwanese, who bring with them their Chinese lan
guage skills, cultural linkage, and world-class educations.
Some work in multinational companies and serve as the
bridge between the China operations and headquarters,
while others pursue more entrepreneurial opportunities.
Over the course of the trip, faculty members had a chance
to take a closer look at issues facing businesses in China's
rapidly developing economy: from the complex environ
ment within China to how Chinese operations play into
the global strategies of multinational corporations. They
had a chance to examine, question, and learn from a
range of companies and institutions. Finance Professor
James Van Home was interested to learn of activities at
the People's Bank of China to stimulate consumption and
felt that his visit to the bank on this trip provided the back
ground for comparison with other central banks: "A lot of
this experience will definitely make it into our teaching," he
said. Carroll, whose research is in organizations, found
that his visit and tour of Wal-Mart in China provided him
with additional details on the Wal-Mart case discussion in
the GSB classroom. Jeremy Bulow appreciated seeing a
business like Google from a different perspective, facing
different competitors. Hayagreeva Rao, interested in orga
nizational behavior and human resources, observed that
"Chinese companies are definitely seeing themselves in
the global context. Chinese companies in high tech, for
example, see their competitors as Google and Infosys
rather than just local competitors."
Just as China has shaped the global manufacturing land
scape in the last decade, it will no doubt make its impact
on the global innovation landscape in the years to come.
This means any global manager will find China an
inevitable agenda item. The impact of China on many
global companies will be profound: a large end-market, a
low-cost location for innovation and production, and
emerging Chinese competitors rising to challenge estab
lished global competitors. The faculty agreed that the trip
gave them a great deal to think about, and they began to
wonder how the perspectives gained on the trip would
affect their research. Some initiated contact with executives
for the development of case studies, and I am now work
ing with faculty on cases on Worksoft, Lenovo, and
Integrated Design Services. Others are hoping that more
of the Chinese companies we visited can be convinced to
engage in the development of candid cases on human
resource management before and after China's entry into
the World Trade Organization. I'll soon find out if I can
break cultural barriers by getting Chinese executives to talk
about managing human resources in companies where
Chinese Communist Party members are on the board.

When Max Yao, Sloan '03, started his business in
Hangzhou in 2003, he wasn't only eyeing the growing
demand for his products in the domestic China market or
trying to lower his manufacturing costs. The CEO of
Focused Photonics Inc., a maker of toxic gas detection
devices, was also eager to tap China's growing engineer
ing talent pool to help him develop new products. His
company, now one of China's largest industrial instrumen
tation companies, has customers in biomedicine, pharma
ceuticals, and environmental protection. It competes with
global giant Siemens, has distributors in China, the United
States, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has growth plans
that include an upcoming IPO.

We learned that a coherent China strategy is more than
just shifting manufacturing production to the Far East and
arbitraging labor costs. For global business leaders, a well
thought out China strategy encompasses tapping a rapidly
expanding end-market, managing a complex operating
environment, attracting and retaining the best talent, and
developing ways to more fully integrate China into their
global value chains.
Some, like software giant SAP find China a lower-cost site

for R&D on global products while others look to tailor
products for the distinctive Chinese consumer market. Still
others are taking advantage of business incentives and
increasingly liberalized business policies provided by the
Chinese government in an effort to build domestic innova
tion capabilities.
In addition to its large manufacturing labor pool, China
has many engineers. The exact number of engineering
graduates in China is the subject of a heated debate at
the moment because statistics from the Chinese govern
ment sometimes combine two-year vocational engineering
degrees with the four-year degrees that are the standard
for calling someone an engineer in the United States.
However, most publications agree China produces at least
twice the engineers that the United States produces annu
ally, and the number is growing. This design talent is what
attracted SAP to invest in a large design center in
Shanghai.
"Rather than using China as a testing site, SAP China is
now responsible for the development of all SAP's small-to
medium-enterprise products," said Markus Alsleben, direc
tor of strategic planning for SAP Labs China. "We work
hard to ensure that China is fully integrated into our glob
al product development effort." With engineering costs a
fraction of those at its Palo Alto site, SAP finds the eco
nomics compelling. SAP also has dedicated R&D teams in
Shanghai and Chengdu developing China-specific prod
ucts because developing markets require slightly different
solutions.
As other companies start to sell to China's large end-user

market, they also realize that even seemingly universal
products require tailoring to fit Chinese businesses and
consumers. We were told several times that having an
R&D team in China is the best way to design what is right
for the target customers. Localization is as important in
sports, we learned, as in software design.
During a visit to the National Basketball Association's
China headquarters in Beijing, Professor George Foster,
who studies global sports organizations among other top
ics, asked Wendy Yu, senior director of NBA-China, to
explain how China came to be the largest outlet for tele
vised games and other products of the American basket
ball league. When Chinese basketball player Yao Ming
got drafted by the Houston Rockets and became a super
star, he brought NBA popularity to China, Yu said. But she
attributed the league's continued success to the ability to
localize production and distribution. For example, the NBA
reproduces its games with a local commentator because
U.S. humor and banter do not translate well into Chinese.
At halftime, the NBA replaces cheerleading with perfor
mances by Chinese pop stars. The phrase "NBA China" is
now among the top five most frequently searched terms
on Chinese search engines, the organization has over 2
million daily visits to its website, and currently it is the
largest NBA organization outside the United States.
Government incentives also play an important role in
infrastructure development for new business and in getting
existing businesses to move up the value chain. Recently
improved foreign investment policies encourage compa
nies to set up permanent offices in China. For example,
the Chinese government continues to liberalize its tradi-

tionally closed banking sector, and in April granted addi
tional commercial banking licenses to non-Chinese banks,
including HSBC and Standard Chartered. These licenses
prompted global banking giants such as Citigroup to
establish China offices instead of serving clients in China
from Hong Kong and to move experienced bankers in the
region to China to kick-start the business.
"The infrastructure development in China is simply amaz
ing even compared to what I saw seven years ago," said
Professor Glenn Carroll as we gathered to have lunch at
the food court of Beijing's crowded airport. We reflected
on the impressive skyscrapers that are reshaping the sky
line of China's old capital, the fresh paint smell encoun
tered in many of the boardrooms, and the miles of elevat
ed highways connecting the various sections of Beijing. In
fact, from 2001 to 2005, China added 15,350 miles of
expressways, more than doubling the total to 25,480
miles. The government's ambitions include overtaking the
United States' 46,000 miles of interstate by 2020. As
infrastructure continues to develop, it will drive growth in
related industries; for example, China's automobile market
is the world's second-largest auto market after the United
States with almost 6 million units sold in 2006, and fast
food chains such as McDonald's are planning to add out
lets near highway stops.
Rapid development does not stop at top cities like Beijing,
we were told, because regional governments also are
aware that infrastructure sustains economic growth.
Hangzhou, a city three hours outside of Shanghai, is a
good example. During an elaborate 10-course Chinese
lunch for the GSB delegation hosted by local officials, I
learned that the local government not only provides subsi
dies for real estate and infrastructure development, it also
provides tax breaks to attract companies to set up shop in
the historic city. A Hangzhou official told me that one of
the benefits for foreign companies in setting up shop in
Hangzhou's high-tech development zone is that these new
companies can be tax free for five years if they re-invest
their profits in the city. Hangzhou, known for its natural
scenic beauty and classical Chinese garden architecture,
has been a tourist attraction for centuries-it was a favorite
imperial retreat for Chinese emperors and royal consorts.
The influx of investment by multinational corporations has
added to local attractions a modern technology develop
ment zone just minutes away from the ancient city. This
impressive new area contains clusters of low-rise office
buildings surrounded by grassy areas that look similar to
campuses of technology companies in the Silicon Valley.
■
At the same time that China's economic growth has led to
the rapid development of such "hardware" as mushroom
ing skyscrapers, world-class highways, fast broadband
connections, and the seemingly übiquitous Starbucks cafes
and a dozen or so imitators, companies are still tackling
"software" issues. For many of the companies we visited,
managing China's vast and growing talent pool is the
most difficult. On the bus ride back to the hotel after visit
ing PetroChina in Beijing, labor economics Professor
Robert Flanagan started an animated discussion on
human resource issues facing Chinese companies: "In this
rapidly growing economy, companies are still not strategi
cally looking at human resource issues," he said. Others
agreed, commenting that the function of the HR depart
ment in many Chinese companies was to manage
employee information-in stark contrast with more devel
oped markets, where a clearly articulated HR strategy in
recruitment and retention can drive business growth.
Among the HR challenges they noticed were a shortage of
managerial talent, high employee attrition rates, and a
lack of a comprehensive, China-appropriate management

education.
Company representatives also described an extreme short
age of managerial talent. "The supply of experienced
managers has not kept pace with economic growth, and
many companies are asking employees to do jobs that
they are not qualified to do," said Frank Hawke, a
Stanford alumnus who is chairman of Kroll-Greater
China, a full-service global risk consulting firm with over
60 offices worldwide. Chinese returnees with their new
MBA degrees in hand are in high demand, but there are
still times when companies find Western-trained MBAs not
100 percent effective, given China's complex operating
environment. For example, Gary Dirks of BP-China told
the faculty delegation: "In working and negotiating with
the Chinese government, understanding what is not said
at the negotiation table is sometimes more important than
what is said."
Chinese senior executives such as Liang Xinjun, chairman
of Fosun Group, a Shanghai-based private investment
group, said he has chosen to attend a Chinese-based
executive MBA program rather than one in another coun
try because he wants to hone his management skills in a
program that he believes blends the rigor of Western-style
executive MBA education with teaching materials relevant
to China, such as case studies of companies currently
operating there. Working with the Chinese government is
such a complex topic that Professor Carroll said he could
have spent the entire week of the visit just probing the
nature of the political economy and the ways companies
interact with the government.
Attracting and retaining qualified workers is also a major
task in China. The wealth of opportunities for skilled work
ers means that companies face high employee attrition.
Alsleben of SAP China described how even though SAP
Labs' 281 new hires in 2006 were gleaned from 27,000
applicants, 6 percent of the new hires didn't show up for
their first day of work. In the world of China recruiting,
having a signed acceptance from a candidate does not
automatically translate into headcount. This and similar
examples helped faculty members such as economist
Andrzej Skrzypacz learn about the idiosyncrasies of the
Chinese marketplace and workforce.
According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting of
China, the yearly attrition rate of employees for most com
panies is around 15 percent, with multinational companies
reporting higher rates because Chinese nationals are
quick to move on if they perceive a glass ceiling. The
management teams of multinationals are aware of the
opportunities open to Chinese employees and are begin
ning to focus on retaining good, experienced employees
to improve company performance. Keith Davey, MBA '76,
vice president of planning and development at Ford-
China, summarized the shift: "Most multinational corpora
tions in the nineties relied mainly on expatriates to run the
China operations. The new strategy is to aggressively
localize senior management teams. In addition to cost
management, it gives strong signals to Chinese employees
that there is no glass ceiling. More than anything, it is a
motivational tool to inspire Chinese managers to believe
that one day they can also run a global Fortune 500 com
pany."
■
As China shifts its focus to innovation, companies face a
number of HR challenges that are not easily resolved, but
we observed a number of promising examples. Worksoft,
an R&D outsourcing startup based in Beijing, came up
with a creative HR system to manage both cost and attri
tion. COO David Chen explained: "In hiring, we don't

fight for top engineering talent from top universities in tier
one cities. Instead, we hire top graduates from top univer
sities in tier-two cities. In general, they are still very well
trained, are lower cost, and there is less competition for
them. When it comes to retention, we have a clear career
roadmap for each individual technical staff member, and
we offer them the opportunity to work abroad. For exam
ple, in the current Microsoft project, our engineers are in
the U.S. working with some of the best engineers in the
world. Most Chinese engineers value the opportunity to
work abroad and consider this part of the compensation."
Other positive trends included a report from former state
owned PetroChina that it was seeing an increasing num
ber of Chinese nationals choosing to come back from
abroad. Several top venture capital firms-Sequoia Capital
China and Chengwei Ventures-are run by Stanford GSB
graduates who are Chinese returnees, bringing back glob
al venture and operating experience from their time at
Stanford and in the Silicon Valley. (See sidebar) China's
explosive growth also is attracting overseas ethnic Chinese
and Taiwanese, who bring with them their Chinese lan
guage skills, cultural linkage, and world-class educations.
Some work in multinational companies and serve as the
bridge between the China operations and headquarters,
while others pursue more entrepreneurial opportunities.
Over the course of the trip, faculty members had a chance
to take a closer look at issues facing businesses in China's
rapidly developing economy: from the complex environ
ment within China to how Chinese operations play into
the global strategies of multinational corporations. They
had a chance to examine, question, and learn from a
range of companies and institutions. Finance Professor
James Van Home was interested to learn of activities at
the People's Bank of China to stimulate consumption and
felt that his visit to the bank on this trip provided the back
ground for comparison with other central banks: "A lot of
this experience will definitely make it into our teaching," he
said. Carroll, whose research is in organizations, found
that his visit and tour of Wal-Mart in China provided him
with additional details on the Wal-Mart case discussion in
the GSB classroom. Jeremy Bulow appreciated seeing a
business like Google from a different perspective, facing
different competitors. Hayagreeva Rao, interested in orga
nizational behavior and human resources, observed that
"Chinese companies are definitely seeing themselves in
the global context. Chinese companies in high tech, for
example, see their competitors as Google and Infosys
rather than just local competitors."
Just as China has shaped the global manufacturing land
scape in the last decade, it will no doubt make its impact
on the global innovation landscape in the years to come.
This means any global manager will find China an
inevitable agenda item. The impact of China on many
global companies will be profound: a large end-market, a
low-cost location for innovation and production, and
emerging Chinese competitors rising to challenge estab
lished global competitors. The faculty agreed that the trip
gave them a great deal to think about, and they began to
wonder how the perspectives gained on the trip would
affect their research. Some initiated contact with executives
for the development of case studies, and I am now work
ing with faculty on cases on Worksoft, Lenovo, and
Integrated Design Services. Others are hoping that more
of the Chinese companies we visited can be convinced to
engage in the development of candid cases on human
resource management before and after China's entry into
the World Trade Organization. I'll soon find out if I can
break cultural barriers by getting Chinese executives to talk
about managing human resources in companies where
Chinese Communist Party members are on the board.

When Max Yao, Sloan '03, started his business in
Hangzhou in 2003, he wasn't only eyeing the growing
demand for his products in the domestic China market or
trying to lower his manufacturing costs. The CEO of
Focused Photonics Inc., a maker of toxic gas detection
devices, was also eager to tap China's growing engineer
ing talent pool to help him develop new products. His
company, now one of China's largest industrial instrumen
tation companies, has customers in biomedicine, pharma
ceuticals, and environmental protection. It competes with
global giant Siemens, has distributors in China, the United
States, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has growth plans
that include an upcoming IPO.
Leveraging opportunities in China to improve companies'
operations globally was a recurring theme of discussion
between Stanford faculty and company executives during a
faculty study trip to China in late March. As a recent GSB
graduate and Chinese American who has spent several
years working in China, I was hired by the School's Center
for Global Business and the Economy to develop cases on
companies operating there, and so I was thrilled to
accompany the 12 professors, experts in organizational
behavior, finance, economics, and strategy, as they
queried executives on the operating issues faced by com
panies in China's rapidly developing economy during a
faculty study trip designed and funded by the Global
Center.
Over two dozen Stanford alumni from Palo Alto, Mumbai,
Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai helped the Global
Center with logistics for the trip. Alums were so eager for
the faculty to get a full picture of doing business in China
that they offered to contact alums in competing firms.
Stanford's Beijing and Shanghai alumni chapters extended
warm welcomes to the faculty delegation at alumni events
held in both cities. From SAP's ultra-high-tech develop
ment labs in Shanghai to the cozy meeting rooms of start
up companies in Beijing and intimate meetings with
Stanford alumni over cocktails, a consistent theme
emerged: The country is moving from made in China to
innovate in China.
We learned that a coherent China strategy is more than
just shifting manufacturing production to the Far East and
arbitraging labor costs. For global business leaders, a well
