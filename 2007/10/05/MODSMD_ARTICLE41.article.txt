# Business & Finance Alumni Corner

### 
In these sections, we enlisted the help of several Stanford
Alumni who have been, or are currently involved in the
business & finance sector. We asked questions aimed at
discovering what they did in their time on the Farm, about
what led them into the field, and about any advice they
have for current students. Here are their answers! You can

What did you study in college?
Economics with honors in Science, Technology and Society.
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford?
Taking care of my two young children. Did you join any
clubs or student organizations? I started the Stanford
Parents' Network which is an organization of Stanford affili
ates with children supporting one another. Originally the
organization was primarily students with children, though it
has grown over time to include students, professors and
staff with children.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about
your career plans? If so, what were those thoughts?
I thought I was going to implement my thesis which was
creating an expert system to motivate healthy behavior
changes using health education theories.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experi
ences?
I took classes, wrote my thesis, took care of my kids and
ran errands that I didn't have time to do during the year.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have
to do to find it?
I started working at Merrill Lynch as a Financial Advisor.
My mom had given me some information on good jobs
and this one looked interesting. I did some research to find
the best place to work and Merrill Lynch primarily kept
coming up as the #1 or sometimes the #2, so I applied
and took a personality and economics exam. Then when I
received the offer which came quicker than I expected, I
had to get another offer at another firm, so I could negoti
ate a higher salary.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job?
Portfolio management, financial planning and attracting
clients, basically helping people achieve their goals and

dreams. Was it what you expected? Honestly, I wasn't sure
what to expect. The first 6 months I sat in a suit and stud
ied at a cubicle for the series 7 exam and a few other
exams before I was allowed to talk to clients, give advice or
trade. Then I worked and studies to get various additional
designations for several more years while I built my prac
tice.
How did your career evolve after that?
The first five years you work very hard and build a practice
of your own which eventually is very lucrative and reward
ing. Then it's up to you how hard you work depending
upon how much money you want to make. How did you
experiences lead to other opportunities? I met a lot of
wonderful people whom I am helping achieve various
things in their lives from building businesses, retirement and
college planning, charitable giving strategies, estate plan
ning. You really get to know people in depth, so they refer
other people to you and most of them really appreciate
and understand how you have changed their lives. Since
you are helping people achieve their goals and dreams,
you also think about your own, so move toward making
your own life rewarding. That's why I obtained my CIMA
designation so I could also be a consultant for endow
ments, nonprofits and work with more philanthropically
inclined people. I'm also an International Wealth
Management Advisor, so I have clients all over the planet.
What skills and experiences from college were most important in
your career development?
Everything I learned in college and life is relevant to what I
am doing now. I should probably explain that I was a re
entry student and had other jobs prior to going back to col
lege. I don't just mean the economics and Science,
Technology and Society background, but other things I
studied and read about psychology, marketing, business . .
. . Your Stanford degree will hold a lot of weight with
respect to your credibility from prospective clients who are
thinking about hiring you to manage their money.
Please provide a brief description of your current role and exam
ples of typical tasks or projects.
I generally start by profiling someone to help them deter
mine their goals and what they have done so far to achieve
them. We also look at what risks could affect their lives
adversely. We determine and review additional steps to
should consider, quantify their strategies, implement the
solutions and review their progress -altering strategies as
goals or economic conditions change. Naturally, I design
portfolios to go along with their life strategies. I'm looking
at retirement planning, college planning, estate planning,
concentrated stock strategies, philanthropy, business
finance, mortgages, selling businesses. I'm on the phone,
meeting people, have three computer monitors, read regu
larly and have a lot of paperwork, though my assistant
processes everything for me and follows-up to make sure
things get done. I'm currently working toward having her
schedule appointments with existing clients to free up my
time so I can take on more clients.
I'm sorry. I'm out of time! I hope that was helpful and to
the point. If anyone wants to ask me any more questions

or have me go more in depth one specific questions, you
are welcome to call me and ask for me. This has been
rated the #1 to #3 job to have for the last several years by
a some important pole (thought I can't think of it now). I
also learned during the tech bubble burst that it has a lot of
job security once you are successful where everyone in the
firm was offered a voluntary severance package to quit,
except the Financial Advisor, and that included l-banking
which used to be upstairs.

job security once you are successful where everyone in the

except the Financial Advisor, and that included l-banking
which used to be upstairs.
