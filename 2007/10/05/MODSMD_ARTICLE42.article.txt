If you are interested in finding out more about the Biotech
field, Yali Friedman's book, "Building Biotechnology" is an
excellent starling point and can help in understanding how
biotechnology companies work from legal and regulatory
issues to business and science aspects and is available in the
CDC Resource Library. If you are looking for current up-to
date input on what's going on in the field of Biotech,
Fierceßiotech is an excellent resource which you can sub
scribe to and receive daily updates on the current happen
ings within the field. For September 25, 2007, some of the
top stories included: Amgen dropping the axe at corporate
HQ; Alcon facing setback on experimental AMD therapy;
AstraZeneca releases upbeat data on cancer drug; Arena
Pharma producing positive insomnia data; Cellerix gaining
$38M for stem cell work. This daily resource found at
www.fiercebiotech.com is a valuable inbox email that will
keep you in touch with the latest and greatest happenings.
Talking with alumni who work in the field of Biotech is the
best way for you to find out about the field and also establish
your professional network. An invaluable resource that you
will hear about again and again (because networking works!)
is the Stanford Career Network that is found at
http://www.stanfordalumni.org/career/home.html. This is a
database of alumni, who have volunteered to conduct infor
mational interviews with students and other alumni. They are
willing to discuss a variety of subjects including job search
strategies, industry/company information, career options and
other related areas.
Other resources listed below may be of help to you in your
understanding/research of the field, search for a full-time job
or search for a summer internship within the field of Biotech.
