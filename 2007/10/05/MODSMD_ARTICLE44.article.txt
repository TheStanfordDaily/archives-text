# CAREERS IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY
## 
### Bev Principal, Assistant Director Career Development Center 
Bioengineering faculty, staff, and students are inventing the
future of biomedicine. At Stanford, the department is com
prised of five areas of research:
Biomedical Computation
Biomedical Devices
Biomedical Imaging
Cell/Molecular Engineering
Regenerative Medicine
The focus of this article is careers in the medical device
industry. Visit the Bioengineering Department web page at
http://bioengineering.stanford.edu for details on other areas
of research.
Also, check out the Stanford Biodesign website:
http://biodesign.stanford.edu/bdn/index.jsp. It provides infor
motion on fellowships, courses, networking and events and
other areas of interest specific to medical devices.
Researchers working in biomedical design invent new tech
nologies for life sciences research and clinical applications.
Bioengineers are helping to translate advances in the life sci
ences into devices that directly impact human welfare and
the future of scientific research.
RESEARCH PROJECTS INCLUDE:
Neural prosthetic systems

Development of cellular-microelectrode hybrid biosensors
Synthetic bone materials for fracture fixation
Micro-Electrical-Mechanical (MEMS) devices
Microfluidic devices
Computer-assisted surgical navigation
Novel drug delivery systems
WORKING IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY.
This is an exciting time for the industry.
On April 24, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported*
"Biotechnology was the hottest sector in venture capital in the
first quarter of this year as investors poured in $7.1 billion in
778 deals, the highest level of funding for any quarter since
late 2001. Underscoring the expanding investor interest in
life sciences, deals for companies making medical devices
reached a record of $1.08 billion for 96 deals, a6O percent
jump from the level of funding in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The trend highlights growing interest in emerging medical
and biotech research and the view of investors that the mar
ket for health-related technologies will continue to grow,
especially as Baby Boomers age."
Medical device employers range in size from small, venture
funded startups, to large, more established organizations.
Take some time to consider carefully what type of environ
ment you wish to work in. Many times, the smaller, startup
type environments are not able to offer the one-on-one men
toring and structured training programs that a larger organi
zation might have available. The startup environments can
be wild and crazy and fast-paced, with a team that is
focused. Think about where you'd be most comfortable.
CAREER PREPARATION.
Medical device companies offer opportunities, both full time
and internships, in a wide variety of researcher, scientist and
engineering roles. These employers typically look for candi
dates majoring in Bioengineering, Biomechanical
Engineering, Biomedical Computation, Mechanical
Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science,
Product Design, Biological Sciences, Computer Science,
Electrical Engineering, and Human Biology. Preparing for a
full time job in this industry should include a related summer
internship.
