## IS WAR GOOD FOR MEDICINE? War's Medical Legacy 
### Christopher Connell 
Reprinted from Stanford Medicine Magazine with permis

From Thermopylae to Baghdad, from the Gallic wars to
Vietnam, war has proved an exacting but efficient school
master for physicians. Hippocrates wrote, "He who would
become a surgeon should join an army and follow it."
Second-century Greek physician Galen honed his skills not
only in the sanctuary of Aesclepius, god of healing, but as
physician to the gladiators of Pergamon. The American
teenager pried from a twisted wreck on a Friday night and
sped to a suburban hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the
horse-drawn wagons (known as "flying ambulances") that
Dominique Jean Larrey, MD, invented to carry injured sol
diers in Napoleon's army and the professional ambulance
corps that Jonathan Letterman, MD, instituted for the Army
of the Potomac after the disastrous first Battle of Bull Run,
where the wounded were left on the field when Union
troops fled back to Washington.
Gunshot victims wheeled into any big city trauma center
benefit from techniques that a generation of EMTs and sur
geons first learned repairing combat wounds. "Most of the
emergency medical response doctrine in practice in the
United States today evolved from medical experiences in
the jungles of Southeast Asia in the late 19605," says Lt.
Gen. Kevin Kiley, MD, surgeon general of the U.S. Army.
For all the destruction and chaos it wreaks, war spurs some
medical advances. Historically, trauma surgery, emergency
care and infectious disease treatments leap the furthest
ahead. Military medicine stretches back to antiquity.
Augustus Caesar formed a medical corps for his legions.
Roman surgeons tied ligatures and clamped arteries to
control bleeding, and the vinegar they poured into wounds
acted as an antiseptic. Galen, court physician to Marcus
Aurelius in Rome, performed bold operations and gained
an understanding of the human anatomy that was unsur
passed well into the second millennium. Ambrose Pare, the
16th-century French physician who figured out that wounds
healed faster if you didn't pour boiling oil onto them,
observed that the only people who gain from warfare are
young surgeons. French Army surgeon Jean Louis Petit's
invention of the screw tourniquet in 1718 made it possible
to amputate legs above the knee without bleeding the
patient to death. His device, which cut the flow from the
femoral artery, would be in every military surgeon's kit until
well after the U.S. Civil War. Even with such equipment,
until anesthetics came along, surgeons' reputations rested
principally on the speed with which they could saw off
limbs.
ADVANCES REAL AND IMAGINED
While wars provide ample opportunities for surgeons to
hone their skills, some historians believe their contributions
to the medical arts are modest if not minimal. F.H.

Garrison, MD, in An Introduction to the History of Medicine
(1929), wrote about World War I, "Viewed after the lapse
of a decade, the medical innovations and inventions of the
war period seem clever, respectable, but not particularly
brilliant." More recently, British sociologist Roger Cooter,
PhD, made the argument that, "For the most part, war has
accelerated research into old medical problems of military
importance, the bulk of which are highly specific to that
context and of little value outside it." During most modern
wars, Cooter says, civilians' health needs have taken a
back seat to the medical needs of the military.
Throughout most of recorded history, disease, not arrows,
bullets or bombs, was the scourge of armies. Generals
have long understood the importance of sanitation to the
health of their troops. The French Army instituted physical
exams for new soldiers in the early 18th century; soon
recruits and conscripts were being poked and measured in
all of Europe's armies. At Valley Forge in 1 777, Gen.
George Washington ordered the Continental Army inocu
lated against smallpox. "Should the disorder infect the
Army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence,
we should have more to dread from it than from the sword
of the enemy," wrote Washington, whose visage bore the
scars of a bout with smallpox at age 19.
Still, among the 70,000 colonials who died during the
Revolutionary War, nine were felled by disease for every
one who died at the hands of the redcoats. Among the
31,000 British fatalities, just 4,000 were killed in action. In
the Civil War, three-fifths of the 304,369 Union dead were
victims of disease, not casualties of battle. It took until the
20th century for the arts of medicine and warfare to
advance to the point where more combatants died from
battle wounds than from diseases. The United States was a
late entrant to World War I, but there were 53,402
Americans killed in action and 63,114 dead from other
causes. By World War 11, the Pentagon counted 291,557
deaths in action and 113,842 from other causes.
Over the centuries, as armies moved away from frontal
combat and learned to unleash deadlier force across
greater distances, war became less lethal for combatants
and more lethal for civilians. More than 6 million of the 15
million lives lost in World War I were civilians; in World War
11, the first global conflict, at least 35 million civilians per
ished - including more than 200,000 in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki from atomic bombs, and 6 million European
Jews by genocide - dwarfing the 20 million military fatali
ties.
Whatever the historians' verdicts, wars are popularly associ
ated with medical advances in the public mind, such as the
blood banks that Oswald Hope Robertson, MD, created for
the Army Medical Corps in France in 1918, and penicillin,
the antibiotic that came to prominence and became widely
available during World War 11. But Dale Smith, PhD, who
chairs the medical history department at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences, or USUHS, in

Bethesda, Md., says that in both instances, the real break
throughs occurred in laboratories in the decade before the
world wars.
Still, when the United States entered World War I, manuals
for battle surgeons contained illustrations showing them
how to sew a donor's radial artery to the basilic vein of the
wounded comrade for direct transfusion. "By the end of the
war, those pages are gone and those same books show
how to keep blood in storage boxes protected by ice and
sawdust, and how to treat the blood to transfuse it safely,"
says Col. David Burris, MD, chief of the Norman M. Rich
Department of Surgery at USUHS. While Sir Alexander
Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin took place in
1928, the antibiotic remained in short supply until the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry performed a second miracle in
gearing up industrial production of the scarce antibiotic
during World War 11.
EMERGENa MEDICINE'S CRUCIBLE
The Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital, or MASH, not only
saved lives in Korea, but entered American folklore thanks
to Robert Altman's 1970 black comedy, M*A*S*H, and the
hit television series. The idea for MASH, however, originat
ed in World War II with a Boston chest surgeon, Col.
Edward "Pete" Churchill, MD, who in 1943 moved his best
surgeons forward into rudimentary, auxiliary field hospitals
during the invasion of Italy. A young Michael Deßakey, MD,
serving on the surgeon general's brain trust in Washington,
later helped institutionalize the practice.
Vietnam gave new meaning to the term "flying ambu
lances" as daring Huey helicopter pilots ferried the wound
ed out of jungle battle zones. Even "dust off" - the military
call sign for those evacuations - entered the American lexi
con. Indeed, President George W. Bush held a ceremony in
the White House in late February to present the
Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Bruce Crandall,
one of those Huey pilots, for darting in and out of a raging
firefight in Vietnam's la Drang Valley 14 times on a single
day in November 1965 to rescue and resupply a 1 st
Cavalry battalion. His wingman, Ed Freeman, received the
same honor in 2001.
Such feats not only proved the pilots' mettle, but demon
strated what a lifesaver the sturdy little Huey - the Bell UH-1
Iroquois - could be. That lesson was not lost on hospital
administrators and trauma surgeons back home. The
Pentagon in 1968 lent helicopters for a pilot program to
rescue accident victims from highway crashes in San
Antonio and Dallas, and Baltimore trauma surgeon Adams
Cowley, MD, convinced Maryland authorities to create the
first statewide transport system in the early 19705. Today,
no self-respecting trauma hospital is complete without a
helipad.
The crucible of conflict whets appetites for more and better
medicine. Cooter, the British sociologist, wrote in the
Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine
(1993): "Wars such as the American Civil and the First
World War exposed large numbers of men to modern
medicine and dentistry for the first time: one by one,
recruits were stripped for examination, measured, weighed,
tapped, and interrogated. Along with the soldiers and
sailors whose lives were spared by the skills of military sur
geons, such men may have returned home from war with
higher demands for and expectations of orthodox medicine
than when they left." Smith, the historian of military medi
cine, notes the same phenomenon occurred after World
War 11, in which 30 percent of the nation's physicians had
been pressed into service to attend to the needs of the 8
percent of the population under arms.
Perhaps war's greatest contribution to medicine is the
chance to run public health experiments on a grand scale
under exigent circumstances. Letterman's Civil War ambu
lance corps was a dry run for today's emergency medical
services. Indeed, the municipal ambulance system that New
York's Bellevue Hospital launched in 1869 was modeled
on the medical transports that Edward Dalton, MD, orga
nized for the Army of the Potomac. Back home as sanitary
superintendent for New York, Dalton convinced commis
sioners that the city needed an ambulance corps of its own.
Each horse-drawn ambulance was stocked with "a quart
flask of brandy, two tourniquets, a half-dozen bandages, a
half-dozen small sponges, some splint material, pieces of

old blankets for padding, strips of various lengths with
buckles, and a two-ounce vial of persulphate of iron,"
according to a January 2000 History Magazine account.
The Civil War's impact on the practice of medicine was
profound, according to Civil War buff and surgeon F.W.
Blaisdell, MD, class of 1952, who's known as the father of
the modern trauma center. It set the standards for handling
mass casualties and for combining field hospitals with
large, pavilion-style hospitals in the rear. The latter became
the model for municipal hospitals built across the United
States for the next 75 years, Blaisdell wrote in The Achives
of Surgery in 1988.
Those clean, well-ventilated hospitals were part of the lega
cy of Surgeon General William Hammond, MD, promoted
at age 34 from first lieutenant to brevet brigadier general in
1862 to shake up the Union Army's backward medical
bureaucracy. Hammond laid the groundwork within Army
medicine for a culture and passion for science and
research, but his strong opinions also made him enemies.
He defied medical orthodoxy by banning calomel, a popu
lar mercury-based purgative that Hammond recognized
was toxic. Court-martialed and driven from his post in
1864, Hammond went on to postwar distinction as a neu
rologist.
It was Hammond's idea, too, to create an Army Medical

Museum and to instruct field surgeons to send back to this
fledgling museum and laboratory in Washington "speci
mens of morbid anatomy" in hopes that they might yield
insights on improving care of the Union's soldiers. After the
fighting stopped, the museum took on the task of compil
ing a definitive medical record. Published in six volumes
over 18 years, Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion became an early testament to evidence
based medicine. It was the work of many hands, but its
chief compiler was Lt. Col. Joseph Janvier Woodward, MD,
who helped conduct the autopsies of both Abraham
Lincoln and assassin John Wilkes Booth.
"It stood for many years as the finest example of military
medical reporting ever," says Adrianne Noe, PhD, director
of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, located
on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. "We
know the date of the soldier's injury and the history of all of
his care. This becomes valuable not only for historians, but
also those studying injuries in a contemporary setting."
Noe holds a position once occupied by the dauntless Maj.
Walter Reed, the scientist-physician who conducted the
famous experiments in Havana, Cuba, in 1901 confirming
that yellow fever was carried by mosquitoes.
Notwithstanding the recent scandal over poor outpatient
conditions, for nearly a century the storied hospital that
bears Reed's name has cared for generals, privates and

presidents, and its researchers have made major contribu
tions to medical science and clinical care.
It isn't quite a Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion, but the Vietnam Vascular Registry that military
surgeon Norman Rich, MD, class of 1960, established at
Walter Reed in 1966 after a year as chief of surgery at a
MASH in a jungle clearing in Vietnam's Central Highlands
has paid dividends for American servicemen and service
woman injured in subsequent wars. Rich went to Vietnam
fresh from a surgical residency under Carleton Mathewson,
MD, at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco. Mathewson, a
Stanford surgical legend, encouraged his protege to keep
careful records on his MASH patients, with an eye toward
publishing the results.
Rich became fascinated with vascular surgery, including the
repair of popliteal arteries. A tear in this artery behind the
knee once portended amputation, but military surgeons
had begun doing autologous vein transplants back in
Korea, and that remains the treatment of choice today.
More than 600 battle surgeons contributed records from
8,000 vascular wound cases to Rich's registry, which today
helps surgeons operating on soldiers who suffer similar
wounds in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"Evidence-based medicine is everything today, and this
large, unique database lets us know what happens when
vessels with certain types of injuries are repaired in certain
ways. Our younger colleagues are doing much the same
thing with the injured coming back from Afghanistan and
Iraq, and we keep comparing the two sets of experiences
to come up with the best current management of casual
ties," says Rich, the former USUHS surgery chief, who at 73
still gets to work by 5:30 a.m. Recalling Ambrose Pare's
axiom about young surgeons, Rich says,"I did more in a
short period than I ever would have done in a civilian set
ting - around the clock, seven days a week, without distrac
tions. It was a phenomenal experience."
Burris, the chief of surgery at USUHS, often uses the phrase
"new wounds for new surgeons" to explain what surgeons
are up against in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The explosions in
the wars since World War I all do the same thing to the
human body. There are only so many ways you can survive
and be badly mangled," says Burris, who spent three
months performing operations in an auxiliary hospital at the
Baghdad International Airport. Rich expressed similar senti
ments. "People who have not been in a war before are
absolutely overwhelmed by the horrors of war - but that
doesn't mean that wars or wounds are getting worse. It just
means that new people are seeing horrible wounds that
other people have seen in the past."
Notwithstanding the images Americans see daily on their
television screens, most of the 25,000 injuries that U.S. ser
vice men and women have suffered in Iraq "are mild to
moderate, just like in car wrecks or anything else," Burris
says, and half the wounded return to duty without leaving
the theater of war. While it might seem from the television
news "like everybody's lost their leg," the actual number is
fewer than 750, he says. Half those killed in battle die from
bleeding before a doctor sees them, and most of the others
suffer "massive neurological injuries that are non-surviv
able. You couldn't fix them even if they were blown up in
front of you," the trauma surgeon says. The real challenge
in this war as in every other is to save the lives of that 5
percent with massive injuries who can survive if "everybody
does everything perfectly," Burris says.

Not every wound involves fractured bones or punctured tis
sue and organs. In war, some of the gravest injuries occur
to the psyche, though the harm might not manifest itself
until long after the battle stops. Operation Desert Storm -
the 1991 Gulf War to oust Iraq from Kuwait - ended in
weeks, with an official Pentagon count of 382 deaths and
467 wounded. But among the 700,000 American troops
deployed during Operation Desert Stem, "approximately
80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms in the
years following the war, and scientists have agreed that
many veterans have unexplained illnesses," including
fatigue, pain, headaches, memory loss, rashes and dis
turbed sleep, according to a 2004 Government
Accountability Office report. There well could be a similarly
long shadow to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Armies have struggled for centuries to help troops cope
with the stress of battle. From the late 17th to the late 19th
century, "nostalgia" was the official diagnostic term for the
homesickness and despair that practically paralyzed some
soldiers. But only after Vietnam did "post-traumatic stress
syndrome" became recognized as a disorder. The
Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989 carried out a con
gressional order to create a National Center for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder to study PTSD, headquartered
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River
Junction, Vt. Its executive director, Matthew Friedman, MD,
PhD, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at
Dartmouth Medical School, says,"The PTSD field has
matured to the point where we have evidence-based treat
ments that work. We couldn't make that statement follow
ing the Vietnam War 30 years ago. But we now have very,
very effective psychosocial treatments." Friedman adds,
"We've moved way beyond thinking of PTSD as exclusively
a military issue. We've gotten into post-sexual trauma, dis
asters, tsunamis, Katrinas, terrorist issues."
In Iraq, while "we are saving many people who would have
died in previous conflicts... it also means that they are at
considerable risk to develop psychological problems along
with whatever physical sequelae they have," Friedman says.
The military now screens soldiers for mental health prob
lems before and after they are sent to theaters of war.
Friedman says military psychiatrists are uncovering and
treating problems while these soldiers are still in uniform,
rather than letting the problems fester for years, as hap
pened with many veterans of the Vietnam War.
NEXT CHALLENGE: THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM
If better understanding and treatment of stress was a med
ical legacy of Vietnam, traumatic brain injuries may be
what soldiers and the American public will remember most
from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today's improved body
armor protects a soldier's torso and limbs, but the brain
remains vulnerable. Thousands of U.S. troops who survived
explosive blasts with no visible wounds could suffer neuro
logical disorders because of internal damage, U.S
Department of Veterans Affairs neurologists say. And that is
on top of the nearly 1,900 U.S. troops who survived with
brain injuries caused by severe penetrating trauma.
Saved by heroic medical measures, these mostly young ser
vice members must for the rest of their lives deal with brain
injuries and other incapacitating wounds. The VA has
established four so-called polytrauma centers in Richmond,
Va.; Tampa, Fla.; Minneapolis; and Palo Alto. Each of the
350 patients treated to date at these centers has suffered at
least two major injuries from a list that includes traumatic
brain injury, hearing loss, amputations, fractures, burns and
visual impairments. The VA spends $31 billion a year pro
viding health care for the nation's 24 million veterans and

their families. After reforms and changes in the 19905, the
VA's coordinated system of care is often touted as a model
for the nation.
But Kenneth Kizer, MD, architect of that transformation as
VA under-secretary for health from 1994 to 1999, and a
Stanford University alumnus, is not sanguine about the
capacity of the U.S. health system to deliver the care
severely injured Iraq war veterans will need. "These trau
matic brain injuries combined with multiple amputations
and other serious injuries are creating a type of casualty the
likes of which has never been seen before, or at least cer
tainly not in the numbers now being produced by this war,"
says Kizer.
Kizer, whose Marine son-in-law is on his second tour of
duty in Iraq, says, "Places like Stanford and Palo Alto-VA
may be relatively well-prepared [for these patients] but they
are very special places. These people aren't going to live in
the VA forever. They are going to want to go home to their
communities" far from elite academic medical centers.
"How many nursing homes are prepared to deal with a
patient with multiple amputations, traumatic brain injury
and God knows what else?" he asks.
It was Abraham Lincoln, in the closing words of his Second
Inaugural, who first spoke of the government's obligation
"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for
his widow, and his orphan." Despite advances over the
years in war and in medicine, that solemn challenge
remains daunting. ■

at age 34 from first lieutenant to brevet brigadier general in
1862 to shake up the Union Army's backward medical
bureaucracy. Hammond laid the groundwork within Army
medicine for a culture and passion for science and
research, but his strong opinions also made him enemies.
He defied medical orthodoxy by banning calomel, a popu
lar mercury-based purgative that Hammond recognized
was toxic. Court-martialed and driven from his post in
1864, Hammond went on to postwar distinction as a neu
rologist.
It was Hammond's idea, too, to create an Army Medical

Museum and to instruct field surgeons to send back to this
fledgling museum and laboratory in Washington "speci
mens of morbid anatomy" in hopes that they might yield
insights on improving care of the Union's soldiers. After the
fighting stopped, the museum took on the task of compil
ing a definitive medical record. Published in six volumes
over 18 years, Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion became an early testament to evidence
based medicine. It was the work of many hands, but its
chief compiler was Lt. Col. Joseph Janvier Woodward, MD,
who helped conduct the autopsies of both Abraham
Lincoln and assassin John Wilkes Booth.
"It stood for many years as the finest example of military
medical reporting ever," says Adrianne Noe, PhD, director
of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, located
on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. "We
know the date of the soldier's injury and the history of all of
his care. This becomes valuable not only for historians, but
also those studying injuries in a contemporary setting."
Noe holds a position once occupied by the dauntless Maj.
Walter Reed, the scientist-physician who conducted the
famous experiments in Havana, Cuba, in 1901 confirming
that yellow fever was carried by mosquitoes.
Notwithstanding the recent scandal over poor outpatient
conditions, for nearly a century the storied hospital that
bears Reed's name has cared for generals, privates and

presidents, and its researchers have made major contribu
tions to medical science and clinical care.
It isn't quite a Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion, but the Vietnam Vascular Registry that military
surgeon Norman Rich, MD, class of 1960, established at
Walter Reed in 1966 after a year as chief of surgery at a
MASH in a jungle clearing in Vietnam's Central Highlands
has paid dividends for American servicemen and service
woman injured in subsequent wars. Rich went to Vietnam
fresh from a surgical residency under Carleton Mathewson,
MD, at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco. Mathewson, a
Stanford surgical legend, encouraged his protege to keep
careful records on his MASH patients, with an eye toward
publishing the results.
Rich became fascinated with vascular surgery, including the
repair of popliteal arteries. A tear in this artery behind the
knee once portended amputation, but military surgeons
had begun doing autologous vein transplants back in
Korea, and that remains the treatment of choice today.
More than 600 battle surgeons contributed records from
8,000 vascular wound cases to Rich's registry, which today
helps surgeons operating on soldiers who suffer similar
wounds in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"Evidence-based medicine is everything today, and this
large, unique database lets us know what happens when
vessels with certain types of injuries are repaired in certain
ways. Our younger colleagues are doing much the same
thing with the injured coming back from Afghanistan and
Iraq, and we keep comparing the two sets of experiences
to come up with the best current management of casual
ties," says Rich, the former USUHS surgery chief, who at 73
still gets to work by 5:30 a.m. Recalling Ambrose Pare's
axiom about young surgeons, Rich says,"I did more in a
short period than I ever would have done in a civilian set
ting - around the clock, seven days a week, without distrac
tions. It was a phenomenal experience."
Burris, the chief of surgery at USUHS, often uses the phrase
"new wounds for new surgeons" to explain what surgeons
are up against in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The explosions in
the wars since World War I all do the same thing to the
human body. There are only so many ways you can survive
and be badly mangled," says Burris, who spent three
months performing operations in an auxiliary hospital at the
Baghdad International Airport. Rich expressed similar senti
ments. "People who have not been in a war before are
absolutely overwhelmed by the horrors of war - but that
doesn't mean that wars or wounds are getting worse. It just
means that new people are seeing horrible wounds that
other people have seen in the past."
Notwithstanding the images Americans see daily on their
television screens, most of the 25,000 injuries that U.S. ser
vice men and women have suffered in Iraq "are mild to
moderate, just like in car wrecks or anything else," Burris
says, and half the wounded return to duty without leaving
the theater of war. While it might seem from the television
news "like everybody's lost their leg," the actual number is
fewer than 750, he says. Half those killed in battle die from
bleeding before a doctor sees them, and most of the others
suffer "massive neurological injuries that are non-surviv
able. You couldn't fix them even if they were blown up in
front of you," the trauma surgeon says. The real challenge
in this war as in every other is to save the lives of that 5
percent with massive injuries who can survive if "everybody
does everything perfectly," Burris says.

Not every wound involves fractured bones or punctured tis
sue and organs. In war, some of the gravest injuries occur
to the psyche, though the harm might not manifest itself
until long after the battle stops. Operation Desert Storm -
the 1991 Gulf War to oust Iraq from Kuwait - ended in
weeks, with an official Pentagon count of 382 deaths and
467 wounded. But among the 700,000 American troops
deployed during Operation Desert Stem, "approximately
80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms in the
years following the war, and scientists have agreed that
many veterans have unexplained illnesses," including
fatigue, pain, headaches, memory loss, rashes and dis
turbed sleep, according to a 2004 Government
Accountability Office report. There well could be a similarly
long shadow to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Armies have struggled for centuries to help troops cope
with the stress of battle. From the late 17th to the late 19th
century, "nostalgia" was the official diagnostic term for the
homesickness and despair that practically paralyzed some
soldiers. But only after Vietnam did "post-traumatic stress
syndrome" became recognized as a disorder. The
Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989 carried out a con
gressional order to create a National Center for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder to study PTSD, headquartered
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River
Junction, Vt. Its executive director, Matthew Friedman, MD,
PhD, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at
Dartmouth Medical School, says,"The PTSD field has
matured to the point where we have evidence-based treat
ments that work. We couldn't make that statement follow
ing the Vietnam War 30 years ago. But we now have very,
very effective psychosocial treatments." Friedman adds,
"We've moved way beyond thinking of PTSD as exclusively
a military issue. We've gotten into post-sexual trauma, dis
asters, tsunamis, Katrinas, terrorist issues."
In Iraq, while "we are saving many people who would have
died in previous conflicts... it also means that they are at
considerable risk to develop psychological problems along
with whatever physical sequelae they have," Friedman says.
The military now screens soldiers for mental health prob
lems before and after they are sent to theaters of war.
Friedman says military psychiatrists are uncovering and
treating problems while these soldiers are still in uniform,
rather than letting the problems fester for years, as hap
pened with many veterans of the Vietnam War.
NEXT CHALLENGE: THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM
If better understanding and treatment of stress was a med
ical legacy of Vietnam, traumatic brain injuries may be
what soldiers and the American public will remember most
from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today's improved body
armor protects a soldier's torso and limbs, but the brain
remains vulnerable. Thousands of U.S. troops who survived
explosive blasts with no visible wounds could suffer neuro
logical disorders because of internal damage, U.S
Department of Veterans Affairs neurologists say. And that is
on top of the nearly 1,900 U.S. troops who survived with
brain injuries caused by severe penetrating trauma.
Saved by heroic medical measures, these mostly young ser
vice members must for the rest of their lives deal with brain
injuries and other incapacitating wounds. The VA has
established four so-called polytrauma centers in Richmond,
Va.; Tampa, Fla.; Minneapolis; and Palo Alto. Each of the
350 patients treated to date at these centers has suffered at
least two major injuries from a list that includes traumatic
brain injury, hearing loss, amputations, fractures, burns and
visual impairments. The VA spends $31 billion a year pro
viding health care for the nation's 24 million veterans and

their families. After reforms and changes in the 19905, the
VA's coordinated system of care is often touted as a model
for the nation.
But Kenneth Kizer, MD, architect of that transformation as
VA under-secretary for health from 1994 to 1999, and a
Stanford University alumnus, is not sanguine about the
capacity of the U.S. health system to deliver the care
severely injured Iraq war veterans will need. "These trau
matic brain injuries combined with multiple amputations
and other serious injuries are creating a type of casualty the
likes of which has never been seen before, or at least cer
tainly not in the numbers now being produced by this war,"
says Kizer.
Kizer, whose Marine son-in-law is on his second tour of
duty in Iraq, says, "Places like Stanford and Palo Alto-VA
may be relatively well-prepared [for these patients] but they
are very special places. These people aren't going to live in
the VA forever. They are going to want to go home to their
communities" far from elite academic medical centers.
"How many nursing homes are prepared to deal with a
patient with multiple amputations, traumatic brain injury
and God knows what else?" he asks.
It was Abraham Lincoln, in the closing words of his Second
Inaugural, who first spoke of the government's obligation
"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for
his widow, and his orphan." Despite advances over the
years in war and in medicine, that solemn challenge
remains daunting. ■

From Thermopylae to Baghdad, from the Gallic wars to
Vietnam, war has proved an exacting but efficient school
master for physicians. Hippocrates wrote, "He who would
become a surgeon should join an army and follow it."
Second-century Greek physician Galen honed his skills not
only in the sanctuary of Aesclepius, god of healing, but as
physician to the gladiators of Pergamon. The American
teenager pried from a twisted wreck on a Friday night and
sped to a suburban hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the
horse-drawn wagons (known as "flying ambulances") that
Dominique Jean Larrey, MD, invented to carry injured sol
diers in Napoleon's army and the professional ambulance
corps that Jonathan Letterman, MD, instituted for the Army
of the Potomac after the disastrous first Battle of Bull Run,
where the wounded were left on the field when Union
troops fled back to Washington.
Gunshot victims wheeled into any big city trauma center
benefit from techniques that a generation of EMTs and sur
geons first learned repairing combat wounds. "Most of the
emergency medical response doctrine in practice in the
United States today evolved from medical experiences in
the jungles of Southeast Asia in the late 19605," says Lt.
Gen. Kevin Kiley, MD, surgeon general of the U.S. Army.
For all the destruction and chaos it wreaks, war spurs some
medical advances. Historically, trauma surgery, emergency
care and infectious disease treatments leap the furthest
ahead. Military medicine stretches back to antiquity.
Augustus Caesar formed a medical corps for his legions.
Roman surgeons tied ligatures and clamped arteries to
control bleeding, and the vinegar they poured into wounds
acted as an antiseptic. Galen, court physician to Marcus
Aurelius in Rome, performed bold operations and gained
an understanding of the human anatomy that was unsur
passed well into the second millennium. Ambrose Pare, the
16th-century French physician who figured out that wounds
healed faster if you didn't pour boiling oil onto them,
observed that the only people who gain from warfare are
young surgeons. French Army surgeon Jean Louis Petit's
invention of the screw tourniquet in 1718 made it possible
to amputate legs above the knee without bleeding the
patient to death. His device, which cut the flow from the
femoral artery, would be in every military surgeon's kit until
well after the U.S. Civil War. Even with such equipment,
until anesthetics came along, surgeons' reputations rested
principally on the speed with which they could saw off
limbs.
ADVANCES REAL AND IMAGINED
While wars provide ample opportunities for surgeons to
hone their skills, some historians believe their contributions
to the medical arts are modest if not minimal. F.H.

Garrison, MD, in An Introduction to the History of Medicine
(1929), wrote about World War I, "Viewed after the lapse
of a decade, the medical innovations and inventions of the
war period seem clever, respectable, but not particularly
brilliant." More recently, British sociologist Roger Cooter,
PhD, made the argument that, "For the most part, war has
accelerated research into old medical problems of military
importance, the bulk of which are highly specific to that
context and of little value outside it." During most modern
wars, Cooter says, civilians' health needs have taken a
back seat to the medical needs of the military.
Throughout most of recorded history, disease, not arrows,
bullets or bombs, was the scourge of armies. Generals
have long understood the importance of sanitation to the
health of their troops. The French Army instituted physical
exams for new soldiers in the early 18th century; soon
recruits and conscripts were being poked and measured in
all of Europe's armies. At Valley Forge in 1 777, Gen.
George Washington ordered the Continental Army inocu
lated against smallpox. "Should the disorder infect the
Army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence,
we should have more to dread from it than from the sword
of the enemy," wrote Washington, whose visage bore the
scars of a bout with smallpox at age 19.
Still, among the 70,000 colonials who died during the
Revolutionary War, nine were felled by disease for every
one who died at the hands of the redcoats. Among the
31,000 British fatalities, just 4,000 were killed in action. In
the Civil War, three-fifths of the 304,369 Union dead were
victims of disease, not casualties of battle. It took until the
20th century for the arts of medicine and warfare to
advance to the point where more combatants died from
battle wounds than from diseases. The United States was a
late entrant to World War I, but there were 53,402
Americans killed in action and 63,114 dead from other
causes. By World War 11, the Pentagon counted 291,557
deaths in action and 113,842 from other causes.
Over the centuries, as armies moved away from frontal
combat and learned to unleash deadlier force across
greater distances, war became less lethal for combatants
and more lethal for civilians. More than 6 million of the 15
million lives lost in World War I were civilians; in World War
11, the first global conflict, at least 35 million civilians per
ished - including more than 200,000 in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki from atomic bombs, and 6 million European
Jews by genocide - dwarfing the 20 million military fatali
ties.
Whatever the historians' verdicts, wars are popularly associ
ated with medical advances in the public mind, such as the
blood banks that Oswald Hope Robertson, MD, created for
the Army Medical Corps in France in 1918, and penicillin,
the antibiotic that came to prominence and became widely
available during World War 11. But Dale Smith, PhD, who
chairs the medical history department at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences, or USUHS, in

Bethesda, Md., says that in both instances, the real break
throughs occurred in laboratories in the decade before the
world wars.
Still, when the United States entered World War I, manuals
for battle surgeons contained illustrations showing them
how to sew a donor's radial artery to the basilic vein of the
wounded comrade for direct transfusion. "By the end of the
war, those pages are gone and those same books show
how to keep blood in storage boxes protected by ice and
sawdust, and how to treat the blood to transfuse it safely,"
says Col. David Burris, MD, chief of the Norman M. Rich
Department of Surgery at USUHS. While Sir Alexander
Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin took place in
1928, the antibiotic remained in short supply until the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry performed a second miracle in
gearing up industrial production of the scarce antibiotic
during World War 11.
EMERGENa MEDICINE'S CRUCIBLE
The Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital, or MASH, not only
saved lives in Korea, but entered American folklore thanks
to Robert Altman's 1970 black comedy, M*A*S*H, and the
hit television series. The idea for MASH, however, originat
ed in World War II with a Boston chest surgeon, Col.
Edward "Pete" Churchill, MD, who in 1943 moved his best
surgeons forward into rudimentary, auxiliary field hospitals
during the invasion of Italy. A young Michael Deßakey, MD,
serving on the surgeon general's brain trust in Washington,
later helped institutionalize the practice.
Vietnam gave new meaning to the term "flying ambu
lances" as daring Huey helicopter pilots ferried the wound
ed out of jungle battle zones. Even "dust off" - the military
call sign for those evacuations - entered the American lexi
con. Indeed, President George W. Bush held a ceremony in
the White House in late February to present the
Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Bruce Crandall,
one of those Huey pilots, for darting in and out of a raging
firefight in Vietnam's la Drang Valley 14 times on a single
day in November 1965 to rescue and resupply a 1 st
Cavalry battalion. His wingman, Ed Freeman, received the
same honor in 2001.
Such feats not only proved the pilots' mettle, but demon
strated what a lifesaver the sturdy little Huey - the Bell UH-1
Iroquois - could be. That lesson was not lost on hospital
administrators and trauma surgeons back home. The
Pentagon in 1968 lent helicopters for a pilot program to
rescue accident victims from highway crashes in San
Antonio and Dallas, and Baltimore trauma surgeon Adams
Cowley, MD, convinced Maryland authorities to create the
first statewide transport system in the early 19705. Today,
no self-respecting trauma hospital is complete without a
helipad.
The crucible of conflict whets appetites for more and better
medicine. Cooter, the British sociologist, wrote in the
Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine
(1993): "Wars such as the American Civil and the First
World War exposed large numbers of men to modern
medicine and dentistry for the first time: one by one,
recruits were stripped for examination, measured, weighed,
tapped, and interrogated. Along with the soldiers and
sailors whose lives were spared by the skills of military sur
geons, such men may have returned home from war with
higher demands for and expectations of orthodox medicine
than when they left." Smith, the historian of military medi
cine, notes the same phenomenon occurred after World
War 11, in which 30 percent of the nation's physicians had
been pressed into service to attend to the needs of the 8
percent of the population under arms.
Perhaps war's greatest contribution to medicine is the
chance to run public health experiments on a grand scale
under exigent circumstances. Letterman's Civil War ambu
lance corps was a dry run for today's emergency medical
services. Indeed, the municipal ambulance system that New
York's Bellevue Hospital launched in 1869 was modeled
on the medical transports that Edward Dalton, MD, orga
nized for the Army of the Potomac. Back home as sanitary
superintendent for New York, Dalton convinced commis
sioners that the city needed an ambulance corps of its own.
Each horse-drawn ambulance was stocked with "a quart
flask of brandy, two tourniquets, a half-dozen bandages, a
half-dozen small sponges, some splint material, pieces of

old blankets for padding, strips of various lengths with
buckles, and a two-ounce vial of persulphate of iron,"
according to a January 2000 History Magazine account.
The Civil War's impact on the practice of medicine was
profound, according to Civil War buff and surgeon F.W.
Blaisdell, MD, class of 1952, who's known as the father of
the modern trauma center. It set the standards for handling
mass casualties and for combining field hospitals with
large, pavilion-style hospitals in the rear. The latter became
the model for municipal hospitals built across the United
States for the next 75 years, Blaisdell wrote in The Achives
of Surgery in 1988.
Those clean, well-ventilated hospitals were part of the lega
cy of Surgeon General William Hammond, MD, promoted
at age 34 from first lieutenant to brevet brigadier general in
1862 to shake up the Union Army's backward medical
bureaucracy. Hammond laid the groundwork within Army

sped to a suburban hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the
horse-drawn wagons (known as "flying ambulances") that
Dominique Jean Larrey, MD, invented to carry injured sol
diers in Napoleon's army and the professional ambulance
corps that Jonathan Letterman, MD, instituted for the Army
of the Potomac after the disastrous first Battle of Bull Run,
where the wounded were left on the field when Union
troops fled back to Washington.
Gunshot victims wheeled into any big city trauma center
benefit from techniques that a generation of EMTs and sur
geons first learned repairing combat wounds. "Most of the
emergency medical response doctrine in practice in the
United States today evolved from medical experiences in
the jungles of Southeast Asia in the late 19605," says Lt.
Gen. Kevin Kiley, MD, surgeon general of the U.S. Army.
For all the destruction and chaos it wreaks, war spurs some
medical advances. Historically, trauma surgery, emergency
care and infectious disease treatments leap the furthest
ahead. Military medicine stretches back to antiquity.
Augustus Caesar formed a medical corps for his legions.
Roman surgeons tied ligatures and clamped arteries to
control bleeding, and the vinegar they poured into wounds
acted as an antiseptic. Galen, court physician to Marcus
Aurelius in Rome, performed bold operations and gained
an understanding of the human anatomy that was unsur
passed well into the second millennium. Ambrose Pare, the
16th-century French physician who figured out that wounds
healed faster if you didn't pour boiling oil onto them,
observed that the only people who gain from warfare are
young surgeons. French Army surgeon Jean Louis Petit's
invention of the screw tourniquet in 1718 made it possible
to amputate legs above the knee without bleeding the
patient to death. His device, which cut the flow from the
femoral artery, would be in every military surgeon's kit until
well after the U.S. Civil War. Even with such equipment,
until anesthetics came along, surgeons' reputations rested
principally on the speed with which they could saw off
limbs.
ADVANCES REAL AND IMAGINED
While wars provide ample opportunities for surgeons to
hone their skills, some historians believe their contributions
to the medical arts are modest if not minimal. F.H.

Garrison, MD, in An Introduction to the History of Medicine
(1929), wrote about World War I, "Viewed after the lapse
of a decade, the medical innovations and inventions of the
war period seem clever, respectable, but not particularly
brilliant." More recently, British sociologist Roger Cooter,
PhD, made the argument that, "For the most part, war has
accelerated research into old medical problems of military
importance, the bulk of which are highly specific to that
context and of little value outside it." During most modern
wars, Cooter says, civilians' health needs have taken a
back seat to the medical needs of the military.
Throughout most of recorded history, disease, not arrows,
bullets or bombs, was the scourge of armies. Generals
have long understood the importance of sanitation to the
health of their troops. The French Army instituted physical
exams for new soldiers in the early 18th century; soon
recruits and conscripts were being poked and measured in
all of Europe's armies. At Valley Forge in 1 777, Gen.
George Washington ordered the Continental Army inocu
lated against smallpox. "Should the disorder infect the
Army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence,
we should have more to dread from it than from the sword
of the enemy," wrote Washington, whose visage bore the
scars of a bout with smallpox at age 19.
Still, among the 70,000 colonials who died during the
Revolutionary War, nine were felled by disease for every
one who died at the hands of the redcoats. Among the
31,000 British fatalities, just 4,000 were killed in action. In
the Civil War, three-fifths of the 304,369 Union dead were
victims of disease, not casualties of battle. It took until the
20th century for the arts of medicine and warfare to
advance to the point where more combatants died from
battle wounds than from diseases. The United States was a
late entrant to World War I, but there were 53,402
Americans killed in action and 63,114 dead from other
causes. By World War 11, the Pentagon counted 291,557
deaths in action and 113,842 from other causes.
Over the centuries, as armies moved away from frontal
combat and learned to unleash deadlier force across
greater distances, war became less lethal for combatants
and more lethal for civilians. More than 6 million of the 15
million lives lost in World War I were civilians; in World War
11, the first global conflict, at least 35 million civilians per
ished - including more than 200,000 in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki from atomic bombs, and 6 million European
Jews by genocide - dwarfing the 20 million military fatali
ties.
Whatever the historians' verdicts, wars are popularly associ
ated with medical advances in the public mind, such as the
blood banks that Oswald Hope Robertson, MD, created for
the Army Medical Corps in France in 1918, and penicillin,
the antibiotic that came to prominence and became widely
available during World War 11. But Dale Smith, PhD, who
chairs the medical history department at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences, or USUHS, in

Bethesda, Md., says that in both instances, the real break
throughs occurred in laboratories in the decade before the
world wars.
Still, when the United States entered World War I, manuals
for battle surgeons contained illustrations showing them
how to sew a donor's radial artery to the basilic vein of the
wounded comrade for direct transfusion. "By the end of the
war, those pages are gone and those same books show
how to keep blood in storage boxes protected by ice and
sawdust, and how to treat the blood to transfuse it safely,"
says Col. David Burris, MD, chief of the Norman M. Rich
Department of Surgery at USUHS. While Sir Alexander
Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin took place in
1928, the antibiotic remained in short supply until the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry performed a second miracle in
gearing up industrial production of the scarce antibiotic
during World War 11.
EMERGENa MEDICINE'S CRUCIBLE
The Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital, or MASH, not only
saved lives in Korea, but entered American folklore thanks
to Robert Altman's 1970 black comedy, M*A*S*H, and the
hit television series. The idea for MASH, however, originat
ed in World War II with a Boston chest surgeon, Col.
Edward "Pete" Churchill, MD, who in 1943 moved his best
surgeons forward into rudimentary, auxiliary field hospitals
during the invasion of Italy. A young Michael Deßakey, MD,
serving on the surgeon general's brain trust in Washington,
later helped institutionalize the practice.
Vietnam gave new meaning to the term "flying ambu
lances" as daring Huey helicopter pilots ferried the wound
ed out of jungle battle zones. Even "dust off" - the military
call sign for those evacuations - entered the American lexi
con. Indeed, President George W. Bush held a ceremony in
the White House in late February to present the
Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Bruce Crandall,
one of those Huey pilots, for darting in and out of a raging
firefight in Vietnam's la Drang Valley 14 times on a single
day in November 1965 to rescue and resupply a 1 st
Cavalry battalion. His wingman, Ed Freeman, received the
same honor in 2001.
Such feats not only proved the pilots' mettle, but demon
strated what a lifesaver the sturdy little Huey - the Bell UH-1
Iroquois - could be. That lesson was not lost on hospital
administrators and trauma surgeons back home. The
Pentagon in 1968 lent helicopters for a pilot program to
rescue accident victims from highway crashes in San
Antonio and Dallas, and Baltimore trauma surgeon Adams
Cowley, MD, convinced Maryland authorities to create the
first statewide transport system in the early 19705. Today,
no self-respecting trauma hospital is complete without a
helipad.
The crucible of conflict whets appetites for more and better
medicine. Cooter, the British sociologist, wrote in the
Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine
(1993): "Wars such as the American Civil and the First
World War exposed large numbers of men to modern
medicine and dentistry for the first time: one by one,
recruits were stripped for examination, measured, weighed,
tapped, and interrogated. Along with the soldiers and
sailors whose lives were spared by the skills of military sur
geons, such men may have returned home from war with
higher demands for and expectations of orthodox medicine
than when they left." Smith, the historian of military medi
cine, notes the same phenomenon occurred after World
War 11, in which 30 percent of the nation's physicians had
been pressed into service to attend to the needs of the 8
percent of the population under arms.
Perhaps war's greatest contribution to medicine is the
chance to run public health experiments on a grand scale
under exigent circumstances. Letterman's Civil War ambu
lance corps was a dry run for today's emergency medical
services. Indeed, the municipal ambulance system that New
York's Bellevue Hospital launched in 1869 was modeled
on the medical transports that Edward Dalton, MD, orga
nized for the Army of the Potomac. Back home as sanitary
superintendent for New York, Dalton convinced commis
sioners that the city needed an ambulance corps of its own.
Each horse-drawn ambulance was stocked with "a quart
flask of brandy, two tourniquets, a half-dozen bandages, a
half-dozen small sponges, some splint material, pieces of

old blankets for padding, strips of various lengths with
buckles, and a two-ounce vial of persulphate of iron,"
according to a January 2000 History Magazine account.
The Civil War's impact on the practice of medicine was
profound, according to Civil War buff and surgeon F.W.
Blaisdell, MD, class of 1952, who's known as the father of
the modern trauma center. It set the standards for handling
mass casualties and for combining field hospitals with
large, pavilion-style hospitals in the rear. The latter became
the model for municipal hospitals built across the United
States for the next 75 years, Blaisdell wrote in The Achives
of Surgery in 1988.
Those clean, well-ventilated hospitals were part of the lega
cy of Surgeon General William Hammond, MD, promoted
at age 34 from first lieutenant to brevet brigadier general in
1862 to shake up the Union Army's backward medical
bureaucracy. Hammond laid the groundwork within Army
medicine for a culture and passion for science and
research, but his strong opinions also made him enemies.
He defied medical orthodoxy by banning calomel, a popu
lar mercury-based purgative that Hammond recognized
was toxic. Court-martialed and driven from his post in
1864, Hammond went on to postwar distinction as a neu
rologist.
It was Hammond's idea, too, to create an Army Medical

Museum and to instruct field surgeons to send back to this
fledgling museum and laboratory in Washington "speci
mens of morbid anatomy" in hopes that they might yield
insights on improving care of the Union's soldiers. After the
fighting stopped, the museum took on the task of compil
ing a definitive medical record. Published in six volumes
over 18 years, Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion became an early testament to evidence
based medicine. It was the work of many hands, but its
chief compiler was Lt. Col. Joseph Janvier Woodward, MD,
who helped conduct the autopsies of both Abraham
Lincoln and assassin John Wilkes Booth.
"It stood for many years as the finest example of military
medical reporting ever," says Adrianne Noe, PhD, director
of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, located
on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. "We
know the date of the soldier's injury and the history of all of
his care. This becomes valuable not only for historians, but
also those studying injuries in a contemporary setting."
Noe holds a position once occupied by the dauntless Maj.
Walter Reed, the scientist-physician who conducted the
famous experiments in Havana, Cuba, in 1901 confirming
that yellow fever was carried by mosquitoes.
Notwithstanding the recent scandal over poor outpatient
conditions, for nearly a century the storied hospital that
bears Reed's name has cared for generals, privates and

presidents, and its researchers have made major contribu
tions to medical science and clinical care.
It isn't quite a Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion, but the Vietnam Vascular Registry that military
surgeon Norman Rich, MD, class of 1960, established at
Walter Reed in 1966 after a year as chief of surgery at a
MASH in a jungle clearing in Vietnam's Central Highlands
has paid dividends for American servicemen and service
woman injured in subsequent wars. Rich went to Vietnam
fresh from a surgical residency under Carleton Mathewson,
MD, at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco. Mathewson, a
Stanford surgical legend, encouraged his protege to keep
careful records on his MASH patients, with an eye toward
publishing the results.
Rich became fascinated with vascular surgery, including the
repair of popliteal arteries. A tear in this artery behind the
knee once portended amputation, but military surgeons
had begun doing autologous vein transplants back in
Korea, and that remains the treatment of choice today.
More than 600 battle surgeons contributed records from
8,000 vascular wound cases to Rich's registry, which today
helps surgeons operating on soldiers who suffer similar
wounds in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"Evidence-based medicine is everything today, and this
large, unique database lets us know what happens when
vessels with certain types of injuries are repaired in certain
ways. Our younger colleagues are doing much the same
thing with the injured coming back from Afghanistan and
Iraq, and we keep comparing the two sets of experiences
to come up with the best current management of casual
ties," says Rich, the former USUHS surgery chief, who at 73
still gets to work by 5:30 a.m. Recalling Ambrose Pare's
axiom about young surgeons, Rich says,"I did more in a
short period than I ever would have done in a civilian set
ting - around the clock, seven days a week, without distrac
tions. It was a phenomenal experience."
Burris, the chief of surgery at USUHS, often uses the phrase
"new wounds for new surgeons" to explain what surgeons
are up against in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The explosions in
the wars since World War I all do the same thing to the
human body. There are only so many ways you can survive
and be badly mangled," says Burris, who spent three
months performing operations in an auxiliary hospital at the
Baghdad International Airport. Rich expressed similar senti
ments. "People who have not been in a war before are
absolutely overwhelmed by the horrors of war - but that
doesn't mean that wars or wounds are getting worse. It just
means that new people are seeing horrible wounds that
other people have seen in the past."
Notwithstanding the images Americans see daily on their
television screens, most of the 25,000 injuries that U.S. ser
vice men and women have suffered in Iraq "are mild to
moderate, just like in car wrecks or anything else," Burris
says, and half the wounded return to duty without leaving
the theater of war. While it might seem from the television
news "like everybody's lost their leg," the actual number is
fewer than 750, he says. Half those killed in battle die from
bleeding before a doctor sees them, and most of the others
suffer "massive neurological injuries that are non-surviv
able. You couldn't fix them even if they were blown up in
front of you," the trauma surgeon says. The real challenge
in this war as in every other is to save the lives of that 5
percent with massive injuries who can survive if "everybody
does everything perfectly," Burris says.

Not every wound involves fractured bones or punctured tis
sue and organs. In war, some of the gravest injuries occur
to the psyche, though the harm might not manifest itself
until long after the battle stops. Operation Desert Storm -
the 1991 Gulf War to oust Iraq from Kuwait - ended in
weeks, with an official Pentagon count of 382 deaths and
467 wounded. But among the 700,000 American troops
deployed during Operation Desert Stem, "approximately
80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms in the
years following the war, and scientists have agreed that
many veterans have unexplained illnesses," including
fatigue, pain, headaches, memory loss, rashes and dis
turbed sleep, according to a 2004 Government
Accountability Office report. There well could be a similarly
long shadow to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Armies have struggled for centuries to help troops cope
with the stress of battle. From the late 17th to the late 19th
century, "nostalgia" was the official diagnostic term for the
homesickness and despair that practically paralyzed some
soldiers. But only after Vietnam did "post-traumatic stress
syndrome" became recognized as a disorder. The
Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989 carried out a con
gressional order to create a National Center for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder to study PTSD, headquartered
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River
Junction, Vt. Its executive director, Matthew Friedman, MD,
PhD, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at
Dartmouth Medical School, says,"The PTSD field has
matured to the point where we have evidence-based treat
ments that work. We couldn't make that statement follow
ing the Vietnam War 30 years ago. But we now have very,
very effective psychosocial treatments." Friedman adds,
"We've moved way beyond thinking of PTSD as exclusively
a military issue. We've gotten into post-sexual trauma, dis
asters, tsunamis, Katrinas, terrorist issues."
In Iraq, while "we are saving many people who would have
died in previous conflicts... it also means that they are at
considerable risk to develop psychological problems along
with whatever physical sequelae they have," Friedman says.
The military now screens soldiers for mental health prob
lems before and after they are sent to theaters of war.
Friedman says military psychiatrists are uncovering and
treating problems while these soldiers are still in uniform,
rather than letting the problems fester for years, as hap
pened with many veterans of the Vietnam War.
NEXT CHALLENGE: THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM
If better understanding and treatment of stress was a med
ical legacy of Vietnam, traumatic brain injuries may be
what soldiers and the American public will remember most
from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today's improved body
armor protects a soldier's torso and limbs, but the brain
remains vulnerable. Thousands of U.S. troops who survived
explosive blasts with no visible wounds could suffer neuro
logical disorders because of internal damage, U.S
Department of Veterans Affairs neurologists say. And that is
on top of the nearly 1,900 U.S. troops who survived with
brain injuries caused by severe penetrating trauma.
Saved by heroic medical measures, these mostly young ser
vice members must for the rest of their lives deal with brain
injuries and other incapacitating wounds. The VA has
established four so-called polytrauma centers in Richmond,
Va.; Tampa, Fla.; Minneapolis; and Palo Alto. Each of the
350 patients treated to date at these centers has suffered at
least two major injuries from a list that includes traumatic
brain injury, hearing loss, amputations, fractures, burns and
visual impairments. The VA spends $31 billion a year pro
viding health care for the nation's 24 million veterans and

their families. After reforms and changes in the 19905, the
VA's coordinated system of care is often touted as a model
for the nation.
But Kenneth Kizer, MD, architect of that transformation as
VA under-secretary for health from 1994 to 1999, and a
Stanford University alumnus, is not sanguine about the
capacity of the U.S. health system to deliver the care
severely injured Iraq war veterans will need. "These trau
matic brain injuries combined with multiple amputations
and other serious injuries are creating a type of casualty the
likes of which has never been seen before, or at least cer
tainly not in the numbers now being produced by this war,"
says Kizer.
Kizer, whose Marine son-in-law is on his second tour of
duty in Iraq, says, "Places like Stanford and Palo Alto-VA
may be relatively well-prepared [for these patients] but they
are very special places. These people aren't going to live in
the VA forever. They are going to want to go home to their
communities" far from elite academic medical centers.
"How many nursing homes are prepared to deal with a
patient with multiple amputations, traumatic brain injury
and God knows what else?" he asks.
It was Abraham Lincoln, in the closing words of his Second
Inaugural, who first spoke of the government's obligation
"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for
his widow, and his orphan." Despite advances over the
years in war and in medicine, that solemn challenge
remains daunting. ■

It was Hammond's idea, too, to create an Army Medical

Museum and to instruct field surgeons to send back to this
fledgling museum and laboratory in Washington "speci
mens of morbid anatomy" in hopes that they might yield
insights on improving care of the Union's soldiers. After the
fighting stopped, the museum took on the task of compil
ing a definitive medical record. Published in six volumes
over 18 years, Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion became an early testament to evidence
based medicine. It was the work of many hands, but its
chief compiler was Lt. Col. Joseph Janvier Woodward, MD,
who helped conduct the autopsies of both Abraham
Lincoln and assassin John Wilkes Booth.
"It stood for many years as the finest example of military
medical reporting ever," says Adrianne Noe, PhD, director
of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, located
on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. "We
know the date of the soldier's injury and the history of all of
his care. This becomes valuable not only for historians, but
also those studying injuries in a contemporary setting."
Noe holds a position once occupied by the dauntless Maj.
Walter Reed, the scientist-physician who conducted the
famous experiments in Havana, Cuba, in 1901 confirming
that yellow fever was carried by mosquitoes.
Notwithstanding the recent scandal over poor outpatient
conditions, for nearly a century the storied hospital that
bears Reed's name has cared for generals, privates and

presidents, and its researchers have made major contribu
tions to medical science and clinical care.
It isn't quite a Medical and Surgical History of the War of
the Rebellion, but the Vietnam Vascular Registry that military
surgeon Norman Rich, MD, class of 1960, established at
Walter Reed in 1966 after a year as chief of surgery at a
MASH in a jungle clearing in Vietnam's Central Highlands
has paid dividends for American servicemen and service
woman injured in subsequent wars. Rich went to Vietnam
fresh from a surgical residency under Carleton Mathewson,
MD, at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco. Mathewson, a
Stanford surgical legend, encouraged his protege to keep
careful records on his MASH patients, with an eye toward
publishing the results.
Rich became fascinated with vascular surgery, including the
repair of popliteal arteries. A tear in this artery behind the
knee once portended amputation, but military surgeons
had begun doing autologous vein transplants back in
Korea, and that remains the treatment of choice today.
More than 600 battle surgeons contributed records from
8,000 vascular wound cases to Rich's registry, which today
helps surgeons operating on soldiers who suffer similar
wounds in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"Evidence-based medicine is everything today, and this
large, unique database lets us know what happens when
vessels with certain types of injuries are repaired in certain
ways. Our younger colleagues are doing much the same
thing with the injured coming back from Afghanistan and
Iraq, and we keep comparing the two sets of experiences
to come up with the best current management of casual
ties," says Rich, the former USUHS surgery chief, who at 73
still gets to work by 5:30 a.m. Recalling Ambrose Pare's
axiom about young surgeons, Rich says,"I did more in a
short period than I ever would have done in a civilian set
ting - around the clock, seven days a week, without distrac
tions. It was a phenomenal experience."
Burris, the chief of surgery at USUHS, often uses the phrase
"new wounds for new surgeons" to explain what surgeons
are up against in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The explosions in
the wars since World War I all do the same thing to the
human body. There are only so many ways you can survive
and be badly mangled," says Burris, who spent three
months performing operations in an auxiliary hospital at the
Baghdad International Airport. Rich expressed similar senti
ments. "People who have not been in a war before are
absolutely overwhelmed by the horrors of war - but that
doesn't mean that wars or wounds are getting worse. It just
means that new people are seeing horrible wounds that
other people have seen in the past."
Notwithstanding the images Americans see daily on their
television screens, most of the 25,000 injuries that U.S. ser
vice men and women have suffered in Iraq "are mild to
moderate, just like in car wrecks or anything else," Burris
says, and half the wounded return to duty without leaving
the theater of war. While it might seem from the television
news "like everybody's lost their leg," the actual number is
fewer than 750, he says. Half those killed in battle die from
bleeding before a doctor sees them, and most of the others
suffer "massive neurological injuries that are non-surviv
able. You couldn't fix them even if they were blown up in
front of you," the trauma surgeon says. The real challenge
in this war as in every other is to save the lives of that 5
percent with massive injuries who can survive if "everybody
does everything perfectly," Burris says.

Not every wound involves fractured bones or punctured tis
sue and organs. In war, some of the gravest injuries occur
to the psyche, though the harm might not manifest itself
until long after the battle stops. Operation Desert Storm -
the 1991 Gulf War to oust Iraq from Kuwait - ended in
weeks, with an official Pentagon count of 382 deaths and
467 wounded. But among the 700,000 American troops
deployed during Operation Desert Stem, "approximately
80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms in the
years following the war, and scientists have agreed that
many veterans have unexplained illnesses," including
fatigue, pain, headaches, memory loss, rashes and dis
turbed sleep, according to a 2004 Government
Accountability Office report. There well could be a similarly
long shadow to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Armies have struggled for centuries to help troops cope
with the stress of battle. From the late 17th to the late 19th
century, "nostalgia" was the official diagnostic term for the
homesickness and despair that practically paralyzed some
soldiers. But only after Vietnam did "post-traumatic stress
syndrome" became recognized as a disorder. The
Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989 carried out a con
gressional order to create a National Center for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder to study PTSD, headquartered
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River
Junction, Vt. Its executive director, Matthew Friedman, MD,
PhD, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at
Dartmouth Medical School, says,"The PTSD field has
matured to the point where we have evidence-based treat
ments that work. We couldn't make that statement follow
ing the Vietnam War 30 years ago. But we now have very,
very effective psychosocial treatments." Friedman adds,
"We've moved way beyond thinking of PTSD as exclusively
a military issue. We've gotten into post-sexual trauma, dis
asters, tsunamis, Katrinas, terrorist issues."
In Iraq, while "we are saving many people who would have
died in previous conflicts... it also means that they are at
considerable risk to develop psychological problems along
with whatever physical sequelae they have," Friedman says.
The military now screens soldiers for mental health prob
lems before and after they are sent to theaters of war.
Friedman says military psychiatrists are uncovering and
treating problems while these soldiers are still in uniform,
rather than letting the problems fester for years, as hap
pened with many veterans of the Vietnam War.
NEXT CHALLENGE: THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM
If better understanding and treatment of stress was a med
ical legacy of Vietnam, traumatic brain injuries may be
what soldiers and the American public will remember most
from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today's improved body
armor protects a soldier's torso and limbs, but the brain
remains vulnerable. Thousands of U.S. troops who survived
explosive blasts with no visible wounds could suffer neuro
logical disorders because of internal damage, U.S
Department of Veterans Affairs neurologists say. And that is
on top of the nearly 1,900 U.S. troops who survived with
brain injuries caused by severe penetrating trauma.
Saved by heroic medical measures, these mostly young ser
vice members must for the rest of their lives deal with brain
injuries and other incapacitating wounds. The VA has
established four so-called polytrauma centers in Richmond,
Va.; Tampa, Fla.; Minneapolis; and Palo Alto. Each of the
350 patients treated to date at these centers has suffered at
least two major injuries from a list that includes traumatic
brain injury, hearing loss, amputations, fractures, burns and
visual impairments. The VA spends $31 billion a year pro
viding health care for the nation's 24 million veterans and

their families. After reforms and changes in the 19905, the
VA's coordinated system of care is often touted as a model
for the nation.
But Kenneth Kizer, MD, architect of that transformation as
VA under-secretary for health from 1994 to 1999, and a
Stanford University alumnus, is not sanguine about the
capacity of the U.S. health system to deliver the care
severely injured Iraq war veterans will need. "These trau
matic brain injuries combined with multiple amputations
and other serious injuries are creating a type of casualty the
likes of which has never been seen before, or at least cer
tainly not in the numbers now being produced by this war,"
says Kizer.
Kizer, whose Marine son-in-law is on his second tour of
duty in Iraq, says, "Places like Stanford and Palo Alto-VA
may be relatively well-prepared [for these patients] but they
are very special places. These people aren't going to live in
the VA forever. They are going to want to go home to their
communities" far from elite academic medical centers.
"How many nursing homes are prepared to deal with a
patient with multiple amputations, traumatic brain injury
and God knows what else?" he asks.
It was Abraham Lincoln, in the closing words of his Second
Inaugural, who first spoke of the government's obligation
"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for
his widow, and his orphan." Despite advances over the
years in war and in medicine, that solemn challenge
remains daunting. ■
Reprinted from Stanford Medicine Magazine with permis
sion from the Office of Communication and Public Affairs
From Thermopylae to Baghdad, from the Gallic wars to
Vietnam, war has proved an exacting but efficient school
master for physicians. Hippocrates wrote, "He who would
become a surgeon should join an army and follow it."
Second-century Greek physician Galen honed his skills not
only in the sanctuary of Aesclepius, god of healing, but as
physician to the gladiators of Pergamon. The American
teenager pried from a twisted wreck on a Friday night and
sped to a suburban hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the
horse-drawn wagons (known as "flying ambulances") that
Dominique Jean Larrey, MD, invented to carry injured sol
diers in Napoleon's army and the professional ambulance
corps that Jonathan Letterman, MD, instituted for the Army
of the Potomac after the disastrous first Battle of Bull Run,
where the wounded were left on the field when Union
troops fled back to Washington.
Gunshot victims wheeled into any big city trauma center
benefit from techniques that a generation of EMTs and sur
geons first learned repairing combat wounds. "Most of the
emergency medical response doctrine in practice in the
United States today evolved from medical experiences in
the jungles of Southeast Asia in the late 19605," says Lt.
Gen. Kevin Kiley, MD, surgeon general of the U.S. Army.
For all the destruction and chaos it wreaks, war spurs some
medical advances. Historically, trauma surgery, emergency
care and infectious disease treatments leap the furthest
ahead. Military medicine stretches back to antiquity.
Augustus Caesar formed a medical corps for his legions.
Roman surgeons tied ligatures and clamped arteries to
control bleeding, and the vinegar they poured into wounds
acted as an antiseptic. Galen, court physician to Marcus
Aurelius in Rome, performed bold operations and gained
an understanding of the human anatomy that was unsur
passed well into the second millennium. Ambrose Pare, the
16th-century French physician who figured out that wounds
healed faster if you didn't pour boiling oil onto them,
observed that the only people who gain from warfare are
young surgeons. French Army surgeon Jean Louis Petit's
invention of the screw tourniquet in 1718 made it possible
to amputate legs above the knee without bleeding the
patient to death. His device, which cut the flow from the
femoral artery, would be in every military surgeon's kit until
well after the U.S. Civil War. Even with such equipment,
until anesthetics came along, surgeons' reputations rested
principally on the speed with which they could saw off
limbs.
ADVANCES REAL AND IMAGINED
While wars provide ample opportunities for surgeons to
hone their skills, some historians believe their contributions
to the medical arts are modest if not minimal. F.H.

Garrison, MD, in An Introduction to the History of Medicine
(1929), wrote about World War I, "Viewed after the lapse
of a decade, the medical innovations and inventions of the
war period seem clever, respectable, but not particularly
brilliant." More recently, British sociologist Roger Cooter,
PhD, made the argument that, "For the most part, war has
accelerated research into old medical problems of military
importance, the bulk of which are highly specific to that
context and of little value outside it." During most modern
wars, Cooter says, civilians' health needs have taken a
back seat to the medical needs of the military.
Throughout most of recorded history, disease, not arrows,
bullets or bombs, was the scourge of armies. Generals
have long understood the importance of sanitation to the
health of their troops. The French Army instituted physical
exams for new soldiers in the early 18th century; soon
recruits and conscripts were being poked and measured in
all of Europe's armies. At Valley Forge in 1 777, Gen.
George Washington ordered the Continental Army inocu
lated against smallpox. "Should the disorder infect the
Army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence,
we should have more to dread from it than from the sword
of the enemy," wrote Washington, whose visage bore the
scars of a bout with smallpox at age 19.
Still, among the 70,000 colonials who died during the
Revolutionary War, nine were felled by disease for every
one who died at the hands of the redcoats. Among the
31,000 British fatalities, just 4,000 were killed in action. In
the Civil War, three-fifths of the 304,369 Union dead were
victims of disease, not casualties of battle. It took until the
20th century for the arts of medicine and warfare to
advance to the point where more combatants died from
battle wounds than from diseases. The United States was a
late entrant to World War I, but there were 53,402
Americans killed in action and 63,114 dead from other
causes. By World War 11, the Pentagon counted 291,557
deaths in action and 113,842 from other causes.
Over the centuries, as armies moved away from frontal
combat and learned to unleash deadlier force across
greater distances, war became less lethal for combatants
and more lethal for civilians. More than 6 million of the 15
million lives lost in World War I were civilians; in World War
11, the first global conflict, at least 35 million civilians per
ished - including more than 200,000 in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki from atomic bombs, and 6 million European
Jews by genocide - dwarfing the 20 million military fatali
ties.
Whatever the historians' verdicts, wars are popularly associ
ated with medical advances in the public mind, such as the
blood banks that Oswald Hope Robertson, MD, created for
the Army Medical Corps in France in 1918, and penicillin,
the antibiotic that came to prominence and became widely
available during World War 11. But Dale Smith, PhD, who
chairs the medical history department at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences, or USUHS, in

Bethesda, Md., says that in both instances, the real break
throughs occurred in laboratories in the decade before the
world wars.
Still, when the United States entered World War I, manuals
for battle surgeons contained illustrations showing them
how to sew a donor's radial artery to the basilic vein of the
wounded comrade for direct transfusion. "By the end of the
war, those pages are gone and those same books show
how to keep blood in storage boxes protected by ice and
sawdust, and how to treat the blood to transfuse it safely,"
says Col. David Burris, MD, chief of the Norman M. Rich
Department of Surgery at USUHS. While Sir Alexander
Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin took place in
1928, the antibiotic remained in short supply until the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry performed a second miracle in
gearing up industrial production of the scarce antibiotic
during World War 11.
EMERGENa MEDICINE'S CRUCIBLE
The Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital, or MASH, not only
saved lives in Korea, but entered American folklore thanks
to Robert Altman's 1970 black comedy, M*A*S*H, and the
hit television series. The idea for MASH, however, originat
ed in World War II with a Boston chest surgeon, Col.
Edward "Pete" Churchill, MD, who in 1943 moved his best
surgeons forward into rudimentary, auxiliary field hospitals
during the invasion of Italy. A young Michael Deßakey, MD,
serving on the surgeon general's brain trust in Washington,
later helped institutionalize the practice.
Vietnam gave new meaning to the term "flying ambu
lances" as daring Huey helicopter pilots ferried the wound
ed out of jungle battle zones. Even "dust off" - the military
call sign for those evacuations - entered the American lexi
con. Indeed, President George W. Bush held a ceremony in
the White House in late February to present the
Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Bruce Crandall,
one of those Huey pilots, for darting in and out of a raging
firefight in Vietnam's la Drang Valley 14 times on a single
day in November 1965 to rescue and resupply a 1 st
Cavalry battalion. His wingman, Ed Freeman, received the
same honor in 2001.
Such feats not only proved the pilots' mettle, but demon
strated what a lifesaver the sturdy little Huey - the Bell UH-1
Iroquois - could be. That lesson was not lost on hospital
administrators and trauma surgeons back home. The
Pentagon in 1968 lent helicopters for a pilot program to
rescue accident victims from highway crashes in San
Antonio and Dallas, and Baltimore trauma surgeon Adams
Cowley, MD, convinced Maryland authorities to create the
first statewide transport system in the early 19705. Today,
no self-respecting trauma hospital is complete without a
helipad.
The crucible of conflict whets appetites for more and better
medicine. Cooter, the British sociologist, wrote in the
Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine
(1993): "Wars such as the American Civil and the First
World War exposed large numbers of men to modern
medicine and dentistry for the first time: one by one,
recruits were stripped for examination, measured, weighed,
tapped, and interrogated. Along with the soldiers and
sailors whose lives were spared by the skills of military sur
geons, such men may have returned home from war with
higher demands for and expectations of orthodox medicine
than when they left." Smith, the historian of military medi
cine, notes the same phenomenon occurred after World
War 11, in which 30 percent of the nation's physicians had
been pressed into service to attend to the needs of the 8
percent of the population under arms.
Perhaps war's greatest contribution to medicine is the
chance to run public health experiments on a grand scale
under exigent circumstances. Letterman's Civil War ambu
lance corps was a dry run for today's emergency medical
services. Indeed, the municipal ambulance system that New
York's Bellevue Hospital launched in 1869 was modeled
on the medical transports that Edward Dalton, MD, orga
nized for the Army of the Potomac. Back home as sanitary
superintendent for New York, Dalton convinced commis
sioners that the city needed an ambulance corps of its own.
Each horse-drawn ambulance was stocked with "a quart
flask of brandy, two tourniquets, a half-dozen bandages, a
half-dozen small sponges, some splint material, pieces of

old blankets for padding, strips of various lengths with
buckles, and a two-ounce vial of persulphate of iron,"
according to a January 2000 History Magazine account.
The Civil War's impact on the practice of medicine was
profound, according to Civil War buff and surgeon F.W.
Blaisdell, MD, class of 1952, who's known as the father of
the modern trauma center. It set the standards for handling
mass casualties and for combining field hospitals with
large, pavilion-style hospitals in the rear. The latter became
the model for municipal hospitals built across the United
States for the next 75 years, Blaisdell wrote in The Achives
of Surgery in 1988.
Those clean, well-ventilated hospitals were part of the lega
cy of Surgeon General William Hammond, MD, promoted
at age 34 from first lieutenant to brevet brigadier general in
1862 to shake up the Union Army's backward medical
bureaucracy. Hammond laid the groundwork within Army
medicine for a culture and passion for science and
research, but his strong opinions also made him enemies.
He defied medical orthodoxy by banning calomel, a popu
lar mercury-based purgative that Hammond recognized
was toxic. Court-martialed and driven from his post in
1864, Hammond went on to postwar distinction as a neu
rologist.
It was Hammond's idea, too, to create an Army Medical

Museum and to instruct field surgeons to send back to this
fledgling museum and laboratory in Washington "speci
mens of morbid anatomy" in hopes that they might yield
insights on improving care of the Union's soldiers. After the
