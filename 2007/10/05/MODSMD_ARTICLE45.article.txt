From Thermopylae to Baghdad, from the Gallic wars to
Vietnam, war has proved an exacting but efficient school
master for physicians. Hippocrates wrote, "He who would
become a surgeon should join an army and follow it."
Second-century Greek physician Galen honed his skills not
only in the sanctuary of Aesclepius, god of healing, but as
physician to the gladiators of Pergamon. The American
teenager pried from a twisted wreck on a Friday night and
sped to a suburban hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the
horse-drawn wagons (known as "flying ambulances") that
Dominique Jean Larrey, MD, invented to carry injured sol
diers in Napoleon's army and the professional ambulance
corps that Jonathan Letterman, MD, instituted for the Army
of the Potomac after the disastrous first Battle of Bull Run,
where the wounded were left on the field when Union
troops fled back to Washington.
Gunshot victims wheeled into any big city trauma center
benefit from techniques that a generation of EMTs and sur
geons first learned repairing combat wounds. "Most of the
emergency medical response doctrine in practice in the
United States today evolved from medical experiences in
the jungles of Southeast Asia in the late 19605," says Lt.
Gen. Kevin Kiley, MD, surgeon general of the U.S. Army.
For all the destruction and chaos it wreaks, war spurs some
medical advances. Historically, trauma surgery, emergency
care and infectious disease treatments leap the furthest
ahead. Military medicine stretches back to antiquity.
Augustus Caesar formed a medical corps for his legions.
Roman surgeons tied ligatures and clamped arteries to
control bleeding, and the vinegar they poured into wounds
acted as an antiseptic. Galen, court physician to Marcus
Aurelius in Rome, performed bold operations and gained
an understanding of the human anatomy that was unsur
passed well into the second millennium. Ambrose Pare, the
16th-century French physician who figured out that wounds
healed faster if you didn't pour boiling oil onto them,
observed that the only people who gain from warfare are
young surgeons. French Army surgeon Jean Louis Petit's
invention of the screw tourniquet in 1718 made it possible
to amputate legs above the knee without bleeding the
patient to death. His device, which cut the flow from the
femoral artery, would be in every military surgeon's kit until
well after the U.S. Civil War. Even with such equipment,
until anesthetics came along, surgeons' reputations rested
principally on the speed with which they could saw off
limbs.
ADVANCES REAL AND IMAGINED
While wars provide ample opportunities for surgeons to
hone their skills, some historians believe their contributions
to the medical arts are modest if not minimal. F.H.

Garrison, MD, in An Introduction to the History of Medicine
(1929), wrote about World War I, "Viewed after the lapse
of a decade, the medical innovations and inventions of the
war period seem clever, respectable, but not particularly
brilliant." More recently, British sociologist Roger Cooter,
PhD, made the argument that, "For the most part, war has
accelerated research into old medical problems of military
importance, the bulk of which are highly specific to that
context and of little value outside it." During most modern
wars, Cooter says, civilians' health needs have taken a
back seat to the medical needs of the military.
Throughout most of recorded history, disease, not arrows,
bullets or bombs, was the scourge of armies. Generals
have long understood the importance of sanitation to the
health of their troops. The French Army instituted physical
exams for new soldiers in the early 18th century; soon
recruits and conscripts were being poked and measured in
all of Europe's armies. At Valley Forge in 1 777, Gen.
George Washington ordered the Continental Army inocu
lated against smallpox. "Should the disorder infect the
Army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence,
we should have more to dread from it than from the sword
of the enemy," wrote Washington, whose visage bore the
scars of a bout with smallpox at age 19.
Still, among the 70,000 colonials who died during the
Revolutionary War, nine were felled by disease for every
one who died at the hands of the redcoats. Among the
31,000 British fatalities, just 4,000 were killed in action. In
the Civil War, three-fifths of the 304,369 Union dead were
victims of disease, not casualties of battle. It took until the
20th century for the arts of medicine and warfare to
advance to the point where more combatants died from
battle wounds than from diseases. The United States was a
late entrant to World War I, but there were 53,402
Americans killed in action and 63,114 dead from other
causes. By World War 11, the Pentagon counted 291,557
deaths in action and 113,842 from other causes.
Over the centuries, as armies moved away from frontal
combat and learned to unleash deadlier force across
greater distances, war became less lethal for combatants
and more lethal for civilians. More than 6 million of the 15
million lives lost in World War I were civilians; in World War
11, the first global conflict, at least 35 million civilians per
ished - including more than 200,000 in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki from atomic bombs, and 6 million European
Jews by genocide - dwarfing the 20 million military fatali
ties.
Whatever the historians' verdicts, wars are popularly associ
ated with medical advances in the public mind, such as the
blood banks that Oswald Hope Robertson, MD, created for
the Army Medical Corps in France in 1918, and penicillin,
the antibiotic that came to prominence and became widely
available during World War 11. But Dale Smith, PhD, who
chairs the medical history department at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences, or USUHS, in

Bethesda, Md., says that in both instances, the real break
throughs occurred in laboratories in the decade before the
world wars.
Still, when the United States entered World War I, manuals
for battle surgeons contained illustrations showing them
how to sew a donor's radial artery to the basilic vein of the
wounded comrade for direct transfusion. "By the end of the
war, those pages are gone and those same books show
how to keep blood in storage boxes protected by ice and
sawdust, and how to treat the blood to transfuse it safely,"
says Col. David Burris, MD, chief of the Norman M. Rich
Department of Surgery at USUHS. While Sir Alexander
Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin took place in
1928, the antibiotic remained in short supply until the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry performed a second miracle in
gearing up industrial production of the scarce antibiotic
during World War 11.
EMERGENa MEDICINE'S CRUCIBLE
The Mobile Auxiliary Surgical Hospital, or MASH, not only
saved lives in Korea, but entered American folklore thanks
to Robert Altman's 1970 black comedy, M*A*S*H, and the
hit television series. The idea for MASH, however, originat
ed in World War II with a Boston chest surgeon, Col.
Edward "Pete" Churchill, MD, who in 1943 moved his best
surgeons forward into rudimentary, auxiliary field hospitals
during the invasion of Italy. A young Michael De√üakey, MD,
serving on the surgeon general's brain trust in Washington,
later helped institutionalize the practice.
Vietnam gave new meaning to the term "flying ambu
lances" as daring Huey helicopter pilots ferried the wound
ed out of jungle battle zones. Even "dust off" - the military
call sign for those evacuations - entered the American lexi
con. Indeed, President George W. Bush held a ceremony in
the White House in late February to present the
Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Bruce Crandall,
one of those Huey pilots, for darting in and out of a raging
firefight in Vietnam's la Drang Valley 14 times on a single
day in November 1965 to rescue and resupply a 1 st
Cavalry battalion. His wingman, Ed Freeman, received the
same honor in 2001.
Such feats not only proved the pilots' mettle, but demon
strated what a lifesaver the sturdy little Huey - the Bell UH-1
Iroquois - could be. That lesson was not lost on hospital
administrators and trauma surgeons back home. The
Pentagon in 1968 lent helicopters for a pilot program to
rescue accident victims from highway crashes in San
Antonio and Dallas, and Baltimore trauma surgeon Adams
Cowley, MD, convinced Maryland authorities to create the
first statewide transport system in the early 19705. Today,
no self-respecting trauma hospital is complete without a
helipad.
The crucible of conflict whets appetites for more and better
medicine. Cooter, the British sociologist, wrote in the
