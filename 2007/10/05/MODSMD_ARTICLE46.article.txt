In these sections, we enlisted the help of several Stanford
Alumni who have been, or are currently involved in the
biotech sector. We asked questions aimed at discovering
what they did in their time on the Farm, about what led
them into biotech, and about any advice they have for cur
rent students. Here are their answers! You can reach these
alumni for career-related questions by logging onto

CARL SCANDELLA
1971, PHD BIOCHEMISTRY
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
What did you study in college? What were your favorite classes?
As an undergrad chem major at Caltech I took a lot of lab
classes: organic chem, physical chem, analytical chem,
biochem, physics. They were my favorites because I found
it more interesting to see something happen before my eyes
than to read about it. I was intrigued by the structure and
behavior of molecules, and the prospect of understanding
how living cells function at the molecular level captured my
imagination. As a graduate student at Stanford my classes
were in the area of biochemistry; most of my time was
spent doing research in Dr. Arthur Kornberg's group in the
Department of Biochemistry. There I discovered a mem
brane-bound phospholipase enzyme in the bacterium E.
coli, purified and studied it. This was the first enzyme firmly
bound in the bacterial membrane to be purified to homo
geneity so it was interesting from the standpoint of mem
brane structure. I carried out the purification starting with
100 kg E. coli cell paste using the large-scale purification
facility at the New England Enzyme Center in Boston. Dr.
Kornberg had been instrumental in establishing that facility
and making it available to universities. Many proteins,
including the phospholipase and DNA polymerase I, the
enzyme discovered earlier by Dr. Kornberg, represent only a
tiny fraction of cell protein so a large quantity of starting
material must be processed in order to recover enough
material to work with. This experience was to become
valuable later for my career in the biotech industry because
recombinant proteins often behave like membrane proteins
and are challenging to purify; also, experience in large
scale purification of proteins was and still is a valuable
commodity. Another gem from my Stanford tenure was
postdoctoral work with Professor Harden McConnell in the
Chemistry Department. There I joined a brilliant team that
included Roger Kornberg, my thesis advisor's oldest son.
Roger is, of course, currently Professor of Structural Biology
at Stanford and winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. We measured the lateral diffusion of phospho
lipids in a biological membrane showing that the cell mem
brane is a two-dimensional liquid.
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join any clubs or student organizations?
I played IM basketball at Stanford and loved to play tennis
with my friends. Dr. Kornberg had a tennis court at his
house and there were some lively matches with him and his
sons. The youngest son, Ken, played on Stanford's tennis

team; Roger and Tom were frequent participants.
Otherwise my energies were consumed by thesis research
and postdoctoral research projects.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about
your career plans? If so, what were those thoughts?
I thought I would become a research biochemist and a uni
versity professor and wanted to try my hand at teaching.
The biotechnology industry, where I eventually landed, did
not exist at that time but in retrospect my undergraduate
and graduate training were perfect for that industry.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experi
ences?
The summer after my Freshman year I was a research assis
tant in the Aeroject-General Liquid Rocket Plant in
Sacramento, my home town. We developed rocket fuels
for ICBM's and space vehicles. It was exciting work but the
race to build more powerful rockets slowed dramatically
around that time. As I progressed through college my
interests shifted from pure chemistry to understanding the
chemistry of living organisms. The summer after my
Sophomore year I purified a muscle protein, paramyosin,
from the Maine lobster homarus americanus and studied its
structure in an electron microscopy lab at Caltech. The rest
of the creature found its way into tasty dishes! The following
summer I isolated DNA from a recombination-deficient
strain of E. coli and studied its methvlation pattern in the
Biological Laboratories at Harvard. The summer after my
Senior year was spent biking around Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, sleeping in youth hostels and gaining flu
ency in German. The lab experiences sampled university
research and influenced my decision to go to grad school
in Biochemistry at Stanford.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have
to do to find it?
After college I went directly to graduate school. After grad
uate school I did postdoctoral work, first in the Chemistry
Department at Stanford, then at the Biocenter at the
University of Basel and the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Each
of these experiences further developed my scientific skills.
My first job was as Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at
SUNY, Stony Brook NY. In order to get that job I wrote let
ters and was invited to present research seminars at a half
dozen universities. Two job offers resulted and I accepted
the position at Stony Brook.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job? Was it what
you expected?
I gave about 40 lectures a year to undergraduate, gradu
ate and medical school students. It was challenging to
prepare in-depth lectures on multiple subjects while running
a research lab and maintaining grant support. I also
attended research conferences , wrote articles for publica
tion, presented seminars and trained M.S. and Ph.D. stu
dents. Unfortunately teaching was not as satisfying as I
had hoped and little time was left to work in the lab. I
wanted to participate in the exciting advances made possi

ble by genetic engineering.
How did your career evolve after that? How did you experiences
lead to other opportunities?
When the biotech industry picked up steam in the early
1980's some of my grad school friends left academia for
industry and I joined them. My first job in industry was
"Project Coordinator", an administrative position at a
biotech company on the east coast. I soon learned that I
had little interest in administration so returned to the lab as
a protein chemist. My initial effort at that was spectacularly
successful; using some tricks learned in my thesis work on
the membrane-bound phospholipase I developed and
patented a process for purifying recombinant chymosin, an
enzyme used in cheese-making, from genetically engi
neered yeast and E. coli cells. I then had the good fortune
to become one of the early employees at Chiron
Corporation, a biotech company in Emeryville that
emerged from the Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology at UCSF and the Department of
Biochemistry at UC Berkeley to become an industry leader.
There I worked on several key projects with an outstanding
team of scientists. I also managed Chiron's Process
Development Group and Manufacturing Protein Purification
Group. During this time I maintained close contact with
the lab and the production floor so I was very happy. We
were able to complete some of the landmark projects in
Chiron's history as well as the history of biotechnology and
I was promoted to the highest scientific level.
Chiro'i -vas the first company to clone the AIDS virus, HIV
1. My group found a novel way to purify the major coat
protein of the virus, gpl 20, in its native form and make this
protein available in large quantities ahead of our competi
tors. Our protein was used in AIDS diagnostic tests and
vaccine trials and selected by the NIH as a reference stan
dard. For several years most of the world's supply of
gpl 20 was purified by us and distributed to hundreds of
AIDS researchers by the NIH as Chiron made the protein
available at cost.
Chiron discovered the Hepatitis C Virus, the virus responsi
ble for the disease formerly known as Non A-Non B
Hepatitis. After Chiron's work the'name of the disease was
changed to Hepatitis C. Chiron developed a diagnostic
test to detect Hepatitis C contamination in the blood sup
ply. When the FDA approved this test it was made manda
tory for all blood banks in the US and was soon adopted
by blood banks worldwide. Before Chiron's test there was
no way to detect Hepatitis C in blood so a person receiving
a blood transfusion in America had a 15% chance of con
tracting Hepatitis C, a disease with serious consequences.
It was very satisfying to help bring this product to market
because it touched the lives of millions of people around
the world.
Insulin-like Growth Factor I, IGF-1, was the top priority pro
ject when I started at Chiron because it was the first joint
venture with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Ciba-Geigy.
We were successful in meeting our objectives, resulting in
the formation of other partnerships with Ciba-Geigy and
investments in Chiron totaling several billion dollars. The
World Health Organization also selected our IGF-1 as an
international standard. Prior to our work the world's supply
of IGF-1 amounted to only about 25 mg protein and that
