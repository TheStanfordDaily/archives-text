## Just Say No To Scurvy 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION QUACK 
As a college student, you are now alone and friendless.
If you fall, no one will pick you up again. In fact, if the
nearest passerby happens to he pre-med, he or she will
probably kick you in various sensitive areas, like the
inferior pharyngeal constrictor or the groin. Dust will
eventually cake over your scrcaming face, frozen in a
rictus of pain and frustration. You will not be able to
take advantage of Student Discount Day.

But this transition to a new
world of self-sufficiency
doesn't just happen — you
need to prepare. And is
there any better way to do so
than by listening to some
snarky SLE kid tell you fun
home remedies and do-it
yourself solutions for cer
tain common problems?
Absolutely. But look how
much you've read already!
Arc you going to just waste
all that effort?

HOW TO:
Cure a sore throat
Some say to gargle salt
water, others to take
spoonfuls of honey and
vinegar and still others to
drink chamomile tea. It's
worth noting that they say
all of these things hoarsely.
Alleviate a headache

Dabbing essential oils (cinnamon and lavender being
favorites) on the temples is supposed to help, as is the
consumption of apples and lemons. Certain very con
fused experts recommend enemas. Another traditional

remedy is Tylenol.

Prevent a sunburn
, from peeling

According to one well-informed individual, smearing
yogurt on a sunburn will cool and soothe the skin, less
ening the peeling that may follow severe sun exposure.
This individual is also my editor, meaning 1 am obliged
to include this remedy without side comments.
Prevent scurvy
If you are a pirate, you will be glad to know that this hor
rific ailment has a very simple and well-known cure: In
dian Gooseberrv.

Clean a dirty refrigerator
Wipe it down with vinegar
Wash a thermos
Fill the thermos with baking soda dis
solved in warm water.
Create a volcano
Wash a thermos while you are cleaning a
dirty refrigerator.
Polish copper
While some may recommend
acidic/abrasive combinations, such as
lemon juice and salt, this sort of

cleanser is more than likely too
harsh for the sort of fine copper-

ware you'll be dealing with. It's
best to stick to commercial cop-

per-polishing paste.

Hang glide
Strap yourself into a glider and run
down a moderate slope. Use the shift
control bar to control pitch and roll.
Approach ground slowly and stall to

land. That's it. Try it at home.

Iron wrinkled clothes

I came up with this one myself:
take the clothes that need ironing into the bathroom
and lay them out on a flat surface. Turn the shower on
all the way. Once the room has filled with steam, repeat-

cdly slam Volume I of the Oxford English Dictionary
w (A-Baznuki) down on the wrinkles. This will flat-

ten out any significant crumpled areas while

causing only minimal structural damage.

It's a good option for people who are

afraid of burning holes into their
clothes with an actual iron.

Treat a hangover

You'll hear a lot of
kooky remedies for this
one, like "drink water," or

"eat," but there's still no
substitute for good ol' hero
in.
Fix broken furniture

Your residence should have a
toolkit available for loan. Do not

use it. In fact, avoid it at all costs, as
even approaching it will raise suspi
cion. Take the broken item and hide it

somewhere. If the broken item is a fl
shelf, hide it in the closet. If the broken y
item is the closet, hide it on a shelf. If the
broken item is neither of these things,
:* n..li„ r» 1 * < i r .t

dump it in Roble Pool. At the end of the
year, deny that the item ever existed. Hell,
you don't know why they didn't put a bed in

there, but sleeping on the floor sure cleared up your sci
atica!
Sew rips in clothing

The actual sewing is not particularly difficult —
pin the rip together, set strips of basting tape
along the site you'll be stitching, diagonally cut
a length of thread, draw it across a wax candle.

tic a double overhand or a stevedore's knot in one
end of the thread to prevent slipping. Then,
thread it through a needle by wetting the cut end
of the strand, stitch across the rip with close spac-

ing, pulling it tight enough with each stitch to close the
gap but not so tight that the fabric bunches, and. once
you've finished the job, close it off with another stopper
knot.
The real hard part for most of us is finding something to
use as thread. Fortunately, you have an untapped sup
ply of thread material in your very own room: simply
pluck the hairs from your roommate's nascent unibrow
as he sleeps (hope you brought tweezers!), tie them into
longer, workable strands using a series of double sheet
bends and plait these filaments together to form a sur
prisingly durable thread, suitable for mending, embroi
dery and, in certain prisons, surgery. In the spring, wool
ly caterpillars serve as another natural, abundant source
of fibers.
Get stains out
There is no way to get stains out.
