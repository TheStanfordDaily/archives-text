## Don't Be Fraiche: A New Fro-Yo Joint Comes to Town 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION FRESH-FACED 
If we had been very clever people after our first trip to
Pinkberry (a posh fro-yo bar in Manhattan's Koreatown).
we might have devised a business plan that looked some
thing like this:
Completely rip off Pinkberry's menu. Design a store
with the same layout as Pinkberry. Put this store in Palo
Alto, where suburban moms have nothing better to do
than meet with their interior decorators and/or fellow
toddler-moms over a nice, big (and none-too-fattening)
container of slightly tangy fro/en yogurt. (Jive it a preten
tious French name.
Voila. Fraiche. If we had invented it. we'd be rich.
Instead, we're writing about it. Although Fraiche ripped
off Pinkberry (which in turn ripped off a Korean fro-yo
chain called Red Mango), it does have a lew innovations
to its name. Pinkberry has made money selling two flavors
of frozen yogurt — vanilla and green tea. Fraiche Yogurt
("homemade organic fresh and frozen yogurt") drops the
Asian twist and simply offers vanilla, nonfat vanilla and
chocolate. In keeping with the less-than-hip-but-super-fit
aesthetic of Palo Alto, the store also offers fresh Greek yo
gurt made on the premises, which, given the capricious na
ture of dairy products, is something of a comfort.
Other bright innovations adopted by the founders in
clude green, mildly Huffy cushions (which already bear
stains of chocolate fro-yo drips), a sign ensuring dieters
everywhere that fro-yo and Ire-yo help people lose weight
and a block of chocolate grated before vour very eyes if

you ask for chocolate shavings as a topping. Brilliant.
l oppings, which were doled out to us by an aging hip
ster wearing a guerrilla beanie, are costly but plentiful.
The selection includes fresh fruit, nuts, syrups, honey and
the aforementioned chocolate shavings, which turn out to
be divine in combination with the chocolate fro-yo but
"the most disgusting thing that has ever entered my
mouth" when placed atop the plain Greek yogurt. And
given the things that have entered Ruth's mouth...
Speaking of Greek yogurt, it's clearly something that
no 30-something mom will be able to resist. It's just so
healthy. Which is why we'd recommend sweetening it up
with honey and maybe some fruit, although the mommies
who were crow ding the place at 11 a.m. were simply shov
eling back cups of the stuff, as only women who have ex
perienced the pains of childbirth can.
But even the vanilla fro-yo (certainly more delicious
than the Greek variety) is fairly healthy, especially when
juxtaposed with run-ol'-the-mill ice cream. A four-oz cup
of the vanilla is a mere KM) calories, which explains why
the shop was crowded with lean moms, who in turn were
stringing along their blonde kids. Fraiche has an ideal
menu for such a crowd, though its interior decor seems un
able to hold out much longer against its toddler clientele.
The leather cushions in the booths, for example, hardly
scream "kid-proof." Everything is tastefully done, though,
and Fraiche'"s hours run late enough that the post-soccer
mom hours should be good for emo kids looking for new
and exciting dessert places.
But back to the yogurt. It's all about the yogurt — and
not the room-temperature, gloopy Greek stuff. What

keeps clients flocking hack to Pinkberry and Reel Mango
isn't how generous the servers are with the fruit, or how
closely the flavor of the syrups resemble the fruits from
which they are supposedly made, but the divine, tangy
kick ol fro-yo that makes you sit up and notice that you're
not in the dining hall anymore.
The vanilla yogurt at Fraiche is on the right track. It's
sweeter than most of the stuff we've tasted (one of us is a
native of South Korea, where the healthy, tangy I'ro-yo
boom started), but it has a shy kick and some character.
The chocolate fro-yo was surprisingly good, too — with a
curious smoky undertone — but if you're going to try
what some Hollywood starlets have called "Crack Berry."
go for the vanilla.
Fraiche also offers a basic menu of espresso drinks, as
well as an intriguing fridge lull ol drinks-to-go, including
green-tea infused concoctions and boxes of "coconut
water." Perfect entertainment for the Stepford wives.
The disadvantages this new fro-yo parlor faces
are all wrapped up in its newness. Fraiche has
none of the pre-fab decor found in each Pinkber
ry. Rather. Fraiche is evidently hand-decorated,
thus the leather cushions, the stainable pillows
and the iPod speaker in the corner. This home
made quality is refreshing, but we doubt that the
decor will survive the wrath of soccer toddlers for
much longer. Which is fine. As college kids,
we're no strangers to shabby chic, and maybe this
is our long-awaited, inconveniently far-from
campus replacement for the CoHo.
