## FROM INEDIBLE TO INCREDIBLE 
### MATT BUSH INTERMISSION TOP CHEF 
Too often our dining halls have nothing
' worth eating. Even the freshmen are starting
to notice just how much of the food is literally
the same thing as what was served the day be
fore. It's too bad that the dining halls' idea of
culinary creativity is prefixing random ethnic
descriptors like "Asian" onto the name of
generic vegetable dishes (it's just zucchini!) or
adding unnecessary tildes to remotely Mexi
can meats.
So it's time to take things into your own
hands and create unique dishes with what
you've got in the dining hall. If you take a look
around at the ingredients, condiments and
toppings available to you, the combinations
are endless. Here are eight dining hall combo
suggestions you can make yourself that arc
guaranteed to make heads turn:
1. Breakfast strawberries. Those syrupy,
gooey waffle strawberries that probably came
out of a can might seem gross when they're
making your waffles soggy, but they're actual
ly a pretty versatile and yummy breakfast in
gredient in other scenarios. They can go well
in an unsweetened bowl of cereal, in oatmeal
or as dip for a donut. You can even use the
gooey sauce as a syrup for juice or as a fruity
sweetener for coffee or tea.

2. Crazy sandwiches and omelets. If your
dining hall ever offers a Panini bar or an
omelet bar, consider all the random ingredi
ents you can put in them! Think outside the
basic meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese and
venture over to the salad bar for arugula, the
pasta bar for parmesan cheese and the hot
food line for thick slices of meat. And if you re
ally know what you're doing (and are willing
to receive an odd stare from the server), you

can always try something wild like fruit jam in
an omelet.

3. Peanut butter and jelly. Most dining halls
(except poor Ricker) have peanut butter and

jelly among the spreads next to the

bread, so grab a butter knife and
make this old-fashioned ele- ,

mentary-school-lunch part
of your college diet. This
might seem like an obvious

combination, but
times it takes all year for"
the people who immedi
ately rush to the hot food
line to notice these ingredi
ents. These sandwiches are
especially convenient to
prepare ahead of time for
midnight snacks or a lunch
away from the dining hall.

4. Neat dips and sauces. If

you're not all that hungry or just feel like fin
ger food, consider making your own dip or
sauce to dip chips in. If you're not in Stern and
don't have chips every day, toast with cheese
microwave-melted on top also goes well with
dips. Salad ingredients such as tomatoes and
olives, as well as dressings, pasta sauces, ham
burger condiments and other sauces and
spices can be combined to create a very tasty
concoction.

5. The sampler burger. If you're in the
mood for a burger, but the puny patty and dis-

proportionate bun aren't going to do it for
you, aim for something bigger and better.

Toast the bun, or replace it with a

bagel, sliced bread or a tortilla.
Or try every kind of patty

(regular, turkey, veggie)
under one bun. Ask the

server to grill onions or
mushrooms for you,
and, if it's brunch, don't
forget the bacon!
6. Fancy pasta
dishes. If you thought the
only thing you could do
with the pasta they serve
is put sauce on it, think
again. The grilled
chicken served with the
hamburgers is just beg-

ging to be chopped up and tossed into your
spaghetti. The squash, mushrooms, carrots
and other heated vegetables are also great for
mixing. If this isn't enough, go to the spice rack
(if you have one) and attack your pasta with
dried basil, garlic powder and red pepper
flakes.
7. Unique drinks. Trust me, soda's not all
that healthy, the juice gets old when they don't
change the flavors for a week and you really
can't trust milk that they dub "organic"
(quotes and all). Instead, try making pretty
looking fruit juice combinations â€” I'm fond
of the sunset-colored mix of fruit punch
poured over orange juice. And in the dessert
drink department, you can make a root beer
float or combine ice cream, milk and your fa
vorite toppings in a cup for a fresh, spoon
blended milkshake.
8. Ice cream toppings. Next time you serve
yourself a cup of ice cream or fro-yo, avoid the
boring ice cream toppings and go visit the
dessert line, the fruits, the spreads or even the
salad bar. Cake, pie, brownies, cookies, ba
nana, peanut butler and walnuts all taste deli
cious with ice cream. Who says FloMo has to
be the only dining hall with eight ice cream fla
vors a day?
