# Pluto's: Out of This World
## 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION EDIBLE ASTRONAUT 
If you've ever walked by Pluto's on 482
University Avenue around dinner time,
you've no doubt seen it crowded with stu
dents and locals alike. The eatery, which bills
itself as providing "fresh food for a hungry
universe," is a favorite for students who want
to get off campus for a good meal that doesn't
have too high a price tag.
At first, the variety of Pluto's offerings
may seem lacking, as the menu is only about
half the size of a single sheet of paper. How
ever. this small menu goes a long way because
the point of Pluto's is to allow you to design
your own meal. Customers have two main
platforms from which to choose: salads or
meats and sandwiches.
Within each of these platforms, you can
customize almost every aspect of your meal.
So while the variety of individual ingredients
may fit on a single page, the number of possi
ble combinations is sufficient to ensure that
there's something for everyone and that no
two trips to Pluto's need be the same.
Generally, the more popular of the two
options at Pluto's is salads. Naturally, the first

step to building your salad is to pick the
greens that will comprise its bulk. The choic
es are a serving of ordinary romainc lettuce,
baby spinach or the somewhat more colorful
"farmers' greens." Then you can choose from
up to seven of all of the standard ingredients,
from tomatoes to walnuts to croutons.
For those looking to add some substance
to their salad, Pluto's offers a number of
meals, including steak and chicken, as well as
vegetarian options like Portobello mush
rooms. The salad is then topped off with any
of a variety of dressings and your choice of
bread on the side.
It's hard to go wrong with a Pluto's salad
— it will only have ingredients in it that you
like. Quality is generally good across the
board — the produce is fresh, and the crou
tons are crunchy. The "Crispy Chicken As
teroids" were especially good in my salad,
but, granted, there's only so much you can do
with pieces of cold chicken tenders in a salad.
One thing worth noting was that my grilled
tri-tip, despite appearing to be cooked rare,
tasted heavily of charcoal, as if it had been
overcooked. Depending on your personal
taste, this could make or break the salad.
Pluto's other main offering is its meat and

sandwich platform. The main attractions here
are steak, roast turkey, grilled chicken and
poultry sausage. Each meat can be taken ei
ther as a carved entree or as a sandwich. If
you opt for the sandwich route, it can be on
sourdough, foccaciaorciabatta. You can then
add a choice of cheese, veggies and spreads
like garlic mayo and honey mustard. You
may also want to accompany your sandwich
with "Saturn's garlic potato rings," or, as
earthlings might call them, curly fries.
As was the case for the salads, all of the in
gredients are good, so if you order the sand
wich to your liking, then it should make an ex
cellent meal. However, as was the case with
the tri-tip, the flank steak had a strong char
coal taste. Also, be careful when ordering
your sandwich because the chef might offer
you "everything." As good as this sounds, it
may be a few too many flavors going on at
once. No matter how you order your sand
wich, the curly fries arc excellent.
The portions are extremely generous — a
single main salad could probably feed two
people — but if anyone has room for dessert,
brownies, pecan bars and similar finger
sweets are available. These deserts are a fine
way to close out the meal, hut they alone are

not tasty enough to
justify a trip to Pluto's.

The overall atmosphere

is supposed to simulate a sort \
of space-age industrial theme.

The interior design consists of
some decorations on the walls and

ceilings, as well as some
looking bar stools. Aside from that, it's

just a restaurant with ordinary tables and a
concrete floor. It's certainly nicer and more
interesting than an ordinary fast food place,
but it's nothing to get excited about.
While most aspects of the Pluto's experi
ence can be described as at least good, the
prices are what set it apart. The massive sal
ads and filling sandwiches along with a side or
drink are easily a complete meal for under
$10. It's hard to argue with any meal at that
price, and, at Pluto's, it's always good.
But before you run out for a quick dinner,
don't be fooled into thinking Pluto's is fast
food. The lines are justifiably always long,
and they tend to move incomprehensibly
slowly. At least you can use the time to design
your own meal from the endless possibilities.
