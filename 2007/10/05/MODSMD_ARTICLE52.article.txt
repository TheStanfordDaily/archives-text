# Pimp My Dorm
## 
### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION MARTHA STEWART 
Stanford dorms arc not endowed with style. Created with neither form nor function
in mind, they arc often haphazardly designed white boxes which present a challenge
for the student with an affection for color and style. Luckily. I have spent years ex
perimenting with ways to bring some design within rcach of West Lagunita.
[Smother Me With Vintage: The T-Shirt Quilt
Have you ever been so enamored with a shirt that you wanted to sleep in it every
night? I have, and I wore that shirt through rather quickly by wearing it in inappro
priate situations (deep fryers present an obstacle for cotton). Instead of wearing your
shirt like a safety blanket, sew it into one.
Conventional wisdom says to quilt t-shirts together, making sure to display the t
shirt's graphic on the quilt. Using your mad sewing skills (potentially accrued during
Life Skills), sew these various t-shirts onto some sort of backing (some people believe
in felt — I, however, believe in velvet). Depending on how fancy you want it to be.
you could add batting and create a comforter or leave it as is and use it as a throw
quilt. Hither way, it's soft-cotton jer
sey heaven for the _
dorm room. 1 I

Venus de Mirrielees: Fun with Paper
Here's a craft project for those artists out there (holla back!). If you have access
to some spare printer paper, masking tape, scissors, an cxacto and patience, you
can create your own paper model of the Venus de Milo, perfect for your new dorm
room! Now, 1 have not yet perfceted the pattern (getting the contours right is very
difficult), hut you can do it on your own as long as you're a good problem solver

(Product Design Majors: this is your entrance
exam). It took me about three weeks and a lot of sleep
less nights to craft my Venus de Milo (I call it Venus de
Setho, but I'm a narcissist), and it adds a touch of class
to my humble abode.

Sheet Curtains: Because You Don't Need Two Sets When You
Don't Do Laundry
If you hate the blinds that Stanford offers with the room bill —
and really, who doesn't — then 1 suggest that you get thyself to
a linen closet. That spare extra-long twin sheet that your
mother sent in hopes that you would rotate your sheets every

week is perfect for a makeshift, theoretically zero-cost curtain. Sim
plv cut strips into the top of the sheet, tie it onto the tension rod from

which the blinds hang, and you have a DIY curtain. It's cheap, it's easy and it'll
keep the sun out more stylishly than ever before.
Decoupage Dish Tray: Returning Dishes in Style

Everyone knows that borrowing dishes from the dining hall is an illegal,
if inevitable part of life (just ask co-ops). When those dishes have begun to
take over your desk, though, it's definitely lime to contemplate returning

them to the scrvery. But how will you transport a week's worth of dishes?
In style, of course. Cut pictures out of magazines and other publications
that strike your fancy. Once you've acquired a sufficient amount, create
a mixture of water and glue and then dip the pieces of paper into the
sticky substance and attach to a tray (how you acquire one is between you
and your conscience). When the tray has been completely covered by de
lightful imagery, let it dry. Once dry. go over tray with a coat of sealant
(shellac, for example). Now that you have your colorful and waterproof
[ tray, feel free to return those dishes without the risk of looking frumpy.

Water that Plant: Creating a Watering t an from Everyday Materials
Dorm plants need watering, but one cannot be expected to simply
fill a cup with water and ration it to dry pots. Plants deserve proper wa
tering cans, but those can be expensive and too large for the average
dorm garden. Instead of a metallic or plastic catastrophe, I suggest
using a Styrofoam cup and a straw. Simply insert the straw into the
I side of a Styrofoam cup — about two inches below the rim is a good
X spot. Once inserted, secure with duct tape to maintain a watertight
seal. Now feel comfortable to fill it with water.and quench that veg
etable thirst!

The Fiscal Paperweight: Turning Those Receipts into Dead Weight
Are you tired of saving those receipts from the Stanford Bookstore? I am. And I
won't take it anymore. So I've decided to wrap my receipts around an acorn I found
on the ground near Lake Lagunita. By wrapping each individual sheet around the

acorn-and-receipt ball, then securing them with clear tape, I am slow
ly but surely creating a blissfully light and environmentally friendly

paperweight. Once the ball has grown too large for effective use,
simply dig a hole large enough and deposit the paperweight into the
ground. Water, and come back in a year to find an oak sapling. See,
something good can come of spending money on an education.

Too Cool for Pasta Water Pasta Curtains
My mother makes me bring a case of Easy Mac to school every year.
While I adore Kraft's miraculous product, I don't make it very often,
and I end the year with about as much Easy Mac as I had when I began.
In order to keep this from happening in the future, I have decided to

make macaroni curtains. Using the excess dental floss my mother also makes
me bring. I created a new, cost effective twist on the beaded curtain so popular in the
'60s and '70s. I saved the cheese packets for when I disassemble the curtain at the end
of the year. It'll be a feast.
Astronomy for Lovers: The Bottom Bunk Fix
Star-lovers with bottom bunks need not cry because they are further from the heav
ens than their top bunk oppressors! Now. the heavens can come to you. By taking
that strand of Christmas lights that you brought thinking it'd be cute (it is, but every
one has them, so let's be different for the sake of being different) and pinning them
to the wood panel that holds up the top bunk mattress but offers no aesthetic plea
sure to you, the bottom bunker, you can create a miniature observatory which dou
bles as a night light and aphrodisiac. Create Orion's Belt and expect to undo a more
earthly belt as well!
Boxes for Butts: The Cardboard Couch
Some schools have high expectations of their students and require them to produce
large-scale, usable objects out of cardboard and tape. Sadly, Stanford does not re
quire us to make sail boats out of said materials, but now you can elect to push your
self to that next level of room decoration. Using cardboard boxes salvaged from the
Mechanical Engineering dumpsters and the Bookstore (not that I suggest that you
dumpster dive...), and some duct tape purchased at your local duct tape supplier, you
can create a lovely three-seater couch, loveseat or arm chair. Putting all the corrugat
ed pieces together may prove more challenging than your last Econ 102 A problem
set, but at least this will teach you important life skills, such as how to make seating
of questionable comfort.
Trashy Tushie: Cushions on the Cheap
Comfortable cushions don't come cheap, and if you're making a couch out of card
board, you must be looking for something inexpensive — unless you're skimping on
the seating so that you can splurge on the cushions, in which case you should proba
bly head on down to Urban Outfitters. Fiscally responsible padding requires two
things: paper and plastic bags. Take, borrow or purchase thick plastic bags, like the
blue ones that Housing uses to cover the trashcans, and fill them with paper that you
have shredded. You should shred paper that would otherwise be recycled, like old
newspaper and course syllabi. Once you've put them in the bag, compact the paper
to make room for more paper. Keep in mind that the weight of the human body will

squash the padding, so you want to get as mueh
in there are possible. Feel free to intersperse the I

paper with softer materials such as cotton balls, old rags i

and unwashed sheets. Once the hag has been properly filled, you can seal it perma-j
nently using an iron and a ruler to melt the edges together. Proper instruction on this?
process can be found online.
This process can also be adapted for smaller cushions and pillows using bags from the
Stanford Bookstore. Say what you will about their prices, they make sturdy bags!
Using a large cushion as a beanbag chair is another wonderful possibility.
If you don't like the texture of plastic bags, you can always cover them with old sheets
or blankets, such as the t-shirt blanket described above. Like the cardboard couch J
these cushions are a foundation for your design sensibilities.
First Floor Rivera: Taking Back Privacy
Living on the first floor may save you a few trips up and down stairs, but all this lazi-1
ness comes at a cost. The outside world often has a very easy time peering into first
tloor rooms, which can make the most vulnerable moments of life — getting un
dressed, getting dressed, sleeping, talking to that should-be special someone — feel
exposed. Using paint that can be removed with water, unleash your inner artist upon:
your windows. You may choose to recreate your favorite painting or do a self-por-1
trait on the glass, but whatever you do, you are chipping away at the transparency of J
your dorm room and securing a little more privacy and comfort with every stroke of j
the brush.
Floss-ify Your Room: Aluminum Foil to the Rescue!
Dorm rooms do not come with built-in bling. This is a fatal oversight by Stanford!
Housing and should be put before the ASSU Senate for discussion. Until this occurs
— and really, you need to elect an immensely awesome Senator before this occurs (1 jj
can't run. folks. I'm a senior. But 1 appreciate your support) — you can amplify the;
glamour quotient of your room by using aluminum foil creatively. You can cut it into*
strips and the string it with dental floss to create a tinsel-esque banner. You can cover
your bookcase in the shiny sheets to create a look of peerless wealth and class. The
truly hardcore can even cover every boring, organic-looking surface with aluminum
foil, creating the glimmering, metallic world of your dreams. This may require a few
rolls of aluminum foil, so buying from a wholesaler is advised.
There is an almost endless world of high art and low-class projects that make pimp
ing out your room affordable, practical and educational. The fun of all these do-it
yourself projects is figuring out how to do them. If you are interested in starting any
of these projects, make sure to check with your roommate(s) before you break
ground. I chose to bling out my room one year without consulting my roommates and
found that all my hard-earned metal was in the recycling bin a day later. Apparently
all the reflecting light caused some crayons to melt. Alas. Go out into the world and
style-ify it!

to some spare printer paper, masking tape, scissors, an cxacto and patience, you
can create your own paper model of the Venus de Milo, perfect for your new dorm
room! Now, 1 have not yet perfceted the pattern (getting the contours right is very
difficult), hut you can do it on your own as long as you're a good problem solver

(Product Design Majors: this is your entrance
exam). It took me about three weeks and a lot of sleep
less nights to craft my Venus de Milo (I call it Venus de
Setho, but I'm a narcissist), and it adds a touch of class
to my humble abode.

Sheet Curtains: Because You Don't Need Two Sets When You
Don't Do Laundry
If you hate the blinds that Stanford offers with the room bill —
and really, who doesn't — then 1 suggest that you get thyself to
a linen closet. That spare extra-long twin sheet that your
mother sent in hopes that you would rotate your sheets every

week is perfect for a makeshift, theoretically zero-cost curtain. Sim
plv cut strips into the top of the sheet, tie it onto the tension rod from

which the blinds hang, and you have a DIY curtain. It's cheap, it's easy and it'll
keep the sun out more stylishly than ever before.
Decoupage Dish Tray: Returning Dishes in Style

Everyone knows that borrowing dishes from the dining hall is an illegal,
if inevitable part of life (just ask co-ops). When those dishes have begun to
take over your desk, though, it's definitely lime to contemplate returning

them to the scrvery. But how will you transport a week's worth of dishes?
In style, of course. Cut pictures out of magazines and other publications
that strike your fancy. Once you've acquired a sufficient amount, create
a mixture of water and glue and then dip the pieces of paper into the
sticky substance and attach to a tray (how you acquire one is between you
and your conscience). When the tray has been completely covered by de
lightful imagery, let it dry. Once dry. go over tray with a coat of sealant
(shellac, for example). Now that you have your colorful and waterproof
[ tray, feel free to return those dishes without the risk of looking frumpy.

Water that Plant: Creating a Watering t an from Everyday Materials
Dorm plants need watering, but one cannot be expected to simply
fill a cup with water and ration it to dry pots. Plants deserve proper wa
tering cans, but those can be expensive and too large for the average
dorm garden. Instead of a metallic or plastic catastrophe, I suggest
using a Styrofoam cup and a straw. Simply insert the straw into the
I side of a Styrofoam cup — about two inches below the rim is a good
X spot. Once inserted, secure with duct tape to maintain a watertight
seal. Now feel comfortable to fill it with water.and quench that veg
etable thirst!

The Fiscal Paperweight: Turning Those Receipts into Dead Weight
Are you tired of saving those receipts from the Stanford Bookstore? I am. And I
won't take it anymore. So I've decided to wrap my receipts around an acorn I found
on the ground near Lake Lagunita. By wrapping each individual sheet around the

acorn-and-receipt ball, then securing them with clear tape, I am slow
ly but surely creating a blissfully light and environmentally friendly

paperweight. Once the ball has grown too large for effective use,
simply dig a hole large enough and deposit the paperweight into the
ground. Water, and come back in a year to find an oak sapling. See,
something good can come of spending money on an education.

Too Cool for Pasta Water Pasta Curtains
My mother makes me bring a case of Easy Mac to school every year.
While I adore Kraft's miraculous product, I don't make it very often,
and I end the year with about as much Easy Mac as I had when I began.
In order to keep this from happening in the future, I have decided to

make macaroni curtains. Using the excess dental floss my mother also makes
me bring. I created a new, cost effective twist on the beaded curtain so popular in the
'60s and '70s. I saved the cheese packets for when I disassemble the curtain at the end
of the year. It'll be a feast.
Astronomy for Lovers: The Bottom Bunk Fix
Star-lovers with bottom bunks need not cry because they are further from the heav
ens than their top bunk oppressors! Now. the heavens can come to you. By taking
that strand of Christmas lights that you brought thinking it'd be cute (it is, but every
one has them, so let's be different for the sake of being different) and pinning them
to the wood panel that holds up the top bunk mattress but offers no aesthetic plea
sure to you, the bottom bunker, you can create a miniature observatory which dou
bles as a night light and aphrodisiac. Create Orion's Belt and expect to undo a more
earthly belt as well!
Boxes for Butts: The Cardboard Couch
Some schools have high expectations of their students and require them to produce
large-scale, usable objects out of cardboard and tape. Sadly, Stanford does not re
quire us to make sail boats out of said materials, but now you can elect to push your
self to that next level of room decoration. Using cardboard boxes salvaged from the
Mechanical Engineering dumpsters and the Bookstore (not that I suggest that you
dumpster dive...), and some duct tape purchased at your local duct tape supplier, you
can create a lovely three-seater couch, loveseat or arm chair. Putting all the corrugat
ed pieces together may prove more challenging than your last Econ 102 A problem
set, but at least this will teach you important life skills, such as how to make seating
of questionable comfort.
Trashy Tushie: Cushions on the Cheap
Comfortable cushions don't come cheap, and if you're making a couch out of card
board, you must be looking for something inexpensive — unless you're skimping on
the seating so that you can splurge on the cushions, in which case you should proba
bly head on down to Urban Outfitters. Fiscally responsible padding requires two
things: paper and plastic bags. Take, borrow or purchase thick plastic bags, like the
blue ones that Housing uses to cover the trashcans, and fill them with paper that you
have shredded. You should shred paper that would otherwise be recycled, like old
newspaper and course syllabi. Once you've put them in the bag, compact the paper
to make room for more paper. Keep in mind that the weight of the human body will

squash the padding, so you want to get as mueh
in there are possible. Feel free to intersperse the I

paper with softer materials such as cotton balls, old rags i

and unwashed sheets. Once the hag has been properly filled, you can seal it perma-j
nently using an iron and a ruler to melt the edges together. Proper instruction on this?
process can be found online.
This process can also be adapted for smaller cushions and pillows using bags from the
Stanford Bookstore. Say what you will about their prices, they make sturdy bags!
Using a large cushion as a beanbag chair is another wonderful possibility.
If you don't like the texture of plastic bags, you can always cover them with old sheets
or blankets, such as the t-shirt blanket described above. Like the cardboard couch J
these cushions are a foundation for your design sensibilities.
First Floor Rivera: Taking Back Privacy
Living on the first floor may save you a few trips up and down stairs, but all this lazi-1
ness comes at a cost. The outside world often has a very easy time peering into first
tloor rooms, which can make the most vulnerable moments of life — getting un
dressed, getting dressed, sleeping, talking to that should-be special someone — feel
exposed. Using paint that can be removed with water, unleash your inner artist upon:
your windows. You may choose to recreate your favorite painting or do a self-por-1
trait on the glass, but whatever you do, you are chipping away at the transparency of J
your dorm room and securing a little more privacy and comfort with every stroke of j
the brush.
Floss-ify Your Room: Aluminum Foil to the Rescue!
Dorm rooms do not come with built-in bling. This is a fatal oversight by Stanford!
Housing and should be put before the ASSU Senate for discussion. Until this occurs
— and really, you need to elect an immensely awesome Senator before this occurs (1 jj
can't run. folks. I'm a senior. But 1 appreciate your support) — you can amplify the;
glamour quotient of your room by using aluminum foil creatively. You can cut it into*
strips and the string it with dental floss to create a tinsel-esque banner. You can cover
your bookcase in the shiny sheets to create a look of peerless wealth and class. The
truly hardcore can even cover every boring, organic-looking surface with aluminum
foil, creating the glimmering, metallic world of your dreams. This may require a few
rolls of aluminum foil, so buying from a wholesaler is advised.
There is an almost endless world of high art and low-class projects that make pimp
ing out your room affordable, practical and educational. The fun of all these do-it
yourself projects is figuring out how to do them. If you are interested in starting any
of these projects, make sure to check with your roommate(s) before you break
ground. I chose to bling out my room one year without consulting my roommates and
found that all my hard-earned metal was in the recycling bin a day later. Apparently
all the reflecting light caused some crayons to melt. Alas. Go out into the world and
style-ify it!


Stanford dorms arc not endowed with style. Created with neither form nor function
in mind, they arc often haphazardly designed white boxes which present a challenge
for the student with an affection for color and style. Luckily. I have spent years ex
perimenting with ways to bring some design within rcach of West Lagunita.
[Smother Me With Vintage: The T-Shirt Quilt
Have you ever been so enamored with a shirt that you wanted to sleep in it every
night? I have, and I wore that shirt through rather quickly by wearing it in inappro
priate situations (deep fryers present an obstacle for cotton). Instead of wearing your
shirt like a safety blanket, sew it into one.
Conventional wisdom says to quilt t-shirts together, making sure to display the t
shirt's graphic on the quilt. Using your mad sewing skills (potentially accrued during
Life Skills), sew these various t-shirts onto some sort of backing (some people believe
in felt — I, however, believe in velvet). Depending on how fancy you want it to be.
you could add batting and create a comforter or leave it as is and use it as a throw
quilt. Hither way, it's soft-cotton jer
sey heaven for the _
dorm room. 1 I
