## On a Budget? Sew What?! 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION 
Ever look at ads in magazines and think, "Are
you joking? $232 for THAT? I could make that my
self!"

Truth is, you probably could. You had those
little kits when you were younger — you know, the
ones with the strings and the beads and the clasps
in little containers, and you'd spread them all out

on the floor and make little bead necklaces and
bracelets. At the end of a two- or three-hour ,
session, you'd have a ton of bead necklaces
and bracelets and wear them everywhere and
be damn proud of them.
Too bad those bead necklaces and
bracelets won't fly in college. But that doesn't
mean you can't make stuff!
Good-looking stuff, too. I've got a
1 few things you can get started on when
I you've got a free afternoon.

Metallic Pumps
Metallics are very in. Actually, I can't
really remember a time when they were not
in. The thing you've got to remember with
metallics, though, is that they have to be
worn in moderation. Otherwise you'll look
like a giant...shiny thing. Like a giant piece
of glitter. An easy way to get just the right
amount of shine is to keep your outfit fairly
plain and use only one metallic piece in
each outfit — a top, a belt, a pair of pumps.
Don't have a pair of metallic pumps?
That's okay. Neither do I. But we can make
them.

Step One: Gather Necessary Materials
-A pair of boring (leather or pleather) pumps
-Metallic spray paint
-Some newspaper
Step Two: Set Up Workplace
Lay out the newspaper. If you like having brain cells, lay
out the newspaper in a very well ventilated area, prefer
ably outdoors. If you are uncoordinated, lay out more
newspaper than you think you'll need. If you are really,
really, uncoordinated, stop reading and go buy yourself
some metallic pumps.
Step Three: Paint!
Stuff your soles with newspaper. Then shake up the
spray paint can, hold it about a foot away from your
shoes, and lightly spray all over. Allow shoes to dry,
then do a second coat. Allow your shoes to dry again,
and then wear them! Yay!
Skinny Belts
Think belts belong just on pants that arc too big for you?
Not anymore, my friend! Belts now go anywhere, like
over a loose sweater or around a boxy jacket, and keep
you looking feminine and fashionable at the same time.
The key to this season's look is to keep the belt skinnier
and to wear it around your actual waist. Voila! Instant
hourglass figure! Don't have a skinny belt? That's okay.
I've got one but won't let you borrow it. Good thing you
can make one.
Step One: Gather Necessary Materials
-Spool of thick fancy ribbon (for sweaters) or rope
(for tunics and t-shirts)
-Scissors

Step Two: Set Up Workplace
Ready for this one? Sit at your desk.
Step Three: Cut!
Roll out about both arm span's length of ribbon or rope.
That might sound pretty long, but better 100 long than
too short. Imagine how stupid and wasteful you would
feel if you cut it too short. Then cut the ribbon or rope
at an angle, and not a 90-degree angle, more like a 45-
degree angle. If you're a perfectionist, you can burn the
ends so that they don't fray. Otherwise, you're good to
go-
Vintage Jewelry
Ever get dressed up, look in the mirror, and say to your
self, "Man, something's missing?" Might be your pants.
Put pants on. OK. try again. Still something missing?
Might be some jewelry! This season's jewelry is in layers
— chunky beads, ribbons, lace, charms, bulky pieces
mixed with delicate pieces to create contrast. My mom
had some super-awesome jewelry from way back in the
day — pearls, huge ruby earrings and other good stuff,
but she wouldn't let me take it. Is your mom like my
mom? Doesn't trust that you won't lose her stuff?
That's OK. We can make some.
Step One: Gather Necessary Materials
Depending on what you want to make, you can gather
as few or as many of these things as you want:
-Black Mardi Gras beads
-Silver and gold chains
-Silver and gold plain earrings (the ones with the loops
at the bottom)
-Stones and beads, preferably with holes in them al
ready
