Step Two: Set Up Workplace:
Obviously if you're going to make just one piece of
jewelry, you could probably just use your desk.
b/u if you're going to start a jewelry-making bo
nanza. I suggest clearing the floor. Oh. and vac
cuming first. Otherwise you might get things like
old licorice pieces confused with beads.
Step Three: Make!
We'll start with something simple. Take a length

of ribbon or lace, maybe add a charm, and tie il
around your neck as a choker or around your /

wrist as a bracelet. Take

the earrings, arrange
| the stones and beads
| to your liking, and
drop them onto the

loop. Take a long sil
k ver or sold chain

and add a large
> pendant in the
same metal tone.

Take the black Mardi Gras
necklace, cut it.and attach a

head to each end. Then tie the

necklace into a knot about three inches

up from the stones. II"
you make all of them,
please don't wear
them all at the same

time. Falling over from the weight of metal
around your neck is so not cool. Try two or three,
at most, at a time.
That's all for now. Now get your make on. j
