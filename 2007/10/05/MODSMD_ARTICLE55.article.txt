## When Words Are Not Enough 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION MIXTAPE MASTER 
The mixtapc has become a cultural phenomenon. The mixtape first
became relevant in the 1980s with the rise of audiotapes. It was a sym
bol of the underground, the independent and the do-it-yourself cul
ture. For the first time, kids could assemble songs from dozens of dif
ferent bands and put them into one easily accessible source. Bands
could get exposure via the local mixtapc. Suddenly, individuals—not
just bands and record labels—could control the songs on an "album."
A world of infinite possibilities opened up to the listener; a new vehi
cle for expression was born.
This freedom then expanded with the introduction of CDs, com
puters and the Internet. Now the individual truly had almost every
song he could ever want at his fingertips. All the listener's creative en
ergies could be set free via some digital music tiles, a CD and a com
puter. Now mixtapes have proliferated not just to the scenester who
listens to Flock of Seagulls (as it was in the '80s), but also to regular
people like you and me. The musical world is our blank slate.
After years of trial and error, most mixtape masters have calibrat
ed a few general guidelines for reaching musical rapture. For a more
detailed list, please refer to the delightfully pretentious book/movie
"High Fidelity." The first song, for instance, must grab the listener's at
tention. Your mixtape's first impression is key; it sets a tone. (Think,
for instance, "Silcnce Kit" by Pavement on the album "Crooked Rain,
Crooked Rain.") Secondly, you'll want to kick the mixtape up a notch
— something that really drives home the point. (Think "Obstacle 1"
from "Turn on the Bright Lights" by Interpol.) But you don't want to
blow the speaker, so the third track should cool everybody down a bit.
It should be sprawling and memorable, but not in-your-face like your
first two tracks. (Classic example: "Across the Universe" by the Bea
tles on "Let It Be.") Then try to maintain the balance of tempo for the
next few songs.
By about the sixth track. Side A is wrapping up, so the seventh track
should then kick off side B with some energy. ("The Well and the
Lighthouse" by the Arcade Fire is an example.) Accordingly, the
tempo should pick up a bit. But this is ultimately illusory, for the tape
is actually beginning its slow descent to the end. I mean, how many hits
do you ever find positioned in the latter half of an album? (Good ex
ample of a side-B track: "Stay Away" from Nirvana's "Nevermind.")
And then wrap it all up with a grand, epic farewell. (Best closing song
ever: "Day in the Life" off of "Sergeant Pepper." Final orchestral cli
max? Way epic.)
But even with these general rules in mind, each mixtapc is differ
ent. Mixtapes are ultimately a reflection of the thoughts, mood and
character of the mixtape master. Above all, mixtapes are dictated by
the master's message. Every move on a mixtape should be made with
this question in mind: What is this mixtapc trying to say? Usually the
best way to clarify a message is to choose a theme.
A mixtape's theme determines which songs you choose and where
you put them. Is your mixtapc theme "Summer road trip"? Hopeful
ly it's not, because that's pretty cliched. You can do better. Or perhaps
it's "Cool bands from the Bay Area"? Using local bands gives you
major indie points. Perhaps it's "French rap." Even just the thought is
pretentious., and. therefore, a winner. Overall, there are infinite
themes for your mixtape. You, the mixtapc master, must chosc which
is best.
