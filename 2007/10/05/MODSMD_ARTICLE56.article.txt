Remember the music you listened to in high school? I
wish I didn't. In a world where parents set your curfew and
you're conditioned to respond instantly to the bell signal
ing the end of your precious lunch period, listening to
crappy music is OK. Be it rocking out to My Chemical Ro
mance, rebelling with the bone-crushing Korn or tearing
it up when "Yellow" by Coldplay is played on the radio
for the fifth time in an hour, you could listen happily to
your mass-produced music without hiding your head
shamefully when a friend caught you in the act.
Now, however, you're at Stanford, a school respected
around the world as a place of culture and higher learning.
Here, where students regularly refer to Nietzsche and
Freud in everyday conversation, your complete collection
of John Mayer is just not going to cut it. However, mod
ern technology makes it easy to become familiar with
music more worthy of your maturity level.
One of the most successful tools for do-it-yourself
music discovery is an online radio service called Pandora
(http://www.pandora.com). founded by Stanford's very
own Tim Westcrgren '88. When you first land on the site,
a pretty, blue interface greets you warmly and invites you
to enter the name of an artist or song that you particular

ly like. Pandora then directs you to their tuner, where a
radio station based on the characteristics of the song or
artist you just entered begins to play.
For example, if your favorite song is still "Yellow" by
Coldplay, you can type that into the search box and in
stantly receive a stream of songs that are similar in style
(which consists of "subtle use of harmony, major key
tonality, acoustic rhythm guitars and many other traits").
With Pandora's remarkable collection of music (over
500,(X)0 tracks and growing), you're practically guaran
teed to hear something you've never heard before. Or if
you don't quite know where to start, you can try typing in
a sub-genre like "Electronica," which will load a pre
made station constructed by the resident expert at the
Pandora office.
As you listen more to your station, you can gradually
start fine-tuning it to play only songs you like. You can tell
Pandora that you really like (or dislike) a song with a
thumbs up or thumbs down button. To increase the vari
ety of music 011 the station, you can "seed" the station with
more songs or artists. Or you can create a whole new sta
tion (Pandora allows you to have up to 100 stations on
your profile) with an entirely different feel. Go nuts;
you've got 5(X),0(X) songs right at your fingertips.
The magic behind Pandora is a database of songs

called the "Music Genome Project." Before am gi\en '
track is loaded into the collection, it has to be analyzed.
What sets Pandora apart from other personal radio ser
vices like Yahoo's Launchcast and Last.fm is that each
song is analyzed by a real person. Pandora employs 40 or
so local professional musicians with at least four years of
background in music theory to listen to each song. The an
alyst determines where, on a scale of one to five, the song
falls on over 400 musical "genes."
These genes include enough theory to make the
most stubborn of music geeks salivate. The vocal
track alone can include genes such as register,
amount of vibrato, use of gravel and even more
subtle distinctions like breathiness and silkiness.
All of these genes are stored in the Music Genome
Project, where the track can be compared to other
songs in the database. Pandora finds the most
similar ones and sends them to your station.
Whether your entire iTunes collection fits on an iPod
Shuffle with room to spare or you just want to discover dif
ferent music you know you'll like, check out Pandora. In
no time, you'll have graduated from a top-40 junkie to a
knowledgeable music fanatic and be able to create your
own collection.
