## Roxy Sass Does Herself 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SELF SEXER 
Thisweek'sthemeof'*Do It Yourself'was
11uule for Roxv! Nowhere is safe for The

Sass — even / blush a bit when I
think about that time on a bench in
front of Mirrielees.
But doing it yourself, by
• yourself, is not nearly as much fun
as adding a plus one! Couples often
fail to utilize the best tool in their
sexual arsenal — their knowledge
of their own bodies. Why did you
spend countless lonely years hon
ing your Hand Solo skills if not to
prepare for the moment when
you could share your exper
tise with your mate? (Even
Roxy can't resist Star Wars allu
sions—it's her time-tested
way of getting C'S majors to
read her column.)
Roxy knows that having
the chutzpah to share how you
like to do-it-yourself with some
one else is sometimes easier said
than done. I picture you. dear
reader, thinking up a storm of
objections to my suggestion:
What if what turns me on is
weird and creeps my partner out?
What if my mate is offended by my
tips? What if I make the situation re
ally awkward by stumbling over my
own guidance? 1 don't even know
what I like — how am I supposed to
tell someone else?

Reasonable worries, but
here's the bottom line: The best
way to end up satisfied is to
know how to sal isfy yourself and
not to be shy about showing and
telling your partner. You aren't
shv about raising your hand in

class, and you shouldn't
he shv about lowering it,
either. This is you and
your partner's sexual edu
cation that we're talking
about here.
Now that Roxy
has you on-board, she's
ready to get juicy.
Step one is mas
tering self-love single
handedly. If you live in a
triple, mini-double or

some other hideously-effective-at-cockblock
ing-your-ass configuration, pick a time when
your roommates will be out for awhile. If this
never happens. I suggest planning for late at
night when everyone is sound asleep.What
your roomies don't know won't hurt them.
Trust me — I lived in a triple for two years. If
that seems too devious, just be straight and

tell your roomies that
you'd like some alone
time in the room. You
don't have to say that
you'll be using the time
to masturbate I once
had a friend who asked
to have 20 minutes a
day to meditate alone in
her triple. No one ever
questioned her. but.
now that I think about
it.
In preparation for
your know-thyself jour
ney. make a trip to the
SI I PRC . and don't just
grab free condoms.
Itiev have more lube

than a Theta wrestling match, and no one
seems to take advantage of this. Just make
sure to stay away from K-Y Brand. It might he
a household name. but. in my experience, it
dries out faster than nail polish remover. II
you're feeling ambitious, we live about 40
minutes awa\ from the sex toy Mecca of the
world. San Francisco has everything from
Good Vibrations, the Cadillac of sex shops, to
a store on Castro St. that sells eco-friendly vi
brators. If you're feeling lazy or covert, you
can even buy goodies from Amazon.com.
Most of my male readers will have
skimmed over the above section.

thinking that they figured
it all out in sixth grade.

But, men. I disagree —
I bet that you're ex
perts at speed, there-

suit of year&of furtive
ly getting it done be
fore someone knocked

on your door. But do you
know how to take it slow? If

you've got a partner at hand,
speed is such a waste — unless

you're at the Rodin garden, in
which case I applaud you. Second-

ly. from my experience, many men
don't know how to mix it up. If you've
been cetting off the same way since

you wore 12, you're not really enjoying all of
the possible fruits of your efforts.
Step two is all about sharing the fruits of
such efforts. To introduce the topic, you can
try saying something like. "Doyou know what
I do when I'm thinking about you and we
aren't together?" If you're in the mood and
want to learn from your partner, two highly

:ky substance you'll be covered

successful phrases from my experience are
"Want to play show and tell'.'" and"I really
want to please you — want to show me how
you like it?"

Talking with your partner is
helpful, but I'm a visual learn
er. and very thorough studies
show that 100% of my partners
have been 100. And. by all
means, if you'd like your part-

ner to lend a hand, let him or
her know. Possibly the
hottest moment of my life
mirrored that scene in the

movie "Ghost." but instead
of working together on
Demi Moore's ugly ce
ramic pots, we worked on
each other. Oh my God
— thai was a nicht!
