## Emoticons: punctuation as communication? 
### 
I have a love-hate relationship
with the emoticon. While I flirted
briefly with emoticons in middle
school, by high school the trend had
gone out of fashion. Here at Stan
ford. they're back in. and I'm not
happy.
Just last year, the emoticon — a
spectrum of smileys, that elusive trio
of colon, dash and parenthesis —
turned 25.This linguistic quirk,creat
ed by a C'S professor at Carnegie
Mellon, has survived AOL,Y2K,and
an entire information revolution.
Much as 1 hate it to admit it.it looks
like the emoticon is here to stay.
Hie psychology behind emoti
cons is pretty straightforward:
frowning parentheses, winking semi
colons. the kiss of an asterisk — all
try to take the place of the facial ex
pressions absent from our online
conversations.
llianks to hormonal surges and
mood swings, our age group just
can't get enough of emoticons; after
all. sarcasm and sexual innuendo are
the stuff of our existence. And the
college dynamic, rich with awkward
acquaintances and ambiguously sex
ual relationships, is fertile soil for
emoticons. But there's deeper mean
ing beneath the surface. What we
don't realize is that, when we use
emoticons, we are wearing our
hearts — or in this case, our faces —
on our sleeves.
At a place like Stanford, most stu
dents have a small circle of close
friends, surrounded by a larger net
work of friendly acquaintances.
Facebook's strength — and a reason
behind much of its success — is that
it offers us a way to build and main
tain these acquaintances. Yes. we
write on the walls of our closest
friends, but we also post notes to po
tential friends: people we meet at
parties or in section, friends of our
friends — even victims of our bike
collisions. A smilev comes across as

friendly and kind; a wink makes us
seem playful, even flirtatious. A
frown expresses sadness from a sep
aration. We aren't the smoothest of
operators: Facebook takes away the
social pressures that normally
drench us in sweat.
Now, stir in our bizarre student
romances. Fearing misinterpreta
tion. we use the emoticon as a pre
cautionary measure. When we don't
have the courage to put ourselves
out there, we construct those half
jokes, half-come-ons, and punctuate
them with a wink:
A: we really need to go see superbad
again'.'u up for it?
B: of course! you?me?a dark the
ater? who knows what could hap
pen? ;)
There is no secret decoder ring
for emoticons, no Rosetta stone for
our interpretation. There is no need:
emoticons don't just express emo
tion — they express a desperate de
sire to be liked. When 1 look back to
posts at the beginning of freshman
year, emoticons are everywhere. In
each individual thread, as the friend
ship grows deeper, the emoticons
gradually fade away. An emoticon
user may want your friendship; they
might be the kind of person who
needs to feel liked by everyone. But
chances are — and let's be honest
here — they probably just want to
get into your pants.
