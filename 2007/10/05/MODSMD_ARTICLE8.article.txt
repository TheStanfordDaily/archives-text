Stanford's Head
Barbecuer tells of Farm
Earthquake

"Why.the ground shook and bent the
eucalyptus trees right down to the
ground. Yes, sir. I certainly saw those
pearly gates swing open to let me in
the night of the Stanford earthquake
and I heard them playing "Hand me
Down my Walking Cane."
The voice of Sam McDonald, negro
superintendent of buildings and
grounds for the B.A.C and unofficial
head barbecuing chef for the cam

pus, rang with a laugh through his lit
tle field office. Sam spread his long
boned arms to demonstrate how the
trees bent and in so doing he nearly
touched the ceiling. Sam is tall, stand
ing nearly b feet.
Yes. I went through the Ob quake. I
came to Stanford way back in 1903
and began working on a campus con
struction gang. I was a night watch
man at the time of the quake and had
just turned in when the ground start
ed shakin'. I guess the water tap in
my bathroom busted, but when I was
joggled awake and saw the water
floating under the door. I thought for
sure we had dropped off into the
ocean."
