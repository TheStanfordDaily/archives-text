## Hail, Stanford commercials, hail New television spots highlight Stanford inventions, irreverence 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
In the middle of Stanford Football's 41-3
blowout loss to Arizona State last Saturday, fans
at Stanford Stadium, and those watching on Fox
Sports Net. paused — not just for a third-quarter
timeout — but for a marshmallow in a mi
crowave.
As a marshmallow bunny bubbled and bloated
on screen, a nonchalant voiceover described how
"the people of Stanford University answer the
call" of the arts and sciences to invent technology
such as the microwave — which is why, the
voiceover finishes,"!fail. Stanford, Hail."
Not the typical commercial break for a football
game — let alone the typical ad for a university
--"Klystron lube" is one of three "Hail. Stan
ford. 11ail" commercials that promote the Cardi
nal during televised athletic events.The other two
are "FM Synthesizer," which features a wild
haired keyboardist rocking out to FM waves, and
"Laser Technology." which features a cat chasing
a red laser pointer.
In stark contrast, past years' TV campaigns
have featured singular commercials showing
glimpses of the Oval, campus events and student
life. Noticing similar ads from colleges across the
nation, Stanford officials were looking for some
thing that would "rise above the clutter," accord
ing to Kate Chesley. information editor for Uni
versity Communications.
"Most college institutional promotional mes
sages are very predictable and follow a very simi
lar format," Chesley said. "We were looking for
something different so we could better compete
for the attention of alumni, students and others
watching Cardinal sports."

Stanford put out a call for ad proposals earlier
this year. Of the four that responded, it was West
Hollywood-based Dailey & Associates,, headed
by Stanford Business School alum Bruce Miller,
that received the bid.
"The people we met with were open-minded
to breaking out and doing something different
that befitted the school's unique character,"
Miller said. "We did it and they bought it."
Dailey & Associates' creative team of Michael
Miller, Tom Cordner and Will Lau took on the
project and, after looking through Stanford's Web
archives, decided to highlight in particular its in
novative achievements.
"Looking around, we learned about the irrev
erent personality Stanford has," Michael Miller
said. "We also found, though, that Stanford's re
sponsible for a lot of cool things, including some
technology that people use every day."
Putting the two together, the Dailey team
thought it could have a winning combination of
entertainment and enlightenment.
"We saw that. 'Hey, there's a potential match

up here, taking a very serious invention from
Stanford and marrying it with a very irreverent
tone that is uniquely Stanford,'" Bruce Miller
said.
From a list of Stanford inventions that includ
ed fMRI, the Stanford-Binet 10 test and GPS sys
tems, Miller, Lau and Cordner decided upon the
three that had the most practical, everyday uses:
the klystron tube (microwave), the FM synthesiz
er and the laser.
"A lot of universities talk about how their ideas
'have changed the world.'" Cordner said. "It's all
overblown — talking about their community, re
search and diversity — and it's all the same; no
matter what university it is. it's just a bunch of
white noise."
"We wanted to show that Stanford doesn't
take itself too seriously, but at the same time it re
ally does have ideas that have changed the
world," he added.
Now, beyond the "white'noise" of most univer
sity commercials, the "Hail. Stanford. Hail" com
mercials have met with the noise of laughter and
applause and achieved a following at football
games, on dorm email lists and on the viral Web
site for the videos, hailstanford.stanford.edu.
Visitors to the site can not only watch the ads
on repeat, but also share, download or embed the
commercials on a Web site. Among that web audi
ence is Diana Jaffe '09.
"I like the commercials because they're really
random and they show that not even the adminis
tration takes itself very seriously," she said. "It
shows they have a sense of humor, even if it is a lit
tle weird."
While not involved in the making of the com
mercials, Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Julie Lythcott-Haims '89 said she was "si
multaneously stunned and thrilled" when she first
saw the commercials premiere at home football
games.
