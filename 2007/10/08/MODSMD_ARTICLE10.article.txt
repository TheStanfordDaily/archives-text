## SCIENCE & TECH Course Work problems mar new release Administrators move quickly to resolve first-week hiccups 
### KAMIL DADA 
University technicians have taken
steps to alleviate problems plaguing the
new and improved Course Work system.
Director of Academic Computing Lois
Bois told The Daily in an email last Fri
day. Hie site, which allows students to
access course information and materials
online, underwent a significant overhaul
this summer, but some of the site's regu
lar features have been slow and ineffi
cient despite the updates.
"The specific issue causing the prob
lem with Course Work was the number
of simultaneous logins," Bois said in ref
erence to complaints about the site dur
ing the past two weeks. "When hun
dreds of students and faculty tried to
login at once, Course Work could not
manage the load needed to verify users
and present the right information."
This increased traffic strained the
system beyond capacity, preventing
many students from logging on to view
assignments and register for sections.
"One time I couldn't sign up for my
section class," said Ari Weiss "11, "and
another it was so slow I could not view
my homework."
"During the first couple of days, I
once spent the whole night trying to
load the page, and it would continuous
ly time out." said Ana Hernandez Ml.
"For instance, for my Econ 1A class,
the assignment had been posted on
Coursework and 1 was unable to re
trieve it."
Irritation with the site extended
to faculty as well.
"Course Work was not working
at the start of the term, which was
very frustrating," said Philosophy
Prof. Alexis Burgess.
Responding to these complaints,
the Course Work team "made sever
al changes overnight to allow more
users to login at the same time," Bois
said.
"We sincerely apologize for the
inconvenience to students and fac
ulty," she added.
Although the implementation of
the new system has been attended
by problems.an upgrade for Course
work— which is used by approxi
mately 900 classes and 12.000 facul
ty and students each quarter — was
long overdue.
"The aging software was increas
ingly difficult to maintain and keep
running." said Bois, who mentioned
that the bulk of the Course Work ap
plication was written in the late
1990s and early 2(XX)s.
Despite early difficulties, the re
vised site offers many new features
to users. A "Drop Box" tool allows
students to post homework assign
ments and faculty members to hand
buck commented papers with ease.
While technicians continue to
improve current problems, both stu
dents and faculty do appreciate as
pects of the site.
"I find it extremely useful, espe
cially in my metaphysics class where
students don't even need to buy a
course reader," Burgess said. "All
the material is posted online."
