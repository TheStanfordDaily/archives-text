## SCIENCE & TECH Course Work problems mar new release Administrators move quickly to resolve first-week hiccups 
### KAMIL DADA 
University technicians have taken
steps to alleviate problems plaguing the
new and improved Course Work system.
Director of Academic Computing Lois
Bois told The Daily in an email last Fri
day. Hie site, which allows students to
access course information and materials
online, underwent a significant overhaul
this summer, but some of the site's regu
lar features have been slow and ineffi
cient despite the updates.
"The specific issue causing the prob
lem with Course Work was the number
of simultaneous logins," Bois said in ref
erence to complaints about the site dur
ing the past two weeks. "When hun
dreds of students and faculty tried to
login at once, Course Work could not
manage the load needed to verify users
and present the right information."
This increased traffic strained the
system beyond capacity, preventing
many students from logging on to view
assignments and register for sections.
"One time I couldn't sign up for my
section class," said Ari Weiss "11, "and
another it was so slow I could not view
my homework."
"During the first couple of days, I
once spent the whole night trying to
load the page, and it would continuous
ly time out." said Ana Hernandez Ml.
