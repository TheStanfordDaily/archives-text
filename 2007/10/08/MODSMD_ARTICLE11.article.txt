# Rally against Burma oppression
## Speakers highlight human rights abuses, urge students to petition for intervention 
### SUSANA MONTES 
Students and community members gathered at White Plaza
last Friday to peacefully rally in support of victims of military op
pression in Burma.
The event was organized by at least seven students in cooper
ation with the student group Buddhist Community at Stanford.
Last week, the group also circulated flyers in White Plaza in
hopes of spreading awareness of human rights abuse by the coun
try's ruling dictatorship.
The organizers of the rally crafted a student petition request
ing that the Chinese government step in and help resolve the sit
uation in Burma.
"If the world doesn't act, Burma is doomed," Nick Harmony,
a human rights activist, told the assembled crowd. 1 larmony, who
is also a board member of the Burmese American Democratic

Alliance, has traveled to Burma 16 times over the past 26 years
to work with pro-democracy leaders in the country.
"Right now, I have numerous friends in jail and as for many
of them," he said, "I don't even know what their current situa
tion is."
During past weeks, the news of massacres of monks, brutal
beatings on streets and worse have been coming out of Burma.
Hie demonstrations led by monks are the largest the country has
seen in almost 20 years, and many believe they may have the po
tential to topple the regime.
"There is so much that people can take," said Michael Nagler.
professor emeritus at UC-Berkeley and founder of the Universi
ty's Peace & Conflict Studies Program.
"When people decide they want their freedom, nothing can
stop them. Burmese have been suffering from this military dicta
torship for almost half a century, and before that, they were very
brutally handled by the Japanese, and before that, by the British.
1 think they have just decided that their time has come."

goon by night and the number of
protesters who have been arrested
and beaten by the military junta
these past weeks is still unknown.
Harmony said.
Some media outlets have re
ported that at least 10 people have
been killed in the pro-democracy
protests, but the number is feared
to be significantly higher.
Burmese students who turned
out for the event expressed con
cern for family and friends who re
main in their home country.
"1 was able to speak briefly with
my cousin and she told me how her
friends were getting arrested." said
one junior, who requested
anonymity for fear of retaliation
against her relatives. "My family is
afraid and staying home."
Speakers urged students to par
ticipate in further non-violent ral
lies and campaigns in favor of in
ternational pressure on the
Burmese junta.

Prof, of Religious Studies Mark
Gonnerman eneouraged students
to act as global citizens in an inter
connected world. He is the
founder and director of the Aurora
Forum, an on-campus initiative to
promote discussion of current is
sues.
"Our wearing red today is one
way we may begin to more fully
identify ourselves with those who
suffer political and economic in
justice." Gonnerman said. "We
must learn to relate ourselves to
the people who suffer injustices
that stem from our ways of life in
this overdeveloped world."
Gonnerman invited students to
learn to emulate the non-violent
actions of the monks and nuns of
Burma during the past weeks.
"In this incredibly rich resource
institution, we must unblinkingly
learn to examine and think about
our part in the world." Gonnerman
said. "Study non-violence here at
Stanford... let's talk to people
about the ways we can build the
world we would all like to live in."
