# Rally against Burma oppression
## Speakers highlight human rights abuses, urge students to petition for intervention 
### SUSANA MONTES 
Students and community members gathered at White Plaza
last Friday to peacefully rally in support of victims of military op
pression in Burma.
The event was organized by at least seven students in cooper
ation with the student group Buddhist Community at Stanford.
Last week, the group also circulated flyers in White Plaza in
hopes of spreading awareness of human rights abuse by the coun
try's ruling dictatorship.
The organizers of the rally crafted a student petition request
ing that the Chinese government step in and help resolve the sit
uation in Burma.
"If the world doesn't act, Burma is doomed," Nick Harmony,
a human rights activist, told the assembled crowd. 1 larmony, who
is also a board member of the Burmese American Democratic

Alliance, has traveled to Burma 16 times over the past 26 years
to work with pro-democracy leaders in the country.
"Right now, I have numerous friends in jail and as for many
of them," he said, "I don't even know what their current situa
tion is."
During past weeks, the news of massacres of monks, brutal
beatings on streets and worse have been coming out of Burma.
Hie demonstrations led by monks are the largest the country has
seen in almost 20 years, and many believe they may have the po
tential to topple the regime.
"There is so much that people can take," said Michael Nagler.
professor emeritus at UC-Berkeley and founder of the Universi
ty's Peace & Conflict Studies Program.
"When people decide they want their freedom, nothing can
stop them. Burmese have been suffering from this military dicta
torship for almost half a century, and before that, they were very
brutally handled by the Japanese, and before that, by the British.
1 think they have just decided that their time has come."
