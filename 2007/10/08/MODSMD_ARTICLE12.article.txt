## Bailout keeps Times, Merc in dining halls Funding from the Provost's Office enables SNRP to supply papers 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Despite narrowly losing its ASSU special fees
vote last spring, the Stanford News Readership Pro
gram (SNRP) has secured funding from University
administrators to continue providing free newspa
pers in dining halls and newsstands across campus.
The six year-old program was bailed out in part
by $15,000 in funding from the Provost's Office
matched with funds from the Undergraduate Sen
ate. the Vice Provost of Student Affairs and its own
reserve money, Aaron Quyami *09, president of the
program, told The Daily in an email.
The program also cut costs by eliminating dis
tribution to the graduate community, which
strongly voted against the SNRP's special fees re
quest.
Although the SNRP received 67.57 percent of
the undergraduate vote, it fell short of the requisite
endorsement by 15 percent of the total student pop
ulation. both graduate and undergraduate. SNRP
advocates cited two reasons for the shortfall, the
first being an unexpected lack of support from the
graduate community. The second, according to
ASSU Senator Stuart Baimel 09, was acronym am
biguity.
"The main problem is that undergrads didn't
vote for it in the highest numbers because they did
n't know what SNRP stands for," said Baimel, who
also writes a column for The Daily. I le added that if
the group's name had better conveyed its purpose,
it would have received more votes.
Baimel also cited discontent among Row House
residents, who do not receive a share
of the S(K) copies of ITie New York
Times or the bIH) copies of the San
Jose Mercury News papers distrib
uted on campus Monday through
Friday. I le said the group is address
ing the problem, and copies are
available at the quad and at a few
other locations besides dining halls.
Provost John Etchemendy was
"very sympathetic" to the program's
requests for emergency funding, said
Baimel, who attended a meeting
with the Provost and leaders of the
SNRP.
Seeing that the group fell just
short of gaining the necessary en
dorsement. Etchemendy agreed to
help the group for this year only,
Baimel said.
According to Baimel. this is not
the first time the Provost has helped
a student group that lost special fees,
although he could not name any

other group specifically.
In addition to funding from the
Provost, the SNRP will also draw on
unused special fees from previous
years.
"The way special fees works is
that groups rarely spend all the
money that they ask for, so groups
build up large reserve accounts,"
Baimel said.
But reserves were not enough to
keep SNRP afloat and, though the
Provost is making up the difference
this year, his office will not be sup
plementing next year's fees, Quyami
wrote.
"Me made it very clear that this
was something his office pretty
much never does." Quvami wrote.
"[H]is response to student groups
who ask for 'bailouts' is always. If
your group deserves our funding,
then why couldn't you get enough
votes.'"
I le said the SNRP will be back on
the special fees ballot next spring,
though for undergraduates only.
