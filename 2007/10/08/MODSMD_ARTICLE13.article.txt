## Editorial Board Stanford fans: A force of their own 
### 
It may be the Stanford sporting news of
the Century. Everyone will remember
where they were when they heard the
improbable result: Stanford 2*4, USC 23.
Some casual Cardinal fans caught a glimpse
of the score while checking the Internet.
Only a handful of people saw the game on
the fringe cable network Versus, which the
standard Stanford cable package does not
carry.
A group of fraternity boys watched the
upset in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon lounge. A
few freshmen huddled around a TV showing
streaming video from the Internet in the
Paloma lounge. The Stanford Orchestra, on
a retreat in Sonoma County, had their re
hearsal interrupted with news streaming
from an iPhone. And a couple hundred die
hard Stanford students will remember
watching the game live at the L.A. Colise
um. where they traveled despite Las Vegas
odds-makers' predictions of a 41-point (JSC
romp.
Lost in the midst of all the well-deserved
accolades for head coach Jim I Larbaugh and
his never-say-die team is a different kind of
win: a victory by the Stanford fans who have
had little to cheer for over the last few years.
On the field in L.A., the football team
showed its ability to beat anyone. But back
on campus in the aftermath of the victory,
the Red Zone fan club made a statement of
its own.
Within minutes of Ho McNally's game
clinching interception, campus was abuzz
with cell phones, text messages and wallposts.
Students informing each other of the news,
SoCal natives berating their friends at USC.
and the generally insane, senseless, dumb
founded merriment that followed the victory.
The sound of speakers blasting an LSJUMB
rendition of "All Right Now" could be heard
wafting over the empty Tresidder parking lot.
"Red Zone" and "We Believe"shirts that had
been in mothballs for months emerged all
over campus. But something else was in the
air, something new and hard to quantify: the
nascent beginnings of a school spirit with a
mind of its own and spontaneity refreshingly
new to campus.
Less than an hour after the Cardinal
shocked the college football world with
what some pundits have called the biggest
upset in the history of the sport, Stanford
fans were asking the question: what next?
Would the excitement simmer momentarily

and then boil away in the face of impending
problem sets and resume deadlines? Or
would the campus turn dark and dangerous,
with the game sparking a riot reminiscent of
those that make state schools so distin
guished in this regard, replete with burning
cars, overturned golf-carts and $20,000 palm
trees set ablaze?
Instead, Cardinal Nation achieved a
happy — in fact, an ecstatic — medium.
There were isolated incidents of arson: a
flyer kiosk set on fire near the Clock Tower
and police reports of a smoldering trash can
or two. But campus excitement was a force
all its own. No administrator or athletic de
partment official told any fans what to do or
where to assemble. Soon the crowd reached
critical mass and marched for the Ouad. A
keg was rolled down, and a small cardboard
bonfire was set alight. A guitar made its way
to the circle of revelers, leading to an
acoustic version of "All Right Now" and sev
eral impromptu chants. While some flaming
pieces of newsprint billowed dangerously
close to the palm trees, no one was hurt and
fire department officials extinguished it
mostly without incident.
But the fans' enthusiasm was nowhere
near extinguished, and students, faculty,
alums and administrators alike gathered to
give the players a heroes' welcome at
Maples Pavilion shortly after midnight. Ad
ministrators and student leaders loosely or
ganized the event, sending out emails to
staff members and students, but news of the
reception party spread like wildfire across
campus. The energy outside Maples was or
ganic, created not by Yell Leaders, Dean
Julie (God bless her) or even the Band, but
by the outpouring of students themselves.
And as the football players filed off the bus
into the dancing crowd they were celebrat
ing not only an incomprehensible football
victory, but a victory for all fans in Cardinal
Nation, from 50-year veterans of Cardinal
sports all the way down to international stu
dents just learning the arcane rules of Amer
ican football.
So here's to Stanford Football, and to the
explosion of school spirit that one mam
moth win sparked. I lere's to the possibility
of a sellout on Saturday against TCU. And
here's to the emergence of a spontaneous,
student-led school spirit that celebrates re
sponsibly and with vigor. And here's to win
ning Big Game: Cal, you nuys are next.
