# Students Illustrated
## Closeting identity 
### 
It took me about a year before 1 found
out Chris was gay. and that was no mis
take. The revealing of his identity hap
pened through a slow trickle of information
in the form of passing conversations about
school and gossiping about mutual friends.
I was, and still am. impressed by his quiet
strength, his warmth, and his thoughtful
ness. So. on a campus full of identity
strengthening organizations and students
who openly tout their various affiliations,
why did it take me so long to figure out that
Chris is gay?
Chris' hesitation to mention his sexual
orientation has to do with the label "gay"
and its associated connotations, (Jay does
n't simply mean being an individual who is
attracted to members of the same gender.
In our society riddled with stereotypes,
being gay also implies "flamboyant" and
sometimes "butch." And, as a recent visit to
a gay bookstore in the Castro reminded me,
snx.
Even during conversations at home
about gay issues, my homophobic stepfa
ther reminds me that "gay men are promis
cuous."
With such widespread stereotypes, it's
no surprise that Chris makes a conscious
decision to define his identity independent
ly from his sexual orientation. Personal re
lationships with straight men present a
challenge. Chris notes a consistent pattern:
1) Meet. 2) Introductions. Chris reveals
he's gay too soon. 4) Straight male assumes
he has nothing in common with ( hris, then
ceases to develop a deeper relationship. But
Chris isn't flamboyant, and he certainly
doesn't exude the excessive sexuality that
society would expect of him.
When it comes down to it.gay hyper-sex
ualization doesn't represent Chris or most
gay men. This stereotype is an unfortunate
outcome resulting from conditions of the
gay experience. So. what does represent the
gay community?
Those who unite under the LGB I' ban
ner come from a variety of backgrounds.
Geographically, culturally, and socio-eco
nomically. they represent every variation

possible, riven political diversity exists
within the gay community. In the 2004
election, following Bush's proposition to
add a gay marriage ban to the constitution,
one out of four individuals identifying as
homosexual voted for Bush. A community
is defined as a group of people brought to
gether by a common location, interest, or
belief. With such a diverse membership, the
only thing uniting these individuals is a
common sexual orientation. Intrinsic to
sexual orientation is sex; and it is sex. not
sexual orientation, that becomes the com
mon denominator in conversations in and
about the gay community. As a result, the
gay community finds its basis steeped
largely in sex.
However, before it seems as if this basis
for gay community seems exclusive to gay
culture, let me draw a parallel to straight
male culture. One needs to look no further
than mainstream entertainment such as
"The Man Show" to find an example that
exemplifies a community similarly based on
sex. For example, this show, specifically de
signed to appeal to the title audience
(men), features bikini clad women bounc
ing on trampolines as mascots. It seems
popular media agrees that sex unites all
straight men, so uniting the gay community
with sex is just another extension of this
phenomenon. However, this unifying ele
ment remains a gross caricature of gay cul
ture.
Chris hopes that some other cause will
emerge from the gay community to unite its
members. Perhaps gay activism or political as
pirations. But comparing a cross section of the
straight community and the gay community
