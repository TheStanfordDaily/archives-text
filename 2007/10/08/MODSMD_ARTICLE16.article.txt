# Little Ms. Modern
## Love and hate in architecture 
### 
A significant feature of modern architec
ture is that most people who aren't in
the architecture field seem to hate it. I
was an architecture student as an undcrgrad,
and an aspiring architecture student before
that, so it's a bit hard for me to relate. I faked a
love for modernism long before it was indoc
trinated into me by my schooling, so I can't
even remember what hating it is like. Instead,
vinyl siding, decorative ceiling beams, ;md
frankly almost all of the neo-historicism
sprawling across the American landscape are
vomit-inducing for me. (Yes. it's a hard life.)
1 lovvever, nearly every non-architect I con
verse with wants to know why prominent pro
fessionals in my field insist on designing such
ugly buildings. And 1 am highly suspicious that
anyone who does tell me he values contempo
rary design is actually just a vapid hipster. (At
parties: "So whal do you study?" "Architec
ture." "Cool. I'm, like, totally into architecture.
Especially, like, modern buildings or whatev
er." Awkward silence.)
Case study: my undergraduate university
featured a campus dense with the work of top
name designers of the last century: Alvar
Aalto. Hero Saarinen. I.M. Pci. Steven I 1011.
Frank Gehry. It was architectural heaven!
However, to my frustration, nearly all of my
classmates pined for an old-fashioned, park
like quad lined with brick colonials enveloped
in greenery. It didn't help that a certain Ivy
League school down the street had many such
quads to envy (which, by the way, I found at
best banal and at worst oppressive and falla

cious in their unnatural serenity). And because
I was an architecture major, many of my ac
quaintances thought it appropriate to convey
to me just how much they despised our campus
(and preferred the other). Perhaps they hoped
that such information would allow me to pre
vent similar catastrophes in the future.
No such luck, dear former classmates!
I lowever, 1 must acknowledge that all this ha
tred and disgust certainly does put me, as a fu
ture architect, in an interesting position. After
all. I'm still idealistic enough to want to build
places that people enjoy occupying, but I also
need to uphold my own standards of beauty.
Since four years of architecture school devel
ops a hearty capacity for stubbornness and
egomania in its students. I doubt I'll be con
vinced to compromise my opinions.Therefore,
it seems that the best course of action is to per
suade the public that a genuine appreciation
for modern design can even enhance the expe
rience of modern life. A Herculean task, but
perhaps this column is a reasonable place to
start.
So.new Stanford colleagues.from this point

forward I'll he writing to you on a weekly basis
about modernity. I assume some of you arc
rolling your eyes by this point. Don't worry, it
isn't nearly as pretentious as it sounds —
modernity pervades our existence in all kinds
of unassuming, ordinary ways. I"he kinds of
food we cat, the means by which we entertain
ourselves, and the ways we do or don't have sex
are all intrinsic products of the modern condi
tion. I'm not promising to necessarily cover all
of these topics, but I will do my best toconvince
you that we are inescapably modern people
who must confront the modern world. And of
course, I'll try todoso in witty,self-deprecating
prose peppered with universally relatable yet
personal anecdotes so as to hold your atten
tion through eight hundred words.
Shall we get back to architecture? Hie good
news is that some of the buildings you hate re
ally arc regrettable. I'm not asking you to love
every soulless concrete box that's come out of
the modern movement. Many failures have
emerged alongside the successes in mod
ernism. and we architecture-types do not ex
actly hesitate to point them out. No, we adore
unadulterated snobbery, and we entertain our
selves to an embarrassing degree by vilifying
the failures: "Oh my. how repulsive: panelized
brick — what was he thinking!?" You, too,can
join in on the bitchfest; it's fun! Appreciating
modern design allows for a healthy dose of dis
approval. both substantive and petty. In fact,
modernism requires criticism to continue to
