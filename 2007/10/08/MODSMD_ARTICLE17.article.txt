Sex assault support available on campus
We thank The Daily for bringing attention
to the largely under-reported crime of sexual
assault on college campuses nationwide. ITie
decision to report is a difficult and complicat
ed one — especially when you know your as
sailant, as is the case in the vast majority of col
lege assaults.
During the last two years, a primary goal of
Stanford's Sexual Violence Advisory Board
(SVAH). aided by a grant from the Depart
ment of Criminal Justice, has been to remove
barriers to reporting incidents of sexual vio
lence. relationship abuse and stalking. Stan
ford actively encourages survivors of these
crimes to report and receive support by utiliz
ing campus resources. We would like to thank
the individuals who have stepped forward to
receive support, and in one way or another, re
ported what happened to them.
We would like to take this opportunity to re

mind all members of our community (students,
faculty.staff. partners and visitors alike) that you
have many options to receive support and re
sources in the aftermath of an assault. No mat
ter what the circumstances, it is never the sur
vivor's fault. Sexual aggression or violence is a
choice on the part of the perpetrator.
Our Web site, http://www.stanford.edu/
group/svab/, addresses education, support and
resources. Ihe site also has a special feature that
outlines the benefits of various reporting op
tions so the survivor can match his/her needs to
the type of reporting. If a survivor, or person that
knows about the assault,does not wish to make
an official report, we encourage them to fill out
a "notification" form, either online on the Web
site, or downloaded and mailed in. Identifying
information is not necessary.
In addition to campus resources, our com
munity agency partners, the YWCA Sexual
Assault Center at Stanford, and the Center for
Relationship Abuse Awareness (CRAA).

offer our community 1(H) percent confidential
services. We encourage any student, staff or
faculty member who experiences an assault to
contact the YVVCA 24-hour crisis hotline
(650-725-W55) or visit their office at Vaden,
Monday to Thursday, 2 4 p.m. Relationship
abuse concerns can be addressed at CRAA at
736-2276.
Survivors are most likely to tell a trusted
friend about the incident II someone tells you
that they were hurt or abused by someone hut
they are not sure what they want to do about
it. here is our advice for the most important
words you can say to encourage the survivor
to move forward:
I'm sorry this happened In yon. Its not your
fault someone hurt von. How can / help? Stan
ford has good resources to support yon and to
help you make informed choices l.et's look at
Stanford's sexual violence Web site together, or
call the YWCA/CRAA.
If you would like more informa
tion about how to get involved, have
suggestions or would like postcards
advertising our Web site, please email
Sally Baird at sbaird@stanford.edu.

Admins' role in Gaieties
misleading
Thursday's article "Admins re
view Gaieties" grossly mischaracter
ized the review process and the roles
of both [Student Affairs Officer in
the Office of Student Activites]
Nanci Howe and Dean [of Fresh
men and Transfer Students] Julie
[Lythcott-Haims'B9] in that process.
The first and most glaring error is

the idea that Ihe writers "were re
quired to show the whole script" to
members of the administration.
While a correction has already been
published, 1 wish to make it doubly
clear that this process was not some
thing we were forced into or simply
agreed with, but one that we actual
ly initiated. Having had some prob
lems with the script last year, we
wished to be proactive in avoiding a
similar situation this year, and there
fore decided to discuss the script
with several members of the admin
istration.
The amount of time and effort
put in by Dean Julie, Nanci Howe,
and others has been greatly appre
ciated and their comments have
been incredibly insightful. While
we only made a few changes as a re
sult of their comments, 1 am glad
that we did address some of the is
sues they raised. Additionally, it
should be said that we were not in
any way compelled to make any of
these changes, and chose not to do
so in several cases. Nonetheless, the

input and the alternate perspective
of the administration is what we
wanted to get from this process, and
I think we were successful in that
respect.
Additionally, I am disappointed
that The Daily chose to publish a
story that was based on little more
than hearsay and comments from
those only marginally related to the
process. Chade Severin '07. the
Head Writer who was interviewed,
made it clear in her interview that
while she was highly involved with
the editing of the script, she knew
relatively little about the actual re
view process. The story was pub
lished before any of us more inti
mately involved were able to com
ment. and therefore did not reflect
the reality of the way the script was
reviewed, nor the reasons behind
the review. 1 hope that this letter will
set the record straight on this issue
and clarifies any misconceptions
perpetuated by the article.

Additionally, I am disappointed
that The Daily chose to publish a
story that was based on little more
than hearsay and comments from
those only marginally related to the
process. Chade Severin '07. the
Head Writer who was interviewed,
made it clear in her interview that
while she was highly involved with
the editing of the script, she knew
relatively little about the actual re
view process. The story was pub
lished before any of us more inti
mately involved were able to com
ment. and therefore did not reflect
the reality of the way the script was
reviewed, nor the reasons behind
the review. 1 hope that this letter will
set the record straight on this issue
and clarifies any misconceptions
perpetuated by the article.
