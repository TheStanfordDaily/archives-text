## TWO MINUTE DRILL 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
PLAYER OF THE GAME: Lots of candidates
here, but redshirt sophomore quar
terback Tavita Pritchard gets the
nod. Named the starter last Sunday
after T.C. Ostrander suffered a
seizure, Pritchard deftly guided an
offense that hadn't scored a touch
down in nine straight quarters into
the end zone twice in the final peri
od. I lis mobility,poise and decision
making kept Stanford from surren
dering to a talented USC defense,
and his gutsy fourth-down conver
sions on the final drive were the
stuff of legends.
PLAY OF THE GAME With crowd noise ob
scuring the call from the sideline,
Pritchard called his own play in the
huddle on fourth-and-20 from the
USC 29-yard line. Me found sopho
more wideout Richard Sherman
open over the middle for first down
yardage, who held on despite get
iing hit by three USC defenders.
The play stood upon review and al
lowed the Cardinal to score the
game-winning touchdown four
plays later.
TURNING POINT Facing fourth-and-goal

from the Stanford I at the end of the
first half, USC ran a power play to
the right side. Nick Sanchez blasted
inside the blockers and stuffed USC
tailback Chauncey Washington for
no gain, and the Trojans went into
the locker room clinging to a 9-0
lead, serenaded by boos from the
seething Los Angeles crowd.
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT In beating USC —
the preeminent program in college
football today — Stanford broke a
five-game Pac-10 losing streak, a
two-game slide this year and a 35-
game winning streak for USC at
home. The Cardinal played with a
strong team ethic,out-executing the
Trojans and making every late
game play necessary to secure the
victory.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT: Stanford's defense
gave up big plays on play-action
passes, including a 47-yard touch
down to Ronald Johnson.
KEY STAT: Stanford was 2-for-2 on
fourth-down conversions, gaining a
combined 30 yards. Both conver
sions came during the game-win
ning drive.
