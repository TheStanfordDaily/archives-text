# Win revives campus
## 
### 
Stanford, a 41-point underdog,
shocked USC 24-23 in quite
possibly college football's
greatest upset ever.
None of the context mattered
much to a student body simply pos
sessed Saturday night. Students lit
erally set the Quad ablaze — light
ing a bonfire that a cheering Fire
Department had to put out — min
utes after the game. Grads and un
dergrads alike prepared to show
frat and Row houses their best par
ties in years that evening and the
football team had its warmest re
ception in memory as it arrived at
Maples Pavilion shortly after mid
night.
You could hear the cry go up in
Tresidder and in dorms across
campus as students fervently re
freshed their laptops and texted
their friends news of Stanford's 17-
point fourth quarter. You could
hear it in the Palo Alto bars as
Tavita Pritchard's fourth-and-goal
pass found Mark Bradford with 49
seconds to go. And when Bo Mc-
Nally intercepted USC's last
heave, you could hear it in the
horns on University Avenue and
around Campus Drive and the
screams in every building in be
tween.
One play, one game, one team
gave this campus more life than
any student here can remember.
With the win. Stanford football

sciousness. "Cardinal Rule" pro

giving Stanford's shocker top on
line hilling over stories on
Medicare billing scams and ongo
ing conflicts in Iraq and the Congo.
The win can't hurt the rest of
Stanford's season. A bowl bid sud
denly seems plausible (though still
unlikely) with TClJ's Homecom
ing visit kicking off the second,
and less difficult, portion of the
2007 season. And the resulting
buzz can't hurt Stanford's recruit
ing — think a few high school stars

might be interested after Satur
day's performance?
Ultimately though. Stanford
football won over a far more im
portant constituency Saturday: its
student body. New stadium, new
coach and New Student Orienta
tion notwithstanding, attendance
had been moving toward an all
time low and apathy an all-time
high.
But that's all changed since the
Cardinal ejected the Trojans from
the driver's seat to the national
title game. Now. Stanford is as pop
ular as ever not just in places like
Columbus. Baton Rouge, or, ironi
cally. Berkeley, but in houses like
Columbae, Branner and Burbank.
On Saturday night, a once
proud college football program
awoke — and the Stanford com
munity has taken notice.
That might just have been the
biggest upset of all.
