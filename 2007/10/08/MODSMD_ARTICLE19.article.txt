# Win revives campus
## 
### 
Stanford, a 41-point underdog,
shocked USC 24-23 in quite
possibly college football's
greatest upset ever.
None of the context mattered
much to a student body simply pos
sessed Saturday night. Students lit
erally set the Quad ablaze — light
ing a bonfire that a cheering Fire
Department had to put out — min
utes after the game. Grads and un
dergrads alike prepared to show
frat and Row houses their best par
ties in years that evening and the
football team had its warmest re
ception in memory as it arrived at
Maples Pavilion shortly after mid
night.
You could hear the cry go up in
Tresidder and in dorms across
campus as students fervently re
freshed their laptops and texted
their friends news of Stanford's 17-
point fourth quarter. You could
hear it in the Palo Alto bars as
Tavita Pritchard's fourth-and-goal
pass found Mark Bradford with 49
seconds to go. And when Bo Mc-
Nally intercepted USC's last
heave, you could hear it in the
horns on University Avenue and
around Campus Drive and the
screams in every building in be
tween.
One play, one game, one team
gave this campus more life than
any student here can remember.
With the win. Stanford football
