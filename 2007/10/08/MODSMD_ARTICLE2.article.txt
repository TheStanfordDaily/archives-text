After senior Derek Belch kicked a 26-yard field goal with 5:43
on the clock to cut the USC lead to 23-17. the Cardinal defensive
unit responded with one of its best series of the contest. A second
down sack by redshirt sophomore Clinton Snyder was followed by
juniorcornerback WopamoOsaisai'sinterception on third-and-19,
giving Stanford's offense the ball on the USC 45.
Pritchard led the Cardinal to the USC 29-yard line, where Stan

utes left in the game.
The young quarterback, starting in place of injured senior T.C.

the 85,125-strong crowd and was forced to make the call himself.
The result was a 20-yard completion to sophomore wide receiver
Richard Sherman — who absorbed a huge hit as he caught the pass
—just inches beyond the first down marker at the USC 9-yard line.
"Coach |Harbaugh] called a playand 1 couldn't really hear him

Pritchard said. "I got the coverage I wanted and found Sherm.
Sherm did a great job getting open on that, and I just hit him."

and missed significant practice time the past two weeks due to the
death of his father. "I see the ball in the air. and I'm just thinking,
'I've got to make this catch"'
With USC' fans screaming in his ear, Pritchard calmly dropped
back into the pocket and lofted a perfect fade pass into the left cor

leapt into the air and made an acrobatic catch, dragging his feet in

game — and after sophomore defensive back Bo McNally's inter

USC s offense pounded away in the first half, outgaining Stan
ford 222-74. but went into the locker room with a slim 9-0 lead. Se
nior cornerback Nick Sanchez stuffed USC tailback Chauncey
Washington on fourth-and-goal inside the three-yard line in the
closing seconds of the first half, and USC jogged off the field to a
chorus of boos —the first of several from an increasingly restless
Trojan crowd.

Yancy, who returned it 31 yards down the sideline for the Cardinal's
first touchdown. It was one of three drive-killing turnovers in the
third quarter that kept USC' from pulling away.
