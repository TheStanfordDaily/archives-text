# Thank you Stanford Football
## 
### 
Thank you, Jim J larbaugh.Thank
you. Tavita Pritchard, Mark
Bradford and Richard Sher
man. Thank you. Clinton Snyder. Nick
Sanchez and everyone else in a Cardi
nal uniform who played hurt. Thank
you to every last individual who set ftx)t
on that Trojan field at the Coliseum to
snap Southern Cal's 35-game home win
streak.
Thank you. because that was more
than just a win to restore some hope in
a moribund program. It was so much
more than Stanford football rising up in
perhaps the biggest upset in college
football history to defeat USC. 24-23. It
was more than a 41-point underdog
toppling the No. 2 team in the nation.
Because Saturday's win didn't just sig
nal the rebirth of a football program.
It signaled the rebirth of an entire
community. Ihe rebirth of a college
sports scene that has been near-dead for
the last three years.
And the really encouraging part? It
didn't seem to take anyone that long to
figure out just how amazing it really
was.
Prom my personal experience of the
night that will be forever remembered
by thousands of Stanford coaches, play
ers. fans, administrators, students and
alumni, the reaction all had a strangely
natural feel to it. Although this year's
seniors had never had anything quite
like this to respond to. and the seniors
who graduated four years ago wouldn't
have either, everyone seemed to know
exactly what to do.
For myself and a handful of friends,
that meant circling campus in a lt X)s
model Subaru, honking like mad and
screaming to anyone who would listen
that USC's perfect season was toast. We

took it upon ourselves to he heralds of
a victor) hardly anyone saw, thanks to
its appearance on a television network
many didn't even know existed.
I'm told it meant a bonfire in the
center of the Quad. As the event wasn't
University-sanctioned, I, of course,
can't personally speak to the veracity
of those accounts. Apparently, howev
er, there were plenty of "R I P U-S-C"
chants, as well as some more colorful
comments that will have to be omitted
from this column. 1 have it from a good
source, though, that when officials
asked who had started the fire, the
overwhelming student response was
"Pete Carroll."
Song ensued.
From the moment thb game was
won on Bradford's sensational touch
down grab to the surreal arrival of the
team at Maples Pavilion, it truly did
seem as if Stanford's campus was trans
formed from its traditional,quiet self to
a real honest-to-goodness Pac-10 uni
versity.
And — surprise —it turns out
that's exactly what this place really is.
One current senior summed up the
emotions of the night following the al
leged bonfire event in the alleged
Quad.
"It was awesome," said Mike
Krieger '08. "You know they say we
don't have school spirit, but you know,
we might be fair weather fans, but right
now the weather is good and we're par
tying it up."
While it may be a bit selfish, I'd also
like to thank Harbaugh and his players
and coaches for giving your faithful
Daily staffers something positive to
write about for a change. Hopefully,
that change lasts for more than one
week.
Because while this was just one win
on the stat sheet, it was so much more
for the Stanford community. And in the
Cardinal locker room, it has to have
been even more.
'ITiis is the kind of win that pro
grams can build on.
From Harbaugh's discovery of "an
other warrior" in quarterback Tavita
Pritchard — who will get the start Sat
urday against TCU — to the emer
gence of a tenacious defense, Stanford
football regained its soul on Saturday.
Let's all hope energy like that is ex
actly what the doctor ordered for the
Cardinal, and for the campus in gener
al. 1. at least, have a good feeling that it
is.
