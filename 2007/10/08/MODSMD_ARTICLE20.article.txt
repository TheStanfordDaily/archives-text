# Thank you Stanford Football
## 
### 
Thank you, Jim J larbaugh.Thank
you. Tavita Pritchard, Mark
Bradford and Richard Sher
man. Thank you. Clinton Snyder. Nick
Sanchez and everyone else in a Cardi
nal uniform who played hurt. Thank
you to every last individual who set ftx)t
on that Trojan field at the Coliseum to
snap Southern Cal's 35-game home win
streak.
Thank you. because that was more
than just a win to restore some hope in
a moribund program. It was so much
more than Stanford football rising up in
perhaps the biggest upset in college
football history to defeat USC. 24-23. It
was more than a 41-point underdog
toppling the No. 2 team in the nation.
Because Saturday's win didn't just sig
nal the rebirth of a football program.
It signaled the rebirth of an entire
community. Ihe rebirth of a college
sports scene that has been near-dead for
the last three years.
And the really encouraging part? It
didn't seem to take anyone that long to
figure out just how amazing it really
was.
Prom my personal experience of the
night that will be forever remembered
by thousands of Stanford coaches, play
ers. fans, administrators, students and
alumni, the reaction all had a strangely
natural feel to it. Although this year's
seniors had never had anything quite
like this to respond to. and the seniors
who graduated four years ago wouldn't
have either, everyone seemed to know
exactly what to do.
For myself and a handful of friends,
that meant circling campus in a lt X)s
model Subaru, honking like mad and
screaming to anyone who would listen
that USC's perfect season was toast. We
