# Putting the USC win in perspective
## 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
In the first week of the 2007 college football season,
when the little-known Division I-AA Appalachian State
Mountaineers beat Michigan, the winningest Division I-
A program ever, many called it one of the greatest upsets
in the history of college football.
Just one month later, though, Stanford's monumental
24-23 upset of USC on Saturday has left the pundits
searching for words, trumping the Mountaineers' victory
in almost every way.
Although Appalachian State's victory came seeming
ly out of nowhere, the Mountaineers were not out
matched the way the Cardinal were.
Appalachian State was a four-touchdown underdog;
Las Vegas odds-makers had Stanford listed as a 41-point
dog entering Saturday's game. Appalachian State's quar
terback led his team to a I-AA national title in 2006; Stan
ford started a signal-caller who'd thrown three passes in
his entire collegiate career. The Mountaineers led the
Wolverines nearly the entire game before holding on for
the victory; the Cardinal spotted the Trojans 200 yards of
offense and never led until the game's final 49 seconds.
Here are some of the numbers, figures and tidbits to
put Saturday's shocking upset in perspective:
• As a 41-point underdog, Stanford pulled off the biggest
upset (in terms of point spread) in the history of college
football.
• Perhaps Coach Jim Harbaugh was right when he said,
"1 don't know if there's ever been a game where a team

was a 40-point underdog and playing with a quarter
hack making their first start."
• The 24-23 stunner was USC's first home loss in 35
games. Ironically, the Trojans' last home loss also came
at the hands of Stanford ... six years ago. in September
2001.
• Saturday's defeat marked the first IJSC home loss in 24
Pac-10 games.
• Stanford's win was its first against a top-ranked team
(the Trojans were No. 1 in the US A Today coaches' poll)
since the Cardinal won 36-31 at Notre Dame on Oct. 6,
l l )9()— 17 years to the day before this year's squad
scored its improbable victory.
• The Cardinal needed consecutive fourth down conver
sions to pull off the upset. Tavita Pritchard connected
with Richard Sherman on fourth-and-20, before win
ning the game with a fourth-and-goal pass to Mark
Bradford on the next set of downs.
Ultimately, Saturday's win begs the question: how great
of an upset is this? Where will this weekend's miracle go
down in college football history?
Only time well tell, but for now it appears that Saturday's
unlikely win was the greatest upset in Stanford football
history. Pac-10 history and maybe, just maybe, all of col
lege football history.

seal the Cardinal victory. Stanford picked off the USC quarterback four times and forced a fumble in the contest.
