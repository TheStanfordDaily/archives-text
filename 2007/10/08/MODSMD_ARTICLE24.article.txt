### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore center Brook Lopez is academically
ineligible and will miss Stanford basketball's first
nine games, coach Trent Johnson announced on Fri
day
I .opez will practice with the team, but cannot play
until Santa Clara visits on Dec. assuming he re
gains his eligibility after fall quarter.
Rising sophomores need to have completed 36
units with a I.X CiPA to be eligible by NCAA stan
dards.
I have failed to live up to my academic require
ments and take full responsibility for what has hap
pened." Lopez said in a press release."l regret letting
down my team, the University and everyone who
supports me. I promise to work hard to improve my
academic standing and look forward to being back
on the floor to help my team."
Lopez is Stanford's greatest offensive threat, and
one of the most talented post players to ever wear a

uniform for the Cardinal.The No. 2 center recruit in
the nation in his senior year of high school, Lopez
was a projected NBA lottery pick before announcing
his intention to return to the Farm last March.
Ile was named to last year's All-Pac-10 Freshman
team and All-Pac-101 lonorable Mention team, aver
aging 13 points and six rebounds in 26 games and 18
starts.
Stanford will be heavily favored in nearly all of its
first nine games — Harvard, Northwestern State,
UC-Santa Barbara, at Northwestern, at Siena, Yale,
Colorado State. Sacramento State and at Colorado
— so Lopez's loss will have less of an effect than if he
were to miss conference games.
But the Cardinal, a likely preseason top-15 team
before today's news, needs its biggest threat in top
condition come winter. The Pac-10 looks stronger
than ever,and with virtually everyone returning from
last year's NCAA tournament team, big things are
expected c>f Lopez and his teammates.
This is not a first for Stanford men's basketball.
Guard Tin i Morris was ruled academically ineligible
for the 2(K)5 winter quarter after struggling in the
human biology core. Morris, then a redshirt fresh
man. ultimately transferred to the University of
Washington after the 2005-2006 season.
