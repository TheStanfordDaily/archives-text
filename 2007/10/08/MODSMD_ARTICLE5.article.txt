October 8,1990:
Luck runs out on the
Irish—Cardinal 36,
Fighting Irish 31

SOUTH BHND, Ind. —Four
times this season, unranked and
underrated Stanford promised an
upset victory.
Against Colorado, UCI.A and
San Jose State, the squad was left
wondering why it couldn't exe
cute when it really counted. And
why the other guys could.
this time, the predictions came
true.
In what may have been the
upset victory of Stanford football
history, the Cardinal held off un
defeated and No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame for its first road victory in
four seasons. And for the Fighting
Irish's first home loss in live. It was
only the third time the Irish have
ever lost at home while ranked
No. 1 and the first time since 1954.
"This was a great win for us"
coach Denny Green said. "Notre
Dame is almost invincible at
home. Personally, this compares
to winning the Super Bowl in
1989....1 fit isn't the biggest win for
Stanford it definitely rivals upset
ting Oklahoma in 1980."
Few believed it was possible.
Notre Dame had not been defeat
ed at South Bend since 1986.They
were 3-0. They were 17-point fa
vorites. They were the Irish.
But the Cardinal, after almost
pulling off upset wins of the Buf
faloes and Bruins, knew it could
beat the l ighting Irish on hostile
turf.
