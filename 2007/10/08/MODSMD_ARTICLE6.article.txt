# A 						tale of three books
## 
### TRI HUNG NGUYEN 
For the fourth year running, new Stanford stu
dents share the same first assignment —
three hooks to read over the summer. Little
known to many, however, is the way in which
the hooks get chosen and assigned.
The Three Books program, kick-started in 2004 by
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims '89. brings three authors to Stanford for a
conversation with almost 2.000 new students.
What students may not know is that there is no
committee working on the selection of the three
books each year. Instead. Lythcott-Haims chooses a
professor to be the moderator of the event — this
year, Kenneth Fields of the English department
and works solely with him to shortlist a selection of
texts.The three books assigned to the incoming fresh
men are then finalized by April 1. after the duo con
tacts the authors and makes sure that they are avail
able for the Three Books event.
Prior to 2(X)4. Stanford's summer reading program
was limited to each freshman dorm, and there was no
authors' visit to campus during New Student Orienta
tion. Since the inception of Three Books, the event has
brought authors including Khaled Hosseini, Tracy
Kidder and Jeffrey Eugenides to campus.
With the program in its fourth year now, Lythcott-
Haims felt that it had succeeded in placing literature
in the center of the Stanford undergraduate's experi
ence, which is also in line with the University's vision
to promote a liberal arts education.
"We decided it [the program] would take the no
tion of summer reading to a new height," Lythcott
-1 iaims said. "The author would talk to our student not
only about books but also themselves as human be
ings, about writing as a profession and most impor
tantly, about literature and the role it plays in our so
ciety."
Students said that hearing from the authors them
selves during New Student Orientation helped them
to appreciate the books more.
Over the summer, incoming freshmen called the

books "boring." "too flowery" and "hard to un
derstand" on the Class of 2011 Facebook
group discussion.

"They don't look like books that 1
would read." wrote Abteen Bagher
hi-Fard '1 l."Now I feel like I am

back to high school reading."
New students expressed con
cern that the books chosen for
the program tend to come from a

generation older than theirs, and
show little relevance to life in the
modern age.

"1 could not see what was in there
for me in the first place," noted Gabriel
Jimenez-Medina '11. "It would be much
better if we had had some input in these
lection process."

Lythcott-Haims admitted that this genera
tion gap may subdue the excitement of the in
coming freshmen's preparation for their Stan

ford careers, and promised to welcome input
from students in the future. However, she turned
down the idea of choosing the books in committee,
adding that "we end up meeting everybody's de
mand minimally."

Nevertheless, many freshmen left the Three Books
event happily surprised.
"I did not really like Lucille Clifton's 'Good
Woman' at first." Jimenez-Medina said, "but after
hearing her telling about her life and the struggles she
has been through. 1 can now appreciate her book."
All three authors engaged their audience through
out the night with their insightful.sincere.and at times,
very witty responses. As soon as the discussion was
open for questions, there was a long queue of students
behind each microphone.
Jimenez-Medina, whose favorite book of the three
was "The Way to Rainy Mountain" by N. Scott Mo
maday. was especially satisfied with the author's an
swer to his question. He felt that Momaday exuded
the same charm and charisma that was present in his
story.
Lythcott-Haims said the new students could only

fully
appreciate

the assignment
after meeting the authors dur- ALEXANDER NARUHIKO CHEE/The Stanford Daily
inu orientation.

"1 think it was not until they got there that night [atThree
Books] that they realized,'My goodness. 1 have three treas
ures in front of me. and 1 am learning so much from them,"'
she said." In some way I don't want to ask the freshmen what
they like to read. I want tochallenge them to read something
thev mav not have considered."
