# Pledging hunger
## More than 100 abstain from food and water in Fast-a-Thon for charity, awareness 
### LUKE HENESY 
"Go hungry for a day so that someone else
doesn't have to." The tagline sounds simple
enough, but in reality, the hundreds who took
part in yesterday's Fast-a-Thon, run jointly by
the Islamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN), experienced something a
bit more complex than they might have imag
ined when they pledged to abstain from all
food and drink from sunrise until sunset.
Some, including the ISSU president herself,
even could be seen frantically sniffing choco

late bars to keep going through the last min
utes of daylight.
It all started yesterday morning at 5:30
a.m. when about 40 people representing many
different faiths and ethnicities gathered for a
delicious breakfast and somewhat of a send
off for those journeying through a day with
out food or water. Last year this was the total
number of participants in the Fast-a-Thon it
self, but as a result of hardworking leadership,
widespread advertising and the positive expe
riences of those who fasted previously, in-

Nearly 300 students attended an event last night to break their daylong fast, which raised more
than $1,000 to support the Rahima Foundation. 4
volvement more than tripled this
year.
For each student who signed up
and pledged to fast for a day, five
dollars will be donated to the Rahi
ma Foundation, a Bay Area charity
that works to alleviate the struggle
of the homeless and poor through
the distribution of food. The event
aims not simply to donate money,
but to raise awareness about Ra
madan and the life of the students
who spend not just one but 30 full
days fasting for religious reasons.
During the month of Ramadan,
most Muslims abstain from eating,
drinking and sexual activity.
Fatima Hassan '09 and Sohail
Razzaq '09, president and treasurer
of the NISAN respectively, were
two of many who secured dona
tions from the Office of Religious
Life, the Department of Islamic
Studies, Stanford Dining and vari
ous local businesses for the cause.
The 140 non-Muslims who stepped
out of their comfort zone on Sun
day and dealt with hunger pangs
and cravings throughout the day
enabled the ISSU and MSAN to
donate upwards of $1,000 to the
local charity.
After a day of parched throats
and tummy aches, participants were
encouraged to break the fast to
gether at 7:15 p.m. in Tresidder
Union, where they were met with a
long-anticipated dinner and hun
dreds of friends and fellow fasters.
A panel of six Muslim students ex
plained the personal and spiritual
significance of Ramadan to an au
dience of almost 300.
Matt Ybarra 'OS, while not a
Muslim, admired the dedication of
his close friend and felt compelled
to get involved. He decided to fast
not just yesterday, but for all 30
days of Ramadan â€” an ordeal that,
while difficult, he hopes to continue
every year for the rest of his life.
"I broke the fast by accident
while studying when I grabbed a
bottle of water and took just a sip.
and I felt so bad for an hour and a
half afterward," Ybarra said.
"If you break the fast, the money
still gets donated." laughed treasur
er Razzaq when asked about the lo
gistics."Picdging to fast and intend
ing to give it your best is the idea
behind the event."
