Thousands of Stanford fans descended on
Maples Pavilion at midnight Saturday to welcome
the football team back from its shocking 24-23
upset of second-ranked USC in Los Angeles.
"An all-time great ," said Martha Symonds '54.
But the thousands of students, administrators,
faculty and alumni at two post-game rallies follow
ing Stanford football's monumental upset of USC
seemed to identify most with Danny Arbeiter'oB.
"Words can't express how I feel," he said.
Some present hadn't believed at first the frantic
phone calls from friends telling them what had
happened. Others happened to tune in to the last
few minutes of the game,expecting the Cardinal to
be in a huge hole. What they saw, however, was
what many are calling the biggest upset in college
football history.
Upon hearing the news, an overwhelming swell
of Cardinal pride brought an estimated crowd of
200 to a spontaneous celebration in the Quad soon
after the game ended, and an estimated 1,500 to a
hastily-planned midnight welcome party outside
Maples Pavilion for the returning victors.
At times, it was utter chaos.
The celebrations started as the piercing sound
of car horns screeched across campus.
Nearly 200 students spontaneously descended
on the Quad to celebrate at around 8:15 p.m., soon
after sophomore safety Bo McNally intercepted
USC quarterback John David Booty to clinch the
Cardinal victory. Someone touched a lighter to a
pile of trash, books, magazines and cardboard
boxes, and the four-foot flame provided a rallying
point for chants of "U-S-C, R.1.P.," and "Whose
house? Our house!"
But by 9 p.m., Palo Alto Fire Department offi
cials arrived and forced the students to let the fire
burn out.Trying to identify the instigators, fire mar
shals' bullhorn queries were met only with the cho
rus of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start TTie Fire."
Meanwhile, administrators, ASSU officials and
Axe Committee members were busy organizing a
bigger celebration: a heroes' welcome for the re
turning victors.
The team was flying to the San Francisco airport
and taking buses back to campus, where it was
scheduled to arrive at 12:15 a.m. So Axe Comm
brought loudspeakers, ASSU officials ruffled up a
DJ and Dean Julie created a Facebook event.
As the designated time approached, people
started to trickle — and then flood — toward
Maples. At 11:45 p.m.. the crowd was 300 people.
By midnight, it had grown to 750. By 12:30 a.m.,
when the much-anticipated buses arrived, nearly
1.500 people formed a pushing, swaying mob
around three buses, which were accompanied by a
police escort.
Hie crowd on hand wasn't all students, howev
er, and some long-time fans came in force to cele
brate.
"It was gonna be spaghetti and meatballs, but
I'm going to be making [the team) prime rib tomor
row." said Jimmy Viglizzo, proprietor of Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe in Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"This is the most exciting sports upset in all my
years as a fan." said Symonds.
"Glad to see those 'blankety-blanks' get it," said
Los Gatos resident Eddie Chase, 62, a 35-year sea
son ticket holder.
But the older crowd was mostly missing from
the giant mob that coalesced when the buses pulled
up and the doors opened. Coach Jim Harbaugh
was the first one off. and he was greeted by a jubi
lant mob who eagerly reached to pat the charis
matic coach on the back.
Bottles of champagne sprayed overhead and
firecrackers exploded in the sky as the crowd
greeted the players with high-fives and massive
cheers. Axe Comm members with bullhorns tried
to create a path and some breathing room for the
players.
"This is finally the big football school I wanted,"
said Texas native Chloe Bade '09.
The champions were upbeat about their victory.
"So many times in life you have people telling you
a hundred times you can't, and a hundred times
no," Harbaugh told the assembled crowd. "Today,
our players said, 'yes, you can.'"

house? Our house!"
But by 9 p.m., Palo Alto Fire Department offi
cials arrived and forced the students to let the fire
burn out.Trying to identify the instigators, fire mar
shals' bullhorn queries were met only with the cho
rus of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start TTie Fire."
Meanwhile, administrators, ASSU officials and
Axe Committee members were busy organizing a
bigger celebration: a heroes' welcome for the re
turning victors.
The team was flying to the San Francisco airport
and taking buses back to campus, where it was
scheduled to arrive at 12:15 a.m. So Axe Comm
brought loudspeakers, ASSU officials ruffled up a
DJ and Dean Julie created a Facebook event.
As the designated time approached, people
started to trickle — and then flood — toward
Maples. At 11:45 p.m.. the crowd was 300 people.
By midnight, it had grown to 750. By 12:30 a.m.,
when the much-anticipated buses arrived, nearly
1.500 people formed a pushing, swaying mob
around three buses, which were accompanied by a
police escort.
Hie crowd on hand wasn't all students, howev
er, and some long-time fans came in force to cele
brate.
"It was gonna be spaghetti and meatballs, but
I'm going to be making [the team) prime rib tomor
row." said Jimmy Viglizzo, proprietor of Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe in Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"This is the most exciting sports upset in all my
years as a fan." said Symonds.
"Glad to see those 'blankety-blanks' get it," said
Los Gatos resident Eddie Chase, 62, a 35-year sea
son ticket holder.
But the older crowd was mostly missing from
the giant mob that coalesced when the buses pulled
up and the doors opened. Coach Jim Harbaugh
was the first one off. and he was greeted by a jubi
lant mob who eagerly reached to pat the charis
matic coach on the back.
Bottles of champagne sprayed overhead and
firecrackers exploded in the sky as the crowd
greeted the players with high-fives and massive
cheers. Axe Comm members with bullhorns tried
to create a path and some breathing room for the
players.
"This is finally the big football school I wanted,"
said Texas native Chloe Bade '09.
The champions were upbeat about their victory.
"So many times in life you have people telling you
a hundred times you can't, and a hundred times
no," Harbaugh told the assembled crowd. "Today,
our players said, 'yes, you can.'"
While Stanford police parked cars around cam-

Students lit a bonfire in the Quad soon after the final whistle blew on Saturday night. Among the fuel for the fire was Friday's copy of The Daily ... and its ominous headline, "Towering Troy Looms."

pus and briefly handcuffed an ine
briated student outside the Post Of
fice before releasing him, they had
little visible presence near Maples
Pavilion. As a result, several stu
dents wandered in holding handles
of alcohol, which they tried to give
to the players.
Many also brought handmade
signs: "You Can't Spell Suck With
out USC," read one. "Way To Kick
Booty," said another. "Harbaugh is
God," read a third.
When players got off the bus,
many joined fellow students in
dancing to Timbaland and Justin
Timberlake. Others headed home,
to bed or to another party, with
around half the crowd leaving by 1
a.m.
As the players and coaches filed
out, onlookers expressed a new
found excitement for Stanford
Football.
"It's no longer 'We Believe,'"
said Axe Comm chairman Guiller
mo Huerta '09. "It's 'We Know."'
