In the wake of Stanford's improb
able 24-23 win over No. 2 USC on
Saturday night, student celebrations
on campus were marked by repeated
visits from fire engines and an in
creased police presence.
"We did tiring in a few additional
deputies," Department of Public
Safety (DPS) Sergeant Del Bandy
told The Daily."in case the crowd got
out of hand."
Bandy said that three armed po
lice officers were called up as im
promptu celebrations began to
break out. The deputies reinforced
the police presence at Maples Pavil
ion, where a large crowd gathered to
welcome the football team back to
Stanford around midnight,and at the
Main Quad, where police responded
to reports of a "small bonfire" at 8:45
p.m.
"We had to frown upon that one
and put it out," Bandy said, adding
that no one was charged.
I le was unwilling to speculate on
the size of the crowds, but partici
pants pegged the size of the gather
ing in the Quad at around 200 peo
ple.
Hie Palo Alto Fire Department
also made several appearances Sat
urday night. The crew of Fire Engine
Number Six, stationed at the on
campus firehouse on Serra Street,
extinguished the blaze in the Quad
and responded to two other calls dur
ing the course of the evening. Bandy
said.
Later, public safety officials re
sponded to reports of a fire near the
clock tower, where a flyer kiosk was
partially burned. That fire is being
classified as arson. Bandy said, but
there are no suspects in the case. Fire
personnel also extinguished a flam
ing trash can.
Despite the fires, officials report
ed that post-game celebrations were
fairly tame. The sole arrest of the
evening was for drunk driving, but
Bandy said he did not "think it was
specifically related to the football
win."
According to Palo Alto Police
Department (PAPD) Sergeant
Natasha Powers, Stanford called for
help from Palo Alto officers as part
of the t wo pol ice depa rtnie nt s' ni ut u -
al aid agreement, but the DPS can
celled the request before PAPD
deputies arrived on the scene.
"Everyone was excited about the
win," Bandy said, "but they were for
the most part well-behaved."
Despite reports of "cheering fire
men" extinguishing the Quad bon
fire. Bandy said the police remained
cool throughout the evening.
"This is what we do." he said."l'm
happy for the team, but law enforce
ment is our job."
