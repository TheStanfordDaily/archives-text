# Lawns aren't green

### KT MERTES 
Each year, Americans spend
more than $30 billion on lawn
care, applying over 65 million
pounds of lawn chemicals.
For every 100 gallons of water con-

sumed in the home, we pour 30 to
60 on our lawns. And gas-powered
lawnmowers emit 10 to 12 times as
much carbon per hour of operatior
as automobiles.

But Americans are also fa
mous for prioritizing con
venience and cutting high

maintenance activities from their

lifestyles — think fast food, sound
bytes and Internet shopping.

With our luxuriant green subur
ban dreams having such an impact

on the environment and our wallets.

why not transfer these American ethics
to the front yard?

It's not a small problem. Today, lawn
grasses are the largest irrigated crop group
in the country. America's lawns cover 32 mil
lion square acres, nearly 2 percent of the coun
try. according to satellite-based research pub
lished in 2005 by the University of Montana's
Cristina Milesi.

Most Americans want to live in a single
family home in the suburbs, complete with a
garage and green lawn, according to a survey
of new homeowners conducted by Century
21. How did this homey slice of suburbia —
the lawn part, at least — become such a perva
sive element of the American ideal?
American lawns date back to the 1600s,
when wealthy colonists tried to recreate Euro
pean formal gardens using American foliage.
Such attempts failed miserably. Aristocrats re
locating to the New World brought along their
gardeners, only to find that native plants could
n't be made to grow the perfectly green carpets
they wanted in order to showcase their new es
tates. So they "solved" the problem by import
ing European plant species, which had to be
generously watered in America's hotter, drier
climate.
Most settlers couldn't afford to maintain
unproductive land, but the big green lawn be
came engrained in the American psyche as an
important status symbol.
In the 1800 sand early 1900s, verdant lawns
remained the property of the American aris
tocracy. Large lawns and artful gardens were
popular on antebellum plantations. Sprawling
lawns characterized the estates of robber
baron families, like the Vanderbilts and Rocke
fellers. Hearst Castle in Big Sur boasts one of
the largest.
The idea of a lawn for every household only
emerged in the 1950s when planned develop
ments gave the growing middle class an ameni

ty usually
reserved for the rich. Most lawn
acreage today is concentrated in cooler and
more humid Eastern states, but the West and
Southwest host their share of lush lawns —
even though the natural landscape is blatantly
unsuited for grassy, manicured perfection.
Indeed, thanks to the transplanting experi
ments of European gardening aficionados, the
übiquitous American lawn rarely features na
tive plants adapted to local microclimatic con
ditions. Our artificial oases must be sustained
with pesticide spraying, copious watering and
frequent mowing.
So what's the alternative?
Lawns not regularly treated with chemicals
will regain natural populations of soil inverte
brates and microorganisms. Planting native
species and mixing grasses with other types of

ground
cover encourage a suite of lawn

plants that is more resilient to inva
sive weeds, is far more drought-tolerant and
won't require weekly mowing. And these ac
tions increase the chances of providing habitats
albeit on a small scale — for native and mi
grating animals, who could definitely use the
help.
Another idea is xeriscaping, in which plant
species appropriate for local conditions are or
ganized in an artful way that also minimizes
watering. The practice already has a following
among lawn enthusiasts switching to environ
mentally friendly yard care, those worrying

about
health effects from pesticides and homeowners
wanting to reduce the amount of time and
money spent on their lawns.
Still, a great deal of effort remains to defeat
one of the most pervasive myths in American
culture. 'ITie next time you spot an oasis of
green on campus or eye a suburban mini-para
dise Just remember: that "green" lawn is really
anything but.
