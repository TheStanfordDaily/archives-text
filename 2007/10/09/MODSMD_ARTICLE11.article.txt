BAGHDAD (AP) —Iraqi au
thorities want the U.S. government
to sever all contracts in Iraq with
Blackwater USA within six months.
They also want the firm to pay $8
million in compensation to families
of each of the 17 people killed when
its guards sprayed a traffic circle with
heavy machine gun fire last month.
The demands — part of an Iraqi
government report examined by The
Associated Press — also called on
U.S. authorities to hand over the
Blackwater security agents involved
in the Sept. 16 shootings to face pos
sible trial in Iraqi courts.
The tone of the Iraqi report ap
pears to signal further strains be
tween the government of Prime Min
ister Nouri al-Maliki and the White
House over the deaths in Nisoor
Square — which have prompted a
series of U.S. and Iraqi probes and
raised questions over the use of pri
vate security contractors to guard
U.S. diplomats and other officials.
The report also highlights the dif
ferences in death tolls and accounts
that have complicated efforts to piece
together the chain of events as one
Blackwater-protected convoy raced
back toward Baghdad's Green Zone
after a nearby bombing, while a sec
ond backup team in four gun trucks
sped into the square as a backup team.
The Iraqi investigation charges
the four Blackwater vehicles called
to the square began shooting with
out provocation. Blackwater con

tends its employees came under fire
first.
The government, at the conclusion
of its investigation,said 17 Iraqis died.
It said the compensation — total
ing $136 million — was so high "be
cause Blackwater uses employees
who disrespect the rights of Iraqi citi
zens even though they are guests in
this country."
The U.S. military pays compensa
tion money to the families of civil
ians killed in battles or to cover prop
erty damage, but at far lower
amounts.
The United States has not made
conclusive findings about the shoot
ing. though there are multiple inves
tigations under way and Congress
has opened inquiries into the role of
private security contractors.
The Iraqi government report said
its courts were to proper venue in
which to bring charges..
Tlie report found that Blackwater
guards also had killed 21 Iraqi civil
ians and wounded 27 in previous
shootings since it took over security
for U.S. diplomats in Baghdad after
the U.S. invasion. The Iraqi govern
ment did not say whether it would
try to prosecute in those cases.
The State Department has count
ed 56 shooting incidents involving
Blackwater guards in Iraq this year.
All were being reviewed as part of
the comprehensive inquiry ordered
by Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice.
