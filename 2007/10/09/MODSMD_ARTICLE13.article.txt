SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Google
Inc.'s sttx'k price sailed past $600
for the first time Monday, extend
ing a monthlong rally propelled by
the lofty expectations surrounding
the Internet search leader's upcom
ing third-quarter earnings report.
The Mountain View-based
company's shares traded as high
as $610.26 before slipping back to
$609.62. a gain of $15.57, or 2.6
percent. It marked the sixth time
in the past 12 trading sessions that
the stock has reached a new peak,
indicating investors are confident
Google's third-quarter profit will
be impressive. The results are
scheduled to be released Oct. 18.
The latest milestone served as
yet another reminder of the im
mense wealth created since
Google went public in August
2004.

The shares have increased
more than sevenfold from their
initial public offering price of $85.
bringing the nine-year-old compa
ny's market value to $190 billion -
eclipsing bigger, more mature
businesses like Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.. Coca-Cola Co., Hewlett-
Packard Co. and IBM Corp.
It took 101/2 months for
Google's stock to leap from $500
to $600 and more than a year for
the journey from $400 to $500. The
shares hurdled $300 in June 2005
after passing the $100 and $200
thresholds in 2004.
Analysts began predicting
Google's stock would reach $600
at the start of 2006 when the
shares were still hovering around
$420. Some analysts already are
predicting Google's stock will hit
$700 within the next year, but the
average target price for the stock
is $614.64 among analysts polled
