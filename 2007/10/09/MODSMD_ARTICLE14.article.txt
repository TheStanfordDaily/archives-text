						fall career fair: an imperfect process 
### 
C hairs and tables sprawling across
White Plaza, seniors and co-terms
buzzing around in a frenzied scram
ble, inboxes teaming with Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) emails — all of these
phenomena point to one event: the start of
the 2007 Fall Career Fair. When more than
275 organizations interface with Stanford's
student body from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today,
the message that October isn't too soon to
be certain of where you will be and what you
will be doing nine months from now will
come across loud and clear. While so many
organizations pitching themselves to stu
dents in the same place and for the same
amount of time may look and feel like a free
market of laborers and firms, the savvy
know that the playing field is. in fact, tipped.
The situation bears a remarkable resem
blance to recent controversies over early ac
tion and early decision policies at the na
tion's top colleges and universities. Early de
cision programs have a proven bias against
less affluent students who apply on a regular
timeline to give themselves the option of
comparing financial aid packages.The situa
tion provoked Yale President Richard
Levin to call on universities to "restore a
measure of reasoned choice to college ad
missions" by reconsidering early action poli
cies.
Early decision programs play up the inse
curity inherent in the admissions process to
the advantage of schools with superior
name recognition. Students lose out when
they are rushed to apply before they are
fully aware of their options. It's much easier
to apply early to Big Name University then
it is to scour the Princeton Review for that
perfect match. Often, the result is that stu
dents get prematurely locked into a commit
ment that wasn't fully weighed. Conse
quently. lesser-known colleges are shut out
of the game early, and they lose out, too.
The same rules apply to job applications

as admissions.The job market is far less reg
ulated than the cloistered world of elite ed
ucation. and fairness as a concept holds
much less water. However, rushing students
to make career choices before they've had a
chance to be exposed to all of their options
is clearly not in the best interests of students.
College admissions boards note that
staggered application systems such as early
action and early decision work against in
formed decision-making. College career
counselors should apply that example to im
prove job search strategies for students.
From the firm side of the equation, mega
hirers like Goldman Sachs, Google and
McKinsey &. Company — all of whom are
so-called Gold or Platinum level partners
with the CDC — have created institutional
ized advantages for themselves in the hiring
process. They have already hosted soirees
and mingled with fresh talent.Their resume
drops and interviews come much earlier in
the year than the hiring processes of smaller
groups. This enables them to present offers
and demand decisions before the non-prof
its and start-ups that do not retain college
recruitment staff have really kicked oft the
hiring cycle.
Perfect competition doesn't exist from
the student side, either. As deadlines are
pushed earlier in the year, students who are
best prepared to compete for top jobs are
more likely to be those students who have
the greatest resources at their disposal.
Stanford has provided many resources to all
students in the three weeks before this ca
reer fair. I lowever. it is hardly reasonable to
believe that three weeks at the frenetic be
ginning of a pivotal quarter in an undergrad
uate's career can fully groom the unin
formed student for the legendary hiring tri
als of mega-firms.
Hie CDC has taken measures to pre-
