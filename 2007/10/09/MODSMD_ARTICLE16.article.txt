# Pleading Inanity
## The 						'L' word 
### 
Welcome, Class of '10! I haven't met
any of you. but I can already tell
that our relationship will he — as
Calvin's best friend Hobbes put it — nasty,
brutish and short.
You undergrads are so vain you probably
thought the last sentence was about you. I'm
talking to first-year Law students! You as
piring advocates better be ready and rested,
because you are about to embark on the
journey that truly puts the "super" in
supererogatory.
Oh. the sights you'll see: the big tables
and $6(X) chairs on the first floor of the li
brary. the cubicles and $6(X) chairs on the
other side of the first floor of the library, the
Westlaw representative who sits next to the
IT guy between the big tables and cubicles.
*Squeal!* I'm getting hot flashes just think
ing about it!
But, contrary to popular belief, law
school isn't all fun and (drinking) games.
You've got a lot of crap to learn! So to start,
I'll give you the skinny on your first semes
ter classes. Believe me when I say that if you
truly understand the words that are about to
emerge from my perineum, you'll be sure to
do about as well as I did.
Civil Procedure: A complete misnomer.
Around this time, roughly five weeks in. it
should be perfectly clear to you that the
FRCP flunked out of charm school. Hey,
Congress! Here are a couple rules that you
might want to consider: 1) Anteprandial
salad fork on the left, prandial salad fork on
the right; 2) Don't pee in my pool and I
won't swim in your toilet: and 3) When in
doubt, ask yourself, "What would Justice
Scalia do?" and then curse in Italian and
make an ambiguously obscene gesture to
the jury.
Torts: If you. as a reasonable person, can
seriously injure yourself in the use of a prod
uct, in your interactions with other people or
under the care of your doctor, don't hesi
tate! Heinous disfigurement is especially lu
crative. as you can easily win jury sympathy
if they cringe at the very thought of living
even one day as someone who now looks the
way you do. If you can convince your child
to get injured instead, then [three cherries in
a row) = Jackpot!
Contracts: If you would like to formally

and irrevocably agree to mail me a $5 bill,
then finish reading this sentence. Gotcha!
Bet you didn't see that one coming. Yep.
contracts can be formed just like that. I put a
condition out there, and. if you agree to it.
you express your acquiescence in the man
ner I stipulate. Just like you just did. remem
ber? Not so long ago? With the $5 bill? King
a bell? Yeah? $5 bill?
Criminal I.aw: Breaking the law is gener
ally a bad idea, even if you're rich (whieh
you will be. don't worry). If you must com
mit a crime, though, it's a good idea to know
the relevant laws in your jurisdiction. For in
stance. did you know that, in some places in
Idaho, it's a crime to tap your foot in an air
port bathroom? Yep. it is. Also, to all you
professional athletes out there, remember
this — when you pit canines against each
other in battle royales to the death, every
body loses.
One last piece of advice for you legal
neophytes: lawyers are known to start all
their sentences with the qualification "It de
pends." Through some hard knocks and
bruises, I've learned that there are several
important questions for which this qualified
manner of response leads to more harm
than good. "Do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?" (Appropriate
answer: "Yes"). "Do you know why I pulled
you over?" (Appropriate answers: "Because
I was speeding?" or "To compliment my
sweet new Toyota Yaris?"). And.finally,"Do
you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?" (Appropriate
Answers: "Does it count if my fingers are
crossed?" or "I'm a lawyer and thus don't
understand this concept 'truth' of which you
speak ")
Future lawyers of America, 1 dare say
that you are now ready to start your legal re
education and moral devaluation — at least


Sridharan
1 hope so. since you started classes
five weeks ago. So open your wallets,
close your heart and steady yourself
for all the wonders of neutral parti
sanship that await you at the Bar.

If you have been treated un fairly by
your parents; teachers or friends, you
may be entitled to compensatory dam
ages! Email vishnusQstanford. edit
