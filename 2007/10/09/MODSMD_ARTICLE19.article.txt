# Fish out of Water
## Give my regards to Broadway 
### 
Do you ever wonder why in those
"naked in front of a roomful of peo
ple" dreams you always have to be
the naked one? Cast your exhibitionist
paranoias aside, my friend, because it's
voyeuristic sailing from here on out. Since
you're a pussy and I'm a martyr who just
happens to have a lot of time on her hands.
I've graciously volunteered to throw myself
into a Daily volume's worth of uncomfort
able situations and let you simply smirk
along cowardly on the sidelines.
While 1 won't be stripping my clothes off
(or at least not for most assignments!). I will
be doing a mean job at stripping, whipping
and flagellating my ego. I'll also be giving
you a taste of a job. lifestyle or experiment
that you've always been curious about but
never dared to try yourself.
For my very first assignment. I dragged
my tone-deaf, musically inexperienced self
to an audition for a production of The Pi
rates of Penzance, put on by resident
Gilbert and Sullivan appreciation group.the
Stanford Savoyards.
Now. I know there are people who. when
they say they can't sing, are really just look
ing for the opportunity to bust out their
pipes and passive-aggressively force a com
pliment out of you so you can make them
feel better about their other glaring person
al inadequacies. Hut since I'm writing a col
umn about myself for The Daily. I think it's
pretty safe to say that I'm not one for false
modesty.
For science's sake. I also took an online
test to see if I was actually tone deaf. and.
while I surprisingly scored way up in the
"low normal'' range. I'm pretty confident
that the results said more about my pen
chant for educated guessing than my ability
to carry a note.
Needless to sav. mv online test results

hardly buoyed my spirits as 1 made my
maiden entrance into Braun Auditorium. A
little while earlier, I had spoken to a friend
who once served as an "audition buddy" for
a cold-footed friend. She assured me that it
would be more miserable than I was imagin
ing it to be: not only was 1 going to have to
perform a pre-prepared monologue and
song mul keep up in a choreographed mod
ern dance number, 1 was also going to have
to withstand the glaring condescension of
all the really talented kids who would be fill
ing up the rest of the room.
For some reason, the idea of sticking it to
a room of self-righteous emo kids really ap
pealed to me, so I decided to show up as un
prepared as possible in order to best kick
some ass. When I got there, however, the
only asses available to kick were those of
four Savoyards manning the booth outside
the audition room.
The idea of being the only person actual
ly auditioning was suddenly much more ter
rifying than humiliating myself in front of a
hundred people. But the Savoyards quickly
assured me that they themselves would be
auditioning and that others would surely be
auditioning over the course of the week.
When another auditioning Savoyard
soon bounded in. decked out in a "Pirates of
the Caribbean" shirt, and a second non-
Savoyard auditionee made a pirate "Argh"
face for her Polaroid headshot before step
ping out to practice her prepared music

piece, I started to feel pretty good again
about my own mediocrity and began rifling
through one girl's copy of "Get America
Singing...AGAlN!" to find the perfect
song...and some inspiration. "To take a lung
full of air and push it out with some kind of
song is an act of survival. Try it — you'll live
longer," it professed, adding, "And industri
alized, polluted, TV-addicted people will
learn to sing again." Sweet.
Passing over choices like "Puff the Magic
Dragon" and "Shalom Chaverim," I settled
on "Give My Regards to Broadway" be
cause I kinda-sorta knew the lyrics, and,
well, it seemed pretty damn appropriate. It
seemed great actually, until 1 entered the au
dition room, and, in front of the show's five
producers, handed my music to the accom
panist.
Approximately two bars in, I realized I
don't know how to read music. First take:
false start; second take: false start; fifth take:
1 jumped the bullet but proceeded to plunge
in and just hoped the piano would eventual
ly catch up.
I was initially a little shaken up after my
embarrassing start (and actually hearing my
voice aloud), but after a trip-up and a giggle
in the middle, I broke it out for all it was
worth. After a brief jazz hands/no jazz hands
debate, I finished — no jazz hands — and
gave them a good 15 seconds to recover be
fore I looked up from the page.
Stone cold faces; stone cold silence.
The nice one: "Um. would you mind
singing "Happy Birthday' for us now?"
"With or without the music?" I
squeaked.
Pregnant pause. "Without the music."
