## Speed dates go online Start-up offer 3-minute video chats, chance at chemistry 
### ANDEW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the widely-held notion
that Stanford's dating scene leaves
something to be desired, two Grad
uate School of Business (GSB)
alums are attempting to revolution
ize the dating world by introducing
online speed dating.
Dan Abelon MBA '07 and Simon
Tisminezky MBA 07 are the co-cre
ators of Speeddate.com, a San
Mateo-based startup designed to
provide customers with online
speed-dating capabilities through
the use of Web cams and computer
microphones. The creators believe
that online speed dating will ulti
mately provide a better sense of the
chemistry between two people com
pared to traditional online dating
sites.
"For most other online dating
services, meeting each other in per
son is the last step of the process,"
Abelon said in a telephone inter
view with The Daily.
The basic format for
Speeddate.com is based on the typi
cal speed date model, in which a
group of strangers meets at a bar or
a restaurant and each guest rotates
from one person to another, having
short "dates" of only a few minutes
each.
In the online version, customers
enter a few basic points of informa
tion, such as their name and ZIP
code, and have a number of speed
dating sessions of three minutes
each. Following the "date," both
participants are asked to respond
"yes or no" if they would like to
know more about the other person
and are added to one another's
match lists if they both agree.
This model runs in almost direct
opposition to the standard format
of big name dating sites such as
Match.com and eHarmony.in which
members fill out extensive ques
tionnaires and personality profiles
and communicate through email
long before meeting face-to-face in
real life.
Abelon said the idea for the site was born out of
a project he and Tisminezky worked on for one of
their GSB courses, "Entrepreneurship and Ven
ture Capital." in which one of the co-lecturers was
Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

"A lot of MB As are constantly trying to

come up with new business ideas" Abelon

said. "Simon had used a lot of online

dating services and [he was getting

frustrated with them]."
On Oct. 4, the company host
ed its first online speed dating
party for San Francisco resi
dents. Abelon said that the event
was a great success for the site j
and that approximately 230 peo-!
pie participated from the begin
ning of the event at 8 p.m. until
as late as 2 a.m. This Thursday.

another event will be hosted for

anyone from the Bay Area begin
ning at 8 p.m.

"Our ultimate vision for the site is to

have a site where you can date as long as you

want," Abelon said.

In an Oct. 3 piece in The New York Times, J. Galen
Buckwalter, vice president of research and develop
ment for eHarmony. was quoted as critical of the con
cept behind Speeddate.com. He warned potential
members of the site that physical attraction and initial
chemistry are often poor indicators of long-term rela

tionship success.

Abelon claimed that speed dating is a tried and
true technique in the offline world. He argued
that, while most speed-daters know not to ex-

pect an instant serious relationship.

having face-to-face interaction for
only a brief time can still tell a per
son much about his or her compat-

ibility with someone else.

"I believe the only real way
to know if there's chemistry is to

interact live," Abelon said.
Among Stanford undergrad
uates — who many claim have

abandoned traditional dating
practices — there is disagree
ment over whether the idea of a

speed dating Web site is a good
one.

"1 think that it would be a

good idea because it would be

like seeing someone in real life,"

said Abraham Berhane '11. "In chat

rooms, you don't really get a real first

impression, where as with this it would be

like you were meeting them in real life."

Others were skeptical of the whole idea of online dat
ing.
"I guess it's a good idea," said Victoria Yeh '09,"but
I'm not really interested in that kind of stuff at all."
