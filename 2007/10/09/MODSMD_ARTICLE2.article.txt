## Speed dates go online Start-up offer 3-minute video chats, chance at chemistry 
### ANDEW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the widely-held notion
that Stanford's dating scene leaves
something to be desired, two Grad
uate School of Business (GSB)
alums are attempting to revolution
ize the dating world by introducing
online speed dating.
Dan Abelon MBA '07 and Simon
Tisminezky MBA 07 are the co-cre
ators of Speeddate.com, a San
Mateo-based startup designed to
provide customers with online
speed-dating capabilities through
the use of Web cams and computer
microphones. The creators believe
that online speed dating will ulti
mately provide a better sense of the
chemistry between two people com
pared to traditional online dating
sites.
"For most other online dating
services, meeting each other in per
son is the last step of the process,"
Abelon said in a telephone inter
view with The Daily.
The basic format for
Speeddate.com is based on the typi
cal speed date model, in which a
group of strangers meets at a bar or
a restaurant and each guest rotates
from one person to another, having
short "dates" of only a few minutes
each.
In the online version, customers
enter a few basic points of informa
tion, such as their name and ZIP
code, and have a number of speed
dating sessions of three minutes
each. Following the "date," both
participants are asked to respond
"yes or no" if they would like to
know more about the other person
and are added to one another's
match lists if they both agree.
This model runs in almost direct
opposition to the standard format
of big name dating sites such as
Match.com and eHarmony.in which
members fill out extensive ques
tionnaires and personality profiles
and communicate through email
long before meeting face-to-face in
