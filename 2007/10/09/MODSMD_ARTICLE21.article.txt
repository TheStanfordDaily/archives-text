No. 19 Oregon made the second-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball team work for its
victory last Friday, hut the Cardinal had what it
took to pull out the first two games and then run
aw ay with the third. Stanford recorded its fourth
consecutive sweep of a Pac-10 opponent and re
mains undefeated at 16-0 overall and 5-0 in con
ference play.
The Cardinal started its road trip with a
sweep of Oregon State (8-10.1-5 Pac-10),a team
that has never defeated Stanford in 45 tries.The
last time Oregon (14-4,3-3) heat the Cardinal in
liugene was in J986, but Pacific-10 matches are
always competitive.
"My feeling is that the Pac-10 as a whole has
improved this year," head coach John Dunning
said. "OSU is significantly better than last year.
