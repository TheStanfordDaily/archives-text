victory last Friday, hut the Cardinal had what it
took to pull out the first two games and then run
aw ay with the third. Stanford recorded its fourth
consecutive sweep of a Pac-10 opponent and re
mains undefeated at 16-0 overall and 5-0 in con
ference play.
The Cardinal started its road trip with a
sweep of Oregon State (8-10.1-5 Pac-10),a team
that has never defeated Stanford in 45 tries.The
last time Oregon (14-4,3-3) heat the Cardinal in
liugene was in J986, but Pacific-10 matches are
always competitive.

ifornia.
On her 20th birthday, junior mid
dle blocker Foluke Akinradewo

straight points — a Klineman kill, an
ace by senior setter Bryn Kehoe and

in those situations," Dunning said of
the late comeback. "So when we got
into the situation at Cal of being
down 28-22 and coming back to win
and then a similar case against
UCLA, that helped us understand
what we are capable of. So as a team

we can remain calm, and the players
that can make big plays step up and
do it."
After eking out a pair of close
games, the Cardinal pulled away from
the Ducks and did not look back in
the third. Oregon was within one at
13-12. but Stanford used several long
runs to stretch its lead. Barboza
ended the match with a kill, her 35th
of the weekend.

"Our team has a lot of experience
in those situations," Dunning said of
the late comeback. "So when we got
into the situation at Cal of being
down 28-22 and coming back to win
and then a similar case against
UCLA, that helped us understand
what we are capable of. So as a team

we can remain calm, and the players
that can make big plays step up and
do it."
