and Press struck the crossbar a minute be

Despite out-shooting Santa Clara 26-5,
the Cardinal settled for a tie in the final non-conference
game on its schedule. Stanford begins Pac-10 Confer
ence competition against cross-bay rival California this
week. The Golden Bears have not played since Sepl
30, when they upset then-top-ranked Santa Clara, 2-0.
Freshman Alex Morgan scored the clincher and was
named Pac-10 Player of the Week, while the team rose
four spots in the national poll. Last year, Cal upset the
Cardinal, 1 -0, at Berkeley in their only meeting, when
Stanford was No. 11 in the country.
