The No. I Stanford women's soccer team
thoroughly outplayed No. 5 Santa Clara on
Friday evening but could not put the ball in
the net and eventually tied the Broncos 0-0
after two overtimes.
TTie (Ordinal (9-1 -2) peppered the Santa
Clara (7-1 -3) goal with shots, hitting a dozen
on goal and 26 in total. Meagan McCray.the
Broncos' junior goalkeeper, managed to get
a hand on each of those 12 shots on goal and
also got a little help from the frame of her
net. Stanford forwards Christen Press and
Kelley O' 1 lara each hit the right post of the
Santa Clara goal on either side of halftime,
and Press struck the crossbar a minute be
fore the end of the second overtime.
Press, a freshman,collected a corner kick
and fired against the woodwork almost 25
minutes into the first half. About 85 minutes
of play later, she skipped the ball off the top

Stanford, Calif. 7:30 RM.
Despite out-shooting Santa Clara 26-5,
the Cardinal settled for a tie in the final non-conference
game on its schedule. Stanford begins Pac-10 Confer
ence competition against cross-bay rival California this
week. The Golden Bears have not played since Sepl
30, when they upset then-top-ranked Santa Clara, 2-0.
Freshman Alex Morgan scored the clincher and was
named Pac-10 Player of the Week, while the team rose
four spots in the national poll. Last year, Cal upset the
Cardinal, 1 -0, at Berkeley in their only meeting, when
Stanford was No. 11 in the country.

of the crossbar from inside the box.
O'Hara, a sophomore, beat McCray
12 minutes into the second period
only to see her shot rebound off the
unright.
Senior midfielder Shari Summers
had Stanford's next best chance of
the night early in the second half.
Summers strode through midfiekl
unmarked before striking a shot to
ward the top-right corner of the
Broncos goal. McCray had to use
every last bit of her 5-foot-9 frame to
make the diving save.
Freshman Kira Maker tended
goal for Stanford, playing all 110
minutes, but was not forced to make

any saves. All five of Santa Clara's
shots flew wide. It was the first game
of the season in which the Cardinal's
opponent failed to register a shot on
goal.
The Broncos had more opportu
nities than Stanford at the outset,
sending two shots wide and winning
a corner during the first half of the
opening period. But O'l lara's shot in
the 24th minute, Stanford's first of
the game, incited a deluge that in
cluded six shots over the next 10
minutes. The Cardinal pinned Santa
Clara back for most of the rest of the
game but simply could not score.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe de
viated from his usual lineup for the
game against the Broncos and
changed his starting defense for the
first time all year. Sophomore
Kristin Stannard returned to the
starting squad for the first time since

the opening game of the year. To
make room for her in the Cardinal's
midfield, fellow sophomore Alicia
Jenkins moved to right hack.displac
ing senior April Wall. O'Hara also
got the start on Friday, her first since
injuring her shoulder, against Mis
souri on Sept. 14. She replaced senior
Lizzy George on the Cardinal's front
line.
A crowd of 2.672 people showed
up to Maloney Field to watch the
clash of South Bay rivals.
The Santa Clara match was the
last non-conference game on the
Cardinal's schedule for 2007. The
team will now turn its attention to
Pac-10 play, opening the second half
of the season on Friday against
archrival California.
