said. "We gave it everything we had and our
team went out with strong intensity, but it just
wasn't enough at that point in the second half.
For sure we can beat them. This is one of the
best teams I've been on, and next time we play
[USCI, we'll be ready."
USC has the best defense in the nation, al
lowing an average of only 4.86 goals per game
on the season. And the final two quarters on
Saturday proved just that.
Senior goalkeeper Sandy Hohener had 11
saves for the Cardinal, but the Trojans still
managed to net three goals in the second half,
while the Stanford offense had no answer for
USC's defensive blockade. The game ended
with two lost opportunities for the Stanford

men, as USC stole the ball on the last two pos
sessions.
"They have a really good defense and a re
ally good center defender, so it's hard to get in
a goal-scoring position." sophomore utility
Drac Wigo said. "I think they have one of the
best defenses in all-around college."
Stanford has long had a successful tradition
in men's water polo, and this year's team is de
veloping into one of the best in recent memory,
with a real chance to take home the NCAA
championship at the end of the season.
"We've been known for our defense and
pride ourselves on intelligent play," Drac Wigo
said. "We need to stop making stupid mistakes
our team shouldn't make."

The game was Stanford's second showdown
with USC in the past few weeks, both resulting
in losses. Stanford's first loss to its nemesis
USC was at the NorCal Open,9-5,0n Sept. lb.
The Trojans extended their home winning
streak to 26 games and have won the last nine
meetings against the Stanford men.
"Small mistakes led to [a] couple of goals,"
Drac Wigo said. "We went over videos so we
won't make them again.
"The bad passes definitely led to turnovers.
They're a good team but if we played our best
we could've beat them."
Despite the loss, the players continue to em
phasize their teamwork and dedication to win
future games. Stanford's distinct style of smart

play relies more on egoless teamwork and solid
execution than on pure physical talent and raw
strength.
"Focusing a lot on everyone, figuring out
specific roles and what they can do makes the
team better," senior two-meter defender Peter
Finlayson said. "We have to play that much
more as a team and fundamentally and tactical
ly sound water polo."
The loss dropped the Cardinal to 1-1 in the
MPSF and 5-3 overall.
Stanford will look to bounce back against
No. 18 Princeton next Saturday at the SoCal
tournament hosted by UC-lrvine.
