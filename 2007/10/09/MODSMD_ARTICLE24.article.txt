Cardinal named Team of the Week

When 41-point underdog Stanford beat
No. 2 USC on Saturday, the entire nation
took notice. The attention has been fol
lowed by accolades, as the Cardinal was
named the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl National
Team of the Week yesterday.
The award, sponsored by Tostitos, is
given by the Football Writers of America,
who chose the Cardinal over other nomi
nees Cincinnati, Illinois and Missouri —
who are a combined 16-1 on the season.
But at the end of the day, the heroics of the
unsung Cardinal (2-3, 1-3 Pac-10) got the
nod.
The writers certainly seem to appreciate
upsets — the first weekly award of 2(X)7
went to Appalachian State after it knocked
off Michigan to open the season.
Stanford was also picked as one of four
nominees for the Pontiac Game Changing
Performance for the final-minute 10-yard
touchdown pass from Tavita Pritchard to
Mark Bradford.The winner will be decided
by public vote at pontiac.com/ncaa, with
the winning school receiving $5,000 and
the chance to win $100.0(X) if chosen as the
Game Changing Performance of the Year.
On a related note, a replay of the Stan
ford-USC game will be played in its entire-
