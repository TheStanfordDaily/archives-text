Cardinal named Team of the Week

When 41-point underdog Stanford beat
No. 2 USC on Saturday, the entire nation
took notice. The attention has been fol
lowed by accolades, as the Cardinal was
named the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl National
Team of the Week yesterday.
The award, sponsored by Tostitos, is
given by the Football Writers of America,
who chose the Cardinal over other nomi
nees Cincinnati, Illinois and Missouri —
who are a combined 16-1 on the season.
But at the end of the day, the heroics of the
unsung Cardinal (2-3, 1-3 Pac-10) got the
nod.
The writers certainly seem to appreciate
upsets — the first weekly award of 2(X)7
went to Appalachian State after it knocked
off Michigan to open the season.
Stanford was also picked as one of four
nominees for the Pontiac Game Changing
Performance for the final-minute 10-yard
touchdown pass from Tavita Pritchard to
Mark Bradford.The winner will be decided
by public vote at pontiac.com/ncaa, with
the winning school receiving $5,000 and
the chance to win $100.0(X) if chosen as the
Game Changing Performance of the Year.
On a related note, a replay of the Stan
ford-USC game will be played in its entire-
ty on Fox Sports Net Bay Area,
Wednesday at 8 p.m.

Bradford, Egboh named Pac
-10 Players of the Week

Along with the award given to
the entire team, two members of the
Stanford roster were selected for in
dividual honors by the Pacific-10
Conference. Senior wide receiver
Mark Bradford and junior defensive
end Pannel Egboh were named the
conference's US Bank Offensive
and Defensive Players of the Week,
respectively.
Bradford had five receptions for
87 yards and caught the winning
touchdown in a game that he dedi
cated to the memory of his late fa
ther.
Egboh was selected for the de
fensive play that allowed Bradford
to win the game with his touchdown.
Egboh blocked a first-half PAT at
tempt by the Trojans, a point that ul
timately decided the game. Egboh
finished the game with six solo tack
les and 10 total, 2.5 tackles for loss
and 1.5 sacks of USC quarterback
John David Booty.
This marks the second time that
Stanford players have picked up
weekly conference honors this year.
After Stanford's 37-0 win over San
Jose State, sophomore free safety
Bo McNally and senior Derek Belch
were Defensive Player and Kicker
of the Week, respectively.

Barboza named Pac-10 and
AVCA Player of the Week

While the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team's pair of
sweeps this weekend did not receive
the attention of the football team's
dramatic upset, the volleyball com
munity was watching.
Junior outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza led the Cardinal in sweeps
of both Oregon State and No. 19
Oregon and was named both Pac-10
Player of the Week and
AVCA/Sports Imports National
Player of the Week.
Barboza tallied 17 kills without
an error against the Beavers and fol
lowed that performance with 18
against the Ducks, hitting over .400
for the weekend.
She was also among the leaders
on the defensive side of the ball,
with 13 digs at Oregon State and 12
at Oregon, one shy of the team high
in both matches.
It is the second time Barboza has
received the conference weekly
honor and her first time this season.
The Cardinal has now had players
honored by the Pac-10 four of the six
weeks of the season. Freshman out
side hitter Alix Klineman won the
first week, and junior middle block
er Foluke Akinradewo has been
picked twice already in 2007.
It is Barboza's first national
weekly award. Senior setter Bryn
Kehoe was the last Cardinal player
to win it: she received the honor in
November 2006.
