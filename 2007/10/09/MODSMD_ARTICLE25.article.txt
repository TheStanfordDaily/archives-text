could beat the team below them.
Rank Last Week Comment
1. LSU 1 It pays to be aggressive: five fourth-down conversions
in Florida win.
2. Ohio State 3 Exposed Purdue, but how good are they? No top-ten
foes on schedule. .
3. USC 2 Were shocked last year (Oregon State) too; ended up
winning the Rose Bowl.
4. Oklahoma 4 Missouri's visit this week only remaining hurdle to 11 -
1. '03 LSU rematch?
5. Florida 6 No shame in close fourth-quarter loss at LSU. Playcall
ing a struggle, though.
6. California 5 Best news from USC loss: Cal can't make Rose Bowl
with only loss to Trojans.
7. Oregon 7 Remaining toughies (ASU, USC) at home. Pac-10
better than SEC this year.
8. Virginia Tech 8 Led Clemson 31-8. Nation's most underrated team will
wallop BC in two weeks.
9. South Carolina 11 Say hello to your new SEC East leader. Two easy ones,
then at Tennessee.
10. Michigan 10 Two ugly wins against crappy teams hurts. Purdue and
Illinois on deck.
11. West Virginia 9 QB White injured and Louisville, Rutgers, Cincinnati in
next four games.
12. Arizona State 18 Last-second FG needed versus Washington State. Eek.
13. Wisconsin 14 Last week: "Think the Cinderella run ends over next two
weeks." Yup.
14. Florida State 19 Word "offense" still contradictory, but defense proba -
bly top-ten in country.
15. fexas 13 Bad start, but anyone really think they couldn't beat
the teams below?
16. iennessee NR Just embarrassed Georgia. Only losses are to Cal,
Florida — no shame.
17. Missouri 25 Just demolished Nebraska, and Week 1 win at Illinois
keeps looking better.
18. Boston College 20 Still haven't beat anyone; pollsters see a "0" in the L
column and lose rationality.
19. South Horida 16 Ditto after squeaking past Florida Atlantic. Most over
rated team at No. 5.
20. Illinois NR Penn State, now Wisconsin's latest victims. But best
road win Indiana.
21. Hawaii 22 Run the table and BCS berth is all yours with weekend's
upsets.
22. Kentucky 23 Last week: "Way overrated, next three games will show
it." This week, LSU.
23. Purdue NR Ugly Ohio State loss, but, really, who else goes here?
10-2 finish in Little Ten?
24. Cincinnati NR Just got past Rutgers to move to 6-0. Could be the team
to kill off South Florida.
25. Kansas NR Will be Big 12's only undefeated team when OU beats
Mizzou. What were the odds?
