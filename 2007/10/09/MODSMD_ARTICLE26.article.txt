## YouTube clips to help Google profit 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Google Inc. will begin show
ing You Tube videos on thousands of other Web sites, hop
ing to profit from ads attached to the clips.
The expansion, scheduled to be announced Tuesday,
represents the Internet search leader's farthest-reaching
attempt yet to cash in on its $1.76 billion acquisition of
You Tube since the deal closed 11 months ago.
Google already shows some video ads on clips on
You Tube's own site.
The ads accompanying the outbound You Tube clips
won't be in a video format. Instead, they will appear as a
graphic straddling the video or as a link along the bottom.
Mountain View-based Google began showing ad-sup
ported You Tube videos on a handful of Web sites earlier
this year. Now. it's reaching out to its entire "AdSense"
network - an array of large and small Web publishers.
But Google won't be pulling clips from You Tube's en
tire library, which includes a multitude of wacky seg
ments contributed by amateur videographers. The mate
rial sent to other Web sites will be confined to video from

providers who sign consent forms.
If the broader distribution of video pays off, it could
encourage Google to distribute other types of content,
including news stories and audio files, across its vast net
work of advertising partners.
Until now, Google only had been delivering ads tied to
the search requests and other content on the pages of its
AdSense partners.
With the new twist, Web sites participating in AdSense
now can sign up to specify the kinds of You Tube videos
they want shown on their pages. A Web site focused on
automobiles, for instance, might want to display You Tube
videos about cars and other vehicles.
More than 1(X) video providers - mostly professionals
- have agreed to allow Google to distribute their content.
Initial participants include TV Guide Broadband, Expert
Village. Mondo Media and Extreme Elements.
Google will share the ad revenue generated by the
You Tube videos with the content provider and the Web
site that shows the clips.
Google, which doesn't break down its revenue-shar
ing arrangements, historically gives 60 to 80 percent of
the money to its advertising partners.
