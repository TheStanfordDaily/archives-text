## Gene work earns Nobel Prize Researchers pioneer technique for gene manipulation 
### MALCOLM RITTER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) As a child in Italy during World War
11. he lived for years on the streets and in orphanages.
Six decades later, as a scientist in the United States.
Mario Capecchi joined two other researchers in win
ning the Nobel Prize in medicine.
Their work led to a powerful and widely used tech
nique to manipulate genes in mice, which has helped sci
entists study heart disease, diabetes, cancer, cystic fibro
sis and other diseases.
The $1.54 million prize was awarded Monday to
Capecchi, 70. of the University of Utah in Salt Lake
City; Oliver Smithies, 82, a native of Britain now at Uni
versity of North Carolina in Chapel I till, and Sir Martin
J. Evans. 66, of Cardiff University in Wales.
Their "gene-targeting" technique lets scientists de
activate or modifying individual genes in mice and ob
serve how those changes affect the animals.That in turn
gives clues about what those genes do in human health
and disease.
The work has had "a revolutionary effect on the abil
ity to understand how genes work." said Richard Woy
chik. director of The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor,
Maine, a center for mouse genetics.
The prize is a particularly striking accomplishment
for Capecchi (pronounced kuh-PEK'-ee). A native of
Italy, he was separated from his mother at age 3 when
the Gestapo took her to the Dachau concentration
camp as a political prisoner in 1941. His mother, a poet,
and his father, an Italian military officer, were not mar
ried.
Capecchi spent a year with a peasant family, until the
money his mother left for his care ran out. At age 4,"1
started wandering the streets," he recalled Monday. For
about four years, he lived on the streets or in orphan
ages. and he ended up in a hospital with malnutrition.
Dachau was liberated in 1945 and his mother sur
vived.
"Then she set out to find me."searching through hos
pital records. "I was in a hospital and when they keep
you in a hospital, they didn't want you to run around.
ITiey took your clothes away. She came and bought me
an outfit."
She showed up on Capecchi's 9th birthday. Soon
thereafter, "we were on a boat to America ... I literally
expected roads to be paved with gold. What I found was.
it was a land of opportunity," he said.
In the United States, he went to school for the first
time, starting in third grade despite not knowing Eng
lish.
The three prize-winning scientists mostly worked
separately, although they exchanged information about

their research. Evans identified embryonic stem cells in
mice, while the gene-targeting technique used on those
cells came from work by Capecchi and Smithies.
Capecchi's work has uncovered the roles of genes in
volved in organ development in mammals, the commit
tee said. Evans developed strains of gene-altered mice
to study cystic fibrosis, and Smithies created strains to
study such conditions as high blood pressure and heart
disease.
To create gene-altered mice, researchers introduce a
genetic change into mouse embryonic stem cells. These
cells are then injected into mouse embryos. The mice
born from these embryos are bred to produce offspring
with the changed genes.
In 1989. the first mice born with genes manipulated
through the technique was announced. More than
lO.(KK) different genes in mice have since been studied
this way,the Nobel committee siyd.That's about half the
genes the rodents have.
Apart from making mice with altered DNA, the
work has also shown how to manipulate genes in human
embryonic stem cells for lab research. Such basic stud
ies can help scientists learn how to turn the cells into
specialized cells that might prove useful in therapy, said
Doug Melton, co-director of the 1 larvard Stem Cell In
stitute.
And scientists hope that by putting disease-related
genes into human embryonic cells for lab studies, they
can learn how the diseases develop and screen poten
tial therapies,said John Gearhart,a stem cell expert at
the Johns I lopkins School of Medicine.
The prize-winning work has "formed the foundation
for much of what we do" in human embryonic stem cell
research. Melton said.
Evans, asked Monday about the prize while visiting
his daughter in Cambridge, England, said. '1 haven't
come to terms with it yet. In many ways it is the boyhood
aspiration of science, isn't it? And here 1 am unexpect
edly with it. It's amazing."
Moments after a 5 a.m. call from Sweden, Smithies
called the Nobel "very gratifying."
"My work was never toward getting the Nobel
Prize," Smithies told The Associated Press over a cup of
tea at his lab a few hours after the Nobel committee
called with the news. "It was solving a problem, and en
joying the solution."
Smithies said he hopes winning the prize will make it
easier to secure funding for other work.
The medicine prize was the first of the six prestigious
awards to be announced this year.The others are chem
istry, physics, literature, peace and economics.
The prizes arc handed out every year on Dec. 11). the
anniversary of award founder Alfred Nobel's death in
1896.
Since the medicine prize was first awarded in 1901.
90 Americans and 29 Britons have received it.
