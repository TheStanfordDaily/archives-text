# Cardinal Care mix-up
## Mistaken insurance card mailing confuses students; Vaden faults company 
### JOANNA XU 
Stanford students don't need extra bills
on top of the already hefty University tu
ition, especially for an unwanted health in
surance plan. But many students across cam
pus were led to believe that they did owe this
extra fee after receiving a Cardinal Care ID
card in the mail last month as a result of a file
mix-up.
The Vaden Health Center Insurance Of
fice sent out a clarification email last Thurs
day to the approximately 6,000 undergradu
ate and graduate students who chose to opt
out of the Cardinal Care insurance plan, ac
cording to Vaden administrators. The email
reassured students that they were never en
rolled in the Cardinal Care plan and that
they "are not being charged for the insur
ance premium."
The Insurance Office also requested that
affected students discard the ID that they re
ceived. The ID cards have already been void-

Ed by Chickering, the student insurance
company that administers Cardinal Care.
"i understand that this has caused a lot of
confusion," said Vaden Health Center Asso
ciate Director Amy Baldwin. "Chickering
got a final list of Cardinal Care enrollees
from us in late September. Their computer
failed to delete the students who were on a
summertime preliminary list and incorrectly
sent them ID cards. Vaden's Insurance Of
fice has emailed all of the affected students
telling them to discard the cards."
Students were concerned about the mix
up.
"My mom got the card in the mail back
home," said Cameron Mansson-Perrone '11.
"[She] was worried that I'd forgotten to
waive the Stanford insurance plan."
While many students were alerted to the
error, conflicting reports arose as to how
many students incorrectly received ID cards.
An operator at the Aetna/Chickering
Group said that roughly 700 files had been

confused, while Baldwin estimated that the
mix-up affected approximately 4.500 stu
dents.
Each year, nearly half of Stanford's
14,000 students waive Cardinal Care in favor
of outside insurance. According to Judy Fox,
manager of the Vaden Insurance and Refer
ral Office, all students who waived Cardinal
Care received the email, regardless of
whether they were actually sent a card.
"I got the email from Vaden." said Clau
dia Chern *11. "but I've never gotten a card,
and nobody I know has."
Those who did receive a card were ulti
mately relieved that the error had no finan
cial complications.
"1 was worried when I first received the
ID card." said Rebecca Eskin '09. "But then
1 checked my Stanford ePay and it said that
I had waived Cardinal Care and wasn't
billed."
