## Athlete graduation rates high NCAA report shows Cardinal athletes strong in the classroom 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
The same Stanford students who take
home the Directors' Cup — and the same
football players who heat USC on Saturday
— are also taking home good grades.
In an NCAA report on graduation rates at
Division 1-A schools released last week. Stan
ford athletes performed in line with the Uni
versity's distinguished academic reputation.
The report charted the percentage of varsity
student athletes who received a degree be
tween 2003 and 2006.
Compared to other Pacific-10 schools,
Stanford did particularly well, sporting a 93
percent graduation rate for football that put
the University far above its conference peers
— UC-Berkeley's football graduation rate
was 52 percent.
Stanford also out-performed national av
erages in every sport excopt women's fencing.
Overall, the graduation rates for most
sports were relatively similar to years past.
Some teams saw minor gains,such as baseball,
which rose three points from 93 percent in
2006 to 96 percent this year. Others showed
dramatic improvement, including men's gym
nastics— from 89 percent to 100 percent —
and women's tennis — up 17 percentage
points from 83 last year to 100 percent in 2007.
Other teams, however, saw their gradua
tion rates fall from last year. Men's basketball
players graduated at a rate of 67 percent,
down from 92 percent in 2005. Women's fenc
ing fell to 50 percent, down from 100 percent
in 2005.
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby explained
some of the major changes.
"The (sample) sizes are small due to the
small number of recruits each year, so the
rates vary widely." Bowlsby said in an email to
The Daiiy. "For instance, if only one out of
three students fails to graduate, the percent
age falls to 67 percent. This looks low com
pared to other sports, but it can rebound to
100 percent very easily."
Bowlsby also said that the Athletics De
partment manages its program "based on
Stanford's priorities, not comparisons with
other schools."
Stanford's high graduation rates should
come as no surprise at a school that prides it-
