# Faith space opens
## Old Union facility promotes interfaith worship 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
On the third floor of Old Union, a new
space for religious diversity gives students a
new venue for interfaith prayer. The Center
for Inter-Religious Community, Learning and
Experiences (CIRCLE) houses offices for a
variety of religious leaders, a seminar room, a
religious library and a large sacred room
called the sanctuary
Linda Miller, the coordinator of CIRCLE,
said the design for the interfaith center came
after many months of planning and dialogue
with Stanford's religious community
"We engaged in many, many meetings for
over a year's time with all the SAR (Stanford
Associated Religions] groups," she said. "We
wanted to get as much input as possible."
Miller added that the planning group also
used questionnaires and maintained dis
course with both the SAR and the Deans of
Religious Life.
"Our purpose was to create a space in
which Muslim, Baha'i, Buddhist. Christian.
Hindu. Jewish and Unitarian Universalist stu
dents. along with agnostics, would feel com

fortable," she said.
Zaid Adhami '10, vice president of the
Muslim Students Awareness Network
(MSAN). said that the Muslim students have
benefited substantially from the CIRCLE,
particularly during Ramadan.
"The Muslim community on campus is
pretty pleased with the new space for religious
life on the third floor," Adhami said. "Al
though our own prayer room is rather small,
it's still a really nice accommodation, and hav
ing the sanctuary room makes it perfectly
fine."
He added that the Muslim community has
been using the CI RCLE space frequently dur
ing the past three weeks for nightly Ramadan
prayers.
"We feel at home there, free to do what we
need to do" he said. "It definitely beats run
ning around from building to building every
Friday or praying in a tent during Ramadan."
The wood-paneled sanctuary has windows
facing east and benches with red cushions
along the walls. Decorated with silk, the space
was designed to be flexible in order to accom-

modate the needs of various reli
gious groups.
Instead of pews, the sanctuary has
chairs that can be arranged for large
sermons, intimate gatherings or re
moved entirely. Just outside the
sanctuary are separate men's and
women's foot-washing rooms. Large
black sinks are positioned close to
the ground for wudu so Muslim wor
shippers can wash before prayer.
Since the CIRCLE'S opening, re
ligious groups have been gracious
about sharing the sanctuary space.
"Students have been cooperative
so far," Miller said. "When Rosh
Hashanah and Ramadan over
lapped. the Jewish group Chabad
and the Muslim group worked out a

way to share the space with one com
ing in the morning and one in the
evening. When they both needed
sunset services, the Muslim students
offered to use another space."
An added benefit of the inter-re
ligious center is increased dialogue
between members of different faiths,
which has created an environment of
learning and mutual respect.
"The space is truly valuable be
cause it offers a location for follow
ers of different faiths to come to
gether and carry out their own prac
tices and prayers," said Lan Le '10. a
member of the Buddhist Communi
ty at Stanford (BCAS). "A common
area as well as rooms for the differ
ent religious groups show that reli
gions can coexist peacefully and har
moniously under one roof."
CIRCLE is still a work in
progress, and small additions like la
bels for rooms and screens for pre
sentations are still being made. Still,

the space has already become a pop
ular spot for worship and religious
appreciation.
"A couple of evenings ago, I was
reciting texts in our room when I
heard the Muslim call to prayer com
ing from the sanctuary," said Trent
Walker '10, president of BCAS.
"What other spaces at Stanford —
indeed, in the world — allow for this
kind of atmosphere, where we can
sing in our own tradition and listen
to the voices of other traditions
too?"
