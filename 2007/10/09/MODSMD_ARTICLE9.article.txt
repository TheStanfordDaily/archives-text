## The 						Bubble Indians eliminate Yankees from playoffs 
### 
NEW YORK (AF) â€” Joe
Borowski threw the final strike and
the Cleveland Indians ran onto the
infield to start the celebration.
Alex Rodriguez, one leg on the
top step of the New York Yankees
dugout, stared straight ahead.
The Indians were on their way
to an AL championship series
matchup with the Boston Red
Sox. The Yankees were braced for
a showdown with their boss, one
that could cost Joe Torre his job.
Believe it, Indians fans. Grady
Sizemore homered to put Cleve
land ahead for good on the third
pitch of the game, then Paul Byrd
and the bullpen closed out New
York 6-4 in Game 4 Monday night
to complete the third straight first
round debacle for the Yankees.
"This team hasn't had a cham
pionship in Cleveland for a long
time." said Kenny Lofton, the vet
eran who hit .375 for the Indians.
"This is just an unbelievable feel
ing to be able just to start this
process again. "
Torre, as much the focus as the
teams, sounded wistful in what
well may have been his final night
in pinstripes.
"This has been a great 12 years.
Whatever the hell happens from
here on out, I'll look back on these
12 years with great, great pleas
ure," he said, his voice quavering
as he tried to avoid choking up.
"The 12 years just felt like they
were 10 minutes long, to be honest
with you."
He wouldn't address his future.
"If I have some options, I'll
look at it because I'm certainly
not ready to move somewhere
and not do anything." the 67-year
old New Yorker said.
