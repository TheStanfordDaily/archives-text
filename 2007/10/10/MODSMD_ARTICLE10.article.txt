# Gumballs for good
## Organization channels money to Bangladeshi farmers, New Haven clown 
### BEYANG LIU 
Stanford students are turning gumballs into cash for
the working poor.
The Gumball Challenge is simple: loan $27 and 27
gumballs to student teams on college campuses and let
them compete to find the most creative, imaginative way
to use those materials to generate revenue for their
cause.
Founded in February by a group of students for Stan
ford's first annual Entrepreneurship Week. Gumball
Capital began with just $30in Post-its, which it used toso
licit more than $4,000 over three days from individual
student donations.
Now. Gumball Capital is broadening its horizons, in
corporating students at Yale, St. Olaf College, The Uni
versity of the South and UC Berkeley. On Nov. 27. teams
from these schools will join Stanford in participating in
the first annual Gumball Challenge Week.
While money from all competitions will go to charita
ble causes, Gumball Capital expects different results
from every school.
At Yale, Gumball members have gone local, lending
money already raised to domestic borrowers mostly in
the New Haven area.
University of the South Gumball members have
looked around the world, forming a partnership with mi
crolender Grameen Bank to send children of poor
Bangladeshi borrowers to school.
"Each campus will facilitate its own competition,"
said Gumball Director Kalvin Wang '08,"We expect the
look and feel of the competition to be different at differ
ent schools."
Wang and Outreach Director Sophia Tu '08 said that
individual teams decide where to send the money they
raise.The important part, they said, is combining a chari
table cause with an entrepreneurial spirit.

They're entrepreneurs helping out entrepreneurs: the
associated Gumball Fund works through microfinance,
the practice of lending small sums to small-scale enter
prisers usually overlooked by mainstream multinational
banks: farmers, street vendors and small business own
ers.

Why not traditional charity?
"It's the idea of sustainability, not a handout,'
said TU. "We provide people with the resources
needed tojumpstart their ideas. Microfinance is
a global development strategy. It's dignified,
unimposing. and encourages people to take ini
tiative."

The Gumball Fund makes loans through a
non-profit organization called Kiva that con
nects individual borrowers from around the
world with small-scale lenders.

"Kiva is like the eßay of the microfi
nance world." said Wang, "There's no
body else quite like them who provides
a consumer-level experience that al
lows lenders to see and read the stories
of the people they're lending to."
"Loans are made in $25 incre
ments," notedTu,"so it's very approach
able for college students and you are ac
tually able to see your impact."

On some campuses, the lending has al
ready started. Ihe Yale Gumball branch
has made direct microloans to local resi
dents like clown "Uncle Chip" Murphy, who
used his loan to buy a cotton candy and pop
corn machine.

"It began as a one-week project," said Wang,"but
we've transitioned to something bigger."
