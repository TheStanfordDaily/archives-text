WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A Ger
man man who says he was abducted
and tortured by the CIA as part of
the anti-terrorism program lost his
final chance TUesday to persuade
U.S. courts to hear his claims.
The Supreme Court rejected
without comment the appeal from
Khaled el-Masri, effectively en
dorsing Bush administration argu
ments that state secrets would be
revealed if courts allowed the case
to proceed.
El-Masri. a German citizen of
Lebanese descent, says he was mis
takenly identified as an associate of
the Sept. 11 hijackers and was de
tained while attempting to enter
Macedonia.
El-Masri's lawsuit had been seen
as a test of the administration's legal
strategy to invoke the doctrine of
state secrets and stop national secu
rity suits before any evidence is pre
sented in private to a judge
