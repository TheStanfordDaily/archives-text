## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — A migraine
pill seems to help alcoholics taper
off their drinking, researchers re
port.
Experts said the drug,Topamax,
is likely to appeal to heavy
drinkers who would rather seek
help from their own doctors, rather
than enter a rehab clinic to dry out.
The drug costs at least $350 a
month, plus the price of doctor's
visits.
Addiction specialists said the
findings are promising, although
side effects such as trouble concen
trating, tingling and itching caused
about one in five people to drop
out of the study. Drowsiness and
dizziness are also problems.
"You can come in drinking a
bottle of scotch a day and get treat
ment without detox," said Dr.
Bankole Johnson of the University
of Virginia, who led the study.
