## ASSU tackles cost of living, OSA Committees pose solutions to high-profile student issues 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At last night's meeting, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate consolidated
its goals for the 2007-2008 academic
year and established its top priorities
— reducing the average cost of stu
dent living and working to enhance
the role of the Office of Student Af
fairs (OSA).
Senate Deputy Chair Eugene
Nho '10 detailed efforts to decrease
the cost of student living. He target
ed four different goals: reducing the
cost of course readers, encouraging
faculty to upload class reading as
signments online, increasing the
bookstore's buyback values and im
proving the library reserve system.
The Committee of Student Life,
Housing and Education began work
on these issues during its first meet
ing.
"We have a two-pronged ap
proach," Nho said of the Commit
tee's efforts to reduce course reader
prices, "so we don't have to pay
ridiculous mark-up at the book
store."
"First, we want to convince facul
ty that [using outside printers] is
truly benefiting the student body.
Second, [we need to] negotiate with
printing shops on getting certain
things, such as logistics of distribu
tion and the tailoring of services, be
fore we go to the faculty," he said.
"When it comes to faculty members,
working with outside printing shops
should be as easy as possible."
Regarding the OSA. Nho stressed

the need to increase transparency
between the ASSU, OSA and the
student body itself. He emphasized
the OSA's lack of availability and
outreach to students.
"['The OSA] is not able to offer
good enough services to the students
[due to its understaffing]," Nho said.
"[lts] office hours are just two hours,
[leaving only enough time] for a cou
ple groups to meet with [OSA Direc
tor] Nanci Howe. When it is really
critical, no one is available to meet."
Senators are also working to ob
tain a LateNite delivery system and
improve the late plate system in din
ing halls.
Senator Jose Benchimol '08, com
munications committee chair, an
nounced the beginning of ASSU
Senate office hours, which will be
held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
from 4 to 5 p.m. at the Axe & Palm.
"The purpose of office hours,"
Benchimol stated, "is to get students
that have any issues or ideas to come
to us — whether it's questions about
funding,creating new student groups
or getting involved in ASSU. It is a
more friendly way for the students to
approach us."
The meeting concluded on a
lighter note with the unanimous
passing of the eighth undergraduate
senate bill — A Resolution to Ex
press Congratulations to the Stan
ford Football Team.
"Historically, the Senate passes
congratulatory resolutions," said
Senator Stuart Baimel '09. "1 thought
this would be a good thing to do, as it
makes it the official position of the
Undergraduate Senate that we shall
beat Cal!"
