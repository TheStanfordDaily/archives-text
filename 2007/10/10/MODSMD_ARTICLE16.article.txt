## Editorial Board It's not about the bike 
### 
A few years ago, students in a Stanford
Institute of Design (d.school) class.
Mechanical Engineering 377: "Ex
periences in Innovation and Design Think
ing," erected a makeshift sculpture of
crashed bikes in homage to the Stanford
biking experience. The Daily feels that this
work of art is symbolic of the mess that is
campus biking and believes steps should be
taken to rectify the chaotic and dangerous
state of affairs that exists at the Farm.
Safety should be everyone's first priority.
Just because we're at college and away from
our parents doesn't mean that we are sud
denly impervious to being struck by a cell
phone-toting biker as we pass Meyer Li
brary; independence does not equal invinci
bility, as any Math 51 student knows.
Assuming that Stanford will never be a
biking Utopia, the most important thing a
biker can do to protect him or herself is what
our parents have been drilling into our (un
protected) heads for years — wear a hel
met. The Stanford Hospital sees about 200
patients every year as a result of bike acci
dents ("Bike accidents abound on campus,"
Nov. 8,2004), and police statistics from 2005
show that an average of two students per
week were hospitalized for bike accidents
("Police ban bikes from Main Quad." Sept.
19,2006). If these statistics merely seem like
a bunch of numbers, look around your
IHUM or bio core lecture — and picture
about half of the class in the hospital over
the course of the year.
Wearing a helmet is often deemed "un
cool," and the numbers stand behind this
notion: only two percent of undergraduates
wear helmets ("Bike accidents abound on
campus," Nov. 8,2004). In a university filled
with intelligent people, one would think that
safety would trump looking suitably hip.
What good is all that brainpower if it's
lying on the pavement? What if the next
Sergei Brin is felled in the newly enhanced
Intersection of Death and a helmet could
have averted catastrophe? Ruining a per

fectly coifed hairdo is a small price to pay for
safety.
Along the same lines, to the the dim stu
dents who bike at night without using lights,
follow the bright kids' leads. Unlike riding
without a helmet, riding without a light isn't
even a matter of inviting public scorn. It's
just plain carelessness — and against the
law.
About 33 percent of bike accidents in the
country occur between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.. ac
cording to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, and being indistin
guishable in the dark while pedaling along
at a heady 10 miles per hour certainly does
n't help such numbers. So take this bit of
Daily illumination and buy yourself a bike
light — they even come with cool flashing
LED settings.
In addition to wearing helmets and using
lights at night, obeying stop sign and anti
headphone laws would further promote
public safety. The onus is not completely on
students: Stanford police should uniformly
enforce these laws — not just on the second
Tuesday of every month.The Daily is not ad
vocating more bike tickets, but supports en
forcement of laws intended to protect com
munity members.
Roughly 60 bike accidents are reported
on campus each year, not including the un
reported run-into-your-friend-as-you
leave-the-dorm disentanglings and sheepish
apologies ("Bike accidents abound on cam
pus." Nov. 8, 2004). Being a bit more
thoughtful about your biking habits could
prevent many such incidents.
Lance Armstrong's autobiography is en
titled "It's Not About the Bike," and it isn't
— it's about the rider, safety, convenience
and the campus climate we'd like to have.
Yes, Stanford prides itself on being laid
back and unrestrictive. However, observing
just a few of these simple rules could greatly
enhance the biking situation on campus for
everyone; it's time to kick our efforts into
high gear.
