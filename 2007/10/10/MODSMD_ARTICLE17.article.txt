## Hillary's problem with the 'B-Word' 
### 
For all the talk of Senator Barack
Obama's (D-lll.) race and his battle
against Senator Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.) for the crucial African-American vote,
there's been remarkably little talk of Clin
ton's gender. This is surprising, because her
gender might be a much greater problem in
the general election than Obama's race.
Hillary's problem is not so much the fact
that she is a woman as that she is perceived to
be something highly negative and applied al
most uniformly to women — a "bitch." a
term levied mostly, but not entirely, toward
her by men. It's an informal term, and not
necessarily said aloud. The word is used for
several reasons — she's perceived as "cold
and calculating" — someone who stayed
with her philandering husband just because
she wants power. One Web site declares,
rather cleverly, "life's a bitch. Don't elect
one."
This is interesting, because I don't think
Hillary has behaved worse,or "bitchier," than
any of her male competitors. Rudy Giuliani
announced his divorce from his second wife
during a press conference — and she found
out by watching it on TV. Senator John Mc-
Cain (R-Ariz.) essentially sold his soul to the
Bush administration, giving up his "maver
ick" status in order to be the early front-run
ner for the nomination. John Edwards has es
sentially been campaigning for the 2008 nom
ination since the day after the 2004 election,
changing his political rhetoric at will. Senator
Clinton is no less focused on the presidency
than any of the other candidates, all of whom
have been planning their campaigns for years
in advance, as she has.
It seems, then, that Senator Clinton is
being held to a double standard, or in any
case, a different standard than her male com
petitors. She's behaved politically much as
the male presidential candidates have, and is
judged differently — and negatively — for
it. It seems that the Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-
Calif.) model — playing the "grandmother"
card, surrounding herself with children at the
opening of the new Congress — seems to be
more effective and palatable to male voters.
However. Senator Clinton's record in
Congress is one of bipartisan success—
something almost entirely ignored in favor of
personality judgment and her behavior dur
ing the health care fiasco of 1993-1994. The
American people weren't particularly keen
on her taking over certain areas of policy,and
Bill Clinton's famous "two for one" comment

before he was elected did not help matters.
Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) won only
36 percent of the white male vote in 20()4, es
sentially the same amount that A 1 Gore won
in 2000. White males comprise a whopping 39
percent of the electorate, a percentage which
is larger in swing states like lowa and Ohio.
The Democrats' main failure in the past two
elections was not holding their base together.
Jews, African Americans and others still
voted Democratic as reliably as they have in
the past, but the party got crushed among
white male voters — the same demographic
who is likely to have a negative perception of
Clinton due to her perceived "bitchiness."
This is a problem for Clinton if she wins the
Democratic nomination — Democratic pri
mary voters are disproportionately non
white and female compared to the general
electorate.
A Rasmussen aggregate poll shows that
among women, Hillary is viewed favorably
by 59 percent and unfavorably by 36 percent.
Among men, the numbers change drastically
to 47 percent and 49 percent. That is a very
significant gender gap. What the polls also
show is that the gender gap favorability is
greatest among people in the political center
— in other words, independents. Those are
the people that she needs to capture to win
the presidency and avoid relegating the De
mocrats to a third term outside of the White
House.
This raises the question of whether Amer
ica truly is ready for a female president and
what more has to be done so that it is. Hillary
may lead the Democratic nomination. She
may be favored by the political markets and
odds-makers to win both the primary and
general election. Unfortunately, she may not
be able to conquer substantial negative per
ceptions for behaving no differently than any
other male politician.

Smart really does love female politicians, espe
cially Yulia Tymoshenko. Google her. No, real
ly. Send your favorite Yulia photo to Stuart at
