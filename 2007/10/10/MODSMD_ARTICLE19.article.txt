# The 						Lowly Interns
## Morning rush 
### 
Dawn breaks, and our intrepid hero
(me) is about to wake up for his first
day of work at his new D.C. intern
ship. He has just moved into the cushy house
a few days ago and been awed by the person
al bathrooms, the other ridiculously qualified
students, and the restaurant-quality food.
On the other hand, there's the really ugly
bedding, the 24/7 event schedule, and the
three-hour time difference with California.
But he'll adjust...probably. Welcome to Stan
ford in Washington.
Somehow managing to wake himself at
the ungodly hour of 7am, the soon-to-be in
tern is confronted by the first dilemma of the
day: what to wear to work.
A quick aside: People labor under the
misconception that business clothing for
guys is simple. Just because women have to
bring pantsuits and skirts and blouses and
cocktail dresses and evening gowns and
stockings and pantyhose and heels and flats
and pumps and close-toed shoes and open
toed shoes (take breath here), that doesn't
give them any excuse to complain.
Guys have the terrible dilemma of having
to pick a matching shirt and tie. I spent hours
this summer looking at formal clothes, driv
ing from department stores to outlet malls.
Every time I liked a shirt. I would have to
find a tie that carried the shirt's color just so
and that differed in pattern just the right
amount. I took to keeping all the shirts I was
bringing to DC. in the car so that I could
compare each one to every tie that I thought
I liked. They should teach a class on colors.
No one ever comes out and tells you that you
shouldn't wear a green tie on a red shirt un
less it's Christmas time.
Anyway, having finally dressed and
washed, our hero takes his next big step and
goes down for breakfast. Although he isn't
used to it, the food options are too tempting,
and he stuffs himself full of Continental
Breakfast glory.
Then he remembers his next responsibili

ty. In Washington, it is necessary to have a
fully working knowledge of all the goings-on
in The New York Times and The Washington
Post — so that you can laugh conspiratorial
ly with co-workers about the over-friendly
Senator Craig or the groundbreaking scien
tific study revealing that senior citizens have
sex. With each other...Yeah, next topic.
Reading the newspapers takes time, and
although he awoke early, he realizes he's got
only about half an hour to get to work by
spelunking in the dark depths of the D.C.
Metro subway system.
Some sort of public commuter transit sys
tem is in place in every major city, and every
single one has at least three things in com
mon. First, they each have gum all over the
handrails, which you avoid only to find your
face stuck in front of a Viagra ad with graffi
ti all over a very happy-looking old man. Sec
ond. public trains all have, at the ratio of ap
proximately one per car. a slightly unsettling
hunched man with a dust-filled beard grum
bling to himself in one of the corner seats.
Third, there's always a friendly neighbor
hood pickpocket who loves to scope out the
youngest and most flustered-looking of the
passengers. Just ask another one of the Stan
ford in Washington students, who. also on his
first day. found himself stuck on Capitol Hill
with a foreign-sounding name, no photo ID,
and a notice that someone was using his card
at a 7-11 in the boonies of Maryland.
After braving the Metro and luckily keep
ing his wallet in place.our exhausted traveler
finally makes it back into the sunlight. As he
moves down the street, he's having a hard
time ignoring the savage, hard-leather shoes
which are already chomping merrily into his
ankles. He fondly remembers wearing his
flip-flops, but of course flip-flops wouldn't fit
within the proper SOP. If there's one thing to
remember, it's that whenever you don't
know what to do, you follow the Standard
Operating Procedures, and you can't go
wrong. Except if you happen to be part of a

military that is only used to fighting conven
tional wars, and you're supposed to he fight
ing "irregular warfare," hut that's a different
story.
At last, our battle-worn intern enters his
building, sweating heavily in the heat, and
steps into the elevator. He will barely be on
time to meet his supervisor and hopes he can
then get started meeting as many important
people he can (don't deny it. that's the only
reason anyone interns in Washington). As
the elevator door shuts, he wonders how long
it will take to figure out secret ways to go on
Facebook. No matter, he's here on time, and
that's good enough for a solid first impres
sion.
Until the cramped elevator suddenly
drops half a foot and freezes. For nearly an
hour. With other people crowding next to
him. Without air-conditioning. In a full suit.
On his first day at work.
Our intern can't believe what's happen
ing. All he remembers is that when in doubt,
follow an SOP. So he dutifully collects busi
ness cards from all the other people in the el
evator and promises to be in touch, rhen, he
sits down while the engineering crew scrab
bles around on top of the elevator trying to
free him, or at least poke open an air hole.
Still following the Washington SOP, our in
tern thinks hard: there must be a way to
blame President Bush for this. too.

first day. found himself stuck on Capitol Hill
with a foreign-sounding name, no photo ID,
and a notice that someone was using his card
at a 7-11 in the boonies of Maryland.
After braving the Metro and luckily keep
ing his wallet in place.our exhausted traveler
finally makes it back into the sunlight. As he
moves down the street, he's having a hard
time ignoring the savage, hard-leather shoes
which are already chomping merrily into his
ankles. He fondly remembers wearing his
flip-flops, but of course flip-flops wouldn't fit
within the proper SOP. If there's one thing to
remember, it's that whenever you don't
know what to do, you follow the Standard
Operating Procedures, and you can't go
wrong. Except if you happen to be part of a

military that is only used to fighting conven
tional wars, and you're supposed to he fight
ing "irregular warfare," hut that's a different
story.
At last, our battle-worn intern enters his
building, sweating heavily in the heat, and
steps into the elevator. He will barely be on
time to meet his supervisor and hopes he can
then get started meeting as many important
people he can (don't deny it. that's the only
reason anyone interns in Washington). As
the elevator door shuts, he wonders how long
it will take to figure out secret ways to go on
Facebook. No matter, he's here on time, and
that's good enough for a solid first impres
sion.
Until the cramped elevator suddenly
drops half a foot and freezes. For nearly an
hour. With other people crowding next to
him. Without air-conditioning. In a full suit.
On his first day at work.
Our intern can't believe what's happen
ing. All he remembers is that when in doubt,
follow an SOP. So he dutifully collects busi
ness cards from all the other people in the el
evator and promises to be in touch, rhen, he
sits down while the engineering crew scrab
bles around on top of the elevator trying to
free him, or at least poke open an air hole.
Still following the Washington SOP, our in
tern thinks hard: there must be a way to
blame President Bush for this. too.
