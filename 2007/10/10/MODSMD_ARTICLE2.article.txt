## Facebook to translate by early 2008 Social networking site will expand to overseas markets 
### DEVIN BANERJEE 
With more than 45 million active mem
bers. social networking giant Facebook.com
does not appear to be in need of new users.
I lowever, the Web site will soon be gathering
even more members with its foreign language
translation, part of what developers call "an
ambitious overseas expansion."
Facebook recently reached sixth place on
the U.S. list of most trafficked Web sites â€”
and third place on the global list.The current
translation project could potentially bring
the company its largest increase in users
since its inception three and a half years ago.
"International growth is one of a few
things that we are very focused on right
now," Facebook told the Financial Times in a
recent article.
The Palo Alto-based company has im
posed stringent security around its project to
go global.
"While Facebook is committed to the in
ternationalization of the site by late 2007 [or]
early 2(X)8, we have no further plans to share
on this topic at this time," a Facebook
spokesperson wrote in an email to The Daily.
Adding to the atmosphere of secrecy
around Facebook's current project are ru
mors. according to technology news Web site
CNET.com, that the company has quietly
plastered fliers around campus searching for
students to help with translation efforts.
However, most language students and pro
fessors are still in the dark.
"I have not heard anything about this
project," said Elizabeth Bernhardt, director
of the Stanford Language Center.
Although the role Stanford students
would play remains unknown. Bernhardt,
who is also a professor of German Studies, was
surprised that Facebook would consider Stan
ford students for a project of such magnitude.
"There is a professional society that does
this," she said. "Ethically,to receive money for
translation is a very serious profession."
According to Compete.com. which col
lects data on Web site traffic, Facebook
trails social networking rival MySpace.com
in unique visitors, total page views, average
stay and attention. However, Facebook s
growth in unique visitors from July to Au
gust of this year was 10 percent, while My-
Space's growth was only one percent.
Furthermore, over those two months My-
Space declined in average stay and attention
rates, including a negative 20 percent growth
in total page views, while Facebook's num
bers were up.
MySpace has already introduced non-
English sites, including local features in many
foreign markets, but Facebook leads in users
in both Canada and the United Kingdom,
where it will soon open an office, accord ing to
the Financial Times.
In addition to new English-speaking of
fices, Facebook. Inc. is forging ahead with
translation efforts. At a conference in New
York last month. Mike Murphy, vice-presi
dent of media sales, said the company's
largest current challenge is "global expansion
and being able to handle it."
