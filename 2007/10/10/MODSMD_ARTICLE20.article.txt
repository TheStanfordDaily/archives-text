## Obama pushes Dream Act 
### STEVE LAWRENCE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO (AP) Democratic presi
dential candidate Barack Obama on Tues
day urged Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to
sign the so-called Dream Act, a bill that
would make illegal immigrant students who
graduate from California high schools eligi
ble for college aid.
Schwarzenegger vetoed similar legisla
tion last year.
"If Governor Schwarzenegger vetoes
the Dream Act a second time, he will com
pound the immigration crisis by driving
thousands of children who are on the right
path into the shadows," Obama said in a
statement.
"We teach our children that in America
you will thrive if you work hard and dream
big. Governor Schwarzenegger now has the
chance to demonstrate that instead of blam
ing one group for the challenges America
faces, he can unite Californians and give
children who play by the rules the opportu
nity to succeed."
Approved by the Legislature last month,
the bill applies to financially needy illegal
immigrant students. It would make them el
igible for state grants or community college
fee waivers if they graduate from a Califor
nia high school after attending it for at least

three years. They would be eligible only if
they are accepted at a California college or
university.
The measure, by Sen. Gil Cedillo. D-Los
Angeles, also would give a break to U.S. cit
izens who graduate from a California high
school but then move out of state. It would
make them eligible for the same aid pro
grams if they wanted to return to California
for college.
Schwarzenegger press secretary Aaron
McLear said the governor had not taken a
position on the Cedillo bill but was "thor
oughly reviewing it."
California already allows illegal immi
grant students to pay the same public col
lege or university fees as state residents
who are U.S. citizens, rather than the much
higher fees students coming from out of
state face. But that only applies if the immi
grant graduated from a California high
school after attending it for at least three
years.The students also must apply for legal
status.
Obama co-sponsored similar legislation
when he was a state senator in Illinois.
Students supporting the Cedillo bill for
college aid said they would deliver petitions
on Wednesday with thousands of signatures
urging Schwarzenegger to sign the measure.
The governor has until Sunday to sign or
veto hundreds of bills on his desk.
