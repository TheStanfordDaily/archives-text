LANSING, Mich. (AP) Five Demo
cratic candidates have withdrawn
from Michigan's Jan. 15 presidential
primary, leaving what amounts to a
beauty contest for front-runner
Hillary Rodham Clinton and a
handful of lesser-knowns.
Barack Obama, John Edwards
and Bill Richardson filed paperwork
'Hiesday, the deadline to withdraw
from the ballot, said Kelly Chesney,
spokeswoman for the Michigan Sec

retary of State's office. Two other
candidates, Joe Biden and Dennis
Kucinich, said in statements that they
also were bypassing the primary.
Although Michigan is a critical
Midwest state in presidential voting,
it violated Democratic National
Committee rules by moving its pri
mary earlier in the process. The can
didates are honoring the DNC's
wishes in skipping the contest.
Clinton broke with the leading
candidates, with her campaign issu
ing a statement saying the New York
senator will remain on the ballot.

Chris Dodd also plans to stay on the
ballot.
"We're honoring the pledge and
we won't campaign or spend money
in states that aren't in compliance
with the DNC calendar," said Clin
ton spokesman Jay Carson. "We
don't think it's necessary to remove
ourselves from the ballot."
All the Democratic candidates
already have agreed not to cam
paign in Michigan because it broke
DNC rules when it moved its pri
mary ahead of Feb. 5. Party rules say
states cannot hold their 2008 pri-

Mary contests before Feb. 5, except
for lowa on Jan. 14, Nevada on Jan.
19, New Hampshire on Jan. 22 and
South Carolina on Jan. 29.
The calendar was designed to
preserve the traditional role that
lowa and New Hampshire have
played in selecting the nominee,
while adding two states with more
racial and geographic diversity to in
fluential early slots.
"This is an extension of the
pledge we made, based on the rules
that the DNC laid out," said Obama
spokesman Bill Burton. "We still

hope that Michigan Democrats can
adopt a process that meets DNC
rules and, if so, look forward to fight
ing for the votes of men and women
across the state."
Edwards' campaign said the can
didate is strongly committed to
lowa.
"In lowa, New Hampshire, South
Carolina and Nevada voters can
look their candidate in the eye and
determine who is best to bring about
real change in America," said Ed
wards' campaign manager, former
Michigan Rep. David Bonior.
