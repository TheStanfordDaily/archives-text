ended Clayton's seven-match win streak,
six of which came in the tournament. Clay
ton was only one of three qualifiers to
make it to the quarterfinals of the main
draw.
"This was a very good tournament for
[Alex]," said head coach John Whitlinger.
"His first goal was to qualify [for the main
draw), which was not easy to do. After he
got in the main draw, he kept playing hard,
and his results showed it."
After ending Clayton's run. Helgeson
went on to upset the top-seeded player in
the semifinals, en route to winning the
tournament.
"[Clayton] had some pretty hard
matches, hut he competed hard, fought
well and, when things got tough, he rose up
to the occasion." Whitlinger said. "It was
unfortunate he ran into the eventual win
ner — a senior with a lot of experience. A
great start for a new kid on the block."
Clayton is now 7-1 on the season, one of
the best starts in history for Cardinal
freshmen. With his quarterfinal appear
ance at the ITA tournament. Clayton will
likely vault into the top-2o in the national
rankings.

and 1 am glad to have made a good start,"
Clayton said. "It was a tough match
against Helgeson. He played well, and 1
was getting tired from all the matches [ear
lier in the week]."
