# Golf looks to move up in final round of play

### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
After two rounds of play at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational, the No. 15 Stanford women's golf team
sits in sixth place and is 19 total shots behind the
leader. No. 4 Southern California. The tournament,
held at the Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish,
Washington, began on Monday and concludes today.
The Cardinal won the tournament last year after
a strong second round propelled them to first place,
a spot they did not relinquish. But similar success was
not found this year, as the team fell from a first-round
third place standing to its current sixth position. Now,
in order to defend its title, the Cardinal will have to
pass not only USC in today's final round, but Pac-10
schools No. 3 Ari-

zona State and
No. 7 Arizona,
amongst others.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is in sixth
place with a 30-over-par total of 606
(304-302) as it heads into the third
and final round of play this afternoon.
Junior Mari Chun is currently in eighth
place overall after scoring 71 -76 for a
3-over-par 147. Sophomore Catheri
ne Wang is tied for 24th after rounds
of 77-75 for an 8-over-par 152.

In order to move up to second, the Cardinal must
improve its short game — the team missed a number
of putts from under three feet. Such mistakes are un
acceptable on the Sahalee course, which O'Connor
described as "visually intimidating." The links are
narrow and lined with evergreens, making hits off the
tee especially difficult.
"You can hit good shots, but not be rewarded,"
O'Connor said.
The Cardinal actually performed better yesterday
than on Monday, shooting a combined 302, as op
posed to 304 in the first round. O'Connor attributed
this improvement to "better course management."
However, Stanford was still out-shot in the second
round by ten of the 16 teams in the tournament.
Stanford's top golfer, junior Mari Chun, is at +3
for the tournament after shooting a 4-over 76 yester
day. Chun, who had the best personal score (-1) last
