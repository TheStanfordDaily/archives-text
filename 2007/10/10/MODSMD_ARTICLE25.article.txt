# Tennis comes up short in first tournament
## Top-20 ranked players must settle for consolation round 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team was simply overwhelmed in its
first tournament of the 2007-2008
campaign. By the end of the Riv
iera/Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion (ITA) All-American Champi
onships this weekend, the Cardinal
women had won only three matches,
while dropping seven.
Stanford entered the Champi
onships with three players ranked in
the ITA preseason top-20 — senior
Celia Purkin at 9th, junior Jessica
Nguyen at 15th and sophomore
Lindsay Burdette at 16th.
Unfortunately, the big three suf
fered first-round losses in the singles
main draw, two of the them coming
to players from the qualifying brack
et.
Durkin dropped a 6-4. 5-4 (ret.)
decision to Maya Johansson of Geor
gia Tech, who is unranked in singles,
while Nguyen was upset 6-4, 6-3 by
Arkansas's Aurelija Miscviciute,
ranked 119 th.
Rounding off the first round
sweep was Burdette's 6-4,6-4 loss to
Zuzana Zemenova of Baylor.
Even worse, Stanford lost its
leader, Durkin. to a sprained ankle in
the first round.
According to coach Lele Forood,
the injury is "not serious" and
Durkin is expected to be "alright" for
the upcoming season.
"We had some pretty tough first
round matches," Forood said "But
after we got through those, we came
back and played pretty well."
Indeed, the Cardinal showed
signs of life in the consolation brack
et, recording its first match wins of
the season.
Burdette made the quarterfinals
of the draw with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 win
over Fani Chifchieva of Auburn, but
later fell 6-4, 6-0 to Northwestern's
Georgia Rose, who was ranked Bth
in the preseason polls.
On the opposite end of the brack
et, Nguyen battled to the semifinals
with a 6-3,6-4 win over Sarah Fansler
of Southern California and a 3-6,6-0,
6-3 victory over Sanaz Marand of
North Carolina.
However, Nguyen eventually lost
6-2,6-3 to top-ranked LSU's Megan
Falcon.
This weekend continued Stan
ford's misfortune at the Champi
onships. The Cardinal most recently
won the singles title in 1990, and the
last doubles title in 2000. In fact, the
last Stanford woman to make the fi
nals of the main draw was Erin Bur
dette '05, Lindsay's older sister.
Despite another sub-par showing
at the Championships, Forood
knows that her squad needs "prac
tice and match play right now" to
bounce back.
With Stanford starting school
more than a month later than most
schools in the tournament, the Card
was at a disadvantage from the start.

"We're just behind the other
schools that have been in school and
have been practicing longer than we
have been," Forood said. "But, we'll
be up to speed in a couple of weeks."
Coming into the season, there
were many lingering questions
about the Stanford roster. Over the
last two years, Stanford has lost four
top-ranking players, most recently
Teresa Logar '07 and Anne Yelsey
'07.
Though this weekend may not
have answered any of these ques
tions, Forood believes that there isn't
yet a sense of urgency among her
players.
"It's not that kind of tourna
ment," Forood said. "We're just try
ing to have good performances and
to get some match play, but there is
no panic or anything this early in the
season."
In fact, the Card knows what it
must do to return to form.This week
end, Nguyen, Burdette and fresh
man Carolyn McVeigh will compete
in a tournament at St. Mary's, hoping
to get up to speed in their match play.
Next weekend, Stanford will host
the ITA Northwest Regional Cham
pionships, a tournament that plays in
the Card's favor.
"It's a big tournament with many
teams participating," Forood said.

GAME NOTES: Stanford's three top-20 ranked
singles players, junior Jessica Nguyen, senior

the main draw. Nguyen went on to post victo
ries in the first two rounds of the consolation
draw, but lost 6-2,6-3 in the semifinals to
eventual champion Megan Falcon of LSU.

"It's a huge draw so it's a nice chance
to get a lot of matches in for every
body on our team."
Though it isn't a time to panic, it is
in fact time for the Card to put this
setback in the past and catch up with
the rest of the pack.
