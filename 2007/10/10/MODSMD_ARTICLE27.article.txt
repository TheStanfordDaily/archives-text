defense, which didn't allow a single
shot by the Beavers, compared to
Stanford's eight.
In the second half, the Stanford de
fense remained unyielding, limiting
Oregon State to six shots and forcing
senior goalie Andrew Kartunen to
make only one save in notching his
fourth shutout of the season. In the
71st minute, Hency scored his first
goal of the season, nailing the lower
left corner off a pass from freshman
Ryan Thomas.
In the next five minutes, two other
scoring newcomers registered goals to
give the Cardinal what would be the
last two points in a 4-0 victory. Fresh
man Daniel Leon followed Hency by

just two minutes, finding the low cor
ner with junior T.J. Novak's pass. At
74:47, redshirt sophomore Alex
Kozachenko guided a shot deflection
hack into the left side of the net.
While Stanford's shared offensive
presence carried over into the meet
ing with the Huskies, with seven dif
ferent Cardinal players registering
each of the team's attempts, the suc
cess rate dropped, leaving Stanford
with a 0-0 draw.
Coach Bret Simon, though, was
pleased with the performance on both
ends of the field.
"We [created] offensive opportu
nities by committee, with different
players contributing each game,"
Simon said."But consistency in defen
sive effort is something that needs to
be a constant for any team to be suc
cessful over time. So, that's a great
building block."
In the first half of the defense

dominated game, Washington took
seven shots to the Cardinal's one.
However, after the halt the teams re
versed roles, as Stanford notched six
shots to the Huskies' one. Despite op
portunities for both teams, including a
67th-minute attempt by Cardinal
sophomore Michael Strickland that
was called back with an offsides deci
sion, neither team could score.
The game went to overtime, where
both teams remained scoreless and
only Washington got a shot off.
Simon, though, found an upside to
Sunday's tie.
"The fact that we were unscored
upon in the two games is very impor
tant," he said.
The Cardinal hit the road this
weekend, meeting UCLA on Friday
and San Diego State on Sunday.
