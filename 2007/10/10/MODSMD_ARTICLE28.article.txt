# Water polo in the hunt for an NCAA title this season
## 
### KENAN JIANG 
The Stanford men's water polo team
has started off the season with a solid 5-
3 record and a No. 3 national ranking.
Led by head coach John Vargas, the
team is often in the nation's top five; the
Cardinal has made appearances at
every NCAA Championship Tourna
ment since 2002.The team is no stranger
to success, with its last national title won
five years ago.The Cardinal has a cumu
lative record of 89-22 over the four
years under Vargas.
"Our team definitely has the ability
to make the NCAAs," said senior goal
keeper Sandy Hohener. "First we need
to win our winter conference games. I
know we lost to USC last time, but I
think the score does not reflect our ca
pabilities. There's no doubt in my mind
that they are beatable."
With No. 1 USC, No. 2 Cal and No. 4
UCLA all winning national champi
onships in recent years, Stanford is press
ing to capture a title. Much of the empha
sis is on teamwork and the masterful job
of managing players by coach Vargas.
"Every player has a specific role, and
we just need to go out there and exe
cute," said two-meter defender senior
Peter Finlayson. "We can't afford to
make small, dumb mistakes, especially
against a team like USC."
Stanford may not be short on talent,
but other teams have a size advantage in
the pool, and winning must come
through trumping the other team's raw
strength with offensive tactics, defen
sive coordination and pre-game scout
ing.
Teamwork is the highest ideal for the
players, and everyone puts aside his per
sonal agenda for the benefit of the
team.
"We definitely are smaller than
other teams, but that goes back to play
ing smart," Hohener said. "So we have
to cut out as many mistakes as possible
and execute as a team. Coach does a
great job scouting other teams — to at
tack what they're going to do to give
ourselves a chance to win.
"It is up to us to play within ourselves
and not do anything outside our game
plan," he added. "We're not going to be
able to go one-on-one against guys that

are bigger than us, so we have to attack
and set as a team. What some may lack
in size, there are ways to help out in the
defensive and offensive schemes to
overcome that."
A source of pride for the men's water
polo team is their defense, where sen
iors Ryan Fortune and Forrest Schwartz
man the line, making the job a bit easier
for Hohener.
Fortune and Schwartz play the two
meter defense with Finlayson, making it
particularly hard for the opposing of
fense to gain position. In a game where
mobility is rather limited compared to
land sports,gaining position often trans
lates to goals and determines the differ
ence between victory and defeat.
"He [Ryan] may not show up in the
stat line because he doesn't score that
many goals, but [he] deserves a lot of
credit along with Forrest Schwartz,"
Hohener said. "Together, they do a real
good job stopping the ball before 1 have
to block."
Despite the team's relative youth
with eight freshmen and four sopho
mores, Stanford's talent level remains
high compared to squads in recent
memory.
Sophomores Sage Wright, Drac
Wigo, Janson Wigo and Ryan McCarthy
have gotten valuable experience play
ing as freshmen and have consistently
improved their skill level through the
team's grueling practices.
"We've been working a lot on funda
mentals," Wigo said. "Basically break
ing parts of the game down during prac
tice and watching tapes to see which
parts of the game we can improve on."
The Cardinal also has a strict regi
men out of the pool.
"We've been working a lot on our
conditioning this year, and that will pay
dividends, especially later in [the] sea
son when other teams may break down
from fatigue," Hohener explained.
With a team-first attitude and strong
work ethic, the Stanford men's water
polo team seems to be headed toward
NCAA glory. It will move one step fur
ther with its next game against Prince
ton at UC-Irvine on Saturday.
