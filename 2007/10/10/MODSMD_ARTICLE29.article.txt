### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
l"he Stanford women's swimming and diving team (1 -
0) began the season with a splash last Friday at the Avery
Aquatic Center. The Cardinal was able to easily slide
past the San Jose State Spartans, (0-1) 164-105, in the
non-conference competition.
The big scorers of the day were junior Caroline
Bruce and sophomore Julia Smit,each claiming two in
dividual events a piece. Junior and Olympian Bruce
touched a full three seconds ahead of the field in the
100-meter breaststroke before going on to win the 200
backstroke, one of five events in which the Card swept
the top three spots. Smit, a backstroke and individual
medley specialist, dominated the field in the 200 breast
stroke and the 1000 freestyle, which she won by an im
pressive 25 seconds.
Stanford finished the meet with first-place finishes in
12 of the 16 events. San Jose State standout Brie
Marhenke managed to pull off victories in the 50 and 100
freestyles over the Cardinal. The Spartans were also
credited with the win in the 200 individual medley and
the 4x200 free relay, events that Stanford swam as exhi
bition. 1 lowever, it was Stanford freshmen Liz Smith and
the Stanford B-relay team who recorded the top times in
those events, respectively.
Hie divers also put on a strong showing, with fresh
men Meg Hostage winning the 1 -meter event and Cardi
nal divers sophomore Carmen Stellar, sophomore
Shana Karp and junior Sarah Ohr sweeping the 3-meter
competition.
With freshmen Smith and Hostage finishing ahead of
the rest of the field in their first-ever collegiate competi
tion, the future for the Cardinal looks bright. In fact, all
five freshmen had scoring swims on Friday. According to
sophomore Caitlin Reynolds, the Card's newest mem
bers brought a special enthusiasm to the team.
"Our freshmen were so excited to be there," said
Reynolds. "It's pretty amazing to represent Stanford for

the first time,especially at a home meet. They did a great
job."
Other event winners of the day were seniors Eliza
beth Durot in the 500 freestyle, Brooke Bishop in the 100
backstroke, sophomores Stelanie Sutton in the 200
freestyle, Kelley Hug in the 200 butterfly and Nilasha
Ghosh in the 100 butterfly. The Stanford 4x200 medley
relay A-teani of junior Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy,
Bruce, Hug, and Smit also finished first.
According to Reynolds, the team was optimistic and
happy after its first test of the year.
"1 think it went pretty well," said Reynolds. "We got
to see where our training was at. We've been working re
ally hard in our preseason training, and it was fun to try
out different events we don't normally get to swim."
Coming off an undefeated dual meet season of 10-0
last year, the Cardinal extended its winning streak to
eleven. ITie Card will try to make it twelve in their next
dual meet against the Washington Huskies, the first con
ference meet of the season, on Saturday, Nov. 3.The meet
will be held at the Avery Aquatic 'Center.
But first, the Stanford women will compete against
some of their own, in the just-for-fun Alumni Meet this
Saturday Ihe current Stanford swimmers will have to
put up a fight when they compete against former NCAA
Champions and Olympians. Alumni to watch out for in
clude Olympian siblings, Tara '04 and Dana Kirk '06, as
well as head swim coach and Olympic gold-medalist Lea
Maurer.
"We have very talented alumni "said Reynolds."lt's
nice to think you're on a team with people who have rep
resented both Stanford and the IJS in international
meets like the Olympics."
Ihe meet should inspire the team to live up to its lega
cy this season, for Stanford is traditionally considered
one of the most dominant swim teams in history. Based
on their early-season performances, it looks like they're
right on track to do just that.
