### JULIE KLEIN MANAGING EDITOR 
Two suspects have already been appre
hended and charged with battery for crimes
that took place at ITieta Delta Chi early Sat
urday morning. At least 10 non-students are
suspected of punching students and stealing
their wallets as a party at the fraternity house
came to a close over the weekend. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman

said in an email sent to all Stanford students
last night. The Department of Public Safety
is conducting the ongoing investigation.
"Although crimes that involve any level
of violence are rare on our campus, Satur
day's incident reminds us that we are not im
mune from criminal activity that jeopardizes
the safety of members of our community."
Boardman said in the email, reminding stu
dents to be alert and to callll if they do see
suspicious activity on campus.

While specific details of the case are still
unknown. Student Affairs staff members
plan to work with residence deans to prevent
similar situations from happening in the fu
ture.
"1 think that as we know more about what
occurred, we will talk about what we may
need to be doing," Associate Vice Provost
Chris Griffith said to'lTie Daily. "We will im
plement new measures, but we don?t know
everything yet."

Griffith added that her office did not gain
a comprehensive picture of the case until
Monday.
"It took that long to be able to determine
what happened," she said.
In his email. Boardman said that Student
Affairs staff members are working directly
with students in Theta Delta Chi and are re
viewing party-planning guidelines to ensure
security at future campus parties.
The staff will focus on both indi
viduals and student groups to help
all students become more alert as
they plan events.
"We need to be aware of our sur
roundings." Griffith said, adding that
the focus will be on all student
planned functions.
While Student Affairs concen
trates on precautionary measures
for the future, the Department of
Public Safety is working to solve the

case at hand.
"It is possible that there are stu
dents who were assaulted or whose
wallets were stolen during this inci
dent hut who have not yet come to
the attention of police or the Univer
sity," Boardman said in the email.
Victims are asked to contact the
police at (650) 723-9633 or to notify
any residence dean. Students can
also learn about possible criminal
activity on campus by visiting the
"Crime Watch" section of the De
