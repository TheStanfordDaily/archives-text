## West Flo RAs set example for frosh Staff wearing helmets while biking, urging freshmen to bike more safety 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
"Hey, a helmet! Now that's boss!"
This is the rallying cry of West FloMo Resident Assistants
(RAs), who are committed to drastically changing student atti
tudes toward bike helmets, especially among freshmen. As part of
the crusade, this year's RAs always wear their helmets when they
bike, both on-campus and off.
So far only West FloMo RAs have committed to wearing bike
helmets.
"Right now, the norm is to not wear a helmet, but we want to
change that," said Max Thompson '08 in an email to Hie Daily.
Thompson, an RA in Loro, has worn his helmet with pride since
freshman year.
"The idea of our program is to counteract what we felt was a
negative stigma surrounding helmets on campus," he said.

All Resident Assistants living in West Flo this year have pledged to always wear helmets while biking. The staff hopes to
inspire freshmen and the campus at large to use helmets and practice other safe biking strategies.
Part of that negative image,
Thompson said, can come from RAs
themselves.
"If you ever hear an RA or anoth
er upperclassman say in front of
freshmen,' Look at that sketchy grad
student with the helmet," that guar
antees that the helmet that the frosh
brought from home will stay under
the bed in the box and never come
out,"Thompson said.
West FloMo RAs have already
accomplished their goal among
some students.
"It helps especially with fresh
men to know others wear helmets,so
it's not an uncool thing to do," said
Loro resident Tiffany Shih '11. "And
we know our RAs are cool."
The message of the FloMo RAs,
"being safe is synonymous with
being cool," is the same message stu
dents receive from Vaden's Sexual
Health and Peer Resource Center or
any campus Peer Health Educator,
Thompson said.
Helmets can protect bikers from
serious head injuries, a fact that lead
ers of the effort are trying to empha
size.
"It would be great if students
would wear helmets so that we never
have to face a head injury tragedy
amongst our undergraduate popula
tion," said Carolyn Helmke, bicycle
coordinator for Parking and Trans
portation Services (P&TS), in an
email to The Daily.
Thompson said he believes that
the student body as a whole does not
take bike safety very seriously He
listed biking on the wrong side of the

road, not using turn signals and bik
ing through campus at unsafe speeds
as dangerous actions often seen on
campus.
"I think if anyone actually saw
what a serious head injury looked
like," he said, "they would wear a
helmet for the rest of their lives."
In addition to the RAs' efforts to
promote bike helmets, P&TS spon
sors other programs to encourage
helmet use, including giving $10
Stanford Dining gift cards to stu
dents spotted wearing helmets on
campus. Also, the Campus Bike
Shop sells high quality helmets at a
low cost to the campus community.
Those at the center of the effort
insist that they have already seen
positive results since the start of the
campaign.
"1 believe more people are start
ing to recognize that wearing a bike
helmet is a smart thing to do,"
Helmke said, "and Stanford has lots
of smart students, so the culture at
Stanford should work in our favor.
We have already seen more under
graduates wearing bike helmets this
quarter, many of them from Flo Mo."
However, Thompson conceded
that it may be difficult for the RAs'
efforts to have a campus-wide effect.
"We know that [it] is going to be
tough to change an entire campus
culture," he said. "In 10 years, it
would be great to see students who
speak out to their friends who don't
wear helmets.
"That is probably unrealistic, but
it doesn't mean we can't try,"
Thompson added. "The more people
who wear helmets, the easier it will
be for other people to wear them
without feeling self-conscious."
