## West Flo RAs set example for frosh Staff wearing helmets while biking, urging freshmen to bike more safety 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
"Hey, a helmet! Now that's boss!"
This is the rallying cry of West FloMo Resident Assistants
(RAs), who are committed to drastically changing student atti
tudes toward bike helmets, especially among freshmen. As part of
the crusade, this year's RAs always wear their helmets when they
bike, both on-campus and off.
So far only West FloMo RAs have committed to wearing bike
helmets.
"Right now, the norm is to not wear a helmet, but we want to
change that," said Max Thompson '08 in an email to Hie Daily.
Thompson, an RA in Loro, has worn his helmet with pride since
freshman year.
"The idea of our program is to counteract what we felt was a
negative stigma surrounding helmets on campus," he said.

All Resident Assistants living in West Flo this year have pledged to always wear helmets while biking. The staff hopes to
inspire freshmen and the campus at large to use helmets and practice other safe biking strategies.
