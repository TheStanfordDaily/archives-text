## Fertilization technique for older women In vitro method reduces risk of dangerous multiple births 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Some infertile women over the age of 35 may he
ahle to reduce their risk of multiple births through an
established in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique
known as single blastocyst transfers recent School of
Medicine study found.
Medical School Prof. Aniin Milki, one of the au
thors of the study, summarized the problem doctors
face in treating older women using IVF.
"You want them to get pregnant," he said. "And
yet you don't want them to get too pregnant."
If doctors transfer too few embryos, none may sur
vive, and an expensive cycle of IVF is wasted. But if
the doctor transfers too many, the woman may find
herself navigating a dangerous pregnancy with more
babies than she bargained for.
The Stanford study found that transferring a single
blastocyst, or five-day-old embryo, is the best choice
for some women over 35.The research was published
in the most recent online edition of the medical jour
nal Fertility and Sterility.
"It's a pretty tricky group to treat," Milki said, re
ferring to his group's decision to study IVF in women
over age 35. an age group that includes nearly 60 per-
cent of the patients seeking the pro
cedure. For the study, his patients
had an average age of 37, and the
oldest was 43.
Women in their late 30s present a
quandary to doctors because they
are not yet sure how many embryos
should be transferred. For patients
on either side of this gray area, the
choice is often more straightfor
ward.
Women under age 35 generally
receive a single embryo.
"There's such a good pregnancy
rate that one may be all you need,"
Milki said.
For women over age 40, doctors

transfer several embryos because
the embryos tend to be lower quali
ty. and the chance of multiple preg
nancies is low.
Milki's study focused on women
between those two defined zones.
He and his colleagues took data col
lected at Stanford Medical Center
since 1998 and examined the 45
women over 35 who chose to trans
fer just one five-day-old embryo.The
women had encouraging results: 62
percent conceived, and 51 percent
carried their pregnancies beyond the
first trimester.
However, Milki warned that
these women are not typical.
"We're talking about the sub
group of women that, despite age,
still have really good-looking ovaries
and a really good number of eggs."
Women with such high-quality
embryos make up less than half of all

IVF patients, but they are an impor
tant group to study. Transferring
more than one of those hearty em
bryos puts the women at risk for
multiple pregnancies, which are
medically undesirable.
Triplets and quadruplets, if they
survive at all, are likely to have a host
of medical problems, and twins are
not risk-free either. Milki explained
that, compared to singletons, twins
have a seven-fold rate of premature
birth, an increased risk for cerebral
palsy and a heightened chance of low
birth weight and infant mortality.
Doctors would like to transfer a
single embryo if they can, and the
Stanford research shows this may be
possible more often than previously
thought.
