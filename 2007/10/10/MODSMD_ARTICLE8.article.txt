October 10,1944: Search
for Queens Begins

In a university flush with feminin
ity and pulchritude, the Stanford
Quad today fired its opening gun in a
year-long search for campus queens
who will ultimately occupy several
full pages in the yearbook.
The announcement of the pro
posed plan was made jointly by
Quad Business Manager Nancy
Gilmer and Editor Hayes Hunter.
Said Hunter:
"In a university the size of Stan
ford it is always desirable to pick
leading feminine personalities and
feature them in such a section as the
Queen section of the Quad. It will be
something to remember in years to
come, not only for the girls who will
finally appear in the section, but for
their friends as well.
Miss Gilmer added:
"Not only will Stanford feminine
beauty be represented, but also pro
posed plans call for full color repro
duction of some of the scenic beauty
of Stanford.
"The Quad stands on the thresh
old of a new era and necessarily must
incorporate new ideas to cope with
coming events."
Hunter further stated that the
Queens will be chosen by a five-man
committee composed of the editors
of the three campus publications,
plus A.S.S.U. President Barbara
White and a floating vote.
Several contests will be spon
sored during autumn and winter
quarters, with Hans Roth, local stu
dio photographer, taking the contest
photographs.
