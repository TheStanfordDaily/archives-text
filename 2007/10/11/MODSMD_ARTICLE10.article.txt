## New MCAT gets mixed reviews Medical school entrance test went online earlier this year 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
For thousands of college students
across the nation with eyes set on
medical school, the Medical College
Admission Test (MCAT) is an in
evitable obstacle. But since January,
test takers have faced the additional
challenge of taking the test on a com
puter.
Stanford students gave mixed re
views to the computer version of the
eighty-year-old test, which they must
take at select locations hosted by
Thompson Prometrics, a global
provider of comprehensive testing
and assessment services.
Cathy Sun '08 took the new test
on Sept. 7 in San Jose. She said that
the first time the test was offered,
there was a glitch in the test — one of
the verbal passages was followed by
questions that didn't match up with
the passage.
"Fortunately, nothing like that
happened during my test." she said.
Students also complained that not
being able to jot notes on the com
puterized test could impede per
formance. But Michael Lin '08, who
took the test this summer in San Jose,
said that the new test simply required
mental adjustment.
"For those who learned how to do
it, it was really not [very) different,"
Lin said. "You can highlight and un
derline just like in a paper-based
test."
Sun and Lin agreed that the
biggest benefit of the new exam was
being able to type the essays instead
of handwriting them.
"It was nice not having to worry
about your handwriting, finishing up
your sentences on time or getting

hand cramps," said Jeff Ma '08, who
also took the test this summer.
The new test has seen a dramatic
reduction in the number of students
testing on a particular day. Ma said
that the MCAT used to be offered
only twice a year, causing the testing
locations to be filled with hundreds
of people — a distraction for many
test takers.
"In the computer format, you're
in a room with 20 to 25 people, and it
seems like a much more controlled
environment," he said. "And now, the
tests are offered 22 times a year."
Lin agreed that the new comput
erized version of the MCA T was less
stressful.
"The experience was self
paced." he said. "There was no time
wasted on administration, so you're
either taking your break or taking
your test. On the original test, a cou
ple of hours would be spent on test
administration, but now, the com
puter has streamlined the whole
process and you get the score back
a lot faster."
In addition, Lin said that there
were really no visual distractions
since everyone got their own cubicle,
and that the security also improved.
"There was a camera over every
four stations with people monitor
ing, so it's really, really hard to
cheat," he said, "which is reassuring
for people who don't cheat."
With all the new benefits, some
may wonder if it is fair to the test tak
ers of yore who did not have a chance
to alleviate the stress of the test by
aid of technology. But Lin does not
believe there are any real advantages
to the new exam over the old paper
version.
"In the end you score what you
score," he said, "and that's just based
on how much vou know."
