## Editorial Board Full Moon delay worth the wait 
### 
Most years, the night of the first full
moon of the academic year is ac
companied by raucous, drunken
revelry in the Main Quad under the watch
ful facade of Memorial Church, complete
with musical performances, sketchy impos
tors from Paly and Gunn and those free l.is
terine capsules handed out in an attempt to
at least slow the rapid spread of disease. It's
all part of a century-old tradition known as
Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ).
This year, however, the first full moon of
the quarter fell on Sept. 26. the third day of
classes, and received no such fanfare. Ad
ministrators decided in early September to
postpone the event until the quarter's sec
ond full moon,on Oct. 25. While ASSU offi
cials lobbied for the earlier date, they were
ultimately told by University officials that
they had to postpone the annual event until
late October. Despite miscommunication
about the news of the change which left
many upperclassmen confused, the post
ponement was ultimately a good move in
light of the early timing.
A delay of this sort is not unprecedented.
In 2004, when the current seniors were
themselves freshmen, FMO TQ was similar
ly postponed from late September until late
October.
And following the 2003 event, the fa
mous tradition was in danger of collapsing
altogether — four hospitalizations and two
arrests in the hours after the event caused
Nanci I lowe, student affairs officer in the
Office of Student Activities, to wonder
aloud if the event would return at all.
There are bigger things to worry about
than a month's postponement, or even the
aborted plan to hold "Full" Moon near the
half moon, on Friday, Oct. 6. That schedule
was scrapped because the Hand wouldn't
have been able to attend that weekend (they
had to be in Los Angeles for some football
game).
So while upperclassmen — and a few as

tute freshmen — who had been anticipating
the early date may have been disgruntled by
the change, it is worth noting that the deci
sion was made with freshmen in mind.
ASSU Vice President Mondaire Jones '09
said that one reason University officials
wanted to postpone the event was that
freshmen might not know their Resident
Assistants well enough "to feel comfortable
talking to them honestly about alcohol con
sumption."
Iliis makes sense in light of the fact that
FMOTQ combines major risk factors, in
cluding binge drinking and early exposure
to alcohol. A study by the American Coun
cil of Education found that freshmen ac
counted for more than a third of alcohol-re
lated deaths between 2(XX) and 2006. a dis
proportionately high figure. And other stud
ies have concluded that freshman year is an
especially vulnerable time for binge drink
ing.
Early exposure to alcohol can also be a
problem: the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National
Institutes of I lealth. reports that the first six
weeks of the school year, especially for
freshmen, are a critical and dangerous time.
While the decision to postpone FMOTQ
was a sound one.getting the word out about
the rescheduling was not well thought out.
RAs were informed of the late date before
New Student Orientation, but persistent ru
mors that the event would be in September
or on the half moon left many students con
fused. Searches on www.stanford.edu and
assu.stanford.edu also yielded no results for
curious students trying to learn the date.
So we will merely have to wait two more
weeks for the annual freshman rite of pas
sage that dates back to the 1910s. It will give
upperclassmen two more weeks of eager an
ticipation and freshmen two more weeks to
settle into their new environment. And we
can only hope the postponement will lead to
a safer atmosphere for all.
