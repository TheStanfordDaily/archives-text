## Rock Asia 
### 
UT m just ... nervous about this. I've
I never been to a less-developed
JLcountry like Thailand," I told my
friend Marc. "Ziv, I want you to go in there
and ROCK ASIA!" he replied. Trying to
keep those words close to heart, I boarded
my plane for Bangkok last summer, travel
ing alone, with no plan in place and no place
to stay. But when 1 finally got to my destina
tion. I went into shock: smog, humidity, pros
titutes, shirtless Europeans, crusty-eyed
baby elephants and shady-looking food
carts pushed up next to reeking piles of
trash. I didn't want to rock a damn thing; I
just hoped to survive.
Unexpectedly, I flourished in this land of
elephants and red chili peppers, and so I
would like to propose Thailand as your next
travel destination.The landscape is lush, the
humid climate is good for your skin and the
growth rates are always in the double digits.
Getting around is easy: I managed to tra
verse half of Thailand with $12. one word
(my destination) and a Lonely Planet guide.
And. as is the case with developing coun
tries, one of the best draws of Thailand is
value: clean rooms for $6 per night, meals
for $2 and massages for ... well, let's not go
there.
I saw some of the most beautiful — and
some of the dirtiest — scenes in Thailand.
Fhe place I first came to. the backpackers'
district known as Khao San Road, fits into
the dirtier category. Although I cannot rec
ommend spending too much time there,one
can get used to it pretty fast, and even come
to enjoy it. For the more adventurous,
there's always the sex district in Bangkok,
where you can watch women shoot darts out
of their vaginas and hit distant balloons with
amazing accuracy. Can you see that at
Tresidder?
However, there is one place where dirti
ness takes a turn for the worse. I urge every
one to avoid the entire island of Phuket, es
pecially the Patong area. Do not be fooled
by the tourist pamphlets: there are much
nicer islands around. I will admit that my
most entertaining stories came from being
on that island, but it truly is tourism gone
wrong. It feels like being in a town infested
by vampires: eerie, but normal-looking dur
ing the day.and utter hell by night. Here's
the scene: many squat, square structures
squished together amidst garish neon lights,
blaring music, with hookers and sex tourists
everywhere .Those hookers were indeed at

tractive, hut repulsive at the same time, as if
one was on a nasty hallucinogen and sud
denly these women morphed into screaming
demons. All I wanted to do was hide out in
my room, but even that was tough to do. as
there were many massage parlors impeding
my path to it.
As I said, though. Thailand has some
spectacularly beautiful scenery.There is one
small. $8 per night private beach resort on
the island of Koh Phi Phi (featured in the
movie "The Beach") best described as this:
if getting laid that night depended on where
you took that special someone, you would
have a 120 percent chance at this resort.
If the lack of English and potable water
gets you down, swing over to Singapore. It's
an island south of Thailand that's connected
by bridge to the southeastern end of
Malaysia. I flew into Singapore expecting a
city of ultra-clean high-rises and a tight
lipped populace, the product of a strict po
lice state. Instead, I didn't see a single police
officer, and the people were among the most
polite and helpful I've ever met, with one
guy offering me everything from beautiful
Russian women and diamonds to "the good
stuff." The food is amazing, the clothes are
cooler than they are here and the public
transportation system is so amazing that
using anything in the U.S. makes me want to
cry. Singapore is like Asia filtered down and
purified. It's more expensive than Thailand,
but still a bargain compared to other big
cities around the world.
If you do fly off to ITiailand and Singa
pore, and find that the trip isn't meeting
your expectations (like rocking the place),a
funny thing may happen. As you board your
plane out.glad to be leaving the country and
start thinking of all the stories that you will
tell your friends back home, at that moment
you might come to realize that you have
truly rocked Asia.
