## Kai Stinchcombe Rumsfeld and other Hoover Institution kooks 
### 
No matter how many late nights Don
ald Rumsfeld puts in at the office in
his coming year at Hoover — writing
and rewriting his memoirs, perhaps, or aban
doning war management for a fresh start in a
new trade, like flute-playing or air condition
er repair — he will still go down in history as
the guy who started the failed Iraq war.
Now Rumsfeld is our new neighbor.
Among his pals at the I loover Institution, he
is certainly far-and-away the one with the
most blood on his hands — and in the final
reckoning, the needless deaths of hundreds
of thousands of people has got to count for
something. (Back in Washington, Rumsfeld
played cat-and-mouse with the press, his in
souciance untroubled by the disaster abroad.
On this topic, if you haven't already. Google
"rumsfeld poetry.")
He's certainly not the only kook hanging
around the ever-so-phallic tower on our cam
pus. The very clever Hoover business model
uses serious academic research to legitimize
a few right-wing screeds and famous war
mongers, uses the screeds and warmongers
to raise money and uses the money to fund
serious academic research. So most of the
people at Hoover are good researchers of
various political persuasions — and some,
like Sid Drell, Bill Perry and Larry Diamond
are legitimate national treasures — it's just
that that's not the part you usually hear
about.
St) here's a quick guide to some of our
most controversial local screed-writers who
Donald Rumsfeld will be joining at Hoover:
Thomas (iale Moore — Moore is a no
table climate change skeptic, author of "Cli
mate of Fear: Why We Shouldn't Worry
about Global Warming." Warmer weather,
according to Moore, means a longer growing
season and more days at the beach. Of
course, climate models predict more severe
storms, growing deserts and a rising sea level
that will make hundreds of millions home
less, but don't let that worry you. Moore says
— just focus on the question, "Do you like
warm weather or cold weather better?"

If Rumsfeld goes into the oil industry, per
haps he and Moore can have an "office
warming" celebration together...
Charles Hill — 1 first came to know of
Charles Hill when the Roosevelt Institution
launched at Yale, and the Yale Herald re
porter asked him to provide a skeptical
quote.
Check out Charles Hill: Roosevelt mem
bers "are likely to exhaust themselves in
spinning their mental wheels." His advice?
"Better to tend to your Yale education while
here and save think-tank work for summer
internships."
I remember thinking to myself, "Who is
this who tells a group of idealistic young
people to shut up and go home?" A quick
Google search provided a fuller picture.This
was also the guy who said "Model U.N. has
ruined a whole generation of American
diplomats" — basically, by erroneously giv
ing young people the idea that problems can
be solved peacefully. If this guy's slamming
Model U.N., he's a critic 1 can live with.
Dinesh D'Sou/a — Oh, where to begin!
D'Souza is most famous for his recent book
"The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left
and Its Responsibility for 9/11." in which he
argues that the American left is engaged in
an "aggressive global campaign to under
mine the traditional patriarchal family," and
that homosexuality, promiscuity, feminism,
birth control and the Vagina Monologues of
fended Islamic cultural conservatives and led
to 9/11. His proposal? American conserva
tives should make common cause with ter
rorist sympathizers to defend patriarchy
against its foes (i.e. feminists, gays and liber
als). I've often thought we ought to look
more closely at how American conservatives
wage war against cultural fundamentalism
abroad and stoke it at home, but I never
thought I d hear that case made so eloquent
ly by the right itself.
Want to find out more about his early
work? Google "If blacks can close the civi
lization gap. the race problem in this country
is likely to become insignificant."

Ed Meese — During the Iran-Contra af
fair. Hoover Fellow Edwin Meese was the
nation's top law enforcement officer, the At
torney General. For 10 months before the
scandal broke, he was aware of illegal arms
sales to an enemy nation to illegally fund in
surgents somewhere else. His role? When it
became public, he was Reagan's point man
for damage control, conducting off-the
record interviews with each of the key play
ers, altering or destroying National Security
Council transcripts and neglecting to pre
serve the documents Oliver North shredded.
Other than that, he is most famous for
chairing the Meese Commission, which pro
duced a 2,()(H)-page report on pornography
for Ronald Reagan. Porn? Clear and present
danger to our nation's security. Arming Iran?
Naah.
I.aura Ingraham — One of the few
women in right-wing talk radio. Laura Ingra
ham (formerly engaged to Dinesh D'Souza.
among others) generated the most contro
versy while at Princeton for secretly taping
meetings of the campus Gay Students Asso
ciation. She published transcripts, outing the
students in the campus newspaper — and
then sent copies of the tapes to their parents.
Since the episode caused a 10-year estrange
ment from her gay brother, her newer books
have been cloaked in more moderate lan
guage, promoting the traditional family
against liberals, the United Nations, women
with jobs. I lollywood. feminists and Wiccans.
Hillary Clinton, gays, the HPV vaccine and
its various other enemies. Ingraham. inciden
tally. once invited me onto her show to ask
me why I hated our troops. It was a very short
interview...
So. as the protests and controversy swirl
outside. Rumsfeld won't be lonely when he
first arrives at Hoover — he'll have lots of
his kooky old pals on the inside to keep him
company.
