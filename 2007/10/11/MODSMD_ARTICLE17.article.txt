## New data center arrives on campus 
### JULIE KLEIN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Secure Data Center, part of
the Institute for Research in the So
cial Sciences at Stanford (IRiSS),
will open this month to provide re
searchers with the facilities needed
to study confidential data sets.
The center will initially acquire
data that is collected and maintained
by the Census Bureau's Research
Data Centers. Access to that infor
mation will be available this year in
collaboration with UC-Berkeley. In
the future, the center plans to pro
vide data from the Center for Ilealth
Statistics and Social Security, among
other organizations.
The center will focus on the grow
ing demand for microdata — data
on individual survey respondents
that isanonymized for confidentiali
ty -and protection of this secure

information.
"This is the first center of its
type in the country," said founding
Director Matthew Snipp, a sociolo
gy professor. "We are the first to
start thinking with a broader vision
of what it takes to make data se
cure."
Currently, researchers must en
dure a lengthy process in order to at
tain confidential data from individ
ual organizations. Snipp explained
that the Secure Data Center will
help faculty and students by consoli
dating data from various sources.
"We will work with organizations
and help them rest assured that the
data is secure," Snipp said. "There is
a lot of confidential information that
should not be divulged to anybody
who is curious."
"Our hope is that the center will
become a real resource for all facul
ty and students whose work requires

access to restricted data," added So
ciology Prof. Karen Cook, director
of IRiSS. in an email to The Daily.
"In the future such data will be im
portant for understanding key social
issues relating to social welfare pro
grams. educational attainment, so
cial security and health insurance
programs, as examples."
Snipp said that the IRiSS —
which brings faculty, graduate stu
dents and undergraduate students
from all social science departments
together for multi-disciplinary re
search — has been planning the Se
cure Data Center for many years.
"1 was one of the originators,"
Snipp said. "Looking down the road
a ways, there are all sorts of surveys
and data that we would like to col
lect."
