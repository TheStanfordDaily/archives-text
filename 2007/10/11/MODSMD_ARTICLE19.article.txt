On paper, the Burdette sisters, sophomore Lindsay and
Erin '05, are as close as you can get. Both highly-touted re
cruits for the Stanford women's tennis program, Lindsay
and Erin come from a tennis-strong family from their par
ents down to their siblings.
, In her four years at Stanford, Erin proved herself on the collegiate
stage, becoming a four-time All-American with a 118-30 career overall
record. She is also No. 15 in Stanford history with 77 career dual victo
ries.
Last season, younger sister Lindsay was just entering Stanford as an
unproven freshman, already with high expectations for her game.
On top of the pressure, Lindsay was the only freshman on an experi
enced squad and had been home-schooled for her last three years of
high school.
"It was definitely hard at times, and I felt that it took me until the end
of fall quarter to really feel connected and part of the team," Lindsay
said.
"But if it was going to happen to anyone on the team, the best person
would be me because of Erin and the history that I learned about from
her," she added. "I felt that I knew a lot about what the team expected

and what it would require as far as effort and time."
Responding to the challenges around her. Burdette
began her collegiate career with four consecutive
