## Lindsay Burdette Women's Tennis It's all in the family 
### BY ANTHONY NGUYEN 
I
On paper, the Burdette sisters, sophomore Lindsay and
Erin '05, are as close as you can get. Both highly-touted re
cruits for the Stanford women's tennis program, Lindsay
and Erin come from a tennis-strong family from their par
ents down to their siblings.
, In her four years at Stanford, Erin proved herself on the collegiate
stage, becoming a four-time All-American with a 118-30 career overall
record. She is also No. 15 in Stanford history with 77 career dual victo
ries.
Last season, younger sister Lindsay was just entering Stanford as an
unproven freshman, already with high expectations for her game.
On top of the pressure, Lindsay was the only freshman on an experi
enced squad and had been home-schooled for her last three years of
high school.
"It was definitely hard at times, and I felt that it took me until the end
of fall quarter to really feel connected and part of the team," Lindsay
said.
"But if it was going to happen to anyone on the team, the best person
would be me because of Erin and the history that I learned about from
her," she added. "I felt that I knew a lot about what the team expected

and what it would require as far as effort and time."
Responding to the challenges around her. Burdette
began her collegiate career with four consecutive
_ J ! J i P. • i M 1. T -

wins and a runner-up finish at the Saint Mary's In
vitational last October.

A year later, Lindsay has certainly lived up to
her sister's standards; the numbers don't lie.
Both sisters were honored as Intercollegiate
Tennis Association (ITA) Singles All-Ameri
~ «u, • ~ r u. :

cans alter their respective freshman campaigns.
Both also finished their seasons ranked No. 13
in the final ITA doubles rankings, losing in the

quarterfinals of their respective NCAA Doubles
Championships (2002 and 2007).
Erin had a 43-7 overall record including a 25-1 mark in

dual match competition, while Lindsay was 31-6 overall with an 18-2
dual match record.

Erin was 4-0 in NCAA Tourna
ment play, and made the semifinals
of the NCAA Singles Champi
onships: Lindsay was 2-0 (most like
ly 3-0 had her final match not been
cut short) and made the quarterfi
nals of the Championships before
losing to Miami's No. 1 Audra
Cohen.
Though it is safe to say that both
Lindsay and Erin are pretty much
identical on paper, Lindsay dis
agrees.
"The numbers are similar," Lind
say said, "but everything else isn't."
In fact, their personalities and

playing styles could not be any more
different.
"Erin is very shy, very reserved
and very quiet," Burdette said.
"Everybody loves her because she's
genuine and an extremely hard
worker."
"That also translated into her
game," Lindsay continued. "Erin
would fight and scrap it out to the
very end for as long as it took. She
had great volleys, great serves, but in
singles she was more at the baseline."
Lindsay, on the other hand, is
quite the opposite.
"I'm much more outgoing and ag
gressive and that comes out in my
game," Lindsay said. "I really get to
the net a lot in singles, and i play a
much more attacking game style."
Moreover. Lindsay hopes to sur
pass the feats of her sister by the time
her career is over.

In her junior year, Erin was
poised to garner a number of individ
ual honors, cementing her name into
the Stanford record books.
But. after an unfortunate back
hand. Erin required wrist surgery
and sat out the ITA Indoor Champi
onships and the Northwest Regional
Championships. Erin would also sit
out most of her senior year with
shoulder problems, often playing
through pain when necessary.
Lindsay, who has faced similar in
juries. hopes that she is past them for
good. Months before entering Stan
ford. Lindsay opted for wrist surgery,
which has left her painless since.
"Everything's been good since
I've had the wrist surgery." Lindsay
said."l didn't realize it but l had been
suffering from it my whole tennis ca
reer. And it wasn't until after
l got it fixed that I realized what it

was like to be without pain."
And, while the elder Erin studied
biology during her stay on the Farm,
Lindsay's interests fall into less aca
demically stressful fields, allowing
her to concentrate more on her ten
nis game.
"Erin went through the whole
premed track and it made her tennis
so much tougher with the tons of
work she had." Lindsay said. "Her
labs were always during practice and
usually all of the toughest classes
were offered during spring, right in
the middle of NCAAs."
Despite all of the comparisons
and predictions, the Burdette sisters
remain as tightly knit as ever.
"Our relationship has only grown
stronger since she went off to school
and especially since I've been here,"
Lindsay said.
Furthermore, Lindsay welcomes

the friendly competition between
the two.
"We're competitive but it's never
direct," Lindsay said, 'it's challeng
ing each other to do better versus
comparing what we've done to each
other. I hope to do the same things as
good or better than she did. but we
don't necessarily dwell on results."
In the end, no matter who sets the
most school records, Lindsay and
Erin will always have a special bond
beyond the courts.
"I feel like Erin's such a huge part
of why I'm here." Lindsay said.
"Erin's always had the unbelievable
work ethic, and she definitely blazed
the trail for me. Whatever I may dif
fer from Erin. 1 make up for in talent
and Erin's guiding experience."

A year later, Lindsay has certainly lived up to
her sister's standards; the numbers don't lie.
Both sisters were honored as Intercollegiate
Tennis Association (ITA) Singles All-Ameri
~ «u, • ~ r u. :

cans alter their respective freshman campaigns.
Both also finished their seasons ranked No. 13
in the final ITA doubles rankings, losing in the

quarterfinals of their respective NCAA Doubles
Championships (2002 and 2007).
Erin had a 43-7 overall record including a 25-1 mark in

dual match competition, while Lindsay was 31-6 overall with an 18-2
dual match record.

Erin was 4-0 in NCAA Tourna
ment play, and made the semifinals
of the NCAA Singles Champi
onships: Lindsay was 2-0 (most like
ly 3-0 had her final match not been
cut short) and made the quarterfi
nals of the Championships before
losing to Miami's No. 1 Audra
Cohen.
Though it is safe to say that both
Lindsay and Erin are pretty much
identical on paper, Lindsay dis
agrees.
"The numbers are similar," Lind
say said, "but everything else isn't."
In fact, their personalities and

playing styles could not be any more
different.
"Erin is very shy, very reserved
and very quiet," Burdette said.
"Everybody loves her because she's
genuine and an extremely hard
worker."
"That also translated into her
game," Lindsay continued. "Erin
would fight and scrap it out to the
very end for as long as it took. She
had great volleys, great serves, but in
singles she was more at the baseline."
Lindsay, on the other hand, is
quite the opposite.
"I'm much more outgoing and ag
gressive and that comes out in my
game," Lindsay said. "I really get to
the net a lot in singles, and i play a
much more attacking game style."
Moreover. Lindsay hopes to sur
pass the feats of her sister by the time
her career is over.

In her junior year, Erin was
poised to garner a number of individ
ual honors, cementing her name into
the Stanford record books.
But. after an unfortunate back
hand. Erin required wrist surgery
and sat out the ITA Indoor Champi
onships and the Northwest Regional
Championships. Erin would also sit
out most of her senior year with
shoulder problems, often playing
through pain when necessary.
Lindsay, who has faced similar in
juries. hopes that she is past them for
good. Months before entering Stan
ford. Lindsay opted for wrist surgery,
which has left her painless since.
"Everything's been good since
I've had the wrist surgery." Lindsay
said."l didn't realize it but l had been
suffering from it my whole tennis ca
reer. And it wasn't until after
l got it fixed that I realized what it

was like to be without pain."
And, while the elder Erin studied
biology during her stay on the Farm,
Lindsay's interests fall into less aca
demically stressful fields, allowing
her to concentrate more on her ten
nis game.
"Erin went through the whole
premed track and it made her tennis
so much tougher with the tons of
work she had." Lindsay said. "Her
labs were always during practice and
usually all of the toughest classes
were offered during spring, right in
the middle of NCAAs."
Despite all of the comparisons
and predictions, the Burdette sisters
remain as tightly knit as ever.
"Our relationship has only grown
stronger since she went off to school
and especially since I've been here,"
Lindsay said.
Furthermore, Lindsay welcomes

the friendly competition between
the two.
"We're competitive but it's never
direct," Lindsay said, 'it's challeng
ing each other to do better versus
comparing what we've done to each
other. I hope to do the same things as
good or better than she did. but we
don't necessarily dwell on results."
In the end, no matter who sets the
most school records, Lindsay and
Erin will always have a special bond
beyond the courts.
"I feel like Erin's such a huge part
of why I'm here." Lindsay said.
"Erin's always had the unbelievable
work ethic, and she definitely blazed
the trail for me. Whatever I may dif
fer from Erin. 1 make up for in talent
and Erin's guiding experience."
