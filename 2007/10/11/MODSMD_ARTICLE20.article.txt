# Card falls short at tourney
## Women's golf finishes in seventh place at the Edean Ilhanfeldt Invite 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
The Stanford women's golf team entered the
final round of the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational
with little chance of winning the tournament for the
second straight year — after Tuesday's second
round, the No. 15 Cardinal sat 19 shots behind the
leader. No. 4 Southern California. A top-five finish
was more realistic, but after a poor showing on the
last five holes of the course, Stanford fell to its final
standing in seventh.
The Cardinal, which started yesterday in sixth
position, began the day slow, with the exception of
sophomore Catherina Wang, who shot +1 on the
front nine.The team was much more solid at the be
ginning of the back nine, shooting +1 total over
holes 11-13.
Junior Mari Chun, who finished the tournament
at +5, birdied two holes over that span, while junior
Ki-Shui Liao(+l4) and freshman Rebecca Durham
(+l9) birdied one hole each.
If the team had maintained that pace over the
last five holes, they would have had a shot at fourth
place — Stanford finished 28 shots behind USC, the
tournament's champion, but only ten strokes be
hind Oregon, who placed in third. However, the
Cardinal shot +6 over that span, which not only
ended its bid for a top-five finish, but also allowed
No. 11 Pepperdine to move into sixth place.
"Obviously, we would have liked to finish bet
ter," said coach Caroline O'Connor.
"We played pretty well, but we
didn't finish well," said Liao.
The team — especially Liao —
was able to strike the ball well in all
rounds, but poor putting plagued the
Cardinal throughout the tourna
ment, although it did improve from
day to day.
O'Connor specifically highlight
ed the improvement in Durham and
sophomore Angela King's (+18)
short game yesterday. Still, O'Con
nor said that the team was "not as
confident on the greens as we should
have been."
Liao attributed this to overcast
weather conditions at the Sahalee
Country Club course, which caused a
softer green, which in turn led to
slower ball movement.
"The balls didn't roll well," she
said. "The soft greens are in stark
contrast to those at the Stanford golf
course, which are harder and thus

allow the ball to roll well."
The Cardinal will he back in their
comfort zone next week, when they
host the Stanford Intercollegiate
tournament.
"Next week should be a much
better week." said O'Connor, whose
team finished fourth in the competi
tion last year.
Stanford will be against a much
tougher field than that of the Ih
lanfeldt Invitational — its competi
tion features nine top-25 teams, in
cluding No. 1 Duke, No. 2 UCLA
and last year's champion. No. 11
Vanderbilt.
Liao said that in preparation, the
Cardinal will focus intently on im
proving their short game and ball
striking skills. But the Cardinal feels
as if its improvement over the first
three tournaments will finally show
in the Stanford Invitational.
O'Connor's confidence in her
team appears to never waver.
"We certainly feel like we could
win," she said.
