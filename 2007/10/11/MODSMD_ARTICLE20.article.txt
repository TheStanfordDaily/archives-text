# Card falls short at tourney
## Women's golf finishes in seventh place at the Edean Ilhanfeldt Invite 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
The Stanford women's golf team entered the
final round of the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational
with little chance of winning the tournament for the
second straight year — after Tuesday's second
round, the No. 15 Cardinal sat 19 shots behind the
leader. No. 4 Southern California. A top-five finish
was more realistic, but after a poor showing on the
last five holes of the course, Stanford fell to its final
standing in seventh.
The Cardinal, which started yesterday in sixth
position, began the day slow, with the exception of
sophomore Catherina Wang, who shot +1 on the
front nine.The team was much more solid at the be
ginning of the back nine, shooting +1 total over
holes 11-13.
Junior Mari Chun, who finished the tournament
at +5, birdied two holes over that span, while junior
Ki-Shui Liao(+l4) and freshman Rebecca Durham
(+l9) birdied one hole each.
If the team had maintained that pace over the
last five holes, they would have had a shot at fourth
place — Stanford finished 28 shots behind USC, the
tournament's champion, but only ten strokes be
hind Oregon, who placed in third. However, the
Cardinal shot +6 over that span, which not only
ended its bid for a top-five finish, but also allowed
No. 11 Pepperdine to move into sixth place.
"Obviously, we would have liked to finish bet
ter," said coach Caroline O'Connor.
