No. 2 Cardinal women square off against No.

State 0-5 Pac-10) on Thursday, and
Washington (16-0,5-0) will play No. 10 Cali
fornia in Berkeley before Friday's showdown
of the respective 2004 and 2005 national
champions. The Cardinal won its record sixth
title the year before the Huskies notched their
first. The teams last met in the 2006 national
semifinal, where Stanford dismantled Wash
ington en route to the final match.
Before facing off against the Huskies, how
ever. the ( ardinal will need to get past Wash
ington State. The Cougars have yet to win a
match in conference, though they lost a battle
with Oregon State in their Pac-10 opener,
falling 16-14 in the fifth game.
Washington State opened its season with
six straight wins, but is still l<x>king for its first
Pac-10 victory, which will likely be hard to find
against Stanford. Cal, UCLA and USC

Junior Foluke Akinradewo and freshman Alix Klineman have been integral to the undefeated Cardinal's success this year. Stanford
(16-0, 5-0 Pac-10) will face another unbeaten squad in No. 8 Washington (16-0, 5-0 Pac-10) this Friday at Maples Pavilion.
"I think Washington State is simi
lar to everybody else in the Pac-10 in
that they are better than last year,"
Head Coach John Dunning said.
"Just about everybody in this confer
ence is.They have had a good number
of wins and some success this year,
though not as much as I am sure they
would want. But they are a better
team and will be a good challenge for
us."
I"he Cardinal swept the Cougars
in both of their meetings last year,
the first and last matches of the con
ference season. The second victory
clinched Stanford's first Pac-10
championship since 2001.
Jackie Albright is the top hitter
for WSU in 2007, with 211 kills on
the season. Libero Kelly Hyder has
five digs per game, putting her fourth
in the conference standings.
The Cardinal has only lost to the
Cougars three times in the history of
both programs; Stanford last lost to
WSU in 2002.
After each team won at home
during the conference season. Stan
ford held Washington to only 12
points in the first game of the match
in Omaha. The Cardinal swept be
fore finally falling to Nebraska in the
championship.
The Huskies have cruised
through the 2007 season so far,
sweeping 14 of their 16 opponents
and being pushed to a fifth game
only once, at No. l l ) Oregon. Aside
from the Ducks, however, Washing
ton has only played one other
ranked team — Long Beach State
took the Huskies to four games and
has since dropped out of the top 25.
"The fact that they haven't beat
so-and-so and so-and-so doesn't
mean they can't be the best team in
the country," Dunning said. "I am
sure they will be terrific. Their pro

gram is always really strong, and
they are going to be good every year.
They are well coached and have
some fine athletes."
Washington will close out the first
half of the conference season with a
pair of brutal weekends, visiting Cal
and Stanford before returning home
to host No. 4 UCLA and No. b USC.
After All-American setter Court
ney Thompson graduated last year,
the Huskies have leaned heavily on
four seniors and their freshman set
ter for their wins so far. Outside hit
ters Stevie Mussie and Christal Mor
rison are the focus of the offense
with 182 and 181 kills, respectively.
Redshirt freshman Becky Perry has
kept pace and has 182 kills of her
own.
Newcomer Jenna Hagglund has
set for Washington from the get-go
and is averaging 13.8 assists per
game,second only to Stanford senior
Bryn Kehoe in the conference.
"They have a girl on their team
who is new to the program and has
n't lost yet," Dunning said. "So she
probably believes that is what will
continue to happen. Courtney
Ibompson won a lot,a whole lot, and
now they have a new setter who is
doing the same thing. I am sure she
has a lot of confidence and 1 have
heard very good things said about
her."
After the pounding they took in
the NCAA semifinals last year, the
Huskies will likely be looking for
some revenge in Maples this week.
"It is a good rivalry we have with
them." Dunning said. "We have had
some great matches over the last
four years. The fact that we beat
them in the Final Four — you just
hate that. It's the same way we feel
about Nebraska. It's motivating and
they will want to come in and get us.
And that should make for a great
match. I hope that every seat is full
because it will be a blast."
