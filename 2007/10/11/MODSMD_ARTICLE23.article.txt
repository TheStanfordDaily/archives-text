# Men's Tennis gets its bearings during the fall season
## 
### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the NCAA deems men's tennis a spring
sport, the Stanford men's tennis team starts its sea
son in September.The Cardinal plays its first official
Pac-10 match on Feb. 1, 2008, almost five months
from now. But by the end of this weekend, the team
will have already competed in a preseason match
and two preseason tournaments.
"The goal of the fall is to prepare for the spring,"
said junior Jeff Zeller. "In the spring, we work on
learning how to win matches given your limits, no
matter if you are the No. 1 player or playing at No. 6
singles. Fall is a time to extend those limits to their
greatest potential so you will have the best opportu
nity to win."
The fall tournaments are all individual singles
and doubles play, and Stanford never competes of
ficially as a team except in two preseason dual
matches. Hie fall is good for getting match experi
ence and playing against different styles of players,
as well as adding things to one's game, physically,
technically and even mentally.The fall is also a time
for players to get in shape.
"During the fall we lift weights and have morn
ing workouts and work hard in that aspect." said
sophomore Kevin Kaiser. "You need to be in good
shape to be able to endure the long season and long
matches."
"Fall tennis is focused on improving the physical
aspects of your game," sophomore Richard Wire
said. "Like your body, your fitness, or your hit
stroke."
Fall is also a time to work with
doubles partners. Since there are
only three doubles pairings in a dual
match, it is imperative that the Car
dinal has three duos who play well
together and have the right chem
istry.
"Fall is a great time to see where
all the guys fit in together," said
coach John Whitlinger. "We work
with many different doubles pairings
to see where guys fit well. [The fall] is
an exciting time looking forward to
the new season with the returners
and the new [freshmen]."
Many of the players noted that
the one downside to fall is that they
never get to compete as a team. Fall
tournaments are all about what the
individual can do and how far the in
dividual can advance in a certain
tournament; the spring is about wins
and losses as a collective team.
"If you lose a match in a fall tour
nament you are done," said Kaiser,
"If you lose a match in spring, you
still have five other guys that can
win. and most importantly get a win
for a team."
"In fall you generally play for

yourself and your own improve
ment." Zeller said. "In spring, we
play for our teammates standing on
the court next to us. We play for
Stanford University and the tradi
tion of Stanford tennis."
Another unique aspect of fall is
the annual trip the team takes to
Hawaii over Thanksgiving Break.
There, the Cardinal teaches clinics
all day, practices and eventually
plays a match against the Universi
ty of Hawaii. After preseason tour
naments. the trip serves as a good
way to wind down in preparation
for the regular season. After that,
the season begins to creep up very
quickly.
"No matter what, 1 am looking
forward to that first match of the
season," said Zeller. "It is hard to get
that out of your mind during the fall.
"It definitely makes a difference
when you are practicing for the de
fending national champions on a day
in January versus just practicing on a
day in the fall."
On Jan. 26,2008, the Cardinal will
take on defending national champi
on Georgia at theTaube Family Ten
nis Center. It's a pretty sure bet the
team is using the fall to get ready for
that one.
