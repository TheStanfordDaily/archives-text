## 
### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the NCAA deems men's tennis a spring
sport, the Stanford men's tennis team starts its sea
son in September.The Cardinal plays its first official
Pac-10 match on Feb. 1, 2008, almost five months
from now. But by the end of this weekend, the team
will have already competed in a preseason match
and two preseason tournaments.
"The goal of the fall is to prepare for the spring,"
said junior Jeff Zeller. "In the spring, we work on
learning how to win matches given your limits, no
matter if you are the No. 1 player or playing at No. 6
singles. Fall is a time to extend those limits to their
greatest potential so you will have the best opportu
nity to win."
The fall tournaments are all individual singles
and doubles play, and Stanford never competes of
ficially as a team except in two preseason dual
matches. Hie fall is good for getting match experi
ence and playing against different styles of players,
as well as adding things to one's game, physically,
technically and even mentally.The fall is also a time
for players to get in shape.
"During the fall we lift weights and have morn
ing workouts and work hard in that aspect." said
sophomore Kevin Kaiser. "You need to be in good
shape to be able to endure the long season and long
matches."
"Fall tennis is focused on improving the physical
aspects of your game," sophomore Richard Wire
said. "Like your body, your fitness, or your hit
stroke."
