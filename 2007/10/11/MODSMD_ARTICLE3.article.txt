# Frosh expansion
## Hennessy ponders idea of larger freshman class 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
Alumni may look back on
Stanford's record-sized Class of
2011 as a small one if a recent pro
posal by President John I lennessy
becomes a reality. Hennessy
urged alumni, faculty, students,
trustees and admissions person
nel to begin dialogue about the
expansion of the freshman class in
his column featured in the Sep
tember/October issue of the Stan
ford Magazine.
The President cited the nearly
24,000 applicants last year — a
record for the University — as ev
idence that demand for a Stanford
education is at an all-time high.
Dean of Admissions Richard
Shaw said that an increase in stu
dent body size would have no im
pact on student excellence.
Apart from providing a world
class education to more qualified
students, Shaw said that increas
ing the student body could also di
versify the undergraduate popu
lation.
"Demand is high for select
elite universities in the country,"
Shaw said. "If you have the capac
ity and the will to provide the ed
ucation to extremely qualified

students from different socioeco
nomic backgrounds, then why
wouldn't you try to give more
people access to a world class ed
ucation? It's certainly not out of
the realm of reason to propose
this."
President Hennessy shared
Shaw's view that an increase in
class size would not diminish the
quality of the student body. In his
column, Hennessy referenced
data from standardized test scores
to show that applicants are be
coming increasingly qualified
whereas the total number of un
dergraduate students has leveled
out in the 6,000-range for the past
35 years.
Hennessy was not available for
additional comment.
But Shaw and I Icnnessy both
acknowledged that the University
might face a number of other chal
lenges if administrators decided
to expand the size of the freshman
class.
"Anytime we consider this
kind of objective, it's clear that it
has impact in lots of different
places," Shaw said. "In order to
sustain and maintain the strength
and quality of our programs and
the undergraduate experience,
the idea of increasing the student

numbers will include the need to
increase resources, housing, facul
ty [and] the admissions office as it
relates to evaluating the candi
dates."
Shaw also acknowledged that
if the size of the freshman class in
creased while the total number of
applicants remained similar, the
University's admissions rate
would go up. But Shaw dismissed
the prevailing assumption that a
low admissions rate correlates to
academic e xce 11 e nee.
He added that there would be
no conscious effort to maintain
the admit rate at its current level
or fix it at any other value.
"Admit rates are very mislead
ing and they shouldn't drive this
discussion in any way," he said. "1
think that we are too focused as a
society on those numbers and
what they mean. If in fact by ad
mitting an extra number of stu
dents, you still maintain the quali
ty of your class, then ves, expand
ing the class size is a good idea re
gardless of what it does to the
admit rate. Admit rates might get
higher, rising to about 12 or 13
percent, hut to me. that's mean
ingless."
Still, Shaw said that dialogue
about expanding the freshman class
is still in its nascent stages.
"As the President has indicated,
this is a very early conversation," he
said, "It will involve input from
many constituents, the alumni, the
faculty, the students, administrators.
If there in fact is some interest in
this, then you move to the next ques
tion, which is:'To what extent would
we expand?' And right now, there's
no clear answer to that."
