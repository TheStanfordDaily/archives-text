# FACULTY & STAFF
## Morgan and Bobo head for Harvard Husband and wife to return to Boston after three years at Farm 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When acclaimed Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga
left Stanford for the University of Washington last
year, many at the University hoped his departure
would he the last blow to faculty diversity. They were
mistaken. A few weeks before the start of autumn
quarter, Sociology Prof. Lawrence Bobo and his wife,
Associate Communication Prof. Marcyliena Morgan,
announced their move to Harvard effective in Janu
ary.
Bobo, who studies the sociology of race, served as
director of the Center for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity and the Program in African and
African American Studies. The couple came to Stan
ford from Harvard in 2005 after Morgan, a scholar in
hip-hop culture, was denied tenure at the Cambridge,
Mass. university.
Professors Morgan and Bobo were not available
for comment.
Stanford faculty said the loss of the two professors
was due more to their long-standing ties to Harvard
than any failure to offer them incentive to stay. Jim
Fishkin, director of the Department of Communica
tion, said Morgan was up for a promotion to full pro
fessor at Stanford — a title she will be granted at Har
vard.
"We had solicited the (recommendation) letters,"
he said. "We were preparing the case for her promo
tion enthusiastically. It was actually a surprise to us
that she accepted the Harvard offer because we were
in the process of promoting her here."
Department of Sociology Chair Karen Cook
Ph.D. '73 said Harvard had been trying to get Bobo
back since he left for Stanford. Cook cited the cou
ple's prior connections with Harvard as the underly
ing motivation for their decision.
"They have many friends in the Boston area,"
Cook said. "Larry said it was really a tough choice be
tween two positive situations."
Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham. chair of Harvard's
African and African-American Studies Department,
echoed Cook's statements, noting
that the Harvard faculty have been
pushing for Morgan and Bobo's re
turn since they arrived at Stanford.
"I'd like to think that in their case
there was so much personal history
that it did make a difference," Hig
ginbotham said. "1 don't know the
story would have ended this way
had there been no connection, if the
school had no history. We got the im
pression that they enjoyed Stanford
University."
History Prof, and Special Assis
tant to the Provost for Faculty Di
versity Al Camarillo said he was dis
appointed in the implications of
Morgan and Bobo's departure for
faculty diversity, but hopeful that
Stanford would make a push for re
cruiting 10 to 20 faculty of color in
the next few years.
"We try to do everything possible
to keep our faculty who are really
identified as the stars, and Larry
Bobo is a star," Camarillo said. "We
raid one another's institutions —
there are relatively few of these
stars. They get courted practically
every year. We'll continue to recruit,
we'll continue to appoint and we'll
continue to fight to retain people."
Michele Elam, acting director of
the Program in African and African
American Studies,said Stanford will
have to "redouble its efforts" to
build a diverse faculty.
"The loss of faculty of color is not
a good thing," she said. "1 know the
administration has been working
hard and we need to continue work
ing very hard to make sure there's
not an exodus of faculty of color.
"Larry Bobo and Marcyliena
Morgan have made a marvelous im
pact on the campus, and 1 think
everybody's very sorry that they're
leaving," Elam added. "They height
ened the intellectual profile of
African American studies."
