# FACULTY & STAFF
## Morgan and Bobo head for Harvard Husband and wife to return to Boston after three years at Farm 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
When acclaimed Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga
left Stanford for the University of Washington last
year, many at the University hoped his departure
would he the last blow to faculty diversity. They were
mistaken. A few weeks before the start of autumn
quarter, Sociology Prof. Lawrence Bobo and his wife,
Associate Communication Prof. Marcyliena Morgan,
announced their move to Harvard effective in Janu
ary.
Bobo, who studies the sociology of race, served as
director of the Center for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity and the Program in African and
African American Studies. The couple came to Stan
ford from Harvard in 2005 after Morgan, a scholar in
hip-hop culture, was denied tenure at the Cambridge,
Mass. university.
Professors Morgan and Bobo were not available
for comment.
Stanford faculty said the loss of the two professors
was due more to their long-standing ties to Harvard
than any failure to offer them incentive to stay. Jim
Fishkin, director of the Department of Communica
tion, said Morgan was up for a promotion to full pro
fessor at Stanford â€” a title she will be granted at Har
vard.
"We had solicited the (recommendation) letters,"
he said. "We were preparing the case for her promo
tion enthusiastically. It was actually a surprise to us
that she accepted the Harvard offer because we were
in the process of promoting her here."
Department of Sociology Chair Karen Cook
Ph.D. '73 said Harvard had been trying to get Bobo
back since he left for Stanford. Cook cited the cou
ple's prior connections with Harvard as the underly
ing motivation for their decision.
"They have many friends in the Boston area,"
Cook said. "Larry said it was really a tough choice be
tween two positive situations."
