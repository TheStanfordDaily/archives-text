# Bryn Kehoe ■
## Women's Volleyball Kehoe an all-time great for Card 
### BY REBECCA HARLOW 
"Every team she has been on has
won...She'll always find a way, no
matter what it takes, to win."

In its 30-year history, the Stanford women's volleyball
team has seen some great setters — Ail-Americans and
National Team members, and now senior Bryn Kehoe.
The first true freshman to win a national championship
in a single-setter offense. Kehoe is primed to pass all the
giants before her and break the school career record in assists.
"1 have really been paying more attention to the team, but
of course it's quite an honor." she said. "Stanford volleyball
has so much history, and 1 can't believe that I will be up there.
I'm focused much more on the team and the team's success,
but when it happens I will be very honored."
As a freshman, the Cincinnati native broke the Stanford
record for assists in a season with 1.637. Heading into this
weekend's matehes.she is only 6<S away from passing four-time
Ail-American Wendy Rush, who set the career mark of 5,003
in 1987.
And then there was the 2004 NCAA Championship, Stan
ford's sixth and Kehoe's first — though hopefully not her last.
"She is a very, very good setter and has already had a great

career here," head coach
John Dunning said of his
senior captain. "And 1 know
how she wants to finish it —
that's pretty clear."
Kehoe has been at the
center of the Cardinal's suc
cess in the last three years,
setting her entire career ex
cept when she missed the
end of her sophomore cam-

paign with a broken hand, but it took a few years for her to fi
nally be able to step into her dream position.
"I always wanted to be a setter, but when 1 was younger I
just wasn't strong enough." she said. "I couldn't even set an
outside ball."
The daughter of two volleyball players, Bryn was in the
gym long before taking the court herself.
"Both of my parents played, and 1 was a huge gym rat when
I was little —I would go watch them play rec ball every
week," she said. "And I just saw myself playing setter, being in
control of the game. Both of my parents were hitters anil 1
found their relationship with the setter really interesting."
Kehoe has had the opportunity to connect with some great
hitters in her time: 2(M)5 Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year
Ogonna Nnamani, three-time All-American Kristin Richards
'07, and now juniors Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Akinrade
wo and freshman Alix Klineman. who are pounding her sets.
"I'm so grateful to have such wonderful hitters," she said.
"It might sound strange, but I get a lot of pleasure out of my
hitters hammering the ball. When they get kills. I am the hap
piest. It makes my job so easy and so fun."

Even before arriving at Stanford, Kehoe had
success with her high school and club teams and
played with many levels of National Teams.
"One of the key things about Bryn is that,
whatever team she was on, she always won,"
Dunning said. "So she has strived for that con
stantly here as well. She has really improved in
college,even though she was already good com
ing in."
In her first three seasons, Kehoe has won
quite a bit. She and fellow senior Franci Girard
are 102-16 over their careers and have played in
two Final Fours.
Now in her fourth and final year, Kehoe is
beginning to look ahead to life after Stanford
volleyball, or at least she will after the season
ends.
"It's a little scary." she said. "I can't believe
that I'm a senior. The past three seasons have
gone by so quickly. It's a little sad because 1

don't want to leave the team. They have really
been like a second family for me. So it will defi
nitely be hard to leave, but right now I am just
enjoying every second."
A communications major. Kehoe is weigh
ing career options, but might not be done with
sports just yet. perhaps getting involved in the
marketing side of things.
"I just went to the Career Fair on Tuesday
and I sent out a couple of resumes," she said."l
am looking possibly at going into consulting —
I'm a naturally competitive person and it is a
competitive environment. I am also interested
in marketing or PR because I love working with
people and getting hands-on."
Kehoe certainly has the drive to compete in
any field, and the leadership skills to go far. As
a team captain this year.she and co-captains Gi
rard and Akinradewo are responsible for keep
ing coaches, players and recruits happy and on

the same page.
"She cares a lot about the team and is very
dedicated," Dunning said. "She leads by exam
ple. She comes in and works hard every day.
There are no excuses with Bryn. And I think
there are a lot of things about her as a person
that makes her someone that other people on
the team can talk to, get along with and respect."
Kehoe and the 16-0 Cardinal will look to ex
tend the longest winning streak of her career,
and the team's best start in more than a decade,
when they host Washington State and No. 8
Washington this weekend.
"Her success doesn't surprise me at all,"
Dunning said. "Every team she has been on has
won and she wants that. She'll always find a
way, no matter what it takes, to win."
