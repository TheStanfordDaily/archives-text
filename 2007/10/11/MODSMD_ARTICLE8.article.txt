## All eyes up front — gain Night classes cater to students young and old

The left row of the Stanford Bookstore's low
est floor houses a wall of books labeled "Contin
uing Studies." It's comfortably settled across
from the I HUM section and next to the litera
ture on African and Middle Eastern Languages.
For most students, those books are the most
contact they'll have with the Continuing Stud
ies Program (CSP) and its workshops, seminars
and courses taught by Stanford faculty. At
around $400 per quarter per course — less than
half the cost of undergraduate courses — CSP
lets Bay Area residents get a dose of a Stanford
education. Credit does not go towards a Stan
ford degree.
Differences from standard courses are appar
ent at first glance.
Undergraduates in Language Center lecturer
Yu-hwa Rozelle's introductory Chinese classes
might daydream of a future job or marriage. For
Jess Goldberg.a student in Rozelle's CSP Begin
ning Chinese class, not so much. I le was a UPS
executive for 32 years, has three kids and is now
a director of accountant management for Menlo
Worldwide, in San Mateo.
Students in the CSP comprise a wide slice of
society, with many having jobs and families. Oth
ers are retired. Rozelle's class ranges in age from
20 to 60. and in occupation from writers to
lawyers to engineers. Family members, business
and recent travels motivate most who take the
course. In Goldberg's case, it's all three.
His wife is Chinese, and Goldberg yearns to
converse with his in-laws and wife in their first
tongue.
"I have a great desire to be able to 'stumble
through' a conversation with my wife." he said.
"She is most expressive in her native language."
Goldberg first visited China m 19 9.5..whan he
and his wife adopted a daughter. Since then, he
has returned regularly for vacations, and is plan
ning on making a growing number of trips for
business.
The material covered in CSP courses closely
parallels what is taught to undergraduate stu
dents. Rozelle incorporates her own lesson plans

into both her undergraduate and CSP classes.
CSP classes meet only once a week, and with
students balancing career and family, their pace
and teaching style differ.
"I slow down my teaching, and try to under
stand what problems CSP students might have
as Lteacji."..Ro/elle said.
While Rozelle gives her CSP classes home
work and weekly quizzes, they don't have the
midterms she gives to her undergraduate class
es. and the CSP final is take-home.
Goldberg says he's happy with the classes,
wishing only they were a bit longer. He plans to
continue his CSP studies into winter quarter.

"I always look forward to my trips to
China," Goldberg said. "By the end of the
quarter. I hope to gain the ability to partake in
elementary conversations, and to be able to get
through most travel situations."
Rozelle says she's eager to teach her students.
"In Chinese, there is a saying:'you zhi zhe.shi
jing sheng': 'where there is a will, there is a way.'
" said Rozelle. "I have a lot of respect for my
CSP students. I want them to know that it is
never too late to learn Chinese, and that it's
fun."
