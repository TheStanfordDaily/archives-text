## Trustees talk Redwood City campus 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
University leaders are drawing
up plans for a new, stand-alone
North Campus in Redwood City.
Land that has been acquired off of
US-101 will likely he used for admin
istrative offices and Medical Center
outpatient facilities. The campus,
which will be seven miles north of
the University's core, is a central part
of the school's growth strategy.
On Monday and Tuesday, mem
bers of the Board of Trustees re
viewed six plans for the auxiliary
area, including some with wide inte
rior spaces and others with offices
that are more clustered. Some of the
buildings on the site of the new cam
pus are currently occupied or being

leased.
"It's not across the street hut it's
not a long way," said Burt McMurtry
M.5.'59, Ph.D.'62,chair of the Board
of Trustees, during a Wednesday
press availability session. "A lot of
thought has gone into what is the
master plan for that campus. We
want it to be a campus. It won't look
like the Quad, but there's a lot of
thought going into how we can make
it look like a part of the central cam
pus."
One top priority in all new con
struction projects is sustainability.
"We're not just talking about it
but investing a fair amount." Mc-
Murtry said, noting that sustainabili
ty is a priority even when it cannot be
justified financially. "Stanford has a
long time horizon. We should take

advantage of every opportunity we
can to build sustainability."
Another priority for the new
building is making sure that ade
quate parking is provided.
"We have seldom got that right,"
McMurtry said."lt's a hard problem.
We're going to try really hard to have
parking not be a disadvantage of
being there."
The planning is still in its early
stages, McMurtry said, and many
employees are working on the proj
ect.
McMurtry stressed that the new
campus is not a short-term stopgap
to cope with more employees or
staff, but part of a long-term growth
