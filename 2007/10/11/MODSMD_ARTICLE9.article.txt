## Trustees talk Redwood City campus 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
University leaders are drawing
up plans for a new, stand-alone
North Campus in Redwood City.
Land that has been acquired off of
US-101 will likely he used for admin
istrative offices and Medical Center
outpatient facilities. The campus,
which will be seven miles north of
the University's core, is a central part
of the school's growth strategy.
On Monday and Tuesday, mem
bers of the Board of Trustees re
viewed six plans for the auxiliary
area, including some with wide inte
rior spaces and others with offices
that are more clustered. Some of the
buildings on the site of the new cam
pus are currently occupied or being

leased.
"It's not across the street hut it's
not a long way," said Burt McMurtry
M.5.'59, Ph.D.'62,chair of the Board
of Trustees, during a Wednesday
press availability session. "A lot of
thought has gone into what is the
master plan for that campus. We
want it to be a campus. It won't look
like the Quad, but there's a lot of
thought going into how we can make
it look like a part of the central cam
pus."
One top priority in all new con
struction projects is sustainability.
"We're not just talking about it
but investing a fair amount." Mc-
Murtry said, noting that sustainabili
ty is a priority even when it cannot be
justified financially. "Stanford has a
long time horizon. We should take

advantage of every opportunity we
can to build sustainability."
Another priority for the new
building is making sure that ade
quate parking is provided.
"We have seldom got that right,"
McMurtry said."lt's a hard problem.
We're going to try really hard to have
parking not be a disadvantage of
being there."
The planning is still in its early
stages, McMurtry said, and many
employees are working on the proj
ect.
McMurtry stressed that the new
campus is not a short-term stopgap
to cope with more employees or
staff, but part of a long-term growth

Burt McMurtry discussed the Board of Trustees' recent meeting at a media availability session yesterday. The Board
focused on the University's plans to build a new campus seven miles north of Stanford in Redwood City.
strategy.
"Wf; see it as a permanent addi
tion to Stanford." he said. "It's going
to he that, how do we make it look
and feel so that it will be satisfactory
to the people on campus."
The lion's share of the two-day
meeting was dedicated to discussions
about new buildings and land use.
The Board made approvals that will
help several building projects contin
ue along the path to construction, in
cluding one for the Black Communi
ty Service Center and The Daily.
The trustees also were briefed on
the Stanford endowment fund's 23
percent growth to $17.2 billion last
year. McMurtry said that senior offi
cials have been very pleased since
they had expected "quite low returns
for a long period of time" after the
tech bubble burst in 2000.
"It makes a huge difference " he
said, "in the flexibility we have to en
gage in bold initiatives."
