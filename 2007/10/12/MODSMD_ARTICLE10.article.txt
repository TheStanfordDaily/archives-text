### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to increase campus visibility, les
bian. gay. bisexual and transgender community
members and their allies recognized Stanford's
sixth annual National Coming Out Day yester
day.
Jamie Tam 10. an LGBT-Community Re
source Center (LGBT-CRC) staff member, ex
plained that the day was meant to be a celebra
tion.
"It's a way for people who already are out to
say.'Yippee! We made it!' and for people who are

still in the closct to l<x>k around and see that you
can be out and you can be happy" she said.
National Coming Out Day was founded in
19K8 to mark the anniversary l of the previous
year's second National March on Washington
for Ciay and lesbian Rights.
Several dozen Stanford students celebrated
the event with a lunchtime gathering in White
Plaza. LCiBT-CRC staff handed out sandwiches
and miniature rainbow flags while the coming
out stories of Stanford freshmen and transfer
students played through loudspeakers. Students
from the Stanford Spoken Word Collective
stepped up to the microphone to perform pieces

touching on homophobia and sexual identity,
and the day ended with a party in the LGBT
CRC
Many students wore buttons proclaiming
"shOUT. Come clean." Ilie catchphrase was in
spired by Shout laundry detergent's rainbow
colored logo, explained event coordinator
George Morris '08.
"The event is a celebration of the process of
coming out as a positive change," he said, "per
haps like doing laundry."
lam encouraged all LGBT students to cele
brate National Coming Out Day no matter what
step they've reached in the coming out process.

"Just because you're out to some people
doesn't mean you have to be out to everyone."
she said. "You can celebrate being out to your
self."
A handful of people do come out on Nation
al Coming Out Day. according to various LGBT
CRC staff members, but the date itself docs not
seem to spark a flood of announcements.
"I know a lot of coming out happens acciden
tally. or [as] a spur-of-the-moment thing." said
