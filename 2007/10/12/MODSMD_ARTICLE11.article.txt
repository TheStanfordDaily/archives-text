## Founder touts wiki potential Jimmy Wales threatens Google's supremacy, optimistic about future 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Some advice for Sergey Brin and
Larry Page: Put your dukes up. The
guy who conceived Wikipedia is gun
ning for the two Google master
minds, and the potentially imminent
battle could define the future of the
Internet.
Entrepreneur Jimmy Wales, the
main brain behind the Wikipedia
community, made a whirlwind visit to
Stanford yesterday afternoon to
present an intriguing vision of a com
munity-driven, open-source search
engine that would knock Google off
its currently untouchable perch with
in a few meager years.
Before more than 150 audience
members in a packed Law School
classroom, the lively Wales, 41. briefly
explained the history and ideological
foundation of Wikipedia. He then
discussed how he is currently apply
ing the model of freely accessible, vol -
unteer-driven information sharing in
the for-profit company Wikia, which
he founded in 2(X)4 after stepping
away from the Wikipedia Founda
tion.
Wales said that one Wikia project
is an expansion of the Wikipedia
model to eventually encompass "the
sum of all human knowledge," be
yond what is appropriate for an ency
clopedia. including books, opinions
and original research.
Wales said the essence of
Wikipedia is that it shifts the empha
sis of the information-sharing para
digm from a trust in "gatekeeping"
authorities to accountability of users.
With traditional encyclopedias, con
tributors were screened and only
qualified authors of content would
publish material that was then pre
sumed to be the authoritative "truth"
by laypeople. The new. underlying
ideology behind Wikia is that every
body can contribute, but the masses
will quickly decide who is qualified
and who is not, and those who arc not
qualified or abuse the freedom will
soon be pushed out of the picture.
What became apparent early in
the conversation, however, is that
what really captivates Wales is the
possibility of realizing his dream of
Wikia Search — a highly publicized,
open-source competitor to the
Google search engine. For all its
seeming dominance in every front of
the quickly evolving Internet, the
huge success of Google is fundamen
tally built upon the brilliance of its
highly guarded search engine algo
rithm — "much like the Coca Cola
recipe" — constantly tweaked by the
brightest computing minds in the Sil
icon Valley so searchers always get
the most relevant results.
But Wales said that because the
algorithm is secret, when a user sees
the list of search results, it is essen
tially "Google telling you that these
are the ten most important things on
this subject." Therefore. Wales
added. Google is passing its own "ed
itorial judgment" in the very act of
supplying selected links during a
search.
There is also the issue of security,
according to Wales. Internet spam
mers constantly look for ways to trick
Google into listing their Web sites at
the top of the list. If spammers knew
the algorithm, the abuse would per
haps reach horrific levels. Yet even
with all the geniuses Google lures to
its Mountain View headquarters,
Wales argued, its blanket of secrecy is
an intrinsic and limiting weakness.
"If you need to keep your algo
rithm secret, it means your algorithm

sucks," Wales said, referring to the
battle between Google's program
mers and spammers as an "arms race
between good and bad guys."
Wales said that if a search engine's
source code was simply released to
the public and a large number of vol
unteer users constantly monitored
the results like with Wikipedia.then it
would actually be a better defense
against spammers. Plus, users at the
grassroots level, instead of a compa
ny like Google, could then decide
which links should come up first
when a search is inputted and what
the public should see and read first
on any given topic.
Wales offered a few more exam
ples of Google's shortcomings: When
someone uses Google to find accom
modations at Hilton hotels in Paris,
the results are most likely about the
celebrity because Google doesn't
have a disambiguation page like
Wikipedia and can't afford to devote
millions of employee work-hours to
crawling the Web and setting one up.
With a user base-driven Wikia
Search, Wales claimed, the much

greater number of volunteers would
quickly make useful disambiguation
pages a übiquitous reality.
Considering how effortlessly
Wikipedia brushed aside propriety
encyclopedias edited by academic
authorities like Encyclopedia Britan
nica, Wales is optimistic that Wikia
Search can similarly dent Google. In
fact, the monthly business magazine
Fast Company put Wales on its
March issue cover with the caption
"Google's worst nightmare."
With the firm establishment of the
Wikipedia brand name, attracting in
vestment capital for Wikia has not
been the slightest problem for Wales.
Amazon bought a major stake in
Wikia at the end of 2(X)6, and the
fledgling company has been the talk
of the blogosphere and the industry
proper. Wales said yesterday that Bill
Gates approached him recently at a
dinner party to ask about Wikia
Search.
While Wales acknowledged that
Wikia Search could be a threat to
Google's market share in search, he
quickly moved to blunt the threat of

his own operation.
"1 don't think we're Google's
worst nightmare," he said. "The real
worst nightmare is another propriety
search engine."
The obstacles facing Wales with
the search engine are perhaps much
greater than he ever faced with the
encyclopedia. The nuances of editori
al bias in search results are much
more subtle than the content of an
encyclopedia entry, and tinkering
with search engine algorithms re
quires a much greater level of techni

cal expertise.
Google's brand and market dom
inance is arguably also completely
secure and difficult to assault. Wales
admitted as much and said that
"Wikia is losing a large amount of
money."
But then again, Wales, a former
hedge fund manager who is now re
turning to his comfort zone of for
profit ventures, repeatedly reassured
the audience that if there is one thing
he knows how to do, it's "building
communities" and getting the most

productivity out of a huge collection
of rational beings.
"It's an extensive reliance on algo
rithms versus human participation,"
he said.
If Wikipedia indeed proved that
the participation of millions of hu
mans can be harnessed with great ef
fect, then Google may truly have
something to worry about in the very
near future.
