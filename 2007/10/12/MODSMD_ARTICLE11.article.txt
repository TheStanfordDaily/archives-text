## Founder touts wiki potential Jimmy Wales threatens Google's supremacy, optimistic about future 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Some advice for Sergey Brin and
Larry Page: Put your dukes up. The
guy who conceived Wikipedia is gun
ning for the two Google master
minds, and the potentially imminent
battle could define the future of the
Internet.
Entrepreneur Jimmy Wales, the
main brain behind the Wikipedia
community, made a whirlwind visit to
Stanford yesterday afternoon to
present an intriguing vision of a com
munity-driven, open-source search
engine that would knock Google off
its currently untouchable perch with
in a few meager years.
Before more than 150 audience
members in a packed Law School
classroom, the lively Wales, 41. briefly
explained the history and ideological
foundation of Wikipedia. He then
discussed how he is currently apply
ing the model of freely accessible, vol -
unteer-driven information sharing in
the for-profit company Wikia, which
he founded in 2(X)4 after stepping
away from the Wikipedia Founda
tion.
Wales said that one Wikia project
is an expansion of the Wikipedia
model to eventually encompass "the
sum of all human knowledge," be
yond what is appropriate for an ency
clopedia. including books, opinions
and original research.
Wales said the essence of
Wikipedia is that it shifts the empha
sis of the information-sharing para
digm from a trust in "gatekeeping"
authorities to accountability of users.
With traditional encyclopedias, con
tributors were screened and only
qualified authors of content would
publish material that was then pre
sumed to be the authoritative "truth"
by laypeople. The new. underlying
ideology behind Wikia is that every
body can contribute, but the masses
will quickly decide who is qualified
and who is not, and those who arc not
qualified or abuse the freedom will
soon be pushed out of the picture.
What became apparent early in
the conversation, however, is that
what really captivates Wales is the
possibility of realizing his dream of
Wikia Search — a highly publicized,
open-source competitor to the
Google search engine. For all its
seeming dominance in every front of
the quickly evolving Internet, the
huge success of Google is fundamen
tally built upon the brilliance of its
highly guarded search engine algo
rithm — "much like the Coca Cola
recipe" — constantly tweaked by the
brightest computing minds in the Sil
icon Valley so searchers always get
the most relevant results.
