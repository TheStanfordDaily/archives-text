## Editorial Board Elegy for the CoHo 
### 
To borrow liberally from ee cummings:
Where did you go, little CoHo? The
Axe & Palm is certainly shiny and
new. but why did it have to replace the Cof
fee House? Last year, students were told
that the Axe & Palm would add to eating op
tions on campus, but swapping the cozy,
worn-in CoHo for the sterile Old Union
eatery doesn't equal a net gain.
Chief among the reasons cited that the
CoHo had to go is that it wouldn't have been
able to compete financially with the Axe &
Palm, but such a rationale misses the point:
students didn't go to the CoHo just to buy
food: they went to the CoHo to socialize in a
low-key environment. It wasn't a sweaty frat
party. It didn't feel like a corporate cafeteria.
It was a welcome change from a dorm. Per
haps most importantly, the CoHo was one of
the few places on campus that felt as though
it could have existed outside of Stanford
land, easily found on any street corner in any
city.
The Axe & Palm tries so hard to do
everything right.The lighting is conducive to
reading. The food is reasonably priced.
There are a variety of booths and nooks for
group meetings. But the place just doesn't
have soul. The Col lo's dingy lighting, beat
en-up couches and cheesy split-log tables
with moldy wildflowers trapped underneath

the lacquer may not have been glitzy, but it
sure felt like home.
The CoHo had a whole culture and set of
connotations surrounding it. Everyone
knew that if you agreed to meet someone at
the Col 10, it counted as a half-date. Campus
bands were nothing until they played on the
CoHo stage. If you planned to study with
your friends there.it was clear that a night of
gossiping and crepe-eating — and little ac
tual studying — was about to transpire.
While on the subject of crepe-eating, root
beer floats,onion rings and breakfast served
all day are all well and good, but CoHo
crepes were an institution. Granted, they
were only introduced in 2005, but their pop
ularity is unquestionable. They were differ
ent. They were delicious. ITiey came in sa
vory or sweet.
What will happen to the space aban
doned by the Col lo's closing? There are ru
mors that the location will be rented out to
the highest bidder. 11 this is true, national
corporations will have the financial advan
tage. Such a conversion would be a disaster,
though in line with campus precedent. See:
Jamba Juice. Subway, FedEx-Kinko's and
Peet's Coffee & Tea.
Usinu the Tresidder dining area as a case

in point, spaces on campus don't
have to be thoughtfully planned or
particularly unique to be utilized.
Just as students flock to Peet sand
Subway,they are almost ascertain to
buy food from the Axe & Palm and
to make use of whatever services are
ultimately offered in the CoHo's
footprint. The sad truth of the mat
ter is that the Stanford Bubble
chains students to on-campus re
sources — irregardless of their
quality.
While the CoHo had a vibrant
and dynamic tradition, its quiet clos
ing all but ensures that the memory
of the place will fade as its former
customers graduate. The class of
2011 and its successors will likely
learn to love the Axe & Palm — in
deed, the freshmen have actively ex
hibited little dissatisfaction with the
new Old Union. But. just as alumni
this weekend will visit Jerry and wax
nostalgic about the good old days of
Lambda Nu or walk up the stairs to
Tresiddcr and remember the OSA
sponsored keggers of their youth,
those who remember the CoHo will
trulv miss it.
