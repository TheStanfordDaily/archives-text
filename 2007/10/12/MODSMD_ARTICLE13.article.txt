# Burning Down the House
## Festive eggplant and democracy

It's a long few years between 16 and 20.
Have you looked at a freshman lately?
It's enough to make a senior feel like
Prufrock. 1 grow old, 1 grow old. 1 shall wear
the bottoms of my trousers rolled. (Feeling
geriatric? Spell "T.S. Eliot" backward. So
close.) But it's not hard to imagine how
those few years between snotty teenybop
per and relatively competent college stu
dent look tiny from far away.
I lere's where I'm taking this: the Axe and
Palm is miserable. Anything about the place
— the not-clever-enough-by-half name, the
boring food, the uncomfortably gigantic im
ages of wholesome students — will serve as
an apt metaphor for the relentless flattening
of Stanford from quirky and three-dimen
sional to generic and corporate.
I've heard that it made business sense,
that the consultants handling our affairs as
sured the administration that we could not
support both the CoMo and the Axe and
Palm. I'd have liked a chance to show other
wise, but that's not the point.The point is: if
we have to choose between the two. why not
let us choose between the two?
Now we're at the heart of the problem, of
which the shitty bagels at the Axe and Palm
are only the latest manifestation. We don't
get to choose. The university is, as President
Hennessy memorably chided us last year,
not a democracy.The harsh truth is that con
cerns of students, both about our own
(largely) private affairs, like parties and din
inn. and about broader ones like, say. labor

policy, just don't matter that much. Ilie
ASSIJ can resolve away, but in the end. it's
only there to buy our apathy with its gigan
tic budget. And nobody seems to have re
sponded to President I lennessy's admoni
tion with a simple "Why not?"
If we believe, as I do. that democracy is
both the best and fairest system by which
people can agree upon terms for living to
gether, then I have a pretty hard time under
standing why this should be less true for a
university. In fact. Stanford seems like the
most fertile ground imaginable for a democ
racy. We are thoughtful and engaged. And
we all have high-speed internet connections
for answering questions like, "Would you
prefer the CoHo or a new place in Old
Union?"
I'm not saying the concerns of under
graduates should be the only ones that mat
ter. I recognize that we aren't equipped to
manage everything. Members of the Board
probably know their way around Stanford's
finances better than 1 could hope to. But I
