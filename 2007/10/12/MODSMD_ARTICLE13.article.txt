# Burning Down the House
## Festive eggplant and democracy 
### 
It's a long few years between 16 and 20.
Have you looked at a freshman lately?
It's enough to make a senior feel like
Prufrock. 1 grow old, 1 grow old. 1 shall wear
the bottoms of my trousers rolled. (Feeling
geriatric? Spell "T.S. Eliot" backward. So
close.) But it's not hard to imagine how
those few years between snotty teenybop
per and relatively competent college stu
dent look tiny from far away.
I lere's where I'm taking this: the Axe and
Palm is miserable. Anything about the place
— the not-clever-enough-by-half name, the
boring food, the uncomfortably gigantic im
ages of wholesome students — will serve as
an apt metaphor for the relentless flattening
of Stanford from quirky and three-dimen
sional to generic and corporate.
I've heard that it made business sense,
that the consultants handling our affairs as
sured the administration that we could not
support both the CoMo and the Axe and
Palm. I'd have liked a chance to show other
wise, but that's not the point.The point is: if
we have to choose between the two. why not
let us choose between the two?
Now we're at the heart of the problem, of
which the shitty bagels at the Axe and Palm
are only the latest manifestation. We don't
get to choose. The university is, as President
Hennessy memorably chided us last year,
not a democracy.The harsh truth is that con
cerns of students, both about our own
(largely) private affairs, like parties and din
inn. and about broader ones like, say. labor

policy, just don't matter that much. Ilie
ASSIJ can resolve away, but in the end. it's
only there to buy our apathy with its gigan
tic budget. And nobody seems to have re
sponded to President I lennessy's admoni
tion with a simple "Why not?"
If we believe, as I do. that democracy is
both the best and fairest system by which
people can agree upon terms for living to
gether, then I have a pretty hard time under
standing why this should be less true for a
university. In fact. Stanford seems like the
most fertile ground imaginable for a democ
racy. We are thoughtful and engaged. And
we all have high-speed internet connections
for answering questions like, "Would you
prefer the CoHo or a new place in Old
Union?"
I'm not saying the concerns of under
graduates should be the only ones that mat
ter. I recognize that we aren't equipped to
manage everything. Members of the Board
probably know their way around Stanford's
finances better than 1 could hope to. But I


Gabe
Winant
would appreciate it if we could have
a say in those affairs that concern us
most directly and at least some voice
in the overall direction of the uni
versity. For instance, John Hen
nessy's job could come up for elec
tion every so often. I d be willing to
let I lelen Bing have a lot more votes
than me. I met her once, and she was
nothing but delightful. On top of
which — though 1 haven't dared
admit it in the several letters I've
written her — she has the most ex
traordinary hair of any woman in
the world her age. That being said, I

would still like a vote.

There's only one argument I've
been able to come up with for why
we should stay undemocratic. It's
that we aren't competent enough to
govern ourselves and help guide the
university, that we're still those brat
tv teenagers (because, after all. there
are only four years between 16 and
20).
1 live in Kairos, a co-op. Here's a
recent, standard dinner menu: but
ternut-squash ravioli, baked festive
eggplant (festive?), seared tuna in
chimichurri sauce, and spinach salad.
Dessert was baked pears. Afterward,
the kitchen gleamed, as did the bath
rooms and common areas, all
cleaned by those whose turn it was to
clean them.
I don't know how one would

make a chimichurri sauce, if it's easy
or hard or what goes into it that
makes it green and spicy. But I could
look it up. and I could probably fig
ure it out. For that matter, I didn't
know how to clean a bathroom or a
kitchen either until I learned. Now I
do it regularly and get a nice glow of
self-righteous civic pride every
time. These strikes me as the ele
ments of good democratic citizen
ship exactly.
Last week, we had a party. The
traditional name of this event is
"Wine and Cheese," now ruled out
by its implicit alcohol endorsement.
So the house wanted to call it
"Cheese." Apparently, this did not
fly with the OSA, because it doesn't
sound enough like the name of a
party.
I understand that part of being an
administrator is hating jokes. But the
fact that many students have a sense
of humor ought not to diminish the
fact that many could also, when
called upon, produce a chimichurri
sauce, and, as the success of the co
ops suggests, many other things re
quiring planning and care.

cuisine and good citizenship? Email

"Wine and Cheese," now ruled out
by its implicit alcohol endorsement.
So the house wanted to call it
"Cheese." Apparently, this did not
fly with the OSA, because it doesn't
sound enough like the name of a
party.
I understand that part of being an
administrator is hating jokes. But the
fact that many students have a sense
of humor ought not to diminish the
fact that many could also, when
called upon, produce a chimichurri
sauce, and, as the success of the co
ops suggests, many other things re
quiring planning and care.

Think there's a difference between fine
cuisine and good citizenship? Email
