# Oddities & Katie-o-Syncrasies
## Fair-weather fans 
### 
I swear you wouldn't have recognized the
Stanford campus last Saturday night.
Post-unimaginable-USC win. the Spirit of
Football Games I'ast visited Leland Mc-
Scrooge. The busloads of triumphant foot
ball-playing kings were met by hundreds of
screaming fans. There was a rollicking, im
promptu bonfire. "All Right Now" poured
from dorm rooms across campus and cars
honked anywhere and everywhere, all for the
pure and joyous reason of communal cele
bration.
Everyone rallied. Spirits ascended to new
heights. Stanford quivered with enthusiasm.
On Sunday, a huge sign in White Plaza of
stitched-together sheets wished the team
good luck on their upcoming game against
Texas Christian. A USC flag flew upside
down nearby. Sigma Nu spray-painted
Coach Jim Harbaugh's wonderfully feisty
quotation,"We bow to no man. We bow to no
program at Stanford University," and hung it
from their balcony.
Stanford football fans have crawled out of
the woodwork.The most unlikely, timid girls

are spouting stats. Suddenly, we live and
breathe football — you'd think we were
USC.
I hate to admit it. but I think we are a cam
pus of fair weather fans.
Hiin k back, say, a week ago. We bitterly
complained how Stanford lost way more
than it won. When the topic of football mean
dered into a conversation with a relative or
friend — who inevitably happened to be at
tending a large Midwestern football-ga-ga
state school — 1 found myself reenacting an
I-know-we-suck routine: I rolled my eyes at
the mention of football and repeated a long,
disappointed, "oh my God," followed by "I
know, we are sooo bad." I could only hope

they would take pity on me and stop talking
about upcoming QBs and redshirt sopho
mores so I could then steer the rest of the
conversation into the ego-boosting realms of
Princeton Review Top Colleges Rankings,
burgeoning endowments and plentiful on
campus housing.
Then Davis beat us, and we sank to new
lows of football embarrassment.
Our team was the joke in the Pac-10, and
we've been taking it personally for years.
Athletics is a face of the school, and as over
working overachievers, we want our high
profile school to have an equally overachiev
ing. bone-crushing-good football team.
Or at least an okay one.
We're like fickle parents. We want our
football kids to do well. The football team is
implausibly provided for (from their own
athletic trust fund of sorts). They have a
ridiculously large budget, scholarships, free
gear, a taste of stardom, and a complimenta-

ry golf cart when they are injured.
Yet despite being provided with all
possible resources, we can't control
the season's outcome. We appreciate
the football players, but we are busy
people. We have other things to do.
We turn our sights on football's
shining little brother: basketball.
And yet now I'm tempted to pre
order the seemingly instantaneous
ly-created football shirt that reads,
"Stanford Football. Biggest Upset
Ever," on the front and "Stanford 24,
#1 USC 23—October 6. 2007, L.A.
Coliseum," on the back. I've bought
my tickets for tomorrow's home
coming game and broke out my "I
Believe" button from last year's Big
Game.
It's an undeniable truth: 1 only
support the team when we're doing
well. Games are more fun to watch
when there is a possibility of win
ning. Sports is entertainment, and
watching top-ranked teams crush
ours isn't that entertaining — it's
why God made Divisions. I don't go
see movies that I know will be bad,
so why spend my ever-precious time
watching fumbled plays interspersed
with too-long timeouts?

Knowing our not-so-good team
will get beaten by a group of future
NFL players doesn't rev my engine,
frost my cake, tickle my athletic
fancy. At the very least 1 want to see
a good fight.
Student football tickets were free
this year, for god's sake. Apparently
the folks down in marketing are fair
weather friends as well.
We fans on the Farm are so excit
ed about The Victor)' because a) un
derdog wins — like free food, hear
ing your favorite song on the radio
and any Valentine's Day gift — are
the best thing in the world and b)
we've been nursing a ragingly colos
sal Napoleon complex about our
football team, a complex which has
finally (or at least temporarily) been
laid to rest.
That's got to be worth a shirt.
So Jim, well done.Tavita, you got
an arm of a god (and a Matt Damon
smile to boot.) We're proud of you,
son. But don't get down on yourself
when school spirit wanes and atten
dance ebbs. The game of a lifetime
will unavoidably be followed by a
lifetime of lesser games. Know that
fame is fickle and, as much as we all
might try to deny it, so are your
fans.

Saturday, email Katie at kttaylor@
