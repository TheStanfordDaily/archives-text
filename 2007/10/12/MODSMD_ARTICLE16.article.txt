## Fair-weather fans

I swear you wouldn't have recognized the
Stanford campus last Saturday night.
Post-unimaginable-USC win. the Spirit of
Football Games I'ast visited Leland Mc-
Scrooge. The busloads of triumphant foot
ball-playing kings were met by hundreds of
screaming fans. There was a rollicking, im
promptu bonfire. "All Right Now" poured
from dorm rooms across campus and cars
honked anywhere and everywhere, all for the
pure and joyous reason of communal cele
bration.
Everyone rallied. Spirits ascended to new
heights. Stanford quivered with enthusiasm.
On Sunday, a huge sign in White Plaza of
stitched-together sheets wished the team
good luck on their upcoming game against
Texas Christian. A USC flag flew upside
down nearby. Sigma Nu spray-painted
Coach Jim Harbaugh's wonderfully feisty
quotation,"We bow to no man. We bow to no
program at Stanford University," and hung it
from their balcony.
Stanford football fans have crawled out of
the woodwork.The most unlikely, timid girls

are spouting stats. Suddenly, we live and
breathe football — you'd think we were
USC.
I hate to admit it. but I think we are a cam
pus of fair weather fans.
Hiin k back, say, a week ago. We bitterly
complained how Stanford lost way more
than it won. When the topic of football mean

state school — 1 found myself reenacting an
I-know-we-suck routine: I rolled my eyes at
the mention of football and repeated a long,
disappointed, "oh my God," followed by "I
know, we are sooo bad." I could only hope

they would take pity on me and stop talking
about upcoming QBs and redshirt sopho
mores so I could then steer the rest of the
conversation into the ego-boosting realms of
Princeton Review Top Colleges Rankings,
burgeoning endowments and plentiful on
campus housing.
Then Davis beat us, and we sank to new
lows of football embarrassment.
Our team was the joke in the Pac-10, and
we've been taking it personally for years.
Athletics is a face of the school, and as over
working overachievers, we want our high
profile school to have an equally overachiev
ing. bone-crushing-good football team.
Or at least an okay one.
We're like fickle parents. We want our
football kids to do well. The football team is
implausibly provided for (from their own
athletic trust fund of sorts). They have a
ridiculously large budget, scholarships, free
gear, a taste of stardom, and a complimenta-
