## A 						society for trendsetting longboard riders 
### 
Allow me to call to order the 10th an
nual meeting of The Society for Men
Who Ride on Longhoards While
Wearing Sunglasses and Talking on a Cell
Phone. ITiis year. Stanford University has
graciously provided the venue for our con
ference: the grassy knoll outside of Kresge
Auditorium and a kickoff event (to follow
this meeting): the 10:00-10:50 timeslot of In
troductory Economics IA.
Let me start by saying that there has never
been a greater year to be a man who rides on
a longboard while wearing sunglasses and
talking on a cell phone. At Stanford alone,
membership in our prestigious society has
risen 4(KX)% since last year. I would like to
thank "T-Rock" in our advertising division
for his ingenious plan to increase member
ship by calling other people who happen to
be on longboards but not yet using a cell
phone.

There was a time, however, when they
said we couldn't do it. When our organization
first tried to get off the ground, in 1873. we
were shot down in favor of The Consortium
of Body-Building Men Who Ride on Comi
cally Oversized, Three-Wheeled Bicycles
with A Disproportionately Larger Front
Wheel.
We lay in quiet rest for nearly a century as
this other society swelled in size, only to fall
to The Collective for Flower Children with
Peace Sign-Shaped Necklaces and Largely
Unwashed Hair, and later The Awesome

Gang of Bad Dudes Who Wear Rollerblades
Complimented with Rainbow Sweaters and
Walkmen.
Yes, ours has been a history of defeat, of
always coming in second. But this year,
thanks in part to our Hollister-based recruit
ing tactics, the SFMWRLWWSATOACP has
come out on top.
It is time for us to realize the lofty goals
laid out in our mission statement, penned so
long ago by our founder Tad McFaddington:
" To inspire the youth of tomorrow to cele
brate generic and meaningless trends; to pre
tend to surf and skateboard and then go out
and get really high and forget about it later
on a tri-weekly basis;and to...ah.man...l'm so
gone right now."
And I think this says something about us
as a people. We are trendvcr/crv, not trend fol-

lowers. We are visionaries, revolu
tionaries, and anything hut pre
tenders. As we ride down Escondido,
our designer sunglasses glinting in
the evening sun. the wheels on our
longboards rolling in a plain and
uninspiring fashion, we are the top
dogs at Stanford.
We are a diverse family, to be
sure, we men who ride on longboards
while wearing sunglasses and talking
on a cell phone.There arc those of us

who have iPhones, and those of us
who have Blackberries. There are
those among us who are White, and
those among us who are White.
There are those among us from Nor
cal. and those among us from fester
ing piles of coagulating goo fabricat
ed in a laboratory setting. But we
have one thing in common: our
shared love of pretentious ostenta
tion.
And it is for this reason that I ask
you all to raise into the air your
tropical fruit-flavored vodka
chillers, and exclaim, with one voice,
with one song, "We and our ilk are
the kings of the surf guitar and
sloshball and gloriously unkempt

hair and stuff."
1 must be exiting the podium now,
to pass the torch over to our DJ,
Jazzy Jeff 11, but I leave you tonight
with the great words of one of our
finest and most representative mem
bers. a man whom I saw today riding
past Mem Aud and uttering pro
foundly into hisiPhone:"Dude, I just
totally pulled a wicked spill a minute
ago. but it's alright, brah."

Nat wishes to apologize to the mem
bers of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity
for any offense he may have caused
them or their doppelganger ilk. Email
complaints to nat.hillard@stanford.
