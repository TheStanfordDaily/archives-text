Column on Hoover Institution full of errors
To the Editor:
kai Stinchcombe's column yesterday attacking
the Hoover Institution ["Rumsfeld and other
Hoover Institution kooks"] is so riddled with er
rors and fallacies that one wonders if it's satirical.
That we can't tell is a testament to its analytical
bankruptcy.
First, Dinesh D'Souza is not a Hoover fellow
anymore, likely as fall-out over the book Stinch
combe assails. Stinchcombe, who clearly didn't
read the book, fails to mention that among D'-
Souza's most cogent critics were Hoover fellows,
including Peter Berkowitz and Victor Davis
Hanson.
Second, Laura Ingraham is not a Hoover fel
low. She was a short-term media fellow for a sin
gle week in March 20()3. Hoover brings in dozens
of journalists from all across the political spec
trum each year to spend a week in residence.They
include people like Walter Pincus from the Wash
ington Post and Michael Isikoff from Newsweek.
Third, Stinchcombe does an enormous disserv
ice to Thomas Gale Moore by labeling him a
"kook" for his skepticism on climate change
alarmism. Moore also is a vociferous critic of the
Bush administration and the war in Iraq, but
pointing that out might: a) require research, and
b) confirm that Hoover is a bastion of academic
freedom and the free exchange of ideas.
Fourth. Stinchcombe employs a classic straw

man attack on Charles ilill for his critique of the
Roosevelt Institution, which Stinchcombe helped
found. By unfairly blasting a man who has done
more for his country than most of us ever will.
Stinchcombe illustrates the fundamental problem
with the kind of student activism Roosevelt repre
sents: there is no humility, only arrogance.

"Bailout" headline mischaracterizes SNRP
While I appreciated Daily coverage of the
Stanford News Readership Program (SNRP). 1
feel this article ("Bailout keeps Times, Merc in
dining halls," Oct. 9) lacked important details.
In interviewing me, the reporter specifically
asked. "Is there a precedent for the University
bailing out student groups who don't get enough
votes for ASSU funding?" My response was that
the phrase "bailing out" is misleading. 1 dislike
this term because it suggests the SNRP did not
win a majority of undergraduate votes and that,
by helping support the program, the Provost's of
fice was giving funding to a group that undergrad
uates did not adequately support. In reality, we
had more than enough support from undergradu
ates, it was just the unexpectedly high negative re
sponse from graduate students that pulled us
under (since we had applied as a joint special fees
group).
IT>e reason our program is still alive is not just
because the Provost's office values it; that would

he insufficient.The Provost made it very clear that
the office almost always turns away funding re
quests like these and was only making an excep
tion in our case because we had actually won a ma
jority of votes from undergraduates.
The Daily article mentioned that the under
graduate percentage for "yes" votes was 67.57%,
but 1 do not think enough emphasis was placed on
this fact. For instance. K7.SU won Special Fees
funding, yet only obtained 62.69% of the under
graduate vote in the election. Because we had sub
stantial undergraduate support in the election, the
Provost agreed to help us. and we now are serving
only undergraduates (from whom we won a ma
jority vote). But even with support, this kind of
help is on a one-time-only, emergency funding
basis. The future of the SNRP depends on its suc
cess in Special Fees elections this year.'
I hope this clears up misunderstandings of this
admittedly complex situation. For now. New York
Times and San Jose Mercury papers are distrib
uted Monday to Friday at Gates Computer Sci
ence Building. Building 260 and dining halls at
Wilbur, Stern, Ricker, Lagunita and Flo Mo. The
old distribution sites at the CoHo and Music
Building are currently in transition and will prob
ably be relocated to the White Plaza or New Stu
dent Union area.
Please enjoy the free papers, and we'll hope for
your support in keeping the program alive next
election cycle.
