## Men hit road for first time 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
The comforts of home will be ab
sent for the Stanford men's soccer
team this weekend as the squad
leaves the Bay Area for the first time
this season.The Cardinal (4-2-4.1-0-1
Pacific-10) hits the road to take on
UCLA today and San Diego State on
Sunday.
Coach Bret Simon expects the
away matches against tough oppo
nents to present new tests for his
team.
"The games on the road will add
another element for us," Simon said.
"We're excited to travel together for
our first long road trip. Both UCLA
and San Diego State are excellent
teams with strong individual players.
So this will be an exciting challenge
for us."
Senior defender Scott Bolkan
agrees that the road games will lend a
change of pace after Stanford's near
month-long homestead.
"It's always tough to play on the
road," Bolkan said. "With some
things, there's no real way to prepare
— the crowd's harsher, the turf is dif
ferent. and since only 20 players can
travel, we miss the support of all our
teammates on the sideline. At the
same time, playing on the road gives
us a break from the academic and so
cial environment at school and we can
focus on playing soccer."
The first stop for the Cardinal is at
7 p.m. tonight in Los Angeles where
the Bruins (4-5-1,0-1-0 Pac-10) await

Stanford armed with leading scorer
Maxwell Griffin, who has notched
four goals so far this season.
Whereas UCLA is coming off a 1-
0 loss to San Diego State on Oct. 6, the
Cardinal has been undefeated in its
last five matches (3-0-2); Bolkan
hopes that the lessons from this posi
tive streak will give Stanford the nec
essary confidence and momentum to
be successful in the future.
"This past weekend was definitely
a big building block for us as we get
into our Pac-10 campaign," Bolkan
said. "Against [Oregon State Univer
sity] we saw how we could score goals
and finish a team off strong, and
against Washington our defense per
formed very well and shut out one of
the nation's best attacking teams."
The Cardinal met the Bruins twice
last year, with both matchups ending
in 1-1 double-overtime ties. But those
results will have little bearing on the
competition tonight. Stanford plans to
focus on Griffin and fellow offensive
threats, such as senior Mike Zaher,
who has scored two goals, without los
ing sight of its own style of play.
" I"here are certainly some clever
and dangerous players we have to be
aware of when facing these teams,"
Bolkan said."UCLA in particular has
a lot of skillful players that we want to
be prepared for. But it's nothing that
will radically change the way we play
as a team. 1 think we are very confi
dent in our ability to beat any team we
play, and we don't need to change our
strategy to accommodate for another
team or single player."

GAME NOTtS: This weekend's matches mark
the first time the Cardinal has played on the
road in nearly a month. Stanford comes into
the match unbeaten in its last five games.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will take on San
Diego State.

From L.A.,the Cardinal will move
on toSDSU (5-2-2,1-0-0 Pac-10) for a
2 p.m. match on Sunday. Offensively,
the Aztecs are led by redshirt sopho
more Jamel Wallace, who has three
goals this year. Wallace is closely
trailed by Kraig Chiles. Nick Carde
nas, and Khadim Diouf.each of whom
has contributed two goals on the year.
Bolkan said that the Stanford de
fense has been preparing to face the
Aztecs' deep offensive lineup
throughout the week.
"When we look at teams like [this],
we tend to focus on their offensive
threats," he said. "Unless, of course, a
goalie has some sort of tendencies we

think we can exploit."
In the case of the Aztecs, that is un
likely. Sunday's greatest threat will
probably be redshirt freshman goalie
Brad Byrns, who has already posted
five shutouts and 29 saves this year.
He tops Stanford's own senior An
drew Kartunen in both categories.

Regardless, the key to a win for
Stanford in both games will come
from the front: goal scoring, plain and
simple. While the Cardinal has strug
gled with this throughout the season,
the OSU game offered a glimmer of
hope for what could be, especially in
the first half when Stanford racked up

eight shots for one goal, going on to
win 4-0.
The only question that remains is
whether Stanford can sustain its im
provement after taking to the road.

goalie has some sort of tendencies we

think we can exploit."
In the case of the Aztecs, that is un
likely. Sunday's greatest threat will
probably be redshirt freshman goalie
Brad Byrns, who has already posted
five shutouts and 29 saves this year.
He tops Stanford's own senior An
drew Kartunen in both categories.

Regardless, the key to a win for
Stanford in both games will come
from the front: goal scoring, plain and
simple. While the Cardinal has strug
gled with this throughout the season,
the OSU game offered a glimmer of
hope for what could be, especially in
the first half when Stanford racked up

eight shots for one goal, going on to
win 4-0.
The only question that remains is
whether Stanford can sustain its im
provement after taking to the road.
