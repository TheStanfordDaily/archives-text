# Men's polo ready for round one at Irvine
## No. 3 Card to face Princeton at SoCal Invitational 
### KENAN JIANG 
No. 3 Stanford will travel to UC-lrvine
for the two-day, 16-team SoCal Invitation
al tournament this weekend.The Cardinal
will open up against Princeton at the
Anteater Aquatic Complex today at 10:40
am.
Despite a spirited effort, the Cardinal
dropped contests against USC last week
end and suffered their first Mountain Pa
cific (MPSF) conference loss, leaving its
conference record at 1-1.
The Cardinal has been hard at work
eliminating small mistakes during practice
and emphasizing fundamentals. Much of
the game plan comes down to the execu
tion and level-headed play that coach John
Vargas preaches.
"We need to play smart and limit mis
takes; that's how we win games," senior
goalkeeper .Sandy llohener said. "Then
we can be opportunistic and execute when
we get scoring opportunities. So [we] play
really smart and try not to do what is not in
our game plan."
When asked about the talent level of
the team, senior Peter Finlayson felt confi

dent that the squad's NCAA title hopes
were definitely achievable.
"I feel that the talent is definitely
there," Finlayson said. "We're a relatively
young team and a lot of guys, especially
sophomores, got a lot of experience added
to their skill level. Freshmen are doing a
great job playing this year.The team is bet
ter. if not better than other years I've been
[at Stanford]."
The SoCal tournament is usually a
good indicator of the level of progress the
Cardinal has made by the middle of the
season. This will be the first time Stanford
faces Princeton this season. Ihe winner
will advance to the second bracket,playing
the winner of the UC San Diego-UC
Irvine contest at 5:20 pm on Saturday.
"We definitely need to stop making
small mistakes and focus on playing as a
team down the stretch." sophomore utility
Drac Wigo said. "Coach [Vargas] empha
sizes teamwork during practice and so we
just need to execute."
All of the nation's top teams will com
pete at the SoCal tournament, including
Stanford's biggest rivals: No. 1 USC, No. 2
C'al and No. 31JCLA.With NCAA Cham
pionships approaching on Nov. 25, Stan
ford must make use of every opportunity it
has to compete and gain experience
against teams it may face down the road.
