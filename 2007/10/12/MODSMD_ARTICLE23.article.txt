The Stanford men's tennis team
opens play today at the ITA North
west Regional Championships in
Seattle, Wash.
Last week at the ITA All-Ameri
can Championships, freshman Alex
Clayton put forth a strong showing in
his run to the quarterfinals.This week,
the Cardinal will be represented in
the singles and doubles brackets as
plenty of athletes hope to make their
own statements on the court for the
Cardinal.
"This tournament is not anything
huge," coach John Whitlinger said.
"We had Matt [Bruch], Alex [Clay
ton], Blake [Muller] and Richard
[Wire] play last weekend, and now
this weekend we get to see the other
guys in action."
Freshmen Greg Hirshman andTed
Kelly, sophomores Wire and Kevin
Kaiser, and juniors Jeff Zeller and
Muller will be playing this weekend.
Muller and Kelly are the top seed in
the doubles bracket and Wire and
Hirshman will be the No. 5 seed, with
Kaiser and Zeller also teaming up.
"I'm looking forward to this tour
nament, singles and doubles," Wire
said. "I think 1 have a chance to go far
[in singles], I'm playing with Hirsh
man in doubles. I think our games
work well together."
In singles. Wire is the No. 2 seed
while Muller is the No. 9 seed. Both
had opening round losses last week
end and both are prepared to bounce
back this weekend.
"This is just a pruning for our guys,
more than anything," Whitlinger said.
"It's a time for match experience. 1
hope we can get winners in singles
and doubles, but I'm just looking for
everyone to play well."
