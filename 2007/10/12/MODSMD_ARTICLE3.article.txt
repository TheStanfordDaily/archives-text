# GOING FOR TWO
## Card gunning for first win-streak since '05 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
If there is one sentiment that has been
repeated most often by Stanford
coaches and players this week, it is the
hope that this is just the beginning.
At 2-3. the Cardinal can climb back to
.500 with a 1 lomecoming win this Saturday
against TCU. A win could help propel the
Cardinal towards its first bowl game berth
since 2001. as Stanford would be halfway to
the six win minimum with half of its sched
ule left to play.
For the Cardinal, the challenge will be
one the team has not faced in some time —
remaining focused on this week's opponent
after a huge win the previous Saturday. In
some ways, the I lorned Frogs of TCU (3-3)
face a simpler psychological hurdle as they
look to rebound following a 27-24 loss at
Wyoming last week.
"Now we're in uncharted waters be
cause we're dealing with success," Stanford
coach Jim Harbaugh said. "And we haven't
always had that here. Dealing with that,
dealing with success — dealing with it with
humility, with pride and with great work
ethic — and learning how to deal with suc
cess will be a big challenge for us going for
ward."
The Cardinal offense will be led for the
second straight week by quarterback Tavi
ta Pritchard. The redshirt freshman per

against Southern California, leading Stan-
