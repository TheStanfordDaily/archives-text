# GOING FOR TWO
## Card gunning for first win-streak since '05 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
If there is one sentiment that has been
repeated most often by Stanford
coaches and players this week, it is the
hope that this is just the beginning.
At 2-3. the Cardinal can climb back to
.500 with a 1 lomecoming win this Saturday
against TCU. A win could help propel the
Cardinal towards its first bowl game berth
since 2001. as Stanford would be halfway to
the six win minimum with half of its sched
ule left to play.
For the Cardinal, the challenge will be
one the team has not faced in some time —
remaining focused on this week's opponent
after a huge win the previous Saturday. In
some ways, the I lorned Frogs of TCU (3-3)
face a simpler psychological hurdle as they
look to rebound following a 27-24 loss at
Wyoming last week.
"Now we're in uncharted waters be
cause we're dealing with success," Stanford
coach Jim Harbaugh said. "And we haven't
always had that here. Dealing with that,
dealing with success — dealing with it with
humility, with pride and with great work
ethic — and learning how to deal with suc
cess will be a big challenge for us going for
ward."
The Cardinal offense will be led for the
second straight week by quarterback Tavi
ta Pritchard. The redshirt freshman per
formed heroically in the fourth quarter
against Southern California, leading Stan-

NOTES: After pulling off one of the greatest wins in the
program's history las* week at USC, the Cardinal will
look to build further momentum tomorrow against the
Horned Frogs. The Frogs feature an athletic defense to
go with their spread offense and were a popular pre
season 'sitepei' ieaif.. Sat with three losses on the
season already (at Texas, at Air Force and at
Wyoming) TCU's preseason hopes for a BCS Bowl
berth have effectively been dashed The Cardinal will
be looking to string together their first winning streak
since October of 2005. The Homed Frogs are winless
on the road this season.

Pritchard will get his second start
tomorrow against the Horned
Frogs, who boast an athletic,
tenacious defense. Pritchard led
the Cardinal to 1 7 fourth quarter
points against USC.
ford to a stunning 24-23 comeback
victory. The Tacoma, Wash, native
sealed the win over the then-No. 2
Trojans with a last-minute touch
down pass to senior wide receiver
Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal
from the 10-yard line.
As Harbaugh explained,
Pritchard will play tomorrow de
spite the availability of former start
ing quarterback senior T.C. Ostran
der — who suffered a seizure on
Sept. 30 that kept him out of the
USC game — as a result of his spec
tacular play in crunch time.
"Three drives in the last three
possessions for scores [against
USC] was very impressive and so
was the way he handled himself
around this ball club," Harbaugh
told GoStanford.com. "1 feel good
about that decision."
Senior wide receiver Evan
Moore praised Pritchard's ability
to stay calm and focused in the
clutch against the Trojans.
"That's what 1 love about Tavi
ta."he said."ln the fourth quarter he
had the same [attitude] he had all
week during practice. 1 was wonder
ing if he was going to bring it. be
cause it was his first real Pac-10 ac
tion. And he had it even in the
fourth quarter during crunch time.
He just kept looking at his receivers
in the huddle saying, 'I'm telling
you, one of you guys is going to
make a play that's going to win this
thing. 1 promise you it's going to
happen.'
"And then next thing you know,
there's like 40 seconds left and he's
throwing it up to Mark [Bradford],
and Mark pulls it down for a touch
down," Moore went on. "SoTavita,
man, he's shown something."
Still, Harbaugh was quick to em
phasize the athleticism ofTCU's de
fense, particularly strong side line
backer David Hawthorne and de
fensive ends Chase Ortiz and Matt
Panfil. Even without Preseason Ail-
American defensive end Tommy
Blake, the Horned Frogs have had
plenty of success rushing the passer,
sacking the opposing quarterback
13 times in their last four games.
Stanford's coach was quick to
emphasize that defeating the sec
ond-ranked team in the country
wouldn't win the Cardinal any
points against TCU.
"TCU does not care that we
beat USC," Harbaugh said at Tues
day's press conference. "They're
devising ways to come in here and
beat us. So as much as I'd love to
talk about the Stanford-USC game
for the next five hours, we really
don't have that luxury."
Still, in one respect, the Cardi
nal's monumental upset of the Tro
jans could positively affect Satur
day's contest against the Horned
Frogs. According to Thursday's San
Francisco Chronicle, Stanford has
seen a "surge" in recent ticket sales,
with sales for this weekend's
Homecoming contest approaching
40,000.
As Moore noted, that is certain
ly one trend the Cardinal hopes to
build on.
"We're not trying to make this
thing look like it was a one stop
thing," he said."lt's a big thing to be
coming home, [and] I'm sure we'll
have some more fans. 1 don't know

how many more but I'm sure there
will be some more out there. But
this is a big opportunity for us and
we cannot disappoint this week
end. This is big."
INJURY UPDATE
Among key contributors who
did not play against the Trojans,
sophomore running back Toby
Gerhart is unlikely to return to ac
tion this week, while sophomore
defensive tackle Ekom Udofia is
expected back in the lineup against
the Horned Frogs.
GAME INFO
The Cardinal's fifth home con
test of the season is slated to kick
off at 2 p.m. Saturday and will be
broadcast by radio on both KNBR
1050 AM and KZSU 90.1 FM.This
will be the first ever meeting be
tween Stanford and TCU on the
gridiron, but not the last. Stanford
will travel next year to Fort Worth,
Texas for a rematch on Sept. 13,

throwing it up to Mark [Bradford],
and Mark pulls it down for a touch
down," Moore went on. "SoTavita,
man, he's shown something."
Still, Harbaugh was quick to em
phasize the athleticism ofTCU's de
fense, particularly strong side line
backer David Hawthorne and de
fensive ends Chase Ortiz and Matt
Panfil. Even without Preseason Ail-
American defensive end Tommy
Blake, the Horned Frogs have had
plenty of success rushing the passer,
sacking the opposing quarterback
13 times in their last four games.
Stanford's coach was quick to
emphasize that defeating the sec
ond-ranked team in the country
wouldn't win the Cardinal any
points against TCU.
"TCU does not care that we
beat USC," Harbaugh said at Tues
day's press conference. "They're
devising ways to come in here and
beat us. So as much as I'd love to
talk about the Stanford-USC game
for the next five hours, we really
don't have that luxury."
Still, in one respect, the Cardi
nal's monumental upset of the Tro
jans could positively affect Satur
day's contest against the Horned
Frogs. According to Thursday's San
Francisco Chronicle, Stanford has
seen a "surge" in recent ticket sales,
with sales for this weekend's
Homecoming contest approaching
40,000.
As Moore noted, that is certain
ly one trend the Cardinal hopes to
build on.
"We're not trying to make this
thing look like it was a one stop
thing," he said."lt's a big thing to be
coming home, [and] I'm sure we'll
have some more fans. 1 don't know

how many more but I'm sure there
will be some more out there. But
this is a big opportunity for us and
we cannot disappoint this week
end. This is big."
INJURY UPDATE

Gerhart is unlikely to return to ac
tion this week, while sophomore

If there is one sentiment that has been
repeated most often by Stanford
coaches and players this week, it is the
hope that this is just the beginning.
At 2-3. the Cardinal can climb back to
.500 with a 1 lomecoming win this Saturday
against TCU. A win could help propel the
Cardinal towards its first bowl game berth
since 2001. as Stanford would be halfway to
the six win minimum with half of its sched
ule left to play.
For the Cardinal, the challenge will be
one the team has not faced in some time —
remaining focused on this week's opponent
after a huge win the previous Saturday. In
some ways, the I lorned Frogs of TCU (3-3)
face a simpler psychological hurdle as they
look to rebound following a 27-24 loss at
Wyoming last week.
"Now we're in uncharted waters be
cause we're dealing with success," Stanford
coach Jim Harbaugh said. "And we haven't
always had that here. Dealing with that,
dealing with success — dealing with it with
humility, with pride and with great work
ethic — and learning how to deal with suc
cess will be a big challenge for us going for
ward."
The Cardinal offense will be led for the
second straight week by quarterback Tavi
ta Pritchard. The redshirt freshman per
formed heroically in the fourth quarter
against Southern California, leading Stan-

NOTES: After pulling off one of the greatest wins in the
program's history las* week at USC, the Cardinal will
look to build further momentum tomorrow against the
Horned Frogs. The Frogs feature an athletic defense to
go with their spread offense and were a popular pre
season 'sitepei' ieaif.. Sat with three losses on the
season already (at Texas, at Air Force and at
Wyoming) TCU's preseason hopes for a BCS Bowl
berth have effectively been dashed The Cardinal will
be looking to string together their first winning streak
since October of 2005. The Homed Frogs are winless
on the road this season.

Redshirt sophomore QB Tavita
Pritchard will get his second start
tomorrow against the Horned
Frogs, who boast an athletic,
tenacious defense. Pritchard led
the Cardinal to 1 7 fourth quarter
points against USC.
ford to a stunning 24-23 comeback
victory. The Tacoma, Wash, native
sealed the win over the then-No. 2
Trojans with a last-minute touch
down pass to senior wide receiver
Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal
from the 10-yard line.
As Harbaugh explained,
Pritchard will play tomorrow de
spite the availability of former start
ing quarterback senior T.C. Ostran
der — who suffered a seizure on
Sept. 30 that kept him out of the
USC game — as a result of his spec
tacular play in crunch time.
"Three drives in the last three
possessions for scores [against
USC] was very impressive and so
was the way he handled himself
around this ball club," Harbaugh
told GoStanford.com. "1 feel good
about that decision."
Senior wide receiver Evan
Moore praised Pritchard's ability
to stay calm and focused in the
clutch against the Trojans.
"That's what 1 love about Tavi
ta."he said."ln the fourth quarter he
had the same [attitude] he had all
week during practice. 1 was wonder
ing if he was going to bring it. be
cause it was his first real Pac-10 ac
tion. And he had it even in the
fourth quarter during crunch time.
He just kept looking at his receivers
in the huddle saying, 'I'm telling
you, one of you guys is going to
make a play that's going to win this
thing. 1 promise you it's going to
happen.'
"And then next thing you know,
there's like 40 seconds left and he's
throwing it up to Mark [Bradford],
