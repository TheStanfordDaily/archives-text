## Cohen and Glass satisfy longing 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION PATRON SAINT OF ENVY 
Leonard Cohen has described his new collaboration with
Philip Glass, "The Book of Longing," as being "like a bumble
bee: from what we know, it shouldn't fly." After all, the worlds
of popular and classical music have been steadily distancing
themselves from each other for the entire 20th century. And,
on the face of it, a partnership between the detachedly roman
tic Cohen and the insistently cerebral Glass is not an easy fit.
But fly the piece does — stunningly and movingly.
On Tuesday, Oct. 9, Stanford Lively Arts co-commissioned
the West Coast premiere of "Book of Longing," which was

performed at
Memorial Au
ditorium to a
packed audi
ence. "Book" is
difficult to clas
sify in tradition
al terms — it is,
in essence, a
chamber con
cert piece, with
a small instru
mental ensem
ble backing
four voices. The
performance,
however, in
cludes theatri
cal elements, as
well: the singers
enter and exit,
move and ges
ture, as do some
of the instru
mentalists, who
will occasionally
stand up and

take center stage, or turn their backs to the audience.
Leonard Cohen's book of the same name provides not only the

poems that constitute the libretto but also the sketches and line
drawings that are projected onto the stage's Zen-like black
and-white backdrop — solemnly unflattering self-portraits
and naive, sacred erotica changing with the music's shifting
mood.
Still, at the center of this work of art is Glass's superb intertwin
ing of text with music. It is an initially jarring experience to hear
Cohen's subtle humor and intensely personal musings belted
out as if in an opera house, or worse, on Broadway. Something
in Cohen's quiet irony seems lost in the vibrato and the hand
gestures of a classical vocalist, and this problem remains evi
dent in certain later passages.
But, generally, as the audience acclimates itself to the idea, the

music and poetry — and the
"classical" and the "popular"
— begin to seem inseparable.
The quiet "1-2-3-4" of the con
ductor — uncommon in the
classical tradition — the
melodic, almost catchy lyricism
of the vocal parts and Cohen's
celebrations of everyday sexu
ality meld seamlessly with
Glass's complex polyrhythms
and repetitious, constantly
modulating chord progres
sions, as well as Cohen's tragi
cally elegant turns of phrase.
Of the 150 or so poems in
Cohen's book. Glass has scored
22, arranging them in cycles.
Cohen's smoky chocolate
recorded voice, for instance,
opens "Book." speaking over a
ceremonial dirge (the excellent
"1 Can't Make the Hills") and
returns frequently to recite
short, often dryly humorous
poems unaccompanied by the

ensemble (a favorite being "You go your

way/ I'll go your way too").
The longer romantic poems Glass characterizes as the "bal

lads," ascribing to them beautiful, simple choral melodies over
his constantly shifting rhythms, also make frequent appear
ances, forming the slow crescendo that carries "Book" steadi
ly upwards. Standouts include the Lorca homage "The Night of
Santiago" and the climactic but sparsely arranged, "You Came
to Me This Morning."
Even more impressive musically are the periodic instrumental
solos Glass hands out like jazz breaks. Through these occasion
ally virtuosic (go, if only to see Timothy Fain's impassioned at
tack on the violin), dazzlingly constructed sections, swinging
between a Baroque cadenza and modern polytonality, run
clear motifs that repeatedly pop up elsewhere, as if Glass were
briefly revealing the bones of his work.
This is not to say the piece is utterly without flaw. As men
tioned before, the vocalists' interpretations are occasionally
frustrating. Oddly, the women (Dominique Plaisant and Tara
Hugo) often seem more effective as interpreters, perhaps be
cause their voices, unlike the men's, evoke no memories of
Cohen's.
Along similar lines, the depth of Cohen's style — his ability to
express simultaneous misery and serenity, or triumph and self
effacement — are sometimes drowned, not only in the operat
ic vocals, but in one of Glass's more heavy-handed passages.
"Puppet Time" and "How Much 1 Love You" — which uses
the somewhat cheesy touch of a Middle Eastern-sounding in
troduction in reference to Cohen's "Arabian Sea/ and its per
verse repetitions of white and grey" — both could have used
lighter touches. Still, these are the exceptions to the rule. Much
more common are triumphs of text-music interplay, like the
marvelously nuanced "Mother Mother'' or "The Light Came
Through the Window."
In an Aurora Forum the night before the performance, Glass
revealed that he had originally thought that "The Book of
Longing" was too beautiful. "1 don't know what course he
would have taken to correct that aberration," explained I
Cohen. Perhaps Glass was worried about "Book" being simply I
pretty —of not doing justice to the obscene sanctity of Cohen's I
work. But he doesn't need to. For two men who. for their en- I
tire lives, have been concerned with making art popular, and I
vice versa, "Book" is not, as Cohen puts it in his epilogue, I
"merely a song/ merely a prayer." Rather, it is a great step to- I
ward what these two men have been searching for.

lighter touches. Still, these are the exceptions to the rule. Much
more common are triumphs of text-music interplay, like the
marvelously nuanced "Mother Mother'' or "The Light Came
Through the Window."
In an Aurora Forum the night before the performance, Glass
revealed that he had originally thought that "The Book of
Longing" was too beautiful. "1 don't know what course he
would have taken to correct that aberration," explained I
Cohen. Perhaps Glass was worried about "Book" being simply I
pretty —of not doing justice to the obscene sanctity of Cohen's I
work. But he doesn't need to. For two men who. for their en- I
tire lives, have been concerned with making art popular, and I
vice versa, "Book" is not, as Cohen puts it in his epilogue, I
"merely a song/ merely a prayer." Rather, it is a great step to- I
ward what these two men have been searching for.
