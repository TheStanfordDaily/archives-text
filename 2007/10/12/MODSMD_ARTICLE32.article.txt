## A 						few of his favorite things 
### JOANNA XU INTERMISSION METALLIC MUSE 
As children, we all had dreams or creat
ing something grand — perhaps digging a
hole at the beach to the other end of the
world or building a life-size castle out of
toothpicks — but few of us traversed the
creative path far enough to fulfill that vi
sion.

> Viewing the "Anxious Objects":
William Cole's Favorite Brands exhibition
at the Cantor Arts Center is like pedaling
backwards to a time when we. too. viewed
things not just as functional objects but as
building blocks at our disposal: yet Cole's
pieces on display also baffle us in terms of
the complex, creative use of everyday ob
jects to represent elaborate cultural sym
bols such as the mandala or African masks.

The pieces on
display at Cantor
represent closely
the variety of mate
rials used and sub
jects depicted in
Cole's sculptures.
Cole's earlier pieces
are made from
irons: "My first in
spiration for using
irons occurred
many years ago
when I kept walking
past an iron run over
by a car." Cole com
mented during his
presentation at the
Wilsey Distin
guished Lecture on
Oct. 6 at the Annen
berg Auditorium.
"Finally. I gave in to
temptation and
picked it up."
Thus is the inspi
ration for pieces
such as "Domestic
Degrees" (1998). in
which a hot iron is
used to scorch layers
of paper, creating
different degrees of
burn marks.
Cole also used
the irons themselves
to assemble pieces

such as "Water Window Female Iron Fig
ure" (1998), a sculpture created of metal
iron parts, cord and concrete. This statue
reflects 'Cole's fascination with African

power figures and tribal symbolism. "I be
lieve in spirituality and life in inanimate
objects," Cole stated. "Certain figural
shapes do insinuate power in African cul
ture, and I like to use consumer objects to
duplicate those shapes."
This fusion of African motifs with man
ufactured objects, titled "neo-Africanized
art," is reminiscent of Picasso's work as
well as Minimalist traditions as established
by Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray's
"ready-mades."

Cole's assembled sculptures made of
iron led him to experiment with other
consumer objects as well. In 2002,
Cole collected various used bicycle *
parts to construct "Sears Ross tji ,
wara (mother and child)," a type of \
African Bamana head mask that hon
ored the antelope/man who taught the

tribe to farm. This piece in particular em
phasizes the graceful curves and utility of
bicycle parts.
In 2000. Cole began to work with glazed

vitreous china and
other bath facilities
such as taps and
plumbingware to con
struct figurative sculp
tures. Though Cole
began with no idea

as to
what A

th e
result of

his assem-

blag e s
would look

like, he worked
with different configu-

rations untUiin idea struck.
"1 never sketch or plan out

my pieces," Cole said. "1 usual
ly play with the material at hand

until an idea appears. The process is
very intuitive and fast."

Aside from African-inspired art. Cole
also experimented with East Asian sym
bols and themes. Using mostly thrift store
high-heeled shoes and hairdryers. Cole
created a series of furniture, masks and fig
ure sculptures in 1993 that was inspired by
Irnelda Marcos, the infamous wife of Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos of the Philip
pines, whose possession of a large number
of shoes was a quintessential representa
tion of the greed and malfeasance of that
government.
One such piece is "Made in the Philip
pines" (1993), a throne constructed of
mostly red. black and white shoes. Thread
ed and nailed together, the downward-fac
ing soles are reminiscent of tree leaves
while the red heels on the border suggest
flames. However, even more impressive
than the made of 3.000 shoes is
"Air in Remission" (1990), a large, circu
lar installation piece made of hairdryers
and shaped like a mandala. Standing in the
middle of the piece and imagining all the
hairdryers blowing at once is like experi
encing modern meditation in an internal
world of ever-flowing air.

For

th e
wide selection

of art exhibited.
Cantor does an ef-

fectivc job of grouping
Cole's works in the

room by themes: pieces that
are more politically and his-

torically oriented are mostly in
terspersed in one corner of the ex-

hibil. One of the most interesting pieces is
"Malcolm's Chickens I" (2002), which was
inspired by 9/11. The title originated from
a comment Malcolm X made after the as
sassination of President Kennedy: "the
chickens come home to roost," meaning
that the pent-up violence and anger within
America due to injustices had resulted in
death. Thus, "Malcolm's Chickens I" is
made fully of material suggesting heat and
fire: feathers made of matches with insides
stuffed with broom heads, wax and Styro
foam
For those in awe of Cole's incredible
ability to sculpt out of all media. Cole has
one comment: "I believe in the oneness of
the world; anyone can make anything out
of everything. All objects, including shoes,
are like cells that can be built up into a
greater whole."
"Anxious Objects": Willie Cole's Favorite
Brands will be on exhibit at the Pigott Fam
ily Gallery at the Cantor Arts Center from
Oct. 3 to Jan. 6.
