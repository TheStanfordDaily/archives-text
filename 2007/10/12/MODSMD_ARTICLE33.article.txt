### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION KZSU SCENESTER 
Every year, a few weeks into our fall quarter, a lineup of
good, decent and fair bands descend upon the Shoreline
Amphitheatre in Mountain View, right next to the Google
headquarters. Hordes of Bay Area kids (including quite a
few Stanford students) bring their blankets and chill out in
the sun for the afternoon. This year, the Festival was held
last Saturday, Oct. 6th.
The local Download Festival is actually part of a larger
network of concerts which began five years ago. England,
Boston, Washington State and Chicago all have their own re
spective Download Festivals. The Festival's name references
(or supposedly references) its connection to technology —
you know, Internet downloads, MIDI files, laptops, floppy
disks and all that stuff. I personally encountered no evidence
of this Festival being related to computers, but maybe I was
n't looking hard enough.
This year's Festival seemed to pass over indie's biggest
names in order to maintain a theme: dark/goth rock. That's
right, many of the Festival's largest acts drew from a distinct
ly gothic aesthetic: 365daysofstatic, The Black Angels, She
Wants Revenge, AFI and The Cure. With this musical theme,
the Festival's mood took a bit of a turn from previous years;
no longer was it just a mainstream, crowd-pleasing lineup, but
more of a niche bill for hardcore fans. Of course, many of the
Festival's bands — The Cure in particular — have had mas
sive mainstream success. Simply having The Cure or AFI by
themselves would not have indicated a goth theme. But when
four or five main acts are directly connected to goth culture,
the Festival takes on that theme.
Starting my day off at about 5 p.m., I managed to catch
most of the best acts on the bill:
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club
I was alternately impressed and disappointed by BRMC.
This Los Angeles-based band is best known for its drastic
shift in musical development. It started as a shoegaze band
but soon became a country-blues indie band. Their album
2005 "Howl" has become a cult classic.
The band attempted to marry the atmospheric guitar
heroics of shoegaze with the gritty shuffle of blues. At times,
this combination was astounding: the band would loop a
blues lick, build up a bass line and then just keep layering until
they had a robotic blues groove pounding out over the am
phitheatre. Moments like "Ain't No Easy Way" were musi
cally sublime. But then the blues riffs just kept coming. Not
Jimmy Page-style riffs that dart all over the guitar, but basic,
repetitive riffs that never develop. While I applaud BRMC
for injecting roots rock into the indie rock canon, they seem
to be little more than homage to roots rock. They take basic
chord progressions and melodies from blues and make them
loud. This works every so often, but not over the course of an
entire set. Sure, they threw in solos and breakdowns and
other tricks, but it all faded to a gray soup of blues.
Kings of Leon
Kings of Leon were the headlincrs for the Second Stage and
for good reason. Riding the success of dance and garage bands
like The Strokes, Kings of Leon differentiated themselves by
adding Southern rock. They sang with a twang, played with a
primal energy and had an earthy stylishness. Comprised of
four brothers from Tennessee, the band built a large following
via their first albums "Youth and Young Manhood" and "Aha
Shake Heartbreak." The riffs were tight and the chunky, and
the lyrics were imbued (superficially) with rootsy attitude. You
may have even seen them on that one Jetta commercial. And
this is both the conundrum and the allure of Kings of Leon:
Which is more real, their New York-style chic or their back
woods Southern drawl? Without a doubt, the interaction of

both characteristics is what makes Kings of Leon so exciting.
But it also makes them seem, at times, like a regular indie band
playing the role of poor country boys. Either way, their music
is steeped in this Southern caste.
So, to my surprise. Kings of Leon drew frequently on their
latest album and played more like U2 than Neil Young. Per
forming to a packed crowd as the sun set, these Southern boys
turned on their delay pedals and ripped through their set like
pros. Their latest album, "Because of the Times," attempts to
take their post-punk sound and fill arenas. The songs include
repetitive baselines, waves of distortion, slow-burning
arrangements and crashing finales. This particular type of
song — which included the opener "Knocked Up" and the
hit "On Call" — were fun and well-done.
But, ultimately, the band's more garage-like tunes were
the best. They played classics like "King of the Rodeo" and
"The Bucket" with a crisp urgency. The timing was impecca
ble and the hook was killer — what more can you ask for?
Metric
At about 5 or so, I heard the squeal of a synth float out
over the Festival and into the Media Tent. I immediately ran
down the hill, past the beer stands, the hospital tents, and the,
urn, other beer stands to arrive at the Second Stage for the
band Metric. This band was probably the most "hipster" act
on the bill and, therefore, my most anticipated set. I arrived
just in time to sec Emily Haines do scissor kicks next to the
drummer. (Upon seeing this, 1 thought I had stumbled upon
the Van Halcn reunion tour, but quickly got my bearings.)
Metric is a new-new-wave band from the snowy nether re
gions of Canada known as Toronto. The charismatic Emily
Haines anchors the four-piece with her smooth voice and
retro sense of style. She also pulls double duty as a contribu
tor to indie megastars Broken Social Scene. All in all, 1 would
peg her performance style as the blond version of Karen O
from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs: disheveled, unhinged, fiercely
feminine and yet slightly androgynous. At the Download

Festival, she was dressed in '80s-style leggings and t-shirt
dress. She flopped about the stage with a restrained craziness
that complemented her music.
The band ripped into some of their earlier songs which
were just re-released on CD from 1999. This work was well
received, mixing new-wave fun with post-rock experimenta
tion. It all seemed to culminate, however, with Emily Haines
going bezerk for "Combat Baby." Their biggest hit so far.
"Combat Baby" is a bitingly sarcastic commentary on Amer
ican politics (the usual suspect) and features one of the catchi
est choruses from the past several years of indie rock.
The Cure
The Cure were clearly the most anticipated performance
of the night. Their musical legacy had. after all, opened the
door for almost every other band at the Download Festival.
Even so, 1 was a little disconcerted that a band which peaked
in 1986 was taking top-billing at the Festival. I mean, it's not
like The Cure disappeared for 20 years; they've just been re
leasing lots and lots of irrelevant music.
But, ultimately, The Cure's catalogue is extensive and
beloved enough that they fit comfortably into the Festival's
top spot. Many fans, it seemed, had a very personal connec
tion to Robert Smith's songs. His hyper-sullen tunes about
love and heartbreak were more than just brief moments of
arena rock fun, but some form of highly private catharsis. The
band clearly appealed to Generation X parents, goth kids,
even jaded indie kids. (Without The Cure, there would be no
Shout Out Louds, for instance.)
So sitting in the amphitheater as The Cure revved up their
fog machines, I was ready for a blast of nostalgia and not much
else. Thankfully, Robert Smith thoroughly surpassed my ex
pectations. Playing hits like "Pictures of You," "Boys Don't
Cry" and others. The Cure proved why they can still headline
after (no joke) 30 years of playing music: their songs are well
done, and fans still connect with Robert Smith's moodv lyric?.

right, many of the Festival's largest acts drew from a distinct
ly gothic aesthetic: 365daysofstatic, The Black Angels, She
Wants Revenge, AFI and The Cure. With this musical theme,
the Festival's mood took a bit of a turn from previous years;
no longer was it just a mainstream, crowd-pleasing lineup, but
more of a niche bill for hardcore fans. Of course, many of the
Festival's bands — The Cure in particular — have had mas
sive mainstream success. Simply having The Cure or AFI by
themselves would not have indicated a goth theme. But when
four or five main acts are directly connected to goth culture,
the Festival takes on that theme.
Starting my day off at about 5 p.m., I managed to catch
most of the best acts on the bill:
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club
I was alternately impressed and disappointed by BRMC.
This Los Angeles-based band is best known for its drastic
shift in musical development. It started as a shoegaze band
but soon became a country-blues indie band. Their album
2005 "Howl" has become a cult classic.
The band attempted to marry the atmospheric guitar
heroics of shoegaze with the gritty shuffle of blues. At times,
this combination was astounding: the band would loop a
blues lick, build up a bass line and then just keep layering until
they had a robotic blues groove pounding out over the am
phitheatre. Moments like "Ain't No Easy Way" were musi
cally sublime. But then the blues riffs just kept coming. Not
Jimmy Page-style riffs that dart all over the guitar, but basic,
repetitive riffs that never develop. While I applaud BRMC
for injecting roots rock into the indie rock canon, they seem
to be little more than homage to roots rock. They take basic
chord progressions and melodies from blues and make them
loud. This works every so often, but not over the course of an
entire set. Sure, they threw in solos and breakdowns and
other tricks, but it all faded to a gray soup of blues.
Kings of Leon
Kings of Leon were the headlincrs for the Second Stage and
for good reason. Riding the success of dance and garage bands
like The Strokes, Kings of Leon differentiated themselves by
adding Southern rock. They sang with a twang, played with a
primal energy and had an earthy stylishness. Comprised of
four brothers from Tennessee, the band built a large following
via their first albums "Youth and Young Manhood" and "Aha
Shake Heartbreak." The riffs were tight and the chunky, and
the lyrics were imbued (superficially) with rootsy attitude. You
may have even seen them on that one Jetta commercial. And
this is both the conundrum and the allure of Kings of Leon:
Which is more real, their New York-style chic or their back
woods Southern drawl? Without a doubt, the interaction of

both characteristics is what makes Kings of Leon so exciting.
But it also makes them seem, at times, like a regular indie band
playing the role of poor country boys. Either way, their music
is steeped in this Southern caste.
So, to my surprise. Kings of Leon drew frequently on their
latest album and played more like U2 than Neil Young. Per
forming to a packed crowd as the sun set, these Southern boys
turned on their delay pedals and ripped through their set like
pros. Their latest album, "Because of the Times," attempts to
take their post-punk sound and fill arenas. The songs include
repetitive baselines, waves of distortion, slow-burning
arrangements and crashing finales. This particular type of
song — which included the opener "Knocked Up" and the
hit "On Call" — were fun and well-done.
But, ultimately, the band's more garage-like tunes were
the best. They played classics like "King of the Rodeo" and
"The Bucket" with a crisp urgency. The timing was impecca
ble and the hook was killer — what more can you ask for?
Metric
At about 5 or so, I heard the squeal of a synth float out
over the Festival and into the Media Tent. I immediately ran
down the hill, past the beer stands, the hospital tents, and the,
urn, other beer stands to arrive at the Second Stage for the
band Metric. This band was probably the most "hipster" act
on the bill and, therefore, my most anticipated set. I arrived
just in time to sec Emily Haines do scissor kicks next to the
drummer. (Upon seeing this, 1 thought I had stumbled upon
the Van Halcn reunion tour, but quickly got my bearings.)
Metric is a new-new-wave band from the snowy nether re
gions of Canada known as Toronto. The charismatic Emily
Haines anchors the four-piece with her smooth voice and
retro sense of style. She also pulls double duty as a contribu
tor to indie megastars Broken Social Scene. All in all, 1 would
peg her performance style as the blond version of Karen O
from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs: disheveled, unhinged, fiercely
feminine and yet slightly androgynous. At the Download

Festival, she was dressed in '80s-style leggings and t-shirt
dress. She flopped about the stage with a restrained craziness
that complemented her music.
The band ripped into some of their earlier songs which
were just re-released on CD from 1999. This work was well
received, mixing new-wave fun with post-rock experimenta
tion. It all seemed to culminate, however, with Emily Haines
going bezerk for "Combat Baby." Their biggest hit so far.
"Combat Baby" is a bitingly sarcastic commentary on Amer
ican politics (the usual suspect) and features one of the catchi
est choruses from the past several years of indie rock.
The Cure
The Cure were clearly the most anticipated performance
of the night. Their musical legacy had. after all, opened the
door for almost every other band at the Download Festival.
Even so, 1 was a little disconcerted that a band which peaked
in 1986 was taking top-billing at the Festival. I mean, it's not
like The Cure disappeared for 20 years; they've just been re
leasing lots and lots of irrelevant music.
But, ultimately, The Cure's catalogue is extensive and
beloved enough that they fit comfortably into the Festival's
top spot. Many fans, it seemed, had a very personal connec
tion to Robert Smith's songs. His hyper-sullen tunes about
love and heartbreak were more than just brief moments of
arena rock fun, but some form of highly private catharsis. The
band clearly appealed to Generation X parents, goth kids,
even jaded indie kids. (Without The Cure, there would be no
Shout Out Louds, for instance.)
So sitting in the amphitheater as The Cure revved up their
fog machines, I was ready for a blast of nostalgia and not much
else. Thankfully, Robert Smith thoroughly surpassed my ex
pectations. Playing hits like "Pictures of You," "Boys Don't
Cry" and others. The Cure proved why they can still headline
after (no joke) 30 years of playing music: their songs are well
done, and fans still connect with Robert Smith's moodv lyric?.

Every year, a few weeks into our fall quarter, a lineup of
good, decent and fair bands descend upon the Shoreline
Amphitheatre in Mountain View, right next to the Google
headquarters. Hordes of Bay Area kids (including quite a
few Stanford students) bring their blankets and chill out in
the sun for the afternoon. This year, the Festival was held
last Saturday, Oct. 6th.
The local Download Festival is actually part of a larger
network of concerts which began five years ago. England,
Boston, Washington State and Chicago all have their own re
spective Download Festivals. The Festival's name references
(or supposedly references) its connection to technology —
you know, Internet downloads, MIDI files, laptops, floppy
disks and all that stuff. I personally encountered no evidence
of this Festival being related to computers, but maybe I was
n't looking hard enough.
