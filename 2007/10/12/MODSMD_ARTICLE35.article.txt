## Thaiphoon Does Not Blow 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION STORM CHASERS 
When jaunting into Palo Alto, the average Stanford student rarely ventures off
University Avenue. And really, what can't one find on University? Available for
our perusal are the studied ambience of the Cheesecake Factory, the brisk corpo
rate allure of Starbucks, the whimsical jollity of 'Pasta?' — need the student
gourmet venture further?
Yes.
The simple truth is that Palo Alto's best restaurants — for both the bargain
hunter and the food-lover — are on the side streets off University Avenue. One
need simply step off University in order to uncover the small but decidedly reward
ing world of Palo Alto suburban dining, in which Thaiphoon Restaurant is a stand
out. Located on Emerson Street, just a few short steps from Pizza My Heart (this is

your legacy, Janis), Thaiphoon is a lunch and dinner joint that serves mediocre
lunches and stunning dinners.
To be fair to Thaiphoon, it is, in our educated opinion, the finest casual Asian
restaurant in downtown Palo Alto. We are being harsh when we call its lunches
mediocre. They're not really, at least in terms of the food quality, which is consis
tent through lunch and dinner. But the food assembly at lunch leaves something to
be desired: the curries and other entrees are served in shallow rectangular bowls
that Thaiphoon probably bought wholesale from the airlines of yore that used to
serve hot meals and let you smoke in the aisles. These charming vessels are, in turn,
placed on a rectangular ceramic tray that is completed by a round pat of rice and a
small mountain of wilting Iceberg and peanut dressing. Not the end of the world,
but not entirely appetizing, either.
Thaiphoon's dinner ambiance is generally better in all regards. The food is
served in round plates (we don't know what our peeve with rectangular bowls is,
except that it's so...airplane) and all orders of rice are heaped together in a large
bowl. The setting of the table is more suited to family-style dining, which is really
the only way to dine in a Thai restaurant. Don't hog your entrde like an ignorant
white oppressor — go to Thaiphoon with the aim of sharing food. We suggest vis
iting this establishment in a group or a deux.
The heart of the menu is divided between the noodles and the curries, so forget
the salads, the soups and most of the beef — these dishes aren't bad, they're just
less impressive than the menu's real starlets. The pot stickers and the fried shrimp
are the rockstars of the appetizer menu, which also includes perfectly respectable
egg rolls, as well as some foods of mysterious origins (egg roll samosas?). ITie divas
of the entree selection include (among others) the chicken pad thai, the green
curry, the red curry and the Panang curry.
For the less adventurous, the chicken yellow curry, which swims in a rich co
conut sauce, will probably suffice. Chicken is essential to the Thaiphoon experi
ence, so let's hope that you aren't a vegetarian. Thaiphoon's kitchen must be occu
pied by a deviously unfair kitchen god who omits the tastiest vegetables from the
vegetable curries, so vegetarians will probably be peeved, and vegans will likely
starve. Dieters can survive — the menu includes a number of Thai salads and sim
ple soups — but they'll doubtless be jealous of their companions' poultry dishes.
Although Thaiphoon is mainly an eating establishment, it also has a quaint bar and
an extensive cocktail menu, which includes such exotic items as a lemongrass mo
jito, so you lucky possessors-of-fake-IDscan work up a pleasant Thai buzz. For tee
totalers, we recommend the honey mint lemonade. And if you have room for
dessert, the fried banana is a uniquely Thai treat that will please nearly any palate;
the frying process brings out everything good about a banana, and the accompany
ing coconut ice cream is the banana's ideal life partner.
In addition to its consistently stellar food, Thaiphoon has a speedy wait staff, and
service is reliably quick, even when the restaurant is literally packed. And the pric
ing is reasonable, especially in comparison with the overrated, overpriced Italian
wine-and pasta joints that litter University like so many cigarette butts.
Thaiphoon's entrees range between about $7 and $9, which means that a full meal
for two (including drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts) rings in at about $40.
We think it's worth it.
