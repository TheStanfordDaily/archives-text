## This real girl is real dull 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION MANNEQUIN MANAGER 
In some ways. Bianca is the perfect girl.
She's in her 20s, tall and skinny, with big
boobs, shiny brown hair and pouty, Angeli
na Jolie lips. She is a Brazilian ex-missionary
who can boast the flexibility of a gymnast,
has nurse's training and loves children. Al
though she may be quiet, she's always a pres
ence. But best of all, she's anatomically cor
rect.
Not a bad package for a silicone doll.
"Lars and the Real Girl," opening this
Friday in theaters, is a surprising take on
what could be a simple, albeit unusual, plot
line: lonely male falls in love with a doll, and
the whole town ends up playing into his delu
sion. Instead of overindulging in slapstick,
it's a mash-up of several movie genres that
give the film depth beyond its comedic sur
face.
"Lars " has its funny moments, but it's
also a coming-of-age story, a portrait of life
in a small town and even (surprise!) a ro
mance. However, while the film's mashed up
qualities imbue it with meaning, they also
make the film drag at points and leave the
viewer with several loose ends.
In the beginning of the movie, we follow
Lars, brilliantly played by Ryan Gosling, as
he goes through the motions of his day-to
day life. His unhappiness is palpable, his
awkwardness doubly so. Lars shows no in
terest in being set up with his coworkers, or
even having dinner with his brother. Gus,
and sister-in-law, Karin. He seems to prefer
the solitude of his own home and the securi
ty of his baby blue scarf, knitted for him by
his mother when he was born.
This all changes when Lars announces to
Gus and Karin that he's "met someone...on
the Internet." Karin is particularly ecstatic,
having been the most concerned for his well
being, and encourages Lars to bring her over
for dinner. Needless to say, Karin and Gus
are shocked when confronted with Bianca. a
custom-made, mail-order sex doll. But what
disturbs them the most is that Lars interacts
with her as if she were a real human being.
After a visit with the town psychiatrist,
Gus and Karin are told that Lars has a "delu
sion," and the only thing they can do for him
is to play along with it. As the psychiatrist
says, "Bianca is in town for a reason," and his
delusion will only be over when he doesn't
need her anymore.
With that, Bianca is woven into the rou
tines of this tight-knit town.While first en
counters play most on the hilarities of her
sheer existence, the townspeople and the
viewer begin to develop a certain affection
toward Bianca â€” she becomes as much of a
character as the rest of them, eliciting both

sympathy and frustration.
But as Bianca's novelty wore off, so did my
patience for the film. I feel that it might have
been more successful as a short film, or if it
hadn't gotten so muddled between its numer
ous genres. "Lars and the Real Girr lost its
momentum and lightheartedness, and while it
tried to replace these elements with sentimen
tality, it ended up falling short of its aspira
tions. The ending left many plot strings un
tied, which left me wondering what the point
was of many of the themes the film spent so
much time developing.
That's not to say that 1 didn't like the
movie; rather, I found it endearing and en
joyable, full of heart and effort. However,
this is also not to say that my accompanying
friend did like the movie; he was anxious for
the film to be over almost as soon as it begun.
My advice? Watch the trailer for now. then
pick it up from Green when it comes out on
DVD. Little will be lost on a smaller screen,
and it will be the perfect companion for a
cold winter evening.
