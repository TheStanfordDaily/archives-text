## Say bonjour to couture 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION MOD MADEL 
Alas, sultry summer has passed and fall
stares us in our faces, reminding us that bitter
winter lurks around the corner. Against this
backdrop of gloomy rumination, designers flip
the finger at the turn of the weather by sending
out their looks for next spring, seeming to
scream the words we want to hear: summer's
in, school's out, it's time for fun.
Over in Paris Fashion Week, all is sweet
ness and light. Nicholas Ghesquiere continues
his mad-lab experiments with color at Balcnci

aga. The result? An energetic floral explosion
that might have seemed tacky, were it not for
Ghesquiere's superlative talent. Taking his
cue from the trompe l'oeil of Balenciaga's orig
inal pieces, Ghesquiere manages to make
pouffy sleeves and a severe empire waistline
look modern. Top (or bottom) this off with
knee-high boots spiked with dashes of riotous
color, and there you have it: a look fit for a
flower-picking Amazon Queen. Fierce.
The joke's on you at Miu Miu. The inim
itable and immutable Miuccia Prada injects
humour into her collection by evoking the
spirit of play: cartoons are emblazoned onto a
blouse, thick candy-color stripes are splashed
across pants and skirts, high girly waists deto
nate into ruches and puffs, beautiful insects ap
pear to be eating up shoes. But the biggest joke
of all: Miuccia converts a fashion faux-pas into
a must-have. Miu Miu's take on the poncho —
a lighter, airier version in a delicious shade of
plum — makes it the perfect accessory for
strolling down the street in a spring rain or a
summer shower.
Over at Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs
(whose eponymous brand garnered mixed re
views in New York) puts the "C" in camp with
his first 12 looks: sexy nurses all bedecked in
see-through uniforms. If you thought Jacobs's
showing in New York was bizarre, you might
find this a bit too much to swallow — though,
of course, in typical Jacobean fashion, you
know you'll be clamoring for the Murakami
esque graphic print bags in svelte suede or lux
urious leather. Or their China-born knockoffs.
Movement is the theme at Lanvin, where the
ascendant Alber Elbaz shows off his virtuosity
as a tailor. Precisely draped fluid dresses in a
summery palette billowed down the runway,
with nary a seam out of place. Elbaz pays fit

ting tribute to Jean Lanvin, the house's
founder, by taking Lanvin's distinct silhou
ettes and making them relevant to today's
women — a flapper dress embellished with
feathers and sequins becomes, in Elbaz's vi
sion, an impossibly chic statement.
Andrew Gn goes from strength to strength
with his ultra-wearable collection: no doubt
Forever 21 and other lesser brands will be
looking to his feminine frocks for inspiration.
Butterflies, flower prints and polka dots add a
super-girly touch — think a younger Lindsay
Lohan in her pre-crack days.
And thank the heavens that fashion's en
fant terrible is no longer trotting out terrible
clothes. After his bizarre solipsistic fall/winter
collection, Alexander McQueen goes back to
his roots and brings Savile Row sexy back with
his cut just-so blazer-skirt combinations and
his form-fitting, curve-accentuating dresses.
Take a cue from him and consider cropping
your long hair off into a girlish shoulder-length
bob, which you can then brush and tease to
shiny, voluminous perfection.
So as Paris Fashion Week draws to a close,
consider the prospect of spring's return and
wearing all of these fabulous clothes. Mourn a
bit for yourselves, but remember that the sea
sons, like fashion's fickle eye, will still turn.
