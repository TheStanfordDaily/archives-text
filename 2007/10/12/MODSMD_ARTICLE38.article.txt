# What's old is cool again
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION CLOSET RAIDER 
Fashion, I think, is half creating new stuff and half bring
ing back old stuff. Creating new stuff is pretty simple and self
explanatory. But bringing back old stuff — now that can get
tricky.
' You see, "old stuff in fashion are not the pieces from, say,
two seasons ago, like Burberry totes or Lacoste polos with
popped collars. Those are not quite old enough to be vin
tage.We're talking looks from 20 seasons ago.
And only certain old stuff, at that. Platform shoes? Still in
the '70s. Super bell bottoms? Leave them to the '80s. I'm not
quite sure who the fashion gods are that get to make these
seemingly arbitrary decisions, but, as a slave to fashion trends,
I just do as lam told. And with my help, you could, too. \
So if not platform shoes and bellbottoms, what exactly is com
ing back, you ask? Excellent question. Just a few of the past
decades' trends are coming back this season, and, with a few
pointers, you could look as hip as the class of 77 did when
they were your age. *■, - *v*i p

High-Waisted Jeans
After years of the super-low, muffin-top bearing, ass
crack revealing slightly bootcut jean, the high waist is back/'
with vengeance. Accompanying both the skinny and wide-leg
jeans, the high waist has been seen on Ciara. Lindsay Lohan,
Rachel Bilson, Mischa Barton and Sienna Miller, just to name
a few. The key to this look is to keep your top half feminine.
Both fitted tanks or tees and ruffled silky blouses will work
for this. If you're going with the skinnies, try a loose balloon
cardigan to mix up your streamlined look. If you're opting for
wide-leg, a fitted blazer will top off your outfit nicely.

Some of my favorites:

Harkening back to the mini-dresses and
the of the 19705, this season 's dress
es are cut to show a lot of leg. Looser, flowier
upper halves balance a revealing bottom. Flo
ral, geometrical or mod prints complement
the simple A-line cut. The best thing about
this trend? It's almost impossible to make it
not work. Cold out? Throw on some solid
tights and flat riding boots, and you're good to
go. tn warmer weather, strappy sandals or
flats look just as awesorrte.
