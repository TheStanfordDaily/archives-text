## Put the "Gum" in "Homecoming" 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION RETIREMENT ROMPER 
I iomecoming weekend is the season to hunt
the most dangerous game of all: Man. More specifi
cally, sexy older men. Some of you may like 69 as a
position, Roxy knows that '69 is better as a vintage.
Like wine and kitschy old pornography, lovers get
better with age. Whether you're looking to score
with someone from the Class of '77 or a fresh-faced
young TA back here for his '02 reunion, Roxy high
ly suggests you sample the prime-aged beef on cam
pus this weekend. Here are some pointers.

The thing to remember when taking an older
lover is that you may have bounced your share of
bunk beds, but chances are your sex object will be
significantly more experienced than

you. And there s no shame in
klhat. Many of us came to Stan-
Lord ;is eager young virgins.

Heck, you may plan to leave
that way — trust Roxy,

there are tons of
things you can do
in a locked semi
nar room with
out slipping off
your chastity
belt (or fuck
me Rock & Re-

public jeans).
Don't whip
out cheesy Holly-

wood sex moves like
the old "nothing but a
corset under my Lon
don Fog" trope and ex-

jpect them to impress a
gseasoned audience.
' Double ditto for the
schmaltzy "Ride me
harder, you grizzled old
cowboy"-style dirty talk
that is so prevalent in

pornos. Reenacting the artificial arousal that seems
to work so well on the silver screen is definitely not
going to get your fingers running through his silver
chest hair.
Whether the object of your erotic agitation is
26 or 62, pulling out the stops on your bad girl (or
boy) act is probably just going to make you look
younger and more naive. If your aged-to-perfection
stud is tripping into bed with you in the first place,
chances are he's in the mood for a hot young fling.
Not knowing the difference between a blumpy and a
brunski is not going to hurt your case — if anything,
it'll just show your prey how desperately in need you
are of his tutelage.
The best part of hooking up with an older gen
tle(wo)man is learning new tricks that will leave your
other lovers' heads reeling. Imagine how many fine
points of tonguework you can learn after just a few
minutes with someone who's had 40 years to perfect
his technique. Find out first-hand exactly what made
(he sexual revolution so revolutionary, or at least sec
how that sexy class of '92 was bumpin' back in the
days you were bumping Weird A 1 in your Discman.
Roxy says that vintage sexual trends are like old
slang: Good to throw in the mix now and again, and
guaranteed to come back into style eventually.
Now that we've established the advantages of al
luring the AARP set, Roxy must point out the gold
en rule of grandpa-humping: Do it (or him) because
you want to, not because you're looking for a sugar
daddy to bankroll that fifth-year victory lap. An af
fair with an older lover can be a formative sexual ex
perience for a foxy college student — it's refreshing

and sexy as

hell to drink Chianti instead
of Coors Light with some
one who doesn't think
"clitoris" is Latin for

"race you to the fin
ish!" After you
spring your

trap, make
sure to open
ly and honest-

ly define your
terms. Then
enjoy a night of pas
sion with someone

who'll bed you somewhere
better than a Lag mini-dou
ble.

Shoot sharp and swift this
weekend, hunters, and don't
forget to practice your new
found skills on sexy professors
in the off-season. When the
time conies for your reunion,
hopefully you'll come hack to
Stanford with a head full of
evocative memories — and

perhaps to a g
saucy under- 1
grad romp of'
your own.
