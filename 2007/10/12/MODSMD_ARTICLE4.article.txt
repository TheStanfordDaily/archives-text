## Football Defense, Yancy tamed the Trojans 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
There is always a tendency, in any come-from-behind,
upset victory, to overemphasize the role of the offense.
And Stanford's win last Saturday over Southern Cali
fornia has been no exception.
It's hard to blame anyone for the hype that has surround
ed redshirt sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard follow
ing what many have called the biggest upset in college foot
ball history. And the trials senior wide receiver Mark Brad
ford has overcome in the past two and a half weeks, from
mourning the death of his father to snaring the game-win
ning touchdown pass on a fourth-and-ten fade route in the
game's final minute at USC, have been truly remarkable.

But we should not forget the Cardinal defense, which also
played an immense role in sacking the Trojans 24-23 at the
Coliseum in Los Angeles. Stanford relied on its defense to
keep the team in the game â€” through the first three quarters
of play, Stanford's offense failed to score a single point.
Jim Harbaugh's squad stayed competitive thanks in large
part to a game-changing interception returned for a touch
down by sophomore safety Austin Yancy. With 11:56 remain
ing in the third quarter, the sophomore picked off John
David Booty's pass on third-and-two. streaking 31 yards into
the endzone. The Cardinal was finally on the board, with
Southern California clinging to a slim 9-7 lead.
Suddenly, a game in which Stanford had managed to con
tain the USC offense seemed like it might be more than just
a moral victory. For the first time in the contest, and for the

first time since 2(H)4. it seemed that the Cardinal might have
a real shot to knock off the Trojans.
Shifts in momentum like that certainly don't come along
every Saturday.
"it was a big play,and it \v;is a lot of fun," Yancy said of his
first career interception and first collegiate touchdown.
"Getting into the end/one and being able to celebrate with
my team, especially being at SC and being able to quiet the
place down a little bit. We had been pushing and pushing, and
iiniilly broke through on defense."
If Yancy sounds familiar to you,he should. Asa true fresh
man.the League City, Texas native started six games at wide
receiver for a Cardinal offense depleted by injuries. Yancy
