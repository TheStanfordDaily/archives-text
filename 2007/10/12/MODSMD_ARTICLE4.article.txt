# Austin Yancy
## Football Defense, Yancy tamed the Trojans 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
There is always a tendency, in any come-from-behind,
upset victory, to overemphasize the role of the offense.
And Stanford's win last Saturday over Southern Cali
fornia has been no exception.
It's hard to blame anyone for the hype that has surround
ed redshirt sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard follow
ing what many have called the biggest upset in college foot
ball history. And the trials senior wide receiver Mark Brad
ford has overcome in the past two and a half weeks, from
mourning the death of his father to snaring the game-win
ning touchdown pass on a fourth-and-ten fade route in the
game's final minute at USC, have been truly remarkable.

But we should not forget the Cardinal defense, which also
played an immense role in sacking the Trojans 24-23 at the
Coliseum in Los Angeles. Stanford relied on its defense to
keep the team in the game — through the first three quarters
of play, Stanford's offense failed to score a single point.
Jim Harbaugh's squad stayed competitive thanks in large
part to a game-changing interception returned for a touch
down by sophomore safety Austin Yancy. With 11:56 remain
ing in the third quarter, the sophomore picked off John
David Booty's pass on third-and-two. streaking 31 yards into
the endzone. The Cardinal was finally on the board, with
Southern California clinging to a slim 9-7 lead.
Suddenly, a game in which Stanford had managed to con
tain the USC offense seemed like it might be more than just
a moral victory. For the first time in the contest, and for the

first time since 2(H)4. it seemed that the Cardinal might have
a real shot to knock off the Trojans.
Shifts in momentum like that certainly don't come along
every Saturday.
"it was a big play,and it \v;is a lot of fun," Yancy said of his
first career interception and first collegiate touchdown.
"Getting into the end/one and being able to celebrate with
my team, especially being at SC and being able to quiet the
place down a little bit. We had been pushing and pushing, and
iiniilly broke through on defense."

baugh arrived and approached him about moving
to the other side of the ball.
"At first 1 was. I guess, a little skeptical about it,"
he said. "But I wasn't trying to fight it — whatever
is best for the team or helps the team (I'll do it].
Coaches felt like we had a need at safety and plen
ty of good receivers coming back. So the transi
tion. with the coaches we've had — the coaches
know exactly what they're doing and they were
able to teach me just the position."
Yancy heaped praise on the new defensive
coaching staff and singled out several teammates
in the defensive backfield, including sophomore
Bo McNally and senior Tim Sims, who have helped
make his transition smoother.
The sophomore safety's defensive heroics,
though, were far from a solo performance. The
Cardinal collected four interceptions, four sacks
and a fumble recovery against the high-octane
Trojan offense. From a tenacious goal-line stand at
the end of the first half to Bo McNally's game
clinching interception at the end of the fourth
quarter, Stanford's defense carried the Cardinal
for much of the game.
"A lot of preparation and just doing what the
coaches have taught [went into the defensive per
formance]," Yancy said."l mean the coaches have
been putting [us] in position to make plays this
whole year, and we're just focused a little more on
our assignments and making sure everybody did
our jobs. That's the thing, you do your job and
everybody else does their job and together, as a
team and as a defense, everything was just coming
together."
Harbaugh agreed with Yancy's assessment of
why the defense has seen so much success during
Tuesday's press conference, saying it was "really
hard to single out one guy because [the defense is]
playing so well collectively."
Still. Yancy's transformation from wideout to
defensive playmaker has been remarkable to be

hold. According to the sophomore, the successful
transition has had a great deal to do with an abili
ty to change his overall mindset within the game.
"As a wideout, you don't want to get hit; you
want to go through and score on every play," he
said. "With defense, it's a different kind of mindset
— you have to he more aggressive. Offensively. 1
was playing wideout and it's more like reading the
coverage, and on defense it's definitely a looser
feel. Especially as a safety in this defense you get
to tackle a lot more and try to be a run stopper. So
it's a lot of fun being out there and being able to

hit."
There's one aspect of his game that hasn't
changed from his days tin the offensive side of the
ball, though, as Yancy proved on Saturday.
"[Being a playmaker] is what our defense is
about," he said. "You've got to make plays and

Against the then second-ranked Trojans of
USC, the Cardinal did just that.

a real shot to knock off the Trojans.
Shifts in momentum like that certainly don't come along
every Saturday.
"it was a big play,and it \v;is a lot of fun," Yancy said of his
first career interception and first collegiate touchdown.
"Getting into the end/one and being able to celebrate with
my team, especially being at SC and being able to quiet the
place down a little bit. We had been pushing and pushing, and
iiniilly broke through on defense."

caught If) passes for 168 yards in 2006 before Har
baugh arrived and approached him about moving
to the other side of the ball.
"At first 1 was. I guess, a little skeptical about it,"
he said. "But I wasn't trying to fight it — whatever
is best for the team or helps the team (I'll do it].
Coaches felt like we had a need at safety and plen
ty of good receivers coming back. So the transi
tion. with the coaches we've had — the coaches
know exactly what they're doing and they were
able to teach me just the position."
Yancy heaped praise on the new defensive
coaching staff and singled out several teammates
in the defensive backfield, including sophomore
Bo McNally and senior Tim Sims, who have helped
make his transition smoother.
The sophomore safety's defensive heroics,
though, were far from a solo performance. The
Cardinal collected four interceptions, four sacks
and a fumble recovery against the high-octane
Trojan offense. From a tenacious goal-line stand at
the end of the first half to Bo McNally's game
clinching interception at the end of the fourth
quarter, Stanford's defense carried the Cardinal
for much of the game.
"A lot of preparation and just doing what the
coaches have taught [went into the defensive per
formance]," Yancy said."l mean the coaches have
been putting [us] in position to make plays this
whole year, and we're just focused a little more on
our assignments and making sure everybody did
our jobs. That's the thing, you do your job and
everybody else does their job and together, as a
team and as a defense, everything was just coming
together."
Harbaugh agreed with Yancy's assessment of
why the defense has seen so much success during
Tuesday's press conference, saying it was "really
hard to single out one guy because [the defense is]
playing so well collectively."
Still. Yancy's transformation from wideout to
defensive playmaker has been remarkable to be

hold. According to the sophomore, the successful
transition has had a great deal to do with an abili
ty to change his overall mindset within the game.
"As a wideout, you don't want to get hit; you
want to go through and score on every play," he
said. "With defense, it's a different kind of mindset
— you have to he more aggressive. Offensively. 1
was playing wideout and it's more like reading the
coverage, and on defense it's definitely a looser
feel. Especially as a safety in this defense you get
to tackle a lot more and try to be a run stopper. So
it's a lot of fun being out there and being able to

hit."
There's one aspect of his game that hasn't
changed from his days tin the offensive side of the
ball, though, as Yancy proved on Saturday.
"[Being a playmaker] is what our defense is
about," he said. "You've got to make plays and
good things will happen."
Against the then second-ranked Trojans of
USC, the Cardinal did just that.
