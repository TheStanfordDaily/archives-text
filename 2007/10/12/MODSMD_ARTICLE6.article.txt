## RF kids: The dorm is their playground 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA 
Imagine living and spending your
childhood years surrounded by
hormone-ridden, noisy, over
achieving, crazy teenagers. For about
40 children on the Stanford campus,
whose ages range from six months to
18 years, this is life.These are the chil
dren of Residential Fellows (RFs),
who live in the dormitory with their
parents and grow up on the Stanford
campus.
For Nancy Buffington. there are
many advantages to raising children
in a dorm environment, aside from
convenient babysitting. Buffington,
along with her husband Clyde Mon
eyhun. is an RF at Branner Hall.They
have been living there for two years
with their children, twelve-year-old
Jesse and five-year-old Gabriel.
4 'l"his is a really rich environment
with smart people doing so many dif
ferent things," Buffington says. "Our
kids will become geniuses!"
Ross Shachter. RF of Serra Hall,
agrees, saying that there are very few
places in the world where children get
to meet and interact with such a di
verse community. His two children,
Simon, 15, and Naomi, 17. have been
living here since they were infants.
According to Shachter. his kids
like the excitement and movement of
the dorm. Naomi Shachter believes
that such an environment has made
her and her brother more social and
friendly, as they have become accus
tomed to meeting and getting to know
new people all the time.
Living in a dorm might also make
these kids better equipped to handle
college life.The children socialize with
the residents as much as they want
and see firsthand the results of, for ex
ample, staying up t<x> late or drinking
alcohol.
As for the inconveniences of dorm
life. Naomi says she is now so used to
the noise that she cannot fall asleep
without it. Some of the RFs have

soundproof rooms so that the noise
does not bother them. Instead of
being an inconvenience, they see liv
ing in such a situation as extremely ad
vantageous. They believe they have
many more opportunities available to
them than those who do not live in
such a setting, such as enjoying a vari
ety of cuisines in the dining hall,
watching plays and listening to many
different campus music groups.
Buffington says that it was initially
hard for Gabriel, who was just an in
fant when they moved in. He was
scared of having so many "tall people"
around and having to share his par
ents with so many kids. Now, he loves
it — it is like having an extended fam
ily. Because RFs work where they live,
their children have the added benefit
of having their parents around all the
time.
Buffington does not think that her
children are likely to attend Stanford,
whereas Naomi Shachter is applying
Early Action this fall.
"All my friends think 1 am at an ad
vantage while applying to Stanford
this year, but it is not true," she says.
"We do not get any advantage as RF
kids in our applications to Stanford."
Since they think that growing up in
a college dorm is a positive thing for
their children, the Branner RFs plan
to remain in this setting as long as they
can."When people find out that [Jesse
and Gabriel] have spent their child
hood years in a dorm on a campus, it is
always going to amaze them!"
The residents also love having RF
kids around the dorm.
"It makes a big dorm environment
like a family," says Branner resident
Christopher Anderson i 1.
Varun Sivaram '11 agrees, adding
that he envies children of RFs. "We
get to he around Stanford students for
four years," he says. "They get to be
around them forever."
