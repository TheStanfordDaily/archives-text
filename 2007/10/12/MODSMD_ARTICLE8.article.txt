## Faculty debate Rumsfeld Meyer Library demolition, new Beijing center also discussed 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Tension hung in the air at yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting, during which members discussed
former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's
recent appointment as a distinguished visiting fel
low at the Hoover Institution.
"If Rumsfeld had been appointed to the task
force, and just the task force, it wouldn't be a mat
ter." said Civil and Environmental Engineering
Prof. Jeffrey Koseff.
Other Senate members echoed Koseff's senti
ment. saying they would welcome Rumsfeld to
campus as a guest speaker, but not as a recipient
of an official title.
"I find it hard to understand the reasoning in
appointing Rumsfeld," said Philosophy Prof.
Debra Satz, "not because of his views, but be
cause of his competence."
A member of the Senate's steering committee,
Satz introduced a motion to hold a meeting
specifically to address the criteria used by the

Hoover Institution for its appointments. The mo
tion called for the Senate to invite Hoover Direc
tor John Raisian to answer questions about the
appointment process.
Before the vote. Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82 warned against thinking that Rums
feld's appointment involved an implicit endorse
ment from the University.
"1 think it's very important that we not think
that a visiting appointment involves an endorse
ment from Stanford," he said.
Etchemendy emphasized that the appoint
ment process of visitors is decentralized, as each
department — including Hoover — chooses
who to invite and what title to give each visitor.
"It's true that people from the outside [the
University] may think of it as an endorsement,"
Etchemendy said. "But the damage that would be
done by having people consider this an endorse
ment is far less than [that which would be done
by] having a centralized process."
Through her motion, Satz said she wanted to
better integrate Hoover and Stanford.
"I think of this as a step in creating a dialogue
so that we can be on the same page," she said.
Microbiology and Immunology Prof. John
Boothroyd moved to amend the motion by strik
ing a clause that addressed "the specific criteria

used in the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld to
a 'distinguished visiting fellowship."'
When the amendment deadlocked after an IS
IS vote. Faculty Senate Chair Eamonn Callan, a
professor of education, broke the tie with a vote
in opposition. The motion itself passed as well,
earning 25 votes to 12. Raisian will be invited to
attend the next regular Senate meeting on Oct.
25.
In other business. President John Hennessy
announced that the Stanford Challenge passed
the $3 billion mark on financial commitments as
of Oct. 10, which also marked the first anniver
sary of the Challenge.
"1 think the campaign has generated enthusi
asm in our alumni," Hennessy said, noting the
dozens of fellowships that have been endowed
for graduate and undergraduate students.
Another announcement mentioned the possi
bility of opening a Stanford center at Peking Uni
versity in Beijing. China. Rather than being an
undergraduate center akin to the Bing Overseas
Study Program facilities, the new center would
provide a research focus for graduate students
and faculty.
"Instead of bringing the world to
Stanford," I lennessy said, "we will
be bringing Stanford to the world."
Finally, when History Prof.
Philippe Buc asked about a rumor
he heard that Meyer Library would
be removed. Etchemendy told the
Senate that the building will be torn
down and replaced,but that plans to
do so are only in their nascent
stages.
"We plan to tear down Meyer
and replace it with a smaller build
ing." he said, earning a burst of ap
plause from the Senate.
