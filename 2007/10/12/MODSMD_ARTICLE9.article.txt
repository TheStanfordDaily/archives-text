figure responsible for "revitalizing the whole history of
animation."
Katzenberg first served as CEO of The Walt Disney
Company before founding Dream Works in IW4 with

Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. Since then,
Katzenberg has directed the company's animation di
vision. creating movies including "The Prince of
Egypt" and "Madagascar."
In the conversation, Katzenberg highlighted "Bee
Movie," a November release starring "some guy
named Jerry Seinfeld," according to Bukatman.
Katzenberg recalled the difficulties of convincing
the comedian to sign on to an animated project.
"He always said no," Katzenberg said. "I had to try
new tactics."
Though he continued to refuse, Katzenberg won
him over in the end.
"I don't believe in the word no,'" the Dream Works
CEO said later in the event when giving advice about
his business tactics."The best I'll accept is'not yet.'"

Jeffrey Katzenberg signs a poster for Dream Works' upcoming "Bee Movie" outside Kresge yesterday. The ani
mation CEO showed a clip from the film and discussed the future of both computer and traditional animation.
"It's the first time where an estab
lished force has come into animation
like this," he said of Seinfeld's deci
sion to do the film."ln every respect,
it's his movie."
In the latter half of the event,
Katzenberg focused on the future of
animation and the theatre experi
ence.
"(There is] something lifeless

about it,"he said in reference to mo
tion-capture, the technique behind
such movies as "The Polar Express."
"An interesting technique, but not
successful."
Katzenberg was enthusiastic,
however, about pursuing the full po
tential of a technology that he and
other Hollywood figures believe
could revolutionize films.
"Black and white to color is the
last truly big innovation, and that was
60 to 70 years ago." he said. "A quali
ty 3-D experience; that's the next
frontier. It's closer to the fidelity of
what we actually see. What we're

doing is the first big step."
Despite talk of the future, Katzen
berg commented that "2-D is not a
dead art form." For the moment,
though, he remains content with
keeping his focus on computer ani
mation.
"We're telling the stories we want
to tell," he added.
Katzenberg made room for
humor in his discussion, saying only
the words "Jack Black" and " kung Fu
Panda" as hype for another upcoming
Dream Works animation project.
"Anywhere 1 say that.it works." he
said as laughter died down.
Art and Art I listory Prof. Kristine
Samuelson organized the event as
part of an ongoing series of film-re
lated speakers that has included
Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director of
"Amelie," and Sigourney Weaver.
Whether discussing the tradition
al or computer-generated films.
Katzenberg was clear about the ex
ample that he follows.
"Walt Disney dropped bread
crumbs the size of Volkswagens," lie
said."l just retraced the template."
