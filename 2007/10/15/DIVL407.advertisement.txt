The Bingham Fund for Student Innovation
in Human Biology
HThe Bingham Foundation generously provides funds that support inno
vative student projects proposed by Human Biology majors intended to
benefit undergraduate education. Past awardees include:
2001 Christine Zenner, "The Wisdom Project". This project was a two-day conference of speakers and activ
ities that was designed to help individuals think about end-of-life issues in a constructive way. Christine has been
accepted at Yale to pursue a Ph.D. in Religious Ethics. She is co-editor and author of the Introduction of a book,
Expanding Horizons in Bioethics, to be released this month from Springer Academic Publishers.
2002 Helene Mik, "Going Crazy" This project organized a colloquium with a panel of experts and survivors
of severe mental illness. It's purpose was to educate students about the experience of mental illness, the prevalence of
mental health problems on campus, and how policy has affected the mentally ill in the surrounding community.
2002 Janice Chyou, "Interact: Understanding and enriching Interpersonal Relationships" This was a
student-led class that sought to allow Stanford students to learn about and re-evaluate their personal relationships.
The course was designed so that students learned about specific issues (such as race and religion) that affect person
i al relationships and then to motivate students to apply those ideas to their own lives, both within and outside of
Stanford.
2003 present Jonathan Olsen, a Hum Bio junior in 2003, proposed to publish "The Stanford Scientific
Review." This successful journal has continued to be published by Stanford students each year since its inception!
This proposal was to produce an innovative journal with the dual goals of providing a framework for students to
exercise writing, editorial and photography skills, while bringing to the community information about new scientific
discoveries.
2005 Chuan-Mei Lee, "What do you Think?" This was a weekly radio talk show with interviews Stanford
faculty, staff and students to foster discussions in science, health, and society.
1 2006 Tamar Berger, "A Veterans' Affair: The Biomedical, Social, and Economic Impact of War" This
was a student-initiated course that sought to enlighten students about the social, psychological, and biological
impacts of war through a multifaceted approach —guest lectures, readings, seminar discussions, and community
service.
2007 Ada Yee, "Stanford Journal of Neuroscience: A COSIGN Publication" This is a publication that will
showcase Stanford student research and writings, hence serving as a resource and inspiration for students who are
interested in neuroscience.
2008 Laura Carwile, "thinkßlG Conference" The thinkßlG conference aims to inspire students to action by
critically looking at the health situations of women and girls in poorer countries. Our vision is a campus-wide week
end event in which students with diverse interests throughout the Stanford community focus on the issues surround
ing international women's health and human rights through speeches, film, student group performances, informa
tion panels, opportunity fairs and more. The ultimate goal is to mobilize our generation-from the diplomat to the
doctor to the "check-writer of tomorrow"--to step up to the challenges of the future and work to improve the situa
tion of women throughout the developing world
