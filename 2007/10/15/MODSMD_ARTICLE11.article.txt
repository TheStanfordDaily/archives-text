# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Caffeine pills available on campus 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
This fall, many students were surprised to find

caffeine pills at a Stanford dining location. En-

ergy Zone, a new kiosk selling smoothies and
energy bars in the Wilbur dining hall, also of
fers bottles of Met-Rx"Amped Up" caffeine
pills. Each softgel contains 1(X) mg of caf-

feine, as much as a shot of espresso.

"Really?" said Christine Feigal '08. "1
don't know how I feel about that."

Katherine Brainard. M.S. '08 was more di
rect. "Caffeinating the stressed-out fresh-

men may not be the best idea," she
said.

Beyond caffeine pills. Energy
Zone provides students with an
alternative to the fruit smooth-

ies found elsewhere on cam
pus.

"1 go here probably every
other day," said Paula
Chidester '11, sipping a mango

smoothie. "Some of their

smoothies have half the calories of
smoothies at Jamba Juice. Plus,

there's never a line."
Energy Zone is owned by the At-

lanta-based company Freshens. In an
email to The Daily, area general man-

j -• c,
ager Terry Navahandi explained that the Energy Zone at
Wilbur is a franchise, like Peet's Coffee and Subway in
Tresidder.
Freshens has a partnership with Met-Rx Engineered
Nutrition, a nutritional supplement company that pro
vides "lifestyle boosters" — multicolored tablets that
add extra nutrients to each smoothie. Students can
choose from seven different boosts: Extreme Focus,
Super Lean, Mega Energy E, Superfood, Sports Perfor
mance, Protein and Green tea.
A rolodex-like booklet on the counter gives nutrition

al information about all the boosters Most boosters con
tain caffeine. Others contain the amino acid tyrosine; vi
tamins like niacin, B6 and B12; the element chromium;

the organic acid taurine; or the plant-derived

wheat grass, alfalfa and barley grass.

The informational booklet
touts health benefits of the smoothies,
but it also contains this asterisked
I warning: "These statements have
112 not been evaluated by the Food and
Drug Administration.This product is
not intended to diagnose, treat,cure or
prevent any disease."

The warning stems from the
1994 Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act, which classi
fies nutritional supplements as
food, not drugs. As long as

- c — c»
manufacturers do not claim
that their supplement treats
any diseases, they are not re
quired to demonstrate their
product's safety and effec
tiveness, and the FDA can

only take action if a supple
ment is proven to be harmful.

Asked for comment, Nava-

handi stressed that the Met-Rx
boosters are optional and the ingredi
ents are clearly labeled.

"Stanford Dining has not heard of any
concerns," he wrote. "Boosters are a common offering of
most nationally recognized smoothie retailers. Met-Rx is
a well known nutritional supplement company that sells
its products at GNC and other similar health food and
supplement stores."
And as for caffeine, the stimulant is no stranger to
most Stanford students. Amy Xue '10 got a caffeinated
energy booster in her strawberry-banana smoothie.
"1 have a lot of work to do this afternoon," she said.
