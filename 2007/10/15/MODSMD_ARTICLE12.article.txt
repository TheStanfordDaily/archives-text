## A 						pioneer house's reunion One of the nation's first co-ed houses looks back

Co-educational living is a stan
dard of college life today, as male and
female students alike walk the halls
in disheveled pajamas without hat
ting an eye. But while most Stanford
dorms currently house students of
both sexes, the 1%7 opening of the
Grove House — one of the first co
ed houses at an American university
— was so radical that Grove was
dubbed the "Grove Project" or
"Grove Experiment' in campus mag
azine articles at the time.
Saturday morning, the original
residents of Grove House held a
breakfast reunion forty years after
the house first opened. Grove was
most famous for mixing men and
women in the same house on campus
for the first time, but it was also the
first to mix students of different class
years.
Grove House opened in January
1967 when the Phi Delta Theta fra

ternity was deprived of housing for
campus rule infractions, wrote Phil
Taubman 'W, a resident of the house
during its inaugural year, in an email
to The Daily. When faced with an
empty house, the Stanford adminis
tration and Board of Trustees agreed
to set up a social experiment in which
a select group of men and women
would live together. The focus of the
house would be on academics.
Ultimately, 43 candidates — 31
men and 12 women — were selected
from a pool of applicants. Efforts
were made to ensure that residents
came from a variety of backgrounds
and concentrations to fuel an intel
lectual interchange.
"Dinner was always a very impor
tant event at Grove," Taubman said.
"There were wine and white table
cloths and we had our own chef. It
was all to ensure that dinner would
be a formal time for intellectual con
versation."
"The name of Grove actually
came from the metaphor 'groves of
academia,'" said Jon Reider '67, an
other resident.
The politically-charged atmos
phere of the campus during the Viet

nam War had a strong presence at
Grove House, where one resident
posted anti-war posters all over the
front hall. The posters attacked the
University's involvement in the war,
Reider said.
"The population at the Grove
House was disproportionately
protest-oriented and left-leaning,"
said active environmentalist Lenny
Siegel '70, the student who put up the
poster that initiated the "Great
Poster War." "If you haven't noticed,
a lot of us here at the reunion are
now activists."
"To me. Grove was special be
cause of the people," Taubman said.
"The professors that lived there or
visited treated us as adults and
equals. We were always on first-name
basis."
Marjorie Cohn '70 cited the close
proximity of the male and female
students as a reason for the mature
atmosphere at Grove.
"Before Grove, men and women
were kept strictly separate." Cohn
said. "Each gender saw the opposite

as incomprehensible. The only way
for men and women to meet was
through a ridiculous 'Dating Game.'
At Grove, men and women learned
to see each other as people."
Despite its choice to open the
Grove House, the University was
nonetheless concerned about co-ed
living. Male and female students were
only allowed to visit each other at cer
tain times of the day, and a door that
only opened one way separated the
male and female wings of the house.
"All the boys and girls treated
each other solely as brothers and sis
ters," Reider said facetiously.
l\vo couples who met at Grove are
now married.
The success of the "Grove Exper
iment" paved the way for additional
co-ed housing at Stanford. Within
five years of the house's inception,
most University dorms were co-ed.
"It was the beginning of a trend,"
Reider said.
