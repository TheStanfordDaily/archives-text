## Stanford joins IBM, Google for program 
### KAMIL DADA 
Last Monday, Google and IBM
publicly announced plans to take
"cloud computing" to a higher
level.The two computer industry ti
tans will provide distributed com
puting resources to Stanford and
five other schools as part of a pilot
program.
"Cloud computing" is a model
by which computer processing is
split up over two or more comput
ers over the Internet. Computer
processing power can be distrib
uted over many different comput
ers, all over the world.
"For this project, several hun
dred processors have been allocat
ed in data centers which students
and professors can access via the
Internet," Andrew Pederson, a
spokesperson for Google's Corpo
rate Communications division, told
rhe I )aily.
With the initiative. IBM and
Google have partnered on a "scale
never seen before," said Dennis
Quan. the project's chief architect
at IBM and a specialist in high per
formance computing solutions.
"This project combines IBM's
historic strengths in scientific, busi
ness and secure-transaction com
puting with Google's complemen
tary expertise in massive, highly
parallel computing," Pederson said.
"It is a very strategic relation
ship on all mindsets from the very
highest level, to advance the field of
distributed computing," Ouan
added.
The two companies have set up
a number of data centers with
servers in the IBM and Google
headquarters, as well as at the Uni
versity of Washington, the first
school to join the initiative. These
data centers will do all the comput
er processing in a "virtual lab" and
then send the results back to stu
dents and faculty at participating
universities. Quan explained.
In addition to Stanford and the
University of Washington,
Carnegie Mellon University. Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology.
IJC-Berkeley and the University of
Maryland have also signed on to
the pilot program.
Consulting computer science
faculty member Sepandar Kamvar,
also the technical lead of personal

ization at Google, told The Daily he
will use the new platform in his data
mining class.
"I plan to make extensive use of
it as part of the course," he said in an
email, "The student projects will be
done on the data center comput
ers."
I le added that he was interested
in using the data centers to teach
"very large-scale data mining, look
ing for trends in hundreds of mil
lions to billions of data items."
Both Google and IBM hold the
view that an active connection with
the academic world is mutually
beneficial for corporations and aca
demia. By training future engi
neers. companies can ensure that
the next generation of their em
ployees is adequately trained and
prepared for their jobs.
"IBM has a long standing com
mitment to having a relationship
with academia." Quan explained.
"This serves our best interests as
well as society in general because it
ensures that the next generation of
engineers will be well prepared in
the area of Web 2.0 computing skill
set. an area where they currently
lack the skills needed "
"Google owes a kit to the aca
demic community," Pederson said,
"and in order to close the techno
logical gap between industry and
academia, professors and students
need to be exposed to this emerg
ing paradigm of massive, highly
parallel computing."
Even though the data centers
are located off site, there are no se
curity or privacy issues at stake.
"There are no plans to put sensi
tive Stanford information on this
remote cluster." William Dally,
chair of the computer science de
partment, wrote in an email to The
Dail>
At the moment, Stanford is not
making the data clusters an integral
part of the courses offered, and
only Kamvar's course plans to use
it. But that could change.
"If this is successful,other cours
es may make use of the cluster."
Dally said "However, it will most
likely be used as a tool, not as a
major focus for a course."
