Memory is a powerful thing. Scores of
alumni wandered campus this
weekend, waxing eloquent about
their fond memories of Stanford's past as
part of the annual Homecoming festivities.
And while there is indeed a rich legacy for
this great university to celebrate, it is also
important that we accept, address and em
brace the uncomfortable and tragic truths of
our institution's history.
Every Stanford tour group is told how
the Stanfords built the University as a me
morial to their son. Leland Jr., who died pre
maturely of typhoid at age 15. and how Le
land Stanford declared, "the children of Cal
ifornia shall be our children." Few. however,
are informed of the more controversial ele
ments of Stanford's past.
In his 1862 inauguration speech as gover
nor of California, Stanford perpetuated the
rampant prejudice and racism toward Chi
nese immigrants when he said, "to my mind
it is clear, that the settlement among us of an
inferior race is to be discouraged, by every
legitimate means. Asia, with her numberless
millions,sends to our shores the dregs of her
population."
As the University's Web site tells it, Stan
ford. president of the Central Pacific Rail
road. was a visionary Sacramento business
man determined to build the western part of
the transcontinental railroad, where "the
steep, snow-covered slopes of the Sierra
Nevada could just as easily turn the builders
into bankrupt paupers as princes of indus
try." Yet it was not Stanford who was moving
mountains to make way for the railroad —
it was thousands of immigrant Chinese
workers.
These immigrant laborers once laid 10
miles of track in a single day — an unprece
dented feat — despite being paid only two
thirds what white workers earned. Stanford
himself wrote,"more prudent and economi
cal, they are contented with less wages."
When the Chinese protested, their food and
water were cut off.
Workers routinely fell to their deaths or
were caught in explosions while paving the
way for the railway. In another instance,
workers were caught in snowstorms while
building a tunnel; when the snow thawed,
some bodies were found still gripping their
shovels.
The history of Chinese railroad workers
and Stanford is not black and white, howev
er. Stanford wrote that the Chinese were,
"quiet, peaceable, patient, industrious and

economical — ready and apt to learn all the
different kinds of work required in railroad
building... as efficient as white laborers." Ile
declared that, "no system similar to slavery,
serfdom or peonage prevails among these
laborers," and according to Earl Heath's
book "Trail to Rail," Stanford had such re
spect for the Chinese workers that in his will
he provided for the permanent employment
of many,some of whom lived and worked on
Stanford land through the 19305.
Stanford used his economic and political
clout to benefit the Bay Area. In addition to
creating our University, Stanford also over
saw the establishment of what would later
become San Jose State University and
helped organize the Sacramento Library
Association, which became the Sacramento
Public Library. As Governor, he halved the
state's debt and advocated for the conserva
tion of forests. He was a delegate for the
1860 Republican National Convention that
elected Abraham Lincoln, and his railroad
was instrumental to the nation's growth.
Stanford's many philanthropic contribu
tions are unquestionable, and his views to
ward Chinese workers were the 19th centu
ry status quo. But a 21st century lens blurs
the picture; how do we reconcile our con
flicted past?
We can do it through education — taking
classes like History Prof. Gordon Chang's
Introduction to American History, or ex
ploring the history of the transcontinental
railroad in Introductory Seminars. We can
do it through community service, through
Haas Center fellowships and activism in
contemporary social action issues. We can
work and study and invent with a little his
torical perspective in mind.
A painting in the Cantor Arts Center
shows several indistinct Chinese servants
hovering in the background of a portrait of
the Stanford family; like this painting, the
portrait of Leland Stanford is a complex
one, as is the issue of historical justice and
restitution. Chang, who begins his class
with Stanford's "dregs of Asia" quote, be
lieves that, "we should not dwell on the
past, or use it to inflame attitudes in the
present. We should look forward to the fu
ture and understand our history in a con
structive way."
That means embracing the complex his
tory of our university and cultivating its spir
it of entrepreneurship. social justice and en
gagement with the world. For better or for
worse, we are all Stanford's children.
