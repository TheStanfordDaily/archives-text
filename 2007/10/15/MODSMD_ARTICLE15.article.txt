# Public Editor

There have been two serious incidents
in the past few weeks where The Daily
has published misleading articles.
On Oct. 4, The Daily published a front
page article ("Admins review Gaieties"]
claiming that writers were "required to show
the whole script" of Gaieties to Nanci Howe,
student affairs officer in the Office of Stu
dent Activities, and Julie Lythcott-Haims'B9,
dean of freshmen and transfer students. This
was not accurate. The Daily ran a correction
and then published a letter to the editor by
Gaieties producer Stefan Vraspir '09, who
said that the Gaieties staff actually chose to
show the script to administrators.
Then, last Thursday, political science doc
toral candidate Kai Stinchcombe published
a column ("Rumsfeld and other Hoover In
stitution kooks"| disparaging Donald Rums
feld's appointment to the Hoover Institu
tion. His column consisted of a list of some of
the "most controversial local screed-writers
who Donald Rumsfeld will be joining at
Hoover." Notably featured in this list were
Dinesh D'Souza and Laura Ingraham. The
problem is, neither of them is currently affil
iated with Hoover — though both were in
some capacity in the past. Again, Hie Daily
ran a correction, and published a very critical
letter to the editor by Tristan Abbey '08.
Why did these mistakes occur? I didn't
know much about how The Daily works be
hind the scenes, so I took the opportunity to
sit down with editor-in-chief Nick Parker
and have him explain it to me. I hope this will
both demystify the production process in
general and explain how these articles
slipped through the cracks.
The planning process for an issue begins
as much as four days beforehand. In the
news section, there is a desk editor for each
night of the week. (Hie other sections —
sports, opinions. Page I\vo and Intermission
— follow somewhat different procedures
from what I will describe.) For the Thursday
paper, the Wednesday night desk editor will
start sending out story ideas as early as Sun
day. After approval by managing editor of
news Julie Klein, who coordinates with the
other desk editors to make sure there is no

overlap, the desk editor then looks for a
writer, either asking a writer individually or
sending it to a general list for news writers,
where it's first-come, first-served. (Impor
tant articles aren't sent out to this list.There
is a core of about six to eight top writers
whom Parker or Klein will choose. Ihis core,
Parker says, is based on talent. "The hierar
chy here is merit-based; seniority means
nothing")
Some articles, of course, don't fit this
timeline, but surprisingly many do. Parker
estimates that only about 40 percent of the
articles are time-sensitive, and many of these
can still be planned ahead of time. T or exam
ple, The Daily knows days ahead of time
about ASSU Senate meetings or important
speakers on campus. Only about one article
a week is unexpected, breaking news. For
these. The Daily always has a senior staff
writer on-call.
Articles are normally due at 6 p.m. the
night before they appear (though they tend
to trickle in until around 8 p.m.. Parker says).
Each writer is supposed to come to the I )aily
office, where they go over their article with
the desk editor and then leave.The article is
then edited by the managing editor and the
copy editor for the night. Finally, Parker
reads the most important articles, including
the main news articles, the editorial and any
potentially inflammatory columns.
Meanwhile, the articles are being sent to
the type-setter to be laid-out. Once the arti
cles are typeset, the desk editor writes head
lines and captions.The copy editor and Park
er then carefully check the headlines and
send the pages to the printer. ITie whole
paper is usually finished by around 2 a.m.
Ihe paper is sent to a printer in Redwood
City,which prints 10,000 copies. A third party
contractor delivers the paper to locations
around campus — usually by around 7:30
a.m.. which is more than early enough for
most students, though sometimes it will be as
late as 9 a.m.
vSo what went wrong with the Gaieties ar
ticle? The writers leave once they've finished
