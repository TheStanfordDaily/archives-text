There have been two serious incidents
in the past few weeks where The Daily
has published misleading articles.
On Oct. 4, The Daily published a front
page article ("Admins review Gaieties"]
claiming that writers were "required to show
the whole script" of Gaieties to Nanci Howe,
student affairs officer in the Office of Stu
dent Activities, and Julie Lythcott-Haims'B9,
dean of freshmen and transfer students. This
was not accurate. The Daily ran a correction
and then published a letter to the editor by
Gaieties producer Stefan Vraspir '09, who
said that the Gaieties staff actually chose to
show the script to administrators.
Then, last Thursday, political science doc
toral candidate Kai Stinchcombe published
a column ("Rumsfeld and other Hoover In
stitution kooks"| disparaging Donald Rums
feld's appointment to the Hoover Institu
tion. His column consisted of a list of some of
the "most controversial local screed-writers
who Donald Rumsfeld will be joining at
Hoover." Notably featured in this list were
Dinesh D'Souza and Laura Ingraham. The
problem is, neither of them is currently affil
iated with Hoover — though both were in
some capacity in the past. Again, Hie Daily
ran a correction, and published a very critical
letter to the editor by Tristan Abbey '08.
Why did these mistakes occur? I didn't
know much about how The Daily works be
hind the scenes, so I took the opportunity to
sit down with editor-in-chief Nick Parker
and have him explain it to me. I hope this will
both demystify the production process in
general and explain how these articles
slipped through the cracks.
The planning process for an issue begins
as much as four days beforehand. In the
news section, there is a desk editor for each
night of the week. (Hie other sections —
sports, opinions. Page I\vo and Intermission
— follow somewhat different procedures
from what I will describe.) For the Thursday
paper, the Wednesday night desk editor will
start sending out story ideas as early as Sun
day. After approval by managing editor of
news Julie Klein, who coordinates with the
other desk editors to make sure there is no

overlap, the desk editor then looks for a
writer, either asking a writer individually or
sending it to a general list for news writers,
where it's first-come, first-served. (Impor
tant articles aren't sent out to this list.There
is a core of about six to eight top writers
whom Parker or Klein will choose. Ihis core,
Parker says, is based on talent. "The hierar
chy here is merit-based; seniority means
nothing")
Some articles, of course, don't fit this
timeline, but surprisingly many do. Parker
estimates that only about 40 percent of the
articles are time-sensitive, and many of these
can still be planned ahead of time. T or exam
ple, The Daily knows days ahead of time
about ASSU Senate meetings or important
speakers on campus. Only about one article
a week is unexpected, breaking news. For
these. The Daily always has a senior staff
writer on-call.
Articles are normally due at 6 p.m. the
night before they appear (though they tend
to trickle in until around 8 p.m.. Parker says).
Each writer is supposed to come to the I )aily
office, where they go over their article with
the desk editor and then leave.The article is
then edited by the managing editor and the
copy editor for the night. Finally, Parker
reads the most important articles, including
the main news articles, the editorial and any
potentially inflammatory columns.
Meanwhile, the articles are being sent to
the type-setter to be laid-out. Once the arti
cles are typeset, the desk editor writes head
lines and captions.The copy editor and Park
er then carefully check the headlines and
send the pages to the printer. ITie whole
paper is usually finished by around 2 a.m.
Ihe paper is sent to a printer in Redwood
City,which prints 10,000 copies. A third party
contractor delivers the paper to locations
around campus — usually by around 7:30
a.m.. which is more than early enough for
most students, though sometimes it will be as
late as 9 a.m.
vSo what went wrong with the Gaieties ar
ticle? The writers leave once they've finished
going over their article with the desk
editor. Often, however, the managing
editor and editor-in-chief have to
rewrite and rework parts of the story,
and the headlines are written long
after the writer is gone.This is part of
what happened with the Gaieties
story. The original version of the arti
cle did not mention the required
"script approval" that appeared in
the headline, and was more ambigu
ous.
Still, the original version of the ar
ticle was inherently flawed. Its sole
source for what happened was writer
Chade Severin 07. There was no
comment from Howe or Lythcott-
Haims, nor from Gaieties producer
Vraspir, who in his letter to the editor
contradicted claims that appeared
even in the original version. Parker
admits that The Daily messed up
badly, but he's also right in pointing
out that it was an important story to
cover, even if the script review wasn't

required. It's a shame, then, that the
editors didn't hold the story until
they could report it accurately after
having heard from all sides. Gaieties
isn't for another six weeks, and a
short delay in publication wouldn't
have made the story any less rele
vant.
Though the article would have
been problematic even in its original
form, the fact that the late-night edit
ing exacerbated the errors raises seri
ous concerns. I here needs to be more
communication between writers and
late-night editors. Perhaps writers
should be required to check in
around midnight to ensure that any
last-minute edits didn't introduce in
accuracies; this could be done elec
tronically and would only take a few
minutes for the writer. Furthermore,
it's troubling that articles apparently
often need such major revision and
rewriting by senior editors. Though
it's a challenge to train and keep tal
ented writers, it's important that The
Daily hold high standards and work
to reach a point where this doesn't
have to happen.
I"he problem with Stinchcombe's
Hoover piece is that no one checked

the facts. The Daily doesn't have the
resources to employ a fact-checker to
confirm details of stories; copy edi
tors focus mostly on grammatical and
spelling matters. For non-news arti
cles especially, the onus is on the
writer to make sure everything is ac
curate. Parker says that the opinions
editors have met with and talked to
Stinchcombe. who I hope will be
more careful with his future columns.
One final point to draw from these
incidents is the important role that
readers play in policing The Daily. It's
important that Vraspir and Abbey
sent their letters. If you think The
Daily has reported the news unfairly
or inaccurately, or if you think a col
umn or editorial is disingenuous, write
a letter to the editor.The Daily messed
up seriously in these two articles. At
least it has a system in place to catch
and correct errors, but this system de
pends on careful readers like you.
