# Little Ms. Modern
## Nostalgia: Just say no! 
### 
Remember how much better things were
back in the good ol' days? Back before
all these troubling novelties like gen
der equality, modern medicine, and the Inter
net? Neither do I.and it's not because I wasn't
born until 1984. Ihings weren't better back
then, you silly neophobes. and romanticizing
the past portends a frightening future. But we
all learned this back in tenth grade I lonors
History (Hi. Mrs. Bryer!),so I shan't wax po
etic. Suffice it to say that you wouldn't be
reading this enlightening coiunin were we all
back in the time when the woman's realm and
the person's realm were considered distinct.
Yes. now is a pretty sweet time to be alive
forjust about all of us. unless you happen tobe
from a royal blood line or perhaps are an es
pecially old-fashioned bigot. Considering this,
I confess I'm baffled by that little societal
habit we just can't seem to kick. No. not Amer
ican Idol â€” I'm talking about our boundless
propensity for nostalgia.
It lurks in every corner! We listen to our
parents' music (You're not talkin' "bout my
generation. Roger Daltrey!), pick up our
grandparents' hobbies (knitting!), and live in

bastardized versions of our great-...-great
grandparents' houses (Don't get me started!).
We wear t-shirts advertising the 1963 Table
Tennis Championship in Akron. Ohio that we
probably purchased from Old Navy. We buy
our jeans pre-washed, pre-faded, and even
pre-pulverized in hopes of injecting the au
thenticity of the old into fabric that is young.
We (and by "we," I mean "you" in this case)
watch a show called "The Simple Life," in
which modern celebutantes take on unmod
ern tasks like milking cows.
TWo things about this social phenomenon
strike me. First is the obvious irony of pretend
ing that new things are old to make them feel
legitimate. Faux-vintage is, of course, illegiti
mate by all accounts. But even our love affair

with the genuinely old sits uneasily with me.
Yes, The Beatles may very well have hit the
peak of pop musical development for the
foreseeable future. However, our more gratu
itous nostalgic tendencies are also so well-cul
tivated that they overcrowd the patch of dirt
where the new and improved might otherwise
blossom. (Speaking of gratuitous, how do you
like that metaphor? Or this attempt at a witty
aside? Oh,self-reference,my favorite modern
invention.)
So why might we insist on stomping out the
flower bed of development ? As a devoted
Darwinian (and an enthusiastic, but patheti
cally amateur sociologist), I'm inclined to look
for some evolutionary advantage that encour
ages this initially puzzling behavior to flour
ish. And indeed, resistance to change does
come in handy in the survival of our species,
even in a system propelled forward by muta
tion and variation. You see, it safeguards us
against especially moronic behavior like
abandoning fire, the wheel, social organiza
tion, and all those other useful, well-estab-

lished tools and conventions that
hold us together.
It also seems to work like air fric
tion: when change occurs relatively
slowly, we resist it relatively calmly.
But when change starts ripping
through society at a blistering pace,
we clamp down and oppose it with a
much stronger force. (Too nerdy of an
analogy for you? 1 can do much, much
worse...)
If I had to characterize modernity
in eight words, they would be "change
ripping through society at a blistering
pace," so it's not so surprising that we
grasp for the past to maintain our
sense of stability. More erudite schol
ars than 1 have described modernity
as chaotic, volatile, bleak, violent, up
rooting, and alienating. In wiping out
tradition, we strip ourselves of our en
tire preexisting infrastructure of
meaning, value, and connectedness.
The modern world is a difficult one,
for sure.
But as 1 tried to illustrate in this ar
ticle's catchy opening paragraph, the
preexisting infrastructure sucked in a

lot of ways. What an opportunity
modernity offers to start afresh at
constructing a better one! In our dis
comfort at being denizens of a turbu
lent time, let's not cop out by retreat
ing to our comfortable but usually
bad habits. The past is helpful not in
providing a template to replicate, but
in providing lessons about what
works, and more typically, what does
not.
To put it succinctly. 1 see nostalgia
as the societal version of fantasizing
about a reunion with that ex you
know is trouble (note to real-life exes:
this is not necessarily autobiographi
cal!). When we cling to idealized
memories of how things used to be,
we keep ourselves from truly experi
encing the present and from prepar
ing for the future. As every architect's
darling, Corbu. noted in 1930,
"Happy are they who can discern the
profound poetry of modern times."
You're sure to have a hard time dis
cerning that profound poetry if you
immerse yourself exclusively in
ninth-century verse.

If you noticed the irony of Caitlin's ar
ticle title referencing a IVNOs advertising
campaign, you're probably Iter sold
mate, and should email her right away:
