## Reefer falseness 
### 
I know two sides to Jessica. One side can he
summed up in her eyes. They're a blazing
green, and her eyes shift with the sh;irp
accuracy of her quick wit. She is articulate,
funny, and intelligent. She excels in the class
room and can be counted on for enlightening
conversations. As an impressionable fresh
man, I looked to her as a role model.
"Jessica — Version 2" I met months later,
but she can be found alongside me ;it self-op
parties and underneath open Franzia taps.
Her energy livens up any social situation.
However, later during freshman year when I
found out that she smoked pot. I was floored.
Not that partying with alcohol and partying
with weed are worlds apart. But her academ
ic prowess and razor sharp humor jarred with
my vision of the slow-motion pothead burn
out.
I'm not the only person who has been
overwhelmed by the seemingly disparate

characteristics of Jessica's personality. One
fellow student might know her as the "an
noying" girl who sits in the front row asking
all of the questions. Another might know Jes
sica from keg stands and smoke circles. When
her two spheres collide, you get situations
like the following: In the company of one of
her social compatriots. Jessica raised a ques
tion in class regarding footnote 31. After the
lecture finished,she was met with the follow
ing comment,"You read the footnotes. I did

n't know you did class."
On campus, the stigma of pot smoking
lingers in the air far heavier than a recently
exhaled joint. While alcohol is Stanford's ac
cepted drug of choice, flirting with Mary Jane
often elicits offended outcries. And while
some would argue that smoking marijuana is
less detrimental to one's health than alcohol,
subsets of Stanford s culture still equate
weed with degenerate motivation and
morality In addition to the unjust assump
tions of her poor academic performance due
to herbal recreation, Jessica recalls being at a
200 person graduation party last year where
she slunk around asking for a lighter to the
disapproval of upturned noses. A fellow
Stanford student even asked her how many
people she d slept with and then scoffed
when the number she reported was "too low"

— because obviously if Jessica
smoked pot, her bed must be pretty
active as well.
But I want to attack these stig
mas, not from Jessica's perspective,
but, from the perspective of those
upturned noses. I, too, used to think
that smoking weed was (for lack of a
better word) bad.
Like many other students at Stan
ford, 1 came from a hometown where
getting ahead meant steering clear of
drug and alcohol culture. The
partiers at my high school had slept
with more people in our class than
they got points on history tests, and
the kids who got high during lunch
were the same ones failing out of
their Special Education classes.
There was no healthy medium. It was
either upward bound and dry or spi
raling down into a pool of corruption
and sin (to be a little over-dramatic).
I arrived at college still carrying

many presumptions about drugs and
the people who used them. My high
school experience, media's images of
reclined junkies, and D.A.R.E.'s in
doctrination had trained my mind to
think that drugs could never exist
within the pristine upper echelon of
success known as Stanford Universi
ty-
Then I met Jessica, the first of
many other smokers 1 would meet
while at Stanford, who began to
break down my pre-collegiate asso
ciations. Still, the many repeated re
actions like Jessica's presumptuous
classmate show that many others on
campus have yet to realize that
recreational drugs and ambition can
happily coexist.
1 blame the divide between social
and academic spheres for the perpet
uation of Stanford's ganjaphobia.
Theories and ideas are exchanged in
classes, not blunts. And benzene
rings rarely make a debut around the
Maypole at Synergy. Doing so would
break the culture of each respective
environment. However, the individ
uals who exist in both spheres are the
same person: The girl asking annoy

ing questions in class is also the girl
making a gravity bong out of a dis
carded lemon juice bottle. And while
bringing up that bowl you smoked
last night in front of a Nobel Prize
winner might seem inappropriate, it
is exactly this act that would lead to
wards a more realistic and embrac
ing culture.
The stigmatization of pot —
shaped by high school flunkies,
D.A.R.E., and Lifetime after-school
specials — doesn't apply to the di
verse student body we take for
granted at Stanford. While burn-outs
still exist on the other side of Palm
Drive, finding them on campus
proves a challenge. Correlations go
up in smoke when your sample pop
ulation represents an elite one-per
cent of humanity. So. to Jessica's
classmates, I encourage you to ques
tion the conclusions you make about
Jessica the next time you see her
light up, because chances are, you're
wrong.
