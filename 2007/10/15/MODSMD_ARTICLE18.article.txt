## Reefer falseness 
### 
I know two sides to Jessica. One side can he
summed up in her eyes. They're a blazing
green, and her eyes shift with the sh;irp
accuracy of her quick wit. She is articulate,
funny, and intelligent. She excels in the class
room and can be counted on for enlightening
conversations. As an impressionable fresh
man, I looked to her as a role model.
"Jessica â€” Version 2" I met months later,
but she can be found alongside me ;it self-op
parties and underneath open Franzia taps.
Her energy livens up any social situation.
However, later during freshman year when I
found out that she smoked pot. I was floored.
Not that partying with alcohol and partying
with weed are worlds apart. But her academ
ic prowess and razor sharp humor jarred with
my vision of the slow-motion pothead burn
out.
I'm not the only person who has been
overwhelmed by the seemingly disparate

characteristics of Jessica's personality. One
fellow student might know her as the "an
noying" girl who sits in the front row asking
all of the questions. Another might know Jes
sica from keg stands and smoke circles. When
her two spheres collide, you get situations
like the following: In the company of one of
her social compatriots. Jessica raised a ques
tion in class regarding footnote 31. After the
lecture finished,she was met with the follow
ing comment,"You read the footnotes. I did

n't know you did class."
On campus, the stigma of pot smoking
lingers in the air far heavier than a recently
exhaled joint. While alcohol is Stanford's ac
cepted drug of choice, flirting with Mary Jane
often elicits offended outcries. And while
some would argue that smoking marijuana is
less detrimental to one's health than alcohol,
subsets of Stanford s culture still equate
weed with degenerate motivation and
morality In addition to the unjust assump
tions of her poor academic performance due
to herbal recreation, Jessica recalls being at a
200 person graduation party last year where
she slunk around asking for a lighter to the
disapproval of upturned noses. A fellow
Stanford student even asked her how many
people she d slept with and then scoffed
when the number she reported was "too low"
