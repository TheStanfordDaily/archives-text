## Grab Stanford's mental health stigma by the horns 
### 
To many on campus, it might seem as if last
year played host to an abnormally high
number of campus mental health "cases."
And yet, the number of student issues was most
likely no higher than average. Only [last year],
people were paying attention.
Now that students have been exposed to vari
eties of personal backgrounds, health and mental
health issues, and personal crises, we as a commu
nity of Stanford students can either grow from
this experience in creating a healthier campus cli
mate, or ignore last year and cast aside personal
crises as those that affect "other people."
While the Stanford administration races to
wards developing a healthier campus climate, the
upcoming midterm week promises to bring stress
and anxiety, among other emotions. Thankfully,
there are two steps that Stanford students can
take to combat not only the emotional difficulties
which characterize such a fast-paced academic
setting, but also the stigmas associated with such
emotional health issues.
First, do not be afraid to get help for yourself.
There are a plethora of services on campus to as
sist in an unlimited spectrum of student concerns.
Stanford offers confidential, non-judgmental,
and empowering programs developed just for

you.
As star students in high school, many of us are
of the mindset that "getting help is for losers."
Nothing could be farther from the truth. Faced
with sexual identity questions, an abusive rela
tionship, or simply stress about a midterm, do not
feel as if you must shoulder everything on your
own. Part of maturing seems to be learning to uti
lize available resources.
There is certainly yet another reason why
Stanford students avoid seeking help in crisis.
ITie elephant in the room is a stigma associated
with mental health issues. The Stanford commu
nity has an unhealthy obsession with perfection,
and any signs of cracks in the foundation are
shunned. In fact, mental health should really be
viewed as an entirely non-stigmatized concept,
one of emotional health. Today's psychology lit
erature paints a picture of emotional health as a
muscle, which, like any other, requires mainte
nance and exercise, not something to be shy
about.
The best way to improve our Stanford com
munity is through the power of friendship. Sure,
it can be difficult to intervene in the lives of
friends who may be having some serious prob
lems. It's tedious, sometimes unrewarding, and

yet almost always the right thing to do. If your
neighbor sprained her ankle, wouldn't you run to
her side?
There is a certain validation provided when a
friend takes the time to help out. I lelping a friend
with an eating disorder find resources on campus
is a good example. Most importantly, through
your care, you provide your friend with a non
judgmental message of support. Messages like
these make the difference in cutting down on
mental health stigmas.
Here is a good personal example where a
friend's care made all the difference. In freshman
year, 1 was dejected about another relationship
gone awry. I begged my roommate to accompany
me to a Vaden workshop on "Why 1 Want What 1
Can't Have." He smiled at me, and said, "of
course." Going to that workshop with my sup
portive roommate was one of the most beneficial
experiences at Stanford.
In review: Beat the Stanford mental health
stigma and do not be afraid to seek help for your
self, and offer a generous hand to friends.
