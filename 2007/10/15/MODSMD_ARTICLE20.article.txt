## Card can't outlast Washington Volleyball's undefeated season ended in five sets 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a battle of two of the nation's top women's
volleyball programs, No. 2 Stanford came up just
short on Friday, losing in five games to No. 8 Wash
ington.
It was a record-breaking performance for the
Cardinal — senior setter Bryn Kehoe passed
Wendy Rush '88 for the all-time career assists
record, junior Cynthia Barboza notched the
I,oooth kill of her career and Stanford's unbeaten
streak ended at 16.
Washington (17-1.6-1 Pac-10) came to the Bay
Area undefeated, but lost to No. 10 Cal in five
games on Thursday before coming to Maples. The
Huskies bounced back and the Cardinal (17-1,6-1)
ran out of steam as Washington won 30-24,21-30.
24-30,30-27,15-10.
"I think Washington is a very good team and I
thought they came in and served aggressively and
passed really well," Stanford head coach John
Dunning said. "Our goal was to keep the pressure
on them and that pressure kind of disappeared.
Volleyball is like a game of dominoes — if you
don't pass well and serve well, that gives the other
team an opportunity. And they were good enough
to take advantage of that."
The teams had nearly identical stats across the
board and the Cardinal outscored the Huskies by
a point in the match, but Washington stepped up its
game to force a fifth game and finally pulled away

GAME NOTES.' Although this was the Cardinal's first loss of
the season, it was a night for the boob for Stanford. Senior
setter Bryn Kehoe recorded a season-high 62 assists to put
her career total at 5,023 and break the former program
record (5,003) set by Wendy Rush in 1987. Junior outside

"I don't think that we played as well as we can,"
Dunning said. "Sometimes that happens; you can
rarely get through a season without it happening at
some point. And now we just need to learn from
the experience and keep getting better."
Stanford started the match on a tear, forcing
Washington to use a timeout at 5-0, and held that
lead until the middle of the game, hut the Huskies
used a pair of runs to tie and then win the first
game. A 9-2 streak erased Stanford's lead, and a 7-

Junior outside hitter Cynthia Barboza recorded her I,oooth career kill against Washington Friday night. Senior setter Bryn Kehoe also
had a record-setting night as she notched her 5,023 rd career assist to break the mark set by Wendy Rush in 1987.
2 run sealed the Washington win.
Stanford fought back to tie the
match in the most lopsided game of
the night, racing ahead again and
holding off the Huskies this time. Up
15-5, the Cardinal did not allow Wash
ington back into the game and
stopped a comeback run short.
The third game was again a matter
of long runs for both teams. Stanford
led 11-5, but Washington came back
within a point of a tie. Stanford
stretched its lead to six again and that
would be the final margin in the
game, putting Stanford up 2-1 in the
match.
Stanford took another early lead
as it tried to end the match in four
games, but Washington would not be
denied.The Huskies finally caught the
Cardinal to tie at 18-all and then went
ahead. Stanford's 14th missed serve of
the night handed Washington the
fourth-game win and pushed the Car
dinal into a tie-breaking fifth for only
the second time this season.
The teams traded points to start
the fifth, with Washington up 8-7 at
the switch of sides. But the Huskies
managed to build a larger lead, going
up by three at 12-9. Stanford managed
only one more point in the game, as
Washington scored three straight to
end the match and upset the Cardinal.
Barboza and Washington's Stevie
Mussie led their respective teams with
20 kills each. Junior middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo had 18 kills at a
.417 clip and freshman Alix Klineman
scored 16 for the Cardinal.
Freshman libero Gabi Ailes had 24
digs in the match, a new career high,
while Washington'sTamari Miyashiro
notched a match-high 37.
Senior middle blocker Franci Gi
rard led Stanford with seven blocks
and Kehoe had six, including a solo.

Kehoe also dished 62 assists to break
the old record by 20.
Stanford had more blocks and a
better hitting percentage than Wash
ington and had the same number of
kills, but the service game hurt the
Cardinal. Stanford recorded six aces,
including two by freshman outside
hitter Cassidy Lichtman, but missed
14 times. The Huskies, on the other
hand, served nine aces and missed
only 10. Their freshman setter Jenna
Hagglund alone scored five.
"1 don't think there are any specif
ic [things to improve]," Dunning said.
"It has more to do with continuing
what we were doing to try to make us
better by the end of the season. We
have been working on our blocking
and that has had an effect, and we
have been trying to add more things
to our offense. But obviously we need
to go back and focus a little more on
the fundamentals, passing and serv
ing."
Despite the first loss of the season.
Dunning is not worried about his
team and is confident that they will
continue to be successful.
"I think good things will come
from [the loss] because it is good for
any group to be reminded of what
they want to do, what their goals are,"
Dunning said. "It doesn't necessarily
take losing to do that, but it tells you
that you need to refocus and not take
anything for granted. We are still a
very good team, but volleyball is just a
really cool sport, where a good team
can not win because the other team
comes in ready."
Stanford will be on the road for the
next two weeks, visiting Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend before
heading south to play No. 4 UCLA
and No. 6 USC. This will be the first
meeting of the season with the Wild
cats and Sun Devils. The Cardinal
swept both the Bruins and the Trojans
at home two weeks ago.

Stanford took another early lead
as it tried to end the match in four
games, but Washington would not be
denied.The Huskies finally caught the
Cardinal to tie at 18-all and then went
ahead. Stanford's 14th missed serve of
the night handed Washington the
fourth-game win and pushed the Car
dinal into a tie-breaking fifth for only
the second time this season.
The teams traded points to start
the fifth, with Washington up 8-7 at
the switch of sides. But the Huskies
managed to build a larger lead, going
up by three at 12-9. Stanford managed
only one more point in the game, as
Washington scored three straight to
end the match and upset the Cardinal.
Barboza and Washington's Stevie
Mussie led their respective teams with
20 kills each. Junior middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo had 18 kills at a

Kehoe also dished 62 assists to break

Stanford had more blocks and a
better hitting percentage than Wash
ington and had the same number of
kills, but the service game hurt the
Cardinal. Stanford recorded six aces,
including two by freshman outside
hitter Cassidy Lichtman, but missed
14 times. The Huskies, on the other
hand, served nine aces and missed
only 10. Their freshman setter Jenna
Hagglund alone scored five.
"1 don't think there are any specif
ic [things to improve]," Dunning said.
"It has more to do with continuing
what we were doing to try to make us
better by the end of the season. We
have been working on our blocking
and that has had an effect, and we
have been trying to add more things
to our offense. But obviously we need
to go back and focus a little more on
the fundamentals, passing and serv
ing."
Despite the first loss of the season.
Dunning is not worried about his
team and is confident that they will
continue to be successful.
"I think good things will come
from [the loss] because it is good for
any group to be reminded of what
they want to do, what their goals are,"
Dunning said. "It doesn't necessarily
take losing to do that, but it tells you
that you need to refocus and not take
anything for granted. We are still a
very good team, but volleyball is just a
really cool sport, where a good team
can not win because the other team
comes in ready."
Stanford will be on the road for the
next two weeks, visiting Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend before
heading south to play No. 4 UCLA
and No. 6 USC. This will be the first
meeting of the season with the Wild
cats and Sun Devils. The Cardinal
swept both the Bruins and the Trojans
at home two weeks ago.

In a battle of two of the nation's top women's
volleyball programs, No. 2 Stanford came up just
short on Friday, losing in five games to No. 8 Wash
ington.
It was a record-breaking performance for the
Cardinal — senior setter Bryn Kehoe passed
Wendy Rush '88 for the all-time career assists
record, junior Cynthia Barboza notched the
I,oooth kill of her career and Stanford's unbeaten
streak ended at 16.
Washington (17-1.6-1 Pac-10) came to the Bay
Area undefeated, but lost to No. 10 Cal in five
games on Thursday before coming to Maples. The
Huskies bounced back and the Cardinal (17-1,6-1)
ran out of steam as Washington won 30-24,21-30.
24-30,30-27,15-10.
"I think Washington is a very good team and I
thought they came in and served aggressively and
passed really well," Stanford head coach John
Dunning said. "Our goal was to keep the pressure
on them and that pressure kind of disappeared.
Volleyball is like a game of dominoes — if you
don't pass well and serve well, that gives the other
team an opportunity. And they were good enough
to take advantage of that."
The teams had nearly identical stats across the
board and the Cardinal outscored the Huskies by
a point in the match, but Washington stepped up its
game to force a fifth game and finally pulled away

GAME NOTES.' Although this was the Cardinal's first loss of
the season, it was a night for the boob for Stanford. Senior
setter Bryn Kehoe recorded a season-high 62 assists to put
her career total at 5,023 and break the former program
record (5,003) set by Wendy Rush in 1987. Junior outside

"I don't think that we played as well as we can,"
Dunning said. "Sometimes that happens; you can
rarely get through a season without it happening at
some point. And now we just need to learn from
the experience and keep getting better."
Stanford started the match on a tear, forcing
Washington to use a timeout at 5-0, and held that
lead until the middle of the game, hut the Huskies
used a pair of runs to tie and then win the first
game. A 9-2 streak erased Stanford's lead, and a 7-

Stanford fought back to tie the
match in the most lopsided game of
the night, racing ahead again and
holding off the Huskies this time. Up
15-5, the Cardinal did not allow Wash

stopped a comeback run short.
The third game was again a matter
of long runs for both teams. Stanford
led 11-5, but Washington came back
within a point of a tie. Stanford
stretched its lead to six again and that
would be the final margin in the
game, putting Stanford up 2-1 in the
