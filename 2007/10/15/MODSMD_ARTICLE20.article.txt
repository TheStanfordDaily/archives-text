## Card can't outlast Washington Volleyball's undefeated season ended in five sets 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a battle of two of the nation's top women's
volleyball programs, No. 2 Stanford came up just
short on Friday, losing in five games to No. 8 Wash
ington.
It was a record-breaking performance for the
Cardinal — senior setter Bryn Kehoe passed
Wendy Rush '88 for the all-time career assists
record, junior Cynthia Barboza notched the
I,oooth kill of her career and Stanford's unbeaten
streak ended at 16.
Washington (17-1.6-1 Pac-10) came to the Bay
Area undefeated, but lost to No. 10 Cal in five
games on Thursday before coming to Maples. The
Huskies bounced back and the Cardinal (17-1,6-1)
ran out of steam as Washington won 30-24,21-30.
24-30,30-27,15-10.
"I think Washington is a very good team and I
thought they came in and served aggressively and
passed really well," Stanford head coach John
Dunning said. "Our goal was to keep the pressure
on them and that pressure kind of disappeared.
Volleyball is like a game of dominoes — if you
don't pass well and serve well, that gives the other
team an opportunity. And they were good enough
to take advantage of that."
The teams had nearly identical stats across the
board and the Cardinal outscored the Huskies by
a point in the match, but Washington stepped up its
game to force a fifth game and finally pulled away

GAME NOTES.' Although this was the Cardinal's first loss of
the season, it was a night for the boob for Stanford. Senior
setter Bryn Kehoe recorded a season-high 62 assists to put
her career total at 5,023 and break the former program

for the win.
"I don't think that we played as well as we can,"
Dunning said. "Sometimes that happens; you can
rarely get through a season without it happening at
some point. And now we just need to learn from
the experience and keep getting better."
Stanford started the match on a tear, forcing
Washington to use a timeout at 5-0, and held that
lead until the middle of the game, hut the Huskies
used a pair of runs to tie and then win the first
game. A 9-2 streak erased Stanford's lead, and a 7-
