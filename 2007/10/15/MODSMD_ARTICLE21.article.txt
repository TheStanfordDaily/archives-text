### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's six-game unbeaten streak was snapped Sunday
afternoon by San Diego State.The men's soccer team lost 2-0 to
the Aztecs (7-2-2. 3-0-0 Pac-10) in the second of its weekend
games in Southern California. Ihe Cardinal (4-3-5.1-1-2 Pac-10)
found a more favorable outcome in a 0-0 tie with UCLA (5-5-2,
1-1-1 Pac-10) on Friday.
To start the weekend. Stanford was forced to battle the rain
and cold in addition to the Bruins. The offense of each team
launched lOshotsin the double-overtime meeting, but could not
find a way to make one stick before time ran out.
Stanford's freshman midfielder Bobby Warshaw made every
attempt to get the Card going in the first half. Accounting for all
four of the team's opening shots, Warshaw tried to give Stanford

the lead in the 33rd minute
with a bicycle kick that soared
just over the crossbar. His
header attempt four minutes
later was just wide.
Warshaw's second-half
shot was complemented by
efforts from freshman Daniel
Leon and junior Michael
Alexander, who registered
both of the Cardinal's shots
on goal. Stanford stayed
scoreless, though, throughout
the second half,despite an op
portunity with Bruin keeper
Brian Perk outside his box in
the 80th minute. Perk was

there to save the three overtime shots, including those by War
shaw and redshirt senior Kyle I fency.
UCLA had its fair share of opportunities in the match, in
cluding a free kick by Kyle Nakazawa that nearly found net in
the 30th minute, and a 54:02 miss by Jason Leopoldo. Cardinal
keeper John Moore registered three saves in his defense of the
Stanford net.and prevented an own goal in the 35th minute after
a Bruin cross was deflected in the box. After 110 minutes of play,
the scoreless draw turned Stanford's attention to its Sunday
match with SDSU.
However, a slow start put the Cardinal behind early against
SDSU, as the A/tecs found success in the eighth minute with a
goal by freshman Khadim Diouf.The score came when a cross
by sophomore hvan Toft was headed to Diouf by sophomore
Nick Cardenas.
Stanford tried to answer on three attempts in the first half,
but SDSU's goalkeeper Jorge Rosales saved Daniel Leon's solo
shot on goal, and a strong Aztec defense limited the opportuni
ties of the Cardinal offense.
Stanford keeper Moore made two saves in the meeting, but
his effort was not enough to help the Cardinal climb back into it.
Barely a minute into the second half, loft 's second assist allowed
SDSU to knock in a second goal off the foot of Kraig Chiles.The
Aztecs had another look in the 50th minute, but sophomore
standout Jamel Wallace missed his 15-yard shot.
Stanford junior T.J. Novak hit the frame with a shot at 50:42
which was saved by Rosales. Freshman Ryan Thomas registered
the Card's last attempt at only 53:10, and both offenses stayed
relatively quiet for the last 35 minutes of play; time expired with
the score remaining at 2-0.
With the win, the Aztecs take control of the Pacific-10 Con
ference with a perfect leaguerecord. Stanford will make its next
conference appearance at Cal on Oct. 20. and will await re
matches with both the Bruins and SDSU on Nov. 2 and Nov. 4,
respectively.
