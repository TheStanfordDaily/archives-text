## 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team (10-1-1.1-0 Pac
-10) scored early.dominated play for about 70 minutes and then
rode out a late surge by No. 18 Cal (8-3,0-1 Pac-10) to win its
2007 Pacific-10 Conference opener, 4-2.
Sophomore forward Kelley O'Hara was the sparkplug for
the Cardinal, assisting on Stanford's first goal, scoring the sec
ond herself, and drawing the penalty kick that resulted in the
team's fourth goal.
Sophomores Ali Riley and Kristin Stannard each scored for
Stanford, while senior forward Lizzie George notched one with
10:30 left in the first half, just 13 seconds after checking into the
match as a substitute.
Valerie Barnes and Katie ()akes scored for California in the
last 18 minutes to try and make a game of it, but the original
four-goal deficit was too much for the Golden Bears to over
come.
Cal was playing in its first game since downing No. 6 Santa
Clara two weeks ago, and the Cardinal never gave the Bears a
chance to get their game legs back. Just 1:14 into the match.
O'Hara strode unmarked to the top of the 18-yard box and
ripped a shot towards the upper left corner of the goal. Cal goal
keeper Gina Pellegrini dove to make the save, but the rebound
fell right to Riley on the far side and she shot into the vacant net
to give Stanford a 1 -0 lead.

The Golden Bears had a few chances in the early stages of
the first half, most notably a point-blank volley by freshman
Alex Morgan that Stanford's freshman goalkeeper, Kira
Maker, rushed off her line to block. After about twenty minutes
the tide turned firmly in Stanford's favor. Stannard had two
chances off crosses — one saved, one shot wide — as the Car
dinal continued to knock at the door.
With about 11 minutes left in the first half, Stanford sudden
ly blew the game open, blitzing California for two goals in 45
seconds.
First, freshman forward Christen Press picked up the ball at
midfield, turned, and threaded a pinpoint through-ball be
tween two Cal defenders to O'Hara. who skipped around Pel
legrini and slotted home to double the score with 11:15 remain
ing in the period. Less than a minute later, George picked up
the ball near midfield with her first touch of the game and
shielded off a tough tackle from a Cal defender before turning
and running towards the Bears goal. About 30 yards out,
George unleashed a wicked, swerving shot that had Pellegrini
leaning left before the ball swerved back and nestled in the
lower right-hand corner of the goal.
Stannard added the fourth 14 minutes into the second half,
converting a penalty kick after O'l lara was cut down inside the
Cal box.
Stanford appeared to be cruising to an easy victory, but with

picked off the ball deep in Stanford's
half and fed Barnes, who shot across her
body, past Maker, and into the lower
left-hand corner of the Stanford net.

rose above everyone to head in a cor
ner and make the game 4-2.The Bears
applied furious pressure for the re

Stanford held firm to secure its tenth
victory of the season.
Riley and Stannards goals were

their firsts of the season. With her goal
and assist, O'Hara climbed to the top
