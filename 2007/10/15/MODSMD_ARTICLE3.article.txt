## Roundtable debates energy issues All-star panel calls for climate change research, market solutions 
### GERRY SHIH SUSANA MONTES 
When it comes to football, according to
coach Jim Harbaugh. Stanford bows to no
one. Apparently, the bar is also set pretty high
when it comes to impressing alums at Home
coming.
In front of a half-filled Maples Pavilion on
Saturday morning. University organizers
rolled out a round table presentation entitled
"Courting Disaster: The Fight for Oil, Water
and a Healthy Planet." CNN host Carlos Wat
son J.D. '95 moderated as retired four-star
Army Gen. John Abizaid, Supreme Court Jus
tice Stephen Breyer, Dean of the School of

Earth Sciences Pamela Matson, New York
Times journalist Thomas Friedman, Edison
International CEO John Bryson'6s and Pres
ident John Hennessy shared their thoughts on
Middle Eastern geopolitics. Constitutional
law and democracy and the specter of dwin
dling resources and climate change.
While the event yielded neither ground
breaking nor particularly inspired discussion,
the audience of mostly alumni - including for
mer Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'-
Connor '50, L.L.B. '52 — witnessed an exhibi
tion of Stanford's influence and prestige as
these leading figures in international affairs,
government and energy development gath
ered at the Farm for a highlight event of Re
union Weekend 2007.
The timely discussion also reaffirmed the
University's pledge to set climate change and

alternative energy research as a top academic
priority The day before. A 1 Gore and the U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
had won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work
on global warming.
"Climate change is the problem of our
times," Hennessy told the audience. He urged
Stanford and other research institutions to
provide overwhelming evidence to put global
warming beyond doubt, saying that "the uni
versities and scientists need to play its role."
Hennessy pronounced his vision of Stan
ford becoming a leader of green scientific re
search in a movement that he hopes will mir
ror how Silicon Valley blossomed around the
campus in the second half of the 20th century.
"Let's make this the Silicon and Green Val-
ley," Hennessy declared. "This is the
head of a new revolution in green
technology."
Friedman, a New York Times
columnist and three-time Pulitzer
Prize winning journalist, called green
technology "the next great global in
dustry." Entrepreneurs will not ulti
mately be motivated by conscience to
improve energy efficiency, he said.
Rather, businesses will find it in their
best interests to explore green tech as
it emerges into a highly lucrative —
and therefore attractive — business

opportunity.
Yet the panelists did not appear
confident in a laissez-faire approach.
Bryson.the head of Southern Cal
ifornia's largest energy provider and
a former University trustee, said the
creation of government incentives
would further help push businesses in
the right direction. Development of
alternative energy sources takes time
and carries high inevitable costs, he
said. In the meantime, Bryson told
panelists, the business model should
urge costumers to buy energy-effi
cient products.
Friedman added that the con
sumer side must also be tinkered with
to create disincentive schemes such
as congestion pricing for commuters
during rush hour.

"lf you never trigger the market,
you'll never trigger the solution,"
Friedman said.
Matson, a distinguished scholar in
environmental studies and recent re
cipient of the Mac Arthur "Genius
Grant," said the conscious decisions
of ordinary people sum up to consid
erable environmental impact. She
advocated making green choices like
more efficient light bulbs and cars
with higher miles per gallon ratings,
and she acknowledged the necessity
of investment in research and devel
opment to achieve long-lasting re
sults. Along with Hennessy, Matson
criticized advocates of corn-based
ethanol as shortsighted and called for
long-term research investment.
"We have to push really hard as a

nation and as a world. It is going to
cost, but we have to start," she said.
While Hennessy, Matson, Fried
man and Bryson discussed green
technology, the subject of America's
operations in Iraq was also a hotly
debated topic. Abizaid, who was for
merly the Commander of the United
States Central Command, quickly es
tablished a connection between the
two topics.
"Of course it's about oil. we can't
really deny that." Abizaid said of the
Iraq campaign early on in the talk.
"We've treated the Arab world as
a collection of big gas stations," the
retired general said."Our message to
them is: Guys, keep your pumps
open, prices low. be nice to the Is
raelis and you can do whatever you
want out back. Osama and 9/11 is the
distilled essence that represents
everything going on out back."
Abizaid said the current strategy
was failing because American armed
forces are not adequately supported
by civilian branches of government. A
much more heavily involved Depart

ment of State, Agriculture, CIA and
DBA are needed to help stabilize re
gions in the Middle East, he said.
"I'd rather have more members of
the State Department on the field
than soldiers on the field." Abizaid
said.
Although the general acknowl
edged that America is "not making
the progress we need to be making"
in Iraq, he argued in his final remarks
against a military pullout.
"The world is too small to turn our
back and we can't walk away." he
said. "To retreat from the role that
needs us would be the greatest crime
of all."
Related to the war effort abroad is
the list of domestic issues of constitu
tional significance beginning with —
but not limited to — the treatment of
so-called "enemy combatants" de
tained at Guantanamo Bay.
Brever cut an animated figure on
the stage with jokes and laughter, but
his nuanced logic and circumspect
caution toward Watson's questioning
stood in contrast with the other pan

elists who favored the rhetoric of
sweeping objectives, relentless effort
and grand revolutions. When he ad
dressed how to balance national se
curity in wartime with civil liberties,
he said, "no one knows exactly what
the answer is."
But he said during a period of war
and national tension, when the gov
ernment gets "caught up in right
eousness," the courts "can serve as a
brake."
1 le championed the need for dem
ocratic conversation, involving clari
ty and the participation of ordinary
people in order to find the correct
balance and the answers to our con
stitutional questions.
"What is at the heart of the spirit
of liberty is not being too sure of our
selves and engaging in that conversa
tion." he said. "Out of that we hope
will emerge the solutions we are talk
ing about."

Abizaid said the current strategy
was failing because American armed
forces are not adequately supported
by civilian branches of government. A
much more heavily involved Depart

ment of State, Agriculture, CIA and
DBA are needed to help stabilize re
gions in the Middle East, he said.
"I'd rather have more members of
the State Department on the field
than soldiers on the field." Abizaid
said.
Although the general acknowl
edged that America is "not making
the progress we need to be making"
in Iraq, he argued in his final remarks
against a military pullout.
"The world is too small to turn our
back and we can't walk away." he
said. "To retreat from the role that
needs us would be the greatest crime
of all."

When it comes to football, according to
coach Jim Harbaugh. Stanford bows to no
one. Apparently, the bar is also set pretty high
when it comes to impressing alums at Home
coming.
In front of a half-filled Maples Pavilion on
Saturday morning. University organizers
rolled out a round table presentation entitled
"Courting Disaster: The Fight for Oil, Water
and a Healthy Planet." CNN host Carlos Wat
son J.D. '95 moderated as retired four-star
Army Gen. John Abizaid, Supreme Court Jus
tice Stephen Breyer, Dean of the School of

Earth Sciences Pamela Matson, New York
Times journalist Thomas Friedman, Edison
International CEO John Bryson'6s and Pres
ident John Hennessy shared their thoughts on
Middle Eastern geopolitics. Constitutional
law and democracy and the specter of dwin
dling resources and climate change.
While the event yielded neither ground
breaking nor particularly inspired discussion,
the audience of mostly alumni - including for
mer Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'-
Connor '50, L.L.B. '52 — witnessed an exhibi
tion of Stanford's influence and prestige as
these leading figures in international affairs,
government and energy development gath
ered at the Farm for a highlight event of Re
union Weekend 2007.
The timely discussion also reaffirmed the
University's pledge to set climate change and

alternative energy research as a top academic
priority The day before. A 1 Gore and the U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
had won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work
on global warming.
"Climate change is the problem of our
times," Hennessy told the audience. He urged
Stanford and other research institutions to
provide overwhelming evidence to put global
warming beyond doubt, saying that "the uni
versities and scientists need to play its role."
Hennessy pronounced his vision of Stan
ford becoming a leader of green scientific re
search in a movement that he hopes will mir
ror how Silicon Valley blossomed around the
campus in the second half of the 20th century.
"Let's make this the Silicon and Green Val-
ley," Hennessy declared. "This is the
head of a new revolution in green
technology."
Friedman, a New York Times
columnist and three-time Pulitzer
Prize winning journalist, called green
technology "the next great global in
dustry." Entrepreneurs will not ulti
mately be motivated by conscience to
improve energy efficiency, he said.
Rather, businesses will find it in their
best interests to explore green tech as
it emerges into a highly lucrative —
and therefore attractive — business

opportunity.
Yet the panelists did not appear
confident in a laissez-faire approach.
Bryson.the head of Southern Cal
ifornia's largest energy provider and
a former University trustee, said the
creation of government incentives
would further help push businesses in
the right direction. Development of
alternative energy sources takes time
and carries high inevitable costs, he
said. In the meantime, Bryson told
panelists, the business model should
urge costumers to buy energy-effi
cient products.
Friedman added that the con
sumer side must also be tinkered with
to create disincentive schemes such
as congestion pricing for commuters
during rush hour.

"lf you never trigger the market,
you'll never trigger the solution,"
Friedman said.
Matson, a distinguished scholar in
environmental studies and recent re
cipient of the Mac Arthur "Genius
Grant," said the conscious decisions
of ordinary people sum up to consid
erable environmental impact. She
advocated making green choices like
more efficient light bulbs and cars
with higher miles per gallon ratings,
and she acknowledged the necessity
of investment in research and devel
opment to achieve long-lasting re
sults. Along with Hennessy, Matson
criticized advocates of corn-based
ethanol as shortsighted and called for
long-term research investment.
"We have to push really hard as a

nation and as a world. It is going to
cost, but we have to start," she said.
While Hennessy, Matson, Fried
man and Bryson discussed green
technology, the subject of America's
operations in Iraq was also a hotly
debated topic. Abizaid, who was for
merly the Commander of the United
States Central Command, quickly es
tablished a connection between the
two topics.
"Of course it's about oil. we can't
really deny that." Abizaid said of the
Iraq campaign early on in the talk.
"We've treated the Arab world as
a collection of big gas stations," the
retired general said."Our message to
them is: Guys, keep your pumps
open, prices low. be nice to the Is
raelis and you can do whatever you
want out back. Osama and 9/11 is the
distilled essence that represents
everything going on out back."
Abizaid said the current strategy
was failing because American armed
forces are not adequately supported
by civilian branches of government. A
much more heavily involved Depart

ment of State, Agriculture, CIA and
DBA are needed to help stabilize re
gions in the Middle East, he said.
"I'd rather have more members of
the State Department on the field
than soldiers on the field." Abizaid
said.

edged that America is "not making

back and we can't walk away." he
