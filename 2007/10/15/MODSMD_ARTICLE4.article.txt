# Reunion draws RECORD CROWDS
## Rain fails to deter 9,000 Homecoming attendees, space becoming a concern for organizers 
### KAMIL DADA 
Even Friday's rain could not dampen the
spirits of a record-breaking number of alum
ni who returned to campus this weekend for
a Homecoming filled with reunion parties,
barbeques, faculty lectures and Stanford
football's 38-36 loss toTCU.
"We had an extensive rain plan, but it was
really the amazing staff that made alums feel
welcomed, even if a little wet," said Leslie
Winick, director of alumni and class out
reach at the Alumni Association."No events
were cancelled; we just smiled that much
more and gave out over 3.000 ponchos."
This year's Homecoming attendance was
the highest in the event's 115-year history,
Winick said in an email to ITie Daily. More
than 9,000 people attended the event, whose
attendance has increase steadily over the
past 10 years, creating a space crunch for or
ganizers.
"We are outgrowing campus facilities and
spaces," Winick said. "The class of 2(X)2 had
over 800 attend their fifth Reunion Party, the
class of's7 had over 600 attend their 50th re
union, and with 12 classes needing these
huge event spaces it's been very, very chal

lenging."
As they reconnected with old classmates,
alums shared memories and discussed per
ceived changes on campus. A number of peo
ple commented on the amount of construc
tion projects.
"Even though it has only been 10 years, a
lot of landmarks have changed," said Rachel
Saunders'97."lt seems as though Stanford is
always creating new buildings. 1 remember
that it used to have more of a'Farm' feel to it
than it does now."
Others said the University's community
spirit has remained unchanged.
"Even though a lot has changed, essen
tially nothing has changed," said Phil Adams
'77."There is still the definite, vibrant and in
tellectually stimulating community that
there was in my time, and the lectures 1 at
tended demonstrated this."
In addition to the lectures and football
tailgates, a "singles mingle" brought togeth
er single alumni in a relaxed setting over ap
petizers.
"It was really a hit of light-hearted fun,"
said Amy Cullins '82. "I don't think anyone
