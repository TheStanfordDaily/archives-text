# Reunion draws RECORD CROWDS
## Rain fails to deter 9,000 Homecoming attendees, space becoming a concern for organizers 
### KAMIL DADA 
Even Friday's rain could not dampen the
spirits of a record-breaking number of alum
ni who returned to campus this weekend for
a Homecoming filled with reunion parties,
barbeques, faculty lectures and Stanford
football's 38-36 loss toTCU.
"We had an extensive rain plan, but it was
really the amazing staff that made alums feel
welcomed, even if a little wet," said Leslie
Winick, director of alumni and class out
reach at the Alumni Association."No events
were cancelled; we just smiled that much
more and gave out over 3.000 ponchos."
This year's Homecoming attendance was
the highest in the event's 115-year history,
Winick said in an email to ITie Daily. More
than 9,000 people attended the event, whose
attendance has increase steadily over the
past 10 years, creating a space crunch for or
ganizers.
"We are outgrowing campus facilities and
spaces," Winick said. "The class of 2(X)2 had
over 800 attend their fifth Reunion Party, the
class of's7 had over 600 attend their 50th re
union, and with 12 classes needing these
huge event spaces it's been very, very chal

lenging."
As they reconnected with old classmates,
alums shared memories and discussed per
ceived changes on campus. A number of peo
ple commented on the amount of construc
tion projects.
"Even though it has only been 10 years, a
lot of landmarks have changed," said Rachel
Saunders'97."lt seems as though Stanford is
always creating new buildings. 1 remember
that it used to have more of a'Farm' feel to it
than it does now."
Others said the University's community
spirit has remained unchanged.
"Even though a lot has changed, essen
tially nothing has changed," said Phil Adams
'77."There is still the definite, vibrant and in
tellectually stimulating community that
there was in my time, and the lectures 1 at
tended demonstrated this."
In addition to the lectures and football
tailgates, a "singles mingle" brought togeth
er single alumni in a relaxed setting over ap
petizers.
"It was really a hit of light-hearted fun,"
said Amy Cullins '82. "I don't think anyone

was taking it very seriously, but it def
initely gave me the opportunity to
meet other people I might not have
otherwise."
At athletic facilities across cam
pus, friendly rivalry ensued as current
athletes faced off against alums.
"It was really nice to see that they
were still supporting us even though

they had left college," said Jordan ln
afuku '11, a men's volleyball player.
"We learned a lot from them because
of all the stories they told us."
Alums also epitomized the "work
hard, play hard," mentality that many
students maintain is a Stanford axiom.
"I went to my class's reunion party,
and it was a lot of wild fun," said Alex
Berzins'92.
"We throw the best parties,"
shouted Bret Gardner '02."Take that
Cal."
Many alumni were especially en
thusiastic about Stanford football's

upset victory over Southern Califor
nia last weekend.
"Beating USC was incredible,"
said Umer Ahmed *82. "1 wish 1 could
have been on campus to experience
it. 1 have never witnessed such an in
credible victory."
"1 heard there was a bonfire in the
Main Quad to celebrate the victory,"
Saunders added. "Stanford students
are always breaking the rules. Some
things never change."
