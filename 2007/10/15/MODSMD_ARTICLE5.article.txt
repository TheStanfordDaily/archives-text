# CARDINAL CANT CONTAIN TCU
## Last-minute drive falls short in 38-36 loss to Horned Frogs 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite leading for most of the game,
Stanford came up just short on Saturday,
falling 38-36 to the TCU Horned Frogs at
Stanford Stadium in a game that, for the
second straight week, was decided in the
final minute.
I"he game came down to the wire, as the
Horned Frogs (4-3) pulled ahead 38-34 on
an Aaron Brown touchdown run with just
4:13 remaining in the fourth quarter. Led by
redshirt sophomore quarterback Tavita
Pritchard in just his second career start, the
Cardinal offense marched down the field
and once again looked like it might engi
neer another dramatic comeback in front of
the nearly 37.(XX) fans at Stanford's home
coming game.
But when Pritchard was sacked for a loss
of eight yards on second-and-l() at theTCU
20 yard line, the setback proved too much for
the Cardinal (2-4,1-3 Pac-10) to overcome.
Pritchard scrambled for a ten-yard gain the
next play but his fourth down pass to senior
receiver Mark Bradford was batted away
TCU then ate up the clock and inten
tionally took a safety, bringing the score to
38-36 with two seconds remaining. The

GAME NOTES: Coming off their incredible upset at
USC, the Cardinal could not hold onto their fourth
quarter 34-31 lead against the Homed Frogs. The
Card's effort was led by quarterback Tavita Pritchard,
who was 12-of-27 for 171 yards and two touch
downs and running back Anthony Kimble, with 109
yards and two touchdowns on the ground. After sit
ting out last week because of a seizure on September
30, senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander came in for
just one drive and was sacked twice.

i believe that there were plenty of op
portunities for us to win this football game,
that's the tough thing." head coach Jim
Harbaugh said. "But I'm proud of the way
our guys played. I really am. Our guys
played with tremendous courage, and effort
on both sides of the ball. It was a heck of a
football game."
The Cardinal put forth perhaps their
best, most balanced offensive game of the
season, with several players racking up big
numbers, highlighted by junior tailback An
thony Kimble who rushed for two touch
downs and 109 yards on Scarries.

Sophomore wideout Richard

and a touchdown, passing the century
mark for the third time this season.
Still, Stanford was unable to follow
up on last week's 24-23 upset of then-
No. 2 Southern California in Los An

formance of the defense, which was
the unheralded lynchpin of the Cardi

five turnovers and four sacks.

nent's final five drives.
"Our coaches put together a really
good scheme to stop them, and we
just didn't execute it." sophomore
safety Bo McNally said, 'if we had
done that, we would have stopped
them."
TCU burned Stanford with the
pass, as quarterback Andy Dalton
went 23-for-34 for two touchdowns.
Receiver Jimmy Young proved an
exceptional deep threat, catching
three passes for 110 yards and a
touchdown. The Frogs put up re
spectable ground totals as well, with
TCU running backs combining for
150 yards.
"They played well, but I believe
we stopped ourselves on defense,"
sophomore linebacker Clinton Sny
der said. "Missed tackles, missed as
signments, we weren't getting lined
up right. Just missed opportunities.
We got a couple of facemask penal
ties which didn't help us there, but

we've just got to be fundamentally
sound on defense and we just didn't
get it done today."
In a deflated Stanford locker room
following the loss, Pritchard tried to
put the heartbreaking homecoming
loss in perspective.
"You've got to just take this game
like another one," he said. "You obvi
ously learn from it, but it's kind of like
'SC. No matter how good a win,
you've got to come back from it men
tally, and after a loss — obviously a
tough loss — you've got to put it be

back next week and work harder than
we have this season."

TWO MINUTE DRILL
PLAYER OF THE GAME:
TCU running back Aaron Brown had only 91 rushing yards
on the day, but his dynamic style keyed a Horned Frog
tunning attack that pounded away at Stanford's wound
ed defense and set TCU up to gain 344 passing yards.
Brown also had five catches for 45 yards and scored the
game-tying and winning touchdowns.
PLAY OF THE GAME:
After Stanford kicked a 37 yard field goal to go up 31 -17
in the third quarter, TCU closed a two-play, 81 -yaid drive
with a rocket-powered 70-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Andy Dalton to Jimmy Young. Stanford's of
fense went three-and-out on its next two possessions, and
the comeback was on.
TURNING POINT:
Facing 2nd and-14 on the TCU 32 in the fourth quarter,
Dalton was sacked by defensive end Emmanuel Awofode
ju. He lost the ball and Clinton Snyder recovered at the 14,
but the game-changing play was nullified by a question
able personal-foul facemask penalty. The result was a 30-
yard swing placing the ball at the TCU 47. TCU scored the
go-ahead touchdown five plays later.
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT:
With Toby Gerhart out and Jeremy Stewart hurting, work
horse tailback Anthony Kimble took the running game on
his back, carrying the ball 19 times foi 109 yards and
scoring twice. In one of his best days in a Cardinal uniform,
the junior shed his twinkle-toes reputation with decisive
north-south running and covered all 39 yards of a two
play drive that ended in a touchdown.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT:
In a trend going back seveial years, the undermanned and
iniury addled defense continues to struggle with tackles,
endurance and pass defense.
KEY STAT:
TCU outgained Stanfoid 494-364 in total offense.

Sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard looks to be the Cardinal's new starter, as senior T.C. Ostrander came in for
only one drive in Saturday's game and suffered two sacks.
Despite leading for most of the game,
Stanford came up just short on Saturday,
falling 38-36 to the TCU Horned Frogs at
Stanford Stadium in a game that, for the
second straight week, was decided in the
final minute.
I"he game came down to the wire, as the
Horned Frogs (4-3) pulled ahead 38-34 on
an Aaron Brown touchdown run with just
4:13 remaining in the fourth quarter. Led by

Pritchard in just his second career start, the
Cardinal offense marched down the field

GAME NOTES: Coming off their incredible upset at
USC, the Cardinal could not hold onto their fourth
quarter 34-31 lead against the Homed Frogs. The
Card's effort was led by quarterback Tavita Pritchard,
who was 12-of-27 for 171 yards and two touch
downs and running back Anthony Kimble, with 109
yards and two touchdowns on the ground. After sit
ting out last week because of a seizure on September

ing kick return.
i believe that there were plenty of op
portunities for us to win this football game,
that's the tough thing." head coach Jim
Harbaugh said. "But I'm proud of the way
our guys played. I really am. Our guys
played with tremendous courage, and effort
on both sides of the ball. It was a heck of a
football game."
The Cardinal put forth perhaps their
best, most balanced offensive game of the
season, with several players racking up big
numbers, highlighted by junior tailback An
thony Kimble who rushed for two touch
downs and 109 yards on Scarries.

Senior wide receiver Evan Moore catches a touchdown pass from sophomore QB Tavita Pritchard to
give Stanford a first quarter lead. Unfortunately, the Card could not hold on to stop the TCU offense.
In the air. Pritchard had another
solid statistical outing.going 12-for-27
for 171 yards and two touchdowns.
l"he sophomore apparently solidified
himself as the team's starter Saturday,
throwing the deep hall well while im
pressing with his mobility and deci
sion-making in and out of the pocket.
Sophomore wideout Richard
Sherman connected with Pritchard
for four catches, notching 112 yards
and a touchdown, passing the century
mark for the third time this season.
Still, Stanford was unable to follow
up on last week's 24-23 upset of then-
No. 2 Southern California in Los An
geles. One key difference was the per
formance of the defense, which was
the unheralded lynchpin of the Cardi
nal's win over the Trojans, recording
five turnovers and four sacks.
Against TCU. Stanford's defense
managed just two sacks and a single
fumble recovery. Perhaps more sig
nificantly. the Cardinal failed to stop
the Horned Frogs when it mattered.

allowing 21 points on their oppo
nent's final five drives.
"Our coaches put together a really
good scheme to stop them, and we
just didn't execute it." sophomore
safety Bo McNally said, 'if we had
done that, we would have stopped
them."
TCU burned Stanford with the
pass, as quarterback Andy Dalton
went 23-for-34 for two touchdowns.
Receiver Jimmy Young proved an
exceptional deep threat, catching
three passes for 110 yards and a
touchdown. The Frogs put up re
spectable ground totals as well, with
TCU running backs combining for
150 yards.
"They played well, but I believe
we stopped ourselves on defense,"
sophomore linebacker Clinton Sny
der said. "Missed tackles, missed as
signments, we weren't getting lined
up right. Just missed opportunities.
We got a couple of facemask penal
ties which didn't help us there, but

we've just got to be fundamentally
sound on defense and we just didn't
get it done today."
In a deflated Stanford locker room
following the loss, Pritchard tried to
put the heartbreaking homecoming
loss in perspective.
"You've got to just take this game
like another one," he said. "You obvi
ously learn from it, but it's kind of like
'SC. No matter how good a win,
you've got to come back from it men
tally, and after a loss — obviously a
tough loss — you've got to put it be
hind you. and you've got to come
back next week and work harder than
we have this season."
The Cardinal will get back to work
this week as they prepare to face Ari
zona in Tucson on Saturday. Arizona
fell on the road to the Trojans on Sat
urday. 20-13. kickoff is scheduled for
3 p.m.

TWO MINUTE DRILL
PLAYER OF THE GAME:
TCU running back Aaron Brown had only 91 rushing yards
on the day, but his dynamic style keyed a Horned Frog
tunning attack that pounded away at Stanford's wound
ed defense and set TCU up to gain 344 passing yards.
Brown also had five catches for 45 yards and scored the
game-tying and winning touchdowns.
PLAY OF THE GAME:
After Stanford kicked a 37 yard field goal to go up 31 -17
in the third quarter, TCU closed a two-play, 81 -yaid drive
with a rocket-powered 70-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Andy Dalton to Jimmy Young. Stanford's of
fense went three-and-out on its next two possessions, and
the comeback was on.
TURNING POINT:
Facing 2nd and-14 on the TCU 32 in the fourth quarter,
Dalton was sacked by defensive end Emmanuel Awofode
ju. He lost the ball and Clinton Snyder recovered at the 14,
but the game-changing play was nullified by a question
able personal-foul facemask penalty. The result was a 30-
yard swing placing the ball at the TCU 47. TCU scored the
go-ahead touchdown five plays later.
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT:
With Toby Gerhart out and Jeremy Stewart hurting, work
horse tailback Anthony Kimble took the running game on
his back, carrying the ball 19 times foi 109 yards and
scoring twice. In one of his best days in a Cardinal uniform,
the junior shed his twinkle-toes reputation with decisive
north-south running and covered all 39 yards of a two
play drive that ended in a touchdown.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT:
In a trend going back seveial years, the undermanned and
iniury addled defense continues to struggle with tackles,
endurance and pass defense.
