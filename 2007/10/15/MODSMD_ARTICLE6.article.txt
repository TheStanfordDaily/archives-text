## Inequality center launches 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
The war on poverty has a new ar
senal: Stanford's recently-launched
Center for the Study of Poverty and
Inequality (SCSPI). which opened
this fall as part of the Stanford Chal
lenge.
"The Stanford Challenge is all
about rededicating the University,
orienting it to solving the world's
problems," said SCSPI Director
David (irusky. a professor of sociol
ogy. "There's an increasing recogni
tion that basic research, important
though it is. is not enough, so we're
orienting ourselves towards ad
dressing the world's most pressing
problems."
According to sociology doctoral
candidate Emily Ryo. a predoctoral
fellow at SCSPI, the Center plans to
use courses, lecture series, confer
ences, internships and opportunities
for community service to foster stu
dent engagement with the issues of
poverty and inequality. SCSPI per
sonnel are also creating an online
database of both classic and ground
breaking research that will be acces
sible to scholars and the public alike.
"We think the dissemination
function is very important," Grusky
said.
To that end, SCSPI also plans to pub
lish a magazine,"Poverty, Inequality,
and Policy." The publication's first
issue will feature articles from lead
ing presidential contenders stating
their positions on issues of inequali
ty, Grusky said.
Around 90 Stanford faculty from
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the School of Education, the
Graduate School of Business and the
vSchool of Medicine are affiliated
with the Center, which also boasts
400 affiliated scholars from around
the world.
Grusky said the Center currently
offers a masters degree in public pol
icy with a concentration on poverty
and inequality, and an undergradu
ate honors program or minor are
also in the works. He encouraged in
terested students to join the volun
teer committee for developing fu
ture programs. A few undergrads are
already active in designing the Web
site, Grusky said.
SCSPI is funded in part by the
Elfenworks Foundation, the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation, Hewlett-

Packard and the University itself.
Grants from these foundations sup
port a wide range of research by pro
fessors, visiting scholars and gradu
ate students.
"In many ways we're embracing
all of the research that's driving the
field." Cirusky said, 'it's not that
we've picked out a particular area."
"Economists approach the issue
of inequality with different tools and
focus than, say, historians or sociolo
gists," said Economics Prof. Luigi
Pistaferri, an affiliate of the Center,
in an email to The Daily."lt's good to
have a forum where all social sci
ences may have their say and ex
change ideas about this important
subject."
Interdisciplinary dialogue is im
portant for more than exposure to a
broad array of research, said Eco
nomics Prof. Gavin Wright, another
SCSPI-affiliated faculty member.
"It's not just that everyone has a
specialty, it's that everyone has a dif
ferent paradigm," said Wright,
whose work focuses on the econom
ics of the civil rights revolution in the
South.
In the School of Education, Prof,
Sean Reardon researches the educa
tional consequences of racial and so
cioeconomic segregation. Across the
Quad, Sociology Prof. Paula Eng
land studies the trends in gender seg
regation in college majors, Ph.D.
fields and occupations. She also
looks at how social class influences
family planning.
Ryo described the new center as
her "intellectual home." Her work
on the theory and policy implica
tions of inequality as it relates to un
documented and illegal migration
will accompany the research of many
SCSPI affiliates.

She said her research is not only
an intellectually engaging endeavor
but a way to keep her connected with
people whose stories humble and in
spire her.
"The center will not only raise
awareness and broaden our knowl
edge about poverty and inequality,"
she said, "but it will also sponsor a
new program of research, training
and policy analysis that will have
real-life impact."
Everyone involved with SCSPI
said they were optimistic about the
new program's ability to help com
bat inequality.
"The main idea is that we do have
the science to deliver on the war on
poverty," Grusky said.
