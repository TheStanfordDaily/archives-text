### GEA KANG 

Singing Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony at the
San Francisco Opera
House with the Stanford
Chorus."
— Pat Terry '52



"Being the op-ed editor for The Stanford
Daily. One of the great things about Stan
ford is that you can try out your future just by
doing little jobs here and there. I highly en
courage students to go out there and try vo
cational things, like doing research in a lab if
you like research. One of the things The Wall
Street Journal liked best about my resume
was the fact that I had worked for The Daily.
Being a journalist here helped me become a
journalist."
— Katie Smith Milway'B2


"Lake Lagunita in the
spring — it's great. You
can just run around the
lake and go boating."
— Jerry August 77


"My first day of freshman
year [in Branner]. I was
standing in line to get
my ID card, and that was
where I met my girl
friend of the next seven
years." — Terry Parks
'87

"My freshman experience
in Encina. All the men in
our freshman class were
together in one building
that year, and then we
went our separate ways in
following years."
— Robert Preble '43


"Just biking around, espe
cially since I learned how to
bike while I was here. It's
sort of a Stanford culture
thing — you don't really
see that anywhere else."
— Emily Kim '96

"Formal dining in Branner, Roble and Lagunita Court. Do they still have
that? The ambience and the French doors were just lovely... [Also,] the entire
freshman class got to visit the president of the University at his house and
shake his hand. It was an afternoon tea-type event; we got all dressed up
and walked through the foyer. That was very special. I remember walking
up those sunny streets thinking, 'Wow, here I am, just a kid, and I get to
meet the president!'"
— Eileen Roach Frost '67


"Shaving David Harris'
head. He was the student
body president in either
1966 or 1967, and he was
one of the first anti-war ac
tivists. A few of us in the mil
itary went and shaved his
head."

"Meeting my now-wife in
my freshman dorm, Ar
royo, where she was a
freshman and I was an
RA."
— Tom Wattles 74, GSB

"The black section of the
football games. We were
the biggest black class
Stanford had seen so far
— there were about 70
of us, and we all sat to
gether."
— Lani Wilson 72


"The 1954 and 1955 yearbooks
— I was in both of them kissing
my date goodnight on the front
steps of Roble. I didn't even live in
Roble my sophomore year (I did
my freshman year), but I knew
someone who was on the year
book staff, and he said that v/e
had to keep up the tradition, so
that's how I got my picture in there
again."
