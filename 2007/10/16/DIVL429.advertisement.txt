robust democratic reforms in its history. Yet the majority of its countries are
facing severe levels of poverty, inequality, and social exclusion, threaten

Toledo and Professor Diamond will explore the effectiveness of political
democracy, which President Toledo believes depends largely on the pro
vision of quality education, nutrition, health care, and dignified jobs for
the poor. In addition, success depends on strong democratic institutions,
including effective and independent judicial and congressional systems,
freedom of the press, and a civil society.
