A lecture with Steve If intersteiu
1 lave you ever wondered about the structure of music—is it merely an accident
of history that our music sounds the way it does? Join Steve Winterstein, mathematical
engineer and concert pianist, as he will ask, and try to answer, the following questions:
Is there a logic to musical notation, and a reason why the
named notes A through G repeat?
What would have happened if Beethoven had been happy
when he wrote his Symphony No. 5?
These questions and others will lie addressed through a variety of piano pieces and
