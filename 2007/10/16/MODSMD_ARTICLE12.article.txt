# Writing for grades, good
## Deadlines: flexible. Change: imperative.

Rhetoric can change the world. At
least that's what the staff and stu
dents of Stanford's Community
Writing Project are saying.
The Community Writing Project (CWP)
consists of several classes within the Program
for Writing and Rhetoric (PWR). Started in
1988, CWP was intended to combine service
learning and writing: for each class, students
must create communication tools — Power
point slides, brochures, videos — for a local
nonprofit.
Recent coordinator Carolyn Ross,a PWR
lecturer, trumpets the program's applications
to "real life."
"We have a very limited audience for aca
demic writing," Ross said. "Adding that di
mension of serving the community and non
profits can be a really useful experience for
students learning to write in the world. The
writing they do is really like the writing that
they will do day-to-day in jobs."
Palo Alto Fire Marshal Dan Firth has
mentored CWP students over the last nine
years as they've created webpages and de
signed fire prevention information sessions
for kids.
"If they can write for a grade and benefit
someone at the same time, that's terrific." he
said.
The CWP program also gives students the
opportunity to take a second look at what
they once thought of as junk mail. In each
class,students analyze the style and rhetorical
devices used in non-profit agency documents,
from videos intended for use in schools to
mass-mailed brochures requesting funding.
Some students are enthusiastic enough
about the project to take multiple classes.
Jason Bautista '10. who is currently taking
Ross's class "Walking the Talk: The Rhetoric
of Social Change" to fulfill his PWR2 re
quirement, also took a CWP class last year to
fulfill his PWRI requirement.
For that class, "Working for a Living: The
Rhetoric of Labor and Lifestyle," Bautista,
along with another student, worked with
epa.net, a non-profit whose mission is to
lessen the digital divide between East Palo
Alto and the rest of Silicon Valley.
Bautista's assignment at the agency was to
evaluate different computer programs that
manage webpage content. His report had to
communicate technical concepts to his men
tor. whose expertise is in other fields, some
thing Bautista said was central to the CWP's

vision.
"It's about knowing your audience and
changing the language you use to fit that au
dience," he said.
After last year's class, Bautista continued
to work with epa.net, teaching people the ba
sics of computer use. As students often
missed class when their bosses asked them to
work different hours, Bautista decided to
launch a new project for "Walking the Talk":
filming tutorials on computer basics for view
ing at students' own leisure.
Another former CWP student. Eric Tran
"10, also worked with computers — he and
another student designed a webpage for Pro
ject Outlet, a Mountain View-based agency
providing support to teenagers with issues of
sexuality. Tran set up an online forum in
which members of the LGBT community can
introduce themselves, share news and ask
questions. He still volunteers as a moderator
of the forum.

"It is just like me talking one-on-one," he
said, "personally, but still being able to ham
mer in pertinent information."
The requirements for CWP classes gener
ally involve checking in with a mentor at
one's agency once a week and completing a
project for the organization. Projects aren't
set in stone and instead adapt to changing
conditions in the workplace.
"Deadlines were not being met for my
getting approval from the agency," Bautista
said."My teacher was like/Don't stress, this is
the real world.'"
While the deadlines for CWP projects
may be more flexible than those of academic
papers, these projects still often involve as
much research. Lisa Solomon '10 worked at
the American Civil Liberties Union of North
ern California (ACLU-NC). Solomon, along
with two other students, researched the histo
ry and current state of life-without-parole
sentencing in California.

"It's more like an

internship than part of a

class"

— Lisa Solomon'lo

One of Solomon's research questions was
to try to find a list of the ages of people serv
ing life-without-parole sentences in Califor
nia. When she could not find this information
in secondary sources, she sent an email to 37
information offices of jails throughout Cali
fornia. She says that her email caused quite a
stir in this community.
"One woman called me and said, "Lisa,
you need to stop sending out emails to people
and contact so-and-so,"' Solomon said.
She did eventually get the information and
took something away from the experience.
"I learned to take initiative," Solomon
said. "You sort of feel like there are bound
aries in society, hut they're really imagined. 1
would have never contacted jails before."
She added,"lt was more like an internship
than part of a class."
