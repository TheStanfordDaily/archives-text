# Climate change:
## No more "wait and see" 
### KT MERTES 
ITiis year's Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to for
mer Vice President Al Gore and the United Na
tions' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), has been 20 years in the mak

ing.
It was 1988 when NASA scientist James
Hansen first testified before Congress about
the human contribution to climate change
and its potentially disastrous consequences.
Early on, decision-makers and scientists each
responded to research on global warming with

a "wait and see" attitude. While many Ameri
cans remain skeptical,last week's award is anoth
er sign that it's time to make up our minds: global
warming is real.

At its first meeting in 1990, the IPCC wrote that ob
served inereases in temperature "could he largely due
to...natural variability."
Since then.climate change research has matured,produc
ing a strong body of evidence backed by robust statistics.
Successive IPCC congresses have issued ever-grimmer re
ports about potential environmental consequences.
Compare the language of 1990 to that in this February's
IPCC report: "most of the observed increases in globally av
eraged temperature is very likely due" to anthropogenic
greenhouse gases.
In the language of the Panel,"very likely" is equivalent to
90 percent certainty.
Before its publication, this statement was jointly con
structed by IPCC climate scientists from over 100 countries,
then independently peer-reviewed by thousands more ex
perts. In effect, the statement itself constitutes a scientific
majority opinion.
And yet, Americans remain skeptical.
Our reluctance to accept climate change science has been
encouraged by a vocal faction of dissenters, several of whom
appeared in the 2007 British film "The Great Global Warm
ing Swindle."
Figures such as Patrick Michaels (professor emeritus,
UVA), Richard Lindzen (Professor of Meteorology. MIT)
and Timothy Ball (professor emeritus. University of Win
nipeg) have frequently contradicted the majority opinion on
climate change — and endured numerous allegations, some
confirmed, of receiving funding from petrochemical corpo
rations.
Those who challenge current climate change science
claim that major scientific journals refuse to publish any re
search that opposes IPCC theory.This argument might have
at least a kernel of truth: a 2(XW study surveyed 928 scientif
ic papers with "global climate change" as keywords. None

disagreed with the idea that human actions
have contributed to global warming.
Instead of publishing papers, these chal
lengers have communicated largely through
op-ed pieces, public addresses and media at
tention, thereby avoiding scientific peer-review

of their own varying theories.
Could the sun's natural variations in surface temperature
— that is, sunspots — have caused climate change? No, the
past 20 years of measurements show a correlation, hut one
that would cause global cooling, not warming.
Satellite measurements — considered more reliable
than ground measurement stations that can be influenced by
the urban heat island effect — seemed to show cooling, in
stead of warming. But when engineers corrected for decay in
the satellite orbits, measurements confirmed rising temper
atures.
Is climate change even our fault? Because global temper
atures do not correlate well with historic periods of industri
al growth, skeptics have said, the human contribution to cli
mate change must be negligible.
But no model has yet been proposed that matches global
temperature rise quite as well as that offered by the scientif
ic majority Multiple factors, including increases in carbon
dioxide, methane and atmospheric aerosols, combined with
natural variations in climate, together provide the closest
match to empirical climate observations.
For most of the world, alternative explanations have
been put to rest. They've made up their minds. When will
we?
