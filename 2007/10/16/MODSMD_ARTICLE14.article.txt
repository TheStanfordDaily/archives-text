## Karate group to offer free self-defense lessons 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
In light of the recent violent
outbreak at Theta Delta Chi. the
martial arts group Shotokan
Karate will offer its weekly self
defense class to all students tree of
charge this year. In the past, the
class cost $50 per quarter.
Hie incident, which happened
on Oct. 6, involved the arrest of
two men on charges of battery. It
has prompted several organiza
tions on campus, including the
Stanford Martial Arts Program
(SMAP), to make self-defense
workshops more widely available
to the community. Shotokan Pres
ident Nick Cizek, a graduate stu
dent in applied physics, was the
first student club president to take
initiative in response to the vio
lence. 1 le believes Shotokan is
one of the best ways students can
protect themselves against future
incidents.
"Having learned self-defense
when I was younger in order to
fight off bullies. I can attest to the
effectiveness of Shotokan
Karate," Cizek said. "Beyond
building strength and confidence,
it has helped me in many poten

tially and concretely dangerous
situations."
"Ironically" he added, "know
ing how to fight has predominant
ly helped me avoid conflict and
defuse confrontat ion."
The Shotokan self-defense
class meets twice per week, while
most of the other self-defense
workshops on campus are one
time only demonstrations.
"We believe that two one-hour
sessions per week over one quar
ter is sufficient time for students to
gain a reasonable understanding
of how to prevent and avoid dan
gerous situations." Cizek said.
He added that the class will
focus on quick and powerful
moves as well as confrontation
avoidance.
"We will steer the class towards
techniques that can be learned to
be executed effectively in a short
amount of time." Cizek said. "Ad
ditionally. we firmly believe that
avoidance and prevention of dan
gerous situations is the best form
of self-defense, and we are work
ing to bring in some police officers
to present on situational aware
ness and safety."
