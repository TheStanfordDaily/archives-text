## Editorial Board Maintain Red Zone momentum 
### 
While Saturday's loss to TCU was a
disappointment, the impressive
showing by the student body was
continuing evidence of a positive change in
Stanford's football mentality. Just as the
team is rebuilding itself under the guidance
of Coach Jim I larbaugh,so,too.do the mem
bers of the Red Zone need to keep rebuild
ing the student fan base.
The excitement that followed the upset of
USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
on Oct. 6 has been well-documented. How
ever. the change began a week earlier at
home against Arizona State. Yes, the Cardi
nal lost that game, and lost it a little inglori
ously — at home and without a single touch
down. 41-3, to another team with a brand
new coach. However, the student body
awakened as it has not in the recent past.
ASU even had a false start penalty on third
down, which traditionally points to the work
of an involved and loud home crowd.
The trend continued this week against
TCU.'Hie student section at the stadium was
nearly full at kick off and was packed a few
minutes after the game started. Stadium staff
again had to give out wristbands to ensure
that only students sat in the student section,
and not just because it was Homecoming;
past 1 lomecomings have not seen nearly this
level of participation among current stu
dents. Stanford is learning how to become a
football school.
'Hie Red Zone must now learn more
about the sport itself, not just the celebration
of it. Cheering strategy is an important as
pect of football fandom — an appropriately
raucous fan base is one of the reasons that
some teams (like the University of Oregon
here in the Pac-10) are so difficult to play at
home.The Red Zone and the yell leaders all
need to learn that while making noise on the

opposing team's third down is important, so
is keeping quiet when the Cardinal is trying
to convert a third down.
By learning more about the ins-and-outs
of football, students will not only avoid the
eye rolls of more experienced fans when
they boo or cheer incorrectly, but they will
also learn to enjoy the game more for its own
merits. Most can appreciate the quarter
back's role, but a seasoned fan can appreci
ate the work of the offensive linemen or the
strong safety, players who might have lived
in your freshman dorm or sat next to you in
PWR2.
Regardless of whether anyone learns
when to cheer or what each player does, the
Red Zone needs to stay strong through the
season, even after losses. Stanford cannot re
turn to being a school of fair-weather fans. It
was hard to blame the student body during
last year's season when few students showed
up for the unbroken string of home losses.
The University did its part to encourage stu
dent attendance at games this year by de
parting from last year's "free" Red Zone
membership, which charged a small fee for
registration and the t-shirt. to making the
Red Zone actually free. Coach Harbaugh
has done a brilliant job of inspiring a change
in the way Stanford students view football
— let's hope that doesn't vanish as soon as
midterms get closer.
While the Red Zone's roar couldn't keep
TCU from running over our defense on Sat
urday, the presence of an enthusiastic and
passionate student body might make or
break the next home game.
'ITiat game is against the University of
Washington on Nov. 3.The Red Zone should
turn out to show the team and the nation that
Stanford doesn't have to win every game for
its students to care about everv game.
