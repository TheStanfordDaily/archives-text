## Draw up a better Draw process 
### 
As a senior, I have a problem with my
housing assignment. Being on the
short end of the stick caused me first
to question the system and then ultimately
to demand a revision.
All the upperclassmen know about the
Draw and how stressful it can be. You have
to form a draw group, find a house that you
like and, finally, wait for your Draw number.
This process stretches out over spring quar
ter, creating uncertainty while we all hover
around 1 lousing's key dates.
It's the Draw number that I have a prob
lem with. I feel like every year it separates
people into "haves" and "have-nots." Those
with low numbers are idolized in articles in
The Daily and get wows from friends. They
invariably choose the Row even though the
houses arc just as old as the dorms. Row
house food is better than that in the dining
halls, but it's not my mother's cooking. Nor
is Bob necessarily a haven for cool and so
cial people, just those with lots of luck (no
offense).
Those with high draw numbers like me
face a different fate. When asked our num
ber by others, our voices hush with embar
rassment. Nor are we all assigned during the
first round; we can be placed on the waitlist,
and some even have to be walk-ins, causing
the uncertainty to extend into the summer.
Worst of all, gross misassignments — like a
junior toToyon or even to a freshman SLE
dorm — are not uncommon.
While the current system does its job of
assigning housing. I think the students and
the administration can do better. Mere are
two suggestions for improvement.
First, provide more public online infor
mation about each residence, such as a floor
plan, map, physical address, square footage
per room, number of rooms, type of bath
room. dorm history, etc. In the real world,
who goes house hunting without looking at
the square footage?
Currently such knowledge passes
through word of mouth and actual dorm vis
its. However, in order to inform students
quickly and accurately, this information
should be alongside the administrative
forms and due dates on
housing.stanford.edu. These facts should be
easy to access and easy on the eyes. I lousing
can definitely make this change before next
spring.
Second, combine regular and in-house

draw into one online process. Currently,
rooms are assigned in each residence's in
house draw. According to the Undergrad
Mousing FAQ on the Housing website, this
method accommodates each residence's
preference of how to assign rooms.
However, my two inhouse draw experi
ences at Soto and Kimball, along with inter
views with fellow classmates, tell me that
most dorms and houses have largely similar
processes. Every student randomly receives
a number, and then future seniors, juniors
and sophomores in order choose the room
they want until none is left.
Differences such as priority status or past
residence are not adequately explained. For
example, if Kimball had art studios or music
practice spaces, allowing priority residents
to choose first so that they could live near
them would make sense. But no such situa
tion exists.
Allowing the student to ask for a room or
room type (single, two room double, etc.)
online gives flexibility to students with dif
ferent goals. I personally value room type as
most important. I can live in a single any
where on campus because 1 have friends
everywhere. However. I have a friend who
craves Roble because it is so close to his
classes at Gates. Unlike the current process
of assigning a residence first, combining the
regular and in-house draw allows us to make
that distinction.
Overall, I envision the housing process as
not listing your preferences and praying for
the best, but an experience more like shop
ping online at Amazon or Newegg. Students
will have more control over the decision
and. thus, feel like they made the right
choice. After all. we will live there for a year,
so it's fairly important to us. 1 can't guaran
tee bliss — some students will complain no
matter what. But I believe that with more
flexibility, more students can be happier
than they are now.
With 6,f>8 1 ) undergraduate students and
growing, revision is inescapable. Opening
Mungcr and making Crothers undergradu
ate are a good start, but we need more.
Changing housing cannot be done
overnight, but it's something that active stu
dent effort and real administrative coopera
tion can do together.
