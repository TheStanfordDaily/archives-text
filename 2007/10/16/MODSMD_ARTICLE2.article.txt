# Student financial aid lags
## Delay of scholarship funds puts students' accounts on hold 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students expecting to receive schol
arship money for the fall quarter from
the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholar
ship received a surprise instead earlier
this month — a warning from Student
Financial Services (SFS) that a hold
would be placed on their accounts.
Until respective states disburse the
funds for students' 2007-2008 Byrd
Scholarships, the bills for Stanford stu
dents expecting the award will contin
ue to show the anticipated amount as
an outstanding debt.The SFS automat
ed hold system, therefore,sent warning
emails to all students on campus still
waiting to receive the award, explain
ing that the student accounts were past
due and "will go on a delinquency hold
in 10 days."
The Byrd Scholarship, which
awards annual $1,500 scholarships to
approximately 27,(XX) students nation
wide. is overseen by the United States
Office of Education, which delegates
the disbursement of the awards
through state aid commissions. Stu
dents receive the awards from the state
in which they attended high school.

While some states have managed to
distribute the awards already, others
are lagging behind. In California,
where the bulk of Byrd recipients on
campus originate, the lateness in pass
ing the state budget this summer has
exacerbated the delay in awarding the
scholarships.
According to Karen Cooper, direc
tor of Financial Aid, the Byrd Scholar
ship Program has a long history of tar
diness when it comes to sending stu
dents their funds.
"Byrd is notorious for getting
checks here late," she said. "There are
seniors who will tell you that those
checks never come in before Decem
ber."
Cooper said there are currently
hundreds of Byrd scholarship recipi
ents on campus and that they are all
waiting for their states to deliver the
funds. In the meantime, the holds that
have been placed on some students' ac
counts will not have any effect on their
school business until the beginning of
the winter quarter, by which time.
Cooper said, the awards should have
arrived. And in the unprecedented
event that the scholarships should
not arrive by winter quarter this
year, she stated that the Financial
Aid Office would be understanding
with all students affected.
"If that's the situation. I'm sure
we would work with Student Finan
cial Services to make sure the hold
doesn't affect those students who
have money coming in from Byrd."
Cooper said.
According to TJ Janeway. Direc
tor of SFS. if the holds are left in
place into next quarter, they could
block students from registering for
classes, receiving transcripts, apply
ing for housing and even prevent
seniors from graduating.
But she also stressed that having
the holds in place this early in the
quarter does not impact students too
severely.
"A hold going on today doesn't
really affect you much this term,"
Janeway said.
She also mentioned that SFS is in
the process of looking for ways to ex
empt students awaiting disburse
ment of outside awards from the
usual delinquency hold processes.
"We are constantly looking for
ways to better this system." Janeway
said. "I would love to hear sugges
tions about how we might. Our goal
is not to put holds on students' ac
counts."
The Robert C. Byrd Honors
Scholarship, named after Senator
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.),isone of the
most common national outside
scholarships awarded to students on
campus, and it is the only one of its
size that has yet to disburse many of
its awards.
