## Cruisin' for a bruisin': My ride-along with the Stanford police 
### 
There are three reasons why I wish I
hadn't been rejected from Yale: 1) my
self-esteem; 2) Skull & Bones, and the
Ivy's equally illustrious porn watchin',chick
en eatin' Porn 'n Chicken society;and 3) New
I laven's crime scene.
My self-esteem may he beyond repair,
but I decided to take the third point into my
own hands and spend the weekend seeking
out a crime scene worthy of my first-choice
school, one composed of criminals far dirtier
than the sidewalk-biking grad students who
usually take up space in Ilie Daily's police
blotter.
With Azia Kim as my criminal muse, 1 was
poised to cruise campus for all of corrup
tion's hot spots. But since I barely know how
to drive, let alone cruise, I decided to stay on
the safe side (literally), and bum a ride from
the Stanford police instead.
Don't get me wrong, I'd pick "robber"

over "cop" any day. But invitations for gang
ride-alongs are hard to come by when a) your
criminal career has largely been limited to
one pathetic Port-A-Potty tipping incident
freshman year, and b) there are no gangs at
Stanford.
Entering the Department of Public Safe
ty at 10 p.m. the other Friday night, it didn't
take long for me to realize why no re
spectable gang would dare come within 10
yards of Stanford's campus. Met at the door
by Deputy Stephanie Taylor, a manicured

soccer mom, I soon found out that Taylor
rounds out a formidable crime squad that in
cludes, no joke, a church minister and a podi
atrist.
Clearly, this was a group that was going to
need a bit of work.
Taking me into the break room. Deputy
Taylor alternated between filling me in on
what to expect on my ride-along and recruit
ing me for a career in law enforcement. 1 did
n't have the heart to tell her that my sympa
thies lay with the wrong side of the law, so I
instead tried to concentrate the conversation
on other matters â€” specifically, the girl who
keeps getting called in for biting her
boyfriend and how Public Safety picks which
drunk kids to give citations to. Answer: Boys
with their Hies unzipped.
To my relief. Deputy Taylor informed me
