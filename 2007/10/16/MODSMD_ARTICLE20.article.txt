## Cruisin' for a bruisin': My ride-along with the Stanford police 
### 
There are three reasons why I wish I
hadn't been rejected from Yale: 1) my
self-esteem; 2) Skull & Bones, and the
Ivy's equally illustrious porn watchin',chick
en eatin' Porn 'n Chicken society;and 3) New
I laven's crime scene.
My self-esteem may he beyond repair,
but I decided to take the third point into my
own hands and spend the weekend seeking
out a crime scene worthy of my first-choice
school, one composed of criminals far dirtier
than the sidewalk-biking grad students who
usually take up space in Ilie Daily's police
blotter.
With Azia Kim as my criminal muse, 1 was
poised to cruise campus for all of corrup
tion's hot spots. But since I barely know how
to drive, let alone cruise, I decided to stay on
the safe side (literally), and bum a ride from
the Stanford police instead.
Don't get me wrong, I'd pick "robber"

over "cop" any day. But invitations for gang
ride-alongs are hard to come by when a) your
criminal career has largely been limited to
one pathetic Port-A-Potty tipping incident
freshman year, and b) there are no gangs at
Stanford.
Entering the Department of Public Safe
ty at 10 p.m. the other Friday night, it didn't
take long for me to realize why no re
spectable gang would dare come within 10
yards of Stanford's campus. Met at the door
by Deputy Stephanie Taylor, a manicured

soccer mom, I soon found out that Taylor
rounds out a formidable crime squad that in
cludes, no joke, a church minister and a podi
atrist.
Clearly, this was a group that was going to
need a bit of work.
Taking me into the break room. Deputy
Taylor alternated between filling me in on
what to expect on my ride-along and recruit
ing me for a career in law enforcement. 1 did
n't have the heart to tell her that my sympa
thies lay with the wrong side of the law, so I
instead tried to concentrate the conversation
on other matters â€” specifically, the girl who
keeps getting called in for biting her
boyfriend and how Public Safety picks which
drunk kids to give citations to. Answer: Boys
with their Hies unzipped.
To my relief. Deputy Taylor informed me

that I would not be riding along with
her, the minister or the podiatrist,
but with Deputy Rick Rondeau, an
officer more along the lines of what I
had been expecting: tall,strong, bald.
At around 11 p.m., we jumped
into one of the Department's snazzy
new sports sedans, and, right off the
bat, it started looking like Deputy
Rondeau and I had a lot in common.
I le jokes that he doesn't get invited
to many parties; 1 joke that I don't
get invited to many parties. He likes
listening to music played at Sigma
Chi parties; 1...
OK, so Deputy Rondeau and 1
might not have that much in com
mon. Luckily.crime soon did most of
the talking for us. as we bounced
from helping apprehend a Minor-in-
Possession at Theta Delt to checking
out the status of a Columbae party.
According to Rondeau,police of
ficers get a pretty poor reception on
campus. At one point, he lamented
that when students see him on cam
pus, "Tliey may wave with one finger
instead of all five."
Iliis Friday, at least. Rondeau got
the chance to play white knight
when, midway through the night, we
got news of a prowler sighting at

Kappa Alpha Theta. Cutting short
our time patrolling Mayfield Ave.'s
"Crime comes to you" Corner (be
tween Sigma Chi and Columbae),
we dashed off to Cowell Cluster to a
house of frightened, pajama-ed
sorority girls.
Throwing a couple of the girls
into our trunk as witnesses, we set off
to identify two suspects whom other
Stanford officers had already appre
hended. ITie description of the sus
pect was pretty basic: white male,
zippered black hoodie, red back
pack.
Unfortunately, the first suspect's
sweatshirt was zipper-less, and it
soon became clear that the second
suspect was. in fact, Asian.
Deputy Rondeau was hardly de
terred as we headed back to Theta to
ask the necessary follow-up ques
tion: "Would you say that the man's
sweatshirt was zipped up all the way
or more like three quarters of the
way?"
1 was pretty disappointed when 1
realized that Stanford's entire crime
scene could be controlled with a
glance at a frat boy's fly or a Peeping
Tom's zipper. Clearly, we are even
farther from New Haven than I
thought.
