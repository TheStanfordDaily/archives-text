# Pleading Inanity
## What's going on? 
### 
By the time I finish writing this article,
you will have cost me $ 1 (XK). Dear
reader, that is how much you mean to
me. I hope you remember this next time I
come banging down your door at 2:(X) a.m.
seeking a shoulder to cry on because the
door I banged on at 1:55 a.m. spurned my
semi-coherent propositioning.
After each sentence I write in this column
— or every five words for long sentences
such as this one — I pause to check Ny
times.com (Generation Q! Friedman, you're
a genius), Facebook.com (20 of my friends
have changed their profile pictures, better
examine each) and my email (the 1:55 door
that didn't open still hasn't written back).
The problem is, I'm currently in class. I

should be paying attention to the professor
in front of me, to whom I've paid $ 1 (KK) to ex
plain the "Charming Betsy" doctrine of
statutory interpretation.
Surfing the Internet during class would
have been inconceivable when I was an un
dergrad, and not only because Al Gore had
n't invented it yet. My parents raised me to

believe that class time was no time for dis
traction — and certainly no time for fun. In
stead, it was a solemn period during which I
raced to write down everything the teacher
said, he the first to raise my hand, and ignore
any and all feelings of lust that 1 may have
had for that girl I always made it a point to sit
next to because she smelled like masala
dosai. (As per my parents' instruction, such
passionate thoughts were only to be enter
tained after I became a tenure-track CS pro
fessor or head neurosurgeon at a major hos
pital.)
How have I allowed myself to stray from
that professionally fruitful, yet romantically


Vishnu
Sridharan
barren, path? When did class time
become a time for idle chatting,
watching the magic unfold on
Neiman Marcus Online and
googling ex-girlfriends? Is there any
hope for redemption?
...ujmnujmnujmn...
Sorry. Quick nap on the key
board. I lope no one noticed. Where
were we?
Oh, yeah, not focusing in class.
Well, the first thing 1 can say in my
defense is that before 1 could instan
taneously track the latest shoe ar
rivals at Neiman Marcus — a Tory
Bruch Mirrored Croc-Embossed
Wedge, for those who are interested
1 had other ways of keeping my
mind occupied during class. High

among them were pondering what to
do with those barely noticeable
patches of hair on my fingers, men
tally reliving the time in high school
when 1 ran a 4:50 mile (true story)
and trying to prove the Hodge Con
jecture, which, as 1 asked Jeeves be
tween the last sentence and this one,
relates the algebraic topology of a
non-singular complex algebraic vari
ety and the subvarieties of that vari
ety.
Point is,even without a computer,
I generally drifted off into alternate
consciousness whenever the mo
ment dictated.
Moreover, psychological re
search clearly demonstrates that we
learn new information best when we
maintain a certain level of base
arousal. If we drop below that level,
we aren't paying enough attention,
and if we get too worked up about
Betsy's Charms, then our neurons
will be firing so often as to prevent us

from focusing, llius, in those special
classes that just don't rub us the right
way, computers help maintain
enough excitement not to fall asleep.
(1 think we'd all agree that this digi
tal solution is better than any one we
might implement manually )
Lastly, but surely not least (cue
sanguine music), maybe class time,
like all the time we have on God's
green Earth, should be used in a way
that most leads to our own fulfill
ment. If listening to your professor in
that class required for your major
makes you want to poke yourself in
the eye with a sharpened stick,
maybe we're all better off if you oc
cupy yourself with the thrilling inani
ties of cyberspace instead. 1 certainly
think so, and your eye would hearti
ly agree.

blowing a grand on you, drop him a
