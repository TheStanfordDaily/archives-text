# Pleading Inanity
## What's going on? 
### 
By the time I finish writing this article,
you will have cost me $ 1 (XK). Dear
reader, that is how much you mean to
me. I hope you remember this next time I
come banging down your door at 2:(X) a.m.
seeking a shoulder to cry on because the
door I banged on at 1:55 a.m. spurned my
semi-coherent propositioning.
After each sentence I write in this column
— or every five words for long sentences
such as this one — I pause to check Ny
times.com (Generation Q! Friedman, you're
a genius), Facebook.com (20 of my friends
have changed their profile pictures, better
examine each) and my email (the 1:55 door
that didn't open still hasn't written back).
The problem is, I'm currently in class. I

should be paying attention to the professor
in front of me, to whom I've paid $ 1 (KK) to ex
plain the "Charming Betsy" doctrine of
statutory interpretation.
Surfing the Internet during class would
have been inconceivable when I was an un
dergrad, and not only because Al Gore had
n't invented it yet. My parents raised me to

believe that class time was no time for dis
traction — and certainly no time for fun. In
stead, it was a solemn period during which I
raced to write down everything the teacher
said, he the first to raise my hand, and ignore
any and all feelings of lust that 1 may have
had for that girl I always made it a point to sit
next to because she smelled like masala
dosai. (As per my parents' instruction, such
passionate thoughts were only to be enter
tained after I became a tenure-track CS pro
fessor or head neurosurgeon at a major hos
pital.)
How have I allowed myself to stray from
that professionally fruitful, yet romantically
