## CARD EXCELS IN SO CAL Stanford finishes in second place, falls to USC in championship 
### KENAN JIANG 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team enjoyed a hectic
yet thrilling SoCal Tournament over the weekend on the cam
pus of host school UC-Irvine.The Cardinal fought its way to a
second place finish overall after two days and four games, in
cluding a win over No. 2 Cal. The weekend's action brings
Stanford's record to 8-4 on the year.
The men started their tourney play on Saturday morning
against No. 16 Princeton. They cruised easily into the second
round with a 16-5 rout over their opponents with hat tricks
from freshman utility Jeffrey Schwimer and senior two
meter/offense Michael Bury.
"You can never really underestimate those teams. We al
ways try to come out strongly against teams, and I guess we
were feeling good." said sophomore driver Sage Wright. "We
executed over what we worked on during practice, focused on
defense, and that's where we were able to step up offensively
when we needed to."
Six hours later, the Cardinal had to face off against host
school UC-lrvine. Stanford, however, showed no signs of fa
tigue as it immediately surged ahead with an 8-1 lead going
into the third quarter. Sophomore utility Drac Wigo scored a
game-high five goals as the team played its way to a comfort
able 12-5 victory over the Anteaters.
"We were able to stick to our game plans as we went for
ward. and we really wanted to not have to run specific plays
and sets, but just play fundamentally sound water polo," said
senior two-meter/defense Peter Finlayson. "Now we have the
No. 2 ranking in the nation, which is really important. We did
n't have to show our hand so we can use that when we play in
the MPSF."

The team faced its first real challenge of the tournament
against archrival Cal in the semifinals at Irvine.
The game started off grimly for the Cardinal as it fell be
hind at halftime, 3-1. Stanford, however, showed gritty deter
mination in climbing back from the deficit to even the score at
8-8 by the end of regulation.
Sage Wright contributed a hat trick, senior two-meter/de
fense Ryan Fortune found the net twice, and junior driver An
drew Drake, sophomore utility Janson Wigo, Schwimer and
Bury all scored, as well. The first three minutes of extra play
saw Cal's Michael Sharf score. However, freshman driver Alex
Pulido answered Cal's goal in the second overtime, and the
Bay Area rivals found themselves in a sudden-death period.
Fortune scored in the first three minutes of the sudden
death period to give Stanford one of its most hard-earned and
cherished victories of the season. The win also signified Stan
ford's first win over an opponent ranked higher than the Card.
"I really think Alex Pulido and [Jeffrey] Schwimer have

played really well and are showing their figure out there on the
team," said senior goalkeeper Sandy Hohener. "[They] really
showed where they fit in and scored big goals in the Cal game.
[Freshman goalkeeper] Brian Pingree stepped in for the early
games, and he's definitely solid, and he'll be around for the
years to come."
"1 think we showed our toughness," Hohener continued.
"We got down 5-1 and could have easily rolled over and be
come content making the top four, which was the goal of the
tournament. But we got back, chipped in and never got down
on ourselves. It's one of those games that makes you proud of
being on the team."
An exhausted Stanford team went into the finals against
top-ranked USC in the afternoon; despite the best efforts of
junior utility Will Hindle-Katel (who had two goals) and eight
saves from Hohener, the Trojans beat the Cardinal for the
