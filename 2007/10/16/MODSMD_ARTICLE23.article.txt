## The 						Wyn Column Holliday is your MVP

The 2007 NL MVP race will
surely be one of the closest in
recent memory
The two frontrunners — Rockies'
outfielder Matt Holliday and
Phillies' shortstop Jimmy Rollins —
both had superb seasons and led
their respective teams to improbable
playoff berths. The Rockies won 14
of their last 15 games to clinch the
wildcard, and the Phillies came back
from a seven-game deficit with 17
games left to win the NL East.
Neither team could have accom
plished either feat without its respec
tive MVP candidate, and both play
ers' performances left the Baseball
Writers of America — who vote for
the award after the regular season
ends but before the postseason be
gins— with a difficult conundrum:
who was more valuable?
On the surface, the race is airtight.
Holliday led the NL in batting aver
age (.340), runs batted in (137) and
hits (216) while placing fourth in
home runs (36); Rollins completed a
rare 20-20-20-20 (20 homeruns,
steals, triples and doubles) season, a
feat so remarkable that only three
other players in baseball history have
done the same. Rollins kept his team
competitive through injuries to stars
Rvan Howard and Chase Utley,
while Holliday led the Rockies to
their best season ever.
But that's just the tip of the ice
berg. If we only examine the most
rudimentary of statistics and intangi
bles, we might as well flip a coin. In
order to determine a player's true
value to his team, we must use so
called "new age statistics."
Batting average exists in a vacu
um — it does not take into account
playing conditions, the skill of the
pitcher or the inning/out/base path
situation. But a new statistic —
equivalent average — considers all
these factors and more.
Baseball Prospectus, the authori
ty on baseball's numerical informa
tion, calls it "a measure of total of
fensive value per out" while includ
ing all the above information that
batting average does not. Essential
ly, it is a batting average alternative
that gauges how good a hitter is
based on all the scenarios that would
affect each at-bat. Holliday posted a
.318 EqA in 2007, about fifty points
above the league average and good
for ninth in the NL. Rollins had an
EqA of .290.
Two more common yet still mar
ginalized statistics can also help us
solve our problem: on-base percent
age, which compares the total num
ber of times a player reached base to
his total number of at-bats, and slug
ging percentage, or total bases divid
ed by at-bats. Both help us discern
good hitters from average hitters
better than batting average can. The
ability to take pitches and draw
walks is a skill that only the best hit
ters have — OBP takes this into ac
count. SLG demonstrates power.
Holliday had an OBP of .405 and
an SLG of .607, which placed him
sixth and second, respectively, in the
NL in those categories. Rollins had
an OBP of .344 (47th in the NL) and
an SLG of .531 (15th).
Combine OBP and SLG and you
get OPS. Adjust OPS for the league
average and you have OPS+, which
measures how much better (or

worse) an individual hit than a nor
mal player that year. It takes into ac
count every at-bat for every hitter
that year, with external factors in
cluded. then formulates the scale so
that 100 is defined as average. OPS+
gives us a way to equate all hitters
against each other, rather than just
individually. Holliday's OPS+ was
151, or 51% better than the average
NL hitter. That astounding number
placed him sixth in the NL. Rollins,
by contrast, had an OPS+ of 120,
making him only 20% better than
average.
Our final measurement of value
is VORP. or Value Over Replace
ment Player. It bears a similarity to
OPS+ in that it measures how many
more runs a hitter contributed than a
replacement player would have.
Here, the numbers are closer: Holli
day posted a 75 in this category,
which means he accounted for 75
more runs than a substitute would
have.
Rollins finished with a 66.1. Both
were in the top 10 in the NL. but con
sider that the Rockies essentially
had to win-out in the month of Sep
tember in order to make it to the
postseason. They won the wildcard
by one game — if you switched
Rollins' and Holliday's VORP and
thus subtracted nine runs from the
Rockies' total, no doubt Holliday
would be sitting at home right now
instead of leading his team to its first
World Series appearance (and win
ning the NLCS MVP. to boot).
All these numbers lead up to this:
Matt Holliday is the clear-cut NL
MVP.
When we used statistics that fac
tor in external conditions and show
value as compared to other players,
Holliday leads in every category.
Even in the basic, practically useless
statistics (batting average,anyone?),
Holliday still beats Rollins in nearly
every grouping.
The Baseball Writers of America,
though, are generally prejudiced
against these "new age statistics."
Most surely made their vote based
off the numbers they know and
measurements of immeasurable in
tangibles. But if they cared to step
out of their comfort zone, they
would see that the debate is actually
moot,and,come late November, that
Matt Holliday should be the NL
MVP.
