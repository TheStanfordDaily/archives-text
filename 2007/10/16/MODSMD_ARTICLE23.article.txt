The 2007 NL MVP race will
surely be one of the closest in
recent memory
The two frontrunners — Rockies'
outfielder Matt Holliday and
Phillies' shortstop Jimmy Rollins —
both had superb seasons and led
their respective teams to improbable
playoff berths. The Rockies won 14
of their last 15 games to clinch the
wildcard, and the Phillies came back
from a seven-game deficit with 17
games left to win the NL East.
Neither team could have accom
plished either feat without its respec
tive MVP candidate, and both play
ers' performances left the Baseball
Writers of America — who vote for
the award after the regular season
ends but before the postseason be
gins— with a difficult conundrum:
who was more valuable?
On the surface, the race is airtight.
Holliday led the NL in batting aver
age (.340), runs batted in (137) and
hits (216) while placing fourth in
home runs (36); Rollins completed a
rare 20-20-20-20 (20 homeruns,
steals, triples and doubles) season, a
feat so remarkable that only three
other players in baseball history have
done the same. Rollins kept his team
competitive through injuries to stars
