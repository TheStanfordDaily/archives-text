### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its busiest weekend of the season,
cross country competed in both the
Bronco Invitational (held in Santa
Clara) and the Pre-NCAA Invitational
(held inTerre Haute, Ind.).
ITie No. 1 women ran away with first
place at the Pre-NCAAs. The men,
ranked fifth in the nation at the time,
had a less impressive result, finishing in
sixth place at the weekend event.
The Stanford women won their
event rather easily, besting their closest
competitor, Florida State (who finished
with 123 points), with a low score of 102.
The team was led by senior Teresa
McWalters, who finished second overall
in the Invite with a time of 20:02. Fellow
senior Arianna Lambie finished just be
hind at 20:02. Other notable perform
ances were turned in by junior Alicia
Follmar (20:51) and Alex Gits (20:58).
"The women were ecstatic." junior
Hakon DeVries said. "They're No. 1 in
the country â€” they proved that on Sat
urday. They ran away with the race: they
looked really strong, and they definitely
showed that they're the team to beat."
The No. 5 men came into their Satur
day race with high expectations but
ended up in a somewhat disappointing
sixth place.
"It was disappointing,but it wasn't as
bad as it looked on paper," DeVries
said.
Ilie Cardinal men were led by senior
Russell Brown, who came in 11th place
overall at 23:37. Junior Hari Mix (23:47)
had Stanford's second-best perform
ance, while senior Neftalem Araia
(24:04) and DeVries (24:W) rounded
out the line-up for the Cardinal.
The Pre-NCAA Invite took place on
the same course where the NCAA
Championships will be held in a little
over a month. Featuring some of the
best teams from around the country, the
Invite was a good chance for Stanford to
get its bearings on the championship
course while also checking out top op
posing competition.
Both the men and women sent their
top seven runners to the pre-NCAAs
