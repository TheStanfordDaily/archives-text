### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team completed
a very successful preseason tournament this
past weekend at the ITA Regional Champi
onships in Seattle, Wash. TWo doubles teams
and the individual play of sophomore Richard
Wire represented the Cardinal well; several
members of the team also went deep into both
brackets of the tournament.
Wire has won five straight matches and is
set to play in the finals of the singles bracket
today against Andy Kuharszky of Washington.
Wire is the No. 2 seed, and Kuharszky is No. 4.
At one point in the tournament. Wire had
won 23 straight games. Mead coach John
Whitlinger had nothing but praise for the
sophomore.
"Richard has played as well as I have ever
seen him play," Whitlinger said. "He's moving
well, playing with confidence and serving well.
He will have quite a challenge tomorrow
against [Kuharszky]. who is a different style of

player than [Wire] has seen in the past few
days."
Wire also teamed with freshman Greg Hir
shman in doubles, and the duo is still standing.
They will play a semifinal match tomorrow
against Geoff Chivezer and Pedro Zerbini, the
No. 2 seeded team from Cal.
"[Hirshman| and I have played well," Wire
said about his younger partner. "He is a more
intense player, and I am more relaxed, so the
combination has been good.
"He is eager to learn and he is improving
fast — hopefully he can rely on me as the more
experienced player."
Another freshman. Ted Kelly, did excep
tionally well in his first collegiate tournament.
Kelly, who had only played one collegiate
match before this weekend, won his two open
ing matches in the singles bracket, including an
upset victory over the No. 1 seeded player in
the tournament. Cal's Pierre Mouillon. Kelly
recorded a three-set victory, 6-7. 6-3, 6-3, but

came up short of the quarterfinals
when he fell to Tobias Obenaus of
Washington, 6-1, 3-6,6-1. in the next
round.
"Ted played a great match." said
coach Whitlinger. "[Mouillon] is a
very solid player. He played well in
the first set. but Ted turned it right
around and played a solid last two
sets. It was a great effort by him."
But Kelly is not done, as he and

junior Blake Muller are still alive in
the doubles bracket, as well. Kelly
and Mullet have played solidly
throughout the weekend and have a
semifinal match tomorrow against
Mouillon and Jonathan Dalian from
Cal.They are the No. 1 seeded team,
while the duo from Cal is the third
seed.
The Stanford doubles duo of jun
ior Jeff Zeller and sophomore Kevin
Kaiser held a 6-4 lead in its quarterfi
nal match but could not sustain it.
and lost 8-6 to Chivezer and Zerbini.
"We've got guys who can really
play some doubles," said Whitlinger.
ITie fact that all three Stanford teams

made the quarterfinals is evidence of
I ust that.
"It shows me there are a lot of op
tions this year." Whitlinger contin
ued. "I'm proud of all the guys; they
have all played well.so I hope we can
qualify a team for National Indoors."
Kelly/Muller and I lirshman/Wire
are on opposite sides of the bracket,
sd an all-Stanford final is quite possi
ble. Today's action starts at 9:30 a.m.
with the doubles semifinals, followed
by Wire's match in the finals at 11:30
a.m.
