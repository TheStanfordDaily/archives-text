The Stanford men's tennis team completed
a very successful preseason tournament this
past weekend at the ITA Regional Champi
onships in Seattle, Wash. TWo doubles teams
and the individual play of sophomore Richard
Wire represented the Cardinal well; several
members of the team also went deep into both
brackets of the tournament.
Wire has won five straight matches and is
set to play in the finals of the singles bracket
today against Andy Kuharszky of Washington.
Wire is the No. 2 seed, and Kuharszky is No. 4.
At one point in the tournament. Wire had
won 23 straight games. Mead coach John
Whitlinger had nothing but praise for the
sophomore.
"Richard has played as well as I have ever
seen him play," Whitlinger said. "He's moving
well, playing with confidence and serving well.
He will have quite a challenge tomorrow
against [Kuharszky]. who is a different style of

player than [Wire] has seen in the past few
days."
Wire also teamed with freshman Greg Hir
shman in doubles, and the duo is still standing.
They will play a semifinal match tomorrow
against Geoff Chivezer and Pedro Zerbini, the
No. 2 seeded team from Cal.
"[Hirshman| and I have played well," Wire
said about his younger partner. "He is a more
intense player, and I am more relaxed, so the
combination has been good.
"He is eager to learn and he is improving
fast â€” hopefully he can rely on me as the more
experienced player."
Another freshman. Ted Kelly, did excep
tionally well in his first collegiate tournament.
Kelly, who had only played one collegiate
match before this weekend, won his two open
ing matches in the singles bracket, including an
upset victory over the No. 1 seeded player in
the tournament. Cal's Pierre Mouillon. Kelly
recorded a three-set victory, 6-7. 6-3, 6-3, but
