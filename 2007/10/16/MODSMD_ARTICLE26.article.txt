Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actu
al strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they
could beat the team below them.
Rank Last Week Comment
1. LSU 1 Who else? Two top-10 wins (VT, Florida), should be back if they win out.
2. Ohio State 2 Perhaps the only team left that consistently clobbers the teams it should.
3. Oklahoma 4 Highest-ranked one-loss team in BCS. But will weak Big 12 cost Sooners?
4. Florida 5 Two losses, I know, but will prove me right in next two: at Kentucky, at
Georgia.
5. use 3 Time's running out to regain the magic: Cal, Oregon, ASU, UCLA up
coming.
6. Oregon 7 How's this for irony? Regained control of Pac-10 destiny after Oregon State
beat Cal.
7. Virginia Tech 8 Should run the weak ACC table, then an LSU rematch for all the marbles?
8. California 6 Stanford's lost a lot of tough games, but God, that OSU loss was beautiful.
9. South Carol ina 9 Spurrier is making all the difference. Kentucky, Georgia wins both looking
good.
10. Michigan 10 One complete game out of seven's not that bad, right? Better late than
never.
11. Arizona State 12 Another new coach (Erickson) with a huge impact. But brutal stretch run
awaits.
12. West Virginia 11 QB White injured and Louisville, Rutgers, Cincinnati in next four games.
13. Texas 15 Bad start, but anyone really think they couldn't beat the teams below?
14. Kentucky 22 Welcome to the big boy table. 22 arrests in Lexington Saturday night to
boot.
15. Missouri 17 Hung tough for three quarters in Norman. Can they slow Texas Tech this
week?
16. Boston College 18 No huge bump, but major brownie points for dropping Irish to 1-6.
17. South Florida 19 Most overrated team at No. 2.
18. Tennessee 16 Ugly win against Mississippi State slides them down.
19. Auburn NR Held McFadden, nation's best pure runner, to 43 yards. Welcome back.
20. Texas Tech NR Only loss to Oklahoma State? That's GARBAGE. Close with Texas and
Oklahoma.
21. Kansas 25 Averaging over 50 points per game! But clock could strike 12 at Colorado.
22. iawaii 21 Top 20 team at home, fringe-top 60 team on road. U-G-L-Y win, again.
23. Penn State NR Not out of Big 10 at all â€” could be team to shock Ohio State in two
weeks.
24. Zincinnati 24 Louisville knocks them from unbeatens, but early Oregon State W looking up.
25.Kansas State NR Top 40, if that, most years. But this season is the craziest I con ever
remember.
