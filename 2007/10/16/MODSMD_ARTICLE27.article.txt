Alumni games abound during
Homecoming Weekend
Aside from the football game
against TC'U, there was plenty going
on for Stanford athletics last Satur
day. 1 lomecoming Weekend brought
the return of hundreds of alumni ath
letes who competed against their cur
rent Stanford counterparts on Satur
day.
Ihe 2008 Stanford baseball team
had no trouble against a team of for
mer players, winning 10-3.The alumni
participants came from a number of
years — as recent as 2006 to as early
as 1955.
"This event is always so much

fun "head coach Mark Marquess told
GoStanford.com. "It was a great
turnout of alumni this year. We just
want to thank them for all they have
done for Stanford baseball, lodav is a
great day to do that."
One of the lone bright mo
ments for the alumni was when Joe
Borchard, an outfielder for the
Florida Marlins this year, belted a
500-foot blast in his only at-bat of
the game.
()ther teams to hold alumni events
and games were the men's volleyball
team and both the men's and
women's swim and dive squads.
Cardinal tennis shines at
Saint Mary's
Three members of the Stanford
women's tennis team were in action
this past weekend at the Saint Mary's
Invitational: freshmen Carolyn
McVeigh and Jennifer Yen and soph
omore Lindsay Burdette.
McVeigh and Yen competed to
gether in doubles, winning three
straight matches to advance to the fi
nals of the tournament.The freshmen
duo ended up falling 8-5 to Cecilia
Gratian and Jenni Heinser from the
University of San Francisco.
In singles play, Burdette reached
the semifinals before she was beaten
by Saint Mary's Jessica Hoath by a
score of 6-4. 6-3. Burdette had won
two straight-set matches before los
ing to Hoath.
Both McVeigh and Yen also com
peted in singles. McVeigh fell in the
second round after losing to Loyola
Marymount's Pavla Mesterova, 6-3,
6-4. Yen won her first round match
before losing to Cal's Bojana Bobu
sic, 6-0,6-1.

The full Cardinal squad will be
back in action this week, as Stanford
hosts the ITA Northwest Regional
Championships. Competition begins
on Friday and takes place at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
Field hockey falls to Wake Forest, 8-0
Stanford field hockey suffered its
fourth loss of the season against the
No. 3 Wake Forest Demon Deacons
in yesterday's home game. The Car
dinal (7-4, 4-1 NorPac) had little
chance from the start, surrendering
five first-half goals in an 8-0 loss. It
was the first time that Stanford had
been shutout in over a year.
The game was the second of
seven non-conference games that
Stanford is set to play over the latter
half of October. As the NorPac con
ference is weaker than most, the
non-conference opponents have
provided stiff competition — the
Cardinal has lost two games in a row
since finishing regular season Nor-
Pac play.
Ilie team will continue its tough
non-conference schedule on Friday
when it takes on Louisville in a road
match. Later this weekend, road
matches against Georgetown and
Indiana await.
