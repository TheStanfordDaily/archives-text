Alumni games abound during
Homecoming Weekend
Aside from the football game
against TC'U, there was plenty going
on for Stanford athletics last Satur
day. 1 lomecoming Weekend brought
the return of hundreds of alumni ath
letes who competed against their cur
rent Stanford counterparts on Satur
day.
Ihe 2008 Stanford baseball team
had no trouble against a team of for
mer players, winning 10-3.The alumni
participants came from a number of
years â€” as recent as 2006 to as early
as 1955.
"This event is always so much

fun "head coach Mark Marquess told
GoStanford.com. "It was a great
turnout of alumni this year. We just
want to thank them for all they have
done for Stanford baseball, lodav is a
great day to do that."
One of the lone bright mo
ments for the alumni was when Joe
Borchard, an outfielder for the
Florida Marlins this year, belted a
500-foot blast in his only at-bat of
the game.
()ther teams to hold alumni events
and games were the men's volleyball
team and both the men's and
women's swim and dive squads.
