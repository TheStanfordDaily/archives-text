Last year, students in the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) spearheaded a drive to
make the GSB CafK go green as part of their
efforts to champion environmental and social
causes.
This year, the GSB has been ranked number
one in the biannual "Beyond Grey Pinstripes"
ranking, which evaluates business school pro
grams on whether they provide an environ
mentally and socially sound business educa
tion. The ranking, released on Oct. 10. was put
out by the leadership think tank Aspen Insti
tute. This is the second time the GSB has re
ceived top honors â€” in 2005. the last year the
award was presented, Stanford also ranked

first.
"Beyond Grey Pinstripes is a research sur
vey and alternative ranking of business
schools," said Justin Goldbach. program man
ager of New York's Aspen Institute Center for
Business Education Program. "It spotlights in
novative full-time MBA programs leading the
way in the integration of issues concerning so
cial and environmental stewardship in to the
curriculum."
According to the ranking, the percentage of
business schools that require students to take a
course focused on "business and society" issues
has increased dramatically over the past five
years, jumping from 34 percent in 2001 to 63
percent in 2007. Of the 111 surveyed schools, 35
offer a special concentration in social and envi
ronmental issues.
The evaluators considered numerous fac
tors.such as the number of courses dealing with
sustainability and social issues, the number of
students enrolling in these courses, the depth of
the course content and faculty research.

1 lowever. a high number of courses dealing
with sustainability and social issues alone does
not serve as evidence for growing interest in
these issues.said Nancy McGaw. the deputy di
rector of New York's Aspen Institute Center
for Business Education Program.
"In terms of the survey, we look at the num
ber of courses that focus on the subject of sus
tainability." she said. "But it is possible to see
other evidence of this interest, for example, in
the increasing number of events on campus
that touch on issues related to sustainability."
Evidence of this growing interest at Stan
ford was evident in the creation of the Center
for Social Innovation in 2000. The Center is
now a hub for students and faculty on campus,
driving dialogue on how to equip students to
deal with today's social and environmental is
sues in business.
kriss Deiglmeier, executive director of the
Center, was pleased with the GSB's top rank
ing.
"It's an external confirmation of all the inte

gration the GSB has done in the MBA curricu
lum." she said. "We believe we are the leaders
and the ranking confirmed it. The GSB not
only offers the core courses but also robust
elective opportunities for students to get real
world exposure and a truly comprehensive ed
ucational experience."
I lowever. Deiglmeier was quick to add that
Stanford's high ranking is not the sole reason
for her enthusiasm.
"I think it is a really positive sign that Stan
ford has been ranked number one," she said.
"But I think that the more important signifi
cance of this is that more schools and students
are engaging in these crucial issues."
The rest of the top 10 schools on the list are
the University of Michigan, York University,
UC-Berkeley, University of Notre Dame, Co
lumbia University, Cornell University.
Duquesne University. Yale University and In
stitute de Empresa.
