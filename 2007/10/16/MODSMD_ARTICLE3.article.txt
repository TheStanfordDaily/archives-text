Every day.students bike across campus, gliding
through stop signs or listening to their favorite
tunes on iPods. Many students are unaware that
such behavior is technically illegal, but rumors of
stricter bicycle law enforcement may make stu
dents think twice as they bike to class.

Police informed bikers on campus last week
that officers would begin to crack down on cy
clists this week for running stop signs and listen
ing to music on headphones.
Representatives from the Stanford Universi
ty Department of Public Safety (DPS),however,
maintain that the aforementioned laws have
been in effect for years and that enforcement
this week will be no different from that at any
other time.
"We have not initiated an increase or de
crease in enforcement," said Deputy Chris Co
hendet.

Because the California Vehicle Code states
that bicycle riders have the same rights and re
sponsibilities as motor vehicle drivers, cyclists
are, therefore, subject to the same citations and
fines. The fines for these infringements can be
steep, starting at $150 for a simple stop sign vio
lation.
"These laws exist for the safety of bicyclists,
pedestrians as well as others on the road," ('hiel
of Police Laura Wilson said in an email to The
Daily.
