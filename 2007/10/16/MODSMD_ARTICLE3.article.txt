# STUDENT LIFE
## Police nab cyclists, ticketing expected Police wait near stop signs, pull over students who neglect to stop

Every day.students bike across campus, gliding
through stop signs or listening to their favorite
tunes on iPods. Many students are unaware that
such behavior is technically illegal, but rumors of
stricter bicycle law enforcement may make stu
dents think twice as they bike to class.

Police informed bikers on campus last week
that officers would begin to crack down on cy
clists this week for running stop signs and listen
ing to music on headphones.
Representatives from the Stanford Universi
ty Department of Public Safety (DPS),however,
maintain that the aforementioned laws have
been in effect for years and that enforcement
this week will be no different from that at any
other time.
"We have not initiated an increase or de
crease in enforcement," said Deputy Chris Co
hendet.

Because the California Vehicle Code states
that bicycle riders have the same rights and re
sponsibilities as motor vehicle drivers, cyclists
are, therefore, subject to the same citations and
fines. The fines for these infringements can be
steep, starting at $150 for a simple stop sign vio
lation.
"These laws exist for the safety of bicyclists,
pedestrians as well as others on the road," ('hiel
of Police Laura Wilson said in an email to The
Daily.

A student is given a warning by a member of the Department of Public Safety for failing to stop at a stop sign on Serra Street.
The DPS has recently been active
in community outreach efforts to in
form the student population about
the importance of these laws.
According to Cohendet, DPS has
stationed a table at White Plaza every
Friday since the beginning of the year
to hand out pamphlets and to provide
pertinent information to students
about bicycle traffic regulations.
"The main purpose is to make
the community aware." Cohendet
said. "In the summer months, there
is less traffic and. therefore, fewer ci
tations. In the fall, with the arrival of
new students, the number of cita
tions will increase."
The laws' enforcement remains a
popular debate among students.
"I bike through stop signs all the
time," said Ariane Tom '11. "But it's
mainly to get to class on time. 1
mean, if we have to stop at stop
signs, think of how much time we
would waste."
Still, other students support the
enforcement.
"If pedestrians and cars are
obeying the rules, then cyclists have
to as well," said Leo Kim '11. "Cy
clists arc not above the law."
