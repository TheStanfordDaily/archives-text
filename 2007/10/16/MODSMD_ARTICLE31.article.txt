### JOANNA XU 
Si x Stanford researchers were recognized on Fri
day as lead contributors to the International Panel
on Climate ( 'hange (IPC XT), a branch of the United
Nations that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
along with former Vice President A 1 Gore.
IPCC. which was formed to evaluate the risk of
climate change caused by human activity, included
Stanford researchers Chris Field, Thomas Heller,
Michael Mastrandrea,Terry Root, Stephen Schnei
der and John Weyant.
"The IPCC is an organization composed of vol
unteer scientists and government delegates," said
Weyant, a management science and engineering
professor. ' Ihough the work that we do for the
I P('(' is immensely gratifying, nonetheless it is verv
hard work."
Mastrandrea B.S.'(X), Ph.D. '04 is a research asso
ci ite at the Woods Institute for the Environment
and lecturer in the School of Earth Sciences, and he
agreed with Weyant.

"To have that effort recognized in this way is
very gratifying," Mastrandrea said.
All of the Stanford researchers said they were
surprised to hear that IPCC would share the award.
"I've always imagined recipients of the Nobel
Peace Prize to be individuals like Nelson Mandela
or Gandhi." Weyant said.'i was surprised first that
they gave the award to an organization and. second,
that they decided to give the Peace Prize to an envi
ronmental cause."
"1 think the committee was originally going to
give the prize to the chairman of the iPCC," he
added."but I'm glad they decided to award it to the
entire organization."
Root, a senior fellow at the Woods Institute,said he
hoped the prize would raise awareness about the
climate crisis.
"I think this award legitimizes IPCC in many
peoples' minds." she said.'i hope this will take wind
away from many of the naysayers."
Asked about Gore and his environmental im
pact goals, the researchers spoke positively about

the former vice president.
"A 1 Gore is an extremely talented and gracious
individual," Root said.
Weyant recognized Gore's ability to think on a
global scale.
"A 1 Gore is a vital leader for the climate change
cause," he said. "Scientists have a tendency to get
lost in the details. Gore is talented in that he keeps
all levels of the issue, including the big picture, in
mind."
In the end. speculation about Gore's political fu
ture overshadowed the focus on science at Friday
morning's press conference in Palo Alto.
"A 1 Gore's statement at the conference was that
this Nobel recognition should be used to re-ener
gize the cause even further," said Field Ph.D. '81, a
professor in the biological sciences."But I was high
ly disappointed with the press coverage after, which
was only interested in whether Gore was running
for president."
