## Frosh alcohol policy surprise to many 
### AYSHA BAGCHI 
The phone rings. You wake up with your head
pounding, trying to remember what happened
last night. Your parents are on the line.They just
talked to the Dean of Students, they know you
were drinking and they want answers.
lb many Stanford students, this may seem like
a nightmare, but for freshmen, it is a reality.
In the fall of 1998, Congress amended the
Higher Education Act to allow colleges to in
form parents any time a student under 21 vio
lates an alcohol or drug law. In 1999, Stanford
reviewed the amended act and decided to adopt
the option of calling parents of freshmen start
ing in 2000.
"Since Stanford sees the frosh year as a year of
transition," said Ralph Castro, co-chair of the
Stanford Alcohol Advisory Board, "parents are
called if a frosh has a serious alcohol incident."
According to Castro, a "serious alcohol inci
dent" for which the University may call a stu
dent's parents includes "being arrested for
[being] drunk in public, driving under the influ
ence or requiring medical assistance due to se
vere alcohol poisoning."
This policy makes some freshmen entering the
Stanford alcohol scene uncomfortable.
"It is a little extreme.getting parents involved

in their kids' lives after they've been sent out,"
said Wendy Kalkus '11. "They're adults now."
Thomas Corrigan '11. however, disagreed.
"| Parents] have a right to know if their kid has
been involved in a serious alcohol incident since
they're paying a lot of money for their kid to go
there." he said. "1 think when parents drop their
kid off at college they're leaving the college re
sponsible for their child's well-being, not just
their education."
Last year, campus authorities documented 39
arrests and 50 disciplinary referrals given out to
the overall student body for on campus liquor
law violations. Upperclassmen may not have
much to worry about, but the policy can be worri
some in light of those numbers.
"If 1 knew [about the policy] ahead of time,"
said Scott McCracken '08. "I probably wouldn't
have applied to this school."
In preparation for alcohol issues, freshmen ar
riving this year and last were required to take a
class called "AlcoholEdu," an online alcohol edu
cation course. Castro said the course was de
signed to "provide students with targeted educa
tion before they arrive on campus."
According to Castro, alcohol is "by far the
'drug of choice' at Stanford." But awareness of
the policy is lacking among the student body.
"Students need to know about that policy,"

said Tiffany Wyche '11.
"Just as they say no un
derage drinking, they ,
should make known i
the consequences." J
When asked about J

lack of awareness
Castro said the issue
of calling parents is
addressed in the
"Real World: Stan
ford" program dur
ing New Student J
Orientation. J

"It is an issue I
that only affects a â„¢
very small minority
of the frosh class
each year." he said.
Castro noted,
however, that Uni-

versity policy only reinforces what many students
do on their own.
"Actually," he said,"l find that many students
call their parents anyway if they have experi
enced an alcohol-related legal or medical prob
lem."
