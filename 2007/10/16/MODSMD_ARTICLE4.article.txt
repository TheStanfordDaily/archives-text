## Panel speaks on role of nuclear energy 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
lliree nuclear policy experts high
lighted tension between the potential
benefits and dangers of nuclear energy
before more than 170 students, faculty
and Fellows of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences in a discussion
yesterday evening.
The event, entitled "Nuclear Power
without Nuclear Proliferation," was
sponsored by the Academy in collabo

ration with the Stanford Center for In
ternational Security and Cooperation
(CISAC) and was moderated by
CISAC Co-Director Scott Sagan.
An all-star panel included former
Defense Secretary and Management
Science and Engineering Prof.
William Perry; Co-Director of the
Carnegie Moscow Center's non-pro
liferation program Alexci Arbatov;
and Thomas Isaacs, director of the of
fice of policy, planning and special
studies at Lawrence Livermore Na

tional Laboratory.
"Perhaps the only viable short-term
solution [to reducing emissions] that
will reach usable scale quickly will be
nuclear power," President John Hen
nessy said in his introductory remarks.
Hie speakers agreed on the impor
tance of civilian nuclear programs as a
means of reducing carbon emissions.
"Nuclear power has a number of se
rious advantages in terms of its impacts

on global climate change," Isaacs
said.
But Perry painted a grim picture
of the potential consequences of
unchecked proliferation, arguing that
gains from nuclear power have to he
carefully balanced against its costs —
including increased risks that terror
ists or rogue nations could acquire
weapons-grade fissile material.
He cited a study that predicted
more than 100,000 deaths and mas
sive political and economic disrup
tion if a nuclear device detonated in a
major city.
"The social chaos that would be
engendered by fear would be
unimaginable," Perry warned. "We
also concluded that there was no way
of preventing the movement of a
bomb or fissile material into an
American city.There is no real way of
defending against such an attack."
Panelists agreed that proliferation
risks were on the rise.
"If the trends which are currently
going on continue, then the combat
deployment of a nuclear device for
the first time since August l l )45 in the
next five to 10 years will become very
likely or unavoidable." said Arbatov,
a former member of the Russian
Duma (parliament).
Nevertheless, Perry said that the
continuing spread of nuclear power
was an inevitable answer to growing
energy needs.
"Many experts believe that major

Nuclear power has a number of
serious advantages in terms of its
impact on global climate change.

increases in new generations of nu
clear plants are a critical part of the
solution," he said. "Even if you don't
agree with that, it's clear that many
other nations do."
"There is likely to be a growth
and. more importantly, a spread of
nuclear power plants around the
world," Isaacs said, noting that 56
countries currently operate research
reactors and 40 other nations have
expressed interest in developing a
civilian nuclear capability.
With interest in nuclear know
how disseminating all over the world,
Isaacs argued that only a close watch
on the supply of nuclear material
could prevent a terrorist nuclear de
vice.
The vast majority of these coun
tries do not operate their own facili
ties for the enrichment of uranium, he
said, instead relying on the purchase

of nuclear fuel from nuclear weapons
states by the terms of the Non-Prolif
eration Treaty.
"I believe the only thing between
us and a national or sub-national
group getting their hands on a nu
clear weapon is the material itself."
Isaacs said.
Instead of attempting to discour
age nations from developing their
own power facilities and driving them
to construct their own enrichment
plants, which are harder to monitor,
Isaacs said nuclear weapons states
should continue to make nuclear ma
terial available on the open market to
nations that want it.
"I believe they should have the
right to move to nuclear power once
they've met certain protocols like
signing on to lAEA [International
Atomic Energy Agency] inspec
tions," he said.

Isaacs added that major nuclear
powers should also help fledgling
civilian nuclear programs get access
to facilities for reprocessing nuclear
waste.
"I think we've got to stop lecturing
people, and we've got to start leading
by example," he said. "We need to
work with them as partners. We need
to give them a stake in the success of
these reprocessing plants. Otherwise,
it's going to look like the 'haves' try
ing to keep the have-nots' out of the
business."
Although the speakers said that a
renewed commitment to nuclear
safeguards could harness the positive
aspects of nuclear power while miti
gating proliferation risks, they noted
that popular support for such meas
ures is still lacking.
Arbatov said that the United
States and Russia have engaged in "a
sadomasochistic effort of dismantling
the nuclear arms control regime" at
precisely the time when "more strin
gent control and accounting" are
needed.
"The solution must lie in estab
lishing protocols for how nuclear
plants are operated and how nuclear
fuels are handled," Perry said.
"There are many alternatives but no
political will [to] enact them on a
global scale."
