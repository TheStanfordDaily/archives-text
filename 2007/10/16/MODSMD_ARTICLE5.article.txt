When she began teaching at a charter
school in San Jose this summer, Lizzie
Choi '() l ) certainly knew enough about
her subject to teach it to a group of

ninth grade students. However, she was
not prepared for how challenging managing a
classroom can he.
"1 was humbled by how difficult it was,"
Choi said. "I faced questions that should have
been second-nature to me as I teacher that 1

couldn't answer."
She said students often take for granted how much
responsibility teachers have. Teachers must cultivate a
learning environment while catering to different
learning styles, balancing tension among students for
attention and motivation and recognizing the need for
both discipline and rewards in the classroom.
"I realized it's so much more than just copying
worksheets." Choi said.
So, too, has the state of California.
Aspiring teachers like Choi will be required to
demonstrate more than their knowledge of reading,
writing and arithmetic before being permitted to teach
in California public schools under new guidelines de
veloped in part by researchers at Stanford's School of
Education.
On Oct. 4, with the support of over 30 institutions
throughout the state, the California Commission on
Teacher Credentialing unanimously approved the
Performance Assessment for California Teachers

(PACT). The innovative assess

ment model moves beyond paper and

pencil tests to evaluate a potential teacher's

performance in the classroom.
Before they are allowed to step into ;i classroom on
their own. prospective teachers will have to develop
lesson plans, evaluate student work and address spe
cial needs of students who have learning differences or
arc learning English while enrolled in a traditional
curriculum.
Education Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond, one of
the lead researchers in developing the PACT model,
said that the current crcdcntialing system docs not ad
equately evaluate how prepared an instructor is to
teach in a classroom. The current system consists pri
marily of a multiple choice section that tests teachers'
knowledge of a specific subject area and presents only
hypothetical situations to which they must respond.
"There is no existing assessment in the require
ments prior to PACT that actually requires you to
