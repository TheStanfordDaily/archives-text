When she began teaching at a charter
school in San Jose this summer, Lizzie
Choi '() l ) certainly knew enough about
her subject to teach it to a group of

ninth grade students. However, she was
not prepared for how challenging managing a
classroom can he.
"1 was humbled by how difficult it was,"
Choi said. "I faced questions that should have
been second-nature to me as I teacher that 1

couldn't answer."
She said students often take for granted how much
responsibility teachers have. Teachers must cultivate a
learning environment while catering to different
learning styles, balancing tension among students for
attention and motivation and recognizing the need for
both discipline and rewards in the classroom.
"I realized it's so much more than just copying
worksheets." Choi said.
So, too, has the state of California.
Aspiring teachers like Choi will be required to
demonstrate more than their knowledge of reading,
writing and arithmetic before being permitted to teach
in California public schools under new guidelines de
veloped in part by researchers at Stanford's School of
Education.
On Oct. 4, with the support of over 30 institutions
throughout the state, the California Commission on
Teacher Credentialing unanimously approved the
Performance Assessment for California Teachers

(PACT). The innovative assess

ment model moves beyond paper and

pencil tests to evaluate a potential teacher's

performance in the classroom.
Before they are allowed to step into ;i classroom on
their own. prospective teachers will have to develop
lesson plans, evaluate student work and address spe
cial needs of students who have learning differences or
arc learning English while enrolled in a traditional
curriculum.
Education Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond, one of
the lead researchers in developing the PACT model,
said that the current crcdcntialing system docs not ad
equately evaluate how prepared an instructor is to
teach in a classroom. The current system consists pri
marily of a multiple choice section that tests teachers'
knowledge of a specific subject area and presents only
hypothetical situations to which they must respond.
"There is no existing assessment in the require
ments prior to PACT that actually requires you to

show you can do the job," Darling-
Hammond said. "| PACT isj really
professionalizing teaching in a way
that other professions have already
done."
Under the PACT model, prospec
tive teachers will have to put togeth
er a portfolio planning a unit of in
struction.They will plan a lesson tak
ing into account differences in their
students' learning styles, videotape
their teaching and write daily reflec
tions on how to revise plans for the
next day. Trained scorers will evalu
ate the portfolio using a systematic
rubric before awarding a credential
to the candidate.
The new requirements will go into
effect this spring, about five years
after a consortium of universities, in
cluding Stanford and the University
of California system, first produced
PACT.
Darling-Hammond said the goal
is to prepare teachers to understand
professional teaching standards
rather than stifling innovation in the
classroom.
"PACT is training teachers to un
derstand the underlying principles of
teaching and learning so they can be
creative in teaching their kids." she
said. "It's standards without a
straightjacket."
She likened teaching to profes
sions in law and medicine, as
prospective lawyers and doctors
must pass extensive hands-on exami
nations before practicing in the field.
An aspiring high school math and
science teacher, Choi, who is current
ly an intern at the Department of Ed
ucation through the Stanford in
Washington program, learned how
critical understanding pedagogy is
before a teacher enters the class
room. She hopes to enroll in the
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP) after graduation to de
velop a stronger understanding of
tried-and-true teaching methods.
"How you teach and what you
know really affects student achieve
ment." Choi said. "The intent of this
change is really on track with current
research."
Darling-Hammond led a 2005 re
search study concluding that certi
fied teachers consistently produce
stronger student achievement gains
than uncertified teachers. She said
that because the state of California
has responded to teacher shortages
by lowering standards and refusing
to improve financial incentives, in
tensified training will improve
teacher recruitment and retention.
"Teachers who have more prepa
ration actually stay longer in the
classroom " Darling-Hammond said.
"People who pass this assessment are
likely to stay in teaching longer be
cause they are better prepared to
succeed."
Some scholars point to recruit
ment programs like the popular Teach
for America as examples of programs
that, while well-intentioned, produce

educators who have not yet under
gone the same kind of rigorous assess
ment as credentialed teachers before
they enter the classroom.
Leticia Rodriguez "06. an educa
tion coordinator at the Alliance for a
Better Community in Los Angeles,
served as a campus campaign manag
er for the Bay Area Teach for Amer
ica recruitment team during her sen
ior year. She said that the proposed
assessment could be an important
tool to assist candidates in improving
their pedagogical skills.
But she said that requiring recent
college graduates to complete the
credentialing process before they
can get into the classroom would not
serve the mission of Teach tor Amer
ica. which recruits undergraduates
upon graduation to teach for two
years in lower-income urban and
rural schools nationwide.
Rodriguez emphasized that Teach
for America seeks to close the
achievement gap for students in low
income rural and urban communities
and does not necessarily target those
who want to enter the teaching pro
fession as a career.
"In my time as a recruiter, I real
ized that it is difficult enough to get
the top college graduates from across
the country to commit two years to
teach." Rodriguez said. "It would be
even more difficult to get them to
commit to an unpaid year-long
teacher credentialing program be
fore teaching for two years, especial
ly when most candidates are not
going to stay in the classroom over
the long-term."
Rodriguez said corps members at
tend an intensive summer institute
that prepares them to teach full-time.
Teach for America recruits are also
required to earn their preliminary
teaching credential during their two
years of teaching.
"In my time working as a recruiter
for Teach for America, we acknowl
edged that a summer of training is
going to have its limits in terms of
depth of instruction and how well it
can prepare future teachers when
compared to a year-long teacher
training program," Rodriguez said.
"However, Teach for America does
their best to ensure that the summer
institute has the highest quality of in
struction. and they continue to pro
vide support for corps members in
their years of teaching."
Rodriguez said that those advo
cating more intensive training must
recognize that corps members are
placed in some of the neediest
schools in the country where stu
dents would otherwise be taught by
substitutes or first-year teachers with
limited training.
"I have often heard from Teach
for America representatives and oth
ers that first-year teachers are going
to face several challenges regardless
of the training they receive." Ro
driguez said. "More training is im
portant. but we really need to ensure
that the training is actually effective
in preparing classroom teachers for
such challenges."

after a consortium of universities, in

PACT.
Darling-Hammond said the goal
is to prepare teachers to understand
professional teaching standards
rather than stifling innovation in the
classroom.
"PACT is training teachers to un
derstand the underlying principles of
teaching and learning so they can be
creative in teaching their kids." she
said. "It's standards without a
straightjacket."
She likened teaching to profes

prospective lawyers and doctors
must pass extensive hands-on exami
nations before practicing in the field.
An aspiring high school math and
science teacher, Choi, who is current
ly an intern at the Department of Ed
ucation through the Stanford in
Washington program, learned how
critical understanding pedagogy is
before a teacher enters the class
room. She hopes to enroll in the
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP) after graduation to de
velop a stronger understanding of
tried-and-true teaching methods.
"How you teach and what you
know really affects student achieve
ment." Choi said. "The intent of this
change is really on track with current
research."
Darling-Hammond led a 2005 re
search study concluding that certi
fied teachers consistently produce
stronger student achievement gains
than uncertified teachers. She said
that because the state of California
has responded to teacher shortages
by lowering standards and refusing
to improve financial incentives, in
tensified training will improve
teacher recruitment and retention.
"Teachers who have more prepa
ration actually stay longer in the
classroom " Darling-Hammond said.
"People who pass this assessment are
likely to stay in teaching longer be
cause they are better prepared to
succeed."
Some scholars point to recruit
ment programs like the popular Teach
for America as examples of programs
that, while well-intentioned, produce

educators who have not yet under
gone the same kind of rigorous assess
ment as credentialed teachers before
they enter the classroom.
Leticia Rodriguez "06. an educa

served as a campus campaign manag

assessment could be an important
tool to assist candidates in improving
their pedagogical skills.
But she said that requiring recent
college graduates to complete the
credentialing process before they
can get into the classroom would not
serve the mission of Teach tor Amer
ica. which recruits undergraduates
upon graduation to teach for two
years in lower-income urban and
rural schools nationwide.
Rodriguez emphasized that Teach
for America seeks to close the
achievement gap for students in low
income rural and urban communities
and does not necessarily target those
who want to enter the teaching pro
fession as a career.
"In my time as a recruiter, I real
ized that it is difficult enough to get
the top college graduates from across
the country to commit two years to
teach." Rodriguez said. "It would be
even more difficult to get them to
commit to an unpaid year-long
teacher credentialing program be
fore teaching for two years, especial
ly when most candidates are not
going to stay in the classroom over
the long-term."
Rodriguez said corps members at
tend an intensive summer institute
that prepares them to teach full-time.
Teach for America recruits are also
required to earn their preliminary
teaching credential during their two
years of teaching.
"In my time working as a recruiter
for Teach for America, we acknowl
edged that a summer of training is
going to have its limits in terms of
depth of instruction and how well it
can prepare future teachers when
compared to a year-long teacher
training program," Rodriguez said.
"However, Teach for America does
their best to ensure that the summer
institute has the highest quality of in
struction. and they continue to pro
vide support for corps members in
their years of teaching."
Rodriguez said that those advo
cating more intensive training must
recognize that corps members are
placed in some of the neediest
schools in the country where stu
dents would otherwise be taught by
substitutes or first-year teachers with
limited training.
"I have often heard from Teach
for America representatives and oth
ers that first-year teachers are going
to face several challenges regardless
of the training they receive." Ro
driguez said. "More training is im
portant. but we really need to ensure
that the training is actually effective
in preparing classroom teachers for
such challenges."

When she began teaching at a charter
school in San Jose this summer, Lizzie
Choi '() l ) certainly knew enough about
her subject to teach it to a group of

ninth grade students. However, she was
not prepared for how challenging managing a
classroom can he.
"1 was humbled by how difficult it was,"
Choi said. "I faced questions that should have
been second-nature to me as I teacher that 1

couldn't answer."
She said students often take for granted how much
responsibility teachers have. Teachers must cultivate a
learning environment while catering to different
learning styles, balancing tension among students for
attention and motivation and recognizing the need for
both discipline and rewards in the classroom.
"I realized it's so much more than just copying
worksheets." Choi said.
So, too, has the state of California.
Aspiring teachers like Choi will be required to
demonstrate more than their knowledge of reading,
writing and arithmetic before being permitted to teach
in California public schools under new guidelines de
veloped in part by researchers at Stanford's School of
Education.
On Oct. 4, with the support of over 30 institutions
throughout the state, the California Commission on
Teacher Credentialing unanimously approved the
Performance Assessment for California Teachers

(PACT). The innovative assess

ment model moves beyond paper and

pencil tests to evaluate a potential teacher's

performance in the classroom.
Before they are allowed to step into ;i classroom on
their own. prospective teachers will have to develop
lesson plans, evaluate student work and address spe
cial needs of students who have learning differences or
arc learning English while enrolled in a traditional
curriculum.
Education Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond, one of
the lead researchers in developing the PACT model,
said that the current crcdcntialing system docs not ad
equately evaluate how prepared an instructor is to
teach in a classroom. The current system consists pri
marily of a multiple choice section that tests teachers'
knowledge of a specific subject area and presents only
hypothetical situations to which they must respond.
"There is no existing assessment in the require
ments prior to PACT that actually requires you to

show you can do the job," Darling-
Hammond said. "| PACT isj really
professionalizing teaching in a way
that other professions have already
done."
Under the PACT model, prospec
tive teachers will have to put togeth
er a portfolio planning a unit of in
struction.They will plan a lesson tak
ing into account differences in their
students' learning styles, videotape
their teaching and write daily reflec
