### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) —The
skeleton of what is believed to he a new dinosaur
species — a 105-foot plant-eater that is among
the largest dinosaurs ever found — has been un
covered in Argentina, scientists said Monday.
"This is one of the biggest in the world and
one of the most complete of these giants that
exist."said Jorge Calvo.directorof the paleontol
ogy center at the National University of Com
ahue, Argentina.
Scientists said the giant herbivore walked the
Earth some 88 million years ago, during the late
Cretaceous period.
Calvo said the neck alone must have been 56
feet long,and by studying the vertebrae, they fig
ured the tail probably measured 49 feet. The di
nosaur reached over 43 feet tall, and the excavat
ed spinal column weighed about 9 tons when ex
cavated. One neck vertebra alone measured
more than 3 feet high.
