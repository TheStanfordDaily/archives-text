Ronald Reagan"
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican
presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani on Tues
day ridiculed Democratic rival Barack
Obama for saying he would meet, without
precondition, with leaders of renegade na
tions.
The Obama campaign answered back, ar
guing that Giuliani may not want to engage
in diplomacy with outlaw leaders but he's
been willing to take their money.
Addressing the Republican Jewish Coali
tion. Giuliani described Obama's offer, dur
ing a presidential debate in July, to meet as
president with the leaders of Iran, Syria,
Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea.
Then he went on to explain that Ronald
Reagan negotiated with the communists,"
Giuliani said, pausing and sighing."! say this
most respectfully: You're not Ronald Rea
gan, you know?"
fhe audience in a downtown Washington
hotel laughed and clapped.
"Here's what Ronald Reagan did before
he negotiated with communists." the former
New York mayor continued. "First he called
them the Evil Empire .Then he took missiles,
and pointed the missiles at Russian cities
with names on them.
"Then he said, in a very nice way, 'Let's
negotiate."'
Obama's campaign had a ready response.
"While Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clin
ton do not think we should engage in the
type of strong diplomacy practiced by
Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, Obama
does," Obama spokesman Bill Burton said.
"And given the hefty fee that Hugo Chavez's
oil company paid Rudy Giuliani's firm, he
apparently thinks we shouldn't talk to
Chavez, but it's fine to take his money."
Giuliani's law firm, Houston-based
Bracewell & Giuliani, represented an Ameri
can subsidiary of an oil company controlled by
Chavez, the Venezuelan president. 1 he compa

Dalai Lama brushes off Chinese
anger at Medal of Honor award
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Dalai
Lama, after meeting privately Tuesday with
President Bush, brushed off China's furious
reaction to U.S. celebrations this week in his
honor.
"That always happens," the exiled spiritu
al leader of Tibet's Buddhists said with a
laugh, speaking to reporters gathered out
side his downtown Washington hotel.
The White House defended the meeting
in the president's residence and dismissed
Beijing's warning that the talks and the
awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal
to him on Wednesday would damage rela
tions between the United States and China.
When asked if he had a message for Chinese
President Hu Jintao, the Dalai Lama playfully
patted a reporter on the cheek and said, "You
are not a representative of Hu Jintao."
Ihe Dalai Lama says he wants "real auton
omy," not independence, for Tibet. But China
demonizes the spiritual leader and believes
the United States is honoring a separatist.
Indians top Red Sox for 3-1 lead
CLEVELAND (AP) — Led by a throw
back pitcher who looks as if he stepped out
of their 1948 team photo, the Cleveland Indi
ans moved one win from another crack at
winning an elusive World Series title.
Pumping his arms with an old-school
windup from yesteryear, Paul Byrd blanked
Boston long enough and the Indians used a
seven-run rampage in the fifth inning to beat
the Red Sox 7-3'l\iesday night.
A victory in Game 5 on Thursday night
would send Cleveland back to the World Se
ries for the first time since lW7.when the In
dians lost a seven-game thriller to the Flori
da Marlins.
After a day off, the Indians will turn to ace
C.C. Sabathia, their left-handed leader.
Boston's Josh Beckett, who beat Cleveland
in Game 1 at home, will try to send the series
back to Fenway Park.
