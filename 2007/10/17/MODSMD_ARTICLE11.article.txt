# Got (raw) milk?
## Kenyan challenges Western nutrition 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Living on an organic diet saved his life,
Kenyan native Willson Kimeli Naiy
omah told students and faculty Tues
day night in a lecture in the Geology
Corner. Upon arriving in America for his stud
ies, Naiyomah, who is now pursuing a M.S. in Bi
ology at Stanford, was struck at the culture of
abundance.
"I expected nobility," he said. "So I went to Albertson's.
And lo and behold, the fruits were ripe: they looked like they
had just dropped from the tree. I'd never seen such round,
nice looking fruit. I went to the milk aisle, which is what I
wanted,and there was milk! Milk everywhere!?
But Naiyomah's enthusiasm abruptly ended the minute
he drank the processed and pasteurized milk.
"It hit me so hard." he said. "It tasted terrible. You know
when you anticipate something you want so much and it an
ticlimaxes like that? It was awful."
Naiyomah was used to the non-processed milk he drank
while growing up in the Massai village of Enoosaen, Kenya.
He received his undergraduate education at the University of
Oregon after a 1996 Washington Post article prompted
Americans to contribute funds.
Soon. Naiyomah realized that all the food he ate in Amer
ica, which had been processed and sterilized for longer shelf
lives, was not the virile, life-giving food that he had eaten
from his youth in Kenya. Before long, he developed both lac
tose intolerance and Crohn's disease,an inflammatory condi
tion of the gastrointestinal tract.
"It was quite ironic," he said."l was being buried in food.
But 1 was starving in plenty."
Lactose intolerance did not simply deprive Naiyomah of
his favorite beverage: it also struck him psychologically
"That was the disease of very few people who lived in
cities, those who wore suits and glasses. So we in the villages
thought of it as the 'disease of the important people.' I was
supposed to go back to my village and build a hospital, but
now I was dying in America. I began to think that maybe 1 had

sinned and brought a curse upon myself."
Before long, he could hardly be recognized as the lean,
healthy young Massai man that first stepped off the plane to
America.
"When 1 came from Africa. 1 was only 105 pounds — chis
eled. skinny, healthy, and. though you could almost see my
bones, very strong. Soon 1 blow up to 169 pounds, after my
first girlfriend introduced me to Big Mac."
After offering the gift of a cow to America after 9/11 on
behalf of his tribe, Naiyomah, now withering away in a dorm
room at Stanford, found out about a man in Fresno called
Mark McAfee who produced raw, organic milk.
"It occurred to me that there's something about the natu
ral state of things," he said. "Life begets life; living food gives
life to living things."
Naiyomah said that when he first drank the raw milk, he
expected to become very ill. However, the taste in his mouth
reminded him of his childhood days in Kenya, when he would
take care of other villagers' cows. At these jobs, he would
often drink fresh milk from the cows' udders. That was the
exact same taste he experienced now.
"I did not feel an upset stomach," he said."l was emotion
al. I felt like something had finally come to save my life."
Soon Naiyomah ate only organic foods, and his recovery
was nothing short of astounding.
Through his experience, Naiyomah realized that—
though the western world's diet had managed to rid food of
all bacteria, thus eliminating any chance of infectious dis
eases — it had also taken away the beneficial bacteria that
also existed in foods.
"The problem is that microbes are not really our ene
mies." he said. "Certain vitamins such as vitamin K can only
be made by bacteria."
Though Naiyomah did not outright advocate all individu
als to switch to the diet of indigenous African tribes, he did
challenge the audience to think about what they eat.
"In western eating, you always have things in nice cute
packages, it's offered to you. you don't know where it came
from, you just believe, and cat it. It's not going to kill you,
maybe later, but not now," he said. "We are what we eat."
