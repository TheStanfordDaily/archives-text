## High demand for CS majors 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
A computer science (C'S) degree from Stanford has
always been a valuable possession, and it is only get
ting more lucrative.
The National Association of Colleges and Employ
ers reported on Sep. 12 that the average starting salary
nationwide for a 2007 CS graduate was $53,051, a 4.5
percent increase from the year before.
The salary increases were in part due to a nation
wide decrease in CS degrees in recent years.The Com
puting Research Association reported that only 10.20(-Â»
bachelor's degrees in CS were awarded in 2006. com
pared to more than 14.000 degrees per year at the start
of the decade.
Increasing demand leads to more competition to
hire those holding CS degrees, allowing students to be
selective when confronted with various job offers, in
turn raising salary offers from employers.
"Our graduates have the pick of the job market,"
said Verna Wong, a CS student services specialist.
Students agreed, citing the ease of finding a job in
the tech sector.
"It's pretty easy to get interest from a lot of differ
ent companies," said CS graduate student Matt Ja
chowski.a former intern for instant messaging compa
ny Meebo.
"A lot of my friends' offers are between $70,000 and
$90,000 a year." said Chase Yarbrough '07. a CS major.
"1 haven't heard of anyone who's not content with
their salary."

While CS degrees have decreased nationwide, the
number of CS majors at Stanford has stayed relative
ly consistent throughout the decade. Stanford grant
ed 70 CS bachelor's degrees in 2007 and 82 in 2006.
By comparison, there were 79 majors in the depart
ment in l l ) l ) 8. On the graduate level, according to
Wong, the department "hadn't noticed any decline in
applicants."
The increasing popularity of interdisciplinary ma
jors such as symbolic systems could cut into CS degree
numbers. Conversely, the resurgence of interest in
technology brought about by the Web 2.0 phenome
non could lead to a boom in C'S popularity.
According to Axess figures, there are over 350 stu
dents enrolled in either CS 106 A or CS 106 X this quar
ter, which Jachowski said is a one-third increase from
last year.
Overall,despite the ups and downs of Internet busi
ness, Silicon Valley remains an excellent job market for
qualified CS majors.
"There's a feeling of high demand for top-notch en
gineers," said Adam Sadovsky "07. who currently
works for Google. "And it's easier for a Stanford stu
dent to find jobs interesting to him or her. and to find
a company with matching interests.There are so many
of them looking, both start-ups and large companies."
"The truth is that there aren't enough programmers
to go around." Jachowski said. "It's a good time to
graduate."
