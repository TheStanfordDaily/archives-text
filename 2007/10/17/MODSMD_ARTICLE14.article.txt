## Willpower not enough to break bad habits Emotions play integral role, study shows 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Willpower alone may not be
enough to conquer those extra
pounds, addictive habits and other
vices we struggle with every day, ac
cording to a recent feature story in
Stanford Medicine Magazine. And
this is not necessarily under our con
trol.
The editors of the magazine decid
ed that the rising obesity rates and
prevalence of illnesses nationwide
from seemingly preventable bad
habits warranted a more in-depth
look at why people don't always do
what is good for them.
The results of their studies re
vealed a recent shift in the thinking
among health-behavior researchers,
including many Stanford experts, who
concluded that willpower is not al
ways enough in the long run.
According to the article, emotion
al triggers are often too great to com
bat problems using sheer willpower.
"In many disciplines — medicine,
economics — scientists have ignored
a huge aspect of what it means to be
human: the emotional aspect." noted
Assoc. Psychology Prof. James Gross
in the magazine article.
Along with emotional effects on
our brain chemistry, environment can
have an impact on decision-making in
a way that is too powerful for willpow
er to combat. Examples cited in the
article include environments that
readily provide alcohol, discourage
adequate sleep and encourage poor
nutrition, such as college campuses.
According to clinical psychologist
Cynthia Castro, a researcher at the
Stanford Prevention Research Cen
ter (SPRC), it is not the experts that
need convincing, but everyday people
for whom chronic bad habits affect
health.
"Most behavior scientists don't
give a lot of credit to willpower as the
key to changing health habits," she
said. "There are a variety of forces

that compel us to act the way we do.
Stanford student or not. this applies to
each of us."
"It is important to have drive and
determination to accomplish things,"
she added,"hut it's equally important
to realize that you need to learn some
new skills along the way."
A quick survey of Stanford stu
dents showed a diverse range of
thinking about willpower and
whether it indeed has limits.
Janise On 4 11 was not surprised to
hear that willpower alone cannot
overpower all problems.
"I think people have willpower to
a certain extent," she said, "but I also
feel there are a lot of times you tell
yourself to do things and continually
do something else, and you wonder
why."
Her roommate, Effie Fine '11,
added that many problems require
support and encouragement from
peers to combat and should not have
to be faced alone.
Riddhi Mittal '11 had a different
opinion.
"The only thing you ever need is
willpower to get what you want." she
said. "Where there's a will, there's a
way."
For those who are convinced they
need more than willpower to tackle
some of their most difficult struggles,
Castro, who has done behavioral re
search on adults, offered some practical
suggestions for students to consider.
Castro found that success in
changing chronic habits comes from a
variety of methods besides sheer
willpower, including realistic goal set
ting, anticipating obstacles, getting so
cial support and, perhaps most impor
tantly. challenging irrationally nega
tive thoughts. Some of these methods
require the help of professionals, and
some imply a need for environmental
change.
"It would be a great idea to get
some of the Vaden staff together with
some of us researchers at the SPRC to
come up with feasible ideas to create
a healthier campus environment and
teach students some of the key per
sonal skills for healthier living," Cas-
tro said.
The article was not meant to dis
credit willpower entirely, however.
For the article. Gross asked stu
dents to complete math problems in
the presence of loud, funny skits play
ing on a monitor. ITie students per
formed better when told to think of
the math exercise as a challenge to
their willpower, he said.
"If we think of temptations such
as candy bars as tests of our willpow
er, then we see these temptations in a
whole new light, and are much better
able to stick to our guns." he said.
