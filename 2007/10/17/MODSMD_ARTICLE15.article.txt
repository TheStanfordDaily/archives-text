### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08 and Vice President Mondaire
Jones '09 kicked off the Undergrad
uate Senate meeting last night with a
progress report on their activities
during the summer and fall. Avula
and Jones highlighted the fulfillment
of a number of their campaign goals,
though they were quick to admit
that some promises have proved un
tenable or have met some challenges
in coming to fruition.
Avula opened with an update on
the new Course Guide. He lauded
the success of the project, though he
admitted that the absence of qualita
tive data or a search function was
still a "serious problem" for the site's
success.

Avula said that adding qualita
tive data to the site is a long-term
goal, but several deans have rejected
the idea. He also proposed a new
"class resource guide" featuring a
textbook exchange, qualitative eval

The pair went on to discuss a
number of other student complaints
that the ASSU hopes to address in
the coming months.

for a Thanksgiving run.

trial was just that, a trial, to see what
we wanted to do to change it."he
said.
Avula also addressed the ASSU's
focus on sustainahility. but said he

added that he and Avula hoped to
work for the creation of a space sim

an idea also supported by Assistant
Dean for Student Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws.
"We've heard a lot of frustration
about the CoHo closing down."
Jones said. "We want to recreate that
space in Old Union. We're going to
be advocating to the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs."
The team also promised to do its
