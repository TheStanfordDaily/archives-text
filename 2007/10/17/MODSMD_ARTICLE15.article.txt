## Avula/Jones update Senate on goals 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08 and Vice President Mondaire
Jones '09 kicked off the Undergrad
uate Senate meeting last night with a
progress report on their activities
during the summer and fall. Avula
and Jones highlighted the fulfillment
of a number of their campaign goals,
though they were quick to admit
that some promises have proved un
tenable or have met some challenges
in coming to fruition.
Avula opened with an update on
the new Course Guide. He lauded
the success of the project, though he
admitted that the absence of qualita
tive data or a search function was
still a "serious problem" for the site's
success.

Avula said that adding qualita
tive data to the site is a long-term
goal, but several deans have rejected
the idea. He also proposed a new
"class resource guide" featuring a
textbook exchange, qualitative eval
uations and class scheduling infor
mation.
The pair went on to discuss a
number of other student complaints
that the ASSU hopes to address in
the coming months.
The president said he was disap
pointed that the trial run of the
ASSU Airport Shuttle Service faced
a few technical difficulties, and that
eight to ten people who had signed
up were skipped. However, Avula
said that the ASSU plans to work
out the glitches in the service in time
for a Thanksgiving run.
"The whole point of that spring

trial was just that, a trial, to see what
we wanted to do to change it."he
said.
Avula also addressed the ASSU's
focus on sustainahility. but said he
regretted the lack of composting op
tions at the Axe and Palm. Jones
added that he and Avula hoped to
work for the creation of a space sim
ilar to that of the now-closed Collo.
an idea also supported by Assistant
Dean for Student Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws.
"We've heard a lot of frustration
about the CoHo closing down."
Jones said. "We want to recreate that
space in Old Union. We're going to
be advocating to the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs."
The team also promised to do its
best to have a fairer Big Game ad
missions policy — currently seat as
signment priority will he based on
the accumulation of points from at
tending prior games. The stadium
only holds 3,000 seats.
"That means there are going to
be a lot of seniors who don't get to
see their final Big Game," Avula
said.
Avula and Jones also discussed a
number of in-the-works proposals.
'ITie pair said that they have been in
dialogue with Housing about incor
porating gender-neutral housing
into the Draw this spring. Avula said
the greatest difficulty with this pro
posal is that the Draw is currently
structured to provide gender bal
ance across residences.
The ASSU executives praised
the success of a last-minute post-
USC victory rally. They expressed
high hopes for social programming
in the winter and spring, such as a
Movie Express transportation serv
ice, a Stanford Idol competition and
a Row Block Party.
But it wasn't all optimism for
Avula and Jones. The pair explained
why a number of their ideas have
failed to pan out, including several
campaign promises.
Avula said that a number of plans
for improving Stanford Dining are
in the works — converting missed
meals into points, substituting per
sonal meals for guest meals and ro
tating dining hall themes.
But Avula said implementing

these ideas "may be a stretch."
Another major blow to Avula
and Jones' campaign hopes was the
failure to convince the University to
provide health care for graduate
students and their dependents.
I lowever, Avula advocated for the
creation of a single Web site consol
idating the publicity of various local
options.
Avula also regretfully admitted
that, despite previous hopes, the Big
Game Bonfire will not be revived.
"In our eyes it would have been
an unsuccessful event," Avula said.
"If we're talking about sustainabili
ty, it's kind of hypocritical.
"We were thinking about some
where out on Galvez Field." he
added, "but the size of the bonfire
would have been so small that it
wouldn't have been conducive to
the big size of the event" in the past.
Following Avula and Jones' pres
entation. Senator Stuart Baimel '09
recommended that the Senate take
a stand on Donald Rumsfeld's
Hoover Institution appointment.
Baimel is preparing statements for
and against Rumsfeld's new posi
tion in the hope that one will pass.
"It is imperative that we take a
stand on this issue sooner rather
than later," Baimel said. "I think it's
shameful that we haven't done any
thing on this yet, considering that so
many students are concerned about
it."
The meeting rounded up with the
submission of a bill for the appoint
ment of Bernard Fraga '08 and Lind
say Heyen J.D. '09 to the Constitu
tional Council.
