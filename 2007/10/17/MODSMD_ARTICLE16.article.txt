## Editorial Board Bush's veto blunder 
### 
President George W. Bush's veto of the
proposed expansion of the State Chil
dren's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) is a catastrophic bungle, with far
reaching implications for him and for chil
dren desperately in need of free health care.
The veto should never have happened. Now
that it has. Congress needs to act swiftly and
in unity to override it.
Such hope for bipartisan unity on the
SCHIP bill is not unfounded. The staunch
Republican following that the president has
managed to maintain up to this point has fi
nally taken a step back and begun opposing
him on the issue. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-
Utah) noted in an interview with New York
Times writer David Stout shortly after the
veto: "Unfortunately. 1 believe that some
have given the president bad advice on this
matter," and that supporting and passing the
current version of the children's health in
surance bill is the "morally right thing to
do." Hatch is just one of many Republicans
in the House and Senate who hope to over
ride President Bush's veto: Sens. Charles
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Gordon Smith (R-
Ore.) are two others who have vocally ex
pressed their disapproval of Bush's veto.
The widely supported bill, if passed,
would expand coverage from 6.6 million
American children to over 10 million unin
sured children. This whopping expansion
would increase Bush's proposed $30 billion
child health care budget by an additional
$35 billion, while covering an unprecedent
ed number of needy children.
Pertinent for California youth. SCHIP
currently covers about 800.000 children in
the Golden State; none of these families are
qualified for Medicaid and their family in
comes are no more than 200 percent above
the Federal Poverty Level, as reported by
UC-San Francisco. And according to The
Los Angeles Times, "In California, [SCI 11PJ
is Healthy Families, the highly successful
program that matches every state dollar
with two from the federal government and
entices parents to obtain and contribute to
health coverage for their kids."

President Bush has told the public and
Congress that he believes the proposed ex
pansion unnecessarily furthers a federalized
health care system. Although SCHIP is ad
ministered by states, it is indeed jointly fund
ed by the federal and state governments,
with the federal government matching state
funds up to a certain limit .This aspect of fed
eral involvement seems to have struck a
chord of discomfort in the Bush administra
tion.
As a compromise. Bush has hinted that
he would be willing to expand the program
by about $5 billion, less than one fifth the
proposed expansion. Regardless of the pres
ident's worries about a federalized health
care system, we need to keep the big picture
in mind: the health care needs of children in
this country should be adequately provided
for, and Bush's suggested compromise
would not accomplish this task.
l ime is of the essence, too. The original
SC'MIP began in 1997 and was scheduled to
last through the 2007 federal fiscal year. If
some version of the bill does not pass before
the program expires in November, millions
of children will be left without insurance.
Because of this potential catastrophe, the
president likely expects Congress to crawl
back to him with a watered-down version of
the bill.
The Senate has enough votes to override
Bush's veto; the I louse is where the true bat
tle will take place, with Representatives
about 20 votes short of the necessary two
thirds supermajority. Although there is a
glimmer of hope when the override bill
comes to the House floor tomorrow, the
prospects are rather dim.
If the House cannot override the veto,
Congress must still take advantage of the
overwhelming support for the SCHIP bill in
an effort to negotiate a stronger version
than the president proposes. With both De
mocrats and Republicans rallying for an
override of what is only Bush's fourth veto
of his presidency, we can only hope that a
bright future awaits SCHIP and the unin
sured children of America.
