# The 						Lowly Interns
## Delta is the devil 
### 
After flying to Accra, Ghana for a con
ference last weekend. 1 became thor
oughly convinced that customer
service at Delta no longer exists. I'm going to
have to recommend against flying Delta Air
lines anytime soon. There were allegations
last week that Delta's negligence allowed an
11-year-old traveling alone to be molested
by a stranger. I could've seen it coming.
Delta's in-flight magazine joyfully tells
you that they have been awarded best carri
er from the U.S. to Africa. What they don't
tell you is that they're almost the only one.
and it's hard to lose in a race against yourself.
Boarding my plane at JFK Airport in
New York, my happiness with having my
own row quickly faded when the pilot an
nounced there were 30 planes ahead of us in
line to use the runway.
Airlines fly hundreds of planes to hun
dreds of places every day. I low could some
one possibly screw up that badly? Thirty
planes? Donald Rumsfeld was better at war
planning than whoever runs JFK was at run
way scheduling. But don't tell me that Delta
has no role in the scheduling process. It took
us two hours to get in the air.
Leaving Accra a few days later, we again
sat on the runway for a painfully long time.
"Sorry about that folks," the head flight at
tendant announced after an hour. "We just
had a few technical problems, and we're all
ready to take off now." Great. Technical
problems. Just what you want to hear when
you're embarking on a really long flight
over a really big ocean.
Naturally, 1 missed my connection at
JFK. With the dozens of other people who
were equally screwed. I trudged through
customs and eventually made it to the desk
where they tell you how many hours you
have to wait for the next flight.
For me. there was no next flight. At least,
not at the same airport. I was told instead
that I was to be rerouted through La-
Guardia, which Wikipedia tells me is JFK's
less popular sibling. "You can get a taxi or
shuttle to LaGuardia down at ground trans
portation." the Delta agent informed me,
scribbling a flight number and time on my
now useless boarding pass. Wait a second, I
asked, isn't Delta at least going to give me a
vouchcr to cover the cab over there?
"Well we would, but the delay was caused
by air traffic control, so it wasn't our fault
and we don't provide a voucher."
"That's odd.They said on the plane it was
technical problems, and there aren't that
many flights leaving Accra."
"Well let me check." (furious typing),

"No, the computer says it was ATC, so we're
not responsible."
"Isn't Delta the one talking to ATC? Isn't
that what I'm paying you for? I didn't real
ize that wasn't included."
The desk agent pulled out her secret
weapon. "But you see, we're doing a lot for
you. We put you on another flight tonight,
and that's not even counting the money we
lose by not having you on the first flight. So
really we arc doing you a favor."
"You made me miss the first flight! It's
not like I somehow screwed up and now
you're helping me out. / was on your plane]"
"I'm very sorry," she said. But she didn't
sound very sorry. She sounded like she was
going to high-five the person next to her,
and say, "Ha, we got another one," as she
stamped a Looney Tunes tally mark in the
shape of a customer on the wall behind her.
The taxi cost $35. And when I got to La-
Guardia, I discovered there's a secret Delta
terminal for commuter flights. ITie JFK desk
agent forgot to tell me that. Another hour
gone.
When I finally got back to the Stanford
House in Washington, full of anger, my
friend Niko told me that on a Delta flight to
Russia, he walked back to the galley to ask
for tea for someone who wasn't feeling well.
"Oh. and would you like me to bring it to
him. too?" the stewardess snapped back in a
tone suggesting that he was asking the
equivalent of where the bombs were kept.
There's really no excuse for this kind of
nonsense from a company that is essentially
in the hospitality industry. Delta has slogans
like: "You'll love the way we fly," and
"Delta's ready when you are!" But saying it
doesn't make it true.
Don't tell me costs arc the problem.
Think of the man-hours freed up now that
everyone prints boarding passes at home.
The savings in ink and paper alone have got
to be enough to placate passengers inconve
nienced by your airline.
Instead. I'm out $35 and approximately
eight hours I would really like to have back.
I'm pretty sure I could write an angry email

and get some sort of apology and
make-up voucher. I may even get
one from writing this column. But
that's not the point. We expect
painful bureaucracy from the IRS,
I)MV. OSA and many other three
letter acronyms. But you shouldn't
have to pay for it. So much for cus
tomer service. And don't fly Delta.

The taxi cost $35. And when I got to La-
Guardia, I discovered there's a secret Delta
terminal for commuter flights. ITie JFK desk
agent forgot to tell me that. Another hour
gone.
When I finally got back to the Stanford
House in Washington, full of anger, my
friend Niko told me that on a Delta flight to
Russia, he walked back to the galley to ask
for tea for someone who wasn't feeling well.
"Oh. and would you like me to bring it to
him. too?" the stewardess snapped back in a
tone suggesting that he was asking the
equivalent of where the bombs were kept.
There's really no excuse for this kind of
nonsense from a company that is essentially
in the hospitality industry. Delta has slogans
like: "You'll love the way we fly," and
"Delta's ready when you are!" But saying it
doesn't make it true.
Don't tell me costs arc the problem.
Think of the man-hours freed up now that
everyone prints boarding passes at home.
The savings in ink and paper alone have got
to be enough to placate passengers inconve
nienced by your airline.
Instead. I'm out $35 and approximately
eight hours I would really like to have back.
I'm pretty sure I could write an angry email

and get some sort of apology and
make-up voucher. I may even get
one from writing this column. But
that's not the point. We expect
painful bureaucracy from the IRS,
I)MV. OSA and many other three
letter acronyms. But you shouldn't
have to pay for it. So much for cus
tomer service. And don't fly Delta.

Michael wishes that he, too, coultl
write a column with a rhyming name.
It could he called "Mike's Likes." Can
you think of something that rhymes
with Sugar? Tell them at sagarand
