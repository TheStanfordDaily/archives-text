# Toledo talks faith in democracy
## Peru's former president urges Latin America to confront health and education 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former Peruvian President Alejandro
Toledo called upon Latin American leaders
yesterday to make the social investments
needed to meet the challenges of poverty
and inequality and secure a future of sustain
able democratic development.
Speaking in conversation with Hoover
Senior Fellow Larry Diamond as part of the
School of Education's Cubberley Lecture
Series, Toledo Ph.D. '93 stressed the impor
tance of investing in nutrition, health and ed
ucation to ensure that democratic govern
ments meet the needs of their citizens in the
face of populist challenges from the left.
"If we are able to reduce poverty, in
equality, social exclusion, then people will
begin recovering faith in democracy again,"
he said. "Political democracy makes very lit
tle sense if ultimately it is not accompanied
by economic and social democracy at a
micro level."
Toledo, an economist who also earned

master's degrees in education and econom
ics from Stanford, spent time consulting the
United Nations and the World Bank before
being elected president of Peru in 20()1. Eco
nomic growth, he said, is an "indispensable
component" of democratic development,
but one that must be paired with social poli
cies to ensure that growth benefits all seg
ments of society.
"I don't believe in the effectiveness of
trickle down." he said. "We need to grow, but
at the same time, construct deliberate social
polices for the short term, and medium and
long run. I don't know any more effective
weapon in the world to free people from
poverty than investing in nutrition, health
and education."
During his tenure as president from 2001
to 2006. Toledo put this philosophy to work
by implementing a series of micro-credit
programs. One program,"juntos," made con
ditional loans of $30 to rural, impoverished
women. The move empowered the women,
who spent the money more effectively than
their male counterparts, who were
more prone to buying alcohol.
"The [International Monetary
Fund) went bananas." he said. "But I
don't know why the Nobel Prize
Committee has not discovered that
the best economists in the world are
poor women."
The programs also identified an
entire segment of the population,
roughly 20 percent, who were undoc
umented and did not show up in cen
sus tallies or economic reports.
"The whole macroeconomic fig
ure was bullshit." said the former
president, sporting a navy blue suit
and blue tie.
While enduring one of the highest
levels of inequality in the world,
Peru's economy has also been grow
ing consistently at five percent over
the last half-decade. The region.Tole
do said, now has a unique chance to
generate growth by further integrat
ing with the global economy.
"Now. like never before, Latin
America as a region has the enor
mous opportunity to make a signifi
cant jump to place itself in a very pref
erential place in the world economy."
he said.
With non-traditional exports such
as grapes and other agricultural prod
ucts booming, Peruvian producers
should be looking toward emerging
markets in China and India, Toledo
explained.
"I'm not very ambitious. I just
want five percent of the Chinese mar
ket," he deadpanned. drawing laughs

from the standing-room only audi
ence.
A self-described "statistical fluke,"
Toledo was one of lb children raised
in Cabana, a small village in the
Andes. I le first worked shining shoes
at the age of seven, going on to study
at the I Jniversity of San Francisco on
a soccer scholarship, tie went on to
become Peru's first president of in
digenous descent, inheriting a nation
described by Diamond as a"post-au
thoritarian shattered mess" following
the tumultuous presidency of Alberto
Fujimori.
Diamond, a co-editor of the Jour
nal of Democracy, described the dual
ity of attitudes toward democracy in
Latin America. There has been "as
tonishing progress" in the advance of
freedom on one hand, he said, going
along with "very high levels of dissat
isfaction in the way democracy is
working."
Much of the problem has
stemmed from perceptions of demo
cratic leaders as ineffective or cor
rupt. a conception populist leaders
such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez
and Bolivia's Evo Morales have
seized upon while espousing their
own brand of "21st century social
ism." Over half of Latin Americans
express a generally positive view of
democracy. Diamond said, but 70 per
cent see little or no equality in their
countries' laws.
For Toledo, whose approval rat
ings as president once dropped as low
as 10 percent, leadership stems from

having a long-term vision for growth
and success.
"A leader is one who has the
courage to make national positions
thinking for the next generation,
rather than making government poli
cy thinking for the next election." he
said.
"How do we get a leader, and not
a [politician), elected as president of
the United States?" responded Dia
mond.
Toledo and his wife. Eliane Karp-
Toledo, a lecturer at the School of Ed
ucation and the Department of An
thropological Sciences, settled down
on the Farm in 2006.T01ed0 spent last
year reflecting on his term as presi
dent while serving as a visiting fellow
at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences.This year, he
accepted an invitation from Dia
mond to join the Center on Democ
racy. Development and the Rule of
Law, part of the University's Free
man Spogli Institute for Internation
al Studies (FSI), as a distinguished
scholar.
Responding to a question from
the audience, Toledo described his re
turn to Stanford as a "soft landing"
after the "intense experience" of
serving as chief executive of a nation
of nearly 30 million people.
"My friend,every player in a game
needs a rest." he said. "Give me a
break."
