## Al Gore, really? You sure?

The Nobel Peace Prize just isn't what it
used to be. For the second straight
year, the prize, which counts Lech
Walesa. Mikhail Gorbachev and Aung San
Suu Kyi amongst its luminaries, was recently
awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Commit
tee to a distinguished recipient who ... had
nothing to do with peace.
There is. interestingly, not a set mission
statement or criterion for awarding the
prize. Gore and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change were cited "for
their efforts to build up and disseminate
greater knowledge about man-made climate
change, and to lay the foundations for the
measures that are needed to counteract such
change." Whatever the contribution of A!
Gore and the IPCC to promoting a compre
hensive approach to global warming, this is
hogwash. 1 Ie should not have won the prize.
Even more surprising, this is not the first
time the prize has gone to an environmental
ist. The forgotten Wangari Maathi won in
2(M)4. mostly for planting 30 million trees
across Africa. I doubt even the nominating
committee can remember her name now.
There are many environmentalists across

the world. Why Maathi? The committee
never made that clear. It's truly hard to
argue that either Maathi or Gore has con
tributed to peace on a level with the Dalai
Lama (winner in 1989). Sorry folks, it just
can't be done.
The nominating committee is making the
interesting argument that combating global
warming will lead to a more peaceful world.
While this is certainly something for aca
demics and policymakers to debate, it's not
certain.
And does Gore really need the Nobel
Prize anyway? The debate in the U.S. over
global warming has fundamentally changed
â€” companies and universities are compet
ing to be the most green. Even the U.S.. the
last bastion of capitalism and oil conglomer

ates, is moving toward recognizing and ad
dressing global warming. The man already
won an Academy Award this past year, and a
consolation-prize dinette set for his second
place finish in the 2000 presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize does not confer
much more attention on Gore than has al
ready been lavished by the media.
Burmese monks courageously protested
against a regime, leading to the deaths of
many of them. The Vatican remains unrec
ognized for its extensive diplomatic efforts
around the world (John Paul II never won).
South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun
and North Korean supremo Kim Jong-11
agreed to begin negotiations to formally
end the Korean War. While Al Gore has
done good work on behalf of the environ
ment. the committee should have higher
priorities than simply conferring legitimacy
and prestige on a cause that really has noth
ing to do with peace. And if the committee
cannot find a nominee who has contributed
to a narrower definition of "peace," then it
shouldn't award it to anyone, which is a
