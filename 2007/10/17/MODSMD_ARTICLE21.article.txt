From Kookooland

I am honored that Kai Stinchcombe has
nominated me ("Rumsfeld and other
Hoover Institution kooks," Oct. 11) to be
the first Kook at the Hoover Institution,
but I wonder whether I deserve that honor.
According to the dictionary, a kook is "a
crazy or eccentric person." Apparently I
won the award by concluding that global
warming would produce "longer growing
seasons and more days at the beach." I
plead guilty; but since the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate Change which,
jointly with Al Gore, won the Nobel Peace
Prize docs predict longer growing seasons
and more warm weather, maybe the Panel
should be lumped with the kooks as well.
Alternatively Mr. Stinchcombe might

want to consider whether the I PCX' or the
other winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, A 1
Gore, is correct. Gore said last year"... we
are moving closer to several 'tipping
points' that could — within as little as ten
years — make it impossible for us to avoid
irretrievable damage to the planet's habit
ability for human civilization." He also
said "... if half of Greenland and half of
West Antarctica melted away, it would
have a devastating effect on rising sea lev
els. Parts of Florida would be covered in
water. New Orleans would be virtually
nonexistent and the future World Trade
Center memorial in New York would be
under water." On the other side, the I PCX'
in its latest report predicted that the sea
level in this century would rise by one foot.
According to an article in Science, in

Greenland and Antarctica there is both a
buildup of ice as well as some melting, the
net effect being that the sea level is rising
0.35 mm per year or in a hundred years by
about a foot, the same amount that the
oceans have risen over the last 150 years.
Virtually all of the scientists who have
looked at Antarctica and Greenland be
lieve that it would take many centuries be
fore "half of Greenland and half of west
Antarctica" could melt.
Unfortunately I don't qualify for the
honor of Kookdom. My book. "Climate of
112 ear." was based on the IPCC reports, sci
entific studies and economics,not on hyste
ria and "sky is falling" rhetoric. Although
he is not at Hoover, Al Gore might
qualify for the honor. As an aside. 1
might suggest that the schizophre
nia of the Nobel Committee, which
made the conflicting awards, is a
result of not including any scien
tists, with the possible exception of
an ophthalmologist.
