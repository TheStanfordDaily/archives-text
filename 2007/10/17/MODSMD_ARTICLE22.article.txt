# Football matters, finally
## 
### 
If you haven't figured it out for
yourself yet, let me he the first to
tell you. Unbelievable as it may
seem, somehow. Stanford football is
relevant again.
It used to be that you had to look
very closely, maybe even squint a bit.
if you hoped to see any sort of im
provement out of the Cardinal foot
ball program. But now? Now you'd
have to be blind not to recognize ex
actly what is happening.
Oh. true, the "whys" are still up in
the air. Is it the miraculous touch of
first-year coach Jim Harbaugh? Or is
it maybe that his players are just so
glad to finally have some hope for the
season that they're only now truly
beginning to play up to their abili
ties? Or maybe the rings of Saturn
have all aligned — really, the "why"
is interesting but not so important.
The only thing that really matters
is that the Cardinal, somehow, some
way. looks to have a legitimate
chance to win every game left on its
schedule.
That doesn't mean you should ex
pect an 8-4 record, but consider: Two
weeks ago. we wondered if Stanford
might be able to muster three, or
maybe even four wins on the season.
Now. it seems like everyone thinks
that bowl eligibility (i.e.six wins) is at
the very least a possibility.
The reasoning is pretty simple, ac
tually. When you can beat the Tro
jans, in their house, you've obviously
got some talent. When you follow it
up with an exciting game at home
against an undeniably athletic TCU
squad, it's pretty clear that things
have changed.
A glance ahead at Stanford's re
maining schedule reveals teams like
Arizona, Washington State and the
suddenly laughable Fighting Irish. Is
the Cardinal better than these
teams? Probably not, or at least not
all of them. But aside from the sea
son finale against Cal. there remains
no game in which Stanford figures
to be a significant underdog on
paper.
Sure, a win over the Horned
Frogs would have been quite a nice
sign of more good things to come.
But the important thing about the
game is that the Cardinal was exact
ly what we hoped it would be after
the win over USC. Fast and confi
dent. smart and scrappy. Stanford
was ultimately undone on Saturday
by missed tackles, untimely (and
sometimes questionable) penalties
and a defense that seemed to wear
down as the game went on.
Those are all problems that will
need to be corrected. But we should
n't be surprised that the Cardinal still
has its flaws. Remember that two
weeks ago flaws were about the only
thing anyone could find when they
thought of Stanford football.
You see. this is how teams turn
themselves around. Only when they
get really, truly, overwhelmingly
good do they cease to have some
holes. The first sign that things are
going well isn't that you stop finding
things that are wrong, but rather that
you start to notice things that are
right. And suddenly the Cardinal
seems to have gotten plenty of things
right.
From the cool quarterbacking of
sophomore Tavita Pritchard to the
improved play of the offensive line in
front of him, Stanford has found sta
bility on offense. Sophomore
Richard Sherman is an undeniable
deep threat, seniors Mark Bradford
and Hvan Moore provide some vet
eran stability and junior Anthony
Kimble just turned in his best colle
giate game at running back on Satur
day against the Frogs.
Defensively, too, playmakers
have emerged in 2(K)7. From the
pass-rushing talents of Clinton Sny
der and Pannel Fgboh to the pass de
fenders in the secondary who
wreaked havoc against USC. the unit
has a lot of big-play ability and a lot
of depth.
But more importantly, the team
has discovered an identity. A giant
leap from the rampant conservatism
of just a year ago under Walt Harris,
the Cardinal is now playing with a
take-no-prisoners, devil-may-care

Griffin
Rants and Raves
abandon on the field. This new de
meanor suggests a team that has re
alized that it has nothing to lose —
no one expects Stanford to win. so
why worry about losing?
It's that kind of attitude that
keeps games interesting down to the
wire. It's that kind of mental tough
ness that can lead to conversions on
fourth-and-twenty and scores on
fourth-and-goal from the ten.
It's that kind of attitude that
might just bring football back to
prominence on the Farm.

Denis Griffin is a senior who just
might get to see his team play in a
howl for the first time. Wish him luck
at djgriffepstanford. edit.
