### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After playing 54 holes against
some of the top teams in the nation,
the No. 8 Stanford men's golf team
finished just eight strokes shy of en
joying its second consecutive Pres
tige at the PGA West Championship.
In the end. No. 1 Charlotte won the
tournament after posting a three
round. 10-under-par total of 854.
The Cardinal was the only other
team to hit the below-par mark, man
aging a two-under score of 862 to
seize second place honors in front of
Central Florida, in third with a five
over 869, and Pepperdine and Texas
Christian tied at fourth with a score
of 876,12 over par.
Leading the Cardinal to its third
top-five finish this season was sopho
more Jordan Cox who concluded the
tournament in a tie for eighth place.
Cox began the tournament at even
par on Monday after posting scores
of 71 and 73 strokes in the first and
second rounds, respectively. He
stepped up his game yesterday and
jumped seven places after collecting
five birdies on the day to earn a final
round two-under-par score of 70. Cox
earned his first collegiate top-ten fin
ish and his lowest-ever tournament
single-round score this weekend.
"The guys played solidly this
week, but we were hoping to defend
the title." coach Conrad Ray said. "I
think there were a lot of promising
events at the tournament, but the
conditions were tough. The way the
course was set up made it difficult,
but Jordan Cox was able to snag a
top-ten finish, which was great for
us."
Just behind Cox were sophomore
Joseph Bramlett and senior captain
Rob Grube. Bramlett fell two spots
after yesterday's final round to finish
in a tie for eleventh with a three
round even-par 216 for the tourna
ment. Bramlett's best round came in
the second when he notched a two
under score of 70. but he could not
hang onto his lead in the third round,
where he collected a two-over-par
score of 74.
Grube remained ranked in the
15th spot throughout the tourna
ment and shot his best score of 70 in

Sophomore Joseph Bramlett tied with senior team captain Rob Grube for 11th place, and Stanford finished
second at the Prestige at the PGA West. The Cardinal placed four individual golfers in the top 25 at the tournament.
Though Stanford was up against
seven other top-50 teams, including
top-ranked Charlotte, No. 22 Pep
perdine and No. 25 Wisconsin,
among others, the Cardinal was able
to clinch the second-place spot in the
tournament and has now jumped
seven spots in the national rankings
to No. S. After only its third tourna

ment of the fall season, the Cardinal
team seems to have its bearings as it
heads into the Isleworth Collegiate
Invitational in Florida next week.
"We are looking forward to head
ing off to Florida," Ray said. "This
will be one of our toughest events in
terms of the field; many solid teams
will be attending.The Prestige was a
good test of our abilities, but we will
have to be on top of our game to play
well in Florida this weekend."
