ford men's soccer knew it
had some readjusting to do.
Ilie offensive gap desperately
needed filling if the Card was
to survive the Pacific-10
Conference.

Survive it has, though not
always with the underdog

glitz seen in its 2006 matchups
with UCLA, Washington and

Cal. But Stanford's 4-3-5 record
(1-1-2 Pac-10) can largely be at
tributed to the contributions of a
newcomer filling Morgan's large

cleats.
Freshman Bobby Warshaw

leads the team in points, tallying 10

through a combination of four goals and two assists
in his 12 appearances. He has launched 34 shots, in-

cluding six of the team's 10 shots against UCLA, and
has pressured defenses around the country. Even his

misses seem a cut above, like the bicycle kick that floated
just high of the Bruins' crossbar on Friday. Flowever, the
clear indications of his offensive prowess do little to en
thuse Warshaw.

"As far as the
stats, I don't really
care." Warshaw said.
"That just means
that I had [six]
chances to score and
win the game for us.
My motivation
|comes from] win
ning games; that's

what it comes down to. One coach said it's (both] my best
and worst [quality]: I just want to win games. Whether I'm

the guy scoring or the guy sitting on
the bench when we score, I just want
to do what I can."
Coach Bret Simon is not at all
surprised by Warshaw's modest
commentary on his own play. Simon,
though, was more forthcoming in ad
dressing Warshaw's individual game
and his position in the team's frame
work.
"Bobby is a very, very competi
tive person." Simon noted. "He's
very confident, and he's not shy
about jumping right in with the
team, (which is whyj he was able to
play right away as a freshman on a
competitive team. Beyond that,
Bobby has great vision. He reads the
game very well, and he's worked to
perfect his skills, so that allows him
to place the ball in more situations
than the average player typically
can. I le's a very special player."
Simon saw Warshaw's potential
during the forward's time with the
U-17 and U-18 National Teams, as
well as with FC Delco, one of the
country's top club programs based
near Warshaw's home in Pennsylva
nia.
Simon and the Cardinal recruited
Warshaw. but Bobby was especially
swayed by Stanford's combination
of athletics and academics.
"He has two older brothers, one
of whom is at Stanford as a graduate
student, so he came out and visited."
Simon recalled. "He played for one
of the top clubs in the country ... so
he's a very talented player and we
knew a lot about him. Luckily, he
knew a little about us. and had some
interest in [playing on] the West
Coast."
Warshaw's account of how he
ended up on the Farm begins a little
earlier in his soccer career.
" l"he story 1 tell people is that
when they were in the Final Four (in
2001], I remember watching the
game on TV and thinking. 'Wow,

those guys are so cool â€” they're
smart and they're great soccer play
ers.' " Warshaw said. "That first set
my interest on Stanford ... and be
tween the location, the academics
and the soccer program, it was a no
brainer."
As for his experiences with the
National Team, Warshaw acknowl
edges that "playing at that level and
in that atmosphere with those play
ers would help anyone." But, lie
prefers the camaraderie of the Stan
ford program.
"The atmosphere here is better
than with the National Team," he
said. "The National Team is a little
more individual. Here everyone
wants the team to win. Whether
you're playing one minute or 90 min
utes, everyone really does want
what's best for the team.
"The older guys help the younger
guys, the younger guys push them
selves to be like the older guys. While
the atmosphere here is just as com
petitive, it's a little more directed to
wards the team doing well."
Warshaw only wishes he could do
more.
"I think all the guys, [myself in
cluded,] take it personally and wish
that they could be doing better in
[close game] situations," he said."lt's
weird coming from a high school en
vironment [and] going to playing
UCLA in a double-overtime game.
You look around and [realize] this is
a national scene, a national showcase
of the team, and it's worth a lot more
than what you're used to."
Coach Simon doesn't doubt that
Warshaw will soon be used to this
stage and will play at an even higher
level in the future.
"We just take [each] day as a
chance to get better," Simon said.
"For Warshaw, that means rounding
out parts of his game. He's very gift
ed in certain areas, but he needs to
round out other areas. So he's work
ing hard at that. He really wants to
get better, so I definitely expect he'll
keep growing as a player."
