Edwards named starter
in Buffalo
Things just keep getting better for
former Stanford quarterback Trent
Edwards.
Despite the fact that former starter for
the Buffalo Bills, J.P. Losman. is now
healthy, Edwards was named the
team's starter for Sunday's match-up
against the Baltimore Ravens.
The rookie is 1-1 after his first two
NFL starts. Edwards got his first start
over two weeks ago against the New
York Jets, replacing the injured Los
man and leading the Bills to their first
win of the season, 17-14. A week later,
he nearly led his team past the 5-1 Dal
las Cowboys on Monday night; the
Cowboys needed an onside-kick re
covery and a last second field goal to
pull out the 25-24 win.
'it's the right call for us for now," a
team source told ESPN.com. "He's
[demonstrated] a lot of poise. We'll
just see how it goes from here on out."
Edwards, a native of Los Gatos, has
completed 55 of 79 passes for 507
yards, with one touchdown and three
interceptions in his first two games.
I"he former Cardinal quarterback was
the 92nd pick of the 2007 NFL Draft.
Stanford awarded with Pontiac Game
Changing Performance
More than a week after the Cardi
nal football team pulled off what has
been called the greatest upset ever, the
team received yet another honor for
its performance. It was announced
yesterday that the game-winning
touchdown pass from sophomore
Tavita Pritchard to senior Mark Brad-

ford was chosen by online voters as the
Pontiac Game Changing Performance
of the Week.
The touchdown, which tied the
score at 23 and allowed senior kicker
Derek Belch's PAT to win the game,
beat out three other nominees in a
public poll through the company's
website pontiac.com/ncaa. The award
comes with a $S.(MX) donation to the
university's general scholarship fund,
and the Cardinal is now eligible for the
end-of-season Game Changing Per
formance of the Year, which is worth
SI 00,000.
Dray's season over early

been the Cardinal's starting tight end
this season, will miss the rest of the
year with a knee injury sustained in
Stanford's loss to Texas Christian on
Saturday. Coach Jim Harbaugh an
nounced yesterday that Dray tore the
ACL in his left knee.
"I'm extremely disappointed,"
Dray said in a press release."lt's an un
fortunate situation, but I chose to play
football and 1 know the risks. It hap
pened. and now 1 will work harder to
come back and be stronger."
As a redshirt freshman last year.

19 receptions and started 11 of Stan
ford's 12 games at tight end. I le scored
