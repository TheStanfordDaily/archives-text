# STUDENT LIFE
## SHPRC offers pregnancy tests 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The difference between one line
and two lines can mean a great deal
in the life of a young woman. A home
pregnancy test can be an important
item in the sexual health arsenal of
college students, and starting on
Monday the tests will become avail

able at the Sexual 1 lealth Peer Re
source Center (SHPRC) located on
the second floor of Vaden I lealth
Center.
The addition of the pregnancy
test to the cornucopia of condoms,lu
bricants and other sexual health
goodies already available at the
SI I PRC was an obvious next step for
co-director Anjali Dixit '09.

"I don't know why it wasn't
offered before," she said. "A
lot of students were coming in
asking if we carried pregnancy

tests and we would have to

say no."
Starting next week, the

answer will he yes. Although Vaden
already offers a lab-based pregnancy
test. Dixit sees many advantages to
the more confidential and informal
home pregnancy test option.
Many students may prefer to deal
with a peer as opposed to a nurse or
physician, she said. Additionally, pri
vacy remains a primary concern.
Some students are worried about
having the test show up on a Vaden
insurance record and ultimately
being seen by parents. The SHPRC
does not ask for name or class year,
but it does check a confidential
record of student ID numbers to en
sure that a student has paid her spe
cial fees.
The new First Response brand
tests are the same product carried by
major drugstores and supermarkets.
Additionally, the tests will be offered
at a subsidized price â€”$4 at the
Center as compared to $6 or $7 at
Longs Drugs. These tests, which can
be used up to five days before an ex
pected period or two weeks after in
tercourse. produce reasonably reli
able results within minutes.
Having purchased the tests, stu
dents will be allowed to do what they
wish with them, but will be encour
aged to take the test at Vaden and
then consult with the peer counselor
on duty after obtaining results.
"If it's negative, we would want to
talk to them about safer sex," ex
plained SHPRC counselor Bianca
Carpeneti '10. "If it's positive we can
offer them other resources depend
ing on what they would want to do."
Carpeneti told The Daily that the
Center is especially helpful if stu
dents are apprehensive about seek
ing help from health care profession
als.
"We're a resource center where
students can go to talk to their peers,"
she said. "If they need a pregnancy
test or counseling, we're a good first
step for people who are nervous or
scared or worried."
Students were happy to hear of
the new addition to the SHPRC's list
of sexual health products, but some
were wary of the counseling option.
"I think it's great that they're of
fering pregnancy tests," said Kim
Thai' 11 ."But it would be sort of awk
ward talking to a counselor after tak
ing the test. It's a very personal mat
ter."
