GAME NOTES: Richard Wire won the singles title and the team of
Blake Muller and Ted Kelly beat their own teammates to win
doubles at the ITA Regional Championship. They will play in
the ITA Nationals in three weeks, but only after a tournament at
Cal, which could very likely include rematches of the doubles
semifinals from this week.
