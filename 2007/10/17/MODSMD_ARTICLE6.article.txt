## Sex survey explores college romantic trends 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Everybody knows there's no dating
at Stanford.
"People either act like they're mar
ried or they hook up," said Navin kad
aba 'OS. "There's no in-between."
ITie story usually goes something
like this: harried undergrads are too
busy with school to go on formal dinner
or movie dates, so they either have ca
sual one-night stands as time allows, or
they quickly move into joined-at-the
hip relationships, where they sleep, eat
and study together.
While the lack of dating at Stanford
may be lamentable, recent research
from Sociology Prof. Paula England,
who teaches the popular class "Sex and
Love in Modern Society." suggests it's
hardly unique. England has given an

extensive online sex survey to over
4,300 students at seven universities, and
she reports that formal dating has fall
en by the wayside everywhere.
"At every other school where 1 go to
give a talk, the students say, 'There's
something really weird here. People
don't date.'" she said. "And then they
have some idiosyncratic explanation
about their college. ITiis guy at North
western thought it was because histori
cally the male and female dorms were
on opposite sides of the campus. Trust
me on this: that is not the explanation."
Lack of dating is a national trend.
England explained. All over the coun
try, the formal date is being pushed out
by the new college hookup.
" 1 looking up" is loosely defined, but
it generally refers to a situation where
two people wind up doing something
sexual after meeting up at a party or
other social event.
The particular sexual activity can
be anything from kissing to inter
course. Of the 2,900 heterosexual stu
dents who shared information about
their last hookup, about a third had
simply made out, another third had
had intercourse and the remaining
third had had either oral or manual
sex.
The participants did not necessar
ily know each other before the
hookups, nor did they necessarily
have any interest in a relationship.
Sometimes, however, hookups do
lead to relationships if a couple hits it
off.
By senior year, the students in
England's survey had averaged 6.9

hookups. In addition. 71 percent of
seniors reported having been in a re
lationship that lasted at least six
months.
"Hookups have not replaced rela
tionships," England said. "But they
have altered the pathways into rela
tionships and may have largely re
placed casual dating."
While Stanford may not be unique
in terms of its lackluster dating scene,
students at the Farm can boast about
leading the pack in one arena.
"Stanford students are more vir
ginal than students at other schools,"
England said.
More than 30 percent of Stanford up
perclassmen self-identify as virgins,
compared to about 15 percent of up
perciassmen at the other six schools
in the online survey.
One group driving the Stanford
virginity gap is Asian men. A full 50
percent of male Asian upperclass
men at Stanford self-identify as vir
gins, compared to 27 percent of male
non-Asian upperclassmen. Interest

ingly, there is no statistically signifi
cant difference in the self-reported
virginity of Asian versus non-Asian
females.
However, the high level of chastity
at Stanford cannot be attributed to
Asian males alone. Non-Asian upper
classmen at Stanford report being vir
gins twice as often as non-Asian up
perclassmen at other universities.
England speculates the virginity
gap may be due to the type of people
who wind up at Stanford. Research
with high school students has shown
that having highly educated parents,
high socioeconomic status and a high
GPA all predict that an individual will
delay losing his or her virginity.
Still, any late bloomers can be re
assured.
"Stanford kids are probably ulti
mately going to do the same stuff,"
England said, "it's just that they're
starting later."
