## Male feminists plan antirape ribbon campaign 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
The White Ribbon Campaign might
not sound very manly, but that's just
the image campus feminist group Men
Against Violence (MAV) is hoping to
combat as it gears up for its first cam
pus-wide event next month.
The creation of MAV last spring
came at a pivotal point in campus his
tory. According to the 2(X)7 Stanford
Safety and Security Report, compiled
by the Department of Public Safety,
the number of reported rapes on cam
pus jumped from zero in 2005 to nine in
2(XKv
However, MAV president Jesse

Wallin 'OS and others agree that this
statistic does not reflect an actual in
crease in the number of rapes, hut an
increase in groups that raise aware
ness.
"That higher number is because
more outreach groups like MAV are
starting to get out there so survivors
know where they can go." Wallin said.
"As students become aware of those re
sources, those numbers will unfortu
nately increase because they will begin
to better reflect the nature of the prob
lem.
"It's not likelv that sexual assault it
self is increasing on campus, but that
understanding and awareness are be
coming more accurate." he contin
ued. adding that rape is the most sta
tistically underreported violent
crime.
Continuing this trend toward
more frequent reporting of rape is
one of the reasons that Wallin and
the rest of MAV. which consists of a
core group of six to eight male stu
dents. will hold the White Ribbon
Campaign next month.
The campaign was established in
1991 in response to the Ecole Poly
technique massacre in Canada on
Dec. to. 1989, when an anti-feminist
gunman killed 14 women. During
the campaign, which traditionally
starts in late November and lasts
until Dec. 6. wearing a white ribbon
signifies opposition to violence
against women.
I lowever. because Dec. to falls in
the middle of Dead Week at Stan
ford. MAV decided to hold the
event earlier in November.The stu
dents plan to hand out the ribbons in
White Plaza and hope to distribute
at least 2.000 ribbons to men in the

community.
"Some will grab them and walk
on. but some will stop and talk to you
about it,"he said. "This is a great way
to raise awareness about the issue,
because often men are not aware that
it exists or concerns them."
Wallin added that women are cer
tainly welcome to stop and take rib
bons as well.
"Women are absolutely our al
lies in this campaign," he said."Plus,
a woman may take a ribbon and
give it to her friend or boyfriend,
which is another great way that we
can reach men, as most men won't
get involved until they see that vio
lence against women affects them in
some way."
MAV was founded last year by
Wallin, a transfer student from the
University of Michigan, where he
was involved in a similar organiza
tion. According to Jessa Edra '09, a
student intern at the Center for Rela
tionship Abuse Awareness in Palo
Alto. Wallin was "shocked" to find no
such group at Stanford.
The group is "dedicated to the ed
ucation of men on campus about how
male socialization affects men's
health and behavior, with a particular
focus on issues of sexual assault and
relationship abuse," according to its
mission statement.
The all-male focus of MAV could

draw criticism from groups who feel
this takes the emphasis of the move
ment away from women's empower
ment. Wallin acknowledged. He
claimed, however, to have encoun
tered nothing but support in the
group's dealings with more tradition
al feminist groups on campus.
"While the majority of men don't
commit acts of sexual assault or rela
tionship abuse, most acts of sexual as
sault and relationship abuse are per
petrated by men," he said. "This un
fortunate reality necessitates that
men must become involved in the
movement to end violence against
women as our gender is primarily re
sponsible for it even if we as individ
ual men are not."
Wallin backed up this assertion
with the statistic that, according to
most studies, the vast majority of
rapists are men. between 97 and 99.8
percent.
That's why. he said, it is so impor
tant for men to be involved in the
issue of violence against women,
which MAV's White Ribbon Cam
paign will highlight.
"It's not just a ribbon," he said,
"lt'sa pledge not to commit,condone
or remain silent about violence
against women."
