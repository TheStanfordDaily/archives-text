## Ending spam, for good Grad student sues spammers, donates profits to charity 
### MARISSA MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Joe Wagner has found a new
way to put an end to world hunger:
by taking illegal spammers to court.
He's garnered over $40.(XX), in
settlements and court-awarded dam
ages, for charities like Second Har-

vest and the Darfur Stove Project from

merchants who hired spammers to advertise
for them.
Wagner, a Ph.D. candidate in the Depart
ment of Mechanical Engineering, has had his
email address online since the earliest days of
the Web. His webpage, a forum on developing
technologies, was one of the very first. And what
does this Internet pioneer have to show for it?
A place on every spammer's list, an inbox
overwhelmed with junk mail, and now: the mo
tivation to fight back.
"Spam is more than an annoyance," insists
Wagner. "It is the systematic destruction of a
medium and community, the interplay of ideas.
It's worse than disruptive; it's destructive."
Early this year. Wagner found his Stanford
account flooded with more than 2,0(X) emails,
all of which appeared to be from the same
spammer. When he subpoenaed Stanford's IT
department, he discovered that hundreds of
thousands of similar emails had been sent to
the Stanford community.That's when he enlist
ed the help of fellow grad student David Can
non, and the two decided to try the case in
small claims court.
There was only one problem: small claims
courts — courts that settle only minor disputes
— [equire that defendants be served within
California. Most of the offending spammers
were based out-of-state. A little detective
work, however, revealed that all the companies
planned to attend AdTech, an advertising con
ference held annually in San Francisco.
"So we just went around and we served
them papers," said Wagner. "Getting on to the
exhibit floor is free. We didn't make a big deal,
because the whole point was just to hand them
the packet of papers. We weren't there to make
a scene."
This summer. Wagner and Cannon present
ed their case in Palo Alto Small Claims Court.
Before the trial, though they offered to dismiss
the charges, on the condition that the defen

dants would do-

nate the money at issue to charity.
All but four — Valueclick, WorldAv-

enue, SubscriberßASE, and Azoogle —
agreed.
"Many times what happens is merchants
can't admit to themselves — much less to
someone else — that what they're doing is
wrong." explains Wagner. "Once you have to
write a check, though, you stop and examine
what you're doing. ITiis way. the message still
gets there; you're stopping spam and helping
charity. It's pretty much a win-win situation."
Wagner encourages spammers to donate to
the Darfur Stove Project as well as local food
banks. The Stove Project works to provide
refugee camps with more efficient stoves. Fire
wood is scarce near these areas, so Darfurians
must venture far beyond the safety of the
camps to find fuel.
"It's a very worthy goal, where a small
amount of seed money can make a huge differ
ence," said Wagner.
Ultimately, the small claims court judge
ruled that the four spammers would have to
pay maximum damages. The defendants de
manded that their case be retried, a right guar
anteed by California small claims procedure.
This time, they had a team of lawyers on hand.
The appeal was held last Thursday at San
Jose Superior Court, but the judge's decision
may take up to three weeks. Even as he waits
for the verdict. Wagner is developing a website
— spamwall.stanford.edu — to help Stanford
students organize against spam.
"If Stanford students and faculty start
suing, the word will get out." said Wagner.
"Don't screw with Stanford."
So what lies ahead for the Robin Mood of
the Internet era?
"Well," laughs Wagner, "My immediate
goal is to finish my dissertation."
