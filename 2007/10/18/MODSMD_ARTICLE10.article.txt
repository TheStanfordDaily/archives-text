ISTANBUL, TUrkey (AP) — Parliament
authorized the government Wednesday to
send troops into northern Iraq to root out
Kurdish rebels who've been conducting raids
into T\irkey. The vote removed the last legal
obstacle to an offensive, but there was no sign

of imminent action as the United States urged
restraint.
TUrkish leaders, under pressure from Wash
ington and Baghdad, have signaled they would
not immediately give the order to send in
60,()0() soldiers, armor and attack helicopters
into a region that has largely escaped the chaos
of the Iraq war.
The crisis along the border, where the Turk
ish troops have massed since summer, has
caused tensions between TUrkey and the Unit
ed States.
President Bush said the U.S. was making clear
to TUrkey that it should not stage a major army
operation in the Iraqi north, much of which has
escaped the sustained violence and political dis
cord common in the rest of Iraq since the U.S-led
invasion in 2003.
Bush said Turkey has had troops stationed
in northern Iraq "for quite a while," a reference
to about 1,500 soldiers deployed for years to
monitor the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party, or
PKK, with the permission of Iraqi Kurd au
thorities.
"We don't think it's in their interest to send
more troops in," he said.
While they now have the authority to strike
at PKK bases used to stage attacks in TUrkey,
the country's leaders appear to be holding back
in hopes the threat of an incursion will prod
Iraq and the US. to move against the guerrillas.
The TUrkish military, which had little suc
cess when it last carried out a major incursion
into Iraq a decade ago with 50,000 soldiers, es
timates 3,800 TUrkish Kurd guerrillas operate
from Iraq territory and 2,300 are inside TUrkey.
