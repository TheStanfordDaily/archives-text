# Apple opens iPhone to third-party applications
## 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) _ In an apparent
about-face, Apple Inc. will allow third-party
applications to work directly on the iPhone,
Chief Executive Steve Jobs said in a posting
on the company's Web site Wednesday.
Apple infuriated developers and some
iPhone users when it issued a software update
Sept. 27 that disabled unofficial programs in
stalled on the handsets.
Until Wednesday, Apple had tried to con
trol which applications consumers had on
their i Phones.
Now, Jobs said the company intends to re

lease a development kit in February that will
let coders create applications to work directly
on the iPhone and the iPod Touch. The Touch
is the new iPod portable player that resembles
the iPhone but lacks the function of a cell
phone.
It is easy to find many unofficial programs
for the iPhone on the Internet; users just had
to take the risk of installing them, knowing
that any damage to the iPhone stemming
from unofficial programs was not covered by
Apple's warranty.
"I'm thrilled," said Erica Sadun. a Denver
computer programmer."! hope it is exactly as
they say, full third-party development."
A Mac enthusiast and blogger - and a crit
ic of Apple's decision to restrict the iPhone to
carrier AT&T Inc. in the United States -
Sadun predicted Apple's change of heart will
ultimately help the company sell more iPods
and iPhones.
An unknown number of users have "un
locked" their handsets to work on other carri
er networks. The Sept. 27 software update re
portedly disabled those phones.
It was not clear from Jobs' statement
whether the move was a response to the grow
ing discontent around Apple's iron grip over
its portable gadgets.
