# Parents falsely claim religious exemptions to avoid vaccinating young children
##

BOSTON (AP) —Sabrina Rahim doesn't
practice any particular faith, but she had no
problem signing a letter declaring that because
of her deeply held religious beliefs, her 4-year
old son should be exempt from the vaccina
tions required to enter preschool.
She is among a small but growing number of
parents around the country' who are claiming
religious exemptions to avoid vaccinating their
children when the real reason may be skepti
cism of the shots or concern they can cause
other illnesses. Some of these parents say they
are being forced to lie because of the way the
vaccination laws are written in their states.
"It's misleading," Rahim admitted, but she
said she fears that earlier vaccinations may be
to blame for her son's autism. "I find it very
troubling, but for my son's safety, I feel this is

the only option we have."
An Associated Press examination of states'
vaccination records and data from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention found that
many states are seeing increases in the rate of
religious exemptions claimed for kindergart
ners.
"Do I think that religious exemptions have he
come the default? Absolutely," said Dr. Paul
Offit, head of infectious diseases at Children's
Hospital in Philadelphia and one of the harsh
est critics of the anti-vaccine movement. He
said the resistance to vaccines is "an irrational,
fear-based decision."
But public health officials say it takes only a
few people to cause an outbreak that can put
large numbers of lives at risk.
"When you choose not to get a vaccine,
you're not just making a choice for yourself,
you're making a choice for the person sitting
next to you," said Dr. Lance Rodewald, direc
tor of the CDC's Immunization Services Divi
sion.
All states have some requirement that
youngsters be immunized against such child
hood diseases as measles, mumps, chickenpox.
diphtheria and whooping cough.
Twenty-eight states, including Florida.
Massachusetts and New York, allow parents to
opt out for medical or religious reasons only.
Ttoenty other states, among them California,
Pennsylvania, Texas and Ohio, also allow par
ents to cite personal or philosophical reasons.
Mississippi and West Virginia allow exemp
tions for medical reasons only.
From 2003 to 2007, religious exemptions for
kindergartners increased, in some cases dou
bled or tripled, in 20 of the 28 states that allow
only medical or religious exemptions, the AP
found. Religious exemptions decreased in
three of these states - Nebraska, Wyoming,
South Carolina - and were unchanged in fivt'
others.
In Massachusetts, the rate of those seeking
exemptions has more than doubled in the past
decade - from 0.24 percent, or 210, in 1996 to
0.60 percent, or 474, in 2006.
Unvaccinated children can spread diseases
to others who have not gotten their shots or
those for whom vaccinations provided less
than-complete protection.
In 1991, a religious group in Philadelphia
that chose not to immunize its children
touched off an outbreak of measles that
claimed at least eight lives and sickened moi£
than 700 people, mostly children.
