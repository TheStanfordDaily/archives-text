### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) approved $8,000 dollars of
funding — the maximum amount of
money the body gives to any graduate
student organization — to the Korean
Student Association at Stanford
(KSAS) last night. With the allocated
funds, KSAS plans to showcase sever
al events throughout the year.
Next Friday, Oct. 1 ( >. the organization
will host a party for first-year graduate
students at the Graduate Community
Center. The event will start at 6 p.m.
According to Polina Segalova, a
mechanical engineering graduate stu
dent and funding committee chair of
the GSC, KSAS is one of the largest
student groups on campus. The deci
sion to allocate the maximum amount
of money to the group was partly
based on the number of its student
members, she said.
Sechan Oh, a third-year doctoral
candidate and financial officer of the
KSAS, said there are currently around
350 active members in the group.
KSAS will sponsor several other
activities throughout the academic
year, including the Korean Thanksgiv
ing and Lunar New Year parties, the
Stanford-Berkeley Tennis Match, the
Presidential Election and Farewell
party for graduating students.
