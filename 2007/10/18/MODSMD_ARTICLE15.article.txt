## Editorial Board Change in China

hina will never have a Western-
I style democracy." touts Li
the spokesman for
the 17th Congress of the Communist Party.
Considering that the congress meets only
once every five years. Dongsheng's vow car
ries heavy and long-term implications. Does
this statement imply continued human
rights abuses for Chinese workers? Or that
freedom of speech will continue to he sup
pressed? In our pluralistic society, we learn
to respect others' opinions and practices,
often with the stipulation that these differ
ences shouldn't inflict great harm on others.
Likewise, the citizens of every country
should be able to choose their own path of
governance. Swedes may want to run their
country differently from the Japanese, and
as long as neither country's citizens want to
command and conquer the other, both na
tions are willing to recognize mutual sover
eignty. We should thus recognize and re
spect the decisions made by the citizens of
China.
However, while respecting the decisions
of other countries is prudent, it is important
to distinguish between decisions made by a
select few in power and decisions made by
the populace at large. The former should be
recognized on a case by case basis, while the
latter should be taken to heart. This prefer
ential treatment implies a sponsorship of
democracies, which surfaces as a problem in
regard to China. Will China at least become
a more conservative type of democracy?
The answer seems to be yes. In support
of political reform. Li Dongsheng has said
that China would further nurture a form of
"socialist democracy.' It is unlikely that he

is referring to the European model of so
cial democracy, where higher taxes are
traded for more comprehensive public pro
grams like universal health care and gener
ous social security. He is hopefully refer
ring to voting rights, free and fair elections
and real legislative power for elected offi
cials. These changes would be highly covet
ed in a country whose highest officials are
chosen by means of patronage and long
lasting friendships between party elders
and prodigies.
We are, however, somewhat cautious in
predicting that China will become even a
minimally defined democracy. While the no
tion of "social democracy" is upheld, the no
tion of a true multi-party political system is
not. ITiis resistance is, of course, not alto
gether surprising. Those in control rarely
just surrender their monopoly on power. In
its pursuit of "socialist democracy," the
Communist Party of China is instead woo
ing would-be dissidents into its grasp. Case
in point: the inclusion of a non-Communist
Party organization into the deliberative
process and the suggestion that the newly
rich class of Chinese businessmen be incor
porated into the party network.
On the bright side, the party's efforts to
maintain control over the country may
prove unable to stop the wave of democrati
zation. As the economy charges full speed
ahead, more and more Chinese citizens are
enjoying life in a way that their predecessors
could have only imagined. Priorities are
shifting, and a new Chinese bourgeoisie may
force more democratic change than the
party would like to implement. That is why
some reform is better than none at all.
