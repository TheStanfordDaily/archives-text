## The 						coolness that is Japan 
### 
Last week. 1 wrote an article encourag
ing travel to Thailand. However, there
is a country 1 hold much closer to my
heart: Japan! Let me qualify this — Thai
land is a great place if you are traveling
alone, but Japan is the place to go if you can
bring a good buddy.
Why am I so obsessed with travel? As
someone who has traveled extensively, I
am a big proponent of traveling abroad.
More than that. I want to make sure you
have a good time doing it in a country you
enjoy. And so I will devote this week to
sharing some memories and thoughts that
will hopefully encourage you all to experi
ence the coolness that is Japan.
Japan operates on a logic completely
different from anything else you've ever
experienced — and delightfully so.This is a
nation whose quirky tastes are neatly pack
aged and distributed by advanced technol
ogy, vending machines, and friendly-look -
ing depictions of cute animals. You'll be
pleased to know that real-life Japan and
Japanese people arc surprisingly well-char
acterized by their anime — I thought I was
in an anime when I heard them say
"Sugoi!" (Amazing!). For the real anime
lovers, or if your hotel burns to the ground
and everywhere else is booked (as I experi
enced), sleep for $12 in an anime cafe in
your own private cushioned booth with a
computer, internet and a whole lot of
anime.
With whatever time you have, try to
spend a good week in Tokyo. If Tokyo is all
you see. more power to you. The city packs
in Japan's greatest cultural punch, and its
amazing transportation will serve it to you
like fish on a sushi boat. Iliere is also uni
versal consensus that Japan has one of the
most attractive populace in the world, in
that the average person tends be good
looking. Tokyo is where this is most appar
ent, especially in the district of Shibuya.
Dress-code for ladies in Shibuya goes as
following: Japanese girls wear during the
day what American girls wear at night, and
at night Japanese girls wear what American
girls sleep in.
I need to devote a whole paragraph to
the black references in Japan. Now I want
to make clear that the Japanese aren't nec
essarily being insulting or racist in their ref
erences to black people; it's more that they
are unaware of the political connotations,
which one can really only pick up by living
in the United States. That being said, when
I found out that my black friend was in
Tokyo, coincidentally filming a documen
tary about being black in Japan, we
promptly agreed that capturing the follow

ing finds were essential to his production:
1) The Sounds of Blackness: a pretty
legit record shop
2) Harlem: the dance studio self-de
scribed as "Hie Sanctuary of Black Music"
3) Black Nikka: a whiskey
4) Blacky: hyper tanning studio of Japan
(my personal favorite)
My travel buddy and 1 also made sure to
buy ourselves a pair of "Black Man" under
wear. which are super-scandalous, super
tight briefs with a "crotch pocket" for your
stuff. The packaging shows a close-up of a
non-black male's crotch in the underwear,
with the words "BLACK MAN" promi
nently displayed above.
And then there's Club Ageha, Asia's
largest dance club. Hie whole experience
feels like being in a movie. You drop off at
Shin-kiba. this subway stop in the middle
of factories and docks. You walk for 20 min
utes into ever increasing darkness and
anonymity.Then you come across this giant
warehouse — and realize it's your destina
tion. You enter, and in slow motion you
soak everything in: enormous dance floor,
thousands of people, and a stunningly gor
geous clientele. You'll be committed to
dance until sam when the subways open
back up.
I admit that Japan is not all rose-colored
tuna sashimi and smiling Picachus. As a for
eigner. you will probably experience the
country's reputation for xenophobia. You
may walk into a nearly-empty restaurant or
bar. only to be stopped with a gesture re
sembling either an X or a crucifix, and told
that the establishment is "full." For women
living in the country, the glass ceiling in
Japan is so low there's barely room to stand
up.
However, the setbacks in Japan only
leave you disgruntled momentarily, and
you are right back enjoying the wonder
ment of it all. So if any of you have recent
ly broken up with a boyfriend or girlfriend,
leaving you discontented and wondering
what true love is really like, then spend a
week in Japan and find out.
