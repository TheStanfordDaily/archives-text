## Constitutional reform in California: the citizens' assembly proposal 
### 
What's the difference between the
California Constitution and the
script for a low-budget action
movie? They're both well-intentioned but
terribly written, they both explain what a
bunch of B-list celebrities are going to do,
and they both involve Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger— but the California Constitution isn't
low-budget, and it's about inaction, not ac
tion.
As a result of its constitution. California
has the most securely gerrymandered elec
toral districts of all the 50 states. Between
both the state senate and the state assembly
in the 2(X)6 election, the number of Democ
ratic seats and the number of Republican
seats changed by a grand total of zero. That's
a feat no other state's legislators were able to
accomplish for themselves — but a feat Cal
ifornia also accomplished two years ago. It is
tough to describe this as representative gov
ernment.
Another problem: the two-thirds budget
rule. Right now. if a budget doesn't pass, both
parties say it's the other party's fault.There is
no accountability because both the majority
and the minority can block a budget — it's
like if we'd elected both Bush AND Kerry
and said the government would do anything
they both agree on. Instead of promoting
moderate, consensus budgets, what ends up
happening is Republicans hold out for ear
marks for their districts and Democrats basi
cally bribe them into voting for a budget they
don't believe in by larding it up with favors
for special interests. So you get the worst of
both worlds.
So, why not get rid of the two-thirds budg
et rule? The voters would never accept that,
because it would put the legislative Democ
rats in charge of passing the budget.The vot
ers know they can't throw the Democrats
out of office — safe districts, remember? —
so they don't trust them to pass the budget.
With the budget process log-jammed, in
terest groups take their proposals to the bal
lot box. Instead of electing people and put

ting them in charge, ballot initiatives try to go
around the elected officials — putting an
array of commissioners and independent
boards in charge of the projects they set up.
Statewide elected officials end up serving on
or appointing people to over a hundred
boards and commissions each. This means
that when something goes wrong, the buck
goes not to an elected official but to a un
elected group of anonymous commissioners.
Despite being bombarded by negative ads
about a mind-boggling number of ballot ini
tiatives, again the result is less accountability,
not more.
Finally, term limits mean that, instead of
throwing out people who represent their
constituents poorly, everyone with any expe
rience is thrown out.The voters are unlikely
to get rid of that proposal because it is the
only way they can get rid of a representative.
But it means that legislators have little expe
rience and are always raising money to run
for something else — both of which give
well-heeled and experienced lobbyists the
upper hand in the legislative process.
Depending on your political perspective,
you're likely to find different parts of this
problematic. As a Democrat, I'm more con
cerned about how hard it is to fund innova
tive new programs to strengthen our com
munities — our per-pupil education spend
ing is low. we're not building public trans
portation to relieve traffic congestion or in
novating housing to reduce the cost of liv
ing. we haven't experimented with cost-sav
ing public devices to reduce the healthcare
burdens on business and private citizens,
and we're not investing in universities or

preschools that will build a 21st century
workforce. Republicans might point to a
host of different problems — for example, a
baffling array of unaccountable regulatory
authorities that make California a tough
place to do business, or ballot-box borrow
ing for highways and stem cell research that
should come out of the ordinary budget. But
one thing we can all agree on is that the sys
tem isn't working.
Proposals for reform have repeatedly
foundered. Legislators have rejected efforts
to make themselves accountable, and citizens,
frustrated with an unaccountable and ineffec
tive government, have rejected anything that
would entrust the government with govern
ing. Efforts to reform the system from the in
side have always packaged good proposals
with bad ones. For example. Governor
Schwarzenegger's anti-gerrymandering bill
(otherwise one of the best proposals to date)
seemed written to pack lots of Democrats into
a few ultra-liberal urban districts, increasing
Republicans' voting power. Democratic pro
posals have similarly foundered because they
seemed to increase the financial power of
unions relative to private individuals in cam
paign finance, for example.
How can we find a neutral, consensus pro
posal that fixes the system without giving
anyone the upper hand? One proposal, ad
vanced by the New America Foundation and
Fair Vote California, and introduced as a bill
by former assembly representatives Keith
Richman (R) and Joe Canciamilla (D), is to
create a citizen's assembly to recommend a
single comprehensive reform package that
would then be put to the voters on the ballot.
The premise is simple: ask citizens, not politi
cians, to make elections more fair.
We've seen the results of politicians trying
to fix the system. Let's give the people a try.

posals have similarly foundered because they
seemed to increase the financial power of
unions relative to private individuals in cam
paign finance, for example.
How can we find a neutral, consensus pro
posal that fixes the system without giving
anyone the upper hand? One proposal, ad
vanced by the New America Foundation and
Fair Vote California, and introduced as a bill
by former assembly representatives Keith
Richman (R) and Joe Canciamilla (D), is to
create a citizen's assembly to recommend a
single comprehensive reform package that
would then be put to the voters on the ballot.
The premise is simple: ask citizens, not politi
cians, to make elections more fair.
We've seen the results of politicians trying
to fix the system. Let's give the people a try.
