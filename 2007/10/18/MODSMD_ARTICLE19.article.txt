## CARD PREPS FOR DESERT SWING No. 3 Stanford takes on Arizona schools 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After seeing its unbeaten streak
end last Friday, the No. 3 Stanford
women's volleyball team will be on
the road this week, looking to keep its
number of losses at one.The Cardinal
fell in five games to No. 5 Washington
at home last week, cutting short a 17-
match winning streak which was the
team's best start since 1994.
"[Losing] can affect us in a lot of
ways." head coach John Dunning said.
"In practice the last few days, we have
been working very hard. We know
that we didn't play as well as we could
have against Washington, so we want
to raise our performance. We have
been playing very well all season and
made it look easy, but most seasons
aren't like that. We know that we will
need to fight for what we want."
The Cardinal will take that fight on
the road to visit Arizona and Arizona
State, the only Pac-10 teams Stanford
has yet to face.
With five teams from the Pac-10
among the nation's top nine, the Cardi
nal sits in a tie with the I luskies for the
top spot in the nation's most competi
tive conference, with identical 17-1.6-1
records. The Wildcats and Sun Devils
are off to less successful starts, strug
gling against their elite competitors to
win five matches between them. Ari
zona is currently eighth in the Pac-10
standings, while ASU sits in sixth.
Despite their records, playing
these teams on the road will be no
easy feat.
"1 think that both Arizona and Ari
zona State are much better than they
were last year." Dunning said. "Ari
zona is very successful at home —
they are 6-2 at home. I think they are
very dangerous on their own court.
And they just lost two in a row. Iliey
did not play very well against Wash
ington and then lost their rivalry
match to ASU. so they are probably
not very happy about that.

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to rebound after
its first loss of the season last Friday against
Washington. Arizona and Arizona State are the
only Pac-10 teams the Cardinal has yet to face
this year. Stanford will face No 4 USC and
No. 7 UCLA next week in Los Angeles.

"Arizona State beat Oregon State
at home and played a really amazing
match with [No. 19] Oregon two
weeks ago. They lost 30-32 to Oregon
in the fourth, so they were very close
to beating them. And they are 8-2 at
home."
The Sun Devils swept Washington
State on the road and then won last
week's in-state rivalry match over the
Wildcats, also in straight games. Ari
zona is on a two-match skid, with its
most recent victory over winless
Washington State.
The top offensive producer for the
Sun Devils this season is freshman
Sarah Reaves, who has 314 kills on the
season and is hitting .261 overall. She
is also tied for second on the team in
digs behind senior libero Sydney
Donahue.
Donahue leads the team with 6.3
digs per game and recorded a season

high 45 in a preseason match against
Virgina. She is already the top digger
in ASU history and set an NCAA
record last season with 50 in a three
game match. Niece of Stanford asso
ciate head coach Denise Corlett,
Donahue is currently among the top
ten diggers in the nation.
Marina Mercer is the Sun I)evils'
setter, with 12.47 assists per game,
while newcomer Sara Todorovich is
the squad's top blocker.
"Sydney Donahue is the Pac-10
leader in digs and is having a great
season" Dunning said. "And they
have two outside hitters who lit it up
against Arizona. They have won
three in a row and four out of five,
and they are probably a better team
than their record of 11-9 shows."
Stanford swept ASU in both of
their meetings last year. Current
juniors Cynthia Barboza and
Foluke Akinradewo led the Cardi
nal offense in both those matches,
each tallying double-digit kills.
The Cardinal beat the Wildcats
twice in 2006 as well, winning in
three games at home and on the
road. Barboza had 19 kills in the
home sweep and Akinradewo hit
.850— 17 kills on 20 attempts with
no errors- in Tucson.
This season, Arizona is led by
Randy Goodenough with 266 kills
and Jacy Norton has a team-high
.336 hitting percentage. Paige
Weber is averaging 12.39 assists per
game while Dominique Lamb and
Alanna Resch lead the squad in
blocks and digs, respectively.
"Arizona is blocking a lot of
balls," Dunning said, "1 think they
will be a pretty significant presence
at the net. Dominique Lamb is
blocking as many balls as anybody
in the Pac-10."
Lamb is currently second in the
conference in blocks with an aver
age 1.59 per game.
Nearing the midpoint of the con
ference season, the Cardinal is tops
in the Pac-10 in assists and kills per
game and is barely behind Washing
ton in team hitting percentage. Se
nior Bryn Kehoe — who broke
Stanford's 20-year-old career setting
record in the loss to Washington —
is the top setter in the conference
with 14.19 per game, the nation's
second-best average. Akinradewo
has the third-highest hitting per
centage in the country and the best
in the Pac-10 at .468 on the season.
Iliis is the first of two back-to
back road trips for the Cardinal
who will visit No. 4 USC and No. 7
UCLA next week. Stanford swept
both of those teams at home earlier
this vear.
