# Anthro merger tension
## CASA,AnthSci professors forced into new quarters 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Nine months after the University decided to combine the
Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy Departments, some professors continue to voice concerns
about the administration's handling of the merger.
Faculty members complained of being cut out of the deci
sion-making process in January, and for some professors that
bitterness has only grown since the start of the school year.
Their more recent complaints include the bungled transfer of
the Anthropological Sciences Department (AnthSci) to Build
ings 40 and 50, with many faculty still lacking bookcases and
telephone lines.
"The administration has shown itself to be idiotic in the way
they've approached the whole thing," said AnthSci Prof. John
Rick, who was chair of the department until last year. Rick —
who has been at Stanford since 1978 — said his new office is
filled with "random" furniture and no phone line.
"It's one of the greatest disappointments that's ever hap
pened to me at Stanford," he said.
The faculty is also still struggling to understand the motiva
tion behind the merger of the two departments into a single An
thropology Department, which initially split in 1998 after more
than a decade of tensions between the social science-oriented
and humanities-oriented factions. Biological Sciences Prof.
Sharon Long, who was the dean of Humanities and Sciences at
the time of the merger, is on sabbatical and was unavailable for
comment.
In a Feb. 1 Daily article, however,
she argued that a combined depart
ment would "better benefit stu
dents." While the critics of the merg
er acknowledge that the move may
have potential advantages, the lack of
consultation continues to bother
them. The initial split in 1998 was put
to a vote among Anthropology facul
ty, but similar discussion did not hap
pen in January.
"It wasn't brought to us as an idea,
but as a fait accompli," said Prof.
James Fox, who was formerly a mem
ber of the AnthSci department and
has been at Stanford since 1974. "To

me, this administration is similar to
the administration in the nation. It's a
sort of corporate mentality that does
n't welcome participation in the
process."
Both Fox and Rick said they were
also unhappy with how Prof. James
Ferguson was chosen as the new
chair of the Anthropology Depart
ment.
"In the Humanities and Sciences,
the tradition in appointing chairs is to
consult all relevant faculty," Rick
said. "In this case, there were no fac
ulty consulted, and the chair was ap
pointed for five years, which is an un
usually long time."
While Ferguson said he was ini
tially skeptical of the merger, the new
chair said everyone needs to make
the best of the situation.
"The main advantage will be that
there won't be confusion," said Fer
guson, who was formerly a professor
in Cultural and Social Anthropology
(CASA). "For students, it is clearer:
there is a field of anthropology, a de
partment of anthropology and a
major of anthropology."
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Sailer said he was not in
volved in the decision but pointed to
a desire to move up in the National
Research Council's annual depart
mental rankings as a possible reason
for the merger.The former provost of
the University of Chicago, now in his
first year at Stanford, described the
rankings as "significant."
"If we are going to have a top
ranked anthropology department,"
he explained,"we can't have two sep
arate departments with particular
strengths."
Before the merger, Stanford was

not the only top-ranked university
with multiple anthropology depart
ments. Duke has the Biological An
thropology and Anatomy Depart
ment and the Cultural Anthropology
Department. Harvard has one An
thropology Department, but has
three clear sub-divisions for archae
ology. biological anthropology and
social anthropology. An early pro
posal to divide Stanford's new de
partment along similar lines did not
take hold.
Sailer said the merger worked out
well for his wife. Prof. Tanya
Luhrmann, who is an expert in social
and medical anthropology and
joined the faculty in the spring.
"We had made the decision [to
come] before we knew about this," he
said, "but it certainly improved her
possibilities at this place."
One department or two, the
strained relationship between the
AnthSci and CAS A factions that led
to the 1998 split are part of a larger
trend in anthropology, according to
Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako.
"The split was the local manifesta
tion of a long-standing tension that
has existed in the field of anthropolo
gy," she said.
Yanagisako recommended her in
troduction in "Unwrapping the Sa
cred Bundle" for more background
on the fault lines in anthropology.
"You can't have my copy,
though," she added.
The bookshelves for her new of
fice had not been delivered, and the
book was buried in a mountain of
moving boxes.
