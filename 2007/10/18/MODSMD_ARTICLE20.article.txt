# Grube leads the way for Stanford
## Senior captain hopes to win repeat national championship 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
As the only senior on the team, captain
Rob Grube is the go-to guy when it comes to
Stanford men's golf. In the past year alone.
Grube has notched two individual victories at
the ( ordeValle Classic and the U.S. Intercol
legiate tournaments, led his team to a NC AA
C hampionship while finishing third individu
ally and has compiled his third All-American
honor.
Grube will look to become just the second
four-time Ail-American in program history
after this season. With all of these accom
plishments and more under his belt, where
else can Grube go but pro?
"I am excited for this year," Grube said.
"Obviously, winning the national champi
onship (last year] was amazing and so much
fun. J would love to do it again. I am psyched
to turn pro but how I play this year will really
affect which opportunities come my way
after Stanford."
After collcge. one of the first things a
golfer must decide is where he wants to live
so that he can train to qualify for upcoming
professional tournaments. Grube claims that
sticking around the Farm will do him the most
good.

daily with Coach [Conrad Ray] and
the Cardinal golf program," Grube
said."We are building a new practice
facility and 1 pretty much have my
whole infrastructure already built
here. II I moved, it'd set me back
about a month right off the bat, plus
the weather here is perfect for golf."
Both Grube and Coach Ray
began their Stanford careers in the
2004-2005 season. Ray's influence
on Grube has helped him to grow
both on and off the course.
"1 was very lucky to come to Stan
ford with Coach [Ray] in the same
year," Grube reminisced. "We
learned about Stanford golf togeth
er. Last year was the culmination of
all of our hard work. We have our dis
agreements but we always agree that
we really want to win above all else;
this is part of what makes us so close.
"Starting out at Stanford ranked
in the 60s nationally and then win
ning the national title only two years
later is really gratifying. These past
years have been amazing and Coach
has given me everything I need to
succeed; that is all you can ask for
from a coach."
Under Grube and Ray's strong
leadership, the Cardinal will be de
fending its national title against a
field of tough competitors. In order
to prepare, the Cardinal not only has
received a new practice facility to be
finished in the spring of 2008, but has
also received a variety of new

golfers. Last year's golf team show
cased three seniors and two juniors
whereas this year, Grube is the sole
senior for the four new freshmen to
look up to.
"We are definitely a lot younger
and a lot less experienced which
showed in the first three tourna
ments." Grube said. "We wanted to
beat the top ranked Charlotte team
at the Prestige, but we settled for sec
ond. We are starting to figure out our
game but people just expect us to do
exactly what we did last year."
Last year, the Cardinal won the
NCAA Championship by twelve
strokes, won six of twelve tourna
ments while posting top ten finishes
for the other six and was coached by
the National Head Coach of the
Year.
"Winning six times is a lot."
Grube said. "It seems like last year,
we just stepped right back into it be
cause everyone was really experi
enced, except for Joe |Bramlett] but
he had played a lot of tournament
golf before and just saw how it was
done [and| followed the lead. Now,
we only have a few guys who have
played in the majority of the toui na
ments for us."
"For me, this year will be an expe
rience of figuring out how to be a
captain and how to help the guys ma
ture and maximize their potential."
he said.
"For them, this year will be about
figuring out what college golf is all
about, what team golf is all about
and what winning is all about."
