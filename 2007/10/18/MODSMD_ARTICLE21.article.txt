## Card to compete in last tournament of Fall season 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
It's been a hectic five weeks for
the Stanford women's golf team.This
weekend, the Cardinal will play in the
Stanford Intercollegiate, its fourth
tournament over that span.
"It's been a whirlwind of tour
neys." said junior Mari Chun.
Indeed it has. but after this week
end. the first part of the regular sea
son will be over, and the team will get
nearly four months off to rest and
hone its game. While northern and
eastern schools will be kept inside,
the women will have a chance to, ac
cording to Chun, practice on the
course, perfect their mechanics and
engage in drills and physical strength
exercises.
"We'll set team goals over the long
and intermediate term. "Chun said.
Iliis will only help a constantly im
proving team that placed seventh last
week at the Hdean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional. "Our games are starting to
come together," said Chun. And just
in time, too: in order to stay ranked,
the No. 21 Cardinal will have to have

UP NEXT
THE STANFORD INTERCOLLEGIATE
10/19 Stanford, Calif.
GAME NOTES: According to the polls, Stanford is currently the
No. 21 team in the country. The Cardinal hosts some of the
best teams from around the nation this weekend at The Stan
ford Intercollegiate. The team will not compete in tournament
until February.

a good showing at the Stanford Intercollegiate.
The Cardinal was ranked as high as No this sea
son. but after below average showings at the first
two tournaments of the year, the teams ranking
dropped.
ihis could be attributed to the loss of two '07
graduates, Lauren Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana. Iliey were replaced by freshmen Re
becca Durham and Piper Miller.but th<.- difference
has been noticeable. "No one can replace them."
said Chun. "They are big shoes to fill." While the
team's chemistry is good ("I love my teammates!"
said Chun), the team must pick up the sla :k iti
order to compete this weekend and in next
spring's competitions.
Chun will have to lead the way — the junior
the Cardinal's best player. In nine rounds this year,
she has shot under par three times, and has placed
in the top 30 in all three tournaments this year, in
cluding an eighth place finish last weekend.
I ler teammates seem to be following her exam
ple: Durham, junior ki-Shui I.iao and sophomore
Catherina Wang had their best finishes of the sea
son at the Edean Ihlanfeldt. Rut that might be a
testament more to the quality of the competition
than to the team's play: Wang, ( hun and Durham
all shot better at the first two tournaments but.due
to tougher fields, finished lower.
Yet in the end. the Cardinal will not be judged
on individual performances, but rather on how it
finishes as a team. Chun is confident that the Car
dinal, who placed fifth in the NCAA tournament
last year, can have a repeat performance or better.
"We're strong in the spring and the postsea
son." she said. "We have the potential to do really
well."
As for the team's low ranking?
"We don't pay attention to polls."
