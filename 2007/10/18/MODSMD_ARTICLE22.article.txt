## It ain't so bad at Stanford 
### 
A couple of weeks ago, I par
ticipated in one of my first
Stanford traditions (not
counting the insanity that is Band
Run) when I went to the Activities
Fair. I felt like I was following in
the footsteps of years of Stanford
freshmen, not only by attending
the fair — but by signing up for
way too many clubs.
It happens to the best of us: you
see so many interesting and fun op
portunities staring you in the face,
and while you pass up some
(Brazilian break-dance fighting
sounds awesome, but I'm pretty
sure I would be in a cast after the
first week) you can't help but sign
up for many others.
You're happy with yourself for
trying so many new things and get
ting involved — until you come to
the crazy realization that you are
actually going to have to do work
in college, and that most of these
groups will mean nothing more to
you than mailing-list emails you
have to constantly delete.
This experience actually makes
for a decent analogy to "sports
fandom" at Stanford (see, there is a
reason this is in the Sports Sec
tion!). I'm sure I wasn't alone when
I considered Stanford's incredible
athletics as a factor in choosing the
Farm for college. Even people who
have never heard of the Director's
Cup know of our reputation for
great teams in almost every sport.
So naturally, given that I love
sports and had already purchased
the All-Axess pass, I thought that I
would be going to sporting events
almost every day. Nope. As much
as 1 love procrastination, work has
already gotten in the way of at
tending many of these games and
matches. So far my total stands at
six sporting events — maybe a lit
tle more than most of my friends,
but not nearly as many as 1 had ex
pected for my first four weeks.
Although I have been disap
pointed by the quantity of games 1
have attended, the quality has been
outstanding (except for a couple
quarters of football) and 1 know
that this is true also for the teams
that I have yet to see play. The
jump in quality from the high
school sports that many of us fresh
men played and watched over the
last four years to the teams that we
now watch (and on which a select
few of us play) is hard to compre
hend.
Take, for example, our top
ranked women's soccer team — a
team that features many players
who play for national teams, both
at the senior or youth level. Now,
less than one year ago, I thought it
was pretty impressive when some
one at my high school got an all
conference award — I know I was
proud of getting one for baseball.
But I was nowhere near close to
being one of the best players in the
city of Chicago, let alone in my
state.
I won't mention if I was one of
the best in the country or not, but
I'm hoping that as Stanford stu
dents you all can figure that one
out. However, while Stanford
might not have admitted a world
class athlete when they let me in.
the campus is obviously full of
them.
And that brings me. after way
too much rambling, to the main
point of this article: take advantage
of having so many great teams to
support. 1 know this might sound a
bit hypocritical, given that I've al
ready admitted to not being able to
go to all of the sporting events that
I've wanted to attend, but I will
strive to do better as well.
Of course, there are many
events that you will have to miss
for some reason or another, but
when the opportunity is there, grab
it. lake it from a Chicago Bears fan
who hasn't been to a game in years
because it costs hundreds of dol
lars just to get in the stadium —
compared to a grand total of $0.00
for a seat in the Stanford Football
Red Zone — you won't have the
chance to see so many great teams
for so little cost ever again.
