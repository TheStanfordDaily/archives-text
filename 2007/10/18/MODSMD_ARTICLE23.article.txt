# Men's volleyball takes exhibition trip to Canada
## Cardinal starts competition today at the Husky Dino Cup 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's volleyball unofficially
starts its season this weekend when it travels
to Canada to compete at the Husky Dino
Cup. The four-team tournament will be held
at the University of Calgary, and besides the
Cardinal,features the University of the Pacif
ic, the University of Alberta and host school
Calgary.
ITie tournament starts today and concludes
on Saturday; each team will play each other

once in the round robin format.
Today, the Stanford men will go up against
the University of Calgary. Tomorrow brings a
match against the University of Alberta while
the Cardinal will finish off the weekend with a
match against Pacific.
Head coach John Kosty looked forward to
the challenge his team expects.
"It gives us an opportunity to evaluate
where we're at right now." Kosty explained. "It
does get some people some playing time. We're
in the mind frame of going up there to w in all of
the matches. We're heading to Calgary to
reestablish ourselves and our winning tradi
tion."
Stanford has been traveling to the Dino Cup
for over a decade now. In a way. it has become
an early-season ritual which the team uses for
both match experience and bonding time.
" Hie other aspect of the tournament we use

this for is a bonding experience," Kosty said.
"We're taking our entire team which is some
thing we normally do not do. It gives us the ex
perience for everyone to travel, to see what its
like to be on the road."
Itie team will also take several excursions
during the down time of their trip, visiting
Banff National forest and exploring the rest of
the Canadian wilderness.
"It gives us an opportunity to get outside of
the volleyball world and get to know each
other a bit better — spend some time off the
court in a team environment," Kosty said.
Although the team's regular season does
not begin until January, Stanford will be
back in action in a month when it hosts the
Stanford Tournament on Nov. 17. After that,
the team will undergo a month-long break
before starting the season in the beginning
of January.

The Cardinal compotes in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation, which is easily the
best conference in the country and features
schools such as UCLA, USC, Pepperdine and
UC-Santa Barbara. Nearly all of the 12 teams
are ranked in the top 15 of the nation, and an
MPSF school has won the national champi
onship in 19 of the last 20 years.
Despite the challenges that Stanford is suie
to see in MPSF play, Kosty was optimistic
about the upcoming 2008 season.
"With the year of experience we received
last year, the game time our freshmen had, i
think we're — right now — better than we
were [then]" he said.
"I'm very positive heading into this tourna
ment and heading into the season starting in
January"
