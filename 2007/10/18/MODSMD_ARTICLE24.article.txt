## Insomniac fish aid gene research 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Aquarium owners may want to
take a second look — their fish might
not be sleeping. Some fish, Stanford
School of Medicine researchers have
discovered, can get insomnia.
These sleeping zebrafish develop
the disorder due to a genetic muta
tion. Iliis discovery may help scien
tists learn more about the role of
genes in human sleep problems.
The results of the study were pub
lished Oct. 16 in Public Library of
Science — Biology.
Researchers will now pursue
studies of other zebrafish gene muta
tions that result in full sleep depriva
tion or oversleeping.
"Many people ask the questions.

'Why are we sleeping?' and.'What is
the function of sleep?' 1 think it is
more important to figure out first
how the brain produces and regu
lates sleep." study author L)r. Em
manuel Mignot said in a prepared
statement to U.S. News and World
Report."This will give us important
clues on how and maybe why sleep
has been selected by natural evolu
tion and is so universal."
