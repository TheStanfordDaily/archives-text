## Flu vaccine draws long lines 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
There's one season that gets no love from anyone:
flu season. As campus braces for the impending wave
of influenza, Vaden Health Center is easing anxiety
by holding weekly flu immunizations through Octo
ber and November for faculty, staff and students.
The first of these sessions — held yesterday —
brought a large number of patients. The line for the
vaccine snaked from the upstairs clinic, through the
lobby and out of the door.
Despite the wait, most in line were patient.
"They have at least two stations where they are
giving injections," said Have Acheson. a librarian at
Meyer. "They have it really well organized, so that

even though the line is long, it's moving all the time."
"They go as fast as they can while they're sticking
you with needles," added Hoover librarian Paul
Thomas with a laugh.
There was even a little drama when a rumor sur
faced that some nurses were not wearing gloves while
administering the vaccine.
"None of them was wearing gloves," said Vladimir
Privalov, rubbing the band-aid on his arm. "As med
ical procedure, everyone is supposed to wear gloves,
especially those who administer flu shots. They could
contaminate the very area they are trying to disin
fect."

get the vaccination as
early as I can."

Students, faculty and staff waited in line yesterday at Vaden for their annual flu shots. The vaccination will be offered Wednesdays throughout October and November.
neonatology department, said this
year was the first he had experi
enced the problem.
"The first year 1 was here, every
thing was done properly," he said.
"The person who was giving the
shots changed gloves for every pa
tient."
Health safety concerns were not
the only complaints of those waiting
in line.
Some were surprised at the dif
ference in price of the vaccination
for University employees and stu
dents. While the shot is free for fac
ulty and staff, it costs $22 for stu
dents not enrolled in Cardinal Care
and $11 for those enrolled in the in
surance program.
"1 feel like we pay enough for the
health insurance already," said
Michael Cammarano, a doctoral
student in computer science. "It
would be nice if this were included."
"1 have no idea what their rea
soning is," Acheson added, "but it
doesn't seem equitable to me."
Nonetheless, the incentive to be
vaccinated was shared among all.
"It's really important," Acheson
said. "I've gotten it for 11 of the past
12 years, and the one year I didn't
get a shot, 1 got the flu."
"Recently I'm just trying to get
the vaccination as early as 1 can,"
Cammarano added. "It's cheap, it's
easy and it seems like a good thing."
Vaden Health Center will hold
weekly influenza immunization clin
ics on Wednesday afternoons from 3
to 6 p.m. until Dec. 5. excluding Nov.
21, when campus will be largely va
cated for Thanksgiving break. The
vaccine will not be given to individu
als with severe colds or other infec
tions, or to those who are allergic to
eggs. Pregnant women in their first
trimester will require medical clear
ance from their obstetrician.
