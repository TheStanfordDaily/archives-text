## Learning to fly, in your dreams 
### TRIHUNG NGUYEN 
Imagine you can tly out of the window, through
the street and to the countryside. The view be
fore your eyes is spectacular, and the feeling of
being free in mid-air is sensational.
Stacey Svetlichnaya' 11 can do that at will. At least,
she can in her dreams.
"Well, the sensation is still a little dream like,"
Svetlichnaya said. ' But it is definitely more real
than a normal dream."
Svetlichnaya experiences a state called "lucid
dreaming" — aware that she's dreaming while the
dream is still in progress, yet able to actively partic
ipate in the dream and even change the course of
events.
Controlling impossible, lifelike actions while
dreaming has appealed to those from ancient
philosophers to modern day college students. Dr.
Stephen Laßerge. Ph.D. '80 was one of those stu
dents, researching the then-frowned-upon subject
30 years ago. Laßerge wrote his dissertation on the
subject and was the first to lay a scientific foundation for the field.
"At first, it was really difficult to get my article published in a sci
entific journal," Laßerge said. "The editor could find nothing
wrong with my paper, but they refused to believe that it was
real." 4

Laßerge has come a long way since. He has published
several books, runs a business on lucid dreaming and trav
els extensively to train people in it. Most recently, he con
ducted a 10-day conference in Hawaii to discuss various
aspects of the subject.

"Everyone dreams every night during R.E.M.
sleep, which constitutes about 25 percent of [their] en
tire sleep," Leßerge said. Lucid dreaming "is only the
matter of realizing that we are dreaming, and not
waking up after realizing that."
Indeed, many people who start practicing lucid
dreaming find having a stable lucid dream — that is,
not waking up — the most difficult step. In ongoing
research, Laßerge has been investigating simple,
though odd-sounding, techniques to help dreamers to
stay inside their dreams longer.
"As long as you realize that you are dreaming, try
to spin your dream-body or rub your dream-hand."
Laßerge described. "Our researches have shown that
consciousness can only be at one place at a time, either
your real body or your dream body. By moving your
dream body, you have immobilized your real body;

hence you prevent yourself from waking up."
While Laßerge believes that through practice and
genuine desire everyone can master the art and be
come able to actively participate in his own dream,
many lucid dreamers have prior dreaming abilities.

"i think lucid dreaming requires a talent, just like musical
talent," said Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Professor
William C. Dement, Laßerge's dissertation advisor. "Of
course, you still need practice to improve it."
Yonah Berwaldt '08 notes that his lucid dreams have oc
curred without conscious practice, and thinks his sleeping skills

are naturally greater than others'.
"If I want to remember my dream." he said, "the night before I
would tell myself to remember my dream, and I would indeed n
member my dream in the morning."

Though the subject may sound unscientific to academic skeptics,
Laßerge has always received support from Dement, who believes that the
measuring technique Leßerge used and the results obtained are concrete scientific evidence of
lucid dreaming.
When asked about the implications of lucid dreaming for the tuture. the two were very opti
mistic.
"When we were at the mutually destructive tension with the Soviet Union." Dement said, "the
general could have lucid dreamed to know what a nuclear holocaust would be like.The risk of such
[an] event would then be averted."
Leßerge didn't go as far as his former advisor, instead expressing hope that this form of virtual re
ality could help each individual learn from his inner self.
"It can be very educational," he said."Your lucid dreams can change the way you see the world,
and bring out some of the hidden potentials in you."
Though some critics are concerned about potential psychological and physiological harms, the
duo thinks the subject needs more study.
"There are many things we have not understood about R.E.M. sleep and sleep in general, espe
cially the purpose behind it." Dement said.
More than 2,000 years ago, Aristotle offered pertinent advice.
"A dream is real as long as it lasts," the Greek philosopher wrote. "Can we say more about life?"
