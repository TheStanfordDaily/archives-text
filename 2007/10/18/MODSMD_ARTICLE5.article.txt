## Secret library remains undiscovered 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thrill-seeking couples can now do much better than
the South Stacks for exciting "study breaks" â€” a new
library with secret coordinates, high-tech security and
unmarked trucks awaits. But good luck finding it.
For the past three years, five University librarians
have been working full-time to move truck loads of sel
dom-accessed materials to a secret, high-tech storage
facility some 50 miles from campus, a library
spokesperson said. A total of three million volumes will
be moved by 2012, and some of the material is so valu
able that only select personnel in the library system
know where the clandestine facility is located.
"The libraries continue to buy lOO.(MX) volumes a
year," said Andrew I lerkovic. the director of communi
cations and development for the libraries.
The purchases include newspapers, magazines, pho
tographs, sound recordings, videos,personal and corpo
rate papers and even works in progress.
"It's pretty much a given that we cannot build new
library storage facilities on campus." I lerkovic said.
"Even if we had absolute title to every shelf on campus,
we just couldn't hold everything."
So the solution, according to I lerkovic. was Stan
ford Auxiliary Library (SAI.) 3 - a modular,"magnif
icently high-tech," above-ground facility built from
scratch in 2003 to accommodate Stanford's fast-grow
ing collection of materials that could not fit on campus.
Because students and faculty cannot get in even for
a tour. Herkovic volunteered a mental image not un-

The Green Library stacks are filled to the brim, so librarians have moved rarely-accessed materials to a top-secret facility called
SAL 3. The library's location remains unknown, largely due to the high value of some of the materials held there.
like the final seenes from the film
"Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix."
"It's like kind of a nightmare vision
of books as high and as far as you can
see in a canyon-like environment." he
said. "The shelves are 30 feet high and
exactly 52 inches apart.Hie forklift de
vice we use to access the books are ex
actly 48 inches wide so it's very narrow,
very claustrophobic and very cold."
"It's a very weird kind of space and
place to work," he added.
ITie University of California li
brary system maintains two of these

high-density storage facilities, and
I lerkovic said Stanford engineers vis
ited the facilities "to learn from their
mistakes" and produce a newer, more
advanced design.
The cavernous rooms are refriger
ated according to sophisticated atmos
pheric controls, and an automated fire
suppression system is in place as a last
resort in case disaster strikes. The
building even maintains its own water
reservoir for this contingency.
Because no researchers will ever phys
ically browse the shelves, the princi
ples behind cataloging are naturally
different.
"The materials are grouped by size
and date of storage." Herkovic said.
"They're in no intellectual order, and
only stored for maximum density and
maximum retrievability."

Everything that enters and exits
the facility is processed by computer
ized inventory software that can pin
point the exact physical location. A
truck transports requested materials
from the library' on a daily basis, and
the transit time is one business day.
"It's only a minor technicality that
these goods are stored off-campus,"
1 lerkovic insisted.
When asked by The Daily for the
third time where the facility is located,
1 lerkovic chuckled and paused before
replying.
"We have a very good security sys
tem," he said. "The fact that I'm not
going to give you the address has
something to do with that."
