October 13,1983:
University includes ASSU
Recycling in budget
ASSU Recycling has picked
up something more valuable than
soggy newspapers and empty
coca-cola cans.
The university has given the
money-losing project $16,000,
thereby making ASSU Recycling
a permanent part of the Universi
ty's budget.
The Project managers say that
the extra money will allow them
to expand their services, while
ASSU officials say it should cover
any future losses Recycling might
incur.
The ASSU has absorbed Recy
cling's losses each year since the
project began serving the campus
in 1978.
There are now more than 200
locations on campus for recycling
pickup and more than 300 barrels.
About 10 tons of newspaper
are collected at the University
every week and sold to a firm in
San Jose for reprocessing. Other
materials collected include glass,
computer paper, and aluminum.
