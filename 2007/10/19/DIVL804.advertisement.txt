At McMaster-Carr, we welcome all academic backgrounds. In fact,
many of our successful managers were led by curiosity to study such non
business fields as abstract math, biology, or political science. Others
pursued degrees in fields like accounting, computer science, or industrial .
engineering. Regardless of their majors, their intelligence, creativity, and
passion for details enable them to thrive here.
Our customers know us as a one-stop shop for industrial widgets
of all types and sizes. Our employees know us as a unique
business run like no other. We develop our own catalog and engage in
intensive market research. We write our own software systems in-house.
We run our operations with passion and precision. We rely on our own
expertise for continual process improvement.
Do you want to continue learning in a vibrant setting? Our
management development career path will give you the opportunity to learn
all aspects of our unique business, from catalog development and market
research to finance, software development, and product distribution. This
cross-functional exposure will allow you to build the knowledge and
experience that is critical to becoming a leader in our organization.
We will be coming to campus to interview for this unique role.
