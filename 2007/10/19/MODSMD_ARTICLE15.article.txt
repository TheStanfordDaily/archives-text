## Editorial Board Flexibility requires responsibility 
### 
This year's add and drop deadlines
were a week later than in years past.
Instead of two weeks, students had
three to add classes, instead of three, they
had four to drop. This change is a good
thing for students as it allows us more time
to plan and thus more flexibility — as long
as students understand that the deadlines
are policies of the Registrar and not neces
sarily of professors.
ITie University does an excellent job of
streamlining course registration — for
most classes,all a student needs to do is sign
up on Axess and he or she is enrolled in the
class. Unlike the students at many state
schools, Stanford students are not trapped
in their major for five years because they
cannot get into the courses they need. Stu
dents do not need to sign up for Econ 50 or
Chem 318 right at midnight when enroll
ment opens to take the course. While some
classes do restrict the number of students,
even those who gripe about being turned
away can probably at least see the reason
behind the rejection, such as a small semi
nar format or the limits of a lab.
The current system caters well to the
student body, and adding administrative
flexibility can facilitate the process for stu
dents who are still deciding which on how
many courses to take. For example, consid
er a student who has chosen two 5-unit
classes and one 2-unit class, but is still try
ing to choose between two other 5-unit
classes. She can take both the classes, but
can't add both in Axess because of the 20-
unit limit. In this case, the extra week be
fore the add deadline might help her deter
mine which class she wants to take and for
mally enroll in. If another student enrolls
in 20 academic units but later realizes that

the load is too much for her, the later drop
deadline has given her an extra week to
make this determination. Maybe a
midterm is now graded before the deadline
instead of after, or maybe the professor
who wants the midterm before the drop
deadline can now move the midterm back a
week (making it closer to the MlDdle of
the TERM, perhaps).
The policy is an improvement for the
students only if they understand its impli
cations. Problems could arise for the unin
formed student who incorrectly thinks that
she can pick up a class after 30 percent of
the quarter has passed or fails to decide on
any classes for the first three weeks of
school. Fortunately, the requirement to
submit a study list before the add deadline
helps with the latter problem. The risk re
mains that students who are incapable of
making a decision without the spur of a
hard deadline now have another week to
fail to take control of their academics. Stu
dents need to know that the add deadline
and the drop deadline are administrative
only — they dictate whether you can for
mally enroll in the course in Axess to get
credit for it from the University. They con
trol nothing else.
The University's many sources of aca
demic guidance should help students, espe
cially freshmen, learn this reality. Stanford
is confusing the first time around, so
HPACs, peer mentors and freshman aca
demic advisors should be careful to explain
what the deadlines do and do not mean.
Professors can also help reduce confu
sion. Many already state in the Bulletin or
time schedule that an application or atten-

dance at the first class is mandatory
to take the course; those who do not
currently have such requirements
could include information in the
syllabus. If professors would rather
leave their policy flexible, they
could specify that in the syllabus as
well. Regardless, perspicuity from
professors about their own specific
policies can only make it easier for
students to accommodate these
policies.
Ultimately, it is the responsibili
ty of students to understand aca
demic policies and plan their own
educations — if they need help.
Stanford has many resources avail
able to answer their questions. For
responsible students, more flexibil
ity in the administrative manage
ment of course enrollment does no
harm and may do significant good.
