## For girls, smart is ugly? 
### 
Stanford girls are not so attractive. Stan
ford guys are cute. Everyone has heard
the speculations. Guys start to com
plain about the sub par field freshman year.
Many Stanford women agree that Stanford
men, on average, are better looking than
their female counterpoints.
The College Prowler Web site, which
markets itself as "the only college guides by
students and for students," gave Stanford
men a B. The ladies got a C+. "A lot of stu
dents, particularly the male ones," the Col
lege Prowler reports, "will express the con
troversial opinion that at Stanford the guys
are hot, and the girls are not."
A catchall disclaimer next to the
Prowler's gender ratings explains that a high
grade "not only implies that the women on
campus are attractive, smart, friendly, and
engaging, hut also that there is a fair ratio of
girls to guys." Considering Stanford has an
-almost perfectly equal gender ratio and
high academic standards for acceptance, it
appears to be attractiveness, friendliness
and charm that Stanford gals are lacking.
The women at Arizona State and Florida
State both got A+s.
Why is it that women at a highly academ
ic school are, or are seen as, just not that
cute? 1 am not quite sure, first of all. how one
goes about confirming or denying broad
statements about the average attractiveness
of a group of people constantly in flux. (I
suppose it's about as accurate as saying that
Americans are rude, Germans are efficient
and frogs are romantic.)The fact alone, how
ever. that a large number of students think
Stanford girls are less attractive is troubling.
I'd like to think it could partly be due to
location — Stanford doesn't have the SoCal
pressures of fashion and the constant anxi
ety of nearby beaches. It's colder up here,
co-op-ier and more low key. Girls don't
overtly try as hard — less make-up.less hair,
fewer all-out outfits.
Stanford's Olympic-ready athletes also
play a roll in female-male perceptions of at
tractiveness. Abercrombie and I itch male

swimmers, track runners and soccer and
water polo players fill up frats and are con
spicuously good looking on campus. Both
unfairly and sadly, built, athletic women are
generally not considered as desirable as
their muscular male peers.
The major reason for the perceived dis
parity in gender appeal, however, is that the
social benefits from being a pretty girl fre
quently outweigh the motivations to excel
academically. Good looks often equate to
popularity in high school, which means
more time spent socializing and partying
and less resume-padding extracurriculars
and studying.
Boys seem to get away with being good
looking and serious about school more easi
ly than girls, and I'm not entirely sure why.
Women are judged more acutely on their
looks than men. and adolescent girls react
more strongly to positive attention towards
their looks. Maybe it is just plain ol' carry
over from traditional gender rolls: men
work and study, women marry smart men
with good jobs. It's cute when a boy is seri
ous about science, but strange and unnatural
when a girl gets intimate with the Krebs
cycle.
Rather interestingly, plays and movies
seem to have been obsessed with the smart
ugly girl problem for centuries.
Take "10 Things I Hate About You," a
modern adaptation of Shakespeare's " lam
ing of the Shrew." Beautiful, popular Bianca
