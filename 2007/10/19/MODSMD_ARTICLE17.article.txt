'Secret' library not a secret
To the Editor,
After reading Gerry Shih's article in yes
terday's paper, "Secret library remains uncov
ered." I couldn't help checking the date. Had
April Fool's Day come early? Or I lallowecn?
In characterizing Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary (SAL) 3 as a "secret" storage facility,
Andrew Herkovic surely must have been
having some fun with your reporter; the tim
ing of the article's publication.one day after
the Stanford University Libraries and Aca

tlemic Information Resources (SULAIR)
open house event, was a bit ironic. As any
one can discover from a cursory perusal of
the SULAIR Web site or a simple Google
search, SAL 3 is located at 475 Longfellow
Ct. in Livermore. Calif. (Jetting there from
Palo Alto is a bit of a shlep. but tours are oc
casionally offered by appointment. I went
with some of my library colleagues this sum
mer. and SAL 3 director Ron Sadler even
provided refreshments.
