# Burning Down the House
## He is the walrus

There's a famous line from The Aeneid
about the Trojan Horse, "Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes," which trans
lates approximately to "You can tell Tom
Friedman's an asshole by his mustache." It
was this ancient warning that 1 kept in mind
when 1 went with my roommate Alyssa to see
Friedman on Saturday in Maples.
It was a deeply troubling experience.
Maples itself was tarted up to look like the
set ofThe Late Show, with a blue-lit stage and
blasting muzak. And that's not even to men
tion the crowd. "Look at this." I said. "It's a
sea of white guys in blazers and slacks, wear
ing Bluetooth earpieces." We giggled nerv
ously and looked around at the alumni drift
ing ever more thickly into the room. As the
arena filled up. they seemed to close in on us.
We huddled together like emperor penguins
desperate for warmth in a swirling winter
gale. Catastrophe seemed imminent. I waited
for the man in front of us to put down his
Blackßerry.turn around, point and emit one

of those screams from"The Invasion of the
Bodysnatchers" that the aliens use to identi
fy unassimilated humans.
I guess I should explain why I feel this way
about the unbearable groupthink of Fried
man-lovers. Let's start with Tom's recent
opus, "The World Is Flat." Here, not actually
having the courage to read it myself, I rely on
the good work of reviewer MattTaibbi:"Man
flies on planes, observes the wonders of cap
italism, says we're not in Kansas anymore.
(He actually says we're not in Kansas any
more.) That's the whole plot right there."
But Friedman isn't notable for the tired

and thoughtless bourgeois masturbation that
amounts to his ideology. Rather, the extraor
dinary thing about him is how he couches
completely banal ideas in nonsensical
metaphors and, by the inherently novel char
acter of these metaphors, believes he's blaz
ing new intellectual trails.
In fact, as Taibbi points out, the central
metaphor of the book makes no sense:
"Flat is a physical,geographic concept that
Friedman...is openly contrasting — ironical
ly, as it were — with Columbus's discovery
that the world is round. Except for one thing.
The significance of Columbus's discovery
was that on a round earth, humanity is more
interconnected than on a flat one. On a round
earth, the two most distant points are closer
together than they are on a flat earth."
The problem? Friedman mistakes a
metaphor for a deep thought. But the
metaphor doesn't even work, and the thought

ain't deep. It's a habit of his.
So, on Saturday morning, we
heard that the Middle East is a gas
station with antisemitism and do
mestic-abuse problems, and that our
economy is a monster truck with a
stuck gas pedal and a lost key, among
other things. Neither of these points
is even actually wrong, though the
metaphors don't really scan. Fur
ther, Friedman appears, theatrically
dropping his voice to a whisper, to
have just discovered them.
The real source of Friedman's
inanity is that he knows a little bit,
but apparently not enough to know
how much he doesn't understand.
ITius he says — I think about eight
times on Saturday — that he's real

ized that "context matters."To trans
late, Friedman now believes that
events are not purely random, but. in
fact, are related to the circumstances
surrounding them.
For example, he notes — 1 think
correctly — that radical Islamic ter
rorism is the result of years of Ameri
can-sanctioned political repression in
the Islamic world. Friedman's solu
tion to Arab resentment of the Amer
ican-backed political regime? Ameri
can invasion. To sum up: Friedman is
smart enough to understand that
Arabs, like everyone else, want their
human and civil rights, and that
they're pissed that we are complicit in
denying them these rights. Friedman
is not smart enough to understand
that occupying a country already re
sentful of us for helping repress them
was unlikely to be endearing.
Of course, plenty of people made
this latter point back in 2(X)2, but
thev weren't Serious, Thoughtful.

Mustachioed Thinkers like Fried
man, so it didn't count.
And this is the deep problem.The
other panelists — including the im
pressive Justice Breyer and the oddly
Dick Cheney-like John Hennessy —
all bought Friedman's bullshit, de
spite the fact that they are all, quite
obviously, smarter than him. Fried
man. a total mediocrity, is a Trojan
horse for toxic ideas. Because he's an
apparent liberal with a distinguished
mustache and a Times column, he is,
by definition. Important.
Stanford's got no business treat
ing him like a real intellect. Fried
man's a useful idiot, easily convinced
of horrible ideas that he believes are
brilliant. He's just gullible. Because
we listen, we are too.
Coo-coo-ca-choo.
