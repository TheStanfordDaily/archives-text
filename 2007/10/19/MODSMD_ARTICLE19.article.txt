# Burning Down the House
## He is the walrus

There's a famous line from The Aeneid
about the Trojan Horse, "Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes," which trans
lates approximately to "You can tell Tom
Friedman's an asshole by his mustache." It
was this ancient warning that 1 kept in mind
when 1 went with my roommate Alyssa to see
Friedman on Saturday in Maples.
It was a deeply troubling experience.
Maples itself was tarted up to look like the
set ofThe Late Show, with a blue-lit stage and
blasting muzak. And that's not even to men
tion the crowd. "Look at this." I said. "It's a
sea of white guys in blazers and slacks, wear
ing Bluetooth earpieces." We giggled nerv
ously and looked around at the alumni drift
ing ever more thickly into the room. As the
arena filled up. they seemed to close in on us.
We huddled together like emperor penguins
desperate for warmth in a swirling winter
gale. Catastrophe seemed imminent. I waited
for the man in front of us to put down his
Blackßerry.turn around, point and emit one

of those screams from"The Invasion of the
Bodysnatchers" that the aliens use to identi
fy unassimilated humans.
I guess I should explain why I feel this way
about the unbearable groupthink of Fried
man-lovers. Let's start with Tom's recent
opus, "The World Is Flat." Here, not actually
having the courage to read it myself, I rely on
the good work of reviewer MattTaibbi:"Man
flies on planes, observes the wonders of cap
italism, says we're not in Kansas anymore.
(He actually says we're not in Kansas any
more.) That's the whole plot right there."
But Friedman isn't notable for the tired

and thoughtless bourgeois masturbation that
amounts to his ideology. Rather, the extraor
dinary thing about him is how he couches
completely banal ideas in nonsensical
metaphors and, by the inherently novel char
acter of these metaphors, believes he's blaz
ing new intellectual trails.
In fact, as Taibbi points out, the central
metaphor of the book makes no sense:
"Flat is a physical,geographic concept that
Friedman...is openly contrasting — ironical
ly, as it were — with Columbus's discovery
that the world is round. Except for one thing.
The significance of Columbus's discovery
was that on a round earth, humanity is more
interconnected than on a flat one. On a round
earth, the two most distant points are closer
together than they are on a flat earth."
The problem? Friedman mistakes a
metaphor for a deep thought. But the
metaphor doesn't even work, and the thought
