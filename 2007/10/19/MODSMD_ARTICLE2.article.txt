## Stanford faces midseason must-win against Wildcats 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford football — and whoever lines up
at tailback — visits the Arizona Wildcats to
morrow at 4 p.m. in a game the team must win
to keep its lingering bowl hopes alive.
Written on a locker room whiteboard are
the team's goals, set before the season. "Win a
national title. Win a conference title." Maybe
those will come in future years.The most real
istic target on the list, "make a bowl game," is
still in play for the 2-4 (1-3 Pac-10) Cardinal at
the season's midpoint.
"I'm very pleased with the way our team
has gone through adversity," coach Jim Har
baugh said. "They haven't won as many games
as we'd like to (have won] at the halfway point,
but overall. I'm very proud of our team and
looking forward to the next six weeks."
Howl eligibility requires six victories, or for
Stanford, winning all but two of their remain
ing games: at Arizona, at Oregon State, Wash
ington, at Washington State, Notre Dame and
Cal.The top-10 Bears will be heavy favorites
and Oregon State and Washington are no
slouches either, so any likely bowl game sce
nario for Stanford involves a win against the
lowly Wildcats (2-5,1-3 Pac-10).
Strangely, both Stanford and Arizona
probably hope tomorrow's game is decided
when the Cardinal has the ball.That's because
Stanford's offense and Arizona's defense are
each team's strength, ranking 73rd and 67th,
respectively, of the 119 Division I-A teams in
the country.
A no-name front seven anchors the Wild
cat defense and kept it close in last week's 20-
13 near-upset of USC.They have allowed just
120 ground yards per game, and held the Tro
jans to a meager 276 total yards.
In the secondary,standout corner Antoine
Cason is perhaps the best defensive back
sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard has
yet to see. But the rest of the unit is thin, and
the Stanford receiving corps of sophomore
Richard Sherman and seniors Mark Bradford
and Evan Moore have to be liking the oppor
tunities they've seen in the film room. Sher
man has caught for an average of 83 yards per
game thus far this season,good for fourth-best
in the conference.

NOTES: After falling just short in a 38-36 loss at home
to TCU, the Cardinal will look to rebound on the road
against the Wildcats. Anzona boasts a stout defense
that led the charge against USC last week as the Wild
cats nearly handed the Trojans their second major
upset in a row Southern California managed just a
3 4 yards per carry average against Arizona's defense
The Wildcat offense couldn't come through, though,
as Arizona lost three fumbles and only rushed for a
1.4 yards per carry average


GUS JEWELL/The Stanford Daily
Junior running back Anthony Kimble turned in the best game of his career against TCU, but mcy be unavailable against the Wildcats as the Cardinal looks increasingly thin in the backfield.
