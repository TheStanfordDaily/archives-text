## Stanford faces midseason must-win against Wildcats 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford football — and whoever lines up
at tailback — visits the Arizona Wildcats to
morrow at 4 p.m. in a game the team must win
to keep its lingering bowl hopes alive.
Written on a locker room whiteboard are
the team's goals, set before the season. "Win a
national title. Win a conference title." Maybe
those will come in future years.The most real
istic target on the list, "make a bowl game," is
still in play for the 2-4 (1-3 Pac-10) Cardinal at
the season's midpoint.
"I'm very pleased with the way our team
has gone through adversity," coach Jim Har
baugh said. "They haven't won as many games
as we'd like to (have won] at the halfway point,
but overall. I'm very proud of our team and
looking forward to the next six weeks."
Howl eligibility requires six victories, or for
Stanford, winning all but two of their remain
ing games: at Arizona, at Oregon State, Wash
ington, at Washington State, Notre Dame and
Cal.The top-10 Bears will be heavy favorites
and Oregon State and Washington are no
slouches either, so any likely bowl game sce
nario for Stanford involves a win against the
lowly Wildcats (2-5,1-3 Pac-10).
Strangely, both Stanford and Arizona
probably hope tomorrow's game is decided
when the Cardinal has the ball.That's because
Stanford's offense and Arizona's defense are
each team's strength, ranking 73rd and 67th,
respectively, of the 119 Division I-A teams in
the country.
A no-name front seven anchors the Wild
cat defense and kept it close in last week's 20-
13 near-upset of USC.They have allowed just
120 ground yards per game, and held the Tro
jans to a meager 276 total yards.
In the secondary,standout corner Antoine
Cason is perhaps the best defensive back
sophomore quarterback Tavita Pritchard has
yet to see. But the rest of the unit is thin, and
the Stanford receiving corps of sophomore
Richard Sherman and seniors Mark Bradford
and Evan Moore have to be liking the oppor
tunities they've seen in the film room. Sher
man has caught for an average of 83 yards per
game thus far this season,good for fourth-best
in the conference.

NOTES: After falling just short in a 38-36 loss at home
to TCU, the Cardinal will look to rebound on the road
against the Wildcats. Anzona boasts a stout defense
that led the charge against USC last week as the Wild
cats nearly handed the Trojans their second major
upset in a row Southern California managed just a
3 4 yards per carry average against Arizona's defense
The Wildcat offense couldn't come through, though,
as Arizona lost three fumbles and only rushed for a
1.4 yards per carry average

Junior running back Anthony Kimble turned in the best game of his career against TCU, but mcy be unavailable against the Wildcats as the Cardinal looks increasingly thin in the backfield.
"The effort has been good and
some of these big plays, when you
break down what happened — we
were in a position to make it but just
blew an assignment or missed a tackle
and that led to the big play," Harbaugh
said of his defense."! think we have a
level of consistency that's growing and
getting better all the time."
Arizona's offense is very much a
one-man show. That's as much credit
to junior quarterback Willie TUitama
and his All-Pac-10-worthy statline
(2,055 yards, 15 touchdowns,seven in
terceptions, 62.4 percent accuracy,
130.4 rating) as it is an indictment of
the rest of the team. Reciever
Michael Thomas (506 yards, six

touchdowns) is Tuitama's favorite
target, but the rest of the offense —
especially the ground game — has
yet to shine.
"They throw it all over the place
with an experienced quarterback and
excellent receivers." Harbaugh said.
"I think being able to get pressure on
the quarterback and covering those
wideouts will be key for us this week."
And for Stanford, this week is key
to maintaining any hope of attaining
one of this season's top goals: making
a bowl game.

But given their front seven's
strength and Stanford's personnel is
sues, Arizona may sit back in a zone
and dare the Cardinal to run. The
Card's top three tailbacks,sophomore
Toby Gerhart, junior Anthony Kim
ble (the Pac-10's No. 3 rusher) and
freshman Jeremy Stewart, all may not
play because of injuries, which places
a heavy burden on sophomore Tyrone
McGraw and senior Jason Evans. Mc-
Graw and Evans are no typical fourth
string backs: McGraw factors into the
return game heavily and Evans start
ed in previous seasons, but the poten
tial loss of the top three tailbacks is a
high hurdle.
The razor-thin backfield is one rea
son Stanford is a 10-point underdog.
Another is a defense that seemed to
regress in last week's 38-36 heart
breaking homecoming loss against
TCU, yielding 494 yards, 344 of them
through the air. Unlike most strug
gling teams, youth is actually a valid
excuse in Stanford's case — six un
derclassmen and just two seniors will
start for the Cardinal's D' tomorrow.
Still, the numbers are ugly: Stanford is
allowing 294 passing and 161 rushing
vards each game.
