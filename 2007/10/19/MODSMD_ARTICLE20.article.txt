# Nat-Ural Philosophy
## The 						refined art of food fraud 
### 
On the surface, it really was only a
medium-quality hamburger. It was
modestly decorated with rapidly dry
ing lettuce, tomatoes from a can, and three
pieces of American cheese. But the patty in
my hands, when it entered my mouth, was im
maculate. Instead of ketchup or mayonnaise,
it was slathered with a sauce that no money
can buy: self-satisfaction.
The smoke from the grill billowed out in
clouds over my head as I sat dining on my
loot in the courtyard outside the chemistry
buildings. It truly was the perfect c-rime, and
my burger was the ill-gotten gains of a well
engineered grift.
This was no job for an amateur. An ama
teur would have attended the Graduate
School of Chemistry Chemical Fair, realized
that he/she had to fill out an identification
form, then get a checklist signed by 10 of the
chemical company vendors whose booths
surrounded the event, and then simply

turned around. But not this con man.
It all went down yesterday after chemistry
class. A friend and I, upon realizing from the
smell of burgers that there was free food
afoot, put on our best grad school voices and
started talking about the wife and kids. We
approached the registration table and I
paused, halfway through a mock-explana
tion of the trials of potty-training, to reach
for the identification form.
With unparalleled nonchalance, I in
formed the organizers of this event that my
name was "Fakename Freefoodington" in

the department of "Neurobiological Urolo
gy." I professed an interest in "left-bound tes
ticular femoral adhesion," though my pri
mary research was"scatology."Thus part one
of my quest for free food was complete. But
there still remained the sticky problem of the
ten signatures from chemical company ven
dors. I am proud to say that this was accom
plished through skilled forgery, executed in
the bushes beside the event, involving three
different kinds of pens.
And from the moment I picked up that
Slyrofoam plate, I knew that I could not turn
back. I was now the highest level of flim-flam
mer: the impostor. Of course I had dallied in
this realm before, executing the slightly less
refined manifestations of mountebankery.
But this was truly something else entirely,
something sublime.
Perhaps some of you are hosers your-

selves. You've swiped cola from an
iced keg bucket when no one was
watching. You've taken from the
snack trays that various Stanford de
partments abandon on the outskirts
of the quad. You've attended majors
dinners for majors you were barely
considering, gone to a "professor's
lunch," but taken out the "professor"
portion by taking the lunch tray at
the door, it seems that Stanford stu
dents on the whole will stop at no

lengths to find free food. But few of
you are among the elite ranks of the
Con(fidence) Artist.
Being a true CA is not about
skimming the surplus from the rap
idly rotating trays of Stern dining.
The key to true connery is not to be
found at the bottom of a dumpster
(or in the original James Bond
films). It is to be found in the lapels
of a suit and a business card.There is
certainly a wealth of free food float
ing around campus. But do you want
it all? We the "freegans" of the com
munity at large need to develop
standards. We need to raise our col
lective noses in the air as a sign that
free food, easily gotten, is not free

food at all.
Am 1 a shim-shammer? A
fleecer? No. 1 am an artist. And req
uisite in this business is some degree
of class.
Let my hamburger, and its sur
rounding ordeal, be your guide in
this era of readily available free
food. So put on those airs, take your
acting skills off the hanger in your
closet, and go out there and earn
yourself a free meal.
