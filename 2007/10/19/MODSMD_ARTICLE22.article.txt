Ilic No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team is
set to take on two more ranked opponents this
weekend when it plays for the top ranking in
the nation against No. I UCLA tonight: the

Cardinal will clash with No. 10 USC on Sunday
afternoon in the second weekend of Pacific-10
Conference play.
Stanford (10-1-1,1-0 Pac-10) is unbeaten in
four games and opened the conference season
with a bang last week, defeating archrival Cali
fornia 4-2 on Sunday. UCLA (^-1-2.2-0 Pac-10)
and Southern California (10-1-1. 2-0 Pac-10)
each cruised through their matches with the
Oregon schools to join the Cardinal with a per
fect start to the second stage of the 2007 season.
The Cardinal comes into the weekend look
ing good on offense and potentially shaky on
defense. Sophomore forward Kelley O'Hara

returned to the stat sheet against Cal last week
end with a goal and an assist, and five Stanford
players — O'Hara, seniors Shari Summers and
Lizzy George and freshmen Christen Press and
Morgan Redman — have double-digits in
points on the year.
Freshman goalkeeper Kira Maker contin
ues to impress, hut the normally stout Cardinal
defense showed signs of weakness against the
Golden Bears. Stanford repeatedly coughed up
the ball deep in its own half, handing scoring
opportunities to the opposing for
wards.
That unsteady defense could
spell trouble against UCLA. ITie
Bruins squad has ridden its explo
sive offense, ranked at the top of the
Pac-10 with 2.75 goals per game, to
the No. 1 ranking in the National
Soccer Coaches Association of
America (NSCAA) poll. Talented
sophomore forward Lauren Cheney
leads the way in blistering fashion,
topping the conference in goals with
13 in just 12 games so far—the same
number of goals as the entire Wash
ington team.
Senior forward Danesha Adams
has seven goals and five assists, while
sophomore forward Kara Lang, who
missed the start of the season to play
for Canada at the Women's World
Cup. already has three goals and an
assist in five games.
The Bruins' defense has been
keeping its opponents off the score
board while their offense has been
piling it on. Goalkeeper Valerie
Henderson has allowed just seven
goals this year in 12 games and over
1000 minutes of play.
USC promises to be another
tough matchup for Stanford. Goal

defenders are stingier than any other
team in the Pac-10. Southern Cal has
allowed just five goals and has
racked up eight shutouts already this
year. A balanced attack for the Tro
jans has seen plenty of success at the
other end of the field as well. Fresh
man forward Megan Ohai leads the
team in goals and points (six goals
and three assists for 15 points) and
three other USC forwards have four
goals apiece. Six different Trojan
players have contributed game-win
ning goals so far in 2007.
Both UCLA and USC have been
lights-out at home this season. The
Bruins are just 2-1-2 outside the
friendly confines of Westwood, los
ing the season opener to Texas in
Houston and only drawing with Pep
perdine and lowly Cal State North
ridge. Ibe Trojans' lone setback of
the year came in a 2-1 overtime loss
at Indiana.
