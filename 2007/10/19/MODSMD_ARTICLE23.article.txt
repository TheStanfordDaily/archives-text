# Card set to face Bears
## No. 24 Cal plays host to Stanford in rivalry game 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
In most situations, the San Fran
cisco Bay serves as a tangible division
between Stanford and Cal, marking
the dividing line in the Peninsula vs.
East Bay regional rivalry. However,
in Saturday's 2 p.m. meeting between
Stanford men's soccer and the rival
Golden Bears, the teams will likely
showcase more similarities than dif
ferences in their styles of play.
"1 think our teams are pretty simi
lar." said coach liret Simon. "We look
for skillful, exciting players. We both
like to have teams that attack. De
spite the fact that (neither team has]
scored a ton of goals, I think you'll see
a close game."
No. 24 Cal (7-4-1, 2-2-0 Pac-10)
traveled south with the Cardinal (4-3-
5,1-1-2) over the weekend, losing to
both No. 25 San Diego State and
UCLA. The Bears' record, however,
is good enough to place them second
overall in the Pac-10.
Cal's offense is among the best in
the conference, leading the Pac-10 in
both assists (19) and scoring (15).The
Bears rally behind senior midfielder
Andrew Jacobson (2 goals, 3 assists)
and leading scorer, freshman forward
Andrew Weidman (4 goals, 4 assists).
Simon thinks that his team's confi
dence this weekend will largely be a
result of familiarity with Weidman
and Cal.
"We know [Weidman) very well,"
Simon said. "We think very highly of
him â€” he has speed, he's got skill,
and he's good around the goal. He's a
very talented player, and we've seen
him a lot. [We also know] Weidman's
speed makes him a threat to get be
hind in defense."
That means Stanford's defense
will be back in the spotlight.The Car
dinal fell 2-0 on Sunday to SDSU,
ending a streak of five shutouts. On
the season, only nine shots have
found the back of the net against the
Card. However. Cal's defense and
goalkeeper Stefan Frei have been
nearly as impressive all year, leaving
