The team's meager results in its first

were hampered by the fact that they
only had a week of practice time
while most colleges had over a
month.
"We're just working our way up,"
the sophomore said. "We're working
our way into the season — we had a
week while everyone's been practic

ing a month. The team is so much
better right now.
"It was really disappointing at
All-American — it always is when
you lose. This will he one more step
ping stone on our way to getting
match-tough for the winter."
