After poor putting plagued them
at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational
last week, the Stanford women's
golf team has spent the week lead
ing up to the Stanford Intercolle
giate Tournament perfecting their
short game.
"Coach generally sets up differ
ent putting drills and certain goals
we have to reach for putting and
chipping," junior Ki-Shui Liao said.
The No. 21 Cardinal needs all the
practice it can get: this weekend,
they'll face a remarkably tough field
that includes No. 1 Duke and No. 2
UCLA.
"It might be a tough field," Liao
said. "(But) our team definitely has
the ability and talent to win this
week, especially with the advantage
of home course knowledge and ex
perience ... I think we're all more
comfortable playing at Stanford be
cause it's just like being out here
everyday."
One of the Cardinal's problems
last week was a wet course that soft
ened the greens and prohibited good
ball movement — the Stanford Golf
Course has a harder surface, so balls
move faster.
In addition, the support of the
local crowd should provide encour
agement that is nonexistent at away

tournaments. But even with home
field advantage and Stanford's sup
port. the Cardinal will still have to
produce on the links if it is to enter
its four-month mid-season break on
a positive note.
Liao said that while the team
hopes to win or place highly at the
Stanford Intercollegiate, they are
focused more on long term suc
cess.
"Fall season is our chance to get
back into things and for the fresh
men to accustom themselves to col
legiate tournaments." she said. "The
goals that we set for ourselves and
our team are for the entire year, so
we still have plenty of time to accom
plish these goals in the winter and
spring seasons."
And indeed, the break will do the
Cardinal well — many golfers are
nursing injuries that have hindered
their performance throughout the
fall season. Liao has been dealing
with "mild tendonitis" in her left
wrist. Sophomore Angela King saw
her first action of the year last week
end after rehabbing from an injury
throughout September.
But before its rest, Stanford must
first compete. Chun. Liao and King,
in addition to freshman Rebecca
Durham and sophomore Catherina
Wang will play as a team this week
end, while freshman Piper Miller

"I think the mindset of this team
is that we are always capable of win

win," Liao said.
That mentality will be tested, and
perhaps reinforced, at the Stanford
Intercollegiate Tournament.
