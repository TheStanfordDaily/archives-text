# Tavita Pritchard
## Football Pritchard at the heart of turnaround hopes 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
Quarterback Tavita Pritchard has already played wit
ness to one of the biggest upsets in the history of col
lege football.
ually, ho did more than just witness it: the redshirt
sophomore guided the Cardinal to its 24-23 win over the
then-No. 2 USCTrojans in the L. A. Coliseum two weeks ago.
And last week against TCU, the Tacoma, Wash, native pro
pelled Stanford to one of its best offensive performances in
recent memory
But when asked about how he led the Stanford offense
and its herd of receivers to one of the biggest wins in program
history, Pritchard downplayed his own contributions to the
victory.

"lf anything, I'm the supporting cast," he said. "Those
guys, [Bradford, Sherman and Moore], they're obviously, all
three, very special."
And what's more, the newest Stanford starting quarter
back has already shown that humility and leadership can go
hand-in-hand. In the win over Southern California, Pritchard
found himself exhorting his senior teammates to make a play
— insisting that the game was theirs for the taking.
And, it turns out, he was right.
"That's kind of one of those things where being a quarter
hack just kicks in," Pritchard said. "It probably wasn't really
a conscious thing, but you're in the heat of the game. I mean,
I vividly remember it. It's not like I don't remember saying it,
but it's one of those things where I was really looking at those
guys.
"Those are our seniors. Our receiver corps is very herald-

Ed, obviously one of the stronger parts of our team," he went
on. "Coming into the season we knew that. And I just told
them.'You guys are the seniors, you guys are going to have to
go make a play to win this game,' and that's what it came
down to."
But for Pritchard, the last-minute fade pass he lofted to
senior receiver Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal from the
10-yard line that proved the winning play in the monumental
upset was merely the start. For the new Cardinal signal-caller,
progress will he all about helping to author even more special
moments for Stanford before he's through.
"Hopefully, it gets better than that because I've got two
years left," he said. "That was a great game, obviously a huge
win for this program, but not necessarily what I want to be re
membered for. I want to go out there and do a whole lot more than
just beat 'SC that one time. We hope to do big things around here,
and I hope that's just a start."
For much of the TCU game, it appeared as if that would be the
case. Pritchard threw for 171 yards and two touchdowns, as well as
scrambling for another 53 yards on the ground. And when the rub
ber hit the road in the fourth quarter, there was Pritchard leading
the Cardinal down the field in the game's closing minutes once
again, dodging would-be sacks and exhibiting poise under pressure.
Pritchard credited his family's football background for his
strong play late in games, particularly the influence of his famous
uncle. Jack Thompson. TTiompson. nicknamed "The Throwin'
Samoan," starred for Washington State in the 70s, setting what was
at the time an NCAA record for career passing yards and Pac-10
records in career passing attempts, completions and touchdowns.

second comeback attempt in
as many weeks fell short on
Saturday, the near miss
seemed to leave little doubt
that Pritchard has a knack for
playing at his best with the
game on the line.
"Honestly, 1 think it's just
from playing football [for] a
long time," Pritchard said. "I
think my uncle did a good job
of instilling my poise and lead
ership in me, and 1 think that
one of the things he always
harped on was just being
poised and calm no matter
what was happening. Whether

some marks in the
win column. By any
means necessary,
whatever it takes."

it be in a game, or whether it be off the field, always be poised as a
quarterback. The thing is if you don't have things under control,
look like you have things under control."
On Tuesday, head coach Jim Harbaugh praised Pritchard's de
velopment in the short time he's been under center. Harbaugh
touted his quarterback's ability to understand the game quickly
and not force bad throws as the keys to his successes against USC
and TCU.
"1 was impressed [by Pritchard's play against the Horned
Frogs]," the first year coach said. "He really did a good job under
standing what we were doing, and you could see the improvement
from one game to the next. He took care of the football and made
plays when they were there to be made."
Pritchard, who lauded the tremendous team unity and cama
raderie he has found in the Stanford locker room, was adamant that
the key for the Cardinal would be to keep looking forward. For a
team still in the hunt for bowl-eligibility, that would seem to be
good advice indeed.
"We need to get some marks in the win column," he said. "By
any means necessary, whatever it takes. We're not worried about
stats at this point or anything like that — just wins."

whatever it takes."

it be in a game, or whether it be off the field, always be poised as a
quarterback. The thing is if you don't have things under control,
look like you have things under control."
On Tuesday, head coach Jim Harbaugh praised Pritchard's de
velopment in the short time he's been under center. Harbaugh
touted his quarterback's ability to understand the game quickly
and not force bad throws as the keys to his successes against USC
and TCU.
"1 was impressed [by Pritchard's play against the Horned
Frogs]," the first year coach said. "He really did a good job under
standing what we were doing, and you could see the improvement
from one game to the next. He took care of the football and made
plays when they were there to be made."
Pritchard, who lauded the tremendous team unity and cama
raderie he has found in the Stanford locker room, was adamant that
the key for the Cardinal would be to keep looking forward. For a
team still in the hunt for bowl-eligibility, that would seem to be
good advice indeed.
"We need to get some marks in the win column," he said. "By
any means necessary, whatever it takes. We're not worried about
stats at this point or anything like that — just wins."

Stanford quarterback Tavita Pritchard has taken charge of the Cardinal offense against USC and TCU, going 23-57 for 320 yards and three touchdowns in his first two
games as a starter. Pritchard credits the influence of his uncle, famed Washington State quarterback Jack Thompson, with helping him stay cool under pressure.
