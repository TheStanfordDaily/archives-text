# Tavita Pritchard
## Football Pritchard at the heart of turnaround hopes 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
Quarterback Tavita Pritchard has already played wit
ness to one of the biggest upsets in the history of col
lege football.
ually, ho did more than just witness it: the redshirt
sophomore guided the Cardinal to its 24-23 win over the
then-No. 2 USCTrojans in the L. A. Coliseum two weeks ago.
And last week against TCU, the Tacoma, Wash, native pro
pelled Stanford to one of its best offensive performances in
recent memory
But when asked about how he led the Stanford offense
and its herd of receivers to one of the biggest wins in program
history, Pritchard downplayed his own contributions to the
victory.

"lf anything, I'm the supporting cast," he said. "Those
guys, [Bradford, Sherman and Moore], they're obviously, all
three, very special."
And what's more, the newest Stanford starting quarter

And, it turns out, he was right.
"That's kind of one of those things where being a quarter
hack just kicks in," Pritchard said. "It probably wasn't really
a conscious thing, but you're in the heat of the game. I mean,

but it's one of those things where I was really looking at those
guys.
"Those are our seniors. Our receiver corps is very herald-

Ed, obviously one of the stronger parts of our team," he went
on. "Coming into the season we knew that. And I just told
them.'You guys are the seniors, you guys are going to have to
go make a play to win this game,' and that's what it came
down to."
But for Pritchard, the last-minute fade pass he lofted to
senior receiver Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal from the
10-yard line that proved the winning play in the monumental
upset was merely the start. For the new Cardinal signal-caller,
progress will he all about helping to author even more special
moments for Stanford before he's through.
"Hopefully, it gets better than that because I've got two
years left," he said. "That was a great game, obviously a huge
win for this program, but not necessarily what I want to be re
