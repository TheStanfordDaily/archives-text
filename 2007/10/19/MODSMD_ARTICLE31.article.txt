## Who's your daddy? Lindbergh... 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION POLYGRAPH PERJURER 
History is a strange beast. She is shaped like an armoire
but has the fangs of a tiger and a New Jersey accent. She
constantly hums "Hava Nagila," not because she is Jewish,
but because it is a very catchy song and she likes to ac
knowledge this. She feels only two emotions: anger and
gonzo. She can tell the difference between a male and a
female turtle blindfolded. But, most importantly, she re
fuses to talk to us, even when we tempt her with frozen
Clif bars and energy-efficient light bulbs. Still, we've done
some research on our own, and we're fairly confident that
we've uncovered the majority of her secrets, even without
chaining her to a post and flogging her with The Times
until she capitulated as we'd planned.
Did Atlantis exist?
No. Atlantis exists only in our cultural imagination as a
symbol of catastrophic failure, much like the tale of Icarus
or L. A.
Why did the Mayan civilization collapse?
Like so many early Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya even
tually lost the will to live after realizing that they would
never grow facial hair, instead continuing to helplessly
sprout fine, translucent down on their upper lip in a way
that is just visible enough to require occasional shaving
every other week or so (with the exception of a single mole
off to the left that is the source of darker, longer hairs and
demands more frequent attention) but is clearly not
enough to ever be the base of an actual full beard/mus
tache/sideburns combo, which is really all I've wanted since
pretty much the 4th grade.
Was William Shakespeare a real person?
No. The actual author of such works as "Hamlet" and
"Macbeth" was a group of one million chimpanzees locked
in a room.

What happened to Roanoke?

Diaries written in the colony's final

days reveal that spirits were

low ("wee are neere wea-

ried by Lonelie-ness")

after colonists realized
that "no boates would

comme from England."
F i -

nally despairing, the residents decided to "ende at laste our
Liues" by "endcauouring to counte to a Number most
undiscreetly high, there-by filling uppe our fayre and weake
skullcs." The plan was that, once the target number was
reached (identified in most sources as "Seuentie-three
teen"), the counter's head would be lightly poked with a
"pinne moste finely sharpened" and would hopefully
"burste, like an ouer-ripe melonne or the liuer of an Irish
manne." This strategy evidently failed, however, and the
colonists eventually switched to the more drastic measure
of kissing Indians.

What's the deal with daytime television?
I mean, really. Am I right? Am 1 right?

Who stole the Lindbergh baby?
Nobody. The Lindbergh baby was simply misplaced, one of
the nearsighted maids having mistaken the boy for a soup

ladle. Tragically, the Lind-

berghs never ate soup
("Soup?" Lindbergh would
famously say, waving his
hands wildly and flapping

his aviator cap about.
"Soup?"), and the family
gradually replaced their
child with virulent anti-

Semitism. Meanwhile, the
boy grew up as a utensil
■and was only discovered
years later after the house
was sold. Attempts to re-

habilitate him were large
ly successful, but social
workers were never able
to break his habit of
making clinking noises
when jostled or of sur-

reptitiously dipping his feet into nearby tureens.
What is JI) Salinger hiding from?
Thomas Pynchon.
What is Thomas Pynchon hiding from?
I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.
Is it a kind of fruit?
No, it is not a kind of fruit.
Is it an animal? Like a pig?
No. Please stop asking.
Is it dental hygiene?
Look — I really can't tell you.
It's dental hygiene, isn't it?
Yes. It is dental hygiene.
Did we really land on the moon?
Yes. But we weren't the first. A band of time-traveling mis
creants, led by a Col. Terrence Hatcher (played by Brad
Pitt) preempted the Apollo moon landing by mere weeks,
despite the valiant efforts of Special Agent Roscoe (played
by Tom Hanks) and his faithful sheepdog Becky.
Who shot Kennedy?
Lee Harvey Oswald. No, just joking. It was aliens.
What is in the Nixon tapes' 18 1/2 minutes of silence?

NIXON: It's more than a feeling.
11ALDEMAN: More than a feeling.
NIXON: When 1 hear that old song they used to play.
11 ALDEMAN: More than a feeling.
NIXON: And I begin dreaming.
IIALDEMAN: More than a feeling.
NIXON: Till 1 sec Marianne walk away— 1 see my Mari
anne walkin' away.
11 ALDEMAN: [Extended guitar solo.]
