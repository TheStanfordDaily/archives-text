## Excavating Stanford scandals 
### CARMEN SANDIEGO INTERMISSION GUMSHOE 
Everyone knows that Stanford has
more skeletons in its Mausoleum

than those of Leland, Jane and Ju
nior. Those who have been
around the Quad can tell you
about the murder in MemChu,
the Stanford Prison Experiment

and the fact that there's actually a

cactus garden somewhere on cam
pus. These stories have lived on,
but others have been forgotten —

that is, until now. Take a look at
some of the dustier secrets in Stan
ford's history.

1893: So much money, so little cash
When Leland Sr. died two years after
the University was founded, his es
tate was locked up in probate court.

Jane Stanford had to keep the University
running by paying out-of-pocket, which
only worked thanks to the ruling of a
friendly judge. The ruling, by the way,
functioned by allowing Mrs. Stanford to
claim the professors as her personal ser
vants. which they must have loved.

DR

innocent research studies;
who hasn't been tempted to
head over to the GSB for an
hour to get $20? (The deliv
ery dude from Pizza My
Heart doesn't pay himself.)
Of course, instead of filling
out surveys about his team
work skills, Kesey was try
ing out LSD and other psy
chedelic drugs in a study fi
nanced by the CIA. Kesey
arguably came out the win
ner — let's be honest, when
was the last time the CIA
wrote anything as good as
"One Flew Over the Cuck
oo's Nest?"
1965: Take that, techies
In the mid-'6os. The Daily
quoted Dean of Women Lu
cile Allen as saying that
some English professors at
tempted to seduce Stanford
women by focusing on the
erotic aspects of the subject

in class. Hot! Per-

haps a little too hot —

Allen later denied the state-

ment and then resigned, taking

7 O
an associate dean and an assistant
dean with her. The University stuck
with Allen's line that she'd never
claimed such things, but the commit-

tee's 16-page-report was never re-

leased.

19705: Good morning, Viet-

nam!

While our friendly ri
vals across the Bay get

all the attention in the

AP US History textbooks

for the craziness of the late '60s and

early '70s, Stanford had its share

of Vietdrama as well. Rocks

got thrown at Memorial

Church (evidently be
cause of its involvement

with the war), and a student
body president did three years

in jail for burning his draft card on campus.
In addition, the University cut ties fronfr
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI),
which had been created in 1946, because
the student body protested at SRl's prac

tice of accepting research funding from the
U.S. military. The idealistic student body
may or may not have realized that SRI was
profitable and would continue to be so —
in 2006. SRl's revenues were $411 million.
That's a lot of Stanford Fund letters.

The split may have hurt SRI as well, at
least at the start. In the '70s and '80s, SRI
started researching paranormal abilities
(also with funding from those goofballs
over at the CIA); two researchers were

convinced by Uri Gellar's spoon-

bending and other psychic

powers. Sure, Gellar has

been caught on film bend-

ing spoons with his

hands, but we'll give
him the benefit of the

doubt. It was probably
just his incredible

mental powers
using his hands to

bend the spoons.

1973: Guys,
and you
think dat
ing is rough
now...

After over 80

years of existence as a co-

J — —
educational school, Stanforcf final-

ly lifted the restriction on the number of

r fe
male

students

relative to male stu-

dents. Lifting the ban

was less a spontaneous act of gen-

der equality and more a complying-

i j — rv c
with-the-Supreme-Court kind of thing.

1985: Strength in numbers
Twenty-three psych students were caught
cheating on a final, which the Honor Code
definitely more than frowns upon. The
magnitude of the violation was large
enough that even The New York Times
picked up on the story. Good luck finding
a job after that one, kids.
1991: But I was researching this antique ar
moire!
University president Donald Kennedy re
signed after a scandal resulting from the
University overcharging the federal gov
ernment $231 million for "research" —
some of which went toward buying
Kennedy cedar closets and antiques.
There had also been problems in the facul
ty with drugs, plagiarism and sexual ha
rassment (Oh my!), so 11 years seemed
like enough for Kennedy.
