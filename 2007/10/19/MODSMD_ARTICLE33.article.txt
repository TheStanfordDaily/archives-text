## Portrait of the as-yet-unknown artist 
### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION OVER-EXPOSER 
As a photographer, 1 often sneer at so-called
"art" photography, a term which includes artists
ranging from Ansel Adams to Lee Friedlander. As
1 page through books the size of tables in an attempt
to ascertain the greatness of photography's most fa
bled artists, I wonder, sometimes out loud, why 1
should care about these images. Photos of buildings
and small children, mountains and leaves, can only
be so interesting for so long. Smoke stacks near
rivers polluted with pulp from a mill do not awe and
intrigue after you have seen them once. The world
does not need to be constantly documented and re
documented, with each new exposure adding small
variations to the well-established repertoire of con
temporary photography.
But some images concern themselves less with
composition and color than on the content of the
frame. The members of the New York School, the
most famous of whom are Robert Frank and
Richard Avedon, created an unknown world out of
the everyday in mid-century New York. The best of
the photographs, like the most talented members of
the group, create a new world through the lens, re
imagining and re-purposing streets into the sites of
cult rituals and the play of light on buildings into a
new architecture of the city. The style of the New
York School has been appropriated by many pho
tographers since. The New York School was the
genesis of contemporary American photography,
and the names Avedon and Frank should prove
that without argument.
Avedon set our expectations of what portrai
ture could, and ought, to be. His technically per
fect prints and straightforward, uncluttered style
made his portraits seem to come alive. People re
port feeling as though his photographs are staring
back at them, as though they might come out
from the emulsion and engage the viewer in con
versation. Avedon attempts to create an unbi
ased look at humans, allowing the viewer to peer

in and decide what the character of the subject re
ally is. But his photographs, like all images chosen
by the human eye, are as biased and dishonest as
the next, if not more so.
Placing ads to find people to represent a cer
tain class or a certain profession, Avedon selects
his subjects before offering them to the world as
the example of their type. His need to make a
final statement about the people he photographs
pushes me away from his glossy perfection and
into the arms of artists more willing to freely offer
the bias in their work, the autobiography inher
ent in all art.
American photographers in the past quarter
century have made quite a racket with making art
as autobiography, taking pictures of their friends
and using it as a means to examine their own
existence. Nan Goldin, who thanks Avedon
for his assistance with her first book, is the
American standard of this artistic self-reflec
tion, this maddening vanity and making it into
art. But her art is colored by the American ob
session with the "other."
Her photographs of her drug-addicted
friends and homosexual lovers remind us that
these have become meaningful because those
with influence perceive them to offer insight
into an interesting, "new world," as photogra
phy is expected to do.
A great artist, however, does not revel in the
appropriation of the marginalized as a means of
attaining mainstream success. Great portraits
present their subjects without judgment or pre
sumed cultural identity. He revels in the ambi
guity of the individual in the world and attempts
to allow us to make our own decisions.
The Japanese photographer Sakiko No
mura does just this. With each print, she un
ravels the identities that people take on to fit
into society and demonstrates the nakedness
below. Her photographs of naked men and
women seduce because of their inherent lack

of sexuality.
Often sensual and beautiful in their gritty im
precision, they make us feel less aroused than
compassionate. A man kneels naked, behind a
bed, with the light from a window illuminating his
skin, pale as the wall behind him. We can see the
shadowy world of his genitals without detail be
cause his sexual prowess is besides the point. In
this world where nudity is accepted, the sexual
becomes neutered by an emotional intimacy.
Her subjects do not perform, even when they
glance at the camera. They are simply struggling
to find comfort in the post-coital world of wrin
kled bedsheets and hot showers. And 1 want to
talk to them, genitals and all.
