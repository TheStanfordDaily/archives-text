# Post Secret Exposed
## POSTMASTER OF SECRETS SPILLS HIS OWN 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION POSTMAN 
INTERMISSION: How did your idea for PostSccrct originally comc about?

FRANK WARREN: I always felt like people had these rieh. imaginative lives that
they did not get to share. Everyone has some extraordinary stories. 1 wanted to cre-

ate a safe, non-judgmental place to express and share these desires and feelings and
hopes and fears so that it could be something special. When 1 started PostSecrct,

I was thrilled with the results. It seemed to have resonated with a lot of people.
We now have 1(X) million hits on the bloe. It's eratifvine for me to see that other

people in addition to me appreciate the humor, poetry and humanity revealed
in this project.

It's very inspirational that new kinds of technology can creatc the potential
for new kinds of conversation. Virtual communities arc forming — the

birth of Facchook. for example. Artists and entrepreneurs will have the
potential to creatc wonderful projects that can unite us and explore hu-

manity. Post Secret is just the first of many project? that will be exciting
for all of us to sec.

INT: How has Post Secret changed since it first started?

FW: When I started. I was inspired by Davy Rothbart. Readers would mail

him stuff they find. He has a lot of comments and editorials on his finds. I tried doing

that at first but understood the power and poignancy of Post Secret. the voiecs speaking

through the postcards. I dccidcd to eliminate everything except for the postcards. I contribute very
little to the site, and there are no advertisements. I develop a relationship with strangers, but I am
not going to judge it.
INT: What effect do you think the PostSecfet project has had on college students specifically? How
have college students responded to Post Secret?
FW: One might find a secret that hits close to home. When people make that connection, it can have
a deep emotional affect on someone. One realizes on an emotional level that everyone has his own
burden. Allows you to feel less alone, more connected.
INI": Is there a single one secret that has specifically affected you?
FW: One I posted last week: "I go to spinning class..." Just kidding. I like the secrets that arc funny
and hopeful. There was one written on a Starbucks cup — "I give decaf to customers who arc rude
to me." Along with the humorous, I like the haunting. One about the Twin Towers — "Everyone
who knew me before 9-11 believes lam dead." It opens up a whole world — imagine the story be
hind it. Perhaps we bumped into that person today.
INT: How often do people contact you asking if a certain secret was sent in by someone they know?
And how often do you tell them?
FW: I always protect everybody's identities. Sometimes I am bombarded with 20-30 emails — they
all think they know who mailed it in. It makes our lives more interesting to imagine it could have
been someone we knew.
INT: What do you think is the direction of Post Secret? Do you think it is going to grow into some
thing larger?
FW: I don't know. I don't try and lead the project, but be sensitive to it. I have been trusting the
journey so far. It's been leading me on an amazing adventure, [and I] continue to trust it to lead me.
It would be interesting to explore other ways of storytelling. Film, movies — there's been some dis
cussion about that. We're still in discussion about a documentary.

INT: If everyone were to send in their secrets, how
would socicty be different?

FW: In two or three more weeks — we will have exehausted all the secrets in the
world. [Laughs]

All of us have too many secrets. Some secrets arc best not to tell other people about.
INT: The larger media has ccrtainly picked up on this PostSecrct phenomenon. What is the atti
tude of mainstcam outlets to PostSecrct?
FW: You understand what it is. so it's hard to think about what it was like when new. The idea is
pretty novel, and there's many ways to approach it. Some may think it's about pornography, crimes,
self-indulgence, narcissism. You need to see the postcards to understand the project. Then, they
have a connection to it. It's human-affirming, poignant. It's art, as well as humor, poetry, drama.
INT: You have a lot of holiday-specific weeks, for days like Valentine's and Christmas. How arc
those different?
FW: Depending on the cards I show on the website, they will act as model for the cards submitted
in the next week. Holiday-themcd postings will lead to more holiday secrets. Secrets are more than
individual voiccs. but a conversation. Like with the new book, I tried to arrange the secrets in loose
age order. It shows the fascinating way our secrets changc as wc move through our lives. But also,
surprisingly, how they stay the same.
INT: What is the selection criteria for choosing the cards to publish?
FW: Cards that really speak to me. or arc surprising. One that everyone can relate to in a new way.
Relate to every part of our emotions — funny, shocking, hopeful, sexual. I try to arrange

them in a way that is connccted. I am trying to be a storyteller by telling a story about

our secrets.

There arc two kinds of secrcts — ones that we keep from oth-

ers, ones that wc hide from ourselves. We can find the

opportunity to find secrets we arc hiding from

ourselves.
