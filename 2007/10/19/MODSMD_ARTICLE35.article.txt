## You'll go far for Shalimar 
### TIM GARIBALDI INTERMISSION EDIBLE ETHNOGRAPHER 
In my search for that well-kept culinary secret — a gastronomic experience beyond
the tried and true eateries of downtown Palo Alto or even California Ave. — I have
trekked the road less traveled. This uncharted road, my friends, is none other than our
beloved El Camino.
"But Tim." you say, "You must be kidding? We know all about the El Camino dining
scene. Why, 1 was just at Jack-In-The-Box last night!"
No, companion, I'm talking beyond Jack-In-The-Box, past Taco Bell — hell, even
further than Target and Wal-Mart. Sometimes, in search of that special meal, one must
travel into the unknown wilderness. What could possibly draw the weary college student
so far afield? One word:
Shalimar.
The word comes from an ancient South Asian language and, though some subtlety is
lost in translation, is roughly equivalent to the English phrase "Good-Ass Pakistani
Food." Ask any Pakistani worth his weight in mango chutney where to go for the best ke
babs or curries around, and I bet you 100 rupees he'll heartily proclaim the name of that
Mecca of South Asian food, "Shalimar!"
Located just 15 minutes by car south of our cozy bubble (sorry freshmen, got to
pass that IHUM exam so that maybe one day you too can have a car on campus), in
the city of Sunnyvale, lies this jewel in the crown of Silicon Valley dining. Snuggled
between a car dealership and a gas station on the corner of S. Bernardo and El
Camino, this old refurbished IHOP has become synonymous with Pakistani Cuisine.
Pakistani food is known for its spicy flavors and juicy meats, and Shalimar does not
disappoint. Walking into the bright yellow dining room, my friends and I ordered our
food at the counter from the helpful cashier. "Kebabs are a must," he informed me,
"and white people like Chicken Tikka Masala." Hey, I'm white! Sounds great!
After adding a few unpronounceable dishes to the order, we grabbed bottles of differ
ent sauces from the nearby condiments fridge and wound our way past tables of sari-clad

women and bearded men to a table next to an old black-and-white Bollywood poster.
As soon as the food arrived, we dug in. The beef kebabs were spiced and juicy.
The chicken biryani (spiced rice with meat and some veggies) was cooked to perfec
tion with moist chunks of chicken and a slight kick at the end to make things inter
esting. Chicken Tikka Masala, a dish of chunked chicken breast in a creamy spicy
tomato sauce, melted in our mouths, and, true to the cashier's word, was well re
ceived by even the palest of the group. The final dish, Bhuna Gosht, made of lamb
in a spicy dark gravy, rounded out the meal with a heavy spice that made the pitch
ers of water quite necessary.
For the more adventurous, the house special of Goat Brain Masala received rave re
views from nearby fellow patrons, though our order must have gotten lost somewhere in
the kitchen. And, thankfully, there's no real need for a fork and knife. Naan bread is pret
ty cheap ($1 per round, though admittedly a few pieces were dry and overcooked), so
why not use your hands?
For dessert, we had Gulab Jaman, warm doughnutty things in a sugar syrup, and Ba
narsi Kheer — think rice pudding with some unique flavors. They were all quite good
(especially the doughnuts), though maybe a bit odd to the Western palate at first. All in
all, a meal fit for a sultan, and the sultan enjoyed it, I assure you.
With their no-frills take on dining and family-style dishes, Shalimar is a perfect place
to go with large crowds. But with heavy dishes full of spicy gravies and good ol' fashioned
greasy curries just like mom used to make (err, someone's mom atieast), this is probably
not the most romantic place to take a date.
Shalimar is also not the best place to go before any physical activity; the heavy, rich
sauces are sure to put you in the mood for an incredibly satisfying nap. It is, however,
great for the college budget. Our group of five hungry college students was able to eat its
fill of food, drinks, bread and dessert for only $8 per person.
But be warned that Shalimar takes cash only, so any attempts to put it on your emer
gencies-only parental credit card won't get you much (though the in-house ATM makes
things convenient). For speedy service, great ethnic food, cheap prices and a casual at
mosphere, Shalimar is the only place for me and should be for you, too.
