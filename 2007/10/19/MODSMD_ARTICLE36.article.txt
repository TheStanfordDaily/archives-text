# Boredat Stanford? This site won't help.
## 
### SAMANTHA LASAROW INTERMISSION CYBER SLEUTH 
You know all of the Internet's biggest se
crets. You blast your Tay Zonday You Tube
videos and crack your Chuck Norris jokes.
But all the main attractions of the blogos
phere have got you in a funk: After you click
around Digg until your mouse squeaks in
fury, you eventually discover that even the
craziest bloggers don't post enough content
to keep your little Stanford brain abuzz. And
if another "00p5!...1 Did It Again" joke
crosses your path on PerezHilton.com,
You Tube is going to have a new "Angry
German Kid" in town — and, this time, the
video won't be faked. You begin to wish that
you could stay within the Stanford Bubble,
even online.
This is where it pays to be a Stanford stu
dent (as opposed to the ever-so-common
converse of this statement). You have some
amazing gossip sites right at your weary 100
wpm fingertips. Ever hear of Stanford's fa
vorite forum. Boredatstanford.net? Accord

ing to Boredat's FAQ. popular demand war
ranted that they change their domain name
from Boredatgreen to Boredatstanford be
cause "Face it, you can be bored anywhere."
Boredat is the perfect environment for all
of us who feel that Stanford just doesn't offer
enough engaging classes, sports teams, social
activities and organizations to keep us enter
tained. Forget trying to master the Soulja
Boy dance; it's time to read real-life confes
sions from real-life Stanford students: "I
watch porn on my Ti-89 titanium during
math 51." posts an anonymous classmate.
Crank Dat porn, you amazing technological
wizard.
On the "mainspace," you can browse
through all topic threads and take a taste.
Wonderful nuggets of information are avail
able here: "if you want a blowjob come to the
west stacks sth floor, i have a tongue ring." or
"I want to bang azia's kimchec" are just a
small sampling of the tempting tidbits that
await you.
One anonymous student posted, "you

know, i peed on one of the couches in bender
one time, i bet one of you is sitting on it right
now." OK, I'll make sure to never sit again,
thanks. Another student posts, "i need to
pee but i'm afraid i'll lose my space at
Meyer." I'd watch out — those seats might
be peed on too. Lastly, if you're a fan of the
Plain White T's, saran-wrap your room —
someone's out to get you. He typed with
rage, "if one of my neighbors plays that fuck
ing delilah song one tnore time i'm going to
pee on their door." And there are plenty of
others who will be right in line behind him.
Thank goodness for Boredat for that tip,
right?
Another space, "late night," can help you
satisfy your carnal desires or just lower your
Purity Test score. This space is a great place
to advertise yourself or proposition others.
Be warned, though — intense arguments
can arise. Take a spat between Angry Blog
ger and Kappa Girl for instance (aliases cre
ated for convenience). After reading "any
one want to hook up with a lonely kappa

girl?" Angry Blogger typed furiously. "I'm
curious as to why a kappa girl who wants
some action would resort to boredatstanford
to find it." But this irked Kappa Girl (or a co
hort of hers), and she retorted, "wtf you talk
ing about boredatstanford is the best place to
hook up." It certainly is a popular hook-up
spot, with such posts as "I really want to
make out and cuddle with a cute boy
tonight...any takers?" and "what's a girl
gotta do to get a foot rub around here?" lit
tering the late night space.
Take it from the experts — Boredat is a
great place to make confessions, warn peo
ple about excessive peeing or find someone
who's actually willing to have sex with you.
So now you know — if you find yourself
bored at Green, or bored in lecture, or bored
online, you should stop trying to memorize
all the lyrics to Kelly's "Shoes" video, and
start hopping on the Stanford forums.
Maybe Anonymous will eventually share
with us how we can get porn on our Ti-89 cal
culators.
