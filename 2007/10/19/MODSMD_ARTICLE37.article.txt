## United Nations Association Film Festival 
### KARMIA CAO INTERMISSION WITNESS 
"Our greatest enemy is ignorance," Bojic said. "These
documentaries and images are our weapons, our bridges
between nations and the tables over which we bond as
human beings."
Ten years ago, Professor Jasmina Bojic was the cata
lyst for the first ever United Nations Association Film
Festival (UNAFF), the brainchild of the United Nations
Association and the Stanford Film Society. UNAFF is
nbt a part of the UN, but it does support UN causes. With
the mission to "celebrate the power of films dealing with
human rights, environmental survival, women's issues,
protection of refugees, hftmelessness, racism, disease
control, universal education, war and peace," UNAFF is
now recognized as the most important documentary film
festival in the world.
After a meticulous screening of over 360 submissions
last June, the screens of Stanford's Cubberley and Annen
burg will be illuminated with 32 documentaries, taking us to
35 countries, from Afghanistan to Zambia, beginning
Wednesday, Oct. 24. The five-day event will also serve as
the foremost global forum for filmmakers and activists to
converse among themselves and with the audience: how can
cameras act as witnesses and bring attention to real issues,
send help to real people?
"We bear Stanford's name when we take this festival
on the road," Bojic stated. "The response in Harvard Uni
versity, our last stop, was phenomenal. We need our own
students to support these causes by coming out to see these
films. It is well worth their time." The Traveling Festival
has taken documentaries to as far as New York and as
close as Berkeley, living out the purpose of opening eyes.
Austin Zumbro '09 previewed several short documen
taries and remarked, "A lot of people come to documen
taries with reservations and resentment because the films
are 'preachy.' But from what I've seen, UNAFF is any
thing but that. There is such a true diversity in these films,

and the message is urgent."
"The images stayed with me days after," said Ivan Lee
*09, after previewing "War/Dance." "The unbelievable
cinematography was appropriate for such a heavy topic, if
anything can be appropriate for such tragedies. 1 will not
forget."
"It was definitely a stretching exercise in perspective,"
said Samantha Larson '11, "and we need it more than ever
before."
"Because it is not a commercial event, UNAFF is free
from the prevalent sensationalism in current media,"
Bojic said. "We cover more, we go deeper to the roots of
our global issues." And, truly, previewing these documen
taries has been the highlight of my new Stanford career
thus far. I found myself looking into the eyes of Brian Stei
dle. the man who proved the Darfur atrocities to the world
in "The Devil Came on Horseback."
"We had said never again to Rwanda and all the geno
cides before, yet 1 am here again, saying never again,
please never ever again," Steidle cried in the Washington
demonstration.
I saw villages go up in smoke and heard the cries of peo
ple within. I looked into the eyes of Dominic, Rose and
Nancy, three children from the war zone in Northern
Uganda, ex-child soldier and orphans in "War/Dance." I
watched "Holy Warriors," the struggle of six Russian ex
soldiers as they become priests, mothers and civilians
again. I can testify to the life-changing power of these doc
umentaries â€” you will meet eyes you cannot forget, eyes
that will show you truth and reveal to you your own hu
manity.
This year's theme, "Cameras as Witnesses," embraces
what UNAFF has done for the past decade, building
bridges for dialogue between nations and people. Come
and travel, come and see, come and be moved.
