## Camouflage your facial flaws 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION COVERGIRL 
Most days you don't need to look air
brushed or magazine-cover-model beautiful.
Most days you're just fine rolling out of bed,
pulling your hair into a ponytail, throwing on
some sweats and biking to your morning class.
Most days.
And then some days you wake up with a zit
the size and vibrancy of a fresh pepperoni,
smack dab in the middle of your forehead.
And your morning class is Engineering 1000,
which you must go to, as the only component
of your grade is your final which is based sole

ly on material from lectures which, conve
niently, are not available on Course Work.
And you have it with a hot guy.
What are you to do?! Well, you're going go
to class, that's for damn sure. And you're
going to look good. That Mount Vesuvius of a
pimple you just woke up with...Zit? What zit?
How to Cover a Monster ZH
Step One: Washing
Before doing any dirty business, wash your
hands and face.
Step Two: Identification and Preparation

Zits fall into two categories:
Red with white goo and red with

no white goo. If your zit is red with
no goo, apply some crushed aspirin

or Visine to it with a cotton swab to
hide redness. If your zit is red with goo,

especially if it's red with a lot of goo, pop
it. First, apply a warm washcloth to open

up the pores. Then, using the pads of your
fingers and a tissue, gently apply pressure
around the base until the goo comes oul

Afterwards, apply a cold washcloth to soothe
and close up the pore. In both cases, moistur
ize your entire face, avoiding your zit, then
dab a very small amount of moisturizer direct
ly onto the zit.
Step Three: The Great Cover-Up
Use a thick concealer and apply with a flat
brush, sponge or pad of your index finger. Fol
low with liquid foundation and apply with a
sponge or the pad of your ring finger. Allow to
dry before following with a green- or yellow
based powder. Green helps neutralize the
redness in the zit. The powder will help set the
concealer and foundation but also absorb oil.
Bring the powder with you for touch-ups
throughout the day.

If only zits were the only cosmetic mishap

you had to worry about. Ever stay up till 5
a.m. writing a 10-page paper, wake up for
class three hours later, look in the mirror
and think, "What the hell happened to my
eyes?!" Puffy eyes? Under-eye circles?
Telltale signs of a late night (or early morn
ing). Ah, no more.
How to Cover Puffy Eyes and Under-Eye
Circles
Step One: Wash your hands and face.
Step Two: Preparation
Tame puffy eyes with a pair of green
tea bags soaked in hot water (make sure to
cool them first!). Slices of cucumbers or
potatoes will also work. If you don't have
these things handy, an ice pack or a pair of
cold spoons will do just fine. Apply to eyes
for 10 minutes — more or less depending
on the degree of puffiness.
Step Three: The Great Cover-Up
Use a yellow-based concealer and
apply with a sponge or your ring finger.
The yellow will help neutralize purple
under-eye circles. Follow with a thin layer
of liquid foundation and apply with a
sponge or your ring finger (so you don't use
too much pressure). Set with powder. Re
member to keep your layers light — other
wise you'll come out looking cakey and
Pam Anderson-ish.
Oil-clogged pores erupt in a giant
red monstrosity? Eyes weary from a long
night of studying? With these tips, it'll just
be our little secret.
