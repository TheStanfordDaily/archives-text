## Rock Under Wraps 
### PAUL CRAFT_ INTERMISSION KZSU UNDERGROUND MAN 
Here's a little secret: good music exists outside of the Bill
board Hot 100. Happily, most Stanford students already seem
privy to this secret. But a shockingly large percentage of peo
ple still seem to be in the dark. Party DJs seem to be particu
larly ignorant of the excellent music outside of the corporate
mainstream. 1 mean, how often do they have to play Fergie in
order to realize that she has a formula: tough-but-vulnerable
street attitude, "sexy'Vdisturbing metaphors (no. really —
what is her London Bridge? 1 still don't get it...) and mis
spelling easy words ("t to the a to s-t-e-y...girl, you tasty"). But
the parade of terribleness doesn't stop at Fergie.
Guess whose album is number one on the Billboard charts
this week? No, not High School Musical 2 — even worse. No,
it's not even the waking dream of nostalgia known as Bruce
Springsteen. Kid Rock's album "Rock and Roll Jesus" is in the
top spot. What is this. 1998? I thought this mediocre rock-rap
per went out of style along with dial-up internet access, TRL
and Creed. He's still around? Have people really been missing
his potent mixture of power-chords, meaningless lyrics and
campy preening for the past nine years? Personally. 1 was hop
ing that "American Badass" would be his epically bad swan
song. But, alas, the American people have spoken with their
wallets.
So where does that leave you — the few, the proud, the
music fans of discriminating taste? That leaves you to fend for
yourself in the wilds of non-corporate or "independent"
music. Independent music, of course, includes just about every
genre from tropicalia to math rock to chamber pop. I have a
few suggestions of where to start within the rock and rap gen
res. VV'

The Radio Dept.: This
indie pop Swedish band is crimi
nally underrated. Their wispy,
love-soaked pop is not always on
target —it can, at times, bog
down in a sort of while drone.
But The Radio Dept.'s 2003
album "Lesser Matters" is
unadulterated genius. It is essen-

tially a concept album threading a narrative about the lead
singers' adolescent relationship. Channeling all the confusion,
euphoria and melancholy of growing up into the album. The
Radio Dept. produces a vaguely twee-like collection of art
pop songs. The opening track, for instance, is a short, ambient
piece with swelling strings and tender synthesizer. Then the
lead singer croons with a sense of resigned melancholy, "You
will have us figured out soon/ Too soon/ You'll have to leave/
For a new love/ A new love somewhere else/ But stick around
as long as you like/ We will be here/ Spend some time in the
sun." Starting with this scene of ambivalence and tenderness,
"Lesser Matters" then paints a rhythmic narrative of first
meeting, parental disapproval, simple moments of happiness
and ultimately the sadness that comes with growing up.

The DoDo's: This is a San Francis
co band that has played on campus
at least twice in the past year. Their
last appearance was this month with
Akron/Family, compliments of
Stanford Concert Network and
KZSU. The DoDo's live show is
stunning. Guitarist and singer
Meric Long pours passion into
every refrain and furiously erects

walls of melodic reverb with his guitar. Meanwhile, drummer
Logan Kroeber churns out crisp, impeccably-timed beats that
anchor the songs. Combined, this amounts to a jangly acoustic
stampede imbued with a very unique presence. Often a small
er band will write just good parts — a good verse, a good riff, a
good beat — but will also include some unfortunate missteps.
The DoDo's have no such missteps yet in their small catalog.
Every choice of melody, every choice of rhythm, just feels
light. They stand head and shoulders above the usual over
emotive local singer-songwriter. Check out their songs "Men"
and"The Ball."

Tokyo Police Club — This band
is, without a doubt, a personal fa
vorite of mine. TPC is a boisterous,
exhilarating fever dream of adoles
cent idealism and catchy bass riffs.
Take, for instance, the song "Cheer
It On." The Toronto foursome

opens
with a
cym-

bal-laden drumbeat as the lead
singer yells, "Operator, get me the

president of the world! This is an emergency!" Then the song
launches into a noodly, high-pitched riff, culminating in a glo
rious ascending synth riff and thfe main couplet. "And you're
standing next to me/ It's Tokyo Police Club." That's right —
their chorus is the band name! Finally, after about two minutes
of pure adrenaline, it's all over. The band manages to combine
a. breezily confident humorous tone with real musical chops.
Being in their early 20s, the members of Tokyo Police Club
come across as your zany, hilarious friends that skipped col
lege to start a band. Songs like "Nature o£ the Experiment" pin
a taut bass to ramshackle drumming to the restrained, nearly
spoken singing of David Monks. If you enjoy the youthful en
ergy of the Arctic Monkeys and/or the melodies of The
Strokes, you've got to hear this band.

Battle — What if Bloc Party
never became woefully earnest and
annoyingly self-righteous? Well,
they'd probably sound like Battle.
A London band with a honed sense
of the epic. Battle is indeed eerily
similar to Bloc Party, Mystery Jets
and pretty much every band from
England since 2003. But Battle
stand due to their sheer musical

strength. They embody everything good about the NME Maga
zine scene: the riffs roll and squeal with echo, the lyrics cry out
with a Bono-like urgency and the rhythm drives it all onward like
New Order. If, like me. you're nostalgic for "Silent Alarm" then
check out their songs "The Longest Time" and "Tendency."

The Klaxon's — OK, so maybe
this band isn't exactly under the
radar. They just won British rock's
top honor, The Mercury Prize. But
that's in Britain; my guess is that
very few Americans have really
delved into the trip neon world of
The Klaxons. Dubbed as "new
rave" (what a cleverly lazy turn of
phrase!), The Klaxons first made

waves by firmly aligning themselves with the late-'Bos rave
scene. Their image emphasized dance music, psychedelic
drugs, campy futuristic themes and glow sticks. But the music
on their debut album "Myths of the Near Future" only margin
ally incorporates actual rave music. Instead, their music is
quality British guitar rock a la The Smiths and others. The
stand-out track is "Golden Skans." Built around an insistent,
high-register vocal hook, piano and bass, the song zooms

through a spacious funk wonderland. In
the verse, the piano and bass play off
each other to create a series of empty
spaces and pauses that foster tension
and dancability. While the rest of the
album can't quite touch the highs of this
vocal show, any fan of danccablc music
will be pleased.
So, in summary, go to Best Buy
and return your Kid Rock CD. I don't
care how cool his goatee is — anybody
who features Gary Coleman in his terri
ble music video and does a sappy coun
ty duet with Sheryl Crow does not de
serve your money. He deserves your
scorn. On the other hand, a myriad of
excellent bands and secret joys is just
waiting to be discovered in the world of
independent rock.

music fans of discriminating taste? That leaves you to fend for
yourself in the wilds of non-corporate or "independent"
music. Independent music, of course, includes just about every
genre from tropicalia to math rock to chamber pop. I have a
few suggestions of where to start within the rock and rap gen
res. VV'

The Radio Dept.: This
indie pop Swedish band is crimi
nally underrated. Their wispy,
love-soaked pop is not always on
target —it can, at times, bog
down in a sort of while drone.
But The Radio Dept.'s 2003
album "Lesser Matters" is
unadulterated genius. It is essen-

tially a concept album threading a narrative about the lead
singers' adolescent relationship. Channeling all the confusion,
euphoria and melancholy of growing up into the album. The
Radio Dept. produces a vaguely twee-like collection of art
pop songs. The opening track, for instance, is a short, ambient
piece with swelling strings and tender synthesizer. Then the
lead singer croons with a sense of resigned melancholy, "You
will have us figured out soon/ Too soon/ You'll have to leave/
For a new love/ A new love somewhere else/ But stick around
as long as you like/ We will be here/ Spend some time in the
sun." Starting with this scene of ambivalence and tenderness,
"Lesser Matters" then paints a rhythmic narrative of first
meeting, parental disapproval, simple moments of happiness
and ultimately the sadness that comes with growing up.

The DoDo's: This is a San Francis
co band that has played on campus
at least twice in the past year. Their
last appearance was this month with
Akron/Family, compliments of
Stanford Concert Network and
KZSU. The DoDo's live show is
stunning. Guitarist and singer
Meric Long pours passion into
every refrain and furiously erects

walls of melodic reverb with his guitar. Meanwhile, drummer
Logan Kroeber churns out crisp, impeccably-timed beats that
anchor the songs. Combined, this amounts to a jangly acoustic
stampede imbued with a very unique presence. Often a small
er band will write just good parts — a good verse, a good riff, a
good beat — but will also include some unfortunate missteps.
The DoDo's have no such missteps yet in their small catalog.
Every choice of melody, every choice of rhythm, just feels
light. They stand head and shoulders above the usual over
emotive local singer-songwriter. Check out their songs "Men"
and"The Ball."

Tokyo Police Club — This band
is, without a doubt, a personal fa
vorite of mine. TPC is a boisterous,
exhilarating fever dream of adoles
cent idealism and catchy bass riffs.
Take, for instance, the song "Cheer
It On." The Toronto foursome

opens
with a
cym-

bal-laden drumbeat as the lead
singer yells, "Operator, get me the

president of the world! This is an emergency!" Then the song
launches into a noodly, high-pitched riff, culminating in a glo
rious ascending synth riff and thfe main couplet. "And you're
standing next to me/ It's Tokyo Police Club." That's right —
their chorus is the band name! Finally, after about two minutes
of pure adrenaline, it's all over. The band manages to combine
a. breezily confident humorous tone with real musical chops.
Being in their early 20s, the members of Tokyo Police Club
come across as your zany, hilarious friends that skipped col
lege to start a band. Songs like "Nature o£ the Experiment" pin
a taut bass to ramshackle drumming to the restrained, nearly
spoken singing of David Monks. If you enjoy the youthful en
ergy of the Arctic Monkeys and/or the melodies of The
Strokes, you've got to hear this band.

Battle — What if Bloc Party
never became woefully earnest and
annoyingly self-righteous? Well,
they'd probably sound like Battle.
A London band with a honed sense
of the epic. Battle is indeed eerily
similar to Bloc Party, Mystery Jets
and pretty much every band from
England since 2003. But Battle
stand due to their sheer musical

strength. They embody everything good about the NME Maga
zine scene: the riffs roll and squeal with echo, the lyrics cry out
with a Bono-like urgency and the rhythm drives it all onward like
New Order. If, like me. you're nostalgic for "Silent Alarm" then
check out their songs "The Longest Time" and "Tendency."

The Klaxon's — OK, so maybe
this band isn't exactly under the
radar. They just won British rock's
top honor, The Mercury Prize. But
that's in Britain; my guess is that
very few Americans have really
delved into the trip neon world of
The Klaxons. Dubbed as "new
rave" (what a cleverly lazy turn of
phrase!), The Klaxons first made

waves by firmly aligning themselves with the late-'Bos rave
scene. Their image emphasized dance music, psychedelic
drugs, campy futuristic themes and glow sticks. But the music
on their debut album "Myths of the Near Future" only margin
ally incorporates actual rave music. Instead, their music is
quality British guitar rock a la The Smiths and others. The
stand-out track is "Golden Skans." Built around an insistent,
high-register vocal hook, piano and bass, the song zooms

through a spacious funk wonderland. In
the verse, the piano and bass play off
each other to create a series of empty
spaces and pauses that foster tension
and dancability. While the rest of the
album can't quite touch the highs of this
vocal show, any fan of danccablc music
will be pleased.
So, in summary, go to Best Buy
and return your Kid Rock CD. I don't
care how cool his goatee is — anybody
who features Gary Coleman in his terri
ble music video and does a sappy coun
ty duet with Sheryl Crow does not de
serve your money. He deserves your
scorn. On the other hand, a myriad of
excellent bands and secret joys is just
waiting to be discovered in the world of
independent rock.





Here's a little secret: good music exists outside of the Bill
board Hot 100. Happily, most Stanford students already seem
privy to this secret. But a shockingly large percentage of peo
ple still seem to be in the dark. Party DJs seem to be particu
larly ignorant of the excellent music outside of the corporate
mainstream. 1 mean, how often do they have to play Fergie in
order to realize that she has a formula: tough-but-vulnerable
street attitude, "sexy'Vdisturbing metaphors (no. really —
what is her London Bridge? 1 still don't get it...) and mis
spelling easy words ("t to the a to s-t-e-y...girl, you tasty"). But
the parade of terribleness doesn't stop at Fergie.
Guess whose album is number one on the Billboard charts
this week? No, not High School Musical 2 — even worse. No,
it's not even the waking dream of nostalgia known as Bruce
Springsteen. Kid Rock's album "Rock and Roll Jesus" is in the
top spot. What is this. 1998? I thought this mediocre rock-rap
per went out of style along with dial-up internet access, TRL
and Creed. He's still around? Have people really been missing
his potent mixture of power-chords, meaningless lyrics and
campy preening for the past nine years? Personally. 1 was hop
ing that "American Badass" would be his epically bad swan
song. But, alas, the American people have spoken with their
wallets.
