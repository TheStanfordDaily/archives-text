## Brook Lopez suspended indefinitely 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore forward Brook Lopez has been suspended
indefinitely by men's basketball coach Trent Johnson, the
team announced Thursday following an online exclusive
by The Daily.
Lopez — who was already scheduled to miss the Cardi
nal's first nine games after being declared academically in
eligible earlier this month — will no longer practice with
the team. His twin brother Robin was also placed on pro
bation, but will continue training and team activities.
Coach Johnson announced the suspension at a team

meeting Wednesday night.
According to a press release issued by the University
Thursday evening, Lopez was suspended for "a violation of
team rules." Sources declined to elaborate on the reasons
behind the suspension and probation on the record. John
son made it clear, however, that he was not pleased with the
seven-footer's behavior.
"First of all, he has to attend class and make practice.
Show a consistency — go to class, make practice," Johnson
told the San Jose Mercury News. "It's pretty simple. I've
said it all along. Brook has a chance to be special. But the
bottom line is you've got to go to class, study vigorously and
you get to participate."

Classmates of the twins said that the two had not been
seen in class earlier this week.
After being ruled ineligible on Oct. 5, Brook Lopez had
continued practicing with the team. The Cardinal hoped
the seven-footer, who averaged 12.6 points, 6.0 rebounds
and 1.7 blocks last season, would return in mid-December,
provided that he met academic requirements. Now, the in
definite suspension raises the question of how many more
games he may miss, given that he is no longer practicing or
participating in team activities.
Considered by many scouts to be a likely top-10 pick in
the 20()7 NBA draft, Lopez instead
announced in March that he would
return for his sophomore season. But
he failed to complete spring quarter
with the necessary 36 units and 1.8
GPA to be eligible by NCAA stan
dards.
"Unfortunately I have failed to
live up to academic requirements
and I take full responsibility for what
has happened," Lopez said earlier
this month."l regret letting down the
team, the University and everyone
who supports me. I promise to work
hard to improve my academic stand
ing and look forward to being back
on the floor to help my team."
Johnson, too, had expressed opti
mism that the sophomore would be
heading back on the right track fol
lowing the ineligibility ruling.
"This is a disappointment for all
of us, including Brook," Johnson
said. "At the same time, we feel this
could be a positive learning experi
ence for him."
This news was the latest in a series
of setbacks for Stanford this month.
After Lopez was declared ineligible
two weeks ago, the Cardinal learned
this weekend that highly-touted cen
ter recruit John Brandenburg would
be headed instead to the University
of Virginia.
Aside from the now-suspended
Lopez, the Cardinal returns all five
starters from last year's squad, which
finished with an 18-13 record (10-8
Pac-10) before bowing out to
Louisville in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament.The team opens
the 2007-2008 season with a home
exhibition game against Concordia
on Nov. 5.
