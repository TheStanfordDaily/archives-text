## Roxy Sass kisses and tells all 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION HOT LIPS 
Intermission's secret-thcmcd issue is right up
Roxy's ally — you'll never know if The Sass sits next
to you in lecture or lives across the ha11...0f course, I
can't reveal that little secret, but I can tell you ahout
another particularly shocking tidbit from my past.
Try this on lor size (and girth): Roxy used to be ter
rified of kissing.
I had braces in middle school. And rubber bands.
And headgear. Had vou seen the machinery on my

face, vou would have un

derstood. Fortunately

when the braces came

off, Roxv smooched

far and wide to make
up for lost time.

r
Yes, I know.
Kissing is a bit tame of a

topic for The Sass to

cover, but with

FMOTQ on the

docket, I've de

cided to replace

titillation with

utility. Just in

time for Stan

ford's most awe

some tradition, I've

compiled a list de-

scribing my per

sonal best of the

best. But first,
the painfully re
membered rest
(pay close atten
tion — the perpe
trators never
i seemed to know
how bad their

kissinu was):

The llula
llooper— Mv mouth
was his hula-hoop; his
tongue was the hula
dancer. It was as unfor

tunate as the imagery
suggests. It involved

CC - - —
the same motion as

when greasy men wear-

ing chains wag their

tongues at me in the street

But it happened inside my
mouth. Unforgettable and un-

forgivable.
The Plumber — If my mouth

had been clogged, it would have
been a match made in heaven. The

man could form a perfect seal. Perhaps

the vast vacuum of space rivals The Plumber's

power, but at least there my head would have ex-

ploded within four seconds, thereby saving me from
further misery.
The Dentist — No molar remained unmolested.
She would poke, prod, tap and massage each tooth
with the utmost concentration and care. I felt like
asking for a goodie bag with free floss at the end. She
also shattered my illusion that women are naturally
superior to men when it comes to smooching.
The Repeat Offender — The first smooch wasn't
so bad. The second had me worried. By kiss three, I
was ready to lock him up for life. Every kiss was the
same. I ean to the left. Focus on the top lip. Then the
bottom lip. Open the mouth, bring in the tongue,and
slow count 1.2,3 before pulling back to stare at me.
Ugh. And it happened in a sailboat-bed. In the
Netherlands. The rest of the storv is for another day.
The Mouth Rapist — No. this is not too strong a
term. He raped my mouth. Kissing him involved
more aggressive thrusting than a roomful of sixth
graders at a boy-girl party.
The Best:
The Mime — He asked me to show him how 1
wanted to be kissed. And then he copied me. Per
fectly. I may have gotten bored by his routine over
time, but for those two hours on the Stanford golf
course, he kept my rapt attention.
The Handler — A good kiss can center on the
mouth. But The I landler belongs among the greats
for his simultaneous outstanding attention else
where. He never just kissed. It was always a smooch
and playing with my hair or touching the inside of my

elbow or stroking the back of my neck or something
else completely wonderful. It may seem elementary,
but I've had my vast share of handless smoochers.
And men. a quick note: immediately going for the
chest is often just as unfulfilling for us as it would be
for you. For my plan-seeking, virgin econ majors. 1
suggest the NET approach: nape, ears, throat. You'll
be home free. Or at least standing high at second
base.
The Academic—Always asking questions, al
ways learning. Oh. what a pleasure to kiss The Aca
demic! He'd practice on me for hours. He'd hone in
on well-received themes and arguments. He'd per
suasively offer the counter-position. The man may
have started out mediocre, but at the end of it, he
stood at the top of the kissing-class. Unfortunately,
he actually was an academic — my TA. And there
arc rules about that.
Roxy hopes that her list of best and worst kissers
offers you some guidance in your quest for mastery
of all the levels of getting it on. Just one final bit of
advice: If all you plan on doing is kissing, make sure

that you have some gum on you tor after your
smoochfest — it will help take off some of edge as
you furiously pedal home to masturbate. So I've

been told.
