## Challenge surpasses $3 billion $4.3 billion goal for University initiative within sight after just one year 
### CARLEE BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I"he Stanford Challenge celebrated its
first anniversary this month with a grand
total of $3 billion in pledged contributions,
according to the Office of Development.
The massive University fundraising en
deavor aims to raise $4.3 billion within five
years.
When President John Hennessy an
nounced the Challenge last October, the
initiative was off to an impressive start
with nearly $2.19 billion having already
been pledged at the time. The more than
$8(H) million in contributions since then
has boosted the Challenge ahead of pro
jections at the one-year mark, said Vice

President for Development Martin Shell.
"Our successes are because of a great
team effort," Shell said in an email to The
Daily. "The donors to Stanford continue to
he incredibly generous with their invest
ments to the University, and our volun
teers continue to provide invaluable serv
ice in myriad ways."
Shell also stressed that the more than
30().()(X) individual gifts made to the Chal
lenge were just as important as the total
dollar amount raised.
"This is an extraordinary vote of confi
dence for Stanford, for its academic lead
ership and for the educational mission of
the University." he said.
The Challenge cites three main objec
tives for fundraising, each covering a
broad range of goals for the University.
The first of these objectives is "Seeking
Solutions" through multidisciplinary re
search— a goal which will accumulate
$1.4 billion.
The "Educating Leaders" objective
places an emphasis on not only Stanford's

undergraduate and graduate schools, hut
also on K-12 schools, through venues like
the Stanford Teacher Education Program
(STEP). An initiative focusing on the arts
and humanities will also be funded
through the $1,175 billion devoted to this
objective.
The third goal. "Sustaining a Founda
tion of Excellence." earmarks $1,175 bil
lion for core University support. These
goals are already being met through the
early donations to the Challenge.
American Art and Culture Prof. Bryan
Wolf recently took more than 4()0 students
in his "American Memory and the Civil
War" I HUM class to a San Francisco
opera using Challenge-provided funds.
The tickets for the opera, "Appomattox,"
were specifically provided by Off the
Farm, a program that funds trips for stu
dent excursions to art events away from
campus.
Wolf, who is also one of the faculty
leaders of the Challenge's Arts Initiative,
stressed the importance of the funded

multidisciplinary programs.
"Using arts, creativity, imagination to
solve problems of the world — that's
where the arts initiative comes in," he said.
"It's more than just buildings and billets or
funding faculty, though that's certainly
part of it."
The heart of the Stanford initiative,
Wolf said, is "putting creativity at the cen
ter of a curriculum."
Shell expanded upon the other priori
ties of the Challenge, including new facil
ities, increased undergraduate scholar
ships and support for initiatives ranging
from international affairs to the environ
ment.
"We literally have hundreds of needs
and objectives embedded within the cam
paign components," he said. "Our chal
lenge is to keep connecting the needs,
ideas and objectives with our alumni, par
ents and friends."
