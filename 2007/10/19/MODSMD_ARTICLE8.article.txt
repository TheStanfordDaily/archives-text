loved their bodies as part of Stanford's third annual Love Your
Body Day. Sponsored by 11 groups on campus, the event cam
paigned for the self-respect of college students.
"Let's boycott mirrors for the next 24 hours" Director of
the Sexual Harassment Policy Office Laraine Zappert urged a

"Loving our bodies is a lifelong process," Zappert added.
Organizers encouraged both men and women to respect
and value their physical appearances while they enjoyed music,
dancing and other performances on display.
'ITie Stanford Improvisors sang "I Love My Body Because
It's So Good To Me," drawing laughter from the audience. Spo
ken Word member A-lan Holt '11 took a more serious ap
proach, rejecting others' images of beauty with her "Ode to My
C urves."
"I refuse to be fed lies and live a model size," Holt sang to
the White Plaza crowd."l refuse to believe beauty is found only
in single digits."
According to Donnovan Yisrael, Health Empowerment
Coordinator at Vaden Health Center, up to 70 percent of
women feel guilty or depressed about their body within three
minutes of reading a beauty magazine.
Ihe media is not the only source of pressure, though. Yisrael
also encouraged people to stop having "I'm so fat!" conversa
tions, those "gossipy" talks where students lament about their
figure.
"Would you talk to other people the way you talk to your
self?" he asked.
Although mostly women attended the event, coordinators
also emphasized the role of men.
"Males have a deep, dark secret," Yisrael said. "Tliey are
self-conscious about their bodies."
"If you pick up a men's magazine today, you should ques-

tion any shame you feel about your sexuality or your body," he
added."Beauty magazines just want to take your money. A true
beauty magazine would be one that would say' You are fine just
the way you are.'"
Femi Olutade '10 agreed.
"God made me beautiful." he said.
Event speakers stressed the importance of a positive out
look like Olutade's at all times.
Event co-sponsor Colleges Against Cancer (CAC), a group
advocating prevention through early detection, held its "Di

alPink" initiative. Students were offered a pastry in exchange
for a phone call to an aunt, mother, sister or friend encouraging
them to get their annual breast exam. CAC co-President
Michelle Golahek '08 emphasized the importance of women
getting annual mammograms to detect breast cancer.
"Many students at Stanford — people our age — have had
family members affected by cancer," Golabek said. "We are
there for the students and for each other."
According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is
the most common cancer among women. When discovered
and treated in its earliest stages, the chance for successful
treatment is greatest. By rewarding students for "Dialing-
Pink," CAC hoped to increase the odds of survival for those
affected.
Whether protecting or praising the body. Love Your Body
Day organizers emphasized the need to appreciate and take
care of oneself every day of the year.
"It is important to have an unconditional love [for your
body)," Yisrael said."love that is always there, even as you get
older."
