### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 30 students, faculty and
community members attended
"Burma's Crisis: What Should Out
siders Do?" at Encina Hall yester
day afternoon for a discussion on
possible ways to respond to the
Southeast Asian country's oppres
sive military junta.
Burma's military has used vio
lence to end pro-democracy protests
and arrested thousands of people in
recent months, and these crack
downs have prompted international
condemnation. Tens of thousands of
Burmese have poured onto the
streets of cities like Rangoon (Yan
gon)and Mandalay to join monk-led
demonstrations.
While news of the mounting
protests has been coming out of
Burma (Myanmar) for the past
month, panelists Maureen Aung-
Thwin, director of the Burma Pro
ject, and Maung Zarni, founder of
Free Burma Coalition, told yester
day's audience about their ongoing
efforts to call upon the international
community to make a change.
Aung-Thwin said outsiders ought
to impose more targeted sanctions
on the Burmese military junta. She
called for more aggressive interven
tion and said one mechanism of psy
chological pressure would be to tar
get the country's public relations in
terests.
Instead of boycotting the Chi
nese Olympics, Aung-Thwin said.
"the international community
should boycott the Burmese team
from participating in the event."
The UN's special envoy to
Burma. Ibrahim Gambari. is cur
rently touring the country's regional
neighbors like Thailand and India to
press them into using their influence
with the military authorities. But
Aung-'lbwin said the UN Secretary
General should not only send his
envoy hut also establish an engaged
presence within the country in order
to more effectively pressure the
regime.
"And the U.S. should be less visi
ble and more active." she added. "It
should take the lead in persuading

the global community to put more
political pressure on the military
junta."
Zarni. on the other hand, blamed
oil companies, such as Chevron, for
their continued business with the
junta.
According to Aung-Thwin, U.S.
sanctions prevent most American
companies from working in Burma,
but Chevron's investment there ex
isted before the sanctions were im
posed and the company continues
under a grandfather clause. Ulti
mately, Chevron is one of the few
large Western companies left in the
country.
The oil giant owns a minority
stake — a little more than 28 per
cent — in the Yadana natural gas
field and pipeline, according to The
San Francisco Chronicle. Both
China and India have been eager to
do business with Burma, hoping to

secure some of the fuel supplies that
their surging economies need.
According to Human Rights
Watch, an international watchdog
and one of the groups applying pres
sure on Chevron, natural gas sales
are the government's single largest
source of income, although econom
ic data from Burma is nearly impos
sible to verify.
"The international community
needs to pressure the Chevron exec
utives and use all the leverage possi
ble to pressure the junta" Zarni
said.
While the discussion yielded nei
ther groundbreaking nor immediate
solutions to the Burmese situation,
the panelists conveyed to the assem
bled audience their support for the
victims of oppression.
