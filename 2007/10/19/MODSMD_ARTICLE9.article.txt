About 30 students, faculty and
community members attended
"Burma's Crisis: What Should Out
siders Do?" at Encina Hall yester
day afternoon for a discussion on
possible ways to respond to the
Southeast Asian country's oppres
sive military junta.
Burma's military has used vio
lence to end pro-democracy protests
and arrested thousands of people in
recent months, and these crack
downs have prompted international
condemnation. Tens of thousands of
Burmese have poured onto the
streets of cities like Rangoon (Yan
gon)and Mandalay to join monk-led
demonstrations.
While news of the mounting
protests has been coming out of
Burma (Myanmar) for the past
month, panelists Maureen Aung-
Thwin, director of the Burma Pro
ject, and Maung Zarni, founder of
Free Burma Coalition, told yester
day's audience about their ongoing
efforts to call upon the international
community to make a change.
Aung-Thwin said outsiders ought
to impose more targeted sanctions
on the Burmese military junta. She
called for more aggressive interven
tion and said one mechanism of psy
chological pressure would be to tar
get the country's public relations in
terests.
Instead of boycotting the Chi
nese Olympics, Aung-Thwin said.
