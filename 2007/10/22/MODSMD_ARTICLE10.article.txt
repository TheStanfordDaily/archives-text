October 21,1977: Androg
yny House: Outgrowing the
sexist lifestyle

To one Androgyny House mem
ber. the resident offers "an experi
ment to see just how far feminist
ideas can be incorporated into
lifestyles."
To Row Director Karen Harri
son, "the fact that they get food on
the fable everv niizht is a victory in it
self."
And to one woman who left An
drogyny after living there for two
days, the brief stay showed her she
"was not ready to commit that much
time to it."
Iliose are only a few of the reac
tions to the newly formed co-op on
620 Mayfield.
Androgyny was approved in
March by Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs. The proposal
for the co-op said the house would be
devoted to a nonsexist lifestyle and
the study of sexism.
"We hope to have a non-sexist liv
ing environment," said Dee Buccia
relli, senior house associate. "Anoth
er one of our goals is having people
be aware of what feminism means to
them in their daily lives and how
both men and women can benefit
from the changes in society that fem
inism can bring about," she contin
ued.
