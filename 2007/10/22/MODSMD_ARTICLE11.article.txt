### JIMMY GOLEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BOSTON (AP) — Daisuke Mat
suzaka. Dustin Pedroia and these
Boston Red Sox are taking a sweet
streak into the World Series, too.
Boston charged to its third
straight win, completing yet another
October comeback by overpowering
the Cleveland Indians 11-2 Sunday
night in Game 7 of the AI. champi
onship series behind a new pair of
rookie Sox.
Matsuzaka pitched five solid in
nings. Pedroia drove in five runs and
the Red Sox — helped by a key blun
der by an Indians base coach) — fin
ished off their rally from a 3-1 deficit.
Having ended their 86-year title
drought in 2004 after digging out of a
3-0 hole against the Yankees in the
ALCS, the Red Sox now have a date
with Colorado in the World Series.
The Rockies, who have won 10 in a
row and 21 of 22. will come back
from a record eight days off for
Game 1 at Fenway Park on Wednes
day night.
"We started to click at the right
time. When your team's back is
against the wall, it shows the type of
ballclub we have. We're down 3-1
and we believed," Pedroia said.
Colorado outscored Boston 20-5
in winning two of three during an in

terleague series at Fenway in June.
The Red Sox did even better in
winning the last three games
against Indians, outscoring them
30-5 in that span.
While Manny Ramirez, David
Ortiz and ALX'S MVP Josh Beck
ett helped the Red Sox win their
12th pennant, the Indians only
added more misery to a city that
hasn't celebrated a World Series
championship since 1948.
Notes: Boston is 5-5 all-time in
decisive Game 75.... The Red Sox
were already the only team to have
rallied twice from a 3-1 deficit to
win the LCS.in 19X6 and '04. It was
the first winner-take-all in the
baseball postseason since the 2006
NLCS. ... Boston Game 4 starter
Tim Wakefield was unavailable to
come out of the bullpen.
