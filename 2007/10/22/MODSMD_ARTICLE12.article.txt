Nearly a dozen wildfires driven
by powerful Santa Ana winds

spread across Southern Califor
nia on Sunday, killing one person
near San Diego, destroying sever
al homes and a church in celebri
ty-laden Malibu, and forcing hun
dreds from their homes.
The Malibu fire was among at
least 10 blazes that burned more
than 35.000 acres, stretching from
north of Santa Barbara to San
Diego, as hot weather and hurri
cane-strength winds marked the
height of the traditional wildfire
season.
Four firefighters and at least
10 other people were injured and
taken to hospitals in connection
with the fire near San Diego, said
Matt Streck, a spokesman for the
California Department of
Forestry. Details on the death
were not immediately available,
The blaze burned more than
14.000 acres — or about 22
square miles — near a highway
about 70 miles southeast of San
Diego, just north of the border
town of Tecate. Streck said. Some
of the injured were hikers, and
others may be illegal immigrants,
Streck said.
In northeastern Los Angeles
County, a fire that started near
Agua Dulce. a fire burned about
10.000 acres, or nearly lf> square
miles, in just a few hours as about
250 firefighters tried to get a han
dle on it.
Ten buildings were destroyed,

but it wasn't clear how many were
homes, said county Fire Inspector
Ron Haralson. Between 500 and
800 people fled the area, and
three people were injured.
Meanwhile, in Malibu, about
700 firefighters worked to protect
about 200 homes in several up
scale communities nestled in the
hills, officials said. About 1,500
people fled the fires, officials said.
"This fire is zero percent con
tained. which means we're at the
mercy of the wind." acting Malibu
Mayor Pamela Conley Ulich said.
ITie fire is expected to burn for
another two to three days, he
said. Until the blaze is extin
guished, "there will literally be
thousands of homes that will be
threatened at one time or anoth
er." he said.
About 200 homes had been
evacuated in the communities of
Malibu Colony. Puerco Canyon,
Monte Nido and Sweetwater
Canyon, Brown said.
Several other blazes kept fire
fighters busy Sunday in Southern
California, including one near
Piru, a town of 1,200 in Ventura
County, north of Los Angeles. A
condor preserve was also poten
tially threatened.
In San Bernardino County,
east of Los Angeles, three fires
