elist.
Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958,
in large part due to "Doctor Zhivago," which tells the story of one
man's life during the chaos of the 1917 Russian Revol ut ion. The So

and the book was not published in the Soviet Union until 1988.
Stanford boasts an impressive array of Pasternak materials. In
honor of the novel's anniversary, the I loover Institution put on dis
play some rare documents from the Pasternak collection in the
Hoover Tower Rotunda Exhibit. Ihc first segment of the Pasternak
Family Papers digital archive, which includes more than 1.000 digi
tal images of Pasternak family documents and several drafts of his
most famous novel, has also been made available in the I loover
Archives reading room.
"The Hoover Institution archives presently house the largest
collection of Boris Pasternak papers in the world," Fleishman said.

"This conference is taking place at Stanford to underscore the fact
that our campus and the Hoover Institution became the foremost
world center of Pasternak studies."
The highlight of the symposium was the "Evening of Recollec
tions," which took place Friday in Tresidder Union. Pasternak
Slater and Andreyev Carlisle spoke of their experiences with the
Soviet author in the years leading up to his death in 1960.
Pasternak Slater discussed his famous uncle's concerns while he
was writing the novel and how his family was affected when the So
viet government and public openly criticized his work.
"His sisters, who would try to defend Pasternak, came out of
press conferences with tears streaming down their faces," Pasternak
Slater said. "I clearly remember the strain it had on my mother."
"The press described him as being worse than a pig," he added,
"because pigs don't foul their own sties."
"Doctor Zhivago" also affected Pasternak Slater's own life, the
author's nephew said. In 1958, Pasternak Slater attempted to par
ticipate in a student exchange program with Oxford University, but
he said Soviet authorities denied his visa application because of his
connection to the author.
"'lTiis gives a new glance at the past and enables us to relive the
dramatic circumstances in which one of the greatest 20th-century
poets lived and worked," Fleishman said of the weekend's sympo
sium.
Speakers traveled from European cities including London.
Stockholm, Prague and Moscow to discuss the novel. Other U.S.
universities were represented as well, including the University of
Michigan. USC and the University of Chicago.
