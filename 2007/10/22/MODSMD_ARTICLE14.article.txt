### VICTOR CRUZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Aspiring creative writers now have a
place on campus to call their own. The Writ
ers' Studio, which held its inaugural meeting
Friday afternoon, offers undergraduates a
chance to swap stories with some of the best
up-and-coming writers in the country.
The program is run by Stanford's Wal
lace Stegner Fellows, a group of 10 creative
writers selected for a two-year fellowship
from more than 1.400 applicants. Former
Fellow and current English Department
Lecturer Tom Kealey founded the Studio
with funds from the Stanford Arts Initiative.
Undergraduate students can attend the
Friday meetings for one-on-one discussions
with the Fellows, at least five of whom will
be present at each meeting, according to
Molly Antopol-Johnson. a Fellow in fiction
writing and co-coordinator of the new pro
gram.

gail Ulman emphasized the Studio's open
and welcoming atmosphere.
"You don't have to he an l.nglish major.
You can come in just to talk about books, or
to help get the writing started." Ulman said.
"Use the Studio for deadlines. And there
are snacks."
"We are all friendly and willing to work
with anyone." Antopol agreed. "Students
can come in with ideas or an actual piece to
look at. It's a really informal place."
Attendees of the first session said they
found the I ellows' advice helpful.
"I'm writing about my parents, and they
gave me the confidence to pursue my topic."
said Antonia Sohns '10. who came seeking
advice for a quarter project in her ci\ ative
nonfiction writing class.
"There is nothing like it anywhere else
on campus." said undergraduate Jessica
Richman. an economics and science, tech
nology and society major. "I came into
school as an English major, and now I can
keep up with my writing."
The Writers' Studio meets every I t iday
afternoon from 1 to 4 p.m. in the third floor
