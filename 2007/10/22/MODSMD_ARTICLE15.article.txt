## Photo event draws crowd 
### ASHLEY KAMIURA 
A symposium discussing the impact of
digital technology on documentary photog
raphy and photojournalism drew a crowd of
over 300 to Annenherg Auditorium this
weekend.
Organized by the Department of Art and
Art History and the UC-Berkeley Graduate
School of Journalism. Saturday's event fea
tured presentations and a panel discussion by
several prominent photographers.
"The question facing photographers
today is not what's inside their cameras, but
what's inside their head," said Danny Lyon, a
photographer and filmmaker whose work
has been featured in the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City. "Today a person can
operate this mechanical device, and pick and
choose from reality."
Fred Ritchin, former picture editor of The
New York Times Magazine, emphasized the
subjective nature of photography by juxta
posing a picture of a grinning President Bush
holding a turkey atop a silver platter among
troops in Iraq this past Thanksgiving with a
photo of what they really ate â€” a cafeteria
style plate of sliced turkey and rice.
"We love photography for its ability to be
a credible witness," he said. "Digital photog
raphy is a gift. How do we use it for good?"
Ritchin also previewed several photogra
phy applications currently in development by
Microsoft and other software companies.

One such program will allow users to edit
their photos using a publicly available data
base of images capturing the same location,
which will supply the portion of photo lost
after fixing a flaw.
The Stanford Photography Club also
helped run the event. Club members worked
the registration table and greeted attend x-s.
"This event is a way to justify our credibil
ity to the rest of Stanford," said Alex Green
burg "09, president of the club, noting the Art
Department's relative obscurity on campus
compared to other departments. Hie Photog
raphy Club has also gained exposure lately, is
its work is featured on the walls of the new
Axe and Palm eatery in the renovated Old
Union.
The symposium's audience included pho
tographers and educators from the profes
sional photography community, as well as
many students from the Art Department.'lhe
event was also publicized at several institu
tions around the Bay Area and brought in
community members from outside of Stan
lord.
"I think the event was a huge success,"
Photography Prof. Joel Leivick wrote in .111
email to The Daily. "Anytime you fill Annen
berg. you know you've hit on an interest that
many people share. There is a lot of support
for this kind of conversation."
