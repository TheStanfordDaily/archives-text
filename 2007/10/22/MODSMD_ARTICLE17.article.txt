## Editorial Board. Orhan Pamuk: One night only 
### 
Among the many benefits of living on
the campus of a world-class universi
ty is walking-distance and low-cost
access to a whole host of nationally and in
ternationally renowned speakers. Hailing
from fields such as politics, comedy, litera
ture and everything in between, high-profile
visitors come to Stanford University to de
liver lectures and presentations. And while
these events are often free or reduced price
to students, they are dominated by public at
tendees from Palo Alto and interested facul
ty members. Unless a marquee name like
Natalie Portman is involved,students are al
most nowhere to be found at these events.
When Orhan Pamuk — winner of not a
Golden Globe Award, but last year's Nobel
Prize in Literature — appears on the stage
at Memorial Auditorium tonight, his audi
ence will be dominated not by Stanford stu
dents interested in one of the most impor
tant voices in world literature, but instead
by elderly visitors from off campus and a
very select slice of the Stanford populace
that is on the Creative Writing depart
ment's mailing list. And if the attendance at
last year's lectures by Harvard's Alan Der
showitz or Green Party candidate and con
sumer activist Ralph Nader are any indica
tion. Memorial Auditorium will be depress
ingly under capacity, in sharp contrast to the
standing-room-only response that Portman
received a few weeks ago.
There is nothing wrong with drawing
crowds from the surrounding community or

marketing these events to alums. The
Pamuk visit figures prominently on the
Stanford.edu website that is rarely visited
by students but instead tailored to the
needs of alumni and community members.
ITie University is making the event as ac
cessible as it can: just show up at 6 p.m.
tonight at Memorial Auditorium, no ticket
needed, and you can listen to a Nobel laure
ate. But many students on campus remain
completely in the dark to cultural events
like this, just as some were unaware that
Portman was coming until all her free tick
ets "sold" out.
Iliis distressing lack of awareness ap
plies not only to the Stanford lecture circuit
but to performance arts events as well.
Stanford Music Department performances
and Stanford Lively Arts events, while
often offered at a small cost, are also domi
nated by adult visitors from Palo Alto.
Why aren't more students attending
these world-class events, taking place less
than ten minutes from a typical dorm
room? Are these events inaccessible to stu
dents who are too busy to go or to even seek
out what's going on? We hope not.
Tonight we can only hope that the Daily
Editorial Board will be proven wrong and
that throngs of literature-loving students —
or even those just curious and eager to hear
what the first-ever-Turkish Nobel Prize win
ner has to teach them — will turn Pamuk's
visit to Memorial Auditorium into a popu
lar and memorable event.
