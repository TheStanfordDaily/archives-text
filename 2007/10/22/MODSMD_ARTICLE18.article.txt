# Little Ms. Modern
## Mondays and mornings Talkback 
### 
Humans are a pretty diverse species,
hut in my twenty-three years of
fieldwork, I've found one strongly
recurring experience that puts everyone on
common ground: the collective misery in
duced by Mondays and their daily analog,
mornings. Some find these nascent mo
ments of our weekly and daily cycles oner
ous, arduous, and perhaps even lugubrious.
Others would put it more concisely: o-m-f-g,
this effing blows. But from high brow to low,
nearly everyone agrees that Mondays,
mornings, and especially those dreaded
Monday-morning combos comprise some
of the lower points in our lives.
Which means that you. Monday morning
reader, are probably in a dazzling mood
right now. Well,good morning. sunshine.and
a happy Monday to you! The weekend is
over, and the velvety blanket of night is long
gone. You have a full fifteen hours of work
filled glee ahead of you before you can rest
again, and five such days before any pro
longed relaxation might dream of taking
place. (Or maybe that's just me? Who would
have guessed that grad school is not. in fact,
just a continuation of that term-long beer
pong tournament otherwise known as the
end of senior year?)
So yes, I know, things probably look grim.
Hut before you give yourself up to despair,
finish reading my column, because in addi
tion to being the temporal hell of your week,
Monday morning also happens to be when
your weekly dose of modernity is served.
And this is no coincidence! As my friend
Fid pointed out to me. Monday is quite cer
tainly the most modern day of the week, and
by analogy, morning is quite certainly the
most modern time of the day (He's British,
so read that last line with a cute little ac
cent). Mondays, mornings, and modernity
all offer a fresh awakening to the world, a
chance at new beginnings, and. as I wrote in
an e-mail to Ed, the irresistible call of the
cold, harsh, capitalist-whore grind.They are
also all conveniently brought to us by the
letter M. which makes for amusing allitera
tive antics in this column.
Mondays, mornings, and modernity also
all share my unconditional affection amidst
considerable unpopularity. Yes, in addition
to being a semi pathological modernist, I
also generally describe myself as a Morning
Person. Upon reflection, I'm quite willing to
take on the title of Monday Person as well.
Deranged? Perhaps. Friends and lovers
have called me worse. Apparently no one
else enjoys a chipper conversation just after
dawn, not even during a whirlwind architec
ture-adventure-tour of western Europe
when there's so much to see and the sun is
shining and we better go get our cappucci
nos and croissants, now, Maggie, or we'll

miss the Centre Pompidou! No, people
don 't generally appreciate that, I've learned.
But if being a Monday Morning Person
makes me an outcast, so be it — I won't be
curbing my enthusiasm for anyone (not
even you, Larry David). Mind you, it's not
that I'm completely anti-nights-and-week
ends. I like my free cell phone minutes as
much as any other modern twenty-some
thing. I also occasionally attempt to have a
social life, and when that happens.it normal
ly occurs during those times. But there's
something exceptional about a Monday
morning that resonates oh so well with my
especially unbridled ncrdiness (I wonder
what my natural frequency is?). Don't snick
er, because 1 know you're all nerds too. 1 go
to this school,and I see you with yourTl-89s.
Indeed, in my limitless nerdy exuber
ance. 1 can hardly wait to spring from my
slumber on the first day of the week to tack
le problem sets, devour textbooks, balance
checkbooks, and maybe even write this
damn column. That special sparkle of the
cheerful, brisk industriousness pulsing
through the world on a Monday morning
makes me feel like I can accomplish any
thing. You know what I mean? Yes. I know
you do, nerds! Your supposed apathy and
cynicism don't fool me — you may bitch
and moan, but in your heart of hearts. I
know that you are just as excited to put your
well-endowed brains to use as I am. Yes, se
cretly, we are all Monday Morning People.
And guess what? Modernity is like the
ultimate Monday morning of the universe.
It's prime time to get your metaphorical
asses out of your metaphorical beds: there
are more challenges to meet and problems
to solve than ever before, and we need all
hands (and brains) on deck. Our cold, harsh,
capitalist-whore world provides us with un
precedented tools for enacting real change,
even changes to its coldness, harshness, and
capitalist-whorishness. Mow invigorating!
So please, grab your coffee, power on your
laptop, get your nerd on, and no matter
what, don't even think about going back to
sleep.

Caitlin hopes your Monday morning was
marvelous, and would love to hear about it, es
pecially if your description involves many

Oct. 15: training ourselves not to forget
(4/14 Comments)
IVlkhael S. on < hi. 15.4 a.m.:
Yet another sub-par editorial.
As much as I groaned upon reading the in
troduction (I thought,"Here we go again.an
other example of the fashionable tendency to
want to criticize a dead white man traditional
ly held in high esteem"), I felt even more let
down and even insulted after having finished
the article. It is a weak. lazy, cliche-filled mess
with no real point. Daily readers deserve
much, much better.
The column begins by promising big
things, suggesting that it will give us look at
the "uncomfortable and tragic truths of our
institution's historv." something the editorial

hoard dramatically challenges us to "accept,
address and embrace." What follows is a Ice
land Stanford quote, unacceptable by
today's standards but probably typical of its
day. then a mention of the contribution of
Chinese laborers to westward expansion,
and finally a gloss over why Senator Stanford
was probably an alright guy after all. The
whole Huffy, meandering thing fizzles to an
end with a forced platitudinal message about
embracing the University's complex history,
something to which this editorial does ab
solutely no justice.
Daily staff members have the privilege of
writing for a major university paper. How
about a stronger effort in future issues. Please
give us a paper we can be proud of.
Tom H. on Oct. 15, a.m.:
I now feel guilty that everybody had such
a good time over homecoming weekend. I
didn't know I was such a racist bastard, but
now I know, thanks to The Daily's editorial
staff.
After reading this editorial. I went down to

my basement and stabbed myself in the stom
ach with a plastic fork 145 times — one stab
for each year of white male hegemony.
Are we reading different editorials? on Oct. 15,
1 p.m.:
I read this and thought HUGE PROPS
I'OR WRITING THIS. It would have been
easy to do something rah-rah and chirpy after
alumni weekend, and I think that this choice
shows a lot of. for lack of a better word, balls.
And I mean that in a good way.
As someone who is half-Chinese, this arti
cle was pretty personal to me...and chat-board
postings filled with flippant dismissals of call
ing to attention our University's not-so-glori
ous past border on the offensive. Maybe if
your great-grandparents had passed down
stories of the brutal conditions they suffered
while building the Union Pacific railroads,
you wouldn't be so inclined to glibly dismiss
the importance of this article?
1 think that publishing on topics like this is
