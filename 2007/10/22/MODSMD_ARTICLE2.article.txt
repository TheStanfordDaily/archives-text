# FLiCKs on hiatus for repairs
## Sunday night film screenings will resume Big Game weekend 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
Plagued by technical difficulties, FLiCKs' weekly movie
screenings will face a several week hiatus after last night's
showing of the action hit "Transformers."
The student group, which has traditionally provided free
screenings of recent movie releases on Sunday nights, an
nounced on its Web site that the show would be cancelled "until
further notice." However, following a meeting last Friday be
tween ASSU President Hershey Avula "08, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Mondaire Jones '08, FLiCKs Director Mathew Crichton
•10 and Chris Elmore '08 of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE), FLiCKs is now scheduled to start running again during
the weekend of Big Game.
"FLiCKs will be back," Jones said. "I'm confident that the
time between now and Big Game is enough to bring back a new
and improved FLiCKs."
In last Sunday's showing of "The Bourne Ultimatum," the
Memorial Auditorium sound system gave out in the middle of
the 7 p.m. show in front of more than 1.000 students. When
Crichton phoned a Dolby surround
sound system technician to correct
the problem, he was told that a full
system test was in order.
A few weeks earlier. FLiCKs' 35
mm projector broke in the middle of
a showing of the Michael Moore doc
umentary "Sicko" in Cubberley Au
ditorium.
"We had to switch to a one reel
system," Crichton said. "Every 20
minutes, there'd be a one minute
blackout when the projectionist up
stairs would have to manually reload
the reel."
Crichton said that the projectors
and sound systems in both Memorial
and Cubberley Auditoriums have
not been correctly maintained for
the past four or five years, but techni
cal issues have been difficult to re
solve because of FLiCKs' weekly
showings.
"The difference between FLiCKs
and other student groups is that
there's a showing every week, usual
ly with large turnouts," he said. "Be
cause of that inertia of the program,
the problems that we're facing have
been impossible to fix and will re
main impossible unless we cancel
shows and address our difficulties
first."
The program also faces challenges
in terms of finance and management.
Crichton said that FLiCKs used
to be run as an SSE business until
two years ago. when SSE decided to
hand over funding for the program
— which was losing money — to
ASSU Special Fees.
A week after Crichton joined the
FLiCKs team last year, nearly all of
the executive management quit,
leaving a staggering $12.(KH) debt in
the hands of Crichton and a few
other individuals.
Personnel issues have continued
to be a problem for the student
group. Crichton said that not enough
people were staffing the FLiCKs
team to handle the amount of work
involved with restructuring the pro
gram.
"The transition to this year's core
was poorly done." Jones said.
In last Friday's meeting. ASSII
Executives sat down with Crichton
and Elmore to discuss the refinanc

ing of FLiCKs' budget as well as re
pairing the ailing projection equip
ment.
"Hershey and I only found out
about these problems on Friday,"
Jones said. "But we think we've
found a solution."
Jones said that between now and
Big Game weekend, more staff will
be hired in order to meet the heavy
workload. He said the ASSU will
partner with SSE to reduce the pro
gram's debt.

"We're working with SSE very
closely to make sure that all debts are
being paid off. in a sort of convenient
timeline," Jones said. "As of now.
$6.5(M) of that $12.(XK) debt has been
paid off."
Elmore said that SSE was still de
ciding what to do with the remainder
of the debt.
"At this point, we have not made a
decision about it,"he said. "Most
likely. FLiCKs won't need to be pay
ing it off this year, and we'll be work

ing with them to resolve the financial
troubles."
The technical issues regarding the
projection equipment in both Cub
berley and Memorial Auditoriums
will also be fixed before the Big
Game weekend movie showing, and
Jones said that Ricks will transition
to DVD technology.
Based on the over 1 .(XX) students
that showed up to FLiCKs last Sun
day, Crichton said he is confident
that the student body wants to keep

the shows running.
"Students want FLiCKs to occur.
They just want it to he of good qu.ili
ty. at the same time and same place
every week." he said. "For that rea
son. we'll just have to stop FLiCKs
until we can give students what they
want."
