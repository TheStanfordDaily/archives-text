## Diving into dating 
### 
I would date Christine if I could. She's
spontaneous and courageous. She has an
incredibly strong sense of self. She kicks
my ass in the classroom and does so with
humble grace. Christine's also pretty hot.The
total package, right? Tragically, she prefers
men. Oh, and she doesn't date.
Christine avoids romantic encounters.
Her reluctance to enter the dating scene is
not for lack of attractive males. On the con
trary. over dinner we often enumerate the
various attractive and available men in our
lives. But whenever she seems particularly
excited about a prospect, 1 ask her, "So, what
are you doing about it?" Her response is al
ways, "Nothing. It's just not worth pursuing
anything."
She isn't alone; many of my friends share
the same hesitation to transition from a
friendship into a relationship. Yet a relation
ship seems to be all they want. I'm constantly

confounded by the contradiction between
their desire and their lack of action. And then,
sadly, because my friends aren't dating any
one, they take it out on their self-esteem.They
describe themselves as "undateable," or they
think that no one finds them attractive.

For Christine, this lovelorn contradiction
is rooted in a complex web of bad experi
ences, Stanford time pressures, over-analysis
and a need for control. She describes her
point of view through an elaborate cost-ben

efit analogy. Cost equals time and emotional
energy.There is no guarantee of a benefit, and
the men in her past make the value of a ben
efit seem negligible. So, she plays it safe and
waits.
What Christine doesn't realize is that she's
missing out on the exact romantic opportuni
ties she hopes for because of her inaction. For
example, this summer she had the perfect
chance at a summer fling.The boy in question
made his intentions fairly clear with sweet
and suggestive flirtation. He walked her
home after drinks. She liked him, too. But
given her past,she felt uncomfortable making
even the slightest of moves. So nothing hap
pened. My theory: after said boy failed to elic
it a positive response from Christine, he
thought she wasn't interested and moved on.
I've seen the same situation repeated time
