## Diving into dating 
### 
I would date Christine if I could. She's
spontaneous and courageous. She has an
incredibly strong sense of self. She kicks
my ass in the classroom and does so with
humble grace. Christine's also pretty hot.The
total package, right? Tragically, she prefers
men. Oh, and she doesn't date.
Christine avoids romantic encounters.
Her reluctance to enter the dating scene is
not for lack of attractive males. On the con
trary. over dinner we often enumerate the
various attractive and available men in our
lives. But whenever she seems particularly
excited about a prospect, 1 ask her, "So, what
are you doing about it?" Her response is al
ways, "Nothing. It's just not worth pursuing
anything."
She isn't alone; many of my friends share
the same hesitation to transition from a
friendship into a relationship. Yet a relation
ship seems to be all they want. I'm constantly

confounded by the contradiction between
their desire and their lack of action. And then,
sadly, because my friends aren't dating any
one, they take it out on their self-esteem.They
describe themselves as "undateable," or they
think that no one finds them attractive.

For Christine, this lovelorn contradiction
is rooted in a complex web of bad experi
ences, Stanford time pressures, over-analysis
and a need for control. She describes her
point of view through an elaborate cost-ben

efit analogy. Cost equals time and emotional
energy.There is no guarantee of a benefit, and
the men in her past make the value of a ben
efit seem negligible. So, she plays it safe and
waits.
What Christine doesn't realize is that she's
missing out on the exact romantic opportuni
ties she hopes for because of her inaction. For
example, this summer she had the perfect
chance at a summer fling.The boy in question
made his intentions fairly clear with sweet
and suggestive flirtation. He walked her
home after drinks. She liked him, too. But
given her past,she felt uncomfortable making
even the slightest of moves. So nothing hap
pened. My theory: after said boy failed to elic
it a positive response from Christine, he
thought she wasn't interested and moved on.

and time again with many of my
friends, and I think the tragic pattern
results from our expectations about
the course of love. From the female
perspective, 1 think we fall victim to
the classic idealizations of romance.
The woman is to he held on a pedestal
and pursued. She should wait for the
object of her affection to fight armies
just for an opportunity to kiss her
hand. But. men aren't Disney charac
ters. Iliey have a set of insecurities
equal to those of every other human
being. The knight in shining armor
isn't going to suit up unless he thinks
he won't get rejected the second after
he vanquishes the dragon.
Dating doesn't happen sponta
neously: it requires interest and work
from both parties (or. not to be
monogamously normative, all par
ties). And work doesn't mean moon
lit ballads or breaking into 1 loover
Tower earning a dozen roses — it

just means making a shared effort.
Moving a relationship beyond
friendship doesn't even necessitate
romance. For those with misgivings
about mutual affection, the ambigu
ous coffee date provides a great
venue to examine possible interest.
However, most importantly, it is the
reciprocal process which helps a bud
ding relationship grow.
It's this fact that I've been trying
to get across to Christine since this
summer. Whether she wanted the re
lationship or just the hookup, she
could have had it if only she'd made a
nudge in her boy's direction. Howev
er. 1 realize there still exists that com
plicated web that dissuades her from
making a move. 1 just don't want her
perpetually waiting for the man of
her dreams. Ile might be right in
front of her, except he passes by be
cause he thinks she isn't interested.
Or maybe I do want her perpetually
waiting — maybe then 1 can finally
get a date with her.
