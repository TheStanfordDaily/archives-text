MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Stanford suffered its first winless weekend of the year, losing to No. 1 UCLA on Friday and then tying
No. 10 USC on Sunday. The team will look to bounce back at Arizona this Friday.
Hie Stanford team started off
better than its opponents in each
game but could not make the early
pressure count.
Sophomore forward Kelley
O'l lara had Stanford's best chance
of the UCLA game just under 12
minutes in. Fellow sophomore Ali
Riley and freshman forward Chris
ten Press combined on the left, and
O'l lara met Press's low cross at the
top of the UCLA box, placing a ris
ing left-footed shot toward the
upper left corner of the goal. But
Bruins goalkeeper Valerie Hen
derson dove to her right and
knocked the ball away.
The rest of the first half played
out uneventfully until fortune
smiled on UCLA with 8:26 remain
ing in the period. UCLA's sopho
more forward, Lauren Cheney, was
met at the top of the box by two
Cardinal defenders, who both ap
peared to tackle the ball. Cheney
went down, and the referee showed
no hesitation in awarding the Bru
ins a penalty. Cheney popped up
and converted the spot kick to
make it 1-0.
Stanford had to commit num
bers forward in the second half to
try to equalize, but the Cardinal
could not buy a shot on goal, and
UCLA eventually hit them on the
counterattack. Cheney picked up
the ball near midfield and drew de
fenders before dumping the ball off
to midfielder Christina DiMartino
on the left side of the box. DiMarti
no slotted home to double UCLA's
lead.
The Cardinal had a few chances
in the dying minutes — redshirt
senior midfielder Shari Summer's
had a shot cleared off the line by a

Bruins defender after a corner kick
— but could not find the back of
the net.
O'Hara again almost opened
the scoring early against USC two
days later. The Trojans lost posses
sion immediately after kicking off.
and O'Hara cut past one defender
and sprinted by another before rip
ping a shot just wide of the left
hand post. Just three minutes later.
Press fired inches wide on the same
side after redirecting a cross from
Riley.
The USC players slowly began
to play themselves into the game
and had a few chances,committing
several fouls in trying to match up
with the faster Cardinal players.
That fouling came back to bite
the Trojans at the end of the first
half. With 1:43 remaining before
the break, junior defender Marisa
Abegg delivered a free kick into
the Trojans' box from the left side.
Less than 10 minutes after check
ing in,senior forward Lizzy George
rose to head the ball in at the near
post, giving Stanford a 1 -0 lead.
The Cardinal came out strong in
the second half and almost made it
2-0 when Summers whistled a 25-
yard shot just over the crossbar in
the early minutes. However, the
scales slowly began to tip in IJSC's
favor, and the Trojans scored on a
header of their own with just under
seven minutes to play. Amy Ro
driguez ran in unmarked from mid
field to head home off of a Lauren
Brown cross, knotting up the score
at 1-1 and sending the game to
overtime.
Neither side could convert in
the extra periods, although USC
goalkeeper Kristin Olsen had to
come out and clear balls away from
O'Hara and Press on several occa
sions.
