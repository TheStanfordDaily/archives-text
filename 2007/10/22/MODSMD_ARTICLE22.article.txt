Stanford men's soccer traveled to Golden
Bear territory this weekend, only to suffer its
second consecutive defeat.The Cardinal (4-4-5.
1-2-2 Pacific-10) dropped to No. 24 California
(8-4-1.3-2-0 Pac-10) in a 1-0 decision on Satur
day.
The first offensive strike came from Stanford
freshman Bobby Warshaw. who missed his first
of three shots wide at 9:30. By the 15th minute,
the teams had traded attempts, but Cardinal
sophomore keeper John Moore and Bears'
goalie Stefan Frei each notched a save to pre

vent the goal-scoring opportunities.
Just shy of the 29-minute mark, though, Cal
found the net as junior I'at Marion scored his
first goal of the season. Marion took a short
shot from inside the box after receiving a cross
from Servando Carassco. Warshaw saw a
chance to tie at 44:27 but missed wide, and the
half ended at 1 -0.
Stanford's defense kept it close from the
start of the second period, limiting Bears' lead
ing scorers Andrew Wiedeman and Andrew Ja
cobson to one shot each for the game.
Sophomore midfielder Michael Strickland
praised the defense for the accomplishment.
"Our defense holding Jacobsen and Wiede

man to only one shot apiece is a testament to
what kind of players they are and to how they
perform day in and day out," Strickland said.
"The back four are extremely strong and dealt
with Cal's attacking threats well nil game."
Junior defenseman T.J. Novak, though, gave
credit to the entire team for the defensive suc
cess.
"Our defense is strong hut only because our
team defense is so good." Novak said. "By that
I mean that it isn't just the four backs and goal
keeper. but everyone putting in the effort to get
back and [to be in] good positions to help."
