## Cardinal dominates Arizona State, improves record to 19-1 on the year 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Hie No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team bounced
back from a lackluster performance to sweep Arizona State
in dominating fashion on Friday.The Cardinal had its best of
fensive match of the season and held the Sun Devils to only
14 points in the final game of the match.
Alter sweeping Arizona in three close games the night he
fore. Stanford was back on its game in Tempe, and Arizona
State — missing its leading hitter Sarah Reaves, who had a
sprained ankle — had no answer for the Cardinal onslaught.
"She had played really well the night before until she got
hurt," head coach John Dunning said of Reaves. "She had
been their most effective hitter this season, and I know it
made a difference for them. You always feel bad when that
happens to a team. When we scouted them. 1 really enjoyed
wajching their match against Arizona.They played with a lot
of energy and 1 think she probably had something to do with
that."
With Reaves out. the Cardinal dominated on offense and
stilled the Sun Devils' attack. Junior outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza had a match-high 15 kills and was one of eight Stan
ford players to hit over .4(H) in the match. As a team, the Car
dinal hit at a .491 clip and held the Sun Devils to only .139 hit
ting.
Stanford was also bitten by the injury bug this weekend, as
junior defensive specialist Jessica I 'ishburn sprained an ankle
against Arizona on Thursday night and did not play Friday.
"I think that it was really important for our team what
happened on h iday night." Dunning said."We talked a lot on
the floor, celebrated and just had fun — and that was big with
Jess off the court. She is such a fun and excited player, and we
missed her presence on the court. Hut to have her out and
have us really step up and do a great job was a good thing for
our team to be able to do."
Stanford took the first three points of the match and
stretched its lead as the game continued. Stanford led by dou
ble digits for the first time at 24-14 and reached game point at
29-IK on a kill by junior middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo.
Arizona State strung together a run. but it was not enough,
and the Cardinal finished the game, 30-21. with a kill from
senior middle blocker Franci Ciirard.
The teams traded points to start the second game until
Stanford used a five-point run to go up 9-6. The Sun Devils
battled back to get within one.but Stanford again pushed out
in front. Ciirard capped a four-point run with another game
winning kill, ending the frame 30-19.
ASU scored first in the third game, but Stanford charged
back in front and then ran away with the game. Leading 4-2.
Stanford reeled off 10 of the next 12 points for a 14-4 lead.The
Sun Devils would not come within six points down the
stretch, and Akinradewo served out the match with three
points in a row. A Barboza kill from the back row ended it 30-
14.
klineman and Akinradewo each chipped in 13 kills on of
fense, with Waller and Ciirard adding seven apiece. Ciirard tal
lied a kill on every attack, posting a perfect hitting percent
