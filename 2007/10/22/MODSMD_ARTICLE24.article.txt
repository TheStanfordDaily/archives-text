## Sitting Lopez for grades? 
### 
So Friday morning I get a text
from my boyfriend, and all it
says is, "Brook Lopez is on
ESPN. Lol."
It came as no surprise to me
that the illustrious Brook Lopez
would be on ESPN. But that my
boyfriend would think it...funny?
1 logged on to the ESPN.com
homepage. 1 think the featured ar
ticle was something about the Red
Sox and Indians, or Adrian Peter
son, 1 can't quite remember. But
on the list of news articles, there it
was on the top: "Stanford's Lopez
suspended for missing classes."
1 clicked. The headline: "Al
ready ineligible, Stanford 7-footer
suspended indefinitely." 1 read on
to discover that Lopez had missed
"two days of classes and one prac
tice this week," prompting head
coach Trent Johnson to suspend
him.
Lopez will not be able to prac
tice with the team or partake in
team activities until at least next
Friday, when Coach Johnson re
assesses the situation to deter
mine whether or not he has made
adequate progress.
The press release said that
Lopez was suspended for "a viola
tion of team rules." Coach John
son told the San Jose Mercury
News,"First of all, he has to attend
class and make practice. Show a
consistency —go to class, make
practice...Brook has a chance to
be something special. But the bot
tom line is, you've got to go to
class, study vigorously and you get
to participate."
At this point, I'm pretty con
fused as to whether Lopez was
suspended because he violated
some team rule that requires all
team members to attend class
every day or because coach John
son felt that he was not working
hard enough to make himself aca
demically eligible again.
Either way, 1 think the suspen
sion is a little ridiculous.
Don't get me wrong— I'm all
for maintaining academic stan
dards for athletes in the NCAA —
regardless of how good they are,
or what pick they will be when
they decide to enter the NBA
draft, they are students before
athletes.
I'm pretty sure we had academ
ic standards in high school, too. In
my district, athletes had to main
tain a 2.0 GPA.
But how they got to that 2.0
was up to them.
I cut class as much as the next
kid. I even got Saturday school
once or twice because of truancies
from forgetting to turn in my fake
sick notes. But 1 still made my nec
essary 2.0 every semester, and,
therefore, I still got to play.
So should Brook.
1 think it is a little ridiculous for
Coach Johnson to dictate whether
or not Brook is making "adequate
progress" toward maintaining a
1.8 GPA — of all people. Brook
should decide whether or not
Brook is making "adequate
progress" toward maintaining a
1.8 GPA.
I suppose I could understand
Johnson's intervention if Brook
missed, say, two months of classes.
Two weeks, even. But two days?
Are you serious? Unless he also
missed a midterm, or three
midterms, or something, I really
cannot see how missing just two
days of classes will so surely pre
vent him from maintaining a 1.8
that it justifies intervention and
punishment. Maybe he missed
classes because he was at home
studying for upcoming midterms.
Maybe he missed classes because
he feels he learns better when he
reads the textbook and takes
notes on his own.
Earlier this month. Brook said:
"...1 take full responsibility for
fmy academic probation]...l
promise to work hard to improve
my academic standing and look
forward to being back on the floor
to help my team."
I believe what he says, whether
I see him in class every day or not.
