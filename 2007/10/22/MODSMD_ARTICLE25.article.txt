# Cardinal keeps momentum up with 21-20 win over 'Cats
## A 						tale of two coaches: Jim Harbaugh and Arizona's Mike Stoops 
### CHRISTOPHER R ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
TUCSON, Arizona — As over
50, CXX) fans streamed out of Arizona
Stadium, Stanford coach Jim Har
baugh celebrated his team's huge 21-
20 win that kept the Cardinal's bowl
hopes alive.
On the other side of the field, a
morose scene unfolded as Arizona
picked up the pieces of another lost
season, the loss clinching their ninth
straight campaign without a winning
record. The final seams may have
come apart for Mike Stoops' tenure
in Tucson, and, sadly for long-suffer
ing Arizona fans, the end is like the
beginning.
There is a concept in sports that
the personality of a team can be
traced back to that of its coach. That
principle was on display on Saturday,
with Harbaugh channeling his calm,
driven demeanor into his team's fo
cused comeback victory and Stoops'
fiery nature showing in critical melt
downs at just the wrong time for the
Wildcats.
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh and
Arizona coach Mike Stoops come
from parallel roots — the sons of
coaches themselves, they were born
in Ohio, perhaps the best state in the
country for producing teachers of the
game. Both played college football
under Big Ten giants, Harbaugh at
Michigan for Bo Schembechler and
Stoops at lowa under Hayden Fry.
Both were part of national champi
onship teams as coaches.
That's where the similarities end.
Football coaches joke that they can
tell early — boys who like to build up
blocks become offensive coordina
tors, and those who like to knock
them down coach on defense.
Harbaugh has always been the
former. As a quarterback, it's always
been his job to get his team focused
and in position to succeed.Through a
long career in college and the NFL,
Harbaugh earned an image as a
cocky, competitive leader with a wide
mouth who was always able to back it
up. But when he left the field, he
adapted that personality into the role
of coach — teaching, motivating and
inspiring.
Most importantly, Harbaugh gets
his players to believe in themselves.
With the team's top three tailbacks
hurt, it would have been understand
able for the staff to focus on throwing
to Stanford's fine wide receivers.
Nope. Harbaugh asked Tyrone Mc-
Graw, who had never seen significant
action, and Jason Evans, whose lack
of production had benched him more
than once in his career, to saddle up,
and they combined for over 100 rush
ing yards. Tackle Matt Kopa moved
over to tight end for extra blocking
and shined. With tight end James
Dray out for the season, Austin Gun
der — who had one career catch
coming in — turned in a four-recep
tion performance.
Every replacement seemed to
work, with the team barely missing a
beat. When the team needed them.
1 larbaugh showed faith in little-used
reserves, and they responded.
On defense, it was the same story.
A unit that wore down in last week's
loss to TCU took the game on its
back in the fourth quarter, forcing a
critical fumble and stuffing Arizona
on a quarterback sneak to give Stan
ford the ball back. Playing with mul
tiple injuries, Nick Sanchez inter
cepted a pass, forced a fumble and
made a key third-down stop in the
final period. And safety Bo McNally
made up for some untimely missed
tackles to dominate the stat sheet
with 10 tackles.
I larbaugh saved his gutsiest move
for last—sending injured power
back Jeremy Stewart into the game
to take in the go-ahead touchdown.
Stewart pounded over the line on
second and goal from the 1. ran over
Arizona's best defensive player and
burst into the end zone.
"Their mindset is they just go out
and play..They're playing hard, and
they're playing all out. They're play
ing confident," Harbaugh said after
the game.
Meanwhile. Stoops has long had
the opposite demeanor — a bom
bastic hothead wearing emotion on
his sleeve, going back to his days as
coordinator of some very strong
Kansas State defenses. His appoint
ment to Arizona was expected to

bring a fearsome defense back to the
desert, but the loss to Stanford
served as a microcosm of his dysfunc
tional, inconsistent tenure.
Stoops instructed quarterback
Willie Tuitama to take a delay-of
game penalty on fourth down near
the end of the first half. Instead,
Tuitama threw an incomplete pass,
and Stanford ate up the short field
for a touchdown to take the lead.
Running back Nic Grigsbv had es
tablished control over Stanford's de
fense, but Stoops and his staff went
away from the run. instead regressing
to the wild yet ineffective short pass
ing game and never exploiting Stan
ford's wounded secondary with deep
passes. Stoops' stomping, volatile
sideline antics were on display when
he got into a dust-up with his offen
sive coordinator. Sonny Dykes, dur
ing the game. And the Wildcats' atti
tude never recovered after a critical
third-quarter field goal went wide
left, even though they still held a six
point lead.
In the hard-luck world that is Ari
zona football. Dykes and Stoops'
wife wept on the sideline — partly
for Stoops' job. Normally ebullient
athletic director Jim Livengood was
disconsolate, as his two whiffs on
football coach hires will likely cost
him his job, as well.
And it was as simple as that in the
desert, two Ohio boys fighting it out:
the one who maintained his team's
focus won the game.

hurt, it would have been understand
able for the staff to focus on throwing
to Stanford's fine wide receivers.
Nope. Harbaugh asked Tyrone Mc-
Graw, who had never seen significant
action, and Jason Evans, whose lack
of production had benched him more
than once in his career, to saddle up,
and they combined for over 100 rush
ing yards. Tackle Matt Kopa moved
over to tight end for extra blocking
and shined. With tight end James
Dray out for the season, Austin Gun
der — who had one career catch
coming in — turned in a four-recep
tion performance.
Every replacement seemed to
work, with the team barely missing a
beat. When the team needed them.
1 larbaugh showed faith in little-used
reserves, and they responded.
On defense, it was the same story.
A unit that wore down in last week's
loss to TCU took the game on its
back in the fourth quarter, forcing a
critical fumble and stuffing Arizona
on a quarterback sneak to give Stan
ford the ball back. Playing with mul
tiple injuries, Nick Sanchez inter
cepted a pass, forced a fumble and
made a key third-down stop in the
final period. And safety Bo McNally
made up for some untimely missed
tackles to dominate the stat sheet
with 10 tackles.
I larbaugh saved his gutsiest move
for last—sending injured power
back Jeremy Stewart into the game
to take in the go-ahead touchdown.
Stewart pounded over the line on
second and goal from the 1. ran over
Arizona's best defensive player and
burst into the end zone.
"Their mindset is they just go out
and play..They're playing hard, and
they're playing all out. They're play
ing confident," Harbaugh said after
the game.
Meanwhile. Stoops has long had
the opposite demeanor — a bom
bastic hothead wearing emotion on
his sleeve, going back to his days as
coordinator of some very strong
Kansas State defenses. His appoint
ment to Arizona was expected to

bring a fearsome defense back to the
desert, but the loss to Stanford
served as a microcosm of his dysfunc
tional, inconsistent tenure.
Stoops instructed quarterback
Willie Tuitama to take a delay-of
game penalty on fourth down near
the end of the first half. Instead,
Tuitama threw an incomplete pass,
and Stanford ate up the short field
for a touchdown to take the lead.
Running back Nic Grigsbv had es
tablished control over Stanford's de
fense, but Stoops and his staff went
away from the run. instead regressing
to the wild yet ineffective short pass
ing game and never exploiting Stan
ford's wounded secondary with deep
passes. Stoops' stomping, volatile
sideline antics were on display when
he got into a dust-up with his offen
sive coordinator. Sonny Dykes, dur
ing the game. And the Wildcats' atti
tude never recovered after a critical
third-quarter field goal went wide
left, even though they still held a six
point lead.
In the hard-luck world that is Ari
zona football. Dykes and Stoops'
wife wept on the sideline — partly
for Stoops' job. Normally ebullient
athletic director Jim Livengood was
disconsolate, as his two whiffs on
football coach hires will likely cost
him his job, as well.
And it was as simple as that in the
desert, two Ohio boys fighting it out:
the one who maintained his team's
focus won the game.

touchdown pass from quarterback Tavita Pritchard in the second quarter of Stanford's win against the Wildcats.
