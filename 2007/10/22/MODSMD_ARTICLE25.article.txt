# Cardinal keeps momentum up with 21-20 win over 'Cats
## A
						tale of two coaches: Jim Harbaugh and Arizona's Mike Stoops 
### CHRISTOPHER R ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
TUCSON, Arizona — As over
50, CXX) fans streamed out of Arizona
Stadium, Stanford coach Jim Har
baugh celebrated his team's huge 21-
20 win that kept the Cardinal's bowl
hopes alive.
On the other side of the field, a
morose scene unfolded as Arizona
picked up the pieces of another lost
season, the loss clinching their ninth
straight campaign without a winning
record. The final seams may have
come apart for Mike Stoops' tenure
in Tucson, and, sadly for long-suffer
ing Arizona fans, the end is like the
beginning.
There is a concept in sports that
the personality of a team can be
traced back to that of its coach. That
principle was on display on Saturday,
with Harbaugh channeling his calm,
driven demeanor into his team's fo
cused comeback victory and Stoops'
fiery nature showing in critical melt
downs at just the wrong time for the
Wildcats.
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh and
Arizona coach Mike Stoops come
from parallel roots — the sons of
coaches themselves, they were born
in Ohio, perhaps the best state in the
country for producing teachers of the
game. Both played college football
under Big Ten giants, Harbaugh at
Michigan for Bo Schembechler and
Stoops at lowa under Hayden Fry.
Both were part of national champi
onship teams as coaches.
That's where the similarities end.
Football coaches joke that they can
tell early — boys who like to build up
blocks become offensive coordina
tors, and those who like to knock
them down coach on defense.
Harbaugh has always been the
former. As a quarterback, it's always
been his job to get his team focused
and in position to succeed.Through a
long career in college and the NFL,
Harbaugh earned an image as a
cocky, competitive leader with a wide
mouth who was always able to back it
up. But when he left the field, he
adapted that personality into the role
of coach — teaching, motivating and
inspiring.
Most importantly, Harbaugh gets
his players to believe in themselves.
With the team's top three tailbacks
hurt, it would have been understand
able for the staff to focus on throwing
to Stanford's fine wide receivers.
Nope. Harbaugh asked Tyrone Mc-
Graw, who had never seen significant
action, and Jason Evans, whose lack
of production had benched him more
than once in his career, to saddle up,
and they combined for over 100 rush
ing yards. Tackle Matt Kopa moved
over to tight end for extra blocking
and shined. With tight end James
Dray out for the season, Austin Gun
der — who had one career catch
coming in — turned in a four-recep
tion performance.
Every replacement seemed to
work, with the team barely missing a
beat. When the team needed them.
