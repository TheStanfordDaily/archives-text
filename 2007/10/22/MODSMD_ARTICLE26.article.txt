PLAYER OF THE GAME
Cornetback Nick Sanchez. Playing with injuries to both
legs, a shauldei and a bicep, the experienced senior
notched nine solo tackles. He delivered two huge opportu
nities to the offense, setting up Stanford's first touchdown
by beating a Wildcat tight end for an interception and forc
ing a fumble on Arizona's last drive that Will Powers recov
ered, allowing the Cardinal to run down the clock.
PLAY OF THE GAME
facing tlwd-and five at the Arizona 20 midway through the
fouith quarter, Tavita Pritchard dropped back and fired ovei
the middle to Evan Moore. Moore, who had committed key
drops in similar situations during the season, reeled in the
pass at the 14, absorbed on explosive hit from two Wildcat
defenders, and held on for the hrst down. Stanford scoied the
game winning touchdown later in the drive.
Turning point
Arizona plocekicker Jason Bondzio had already made a 49
yard field goal, but on a 29 yard attempt that closed the
thud quarter, he missed the kick wide left At the end of a
turnover filled quarter for the Cardinal, the points would
have given Arizona a 23 14 lead und forced a hurry up
game plan, instead, Stanford was able to run their base of
fense for the go ahead score two drives later
Cardinal highlight
Running backs Jason Evans and Tyrone McGraw, fourth and
filth on the depth chart, combmod for 128 yards on 37 cat
ries and a touchdown It was a night of redemption for Evans,
who had been all but forgotten after an inconsistent and
fumble prone two years in the backheld
Cardinal lowlight
Evans and center Tim Mattran left the gome with in|unes,
further thinning on already depleted offensive depth chart
Key stat
Stanford's mash unit team dominated the fourth quarter,
using ball control and turnovers to hold Arizona to 66 yards
on 12 plays in the final stanza
