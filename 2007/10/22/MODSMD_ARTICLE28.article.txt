## Obama stresses education in L.A. 
### CHRISTOPHER WEBER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sen. Barack Obama
promised to improve America's education sys
tem Saturday as he brought his presidential
campaign to the East Los Angeles school im
mortalized in the 1988 movie "Stand and Deliv
er."
The presidential hopeful spoke to about 200
students, teachers and others at Garfield High
School, one of the social and cultural touch
stones of the city's largely Hispanic, working
class East Side.
Obama stressed the importance of early
childhood education and called for more re
sources and funding for schools, adding that ed
ucating students should be the work of the entire
community.
"It's time to stand up and deliver for Ameri
ca's urban poor," Obama said.
He expressed concern about high dropout
rates among Latinos and blacks, saying America
needed educated workers to keep its economy
strong.
If "black and brown students are dropping
out of school... our work force is not going to be
competitive in the world." he said.

The Democrat also urged Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger to sign the Dream Act, a bill
that would make illegal immigrant students who
graduate from high school eligible for college
aid. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar measure
last year.
The legislation would make sure "more stu
dents can see that a college education isn't a far
away dream," he said.
The first-term Illinois senator vowed to roll
back President Bush's tax cuts to pay for re
forms to the health care system, which he said
needs to be more focussed on prevention.
"1 will make sure every single American has
health care that is at least as good as my health
care as a member of Congress," Obama said.
"You pay my salary-. Why should my health care
be better than yours?"
Obama returned to California after a brief
visit to Nevada, where he told an audience that
his opponents could not accuse him of flip-flop
ping on support for the Iraq war because he
never supported the war.
He revisited that theme Saturday at Garfield
High, drawing enthusiastic applause when he
said his first act as president would be to call a
meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and tell
them: "You've got a new mission and that's to

get our troops out of Iraq."
Obama downplayed polls showing him trail
ing Sen. Hilary Rodham Clinton of New York
for the Democratic nomination. And he joked
about recent claims that he and Vice President
Dick Cheney are distant relatives.
"We've been trying to keep that hidden. He's
the black sheep of the family," he said to cheers
and laughter.
Before heading to East Los Angeles, Obama
dropped by Universal Studios chief Ron
Meyer's Malibu mansion Saturday morning for
a tony fundraising event whose sponsors includ
ed actresses Alfre Woodard and Julia Louis-
Dreyfus.
Garfield High was made famous by the Ed
ward James Olmos film "Stand and Deliver,"
which chronicled a math teacher's real-life suc
cess in teaching calculus to the school's diverse
student body.
Its alumni include four of the five members
of the rock band Los Lobos, who staged a bene
fit concert earlier this month to replace the cam
pus auditorium. The ornate. 82-year-old build
ing, known throughout the community for its
grand stage, vintage glass chandeliers and intri
cate plaster work, was destroyed by an arson fire
last May.
