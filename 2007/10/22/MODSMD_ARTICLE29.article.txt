## Cal drops second in a row Bruins beat No. 12 Golden Bears with last minute interception 
### KEN PETERS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - Hie battling UCLA
Bruins are perfect where they need to be - in the Pac
-10 standings.
The Bruins (5-2. 4-0) parlayed Kahlil Bell's 142
yards rushing, an opportunistic defense and a steady
performance by quarterback Patrick Cowan in to a 30-
21 win over No. 10 California 30-21 on Saturday.
The victory was even more impressive because the
Golden Bears had regular quarterback Nate Long
shore back from an injury. Cal (5-2. 2-2), which was
ranked No. 2 and could have moved up to the top spot
only a week earlier, came up short late for the second
game in a row.
The unranked Bruins, meanwhile, are the same
bunch that was ranked 10th when they lost 44-6 at
Utah,and then lost their last game to Notre Dame, the
Fighting Irish's only win of the season.
UCLA's major goal this season, with players wear
ing wristbands to remind them, is a conference title
and the Rose Bowl berth that goes with it.
Bruins coach Karl Dorrell said his players can't af
ford to take much time to savor the win. After next
traveling to Washington State. UCLA faces a tough
stretch that includes Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon
and USC.
"I'm going to feel good today, but tomorrow it's
going to be business as usual," Dorrell said. "It's tough
to play up there in Pullman.
"When you have a victory like this, you enjoy it for
a few hours and then it's time to go on to the next one."
Ihe Bears seemed on the verge of pulling out the
win when they moved to the UCLA 30 in the final two
minutes. But on third-and-6, Alterraun Verner inter
cepted Longshore's pass and sprinted 7b yards to the
end zone with 1:33 remaining.
The Bruins were coming off a bye and it may have
helped in planning for the Bears' offense.
"We studied them, and that was an advantage we
had with the extra week," Dorrell said."We tried to get
to know their offense as good as we could. It was good
to see him (Verner) recognize in that critical down to
see what they wanted to do.
"I le made a great play."

Bell rushed for 142 yards on 22 carries and kai For
bath kicked three field goals for UCLA.
The loss almost certainly cost Cal any shot at the
Pac-10 title.
"We have stumbled two weeks in a row now," Bears
coach Jeff Tedford said. "We just have to regroup. We
are not going to just pack it in.'lTiere is so much parity
in this conference.
"Anything can happen on any given week. I think
the conference is better than it's ever been. They just
played a lot better than we did. 'ITiey were more phys
ical and deserved to win the football game."
Cowan, back after being sidelined by a knee injury,
was 18-of-27 for 161 yards and a touchdown and was
not intercepted. Brandon Breazell had four catches for
68 yards, gained 21 yards on three carries, and threw a
touchdown pass for UCLA.
Dorrell said Cowan "did exactly what we wanted
him to do. 1 le is almost in the predicament of being the
last man standing. We're just happy to have one of our
top two quarterbacks healthy."
The loss overshadowed a big day by the Bears' De-
Sean Jackson, who had nine receptions for 136 yards
and two touchdowns.
Longshore, who sat out the last game because of a
sprained ankle, was 22-of-34 for 232 yards and three
touchdowns, but with three interceptions. After Vern
er's pick. Dennis keyes intercepted Longshore's throw
in the waning seconds and the Bruins ran out the clock.
Cowan had an extra week to get healthy, since the
Bruins were off following their loss to Notre Dame.
UCLA was down to third-string quarterback McLeod
Bethel-Thompson for most of that game after starter
Ben Olson went out with a knee injury and Cowan al
ready sidelined by his injury. Bethel-Thompson threw
four interceptions against the Irish and lost a fumble
that was returned for a touchdown.
Cal was trying to bounce back from a 31-28 loss to
Oregon State that knocked the Bears out of the No. 2
ranking. With Longshore out.redshirt freshman kevin
Riley filled in and his scramble on the final play of the
game allowed the clock to run out and cost the Bears a
chance at a tying field goal.
The Bruins moved ahead 23-21 on Forbath's 27-
yard field goal with 3:08 to play. Jackson had given the
Bears a2l -20 lead when he hauled in a 2-yardTD pass
from Longshore late in the third quarter.
UCLA linebacker Christian Taylor was taken off
the field in the fourth quarter because of concussion.
He was taken to a hospital for tests, and UCLA offi
cials said that CT scans were negative, and that Taylor
was up and moving around.
