## Bedbugs found in Paloma dorm room Frosh praise fast Housing, exterminator response 
### JOANNA XU 
Bedbugs — which terrorized dorms
in East Florence Moore and Lagunita
Court last year — remain a real prob
lem for Student 1 lousing.
A new outbreak occurred earlier this
month in Paloma, a West Florence
Moore dorm, forcing two residents to
relocate to Governor's Corner while
their room is disinfected.

"Student Housing has been informed
of a few cases of bedbugs on campus for
about the past six to seven years," Imo
gen Hinds, associate director of student
housing, wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have not had cases every year.
Some years we do have more than in
others."
Bedbugs often go undetected be
cause afflicted students initially believe
that other pests are responsible for the
small red bumps that result from the in
sects' bites.
"I started getting small mosquito
like bites on my forearm half a week into
school," said Michael Terrell '11, a resi

dent of the infected second-floor room.
"At first I thought it was just an allergic
reaction or mosquito bites. I figured I'd
tough it out."
When the bites began reappearing
every five to 10 days, however, Terrell
became suspicious and, with roommate
David Zimmerman' 11, began to suspect
that bedbugs may have been the source
of his problem.
"We found out on Wikipedia that
bedbugs are harder to find," Zimmer
man said. "But most bedbugs will leave
their excrement on or near the bed
frame. When we looked on Michael's
bed frame, we saw little dark spots."

Their suspicions confirmed, Terrell
and Zimmerman approached Paloma
Resident Assistant (RA) I leather Gra
ham '08 on Oct. 13.
" ITiey didn't really talk about bed
bugs at RA training," Graham said.
"Michael did much of the research him
self."
"Because Michael and 1 discovered
the bedbugs on Saturday. I lousing was
n't open," she added. "1 called the emer
gency hotline, and the guy on the line
was super helpful.The exterminator was


Bedbugs, discovered last year in Alondra and Granada dorms, were encountered in Paloma this month. Two residents have been relocated to Governor's Corner
here within an hour and a hall"."
Crane Pest Control exterminator
Rich Crane will spend one month
thoroughly debugging the room.
"The pest control staff goes
through every item in a room to con
firm whether it is bedbug free or
not" I linds said."lf it is.it can be le
leased to the resident. Clothing can
be released almost immediately."
Graham, Terrell and Zimmei
man were all impressed by Crane's
expertise.
"Rich just had to look at the little
dark specks on the bed frame to
know that it was bedbugs," Terrell
said. "He explained the whole
process of getting rid of bedbugs
very thoroughly to us. Basically, he's
going to strip the room until its a ce
ment cube."
Terrell seemed more amused
than intimidated by the incident.
"Makes for a good story," he said.
However, removing bedbugs
from a room does not ensure that
the bugs will not return to the site.
"Once the pesticide wears off,
and if bedbugs are reintroduced to
this space," Hinds said, "they might
return."
