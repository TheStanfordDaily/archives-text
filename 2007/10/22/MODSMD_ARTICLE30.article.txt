## Biodegradable gift cards on sale 
### MARK JEWELL THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CAMBRIDGE. Mass. (AP)_Target offers shop
pers an unusual message about its gift cards at some
stores, advising that they are biodegradable. "Just
make sure you spend them first." the displays con
clude.
Ibis isn't just a marketing gimmick. Plastics made
from corn and other plants are carving a tiny niche
from the market for conventional petroleum-based
plastics and being touted as green alternatives for
everything from bulk food containers to lipstick tubes
and clothing.
So-called "bioplastics" offer the world a way to
wean itself off oil, and most biodegrade to varying de
grees. But their makers' green argument is complex,
and environmentalists are cautious in their support.
Manufacturing bioplastics produces carbon diox
ide, which contributes to global warming. The materi
als are made from crops - corn, switchgrass, sugar
cane, even sweet potatoes - that require land and
water to grow. Some sound alarms because genetical
ly modified organisms are used to spur the fermenta
tion that creates them. And recycling them presents
still other pitfalls.
They also can cost three times more than conven
tional plastics, which gives businesses pause about
adopting them. Until bioplastics expand beyond their
current tiny fraction of the overall plastics market, the
road to popularity is expected to be rough.
"It's almost a chicken-and-egg scenario," said
David Cornell of the Association of Postconsumer
Plastic Recyclers.'it might someday reach that critical
mass, but it has to happen very quickly, because in the
meantime it can be a nuisance for us."
Bioplastics' main benefit would be to reduce from
10 percent the share of U.S. petroleum consumption
that goes into plastic. The types that are biodegrad
able also could help compensate for the country's
slow progress in recycling - only about 6 percent of
plastic made in the U.S. was recycled in 2005. accord
ing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Bioplastics also lack toxins like polyvinyl chloride
that have raised health concerns and led California
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger this month to sign legis
lation banning chemicals called phthalates from toys
and baby products.
"This is a promising new technology that faces
some challenges." said Mike Schade of the Center for
Health, Environment & Justice, a Falls Church. Va.-
based nonprofit. "But we don't view them as insur
mountable, if the industry is willing to face them head
on."
The market's newest entrant is Mirel, from Cam
bridge-based Metabolix Inc. It more easily biode
grades than rival materials and. unlike others, can
break down in a backyard compost bin. Its first con
sumer application came in July when Target Corp.
began using it in gift cards at 129 stores. Metabolix is
talking with potential clients about dozens more ap
plications for Mirel. from razor blade handles to a
coating for disposable coffee cups.
Agricultural processor Archer Daniels Midland
Co. provides corn feedstock for making Mirel, which
requires genetically engineered bacteria to aid in fer
mentation.
The most widely used bioplastic, Nature Works —
a product of a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Cargill
Inc. — also is corn-based and biodegradable. It is
made without genetically modified bacteria. Some of
the corn that goes into it is modified, raising environ
mental concerns on the sourcing end. but the compa
ny notes that protein from the corn is destroyed in
processing. Nature Works already is used in dozens of
products, including water bottles — an application
unsuited to Mirel, which isn't transparent.
Other bioplastics that biodegrade to some degree
include Ecoflex, from German chemical company

BASF AG; Mater-Bi, from Italy's Novamont SPA; and
Cereplast, from a Hawthorne, Calif.-based company
by the same name. And two major conventional plas
tics makers — DuPont Co. and Brazilian chemical
company Braskem SA — make recyclable bioplastic
that isn't biodegradable, the first from corn and the
second from sugar cane.
No figures are available on overall bioplastics pro
duction. but bioplastics makers acknowledge the
products occupy a tiny niche in the global plastics
market, which totals $250 billion and produces 360 bil
lion pounds a year. By comparison, the 300 million
pound capacity of Nature Works' Nebraska produc
tion plant is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the
market total.
For most biodegradable bioplastics, including Na
ture Works, an industrial compost plant is recom
mended — facilities that are few and far between.The
products are stable in places where microbes and
moisture are minimal, as on a kitchen shelf. Metabolix
says Mirel will decompose in a backyard compost
within two months and about twice as slowly in soil,
rivers, lakes or the ocean. But very few Americans
compost, and most who do try not to include even
paper products, let alone unfamiliar bioplastics.
"There's a lot more to it than saying it's scientifi
cally and technologically possible to compost these
materials," said Betty McLaughlin of the Container
Recycling Institute, a nonprofit encouraging greater
materials recovery and recycling.
And, just as different types of petroleum-base plas
tic can't be mixed in recycling, bioplastics should not
be mixed with any conventional plastic because even
tiny quantities can irreparably contaminate some
melted petroleum-based plastics that have higher
melting points. Cornell said.
"The sustainability concept is taking hold broad
ly. including in the corporate sector," said McLaugh
lin. "But these materials face a long road gaining ac
ceptance."
A major bump on that road will be their cost. But,
in another chicken-and-egg paradox, growing the
market for bioplastics is key to bringing down their
price, industry leaders said. Nature Works says its pro
duction costs are just 10 percent to 20 percent above
those of conventional plastics. Companies buying
Mirel pay about $2.50 a pound, compared with 70
cents to 90 cents for petroleum-based resin, although
the price difference is expected to shrink as quantities
grow and oil prices rise.
Tamara Nameroff. acting director of the American
Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute, said
being as good as the product it replaces is not good
enough for any green product, "even if you've proved
you can make it environmentally friendly."
"You have to show a cost advantage to what it's re
placing." she said. "The idea that people just want to
purchase environmentally friendly products has been
demonstrated in some markets, but not universally."
Though most consumers lack the patience to sort
out all the arguments, environmental friendliness can
sell. Ralph DiMatteo, 48. of Painesville Township,
Ohio, said after learning Sam's Club gift cards are
made of Nature Works plastic that he would buy them
as holiday gifts.
"1 don't spend a lot of time researching these kinds
of things, but if something is presented to me proper
ly to show how my effort can make a difference for the
environment. I'm willing to pay a couple extra cents."
DiMatteo said.
For now. Metabolix is banking on that kind of at
titude. said co-founder and chief scientific officer
Oliver Peoples.
"We believe that there is a segment of the popula
tion that is willing to pay to basically feel better about
using plastics," Peoples said. "And if a company decid
ed it wanted to go in that direction of charging $2.03
for a cup of coffee rather than $2, our view is that
we're adding something to their brand."
