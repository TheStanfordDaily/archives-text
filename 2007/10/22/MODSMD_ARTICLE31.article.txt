## Teachers' sex offenses kept secret 
### JULIET WILLIAMS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO. Calif. (AP) _
More than 300 California educators
had their teaching licenses revoked
or suspended because of sex-related
offenses from 2001 through 2005.
But you can't tell that from the
state's enforcement records — at
least not those available to the public.
While some of the most egregious
sex abuse is flagged, state law allows
many offenses to remain confidential
in education records, even when
teachers go to prison and register as
sex offenders.
The lack of information reflects a
system for disciplining teachers that,
across the country, is often shrouded
in secrecy. That makes it difficult for
states to share valuable information
about errant teachers and allows
some to find other jobs in the class
room.
In California alone. The Associated
Press reviewed more than 2.000 cases
in which teachers were punished and
confirmed that 313 of those were for
sexual misconduct.
Hundreds of cases were classified
as "general misconduct," requiring
further AP research to determine the
nature of the offense. The number of
cases in California was so large that
not all of them could be fully investi
gated. meaning the state undoubted
ly had far more than 313 sexual mis
conduct cases during the five-year
span.
The case of Tanda Rucker, a for
mer college basketball star who
taught and coached girls basketball
at Encinal High School near Oak
land. was one of those. After several

teens each reported having a sexual
relationship with Rucker.she plead
ed no contest to 18 felony counts.
She was sentenced to a year in jail
and ordered to register as a sex of
fender.
Yet an official bulletin from Cali
fornia's Commission on Teacher Cre
dentialing reported only that Ruck
er's teaching credential was revoked
for misconduct under broad sections
of state law that cover everything
from theft to murder.
The AP's review found dozens of
similar cases, often involving pleas of
no contest, a common legal agree
ment that allows one to avoid a trial
or civil liability, but still leads to con
viction. California law also bars the
credentialing commission from re
vealing the reason teachers who
plead no contest lose their licenses.
It's a dangerous loophole, says As
semblyman Todd Spitzer, a Republi
can from Orange County.
"There is the possibility that one
of these people could move to anoth
er jurisdiction, most likely another
state, and you wouldn't be able to find
out their history," says Spitzer, a for
mer prosecutor and high school Eng
lish teacher.
Here's how it can happen: Califor
nia submits information on teachers
who lose their licenses to a national
database. But because of California's
law. the state only provides limited
details. So officials in another state
may find out that someone they want
to hire had a problem in California,
but it's nearly impossible for them to
learn more from education records.
In some cases, school officials
have only a one-year window to ac
cess California disciplinary' records.

That came into play in 2002, after
California granted a probationary li
cense to Craig Kinder. He'd been
forced out of a suburban St. Louis dis
trict amid accusations that he'd
touched students inappropriately.
Kinder was acquitted on criminal
charges — but California officials
gave him a license only on the condi
tion that he tell prospective employ
ers about his past.
1 le didn't do that when he applied
at California's Newport-Mesa Uni
fied School District.
And by the time district officials fig
ured out he'd lied, the state — and
the very California agency that re
quired Kinder to disclose his history
— had sealed his disciplinary records.
That made it tough to fire Kinder,
says Lorri McCune.then the district's
assistant superintendent of human
resources.
"This to me was a gross miscar
riage of their responsibility." McCune
says. "We had basically no recourse,
which really made me sick."
Kinder eventually voluntarily sur
rendered his California license in
2003, after the Newport-Mesa district
spent hundreds of thousands of dol
lars trying to force him out.
His attorney did not respond to
messages left by The Associated
Press.
Mary Armstrong, the state cre
dentialing commission's legal coun
sel, couldn't discuss the Kinder case,
but says her agency seals some disci
plinary records because state law re
quires it.
"It's a balance between the rights
of a teacher who may be falsely ac
cused," she says,"and the rights of the
public."
