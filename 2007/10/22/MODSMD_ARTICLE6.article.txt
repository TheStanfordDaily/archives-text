# STEPHEN EAGLE FUNK

### 
Stephen Eagle Funk '08 is a self-de
scribed pacifist activist feminist op
timist leftist individualist. Despite
the seeming contradiction between
possessing these characteristics and
serving in the military, Funk enlisted
for the Marine Corps in 2002 at age l l ).
"I was feeling protective of our
country [after 9/11] and I wanted to be
a part of the institution that defended
our values and freedoms," he said.
Looking back on his decision to en
list, he admitted that, "It wasn't well
thought out."
In fact. Funk realized almost imme
diately after starting boot camp in
Afghanistan that he opposed
the war and could not moral
ly be a part of violence he did
not condone.
"During rifle qualifica
tions in basic [training], I shot
like an expert. My coach told
me not to think anything of it
— he didn't think I would do
well in actual combat," re
called Funk of the moment
he realized he could not will
ingly continue to be in the
Marines.
"Without thinking, I told
him he was right because 1
don't want to kill anyone. In
boot camp, you're not even
allowed to use the word 'I.'
express personal opinions,
especially opinions like
that." Funk said. "Of course I
got in trouble for saying that,
but hearing aloud what 1 had
been feeling inside crystal
lized my beliefs. After that
point I could no longer just
go along with the program,
but I had no idea about con
scientious objection as an op
lion until I researched my
military rights online."
Funk filed for conscien
tious objector status in No
vember 2(X)2 and lived in San
Francisco as a reservist while
he waited for confirmation.
When his troop was de
ployed to Iraq for active duty

on Feb. 9,2003, Funk did not show up. He was under the impression that his platoon un
derstood his reasons for not serving and did not believe he was committing a crime.
The Marines Corps saw things differently. On Apr. 1.2004. he reported to his reserve
post in San Jose, only to be charged with desertion and unauthorized absence.
"My platoon knew where 1 was the entire time," maintained F unk."lt's not like 1 was
in hiding.
"I was encouraging people to think, and they wanted to make an example of me," he
said. "No one else had spoken out against the war at the time except the Dixie Chicks
and Michael Moore. 1 wanted people in the military to think harder about their moral
values towards service."
On Sept. 1,2004, Funk became the first known soldier to be jailed for refusing to serve
in Iraq. In a victory for anti-war activists helping his cause, he was acquitted of desertion
charges, but he received a six-month sentence in a military brig at Camp Lejune,N.C.,for
unauthorized absence. For a public conscientious objector and openly gay man. the brig
posed a lot of risks, but Funk managed to finish his sentence in five months for good be
havior.
After leaving the Marines. Funk attended a city college before transferring to Stan
ford in 2(X)5.1 le is working to complete a degree in international relations.
"My first-hand experience with the military and how wars are operated spurred my
interests to study international relations and help prevent [future wars]," he said.
On campus, Funk is active in the LOUT community and at the Native American Cul
tural Center. I le serves as chapter president of the San Francisco Iraq Veterans Against
the War organization, which helps raise enlistees' awareness about their rights, among
other activities. One of his main concerns is veterans' education.
"Many exceptionally bright people are discouraged from even applying to schools
like Stanford because they doubt that they could feel comfortable in a culture they see
as elitist, and I think military veterans are especially hesitant." Funk said. "High school
students can receive encouragement from teachers and guidance counselors to apply to
elite schools, but veterans don't usually have access to academic advisers. Any school
benefits from a diverse student body, and Stanford is definitely lacking a veteran pres
ence."

with," he said."ln the end,you get on a plane and
go back to the world, but you know they're still
stuck in their sad existence."
His most rewarding experience was a "day of
backbreaking work" in Cite Soliel, Haiti.
"In full combat gear we had to lift these mas
sive jugs of water onto people's heads so they
could balance them and walk home," Stern said.
"At the operation's end we returned to our base.
1 was sore all over and so horribly fatigued that 1
lay down directly under the A/C — in the dark, in
pain, bur 1 smiled knowing that every ounce of
pain was well worth it because somebody had a
little more clean water to give their babies or sick
elders."
Though Stern is proud of his military service,
he has reservations about the way the war in Iraq
is being handled.
"As far as the Iraq war is concerned, the Bush
administration is guilty of gross incompetence,"
he said. "There is a consistent record of them ig
noring sound advice from ground commanders,
condemning our valiant troops and innocent
Iraqis to die. That said, anti-war people are great
Americans but I'd tell them this: a couple Marine
battalions could go a long way to ending that
genocide in Darfur. I'd rather see that put to an
end by the measured use of military force than let
it continue unabated as we protest and boycott
back here in the States, to no avail."
Now that he is out of the Marine Corps, Stern
is very eager to glean all he can from his educa
tion at Stanford.

On a campus where students and faculty alike
have spoken out against the war. Stern does not
want to be judged by his experience with the Ma
rine Corps.
"1 don't make a point to walk up to people and
say,' Howdy, I'm a vet!"" he said. "But when peo
ple inquire about my age or why I'm a transfer
(student], I explain it to them. 1 don't think it's too
important to know I'm a vet — I'm just another
student here on the Farm."
At Stanford, Stern hopes to work for the same
things that motivated him to join the military.
"In many ways 1 am still at war because the
real forces I fought against, such as poverty, greed
and human suffering, still exist, and 1 intend to
spend my life battling them." he said.
Stern champions veterans' rights and has a
very direct message for the University regarding
the admissions of veterans like himself.
"I would like to issue a challenge to the
provosts of Stanford University and also to the
rest of the nation's elite institutions," he said.
"1 challenge you to reach out to qualified vet
erans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and to en
courage them to attend your universities," he
continued. "Give these young veterans an educa
tion equal to the efforts they gave their nation. 1
implore you to not fall victim to the patronizing
bias that portrays those of us who serve in the
military as being incapable of participating in the
nation's intellectual discourse."
