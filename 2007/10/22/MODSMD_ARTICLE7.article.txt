## Pritchard and Co. get past Wildcats, 21-20 
### CHRISTOPHER R ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It took every last second and the slimmest of
margins, but Stanford escaped the desert Satur
day with a 21 -20 win over the Arizona Wildcats.
The Cardinal (3-4,2-3 Pac-10) got huge per
formances from senior cornerback Nick
Sanchez and senior running back Jason Evans,
dominating the fourth quarter to pull out an
other nail-biter that evoked memories of the
24-23 win at then-No. 2 Southern California
two weeks ago.
Hie Cardinal took advantage of two Ari
zona (2-6. 1-4 Pac-10) turnovers, two failed
fourth-down conversions and a missed field
goal to win its third Pac-10 road game in four
tries dating back to last year.
In his third start, redshirt sophomore Tavita
Pritchard completed l l ) of 27 passes for 181

yards, including a 33-yard second-quarter
touchdown to sophomore wide receiver
Richard Sherman to go along with two inter
ceptions. Jason Evans and redshirt freshman
running back Tyrone McGraw pounded out a
combined 128 rushing yards on 37 carries to
help Stanford keep pace for a postseason
bowl game. The Cardinal needs three more
wins to become eligible for a bowl game.
Fielding a patchwork unit due to a slew of
injuries, Stanford's offense performed when
it had to, taking advantage of opportunities
set up by the Cardinal defense. With the Wild

cats holding a 10-0 second-quarter lead and
driving, Sanchez outfought Arizona tight end
Rob Gronkowski and intercepted a Willie
Tuitama pass.
Stanford went 59 yards in five plays, with
sophomore wide receiver Richard Sherman
breaking free behind the defense for a 33-
yard touchdown reception. After an incom
plete pass on fourth and short gave Stanford
the ball again, the Cardinal went nine plays in
2:07, culminating with Evans' two-yard
touchdown run with five seconds left in the
half to give the Cardinal a 14-10 cushion at
the break.
Arizona added 10 points in the third quar
ter,running wild on the thin Cardinal defense.
The Wildcats' chance to take control fell
by the wayside when Jason Bondzio's 29-yard

field goal went wide left at the close of the
third quarter, keeping the Arizona lead at 20-
14 and giving Stanford the chance to win with
a touchdown.
The Cardinal did not blow the opportuni
ty. Two drives later, Stanford went 53 yards in
seven plays, capped by freshman tailback Je
remy Stewart's one-yard touchdown run on
his only carry of the day. Stewart was hurt and
was designated the "emergency" back for a
team missing its top two tailbacks. 1 le got his
chance when Evans left earlier in the drive
with a knee injury.
The defense, led by sophomore free safety
Bo McNally (10 tackles) and Sanchez (nine
tackles), keyed a defensive effort that
stopped Arizona four times in the second and
fourth quarters. With the Cardinal leading

21-20, Sanchez made a huge stop on third
and-six one yard shy of the first down, forcing
Arizona into an unsuccessful quarterback
sneak on the crucial fourth down. The ball
was spotted an inch shy of the marker, giving
Stanford a chance to run out the clock with
3:46 to go in the game. The Cardinal offense
went three-and out on the ensuing posses
sion. but Sanchez forced a fumble on the
Wildcats' first play from scrimmage on the
next drive. Will Powers recovered to seal the
deal for Stanford.
