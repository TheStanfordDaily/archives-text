### CHRISTOPHER R ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It took every last second and the slimmest of
margins, but Stanford escaped the desert Satur
day with a 21 -20 win over the Arizona Wildcats.
The Cardinal (3-4,2-3 Pac-10) got huge per
formances from senior cornerback Nick
Sanchez and senior running back Jason Evans,
dominating the fourth quarter to pull out an
other nail-biter that evoked memories of the
24-23 win at then-No. 2 Southern California
two weeks ago.
Hie Cardinal took advantage of two Ari
zona (2-6. 1-4 Pac-10) turnovers, two failed
fourth-down conversions and a missed field
goal to win its third Pac-10 road game in four
tries dating back to last year.
In his third start, redshirt sophomore Tavita
Pritchard completed l l ) of 27 passes for 181

reer starts for Stanford Saturday's game against Oregon
