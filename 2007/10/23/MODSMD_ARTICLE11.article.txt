Like many other Stanford students.Tripp Leavitt' 11
often finds it hard to keep in touch with family mem
bers while at school.
"1 definitely have trouble staying in contact with my
friends and family back home in London," he said.
"Skype doesn't work for me, and it's hard to call be
cause of the time difference."
"I just email them occasionally." he added."lt's real
ly bad."
'Thanks to a newly developed online product called
Tokßox, students like Leavitt are only a click away
from speaking to family members and seeing their
faces in real time.
"Tokßox's goal is extreme simplicity," said Serge
Faguet.one of the company's co-founders."We want to
make global video communication very useful and
common."
Tokßox is a free online chat service that allows users
to converse via video without having to install any pro
grams or even be online at the same time, a feature
unique to Tokßox. Other current video chat
applications, such as the popular Skype, require a
process of download and installation. Users who sign
up on Tokbox.com receive a personal link that their
friends can use to access the user's video.
Stanford students who tested the Web site were
amused by the service but quick to point out improve
ments that could be made.
"'There's a lot of static in the audio," said Pamon
Forouhar '11. "And sometimes the screen is fuzzy. 1
would like it if the screen were bigger."

"But in general I like it,"he added.'its original."
Part of Tok Box's usability is that it can be integrated
into any Web page, blog or social networking profile
such as Facebook.
Faguet is confident that Tokßox and its business
model will be successful.
"We are now being funded by the original people
who first funded You l übe." he said. "Sequoia Capital
doesn't invest in companies that don't have a lot of po
tential to be huge."
Six months ago, Faguet left Stanford's Graduate
School of Business after one semester to co-found Tok-
Box with Ron Hose, his classmate at Cornell.
At first,Tokßox was funded by five investors, all of
whom had deep connections to Stanford, and today
the company maintains close ties to the University.
Computer Science Prof. Rajeev Motwani is an investor
and counselor to the company, while Jawed Karim, a
co-founder of You Tube and a computer science grad
uate student, is a board member and financial support
er.
Despite Faguet's optimism, there are challenges to
Tok Box's development.
"This product is more complicated than other Web
2.0 sites," he said. "It's very easy to store videos on a
server and deliver them when they're accessed by a
client, which is what You Tube does."
The challenge. Faguet said, is maintaining high
speed video transfer.
"For real time chat,"he said, "our biggest problem is
ensuring that someone from Malaysia video-chatting
with someone from California won't experience lag."
When asked about recruiting new employees,
Faguet expressed enthusiasm about hiring Stanford
students.
"1 think I am actually contributing to Stanford's
drop-out rate," he said.
