## Research sheds light on how we wake up Advanced technique allows scientists to control animals 
### VICTOR CRUZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of Stanford researchers
has uncovered a neurotransmitter
that plays an enormous role in getting
out of bed in the morning, a trouble
some task for many college students.
And in doing so, the researchers have
tapped into a powerful research tech
nique that allows scientists to virtually
control animal behavior.
Karl Deisseroth, assistant profes
sor of bioengineering and of psychia
try and behavioral sciences, led a col
laborative team of researchers that
consisted of neuroscientists. sleep re
searchers, chemistry and bioengineer
ing students.
The study confirmed a long hypothe
sized link between the neurotransmit
ter hypocretin, which passes on mes
sages to part of the brain, and its role in
waking people up.
Researchers employed cutting edge
techniques in neuroscience and bio
engineering to access the hypocretin
producing cells, located in the part ot
the brain called the hypothalamus.
They discovered that when they in
creased the neurotransmitter, mice
woke up substantially more often than
those with unactivated hypocretin cells.
"The mechanism of sleep and wake
cycles must involve hypocretin cells in
the hypothalamus," said Atoine
Adamantidis, a psychiatry postdoctor
al researcher who worked on the proj
ect. "Because when these cells degen
erate it leads to narcolepsy."
Alexander Aravinis. a bioengi
neering postdoctoral fellow who also
worked with Deisseroth's team, ex

plained the conclusions drawn from
the research.
"There were two important contri
butions of the paper." he said. "One
was scientific, the other was technical.
We were able to show the connection
between hypocretin and sleep arousal
unequivocally, which furthers our un
derstanding of how sleep works."
The researchers used a novel tech
nique that involved shining a fiber
optic light in the brains of the mice to
stimulate the proper cells.This "opto
genetic" technique was previously
developed by another team led by
Deisseroth.
In this research. Deisseroth's team
was able to alter animal behavior. By
stimulating specific cells, the group
was able to gain real-time access into
animal brain processes.
The technique has a number of ad
vantages according to Adamantidis.
"First, there is the time scale." he
said. "Using electrons and drugs is
much slower; cells respond immedi
ately to the light. And because the ge
netic technique only changes certain
cells, this process is quite accurate."
Adamantidis and Aravinis agreed
that the research has vast implications
for the future.
"We can see this research might re
sult in treatment of sleep, wakefulness
and Parkinson's disease." Aravinis
said. "In addition, there are hundreds
of other problems you could use this
technique for."
Adamanantidis acknowledged
that the technology may have every
day uses as well.
"In the future we might have a
transmitter in'your pocket that wakes
you up or makes you feel good." he
said. "It's a bit of science fiction."
