## Editorial Board Commendable stewardship 
### 
It's no secret that Stanford has a massive
operating budget. According to the Stan
ford Management Company, the Uni
versity's endowment hovers around $18 bil
lion. That figure makes us seem less like a
'Farm' and more like an empire. In fact, ad
justed for inflation, Stanford's annual oper
ating budget exceeds that of the Roman
Empire at the height of its glory. Disagree
ments about the proper investment and
usage of those funds have fueled many cam
pus controversies, and in the midst of the po
litical fracas that can ensue about where the
money goes, it is easy to overlook the
processes that bring the money in. Stanford
has an excellent program of fund steward
ship; through postcards, letters, and thank
you notes, administrators create relation
ships with sponsors who could just as easily
become anonymous checkbooks.
Many students at Stanford are familiar
with the process of churning out hand-writ
ten notes to thank sponsors who have
helped fund a student group, paid for a re
markable opportunity or footed the bill of a
scholarship fund. Although these letter scan
seem tedious or unwarranted, students on
sports teams, in study abroad programs and
in all sorts of other situations are told time
and time again how much sponsors cherish
them.
From a student perspective, financial aid
can seem like a machine wrapped in enig
ma. However, a brief encounter with Mary
Morrison, the Director of Funds Manage
ment at the Financial Aid Office, reveals
that despite managing huge spreadsheets,
this woman remembers the names, and
often the stories, of the students she works
for. Although it can be easy to take the sin

ister stance that all this amounts to the use
of student labor to grow The Stanford
Fund,coming face to face with sponsors and
administrators alike reminds us of the in
credible privilege it is to have the opportu
nities that are available to us at Stanford. It
reminds us of the monetary funds and
human labor that goes into making our
daily experiences possible and instills a nec
essary shot of reality and respect.
Palm trees don't grow out of nowhere
and neither do the incredible opportunities
that we have for international travel and in
dividual research. Allowing students to
briefly step out of our worlds and take a re
flective glance at the larger systems at work
in making it possible is a responsible and
commendable exercise.
To speak more broadly, we live in an in
creasingly affluent society. Philanthropy,
and all of the potential that comes with it for
non-participatory self-congratulatory giv
ing is a fact of that society. While there are
those who would maintain that any philan
thropy is better than none, poorly directed
money can lead to dangerous back-patting
for barely bandaging a gaping wound that
continues to exist in society. When relation
ships aren't built, money tossed at non-prof
it institutions becomes an easy way to estab
lish benevolence,justify wealth.and assuage
discomfort over social inequalities. Promot
ing responsible philanthropy may not seem
like the hottest of political and social issues.
But. by demanding that the exchange of
money have a personal touch to it.the indi
viduals who orchestrate the stewardship
programs at Stanford try to inject humanity
into the exchange of large sums of money,
and there is value in that exercise.
