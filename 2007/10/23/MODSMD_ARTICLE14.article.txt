# Fish Out of Water
## Not my midterm 
### 
There comes a time in everyone's sen
ior fall, when they look at their antici
pated Slavic Languages and Litera
tures degree, and realize that, they are —
surprise — un-hirable.
Having found myself in such a position
recently, I decided to take a few midterms
last week to see a.) if I had any skills, and b.)
if such skills were actually applicable to the
real world.
True, up until then, my only non-lan
guage Stanford exams had been for Sociolo
gy. Statistics. and.er... IHUM. Nevertheless,
I refused to let a little inexperience deter
me. and chipperly headed off to my very
first, real midterms. Real, that is, unless you
count the fact that they weren't actually
mine.
First up on the agenda was Physics 21:
Mechanics and Heat..
The good news for this test was that I had
taken AP Physics in high school. 'ITie bad
news was that the only thing I could actual
ly remember about the class was sitting at
the kitchen table crying about it.
It was in a throwback to such Physics
glory days that I entered a packed Hewlett
201, confronted with a hundred students
who had already begun their exams. After 1
had spent five minutes pathetically looping
around the auditorium, a guy. whom my
now-estranged freshman roommate once
hooked up with, took pity on me. ITic tests
were out the door,downstairs,outside, in an
other part of the building. Duh.
Now I really felt like an idiot. A feeling
that continued once I actually started taking
the test. Nevermind the fact that I didn't
bring a calculator, it soon became clear that
a formula sheet is no help at all. if you don't
know what the symbols in the formulas
stand for.
Luckily,my Math 53: Ordinary Differen
tial Equations with Linear Algebra exam
the next day was calculator and formula
sheet-free. While the student competition
for this test looked a bit fiercer (the most
popular kid in the room was the one wearing
a "Periodic Table and Chairs" T-shirt), the
professor, at least, seemed to be on my side.
"It's not each of you competing with each
other," he promised us. "It's each of you
competing against yourselves."
TTiis was got >d news for me.since the clos
est I'd ever come to this course was a Math
42 class in which I had lasted for less than
two weeks. The same Math 42 class that was

the prerequisite for this class's prerequisite.
Fortunately, things started looking lip,
when,soon into the test. I brilliantly remem
bered the quadratic formula. And proceed
ed to use it indiscriminately for every... sin
gle... problem.
Consulting with my roommate after the
midterm, it quickly became clear that my
brilliance had been deterred by two unfor
tunate mistakes. First off, all of the infinity
signs I had seen on the exam had, in fact,
been lambdas. Secondly, most of my an
swers, which looked something like "ft +
(Ax 2 + 8.\)2/.} - x (2A + B) = 0", weren't re
ally answers at all.
Lambda your mom. See how far the real
answers get you when you're stepping over
dead bodies in the Moscow metro. (Yeah,
I've been there.)
Luckily, my next (and final) exam was
Engineering 14, titled Applied Mechanics:
Statics, and unlike with my old friends Math
and Science, here. I had pure beginner's luck
on my side.
For a valiant 45 minutes, I bravely tussled
with things called "rigid linkages," and "mo
ments of couplings," and emerged in the end
with... a test covered with doodles.
Besides beefing up my art skills, the exam
also gave me the chance to test my aptitude
for guessing — specifically in regards to
drawing some so-called FBDs. Thanks to
Wikipedia, I now know that FBD stands for
"Free Body Diagram." However, for the
test's bonus question regarding a cyclist in a
questionable state of static equilibrium, it
seemed then that the acronym could only
stand for "Ferocious Bicycling Disaster."
Needless to say, my resulting F BD was
not pretty. For that matter, neither were any
of my three test papers.
Clearly, there's a reason why a Slavic
Languages and Literatures Department ex
ists, after all.

Think it's unethical to take other people's
midterms? Send similar Fish ()ut of Water
