# Pleading Inanity
## An 8-track mind

Undergrads, sweeties, go to youi rooms
and play with your Xhoxes for a sec
ond, okay? This is a time for some
adult talk. If you're good and quiet, I'll let
you use Google without Safe Search tonight.
Graduate students, let's have a chat. It's
been a while since we had a good heart-to
heart; it's pretty difficult to coordinate com
munication across 60+ departments, seven
professional schools and countless signifi
cant others.TTius, on these rare opportunities
that we do come together en masse, it be
hooves us to address those issues that
uniquely pertain to us as older, but not quite
that old. people on a campus — and. increas
ingly, a world — that is obsessed with the
young.
I've been experiencing a bit of anxiety as
of late, and in mv conversations with many of

you, I've found that you share my symptoms.
For a while, this nebulous unease had no
label, and I wondered what exactly had
seized my mojo.To address this issue. I first
did what any sophisticated intellectual would
do: I went to WebMD and typed in my symp
toms. Turns out I had some mix of indiges
tion. MSRA, and chlamydia.
After medications and treatments for
those illnesses failed to heal me, I turned to

the wisdom of the masses: Wikipedia. At that
point, 1 happened upon the concept that ac
curately describes my confusion and touches
on problems that many graduate students
are going through: the "quarterlife crisis."
Although the term didn't gain notoriety
until the publication of Abby Wilner's 2(X)1
work with the same title, quarterlife crises
are certainly nothing new. I mean. Life was
marketed by Milton Bradley in l%3,and the
quarter had its first run in 17%. Nonetheless,
this crisis is worth our discussion because, for
us at least, it is fresh and clamoring for re
dress.
In short, the root of much of our graduate
student angst is the fact that — unlike most
people — we aren't as young as we used to
