# Pleading Inanity
## An 8-track mind 
### 
Undergrads, sweeties, go to youi rooms
and play with your Xhoxes for a sec
ond, okay? This is a time for some
adult talk. If you're good and quiet, I'll let
you use Google without Safe Search tonight.
Graduate students, let's have a chat. It's
been a while since we had a good heart-to
heart; it's pretty difficult to coordinate com
munication across 60+ departments, seven
professional schools and countless signifi
cant others.TTius, on these rare opportunities
that we do come together en masse, it be
hooves us to address those issues that
uniquely pertain to us as older, but not quite
that old. people on a campus — and. increas
ingly, a world — that is obsessed with the
young.
I've been experiencing a bit of anxiety as
of late, and in mv conversations with many of

you, I've found that you share my symptoms.
For a while, this nebulous unease had no
label, and I wondered what exactly had
seized my mojo.To address this issue. I first
did what any sophisticated intellectual would
do: I went to WebMD and typed in my symp
toms. Turns out I had some mix of indiges
tion. MSRA, and chlamydia.
After medications and treatments for
those illnesses failed to heal me, I turned to

the wisdom of the masses: Wikipedia. At that
point, 1 happened upon the concept that ac
curately describes my confusion and touches
on problems that many graduate students
are going through: the "quarterlife crisis."
Although the term didn't gain notoriety
until the publication of Abby Wilner's 2(X)1
work with the same title, quarterlife crises
are certainly nothing new. I mean. Life was
marketed by Milton Bradley in l%3,and the
quarter had its first run in 17%. Nonetheless,
this crisis is worth our discussion because, for
us at least, it is fresh and clamoring for re
dress.
In short, the root of much of our graduate
student angst is the fact that — unlike most
people — we aren't as young as we used to


i
Vishnu
Sridharan
be.This means that our bodies might
not be able to do what they used to,
at least not with aches and pains the
next morning. Ihis also means that
our pop cultural references are
dated; whenever 1 splice one of
F.dna's didactic witticisms from 'The
Facts of Life" into conversation, or
pop out a classic 'What you talkin
'bout Willis?', the blank stares with
which I'm greeted make me feel like
I'm talking about geopolitics or neo
conservativism.
Undergrads! Are you fighting in
there? Share the controllers, OK?
And no biting!
Kids.
Anyway, most significant about
being older is that our decisions have
a greater gravitas to them. As under
grads, our choices could be free from
practical constraints: I studied Phi
losophy, for God's sake. Nowadays,
however, the things we do and peo
ple we associate with have strong im
plications for the people we will be
for the rest of our lives.

For instance, the job 1 take this
summer will likely be the job I have
after graduation, which will deter
mine, among other things, where 1
live, how often I can visit my parents
and brother, and what my social life
will look like. Most obviously, my job
after graduation might be my job
forever. Forever, like, for more than
six years!
Speaking of family, those of us
who are thinking about having one
at some point, well, those thoughts
creep into our psyche more often
nowadays. Are we still content to
breeze through casual relationships,
or, probably more applicable to
graduate students, to focus on our
studies and let romantic affairs (not)
work themselves out? The people
that we date at this age, may, dare I
say it, turn out to be our life partners.
You know how long the average life
partnership lasts? Almost 10 years!
Wow, I feel a bit overwhelmed.
The responsibilities of the real world
are approaching, and most likely
they've already arrived. Lucky for
you I've figured it out: we just
