# Op-Ed
## The 						eye in policy 
### 
The Roosevelt Institution is a non-prof
it, non-partisan student-run think tank
that spreads policy ideas from stu
dents to local, state and national legislatures.
Our organization connects the fruits of stu
dent policy research to the policy process,de
livering sound, progressive proposals to pol
icymakers and advocacy groups at all levels
of government.
This year, we strive to bring that policy di
rectly to the Stanford community through a
weekly op-ed. Beginning next week, we will
highlight the progressive policy that students
find pressing. Written by our policy develop
ment team, which consists of diverse fellows,
we will discuss changes in fields from energy
and the environment, to foreign policy,
health, economics and education. ITirough
these op-eds. we hope to inspire student de

bate on pressing issues and encourage more
development and outreach of student ideas
to the policy elite.
Aside from these op-eds, our chapter this
year at Stanford is focused on two areas: pol
icy development and outreach. And as a
growing organization, we always look for
passionate students ready and willing to
have their ideas affect the world. Fellow po
sitions entail writing op-eds that are pub
lished weekly in The Daily, as well as in na
tional newspapers such as The New York
l imes and San Francisco Chronicle. Fellows
also attend national conferences to present
their policy research, and submit their pieces
to national publications read by legislatures
around the nation.
In addition to policy promotion, we are
looking to further our outreach to local poli

cymakers around the region. In the past, stu
dents have served as consultants to members
of the state legislature who are eager to get
ideas from future leaders. Outreach also
works with the national Roosevelt Institu
tion to put on and fly students out to region
al and nationwide events. We are excited to
begin setting up a list of students to send to
an upcoming event, the Western Regional
Policy Hxpo in Las Vegas, which invites stu
dents from around the country to participate
in working groups with those that pass policy
for a living.
Outreach is also evident in our commit
ment to teaching students to write policy.
Last year, we launched our Student Initiated
C ourse on how to write policy, inviting a
number of professors and legisla
tures to discuss with students the ne
cessity and the intricacies of the pol
icy process. This year, we intend to
continue our success with the class
during the spring quarter to again
encourage students to write and de
velop their ideas to policy-makers
that yearn for them.
To frame our policy development
during the year, each summer the na
tional student membership of the
Roosevelt Institution meets to select
three pressing policy challenges. This
coming year's challenges are no dif
ferent. The first involves building
strong communities,an endeavor that
is central to the progressive vision of
America. An individual can only de
velop through the diverse contribu
tions of a whole community, one that
includes healthy physical, human, and
economic landscapes. Without the
opportunity to participate in and give
back to one's community, an individ
ual cannot be truly fulfilled.
The second challenge encourages
domestic and foreign policy options
that will make democracy work. Un
derpinning all other progressive pol
icy in America — and at the core of
Roosevelt's statement of principles
— is the idea that citizens have the
power and ability to reshape their
government for the better. Today,
unfortunately, many barriers stand
in the way of political participation,
turning people away and shutting
them out of the political process.
The final challenge of the year is
to strive to improve the justice sys
tem. Crime is an incredibly destruc
tive force in our communities, rav
aging economies and destroying
families. Unfortunately, the criminal
justice system too often serves mere
ly to exacerbate these problems.
Harsh incarceration policies do not
treat addiction, nor do they offer the

education and social rehabilitation
that could help improve lives; in
stead, these policies suck up budget
dollars and destroy career opportu
nities for incarcerated individuals. It
is imperative that we create policy to
improve what is now an ineffective
and often detrimental system.
The Roosevelt Institution began
in 2004 at Stanford and Yale; our
founders conceived its model to
train and empower students in the
policymaking process, making it pos
sible for young people to effect real
change in American politics, ITiese
founding members understood the
need for a student voice in the poli
cymaking process, from the genesis
of ideas in academia to their imple
mentation through local, state and
national governments.
Since its inception, the Roosevelt
Institution has grown to become a
national network around the coun
try with more than 7,(KK) student
members. Together, these students
publish numerous policy and re
search journals, advance dozens of
legislative goals, and hold countless
meetings, panels and conferences
every year. During the past three
years, Roosevelt members have held
meetings on Capitol Hill, testified to
city councils and reached out and
worked directly in their communi
ties. The model conceived by Roo
sevelt's founding members has
spawned an organization that is al
ways growing, always evolving, and
always looking toward the future.
Everyone at the Roosevelt Insti
tution is looking forward to a year of
continued success. If you are inspired
to change the world and are interest
ed in joining or participating in our
organization, please e-mail

And continue to look back for more
policy in our op-eds throughout the
year.

is imperative that we create policy to
improve what is now an ineffective
and often detrimental system.
The Roosevelt Institution began
in 2004 at Stanford and Yale; our
founders conceived its model to
train and empower students in the
policymaking process, making it pos
sible for young people to effect real
change in American politics, ITiese
founding members understood the
need for a student voice in the poli
cymaking process, from the genesis
of ideas in academia to their imple
mentation through local, state and
national governments.
Since its inception, the Roosevelt
Institution has grown to become a
national network around the coun
try with more than 7,(KK) student
members. Together, these students
publish numerous policy and re
search journals, advance dozens of
legislative goals, and hold countless
meetings, panels and conferences
every year. During the past three
years, Roosevelt members have held
meetings on Capitol Hill, testified to
city councils and reached out and
worked directly in their communi
ties. The model conceived by Roo
sevelt's founding members has
spawned an organization that is al
ways growing, always evolving, and
always looking toward the future.
Everyone at the Roosevelt Insti
tution is looking forward to a year of
continued success. If you are inspired
to change the world and are interest
ed in joining or participating in our
organization, please e-mail
ssarin@stanford.edu to get involved.
And continue to look back for more
policy in our op-eds throughout the
year.
