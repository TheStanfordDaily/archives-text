# Op-Ed
## The
						eye in policy 
### 
The Roosevelt Institution is a non-prof
it, non-partisan student-run think tank
that spreads policy ideas from stu
dents to local, state and national legislatures.
Our organization connects the fruits of stu
dent policy research to the policy process,de
livering sound, progressive proposals to pol
icymakers and advocacy groups at all levels
of government.
This year, we strive to bring that policy di
rectly to the Stanford community through a
weekly op-ed. Beginning next week, we will
highlight the progressive policy that students
find pressing. Written by our policy develop
ment team, which consists of diverse fellows,
we will discuss changes in fields from energy
and the environment, to foreign policy,
health, economics and education. ITirough
these op-eds. we hope to inspire student de

bate on pressing issues and encourage more
development and outreach of student ideas
to the policy elite.
Aside from these op-eds, our chapter this
year at Stanford is focused on two areas: pol
icy development and outreach. And as a
growing organization, we always look for
passionate students ready and willing to
have their ideas affect the world. Fellow po
sitions entail writing op-eds that are pub
lished weekly in The Daily, as well as in na
tional newspapers such as The New York
l imes and San Francisco Chronicle. Fellows
also attend national conferences to present
their policy research, and submit their pieces
to national publications read by legislatures
around the nation.
In addition to policy promotion, we are
looking to further our outreach to local poli

cymakers around the region. In the past, stu
dents have served as consultants to members
of the state legislature who are eager to get
ideas from future leaders. Outreach also
works with the national Roosevelt Institu
tion to put on and fly students out to region
al and nationwide events. We are excited to
begin setting up a list of students to send to
an upcoming event, the Western Regional
Policy Hxpo in Las Vegas, which invites stu
dents from around the country to participate
in working groups with those that pass policy
for a living.
Outreach is also evident in our commit
ment to teaching students to write policy.
Last year, we launched our Student Initiated
C ourse on how to write policy, inviting a
