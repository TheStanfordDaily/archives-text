## Facebook faces suit over phone messages 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) The
popular online social network
Facebook Inc. is being sued by an
Indiana woman who alleges it has
profited from its members send
ing thousands of unauthorized
text messages to mobile phone
users whose numbers previously
belonged to other people.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in a
San Jose federal court, highlights
the confusion and frustration
that can arise as Web sites extend
their services to mobile handsets
with phone numbers that have
been reassigned, or "recycled,"
after another customer's service
ended.
Lindsey Abrams, a Patriot,
lnd., mother in her mid-20s, al
leges she began receiving unso
licited text messages apparently
intended for an unidentified
Facebook member shortly after
she received a new mobile num
ber from Verizon Communica
tions Inc. in November 2006.
The messages included ex
plicit language and unsettling re
marks, according to Abrams'
civil complaint. She alleges she
was charged 10 cents per mes
sage and told she couldn't block
the Facebook texting without
cutting off notes she wanted to
receive.
The lawsuit, which her lawyer
will seek to have certified as a

class action, contends other con
sumers with recycled phone
numbers have been besieged
with unsolicited Facebook text
messages containing party invi
tations and unwanted sexual ad
vances.
Young children have been
among the recipients of the
unauthorized Facebook mes
sages, the suit alleges, creating
"frightening and dangerous" sit
uations.
Facebook spokeswoman
Brandee Barker declined to com
ment on the allegations,citing the
Palo Alto-based company's poli
cy not to discuss lawsuits.
The complaint against Face
book's 18-month-old mobile
messaging service comes less
than a week after the privately
held startup reached an agree
ment with New York State Attor
ney General Andrew Cuomo to
step up its policing efforts to pro
tect minors from sexual preda
tors and inappropriate content
on its Web site.
Jay Edelson, a Chicago attor
ney representing Abrams, said he
hopes to force Facebook to take
steps so its roughly 47 million
members won't be able to send
text messages to recycled phone
numbers.
"There are things that Face
book could be doing to prevent
this from happening," Adelson
said. "Hopefully, this suit will give
them the incentive to stop it."
