# CAMPUS LIFE
## New Web site promotes healthy living Wellness Web site brings together social networking and fitness 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
Yesterday marked the official kick-off of the Be-
Well@Stanford initiative, a program designed to bring
together campus fitness outreach under one umbrella
and "create a culture of wellness for the Stanford
community."
Central to the plan is the Be Well Web site â€” be
well.stanford.edu. The site applies the techniques of
social networking to wellness and fitness. Similar to
popular sites like Facebook and You Tube, users can
share stories and comments, create groups and post
news or videos.
"1 think it will be a good place for people to try new
things and connect with people who are at the same
stage as them," said Susi Smith '08, the Peer Health
Educator (PHE) in Toyon."The cooperative element
is great."
The site launched with an established 200-person
user base of beta testers, who have so far provided ad
vice on diverse topics including healthy weight loss,
salsa instruction and the best time to eat vegetables.
"This is a huge milestone," said Senior Associate
Athletic Director Eric Stein, who oversaw the devel
opment of the program with Jennifer Sexton, coordi-
nator of fitness and wellness pro
grams.
"I came here one and three-quar
ters years ago from Princeton," Stein
said. "From day one the goal has
been a University-wide wellness
program."
BeWell has a range of associated
departments, including the School of
Medicine, the Office for Religious

Life and the Athletics Department.
"We're bringing together a lot of
silos in a combined and concentrated
way." Stein said.
While these departments will re
tain their individual Internet pres
ences, BeWell's planners intend to
combine them on the BeWell site as
well.
"We don't want to be just a link
off the recreation site," Sexton said.
Stein said the BeWell site would
be more than just a place to retrieve
information on the Internet.
"There are static sites like
WebMD where you go, you get the

information and then you leave," he
said. "We want this to be a place
where people stay and contribute.
We're hoping for a culture to devel
op that supports well-being."
The specifics of the Be Well Web
site fell into place over the summer.
Stanford administrators ultimately
selected a platform developed by
Wellsphere, a San Mateo company
that focuses on building health
conscious communities on the In
ternet.
"Stanford had a vision in mind on
how to do it,"said Ron Gutman GSB
'05, the company's founder and

CEO. "We had the technology."
Operating on the same architec
ture, BeWell and the official Well
sphere site are intentionally similar
in look and feel.
Publicity surrounding yesterday's
BeWell kick-off included a mailing
to faculty and advance notice of the
site for PHEs.
"We're continuing to look for
new ways to evolve," Stein said. "But
we're viewing this as a new begin
ning."

At the kick-off event for the BeWell Campaign yesterday afternoon, two enthusiasts show off t-shirts with the campaign's pithy mission statement. BeWell hopes
to be the campus hub for students, staff and faculty to share information about healthy living, eating and exercise.
