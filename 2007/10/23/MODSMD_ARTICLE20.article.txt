Spreading bike etiquette
To the editor:
High fives to the West Flo R As for
setting an example by wearing bike
helmets. And ditto to ITie Daily for
putting it on the front page.These ac
tions prompt me share the following:
Yesterday, as I pedaled behind a
walking student and prepared to
pass him, I called out in a clear and
cheerful voice,"Passing on your left,
please.Thank you."
The student moved aside then
shouted after me. "That was fantas
tic! What a great idea! That is the first
time I've heard anyone say that on
this campus."
In a community where bikers and
walkers share crowded paths, these
simple words do what bells or whis

ties do not: Ihey courteously alert
people who do not see you and give
them an instant mental picture of the
path you w ill travel. My experience is
that pedestrians are glad for the po
lite request; without breaking stride,
they easily adjust their path to ac
commodate us both.There is no star
tled reaction or physical confusion
about how to share the road.
So, in addition to wearing those
helmets to avoid injury, let's adapt
this pro-active bike/talk/listen/walk
protocol. It is a simple, friendly idea
that could, like helmets, become part
of our campus culture. If you bike,
just start doing it. Spread the word.
Ihanks.
