## Dynamite at Dino Cup Stanford wins three to take tournament title in Canada 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Taking home only its second Husky Dino
Cup title in 12 years, Stanford men's volleyball
opened its exhibition season last weekend
with a bang.
Playing across the border in Canada, the
Cardinal won the round-robin tournament
with three victories against the University of
Calgary, the University of Alberta and the
University of the Pacific. Stanford beat Cal
gary in four games. Alberta in five and Pacific
in four.
"We had a great performance," head coach
John Kosty said." We played against some very
good competition and rose to the occasion."
"Our performance was dramatically im
proved from last year's outing," sophomore

outside hitter Jason Palacios added. "We were
very aggressive with our serving. We had great,
great passing the entire weekend."
The biggest win of the weekend came when
the Cardinal outlasted the University of Al
berta squad on Friday. Coming into the match.
Alberta had an astounding 24-game win streak
against Stanford's conference, the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF).The MPSF
is the most dominant in all of NCAA men's
volleyball, so Stanford came into the match
facing daunting odds.
However, the Cardinal was able to put to
gether one of its best performances in years,
and came away with the win after a dramatic
fifth game.
"We put together a really solid perform
ance in the fifth game," Kosty said.
"I would say they were a very talented
team," Palacios said. "More experienced and a
better team than we were. During that game we
just played really well. It's really uplifting for our
team that we beat a team like Alberta."

GAME NOTES: Following a season that saw Stanford win
three matches, the Cardinal got off to a good start in
2007, winning all three of its matches at the Husky
Dino Cup in Canada. Stanford beat Calgary, Fbcific
and Alberta en route to the tournament title. It was the
first loss for Canadian powerhouse Alberta, which has
tallied six wins over American colleges this year, includ
ing a sweep of 2007 NCAA Champ UC Irvine. Stan
ford will host a day-long tournament next month and
then play at the UCSB Elephant Bar tourney in January
before starting the regular season.

Sophomore right side Evan Romero was the top attacker for the Cardinal in the Husky Dino Cup, leading the team in kills in its three victories.
Romero, libero Jordan Inafuku and setter Kawika Shoji were named to the All-Tournament team, with Shoji named Most Outstanding Player.
Although the tournament
championship was a team effort for
the Cardinal, the team saw stand
out performances from several in
dividuals.
Sophomore setter Kawika Shoji
was named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player, while sophomore
right-side hitter Evan Romero had
more kills than any other player in
the tournament. He was named to
the all-tournament team along with
freshman libero Jordan Inafuku.
In addition,coach Kosty made it clear
that the team wouldn't have escaped
with a win against Pacific if not for the
play of senior outside hitter Matt
Ceran.
The tournament championship
was quite the thrill for the Cardinal.
"The team feels great," Kosty ex
plained."lt's a great accomplishment.
The team feels really good about it
self. We're going back to scratch and
working on the fundamentals that we
saw needed improvement from the
tournament. We're going to build
back into the team concept as we
head towards our Nov. 17 tourna
ment [the Stanford Tournament] that
we're hosting."
"We have a chance of competing
far and beyond what we did last
year," Palacios added.
The Cardinal couldn't have start
ed its season off any better than this
weekend's results. Coming off of last
year's disappointing 3-25 season,
Stanford has already shown that it is
ready to contend in the always-strong
MPSF.
"We were a really young team last
year, and we still are this year," Pala
cios said. "A lot of the freshmen play
ing last year got a year of experience
that made them improve dramatical
ly. The freshmen that are playing this
year are very talented and they've im
proved dramatically too. Overall, ex
perience was the difference (this
weekend]."
Stanford will be on a month-long
respite from any matches before it
hosts the Stanford Tournament on
Nov. 17.
