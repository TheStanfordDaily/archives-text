## Dynamite at Dino Cup Stanford wins three to take tournament title in Canada 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Taking home only its second Husky Dino
Cup title in 12 years, Stanford men's volleyball
opened its exhibition season last weekend
with a bang.
Playing across the border in Canada, the
Cardinal won the round-robin tournament
with three victories against the University of
Calgary, the University of Alberta and the
University of the Pacific. Stanford beat Cal
gary in four games. Alberta in five and Pacific
in four.
"We had a great performance," head coach
John Kosty said." We played against some very
good competition and rose to the occasion."
"Our performance was dramatically im
proved from last year's outing," sophomore

outside hitter Jason Palacios added. "We were
very aggressive with our serving. We had great,
great passing the entire weekend."
The biggest win of the weekend came when
the Cardinal outlasted the University of Al
berta squad on Friday. Coming into the match.
Alberta had an astounding 24-game win streak
against Stanford's conference, the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF).The MPSF
is the most dominant in all of NCAA men's
volleyball, so Stanford came into the match
facing daunting odds.
However, the Cardinal was able to put to
gether one of its best performances in years,
and came away with the win after a dramatic
fifth game.
"We put together a really solid perform
ance in the fifth game," Kosty said.
"I would say they were a very talented
team," Palacios said. "More experienced and a
better team than we were. During that game we
just played really well. It's really uplifting for our
team that we beat a team like Alberta."
