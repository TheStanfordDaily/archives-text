Comment
D wins titles: 0 scores 10 net points (24, less two TOs
for TDs) vs. MSU, but D gives up just 3.
Who else? Two top-10 wins (VT, Florida), should be
back if they win out.
Too close for comfort against lowa State, but at least
they're consistent.
Tebow jumps (literally) to the Heisman lead with Hart
injured, BCidle.
Trojans might have just found a QB in Mark Sanchez.
Irish now 1-7.
Nation's most underrated team today, but should show
the world vs. BC Thursday.
D never got off the plane in Seattle, but school-record
465 rush yards — Wow!
U-M and Buckeyes now two games up on Big-10 field.
Title comes down to Nov. 17.
Smoked Mississippi State, great, but now Louisville,
Rutgers, Cincinnati.
Impressive undressing of Texas Tech. No toughies left,
so how good are these guys?
Ugly yet again in Baylor win. After eight games, when
is that no longer a fluke?
BCS to Holiday Bowl. Broadcaster Starkey's UCLA call
was priceless schaudenfraude.
Next four: Cal, Oregon, UCLA, USC. My guess: 1 -3 and
unranked by Thanksgiving.
Underrated? Tennessee win might not be all that good,
LSU in two weeks will tell.
Hanging 37 on Florida earns respect. Allowing 45?
Pity. D not quite fast enough yet.
Last week: "Most overrated team at No. 5." Yup, but
played well in Rutgers L.
This week: "Most overrated at BCS No. 2." Still could
win the joke that is the ACC.
Held McFadden to 43 yards last week, hung within six
of LSU this week. No shame.
Poof, there goes the SEC East lead in Vanderbilt shock
er. Was a BCS contender, too.
D made a statement in 19-14 win in Boulder. Missouri
finale for Big 12 North crown?
Might be the last undefeated left standing. Who'd have
guessed that in summer?
800 for allowing Indiana 31, but OSU visits Saturday
and Happy Valley's mighty tough.
No shame in 5-2 in SEC, except best win is who? Ten
nessee? Real games on deck.
Just one loss and undefeated in ACC, but hasn't beaten
anyone.
Also considered: Texas A&M, Rutgers, Connecticut,
Wake Forest. One crazy year.
