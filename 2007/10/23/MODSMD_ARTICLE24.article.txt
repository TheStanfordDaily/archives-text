## Thanks for the memories, Mr. Torre 
### 
My mentor has left. Since I can re
member, he's been my teacher,
role model and source of inspira
tion and strength. He's led me through the
good, the bad and the ugly, always standing
tall, never acquiescing. I've celebrated with
him and cried with him. but no longer.
Next season, for the first time since 1 1 )95.
Joe Torre will not be managing the New
York Yankees. I am sad and fearful about
what lies ahead; I have lost my guide. This
emotional, perhaps melodramatic response
may seem strange to both casual sports fans
and diehard supporters of other teams —
it's not as if I actually know this man But in
recent years, few fan bases have had the
same connection to a manager as Yankee
fans have had to Joe Torre.
Though I'm no business maven, it seems
that in terms of managerial turnover rates,
the sports industry is like few others. Coach
es are routinely fired after two. maybe three
seasons and as a result, fans rarely develop
a bond with them. A select group of fans do
— Pittsburgh Steelers fans did with coach
Bill Cowher; Atlanta Braves supporters do
with manager Bobby Cox. And even
though college coaches generally have
longer shelf lives than their professional
counterparts, lifelong Stanford supporters
surely felt this way with former basketball
coach Mike Montgomery, who led the Car
dinal for 19 years.
Torre coached for 12 seasons, cementing
himself in the Yankee family. I le is the only
Yankee manager 1 remember — I was six

when he was hired. So while other teams I
supported replaced their coaches every few
years,Torre stayed constant, almost a father
figure to thousands of fans, myself included.
I lis stoic figure on the bench became iconic
and his leadership legendary.
He commanded respect from his players
— Derek Jeter, the "Yankee Captain," al
ways referred to him as Mr. Torre — but
never failed to reciprocate. He defended his
men from the rabid New York media, al
ways dealing with reporters calmly and
squashing potential stories before they
came to fruition. He was the gel in the club
house. an elegant and wise patriarch who
mitigated every dispute to build a close-knit
unit.
The fans were part of this group. Like
families used to listen to Roosevelt's
Fireside Chats, we watched Yankee
games, hoping to glean any knowl
edge we could from Torre and his
team. We celebrated with him as we
won World Championships; we
cried with him while he and pitching
coach Mel Stottlemyre fought their
cancers. Through it all, true Yankee
fans never left his side, never doubt
ed him: when we would hit a slide,
we were still confident. Because no
matter what, Torre would handle it.
And in almost every case, he did.
This year, Torre's decision-mak
ing — especially in regards to the
bullpen — came under fire. People
wondered aloud if it was time to
move on. But when the Yankees hit
their low point (14.5 games back in
the AL East), it was Torre who held
the team together and guided them
back into competition and eventual
ly to a playoff berth.
No longer will we have that force.
Next year, someone new, someone
different, will manage the Yankees.
Torre was known more for his inter
personal relations than his in-game
managing — will our next manager
fit this mold? Will he spar publicly
with the Steinbrenners, as so many
coaches before Torre did? Will he
win over and lead his players? And
the eternal question: will he bring us
World Series championships?
The three frontrunners for the
job — former Florida Marlins man
ager Joe Girardi, former Royals
coach Tony Pena and Yankees leg
end Don Mattingly — all coached
under Torre. They reflect the para
mount ideal Torre stood for: class
and professionalism, always. In fact,
part of the reason why Girardi was
fired from the Marlins despite win
ning Manager of the Year was be
cause of a dispute with owner Jef
frey Loria over Loria's rude behav
ior during a game.
They are gentlemen with a deep
knowledge of and respect for the
game. Any would be a suitable re
placement. But I never thought that
word — replacement — would have
to be muttered so soon.Torre could
n't come to terms on a new contract
with Yankee management, and so in
the blink of an eye — after a transac
tion that seems far too business-like
for such a situation — he is gone.
I have not just lost my team's
manager. I have lost my teacher.
Every fan base should be privy to
long tenures of good coaching, be
cause no matter your team's issues,
you know one thing will always be
secure. But this feeling of despair
and sadness when the run is over is
one 1 would not wish on any fan.
