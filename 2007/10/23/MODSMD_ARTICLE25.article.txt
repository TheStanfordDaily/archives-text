# Stanford comes up short against Long Beach
## No. 2 water polo falls to 1-2 in MPSF with 7-5 loss 
### KENAN JIANG 
The second-ranked Stanford men's water
polo team lost a nail-biter at No. 6 Long Beach
State in a league contest this weekend, falling
by a score of 6-4. Later that afternoon, the
Cardinal beat Occidental, 17-6. in a friendly
game.
ITie Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) loss to the 49ers dropped the Cardi
nal's record to 1-2 in conference play, and 8-5
overall, as the team suffered its first loss to the
49ers in 11 games, a streak dating back to 2(XX).
A major disadvantage for the Cardinal came
from six separate six-on-five matchups result
ing from penalties during the third quarter.The
49ers were able to capitalize on four of their six
extra-man possessions.
"We played hard today, but I think the differ
ence between victory and loss was not being
able to go six-on-six which created big prob
lems for us," senior goalkeeper Sandy 1 lohener
said.
Junior utility Will Hindle-Katel scored 30
seconds into the game to give the Cardinal the
early lead. Sophomore utility Sage Wright
scored in the last seconds of the first quarter to
put Stanford up 3-2. With goals from junior
driver Andrew Drake, senior two-meter de
fender Ryan Fortune and freshman driver Alex
Pulido as well, the Cardinal was able to hold off
the 49ers until the end of the third quarter.
"1 think we played well, but they beat us tac
tically," Wright said. "We're going to have to ex
ecute better fundamentally to win. We executed
what we worked on during practice, focused on
defense, but we needed to step up offensively."
Despite Hohener's best efforts and II
blocked shots. Long Beach had its own defen
sive presence and held the Cardinal scoreless in
the second period, as the 49ers' offense scored
twice to make the score 4-3 at halftime.

GAME NO! ES: Despite being ranked second in the nation,
the Cardinal men have only one conference win in three
games. The team will try to rebound from an upset loss to
Long Beach State at home next weekend, hosting No. 8
UC Santa Barbara, who also has a sole MPSF victory.

sometimes things just don't work out for us."
1 lohener said.
The 49ers clamped down on defense, espe
cially during the third quarter.and limited Stan
ford to only one goal from five extra-man ad
vantages while Long Beach State converted
four of its six chances.The 4 ( )ers made very few
mistakes down the stretch, as Stanford missed a
series of opportunities midway through the
third quarter, most of them resulting from the
Long Beach's pressure on the ball.
"I think we played fundamentally sound

water polo today, and hopefully we will do bet
ter in [our other) MPSF games, where it's just
one game a day," said senior Peter Finlayson.
"[They] put us into a different mindset and we
weren't able to execute our game plan."
The fourth quarter saw Pulido tie the game
with a long-range shot at s:29.That would be the
last score for the Cardinal for the rest of the
game. Long Beach's Reid Tomassi scored a sec
ond goal at 4:47 and Joe Kinne converted an
extra-man goal with 58 seconds left to put the
Stanford team away.
The loss was a particularly tough one as

Stanford needs to have a winning record in the
MPSFin order to advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships. Although the Cardinal is still No. 2 in
the nation. No. 3 Cal and No. 4 UCLA are close
behind. However. Stanford has not beaten top
ranked IJSC in two years, suffering three losses
to the Trojans already this season.
The Cardinal next hosts UC-Santa Barbara
in its first home game in a month. Pepperdine
will visit the following day. Both games will be
MPSF contests.
