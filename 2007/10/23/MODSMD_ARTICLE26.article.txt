# Golf a disappointing ninth at home tournament
## Mari Chun leads Stanford with her top-10 finish 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team finished
ninth at the Stanford Intercollegiate this
weekend to wrap up a tumultuous fall season.
Though they will continue to practice, the Car
dinal will not compete again until the
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in
February.
"To look at it objectively, this definitely was
n't our best performance," said junior Ki-Shui
Liao of the team's fall finale.
No. 4 Arizona State won the tournament by
edging No. 1 Duke — who led through the first
and second rounds — on the final day. No. 2
UCLA placed third.
Despite the poor finish, the Cardinal golfers
lowered their team score after each round of
the tournament, rising four spots from their
13th place standing after the first day.
"We didn't have a good first day and it set us
pretty far back." Liao said. "We did improve
every day and we fought hard to move up."
The Cardinal was led. once again, by junior
Mari Chun, who shot a season-low 68 on Friday
and finished at four-over-par for the tourna
ment, good for eighth place in the individual
rankings.
"Mari played awesome this week and we re
ally depended on her." said Liao.
Sophomore Catherina Wang and freshman
Rebecca Durham each shot 22-over. while
sophomore Angela King and Liao shot 24-over
and 26-over, respectively. Playing individually,
freshman Piper Miller finished at 32-over-par,
and senior Saana Rapakko ended at 38-ovcr.
"I think we all feel that we could have defi
nitely played better."said Liao."l felt like I had
a lot of chances to make birdies and shoot a
good score, but I was never really able to get it
done."
Hut No. 21 Stanford did finish ahead of high
er-ranked opponents such as No. 12 Vanderbilt,
who won the tournament last year, and No. 16
New Mexico. The Cardinal, though, were not
paying much attention to their competition.
"We've played against these teams before,"
said Liao. "I think we're mainly focused on our
own games and beating the golf course."

Despite better knowledge of its home course
than any other team, the Cardinal was still un
able to conquer it. Liao attributed this to faster
greens and thicker roughs than usual.
"The course was definitely playing harder
than the past two years I've been here," she said.
As a result, the Cardinal had a hard time
with their putting, a problem which has plagued
them throughout the fall season.

The short game is one of the many things the
team will work on during the winter. Addition
ally. they will try to improve their swing me
chanics. Due to a hectic fall schedule of four
tournaments in live weeks, the Cardinal rarely
got an opportunity to work on that aspect of
their game.
"The great thing about golf is that you're
never truly satisfied with how you played, so

there's always room for improvement,' said
Liao.
The team will also hit the gym "to get as
physically in shape as possible by February,"
said Liao.
Stanford will also continue to nurse injuries
that affected several players during the fall sea
son.
lliough the fall season has been disappoint
ing — Stanford will likely fall out of the top 25
in the Golf World/Nike poll after their perform
ance this weekend — the Cardinal is,by its own
admission — a second-half team.
"We are strong in the spring and postsea
son," Chun said in an earlier interview.
But they will have to improve if they are to
equal or surpass last year's fifth-place finish in
the NCAA Tournament.
"We can perform just as well, or better, than
last year." Chun said.
Iliis remains to be seen, though; come Feb
ruary, the Cardinal will have to prove it on the
course.
