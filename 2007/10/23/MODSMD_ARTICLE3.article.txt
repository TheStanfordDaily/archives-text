## 2006 Nobel winner discusses politics, novel as art form 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
"Our happiness and unhappiness is derived not
from life itself, but from the meaning we give it."
Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk told a packed
Memorial Auditorium yesterday evening. "I've de
voted my life to exploring that meaning."
Pamuk. who won the 2006 Nobel Prize in litera
ture.spoke for 40 minutes to an audience comprised
mostly of faculty and older community members
about a wide array of subjects, including politics,
"the East-West question" and. primarily, the novel
as an art form.
The author's visit — co-sponsored by a number
of campus organizations, including the Mediter
ranean Studies Forum, the Abbasi Program in Is
lamic Studies and the Freeman Spogli Institute —
was part of the S.T. Lee Lecture series, which annu
ally brings a lecturer to campus to raise "public un
derstanding of the complex policy issues facing the
global community."
History Department Chair Aron Rodrigue mod
erated the talk and introduced Pamuk as his
hamshari — Turkish for countryman — explaining
that he grew up a few streets away from the author
in the same district of Istanbul.
Pamuk, who wore a gray sport coat and a green
tie, spent the bulk of his talk highlighting the impor
tance of the novel as a cultural tool and its role in
global education and international relations.
