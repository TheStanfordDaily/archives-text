# Pamuk talks novel's power
## 2006 Nobel winner discusses politics, novel as art form 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
"Our happiness and unhappiness is derived not
from life itself, but from the meaning we give it."
Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk told a packed
Memorial Auditorium yesterday evening. "I've de
voted my life to exploring that meaning."
Pamuk. who won the 2006 Nobel Prize in litera
ture.spoke for 40 minutes to an audience comprised
mostly of faculty and older community members
about a wide array of subjects, including politics,
"the East-West question" and. primarily, the novel
as an art form.
The author's visit — co-sponsored by a number
of campus organizations, including the Mediter
ranean Studies Forum, the Abbasi Program in Is
lamic Studies and the Freeman Spogli Institute —
was part of the S.T. Lee Lecture series, which annu
ally brings a lecturer to campus to raise "public un
derstanding of the complex policy issues facing the
global community."
History Department Chair Aron Rodrigue mod
erated the talk and introduced Pamuk as his
hamshari — Turkish for countryman — explaining
that he grew up a few streets away from the author
in the same district of Istanbul.
Pamuk, who wore a gray sport coat and a green
tie, spent the bulk of his talk highlighting the impor
tance of the novel as a cultural tool and its role in
global education and international relations.

Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk spoke in Memorial Auditorium last night, describing how the form of the modern
novel has been instrumental in shaping our sense of both ourselves and other peoples and cultures.
"To understand what is unique
about other cultures, other peoples,
these things we can glean only from
the careful, patient reading of great
novels," he said. "It is by reading
novels that we come to understand
the complex world in which we
live."
The Nobel laureate — Turkey's
first in any field — described novels
as "neither wholly imaginary nor
wholly real," and stressed the tran
scendent power of literature in
breaking down barriers between
novelists and their readers.
"The strange and magical rules
that govern the novel can open fam
ilies, homes, cities in a way that can
allow people to see their own fami
lies, homes, cities," Pamuk said in his
pronounced Turkish accent. "The
wonderful and magical art of the
novel allows us to take our own sto
ries and present them to humanity
as stories about someone else."
Reflecting on his own experi
ences growing up in Istanbul as an
aspiring painter-turned-writer,
Pamuk discussed reading such
Western literary luminaries as Tol
stoy, Dostoevsky, Melville and
Faulkner, and the effect that each
figure had on him.
"The history of the novel is the
history of human liberation," he
said. "The novel was one of the
greatest achievements to come out
of Europe [and] one of the corner
stones of Western civilization."
Many of Pamuk's novels — in
cluding "The Black Book." "My
Name is Red,""lstanbul - Memories
and the City" and "Snow," his most

popular novel in the U.S. — dissect
Turkey's symbolic role as the tradi
tional bridge between East and
West, between Islam and secular
ism. I"he author spoke briefly about
what he called "the East-West ques
tion" yesterday, and it was clear that
he himself was conflicted about the
issue.
Fundamentally, Pamuk said, the
East-West question is borne out of
the perception that all of Turkey's
weaknesses are a result of its old
problems, like religion and culture,
but that once Turks can rationalize
the irresistible allure of the West
with their moral need to comply
with Turkey's rich traditions, the
conflict will disappear.
"I'm inclined to think that often
it's better not to speak about the
East-West question at all," he said.
"Of course, on the other hand, there
is an East-West question; it's about
wealth and poverty, about peace
and representation.The conflict be
tween tradition and modernity is
the essence of the East-West ques-

tion."
Pamuk also offered a bit of polit
ical commentary during the ques
tion-and-answer session that fol
lowed his talk.
When asked if Turkey was a part
of Europe, the author's response
was brief.
"Geographically," he dead
panned.
"We hope that Turkey will one
day be a part of the European
Union." he added after a moment's
pause. "I hope Turkey will be a part
of the European Union."
Ultimately, though. Pamuk's talk
was more an ardent defense of the
novel as an art form than it was a po
litical message.
"Modern societies, people and
nations do their deepest thinking
when they read novels," he said.
"For centuries, humanity has found
its truest impression in novels. So
let's continue to read novels."
