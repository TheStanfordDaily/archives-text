# CARD BACK ON TOP
## Nguyen automatically qualifies for Nationals 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Riding on the shoulders of junior Jessica
Nguyen, the Stanford women's tennis team
took a big step towards regaining top form at
the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA)
Northwest Regional Championships.
In front of a home crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Center, Nguyen captured the
team's first singles title of the year with a 6-1,
7-5 victory over California's Cristina Visico.

Her win came after a runner-up showing at
last year's Regionals.
"It's a great feeling coming off of last
year," Nguyen said. "I was very happy with
what happened last year, but this year coming
back, I was really hoping to do better. Obvi
ously, it can't get any better than today."
Despite winning in straight sets, Nguyen
almost lost control of the final frame. Down 4-
1, and trailing 30-love, Visico stormed back to
take a 5-4 lead. But Nguyen stepped up and
took the final three games and the champi
onship.
"Of course, Visico was down 4-1 so she
began swinging at the ball more aggressively,"
