## Nguyen automatically qualifies for Nationals 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Riding on the shoulders of junior Jessica
Nguyen, the Stanford women's tennis team
took a big step towards regaining top form at
the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA)
Northwest Regional Championships.
In front of a home crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Center, Nguyen captured the
team's first singles title of the year with a 6-1,
7-5 victory over California's Cristina Visico.

Her win came after a runner-up showing at
last year's Regionals.
"It's a great feeling coming off of last
year," Nguyen said. "I was very happy with
what happened last year, but this year coming
back, I was really hoping to do better. Obvi
ously, it can't get any better than today."
Despite winning in straight sets, Nguyen
almost lost control of the final frame. Down 4-
1, and trailing 30-love, Visico stormed back to
take a 5-4 lead. But Nguyen stepped up and
took the final three games and the champi
onship.
"Of course, Visico was down 4-1 so she
began swinging at the ball more aggressively,"

this weekend. She lost her match to top-seeded Susie Babos of Cal, though it was the Cardinal's Jessica Nguyen who was crowned champion.
Nguyen said. "I was a little hesitant
and backed off, but in the end, 1 had to
close it out. When I got down 5-4, I
had to focus more and stay aggressive,
and it worked."
Nguyen was hampered by a foot
injury for much of last year, but the
lunior says those problems are "no
longer an issue."
"I've played ten matches in the last
four days and 1 haven't felt a thing."
she said. "I've been taking a lot of care
of it and I just hope it stays this way.
It's definitely a step forward for us."
The rest of the Cardinal women
seem to have shrugged off their off
season rust as well.
Of the nine players entered in the
main draw, seven lasted into the
round of 32. including all three fresh
men. Ibough five would make it into
the round of 16, senior Celia Durkin

Carolyn McVeigh, playing in her first
collegiate event. McVeigh had already
posted an impressive run. defeating

two seeded opponents. Nguyen was
tot) much for the freshman to handle
and took the match 6-4,6-2.
The team now looks to be headed
in the right direction after a poor
showing at the ITA All-American
Championships.
"This year has been pretty rough
for our whole team just because we
start school later and everyone else
has been training already for a while,"
Nguyen said. "It's really positive for
our whole team to have as many girls
as we did playing, especially for our
freshmen. It gives us all confidence
going into the season."
Nguyen also flourished in the dou
bles bracket, teaming up with fresh
man Hilary Barte in their run to the
semifinals.
Playing in their first tournament
together, Nguyen and Barte strung to
gether three consecutive match wins
before falling 8-6 to Fresno State's
Renata Kucerkova and Anastasia
Petukhova.
I Respite the loss, their strong play is
encouraging for the upcoming season.
" Ibis was our first time playing to
gether just to see how we would do
and our chemistry on the court."
Nguyen said. "We definitely had
chemistry and did really well for play
ing for the first time together. With

more practice and getting more com
fortable playing together, we can do a
lot better in the future."
Burdette and Durkin also showed
on-court chemistry with their run to
the quarterfinals, where they lost a
close 9-8 (5) decision to California's
Marina Cossou and Claire Ilcinkas.
Fresno State's Melanie Gloria and
Tinesta Rowe defeated teammates
Kucerkova and Petukhova 8-6 to
bring home the school's second title in
the last three years at the event.
Up next on Stanford's schedule
are the ITA National Intercollegiate
Indoor Championships and the Ari
zona State Invitational, the last tour
naments of the fall season. With her
singles title, Nguyen is guaranteed an
automatic berth in the Indoor Cham
pionships in Columbus. Ohio.
But until then, the Cardinal will
continue to play catch-up with the rest
of the nation.
"We only have four official days of
practice, so everyone's going to go out
and work on the things that they saw
during the tournament." Nguyen said.
"We have to work off of the tourna
ment and improve on our weaknesses
in this short amount of time."

tot) much for the freshman to handle
and took the match 6-4,6-2.
The team now looks to be headed
in the right direction after a poor
showing at the ITA All-American
Championships.
"This year has been pretty rough
for our whole team just because we
start school later and everyone else
has been training already for a while,"
Nguyen said. "It's really positive for
our whole team to have as many girls
as we did playing, especially for our
freshmen. It gives us all confidence
going into the season."

bles bracket, teaming up with fresh
man Hilary Barte in their run to the
semifinals.
Playing in their first tournament
together, Nguyen and Barte strung to
gether three consecutive match wins
before falling 8-6 to Fresno State's
Renata Kucerkova and Anastasia
Petukhova.

encouraging for the upcoming season.

gether just to see how we would do
and our chemistry on the court."
Nguyen said. "We definitely had
chemistry and did really well for play
ing for the first time together. With

more practice and getting more com
fortable playing together, we can do a
lot better in the future."

on-court chemistry with their run to
the quarterfinals, where they lost a
close 9-8 (5) decision to California's
Marina Cossou and Claire Ilcinkas.

automatic berth in the Indoor Cham
pionships in Columbus. Ohio.
But until then, the Cardinal will
continue to play catch-up with the rest
of the nation.
"We only have four official days of
practice, so everyone's going to go out
and work on the things that they saw
during the tournament." Nguyen said.
"We have to work off of the tourna
ment and improve on our weaknesses
in this short amount of time."
