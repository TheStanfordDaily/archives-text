### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
The party is over. At least that's the general sentiment of San Francisco city officials and
residents of the Castro District, home of the city's annual 1 ialloween Party that tradition
ally draws crowds exceeding 100,000 people.This year. 1 ialloween revelers in San Francis
co will have to party elsewhere.
The decision by the city to cancel the Halloween celebration has met with both ap
proval and scorn by community members and former attendees.
In years past, the party was a common Halloween destination for Stanford students. In
2003, the Toyon Eating Clubs, senior and junior classes and several Greek organizations

was in my freshman year at Stanford," said
Aditya Singh '07. "From a tradition stand-

playing — it truly was a
highlight of my freshman
year." r

www.homeforhalloween.com —to inform people about alternative Halloween events in
the Bay Area.
Some students think crowds may not be deterred.
"I really agree with the premise of the campaign — it 's a good idea," said Haley Berka

Francisco event, and it is hard to change a tradition."
The I lalloween Party started in the lP5()s as a costume party for children, and steadily
grew from a party for the city's gay community and their families into an attraction for peo
