## SF Halloween party off, options limited 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
The party is over. At least that's the general sentiment of San Francisco city officials and
residents of the Castro District, home of the city's annual 1 ialloween Party that tradition
ally draws crowds exceeding 100,000 people.This year. 1 ialloween revelers in San Francis
co will have to party elsewhere.
The decision by the city to cancel the Halloween celebration has met with both ap
proval and scorn by community members and former attendees.
In years past, the party was a common Halloween destination for Stanford students. In
2003, the Toyon Eating Clubs, senior and junior classes and several Greek organizations
chartered buses to the Castro for the event. Several hundred students made treks on their
own as well.

Students who have attended the party in
the past bemoaned the decision to cancel
the event.
"The first time I went to the Castro party
was in my freshman year at Stanford," said
Aditya Singh '07. "From a tradition stand-

point, the experience was
amazing. It was wonderful
to see all the different cos
tumes and people enjoying
themselves. There were sev
eral concerts and bands
playing — it truly was a
highlight of my freshman
year." r

City leaders original
ly hoped to offer an alter

native event to the Castro cele-

bration. hut plans to hold another event
on the Waterfront or in AT&T Park's

parking lot fell through. City officials are now encouraging people to
stay home for Halloween, saying that there is "no reason to come."
David Perry, a San Francisco public relations consultant overseeing

the campaign for the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau, is running a $40.(KK) city-fund
ed public relations campaign to tell people that this year,"the Castro is not where it's hap
pening." The "Home for Halloween" campaign has also launched a Web site —
www.homeforhalloween.com —to inform people about alternative Halloween events in
the Bay Area.
Some students think crowds may not be deterred.
"I really agree with the premise of the campaign — it 's a good idea," said Haley Berka
10. "But honestly, I think people will continue to go to the Castro. It is a very culturally San
Francisco event, and it is hard to change a tradition."
The I lalloween Party started in the lP5()s as a costume party for children, and steadily
grew from a party for the city's gay community and their families into an attraction for peo
ple from all over the Bay Area. Over the years, moving the famed Castro party has been

subject to annual discussion as vio
lence has increasingly defined the
event. Drawing large and wild, ine
briated crowds, the party has been
marred by violence and hate-speech
against the gay community, culminat
ing in the stabbing of four revelers in
2(X)2. The last straw came last year
when a gunman opened fire and shot
nine people, including innocent by
standers.
"A lot of people say to me this
sounds like a tough-love message."
Perry said. "1 have no problem with
that. If there's something I can do to
keep my community safe. Ill do it .'
Perry has been a Castro resident for
the iast 20 years. He attended the
Castro Halloween party regularly

until seven years ago when he
stopped going.
"1 love the Castro," he said. "But
the tipping point was reached for me
and others in the community with
the shootings last year. It is no longer
safe. All I can say is that without ex
ception. 1 don't know of any resident
who wants the party to continue."
To aid in the effort to keep the
Castro safe, 17 businesses, restau
rants. bars and clubs in the Castro
agreed to close for Halloween night.
Jerry Cooper, manager of the
winebar Swirl on Castro, said he
agrees with the mission and objec
tives of the "Home on Halloween"
campaign and his doors will be
closed on Oct. 31.
"Since I've been here for the past
two years, we have not sold alcohol
on Halloween." Cooper said. "The
party has outgrown the Castro. I 'm in
full support of 'Home for Hal
loween."'

There will be an aggressive "no
tolerance" policy in the Castro on
Halloween this year with a signifi
cant increase in police presence. Ad
ditionally, there will be no parking
allowed on Market and Castro
streets and the San Francisco Mu
nicipal Railway, which has tradition
ally brought thousands of revelers
into the Castro, will close the
Church and Castro subway stations
at 8:30 p.m.The California Highway
Patrol will perform alcohol checks
for motorists who drive into the
neighborhood, and the Taxi Com
mission will instruct drivers to en
courage passengers not to go to the
Castro and not to pick people up
there.
While some students were disap
pointed in the party's cancellation,
others supported the "Home for
Halloween" campaign.
"I personally wouldn't go." said
Vern Taylor 07. STEP '08. "Its dan

gerous and I think it is a good deci
sion to cancel the party. Hut at the
same time, it doesn't really solve the
problem."
Singh agreed that the violence was
cause for worry.
" Hie shootings do raise security
concerns, but I hope the party is able
to open up again. It is a very distinc
tive San Francisco event,"he said."lt
is an experience most students
should have before they graduate."
Perry is hopeful, though, that his
efforts will not go to waste.
"Enough is enough. Nine people
were shot in my home," he said. "A
party that was once ours has become
an excuse for violence and bigotry.so
much so that we do not even feel safe
anymore. We are staying home for
Halloween, and we want others to as
well."
