## Day In The Life

October 23,1979
TDS, Inc. then the operator of the
Co Ho, took out the following full-page
advertisement in The Daily explaining a
temporary shutdown:
"Informal probes of the market on
campus, conducted by student members
of the Food Service Advisory Commit
tee, confirmed that there were many po
tential customers who could not find
what they wanted at the Coffee House
(beer and wine, sanitary preparation
and food handling.quick service).
A complete rethinking of the Coffee
I louse's programs was undertaken, which
led to the changes this summer.
The previous Coffee House man
agers resisted the addition of beer and
wine at every juncture, finally having to
be ordered to comply with this intended
beverage expansion.
During the past winter and spring,
the Merchandising Standards Supervi
sor of TDS spent nearly six weeks work
ing in the Coffee House in order to re
instate the minimum standards of serv
ice and sanitation. It was made clear that
children and infants would no longer be
tolerated in the kitchen.
The Coffee I louse managers and
employees refused to use TDS' author
ized suppliers, which tended to worsen
[price inflation].
Abnormal fluctuations of food cost
occurred with a large amount of food
and product unaccounted for.
Because of the numerous operation
problems, it was determined thatr a
complete overhaul of the Coffee I louse
operation was necessary. Accordly ef
fective July 27.1979, the entire staff and
management were terminated and the
operation was temporarily shut down.
During the shutdown the facility was
refurbished and new management and
some new staff were brought in. We
sought and made changes in order to
provide a Coffee House which would
better serve Stanford, a service marked
by cleanliness, efficiency, good service,
friendliness, the lowest possible costs to
customers, and a service that would wel
come all members of the Stanford com
munity.
