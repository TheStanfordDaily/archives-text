SAN DIEGO (AP) — Wildfires
blown by fierce desert winds Mon
day reduced hundreds of Southern
California homes to ashes, forced
hundreds of thousands of people to
flee and laid a hellish, spidery pat
tern of luminous orange over the
drought-stricken region.
Firefighters described desperate
conditions that were sure to get
worse in the days ahead, with hotter
temperatures and high winds fore
cast for Tuesday. At least 16 fire
fighters and 25 others were report
ed injured since the blazes began
Sunday, and one person was killed.
At least 655 homes burned —
about 130 in one mountain area
alone — and 168 businesses and
other structures were destroyed.
Thousands of other buildings were
threatened by more than a dozen
blazes covering ;it least 240,000
acres, the equivalent of 374 square
miles.
"The sky was just red. Every
where I looked was red. glowing.
Law enforcement came barreling in
with police cars with loudspeakers
telling everyone to get out now."
said Ronnie Leigh, 55, who fled her
mobile home in northern Los An
geles County as smoke darkened
the sky over the nearby ridge line.
Soon after nightfall, fire officials
announced that 500 homes and 100
commercial properties had been
destroyed by a lire in northern San
Diego County that exploded to
145.000 acres, said Roxanne
Provaznik, a spokeswoman for the
California Department of Forestry.
The fire injured seven firefighters
and one civilian, and was spreading
unchecked.
A pair of wildfires consumed
133 homes in the Lake Arrowhead
mountain resort area in the San
Bernardino National Forest east of
Los Angeles, authorities said. Hun
dreds of homes were lost in the
same community fours years ago.

Firefighters — who lost valu
able time trying to persuade stub
born homeowners to leave — had
their work cut out for them as
winds gusting to 70 mph scattered

embers onto dry brush, spawning
spot fires. California officials
pleaded for help from fire depart
ments in other states.
"A lot of people are going to

lose their homes today," San Diego
Fire Capt. Lisa Blake predicted
earlier.
Parts of seven California coun
ties were ablaze.
