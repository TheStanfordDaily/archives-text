# Not enough for 'baller'
## Proposed Kimball theme change stirs tempers 
### KAMIL DADA 
Each year, before residents arrive, staff from
each dorm meet together and decide on the
dorm's theme. Residents are usually happy or at
least neutral towards the decision.
But controversy flared recently in Kimball
when resident Justin Hirsch '08, rubbed the
wrong way by the "KimbaLand Before Time"
theme, started an online vote to change it. causing
some residents to respond angrily.
"When students enter their dorm, they assume
that the theme is set in stone." Hirsch said. "The
idea of changing the theme was more of a ques
tion of whether it could be changed and to see if
it could be done."
Hirsch had an alternative theme: "Kim-
Baller." Hirsch claims that his attempt to a live
vote during the dorm meeting was stopped by
dorm government, though dorm co-president
Navin Kadaba "08 says they let him express him
self as he wanted.
But after the meeting. Hirsch set up a poll on
Surveymonkey.com asking residents whether
they would like to stick with the current theme, or
change it to his proposed one.
Survey results were favorable to Hirsch —
59 votes in favor of his theme, versus 30 for the
current theme and 11 for another theme, "Kim
ballin'." But some dorm residents questioned the
veracity of the survey and whether it was needed.
"It's pointless and frivolous," said Lucas
Moller '10. "By trying to make a statement, he's
annoying people."
"The theme of the dorm doesn't really matter
at the end of the day," said Dan Ha '10. "Because
the RAs came up with the theme and have al
ready decorated the dorm, changing it would not
be respectful to them."
Though Hirsch argues that the survey was
confined to the dorm because he sent it only to
Kimball's mailing list. Moller noted that theoret
ically. anyone could vote in the survey, as long as
each computer used had a different IP address.
Dorm co-president Kadaba expressed disgust
at the proposed theme, and doubt at the number
of online voters.
"Out of a 215 person dorm, the fact that 100
responded to the survey is very impressive," he

"If the immaturity of
dinosaurs impacts on
our subconscious,

'bailer'"

said."I didn't think that that many people cared."
Dorm staff declined to speak individually to
The Daily, instead replying together by e-mail.
"A lot of time, money, and planning goes into
bringing the theme to life," they wrote. "Unless
someone is personally offended by the theme for
legitimate reasons that speak to a cultural, reli
gious, or identity misunderstanding, rather than a
personal preference, the theme will not be
changed."
Were the dorm theme to be changed, as long
as it was not offensive it would not need to be ap
proved by Residential Education, said ResEd
Associate Director Josh Schiller.
"Each house is its own community," Schiller
wrote in an e-mail. "Decisions about minor issues
that have little to no bearing on policy-related
matters are best handled on the dorm level."
Some Kimballites just wondered what all the
fuss was about.
"1 think it's silly that people take this so seri
ously," said resident Connie Yu '09. "But if the im
maturity of dinosaurs impacts on our subcon
scious, then sure, let's be 'bailer'."
