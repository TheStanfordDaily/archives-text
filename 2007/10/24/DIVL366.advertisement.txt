Rob Reich's main interests gravitate toward contemporary liberal theory, and he is working
on two projects, the first on the ideals of equality and adequacy as applied to education policy
and reform, the second about topics in ethics, public policy, and philanthropy. He is the recipient
of several teaching awards, including the Walter J. Gores Award, Stanford University's highest
honor for teaching.
Dr. Reich is the founder and director of the Summer Philosophy Discovery Institute at
Stanford, a three-week residential program in philosophy for high school students. He also co
founded the Hope House Scholars program, an initiative where Stanford faculty offer free
courses in the liberal arts to women at the Hope House facility in Redwood City, a drug
rehabilitation program.
What Matters to Me and Why is a discussion and lecture series that encourages
reflection within the Stanford community on matters of personal values, beliefs, and motivations.
Come discover what inspires and really matters to those who shape the university!
