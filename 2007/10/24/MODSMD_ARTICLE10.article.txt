# You, me and them
## 
### 
Firstly. f*** them. Now on to you
and me. We're probably noth
ing alike. This is unfortunate,
since my assignment is to write on the
general vagaries of graduate student
life, and, unless I can find some com
mon thread between us, this is rather
tricky. Especially unfortunate is my
editor's ban on personal stories, since
I have an awesome one about me, a
homeless Eskimo and a one-legged
hooker.
So, common threads. We're both
graduate students (if you're not,
please see first paragraph ), and we're
both... well, there's the rub. we're a
pretty diverse bunch. Different back
grounds. different goals, different
tastes and so on. In fact — past being
graduate students — I'm not really
sure what unifies us. So I 'm just going
to make it up.
There are two types of graduate
students — the miserable and the
delusional. The delusional are, of
course, delusional simply because
they're not miserable.
One might think our universal
misery would be a bad thing, but I'm
not so sure. Clearly, one miserable
person in an ocean of happiness is
less than ideal, since such an individ
ual puts a damper on things (a bit like
having a single incident of sobriety at
an otherwise decent party). On the
other hand, the opposite is true as
well: a handful of jovial-minded mis
creants makes the rest of us generally
miserable graduate students, well,
more miserable.
What we truly need is a one hun
dred-percent miserable student body.
After all. misery is a perfectly ra
tional response to graduate school.
Objectively, one should be really, real

ly unhappy while slaving over point
less research for years, hoping to be re
warded with only the very small
chance of landing a low-paying job.
Moreover — and this is the real
important part — you should be
grumbling continually Attempts to
put on a brave face and look forward
to a perhaps brighter future are mis
guided. Only by embracing the crap
piness of an extended education can
you be at (a miserable) peace.
All of which is why the delusional
ly happy contingent of the grad pop
ulation is particularly irksome.
They're obviously delusional; no
right-thinking human being could
maintain a genuine smile in this place
(not least because any brief moment
of joy is swiftly punctured by the
presence of lithe undergrads ambling
about all carefree and whatnot). Fur
thermore, other people's happiness
in the face of overwhelming reasons
not to be is really annoying.
No, it's worse than annoying; it's a
betrayal of our identity. Coming full
circle, this is the thing that you and 1
have in common; misery. It unifies
us. It brings us closer together. It
makes us one. Stray from the flock,
embrace the ways of the outside
world — contentment, happiness,
joy, pleasure, etc — and you have let
down your people.
So, I implore those of you that feel
upbeat today to take a long hard look
in the mirror and ask yourself: Is your
life really of any value at all?

Opinions might have replaced me with
another brown guy writing about how
horrific grad student life is, but I'm
