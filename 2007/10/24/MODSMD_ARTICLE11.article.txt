October 24,1960:
Republican spokesman
comes to campus
Two-time Republican presidential
aspirant Thomas E. Dewey will bring
his party's campaign to the Stanford
campus today with a 3:15 p.m. speech
in Memorial Auditorium.
Dewey is the latest in a group of top
ranking political figures from both par
ties to appear here under the sponsor
ship of the student Political Union.
In his Stanford talk, the former
governor of New York is expected to
plug the presidential hopes of Vice
President Richard M. Nixon.
Yesterday, according to United
Press International, Dewey declined
to predict the outcome of the presi

dential -race in his state or any other
state,saying "1 threw away my crystal
ball in 1948."
However, Dewey did say he
thought the race between Nixon and
Sen. John F. Kennedy was extremely
close.
Both during the press conference
and at a luncheon with party leaders,
Dewey lashed out at Kennedy and the
Democratic Party.
"The Democratic foreign policy is
one of appeasement," he said, "and we
can't risk that kind of leadership.
Kennedy believes the United States
should not defend Quemoy and
Matsu and this kind of retreat would
be national suicide."
He added that "America's survival
in the struggle with the Soviet Russia
depends on the election of Vice Presi
dent Nixon."
