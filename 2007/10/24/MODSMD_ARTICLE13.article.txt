## Indian college to be modeled after Stanford 
### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vedanta University, a $3.5 billion college mod
eled after world-class universities like Stanford and
Harvard, aims to provide greater access to higher
education and research in India. However, despite
the hopeful presence of a university committed to
excellence so close to home, Stanford students from
India still prefer life on the Farm over the new op
tion.
"Vedanta University is a very noble initiative to
provide an excellent education for students in

India,"said Priyata Mehra'o9. "However, personal
ly, 1 love being a part of the multi-cultural commu
nity here at Stanford and meeting so many people
from across the globe that I would not trade it for a
similar but less diverse education in India."
Riah Forbes TO agreed.
"Even though I would love to study in India be
cause I know that I will want to eventually end up
back there," she said," 1 would still come to Stanford
because it gives me global exposure that Vedanta
University would not be able to provide at this
point in time."
The university system in India is currently under

financial strain, and is only able to serve about
seven percent of college-age students in the coun
try. Vedanta University, scheduled to begin accept
ing students in 2008. intends to educate the almost
123,000 Indian students who study abroad at elite
universities each year.
Business tycoon and philanthropist Anil Agarw
al made a $1 billion contribution to the school, the
largest donation ever granted to a single education
al institution. His goal is to create an "economic
hub" in the Indian state of Orissa resembling Sili-
con Valley around Stanford, accord
ing to a release issued by the Anil
Agarwal Foundation.
"The need for first class educa
tional and research institutions in
India is self-evident." according to
Vedanta's Web site. Unlike many In
dian universities, which focus mainly
on technical skills. Vedanta will emu
late comprehensive American uni
versities like Stanford with "pro
grams in liberal arts, science, engi
neering. medicine, law. business and
performing arts."
The campus will span more than
8,000 acres and is aiming to perma
nently house 500.000 people, includ
ing 40,0(X) staff and 100,000 students.

at its completion in 2023. Out of this
massive number, the university aims
to produce tomorrow's Olympic
champions. Nobel laureates and com
munity leaders.
Revti Gupta '09 was impressed by
Vedanta's high expectations.
"It is high time someone took ac
tion to establish a world class institute
in India that is not just 11T and IIM,"
she said, referring to the top technol
ogy and management schools in the
South Asian country, home to nearly
one-sixth of the world's people.
However, like Mehra and Forbes.
Gupta said she would still prefer to
travel to California to study.
"I would still come to Stanford be
cause it provides a new perspective
and an immersion in a cultural expe
rience for me that I would not have
been exposed to in India."
Despite the lack of enthusiasm
from students, Linda Hess, co-direc

tor of the Center for South Asia at
Stanford,emphasized the positive im
pact of the initiative in the long-run.
"While Indian students who are at
Stanford today may not be tempted
to go to a university that's Mike Stan
ford' in India," she said in an email to
The Daily,"the creation of a place like
Vedanta University is part of a much
bigger picture â€” the picture called
'globalization.'
"The assumptions that used to be
made about the sources of economic
and intellectual power, about who is
'ahead' and who is 'behind,' are being
turned around," Hess added. "If the
vision of its founders is realized,
Vedanta University will attract top
students from across the globe to
India for the same reasons that Stan
ford is able to do that now."
