## Editorial Board Praise for the unsung heroes of the Nobel Peace Prize 
### 
Intense speculation and debate surround
ed the awarding of this year's Nobel
Peace Prize when it was announced on
Oct. 12. Why Al Gore? Has the Nobel Com
mittee stooped to awarding sensationalism?
As was expected, these questions of public
doubt and cynicism were asked worldwide.
That being said, we applaud the Commit
tee on their decision and commend each
Peace Prize winner.
This year's prize was split equally by
Gore and the 2,000-member International
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which
works out of Geneva under the auspices of
the United Nations. The winners were
awarded "for their efforts to build up and
disseminate greater knowledge about man
made climate change, and to lay the founda
tions for the measures that are needed to
counteract such change."
Stanford faculty were intimately in
volved in the research that led to the
Nobel Prize. A trio of Stanford professors
— Tom Heller, Terry Root and Stephen
Schneider — were three of the 2,000
IPCC recipients.
All three are senior fellows at the Woods
Institute for the Environment. In addition.
I teller is a Law professor and a senior fellow
at the Freeman Spogli Institute, while
Schneider is an Interdisciplinary Environ
mental Studies professor.
The creator of the prize, Alfred Nobel,
wrote in his will that the award be given "to
the person who shall have done the most or
the best work for fraternity between the na
tions, for the abolition or reduction of stand
ing armies and for the holding and promo
tion of peace congresses."
Though the 2007 recipients may not fit
this model exactly, it is impossible to deny
their impact on the increasingly important

climate change front.
I"he Nobel Committee said in an Oct. 12
statement that "by awarding the Nobel
Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC and A 1
Gore, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is
seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on
the processes and decisions that appear to
be necessary to protect the world's future
climate, and thereby to reduce the threat to
the security of mankind. Action is necessary
now. before climate change moves beyond
man's control." We believe the Committee's
statement addresses the concerns of those
who question the validity of Gore's impact
on world peace.
Hie Committee also noted that during
the past two decades, the IPCC "has created
an ever-broader informed consensus about
the connection between human activities
and global warming."
Iliis "connection" and improving educa
tion about human-caused climate change is
essential to the continued focus on the in
creasingly mainstream subject. The poten
tial devastation that climate change could
bring would throw the world into chaos,
and, as a result, the IPCC has furthered
peace in a tangible and crucial manner
through its efforts to improve awareness
about the subject.
The climate change issue is arguably our
generation's greatest challenge, and we ap
plaud the selection of the Nobel Committee.
Furthermore, we are proud to be associated
with three of the I PCC's most influential sci
entists— Heller. Root and Schneider — as
they continue their admirable work. It is our
hope that as climate change moves increas
ingly into the national and global conscious
ness that others will embrace the work being
done by these scientists as they fight for the
preservation of our planet.
