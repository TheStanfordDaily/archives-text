# The
						Lowly Interns
## The
						ruined generation 
### 
In my time here in Washington, there is
one demographic that I run into all the
time: old white men. While this balding,
pudgy cabal may have a lot of power, it's not
as bad as it seems. The problem with old
white men is that with every passing day,
they understand less and less about 21st
century America.
Take a look at DC itself today. The
deeply kept secret here is that this entire
city is run on free intern labor. It's true! Just
ask anyone on Capitol Hill how many in
terns they have. Not only do they work for
free, but there are ridiculous office politics
and office drama about who can work the
most and the longest, which of course works
out well for the management. It's sick. I tell
you. This summer, I knew people who
would work for twelve hours a day — every
day—just to impress the boss. For free! I
know. It's crazy.
The grumpy old men at the top probably
were like those same ruthless young work
ers hundreds of years ago. And I'll be the
first to give them the respect they deserve
for their role in making this country what
it's become.
But I have one problem with them.
When they reminisce about their youth —
which is inevitable when you talk to old
people — they always compare their gener
ation with ours. And it's equally inevitable
that they condemn us as the uncaring, anti
social ruined generation.
I think that's a load of super-smelly poo.
Yes. we know how to and do often use
the Internet. Yes, we spend a lot of time
communicating with cell phones and online
chatting. Yes, we've grown up in more
unique family environments. Yes. we're less
involved in traditional social organizations
like the Boy Scouts of America or weekly
Sunday School groups.
But I'll be damned if I let anyone try to
convince me that we're not as involved in
society as previous generations.
Take the Internet issue. For all those who
believe that no one picks up a book or
newspaper anymore, you underestimate
just how much reading we do. Sure, there
are the times we just watch stupid, funny
YouTUbe videos, but most of the Internet is
written, and it's our key source of news and
information.

And for those parents who fear that our
only friends are friends made online, that's
just not true. For the vast majority of online
American youth, friends online are people
they already know through school or work
or family. And, while of course not replace
able for a physical human interaction, the
Internet does help you stay in touch more
efficiently with many more people than be
fore.
1 implore skeptical, 40+ Americans to
visit a modern college campus. I'll bet you'll
find that it's very different from when you
were in college, and not all in a bad way.
While perhaps the College Democrats and
College Republicans have lost many mem
bers compared to the 60s and 70s, all those
kids aren't doing nothing.
You'll find those kids working for their
own causes, causes that might be less popu
lar to the traditional party apparatuses.
Look at the number of Stanford students
involved in SAID, the Stanford Association
for International Development.The group,
along with other international awareness
groups like Volunteers in Latin American
and Stanford in Government, has bal
looned in importance over the past few
years among the Stanford student body.
Issue groups like Energy Crossroads or
community service groups like Alternative
Spring Break provide structure for students
who deeply want to contribute to society
and take the first step to becoming global
citizens.
Organizations like FACES, the Forum
for American/Chinese Exchange at Stan
ford, or Dil Se. the Hindi Film Dance team,
did not even exist before the turn of the mil
lennium. and yet now each have a strong
following on campus.
I believe that the Stanford student body
and student bodies all over the country are
