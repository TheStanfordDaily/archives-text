## Why isn't anyone normal running for president? 
### 
As the various presidential candidates
declare their intention to win the
White House, it's interesting to read
between the lines and perform a little super
ficial psychoanalysis — why are they really
running? What drives these men and women
to abandon their legislative duties, their fam
ilies and their sanity in order to spend a year
or more campaigning for an office that they
will only hold for three years, maximum, be
fore they have to do it again?
It seems that all of the presidential con
tenders have personal issues with the presi
dency, which does not bode well for their
conduct during the campaign nor for their
time in office. Each of them, it seems, has this
overbearing desire, this ambition, to be the
President of the United States (POTUS).This
sounds banal. What I mean, however, is the
desire for the presidency seems to be rooted
in personal psychology rather than position
papers. It's all about being the POTUS.
For example, former Republican gover
nor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney. He can't
stop talking about his father, George Rom
ney, a popular governor of Michigan who lost
the I%K Republican nomination to Tricky
Dick himself, Richard Nixon. George Rom
ney was leading in polls until he doomed
himself by visiting Vietnam and returning to
announce that he was opposing the Vietnam
War. Mitt Romney announced his candidacy
in Michigan, despite living in Massachusetts.
Would Romney be running if his father
never made the attempt? It seems very un
likely.
linen there arc the cases of John Edwards
(D-N.C.) and John McCain (R Ariz.), both
of whom were bitten by the presidential bug
in 2004 and 2000, respectively. And they can't
quite seem to let go. Edwards, for his part,
caught the presidential bug after just one
term in the Senate (although that's still more
than Obama).and after finishing a surprising

second and securing the Veep nomination,
has been running for president ever since. He
wants it so badly, in fact, that'he has aban
doned his previous "sunny Southern" cen
trist positions and spiraled to the left, taking
substantive but very liberal positions on
poverty and health care and renouncing his
Iraq vote. To some, including myself, this
smacks of desperation. On the other hand,
McCain ran as a maverick in 2(KK). and now
wants the nomination so badly that he's will
ing to run as the party "insider" (read: hack)
and support an incredibly unpopular presi
dent on the war and immigration.
As for Miliary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.),
well, there are a lot of allegations that she
and Hill made a deal to share the White
House, much like that mystical deal between
Blair and Hrown. A lot has been said; not
much more needs to. As early as Hillary's
first Senate run in 2(HM), Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.). the Senator she suc
ceeded. predicted she would run for Presi
dent. She's been positioned to run ever since.
Obama (D-lll.) and Giuliani (R-N.Y.)
seem to be the ones least burdened by per
sonal psychologies. Giuliani has always been
unsure of himself politically; he considered
facing Hillary for the New York Senate seat
in 2(MX), but declined. He didn't enter the pri
maries until after Romney and McCain had
hired most of the top staffers (and McCain
ended up firing most of them). 1 lowever. it's
hard to see Giuliani, the Mayor of 9/11 ,as not
being politically opportunistic.

Lastly, Obama. It's his first campaign,
and he seems to believe in his own political
rhetoric. Everyone around him has made
him believe that he can run for and win the
presidency. What if he doesn't win this time
around? He will almost certainly run
again.
'ITie recent political landscape is littered
with people who can't let go of a run for the
presidency, and our political system is worse
off for it. Former Vice President Al Gore, for
example, was brought up by his father,a pow
erful Senator, with the expectation that he
would be president. He still can't compre
hensively rule out running again. Ronald
Reagan lost the GOP nomination by a
whisker in 1976 and ran again. There's talk
that Bill Frist will run for Governor of Ten
nessee to position himself for another run for
the presidency later. John Kerry desperately
wanted another shot but realized that it was
politically unfeasible. The Kennedys, of
course, had a father who built a political ma
chine (and presidential expectations) for his
children. JFK. RFK and Teddy Kennedy all
ran for president at some point.
This presidential pathology raises obvi
ous questions about the political stability and
virtue of our electoral system. No one is in it
just to "serve" the country. Everyone has
their own personal ambition, usually rooted
in their family history.This is partially due to
the weak party system in the US; presidential
candidates have to build their own political
machines within their party, taking years of
planning beforehand. It's addictive, too.
Presidential candidates can't just have one
election — they have to have several.
