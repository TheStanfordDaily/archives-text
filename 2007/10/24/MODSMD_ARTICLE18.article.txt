## Alex Clayton Tennis Freshman phenomenon 
### BY DANNY BELCH 
Bf there's one thing to know about Alex Clayton, it's that
he's no amateur. Clayton, a freshman on the Stanford
men's tennis team, is one of the most highly-touted Car
dinal recruits in some time and is already showing that he
can live up to the hype.
A native of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Clayton began playing ten
nis with his dad and brother at the age of five, but did not seri
ously focus on the sport until he was 12. From there, it was off
and running for him. as he began to practice and train at the
United States Tennis Association (USTA) center in Key Bis
cayne. Fla. — one of the biggest and most prestigious tennis
centers in the country
"My life in Florida was great," Clayton said. "Key Biscayne
is 30 minutes away from my home, so it was really convenient."
Clayton competed nationally and internationally with the
USTA, traveling to tournaments in Europe, South America,
and Australia. Of the many highlights of his young career be
fore Stanford, none seems bigger than his doubles victory in the
Junior Boys Division at the 2005 U.S. Open. Playing on one of
the biggest tennis stages in the world, Clayton teamed with
Donald Young (now a professional) to claim the title.
Clayton also won the Boys 18 year-old division USTA na
tional Claycourt Championship in 2005 and has had a semifinal
appearance in another grand slam — the Australian Open.
The standout freshman is ranked in the top 50 internation
ally for his age-group and top-20 in the United States. He was
even chosen by Stanford alum and tennis legend Patrick
McEnroe to be a hitting partner with the U.S. Davis Cup team.
"That was a great experience," Clayton said. "1 got to hang
out with the Bryan brothers [Bob and Mike Bryan.both former
Cardinal players], [James] Blake, and [Andy] Roddick. It was
great.
"Winning the [Claycourt championship], the US Open dou
bles and being a Davis C'up hitting partner are my biggest thrills
so far."
But the past is behind Clayton, who begins a new chapter at
Stanford as the subject of quite a bit of publicity.
"I do like the attention of being hyped a little," he said. "It

It takes no sweat for Alex Clayton to
live up to all the hype in his first
season of college tennis

gives me extra incentive to work harder."
Usually the new freshmen need to get accustomed to play
ing at the collegiate level and adjust to the bigger and stronger
players, but Clayton is not worried.
"1 have been playing pro events so now 1 am playing a lot of
guys that I played with in the juniors," he said.
Clayton certainly seems to be comfortable on the NCAA
scene so far. In his first collegiate tournament at the ITA Ail-
American Championships, he made a run to the quarterfinals,
taking down some of the top players in the country.
The freshman has been welcomed onto the Stanford team as
a positive contribution to both practice and match play.
"Alex is a good guy and a great guy to have on the team,"
said teammate junior Jeff Zeller. Zeller has been on the team
long enough to witness some talented players come through
Stanford and puts Clayton right up there with them.
In two weeks at the National Indoor Championships, Clay
ton will once again face some of the toughest players in the na
tion. But Clayton is no stranger to competitive environments
and high-level tennis. He welcomes the challenge and is look
ing forward to playing with his teammates who have also qual
ified.
"[Clayton] loves to hangout with the guys and have fun. but
when it comes down to competition, he's ready to play and puts
forth his best effort." Zeller said. "If he keeps his play up that
he showed at [the ITA Ail-Americans] he won't lose many
matches this year."
Maybe that time should be extended to four years. After all. the
guy is just a freshman.
