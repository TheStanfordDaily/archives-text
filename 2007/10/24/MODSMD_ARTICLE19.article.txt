# Red Sox: the postcurse era
## 
### 
What ever happened to the
Boston Red Sox? You know,
that "curse-plagued" fran
chise that everyone used to love to
cheer for once their own teams went
down in the championship hunt.
Oh, I'm certainly well aware that
there's a team from Boston that will
he wearing Red Sox unis and taking
the field in the upcoming World Series
against the Colorado Rockies. But
those aren't the Red Sox I remember.
If Curt Schilling were to pitch with
blood seeping from his surgically re
paired ankle in a must-win game
against the Rockies in this series, it
would be a moment of uncommon
sports heroism.
But it wouldn't be an all-time epic
moment the way it was before. It
wouldn't be th_' perfect ending to the
tragically compelling story of an entire
franchise and its fans.
No. that story is over, and it's prob
ably kind of silly to mourn it. It really
did end as poetically and dramatically
as it possibly could have. But like an
unrepentant "Sopranos" junkie, I'm
still kind of sad that the music stopped
and the screen went black.
I wish that every Sox at bat still had
that remarkable drama attached to it,
that every time they took the field the
next Bill Buckner moment could be
just around the corner. Now. only the
most heartless Yankees fan would
hope that the Bostonians would actu
ally lose in such a disheartening fash
ion. but no one can argue that the dark
specter of the "curse" hanging over
Fenway sure did make things more in
teresting.
In 2007. the Red Sox are no longer
the franchise that the baseball gods
forgot, with their 86-year champi
onship drought erased. Nor arc they
the lovable, self-described "bunch of
idiots" who overcame the pressures of
playoff baseball in Boston by simply
forgetting all about them.
No. the 2007 Red Sox, in the eyes of
the nation, have become the Yankees-
Lite. Shelling out over $170 million
dollars for just two players (J.D. Drew
and Daisuke Matsuzaka) in the off

season will do that to you, especially
when those two players are basically
complementary guys on an already
star-studded team.
Consider that just three years ago,
an ALCS between the Cleveland In
dians and Boston would have seen
the Sox as the clear sentimental fa
vorites — can't you just see the " Re
verse the Curse" t-shirts in Cleveland
amidst crowds of Chief Wahoo sup
porters?
But this year.it was the Indians,de
spite their racially insensitive mascot,
that drew the most sympathy. I mean,
if you're a Cleveland sports fan. at this
point you deserve all the support the
nation can offer. Don't believe me?
Then check out the star-crossed histo
ry of the Cavaliers, Browns and, yes,
even the Indians.
But in the end. Cleveland was
steamrolled by the Red Sox. Yes, it
took them seven games to do it, but
once the Indians needed just one
more game to clinch the series, they
lost their edge. There was no way the
Sox were losing the ALCS from the
moment the Indians first buckled
under pressure.
There was a time when that would

have surprised us/ITie Sox,more men
tally together in a must-win game
than somebody, anybody else. Now,
though, it is the expected outcome.
Somehow you just knew Josh Beck
ett. Manny Ramirez and Co. would
come through. And that certainty,
more than anything else, proves just
how far this franchise has come in
terms of its public perception.
So, Colorado Rockies vs. Boston in
the biggest seven games of the year? I
think you know who I'm picking
there.
No disrespect to the Rockies, their
fabulous young lineup, the classy vet
eran leadership ofTodd I lelton.or the
pitchers who have had more success
at Coors Field than any other group 1
can remember in the purple-clad fran
chise's 15-odd years, but 1 don't see
their magical October run continuing
any further. The talented, confident
and poised Sox have the homefield
advantage for the series, the staff ace
who's been there before, and the vet
eran lineup to win their second cham
pionship in four years.
That is, unless the Rockies have a
little bit of "idiot" in them, too.

Denis Griffin is a senior who is still too
embarrassed by his prediction of a pin
striped championship parade in the
Bronx to officially make a pick for the
World Series. Call him out on his cow
