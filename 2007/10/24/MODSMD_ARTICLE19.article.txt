# Red Sox: the postcurse era
## 
### 
What ever happened to the
Boston Red Sox? You know,
that "curse-plagued" fran
chise that everyone used to love to
cheer for once their own teams went
down in the championship hunt.
Oh, I'm certainly well aware that
there's a team from Boston that will
he wearing Red Sox unis and taking
the field in the upcoming World Series
against the Colorado Rockies. But
those aren't the Red Sox I remember.
If Curt Schilling were to pitch with
blood seeping from his surgically re
paired ankle in a must-win game
against the Rockies in this series, it
would be a moment of uncommon
sports heroism.
But it wouldn't be an all-time epic
moment the way it was before. It
wouldn't be th_' perfect ending to the
tragically compelling story of an entire
franchise and its fans.
No. that story is over, and it's prob
ably kind of silly to mourn it. It really
did end as poetically and dramatically
as it possibly could have. But like an
unrepentant "Sopranos" junkie, I'm
still kind of sad that the music stopped
and the screen went black.
I wish that every Sox at bat still had
that remarkable drama attached to it,
that every time they took the field the
next Bill Buckner moment could be
just around the corner. Now. only the
most heartless Yankees fan would
hope that the Bostonians would actu
ally lose in such a disheartening fash
ion. but no one can argue that the dark
specter of the "curse" hanging over
Fenway sure did make things more in
teresting.
In 2007. the Red Sox are no longer
the franchise that the baseball gods
forgot, with their 86-year champi
onship drought erased. Nor arc they
the lovable, self-described "bunch of
idiots" who overcame the pressures of
playoff baseball in Boston by simply
forgetting all about them.
No. the 2007 Red Sox, in the eyes of
the nation, have become the Yankees-
Lite. Shelling out over $170 million
dollars for just two players (J.D. Drew
and Daisuke Matsuzaka) in the off
