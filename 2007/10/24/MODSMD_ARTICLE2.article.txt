## Popularity of PWR service project slows Administrators try to revive Community Writing Project 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Community Writing Project (CWP)
in the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) Department, which integrates serv
ice learning programs into writing courses, is
one of the oldest programs of its kind na
tionwide, according to PWR Director An
drea Lunsford. I lowever, the classes are not
nearly as popular today as they have been in
the past, a phenomenon that PWR is taking
steps to address.
The levels of participation and populari
ty for the CWP courses vary from year to
year, Lunsford said, but this year the classes
are uncharacteristically unpopular. While
the PWR department typically offers six to
eight CWP courses per term, there are only
two such classes in progress this quarter —
two sections of the same course that are both
full or almost full — and three classes will he
offered in the winter.
" Ihere has been an increasing lack of in
terest among the students," Assistant Direc
tor of PWR Nancy Buffington said of the
CWP program. "Sometimes there are con
cerns about workload, other times students
are concerned about transportation."
CWP administrators are in the process of
examining the workload in a typical PWR
class and comparing it to that of a CWP
PWR class. If it proves to be more work,
Buffington said, the department would con
sider adding another unit to the four-unit
CWP classes.
In addition to a decrease in student de
mand, Buffington told'lbe Daily that it is be
coming increasingly difficult to attract in
structors to teach the classes, because they
require coordination with an outside agency
on a different schedule.
Potential instructors are also worried
that unpopular CWP courses will not fill to
capacity, which could affect student evalua
tions of teaching performance, Buffington
said. She added that end-of-quarter evalua
tions are always reviewed closely in order to
improve the courses.
"We're thinking about what's working,"
Buffington explained. "How have students'
needs and interests shifted, and do we need
to shift the program to match those needs
and interests?
"We don't want to mess with anything
that's healthy," she added. "So before we
take any big steps, we want to carefully
weigh all the different options."
CWP classes take intellectually stimulat
ing ideas outside of the classroom and apply
them beyond an academic setting. In an in
terview with The Daily, Lunsford and PWR
Associate Director Marvin Diogenes ex
plained that the CWP program aims to es-
tablish contact between research
and writing, and the real world. With
speaking and research components,
CWP courses are especially con
ducive to the goals and structure of
PWR 11.
In the past, CWP courses have
worked with government and non
profit organizations on a variety of
projects.
"Service learning is distinguished
from volunteer work in that it is a
continuation of an academic and in
tellectual pursuit," Lunsford said. "It
is intended to be attached to what

you're learning."
One of the options under consid
eration to improve the program's
popularity is the addition of for-prof
it organizations to the list of CWP of
ferings.
"There are a lot of for-profit
agencies who would love to have
Stanford students working with
them," Lunsford said. "The question
we might take up again as we go for
ward is whether we would ever en
tertain working with for-profit
groups."
Adding for-profit organizations
would complicate the history and
philosophy of the program, which
has dealt with over 270 non-profit
and government agencies in its long
history, Buffington said.
"How do we balance student in

terest versus tradition and history of
the program?" she asked.
There are a number of other
classes around campus that have
service learning components. This
week the Haas Center for Public
Service is holding a luncheon for all
service learning coordinators in an
effort to increase overall outreach.
"We don't even know each other,
at this point," Buffington said.
"We're going to try to coordinate a
bit more and be aware of what the
other programs are doing."
Despite current discussions of
changes to CWP, Buffington is confi
dent of the program's longevity.
"PWR is here to stav," she said.
