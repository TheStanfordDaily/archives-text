# Card only get one on road
## Field hockey goes 1-2 in non-conference play 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford field hockey emerged from
last weekend's cross-country trip with a
win and two losses in games played against
No. 13 Louisville, Georgetown and Indi
ana The team's record on the season is
now 8-6 overall and 4-1 in the NorPac con
ference.
After traveling all the way to Louisville,
Ky. last Friday, the Cardinal took on No. 13
in a game that wasn't decided
until overtime when the opposing Cardi
nals pulled out a 2-1 victory. A goal by
Louisville's Julie Barton in the fourth
minute of overtime proved to be the decid
ing factor.
"They're definitely a strong team," sen
ior Jess Zutz said. "It's always good to get
ranked opponents on your schedule."
"While this loss was disappointing, I am
proud of the way the team competed
today," head coach Lesley Irvine told

GoStanford.com following Friday's loss.
"Our number one focus was to manage
our own performance and play 70 minutes
with intensity. We did that. It's hard to lose
in overtime hut being there against a team
like Louisville hints at the talent this team
has. We are excited moving forward from
here."
On Saturday the Cardinal took on a
weaker Georgetown team and had little
trouble, cruising past the Hoyas by the
score of 10-2. Stanford was spurred by
freshman Xanthe Travlos, who netted
three girls in the rout.
"That was definitely our easiest game
on the trip, and it showed by the score,"
Zutz said.
On Monday. Stanford traveled to
Bloomington, Ind., to take on the Univer
sity of Indiana. Once again, the game went
into overtime. For the second time on their
three-game road trip, the team fell in the
extra period in a 2-1 loss. The Hoosicrs'
Katie Griswold won the game dramatical
ly with a goal in the last minute of the over
time period.
In explaining both overtime losses.
Zutz said, "They certainly could have gone

either way."
Despite losing two of three games
on the trip, Stanford was very happy
with its performance over the week
end.
"Throughout the entire road trip
we played really well," Zutz said. We
played with a lot of heart — two dif
ferent coaches came up to us and
said that.That's something we're ex
tremely proud of."
The three-game road trip was the
last in a set of road non-conference
games for the Cardinal. Stanford's
conference, the NorPac Conference,
is weaker than most in Division 1.
The Cardinal used its recent non
conference games as a way of testing
itself against tougher competition,
and the team believes that the expe
rience will pay off.
"A lot of the teams we play out of
our conference are generally from
highly ranked conferences," Zutz
said. "That really helps our strength
of schedule and it helps us — we get
to see stronger opponents and
what's really out there as opposed to
seeing the same teams."
ITie Cardinal will face its tough
est non-conference opponent of the
season this Sunday when it matches
up against No. 4 Michigan at home.
Although Stanford recognizes the
daunting challenge that the Wolver
ines present, the team is looking for
ward to Sunday's game.
"Coming into this Michigan
game 1 think we're definitely looking
to move forward and we're certainly
looking to play the full 70 minutes
with a lot of heart," Zutz explained.
After that, a conference match
up with Radford remains; if Stanford
wins that game, they will he co
champions of the NorPac Confer
ence.
As a whole, the Cardinal is excit
ed for the rest of its season, including
the NorPac Conference Tourna
ment, the competition which decides
who will represent the conference in
the NCAA Tournament.
"We're beginning to peak at just
the right time," Zutz said. "We've
definitely had a lot of ups and downs
this season — we're definitely on an
upward trend right now."
