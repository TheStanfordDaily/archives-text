## Cardinal buckle under pressure and unusual course conditions 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's golf team notched its fourth top-ten
finish in four tournaments played this season when it took ninth
in the Isleworth-UCF Invitational yesterday in Windermere,Fla.
The Cardinal posted a three round 15-over-par team score of 879
and were led by freshman Sihwan Kim who was the only Cardi
nal golfer to post a below-par round.
"The week was a pretty good one," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The field was very strong. We struggled on the green most
ly because Florida has a type of grass that we don't normally see
in California. The guys made the adjustment fairly well and we
did some good things throughout the tournament especially con
sidering the high level of difficulty of the course."
No. 5 Georgia won the tournament with a 23-under-par score
of 841.21 strokes ahead of second-place No. 29 Clemson. Round
ing out the top five were No. 7 USC with a one-under score of
863, N0.4 Oklahoma State with a two-over 866 and No. 17 Wake
Forest with a four-over 868.
