# Golf drops to ninth on final day of Isleworth tournament
## Cardinal buckle under pressure and unusual course conditions 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's golf team notched its fourth top-ten
finish in four tournaments played this season when it took ninth
in the Isleworth-UCF Invitational yesterday in Windermere,Fla.
The Cardinal posted a three round 15-over-par team score of 879
and were led by freshman Sihwan Kim who was the only Cardi
nal golfer to post a below-par round.
"The week was a pretty good one," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The field was very strong. We struggled on the green most
ly because Florida has a type of grass that we don't normally see
in California. The guys made the adjustment fairly well and we
did some good things throughout the tournament especially con
sidering the high level of difficulty of the course."
No. 5 Georgia won the tournament with a 23-under-par score
of 841.21 strokes ahead of second-place No. 29 Clemson. Round
ing out the top five were No. 7 USC with a one-under score of
863, N0.4 Oklahoma State with a two-over 866 and No. 17 Wake
Forest with a four-over 868.

Sophomore Jordan Cox finished in 40th with a six-over three round score of 222
at the Isleworth-UCF Collegiate Invitational. Cox was part of a ninth-place effort for
No.B Stanford which was led by freshman Sihwan Kim, who finished tied for 13th.
Kim's third top-25 finish of the
year was driven by his strong per
formances in the first two rounds of
the tournament — he shot scores of
71 both days to record his fourth and
fifth collegiate under-par rounds. He
shot a one-over 73 on the third day of
competition to reach a one-under
three round total of 215 and tie for the
13th spot in the individual competi
tion.
"Kim had a great week," Ray said.
"He made a great showing as a fresh
man, especially with the high level of
competition."
Sophomore Joseph Bramlett fin
ished the tournament in a tie for 33rd
with a five-over-par three round score
of 221. Like Kim, Bramlett was con
sistent over the first two days when he

maintained identical one-over scores
of 73.
Fellow sophomore Jordan Cox
came in only one stroke behind
Bramlett, earning scores of 73,72 and
77 for the tournament. After a tough
third round. Cox fell thirteen places
to a tie for 40th.
Senior Rob Grube concluded the
tournament in a tie for 48th with a
seven-over score of 223. Rounding
out the Cardinal five was junior
Dodge Kemmer, who ended up in a
tie for 71 st with a 13-over score of 229.
The Cardinal was in a tie for eighth
after the first two days of the tourna
ment after earning a three-over-par
291 for each day; however, the team
fell under the pressure and unusual
course conditions. Stanford conclud
ed the final round with a nine-over
score of 297.
The Isleworth is considered to be
one of the most prestigious collegiate
tournaments and hosts only the top
teams in the country.The field includ-

Ed 16 2007 NCAA participants, 14
teams ranked in the top-50 and six of
the current top-ten teams.
"The conditions were a lot harder
in the third round but 1 think that it af
fected all of the teams because we
didn't fall very far in the standings,"
Ray said. "The guys were disappoint
ed with our finish but it definitely was
not horrible considering the field."
The Cardinal is hoping for a better
finish at its next tournament, the
CordeValle Classic, which will begin
Nov. 5 at the CordeValle Golf Club in
San Martin, Calif.
"When guys who normally do well
have a tough time, it makes for a
tough team score," Ray said. "The
guys are anxious to work on their in
dividual performances when we get
back to Stanford and we are looking
to improve next week at the Corde-
Valle Classic."

The Cardinal was in a tie for eighth
after the first two days of the tourna
ment after earning a three-over-par
291 for each day; however, the team
fell under the pressure and unusual
course conditions. Stanford conclud
ed the final round with a nine-over
score of 297.
The Isleworth is considered to be
one of the most prestigious collegiate
tournaments and hosts only the top
teams in the country.The field includ-

Ed 16 2007 NCAA participants, 14
teams ranked in the top-50 and six of
the current top-ten teams.
"The conditions were a lot harder
in the third round but 1 think that it af
fected all of the teams because we
didn't fall very far in the standings,"
Ray said. "The guys were disappoint
ed with our finish but it definitely was
not horrible considering the field."
The Cardinal is hoping for a better
finish at its next tournament, the
CordeValle Classic, which will begin
Nov. 5 at the CordeValle Golf Club in
San Martin, Calif.
"When guys who normally do well
have a tough time, it makes for a
tough team score," Ray said. "The
guys are anxious to work on their in
dividual performances when we get
back to Stanford and we are looking
to improve next week at the Corde-
Valle Classic."
