## One in five fans superstitious 
### ALAN FRAM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) It didn't take Heather Pate
long to figure out why her beloved Auburn University
football team had begun losing. It was the pink tooth
brush.
Pate, a lifelong fan of the school, has long refused to
own anything with even a hint of red. the color of
archrival Alabama.That puts her among the one in five
sports fans who say they do things in an attempt to
bring good luck to their favorite team or avoid jinxing
them, according to an Assoeiated Press-Ipsos poll re
leased Tuesday.
The survey showed no real difference by gender,
race or education in whether people try finding a way
to help their team win. But those who do tend to be
younger and make more money than those willing to
risk letting the athletes determine a game's outcome.
They also are more likely to be single.
A nurse from Eldridge, Ala., Pate said she refuses to
own a red car or purchase anything crimson. So when
she recently had to spend time in a hospital after the
birth of her twin sons, she was aghast when she noticed
someone had brought her a pink toothbrush. Auburn
promptly dropped two straight games.
It was all because of that "red toothbrush," Pate, 28,
said this week after responding to the AP survey.
There was no significant difference among the fans
of various sports in how superstitious they were, the
poll showed.

Twenty-four percent of college basketball fans ad
mitted to trying something lucky to help their team and
20 percent of professional basketball followers said the
same thing. Fans of professional baseball, and of college
and professional football, fell in between.
Other fans who answered the poll had their own
techniques for influencing the final score.
Lisa Rawlinson. 40, a pharmaceutical sales manager
from Huntington.W.Va., won't watch crucial Cleveland
Indians games on television. She didn't watch Sunday
night but her Indians somehow lost the decisive game
anyway against the Red Sox. allowing Boston to creep
into the World Series, which starts Wednesday.
Todd Williams, 33, of Lexington, Ky., likes to watch
University of Kentucky games clad in Kentucky blue
and-white apparel - and clutching his lucky basketball.
For Yankees fan Paul Hegyi, 31, of Sacramento, Calif.,
it's a lucky bat - which failed him last week when the In
dians bumped New York from the playoffs.
Mario Alvarado, 40. of Houston leaves Houston
Texans' football games if they are trailing. He did so
Sunday and by the time he turned the game on at home,
the Texans had taken a lead - only to lose as the Ten
nessee Titans kicked a game-winning field goal as time
expired.
"If I hadn't turned it on. I probably wouldn't have
jinxed them," he said.
The poll was conducted from Oct. 16-18 and in
volved telephone interviews with 1,013 adults. It has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percent
age points.
