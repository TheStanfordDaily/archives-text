'ITiere were barely enough chairs — or
steaming plates of cornbread and chicken —
for the group of almost 50 students gathered
at last night's Jena Six dinner and discussion
in El C'entro Chicano.
"Modern-Day Lynching: A Look into the
1 lorror," the first NAACP event of the year,
featured a panel including English Prof.
Michele Elam. the new director of African
and African American Studies, History Prof.

Clayborne Carson and Political Science
Prof. Emeritus Lucius Barker, who fielded
questions from eager undergraduates about
the incident.
The term "Jena Six" refers to the six black
teenagers who were charged with attempted
murder for beating a white classmate in
Jena, La. in Dec. 2006. A series of racially
charged incidents preceded the beating, in
cluding the hanging of nooses from ;i tree by
white students who refused to let a black stu
dent sit under the tree, which they said was
for whites only.

One of the arrested students, Mychal
Bell, 17. was tried and convicted as an adult
in June 2007 on charges of aggravated bat

have overturned the ruling, he is still in jail.
Demonstrators are continuing to march in
the town of Jena, which is 85 percent white.

of institutional racism in America.

having a shared cultural vocabulary," Carson
said.

the nooses that provoked the incident were
not illegal, "the white kids knew exactly the
potency of the noose as a symbol ol power
and threat of killing that white men used
against blacks in recent history," Carson
said.
Elam agreed that, "the image gets recy
cled."
After focusing on the significance of the
noose in the South, the conversation moved
