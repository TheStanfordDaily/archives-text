# Students mobilize against racism
## 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
'ITiere were barely enough chairs — or
steaming plates of cornbread and chicken —
for the group of almost 50 students gathered
at last night's Jena Six dinner and discussion
in El C'entro Chicano.
"Modern-Day Lynching: A Look into the
1 lorror," the first NAACP event of the year,
featured a panel including English Prof.
Michele Elam. the new director of African
and African American Studies, History Prof.

Clayborne Carson and Political Science
Prof. Emeritus Lucius Barker, who fielded
questions from eager undergraduates about
the incident.
The term "Jena Six" refers to the six black
teenagers who were charged with attempted
murder for beating a white classmate in
Jena, La. in Dec. 2006. A series of racially
charged incidents preceded the beating, in
cluding the hanging of nooses from ;i tree by
white students who refused to let a black stu
dent sit under the tree, which they said was
for whites only.

One of the arrested students, Mychal
Bell, 17. was tried and convicted as an adult
in June 2007 on charges of aggravated bat
tery and conspiracy. Iliough appeals courts
have overturned the ruling, he is still in jail.
Demonstrators are continuing to march in
the town of Jena, which is 85 percent white.
Last night's discussion used the events as
a springboard to talk about the larger issue
of institutional racism in America.
"This incident indicates the danger of not
having a shared cultural vocabulary," Carson
said.

While authorities in Jena maintained that
the nooses that provoked the incident were
not illegal, "the white kids knew exactly the
potency of the noose as a symbol ol power
and threat of killing that white men used
against blacks in recent history," Carson
said.
Elam agreed that, "the image gets recy
cled."
After focusing on the significance of the
noose in the South, the conversation moved

to the media's role in sensational
cases such as Jena Six.
"Racism is a systemic problem in
our society, but in newspapers, it's a
who-did-what-to-whom-when
story," Barker said. "Six months
from now there will be another Jena
Six. because if it bleeds it leads, but
to study Jena is to study a micro
cosm of a bigger problem."
Carson agreed with his col
league.
"To focus on whether one kid in
Louisiana will go to prison as op
posed to the large number of black
men that are sentenced to life in
prison at age 18 or 19, that's the real
issue," he said. "But probably none
of you have read an article about
that issue.
"We should use this as a moment
to address the larger issue," he
added.
Several students expressed frus
tration, saying that they did not
know how to personally make a dif
ference when incidents like the Jena
Six surfaced. They did recognize,
however, that there is still a need to
combat institutional racism.
"There are a lot of ways to mobi
lize," Elam urged. "Work for social
change wherever you are, whether
that is in the arts or in schools like
Stanford."
