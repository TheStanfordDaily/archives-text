# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Meal plans serve games 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
A rekindled spirit for football is not the
only new attraction at the Stanford Stadium
these days. Instead of fumbling through
pockets for loose change to pay for high
priced concessions, enthusiastic fans can
now purchase food at football games with a
swipe of their II) cards.
ITie new program from Stanford Dining
comes after years of feedback from stu
dents who wanted to apply their meal plans
at the stadium.
"What we offered in the past were sack

lunches or late plates," said Rafi
Taherian, executive director of
Stanford Dining, in an email to
Hie Daily. "However, what stu
dents were asking for was to be

able to have the stadium experienee of con
cession food."
Dining could not accommodate stu
dents' requests in past years because of
what Taherian called "significant opera
tional challenges, technology impediments,
meal plan restrictions and.finally, costs."
But this year Dining finally gave the idea
a chance.
"As a result of New Student Orientation

(NSO) planning and Dean Julie's enthusi
astic idea to create a freshman Stanford
Football experience, we planned one of the
NSO events at the first game," Taherian
said, "and it was a success.
