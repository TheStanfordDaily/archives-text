# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Meal plans serve games 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
A rekindled spirit for football is not the
only new attraction at the Stanford Stadium
these days. Instead of fumbling through
pockets for loose change to pay for high
priced concessions, enthusiastic fans can
now purchase food at football games with a
swipe of their II) cards.
ITie new program from Stanford Dining
comes after years of feedback from stu
dents who wanted to apply their meal plans
at the stadium.
"What we offered in the past were sack

lunches or late plates," said Rafi
Taherian, executive director of
Stanford Dining, in an email to
Hie Daily. "However, what stu
dents were asking for was to be

able to have the stadium experienee of con
cession food."
Dining could not accommodate stu
dents' requests in past years because of
what Taherian called "significant opera
tional challenges, technology impediments,
meal plan restrictions and.finally, costs."
But this year Dining finally gave the idea
a chance.
"As a result of New Student Orientation

(NSO) planning and Dean Julie's enthusi
astic idea to create a freshman Stanford
Football experience, we planned one of the
NSO events at the first game," Taherian
said, "and it was a success.

"The event was heavily partici
pated in by students, and it was the
first time the stadium felt so alive,"
he added. "There was so much ener
gy and excitement that everyone, in
cluding the players, could feel it."
Taherian noted that purchasing
food on meal plans at the first game
was only a trial, but its success called
for an extension of the program.
Despite the enthusiastic re
sponse to the new meal plan option,
the closing of dining halls during the
first game prompted concern from
some students.
"I don't know why they would
close dining halls," said Kesav
Raghavan '11. "Not everyone goes
to the game."
However, Dining representatives
assured students that facilities
would not close for football games
in the future.
"We closed the first day as an in
centive for new students to attend
the game," said Terry Nahavandi,
general manager of Wilbur Dining.
"Also, many upperclassmen were
not on campus yet, so the dining

halls would be fairly empty."
"It is our hope that this program
will contribute to increasing student
attendance at football games,"
Taherian added,"but the concession
meal is only an additional service
that is being provided to students on
the meal plan."
Dining has also taken steps to en
sure that the food offered at the
games is "concession-style," as re
quested by students. Menu options
include hot dogs, burgers, French
fries, pizza, sodas and vegetarian al
ternatives.
"I ordered a veggie burger," said
Raghavan. a vegetarian. "I guess if
there are only a couple of meat op
tions, then two vegetarian options
are fine."
Overall. Dining called the pro
gram a success at the early home
games.
"Ultimately this is a student
driven initiative on which many
people have worked extremely
hard,"Taherian said. "So far we have
had a very positive response, with
students arriving early to games, sit
ting with their friends and having an
overall great Stanford football ex
perience."
