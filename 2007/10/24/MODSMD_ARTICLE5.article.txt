meeting, as senators focused on the impor
tance of representing the opinions of the
undergraduate student body.
ITie senators noted that approximately
.VMM) students on campus have signed the
current petition opposing Rumsfeld's ap
pointment,compared to a mere 4(H) signa
tures on a petition in support of the ap
pointment.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 empha
sized the Senate's duty to focus on under
graduate opinions.
"Please do not take into account your
own feelings regarding the issue," ( ordova
told the other senators.
The Senate discussed its role in the de
bate surrounding Rumsfeld's appointment
and agreed to advocate the opinion ol the
majority of the undergraduate student
body.
"It is important that we be very
clear of the role of the Undergradu
ate Senate in this issue and we avoid
being too [much] or too little in
volved in matters such as these," said
Senator Luukas lives'o9.
However, Senator and Campus
Advocacy Chair Sarah Golabek-
Goldman '10 said that the Senate
should divert its attention to more
concrete issues.
"I have strong political views on
the issue but I think the University
will make the decision to hire Rums
feld regardless of whether the ASSU

passes a resolution or not," Go
labek-Goldman said. "To be honest,
I think that the ASSU should focus
on tangible issues for the student
body that we can really have an im
pact on."
The Senate plans to discuss the
issue further in upcoming meetings
and pass a resolution in accordance
with the voice of the majority of the
undergraduate population.
In addition the Rumsfeld issue,
the Senate also discussed and passed
two Joint Association Bills — one to
endorse the development of a com
merce platform and the second to fill
the vacancies on the Constitutional
Council.
