## Far from puzzled Grad student wins national Sudoku competition 
### MIKE DING 
For most Stanford students,Sudoku puz
zles are a hobby to be enjoyed during the
slower hours of IHUM lecture. For
Thomas Snyder, they are a lifestyle.
Just last week, Snyder — who holds a B.S.
from Caltech, a Ph.D. from Harvard, and a post
doctoral position at Stanford — won the first
ever national Sudoku championship. The compe
tition, which

took place in Philadelphia, drew over 9(K) experi
enced competitors from all over the country.
Snyder is no novice at Sudoku. the catchy
Japanese puzzle that has caught the nation by
storm.
"I've probably been solving puzzles since I
was a kid." said Snyder. "As early as four or five
years old. I liked mathematical puzzle problems."

Snyder has been
competing in both the US and World

Puzzle Champi
onships for several
years now. It all
began when his
puzzle team cap
tain noticed his un
canny aptitude for
Sudoku.and he en
couraged Svnder to
enter the World Su
doku Competition.
"He told me that
my Sudoku scores
and times ranked
among the most
competitive in the
world," said Sny
der.
In March of
2006, Snyder trav
eled to Luca, Italy
to compete in the
Sudoku World
Championship. In
his first competi
tion, Snyder took
second place.
"I choked on the
last problem," he
said. "But I also got
the sense that I was

really good at this stuff, and 1 could
compete at the highest level"
With newfound confidence,

Snyder returned the next
year, earning first place at
the world competition.

this time in Prague, Czech
Republic.

The national
competition con
sisted of three
qualifying rounds,
as well as a final
round in which
contestants
solved a Sudoku
puzzle on a 4 foot
square whiteboard.

"In the qualifying
rounds, they give you
three puzzles," he said.
"The first one is easy,
the second one medi
um. and the third one
can range anywhere
from hard to extreme
ly hard."
Unfortunately for
Snyder, in his first
qualifying round, the
third question fell into
this latter category —
yet Snyder remained
undeterred.
"1 just stopped and
looked at it,"he said.
"And all of a sudden 1
just saw how the puz
zle should be solved. 1
wrote the numbers
down and raised my
hand. The proctor
came over, looked at

Snyder's
personal record
for an "easy"
puzzle is 52
seconds.

my score, and raised one finger, indicating that I'd
finished first in my qualifying rounds."
Hie second competitor to finish did not raise
his hand until eight minutes after Snyder. Indeed,
for the rest of the competition — even in the final
round — his margin of victory was always seven
minutes or above.
What is the secret to Snyder's success? It all
comes down to time management, he insists.
"When practicing Sudoko, the more notes
you write, the more time you waste writing
those notes," he explained. "You have to just
look at the puzzle and decide in your head how
you'll go about it. I'm at a point now where I
can solve an easy or medium puzzle in less then
2 minutes."
His personal record for an 'easy' puzzle is 52
seconds.
Ultimately, though, Snyder hopes his future
lies beyond the world of competitive Sudoku.
"Both of my parents are educators," he said.
"And I want to be a professor too. so I can extend
my knowledge to others and train the next gener
ation of scientists and thinkers."
But for now, there are still smaller things Sny
der would like to accomplish.
"I'm starting to write puzzles myself," he said.
"My first book will be called Battleship Sudoku
in which I combine the classic battleship game
with the puzzles. I will also represent the US in
the next World Sudoku Championships in Goa,
India."
