## Immigrant janitor juggles job, family 
### RYANN BLACKSHERE 
The Cantor Arts Center is a 120,(XX) square
foot building, large enough to hold a diverse
collection of exhibits, ranging from Renais
sance paintings to African masks, in its 24 gal
leries. A bookshop and cafe are inside: the
grounds house a beautiful Rodin sculpture garden. De
spite Cantor's size, however, just two janitors maintain
the complex.
One of them is 42-year-old Doroteo Garcia. Respon
sible for cleaning the public restrooms, staff restrooms
and offices. Doroteo stands only five-foot five-inches
but has a boundless energy. He greets with a handshake,
huge hug and a kiss on the cheek.
"Let's sit in the sun," he said."lt is a beautiful day!"
Doroteo grew up in Oaxaca, Mexico, with five broth
ers and a sister. About 10 years ago, struggling to support
his wife and two sons on a salary of $100 a week, he de
cided to immigrate to America. He now lives with his
sons Ernesto, 21. and Eduardo, 18. in East Palo Alto,
splitting rent with them on his $10-per-hour salary.
In the upper-left corner of Doroteo's gray uniform
shirt is embroidered the emblem of ABM, the janitorial
service that has employed him for five years. Stanford
contracts with ABM for janitorial services; about 150
ABM staff currently work on campus. New employees
start off with an $8-per-hour salary — about 30 percent
below the University's living wage, which only applies to
nonunionized workers. Doroteo is one of the workers
negotiating with ABM for higher wages when a new
contract comes out in June.
"1 work at a place with a living wage," he said. "Why
do I work at a place where people don't get it?"
Doroteo works eight hours a day, five days a week,
year-round. He's allowed two breaks a day; most days,
that's a 15-minute break at 10 a.m.. and a 45-minute
lunch break starting at noon. On Tuesdays and Thurs

days. his lunch is extended to an hour, when he
English tutoring sessions. HABLA. a group of student
volunteers on campus, persuaded employers to allow
workers to attend free English classes during lunch. 1
"Working days is not easy," he said. "But I used ftl
work nights. It is much harder."
When he's off work, Doroteo usually stays home ei -
ther washing clothes or cleaning his apartment — he
doesn't really have the time or money for anything
he says.
"1 remember people telling me about all of the op
portunities in America and all the money compared fo
Mexico." he says. "But no one told me about rent, buy
ing a house, a car and food."
ITiough he is an active member of the East Palo Alto
community, participating in a civic group of local lead
ers and human rights activists. Doroteo would rather
have a better job living in Mexico.
"I am free in Mexico," he said.
Stanford police used to stop Doroteo and his fellow
workers late at night, interrogating them about their
reasons for being on campus. ABM had to create special
IDs to make it easier for staff members to explain their
presence.
Yet. Doroteo still likes the atmosphere of the Farm.
"I like the students, and I like Stanford," he says.
"Students have a great relationship with workers."
Even though life in America has been difficult for
him, Doroteo frequently discusses with Ernesto and Ed
uardo all the opportunities available to them here that
he didn't have in Mexico. When Eduardo came here ear
lier this year. Doroteo hadn't seen him for 10 years.
"He [was] involved in drug and gang life in Mexico,"
Doroteo said. "Boys need their father, and he needs his
brother."
Doroteo is glad they're reunited.
"I missed my family for years." he said.
