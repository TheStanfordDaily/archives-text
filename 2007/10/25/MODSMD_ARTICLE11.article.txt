Red Sox trounce Rockies, 13-1,
in World Series opener
BOSTON (AP) Josh Beckett. Dustin Pe
droia and the Boston Red Sox were revved up
and ready. Not so the Colorado Rockies, who
lurched into Beantown with all the zip of a
creaky old stagecoach.
Back in the World Series with no Bambi
no's curse to worry about, the Red Sox flat
tened the Rockies 13-1 in Wednesday night's
opener.
Beckett got off to the most overpowering
start since Sandy Koufax, Pedroia became
only the second player to lead off the Series
with a home run, and then a relentless offense

led by Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz
racked up hit after hit.
"Not sure what the final score was," Col
orado's Todd 1 lelton said.
Despite the lopsided score there was no
boasting from Boston.
"1 executed just enough pitches today to sur
vive." Beckett said. "That's a good lineup over
there. You can tell how hungry they are."
Boston set a record for runs and victory mar
gin in an opener and finished with 17 hits, be
coming the first club with eight doubles in a
Series game since 1925. After taking a 6-1 lead
against Colorado ace Jeff Francis, the Red Sox
piled on seven runs in the fifth, when Rockies
reliever Ryan Speier walked three straight
batters with the bases loaded - the first time
that ever happened in the Series.

World's largest airplane takes
off from Singapore
ON BOARD FLIGHT SQ3BO (AP) A
Singapore Airlines Airbus A3BO took off on a
historic journey Thursday - the first commer
cial flight by the world's largest jetliner, which
boasts luxurious suites enclosed by sliding
doors, double beds,a bar and the quietest inte
rior of any plane.
With 455 passengers, some of whom paid
tens of thousands of dollars for a seat in avia
tion history, the superjumbo left Singapore for
Sydney at 8:16 a.m. on a 7-hour flight that
launches a new era in air travel. Also on board

flight SQ3BO are a crew of about 30 including
four pilots.
Passengers clapped as the plane left the
gate on schedule and taxied to the runway
that was widened and lengthened to accom
modate the plane.
More cheers broke out 16 minutes later as
the double-decker aircraft, powered by four
Rolls RoyceTrent 900 engines, lifted smooth
ly into the nearly cloudless sky tinged pink by
the light of the early morning sun.
Flight attendants handed out champagne
and certificates to passengers.
One just there for the ride was Swedish
electronics engineer Ralf Danielsson, 58, who
took the first Concorde flight in 1979. "Twen
ty-eight years later, I thought it would be fun
to do something like that again," he said.
