## Editorial Board Rethinking research restrictions 
### 
With this year's unveiling of the Un
dergraduate Academic Life Web
site comes a new push by the Uni
versity to make research accessible to un
dergraduates. Freshmen at New Student
Orientation were bombarded with appeals
to visit http://ual.stanford.edu and discover
all that Stanford has to offer. New dorm
based academic advisors are regularly send
ing emails, reminding students about up
coming deadlines for quarter-long grants,
summer fellowships and the coveted Chap
pell Lougee scholarship for sophomores.
Lost amidst this frenzy to try and include
all undergraduates in the research process is
one uncomfortable fact: thanks to the
Provost's International Travel Policy, Stan
ford cannot fund research trips to countries
where a State Department Travel Warning
has been issued. No exceptions. Granted,
the Haas Center and the office of Under
graduate Research Programs (URP) offer
an array of travel and research options. But
unfortunately, current travel restrictions
still severely limit the possible range of re
search destinations.
To some extent, the University's policy
makes a conservative sort of sense. Obvious
ly. Stanford should not make it a policy to
fund research just any where.Tt\di in-country
research project on Kurdish nationalism in
northern Iraq or a detailed, survey-based
study of the social impact of the Columbian
drug wars will have to wait a little while.
History has shown that these concerns
are not to be taken lightly — Stanford stu
dents have gotten in trouble before. The
tragic 1993 death of Fulbright Scholar and
Stanford alumna Amy Biehl '89 in South
Africa makes this point all too clear. But the
current policy that strictly bars students
from conducting research in nations like Is
rael. Nigeria and Kenya is a needlessly im
precise way to protect Stanford's legal liabil
ity. Furthermore, the policy unnecessarily
restricts the spirit of discovery and inquiry

that the URP Web site claims is at its core.
Part of the problem is the unreliability of
the State Department's warnings.The State
Department is obviously trustworthy, but
some inclusions on the list (and omissions
from it) are suspect. Uganda, despite having
what the CIA World Factbook calls "contin
ued armed fighting" and nearly 300,000
refugees, is not included on the list, but
Kenya and Nigeria, both relatively safe
countries, are.TTie restrictions on those two
nations are especially irksome — and even
offensive — for the Nigerian and Kenyan
nationals who attend Stanford and could
use University grant money effectively in
their home countries. Other travel warnings
mention specific regions of a country that
should be avoided, and as a result the entire
country is deemed a no-go. research loca
tion. Does enforcement of such a policy sig
nificantly reduce academic gains that could
possibly be achieved by studying in one of
the country's safer regions?
Scrutiny of overseas research project
grants, especially those involving human
subjects, is very rigorous. Applicants must
submit detailed expense reports and plans
on how to conduct their study or survey, and
methodology is reviewed extensively. TTiere
is little reason that this review could not be
expanded to a case by case evaluation of
each researcher's attempted destination
and how safe it may be. A waiver could even
be incorporated if the applicant is deter
mined to go abroad and Stanford wants to
abdicate liability.
The Haas Center and URP provide mil
lions of dollars for undergraduate research
each year, and their attempts to reach all
students should be applauded. But a sensi
ble revision of the Provost's International
Travel Policy, one which at least considers
awarding grants to restricted countries,
would open up these opportunities to even
more eager researchers and more meaning
ful academic contributions.
