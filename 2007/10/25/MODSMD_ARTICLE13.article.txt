# Dirty Cal Student
## Houseboy 
### 
I first learned about the mythical House
boy position at a Christmas party during
my freshman year at Cal. Soft lighting,
gentle conversation and good wine set me
up to be completely enchanted by the beau
tiful sorority girl and her story of the House
boy. that one lucky man chosen to live and
work inside the sweet sanctuary of the
sorority house. Could such heavenly treas
ures truly exist? Yet here she was, a recent
graduate of my university, telling me of the
opportunities that were indeed within my
reach, I went to sleep that night dreaming of
pajama-clad women, pillow fights,great ma
jestic houses and me, in the middle of it all.
In my second year of college, I was deter
mined to make those dreams a reality I
wrote up elegant cover letters and reached
out to all of the sorority houses at Cal. Vet
there were simply no Houseboy positions
available. I was beginning to lose hope. My
friend, however, had heard about my search
and informed me that her sorority house
had an opening for a I louseboy. She dutiful
ly recommended me to the 1 louse Mother in
charge, and I was granted an interview.
I wasn't sure what exactly a Houseboy
did. but this was irrelevant. I always envi
sioned myself as a cabana boy, dressed in a
bright pink thong and serving the girls drinks
by the poolside.Trying to keep that particular
vision repressed for my interview. I did my
best to present myself as a proper young lad.
I dressed in crisp business casual and mental
ly rehearsed the personal experiences that I
thought would make me a good Houseboy:
the close and excellent relationship I shared
with my younger sister, my comfort in being
the only guy amidst 40 girls in the dance class
es I had taken. The two main questions the
I louse Mother asked me, though, were "Are
you a student here at UC-Berkeley?" and
"How well do you clean?" My responses
"Yes" and "Amazingly well" seemed to satis
fy her Disappointingly, nothing was asked
about how I looked in a pink thong.
I started the Houseboy position the fol
lowing year, and learned there were several
main tasks involved: washing dishes, serving
dinner and cleaning up afterwards, stocking
breakfast and weekend foods,general house
security and making sure that the girls didn't
ravage the supply of ice cream. In exchange
for my faithful labor. 1 was to receive free
room and board and was given a private
room with a bathroom on the bottom floor
of the house, separate from those of the girls.
My fellow residents were one other House
boy. a House Mom and Dad (married cou
ple.the only way a man was allowed toman

age the sorority) and 57 girls. During my
time there, I always viewed myself as more
of a I louseman than a I louseboy hut 1 stuck
to the name due to the fact that it was fantas
tic and a less threatening title because boys,
unlike men. are technically sexually imma
ture. I was the exception to this rule.
Wanting to be an excellent Houseboy
and learn everyone's name. I immediately
made the rounds to the girls' rooms with my
camera, introducing myself and asking to
take their pictures with a voice memo of
their names so that 1 could more easily
memorize their names. Unfortunately, this
made me come off as weird, and 1 had to cir
cle back a second time, offering chocolate
covered gummy bears as reconciliation. I at
tended drunken sorority soirees and facili
tated the recruiting events, harsh affairs that
rivaled the toughest job interview. After a
while, the whole setup became routine, like
living in a co-ed dormitory. The work could
get draining, and sometimes I thought of the
girls as the enemy, smirking when I over
heard their sorority troubles or leaving their
cereal bins slightly less than full in the hopes
that hunger would strike them down.
Recounting the whole experience, I came
away with the following wisdom: sorority girls
are fickle creatures who can be kind upfront,
heartless behind your back and seriously poi
sonous in large groups.Their appetites are vo
racious and desserts are always the best way
into their (and almost any woman's) heart.
Being a Houseboy can be everything from
mundane to fantastic, and it depends in part
on the attitude you bring in with you.
I was very appreciative of the ability to
save so much on my housing costs while liv
ing in a sometimes-loving community of
women. To the sororities of Stanford. I say
this: open your doors and let a Houseboy
into your house and heart. It's an act of
goodwill and graciousness. good economics
if you have an unused or unwanted room
and an excellent way to have a loving and
adoring pet that cleans up after both itself
and you.
