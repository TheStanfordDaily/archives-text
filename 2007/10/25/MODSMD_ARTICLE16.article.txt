## An effective response to SoCal wildfires 
### 
I drove down to Los Angeles Monday
night with my girlfriend to report on the
wild tires that have been raging this week
in Southern California.
Driving down the 5 toward L.A.. I was
struck by the number of convoys of state fire
trucks headed toward the disaster. In a four
hour drive, we probably passed about 50 fire
trucks.
In Los Angeles, police convoys screamed
around the city with their sirens on. blocking
dangerous roads, clearing emergency routes
and preparing to evacuate residents. At
times, we saw a dozen police vehicles headed
down the highway together to a new fire, or
20 squad cars parked down a street preparing
an evacuation.
Residents described getting "reverse ( >l 1"
calls — emergency services calling them to
let them know what was going on and that
they needed to get out. In areas in the path of
the fire, lights were on and neighbors were
often moving from house to house, assessing
the situation together as fire crews set up po
sitions.
Homeland Security secretary Michael
Chertoff states that the Federal Emergency

Management Agency has learned its lessons
since Hurricane Katrina. They provided
emergency relief grants yesterday and are
aiming to have 1.900 fire fighters on the
ground by this morning. This is a fast re
sponse and an appropriate one.
The state response has also been impres
sive. Hie California Department of Forestry
and l ire has 45 aircraft at 22 air bases; oper
ates 1.100 fire engines at 800 fire stations;
employs 5,200 personnel; and organizes
5,600 volunteer firefighters during the fire
season. Its budget was increased by over a
quarter to $1.3 billion this year, of which
94% goes to fire protection. California fire
fighters' training is among the best in the na
tion.
In both Los Angeles and San Diego, city

and county units were efficient and well pre
pared. The city of Los Angeles employs
about 3,600 union fire fighters and. thanks to
a $500 million bond issue in 2000, has excel
lent facilities, including a new emergency air
operations base.The county lire department
adds in 1,300 firefighters, 250 engines and 10
helicopters.
Ibis is clearly not a Katrina-scale disaster
— less than 10 percent of the land is burned
in L.A. and Orange Counties, and only 8 per
cent of residents have evacuated, as opposed
to Hurricane katrina. which destroyed an
entire region. The governments in L.A. and
San Diego are still staffed and functioning.
Furthermore, the baseline wealth in Los An
geles and San Diego is much higher, meaning
that more people have access to transporta
tion and alternative housing. But the com
parison is one everyone is drawing, and it is
illustrative.
Almost a million people have been evac
uated, and thousands of homes have been
destroyed, but only five lives have been re
ported lost at press time.
