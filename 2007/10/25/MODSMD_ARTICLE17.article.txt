## Labor Justice and Campus Utilities on the Line: Cardinal CoGen's Contract Negotiations 
### 
A crisis is brewing at Stanford that con
cerns the livelihoods of 16 campus
workers. Simultaneously, it threatens
the delivery of critical utilities to Stanford
University and Stanford Hospitals. Stan
ford's power, steam and chilled water are
produced right here on campus by Cardinal
CoGen. a plant that is owned by General
Electric. While the plant typically delivers re
liable service, its operations are threatened
by an extremely high turnover rate among its
operations and maintenance (O&M) staff â€”
at least 25 percent leave the plant every year.
In nearly half of the workforce left Car
dinal CoGen to seek jobs elsewhere.
ITie result of this outrageous turnover is

that equipment has gone unrepaired and cru
cial operations have recently been botched
by overstretched and undertrained staff.
Both of these problems have caused failures
and lapses in service to Stanford and the
Hospitals just in the past week.
Why does G.E. find retaining its workers
at CoGen so difficult? The main reason is
that the O&M staff receive wages between
15 percent and 33 percent below those paid
to similar workers here at Stanford.The con
tract between the O&M staff and Cardinal
CoGen management expires at the end of
this month, and the two groups have entered
into negotiations over the past three weeks.
To call it "negotiations," however, is gener

ous: So far, CoGen management has turned
an entirely deaf ear to workers' proposals,
dismissing them without offering either ex
planation or counter-proposal.
This situation cannot he tolerated by the
Stanford community, both because of the in
justice to ( oGen workers who keep our cam
pus running and because G.E.'s profit-driven
negligence threatens their ability to do so. All
members of the Stanford Community are en
couraged to read more and to sign a petition at
