## Card kicks off its season 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After a long off-season, Stanford wrestling
will set its starting lineup in place this Saturday
at the annual wrestle-offs, where teammates
will compete against one another for the top
spot in their respective weight classes.
Just because the formal team competitions
are just getting underway again does not mean
that the Cardinal strayed far from the mats or
the weight room this off-season. Third-year
Stanford coach. Kerry McCoy, was excited by
the work his athletes put in during the off-sea
son, singling out six wrestlers likely to see signif
icant action this season at least in part because
they devoted their off-seasons to training.
"We had a good core of guys that were here
throughout the entire summer that were train
ing." he said. "And if you're training all the
time you're going to get better."
For one, senior Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds followed up his conference title and
Ail-American season with perhaps the best
off-season training of his Stanford career.Tan
ner cited the help of new assistant coach Jason
Borrelli as a major factor in the strides he has
taken since his seventh place finish at the
NCAA Championships last March.
"I think this summer was very valuable for
me — 1 got a lot of good work on my tech
nique. I think I really came a long way." Gard
ner said."lt's really the first time ever that I've
really spent a whole summer working out and
I think already I'm seeing the improvements
from it. which generates some excitement for
the year."
The Cardinal has good reason to be excit
ed about this season, with Gardner and fellow
senior Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds both
ranked in the top 10 of the preseason nation
al rankings. Last year Gardner and Zupancic
were the first pair of Stanford wrestlers in
four decades to have Ail-American cam
paigns in the same season. liowever, as Gard
ner explained, the optimism emanating from
the wrestling room in the basement of the Ar
rillaga Family Sports Center is about more
than just the two highest profile Cardinal
grapple rs.
'It looks good right now." Gardner said. "I

mean you can never really account for injuries
or anything like that. But as far as the experi
ence coming hack from last year. I think that
we're going to have potentially one of the best
teams we've ever had here. We have a lot of
proven guys in the lineup, and we also have a
lot of newcomers who either redshirted last
year or are freshmen this year that are really
making some good strides already."

Among the younger wrestlers on the team,
perhaps none have proven more already than
184-pound sophomore Zack Giesen. who
earned co-Pac-10 Freshman of the Year hon
ors last season. And in his mind, the sky is the
limit for the Cardinal in the 2007-2008 cam
paign.
"I think we have a real strong team this
year," he said. "So really, a Pac-10 Champi

onship and high placing at Nationals are
everything we expect. With the team we have
this year there's really no reason why we can't
be the best in the Pac-10 and one of the best in
the country."
The 2007 Wrestle-Offs are slated to begin
this Saturday at 2 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
