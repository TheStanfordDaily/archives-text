Zutz to represent
Stanford in NFHCA
All-Star Game
Cardinal field hockey senior Jess
Zutz was honored for her playing this
year when she was selected to play in
the National Field Hockey Coaches
Association's All-Star Game on Nov.
17 at the University of Maryland.
Zutz, a forward, was one of 38 players
selected from across the country.
Zutz' play has been crucial in
leading Stanford to its best season in
recent years — she leads the team in
goals (eight), game-winning goals
(three) and points (20). A native of
Wilmington, Del.,Zutz is also second
on the team in assists (four) and
shots taken (45). She has been
named NorPac Offensive Player of
the Week twice this year.
"Jess has had an outstanding ca
reer." head coach Lesley Irvine told
GoStanford.com. "We are thrilled
she is being recognized at this level.
Jess is truly a great player."
It is not all over yet for the four
year starter, however. Zutz looks to
lead the Cardinal to its first NCAA
Tournament berth in years: the team
is currently 8-6 overall and 4-1 in
NorPac play.
