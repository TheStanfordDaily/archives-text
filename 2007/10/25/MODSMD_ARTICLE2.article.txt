# Kissinger speaks at Faculty Club
## Perry, Shultz, others discuss nuclear proliferation 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of
State,said last night at the Faculty Club that
he would have struggled to recommend the
use of nuclear weapons against the Soviets,
even when all other military options were
exhausted.
William Perry, former Secretary of De
fense, remembers being woken up at 3 a.m.
in 1978 by a general who reported that
radar showed 200 Soviet missiles headed
toward the American mainland. I le wanted
to know how to respond.
A bipartisan group of six elder states
men. including three former cabinet secre
taries who helped lead America through
the depths of Cold War nightmares, said
Wednesday that the United States must
take concrete steps to stop the proliferation
of nuclear weapons.
The men are on campus this week to try
to come up with a concrete action plan.The
dinner, which about 300 top University
leaders and donors were invited to attend,
was part of a closed-door, two-day I loover
Institution conference.
"We are not doing this as an abstract
statement of desirable objectives,"
Kissinger said. "We're willing to contribute
to a list of specific steps."
Perry said American and Soviet forces

must take their nuclear weapons off hair
trigger, launch-on-warning alert. Sam
Nunn. the former chair of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and director of
the Nuclear Threat Initiative, said the U.S.
should work with Russia to develop a mis
sile defense system that can to respond to
emerging nuclear threats.
"We're about to deploy a system that is
not yet mature for a threat that has not yet
materialized," Nunn said. "For God's sake,
let's realize we're out of the Cold War. We
do not intend to attack the Russians, and
they do not intend to attack us. So let's
work together."
Unlike the Disarmament movement of
the 1980s, led by activists who had never
been in the National Security Situation
Room, the men on the panel at the Faculty
Club — like Kissinger and George Shultz
— were iconic household names at the cen
ter stage of global politics in their time.
ITie high-level meetings coincide with
the 21st anniversary of the summit in Reyk
javik. Iceland between President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev.
On the 20th anniversary of the summit,
which ended in deadlock hut laid the
groundwork for later agreements by both
superpowers to reduce the nuclear stock-
pile, a small group of top foreign pol
icy gurus met at Stanford for discus
sions that led to a Wail Street Jour
nal opinion piece in January calling
for "A World Free of Nuclear
Weapons."
ITie intent of this year's reunion
is to formulate specific next steps for
policy makers to take. Wednesday's
sessions were dedicated to scientific
challenges of disarmament: today

will largely be spent hashing out the
political challenges of convincing
states in the developing world to dis
continue their programs.
"The political questions are even
harder," said Sidney Drell. a
renowned physicist and emeritus pro
fessor at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center. "How do you build
trust?"
Guests had a small wrapped
package with a magnifying glass on
their chairs. Emblazoned on the
metal casing were the words "Trust
but verify" and the signature of the
man who lived by the motto: Ronald
Reagan. Shultz read a letter from

Nancy Reagan that said her hus
band would have supported the way
the group is going about its efforts.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
was scheduled to speak, but the
wildfires in Southern California
forced him to cancel. Instead, for
mer Secretary of State George
Shultz read the governor's prepared
remarks.
In the speech. Schwarzenegger
said that nuclear proliferation war
ranted as much public concern as
global warming — one of his signa
ture issues.
Terrorists will not be deterred by
threats of reprisal, the panelists

agreed, and any nonproliferation plan
needs to consider non-state actors.
Kissinger said that making sure
the Soviets thought America's
threat to use the weapons was credi
ble formed the basis for Mutually
Assured Destruction, a doctrine
that deterred one superpower from
using its weapons against the other
for fear of reprisal.
"How to conduct foreign policy
with a threat you do not want to im
plement," he said,"that has been our
permanent dilemma."
