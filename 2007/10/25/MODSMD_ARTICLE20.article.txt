# Trent Edwards named starter in Buffalo
## Former Cardinal QB takes over permanently 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Buffalo Bills have named former
Stanford quaterback Trent Edwards their
starter — for good.
Last week. Edwards, a rookie, was
named the starter for the Bills games
against the Baltimore Ravens, even
though J.P. Losman, the Bills' first string
quatrerback. was ready to play after com
ing back from a sprained left knee.
Coach Dick Jauron. however, refused
to name Edwards the starter permanently.
Ostensibly. Jauron wanted to give Ed
wards one more week to prove he de
served the role and Losman an extra few
days to recover.
Edwards is 2-1 as a starter — leading
the Bills to their only two victories on the
year — with his sole loss coming to the
Dallas Cowboys, who were undefeated at
the time and needed a last-second field
goal to beat the Bills.
Though Edwards was far from extraor
dinary against the Ravens.he did help Buf
falo score a season-best 19 points on four
separate scoring drives. Under his leader
ship. the Buffalo offense has improved,
scoring more and gaining more yards than
they did with Losman under center.
"He passed the ball efficiently, finding
guys over the middle. I think he did a real
ly good job of knowing what he's seeing
and just playing." said star wide receiver
Lee Evans in an interview with Buffalo-
Bills.com.
As a result, Edwards, a third round pick
in this year's draft, has relegated Losman,
a former first round pick, to the bench. Jau
ron notified Losman and Edwards of his
decision on TUesday. and the Bills issued a
press release shortly thereafter.
This marks the third time in his short
career that Losman has lost his starting
job. And while the previous two times
were to veteran Kelly Holcomb. essential
ly an interim substitute until Losman
could reclaim his job. this move could be
more permanent — if Edwards performs
well. Losman may never start again for the
Bills.
Although Eidwards struggled to find
success at Stanford — he did not win once
last season — he was always regarded as
remarkably talented. As a result, he was
projected as high as an early second round
pick in last year's draft. But questions
about his durability and ability to win


The Associated Press
Trent Edwards has already led the Bills to two wins in three starts after not winning a single game in his
senior season at Stanford. Edwards has now replaced former starter J.P Losman full-time in Buffalo.
eventually arose, and he dropped to
the end of the third round.
Edwards certainly has all the
tools necessary for NFL success:
I le's very mobile (4.7h seconds in the
40 yard dash) for his size (6'3'\ 230
pounds) but is poised in the pocket
and doesn't run unless it's necessary
— I.osman, another athletic 08. has

a habit of running from even the
slightest defensive pressure.
Edwards has an above average
arm and is smart under center, rarely
making a bad throw. This is a stark
contrast to Losman who. after
throwing numerous times into dou
ble, sometimes triple coverage, be
came infamous for his questionable
decision-making.
On the year. Edwards has passed
for 660 yards at a 66% completion
rate. I le has thrown one touchdown
and four interceptions.
His next game will be against the

disappointing New York Jets this
Sunday. Edwards beat the Jets in his
first game as a starter and should ex
pect to beat them again this week
end.
"That's what every franchise
wants. You want one guy who leads
your team." Jauron told the Associ
ated Press. In Buffalo, that "one guy"
has been chosen.
Apparently, the Trent Edwards
era starts now.
