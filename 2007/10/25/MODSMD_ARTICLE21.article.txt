## Alive, but still not kicking 
### 
Alter a thrilling conclusion to
the regular season that saw
the last two playoff spots de
cided on the final day of matches,
Major League Soccer kicks off its
playoffs tonight with the Chicago
Fire hosting P.C. United. ITie only
question is. will anybody care now
that the L.A. Galaxy (who might as
well he known as FC David Beck
ham) will he watching from home?
On the surface, one would think
the MLS should thrive — soccer is
by far the most popular sport in the
world, and the US generally pro
duces some of the best athletes in
the world. On top of that, hundreds
of thousands of children play in
youth leagues every year (think
back to your glory days in AYSO).
But, alas, the beautiful game is
shunned by many of our country's
sports fans.
I'm sure we've all heard someone
preaching the enlightened philoso
phy that soccer is a "wussy sport."
Anyone who has ever gone down
under a crunching slide tackle — or
anyone who saw Zinedine Zidane's
awe-inspiring headbutt in the 2006
World Cup — can tell you that is
certainly not true,so one has to won
der why this opinion, although de
clining in prevalence, persists.
One theory is that these naysay
ers believe in "American Exception
alism" — basically, they think that
America is on a higher level than the
rest of the world and, therefore, does
not need to adopt the world's sport.
Instead, they embrace sports created
in America, such as football (al
though most of the world would
argue that it is not real football), bas
ketball and baseball. As globaliza
tion continues, though, this contin
gent is shrinking.
Interestingly, globalization has
also negatively affected US soccer.
Both the Internet and television
have made it far easier for American
soccer lovers to follow teams and
watch games across the Atlantic,
such as the English Premiership and
Spain's La Liga — generally regard
ed as the two best leagues in the
world.
Because these possibilities now
exist, fans can watch top-flight soc
cer in foreign countries and do not
have to "settle" for the MLS. which is
not a terrible league, but nowhere
near these other two. Unfortunately,
1 have to admit to previously being a
part of this group. I used to follow
only Arsenal FC (currently top of
the table in the English Premier
League), even though they are an
ocean away and the Chicago Fire
played in my hometown.
It was almost like Arsenal played
at such a high level that, after watch
ing them, the MLS just could not
measure up. To use an example I
have commonly heard throughout
campus, it would he like going to Cal
after attending Stanford.
However, with the implementa
tion of the "Beckham Rule" this sea
son — basically allowing teams to
go over their salary cap to sign a
great player — I am warming up to
the MLS again.The rule has allowed
the league to bring in many players
who have experience playing at the
highest level, and even just one of
these players on a team can make
the quality on the pitch increase im
mensely.
Also, this act signifies that the
MLS is serious about attempting to
become a "big league." It would be
foolish to expect that to occur imme
diately. but over a long period of
time it could feasibly happen. Yes. a
lot of the buzz right now has to do
with Beckham's celebrity status
(way too high in my opinion — The
Beckham Cam??), and that will die
down eventually, but as the quality
of the league continues to improve,
our country will have the resources
to cultivate a major domestic league.
Many soccer players, no matter
where in the world they are from,
love American culture. This was ob
viously a major reason for Beckham
coming here and was also cited by
Thierry Henry as a reason for want
ing to plav in the MLS after he fin
ishes his contract ;it Barcelona. So
the more the quality of the MLS im
proves. the more of these players we
can attract, and the better our league
becomes.
And here's the beauty in all of this:
anyone can make a difference. Just by
supporting and watching the games,
you can help stabilize the MLS. ()nce
the owners see the increase in sup
port and stability in the league, they

will be more willing to spend money
on top-quality players and, thus, in
crease the league's quality.
It's basically a win-win. And if
someone still tries to question why
you would watch a "wussy sport,"
you can always follow Zidane's ex
ample.
