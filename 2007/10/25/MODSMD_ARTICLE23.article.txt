## Kessler talks new book, criticizes Rice 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Condoleezza Rice has lacked a long
term vision as America's Secretary of
State. Washington Post reporter Glenn
Kessler told several of Rice's colleagues
during a Wednesday lunch seminar in
Encina I lall.
International Relations Prof. Stephen
Krasner. who served as director of policy
planning in Rice's State Department
from February 2005 to April 2007, stron
g disagreed.
"The administration did have a vi
sion," Krasner told Kessler."! t was strate
gic. lt'sjust proved hard to implement."
Political Science Prof. Michael Mc-
Faul, moderator of the event and a direc
tor at the University's Center on Democ
racy. Development and the Rule of Law,
said that â€” since he first met Rice more
than two decades ago - she has always
seemed like someone with her eyes on
the big picture.
"There's a strategy to her life, if you
will, a rather grand strategy." McFaul said.
Both men said they had not read
Kessler's book, "The Confidante: Con
doleezza Rice and the Creation of the
Bush Legacy," which was published last
month.
Kessler said many of Rice's most well
known successes have been serendipi
tous. I ler ascent from a weak National Se
curity Adviser to a strong Secretary of
State was by no means certain, he said. I le
pointed out that, after the 2004 election,
the former provost had planned to return
to Stanford.
"She looks at the problem right here,"
Kessler said pointing to one corner of the
room, "and doesn't realize the narrow al
leys she finds herself in because she's not
thinking down the road."
Kessler acknowledged that his new
book is "pretty downbeat" about Rice's
reactions to developments in global
hotspots, such as Iran. North Korea and
Palestine.
But Kessler. who still covers the State
Department for the Post,said that he only
passed judgment after intensive report
ing and five hours of exclusive interviews
with Rice for the book.
"It allowed me to step back and put
everything in context," he said of the writ
ing process in an interview yesterday. "As
a day-to-day beat reporter, it's hard to
ever put it together in one single narra

tive."
Kessler's goal was to publish a first
draft of behind-the-scenes history that
both experts and his mother could under
stand. His chapters, with dramatic titles
like "Showdown near Seoul" and
"Blowup over Beirut," are case studies on
how Rice specifically dealt with the for
eign policy crises that boiled over on her
watch.
Kessler. an award-winning journalist,
spent more than 75 minutes with the
uroup of 45 people at the event, co-spon

sored by the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies and the Knight Fel
lowships program.
The audience seemed more interested
in foreign policy than in her likely return
to Stanford [see sidebar].
At the moment, Kessler said her lega
cy looks bleak.
But. he added, "The tide of history
turns."
