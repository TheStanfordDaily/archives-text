# Washington Post reporter's work reveals anecdotes from former provost's Stanford days
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Most of Glenn Kessler's 244-page
hook narrates the first two years of
Condoleezza Rice's term as Secretary
of State. But the Washington Post
diplomatic correspondent also inter
viewed several of her University col
leagues and friends during two trips to
Stanford as a Hoover Institution
Media Fellow.
Rice, who is technically a political
science professor-on-leave, has said
that she plans to return to Stanford
when Bush leaves office in Januarv
2009.
Her success at the University laid
the framework for her introduction to
then Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
1998. And Kessler claimed that her
popularity as a black female assistant
political science professor prompted
Gerhard Casper to appoint her
provost in 1993.
"He wanted to hire someone who
was so young and a minority," Kessler
writes.
Kessler refers to Stanford several
times in the first chapter of the book,
which gives an overview of how "in a
remarkably short period of time. Rice
rose dramatically from ivory-tower ac
ademic to presidential advisor."
'ITie following are excerpts from
Kessler's book:
• "She stood out as a Republican on
the largely liberal campus, and

within the obscure field of Eastern
block military studies, she stood
out for being black, female and
liawkish."
• Rice was only an assistant professor
when she was appointed provost.
She had not been a dean or depart
ment chair.
• When Rice was provost, she met
with students who were upset about
cutbacks in ethnic theme houses at
the Faculty Club. When "a young
white woman raised her hand and
questioned Rice's commitment to
equal opportunity," Rice reported
ly said,"l don't need a lecture from
anyone on racial sensitivity. I've
been black all my life."
• At a party on campus after she be
came Secretary of State, Rice went
to the house of her closest male
friend — Political Science Prof.
Coit Blacker, director and senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies.
"Blacker, who is gay, wanted to
show his partner how tight her be
hind is: he postulated that if he
aimed a quarter at her butt, it
would bounce off like a rocket. He
was right. Rice, who was dancing,
didn't realize what he had done
until everyone began laughing hys
terically. She was flattered — and
proud."
