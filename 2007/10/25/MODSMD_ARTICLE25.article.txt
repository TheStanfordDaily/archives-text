## Ninth Circuit judges spar Kozinski, Reinhardt debate Supreme Court decisions 
### NIKHIL JOSHI 
As he introduced Ninth Circuit Appeals
Court judges Alex Kozinski and Stephen Rein
hardt last night, Law School Dean Larry
Kramer warned an audience of about 150 at the
Law School that most federal judges cannot
and often will not say anything controversial.
Reinhardt wasted no time in disproving
Kramer's theory.
"The Supreme Court is headed downhill,"
Reinhardt said. "Where once the courts were a
haven for those who were oppressed by govern
ment. now those people will have to look else
where."
Reinhardt. one of the most liberal judges in
the country's most overruled circuit court, had
views that stood in stark contrast to those of
Kozinski, a strict constructionist who on Dec. 1
will become Chief Justice of the Ninth Circuit.
Kozinski responded to Reinhardt's criticism
of the Supreme Court by citing Justice Antonin
Scalia's theory that the political process will ul
timately prevail. If you do not like the laws and
the officials who draft them. Kozinski argued,
"kick the rascals out."
Reinhardt dismissed Kozinski's argument,
asserting that the composition of the Supreme
Court is influenced more by luck of the draw
than by public opinion. ITie judge's renowned
liberal wit was in full display as he emphasized
the lack of control the public has over the court.
"The president is supposed to pick the
Supreme Court; the Supreme Court is not sup
posed to pick the president." Reinhardt said in
reference to the infamous Bush v. Gore case
during the 2000 election.
When the discussion turned from legal theo
ry to specific cases, things only became more
contentious. Reinhardt and Kozinksi were at
odds in discussing two decisions from last year's
Supreme Court docket — the case in which the
court banned one Seattle school district from

trying to manufacture racial diversity in its high
schools and the court's overturning of a cam
paign finance reform act on the grounds of pro
tecting free speech.
While Kozinski quickly labeled both deci
sions as "entirely defensible," Reinhardt was
not as supportive of the nation's highest court.
Reinhardt saw a double standard in the court's
application of the First Amendment to the cam
paign finance case, while it refused to extend
freedom of speech to the Alaskan high school
student who made a "bong hits for Jesus" sign.
"I think it depends on whose speech it is and
whether they like who it is," Reinhardt said.
Hie liberal judge was also deeply critical of
the Seattle school district decision.
"Blacks don't win in this court," Reinhardt
said.
The judges also discussed the Supreme
Court's decision to uphold a ban on partial
birth abortion.
Reinhardt argued that the decision was
made simply because "five white males" were
offended by partial birth abortion. He pointed
out that the alternative — abortion when the
fetus is still in the womb — is allowed, even
though it may be more dangerous than partial
birth abortion in some cases.
Reinhardt's assertion prompted Kozinski's
most impassioned rebuttal of the night.
Kozinksi pointed out that the court could have
used the case as an opportunity to overturn Roe
v. Wade and ban abortion outright but instead
chose to be more moderate.
"This is hardly the end of rights, as Judge
Reinhardt would have us believe," Kozinski
said.
"1 didn't say it was a disaster that a small
number of women would die as a result of the
Supreme Court," Reinhardt wryly countered.
When asked by The Daily why he was so un
afraid to push the limits, Judge Reinhardt was
blunt.
"I think it's an obligation of all judges to be
honest and inform students where the law is
going," he said.
