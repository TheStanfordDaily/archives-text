## Annual concert honors life of Pearl Alum remembered through eclectic works 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Judging by the audience that gath
ered last night at Memorial Church, the
legacy of Daniel Pearl '85 is far from
forgotten at Stanford.
Several hundred community mem
bers filled one of the University's most
impressive venues last night as the
"Harmony for Humanity" concert
showcased a broad range of music for
over an hour. The event was part of a
network of some 300 concerts held
across the world this October in memo
ry of Pearl — the slain journalist who
was kidnapped and murdered in Pak
istan in 2002 — whose life was high
lighted by his inspiring, globetrotting
reportage and a love of music.
"This affirmation of musical diversi
ty envelops us as we recognize the hu
manity in the unfamiliar, the harmony
of the human heart." said Dean of the
Office of Religious Life Patricia Karlin-
Neumann in her opening remarks. "In
memory of Daniel Pearl's welcome
across borders, his curiosity about the
unknown, we are here tonight to reaf
firm our own desire to reach out to
those we mav have feared and to listen

for the strains of friendship and hope."
The performances last night
spanned across musical genres, physical
borders and historical periods, tradi -
tional Korean and Japanese drumming
pieces by Hwimori and Stanford Taiko,
respectively, bookended a concert that
juxtaposed legends Bach and
Beethoven with some contemporary
stars of Stanford's music department.
Sam Adams *08 debuted his compo
sition "111 performed by the Stanford
New Ensemble. Music Prof. Mark Ap
plebaum also received enthusiastic ap
plause for his string quartet "20."
A peculiar moment came toward the
end of the concert when Applebaum led
a "sonic meditation," urging the audi
ence to collectively sing at random
pitches in a slow crescendo as he walked
up the stage stairs. ITie expansive hall
first fell into a deep silence before the
several hundred audience members
shrugged off their shyness and an eerie
hum of barely recognizable human
voices increased under Applebaum's
direction.
The voices diminished as Apple
baum slowly walked back down the
stairs, and at least a few contented
smiles had lighted the faces of the audi
ence as Stanford Taiko took the stage
for a pulsating finale.
