# Shultz jokingly reads absent Governor's speech
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Hoover Institution Fellow and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz, wearing his
trademark red sports coat and how tie. was the
moderator of Wednesday night's panel in the

Faculty Club on nuclear nonproliferation.
The event was both somber and alarming,
but that didn't stop Shultz from showing off his
lighter side.
When raging wildfires in Southern Califor
nia forced Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to can
cel his visit, he called Shultz to ask if the 1 loover
fellow would read his prepared remarks about
"lifting the nuclear nightmare from our nation's
future."
Shultz did — while trying to mimic the gov
ernor's Austrian accent when talking about the

great state of KAL-E-FORNJA.
The Schwarzenegger advisor also didn't skip
the introduction.
"George Shultz is one of the people I admire
most in the world — someone for whom 1 feel
great affection," Shultz deadpanned, reading
from the governor's script to hearty laughter.
When I lenry Kissinger, former secretary of
state, got his chance to speak after dinner, he
protested th;it he had not been asked.

Former national leaders expressed concern regarding a nuclear threat and discussed the ways to stop the spread of such weapons at a two-day
Hoover Institution conference. From left to right: George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, Bill Perry, Max Kampelman and Sidney Drell.
"I'm still recovering from the fact
that I wasn't asked to read the
Schwarzenegger speech," said
Kissinger, whose accent is also the
butt of jokes.
Then Gerhard Casper, former
University president, yelled "What
about me, Henry?"
