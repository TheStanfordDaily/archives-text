### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hoping to channel email chatter and In
ternet petitions into a constructive public
forum, students formally debated the
1 loover Institution's appointment of former
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a
distinguished visiting fellow last night.
Stanford Debate Team members Anish
Mitra '09 and Michael Baer 'OS opened with
arguments for and against, respectively, a
resolution that. "Donald Rumsfeld's ap
pointment to 1 loover is good for Stanford."
before opening up the floor for public com
ment.
Intellectual diversity, as well as Rums
feld's competence and qualifications for a
visiting fellowship, were the primary points
of contention during the hour-long debate,
which drew nearly 1(H) students, faculty and
interested community members to Kresge
Auditorium.
"We can either embrace diversity or shut
it out," Mitra said, defending the appoint
ment in the name of academic freedom.
"When confronted with ideas that we don't
agree with we can either engage them or try
to shut them off."
Baer, for his part, acknowledged the im
portance of academic freedom but chal
lenged Rumsfeld's appointment on person
al integrity.
"He lost the loyalty of the Hush adminis
tration. an administration known for being
loyal; he lost the trust of the American peo
ple," Baer said. "Why should we trust him
with upholding the name of our university?"
Graduate School of Business Prof.
Jonathan Bendor, who later said he found
the debate's rapid format "uncomfortable

and quite frustrating," played devil's advo
cate, challenging the debaters to defend
their assertions: "What are his qualifications
for a panel on terrorism?" he said. "What
type of damage would he do to the Universi
ty's reputation?"
The University announced in September
that Rumsfeld would be joining I ioover for
a yearlong visiting fellowship, serving on a
task force on ideology and terrorism.The an
nouncement drew the ire of students, faculty
and alumni who expressed concern with his
record. An online "No To Rumsfeld" peti
tion of Stanford community members gar
nered more than 3.900 signatures.
Limited to speaking for one minute, stu

dents in the audience took turns defending
and condemning the appointment on moral,
ethical and intellectual grounds.
"He knows his stuff" said lan Girard 11
of the former Defense Secretary's qualifica
tions. "Iraq is in the past. He should he al
lowed to come and learn from his mistakes
and learn from others."
But Stephanie Sy 'II expressed skepti
cism that Rumsfeld would come to Stanford
with an open mind.
"He's never acknowledged failure be
fore," she said. "Do we want Stanford to he
associated with this type of man?"
