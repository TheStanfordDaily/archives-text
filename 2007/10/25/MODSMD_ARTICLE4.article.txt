### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hoping to channel email chatter and In
ternet petitions into a constructive public
forum, students formally debated the
1 loover Institution's appointment of former
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a
distinguished visiting fellow last night.
Stanford Debate Team members Anish
Mitra '09 and Michael Baer 'OS opened with
arguments for and against, respectively, a
resolution that. "Donald Rumsfeld's ap
pointment to 1 loover is good for Stanford."
before opening up the floor for public com
ment.
Intellectual diversity, as well as Rums
feld's competence and qualifications for a
visiting fellowship, were the primary points
of contention during the hour-long debate,
which drew nearly 1(H) students, faculty and
interested community members to Kresge
Auditorium.
"We can either embrace diversity or shut
it out," Mitra said, defending the appoint
ment in the name of academic freedom.
"When confronted with ideas that we don't
agree with we can either engage them or try
to shut them off."
Baer, for his part, acknowledged the im
portance of academic freedom but chal
lenged Rumsfeld's appointment on person
al integrity.
"He lost the loyalty of the Hush adminis
tration. an administration known for being
loyal; he lost the trust of the American peo
ple," Baer said. "Why should we trust him
with upholding the name of our university?"
Graduate School of Business Prof.
Jonathan Bendor, who later said he found
the debate's rapid format "uncomfortable

and quite frustrating," played devil's advo
cate, challenging the debaters to defend
their assertions: "What are his qualifications
for a panel on terrorism?" he said. "What
type of damage would he do to the Universi
ty's reputation?"
The University announced in September
that Rumsfeld would be joining I ioover for
a yearlong visiting fellowship, serving on a
task force on ideology and terrorism.The an
nouncement drew the ire of students, faculty
and alumni who expressed concern with his
record. An online "No To Rumsfeld" peti
tion of Stanford community members gar
nered more than 3.900 signatures.
Limited to speaking for one minute, stu

dents in the audience took turns defending
and condemning the appointment on moral,
ethical and intellectual grounds.
"He knows his stuff" said lan Girard 11
of the former Defense Secretary's qualifica
tions. "Iraq is in the past. He should he al
lowed to come and learn from his mistakes
and learn from others."
But Stephanie Sy 'II expressed skepti
cism that Rumsfeld would come to Stanford
with an open mind.
"He's never acknowledged failure be
fore," she said. "Do we want Stanford to he
associated with this type of man?"


MAGGIE SKORTCHEVA/The Stanford Daily
Anish Mitra '09 of the Stanford Debate Team was selected to argue in favor of the
proposal "Donald Rumsfeld's appointment to Hoover is good for Stanford" last night.
The small contingent of Stanford
Public Safety officers on hand proved
unnecessary as discussion remained
civil and concise. The loudest audi
ence reaction came in response to
Laura Wadden '09, who drew ap
plause when she said. "I will not ac
cept having a war criminal in our pres
ence. We have blood on our hands."
Stephanie Wright '11 said the ap
pointment was positive for the Uni

versity because it has inspired such
student debate.
"The campus is buzzing," she said.
"People are talking,things are getting
done and there is more student in
volvement. That in itself is good for
campus."
Others said the nature of the fel
lowship, a one-year visiting appoint
ment. was little cause for concern.
"For Heaven's sake, it's called the
Hoover Institution." said Crystal
Zhang '10. "How competent do you
have to be?"
