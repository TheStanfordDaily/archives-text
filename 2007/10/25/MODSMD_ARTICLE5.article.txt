# Full Moon Rising

### CATHERINE LE 
Grabby hands and wet sucking lips: what
more could you ask for? The free
wheeling, spit-swapping, wild night is
upon us once again. Full Moon on the Quad
gears up in Main Quad tonight at 10:30. The
sophomore class presidents have made slight
modifications to this year's event, such as intro
ducing nametags to encourage verbal exchange
before the more traditional tongue wrestling.
They will also try to foster a more intimate at
mosphere this year through less lighting.
While the deluge of kissing frenzies sweeps
over the Main Quad, the police and staff of the
Sexual 1 lealth Peer Resource Center (SHPRC)
as well asVaden 1 lealth Center will try their best
to keep the riotous love fest in check.
Officer Chris Cohendet, the event coordina
tor for the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, and campus police will be placing moni
tors across the Quad to push for a dry and safe
event.
"Our focus for this event is safety," Cohen
det said. "In the past we have seen alcohol-re
lated crimes and medical issues intertwined

with this event."
Cohendet said that police and University
staff will he patrolling the Quad for students
who show signs of inebriation and that arrests
are possible.
Vanessa Pascoe '08, the campus-wide out
reach coordinator for the SHPRC, will educate
the student body on safe sex and will be handing
out free condoms and fliers. Though the con
doms are free, students should not expect to get
them without effort.
"We are going to have a more interactive
component," Pascoe said. "Students can come
up to our table and answer some trivia ques
tions. They'll still get a condom, but this way
they'll learn something."
Vaden officials will also be dishing out free
mouthwash, mints and chocolate kisses, as well
as free counseling from the peer health educa
tors (PHEs).
Daniel Sean Bradley'oB,a PHI in West Lag,
said he wanted freshmen to remain safe and
comfortable.
"Just make wise decisions." he
said. "Don't feel pressure to partici
pate. Stay among friends."
The sophomore class presidents
assured The Daily that they have
planned an evening friendly to kissers
and non-kissers alike, filled with
dance and music performances by
groups such as DVB.
After all, not everyone is excited
about partaking in the merriment.
Some consider the modern Full

Moon a deterioration of the original
tradition.
"I'm disappointed of this mono
getting fest," said Kate Thomas '11.
"1 heard that it used to be chivalrous
and sweet, where the freshman
would get a kiss by a senior on the
cheek and a rose. Now, it's just some
wild orgy."
But with the promise of lightheart-

Ed fun and wild romps, many fresh
men are having a hard time holding in
the excitement.
"1 want to see what the tradition's
all about," said Emily Rains'll, "be
cause I've been hearing about it since
sixth grade."
