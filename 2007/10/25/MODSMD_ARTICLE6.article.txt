## China research facility in works Peking University in Beijing to host overseas program 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In hopes of expanding Stanford's presence
in China, the University is now in the process
of developing a new research facility on the
campus of Peking University in Beijing as part
of the Bing Overseas Studies Program

(BOSP).
The new facility has just entered its initial
planning phases.The campus is expected to en
compass a broad range of research from a vari
ety of departments, according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Jean Oi.who is involved 111 planning
for the proposed facility.
"We already have a strong BOSP program
in Beijing at Peking University." Oi said in an
email toThe Daily." ITiis would build on that to
encourage more students and facultv across
the different schools to have an over
seas experience. We would like to
have a center that could allow our
faculty to hold seminars, workshops
and do collaborative work with
scholars in China."
BOSP currently operates over
seas study programs in 10 cities
around the globe, including Beijing,
in addition to overseas summer sem
inars held each summer at a variety
of locations worldwide. While these

overseas programs are open to all
undergraduates, the new Beijing re
search facility is expected to he uti
lized primarily by graduate students
and faculty.
Oi said that it is unclear as of yet
which specific programs will he the
focus of the research, but the door is
open to a wide range of areas.
"The nature and type of research
will very much depend on the projects
initiated by different Stanford faculty
and students," said Oi."There is no set
agenda, although we expect there to
be a variety of research topics."
BOSP and Peking University of
ficials will have to work out ihe de
tails of their agreement as planning

proceeds. For now, however, it is
more or less clear that, whatever the
nature of the facility, it will be seen
primarily as an arm of Stanford, de
veloped for its students and faculty.
"There may be some special
workshops and short-term courses
that local students can take, but most
of the classes will be those offered
through the Overseas Study Pro
gram," Oi said. "For those classes, as
currently is the practice, a few Chi
nese students can participate but this
is mainly a program for Stanford stu
dents."
