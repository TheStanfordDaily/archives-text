October 25,1972: Bomb
threats are inexcusable
Numerous classes and examina
tions have been disrupted by bomb
threats in the last two days. On Mon
day, a threat was directed simultane
ously at Cubberley and Dinkspiel au
ditoriums and yesterday a threat was
directed at the Chemistry Building.
These mindless acts of terrorism
are, to say the least, inexcusable.
Bomb threats might not seem seri
ous in comparison to hijackings, sky
jackings. kidnappings.or actual bomb
ings. but they can still pose major
problems. In the case of the Chrmistry
building, the dangers of resulting hasty
actions should be obvious with chemi
cals and radioactive materials present.
Stanford has had more than its
share of deplorable terrorism in re
cent years: the arson at Junipero, the
bombing of the President's ()ffice, and
the arson at Lathrop I louse.
We are lucky that no one has been
seriously injured because of terrorism
on this campus. Such luck can't last for
ever.
