October 26,1933: Dobbs
Feared Kidnapped; Push
Police Search
Search for Barrett Willoughby
Dobhs, Stanford student and son of
Hugh Barrett Dobbs, popular radio
announcer, was pressed last night by
San Francisco and statewide police
agencies, after the deserted high
powered car of young Dobbs was
discovered early yesterday morning
in San Francisco.
Objects of the search were two
"suspicious looking" men seen with
Dobbs TUesday afternoon in his car
on Market Street. At the time Dobbs
was seen, he seemed to be in a
drugged or "beaten up" condition,
the youth s father said.
Fear that the 20-yearold boy,
missing since Monday morning when
he left for school, had been kid
napped was strengthened yesterday
when an unsigned telegram sent
from San Francisco was received at
the family home in Burlingame.
Though the message offered no clue
as to the whereabouts of the missing
youth, it was thought to be the initial
effort of the abductors to establish
contact with the family.
