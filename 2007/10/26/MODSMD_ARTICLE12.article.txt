# When 76 majors aren't enough
## Students design, pursue own academic programs 
### CHELSEA MA 
When it came time for Meredith Bell '08
to declare her major at the end of sophomore
year,she was stuck.
"I took two quarters off junior year be
cause I didn't know what I was going to be
studying," she said. "I had a huge problem
with,' What am I going to major in?"'
Bell, inspired by a class on Gandhian non
violence and her time volunteering at
refugee camps in Zambia, wanted to take a
more independent route. She chose to design
her own major, called Peace and Conflict
Studies.
Individually Designed Majors (IDMs)
give students the flexibility to shape their
major according to their proposed academic
program. It's intended, as Bell put it, "for
people who really, really do know what they
want to do," rather than for students who are
uncertain.
And that's no wonder — the application
process must be completed sophomore year,
is rigorous and requires careful planning.
Prospective IDM students are expected to
write a proposal explaining why they want to
design their own major, and why majoring in
an available area won't work.They must also
outline which courses they will take each
quarter, detail how each course applies to
their created field of study and ensure that
their study list is at least 75 units.

Among other criteria, applicants are re
quired to submit three letters of support
from faculty advisors in different depart
ments and maintain a minimum 3.5 CiPA.
According to Roni Holeton, senior assistant
dean for the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. the School receives about four appli
cations a year and normally accepts one or
two. Proposals are evaluated each spring by
the School's Curriculum Committee.
Bell's first proposal was rejected her
sophomore year, putting her in such a rut
that she almost transferred to UC-Berkeley.
"Part of the reason why it wasn't ap
proved the first round was because I didn't
have a clear enough picture of what I wanted
to get out of it," Bell said.
After a complicated process, her major
was finally approved this spring.
But getting an I DM accepted isn't always
so difficult. Juliann Schamel '08, who is ma
joring in Ecology and Nature Writing, ap
plied successfully her freshman year.
"It was a lot easier than 1 thought it would
be," she said. "1 think the hardest part was
finding those three advisors who I felt 1 could
approach — especially since it was only my
first year."
Because the engineering field is constant
ly developing, the School of Engineering par
ticularly supports students who want to pur
sue IDMs. Applying entails a similar ap
proach — a proposal, four-year plan com
prising a minimum of 90 units and a letter of
support from one primary advisor. A com
mittee works with students on their propos
als so the one to three that are submitted
each year are usually accepted, according to

Darlene Lazar of the School of Engineering.
Gabriella Hdez '08 realized that tailoring
her own engineering major was more suit
able for her desired career.
"1 started school thinking I wanted to go
into medicine, so I took a lot of biology,
chemistry and physics courses freshman and
sophomore year." she said.
After working for a venture capital com
pany in the biotech industry.she changed her
mind, and is now majoring in Financial Engi
neering in the Biotech Industry.
"I wanted to continue studying bio be
cause I liked the coursework, but I also want
ed to learn more about finance," I klez said.
"It's nice being able to pick and choose my
courses across the different departments,
rather than take courses that are required of
a major, but not related to what I want to do."
Students and administrators alike say that
this is the main benefit of the I DM program
— it gives motivated students who are pas
sionate about a subject the freedom to select
their own core classes. It's the applications
that show, according to IDM criteria,
"breadth and depth within the academic dis
cipline" and "a clear academic goal" that are
accepted.
"Having to put that much time, energy
and thought into what I want to do has just
been so valuable for me," Bell said. "The
whole proccss of figuring out your purpose
and justifying every single class you take
gives you such a clear understanding of what
you want to get out of school."
