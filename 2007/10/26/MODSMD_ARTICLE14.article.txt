## Faculty address athletic policy 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Last night's Faculty Senate meeting focused on the
discussion of athletic policy reforms — not just at Stan
ford, but at all Division I-A NCAA schools.
Tom Wasow. linguistics professor and representative
to the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics (COIA).
presented a report on COIA's most recent proposals for
athletic reform. COIA is a group uniting the faculty sen
ates of Division I-A schools to provide a "cohesive facul
ty voice on athletics reform at the national level." accord
ing to the group's Weh site.
I"he alliance of faculty senates convened at Stanford
last May to produce a list of 28 proposals for change in in
tercollegiate athletics, particularly within the legislation
of the NCAA. According to Wasow. Stanford already
serves as a model for the reforms suggested.
"We are an outlier," Wasow said. " ITiere's no other
school that is this demanding on its students."
In particular, Wasow added, recommendations re
garding consistent admissions policies among athletes
and non-athletes are not an issue at Stanford.
"Our athletes are at the highest level both athletically
and academically," Wasow said.'i tell my colleagues that
1 can't tell which of my students are athletes and which
are not, and they're surprised by that."
However, he continued, some of COIA's recommen
dations remain pertinent to Stanford. Currently, the Uni
versity has no process for comparing enrollment data be
tween student athletes and non-athletes. COIA recom
mends that this type of evaluation be made in order to

preserve academic integrity. The faculty met the recom
mendation with general approval.
"1 worked on this kind of comparison report years ago
with [former Stanford President Donald] Kennedy, and I
think it would he good to do again," said Biological Sci
ences Prof. Robert Simoni. noting the commission find
ings showed that Cardinal athletes were on par with
other Stanford students.
"The news was that there was no news," Simoni added.
In order to implement the changes, senate members
referred the item to the Senate's ( ommittee on ( ommii
tees. which will orchestrate a relationship between the
Committee on Athletics. Physical (Education and Recre
ation (CAPER) and the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP). CAPER reports to Presi
dent John I lennessy.but would, it granted, have an ex-of
ficio member on C-USP to address the issues raised by
COIA and ultimately enact the pertinent recommenda
tions.
Also at last night's meeting. Hennessy announced
that a task force has been created to discuss increasing
the incoming freshman class size. English Prof. Ramon
Saldivar and Board of Trustees member Jim Canales
were both named to the task force. Hennessx jokingh
commented that the group will be searching for "wis
dom."
" Iliey are going to bring an insightful perspective on
the change," Hennessy said, particularly in regard to
"both the cost of [increasing the size of the freshman
class] and the timing."
