## Evers gains secretarial appointment at last 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The U.S. Senate made Hoover Fellow
Williamson Evers wait a long time — eight
months, to be exact — but fortunately for Evers, it
wasn't forever.
Frustration was mounting for the education
guru, as were fears that he might never assume the
position, but last week the Senate finally con
firmed Evers. B.A. '72. M.A. '76, and Ph.D. '87, as
the assistant secretary for the Office of Planning,
Evaluation and Policy Development at the U.S.
Department of Education.
"Bill is a knowledgeable, trusted advisor with
vast experience in education policy, and I'm
thrilled to have him at the helm of my policy
team," U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret

"I'm thrilled to have him
at the helm of my policy
team."
— MARGARET SPELLINGS, U.S.
Secretary of Education

Spellings said. "As assistant secretary. Bill will
help ensure the policies developed by the depart
ment are based on sound, scholarly research and
serve the best interests of America's students."
Evers was nominated in February by President

George W. Bush. Like so many others tapped by
the President, Evets faced a confirmation struggle
as he waited in Washington in the interim, serving
as Spellings' senior advisor.
Political Science Prof, and Hoover Fellow
Terry Moe, a personal friend of Evers'. said in an
interview in September that there was a chance
the Senate might stall Evers' nomination until
after Bush's term is over. Moe suspected a trail ol
bitter enemies of Evers and powerful teachers'
unions lobbying behind the scenes.
With his confirmation in hand, though, Evers
can finally sleep soundly knowing that, for the re
maining year of Bush's presidency, he has a na
tional platform to do what he loves to do best:
shape education policy.
After getting his three Stanford
degrees in political science, Evers
shifted his focus and quickly became
an authority in education policy with
the backing of prominent academics,
including the majority of Stanford's
mathematics department.
Evers strengthened his ties with
the President when he served as an
education policy advisor to Bush

during his 2(KX) and 2004 campaigns.
He then departed for the Middle
East in 2003 to serve as a senior ad
visor for education to Administrator
L. Paul Bremer, 111 of the Coalition
Provisional Authority in Iraq, where
Evers helped restart Iraqi schools.
He has also taught political science
at Santa Clara University and
Emory University.
Evers, who has not yet been
sworn in at the White House, was
unavailable for comment.
