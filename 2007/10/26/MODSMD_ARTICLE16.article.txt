## Editorial Board Questioning Nobel authority 
### 
The Nobel Prize is regarded by many in
academia as the most coveted award
for one's achievements. After a long
life of dedication to a field, specialists of
physiology or medicine, literature, physics,
economics, peace and chemistry hope to be
recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee
and catapulted into the annals of history.
Worldwide recognition, mainstream admi
ration and substantial prize money natural
ly follow. So does courting from leading re
search institutions across the world, with
Stanford as no exception. With 17 Nobel
laureates on faculty, the Stanford communi
ty greatly appreciates having so many distin
guished persons contributing to University
education. We should, however, show seri
ous reservations if such laureates misapply
their legitimacy to advance reprehensible
opinions.
Consider the following remarks:
On obesity: "Whenever you interview fat
people, you feel bad. because you know
you're not going to hire them."
On genetically engineering beauty:"Peo
ple say it would be terrible if we made all
girls pretty. 1 think it would be great."
On race:"[l am] inherently gloomy about
the prospect of Africa...all our social policies
are based on the fact that their intelligence
is the same as ours â€” whereas all the testing
says not really."
All of these comments were made by
James Watson, co-winner of the 1%2 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the dis
covery of the structure of DNA.The last re
mark, on race, was made about two weeks
ago, fueling a scandal that has sent the scien
tific community fleeing from his cause. Invi
tations to book promotions and lectures
have been rescinded. Most recently. Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, a research insti
tution in New York, suspended Watson's di
rectorship. leading Watson to resign yester

day.
All of this backlash is completely justi
fied. His discovery, which is probably one of
the most important advancements of our
time in the field of biology, does not license
him to spew offensive comments in public
settings without presenting conclusive evi
dence for his claims.
Such outlandish comments from an oth
erwise revered scientist may seem quite sur
prising. Watson himself is surprised at his
comments, later apologizing for being so un
ambiguously racist. "1 can certainly under
stand why people, reading those words, have
reacted in the ways they have," he said. "To
all those who have drawn the inference from
my words that Africa, as a continent, is
somehow genetically inferior, 1 can only
apologise unreservedly." I lis ensuing clarifi
cation. however, puts into question the "un
reserved" nature of his apology:
"We do not yet adequately understand
the way in which the different environments
in the world have selected over time the
genes which determine our capacity to do
different things...This is not a discussion
about superiority or inferiority, it is about
seeking to understand differences, about
why some of us are great musicians and oth
ers great engineers."
I"he lackluster apology does not help
Watson's track record. Isolated admissions
of guilt do not rectify repeated offenses. As
a high profile individual and a well-respect
ed scientist, it may be easier for him to de
nounce his mistakes and move forward suc
cessfully. Such a turn of events would be
tragic and would tarnish the dignity of the
scientific community at large. It is impor
tant, then, that we steadfastly admonish
even Nobel laureates when such rebukes
are due.
