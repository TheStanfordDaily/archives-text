# Oddities & Katie-o-Syncrasies
## I don't believe in talent 
### 
I hear it all the time, I swear. He's a genius.
He aced his chem final. .She is brilliant.
She ruined the curve in every math class.
She's a mind-bogglingly gifted painter.
He's implausibly good at soccer. She's a bona
fide Lisa Simpson when it comes to the sax.
They are all so talented.
My dictionary tells me that "talent" per
tains to a person who possesses unusual in
nate ability. I'm here to tell you. folks, that I
don't believe it for one minute. I don't. Grant
ed, there are a whole lot of intelligent,
thoughtful, creative, athletic people on this
campus. (Often, for my self-esteem. 1 wish
there were fewer.) But geniuses and bril
liance? You want to know how 4.3 GPA got
those damn A+s? Or how Jazz Combo Pi
anist got those magic fingers?
ITiev friggin' studied their brains out.
ITie authors of Freakanomics (a great,
quick read, btw), Steven Levitt and Stephen
Dubner. published an article in The New
York Times Magazine entitled, "A Star Is
Made: Where Does Talent Really Come
From?" The two economists reference cur
rent research that explores what makes peo
ple good at things they do.
One group of researchers analyzing ex
perts at Scrabble, darts, golf and surgery
agree that talent is overvalued. Instead, the
researchers point to the power of "deliberate
practice" — practice that includes goal-set
ting. immediate feedback, and focus on tech
nique. as well as the outcome.
Studies have shown that memory isn't
linked genetically — incredible increases in
random-number memorization can be
achieved through studying how to memorize
and with memorization practice. In a look at
elite soccer players, it was found that a vast
majority of European World Cup players
were born in January, February and March —
Jan. 1 cut-off dates for youth leagues favor
older and more experienced players.
Florida State Psychology Prof. Anders Er
icsson writes on the new findings: "A lot of
people believe there are some inherent limits
they were born with. But there is surprisingly
little hard evidence that anyone could attain
any kind of exceptional performance without
spending a lot of time perfecting it."
So.stars aren't born.The self-made man is
truly self-made. And practice does make per
fect.
How liberating! How freeing! How posi
tively unfettering! The world is my oyster, al
beit an oyster of hard work, repetitive prac
tice and focused rehearsal. (If I had a nickel
for every hard-working oyster...)
There is something to be said for biology
and sports. Some people are born
tall, others are meant to be gymnasts.
Kenyans are amazing at crosscountry.There
are benefits and limitations from genetics:
slow-twitch versus fast-twitch muscle, maxi
mal oxygen consumption, economical strides
and strokes.

But for Yao there is Muggsy. For tiny Keri
Strug there is the solemn and towering Svet
lana Khorkina. Practice can still overcome
the (dis)advantages of height.
I know some people think they are just
"wired" one way or another. They just get
math.or they just can write tluidly and effort
lessly. But I think this attribution to talent as
God-given, built-in and unchangeable is
oddly deterministic and cheats Practice of the
recognition it deserves. You feel that you can't
do something because you aren't good at it.
But why aren't you good at it? Why doesn't
the science nerd feel comfortable philoso
phizing about Plato.or the Proust-loving Eng
lish major enjoy math-class p-sets?
It is always easier to blame our brains.
But you can train your brain, too — it will
just take two things which humans (and that
last guy I liked) never want to give: time and
focus.
Tliere are some who say that those physics
geniuses never study, but I argue that they do.
Those pesky AP classes in high school and
Stanford classes with overlapping material
are forms of studying and practicing.
And then there are some people who are
just better and thus faster at studying. In all of
its meta-gloriousness. they've studied how
best to study, and can efficiently review, test
their knowledge and pinpoint material they
understand less clearly.
Is that genius, or simply finely-tuned, well
oiled. expert cramming technique?
ITiink of all the things we practice but
never attribute to natural, in-born talent:
kissing, gardening, sudoku, cooking, typing,
room-decorating and driving, and even test
taking. Like areas of study, or the arts, they
just require some hands-on,down-home,old
time practice. God knows my actual aptitude
in reasoning and analysis didn't change in be
tween the two months I took the SATs, I just
practiced how to take the damn thing.
So. the guy next to you is good at math.
But get inspired. With a few reps and a little
elbow grease you can conquer differential
equations with equal adeptness, not to men
tion become a better painter or get better at
volleyball. Or. really, get gtxxJ at whatever
your heart desires. We can do exactly what we
love, as long as we love it enough to do it.

kissing, gardening, sudoku, cooking, typing,
room-decorating and driving, and even test
taking. Like areas of study, or the arts, they
just require some hands-on,down-home,old
time practice. God knows my actual aptitude
in reasoning and analysis didn't change in be
tween the two months I took the SATs, I just
practiced how to take the damn thing.
So. the guy next to you is good at math.
But get inspired. With a few reps and a little
elbow grease you can conquer differential
equations with equal adeptness, not to men
tion become a better painter or get better at
volleyball. Or. really, get gtxxJ at whatever
your heart desires. We can do exactly what we
love, as long as we love it enough to do it.
