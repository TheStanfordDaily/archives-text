In the most recent Republican presidential
debate, John McCain cracked a joke about
how Hillary Clinton tried to earmark feder
al money for a Woodstock Museum: "Now my
friends, 1 wasn't there. I'm sure it was a cultural
and pharmaceutical event. I was tied up at the
time."
It's such a truism that the late 1960s were the
crucible of the modern political imagination
that to restate it, and make it the premise of a
column, is a little embarrassing. But so long as
Woodstock and Chicago and Tet continue to
haunt us, there's no getting around it. Besides
which, for all that we dwell on it, 1 think there's
some clearing up that needs to go on.
McCain's imprisonment was horrifying, as
was the war that encompassed it. And.on top of
all the credit that he deserves for his heroism,
McCain surely does get just a little bit more for
making what is presumably the first-ever LSD
joke in a presidential debate (and a Republican
one at that).
That said, I'd like an explanation of precise
ly why Woodstock doesn't deserve a museum.
Woodstock was a seminal moment in Ameri
can cultural history, and the immense resent
ment it faces, along with hippies in general, rep
resents a reactionary strain in our politics.
McCain's joke captures, in three sentences,
the essence of American politics since 1968. In
1968, Nixon got elected bemoaning "unprece
dented lawlessness," "unprecedented racial vi
olence" and "hostile demonstration." It's true
that the social regimentation of the 1950s and
earlier — racial segregation, institutionalized
sexism, sexual repression, etc. — didn't go
down easily, and the struggle against them was
n't always pretty, or defensible (e.g. the Weath
ermen's bombing campaign).
But it's a damn good thing that it came out
the way it did. First of all, the collapse of the old
racist, sexually morbid society has been so
gradual and peaceful that it isn't even over yet,
decades later. Second, there's simply no doubt
that most Americans would rather live in

today's America than Dwight Eisenhower's.
People have voted,as it were, with their feet.
And the rest of their bodies. We're most of us
pretty glad, I think, that sex can be spoken
about at louder than a whisper, and with mem
bers of the opposite sex. Few dare mourn ex
plicitly the passing of Jim Crow and the draft.
And I suspect you could find a pretty good ma
jority to support the idea that Jimi Hendrix
was, indeed, one of the most extraordinary mu
sicians of modern times.

I'd like an explanation
of precisely why
Woodstock doesn't
deserve a museum.

But we're not an entirely single-minded
people, Americans. We've been known to do
one thing, and sanctimoniously vote for anoth
er. This is why Bush claims his favorite song is
the Everly Brothers' "Wake Up Little Susie."
Recorded, of course, in 1957, it's about a couple
that goes on a date to a movie.only to fall asleep
and worry about the scandal of getting home so
late. It's perfect, right up to the diminutive epi
thet attached to Susie's name.
have spent the decades since
against rock and roll

and the era of social change that it symbolized.
Nixon's vice president. Spiro Agnew. used to
joke about "acid, amnesty and abortion" as the
Democratic platform, and Reagan kicked off
his presidential campaign in Philadelphia.
Miss., site of the murder of three Freedom
Summer civil rights workers. Why do you think
the modern Republican mind is fixated on
Hillary Clinton?
Hillary is about as straight as it gets. She's
the most conservative of all the DennKratic
candidates for president, and was a Republican
in college. But she. like most Americans was —
dare 1 say it? — liberated by the 1 9605, and she
had the nerve to point this out in metaphorical
terms in 1992: "I suppose I could have stayed
home and baked cookies and had teas, but
what I decided to do was to fulfill my profes
sion."
Unforgivably, she let slip that she does not
regret the passing of the pre-Woodstock Amer
ica, of cookies and teas, and male-only work
places and white-only water fountains. And
neither, despite the occasional Republican
vote, do most Americans.
Sure, hippies did some absurd things. But 1
suspect that Trey Parker and Matt Stone of
South Park and "die. hippie, die" fame have no
idea how much they owe to Abbie Hoffman.
Although they are now the butt of easy jokes,
hippies built American modernity, and for that
they deserve our thanks, not our ridicule. And
they did it peacefully.
It's our model of liberation that helped in
spire the oppressed all over the world to tear
down their own prison-states (and they say
Reagan won the Cold War). It may be frighten
ing to the modern GOP that most of America
doesn't yearn for 1957. but it's time to move on.
I hope that, in the next presidential election,
both candidates' favorite songs include some
electric guitar.
