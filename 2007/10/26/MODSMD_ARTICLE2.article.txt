## Heat gets turned up on Card No. 3 women's volleyball faces key tests at UCLA, USC 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball will feel
the heat in Southern California this weekend,
playing a pair of matches in Los Angeles, just
1(K) miles north of the fires raging in San
Diego. Freshman Cassidy Lichtman, from
nearby Poway.had her family evacuated earli
er this week, but they are back home and the
show will go on in Los Angeles.
"We called down to USC and UCLA to
make sure that the matches would be played."
coach John Dunning said. "We had heard that
a lot of high school sports and professional
sports were canceled, mostly because of the
air quality, which is understandable. But they
said we are going to play and we are heading
out and ready to play."
The Cardinal (19-1, 8-1 Pac-10) travels
south to take on No. 7 UCLA (16-4,6-3) and
No. 6 USC (17-3,6-3) Friday and Saturday, re
spectively, as the second half of the conference
season gets underway. Stanford swept both
teams at home four weeks ago in the midst of
its 17-match winning streak.
"They are both very good teams and very
experienced with a pair of great setters,"
Dunning said. "1 think they are as good as
any teams in the country. It is very hard to
play at Washington and they both lost there.
I think they played the toughest schedule in
the first half of the season: at Stanford, at
Washington, at Cal. But they are a couple of
great teams and they should both be great
matches."
It is shaping up to be quite an interesting
week on the national scene after previously
undefeated No. 1 Nebraska was swept by
Texas Wednesday night.
"Texas was very motivated and had 4,(KK)
people at the match, sold it out," Dunning
said. "There are no undefeated teams left in
the country, so this is a sign that it is really
going to be a dogfight at the end of the sea
son."
Stanford is now one of several teams with
the opportunity to take over the top spot in
the poll, which has been held by the Huskers
since the beginning of the season. Standing in
the Cardinal's way. though, are the Bruins
and Trojans, who would surely love to stymie
Stanford's hopes.
Last year. Stanford played the spoiler
against both Los Angeles schools,ending the
undefeated streaks of both teams The C 'ardi
nal will return to IJS( "s Galen Center, which
was inaugurated during Stanford's four
game win last season.
In the Cardinal's home opener in Septem
ber,the team beat the Trojans in three games,
30-21. 30-27. 30-21. Junior middle blocker

high IS kills at a .680. and freshman libcro
Gabi Ailes tallied 18 digs, nearly twice as
many as any other player on the court. C)ffen
sive leader Asia Kaczor had 11 kills to lead
theTVojans.
On the season. Kaczor is by far the top at
tacker for the TVojans with 326 kills and 4.47

per game. Kimmee Roleder is second with
176. Setter Taylor Carico is averaging 12.28
assists per game and Geena Urango leads
the team in digs and service aces.
The Trojans have been at less than full
strength recently as Roleder and senior
Diane Copenhagen have both been side
lined with foot and abdominal injuries, re
spectively.
"All of the teams have people beat up in
different ways," Dunning said. "Hut these
teams have a lot of good players and [even
without the injured players] the level of play
this weekend will be very high."
USC amassed a 6-3 record in the first half
of Pac-10 play, losing to Stanford. UCLA and
No. 4 Washington.

Bruins. Freshman outside hitter Alix Kline

hitting percentage and holds the lead in
blocks. Machado has the most digs, with

Junior defensive specialist Jessica Fish
burn will be back in action this week after
suffering an ankle sprain against Arizona last
week.

day," Dunning said. "She bounced back well
and we have a great trainer, Eitan Gelber,
who has done a good job with everybody this
season and helped get her back healthy
quickly."
