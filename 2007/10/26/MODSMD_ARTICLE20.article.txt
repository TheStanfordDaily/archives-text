## The
						quest for a power animal 
### 
If you're anything like me, you've spent a
lifetime searching for your power animal.
You've spent hours staring into the eyes of
cats, birds and spiders, inquisitively probing for
evidence that this animal is your spiritual
guide. You've watched the National Geo
graphic Channel on slow motion with your
TIVO, looking for obscure tropical animals that
happen to speak to the core of your soul.
Perhaps, like me, you've even attended a
"subconscious painting" telepathic channeling
workshop in the basement of your psychic
stepmother's friend's Ohio apartment, to see if
your power animal would reveal itself in the
corners of your badly painted masterpiece.
(This actually happened...)
But regardless of your past experience with
power animals, 1 believe that right now is the
best time to start, or renew, your quest.
To give you a better idea of what a power
animal is, I turn to www.rainbowcrystal.com,
the end all to be all of power animal Web sites.
This award-winning Web site has been men
tioned on such Internet heavy hitters as pow
eranimals.com and shamanshack.com. Its au
thor, Connie, is a self-proclaimed "double
Sagittarian with Moon in Pisces," who does
"Bach Rower Remedy Counseling" in her
free time.
Connie (who saw two white-tailed deer
dash across the lawn to give their blessings as
she wrote the Web page) defines a power ani
mal as a being capable of delivering messages
from the spiritual plane. It is an animal that
gives energy and guidance, comfort and heal
ing. When combined with power stones and
energy crystals (both available at a low price
through the Web site), the power animal takes
you from danger and leads you to happiness.
The quest for the power animal can take a
whole lifetime, though a single human being
may have many power animals before he or
she dies.
So where do you start? As Connie notes,
the most popular power animal is the cat, fol
lowed closely by the dolphin and the wolf. But

don't limit yourself to these simple examples.
Search for signs of your spiritual connection
with various animals, and see which animals
"speak" to you, either literally or metaphori
cally.
I should mention here that my interest in
this concept was sparked several days ago by
the completion of my personal power animal
quest.

"I implore you,
Zibradun! Show
yourself!" And his
power was once again
with me.

"KA-KAW! KA-KAW!" it mightily sang,
perched atop the sunroof of my room, just be
yond sight, it was 7:32 in the morning, and I
was sound asleep. Yet I gaily awoke, entranced
by its majestic sting.
"Sing, my beloved! Sing!" I cooed. It just so
happened that my alarm had broken that day.
and luckily, its song was my saving grace. My
power animal even had the intelligence to
keep up its singing for the next 10 minutes, a

sure sign that it wanted me to stay awake. And
ever since, 1 have felt the effects of its trance.
That night, at Taekwondo practice, my
teacher called upon the class to make up a
kiep, or power yell, to blurt whenever we did
an especially powerful kick. This noise was
supposed to come from the depths of our sub
conscious. The other members of the class
found their kieps in the form of a "hi-ya!" or a
"raaahh." But mine came out,simply,as"KA
KAW! KA-KAW!" And, emboldened by my
power animal. 1 was able to make my mal
formed kicks slightly less malformed.
The next morning. I awoke again to my
power animal (at exactly 7:32 a.m.). whom by
this point I had chosen to call Zibradun. I
called out to it once more: "I implore you. Zi
bradun! Show yourself!" And his power was
once again with me. At breakfast, my Pop-Tart
broke in a shape that was clearly avian. And,
receiving a call from my grandmother in the
middle of the day, I heard her "Birds of the
World' clock in the background strike its three
oclock chime.
To further channel its energy, 1 have carved
a Zibradun pendant out of gypsum, and as I
write it sways gently on my neck.
I am confident that Zibradun has been
guiding me these last few days, and will contin
ue to do so for some time. No matter the fact
that my computer crashed yesterday, and
found out today that it has lost all of its memo
ry. No matter the fact that 1 broke my watch,
crashed my bike and lost my humbio notes in
these past few days. When it comes down to it.
Zibradun will pull through, soaring through
the sky on wings made of hope and dreams. 1
can only hope that you, dear reader, can find
your very own power animal in the near to im
mediate future. But until that time. Zibradun
and I will watch over you, like a hawk watches
over its children.

If you send an email after 7:32 a.m., Nat will be
wide awake and alert, thanks to Zihradun !v guid
ance. Email him at nat.hillardWstanford.edu.
