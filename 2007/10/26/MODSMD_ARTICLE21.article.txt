The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
hits the road for the first time in over a month
this weekend, going to the desert to take on
Arizona and Arizona State in its third week
end of Pacific-10 Conference plav.
The Cardinal (10-2-2.1-1-1 Pac-10) is com
ing off its toughest weekend of the season thus
far, after losing to No. I UCLA and tying No.
9 USC at home in the previous two games. Ari
zona (6-8-1. 1-2-1 Pac-10) and Arizona State
(9-6, 3-1 Pac-10) each won games last week.
Both the Wildcats and the Sun Devils beat
Oregon State, while Arizona tied and Arizona
State lost to Oregon.
ITie first order of business for Stanford is to
get its offense back on track. Although the
past two games were against two of the best
defenses in the country, the Cardinal's offense
was still disappointed to register only one goal
— a header by senior forward Lizzy George
against USC — in 200 minutes of play.
There are also some issues to be sorted out
on the defensive end. A worrying trend of
careless passing in the back continued last
weekend after rearing its head the week be
fore against N0.21 California, handing scoring
opportunities to the Bruins and the Trojans on
several occasions.
Despite these problems, the Cardinal has

shown resilience after its previous losses and
ties this season. After suffering its first loss of
the season, a 1-0 upset loss to Denver, the
Stanford team returned home and thrashed
San Francisco (3-1) and St. Mary's (4-1). The
Cardinal also followed up its draw against
Santa Clara with an emphatic 4-2 victory over
Cal to open the conference schedule.
Arizona has scored only 19 goals this sea
son, with four each coming from freshman for
ward Jasmin Day and junior strike partner
London King. ITie ball just has not been
bouncing the Wildcats' way. with three Ari
zona players having taken double-digits in
shots this year without finding the back of the
net: freshman Jacqueline Zinke and sopho
mores Jacqueline Broussard and Samantha
Drees.
Danielle Nicolai has played most of the
minutes in goal for the Wildcats. Nicolai is 5-7
with a pair of shutouts and 49 saves on the
year. Still. Nicolai is allowing just under a goal
and a half per game, on average.
Arizona State has been far more successful
at both ends of the field this year. The Sun
Devils also have a pair of forwards with four
goals apiece — freshman Karin Volpe and
senior Courtney Crane — at the top of the stat
sheet, but nine other players on the roster
have goals, including all but one of the usual
outfield starters. Junior defender Kylla Sjo
man, the team leader in assists with six, gets

the offense started out of the back.
Sophomore goalkeeper Briana Silvestri
has been a constant presence in front of the
Arizona State goal, missing only a half-hour of
play in the entire season. Silvestri has surren

dered only nine goals for a 0.61 goals-against
average, and has shut out the Sun Devils' op
ponents five times.

Fifth-year senior midfielder Shari Summers leads the Cardinal in goals on the year with five, and
will look to add to that total this weekend on the road against Arizona and Arizona State.
