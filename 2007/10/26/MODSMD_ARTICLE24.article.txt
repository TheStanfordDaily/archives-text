## Underdogs to rule the weekend 
### 
I love underdogs. It is such a great
feeling to watch the team that was
n't supposed to win, the team that
no one thought could hang with their
opposition — the undermanned and
outmatched bunch — pull out a victo
ry.
1 also like pressure. When a streak is
on the line or when a team needs to
pull out a season-defining victory, the
athletes who can handle the pressure
best are invariably the ones that will
come out on top. We have seen it all at
Stanford this year as well as through
out the college sports world.
Welcome to another weekend in
college sports, where the underdog
prevails, pressure runs high, and histo
ry is in the making.
With that said, on to my predic
tions of the winners and losers for this
weekend in college sports.
Winner: Stanford Women's Cross
Country
Going for an unprecedented 12th
straight Pac-10 title, the Stanford
women's cross country team should
get number 12 this weekend at the
Pac-10 championships, hosted by
Oregon State.
The Cardinal women are currently
the No. 1 team in the nation and
should have no problem defeating
their Pac-10 foes. Led by returning
All-Americans Arianna Lambie,
Teresa McWalters, Lauren Cen
trowitz and Lindsay Flacks, the Stan
ford women placed two in the top
three at the Pre-NCAA Invitational
two weeks ago, with McWalters and
Lambie finishing just one second
apart. It seems that it's all tune-ups for
these ladies until the NCAA Champi
onships in the middle of November.
Loser: Los Angeles
No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball is
19-1 overall and 8-1 in conference
play. TTiis weekend, they head south
for two huge matches against No. 7
UCLA and No. 6 USC. In their first
meetings, Stanford swept both teams
at Maples Pavilion in convincing fash
ion. These matches are away, which
will make them much tougher. Stan
ford must win two to keep pace with
Washington, who handed them their
only loss of the season and also sits at
8-1 in the Pac-10. The Cardinal will
come ready to play against the Los
Angeles schools and should repro
duce the same results as last time. But
the wins won't come as easy as they
did before.
Winner: Penn State
It's the year of the upset in college
football, and the trend should contin
ue on Saturday. Ohio State is unde
feated and ranked No. 1, and is play
ing at Penn State (6-2). The Nittany
Lions' "whiteout" crowd — with the
entire Beaver Stadium dressed in
bright white — will be too much for
the Buckeyes. Ohio State has not
been tested at all this year, and Joe Pa
terno's squad is a very good team with
a very good defense. Penn State has
already played a tough conference
road game (a loss at Michigan), and
now it's Ohio State's turn. The Lions'
defense will limit Ohio State's offense
and the game will be a battle of field
position. In the end, Penn State
should prevail in a close one, knock
ing off yet another unbeaten.
Loser: USC
After last week's 38-0 thrashing of
Notre Dame, the Trojans seem to be
back on track following their stunning
loss to Stanford. But it couldn't be a
worse time for the TVojans to meet the
Oregon Ducks, who rushed for a
school-record 465 yards last week
against Washington, en route to rack
ing up 661 total yards. Mark Sanchez
looks to be the starter for the Trojans,
and USC is slowly starting to get back
some of its injured players. But
Autzen Stadium will be out of control,
and the duo of Dennis Dixon at OB
and Jonathan Stewart at tailback is
one of the most explosive in the coun
try. This could turn into a scoring con
test, as Oregon does not have a strong
defense (the Cardinal racked up 31
points against the Ducks, and Wash
ington managed 35). But Oregon will
get up for this game and will end up
being too much for USC. Aren't we
used to saying the opposite?
Winner: Stanford Football
Popular consensus has the Cardi
nal losing Saturday's game handily to
the Beavers. However, coach Har
baugh has this team on the right track
after two straight conference road
wins.llle Cardinal will he depleted at
running hack again, and Oregon
State does have the leading rush de
fense in the Pac-10 (63 yards per
game). The Beavers also lead the
Pac-10 in sacks per game (4.1). But
the Cardinal offensive line has been
playing well of late, and Harbaugh
should look to utilize Pritchard's
ability to roll out of the pocket while
using quick passes and screens to ex
ploit a shaky Beavers secondary. His
game will be closer than expected as
long as the Cardinal can contain
OSU's Yvenson Bernard, who is on
his way to becoming one of the Pac
10's all-time leading rushers. So the
turnaround season for the Cardinal
will keep rolling this weekend, as the
Cardinal takes down the Beavers in
another nail-biter.
