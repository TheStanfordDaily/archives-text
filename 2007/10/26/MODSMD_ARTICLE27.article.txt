## Inter-faith Journal shares religious thought 
### ERIC MESSINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The push toward inter-faith dialogue on cam
pus is set to reach new heights this quarter with
the publication of the inaugural issue of En
counter: Stanford's Inter-faith Journal for Spiri
tual Expression.
Co-founders Alex Martin 09 and Michael
Petrin 09 hope to launch the student-run publi
cation in December. Independent of the Office
of Religious Life (ORL), the journal aims both
to increase communication among faiths and to
increase student participation in religious life
and conversation on campus.
"We want to move spirituality into the day
light," Petrin said." We want to take it from some
thing hidden to something that's out there."
Through "anything from poetry to personal
reflections to photography to critical commen
tary to short stories," students will make the pub
lication their own. the founders said.
"There are people who aren't comfortable
with the ORL, or institutionalized religion in
general," Petrin said. "We're aware of that, and
we don't want that tentativeness. Let's get
them in."

Though both Martin and Petrin are Chris
tians, they felt their efforts were better suited to
the interests of the extended religious communi
ty on campus.
"Some students from Harvard came here and
tried to get me interested in founding a Christian
journal," Martin said."! explained that I person
ally felt called more to what we're doing now. We
want a diversity of contributions and a diversity
of readership."
Petrin emphasized, however, that he and
Martin "don't want advertisements for specific
faiths." Instead,he said the magazine will encour
age open sharing and expression of religious
ideas.
"We have this big church in the middle of the
Ouad. and there are a lot of Christians," Petrin
said. "When you're Baha'i, or Buddhist or Sikh,
this can be intimidating, and that raises tensions.
We're trying to get this to be a journal that in
cludes them [and) includes diverse views."
The Office for Religious Life, while not in
volved in the publication, supports the students'
initiative.
"We're thrilled that this is generated by stu
dents. and not a University program," said Rev.
Joanne Sanders, associate dean for religious life.

"Their energy will give it greater impact, and we
have a mutual interest in promoting these kinds
of conversations on campus."
The founders said they have shared the idea
with numerous religious groups, and many stu
dents have given positive feedback.
"This is something that could start up a con
versation " said Ricky Villarreal '09, who is active
in Catholic life on campus. "Religion often gets
overlooked as part of the variety and diversity on
campus."
Zaid Adhami '10, a member of the Muslim
Student Awareness Network, agreed that the
journal could bring together a variety of religious
traditions.
"It's recognizing the common element," he
said. "Hopefully it will build bridges between
communities."
Submissions are due Nov. 28, and the staff
hopes to release an issue by the end of the quar
ter. According to Petrin, however, the end goal
lies beyond a number of printed copies.
"We want to hear that the conversations have
left the paper," he said.
