## Legal counseling office expands services Students now able to seek legal advice for cases against Univ. 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Two weeks ago, after a push by ASSU Vice
President Mondaire Jones '09. the Legal Counsel
ing Office (LCO) changed its guidelines to allow
for counseling of students whose cases involve dis
putes with the University. Previously, students pur
suing legal action against Stanford were denied
help by the LCO.
Founded in l l )73 by Stanford students, the LCO
is funded by the ASSU and is free for students to
use as a source of legal advice, though the attor
neys involved do not actually represent students in
court.
As chairman of the LCO policy board. Jones
said he first became aware that students were de
nied legal counsel in cases involving Stanford dur
ing winter quarter of last year.
"1 had noticed in the quarterly report that two
individuals had been turned away in the previous
quarter," he said. "1 inquired as to why they were
denied counseling, and that's when 1 first found
out that these policies were in place."
Jones said that the policy guidelines were not in

line with student needs.
"It seemed ironic for students to be paying for
this service and not receive something very basic,
in my mind at least, in return." he said. "I felt that
the University was overstepping its boundaries in
posing such restrictions."
To change this. Jones asked the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council last spring
to pass a resolution urging the LCO Policy Board
to amend its guidelines.
"I knew that the legislative bodies couldn't
change the LCO policy guidelines because they
lacked the constitutional authority to do so." Jones
said. "Only the LCO Policy Board can amend the
LCO policy guidelines, according to the Joint As
sociation Legislative Bylaws."
Following the resolution, Jones also proposed
an amendment to the bylaws to increase student
representation on the Policy Board.
"The ASSU was very fortunate to have control
of the Composition Board." he said. "We feel that
the majority vote for the Policy Board should be
students that are paying for these services."
At their first quarterly meeting two Thursdays
ago. the Policy Board amended the guidelines.
"The University is aware of this development
and we are waiting to hear from the lawyer repre
senting the ASSU to discuss it," Stanford General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt said in a statement to
ITie Daily. "We look forward to talking to ASSU

representatives and learning more about what
they plan to do."
However, Jones said that the managing attor
ney of the LCO. William Faulkner, did communi
cate changes to the Office of the General Counsel
and has not yet received a response. Faulkner did
not respond to contact from The Daily.
"This was not done under the table or without
the knowledge of the University," Jones said.
"There was a University administrator from the
Law School present at the meeting."
Despite the recent policy change, Jones said
that he did not believe there would be more cases
brought to the LCO against the University.
" ITie amendment in the policy guidelines still
mandates that the counseling office encourage
students to pursue existing protocol that the Uni
versity has in place for resolving disputes." he
said.
Jones hopes students will hear about the
changes and use the service if it is needed.
"It is important that students are made aware,
otherwise the policy change won't have the in
tended effect for providing students with counsel
ing resources," he said.
The changes to LCO policy are effective imme
diately.
