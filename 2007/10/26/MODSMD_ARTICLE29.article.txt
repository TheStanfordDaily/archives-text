## House passes health bill again Democrats push for children's health, unlikely to override veto 
### DAVID ESPO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a deepening conflict
with the White House, Democrats pushed a revised
children's health bill through the House on Thursday
but lacked the votes to overcome a threatened second
straight veto by President Bush.
The vote was 265-142 on a bill so politically charged
that one Republican bluntly accused Democrats of tim
ing the events to dovetail with attack ads planned by or
ganizations supporting the legislation.
"They won't take yes for an answer," retorted Rep.
Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, as Democrats vehemently
denied the charge. He said the legislation included
changes demanded by GOP critics of the earlier vetoed
bill, including one to prevent illegal immigrants from
gaining benefits.
The measure now goes to the Senate.
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.. the majority leader, told
reporters additional changes are possible before it
heads to the White House. At the same time, he added,
"I don't want to be strung along" by Republicans mere

ly feigning an interest in bipartisan compromise.
Ilie legislation is designed chiefly to provide cover
age for children whose families make too much money
to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to purchase pri
vate insurance.
In general.supporters said it would extend coverage
to children of families making up to 300 percent of the
federal poverty level, or about $62,000 for a family of
four.
At that level, congressional officials said, it would
cover about 4 million children who now go without,
raising the total for the program overall to 10 million
kids.The $35 billion cost over five years would be cov
ered by an increase in the tobacco tax of 61 cents a pack.
The vote unfolded one week after the House failed
to override Bush's earlier veto, and indicated that the
changes Democrats had made failed to attract much, if
any, additional support.
The 265 votes cast for the measure was seven shy of
the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. In
addition, 14 Republicans who voted to sustain Bush's
original veto were absent.
Public opinion polls show widespread support for
the issue, and the political subtext was never far from
the surface in the debate.
The children's health measure has emerged as one
of the most contentious issues of the year, temporarily
supplanting last winter and spring's fierce debate over
the Iraq war.
