# Can't Fight The Moonlight
## 
### ANDREW VALENCIA 
y— <» tudents from all over campus de-
L * scended on the Quad last night to
celebrate the annual Full Moon
. jon the Quad. Whether out of re-
for tradition, exhibitionist
fantasy or simple curiosity, throngs of
people came to celebrate what has be
come a prime event in many students'
time spent at Stanford.
As in years past.the evenings festivi
ties drew a broad range of students, some
of whom participated in the free-spirited
making out that has become synony
mous with the event, as well as others
who chose to socialize and observe.
"I'm curious as to what's actually
going to happen, and I want to experi
ence it because I'm a freshman," said
Karla Martinez'll.
The University tried to accommodate
both participants and observers. A "safe
area" was set up in front of Memorial
Church for those who were not interest
ed in kissing, while Peer Health Educa
tors (PHEs) supplied mouthwash for

those who were.
"We really just want to encourage
positive health and positive decision
making," said PHE Mike Woodward
*08, who worked the mouthwash
booth at the event. "We want to en
courage our residents to make good
decisions."
Like last year, several live bands
provided entertainment for the
event, lending it a concert-like feel.
Performance groups included Am
persand. Pochama and Jidenna,
whose members included Stanford
undergradegrad students,alumni and
a few who had no affiliation with the
University at all.
Security for the event was provid
ed through a collaboration between
the Stanford Police and Sheriff's De
partments as well as Campus Securi
ty. Iliough the event was designated
to be alcohol-free and officers kept
watch to spot drinking as it occurred,
some students came to the event al
ready intoxicated and others still
managed to sneak alcohol past offi
cials.
To help with safety and security,
the group Stanford United for Elimi
nating Rape (SURE) set up a booth
by the gate to provide its free 5-
SURF safety escort to those who felt
either uncomfortable or unable to
make it back to their residence on
their own.
"All of our drivers are trained to
deal with both people who are drunk
and single riders who request rides,"
said SURE co-manager Andrea
Romero "09. "We're working to keep
all Stanford students safe."
The event's prominence as a fix
ture of Stanford life was a draw for
many students.
"Honestly, I find the tradition to
be the only reason I'm going," said
Omar Smith'll."Otherwise, I would
n't really be interested in such public
eroticism. I actually think it's kind of
weird that so many people like that
kind of public display."
Hut the public display factor clear
ly motivated other students, as evi
denced by the number of either part
ly or completely nude participants,
covered in decorative body paint. At
Columbae. one of the co-ops which
regularly uses the event as an outlet
for being creative with their nudity,
residents and their friends held a
group body-painting party prior to
the night's festivities.
"I've kind of been looking forward
to it because we don't really get to run
around naked usually," said Marie-Jo
Mont-Reynaud. a resident of the En
chanted Broccoli Forest (EBF) who

came to Columbae to he painted.
"EBF isn't quite as naked as the other
co-ops."
While most students use Full
Moon on the Quad primarily as an ex
cuse to cut loose and have fun, some
say there is a possibility for long-term
relationships to develop.
Sheppard Peng 08 said that while
tradition was the main reason he at
tended the event, "there's always a
chance that you might meet that spe
cial someone."
While Full Moon on the Quad
generally brings together students
from all over campus, some were
not permitted to attend. Members
of the Stanford football team, for
example, were told not to go due to
the risk of catching colds, flus and
other illnesses.
"I wasn't really going to partici
pate. but I was going to check out the
band," said football player Thomas
Reiser "11. "It makes sense, but I
know some dudes were disappoint
ed."
