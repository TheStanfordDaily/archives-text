## Hobbled Card backfield faces uphill battle at OSU 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
T\vo seasons ago, Stanford and Oregon State locked
horns in the Northwest rain in a classic low-scoring grid
iron battle with both teams' bowl hopes on the line.
This year it seems that the more things change, the
more they stay the same. Stanford (3-4,2-3 Pac 10) trav
els to Oregon State (4-3,2-2 Pac-10) for the afternoon
game that could turn either team's season around.
The Cardinal is looking for its first back-to-back wins
since a three-game win streak over Washington State,
Arizona and Arizona State in 2005. Oregon State, mean
while, has won two in a row and has not played since up
setting then-No. 2 ranked California 31-28 in Berkeley
two weeks ago.
A win would put the Cardinal two wins from bowl el
igibility and give the team a possible tie-breaking advan
tage over the Beavers.To get that win, Stanford will have
to contend with a wicked running attack, a defense that
has sacked opposing quarterbacks 28 times and the best
placekicker in the conference.
Oregon State's weakness is holding on to the football
â€” the Beavers arc last in the conference in turnover
margin and have given the ball away 24 times, more than
twice the number of conference-leading California (11).
Quarterback Sean Canfield has thrown 13 interceptions
and only seven touchdowns.
Ihe Cardinal defense's first task will be stopping
Yvenson Bernard, who is ranked third in the Pac-10 in
rushing. The talented senior has run for 752 yards on 175
carries in seven games, and his powerful straight-ahead
style will test Stanford's injury-riddled defensive unit.
Bernard has inherited the mantle of great Oregon State
running backs, following the likes of Ken Simonton
(1998-2001) and Steven Jackson (2001-2003).
With two fourth-quarter comeback wins in three
starts, redshirt sophomore Tavita Pritchard remains the
starter at quarterback for the Cardinal. Pritchard posted
his best numbers of the season last weekend,completing
19 of 27 passes for 181 yards, with one touchdown and
two interceptions.
Who he will hand the ball to remains in doubt as, for
the second straight week, Stanford travels with a serious-

Stanford freshman tailback Jeremy Stewart plunges in from the 1 -yard line for the decisive score in last weekend's 21 -20 Stanford
victory over the Wildcats. Stewart is just one of four Cardinal runners expected to be limited to some degree by injury.
