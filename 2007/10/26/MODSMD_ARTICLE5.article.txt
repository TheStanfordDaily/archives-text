room as he and his fellow seniors experienced the relief of knowing that
their last season on the Farm would not be a winless one.
He then looked beyond his time on the Farm, and turned his thoughts
to a young safety he had mentored for most of two years. Bo McNally.
who had returned an interception for a score in the third quarter to put
the Cardinal up 10-7 following the extra point. It was perhaps the first
game-changing play of McNally's collegiate career, hut Harrison was
confident it wouldn't be his last — and he was right.
"I feel like Bo's one of my kids running around out there," Harrison
said on the TUesday after Stanford's win over the Huskies. "He's got a
chance to be a big-time player right away. I try as much as I can to be a
mentor and try to help him with those little ins and outs and things you
can't really get without the experience of playing, so to see him throw
everything to the wind and make those plays is a great feeling."

NOTES: The Cardinal will get another shot at their
first winning streak since the 2005 season as it

the matchups would appear to favor the Beavers,
who boast the conference's top run defense which
will square off against a Stanford backfield riddled
by injuries. The Cardinal, meanwhile, will face the
unenviable tosk of stopping the Beavers' stellar
senior at tailback, Yvenson Bernard.
