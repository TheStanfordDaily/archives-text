## Football Safety taking center stage

-JL. son. He discussed the emotional scene in the Stanford locker
room as he and his fellow seniors experienced the relief of knowing that
their last season on the Farm would not be a winless one.
He then looked beyond his time on the Farm, and turned his thoughts
to a young safety he had mentored for most of two years. Bo McNally.
who had returned an interception for a score in the third quarter to put
the Cardinal up 10-7 following the extra point. It was perhaps the first
game-changing play of McNally's collegiate career, hut Harrison was
confident it wouldn't be his last — and he was right.
"I feel like Bo's one of my kids running around out there," Harrison
said on the TUesday after Stanford's win over the Huskies. "He's got a
chance to be a big-time player right away. I try as much as I can to be a
mentor and try to help him with those little ins and outs and things you
can't really get without the experience of playing, so to see him throw
everything to the wind and make those plays is a great feeling."
As a redshirt sophomore, McNally has developed into a true play
maker for the Cardinal this year. And he's not taking a single moment on
the field for granted.
"I just love the speed and the contact." McNally said. "There's no
other game like football. There's so many different team aspects in
volved and it's just fun to sec it all come together on Saturday. There's
nothing better."
McNally has been a statistical stalwart for Stanford this season, lead
ing the Cardinal by a wide margin in tackles; his two interceptions are
tied for the team lead. In some defenses,safeties making a lot of stops de

NOTES: The Cardinal will get another shot at their
first winning streak since the 2005 season as it
takes on Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore. Most of
the matchups would appear to favor the Beavers,
who boast the conference's top run defense which
will square off against a Stanford backfield riddled
by injuries. The Cardinal, meanwhile, will face the
unenviable tosk of stopping the Beavers' stellar
senior at tailback, Yvenson Bernard.
responsibilities. However, McNally explained that in
Stanford's new scheme, as far as his play is con
cerned, what you see is what you get.
"People don't really understand that in our de
fense, (first year defensive coordinator Scott)
Shafer's philosophy is the safeties are like extra line
hackers. So once we read run, we're flying up the
tield 100 percent going to get the run. So if the safe
ty has eight, nine, or 10 tackles a game that's a good
thing. It's an attack mentality defense so as safeties
we attack the run."
And attack the run McNally has. His 70 stops on
the ground are 19 more than the number his nearest
competition, redshirt sophomore linebacker Clinton
Snyder, has amassed for the season. Still. McNally
sees plenty of room for improvement despite his re
markable season thus far.
"I've had a few missed tackles each game, so you
know I'm leading the team but I could still have that
many more tackles if I had a little better footwork
here or there and got my eyes right in a couple of sit
uations," he said.
Nevertheless, the sophomore has also played key
roles in goal-line stands against Arizona and USC. In
the Cardinal's signature win over Southern Califor
nia. he teamed up with senior cornerback Nick
Sanchez to hold Trojan running back Chauncey
Washington out of the end zone on fourth-and-goal
at the one yard-line in the waning seconds of the first
half. McNally later helped seal the win at the Colise
um for the Cardinal with his game-clinching inter
ception of John David Booty in the fourth quarter.
Coupled with a forced fumble, four tackles for
loss, a sack and five passes defended, it is fair to say
that McNally has been making plays all over the field
for the Cardinal. And with so many young faces like
McNally's starting to make their presence felt,
there's plenty of reason for optimism moving for
ward.
"We talked about this in practice the other
day...we're still playing for this season but the foun
dation has been set for a really great thing by the sen
iors this year," McNally said. "They've set a really
good example for the freshmen...we've got a good
start to where we can really get this program going
and get a lot of good things done in the next few
years.
"I guess 'enthusiastic' is the best word to describe
how it's changed." he added. "Coach Shafer, his phi
losophy is you play with great attitude, great effort
and great enthusiasm and good things will happen."

competition, redshirt sophomore linebacker Clinton
Snyder, has amassed for the season. Still. McNally
sees plenty of room for improvement despite his re
markable season thus far.
"I've had a few missed tackles each game, so you
know I'm leading the team but I could still have that
many more tackles if I had a little better footwork
here or there and got my eyes right in a couple of sit
uations," he said.
Nevertheless, the sophomore has also played key
roles in goal-line stands against Arizona and USC. In
the Cardinal's signature win over Southern Califor
nia. he teamed up with senior cornerback Nick
Sanchez to hold Trojan running back Chauncey
Washington out of the end zone on fourth-and-goal
at the one yard-line in the waning seconds of the first
half. McNally later helped seal the win at the Colise
um for the Cardinal with his game-clinching inter
ception of John David Booty in the fourth quarter.
Coupled with a forced fumble, four tackles for
loss, a sack and five passes defended, it is fair to say
that McNally has been making plays all over the field
for the Cardinal. And with so many young faces like
McNally's starting to make their presence felt,
there's plenty of reason for optimism moving for
ward.
"We talked about this in practice the other
day...we're still playing for this season but the foun
dation has been set for a really great thing by the sen
iors this year," McNally said. "They've set a really
good example for the freshmen...we've got a good
start to where we can really get this program going
and get a lot of good things done in the next few
years.
"I guess 'enthusiastic' is the best word to describe
how it's changed." he added. "Coach Shafer, his phi
losophy is you play with great attitude, great effort
and great enthusiasm and good things will happen."
So far for the 2007 Cardinal, they have.
