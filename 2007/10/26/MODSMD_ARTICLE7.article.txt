## STUDENT GROUPS "Junior" on track for Urban race Racing team's robotic car enters qualifying round today 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
I he Stanford Racing Team and its robotic car
"Junior" begin competition today at the Nation
al Qualifying I-vent for the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Urban
Challenge.
Currently at the former George Air Force
Base in Victorville, Calif., the Stanford team
hopes to advance from the National Qualifying
Event this last week of October to the Urban
Challenge race on Nov. 3.
At the center of their work is Junior, a 2(X)6
autonomous Passat wagon whose steering,
throttle and brakes have all been modified to be
completely computer controllable. Engineered
at the Volkswagen of America Electronics Re
search Laboratory in Palo Alto. Junior is being
accompanied by a replacement car on the team's
trek.
The upcoming Urban Challenge is more
complex than previous robotic car races. The
team's previous car, "Stanley," simply had to
avoid hitting still objects and stay on the road â€”
for which it won the 2(K)5 DARPA Grand Chal
lenge.
Ibis year, however. Junior will have to be
aware of fast-moving objects all around it. navi
gating through mock city environments that in
clude busy intersections, traffic circles and other
obstacles.
To tackle the challenge. Junior comes
equipped with a range-finding laser array that
spins to provide a 360-degree, three-dimension
al view of the surrounding environment in near
real-time. The laser array is accompanied by a

device with six video cameras to cover all of the
car's surroundings.
Junior also uses bumper-mounted lasers,
radar. Global Positioning System receivers and
inertial navigation hardware to collect data
about where it is and what is around it. Junior's
"brain" is composed of chips that have multiple
processing units, making it approximately four

times more powerful than Stanley's "brain."
"Junior collects much more data than Stan
ley did: its computational hardware must be
commensurately more powerful," said Mike
Montenierlo, a senior research engineer in the
Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
Ihe upcoming challenge is an outgrowth of
two previous DARPA Grand Challenge au

tonomous vehicle competitions.The first Grand
Challenge event was held in March 2004 and fea
tured a 142-mile desert course. Fifteen vehicles
attempted the course and not a single vehicle fin
ished.
In the 2005 Grand Challenge,several vehicles
