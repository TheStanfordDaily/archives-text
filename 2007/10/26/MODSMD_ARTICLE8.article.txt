# Solar car blows tire and flips at World Solar Challenge
## Stanford Solar Car Project loses new car in Australia 
### AYSHA BAGCHI 
Stanford's race for victory in the World
Solar Challenge came to an abrupt end yester
day afternoon in Australia after the team's car
blew a tire, spun out of control and flipped
over. Driver Eric Ellenoff'o9 was uninjured.
After two years of hard work, the Stanford
Solar Car Project finally unveiled its newest
solar-powered car, "Equinox," at the World
Solar Challenge.a cross-continent race in Aus
tralia featuring solar-powered cars from

around the world.
I lie 3,000-kilometer race began on Oct. 21
in Darwin, on Australia's northern coast, and
will end later this week in Adelaide, on the
southern coast of the island continent. Ten
members of the Stanford Solar Car Project
traveled to Australia for the week-long race.
The entirely student-run group had built
the new car with the same body style as its pre
vious car, "Solstice." but "Equinox" operated
with a better solar array (used to convert light
from the sun into electricity) and upgraded
electrical and mechanical systems.
"It was definitely a new and improved car,"
said Sasha Zbrozek 10. a member of the Stan
ford Solar Car Project.
The team had a stronu start to the race and

had reached as high as third place in the "Ad
venture Class." the lower division of the World
Solar Challenge. However, the car began to
fall behind the head of the pack in the middle
of the race and became unstable. With the car
moving at about 50 miles per hour, a tire ex
ploded, causing the vehicle to spin out of con
trol and flip over. It landed about 30 feet from
the side of the road.
"I rolled the car," Ellenoff told Zbrozek in
a voice message immediately following the
crash. "Something went wrong...the car is now
lying 10 meters off the side of the road, cov
ered in dirt."
Ellenoff was unavailable for further com
ment. Luckily, the car's roll cage (designed to
protect a driver in the case of an accident) prc

vented him from being crushed by the impact.
Hie team picked up the wreckage and put
it in a trailer headed to Adelaide, where they
will ship it back to Stanford and recover as
many parts as possible.
Among the ruined pieces of the car is its
solar array, which alone will cost $150,000 to
replace.
"The team will be done for at least a year,"
Zbrozek said. "We will refurbish our old car to
take to community events."
Though the Stanford Solar Car Project
generally competes in the lower division of
races, it is set to compete in the upper division
races in both the 2009 World Solar Challenge
and the 2010 North American Chal
lenge. To he competitive in these
races, Zhrozek estimated that the
team will need three times as many
members and twice as much fund
ing.
"We're looking for new mem
bers, and could use managers and
fundraisers," he said.
