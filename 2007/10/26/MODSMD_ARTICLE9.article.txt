For students looking to expand
their alcoholic horizons beyond beer
or shots of hard liquor. Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises (SSE) will offer an
introductory bartending class, called
"The Art of the Sip" beginning to
morrow.
Each year, numerous freshmen get
their first taste of alcohol, but even by

many don't even know how to pre

they usually don't know how to mix

"We expect all participants to

With sign-ups open for the course,
many students are already showing
interest.
"It takes away the connotation of
the commodity to simply get drunk,"
Laura Chau '11 said. "It takes it to a
level of enjoyment."
Fornaeus also believes the class of

who encounter alcohol.
"I think it's an interesting course
