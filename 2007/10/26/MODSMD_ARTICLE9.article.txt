## Students learn how to bartend Drink-mixing class starts tomorrow 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For students looking to expand
their alcoholic horizons beyond beer
or shots of hard liquor. Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises (SSE) will offer an
introductory bartending class, called
"The Art of the Sip" beginning to
morrow.
Each year, numerous freshmen get
their first taste of alcohol, but even by
the end of their Stanford careers,
many don't even know how to pre
pare a proper mixed drink.
"1 usually see students either hav
ing shots or carrying out strange-look -
ing brown concoctions, a mixture of
everything they could find because
they usually don't know how to mix
drinks," said Eva Fornaeus '11.
San Francisco bartender Polly
Martini will instruct students in basic
bartending every Saturday for the
next three weeks. SSE Development
developed the idea from similar
courses at peer universities.
"It's not a comprehensive bar
tending education, but it's a great way
to learn about proper mixing/safety
techniques," said Adam Chadroff '10.
SSE public relations manager.? Con
sumption of alcohol will not be al
lowed, so the course is open to all
members of the Stanford community,
including those under 21.
"Mixing is done with colored
water, and the mixing techniques are
simulated very well, but there is no al
cohol safety issue at the course,"
Chadroff said.
In order to address underage
drinking concerns. Martini's instruc
tion will include alcohol safety and
discussion of blood alcohol content
levels, the law and how to take care of
intoxicated people.
"We expect all participants to
learn how to be safe with alcohol, now
or in the future," Chadroff added.
With sign-ups open for the course,
many students are already showing
interest.
"It takes away the connotation of
the commodity to simply get drunk,"
Laura Chau '11 said. "It takes it to a
level of enjoyment."
Fornaeus also believes the class of
fers practical knowledge for those
who encounter alcohol.
"I think it's an interesting course
because it's not something that you
would normally learn in an academic
environment, and it teaches you use
ful skills," she said.
Chadroff said that SSE is very sat
isfied with the reaction to the class so
far. The Nov. 3 session is nearly sold
out. While the course does not actual
ly certify participants to be qualified
bartenders, it does register them to
take an online course for the Califor
nia State Responsible Server Certifi
cation.
"This should help aspiring bar
tenders to get a job opportunity,"
Chadroff said, adding that Martini is
interested in hiring a few of the most

talented students for local bartending
jobs.
All students of the class will also
receive bartending supplies including
a shaker, strainer and bartending
book. The one-day course is three
hours long and costs $125 per person
or $1(K) each if a group of five people
sign up together. Profits from the
course go to the ASSU.
"This is a class about maturity, re
sponsibility and sophistication,"
Chadroff said. "We think of the class
as a really fun way to learn bartend
ing basics."
