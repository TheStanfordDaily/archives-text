## Red Sox sweep to second World Series title in four years, beating Rockies 4-3 
### BEN WALKER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DENVER (AF) â€” There's a
new monster in baseball, and this
one's in Boston, too.
Overwhelming in every way, the
Red Sox swept to their second title in
four years Sunday night. Jon Lester,
Mike Lowell & Co. left little room
for drama with a 4-3 win over the
Colorado Rockies in Game 4.
This was hardly a repeat from
2004, when the Red Sox ended their
86-year championship drought by
beating St. Louis. Boston is a major
league bully these days, playing in

rarefied air before crowds who de
mand to win.
"It doesn't get old," manager
Terry Francona said.
After trailing Cleveland 3-1 in the
AL championship series, the Red
Sox won seven straight games and
won their seventh World Series
crown.
The wild-card Rockies, who won a
remarkable 21 of 22 games to get this
far, were a mere afterthought by the
end. Brad Hawpe homered in the
seventh inning and Garrett Atkins
hit a two-run shot in the eighth that
came too late.
"At the end of the day, you look
back on the game. How did you exe
cute?" Rockies manager Clint Hur
dle said. "They executed better than
us all four games."
Lester, undergoing chemother
apy at this time last year for can
cer, pitched shutout ball into the

sixth inning and Jonathan Papel
bon closed with his third save of
the Series.
Lowell won the MVP award,
though Boston had plenty of candi
dates.
"It took all 25 of us to get the job
done," Papelbon said. "It's just phe
nomenal."
Lowell led a team that hit .333 in
the Series with a home run, double
and headfirst slide to score a run
Sunday. He also won a ring in 2003
with underdog Florida.
"A little different," he said. "I
think with the Marlins no one ex
pected us to do this and I think with

the Red Sox people expect you to
win and I think both are very satis
fying."
Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury got it
started with a leadoff double and,
even without big contributions from
sluggers Manny Ramirez and David
Ortiz, Boston was too good. Bobby
Kielty made the most of his first ap
pearance in this Series, connecting
for a pinch-hit home run in the
eighth.
"This team s got a lot of heart,"
Varitek said. "We worked really
hard. We just beat a very, very good
team, an excellent team. We had to
do the little things."
