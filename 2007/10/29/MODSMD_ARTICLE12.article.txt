## D.C. program celebrates 20th 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
A Supreme Court justice, three
University presidents and hundreds
of alumni descended on the nation's
capital Saturday to celebrate the
20th anniversary of the Bing Stan
ford in Washington program. The
quarter-long program takes students
out of the bubble and into the belt
way through seminars taught by D.C.
insiders and a rigorous full-time in
ternship.
White chocolate replicas of the
U.S. Capitol building and palm trees
invoking the University's majestic
entrance adorned the Ronald Rea
gan Building and International
Trade Center, as University officials
and alumni honored 20 years of stu
dents working at some of the nation's
most prestigious and influential
agencies, including Congress, the De
partment of State and the White
House.
"It has become the most well-re
spected residential program in Wash
ington of any university," Stanford
President John Hennessy told a
crowd of about 500 gathered at the
gala.
During the celebratory weekend,
alumni and supporters of the pro
gram participated in seminars exam
ining political polarization and the
press with policy experts in Washing
ton. Stanford faculty and alumni led
field trips to local sites, and partici
pants attended a conversation ses
sion between former University
President Gerhard Casper and
Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer's9.
The occasion also marked the for
mal opening of an expanded Stan
ford in Washington (SIW) center,
which builds upon the existing space
by adding a library, an art gallery and
a high-tech distance learning center
to connect speakers, courses and
conferences with Stanford's main
campus.
For many, the most endearing as
pect of the celebration was the

strength of its alumni network and
the continued cultivation of a true
SIW community.
"Unlike any other university cen
ters in Washington, we are not a se
ries of apartments." said Adrienne
Jamieson, the director of the SIW
program. "We try to do things to
gether and create a sense of commu
nity that is a bit different from what
you would see elsewhere."
Jamieson attributed the broader
range of experiences that Stanford
students receive to the support of
Helen and Peter Bing '55, who en
dowed the program and provide
funding for students to embark on a
variety of cultural activities within
Washington and the surrounding his
torical area.
Their generosity, Jamieson said,
has made possible trips to the Get
tysburg battlefield, outings to theater
performances and evenings at the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Per
forming Arts, where many students
sample their first taste of opera.
"They assisted in making Wash
ington something more than just a
place to do an internship and take
some classes," Jamieson said. "They
made it a place that also provides an
other aspect of education through
these field trips and cultural experi
ences."
Students benefit from access to a
variety of policymakers who often
stop by the Stanford house for lec
tures and discussions. Senior Wash
ington Post reporter Walter Pincus
has a class on oversight and the press,
in which students regularly meet
with such guests as Justice Breyer,
New Yorker writer Seymour Hersh
and Senator Susan Collins (R-
Maine). Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice has stopped by the
house for a brief visit on occasion.
The program has benefited equal
ly from the students' own curiosity
and innovation. While on a tour of
the West Wing of the White House,
SIW students crossed paths with
then-Vice President A 1 Gore, who
engaged them for nearly an hour of

discussions about politics and policy.
A brief spotting of General T.
Michael Moseley, chief of staff of the
Air Force, led to an invitation for
lunch at the Pentagon.
"My experience in the program
was exceptional and by far one of the
best quarters 1 had at Stanford," said
Andrew Blotky '02, J.D. '09, who in
terned at the White House in Presi
dent Bill Clinton's speechwriting of
fice in fall 2000. "The classes, semi
nars and cultural events really
opened my eyes to how wonderful
Washington is as a place to live."
Blotky said the strength of Stan
ford's Washington program was a
key factor in persuading him to study
at Stanford. A year after graduation,
Blotky served as communications di
rector for Representative JimTlirner
(D-Texas) and later as a press secre
tary and then communications direc
tor for Senator Ron Wyden '71 (D-
Ore.). He credited his internship ex
perience with launching his political
career.
"Stanford in Washington combines
the best of Stanford's interdiscipli
nary approach with actual practical
work experience and with all of the
best opportunities that make Stan
ford a great university," Blotky said.
Started in 1987 as the brainchild
of former University President Don
ald Kennedy and a host of others
dedicated to increasing the public
service opportunities available to
students on campus, SIW has grown
to encompass an alumni base of
more than 1.000 former students.
Jamieson said that the most inter
esting aspect of the program's next
20 years will be the continued ascen
dance of these alumni to positions of
influence. She said by then there will
be enough of a track record and his
tory of the program to watch SIW
alumni make a measurable impact
on civic life.
"Twenty years is still pretty
young " Jamieson said.
