## Editorial Board Fix Fix-It! 
### 
It is a tragicomic situation when the systems
set in place to fix simple problems are
themselves a broken mess. Such was the
case with Student Housing programs during
the past couple weeks.
The breakdown of the Web site
http://fixit.stanford.com, the destination for
residents to submit non-emergency fix-it re
quests for maintenance or custodial work, was
the most indicative and ironic of the problems.
The downtime of the emergency telephone
hotline 5-1602 "NOW," which student house
managers call for problems that involve a seri
ous health and safety risk or risk of damage to
facilities or property, posed a more potentially
threatening situation. In addition to a broken
fix-it site and a "NOW" hotline that could not
be reached, student house managers in the
Upper Row found that as administrative staff
members were reshuffled across the Student
Housing offices on campus, there were no
available administrators who could help them
fulfill their duties.
Many of Stanford's housing structures are
decades-old and have yet to undergo any
major renovations — windows are broken,
electricity outlets don't work, heating systems
are weak. These are systemic problems, and
the lack of care that Stanford has taken in up
keeping some of its older structures should
make us look at the money being poured into
new construction with a touch of skepticism.
While the desire to build new housing is un
derstandable in a nation where elite universi
ties are constantly competing to expand stu

dent bodies, alumni support and endlessly
growing endowments, maintenance of the cur
rently populated houses and dormitories that
were built decades ago should be prioritized
more highly by the administration.
The long-term problems of poor insulation
and creakiness in older houses are one thing —
they can add certain charms, which in turn can
define each residence's reputation — the col
lapse of systems intended to address more im
mediate concerns, such as sewage backups or
broken locks, is another. It must not be forgot
ten that at a certain level. Student Housing is
charged with the task of protecting the safety
and health of students When broken windows
are sealed by tape for weeks, when sewage
overflows sit in a bathroom for days, when bro
ken locks are not keeping anyone from coming
in through the doors and no one comes to fix
these problems, there are safety and sanitation
issues that disgrace the intelligence and re
sources available to Stanford administrators
While some of the most pressing issues in
the Student Housing office have been re
solved — the fix-it site is back up and running
— the unimpressive management of housing
problems requires some fixing itself. The sys
tem should be more transparent, so that after
filing for a repair request, students can see
where they are in the queue, or if there is a
queue at all. Some requests are answered in
days while others take weeks, and there seems
