## Is SAL 3 secret or not? 
### 
On Oct. 18,The Daily published a story
announcing the existence of a "secret
library," the off-campus location of
which the library communications director,
Andrew Herkovic, refused to disclose. The
next day, a letter to the editor appeared from
Anna Levia, a curatorial assistant in Green
Library. She wrote that the address was actu
ally available after a "cursory perusal" of the
library's Web site.
"Had April Fool's Day come early?"
Levia asked. I couldn't help wondering the
same thing. So what is the actual truth about
this library? And how did this all happen?
I've talked to the various people involved
in the story — Herkovic and Levia from the
library, Gerry Shih, who wrote the story, and
Andrea Fuller, the news editor who assigned
it — and as far as I can tell, it's just a series of
misunderstandings.
First, what are the facts? The Stanford
Auxiliary Library 3, or SAL 3, is an off-cam
pus library facility containing materials that
can be paged back to campus within 24
hours. It is essentially a high-tech ware
house, and is generally not open to the pub
lic or researchers. It is clearly displayed on
the library's Web page that the facility is in
Livermore, Calif.
The official library policy, Herkovic told
me, is not to reveal the precise address of the
facility. "There is no positive use for that in
formation, and there is potential damaging
use for that information," he explained. SAL 3
does not contain the library's most rare
books, Herkovic says, but it contains many
books that are "difficult or impossible to re
place."
Contrary to what Levia wrote in her let
ter, the exact address is not easily available
online — it takes some sleuthing, and a rea
sonably curious person might not find it.The
only listing of the library's address was in the
staff directory, which listed it in the contact
information for two workers. Since the letter
to the editor was published, the address has
been removed from there, as well, and is now
available only on The Daily Web site's copy
of Levia's letter to the editor.
(Ironically,despite this secrecy, the SAL 3
Web site does contain an architectural
sketch of the facility. Herkovic admitted that
"perhaps it would be best not to show it,"
though he added that "the sketch doesn't
correspond very well to my recollection of
the structure.")
How did this story get written? Fuller, the
news editor, asked Shih to look into how
more and more library books were being
moved off campus. Shih and Herkovic had a
20-minute phone interview on TUesday, Oct.
16. During the conversation, Shih learned
about the SAL 3 library. Since Herkovic had
told him that the facility, which is about three
years old, hadn't got much press, Shih decid
ed to focus on that.
Shih asked Herkovic if he could get a
tour, and was told that he could not.
Herkovic told Shih that all he could say
about its location was that it was about 50
miles away. Herkovic explained to me that
he hadn't been expecting the conversation
to get into the details of S AL3, and so he did
n't remember whether or not the fact that it
was in Livermore was to be publicly dis
closed, and so decided to be safe and not re
veal that. The interview continued with Shih
persisting about the details of the library.

asking at least twice more where the loca
tion of the library was.
Shih wrote the article, using the secret lo
cation as the hook. He said he considered
holding off the story to see if he could find out
the location, but decided not to. He did do a
quick search online, but didn't find that the li
brary was located in Livermore. Fuller said
that, when the article came in on Wednesday,
Oct. 17, she didn't think to look more into the
location, and the article was sent to print.
Levia, the curatorial assistant, said her
boss showed her the article when it ap
peared. She said she thought the article was a
bit "ridiculous," and she couldn't help but
w rite her letter. She hadn't been aware of any
policy against disclosing the location; when
she visited SAL 3 this summer with other li
brary staff members, she said, they weren't
told that it was a secret location.
Since the article and the letter to the edi
tor appeared, Herkovic said there hasn't
been any official memo within the library re
iterating the policy against disclosing the lo
cation. Levia said she isn't worried about
any repercussions for her letter; in fact, she
showed the letter to her boss, who she said
was amused by it.
In my opinion, it was good instinct for
Shih to press in the interview about the sur
prisingly secret location. It made for an in
teresting, if perhaps slightly sensationalized,
hook to a light article about a university fa
cility that not many people know about. And
1 think it's important for people to know
when a part of the University is being secre
tive (even if their justification seems reason
able and innocuous).
Since the precise location of the facility
isn't that important — it's just a warehouse
— and it was just a light story, perhaps a full
fledged investigation into the location wasn't
warranted. Still,The Daily should have spent
a bit more time looking into this. A few min
utes of Googling would have revealed that
The Daily itself published an article in 2003
about SAL 3 that mentions that the facility is
in Livermore.
As far as I can tell, the problems arose
merely because of a few misunderstandings
or small mistakes from well-intentioned peo
ple: Herkovic didn't remember what the pol
icy was on revealing that the library was in
Livermore; Levia hadn't known that there
was any policy against revealing the location;
the library Web site had included the address
on one page against its own policy; and Shih
and The Daily's editors could have done a bit
more research. Herkovic and Shih agree that
the article published accurately reflected
their conversation, and it does still provide an
informative overview of SAL3.I believe The
Daily made an appropriate decision in not
printing a correction and letting Levia's letter
speak for itself, since Shih's article was not in
correct per se.
Herkovic told me that he had been ex
pecting the interview to address the fact that
Meyer Library is closing, and the implica
tions for off-campus storage of books, but it
did not. This is an important topic, and raises
a serious issue about The Daily. It took until
today's paper for TTie Daily to write a full
story about the University's plans to demol
ish Meyer Library, even though it was men
tioned at the end of an Oct. 12 story about
he Faculty Senate and The Stanford
Report published an article about
he subject last week. For stories like
his, it might be all right to delay pub
ication for a day or two if necessary,
:o make sure the article is done well.
But it shouldn't take weeks. The

Daily should aspire to be the publi
cation of record for Stanford that
people turn to for news about Stan
ford. For this to happen, it can't keep
playing catch-up to The Stanford
Report.
