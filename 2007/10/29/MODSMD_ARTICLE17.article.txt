# Students Illustrated
## Coexisting with conservatism 
### 
Dan is a white, conservative. Christian
male. Take a moment and think about
that last sentence. What assumptions
do you make about the person behind it? Do
you think minority? Do you think of the last
time you argued about Iraq/abortion/envi
ronmental issues? Or do you conjure up im
ages of a belligerent Bill O'Reilly or a
George W. Bush fumbling over words as he
talks about God and the State?
However, Dan does not fit into any of the
boxes listed above. Not that he isn't a minor
ity — he is — but he's not the type of minor
ity that gets the most sympathy or face time
on campus. He combats negative stereotypes
about conservatives with his well-articulated
ideas, and he discusses politics with meas
ured restraint. And, he rarely gets the oppor
tunity to participate in lively debates about
controversial topics because often people
dismiss his opinions as backward.
Dan, like many other conservatives at
Stanford, feels uncomfortable voicing his po
litical viewpoints. While he respects mem
bers of the LGBT community, his traditional
Catholic upbringing makes him uncomfort
able with the thought of gay marriage. And
his laissez-faire economic viewpoints are
rooted in observing historical trends, not in
his parents' tax bracket. However, when he
mentions these ideas outside his close circle
of friends (who aren't all of the same politi
cal mindset), people often immediately re
ject his beliefs without bothering to listen to
his rationale.
From early on, Dan learned that his ideas
aren't accepted by the Stanford student body
as a whole. Before he enrolled, he was aware

of Stanford's historically liberal affiliations.
Upon arrival, he was immersed in a sea of
anti-conservative sentiment. For example,
during New Student Orientation this year, I
witnessed the beginnings of the indoctrina
tion: As a gay couple embraced on-stage, one
man stated, "And then someday this country
will let us get married." The comment was
met with uproarious applause. One of my
more conservative freshmen approached me
later that night and said it was made very
clear which stance regarding gay marriage
could be voiced.
The choice of which stance is acceptable to
voice even carries over into the classroom.
Dan notices that when assigned reading pub
lished by the Hoover Institution, the ideas
outlined in the paper are immediately dis
missed as trash, without ever making a critical
analysis of the argument.
Stanford's liberal campus makes a strong
effort to ensure that everyone in our diverse
student population feels a sense of inclusion,
regardless of their sexual orientation, ethnic
identity, and socio-economic backgrounds.
Why do we, as a community, fall short of ac
cepting those of different political beliefs?
Granted, it is difficult to argue for harsh
er immigration laws while also supporting

students who are the sons and daughters of
illegal immigrants. Or, to return to the NSO
example, while making Stanford a safe place
for all sexual orientations, it's hard to be out
spoken against gay rights. But, despite the
contradictory nature of these viewpoints,
Stanford's campus should be a place where
camps from completely opposite perspec
tives can coexist and learn from each other.
Conservatives are some of Stanford's
most valuable, untapped resources because
they offer an alternative perspective. Rather
than making conservatives uncomfortable
with voicing their opinions, liberals should
listen to (although they don't need to accept)
conservative viewpoints. Rather than dismiss
The Stanford Review, or Republicans as in
tolerant, liberals should not be intolerant of
conservatism. But, mind you, conservatives,
acceptance needs to go in both directions to
be effective. Together, liberals and conserva
tives can work together to develop more in
formed opinions.
For Dan, being a conservative at Stanford
is bittersweet. Although he's received more
than his fair share of criticism, he's recog
nized the value in his liberal classmates' per
spectives. Through the periodical discussions
he's had with those of differing political
opinions, he's become a more informed con
servative. He knows the counter-arguments
to his arguments, and he has even changed
some of his opinions. At the end of the day, he
knows what he believes in, and he knows
why.
