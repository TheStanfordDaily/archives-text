# Little Ms. Modern
## Macbook woes

Disclaimer: If you are easily offended,
you might want to skip over my col
umn this week. That's right, readers,
this is going to be my requisite inflammato
ry article. Don't be fooled by the innocuous
looking face smiling up at you above this
text (online readers: Trust me, quite innocu
ous-looking), because I have some gravely
ocuous things to say. What follows is my
take on a sharply divisive, bitterly emotion
al, deeply political issue that haunts our
modern lives: the Macintosh computer.
Like many, you may have assumed that I,
Little Ms. Modern, am a Mac person. (Shud
der.) "But of course!" you say to yourself as
you chuckle over my devastatingly clever
columns. "One of those artsy, designy, anti
hipster hipster types! Surely she's clicking
away right now on the lustrous keys of a pris
tine Macbook Fro as she sips a latte at a non-
Starbucks coffee bar that just oozes local fla
vor."
Wrong, wrong, wrong! First of all, I real
ly don't care for coffee. (How do I manage
all-nighters? By grossly over-hydrating my
self, thus inducing a constant urge to pee. It
keeps me remarkably alert!) And more im
portantly, as we speak, 1 am manning the
controls of the absolute antithesis of the

Macintosh notebook computer: my brand
new Lenovo ThinkPad.
In case you didn't know, this machine is
arguably the ugliest laptop ever conceived.
Its exterior is Death Star black and un
apologetically tank-like. Its keyboard is a
disorderly assemblage of chunky buttons
and inconsistently sized keys. Its color
scheme is insistently unattractive. And
lodged in the midst of everything, there is a
mystifying red mousing device that eerily
resembles a clitoris. (You have no idea how
dirty I feel as I scroll through my M ATLAB
code!)
How could I choose such a beast over the
beauty of a Mac? 1 can see how this might be
a conundrum for you, readers. After all, 1 am
supposedly obsessed with modern design,
and nothing says "modern" like an un

adorned titanium case, right? Well, no, and
that's exactly where my beef with Stevie J.
and his crew lies. Through what is probably
the most impressive cult-marketing cam
paign of our generation, this corporate em
pire has hijacked and monopolized the pub
lic perception of the modern aesthetic. Yes,
with their army of irresistibly stylish danc
ing silhouettes, they've managed to con
vince us that there is exactly one path to
sexy in the modern world: the sleek auto
bahn of muted, sterile minimalism.
This enrages every modern bone in my
body. First, why are we even talking about
sexy electronics? We're humans! We have
sex with other humans! Have we grown so
bored of objectifying our women that we
must now move on to our personal comput
ers? Bad news: No matter how you woo it,
your iMac is never going to sleep with you.
Same goes for your iPhone, your iPod, your
i√üook, and basically everything besides your
iGirlfriend and maybe iDrunkenFreshman.
So let's leave the sex to people, mm?
But more importantly, I take issue with
Apple because, in spite of their thoroughly
modern image, their core message violates
