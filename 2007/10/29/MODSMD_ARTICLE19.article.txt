Keeping Halloween Happy
As Stanford in Government Fellows over
the past three summers in the office of S.F.
Castro District Supervisor Bevan Dufty, we
have observed first-hand the process of try
ing to plan a safe and fun Halloween event in
the Castro.
Salone Kapur's Oct. 23 article ["SF Party
Off, Options Limited"] was spot-on in its de
scription of the problems surrounding the
event.The party has become increasingly un
safe and disruptive for actual Castro resi
dents. Much of the violence and hate speech
that began to characterize the event came

from intoxicated underage visitors to the
Castro (hopefully not any Stanford stu
dents!) with nowhere to go after the public
festivities had ended.
For years now, Supervisor Dufty, Mayor
Gavin Newsom and public safety officials
have done their best to address the policy
challenge of continuing a beloved communi
ty tradition without allowing disruptive visi
tors to threaten the safety of Castro resi
dents, the very people for whom the party is
intended. Last year, trying to balance these
two concerns, city officials and community
leaders worked together to find an alterna
tive approach, ultimately choosing a scaled

back event with a more dense police pres
ence. Sadly, that event was marred by the
highest level of violence yet.
In light of what happened last year, city
leaders had no choice but to cancel the
event. Ending Halloween in the Castro en
tirely is the only way for the city to ensure
the safety and well-being of Castro resi
dents. We encourage Stanford students to
help keep the Castro safe on Halloween by
enjoying the fun and safe celebrations on
campus.
