## Stanford aids victims of SoCal fires Houses of student families narrowly escape destructive blazes 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the wildfires in Southern California are
slowly coming under control, the University has
taken a number of financial and emotional steps to
help students affected by the blazes that have
drawn national attention in the past week.
To help with various unexpected expenses such
as insurance, medical bills, travel, car repairs and
other critical needs that may have come up due to
the disaster. Student Financial Services is offering
cash advances to all students in need.
"Because cash advances are necessary for criti
cal living expenses, we are sensitive to the fact that
time is of the essence for disbursing the funds," said
Teresa Janeway. director of Student Financial Ser
vices. "Therefore, a cash advance is typically ap
proved and posted to the student's account the
same day it is requested."
These emergency funds are added as a receiv
able to the student's University bill, she said, and
the repayment time is negotiable.
"Cash advances under normal circumstances
are usually payable back to the University by the
end of the current or subsequent term," Janeway
said. "However, during a time of emergency, we
recognize each student's situation is unique. We

will work one on one with the students that come
to us for assistance to establish a repayment time
for the advance."
If a student does not have the resources to repay
a relief loan within a few months, they can work
with the Financial Aid Office, said Director of Fi
nancial Aid Karen Cooper. The Office will assist
them with long-term student loans or scholarship
funds as appropriate.
"We are in a position to evaluate requests from
students as soon as they are ready to submit them,"
Cooper said. "Essentially what we will be doing is
re-evaluating all of the factors that go into calculat
ing an expected parent contribution as clearly this
tragedy will potentially affect family incomes and
assets as considered in the financial aid formulas.
"We will be working with families to gather in

formation about how the data they originally sub
mitted has been changed as a result of the fires."
she added. "Any decrease in expected parent con
tribution would be met with an increase in scholar
ship funds. I also expect we may hear from some
students who had not previously applied for aid.
We are still in a position to be able to help those
families as well."
In addition to the financial burden caused by
the fires, the University recognized that students
may be mentally affected by the strain of going to
classes during such an unstable time at home.
For students who wish to speak to professionals,
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is
the first point of call.

Firefighters fight a fire near San Diego last week. Stanford will step up to aid affected students
monetarily, providing short-term loans and reevaluating financial aid packages for affected students.
"We give priority access to stu
dents who may be in crisis," said
CAPS Associate Director Alejandro
Martinez. "We will see students the
same day if need he."
While professional help is avail
able, Stanford students have banded
together amidst the chaos to support
friends and share anxieties.
"When 1 first heard about the fires,
I was very worried and thought of my
family and what I wanted to save,"
said Alif Khalfan '08, a student from
the San Diego suburb of Escondido,
whose family was evacuated from his
home."But then I instantly thought of
my friend in my hall and went straight
to her. We consoled each other and
sat and watched the news together."
The blaze came within 200 yards
of Khalfan's house, which was saved

by the efforts of state firefighters.
"I was worried for a whole day and
found it harder than usual to focus in
classes, although I think that I han
dled it fairly well," he said.
Emily Hulme '11, a student from
Poway, a town near San Diego, said
she knew a number of people whose
houses were destroyed by the fires,
and added that her family was evacu
ated from their home.
"It was very surreal in the respect
that when you hear about fires or
floods and people getting displaced.it
doesn't really affect you personally,"
she said. "But this time for us, it was
very real."
While Hulme's house was not
burned down, she acknowledged that
many students like herself were indi
rectly affected by the fires.
"My parents told me there was ash
everywhere in the house and every
thing smclled ofsmoke,"shesaid."ltis
also really bad because the area I live
in is a very scenic place with nature
preserves, which has now been

charred "
In an email sent to students last
Hiesday, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman listed resources
for those affected by the fires. He also
encouraged unaffected students to
reach out to their friends with rela
tives in Southern California.
"One of the many strengths of our
community is the compassion and
care we show others in need," he said
in the email. "Let's make sure we
demonstrate this concern in our daily
interaction with each other."

nancial assistance can request funds
