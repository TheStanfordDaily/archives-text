## Stanford aids victims of SoCal fires Houses of student families narrowly escape destructive blazes 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the wildfires in Southern California are
slowly coming under control, the University has
taken a number of financial and emotional steps to
help students affected by the blazes that have
drawn national attention in the past week.
To help with various unexpected expenses such
as insurance, medical bills, travel, car repairs and
other critical needs that may have come up due to
the disaster. Student Financial Services is offering
cash advances to all students in need.
"Because cash advances are necessary for criti
cal living expenses, we are sensitive to the fact that
time is of the essence for disbursing the funds," said
Teresa Janeway. director of Student Financial Ser
vices. "Therefore, a cash advance is typically ap
proved and posted to the student's account the
same day it is requested."
These emergency funds are added as a receiv
able to the student's University bill, she said, and
the repayment time is negotiable.
"Cash advances under normal circumstances
are usually payable back to the University by the
end of the current or subsequent term," Janeway
said. "However, during a time of emergency, we
recognize each student's situation is unique. We

will work one on one with the students that come
to us for assistance to establish a repayment time
for the advance."
If a student does not have the resources to repay
a relief loan within a few months, they can work
with the Financial Aid Office, said Director of Fi
nancial Aid Karen Cooper. The Office will assist
them with long-term student loans or scholarship
funds as appropriate.
"We are in a position to evaluate requests from
students as soon as they are ready to submit them,"
Cooper said. "Essentially what we will be doing is
re-evaluating all of the factors that go into calculat
ing an expected parent contribution as clearly this
tragedy will potentially affect family incomes and
assets as considered in the financial aid formulas.
"We will be working with families to gather in

formation about how the data they originally sub
mitted has been changed as a result of the fires."
she added. "Any decrease in expected parent con
tribution would be met with an increase in scholar
ship funds. I also expect we may hear from some
students who had not previously applied for aid.
We are still in a position to be able to help those
families as well."
In addition to the financial burden caused by
the fires, the University recognized that students
may be mentally affected by the strain of going to
classes during such an unstable time at home.
For students who wish to speak to professionals,
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is
the first point of call.
