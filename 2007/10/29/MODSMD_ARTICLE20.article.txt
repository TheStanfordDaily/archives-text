## IN L.A. Women beat No. 7 UCLA, fall to No. 6 USC 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team played a
pair of tough, back-and-forth matches in Los Angeles this
weekend, overpowering No. 7 UCLA for its 20th win of the
season and coming up short against No. 6 Southern Califor
nia. Both matches ended with 3-1 scores as the Cardinal
beat the Bruins for the 14th straight time and dropped only
its second match of the season to the Trojans.
Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo had an out
standing weekend, the Cardinal attack was balanced
among all five hitters and freshman libero Gabi Ailes broke
the Stanford single-match dig record, but Stanford (20-2,9-
1 Pac-10) nonetheless returned home with a weekend split.
Akinradewo had 34 kills on the weekend and hit .518.
Ailes had 20 digs against UCLA (16-6, 6-5) and then
notched 31 at USC (19-3, 8-3). The previous high for the
Cardinal was 30 digs, held by Lisa Sharpley and Kerri Walsh
who each had 30 in Stanford's 3-2 win over Penn State in the
1997 NCAA final.
The Cardinal won the first game of both of this week
end's matches by a score of 30-20 before losing the second.
Against UCLA, Stanford bounced back and won the third
and fourth, but the Cardinal found itself in early holes
against USC and could not come back.
Stanford raced to a sizeable lead to start the match Fri
day, taking seven of the first eight points from the stunned
Bruins. UCLA prevented any more Stanford runs in the
game, but could not string together more than three points
of their own. The Bruins made back-to-back errors and
Stanford won the game, 30-20, on a kill by senior middle
blocker Franci Girard.
After UCLA scored first in the second game, junior out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza tallied three straight kills to put
her team in front.The score was tied 13 times in the course
of the game, as late as 24-all, but UCLA picked up its play
at the right time to tie the match with a 30-28 win in the
game.
Stanford again had the quicker start out of the halftime
break and built a small lead, though the Bruins battled back
to tie at 14. Junior right side Erin Waller served five straight
points to stretch the Cardinal's lead to 27-19, and Stanford
put the game away, 30-22, on an ace by junior outside hitter
Cynthia Barboza and a kill by freshman outside Alix Kline
man.
The Cardinal looked to win the match easily in the
fourth game, leaving UCLA behind early.The Bruins would
not go down without a fight, though. With the Cardinal at
match point at 29-21. UCLA reeled off six straight points
before Waller finally got the kill Stanford needed, with a
final game score of 30-27.
Klineman finished the match with 16 kills, leading four
Stanford hitters in double digits. Akinradewo and Barboza
had 14 each — and Akinradewo hit .565 — while Girard
chipped in 11.
The Cardinal shook off the serving troubles that hound-
