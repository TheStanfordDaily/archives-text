## The
						new power in the Pac-10 
### 
Nine weeks into the college football sea
son, it seems a new powerhouse has
emerged in the Pac-10: Oregon.
Week 1 saw Southern California ranked
No. 1 and Oregon unranked in the Associated
Press Top 25. Following its upset loss to Stan
ford, USC dropped to No. 10 by Week 6, while
Oregon (No. 9) had jumped the Trojans de
spite an early-season loss to Cal.
This Saturday, the two faced each other in
one of the most anticipated Pac-10 match ups
of the season. USC had a three game winning
streak in the series, most recently trouncing
the Ducks 35-10 last year in L.A. This week
end. however, for the first time in recent
memory, the Trojans were underdogs in a con
ference game.
The first quarter saw the Ducks take an
early lead with a 13-play drive for 72 yards that
culminated in a 2-yard score by Heisman can
didate quarterback Dennis Dixon. The TYo
jans got on the scoreboard with a 30-yard field
goal in the second quarter, but their oppo
nents quickly responded with a 41-yarder of
their own. The score at the half: 10-3, Ducks.
The Trojans opened the second half strong,
with quarterback Mark Sanchez passing for
54 yards in the opening drive, which culminat
ed in a nine-yard completing to Patrick 'Rim
er for a touchdown. Despite having a chance
to take the lead later in the quarter, USC fum
bled deep in its own territory, handing the ball
and the momentum back to Oregon. Duck
running back Jonathan Stewart finished off
the drive with a 14-yard run to give Oregon a

17-10 lead.
The Ducks opened up a two touchdown
lead after the first drive of the fourth quarter.
After USC battled hack to make it 24-17,
Sanchez threw a game-ending interception as
the Trojans were driving in the final moments.
Sanchez — filling in for John David Booty
who sat out with a broken middle finger on
his throwing hand — completed 26 of 41
passes for 277 yards and two touchdowns.
Dixon completed 16 of 25 passes for 157
yards. USC finished with 378 total yards to
Oregon's 339.
Ultimately, though, it was the turnovers —
the fumble and two interceptions — which
sealed the TYojans' fate.
"If you look at this game, turnovers were
the story for us," USC head coach Pete Carroll
told ESPN. "In the second half when you have
to play right and do things right, we gave them
a couple easy shots and they took advantage
and played a very good football game."
Indeed, at the start of the third quarter, the
Ducks — ranked third nationally in scoring
offense — found themselves tied with the
Trojans, whose defense is the nation's third
best. At just 10-10, it was anybody's ball game.
That was until the Trojans started turning
the ball over. Ttoo of the USC miscues led di
rectly to Duck touchdowns. The third
turnover — the last minute interception —
sealed the 24-17 win for Oregon.
Dixon's versatility at quarterback is gar-
