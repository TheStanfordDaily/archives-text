The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
came away from its desert road trip with a
win and a tie, heating Arizona 3-1 on Friday
before fighting to a scoreless draw with Ari
zona State yesterday afternoon.
Sophomore forward Kelley O'Hara pro
vided virtually all the offense for the Cardi
nal (11-2-3), scoring two goals in less than
ten minutes to break the Arizona game
open in the second half, and accounting for
all three of Stanford's shots on goal in the
match against Arizona State.
Fellow sophomore forward Ali Riley
scored the Cardinal's other goal against the
Wildcats, a game which saw senior goal
keeper Erica Holland return to the field for
Stanford after over a month on the sidelines.
Holland checked in at the beginning of the
second half of the Arizona game and played
the entire next match against the Sun Dev
ils, earning a shutout in that contest.
O'Hara's quick pair of strikes in the sec
ond half of the Arizona game came just after
the Cardinal had started to play themselves
into the match.The first half was a foul-filled
affair with no real highlights, but Stanford
stormed out of the gate with three shots in
the opening 12 minutes of the next period.
Another Arizona foul ultimately opened
the floodgates for the Cardinal in the 66th

GAMf. NOTES; No. 5 Stanford's record now stands at
11 -2-3 overall and 2-1 -3 In Pac-10 play. Sunday's tie
against Arizona State was the Cardinal's third tie in six
games. Sophomore Kelley O'Hano was the difference
for Stanford lost Friday, scoring two goals in the team's
3-1 win over Arizona.

minute. O'Hara stepped up and booted the
free kick on goal. Wildcats goalkeeper Hal
ley Brown got a hand on the shot, but the
linesman ruled that the ball crossed the goal
line before Brown could gain full control.
The evening did not get any better for the
Arizona keeper, who made three total saves.
With sixteen minutes remaining in the half,
a back-pass from the Wildcats defense
skipped past Brown, allowing O'Hara to run
in behind her and place the ball in the empty
net.

The No. 3 Cardinal had little trouble in disposing of the No. 7 UCLA Bruins last Friday, 3-1. However, the tables were turned on
Stanford Saturday, as USC beat the Cardinal 3-1. Stanford's overall record now stands at 20-2.
Arizona would not go quietly,
though, and struck back with a goal
by Jacqueline Broussard just two
minutes later. Stanford did not let
up, and Riley iced the game with
five minutes to go, getting behind
the defense and finishing past the
harried Brown.
ITie match-up with the Sun Dev
ils proved to be fairly nondescript

the whole way through. Stanford
had a promising start, with three
shots on goal by O'Hara in the first
ten minutes, but all flew high or
wide. Over 110 minutes of play. Hol
land made only four saves, while
ASU keeper Briana Silvestri made
three.
Stanford returns home this up
coming weekend for the final two
home games of the regular season,
against Washington and Washing
ton State.
