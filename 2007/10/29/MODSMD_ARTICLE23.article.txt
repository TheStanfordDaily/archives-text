# On the Oregon Trail

### 
Stanford fans listening on
KNBR and KZSU this Satur
day had to be thinking "here it
comes" throughout the second half,
waiting for the Cardinal offense to
drive unstoppably down the field
and eke out another last-minute win.
But the magic was not in store for
Stanford's third straight road victo
ry; instead, the Cardinal were shut
down the entire game and could
manage only two field goals in a 23-
6 loss.
The Cardinal's razor-thin wins at
Southern California and at Arizona
have been keyed by keeping the
game close, huge defensive stands
that turn the momentum, and a "just
enough" offensive performance that
scores key points at key opportuni
ties.
The difference between last week
and this week started with the oppo
nent.
Oregon State is a much better
squad than Arizona, and was defi
nitely ready to dispatch a Stanford
team playing thin. The Cardinal de
fense was able to contain Oregon
State, missing its best player in the
second half, but the offense — fac
ing serious depth issues at running
back, tight end and wide receiver —
could not capitalize.
The defense clearly has the big
play spirit that opportunistic units
need: when a pass intended for Mark
Bradford was intercepted in the
fourth quarter, safety Bo McNally
ran out onto the field slapping his
teammates on the helmet, ready to
play another series a play after
they'd gotten off the field.
This is a season still in flux for
Stanford, with injuries giving new
players an opportunity to show their
stuff. Several more players must
prove themselves, particularly on
the offense, if Stanford is going to
push for a bowl game.
Oregon State's losses in recent
seasons have been marked by a flur
ry of turnovers and penalties, a trend
not bucked by this year's blowout
losses. Against Stanford, though,
Oregon State held together and de
fended its home turf. Nonetheless,
this was possibly the toughest of the
Cardinal's five remaining games and
many fans were factoring a loss to
the Beavers in their late-season pro
jections.
Beavers coach Mike Riley inter
viewed for the Stanford job in 2002
after Tyrone Willingham left for
Notre Dame. Athletic director Ted
Leland called him back for a second
interview, but the position ultimate
ly went to Buddy Teevens. It was re
ported Riley would have accepted
had he been offered the job. The fol
lowing year, Riley returned to Ore
gon State for his second go at run
ning the Beaver program, and is 3-0
in bowl games since then.
He has been particularly tough to
Stanford when given the opportuni
ty, pounding the Cardinal 43-3 in
2003 and calling for a late fourth
down quarterback sneak in last
year's game to make it 30-7.
Oregon State's win was the night
cap of a big football day in the state.
Shortly before kickoff, Oregon's 24-
17 win over USC went final in Eu
gene, putting Oregon in the Pac-10
driver's seat and all but ending
USC's national title hopes. North of
Corvallis, Portland State was part of
an NCAA record in its 73-68 home
loss to Weber State. The 141-point
contest was the highest-scoring
game since the NCAA started keep
ing records.
Announced attendance was
42.089, less than three thousand shy
of a sellout. The 1-5 corridor was
jammed into the night with Beaver
and Duck fans traveling north to
Portland.
With seven boots for 287 yards,
senior punter Jay Ottovegio became
Stanford's career leader in punts
(255) and punt yardage (10.176) dur
ing the game, passing Kevin Miller.
Part of the congratulations goes to
senior long snapper Brent New
house, who has delivered Ottovegio
the ball on every one of those punts.
The pair has had only two punts


Christopher P.
Anderson
blocked, both in 2006. Newhouse
has also taken over the field goal
and extra-point short snapping this
season, excelling on the placekick
ing unit as well.
Stanford needs at least three
wins in its last four games to be con
sidered for a bowl game, and its next
two opponents both won on Satur
day. Washington brings dual-threat
quarterback Jake Locker to Stan
ford Stadium next week as former
Cardinal coach Tyrone Willingham
returns to the Farm. Locker ac
counted for 493 total yards and five
touchdowns in the Huskies' 48-41
loss to Arizona. The Cardinal's next
opponent, Washington State, gave
UCLA its first Pac-10 loss, running
98 plays in a 27-7 victory.
The Cardinal's Nov. 24 oppo
nent, 1-7 Notre Dame, had a bye
Saturday, and despite Internet jokes
to the contrary, did not lose to its
phantom opponent.
