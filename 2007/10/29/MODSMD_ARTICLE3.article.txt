## Housing task forces consider Draw reforms 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Upperclassmen frustrated by their undesirable "preferred"
Draw numbers may see their luck change in coming years.
This fall, as part of the Housing Master Plan first articulated
in February 2005, Student Housing created two new task forces
to re-evaluate the Draw. The first will consider changing the
structure of the system and the second will work to ensure the
prtKess accommodates transgender students in accordance

with the University's updated
nondiscrimination policy.
"The basic goal is we want to
try to simplify the Draw," said
Housing Director Rodger Whit
ney, of the goals of the Housing
Draw Task Force. "Everybody
thinks the Draw is too compli
cated. We don't want it to be like
that."
Whitney added that simpli
fying the system should increase
transparency and improve the
general perception of the
Draw's fairness.
"We want to ensure that peo-

pie aren't gaming the system," he said.
According to Whitney, one of the plan's goals is to improve
allocation of "premier spaces" — singles and two-room doubles
— for upperclassmen.With the completion of a new upperclass
man dorm and a "green" Row house, the University intends to
"unstuff" triples in crowded dorms like Mirrielees and Branner.
A revamped housing assignment system will more fairly allo
cate these rooms.
"We want to try to create a more fair system than goes on
now," Whitney said, adding that the task force will look at the
possibility of a three-tiered draw system to fix current problems.
A key concern is to ensure that students do not draw two pre
ferred years in the 1 .(XX) to 2.000 range, where most Row hous
es are out of the question.
Students voiced mixed reactions to the proposal of three
tiered priority system, which would effectively ensure students
one year of Draw numbers below 1,000, another year between
1,000 and 2,0(X) and a final unpreferred year of numbers above
2.000.

"I think that it's good that seniors
can plan for a year of good housing,"
said Mars resident Taylor Durand TO.
Kayla Barr TO agreed that it might
make the system fairer to assure sen
iors one year of top-pick housing.
But Columbae resident Annie
Schiff "08 saw things differently.
"I feel like it would make things
more complicated," she said. "It's not
like all forms of housing fall into three
consistent tiers."
Last year. Philosophy Prof. Marc
Pauly '96 surveyed the theoretical liter
ature on two-sided match systems like
the housing Draw He has worked with
Student Housing in the past, though he
has not yet been invited to join a task
force this year.
The issue now, he said, is that the
housing assignment process has be
come too complicated.
"The problem is that the system has
existed for so long and there have been
so many add-ons," Pauly said, "that it
has become so complicated that only
the programmer really understands
the ins and outs."
With two tiers of preference and
multiple levels of priority in theme
houses among other confounding fac
tors, the current system can be difficult
to navigate. Pauly himself favors a sim
plified version, though he added that
with every change there is a trade-off.
With a simplified system, he said, not all
current options may remain available.
He offered the analogy of Ameri
can and French dining experiences. In
the first, the chef cooks to the desire of
clients; in the second, the clients accept
the chefs idea of what is good.
"Maybe we want to see it as our
right as an education provider to de
cide that there are certain things that
students should walk away with from
their housing experience," he said."l'm
okay with being paternalistic if we

agree."
The Draw itself has been in exis
tence since 1969, undergoing relatively
few changes through the years, accord
ing to Draw programmer Rich Wales.
The last change to the Stanford system,
which allowed Draw groups to stay to
gether automatically, was added in
1999.
"For 38 years, thi+s Draw system has
served the housing system very well,"
Whitney said. "The computer system
that Rich Wales designed has been re
markably flexible."
He added that Starßez, a new sys
tem being acquired this year, boasts the
additional capability of bypassing the
in-house draw and assigning students
directly to rooms. This feature — now
in place at Princeton and a few other
universities across the country — will
be considered by the task force.
Most students interviewed were
against removing the in-house draw,
thinking that it will further complicate
the system and place priority on room
quality rather than community, but
John Maas '08 said he understood the
value of the system.
"Sophomore year 1 would have
thought that drawing in for your room
was a good idea," Maas said. "I drew
into Bob, but my Draw group was last
to go in the in-house draw and we got
left with the quint [five-person suite]. I
definitely wouldn't have chosen to live
there if I had known that would hap
pen."
Currently a resident of Columbae,
Maas said that he is now not so sure
what he thinks, since he does value the
house community in addition to room
assignment. Fellow Columbae resident
Schiff said the same.
"For me, the kind of housing com
munity matters more than the room,"
Schiff said, adding that Columbae
switches rooms every quarter anyway.
"I didn't go into my senior year Draw
looking for houses with singles, but
looking for houses with a good com
munity."
Students shouldn't anticipate
changes to the Draw structure before

2010, the year in which the Master
Housing Plan is set to go into effect.
Members for the Draw task force
have yet to be chosen. Director of
Housing Assignments Sue Nunan
wrote in an email to The Daily, but the
force will include representatives from
the offices of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, the Vice
Provost for Residential and Dining
Enterprises, Student Housing. Resi
dential Education and student mem
bers appointed by the ASSU.
While the Draw task force is still in
its preliminary stages, the second
Housing workgroup, a Gender Identi
ty Housing Support Task Force, held its
first meeting last Thursday.
"Housing itself is going to be put
ting in a special policy making sure stu
dents know that they are open to any
special requests based on gender iden
tity," said ASSU President Hershey
Avula '08, a member of the task force.
Whitney said Housing currently ac
commodates requests based on gender
identity on an ad hoc basis, but that it
may not be reaching all students. The
new policy will reflect the values artic
ulated in the University's updated
nondiscrimination policy and will try to
standardize the procedure for gender
identity-based assignments.
"The biggest issue was whether or
not students would actually have to say
they are transgender," Avula said.
He added that the new policy would
not require students to explicitly say
they were transgender.
Whitney estimated that the task
force would be meeting twice monthly
for much of the year, and Avula said the
findings of the gender task force should
go into effect this spring.
"The changes outlined in the Hous
ing Master Plan offer the potential to
improve greatly both housing options
and housing allocation policies," Whit
ney said. "Once implemented, all un
dergraduates should reap the bene
fits."

ferred years in the 1 .(XX) to 2.000 range, where most Row hous
es are out of the question.
Students voiced mixed reactions to the proposal of three
tiered priority system, which would effectively ensure students
one year of Draw numbers below 1,000, another year between
1,000 and 2,0(X) and a final unpreferred year of numbers above
2.000.

"I think that it's good that seniors
can plan for a year of good housing,"
said Mars resident Taylor Durand TO.
Kayla Barr TO agreed that it might
make the system fairer to assure sen
iors one year of top-pick housing.
But Columbae resident Annie
Schiff "08 saw things differently.
"I feel like it would make things
more complicated," she said. "It's not
like all forms of housing fall into three
consistent tiers."
Last year. Philosophy Prof. Marc
Pauly '96 surveyed the theoretical liter
ature on two-sided match systems like
the housing Draw He has worked with
Student Housing in the past, though he
has not yet been invited to join a task
force this year.
The issue now, he said, is that the
housing assignment process has be
come too complicated.
"The problem is that the system has
existed for so long and there have been
so many add-ons," Pauly said, "that it
has become so complicated that only
the programmer really understands
the ins and outs."
With two tiers of preference and
multiple levels of priority in theme
houses among other confounding fac
tors, the current system can be difficult
to navigate. Pauly himself favors a sim
plified version, though he added that
with every change there is a trade-off.
With a simplified system, he said, not all
current options may remain available.
He offered the analogy of Ameri
can and French dining experiences. In
the first, the chef cooks to the desire of
clients; in the second, the clients accept
the chefs idea of what is good.
"Maybe we want to see it as our
right as an education provider to de
cide that there are certain things that
students should walk away with from
their housing experience," he said."l'm
okay with being paternalistic if we

agree."
The Draw itself has been in exis
tence since 1969, undergoing relatively
few changes through the years, accord
ing to Draw programmer Rich Wales.
The last change to the Stanford system,
which allowed Draw groups to stay to
gether automatically, was added in
1999.
"For 38 years, thi+s Draw system has
served the housing system very well,"
Whitney said. "The computer system
that Rich Wales designed has been re
markably flexible."
He added that Starßez, a new sys
tem being acquired this year, boasts the
additional capability of bypassing the
in-house draw and assigning students
directly to rooms. This feature — now
in place at Princeton and a few other
universities across the country — will
be considered by the task force.
Most students interviewed were
against removing the in-house draw,
thinking that it will further complicate
the system and place priority on room
quality rather than community, but
John Maas '08 said he understood the
value of the system.
"Sophomore year 1 would have
thought that drawing in for your room
was a good idea," Maas said. "I drew
into Bob, but my Draw group was last
to go in the in-house draw and we got
left with the quint [five-person suite]. I
definitely wouldn't have chosen to live
there if I had known that would hap
pen."
Currently a resident of Columbae,
Maas said that he is now not so sure
what he thinks, since he does value the
house community in addition to room
assignment. Fellow Columbae resident
Schiff said the same.
"For me, the kind of housing com
munity matters more than the room,"
Schiff said, adding that Columbae
switches rooms every quarter anyway.
"I didn't go into my senior year Draw
looking for houses with singles, but
looking for houses with a good com
munity."
Students shouldn't anticipate
changes to the Draw structure before

2010, the year in which the Master
Housing Plan is set to go into effect.
Members for the Draw task force
have yet to be chosen. Director of
Housing Assignments Sue Nunan
wrote in an email to The Daily, but the
force will include representatives from
the offices of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, the Vice
Provost for Residential and Dining
Enterprises, Student Housing. Resi
dential Education and student mem
bers appointed by the ASSU.
While the Draw task force is still in
its preliminary stages, the second
Housing workgroup, a Gender Identi
ty Housing Support Task Force, held its
first meeting last Thursday.
"Housing itself is going to be put
ting in a special policy making sure stu
dents know that they are open to any
special requests based on gender iden
tity," said ASSU President Hershey
Avula '08, a member of the task force.
Whitney said Housing currently ac
commodates requests based on gender
identity on an ad hoc basis, but that it
may not be reaching all students. The
new policy will reflect the values artic
ulated in the University's updated
nondiscrimination policy and will try to
standardize the procedure for gender
identity-based assignments.
"The biggest issue was whether or
not students would actually have to say
they are transgender," Avula said.
He added that the new policy would
not require students to explicitly say
they were transgender.
Whitney estimated that the task
force would be meeting twice monthly
for much of the year, and Avula said the
findings of the gender task force should
go into effect this spring.
"The changes outlined in the Hous
ing Master Plan offer the potential to
improve greatly both housing options
and housing allocation policies," Whit
ney said. "Once implemented, all un
dergraduates should reap the bene
fits."

Upperclassmen frustrated by their undesirable "preferred"
Draw numbers may see their luck change in coming years.
This fall, as part of the Housing Master Plan first articulated
in February 2005, Student Housing created two new task forces
to re-evaluate the Draw. The first will consider changing the
structure of the system and the second will work to ensure the
prtKess accommodates transgender students in accordance

with the University's updated
nondiscrimination policy.
"The basic goal is we want to
try to simplify the Draw," said
Housing Director Rodger Whit
ney, of the goals of the Housing
Draw Task Force. "Everybody
thinks the Draw is too compli
cated. We don't want it to be like
that."
Whitney added that simpli
fying the system should increase
transparency and improve the
general perception of the
Draw's fairness.
"We want to ensure that peo-

pie aren't gaming the system," he said.
According to Whitney, one of the plan's goals is to improve
allocation of "premier spaces" — singles and two-room doubles
— for upperclassmen.With the completion of a new upperclass
man dorm and a "green" Row house, the University intends to
"unstuff" triples in crowded dorms like Mirrielees and Branner.
A revamped housing assignment system will more fairly allo
cate these rooms.
"We want to try to create a more fair system than goes on
now," Whitney said, adding that the task force will look at the
possibility of a three-tiered draw system to fix current problems.
