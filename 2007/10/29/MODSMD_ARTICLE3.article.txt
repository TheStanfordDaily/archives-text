## Housing task forces consider Draw reforms 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Upperclassmen frustrated by their undesirable "preferred"
Draw numbers may see their luck change in coming years.
This fall, as part of the Housing Master Plan first articulated
in February 2005, Student Housing created two new task forces
to re-evaluate the Draw. The first will consider changing the
structure of the system and the second will work to ensure the
prtKess accommodates transgender students in accordance

with the University's updated
nondiscrimination policy.
"The basic goal is we want to
try to simplify the Draw," said
Housing Director Rodger Whit
ney, of the goals of the Housing
Draw Task Force. "Everybody
thinks the Draw is too compli
cated. We don't want it to be like
that."
Whitney added that simpli
fying the system should increase
transparency and improve the
general perception of the
Draw's fairness.
"We want to ensure that peo-

pie aren't gaming the system," he said.
According to Whitney, one of the plan's goals is to improve
allocation of "premier spaces" — singles and two-room doubles
— for upperclassmen.With the completion of a new upperclass
man dorm and a "green" Row house, the University intends to
"unstuff" triples in crowded dorms like Mirrielees and Branner.
A revamped housing assignment system will more fairly allo
cate these rooms.
"We want to try to create a more fair system than goes on
now," Whitney said, adding that the task force will look at the
possibility of a three-tiered draw system to fix current problems.
A key concern is to ensure that students do not draw two pre
ferred years in the 1 .(XX) to 2.000 range, where most Row hous
es are out of the question.
Students voiced mixed reactions to the proposal of three
tiered priority system, which would effectively ensure students
one year of Draw numbers below 1,000, another year between
1,000 and 2,0(X) and a final unpreferred year of numbers above
2.000.
