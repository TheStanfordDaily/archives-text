# Meyer set for razing by 2012
## Smaller structure to replace 41 year-old "eyesore" 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Meyer Library, many students' fa
vorite 24-hour study area and home
to seemingly endless numbers of
computers for the past 41 years, will
be gone by 2012, according to Uni
versity and library administrators.
The new seismic standards im
posed after the l l )8 l ) Loma Prieta
earthquake were one of many prob
lems plaguing the library. According
to Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82, the University has been upgrad
ing existing buildings that do not
meet the new standards, of which
Meyer is one such structure.
The cost of renovating the four
floor library, however, created an
other decision for the provost: up
grade Meyer or replace it?
"When we received estimates of
the cost of bringing Meyer up to
modern seismic standards, the cost
was over $40 million, and the needed
changes would make the building
even less attractive than it is today,"
Etchemendy wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Because of this, I decided

that instead of spending a huge
amount of money upgrading the
building, we should demolish it and
build a smaller, replacement library
for approximately the same cost."
While plans for the Meyer project
remain in their preliminary stages,
the building's eventual fate has al
ready been decided.
"Meyer Library is essentially
doomed," said Andrew Herkovic, di
rector of communications and devel
opment of libraries. "The building
has not aged very gracefully, it needs
millions of dollars worth of seismic
upgrades and it's not cost-effective
to keep it in the long term. It's also, in
my opinion, an eyesore."
A second reason for the library's
demolition is its violation of previous
plans for campus layout.
"The original campus master plan
wanted that area to be a corridor, not
a building," Herkovic said. "Today it
is very much in the way of traffic, and
it also stands out oddly as a building
larger than those around it. Architec
turally, that's considered a defect."
