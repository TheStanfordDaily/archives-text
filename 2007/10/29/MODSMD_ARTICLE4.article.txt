# Meyer set for razing by 2012
## Smaller structure to replace 41 year-old "eyesore" 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Meyer Library, many students' fa
vorite 24-hour study area and home
to seemingly endless numbers of
computers for the past 41 years, will
be gone by 2012, according to Uni
versity and library administrators.
The new seismic standards im
posed after the l l )8 l ) Loma Prieta
earthquake were one of many prob
lems plaguing the library. According
to Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82, the University has been upgrad
ing existing buildings that do not
meet the new standards, of which
Meyer is one such structure.
The cost of renovating the four
floor library, however, created an
other decision for the provost: up
grade Meyer or replace it?
"When we received estimates of
the cost of bringing Meyer up to
modern seismic standards, the cost
was over $40 million, and the needed
changes would make the building
even less attractive than it is today,"
Etchemendy wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Because of this, I decided

that instead of spending a huge
amount of money upgrading the
building, we should demolish it and
build a smaller, replacement library
for approximately the same cost."
While plans for the Meyer project
remain in their preliminary stages,
the building's eventual fate has al
ready been decided.
"Meyer Library is essentially
doomed," said Andrew Herkovic, di
rector of communications and devel
opment of libraries. "The building
has not aged very gracefully, it needs
millions of dollars worth of seismic
upgrades and it's not cost-effective
to keep it in the long term. It's also, in
my opinion, an eyesore."
A second reason for the library's
demolition is its violation of previous
plans for campus layout.
"The original campus master plan
wanted that area to be a corridor, not
a building," Herkovic said. "Today it
is very much in the way of traffic, and
it also stands out oddly as a building
larger than those around it. Architec
turally, that's considered a defect."
According to Herkovic, Meyer
will be demolished within five years,
and its smaller replacement will be
south of the current location. The
new downsized building, however,
will be unable to house the same re
sources that Meyer current accom
modates.
"The replacement building will
house the 'people' functions that are
currently in Meyer, including the
Academic Computing and student
study space," Etchemendy wrote,
"but it will not be a book storage fa
cility."
Meyer currently stores more than
520,000 books as part of the East
Asia Library (EAL). Those books,
along with those in the Green Li
brary stacks located underneath
Meyer, will need to be relocated.
"The EAL selectors and public
service staff and a portion of the
EAL collection will be relocated to
Green Library, resulting in the dis
placement of some Green Library
collections," wrote University Li
brarian Michael Keller in a public
letter. "Those displaced collections,
as well as the majority of the EAL
collection, will continue to be avail
able, but will be stored offsite at the
Stanford Auxiliary Library 3 (SAL 3)
in Livermore and available through
a paging service."
The University cannot construct
a new building to house displaced
books because of restrictions im
posed by the Santa Clara County
General Use Permit (GUP), which is
an agreement on how much Stanford
can expand its physical footprint on
the property it owns.
"The GUP is very political and
has many complex details, not unre
lated to the area's traffic burden,"
Herkovic said. "Even if we had all
the money in the world, we could not
use it to build infinitely. In fact we
can hardly build at all. It's sort of a
no-win situation."
The limitations imposed by the
GUP raise the question of whether it
will be books or people that are relo
cated.
"In effect, for every 75 square feet
we build to house books on campus,
we have to move another person to
an off-campus location,"
Etchemendy wrote. "I would rather
move rarely-used books and bring

them to campus when they're re
quested than move more staff or fac
ulty off campus."
"The library stacks are essentially
sacrificial lambs to the general cam
pus needs," Herkovic added.
Meyer staff not moved to the re
placement building on campus, how
ever, will have to be relocated to
Stanford North Campus in Red
wood City, according to Keller â€” a
prospect that raised concern among
third-floor Meyer employees.
"We know that space is a premi
um on campus," said Laura
Cameron, head of binding and fin
ishing. "The hope is that the new lo
cations will provide the same type of
academic experience that we have
now, but there is a fear that once we
move, that will go away.
"The move to Redwood City is a
big step for a lot of people," she
added, "especially those who have
been here for 20 or 30 years. All of a
sudden it's like, 'Here, welcome to
another city.'"
Cameron also said that supervi
sors are taking staff comments into
consideration.
The most contentious aspect of
the Meyer project, however, is the
break-up of the E ALand the disper
sion of its resources between Green
Library and SAL 3.
"We are all very upset about this,"
said an EAL librarian who asked to
remain anonymous out of concern
for his job security. "How can the

University continue to support East
Asian studies if they close the library
down? You'll have to depend on cat
aloguing, but sometimes it's so crap
py that you can't find anything.
"I feel somewhat distressed that
the head of our library is not making
a great enough stand for this collec
tion," added the librarian, referring
to the EAL's collection of Chinese,
Japanese and Korean texts.
With Meyer's replacement in the
preliminary stages, library adminis
trators and the Faculty Senate will
hold a town-hall meeting on Nov. 28
to initiate what Keller calls a "con
sultative process."
The meeting will be held in Room
290 of the Law School from 5:00 to
6:30 p.m.; seating is limited to the
first 186 persons.

sudden it's like, 'Here, welcome to
another city.'"
Cameron also said that supervi
sors are taking staff comments into
consideration.
The most contentious aspect of
the Meyer project, however, is the
break-up of the E ALand the disper
sion of its resources between Green
Library and SAL 3.
"We are all very upset about this,"
said an EAL librarian who asked to
remain anonymous out of concern
for his job security. "How can the

University continue to support East
Asian studies if they close the library
down? You'll have to depend on cat
aloguing, but sometimes it's so crap
py that you can't find anything.
"I feel somewhat distressed that
the head of our library is not making
a great enough stand for this collec
tion," added the librarian, referring
to the EAL's collection of Chinese,
Japanese and Korean texts.
With Meyer's replacement in the
preliminary stages, library adminis
trators and the Faculty Senate will
hold a town-hall meeting on Nov. 28
to initiate what Keller calls a "con
sultative process."
The meeting will be held in Room
290 of the Law School from 5:00 to
6:30 p.m.; seating is limited to the
first 186 persons.

Meyer Library, home of a 24-hour computer lab and an East Asia
collection, will be demolished within five years.
Meyer Library, many students' fa
vorite 24-hour study area and home
to seemingly endless numbers of
computers for the past 41 years, will
be gone by 2012, according to Uni
versity and library administrators.
The new seismic standards im
posed after the l l )8 l ) Loma Prieta
earthquake were one of many prob
lems plaguing the library. According
to Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82, the University has been upgrad
ing existing buildings that do not
meet the new standards, of which
Meyer is one such structure.
The cost of renovating the four
floor library, however, created an
other decision for the provost: up
grade Meyer or replace it?
"When we received estimates of
the cost of bringing Meyer up to
modern seismic standards, the cost
was over $40 million, and the needed
changes would make the building
even less attractive than it is today,"
Etchemendy wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Because of this, I decided

that instead of spending a huge
amount of money upgrading the
building, we should demolish it and
build a smaller, replacement library
for approximately the same cost."
While plans for the Meyer project
remain in their preliminary stages,
the building's eventual fate has al
ready been decided.
"Meyer Library is essentially
doomed," said Andrew Herkovic, di
rector of communications and devel
opment of libraries. "The building
has not aged very gracefully, it needs
millions of dollars worth of seismic
upgrades and it's not cost-effective
to keep it in the long term. It's also, in
my opinion, an eyesore."
A second reason for the library's
demolition is its violation of previous
plans for campus layout.
"The original campus master plan
wanted that area to be a corridor, not
a building," Herkovic said. "Today it
is very much in the way of traffic, and
it also stands out oddly as a building
larger than those around it. Architec
turally, that's considered a defect."
According to Herkovic, Meyer
will be demolished within five years,
and its smaller replacement will be
south of the current location. The
new downsized building, however,
will be unable to house the same re
sources that Meyer current accom
modates.
"The replacement building will
house the 'people' functions that are
currently in Meyer, including the
Academic Computing and student
study space," Etchemendy wrote,
"but it will not be a book storage fa
cility."
Meyer currently stores more than
520,000 books as part of the East
Asia Library (EAL). Those books,
along with those in the Green Li
brary stacks located underneath
Meyer, will need to be relocated.
"The EAL selectors and public
service staff and a portion of the
EAL collection will be relocated to
Green Library, resulting in the dis
placement of some Green Library
collections," wrote University Li
brarian Michael Keller in a public
letter. "Those displaced collections,
as well as the majority of the EAL
collection, will continue to be avail
able, but will be stored offsite at the
Stanford Auxiliary Library 3 (SAL 3)
in Livermore and available through
a paging service."
The University cannot construct
a new building to house displaced
books because of restrictions im
posed by the Santa Clara County
General Use Permit (GUP), which is
an agreement on how much Stanford
can expand its physical footprint on
the property it owns.
"The GUP is very political and
has many complex details, not unre
lated to the area's traffic burden,"
Herkovic said. "Even if we had all
the money in the world, we could not
use it to build infinitely. In fact we
can hardly build at all. It's sort of a
no-win situation."
The limitations imposed by the
GUP raise the question of whether it
will be books or people that are relo
cated.
"In effect, for every 75 square feet
we build to house books on campus,
we have to move another person to
an off-campus location,"
Etchemendy wrote. "I would rather
move rarely-used books and bring

them to campus when they're re
quested than move more staff or fac
ulty off campus."
"The library stacks are essentially
sacrificial lambs to the general cam
pus needs," Herkovic added.
Meyer staff not moved to the re
placement building on campus, how
ever, will have to be relocated to
Stanford North Campus in Red
wood City, according to Keller â€” a
prospect that raised concern among
third-floor Meyer employees.
"We know that space is a premi
um on campus," said Laura
Cameron, head of binding and fin
ishing. "The hope is that the new lo
cations will provide the same type of
academic experience that we have
now, but there is a fear that once we
move, that will go away.
"The move to Redwood City is a
big step for a lot of people," she
added, "especially those who have
been here for 20 or 30 years. All of a
sudden it's like, 'Here, welcome to
another city.'"
Cameron also said that supervi
sors are taking staff comments into
consideration.
The most contentious aspect of
the Meyer project, however, is the
break-up of the E ALand the disper
sion of its resources between Green
Library and SAL 3.

for his job security. "How can the
