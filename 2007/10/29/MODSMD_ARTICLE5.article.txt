# OSU SHUTS DOWN CARD

### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
CORVALLIS, Oregon — Fresh off
last week's road win against Arizona,
Stanford had high hopes coming into
Saturday's game at Oregon State. The
Beavers suppressed any of those
hopes, however, as they kept the Cardi
nal out of the end zone in a 23-6 victo
ry at Reser Stadium.
Stanford (3-5,2-4 Pacific-10) could
n't stretch its road record to 3-0 on the
year, falling to the punishing Beavers
(5-3,3-2 Pac-10) who held the Cardinal
to 181 total yards and -8 yards rushing.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback

Tavita Pritchard completed 16 of 32
passes for a career-high 189 yards, but
the Cardinal was plagued by an anemic
running game (just 32 yards from the
tailback position) and a thinned re
ceiving corps.
"I think that they are pretty darn
good They are right up there with (JSC
and Arizona State," said head coach
Jim Harbaugh about Oregon State's
defense. "I thought the defense played
well, and special teams, too. In the end,
we couldn't run the ball and we could
n't protect the passer well enough."
Oregon State opened the scoring on
its second drive, handing off to receiv
er James Rodgers on a sweep near

midfield. Rodgers followed blockers
down the sideline to the 2-yard line.
One play later,quarterback Sean Can
field bootlegged and found Howard
Croom open for a touchdown to give
Oregon State a 7-0 lead.
That would be all the Heavers need
ed. OSU added a 2-yard touchdown
run by Yvenson Bernard — the
Beavers' star running back — in the
second quarter to stretch the lead to 14-
0. Bernard left the field after the score
and did not return to the game. Matt
Sieverson stepped in and carried 16
times for a game-high 68 yards in his

and the rest of
Stanford's running
back corps were
grounded all
game against the
Beavers, as the
Cardinal finished
with -8 yards rush
ing. Stanford was
held to 181 total
yards and no
touchdowns in its
worst offensive
performance of the
year against a
tenacious Beaver
defense.
Stanford got on the board before
the half with two quick-strike drives
resulting in made field goals. Stan
ford rode 20 yards of Oregon State
penalties to move the ball 36 yards in
12 plays, culminating in Derek
Belch's 44-yard field goal with 2:16
remaining in the half. Oregon State
went three-and-out on the next pos
session, and Pritchard drove the Car
dinal 40 yards in six plays on the en
suing drive, completing all four of his
passes. Richard Sherman's 25-yard
catch put Belch in position for a man
ageable 43-yard field goal attempt,
which he nailed as time expired to
cut the deficit to 14-6 at halftime.
After kicking a field goal to go up
17-6, Oregon State got a big break
from the officials on Stanford's first
drive of the second half. As the Car
dinal receivers picked on Oregon
State's undersized cornerbacks —
including a 28-yard streak pattern to
senior wideout Evan Moore — OSU
corner Brandon Hughes pulled
Sherman down before the ball ar
rived on a Pritchard pass. There was
no penalty called on the play and
Stanford had to punt.
Harbaugh was blunt in his post
game quotes: "Their corners do a
nice job," he said. "They get away
with a lot of holding out there, but
they do a nice job."
The Cardinal's last good scoring
opportunity collapsed later in the
third quarter. After Stanford moved
from its own 31 to the Beaver 10,
Belch's 27-yard field goal attempt
was blocked by Derrick Doggett.
From there, Oregon State swallowed
up the Cardinal offensive attack, al
lowing only nine plays for 14 yards
and forcing four turnovers in the
fourth quarter.
For the game, Pritchard was
sacked five times, the Cardinal were
outgained 315-181 and the offensive
unit converted just one of 13 third
down attempts. The ferocious
Beaver defense came into the game
with a Pac-10 leading 28 sacks and
did not disappoint, blitzing from
every angle and forcing the Cardinal
line backwards regularly. Richard
Sherman led all receivers with 70
yards on three catches.
Stanford's defense, while making
a series of key stops in the second
half, was unable to force the second-

captain had seven tackles, o forced fumble, an intercep
tion and a blocked field goal, keying a defensive effort
that held Stanford to 181 yards of total offense.
PLAY OF THE GAME
Aftei failing to get into the end zone, Stanfoid lined up for
a 27-yard field goal trailing 17-6 late in the third quarter
The line collapsed under pressure, and Doggett burst
through to block Derek Belch's kick.
TURNING POINT
On the second Oregon State drive of the game, receivei
James Rodgers went in motion and took a sweep handoff
from quarterback Sean (anfield. He blew through two Car
dinal tacklers and rode the sideline down to the Stanford
2-yard line. Canfield threw a touchdown pass on the next
play, and the Beavers never looked back.
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT
The Cardinal defense hod six sacks on the day, two of them
coming from true freshman linebacker Chike Amajoyi. The
'D' also made several key second-half stops to keep Stan
ford in the game.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT
Four second-half turnovers (two fumbles, two intercep
tions) spelled doom for on offense missing three of its top
five tailbacks and playing with an injured Mark Bradford.

half turnovers that marked wins at
then-No. 2 Southern California and
at Arizona. Clinton Snyder (12 tack
les) and Pat Maynor (10 stops and a
sack) led a unit that sacked Canfield
six times. True freshman nickel line
backer Chike Amajoyi had two sacks.
The mental and physical toll of its
previous three games — decided by
a total of four points — seemed to
add up for Stanford, which played
with three running backs out with in
jury, a hobbled wide receiver (Mark
Bradford) and tailback (Jeremy
Stewart). As a whole, the team
lacked the urgency that marked im
pressive performances at USC and
Arizona.
The running game in particular
was grounded with Anthony Kimble,

Toby Gerhart and Jason Evans out.
Stewart (7 carries for 16 yards) and
Tyrone McGraw (4 rushes for 8
yards) shared the load, but could not
crack the Beaver defensive front.
"We really wanted to win this
game bad," said outside linebacker
Clinton Snyder. "We just need to
come back next week, have a good

week of practice and beat Washing
ton at home."
Oregon State kicker Alexis Serna
continued to add to his stellar career
statistics, converting three field goals
of 41. 31 and 41 yards and avenging
his late missed attempt two years ago
that sealed Stanford's 20-17 victory
in 2005.

After two straight road games, the
Cardinal returns home this Saturday,
facing Washington in a game the
team must win to keep its bowl hopes
alive. The game is scheduled to kick
off at 3:30 p.m.
