CORVALLIS, Oregon — Fresh off
last week's road win against Arizona,
Stanford had high hopes coming into
Saturday's game at Oregon State. The
Beavers suppressed any of those
hopes, however, as they kept the Cardi
nal out of the end zone in a 23-6 victo
ry at Reser Stadium.
Stanford (3-5,2-4 Pacific-10) could
n't stretch its road record to 3-0 on the
year, falling to the punishing Beavers
(5-3,3-2 Pac-10) who held the Cardinal
to 181 total yards and -8 yards rushing.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback

Tavita Pritchard completed 16 of 32
passes for a career-high 189 yards, but
the Cardinal was plagued by an anemic
running game (just 32 yards from the
tailback position) and a thinned re
ceiving corps.
"I think that they are pretty darn
good They are right up there with (JSC
and Arizona State," said head coach
Jim Harbaugh about Oregon State's
defense. "I thought the defense played
well, and special teams, too. In the end,
we couldn't run the ball and we could
n't protect the passer well enough."
Oregon State opened the scoring on
its second drive, handing off to receiv
er James Rodgers on a sweep near

midfield. Rodgers followed blockers
down the sideline to the 2-yard line.

Croom open for a touchdown to give
Oregon State a 7-0 lead.
That would be all the Heavers need
ed. OSU added a 2-yard touchdown
run by Yvenson Bernard — the
Beavers' star running back — in the
second quarter to stretch the lead to 14-
0. Bernard left the field after the score
and did not return to the game. Matt
Sieverson stepped in and carried 16
times for a game-high 68 yards in his
