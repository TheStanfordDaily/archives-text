October 29,1982: Students
flee damaged dorm
Trancos house residents were tem
porarily evacuated early this morning
after some students there noticed crack
ing and warping in bedroom walls.
Fire department officials told stu
dents to leave at 1:15 a.m. after making
a quick investigation and finding that
walls between rooms were bending. Al
though University officials allowed stu
dents to return to their rooms at 2:30,
the officials said they did not know what
had caused the bending of the walls.
Structural engineers will conduct fur
ther investigations today.
Capt. Jerry Davis, the senior fire de
partment at the scene, told The Daily
the decision to let residents return was
not a good one. "I wouldn't sleep in
there," Davis said.
Some students living on the first
floor returned to rooms in which walls
were cracked and noticeably bent. Said
one: "Maybe I'll move my bed into the
middle of the room." Walls in a number
of first-floor rooms were curved or
showed cracks. Accounts of how many
rooms were affected differed.
