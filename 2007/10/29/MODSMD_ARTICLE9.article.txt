## Determined transfer student pursues college degree after four children, thirty years 
### LUKE HENESY 
Around every corner of this campus, it seems,
a student is lurking, building their resume
so they can proceed to graduate school, se
cure a high-paying job, court a spouse and
finally settle down with children in order that they
may drudge through the entire rigamarole with sim
ilar success.
We're often under the impression that doing
these things out of order and allowing long amounts
of time to elapse between them will yield less-than
desirable results. C'arla Baku '09, however, is living
proof that when it comes to going through the col
lege process, there really is no "right way."
Baku, a native of Eureka, Calif., finished high
school about three decades ago with only vague no
tions of college, as neither of her parents earned de
grees and didn't offer her any assistance in that di
rection.Though she took a couple classes at the local
community college, Baku quit after only a few ses
sions, In short order.she was married, and education
dropped off her list of priorities.
Not until over a decade later did Baku consider
returning to the academic world, and only because a
long-time friend began taking classes after a similar
hiatus. As a mother of four at this point, the transi
tion back appeared daunting.
"It was a fight from the beginning, because my
husband at the time was extremely unsupportive,"
she said. "He had always been severely threatened
any time I made motions toward intellectual expres
sion. My four sons were still pretty young then, and
twice a week I had to orchestrate my departure for
class with serious strategizing."
To make matters worse, getting to class was not
even the toughest part. After having dinner pre
pared and bartering babysitting time with helpful
neighbors, when in the classroom itself Baku found
herself "so nervous that [she] could barely breathe."
"I relaxed after a couple of weeks, though, and
when I got an A in the class, I was on my way," she
said.

Four years later. Baku had divorced and moved
back to Eureka, but with a newfound vigor for ed
ucation. She got a job at a community college and
slowly began accumulating credits. Eleven years
flew by and Baku had remarried, taken a two-year
break from school and finally fulfilled all her re
quirements to transfer to a four-year school.
"When I registered for my last semester at Col
lege of the Redwoods, I knew 1 really needed to go
to school full time, [but] that was a financial impos
sibility," she said. "So I parked myself on the couch
with my laptop and announced that I needed to
find someone to pay me to go to school full time."
That's when Baku found the Jack Kent Cooke
Foundation, which offered an Undergraduate
Transfer Scholarship. After one of her professors
enthusiastically nominated her for this prestigious
scholarship. Baku was eventually selected as one of
two applicants to be sent on to the national compe
tition.
"Five long months later, I was treated to a sur
prise announcement in one of my classes letting me
know that 1 had won the scholarship "she said."l was
stunned!"
She then applied to several schools, all within a
day's drive of Eureka. Adding Stanford to her list
was an afterthought, but at the rate things had been
going for her, she felt no reservations about dream
ing big.
"In order to apply to Stanford I had to go back, at
the age of almost 50, and take the SAT at the same
local high school where I had chosen not to take it in
1975!" she said."l sat there with a whole lot of kids,
all of us clutching our No. 2 pencils, hoping for the
best. One little girl was so young, she didn't even
know her zip code."
Baku had been accepted to every school she ap
plied to, and was waiting to hear from Stanford — by
far the most competitive of her choices — before de
ciding where to go. She had read that on average
only 60 transfer students are admitted each year, and
