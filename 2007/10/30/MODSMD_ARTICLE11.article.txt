## Ten percent of high schools are 'dropout factories' 
### 
WASH INGTON (AP) — Its a
nickname no principal could be
proud of: "Dropout Factory," a high
school where no more than 60 per
cent of the students who start as
freshmen make it to their senior
year.
That dubious distinction applies
to more than one in 10 high schools
across America.
"If you're born in a neighborhood
or town where the only high school is
one where graduation is not the
norm, how is this living in the land of
equal opportunity?" asks Bob Bal
fanz. the researcher at Johns Hop
kins University who defines such a
school as a "dropout factory."
There are about 1.7(H) regular or
vocational high schools nationwide
that fit that description, according to
an analysis of Education Depart
ment data conducted by Johns I lop
kins for The Associated Press. That's

12 percent of all such schools, no
more than a decade ago but no less,
either.
While some of the missing stu
dents transferred, most dropped out.
Balfanz says. The data tracked senior
classes for three years in a row - 2004,
2005 and 2006 — to make sure local
events like plant closures weren't to
blame for the low retention rates.
The highest concentration of
dropout factories is in large cities or
high-poverty rural areas in the South
and Southwest. Most have high pro
portions of minority students. These
schools are tougher to turn around,
because their students face chal
lenges well beyond the academic
ones — the need to work as well as
go to school, for example, or a need
for social services.
Utah, which has low poverty rates
and fewer minorities than most
states, is the only state without a
dropout factory. Florida and South
Carolina have the highest percent
ages. About half of high schools in
those states classify as dropout facto
ries.
