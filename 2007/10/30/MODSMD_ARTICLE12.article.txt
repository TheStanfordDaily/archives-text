# Supreme Court to consider Exxon Valdez damages case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) _ The
Supreme Court agreed Monday to
decide whether Exxon Mobil Corp.
should pay $2.5 billion in punitive
damages to victims of the huge
Exxon Valdez oil spill that fouled
more than 1,200 miles of Alaskan
coastline in 1989.

The high court stepped into the
long-running battle over the dam
ages that Exxon Mobil owes from
the supertanker accident in Prince
William Sound that was the worst oil
spill in U.S. history. The Exxon
Valdez ran aground on a reef, crack
ing its hull and spilling 11 million gal
lons of oil.
Hundreds of thousands of
seabirds and marine animals died as
a result.
It is a case filled with superlatives.

The award, even after it was cut in
half by a federal appeals court in De
cember. would be the largest puni
tive damages judgment ever. A jury
in Alaska awarded $5 billion in dam
ages in 1994 and the company has
been appealing the verdict ever
since.
Arguing against Supreme Court
review, lawyers for the plaintiffs,
some of whom have died, said the
damages award is "barely more than
three weeks of Exxon's net profits."
