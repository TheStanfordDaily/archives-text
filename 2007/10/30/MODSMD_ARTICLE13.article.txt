## Editorial Board Email: The enemy of action? 
### 
Last Wednesday,The Daily's lead story,
"Students mobilize against racism,"
told of packed rooms and impas
sioned discussions. Nearly 50 students gath
ered in El Centro Chicano to discuss the
legacy of institutional racism in the wake of
recent events in Jena, La. In light of the full
turnout at the event, entitled "Modern-Day
Lynching: A Look into the Horror," and the
news coverage that it received, readers may
be surprised to know that some students op
posed the staging of the conversation.
Toward the end of the discussion, one or
ganizer read from emails he had received
criticizing the publicity of the event. A
stunned silence swept over the room as at
tendees listened to a sample of the critical
emails: "Aren't you blowing this out of pro
portion?" read one. "When six people gang
up on one how can you say [the black
teenagers responding to nooses hung at
their school] were lynched?" read another.
Diverse as the participants in the Jena-6
conversation were, those in the room in
some way or another had come to under
stand the potent symbolism of nooses and
the injustice of the trials that followed.
This is not an editorial about the self-se
lecting nature of activism events; last week's
event should not be understood as catering
to a narrow or close-minded group. In fact,
the opposite was true — an incredibly het
erogeneous mix of individuals attended
"Modern-Day Lynching." It is safe to say,
however, that everyone present was indig
nant about the negative comments in the
emails. These comments were striking not
only because they were severely out of
touch with the moral outrage of those in the
room, but also because such callous and in
sensitive comments were delivered via
email — an unconstructive and noncom
mittal medium — which made these criti
cisms exponentially more obnoxious.
Cranky, condemning emails from stu
dents who are just passionate enough in
their opinions to disapprove of what others
have worked hard to create are a phenome
non that is familiar to most campus groups.
In the interest of full disclosure, the Editori
al Board receives emails and comments on
its Web site, and, while many are construc
tive, others are of the sort condemned in this

editorial. Emails are quick, easy, noncom
mittal, non-confrontational and satisfying
for the sender.
These traits make email a perfect vehicle
for facile criticisms such as the ones outlined
above which allow critics to publicize their
contempt while eliminating their obligation
to weigh and consider other opinions. These
pseudo-critics consider their beliefs impor
tant enough to whip up a quick email but
often do not have enough conviction to en
gage in a conversation. Such emails can be
tedious and cowardly. They seem to be writ
ten solely for the self-gratification of the
senders, who will take a two-second shot at a
project that others have poured far more
time into creating, but who are not invested
enough in an issue to offer constructive ad
vice, engage in genuine discourse or mobi
lize action of their own.
The absence of face-to-face contact or
real-time responses in electronic debates
makes it simple for critics to get in their jab
and then check out of the conversation be
fore being forced to engage with con
tenders. When forums for genuine two
sided conversations can occur on topics as
controversial as Rumsfeld's appointment to
the Hoover Institution and as comical as the
dinosaur cartoon theme of Kimball Hall, it is
extremely disappointing that cursory elec
tronic criticism remains a fact of life, and
particularly troubling that it was used in re
sponse to last week's forum on the Jena-6.
From a moral standpoint, criticisms
launched against a panel for discussing
Jena-6 stand out amongst the crowds of un
constructive critical emails as particularly
odious. It is a pity that students who hold
skeptical views about the moral implica
tions of Jena-6, an event that has provoked
one of the largest civil justice marches in
years, are satisfied to criticize from the side
lines instead of taking to time to engage in
the debate that they criticize.
While genuine criticism can add meaning
and depth to campus life, questioning the
need or importance of a panel discussing
Jena-6 without taking the time to engage in
those discussions is an action that embodies
the ignorance and institutional racism that
we praised the organizers and participants
of the Jena-6 panel for fighting.
