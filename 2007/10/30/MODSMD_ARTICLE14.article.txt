## Let them eat pie 
### 
Food for Peace, the U.S. Agency for Inter
national Development-run foreign food
aid program, sounds like a win-win situ
ation if I ever heard one. After all. certain
celebrities aside, who doesn't like food? And.
most politicians aside, who's got a thing
against peace?
Indeed, everything seems quite cheery:
I"he government buys domestically grown
food, gives it to private aid organizations and
pays American shippers to ship the stuff to
impoverished countries. The government, its
public image glistening, is happy. The farmers
are happy. The aid organizations are happy.
The shippers are happy. On second thought,
it's not just win-win: it's win-win-win-win!
Wait, did I forget something? Govern
ment...farmers...aid organizations...ship
pers...oh right, impoverished countries. But
aren't they winning, too?
Yes. they are. But they aren't winning
enough. In 2000, they "won" 5.3 million met
ric tons of food. In 2005, it was 4 million. This
year, it's 2.4 million. At this rate, our
bioethanol-hungry selves will be snatching
corn from the hands of the world's hungry by
the end of the decade.
Regardless of future blackmail opportuni
ties, the present state of affairs is bleak. With
food and fuel prices steadily rising, the costs of
buying food and getting it overseas have crip
pled the food aid program. In 2002, we provid
ed f(K)d for 105 million people. By last year,
that number had decreased to 70 million. Ac
cording to the United Nations, there are still
over 850 million starving people in the world
today, and that number is not decreasing.
Shipping American food around the world
as is stipulated by current law wastes money
and time. Dumping American food on the
heads of foreign farmers debilitates local agri
culture. The solution has long been apparent:
Use the food aid budget to buy food from
poor foreign farmers (instead of using Amer
ican commodities to deprive them of their
livelihoods). You don't have to be a Stanford
student to figure this out; the Bush adminis
tration came up with it two years ago. suggest
ing that during crisis situations, up to $300 mil
lion of the $1.3 billion food aid budget be
available to buy food locally instead of ship
ping it there.
Yet, Congress has been all too willing to let

Bush take the moral high ground.consistent
ly killing his proposal for the past two years.
The farm bill, which is up for Congressional
reauthorization every five years, was passed
by the House in late July. It made plenty of ad
ditions to existing agricultural subsidies but
didn't touch food aid.
Bush's proposal was finally resurrected as
a pilot program on Thursday, when the Senate
Agricultural Committee approved its version
of the farm bill. While the idea is the same, the
scope is microscopic: Instead of $30() million,
the committee approved $25 million per year
for the new program. But even this policy,
which would have affected less than 2 percent
of the food aid budget, was immediately and
forcefully denigrated by agribusiness and
shipping interests.The farm bill, with the food
aid reform proposal included, is up for debate
in the Senate next week. With industry' inter
ests screaming at Washington (as usual) and
the starving poor silent (as usual), one can
only hope that policymakers keep their ears
closed and listen to their consciences.
When President John F. Kennedy named
the Food for Peace program in 1%1,he said.
"Food is strength, and food is peace, and food
is freedom, and food is a helping to people
around the world whose good will and friend
ship we want."That may be true, but it would
be imprudent of us to forget that food is food.
The purpose of food is to feed people, not
America's ego. Whether through exposure to
Keynesian economics or negotiation cliches,
we've fallen in love with the expanding pie
theory: If you grow the pie, then everyone gets
a larger piece of it. From closely observing the
waistlines of many Americans, 1 have come to
a conclusion. We don't need more pie. We
don't need to win. or win-win-win-win. In
deed. maybe the right thing to do would be to
lose: Lose our money, lose the support of do
mestic agribusiness and shippers, and buy
food abroad from farmers who could really
use the money for people who could really
use the food. And maybe we could remember
that losing once had a kinder, nobler name:
Giving.
