# Fish Out of Water
## I can read your mind (no, really) 
### 
According to a 2006 poll in Oklahoma,
college seniors and grad students are
8 to 11 percent more likely to believe
in psychic phenomena than their counter
part college freshmen. And after three years
of little dating, less sex and no happiness, 1
need all the psychic phenomena I can get.
With this in mind. I decided to give this
whole psychic thing a shot and signed up for
a local Psychic Development, Practice &
Growth class last weekend.
Entering the living room of a Palo Alto
home on Sunday, I was met by various new
age decorations, but smelled trouble when I
saw the group of disappointingly average
looking students. One of them was even
wearing (gasp!) a cable-knit sweater and
puffy vest.
To my relief, Cable-Knit Girl et al. were
actually from the previous "advanced" class
and soon padded out to be replaced by F., a
relatively large, barefoot, middle-aged man,
who wanted to try to manage his "altered
state."
F.'s gloriousness was trumped only by
that of the instructor, the Rev. Maxi herself.

A self-proclaimed "Starseed." whose array
of talents includes Multidimensional Chan
neling and an understanding of 64 Galactic
Race Dialectic Languages, Maxi was
dressed to the nines in a star- and moon
printed tie-dye turquoise pajama set. She
accessorized with bright jewelry, a zebra
print headband and hot-pink nail and toe
polish.
In a set of diagnostic exercises, Maxi first
had F. and I test our "other dimensional
sight" to see how far our vision extended be
yond our "frontal reality cones." While any
exercise that involves the word "other" in
quotation marks has to be at least some
what exciting, this one didn't stray far from
testing our peripheral vision. 1 was relieved

when we moved on to the more exotic disci
pline of mapping auric fields.
Taking turns as the auric field tester, !•'.
and I were told to briskly rub our hands
until a white shape appeared in the center of
our palms. Standing a few feet away from
the testee. the tester would gently push his
hands towards the testee's back, head and
chest, successively, until he noticed sensa
tions of warmth or tingling in his palms and
fingers.
According to Maxi, the auras emanating
from my own body were characteristically
low-pressure and did not extend all that far
out.Translation from Galactic Race Dialec
tic Language #37: my auras, like me,are also
uptight, repressed and from New England.
Especially alarming to Maxi were the
weak auras flowing in through my backside.
"You may not be getting enough love," she
said, shaking her head sadly at me.
Hmm... good thing New England has
more to it than just unrequited love, J. Crew
and Puritanism — the Salem witches, for
