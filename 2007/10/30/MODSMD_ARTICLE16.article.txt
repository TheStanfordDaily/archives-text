# Fish Out of Water
## I can read your mind (no, really) 
### 
According to a 2006 poll in Oklahoma,
college seniors and grad students are
8 to 11 percent more likely to believe
in psychic phenomena than their counter
part college freshmen. And after three years
of little dating, less sex and no happiness, 1
need all the psychic phenomena I can get.
With this in mind. I decided to give this
whole psychic thing a shot and signed up for
a local Psychic Development, Practice &
Growth class last weekend.
Entering the living room of a Palo Alto
home on Sunday, I was met by various new
age decorations, but smelled trouble when I
saw the group of disappointingly average
looking students. One of them was even
wearing (gasp!) a cable-knit sweater and
puffy vest.
To my relief, Cable-Knit Girl et al. were
actually from the previous "advanced" class
and soon padded out to be replaced by F., a
relatively large, barefoot, middle-aged man,
who wanted to try to manage his "altered
state."
F.'s gloriousness was trumped only by
that of the instructor, the Rev. Maxi herself.

A self-proclaimed "Starseed." whose array
of talents includes Multidimensional Chan
neling and an understanding of 64 Galactic
Race Dialectic Languages, Maxi was
dressed to the nines in a star- and moon
printed tie-dye turquoise pajama set. She
accessorized with bright jewelry, a zebra
print headband and hot-pink nail and toe
polish.
In a set of diagnostic exercises, Maxi first
had F. and I test our "other dimensional
sight" to see how far our vision extended be
yond our "frontal reality cones." While any
exercise that involves the word "other" in
quotation marks has to be at least some
what exciting, this one didn't stray far from
testing our peripheral vision. 1 was relieved

when we moved on to the more exotic disci
pline of mapping auric fields.
Taking turns as the auric field tester, !•'.
and I were told to briskly rub our hands
until a white shape appeared in the center of
our palms. Standing a few feet away from
the testee. the tester would gently push his
hands towards the testee's back, head and
chest, successively, until he noticed sensa
tions of warmth or tingling in his palms and
fingers.
According to Maxi, the auras emanating
from my own body were characteristically
low-pressure and did not extend all that far
out.Translation from Galactic Race Dialec
tic Language #37: my auras, like me,are also
uptight, repressed and from New England.
Especially alarming to Maxi were the
weak auras flowing in through my backside.
"You may not be getting enough love," she
said, shaking her head sadly at me.
Hmm... good thing New England has
more to it than just unrequited love, J. Crew
and Puritanism — the Salem witches, for



Courtney
Weaver
example, to whom 1 probably owe
Maxi's glowing praise for my, ahem,
"natural sense of intuition," and in
herent "knowingness."
Unfortunately, these were two
talents that F. could not boast of.
But we should really start refer
ring to F. in Starseed terms. You see,
F. was what Maxi calls a CM: Cos
mic Masturbator. Traditional edu
cators would describe CM's behav
ior as that of an attention-seeker
who doesn't listen and disrupts the
flow of class. Maxi characterized
CM's behavior as the result of a bi
ological warfare between good and
evil, occurring within the cosmic
battlefield of his body.
"You are all head and no heart,"
Maxi told him at one point, and
then later responded to a classically
self-absorbed CM-ism with a blunt
"That's evil."
Granted, the guy was definitely
weird. And his claims of being able
to read strangers' minds and score
perfectly on standardized tests were
a tad on the creepy side. Still, no one
likes to see a grown man troubled
by internal intergalactic forces.

At one point during Maxi's mer
ciless exorcist rant, CM turned to
me to look for sympathy and said he
could just tell that we had both
come to the class for the same rea
son: our mutual psychic longings.
Maxi quickly deflated such hopes
by saying the psychic message he
had just received was, in fact, a re
sult of my own effectively con
structed psychic defense system,
which had reflected CM's thoughts
off of me, back onto himself.
While no one likes to see a verbal
beating, let alone a psychic one, it
was clear that my own psychic suc
cess was inextricably tied to CM's
downfall. I decided from then on to
let Maxi do all the talking, because,
let's face it: love from Maxi was the
only kind I had gotten in a while.
At the end of the class. Maxi told
me that next week I could move on
to the advanced group. When she
added that my energy levels were
similar to one girl's in particular. I
had the sneaking suspicion that she
could only be referring to the one in
the cable-knit sweater.
Maybe my psychic skills aren't
so bad after all.
