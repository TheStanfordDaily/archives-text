# Pleading Inanity
## Hanging out 
### 
Before we start today. I'd like to bid a
fond farewell to my editor, Jackie
Bernstein. For the past three weeks,
the only time Jackie wasn't being a good ed
itor was when she was being a great editor,
and I am genuinely sad that we won't have
the entire year to collaborate. Gerry Shih,
you have big shoes to fill, my friend.
Last weekend, frats. professional schools
and communities around the US celebrated
pagan hedonism by clothing their real
selves, imbibing until they forgot who they
were and trying to hook up with people they
hoped to never know. Welcome to Hal
loween, rest of the world: Another great
American tradition that we'll soon be ex
porting.
This year, I had promised myself that I'd
do something more creative than the past
three, for which my costumes entailed, re
spectively, putting a white sheet over my
head and calling myself a ghost, getting real
ly drunk and calling myself a dipsomaniac.

and not shaving for a week and calling my
self a werewolf. So, one full week in advance,
I made my way to a store in the glory that is
Palo Alto with a promising moniker: Hal
loween Costume Shop.
Once inside. I was confronted with an
array of possibilities for my brand new for-a
night-or-two alter ego. Should I explore my
superhero side as the Silver Surfer? Should I
explore my Caucasian infant side as Stewie
from The Family Guy? Or should I explore
my cherry-flavored mixed drink side as a
large, anthropomorphic, frosty pitcher of
Kool-Aid?

Then. I saw it.and it saw me: a Lieutenant
Dangle costume. For those of you who don't
know. I t. James "Jim" Ron Dangle is the
highest-ranking deputy on Comedy Cen
tral's brilliant COPS parody Reno l )ll!
Other than being a huge fan of the show —
and an even more ardent fan of the cast's
previous work on MTV's sketch-comedy
show The State — Dangle s character was
perfect for me because of his trademark
shorts, which might be better described as
hot pants. I speculate that his name derives
from these shorts, as they are constituted in
such a way that, without proper precaution,
something might just "dangle" out.
After I got home. I raced to suit up and
put on a one-person fashion show for myself.
I found the badge and proaudly donned it,
found the gloves and Velcroed them on
tight, but then hit a bit of a snafu, one piece
of my costume appeared to be some sort of
