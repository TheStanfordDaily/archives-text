## DOWN THE STRETCH Women capture Pac-10 title; men finish second 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
l"hings couldn't have gone much better for
Stanford cross country this past weekend: the
women captured their 12th straight Pac-10
title while the men finished in second place at
the Pac-10 Championships held in Corvallis,
Ore.
I"he women's star performance was turned
in by senior Arianna Lambie, who won the
event's individual championship for the third
straight year with a time of 19:40.7. Lambie is
one of just two runners in Pac-10 history to ac
complish such a feat.
"it's quite an honor to be only one of two
women to do that," Lambie said. "But it was
even more fun to be running with my team
mate (Teresa McWalters) â€” we actually tied
for the one and they had to give it to one of us.
It was pretty cool."
As Lambie mentioned, the No. 1 Stanford
women were also bolstered by the perform
ance of senior Teresa McWalters, who official
ly finished a half-second behind Lambie. Se
nior Lauren Centrowitz added to the effort,
finishing 10th overall with her mark of
20:27.1.
"It was a pretty inspiring performance
across the board." McWalters said.
"I was really proud of them," Lambie said
of her teammates. "We knew could do it. We'd
been getting excited all week. When the time
came, they just stepped up."

Although the men did not have as impres
sive a weekend as the women, they were
happy with their performance, as the team
came in second place to the nation's best in
Oregon.
Senior Russell Brown finished in third
place overall, clocking in with a time of
23:08.7. Junior Hari Mix was second for the
Cardinal with his 23:11.6 mark, while senior
Neftalem Araia finished sixth overall for the
event at 23:12.1.
Ultimately, though, the No. 15 men were
simply outmatched against the No. 1 Oregon
squad that took first place. Stanford finished
with 55 points while Oregon won the event
with a low 39.
With another Pac-10 title under their belts,
the women are just two more competitions
away from capturing their third straight na
tional title. Hie NCAA West Regional Cham
pionships will be held Eugene. Ore., in two
weeks; a week after, the national champi
onships in Terre Haute, Ind., take place.
Things are looking better than ever as the
team heads down the home stretch.
"1 think the momentum's all positive com
ing off of the Pac-10 Championships," Lambie
said. "Training's going well. We've been at
these championships and done well before.
We feel like we can do whatever challenge
faces us."
"We've been doing this for a while now."
McWalters added. "We're just about keeping
our cool. Even though we've done it [won na

tional titles] twice before, it doesn't get any
less sweet."
Despite their well-founded confidence, the
women are aware of the effort it will take to
bring home a third straight national champi
onship.

"It's something that few people have the
opportunity to go after, and I'd like to make
the most of it, do everything I can to get it,"
Lambie said. "That's all we're doing. We're
