Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actual
strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they could beat
the team below them.

1. Ohio Stale 1 Haven't lost a regular season game in two years. Quietly the top program of
this decade.
2. ISU 2 Need to win out with style — lost any chance at a quality win in the SEC Title
game.
3. Oregon 7 Final BCS slot between two teams previously passed over (Oregon in '01, LSU in
'03)?
4. Oklahoma 3 Texas and Nebraska's struggles stealing the spotlight from a pretty good sea
son in Norman.
5. West Virginia 9 Cream is rising to the top in the Big East. 'Eers hitting their stride when it mat
ters most.
6. Michigan 8 Spotted Minnesota 10, but Blue was missing Henne and Hart — and won run
ning away.
7. 5 Maybe Leinart and Bush mattered more than we thought? Injuries killing 'SC this
year.
8. Boston College 17 8-0 because of their "D," but Matt Ryan's the Heisman leader with two last
second TDs at VT.
9. r orida 4 Defense? What defense? Allowed 42 to Georgia, 20-plus the last seven weeks.
10. Arizona State 13 Traditional Pac-10 choke artists: Arizona State, Washington State. Now: UCLA,
Col.
11. Missouri 10 "D" was already a question before star safety Brown tore his Achilles last week
end.
12. Virginia Tech 6 Virginia loss keeps Hokies in ACC Coastal driver's seat. Find an "0" before the
BC rematch.
13. Alabama 14 Good week for a bye. Win vs. LSU this week and SEC West is theirs to lose.
14. Georgia 23 Whoa, Mark Richt has an offense? Favorite name ever: RB Knowshon Moreno.
15. Texas 11 Have played poorly in all but two games. This is the year for Big 12 rivals to
knock them off.
16. Kansas 20 First 8-0 start (and favorites vs. Nebraska this week) since 1909. D allows 10
per game.
17. Auburn 18 Have won five of last six.
18. Tennessee NR Near the top of the SEC East. Barf. Thought the SEC could compete with the NFC
West
19. Purdue NR Only losses to Ohio State and Michigan.
20. California 12 Missouri-Kansas will have more BCS implications than Cal-USC Who'd have
guessed that?
21. Wisconsin 25 Qushed Indiana, but star RB Hill injured. Not good with Michigan coming up.
22. Wake Forest MR Defending ACC champs buried behind BC in standings, but have won six
straight.
23. Hawaii 21 Stuck between 20 and 25. Undefeated record keeps them from going any
lower, lock of "D" any higher
24. Connecticut NR Just one of those years (see Ohio State, 2002) where every bounce falls your
way.
25. (lemson NR Scored 100 over lost two Also considered: South Carolina, Kentucky, Penn
State, Virginia
