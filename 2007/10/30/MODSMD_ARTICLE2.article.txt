## Campus bikers without lights face ticketing Some students report police stops and fines for cycling in the dark 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
After The Daily reported two weeks ago that police
would be more strictly enforcing the penalties for hiking
with headphones or through stop signs, students last week
also found themselves worrying about bike lights — and
facing fines for missing the requisite headlight during a
nighttime ride.
Stanford police said the phenomenon is not due to any
specific change in enforcement.
"We do this every year," said Sergeant Del Bandy. "The
policy is always in place campus-wide. We focus on crucial
intersections for directed enforcement — spending time
at one place, focusing on one violation. We also make sure
to choose places where it's safe to pull students over."
In keeping with the police strategy, students reported
tickets mostly around crucial lines of traffic, such as on
Santa Teresa Street between Tresidder Union and Roble
Hall on West Campus and at the intersection of Serra
Street and Arguello Way on East Campus.
"I've heard of a lot of people being pulled over," said
Geoffrey Woo, a graduate student in physics and comput
er science."There are cops camped out at specific spots. It
seems like they're cracking down."
ITie current enforcement has met with criticism from
some students.
"It's an inconsistent policy," said Jireh Tan '11. "I think
it's important, but I'm not sure if I agree with the principle
of how it's enforced. If the goal is to get everyone on cam
pus to get a bike light, then random tickets in West Lag isn't
going to do it."
C)ther students saw little reason to worry.
"When I was pulled over, it wound up being just a $5
ticket," said Xuchen Zhang' 10. "1 think the policy is fine.
It's the law."
