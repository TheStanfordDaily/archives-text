### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team completed a
strong weekend of tennis on Sunday at the Chan
dler Cup, highlighted by senior Phil Kao's return to
the court after a year hiatus. Kao made his season
debut with a victory over Bryan Pybas of UC-Santa
Cruz, 6-4, 7-6. The match was Kao's first in over a
year due to injury, and the senior made the most of
his return to the court.
"It felt great to be competing again," said Kao."l
definitely was a little nervous playing my first
match, but getting the first win helped me build
some much needed confidence."
Kao did not advance further in the bracket, how
ever, losing in three sets to Bijan Moiallemi of UC-
San Diego, 6-4.2-6,6-1. Ihe three-set match pushed
Kao to the limit, but he did not feel overmatched.
"Although I lost my match in three sets, I did not
feel tired during or after the match," he said. "I am
definitely back in shape to compete."
"It was nice to see Phil back on the court," said
head coach John Whitlinger.'i was happy with what

he did out there â€” he hit the ball well and moved
well. I was encouraged by what I saw."
Freshman Greg Hirshman lost his opening
round match but put a string of wins together to
reach the semifinals of the consolation bracket. Hir
shman's run ended there when he lost to Jeevan Ne
dunchezhiyan of Washington, 6-3,6-1.
"Greg did a good job in the consolation matches
he played," said Whitlinger. He beat a very good
player from Boise State along the way. For him it's
just about getting better and stronger. He's a fight
er."
Sophomore Kevin Kaiser also advanced to the
second round, earning a straight sets victory over
David Gonzalez of University of the Pacific in the
first. He later fell to Kiryl Harbatsiuk of Sacramen
to State, 6-2,6-4, in the second round.
Hirshman and Kaiser also teamed up for dou
bles and had an impressive opening round victory.
They beat Jacek Twarowski and Stefan Nikolic of
Loyola Marymount 8-0. However, the duo ran into
the second-seeded team of Nedunchezhiyan and
Andy Koharsky from Washington in the second
round and lost, 8-6.
It still was a good tournament for the players,
who played well while also gaining valuable experi
ence.
"Every match they play is another way I get to
see what [the players] need to work
on, and what (the players] see they
need to work on." Whitlinger said.
Kao is encouraged about his per
formance and wants to use this as a
springboard to the rest of the season.
" Ihe results have given me a
good idea of where I am in competi
tion play," he said. "My game still
needs some work,but by the time the
season starts I will be ready."
The Cardinal men are back in ac
tion this Thursday when they travel
to the National Indoor Champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio. It will be
the last fall preseason tournament
before the regular season starts in
January.
