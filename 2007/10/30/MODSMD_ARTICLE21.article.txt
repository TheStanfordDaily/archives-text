## Luck is on Stanford's side 
### 
The ball is on the opponent's
46-yard line.The quarterback,
in shotgun formation,receives
the snap at his own 48. He takes a
standard three-step drop, looking,
but not finding, any open receivers.
He steps up into the pocket, where
the right defensive end, who has
evaded his blocker, is waiting for
him. The quarterback scrambles
right, only to have the left defensive
end lunge at his feet. The quarter
back spins, losing his shoe in the
process.
He continues running toward the
right sideline, the right defensive end
in hot pursuit. Just as the defender
leaps to make his tackle, and just be
fore a linebacker hits him in the chest,
the quarterback unleashes a bomb
from his own 45-yard line, which
passes over the outstretched hands of
a defensive back and lands in the
arms of his receiver, who walks the
extra three yards into the end zone.
On this, the final play of the half,
Stratford High School quarterback
Andrew Luck shows off some of the
qualities that make him a top-five
quarterback recruit: poise in the
pocket, mobility, accuracy and arm
strength.
The best part about it? He's com
ing to Stanford in the fall: the crown
jewel of coach Jim Harbaugh's yet
to-be-completed first recruiting
class.
In a press release this June, Luck
said that he committed to Stanford in
part because he believes "that coach
Harbaugh and his staff will get the
Cardinal football program headed in
the right direction."
At the time, it was certainly a leap
of faith — this was before the
"Biggest Upset Ever," and the Cardi
nal was coming off a historically ter
rible season. Yet, Luck saw then what
many Stanford faithful see now: Har
baugh's intensity, his refusal to ac
cept defeat and his subsequent will
ingness to do everything he can to
win.
He will go as far as switching play
ers' positions to build a more cohe
sive and competitive team. Case in
point: true freshman Chike Amajoyi
came to Stanford as a running back
prospect — the position that is, by
his own admission, more comfort
able for him — even though he
played both ways in high school.
Harbaugh made him a linebacker,
and the move is already paying divi
dends: Amajoyi is a key part of the
defensive rotation and an occasional
starter who had two sacks against
Oregon State on Saturday.
This win-at-all-costs mentality is
new to Stanford — Harbaugh's
predecessor, Walt Harris, punted on
third down (the ultimate give-up
play) on multiple occasions — and
