## Luck is on Stanford's side 
### 
The ball is on the opponent's
46-yard line.The quarterback,
in shotgun formation,receives
the snap at his own 48. He takes a
standard three-step drop, looking,
but not finding, any open receivers.
He steps up into the pocket, where
the right defensive end, who has
evaded his blocker, is waiting for
him. The quarterback scrambles
right, only to have the left defensive
end lunge at his feet. The quarter
back spins, losing his shoe in the
process.
He continues running toward the
right sideline, the right defensive end
in hot pursuit. Just as the defender
leaps to make his tackle, and just be
fore a linebacker hits him in the chest,
the quarterback unleashes a bomb
from his own 45-yard line, which
passes over the outstretched hands of
a defensive back and lands in the
arms of his receiver, who walks the
extra three yards into the end zone.
On this, the final play of the half,
Stratford High School quarterback
Andrew Luck shows off some of the
qualities that make him a top-five
quarterback recruit: poise in the
pocket, mobility, accuracy and arm
strength.
The best part about it? He's com
ing to Stanford in the fall: the crown
jewel of coach Jim Harbaugh's yet
to-be-completed first recruiting
class.
In a press release this June, Luck
said that he committed to Stanford in
part because he believes "that coach
Harbaugh and his staff will get the
Cardinal football program headed in
the right direction."
At the time, it was certainly a leap
of faith — this was before the
"Biggest Upset Ever," and the Cardi
nal was coming off a historically ter
rible season. Yet, Luck saw then what
many Stanford faithful see now: Har
baugh's intensity, his refusal to ac
cept defeat and his subsequent will
ingness to do everything he can to
win.
He will go as far as switching play
ers' positions to build a more cohe
sive and competitive team. Case in
point: true freshman Chike Amajoyi
came to Stanford as a running back
prospect — the position that is, by
his own admission, more comfort
able for him — even though he
played both ways in high school.
Harbaugh made him a linebacker,
and the move is already paying divi
dends: Amajoyi is a key part of the
defensive rotation and an occasional
starter who had two sacks against
Oregon State on Saturday.
This win-at-all-costs mentality is
new to Stanford — Harbaugh's
predecessor, Walt Harris, punted on
third down (the ultimate give-up
play) on multiple occasions — and
recruits are taking note. Already,
1 larbaugh has landed Luck, ranked
the fifth-best quarterback in the
country by the recruiting service
Scout.com; center David DeCastro,
ranked third at his position; and the
top punter recruit. Matt Zubyk,
among others. 1 le has also signed his
main target, speedy and sure-hand
ed wide receiver Chris Owusu.
For the first time in years, Stanford
is seriously competing with other
Pac-10 schools for players. The Farm
is still a potential destination for top
recruits such as cornerback Jarred
Holley and running backs Sausan
Shakerin and Covaughn Deboskie.
Unspoken in this process is the
added difficulty for Cardinal coach
es to recruit players: not only do they
have to convince athletes to come to
a program in a rebuilding phase, but
thev also have to make sure that

each player has the grades to he ad
mitted to Stanford. Unlike almost
every other Division 1 school, Stan
ford refuses to disregard academic
standards for athletes.
Placed in a near impossible situa
tion, Harbaugh and his staff have
done a remarkable job. The current
team is still bowl eligible andean add
to its win total against a slew of beat
able opponents in the coming weeks.
When the Cardinal beat I SC. the
team thrust itself back into the na
tional spotlight amidst cries of
"Stanford football is back!"from the
faithful. And now, with the additions
of Luck and company, the Cardinal
has placed itself in a position to be
competitive for years to come.
Ihis rapid turnaround has been
stunning to witness. But, then again,
we should have seen this coming;
after all, Harbaugh is known as
"Captain Comeback."
