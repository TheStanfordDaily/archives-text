### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 4 Stanford rounded out a busy weekend
at home with an 11-7 win over No. 5 Pepperdine
on Sunday after losing 9-7 at home to No. 9 UC-

Santa Barbara on Saturday. After last weekend,
the Cardinal now has a record of 10-6 overall
and 2-3 in the MPSF.
"The main reason we lost [against Santa
Barbara] was just inconsistency. We weren't
making reliable passes, we were struggling in

the goal and, at the end of the game when we
created some opportunities to score, we didn't
put them away," said senior two-meter/defend
er Peter Finlayson. "They played really well,
and we didn't play really well at a high level."
Stanford began strongly against UCSB as
sophomore driver Sage Wright started the scor
ing with a goal. Senior two-meter/defender
Ryan Fortune's quick score followed right
after. UCSB responded with a goal by Ross Sin
clair at 3:07. but Wright gave Stanford a 3-1 lead
as he netted a goal with under 27 seconds to
play in the quarter.
The Gauchos immediately played their at
tacking game with two scores within the six
minute mark of the next quarter, tying the score
at 3-3. An error from the UCSB goalie allowed
freshman driver Cody Wiesen to pounce on a
scoring opportunity, giving Stanford a narrow
lead 4-3 at the half.
In the second half, Stanford's stringent de
fense collapsed as the Gauchos scored three
quick goals.
I reshman driver Alex Pulido and junior
driver Andrew Drake both scored later, howev
er, evening things up at 6-6. From that point on.
though. UCSB held the Cardinal to just one
goal. The Gauchos stepped up on the offensive
end and clamped down defensively to win the
game, 9-7.
"Andrew Drake has been playing very well,
he's been stepping it up," Wright said. "Every
one at practice really helps us a lot because we
play well in practice."

for the weekend, beating No. 5 Pepperdine after losing to No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara.
Center on Sunday for a game against
Pepperdine. and, this time, they suc
cessfully snapped their three-game
conference losing streak. Drac and
Janson Wigo scored two goals each,
and Drake performed brilliantly of
fensively with a hat trick to lead the
team to an 11-7 victory.
"[We| pressed on defense. Both
teams have pretty good shooters, so
the opportunities came on the
counter attacks," Janson Wigo ex
plained. "[l] play utility which plays
guard, two-meter man [and] driver,
so it's important to be able to play
position."
In the first quarter, goals from
senior two-meter/offense Michael
Bury and Drac Wigo opened up the
scoring at 2-1. Within the five
minute mark of the second quarter,
Janson Wigo and Drake extended
the lead to 4-1. Stanford's offensive
streak continued with a pair of goals
from Wright and sophomore two
meter/offense Ryan McCarthy. The
Cardinal stretched its lead to 10-5 in
the fourth and went on to win rather
easily, 11-7.
"This last win over Pepperdine
was really good for us — they've
beaten a lot of good teams, and
they've played a lot of teams really
close, so the win restored our confi

dence," Finlayson said. "Hopefully,
we'll build our momentum for
MPSF games. It's crunch time now.
so we're taking the rest of the season
game-by-game, and each practice is
an opportunity to get better."
