# Wrestle-offs display Card's potential
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling squad took
a big step toward setting its starting
lineup in place for the season on Sat
urday, as the team held its annual in
trasquad Wrestle-Offs in Burnham
Pavilion. Overall, Stanford coach
Kerry McCoy was happy with what
he saw from his athletes in the first
event of the season for the Cardinal.
"We've got a bunch of things to
work on. and still there were a couple
of weight classes that weren't neces
sarily decided because of injuries,"
McCoy said."But they put that singlet
on and wrestled with pride as Stan
ford wrestlers should do."
According to McCoy, there are
three starting spots still somewhat in
doubt, starting at 157 pounds, where
No. (i Josh Zupancic is a heavy fa
vorite to retain his starting spot as a
senior. I le was forced to sit out with a
minor injury on Saturday. Ilie same
holds true at 174 pounds, as junior
Luke Feist is also likely to be the
starter despite not competing on Sat
urday.
"If this were an official competi
tion. 1 think they both could have
wrestled," McCoy said. "They were
both in a situation where it wasn't a
necessity for them to wrestle, [so we
decided to] err on the side of caution."
The 197-pound weight class, then,
is perhaps the most undecided weight

in the Cardinal lineup. Sophomore
Jake Johnson will likely earn the
starting nod there over true-fresh
man Matt Winterbourne. who was
also held ojt of competition on Sat
urday.
Several starting spots were deter
mined or cemented Saturday, though,
starting in the 125-pound weight class
where two-time Ail-American No. 5
Tanner Gardner successfully defend
ed his starting spot with a decisive
first-period pin of freshman Blair
Matsuura. At 133 pounds, redshirt
freshman Justin Paulsen held off true
freshman Porfirio Madrigal for a
tense 11-10 victory; at 165 pounds,
redshirt sophomore Peter Miller also
joined the starting lineup for the first
time in his career with an 11-7 deci
sion. 141-pound sophomore Matt
Kim successfully defended his start
ing spot with a 7-5 overtime victory.
In one of the more action-packed
bouts of the day, redshirt-freshman
Lucas Espericueta topped sopho
more Eric Minnick in a 7-4 match. Es
pericueta brought his own brand of
aggressiveness to the mats, attacking
throughout the event and looking es
pecially strong in the neutral position.
"One of the things 1 tell these guys
is to go as hard as you can as long as
you can, and he does that," McCoy
said of his freshman. "He's got that
fight in him where he refuses to let the
guy have anything. Ile'sjust going to
go hard, and if he pushes the pace on

the mat, he can be real successful."
In the afternoon's final competi
tion, heavyweight senior Phil Doern
er earned a 3-2 decision over senior
Mark Shughart. who spent the last
three years as a thrower for the track
and field team before deciding to give
wrestling a shot this offseason.
"It's my first match since last year,
so 1 just had to learn to deal with my
anxiety wrestling again." Doerner
said. "But Mark's tough, he works
hard,he's just a big athletic kid,and he
gives me trouble every day [in prac
tice]. It was definitely a good, hard
fought match, which is what 1 need
ed."
Doerner was also confident that
the overall experience of the wrestle
offs would be key in the Cardinal's
road back to the mats this season.
"It really helps us with compet
ing," he said. "It teaches us how to deal
with getting nervous before a match,
did you warm up too long, and things
like that. St) it really helps us to get
into the right mind-frame to compete
later on."
Iliis Saturday, several Cardinal
wrestlers are scheduled to take part in
the Menlo Open, in Menlo Park,
Calif., which will run all day Stan
ford's first dual meet of the season is
scheduled for Nov. at Fort Mays
State inTecumseh, Kans.
