## Prof. tackles ethics of Rumseld appointment 
### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hoping to provide an informal and ongoing
forum for discussion of ethical issues. Ethics at
Noon hosted a seminar with Paul Ehrlich. Bing
Professor of Population Studies in the department
of Biological Sciences last Friday.
Ehrlich opened the event, titled "'Environmen
tal Ethics and Should Rummy Be Invited to Cam
pus?" with a concrete answer to the question posed
in the seminar's title.
"No, he shouldn't." said the author of the ground
breaking 1%8 book, "The Population Bomb."
Ehrlich said that when it comes to ethical issues,
Stanford should set an example for the world. I le
emphasized his disagreement with the year-long
1 loover visiting fellowship of former Defense Sec
retary Donald Rumsfeld and challenged his ap
pointment on matters of personal integrity.
"Yes. he increased terrorism, so does that make
him a scholar?" Ehrlich asked. "The ethical ques
tion is: what kind of credentials do you need to be

part of Stanford University?"
Ehrlich also addressed the problems of over
population, resource over consumption and cli
mate change as matters of public policy. He said the
surging economies of countries like China and
India will increase global demand for fossil fuels in
coming years, and that advances in energy efficien
cy are unlikely to wholly resolve the problem.
"Driving a Prius is not going to entirely reverse
the environmental consequences." he said.
Ehrlich said increased educational opportuni
ties for women were an important part of reducing
world population growth.
"If women in the world had better access to ed
ucation. better jobs and reasonable pay." he said.
"Birth rates would significantly go down."
Before opening up the floor to public com
ments, Ehrlich also acknowledged the need for
more interdisciplinary professors at Stanford, as
well as a general education curriculum to address
environmental and ethical concerns that are not
covered by currently required undergraduate
courses.

"Humanity may be doomed to disappear in
some decades," if there are no fundamental
lifestyle and educational changes, he said.
Many audience members were receptive to
Ehrlich's arguments.
"Stanford is an innovative institution and we
have people in very high positions that are trying to
make a change," said Marilyn Cornelius, a first
year graduate student in the Interdisciplinary Pro
gram in Environment & Resources."But if we talk
about reducing over-consumption during an eight
course dinner, is our process aligned with our goal?
Ehrlich agreed and answered that as a scholarly
community, Stanford has a responsibility to train
people and let the general public know that engag
ing in discussion about over-consumption habits
and overpopulation is critical. However, it is equal
ly imperative to move forward and change lifestyle
patterns, he said.
"If Stanford traces the way," Ehrlich said. "Oth
ers will follow."
