## Gender balance vital in classroom 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
A recent Stanford psychology study suggests that
women's academic performance depends on the gen
der composition of a classroom.The study sought to ex
amine the reasons for the gender disparity found in the
sciences and comes after comments made bv former
Harvard University president Larry Summers, who
suggested that women may not possess the same "in
nate ability" as men in math and science fields.
In the study, researchers showed a group of Stanford
undergraduates a one-hour gender-balanced or unbal
anced video depicting a potential summer leadership
conference. The students, both male and female, were
math, science and engineering majors, and the re
searchers measured each subject's physiological arous
al during the video, in addition to cognitive vigilance,
sense of belonging and desire to participate in the con
ference.
"The idea for the study came from the problem of
under-representation of women in math, science and
engineering fields," said Mary Murphy, who conducted
the study and received her Ph.D. in social psychology
from Stanford last year. "Past explanations for the gen
der gap focused on biological or socialization explana
tions and we wondered whether subtle situational cues
in these fields could be enough to discourage women
from going into and persisting in these areas."
Women who watched the gender-unbalanced video,
in which men outnumbered women three to one. expe
rienced faster heart rates and more significant perspira
tion. ITie female subjects also reported a lower sense of

belonging and less desire to participate in the confer
ence when watching the video in which women were
outnumbered, and they were more vigilant with regard
to their physical environment.
"This research shows that seemingly incidental cues
bearing on the number of women in math science set
tings can dramatically affect their comfort and sense of
belonging in the setting, as well as the physiological cost
they can pay for just being in the setting." said Psychol
ogy Prof. Claude Steele. "Research of this sort will open
up new and feasible ways of addressing the under-rep
resentation of women in these important fields."
The gender-imbalance study is consistent with other
studies on the effects of subtle situational cues. A previ
ous study indicated that women's math performance
was linearly related to the number of men present in the
room. In this study, women performed best on a difficult
math test without men in the room. If one man was
present they did a bit worse, and if two men were pres
ent they did worse still.
These studies suggest that situational cues of numer
ical representation can influence people, not simply by
altering performance, but also by affecting their cogni
tion. memory, physiology, sense of belonging and desire
to participate in a domain.
"I hope that this will inspire people to consider the
environments that they create," Murphy said, "to pay
attention to the subtle situational cues that may seem
innocuous to some but have real meaning for. and im
pact on, other groups."
