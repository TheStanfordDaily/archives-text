# STUDENT LIFE
## Students, prof. ponder new major 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
United in their passion for poverty
and inequality studies, seven students
from vary ing academic disciplines met
last night with David Grusky, profes
sor of sociology and director of the
newly launched Center for the Study
of Poverty and Inequality (SCSPI), to
discuss the possibility of a new under
graduate concentration related to the
study of poverty and inequality.
"Inequality has come to he regard
ed as a fundamental social problem,"
Grusky said. "If poverty and inequali
ty were treated in the past as mere
moral problems, they are more re
garded as problems with more pro
found consequences and threats for
the world community than those of
simple moral discomfort."
The seeds of interest for such a con
centration were sowed earlier this year
with the opening of the SCSPI as part
of the Stanford Challenge — Presi
dent John Hennessy's larger vision
that Stanford become more deeply en
gaged in addressing the many prob
lems facing the world in the 21st centu
ry. Top universities nationwide have al
ready created interdisciplinary train
ing programs in poverty and inequali
ty. drawing on faculty from economics.

sociology and political science depart
ments. Grusky hopes to start a similar
program here at Stanford.
"Though the Center is still in start
up mode, there are efforts to build a
curriculum focusing on an undergradu
ate program in poverty and inequality
studies," he said. "Undergraduate stu
dents at Stanford who are interested in
issues of poverty and inequality, of
which there are many, have had to
piece together their own programs in a
haphazard way. Many universities have
programs of this sort. It is very possible
that it would be popular here too."
Currently, Grusky's proposal
weighs the options of implementing ei
ther or both a minor and honors pro
gram in poverty and inequality that will
provide an interdisciplinary home for
students interested in exploring these
issues.The program will be built around
a core interdisciplinary course, "Con
troversies in Inequality," taught by
Grusky. Students would then be free to
explore a program of electives focused
on developing tools to analyze and un
pack these issues from a variety of dif
ferent viewpoints and disciplines.
Outlining the potential of inequali
ty to negatively affect both macro- and
micro-level outcomes such as terror
ism. GNP, ethnic unrest, health and po
litical participation, Grusky and the

students said that the study of poverty
and inequality is deeply interdiscipli
nary in a way that has rendered stan
dard departmental training provincial.
"There is this great intersect
among so many disciplines at this one
issue: poverty," said Aaron Kofman
"09. "This is a huge issue that matters
to a lot of different people from a lot of
different fields."
Grusky agreed, conveying his sup
port of involving numerous academic
disciplines such as economics, educa
tion, sociology, history, philosophy and
political science.
"On my part and on part of the ad
visory," he said, "I am fully behind
making this concentration as interdis
ciplinary as possible without bias
whatsoever."
Fagan Harris '09, who has worked
with Grusky in the past, is excited
about this new initiative.
"1 was very pleased with the start of
the Center and the work it has done so
far." he said."! think this is a huge need
that needs to be addressed, and I want
ed to be part of it in some capacity."
If all goes as planned. Grusky
hopes that the program will be in op
eration next year.
