Arthur Romberg,a professor emeritus at the School of
Medicine who was awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Phys
iology or Medicine for test-tube replication of viral DNA,
died on Friday from respiratory failure at Stanford I lospi
tal. I le was 89.
"Dr. Romberg was one of the most distinguished and
remarkable scientists in American medicine," said School
of Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo in a statement."! lis tower
ing contributions have continued virtually up until the
time of his death."
Romberg's discovery of the enzyme DNA polymerase
in 1957 paved the way for generations of biochemical re
search.
"I think it's fair to say he's a giant (in biochemistry],"
said Emeritus Biochemistry Prof. Bob Lehman. "He
founded the department of biochemistry at Stanford al
most 40 years ago, which continues to be one of the pre
mier departments in the country."
Among other things, biochemists investigate the bio
logical and chemical processes that allow organisms to
grow and survive, relying heavily on knowledge about
DNA. which contains instructions for how these process
es take place. Until Romberg's Nobel Prize-winning dis
covery of DNA polymerase.scientists were unclear about
how organisms created new copies of these DNA instruc
tions.
Romberg's 1957 discovery came as a shock to the sci-
