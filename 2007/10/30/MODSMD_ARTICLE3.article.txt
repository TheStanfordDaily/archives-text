## Nobel winner Kornberg dead at 89 Medical school professor was instrumental in DNA research 
### VICTOR CRUZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arthur Romberg,a professor emeritus at the School of
Medicine who was awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Phys
iology or Medicine for test-tube replication of viral DNA,
died on Friday from respiratory failure at Stanford I lospi
tal. I le was 89.
"Dr. Romberg was one of the most distinguished and
remarkable scientists in American medicine," said School
of Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo in a statement."! lis tower
ing contributions have continued virtually up until the
time of his death."
Romberg's discovery of the enzyme DNA polymerase
in 1957 paved the way for generations of biochemical re
search.
"I think it's fair to say he's a giant (in biochemistry],"
said Emeritus Biochemistry Prof. Bob Lehman. "He
founded the department of biochemistry at Stanford al
most 40 years ago, which continues to be one of the pre
mier departments in the country."
Among other things, biochemists investigate the bio
logical and chemical processes that allow organisms to
grow and survive, relying heavily on knowledge about
DNA. which contains instructions for how these process
es take place. Until Romberg's Nobel Prize-winning dis
covery of DNA polymerase.scientists were unclear about
how organisms created new copies of these DNA instruc
tions.
Romberg's 1957 discovery came as a shock to the sci-
entific community.
"1 lis work was initially rejected by
[a leading publication]," said Lehman,
who worked with Kornberg for nearly
50 years. "Eventually it was published.
The next year, he got the Nobel Prize."
Cancer drugs and antiretrovirals
used to treat HIV were formed with
methods developed in Kornberg's re
search.
"Enzymes discovered by him and
his students laid the foundation for
the genetic engineering revolution,
which has huge implications,"
Lehman said. "It has had a huge im
pact on public health."
Kornberg's work formed the basis
for DNA sequencing, which eventual
ly led to the mapping of the human

genome in the Human Genome Pro
ject. I le trained students for nearly all
of his 50-year research career and has
been compared to an intellectual
grandfather by today's top biochemi
cal and genetic researchers.
"He really trained generations of
leading investigators," said Charles
Brenner, a professor of genetics and
biochemistry at Dartmouth Universi
ty. "The people that come out of his
laboratory are literally continuing his
legacy on every continent."
Colleagues remember him as an
intellectually demanding person who
cared equally about enzymes and peo
ple.
"What struck me about him was
that he treated the people around him
with love and respect," said Anand
Setharaman, senior bioinformatics
programmer at the Stanford Human
Genome Center.
"1 le treated everyone that came to
visit him with respect and kindness,"

added Gini (Chambers, his administra
tive assistant of eight years.
Former students also remember
his demanding work ethic and pas
sionate interest in all stages of their
work.
"He really cared about people, and
he wanted people to be extremely
dedicated and intensely focused," said
former student and Biochemistry
Prof. Doug Brutlag Ph. D.'72. "When
he vacationed in Italy, 1 was in the mid
dle of a big experiment for my re
search. I le left with his secretary num
bers that he could be contacted at, so I
could tell him what was going on in the
lab."
Many of his students wrote on the
memorial guestbook available on the
School of Medicine Web site.
Kornberg is survived by three sons
and eight grandchildren. His son
Roger Kornberg Ph. D.'72, a structur
al biology professor, followed in his fa
ther's footsteps by earning the 2(X)6

Nobel Prize in Chemistry, an award
which made the duo one of six father
son Nobel Prize-winning pairs.
Tom, his middle son. was a cellist at
Julliard before making his own
groundbreaking discoveries as a bio
chemist at UC-San Francisco, and his
youngest son Kenneth is an architect
at a firm that specializes in laboratory
design.
The family held a small memorial
gathering at their home on Sunday.
Burial arrangements are private, but
the University will be holding a cele
bration of Kornberg's life and accom
plishments. according to Pizzo's office.
"He always stood for the right
things." said 1980 Nobel laureate Paul
Berg, professor emeritus of biochem
istry. in a statement. "To him, honesty
and integrity in science was upper
most."
