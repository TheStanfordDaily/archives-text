## Immigrants found key to tech sector 
### MINH PHAN 
Debates over globalization and im
migration tend to focus on the plight of
millions of unskilled immigrants who
enter the United States illegally, but
such discussions often overlook the
highly-educated immigrants who
enter the country in pursuit of entre
preneurial dreams, according to a
Duke University-led study.
Vivek Wadhwa, an executive-in
residence at Duke's Pratt School of
Engineering, led a study showing that
immigrants were one of the key
founders of 25.3 percent of all engi
neering and technology companies set
up in the U.S. between 1995 and 2(X)5.
The study also found that the mix of
immigrants varied by state, with Chi
nese and Indian nationals contributing
to over half of immigrant-founded
start-ups in California, particularly in
Silicon Valley.
"In recent years. Asian immigrants
have played an important role in Sili
con Valley's growth, as suppliers of
both engineering and entrepreneurial
talent," said Rafiq Dossani. a senior
scholar at the Stanford Asia/Pacific
Research Center. " I"he Indian and
Chinese communities' contributions
have been particularly noted because
of their large numbers in the Valley."
Dossani surveyed more than K).(KK)
members of Silicon Valley's ethnic
Chinese and Indian engineering and
business associations for a 2(X)2 study
to provide an accurate profile of immi
grant entrepreneurs with respect to

birthplace, age distribution, arrival
date in the U.S and education level.
Within the survey group, 68.5 per
cent listed Greater China or India as
their place of birth.
U.S.-born respondents made up
23.2 percent, and the rest came from
other countries. More than half — 55.9
percent of Chinese and 54.4 percent of
Indians — of the respondents indicat
ed that they were aged 26 to 35 years.
The majority of both ethnic groups ar
rived in the U.S. during the early- to
mid-19905.
According to Dossani's study, over
half of the immigrant founders held a
master's degree, with 29 percent of
Chinese CEOs holding doctoral de
grees and 28 percent of Indian entre
preneurs having MBAs. About three
quarters had bachelor's degrees in sci
ence, technology,engineering or math
ematics.
"The survey confirms several of the
popular views about the contributions
of the mainland Chinese and Indian
born immigrants into Silicon Valley,"
Dossani said.
"Across the board, they are all high
ly educated and entrepreneurial. I low
ever, the data suggests that despite
their short stay in the U.S., Indians
have advanced relatively rapidly up
the corporate ladder due to the higher
percentage of managerial degrees
(MBAs) versus the ("hinese's stress on
technical education (Ph.D.'s)."
