## Certificate program goes entirely online 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
In a move to provide greater accessibility to
instruction on software security, Stanford's Cen
ter for Professional Development began offering
its six-course Advanced Computer Security Cer
tificate Program entirely online this fall.
Using VMware technology, the program
teaches clients how to construct attacks and test
their own defenses in isolation of real systems, ac
cording to Neil Daswani M.S.'O4, Ph.D.'os,one of
three instructors of the six-course sequence.
"There are some other certification programs
available," Daswani said. "But there hasn't been
a program that focuses as deeply on software cer
tification as Stanford's program."
I)aswani added that the program is unique be
cause it provides "hands-on software security
training and can be taken completely online by
geographically distributed engineers and IT
stall."
llie set of classes caters to software engineers,
corporate CEOs and government affiliates look
ing to protect their systems and their customers'
security.
"I think for a lot of people, especially in this
area |Silicon Valley] since it is very competitive,
they are trying to build skill sets because they
want to move up in their jobs, and they want to
learn skills that are going to put them ahead,"
Professional Education Program Manager Evi-
Lynn Byer'9B said.
She added that a perk for many enrolling in
the program is the combination of academics and
industry that Daswani and Stanford Computer
Science Profs. Dan Boneh and John Mitchell pro
vide through their instruction.
The need for this kind of instruction is great,
Daswani said.
"Over the past five to six years, we've started
to see a string of very, very serious [software] at
tacks," he said. "Back in 2005 there was a credit
card payment system called Card Systems. They

had a database with 43 million credit card num
bers in it.The bad guys constructed an attack that
would construct a number of database scripts
that would email them 1.000 credit card numbers
a day."
The company did not catch the problem for six
months, Daswani said.
And it is attacks like these that Daswani and
his colleagues are training clients to thwart. Infor
mation on guarding against such attacks is scarce
in the industry.
"If you look at undergraduate computer sci
ence degrees, they are being trained to program
but not to secure software. Most universities do
have courses on cryptography, but as it turns out,
cryptography is a very small component of the
overall system." Daswani added. "Ninety-nine
percent or more are attacks where the bad guy
has not broken the encryption but has taken ad
vantages of vulnerability in the software."
In this context, it comes as no surprise that
Stanford's program has attracted students from
Cisco, IBM, e√üay, Hewlett Packard. National
Semiconductor and McAfee.
Clients have also included both domestic and for
eign government affiliates.
"When it comes to security in government,
cyber security has been a neglected child,"
Daswani said. "There is a very clear incentive for
them to invest in [a] certification program. It
would great for government to step up."
Indeed, some officials have. Past clients in
clude employees of the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security, which has in previous years
received failing marks in an annual computer se
curity report card issued by the U.S. House of
Representatives Committee on Government
Reform. Also on the roster have been officials
from China and India who, Byer said, were most
ly looking for help with public policy and entre
preneurial ventures. She added that software se
curity course instructors have tailored courses for
some government engineers in the past.
The certificate program is composed of three

core courses and three electives, each six hours
long and available anytime online. Instruction is
given through taped lectures of live campus class
es, labs and exams. Daswani said. The courses
focus on teaching principles, he added, since
teaching every possible vector of an attack is im
possible.
Online instruction is not unique to the pro
gram nor to the Center for Professional Develop
ment. which now offers all of its courses online,
Byer said.
According to Daswani. MIT has already taken
its entire undergraduate computer science pro
gram online. Stanford, too, offers numerous un
dergraduate courses online, including Computer
Science 106 A this quarter.
Daswani is optimistic about the growing trend
to offer courses entirely online but added that
there are drawbacks in addition to the benefits of
teaching entirely in the cyber realm.
"The one drawback is the lack of interaction
with the instructor," he said. "A lot of learning
does take place through interaction."
In the past, he said,some students have chosen
to come to campus even when the courses were
entirely online just so they could have the person
al interaction with the professor and peers.
However, the benefits of course accessibility
at any time or location as well as the reduced
cost of online instruction outweigh the lack of
interaction for many. The Software Security
Foundations course alone boasts 400 online par
ticipants. The fledgling Advanced Computer Se
curity Program has had 15 graduates so far and
anticipates growth this year with the program
going online.
"Given the scale of this problem and given
that we need to disseminate information much
more widely," Daswani said, "The online courses
allow us to get information out much more quick
ly and to a much wider geographic distribution of
people."
