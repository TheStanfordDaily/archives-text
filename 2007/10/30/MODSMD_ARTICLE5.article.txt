# Big game shirt redrawn
## T-shirt design pulled by ASSU/SSE after student complaint of insensitivity 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Big Game fast approaching, Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) and the Stanford Store began accepting orders for the

traditional Hig Game t-shirts last week. Hie popular shirts
mock Cal every year, but some students thought one joke
this year went a bit too far.

One of this year's designs referenced Azia Kim. the
impostor revealed by The

Daily last May to be posing

as a Stanford student.

After a protest initiat-

Ed by Kelvin Vuong
'08, SSE and ASSU
officials decided to
pull the controver
sial design, which
read, "It was either
a FULL RIDE at
CAL or SNEAK

ING into Stanford
Azia."

"The Azia Kim jokes make
me feel sick to be a part of the
student body." Vuong said. "She
is not a joke and is a human
being that deserves the same re
spect that we give to each other.

Last Friday, in a push to have the design withdrawn, Vuong sent an
open email to the ASSU Executives, the SSE CEO, the Stanford Store
director and the group making the shirts.
"1 find it hard to believe that we. as Stanford students, would stoop to
attacking an individual in order to make a Big Game shirt." he wrote in
his email. "In the end, all we accomplish is making fools of ourselves and
showing to others that we are insensitive."
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims '89
said she had not heard of the incident hut acknowledged that the t-shirt
may have crossed the line from humor to inappropriate.
"1 imagine that Azia Kim was a very troubled young woman," she
said. "So, however humorous and innocent the intention was behind the
t-shirt. it feels appropriate not to make fun of her situation or of the men
tal health difficulties at its foundation."
Other students agreed with Vuong and Lythcott-Haims about respecting
Kim.
"It is good that they didn't go ahead with the design." said Stacy
Aguilera' 11." I think she has been victimized enough already."
Not all students, however, supported the decision to cut the shirt.

"The Azia t-shirt is actually
very funny. 1 wish I could have got
ten the t-shirt." said Ethan Sufian
'11. "It was a bit of light-hearted
fun. and I don't think anyone was
getting hurt. She hurt us as a stu
dent body by stealing from us. so
what makes it so bad to poke some

light-hearted fun hack at her?"
ASSU and SSE officials said they
decided to discontinue the shirt out
of respect for student opinions.
"Due to concerns which have
been raised by members of the Stan
ford community, we have decided to
no longer distribute the Azia shirt."
said Tabari Dossett '08. the general
manager of development for SSE.
"The decision to no longer distrib
ute the shirt was made by our organ
ization as a result of the various per
spectives presented to us."

"The decision to withdraw the
t-shirt was made due to concerns
over its appropriateness," ASSU
Vice President Mondaire Jones '09
said in an email to The Daily. "We
are confident in the quality of its
replacement and believe it will
resonate with current Stanford
students even more than its prede
cessor."
Dossett added that an alternate
design has replaced the Azia version
and is now available in addition to
the four other designs.

"We encourage students to re
view our revised order form for our
current selections," he said.
In the end, Vuong was pleased
with the ASSU's course of action
and its quick response, as the t-shirt
was removed by Sunday.
"All in all, they made what I feel
was the right decision." he said, "and
1 am impressed with the way they
handled the situation."
