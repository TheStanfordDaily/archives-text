# Big game shirt redrawn
## T-shirt design pulled by ASSU/SSE after student complaint of insensitivity 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Big Game fast approaching, Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) and the Stanford Store began accepting orders for the

traditional Hig Game t-shirts last week. Hie popular shirts
mock Cal every year, but some students thought one joke
this year went a bit too far.

One of this year's designs referenced Azia Kim. the
impostor revealed by The

Daily last May to be posing

as a Stanford student.

After a protest initiat-

Ed by Kelvin Vuong
'08, SSE and ASSU
officials decided to
pull the controver
sial design, which
read, "It was either
a FULL RIDE at
CAL or SNEAK

ING into Stanford
Azia."

"The Azia Kim jokes make
me feel sick to be a part of the
student body." Vuong said. "She
is not a joke and is a human
being that deserves the same re
spect that we give to each other.

Last Friday, in a push to have the design withdrawn, Vuong sent an
open email to the ASSU Executives, the SSE CEO, the Stanford Store
director and the group making the shirts.
"1 find it hard to believe that we. as Stanford students, would stoop to
attacking an individual in order to make a Big Game shirt." he wrote in
his email. "In the end, all we accomplish is making fools of ourselves and
showing to others that we are insensitive."
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims '89
said she had not heard of the incident hut acknowledged that the t-shirt
may have crossed the line from humor to inappropriate.
"1 imagine that Azia Kim was a very troubled young woman," she
said. "So, however humorous and innocent the intention was behind the
t-shirt. it feels appropriate not to make fun of her situation or of the men
tal health difficulties at its foundation."
Other students agreed with Vuong and Lythcott-Haims about respecting
Kim.
"It is good that they didn't go ahead with the design." said Stacy
Aguilera' 11." I think she has been victimized enough already."
Not all students, however, supported the decision to cut the shirt.
