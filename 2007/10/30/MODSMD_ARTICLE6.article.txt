## Historian examines effects of the slave trade 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The introduction at last night's
Presidential Lecture was inspira
tional, to say the least.
"Libraries are indeed mobbed,
and there is commotion across the
media, but Simon Schama has come
to the rescue," said History Depart
ment Chair Aron Rodrigue as he in
troduced the night's speaker to a
standing-room-only Cubberley Au
ditorium.
Schama, a professor of Art I listo
ry and History at Columbia Univer
sity, spoke on the history of the slave
trade in a lecture entitled,"The Abo
lition of the Slave Trade Two Hun
dred Years On — American and
Britain: T\vo Diverging Destinies?"
"Schama has been at the fore
front of the battle to bring narrative
back into history and to make the art
of story-telling accessible to every
one," Rodrigue said in his introduc
tion. "The task at hand is to move
history back into the common public
culture where it rightly belongs."
Schama's lecture was based on
the topic of his most recent book,
"Rough Crossings: Britain, the
Slaves, and the American Revolu
tion," which explores the lives of

African-American slaves who
fought as Loyalists with the British
during the American Revolution.
The lecture delved further into
what Schama called a "poisonous
paradox of early American history."
Schama explained that Thomas
Jefferson's 1807 bill abolishing the
slave trade actually propagated the
inhuman practice. Furthermore,
Schama denied the view that slavery
was primarily necessary for econom
ic prosperity and instead stressed
that actual abolition legislation was
delayed for decades so as not to "toy
dangerously with a fragile Union."
In addition. Schama spoke on the
"great debate" that arose over aboli
tion in Britain in 18()b. explaining
that following the war against the
French. "British defeat led to soul
searching."

"...sardine-can-packed
African bodies."

"Children were made aware of
famous pictures of the slave ship
Brooks' with their sardine-can
packed African bodies," Schama
said, referring to education in
Britain at the time.
Schama also criticized the senti
ment among the British earlier this
year during the 2(H) year anniversary
of the Abolition of Slavery Act, say
ing "there was an element of back
tapping" prevalent among com
memorators. He also dismissed the
idea of a formal British apology for
slavery with an anecdotal compari
son to his own Jewish background.
"If a perfectly nice German came up
to me and said, 'Sorry about
Auschwitz,' 1 would say, 'That does
n't cut it.'" Schama said to a laughing
