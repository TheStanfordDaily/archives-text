## Historian examines effects of the slave trade 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The introduction at last night's
Presidential Lecture was inspira
tional, to say the least.
"Libraries are indeed mobbed,
and there is commotion across the
media, but Simon Schama has come
to the rescue," said History Depart
ment Chair Aron Rodrigue as he in
troduced the night's speaker to a
standing-room-only Cubberley Au
ditorium.
Schama, a professor of Art I listo
ry and History at Columbia Univer
sity, spoke on the history of the slave
trade in a lecture entitled,"The Abo
lition of the Slave Trade Two Hun
dred Years On — American and
Britain: T\vo Diverging Destinies?"
"Schama has been at the fore
front of the battle to bring narrative
back into history and to make the art
of story-telling accessible to every
one," Rodrigue said in his introduc
tion. "The task at hand is to move
history back into the common public
culture where it rightly belongs."
Schama's lecture was based on
the topic of his most recent book,
"Rough Crossings: Britain, the
Slaves, and the American Revolu
tion," which explores the lives of

Columbia University historian

African-American slaves who
fought as Loyalists with the British
during the American Revolution.
The lecture delved further into
what Schama called a "poisonous
paradox of early American history."
Schama explained that Thomas
Jefferson's 1807 bill abolishing the
slave trade actually propagated the
inhuman practice. Furthermore,
Schama denied the view that slavery
was primarily necessary for econom
ic prosperity and instead stressed
that actual abolition legislation was
delayed for decades so as not to "toy
dangerously with a fragile Union."
In addition. Schama spoke on the
"great debate" that arose over aboli
tion in Britain in 18()b. explaining
that following the war against the
French. "British defeat led to soul
searching."

"...sardine-can-packed
African bodies."

"Children were made aware of
famous pictures of the slave ship
Brooks' with their sardine-can
packed African bodies," Schama
said, referring to education in
Britain at the time.
Schama also criticized the senti
ment among the British earlier this
year during the 2(H) year anniversary
of the Abolition of Slavery Act, say
ing "there was an element of back
tapping" prevalent among com
memorators. He also dismissed the
idea of a formal British apology for
slavery with an anecdotal compari
son to his own Jewish background.
"If a perfectly nice German came up
to me and said, 'Sorry about
Auschwitz,' 1 would say, 'That does
n't cut it.'" Schama said to a laughing

audience.
Following the one-hour lecture,
students and faculty alike were im
pressed and inspired.
"I thought the lecture was really
interesting because it dealt with
slavery not only in the American
context, but also in the international
context," said Emily Rials '11. "1
came in not knowing a whole lot
about the topic, but now I'm inter
ested in learning more."
"I have read a lot of books on the
subject of slavery," added Shine
Aung'l I,"but topics covered in this
lecture are not covered at all in the
history books."
"Schama's precision in digging
through the archives of history [is]
so compelling," said classics lecturer
Patrick Hunt."that one has to take it
and really masticate it over and over
again. His command of the language
and the history is magisterial."
Faculty members hoped that at-

tendees of the lecture took away
something to ponder or debate.
"Because Schama's theses were
bold and presented with remarkable
nuance, there will be plenty of room
for debate," said Stephen Hinton,
associate dean for the humanities.
"I want people to understand
that the issues are tremendously
complex intellectually, economical
ly. morally and philosophically,"
Hunt added. "1 certainly hope Pro
fessor Schama will return. He's the
real deal."
In addition to his role at Colum
bia, Schama is the author of interna
tionally recognized books and an
award-winning broadcaster. He has
written and presented more than 30
films for the BBC and PBS. and he
has contributed articles on culture
and politics to Hie Guardian and
The New Yorker.
A discussion with Schama on last
night's lecture will be held today at
10 a.m. in the Humanities Center;
admission is free and open to the
public.
