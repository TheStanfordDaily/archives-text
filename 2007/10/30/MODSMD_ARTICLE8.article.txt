This is class?
Welcome to "Retracing Your Imagination: Self-Ex
pression Through I drawing," one of the six Student Initiat
ed Courses (SICs) offered thisquarter. Initiated in 1999 as
one- or two-unit credit/no credit classes led by students,
SIC s offered this quarter range in topic from Web appli
cations to the reduction of Stanford's carbon footprint.
1 nstructors create courses on subjects they feel are under
explored and underserved by the current curriculum.
"Stanford has so much to offer." said Mei l.i '09. Co-in
structor of "Retracing Your Imagination," "but fine and
visual arts opportunities are very limited for non-majors."
Faculty and students also say SICs offer a different ap
proach to learning. Instead of making class a "top-down
delivering of knowledge," said English Prof. Judith
Richardson, SICs "put into action the idea that learning is
a collaborative, multifarious process."
Classes vary in format according to the design of
course leaders.
For example, the class Richardson sponsors, "Harry
Potter and the Arc of Storytelling," is largely discussion
based. "A Beginner's Guide to Bridge" is about half lec
ture and half actual play. In Li's studio art class, students
listen to pointers for a few minutes before launching into
personal drawing time and small group critiques.

Homework loads also vary. "Harry Potter" students
read about one book a week and focus on a central theme
such as family. The bridge class assigns problem set-like
work every week, and studio art students turn in one
piece every two weeks. SICs tend to weigh attendance
and effort most heavily, with students graded by faculty
sponsors based on instructors' recommendations.
Many SICs make an effort to interact with the outside
community, part of a broadly construed service learning
requirement. Studio art students plan to volunteer once
this quarter in East Palo Alto and put on an exhibit.
Bridge students have the opportunity to play in a nation
al tournament held in San Franscisco in November. The
"Harry Potter" instructors considered including a re
quirement to submit material to I larry Potter fan website
Mugglenet.com.
To create a SIC. prospective course leaders must sub
mit a proposal with a general mission statement, syllabus
and budget estimate one quarter prior to the desired in
struction period.
The panel, which consists of four students and four facul
ty members, puts no cap on SIC approval. But SIC
Coordinator Sean Arenson '08 said that not everyone
with a random idea can run a class for credit.
"Applications must be of very high quality for the
panel to consider them worthy of Stanford units." Aren
son said. "Applicants that fall short of this standard re
ceive feedback and are encouraged to reapply in a subse
quent quarter."
Another part of the application process is to find a fac
ulty sponsor who will help solidify the syllabus and check
in throughout the quarter. While some students had diffi
culty finding faculty sponsors, others found professors

eager and willing to help.
"I get 'first dibs,' a front-row seat on the phe
nomenon." Richardson said." 11 is a learning ex
perience for me. too."
Richardson is also enthusiastic about the
effect on her department.
"SICs can have the effect of keeping the
more formal departmental institutions on
their toes, as these classes pick up on and point
to developing or neglected areas," she said.
And though SICs might be less formal than
other classes, they provide a more structured en
vironment than simply pursuing a hobby in spare
time â€” something students like.

"1 like art. but it's hard to do it unless you have to
do it," said Cameron Lamming' 11. a student in Li's

class.
Ultimately, SIC advocates hope that the overall SIC
creation and enrollment process will become even

more ingrained in Stanford culture.

"Along with introductory seminars and Sopho
more College, we want students to consider SICs

an essential part of the Stanford experi
ence." Arenson said.
Even the more lighthearted classes?
"I seriously have to defend it to every
one," said "Harry Potter" class leader
C'aley Anderson '08.
"Screw them," said her co-instructor,
Christine O'Connell '08."I don't care."
