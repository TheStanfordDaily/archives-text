## Editorial Board Boo on the Halloween ban 
### 
San Francisco city officials have decided
to cancel this year's Halloween party in
the Castro district. Officials cite in
creased violence — nine shootings last year
and four stabbings in 2002 — and ensuing
appeals from concerned citizens as reasons
behind their decision.To dissuade throngs of
people from venturing into the city tonight,
the city is taking measures to ensure that
there will be no festivities in the Castro. On
the one hand, it is unclear whether the vio
lence that has tainted the event will return
this year. This would suggest that the entire
campaign is unfounded. On the other hand,
if the violence is likely to return it is unclear
whether the city's strategy will deter it.
Two Halloweens marked by violence
hardly substantiate claims of inherent dan
ger or an increased trend. For the many
years that this event — which brings up
wards of 100,000 revelers annually — has
taken place, similar hostile happenings have
been non-existent. Of the millions of people
who have attended over the course of the
event's 50-year history, only a handful have
experienced serious physical harm. Further
more, there is no reason to believe that the
two occurrences, separated by four years,
will naturally lead to more violence in the
future. It would appear that city officials are
targeting a problem that doesn't actually
exist.
Of course, city officials could merely be
concerned about the possibility of violence.
An event such as the one that took place last
year would likely be met by renewed anger
and claims of incompetence. This perceived
threat, though, may have fuelled a zero-tol
erance response whose asserted objectives

may not be met by the chosen course of ac
tion. While the logic underlying the city's
methods seems reasonable, their strategy —
advertising, accepting sponsorships from
local media, heightening security and re
stricting access to the area — does not seem
to sufficiently solve the problem it tries to
address.
The line of reasoning city officials may be
operating under is that by dramatically re
ducing the number of people in the Castro,
the ability to monitor and punish bad behav
ior on Halloween will be enhanced. If peo
ple actually stay home, the neighborhood
will certainly remain safe. However, an ad
campaign and a polite request asking busi
nesses to close on Halloween will be ineffec
tive in keeping revelers from coming to the
Castro. The city may be overestimating its
influence here, since this event preceded
municipal involvement and has become tra
dition. Attesting to this determination are
reports of businesses in the Castro district
actively preparing for Halloween festivities.
While some bars, clubs and restaurants have
agreed to close early tonight, most have not.
On one of the most lucrative nights of the
year, local vendors are not surprisingly try
ing to ignore the city's requests. This resist
ance persists despite attempts by the city to
take these business owners' interests into
account.
The Castro's Halloween festivities, cele
brated since the 19505, are being thwarted
by the efforts of the municipal authorities.
For next Halloween, however, the Castro's
festivities should not be tainted by the
events of 2002 and 2006, but inspired by
what could have been in 2007.
