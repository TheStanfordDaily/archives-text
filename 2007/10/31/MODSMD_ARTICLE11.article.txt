## I hate the netroots 
### 
There, I said it. Finally. Before 1 begin to
polemicize, let me define the "net
roots." The netroots, as they apply to
Democratic politics, are a collection of "pro
gressive" blogs and their followers.The most
prominent among them is DailyKos, led by
Markos Moulitsas Zuniga. Other leading
"netroots" blogs include the pedantic
Think Progress, Eschaton, Talk Left and
MoveOn.org, the infamous creators of the
"General Betray Us?" ad.
Ihc "netroots" really got started during
the 2004 campaign, as the left's "anger" at
President Bush began to build. Most of the
bloggers initially gravitated to former Gov
ernor Howard Dean of Vermont, who
fundraised massive, record-breaking
amounts from these online communities,
spent all of it to come in third in lowa,
screamed, and now forever remains just a
You Tube clip. So the bloggers grudgingly fell
in step with eventual nominee John Kerry,
but of the 15 other candidates supported by
DailyKos, none won.
The subsequent 2006 Congressional
midterms marked the triumph of the liberal
bloggers. but it wasn't pretty.The Democrats
reclaimed Congress by tapping into blogger
money, but only eight of the 17 Daily Kos-en
dorsed candidates won. The netroots even
funded moderates like Claire McCaskill and
Harold Ford, who shied away from the net
roots agenda in the course of their cam
paigns. Their crowning achievement was de
feating sitting Senator Joe Lieberman in the
Connecticut primary; egregious self-con
gratulation erupted before Lieberman
roared back and defeated their pawn Ned
Lamont by ten points in the general election.
The problem is that the netroots live in a
kind of political vacuum. The writers read
what they want, sort through all the articles
and tidbits,cherry pick the ones they like the
best, and post them. The readers, then, see
something that is breathtaking in its ability
to hammer home the same self-righteous
message, day after day. The community is
self-reinforcing. Some blogs even make the
outrageous claim that they are "news" blogs,
despite doing zero reporting or anything at
all that even approaches fairness.Those who
don't hold the line — Republicans, centrist
Democrats, academics — are discredited
and slandered for being corrupt evil neocon
servatives.
One fascinating example was an article
posted on DailyKos entitled: "Why I Have a
Little Crush on Ahmadinejad 'The piece ar
gues that Ahmadinejad is right to criticize
President Bush for his bad foreign policy
and that we should listen to him. although
the Iranian president is a bad person for
denying the Holocaust, and so on.The blog
ger opens by observing,"He just looks cud

dly," juxtaposing the distinguished Holo
caust denier with Kermit the Frog.The blog
ger goes on to comment: "Ahmadinejad, it
would appear, cares more about American
troops than President Bush." Clearly this is
so! Ahmadinejad is not funding and supply
ing insurgency cells in Iraq! Of course not!
In any other political forum, this would
be ridiculed. It indeed was, but only after
conservative blog Little Green Footballs
picked it up. Looking at the comments on
the post, most of the "progressives" try very
hard — and succeed — in overcoming com
mon sense to agree with this absurd post.
One commenter has it right, however: "Ihis
is beyond parody. One of the reasons conser
vatives refuse to believe that the Left is com
mitted to the defense of the United States is
little paeans to fascism like this post."
So. By now you must think I'm irrational
ly drunk on the Haterade. Not so.
TTiis summer was an interesting juxtapo
sition: all of the presidential candidates, even
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, pandered
to the bloggers at the 1 YearlyKos" conven
tion, while not one (not one!) attended the
convention of the Democratic Leadership
Council — the policy group responsible for
most of the ideas that marked the Clinton
years. (President Clinton did attend, howev
er.) Just reading about YearlyKos made me
nauseous with the noxious self-satisfaction
wafting from the page.
Matt Bai. in his new book. "The Argu
ment: Billionaires. Bloggers and the Battle
to Remake Democratic Politics." points out
how the bloggers have contributed little to
the long-term interests of the party. The De
mocratic Leadership Council generated
dozens of new policy ideas that elected Bill
Clinton twice; the rejection of those same
principles contributed to defeats in 2000 and
2004. The "progressives" are pro-union
when union membership is declining, pro
tectionist and isolationist in foreign policy.
Other than generic, populist demands for
"universal health care" and "energy inde
pendence." the bloggers have contributed
nothing to the development of an issue set to
govern on.The lesson the Democrats should
have learned in the 1990s was that taking the
political center, rather than pandering to the
populist left, was what won elections.

The fact that these bloggers
have so much clout makes it clear
that the Democrats' 2006 victory
and likely 2008 follow-up are much
more due to Republican failures

than Democratic successes. No one
in the party has been able to create
a narrative other than "Republi
cans are bad. We're better," and
the bloggers are the best at it,
hence their current ascendancy
within the party. But the party
won't be able to generate long
term success unless it can offer
something different that also ap
peals to the mainstream. And it

won't be the bloggers that do it. 1
hear the DLC has some ideas,
though. Maybe we should check
them out.

Stuart Baimel is sure that Yulia Ty
moshenko, Ukraine's next prime
minister; agrees with his distaste for
the netroots. Send all ludicrous Dai
lyKos postings and Tymoshenko
photos to sbaimel@stanford.edu.

kind of political vacuum. The writers read
what they want, sort through all the articles
and tidbits,cherry pick the ones they like the
best, and post them. The readers, then, see
something that is breathtaking in its ability
to hammer home the same self-righteous
message, day after day. The community is
self-reinforcing. Some blogs even make the
outrageous claim that they are "news" blogs,
despite doing zero reporting or anything at
all that even approaches fairness.Those who
don't hold the line — Republicans, centrist
Democrats, academics — are discredited
and slandered for being corrupt evil neocon
servatives.
One fascinating example was an article
posted on DailyKos entitled: "Why I Have a
Little Crush on Ahmadinejad 'The piece ar
gues that Ahmadinejad is right to criticize
President Bush for his bad foreign policy
and that we should listen to him. although
the Iranian president is a bad person for
denying the Holocaust, and so on.The blog
ger opens by observing,"He just looks cud

dly," juxtaposing the distinguished Holo
caust denier with Kermit the Frog.The blog
ger goes on to comment: "Ahmadinejad, it
would appear, cares more about American
troops than President Bush." Clearly this is
so! Ahmadinejad is not funding and supply
ing insurgency cells in Iraq! Of course not!
In any other political forum, this would
be ridiculed. It indeed was, but only after
conservative blog Little Green Footballs
picked it up. Looking at the comments on
the post, most of the "progressives" try very
hard — and succeed — in overcoming com
mon sense to agree with this absurd post.
One commenter has it right, however: "Ihis
is beyond parody. One of the reasons conser
vatives refuse to believe that the Left is com
mitted to the defense of the United States is
little paeans to fascism like this post."
So. By now you must think I'm irrational
ly drunk on the Haterade. Not so.
TTiis summer was an interesting juxtapo
sition: all of the presidential candidates, even
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, pandered
to the bloggers at the 1 YearlyKos" conven
tion, while not one (not one!) attended the
convention of the Democratic Leadership
Council — the policy group responsible for
most of the ideas that marked the Clinton
years. (President Clinton did attend, howev
er.) Just reading about YearlyKos made me
nauseous with the noxious self-satisfaction
wafting from the page.
Matt Bai. in his new book. "The Argu
ment: Billionaires. Bloggers and the Battle
to Remake Democratic Politics." points out
how the bloggers have contributed little to
the long-term interests of the party. The De
mocratic Leadership Council generated
dozens of new policy ideas that elected Bill
Clinton twice; the rejection of those same
principles contributed to defeats in 2000 and
2004. The "progressives" are pro-union
when union membership is declining, pro
tectionist and isolationist in foreign policy.
Other than generic, populist demands for
"universal health care" and "energy inde
pendence." the bloggers have contributed
nothing to the development of an issue set to
govern on.The lesson the Democrats should
have learned in the 1990s was that taking the
political center, rather than pandering to the
populist left, was what won elections.

The fact that these bloggers
have so much clout makes it clear
that the Democrats' 2006 victory
and likely 2008 follow-up are much
more due to Republican failures

than Democratic successes. No one
in the party has been able to create
a narrative other than "Republi
cans are bad. We're better," and
the bloggers are the best at it,
hence their current ascendancy
within the party. But the party
won't be able to generate long
term success unless it can offer
something different that also ap
peals to the mainstream. And it

won't be the bloggers that do it. 1
hear the DLC has some ideas,
though. Maybe we should check
them out.

Stuart Baimel is sure that Yulia Ty
moshenko, Ukraine's next prime
minister; agrees with his distaste for
the netroots. Send all ludicrous Dai
lyKos postings and Tymoshenko
photos to sbaimel@stanford.edu.
