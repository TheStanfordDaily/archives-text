# The 						Lowly Interns
## More freshmen? Not that scary 
### 
President Hennessy has officially creat
ed a task force to investigate increasing
the size of future freshman classes. Let
the hysteria commence.
You see. like many students, I thought I
picked Stanford to avoid the blue-blooded
elitism we like to derogatorily associate with
our East Coast compatriots. But at times like
this, the snobs come out of the woodwork. Or
maybe the facade drops.
Let's look at a few comments 1 pared from
the Daily Web site on the Oct. 11 article cov
ering Hennessy's announced task force. The
reaction is heartwarming.
One person says trying to give more peo
ple access to a world-class education is "ab
surd" because "there are thousands of higher
education options besides Stanford." lliere
are other options, but there's an element of
social responsibility involved. Our university
likes to be a leading higher educator, and
going with the attitude that those tax-funded
public institutions should deal with all the
overcrowding and first-generation students
is dubious. Should we really shoulder none of
the burden?
The same person continues: "Why is there
this desire to diminish the quality of the Stan
ford undergraduate experience just to ac
commodate more people? . . . Stanford
should ALWAYS only accept the very best
applicants, even if the quality of the applicant
pool dramatically improves year after year,
and MUST NOT simply accept whoever
Hennessy or another administrator deems
qualified' or just good enough."

The problem here is that the other admin
istrator in the equation is Richard Shaw, the

dean of admissions. I could be wrong, but
isn't his job to accept who he deems quali
fied? Doesn't he determine "good enough"?
He seems to think Stanford would benefit
from accepting more amazing applicants,
and not from boiling it down to a perverse
Darwinian process.
One thing should be clear: The quality of
students will not decrease. A friend who
served as an admissions associate said mak
ing the decisions is awful. "The first thing
they tell you in training is that you wouldn't
get in today," she told me. She just graduated,
so unless you really think that the people
around you aren't up to the Stanford stan
dard. chances are you wouldn't even notice
the change.
Another online commenter had a similar
ly Darwinian outlook."Unfortunately, Presi
dent Hennessy appears to view Stanford ad
mission as something to be handed out from
a cheap goody bag to as many qualified' peo
ple as possible, as long as those people meet
minimum requirements . . . President Hen
nessy, let me tell you what qualified' means .
.. Whether or not someone is 'qualified' de
pends on how they STACK l IP AGAINST
competing applicants in a particular year."
Competition is good, but the entire prem

ise of Hennessy's proposal is that there are
more students capable of making a major
contribution to campus and using our train
ing to do great things. In that light, the em
phasis on stacking up is morally questionable
at best. It seems to say it doesn't matter if
prospective students could perform at high
enough levels, or even if they're way smarter
than all of us here. Their own qualifications
are stolen from them by an increase they
can't control. "Sorry guys, too much talent
this year. You hit the wrong part of the popu
lation cycle." Is this really the admissions phi
losophy you want?
I don't want to call the people I quoted
wack jobs, because I too share their insecuri
ty. I'm a legacy applicant, and I applied early
Without those advantages, and with today's
tougher competition, I fully believe 1 might
not be here. Already deemed "qualified" and
"good enough," it's easy to jealously demand
that standards be increased for everyone
else. You get to benefit from their increased
cachet. And you're already safe.
I suspect many older alumni will, as my
mother did. have an instant negative reac
tion. ITiose who got in when Stanford was ad
mitting 25 or 30 percent still get to take ad
vantage of our rocketing name brand, and
those who are amazing students but just
don't make the cut these days are excluded.
Plus, why change what you're used to? But if
applications continue to increase, and size
does not, think about what will happen.

ing role in admissions decisions.
Hennessy's proposal is only a
proposal — we're not talking about
doubling — and the task force is de
signed to make sure any increase
doesn't damage the current campus
experience. New dorms and new
professors will definitely be needed.
But if you accept that the education
we receive is one of the best in the
world, both Stanford and society
will benefit from accepting a bigger
class. On campus, I'd love the chance
to meet more cool people with more
ridiculously amazing backgrounds,
and elitist or not. Stanford positions
people to change the world.
"The thing about Stanford stu
dents." said a panelist at the Stan
ford in Washington 20th reunion this
weekend, "is that they have that
burning passion in their souls to
make a difference." Would empow
ering another two hundred students
a year, giving them the resources,
connections and opportunities of
Stanford University be a bad thing?
ITie Bender Room might be more
crowded, but 1 think the potential
world impact is well worth the risk.

can't control. "Sorry guys, too much talent
this year. You hit the wrong part of the popu

I don't want to call the people I quoted
wack jobs, because I too share their insecuri

Without those advantages, and with today's
tougher competition, I fully believe 1 might
not be here. Already deemed "qualified" and
"good enough," it's easy to jealously demand
that standards be increased for everyone

cachet. And you're already safe.
I suspect many older alumni will, as my
mother did. have an instant negative reac

mitting 25 or 30 percent still get to take ad

Hennessy's proposal is only a
proposal — we're not talking about
doubling — and the task force is de
signed to make sure any increase
doesn't damage the current campus

professors will definitely be needed.
But if you accept that the education
we receive is one of the best in the
world, both Stanford and society
will benefit from accepting a bigger
class. On campus, I'd love the chance
to meet more cool people with more
ridiculously amazing backgrounds,
and elitist or not. Stanford positions
people to change the world.
"The thing about Stanford stu

weekend, "is that they have that
burning passion in their souls to
make a difference." Would empow

a year, giving them the resources,
connections and opportunities of
Stanford University be a bad thing?
