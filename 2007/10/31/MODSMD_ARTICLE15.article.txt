Justify conservative convictions
Dear Editor:
Laura Holmes asks our sympathy for
"Dan," a white conservative Christian stu
dent who suffers quietly in Stanford's op
pressive liberal climate ("Coexisting with
conservatism", Oct. 29.2007).
Imagine for a moment the anguish poor
Dan must have felt when, during orientation,
he had to witness a gay couple embrace on
stage. Imagine! Holmes calls it for what it is:
"indoctrination."

Well, I for one am glad that most of our
community believes people should be free to
choose the lives they want so long as they
don't infringe on the liberties of others. I
don't mind if Dan has no interest in marrying
a man some day-1 certainly don't myself.
But I do mind if Dan wants government to
mandate his lifestyle choice on everyone
else. Dan's beliefs may spring from his
Catholic upbringing, but if he wants to inject
them into public policy he will have to justify
them on universal moral principles that peo
ple from all backgrounds can accept. To my

view, restricting the rights of gay couples is a
hard case to argue. So arc many other conser
vative positions on issues such as abortion,
gun control,environmental stewardship, tor
ture, and pre-emptive unilateral war.
Still I encourage him and other conserva
tives on campus to articulate the reasons be
hind their convictions. But please don't hide
behind moral relativism and beg for special
privileges simply for being in the minority.
