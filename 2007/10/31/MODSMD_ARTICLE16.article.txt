## Smoke screen 
### 
Last month the Stanford Univer
sity School of Medicine offi
cially banned smoking in all
parking lots, sidewalks and outdoor
areas of their campus. While it is per
fectly reasonable to me that smoking
should be banned inside office build
ings. 1 question the reasoning behind
extending this ban to open spaces.
Standing in the parking lot next to
the Clark Center, it seemed odd that
burning a thin stick of tobacco there
could be, comparatively, so much
worse than burning gasoline in a car
engine at the same spot.
Just to be clear, let me emphasize
that I am not trying to cast doubt on
the dangers of smoking. As shown by
the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA report no. EPA/600/6-
90/006F) and the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC report no. 02N1.M:
WA 754 H4325 2006), indoor ciga
rette smoke is deadly to smokers and
non-smokers alike. Aside from
"mainstream" (inhaled) smoke, ciga
rettes produce large amounts of
"sidestream" (second-hand) smoke
from their slow smoldering between
puffs. In fact,second-hand smoke ac
counts for the bulk of the poisonous
emissions from a cigarette. For exam
ple, according to the EPA. second
hand smoke from a typical cigarette
can release up to 67 milligrams of
carbon monoxide, one milligram's
worth of oxides of nitrogen and sev
eral milligrams of complex organic
compounds, some of which are car
cinogenic. This presents a danger to
anyone present, and certainly justi
fies a ban on smoking inside offices,
bars, restaurants, airports and other
publicly accessible buildings, as well
as near the entrances to these places.
When standing in the open, how
ever. the problem of air pollution is a
little more complicated. Compare
those second-hand smoke emissions
with the EPA's data on vehicle emis
sions (EPA report no. EPA42O-F-98-
014). During summer, in only one
minute of idling (less than the time it
takes most to parallel park). the aver
age gasoline-powered passenger car

produces 3,820 milligrams of carbon
monoxide, 79 milligrams of oxides of
nitrogen, and 269 milligrams of vari
ous complex organic compounds.
These numbers are nearly doubled
for SIJ Vs. pickups and minivans, and
worse yet when the vehicle is in mo
tion, during winter and for heavy
trucks and buses.This represents tens
and hundreds of times more poisons
than an entirely smoked pack of cig
arettes. While car exhaust may not
smell as pungent as burning tobacco,
it is truly the champion of outdoor air
pollution.
So now 1 say to the Medical
School: "Let him who is without sin
cast the first stone."There is no ques
tion that cigarette smoking is danger
ous, but when you pointed the
proverbial finger at the already
hated outdoor smoker, you gave a
tacit nod of approval to a much larg
er group of addicts who are ruining
our air just the same.The hundreds of
people that drive,stop,start and park
their cars just a few feet away from
the windows and doorways of the
Medical School buildings, all day and
every day, are hardly innocent by
standers. If you, the administration of
the Medical School, are genuinely
trying to protect the health of our
community and send out a message
of responsibility, then scapegoating
the tiny minority that smokes (only
four percent according to Stanford's
Aug. 22. 2007 Medical Center Re
port) is not the way. We are all guilty
of pumping these poisons and car
cinogens into each other's lungs, so if
anyone is to be held accountable, let
us all stand trial and be forced to
compromise. Who among us sup
ports the removal of all parking lots
and a complete ban on motor vehi
cles (except, obviously, ambulances)
from the entire Medical School cam
pus? For those who do not. please
stop picking on the smokers â€” their
addiction-driven lives are miserable
enough as it is.
