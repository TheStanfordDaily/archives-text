## Nguyen on her feet again and winning already Junior tennis player returns from foot injury 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
True champions leave their blood, sweat
and tears on the court, an aphorism that res
onates deeply with junior Jessica Nguyen of
the Stanford women's tennis team.
Last February, Nguyen appeared to be
headed for a promising sophomore campaign
with the Card, which was gunning for its third
consecutive national title.
Then, Murphy's Law struck.
Nguyen developed a stress reaction in her
left foot due to the over-pronation of her left
ankle, which placed too much pressure on her
arch.
"I woke up in the morning and couldn't
step on my foot because it was just so sore,"
Nguyen said."lt hurt to walk and basically do
anything. I tried to come back, but it was too
painful to put pressure on it."
Fortunately, doctors diagnosed the stress
reaction before it turned into a stress frac
ture, but didn't have any remedies for
Nguyen other than rest.
Nguyen, who has played tennis nearly her
whole life, had to stop all tennis-related activ
ities for the following four weeks.
"It was the longest time 1 had ever taken
off," Nguyen said. "It was during finals time
so 1 could focus on school a little bit, but it
was difficult to sit there and watch everyone
practice, knowing that I couldn't be doing it."
Even worse, there was no time frame for
her recovery â€” Nguyen was out indefinitely.
After four weeks of inactivity, Nguyen
came back to practice with only two weeks
left until the NCAA Championships. She
gradually increased her court time from 15
minutes to 30 and then 40.
"I really wouldn't know when the pain
would come back," Nguyen said. "Basically
the doctors told me,' Play and if you feel pain,
stop, take a break, go back again the next day

and play a little less to try to find your thresh
old.'"
In the middle of April, the pain returned,
and Nguyen received a cortisone shot. But
she persevered with the help of her team
mates.
"The team has been really supportive,"
Nguyen said. "Every time 1 saw them, they
would ask me how it was coming along or
how my doctor's appointments were. It just
really helped to have a supportive group of
my best friends being there for me and never
putting pressure on me."
With her teammates behind her, Nguyen
returned to tournament shape in time for the
NCAAs. To help her with her injury, she
began wearing custom orthotics in her shoes,
but the rough material of the orthotics com
bined with heat and sweat ravaged her foot.
"The newly made orthotics just ripped
through the bottom of my foot," Nguyen said.
"They were raw and sore and had blisters the
size of quarters on them. But 1 kept playing
on them because I had to."
Nguyen tried taping her foot before
matches, spending up to an hour beforehand
taping to the point where she could barely fit
her foot in her shoe, but the orthotics ripped
through and the pain continued.
After each match, Nguyen's sock would be
bloody from the broken blisters. Nguyen
would have to constantly bathe her foot in io
dine to clean it out and recounts showers as
being "probably the most painful thing ever."
Despite the pain. Nguyen kept playing.
"1 wanted to play through any pain 1 had
for the team," Nguyen said. "1 just kept play
ing through it because we needed all six girls
in our lineup."
Nguyen won all of her matches in the
Championships, but the Card fell in the semi
finals to UCLA, ending the team's bid for a
third consecutive title.
But the season was not over yet. Up next

were the individual NCAA Championships
for Nguyen and her teammates.
In the second round, the pain finally
caught up with Nguyen, and she retired in her
match against Florida's Megan Alexander.
"I was disappointed after because I had
just managed to get through a long two-set
ter," Nguyen said. "And in the second match,
I had to finally retire because 1 just couldn't
play anymore. It was too painful."
Thus, Nguyen's inspiring run ended, but
her pain persisted.
After the season ended. Nguyen took an
other month off from tennis. She tried to
come back and play a bit more, but felt pain

in her foot again.
"It was really disappointing because 1 was
hoping to play a lot this summer," Nguyen
said, 'i took off more time and didn't start
playing tournaments again until August."
In August, Nguyen returned to tourna
ment play in Tokyo and eventually headed
back to the Farm in September ready to test
out her feet.
Judging from Nguyen's performance this
season, it appears that her troubles are well
behind her.
