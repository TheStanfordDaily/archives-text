# Caroline Bruce Swimming
## Ready to make waves 
### BY KATHERINE BELL 
Swimmer Caroline Bruce is no stranger
to success. The redshirt junior began
her freshman year at Stanford already
an Olympian and an individual nation
al champion in the 200-meter breaststroke.
As a freshman, she swam to two individual
NCAA titles and was the second-highest
point scorer at the NCAA Championships.
Plagued by a shoulder injury requiring
surgery her sophomore year. Bruce was un
able to compete and was granted a medical
redshirt. Nonetheless, even while recuperat
ing from shoulder surgery as a redshirt soph
omore,she earned two Pac-10 titles, three All-
American honors and helped lead the Stan
ford swimming and diving team to a fourth
place finish at the NCAAs.
This year, Bruce is finally able to train
fully, and appears more than ready to reach
the top once again. The Wichita, Kan. native
sat down with The Daily to talk a bit about
everything ranging from her siblings to Stan
ford swimming to the shoulder injuries she
has dealt with.
Stanford Daily: Take us through a typical day
as a Stanford swimmer, from waking up in the
morning to getting to bed at night.
Caroline Bruce: I wake up at 5:30 [a.m.] and
head to the pool for a 6 a.m. practice. We prac
tice from 6 to 8 a.m., and then I head back to
get some breakfast and (take) a nap before
mv 10 a.m. class. I have class from 10 [a.m.] to

12 [p.m.], and then 1 grab lunch and head to
the training room around 1:45 [p.m.] for
stretching, stim, ultrasound and taping. We
have practice again from 2:30-5:30 [p.m.], and
then I go back to the training room until
about 6:15 [p.m.] for more rehab before head
ing home for dinner and studying.
SD: All three of your siblings are also swim
mers (including brother Michael, who was an
All-American for Stanford). What influence
has that had on you and your swimming ca
reer?
CB: Having all my siblings swim has been
amazing. It has been so great to have them all
there beside me through not only the tri
umphs. but also the many trials. Its really fun
to be able to travel together and be there to
support each other and understand what
we're each going through.
SD: Why did you pick Stanford? Has it lived
up to your expectations?
CB: I picked Stanford for so many reasons.
When I came out here for my recruiting trip. I
absolutely fell in love with the school and
Stanford's ability to combine amazing athlet
ics and academics. There is absolutely no
other school like it in the country. I also loved
how everyone you meet here has something
amazing about them, and how being sur
rounded by so many amazing people really
humbles you. I also love how everyone out
here is striving to do their best and the profes

sors, coaches and peers are there to help you
achieve your goals anil support you along the
way.
SI): What are your plans for after Stanford?
CB: I have two more years left at Stanford
and am a communications major. I would
love to work with media relations or in broad
casting. I love working with people and would
love to do something after graduation that in
volves working with others, although I'm not
really sure what that might entail.
SI): What has been your proudest moment as
a swimmer?
CB: That's hard. I would have to say one of
them was winning my state meet my senior
year of high school by two points and by three
one-hundredths of a second in the last relay.
Also, two months later, making the Olympic
team, when no one — myself included — re
ally thought I had a chance. It made the whole
experience that much more amazing. Lastly,
I'd have to say winning NCAA's my freshman
year, after having such an amazing year at
Stanford. Ending my freshman year with
those wins with my team there supporting me
was a moment I'll always remember.
SI): Describe your experience as a member of
the 2(X)4 US Olympic team.
CB: Being on the Olympic team was such an

amazing experience. One of the neat
est experiences was just being in the
[Olympic] Village surrounded by so
many amazing athletes and realizing
they are they are just like everyone
else. It was so fun to get to meet so
many of them and build relationships
with them, many of whom are some of
my best friends today. I still have days
where 1 look back and wonder how I
ever made the team, and wonder if it
was a dream. 1 thank God every time
I am reminded of that experience for
blessing me with that.
SI): You were forced to redshirt your
sophomore year due to a shoulder in

jury which required surgery. Has that
changed your mentality towards
swimming? Have you had to alter
your training at all?
CB: My redshirt year definitely had a
big impact on my swimming career
and my whole life. When swimming
was taken away from me. it really
made me realize how much 1 loved it
and how I would give anything to be
able to be back with my team com
peting again. It also gave me a differ
ent perspective on being healthy. I
see my health as such a blessing, and
now can see how God can heal my
body and teach me so many things
along the way. My training did
change for a while but now a year and
a half out of surgery, 1 am finally able
to basically fully train along with the
rest of my team, which has been so
amazing!

SI): What arc your predictions for
the Stanford swim team this season?
What goals do you hope to accom
plish this season, both as a team and
personally?
CB: 1 m so blessed to be part of such
an amazing team this year. I am excit
ed to see how the year plays out, and
1 really believe that our team can do
some amazing things. I would love to
win Pac-l()'s again and be back in the
top three at NCA As, both of which I
think are very doable.
As for my individual goals, 1
would love to final again in all three
of my events at NCAAs and do
everything I can to help the team
reach our goals and do the best we
can.

everything I can to help the team
reach our goals and do the best we
can.

Swimmer Caroline Bruce is no stranger
to success. The redshirt junior began
her freshman year at Stanford already
an Olympian and an individual nation
al champion in the 200-meter breaststroke.
As a freshman, she swam to two individual
NCAA titles and was the second-highest
point scorer at the NCAA Championships.
Plagued by a shoulder injury requiring
surgery her sophomore year. Bruce was un
able to compete and was granted a medical
redshirt. Nonetheless, even while recuperat
ing from shoulder surgery as a redshirt soph
omore,she earned two Pac-10 titles, three All-
American honors and helped lead the Stan
ford swimming and diving team to a fourth
place finish at the NCAAs.
This year, Bruce is finally able to train
fully, and appears more than ready to reach
the top once again. The Wichita, Kan. native
sat down with The Daily to talk a bit about
everything ranging from her siblings to Stan
ford swimming to the shoulder injuries she
has dealt with.
Stanford Daily: Take us through a typical day
as a Stanford swimmer, from waking up in the
morning to getting to bed at night.
Caroline Bruce: I wake up at 5:30 [a.m.] and
head to the pool for a 6 a.m. practice. We prac
tice from 6 to 8 a.m., and then I head back to
get some breakfast and (take) a nap before
mv 10 a.m. class. I have class from 10 [a.m.] to

12 [p.m.], and then 1 grab lunch and head to
the training room around 1:45 [p.m.] for
stretching, stim, ultrasound and taping. We
have practice again from 2:30-5:30 [p.m.], and
then I go back to the training room until
about 6:15 [p.m.] for more rehab before head
ing home for dinner and studying.
SD: All three of your siblings are also swim
mers (including brother Michael, who was an
All-American for Stanford). What influence
has that had on you and your swimming ca
reer?
CB: Having all my siblings swim has been
amazing. It has been so great to have them all
there beside me through not only the tri
umphs. but also the many trials. Its really fun
to be able to travel together and be there to
support each other and understand what
we're each going through.
SD: Why did you pick Stanford? Has it lived
up to your expectations?
CB: I picked Stanford for so many reasons.
When I came out here for my recruiting trip. I
absolutely fell in love with the school and
Stanford's ability to combine amazing athlet
ics and academics. There is absolutely no
other school like it in the country. I also loved
how everyone you meet here has something
amazing about them, and how being sur
rounded by so many amazing people really
humbles you. I also love how everyone out
here is striving to do their best and the profes

sors, coaches and peers are there to help you
achieve your goals anil support you along the
way.
SI): What are your plans for after Stanford?
CB: I have two more years left at Stanford
and am a communications major. I would
love to work with media relations or in broad
casting. I love working with people and would
love to do something after graduation that in
volves working with others, although I'm not
really sure what that might entail.
SI): What has been your proudest moment as
a swimmer?
CB: That's hard. I would have to say one of
them was winning my state meet my senior
year of high school by two points and by three
one-hundredths of a second in the last relay.
Also, two months later, making the Olympic
team, when no one — myself included — re
ally thought I had a chance. It made the whole
experience that much more amazing. Lastly,
I'd have to say winning NCAA's my freshman
year, after having such an amazing year at
Stanford. Ending my freshman year with
those wins with my team there supporting me
was a moment I'll always remember.
SI): Describe your experience as a member of
the 2(X)4 US Olympic team.
CB: Being on the Olympic team was such an

amazing experience. One of the neat
est experiences was just being in the
[Olympic] Village surrounded by so
many amazing athletes and realizing
they are they are just like everyone
else. It was so fun to get to meet so
many of them and build relationships
with them, many of whom are some of
my best friends today. I still have days
where 1 look back and wonder how I
ever made the team, and wonder if it
was a dream. 1 thank God every time
I am reminded of that experience for
blessing me with that.
SI): You were forced to redshirt your
sophomore year due to a shoulder in

jury which required surgery. Has that
changed your mentality towards
swimming? Have you had to alter
your training at all?
CB: My redshirt year definitely had a
big impact on my swimming career
and my whole life. When swimming
was taken away from me. it really
made me realize how much 1 loved it
and how I would give anything to be
able to be back with my team com
peting again. It also gave me a differ
ent perspective on being healthy. I
see my health as such a blessing, and
now can see how God can heal my
body and teach me so many things
along the way. My training did
change for a while but now a year and
a half out of surgery, 1 am finally able
to basically fully train along with the
rest of my team, which has been so
amazing!

SI): What arc your predictions for
the Stanford swim team this season?
What goals do you hope to accom
plish this season, both as a team and
personally?
CB: 1 m so blessed to be part of such
an amazing team this year. I am excit
ed to see how the year plays out, and
1 really believe that our team can do
some amazing things. I would love to
win Pac-l()'s again and be back in the
top three at NCA As, both of which I
think are very doable.
As for my individual goals, 1
would love to final again in all three
of my events at NCAAs and do
everything I can to help the team
reach our goals and do the best we
can.
