## Stanford Athletics to open admission to public 
### 
Ihe Stanford Athletic Department will an
nounce its new policy of free admission to the
public for matches in all hut seven Cardinal var
sity sports today. The announcement will he
made by Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby.
The new policy opens all Stanford sporting
events to the public except for the following
sports: football, men's and women's basketball,
women's volleyball, baseball and men's and
women's soccer. As a result of the new policy,
Stanford Athletics will see a minor drop-off in
revenue, but, as Bowlsby explained, the benefits
of making Stanford sports more accessible out
weigh the immediate costs.
"We discussed among senior staff and even
tually came up with this proposal and moved
ahead with it," Bowslby said in an interview with
The Daily. "It was a collaborative process."
"I think the biggest motive [behind the deci
sion] is hoping to have more people access our
events, thereby making it a better environment
for our student athletes."
A number of sports were affected by the new
policy. Among them were men's volleyball,
men's and women's gymnastics, men's and
women's water polo, lacrosse, men's and
women's tennis, Softball, men's and women's
swimming and diving, synchronized swimming,
wrestling and men's and women's track and field
(with the exception of the Stanford Invitational
in April).
Although the All-Axess Pass makes most
athletic events virtually free to students, the new
policy will vastly open up Stanford sports to local
alumni and fans from the surrounding areas.
The announcement by Bowlsby is indicative
of a general trend towards the opening of admis
sion at athletic events: this year. Red Zone mem
bership was made free to students due to contri
butions made by the Ã¼biquitous John Art illaga.
On the whole.coaches across the athletic de
partment were pleased with the decision.
"It gives us more opportunities to bring in
larger groups in the community and it allows the
community to come on campus and watch a lot
more matches without worrying about the cost
of each individual sport." Stanford men's volley
ball coach John Kosty said.' I here's a consensus
that this policy is only going to improve atten
dance across the board for every sport."
