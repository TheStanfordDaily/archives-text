# EARTHQUAKE ROCKS BAY AREA
## University responds to 5.6 magnitude quake 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Stanford's emergency management contingen
cies were activated just after 8 p.m. yesterday,
when a 5.6 magnitude earthquake rocked the
University and sent shock waves across campus.
Officials were quick to reassure students last
night that the situation was under control.
The quake — whose epicenter was in the Dia
blo Range foothills nine miles northeast of San
Jose — set in motion a series of events dictated by
the University's emergency management proto
cols.
"Very shortly after the earthquake was felt,the
University activated its situation, triage and as
sessment team (STAT)." manager of Stanford's
Emergency Management program Keith Perry
said last night. "Members of the STAT team have
checked in and there are no current reports of
damage on Stanford campus."
Perry said the STAT team is one "that activates
when an event occurs to assess the magnitude and

determine if any further action is required."
He also emphasized that his team was in con
trol of the events following the quake, which was
the Bay Area's most powerful tremor since the 6.9
magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake killed 62 peo
ple in October 1989.
"The University is monitoring the situation,"
Perry said at 8:30 p.m.
An hour later. University spokesperson Elaine
Ray reaffirmed that there had been no reports of
damage on campus and that the University had is
sued a number of responses through various out
lets.
"We posted a notice on the University Web
site, the emergency Web site (emergency.stan
ford.edu) and we updated the emergency hotline
at (650) 725-5555," Ray said. "The University will
be open for all scheduled classes, activities and
normal business [today]."

For more than an hour following the 30-second
tremor, cell phones and landlines worked only
sporadically in and around Palo Alto, as residents
and students hurried to the phones to call friends
and loved ones.
Students who felt the tremor did not know how
to respond.
"It was my first earthquake ever." said Sasha
Zbrozek '10. "So it was a totally new experience,
and 1 was really hoping for aftershocks.
"We were standing around talking, and we
kept talking for a while as it kept going," he added.
"Then we blinked, looked around and asked each
other what to do."
While members of the University's emergency
management team mobilized to assess the situa
tion and students wondered what had happened.

The Richter Scale
Magnitude Type Effects
4-4. Light Indoor items shake, no significant damage
5-5. Moderate Slight damage to buildings
6-6. Strong Major damage in populated areas
7-7.9 Major Destructive over large areas

others were quick to downplay the
significance of the quake, which
Emeritus Engineering Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler called "moderate."
"A 5.6 quake is moderate," he
said. "You don't really expect too
much of a problem except in very
poorly constructed buildings."
Krawinkler, who said his son in
San Jose reported no damage in the
city, added that the size of the quake
could be changed when scientists
get a better read on the situation
today.
"When they look at it [today, the
magnitude] may change to 5.5 or

5.4," he said. "It may even be 5.7."
According to the Associated
Press, the effects of the trembler
were felt as far north as Sonoma and
as far east as Sacramento, but the
California Highway Patrol reported
no damages or injuries as a result of
the quake.
In the hours after the initial
shock waves, the U.S. Geological
Survey reported a total of 10 after
shocks — none larger than magni
tude 2.l—and both Caltrain and
BART trains were stopped for a
brief period after 8 p.m. but began
running at restricted speeds soon
after.
