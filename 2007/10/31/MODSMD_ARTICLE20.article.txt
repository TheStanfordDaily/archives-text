# Where is A-Rod going?
## 
### 
Baseball season is over, and the
Red Sox are world champions
for the second time in four years.
And if you never thought you'd have
cause to use the words "Red Sox" and
"dynasty" in the same sentence, then
you aren't alone.
But the big story on Sunday from
Boston's four-game sweep of the Rock
ies wasn't anything on the field. No. it
was the inevitable but nevertheless mo
mentous declaration mid-game that
Yankee mega-star third baseman Alex
Rodriguez would be opting out of his
contract, making him a free agent this
winter.
Leaving out the obvious "A-Rod is a
diva whose upstaging of the finale of
baseball's season on the national stage
was disgraceful" comment, and other
such long-winded and self-serving, holi
er-than-thou complaints,the decision it
self is sure to lead to plenty of intrigue
during the offseason.
Already,the wheels are turning, with
the Dodgers' rumored hiring of ex-
Yankee manager Joe Torre the first
domino to fall in a long chain of specu
lation.
Which begs the question: Is Chavez
Ravine the right place for the game's
premier offensive force?
Or will Arte Moreno and the Angels
finally unleash their monstrous payroll
potential in signing the game's highest
paid player?
Maybe the new Cubs owner will
want to make a statement and shell out
the big bucks for a big bat.
Or perhaps the dark-horse Giants
will decide to keep things comfortable,
and replicate their "build around
Bonds" strategy with a new once-in-a
generation player at its heart.
But regardless of the eventual out
come, the offseason just got a lot more
interesting. Especially considering the
relative paucity of talent on the open
market this offseason. Rodriguez is al
most guaranteed to earn in excess of
$30 million a year, probably for eight or
more years.
Whether that's a wise financial deci
sion for any franchise is up for debate.
But whether it makes for interesting
conversation is a no-brainer. Someone
will give A-Rtxl the money he's asking
for.
I lis 518 career home runs at age 32
mean he'll have the opportunity to
break whatever record number the un
deniably unpopular Barry Bonds even
tually walks away with,and fans will pay
to see that. They will also pay to sec a
team with that kind of presence in the
middle of its lineup compete for playoff
berths and World Series titles.
With three of A-Rod's most likely
destinations in California, the buzz
should be all the louder here on the
West Coast. And who wouldn't like the
opportunity to dream that their team
could add one of the most talented play
ers ever to play the game to its ranks?
So once and for all. let's dispel the
myth that free-agency is somehow bad
for baseball True, in the past fans could
better identify with players who played
in one market for the bulk of their ca
reers. but consider the case of A-Rcxl.
Would baseball be better off if Ro
driguez were still in Seattle, playing for
the Mariners?
No doubt Seattle would, but the
amount of interest Rodriguez has
brought to Texas, New York and soon,
another city, would seem to far out
weigh the concerns of a single market.
Because today, the best players of the
game are there to be seen in every mar
ket, giving hope to every fan.
And at the start of a long, dark base
ball offseason, the prospect of endless
and baseless speculation, coupled with
the inevitable "they paid how much for
him?" backlash that is sure to haunt
whichever team does eventually pull
the trigger suddenly sounds quite inter
esting.
Maybe it's enough to distract us
from an NFL season where we're all
just waiting for the inevitable New Hng
land-lndianapolis AFC Championship
game. Maybe it's enough for us to forget
about a college football season in which
no team seems to be able to actually pull
itself above the level of mediocrity
Maybe it's enough to keep us all enter
tained for the pastime-less months to
come.
At least until they actually start play
ing again.
