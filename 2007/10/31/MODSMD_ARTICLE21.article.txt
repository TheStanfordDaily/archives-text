## Senate postpones vote on Rumsfeld bill 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
ASSU senators decided to post
pone voting on the issue of Donald
Rumsfeld's appointment as a
Hoover Distinguished Fellow until
next week after hearing from a rep
resentative in opposition to his ap
pointment at their meeting last
night.
Laura Wadden '09 attended the
meeting and presented her views
on the Senate's current draft of the
"Resolution to Express Opposition
to the Appointment of Donald
Rumsfeld as a Hoover Distin
guished Fellow." She informed sen
ators that she represented the 4,000
people who have thus far signed
the petition against bringing Rums
feld to the Hoover Institution and
pushed senators to include

stronger language and take more
action in the bill.
"While she claimed that she rep
resents the views of 4,(XX) people, I
wouldn't feel comfortable saying
that all of them share her exact
opinion,'" said Senator Sarah Go
labek-Goldman *10.
"1 do think that it is important
we have a chance to hear our con
stituents' views on this issue," she
added. "1 suggest that Stanford stu
dents contact their senators and
voice their opinions before our
vote next week."
With that idea in mind, the Sen
ate has decided to push back voting
on the matter until next week in
order to give the writer of the bill,
Senator Stuart Baimel '09. more
time to reword the resolution.
"I am for postponing the bill
ritiht now because Stuart himself.

who wrote the bill, wanted to delay
it. If the author himself is not com
fortable. then we should postpone
it," said Senator Jonathan Kass '10.
"Also, [Wadden] pointed out some
flaws in the argumentation of the
bill, so if an extra week makes it a
stronger bill, that is better in the
long run as well."
Aside from discussing the
Rumsfeld bill, senators talked
about pricing for the ASSU Airport
Shuttle service last night. Last year,
students had to pay $5 to reserve a
spot on the shuttle. This year, how
ever, the Senate is planning to raise
the price to $ 10 in order to avoid re
lying on ASSU special fees for
funding.
"We want the project to be self
sustaining," Kass said. "We feel that
by going to special fees, the ASSU
Shuttle service will essentially have

a hidden cost to students. If the proj
ect is self-sustaining, we no longer
have to go to the reserve, which is
better in the long run."
Regarding the price change,
Kass said that $10 is still half the
price of a Super Shuttle and more
convenient than Caltrain.The Sen
ate will vote on the hill to finance
the ASSU Airport Shuttle service
next week as well.
In addition, the senators passed
a hill "Urging the Creation of a
FLiCKs Policy Board," and sena
tors will be in White Plaza next
Wednesday through Friday from
noon to 1 p.m. handing out bike
lights to students as part of the Bike
Light Extravaganza.
