### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an attempt to capitalize on the
hours students spend on Facebook
each day. Student Computing is
sponsoring a contest this fall, for
which students can develop applica
tions to promote Stanford student
life using Facebook s application
platform.
ITiese applications will further
highlight how Web 2.0 — the second
generation of Web-based communi
ties — and social networking tech
nologies like Facebook can empower
students and others within the Stan
ford community to collaborate and
build communities.
"In the spirit of Web 2.0. we hope
that having students participate di
rectly in the development process
will empower them and encourage
collaboration.sharing and communi

ty building." said Sindy J. Lee '01,
software engineering manager of
Student Computing.
"While we could have developed
and distributed our own applica
tions, we thought students them
selves would be the best ones to
think of applications that would be
engaging, interesting and useful to
the Stanford community." she added.
The deadline to enter the contest
is Dec. 12. Individuals or student
teams of up to three people are invit
ed to submit entries in a variety of
categories, including residential life,
community building.course manage
ment, libraries, student
activities/groups, student events, aca
demic life and alumni relations.
These entries will be judged by facul
ty and staff from departments all
over campus as well as selected stu
dent volunteers.
Lee is excited to be involved in or
ganizing this initiative, which will
make use of Facebook and other so
cial networking and Web 2.0 tools to
fulfill academic and community
building goals.

"We hope that students will really
he creative and develop some great
apps that, whether they win a prize or
not. will get out there to benefit the
Stanford community and in turn, ed
ucate us [Student Computing] on
how students want to use Facebook,"
she said.
Student Computing has been in
contact with Facebook, which is not
only contributing prizes, but will also
be holding a developer workshop on
campus in a couple of weeks. Poten
tial prizes for the most engaging and
useful application may include an
iPhone or iPod Touch. iPod or other
portable digital music player, an
XBox 360 or other gaming console
and a bicycle.
Rahul Agarwal '10 praised the
contest, but said that he was not en
thusiastic to be a participant himself.
"1 feel that the Facebook apps
clutter the site, but if they are being
used for something engaging and
productive, the initiative is com
mendable," he said. "However. I
don't think I'd have the time to par
ticipate in the contest."
