## Hospital newsletter engages community 
### ASHLEY KAMIURA 
Stanford Hospital, Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and the
Stanford School of Medicine have
combined efforts to reach out to the
community through a new publica
tion mailed last week.
Stanford Medicine News is a
short newsletter to be published
three times per year with the purpose
of mending the disconnect presently
felt between the University and the
community. It will be mailed to Stan
ford undergraduate students, as well
as registered voters in Palo Alto and
its surrounding communities.
" ITiere has been talk among the
leadership of both hospitals and the
Med School for almost four years
now about the need to do a better job
communicating with the local com
munity." said Ruthann Richter. di
rector of media relations for the
Medical School and chief coordina
tor of the newsletter.
"We are specifically trying to
make Stanford Medicine News con
sumer-oriented using the news-that
you-can-use approach." she contin
ued. "We want to include stories we
think would be personally relevant
to community members."
Last week's eight-page issue was
actually the second of the year and

was sent to approximately 85.0(H) in
dividuals. It included stories on the
new $4 million Simulation Center
that allows Stanford residents to
practice surgical procedures before
performing them in the real operat
ing room, as well as on a new study
that found that children prefer the
taste of food branded with McDon
ald's to generic brands.
ITie issue's centerpiece, however,
was a feature on the proposed mod
ernization and replacement of Stan
ford Hospital, Lucille Packard Chil
dren's Hospital and the School of
Medicine, an issue that was a key fac
tor in the decision to increase dia
logue between the University and
the community.
"Community input is an integral
component of the [Stanford Univer
sity] Renewal and Replacement Pro
ject," according to the project's offi
cial Web site.
The plan was officially announced
this past August but has yet to be ap
proved by the City of Palo Alto. It
calls for a complete rebuilding of the
Stanford Hospital and Emergency
Room to meet seismic standards and
capacity needs, as well as a modern
ization and expansion of Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and re
placement of the School of Medi
cine.
In addition to covering the ex
pansion project, the publication will
provide details on free health-relat
ed educational events open to the
public, as well as information on on
going services such as the Child Car
Seat Fitting Station at the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
"We want to touch on topics we
think will provide some substance
and really capture the interests of a
wide audience," Richter said. This
includes updates on the latest treat

ments required by many communi
ty members who receive the
newsletter, as well as news on the
most up-to-date research being
done at the School of Medicine, a
topic that will attract some under
graduates.
"I think the newsletter is long
overdue because Stanford is one of
the premier places in the country to
study health topics as an undergrad
uate student, and it's a shame that
opportunities for collaboration are
being missed due to lack of commu
nication," said Danielle Schoffman
"08. "1 thought the newsletter was
informative and a good step in the
right direction."
