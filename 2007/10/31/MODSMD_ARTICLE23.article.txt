## Hospital newsletter engages community 
### ASHLEY KAMIURA 
Stanford Hospital, Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and the
Stanford School of Medicine have
combined efforts to reach out to the
community through a new publica
tion mailed last week.
Stanford Medicine News is a
short newsletter to be published
three times per year with the purpose
of mending the disconnect presently
felt between the University and the
community. It will be mailed to Stan
ford undergraduate students, as well
as registered voters in Palo Alto and
its surrounding communities.
" ITiere has been talk among the
leadership of both hospitals and the
Med School for almost four years
now about the need to do a better job

practice surgical procedures before
performing them in the real operat

that found that children prefer the
taste of food branded with McDon

ITie issue's centerpiece, however,
was a feature on the proposed mod
ernization and replacement of Stan
ford Hospital, Lucille Packard Chil
dren's Hospital and the School of
Medicine, an issue that was a key fac

the community.
"Community input is an integral
component of the [Stanford Univer
sity] Renewal and Replacement Pro
ject," according to the project's offi
cial Web site.
The plan was officially announced
this past August but has yet to be ap
proved by the City of Palo Alto. It
calls for a complete rebuilding of the
Stanford Hospital and Emergency
Room to meet seismic standards and
capacity needs, as well as a modern
