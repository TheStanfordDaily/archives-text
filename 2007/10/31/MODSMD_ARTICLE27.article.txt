A boy playing with matches start
ed a fire in north Los Angeles
County that consumed more than
38.000 acres and destroyed 21
homes, authorities said Tiiesday.
The boy. whose name and age
were not released, was interviewed
a day after the Buckweed Fire was
sparked Oct. 21. said sheriffs Sgt.
Diane 1 lecht.
"He admitted to playing with
matches and accidentally starting
the fire," Hecht said in a statement.
The boy was released to his par
ents, and the case will he presented
to the district attorney's office, the
sergeant said. She said she didn't
know whether he was arrested or
cited by detectives.
The fire began in an area near
Agua Dulce and quickly spread by
fierce desert winds. It was among
more than a dozen major wildfires
that killed 14 people, destroyed
some 2.100 homes and blackened
809 square miles from Los Angeles

to the Mexican border last week.
Authorities arrested five peo
ple for arson during that period,
but none have been linked to any
of the major blazes.
They said an arsonist also set a
destructive wildfire in Orange
County that blackened 28.500
acres and destroyed 16 homes. In
vestigators believe the blaze was
deliberately set because they
found two ignition points within a
short distance - a common sign of
arson.
Authorities were seeking the
driver of a white Ford F-150 pick
up truck spotted in a canyon area
around the time the Santiago Fire
broke out. They said they wanted
to talk to the driver, but stopped
short of calling the person a sus
pect.
Officials offered a $285,000 re
ward to anyone with information
that will lead to an arrest and con
viction.
Firefighters had surrounded all
but four of the blazes late Tuesday,
and the remaining ones were more
than 90 percent contained.
