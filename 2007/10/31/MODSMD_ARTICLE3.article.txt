## Prof, puts gaming to work New program applies economic concepts to office email exchange 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After studying the virtual worlds
in games like "Second Life" and
"World ofWarcraft,"a question nat
urally arose for Communication
Prof. Byron Reeves: can these com
plex and immensely popular inter
action systems be used for anything
other than entertainment?
Enter Seriosity, a company dedi
cated to applying the ideas and eco
nomics of popular online games to
real-world workplaces. Founded
three years ago by Reeves and ven
ture capitalist Leighton Reed, the
company aims to bring popular
gaming features into the workplace
to increase the enjoyment and effi
ciency of workers.
The two founders met on a local
pool deck, when both of their
daughters were on the same swim
team. After about a year of tossing
ideas back and forth about game
psychology as applied to serious
work. Reeves and Reed decided to
form a company to focus their ideas
into products.
"We had all kinds of ideas about
how sales teams or call centers
might actually go to work in one of
those environments," Reeves said.
"Lessons learned from these online
games can be applied to the work
place. making it more efficient, and
even more fun."
Due to the complexity of the
gaming systems, as well as security
concerns, they began on the other
end — rather than bring work into
the online games. Reeves decided to
take pieces of the games to the
workplace.
Seriosity is currently perfecting
its initial offering, an email applica
tion called Attent. Simon Roy, CEO
and president of Seriosity, explained
that while Attent looks very much
like email, there is a change to the
system that makes traditional email
more effective and efficient by in
troducing a virtual currency — the
"serio" — that can be attached to
emails to denote importance.
For example, in a business setting
each employee is allotted 100 serios
per week and can use them to accen
tuate certain particularly important
emails in the inboxes of colleagues.
If employees run out of serios, they
can still send email, just not with the
added importance of the virtual
serio coins, Roy explained.
While employees can borrow se
rios from their co-workers, or simply
send emails without a value attach
ment. the addition brings an impor
tant economic change in the very
nature of email, according to Roy.
"You need to think about how
you use your serios the way you
would think about money," Roy
said. "By introducing scarcity, you
make sure that people don't overuse
the signal. It brings economic order
to email."
In the early stages of develop
ment. and through the program's
implementation, serio usage pat
terns will be tracked by economists
to ensure that real world economic
problems — like inflation — don't
occur. The economists can imple
ment various taxes to even out any
problems that arise.
The idea is that lower impor
tance emails — like FYIs or re
minders — will be given less atten
tion via fewer attached serios, there
by placing emphasis on more impor
tant emails with more attached se-

rios. Attent aims to reduce some
thing called "informational over
load," a term used to describe a situ
ation in which people are presented
with entirely too much information
to comprehend, thus hurting their
productivity, Roy said.
The use of serio leader boards
and various achievement badges
mimic a gaming feedback system
without becoming too "gamey,"
Reeves said.
Currently, Seriosity is still in beta

testing with a number of Fortune

500 companies, Roy said. Se-

riosity has yet to go public and

Roy declined to reveal specifi-

cally which companies have

begun to use Attent. saying only

that they included technology.

hardware, consulting and financial
businesses.
Many students were intrigued by
the idea of changing the workplace
to resemble a game but some held
doubts as to the effectiveness of Se
riosity's new Attent program, espe
cially in their own lives.
"I don't know if [Attent] would
make it easier on me, because most
of the emails I get aren't labeled as
important anyway," said Ben Dallas
Trammell '09. "I can pretty much
sort it out."
"Why is it important to make
someone pay more to send an im
portant email," he added. "What if
it's last minute and you don't have
the coins you need"
Trammell, who claims to receive
1,000 emails a week, said that often
a subject header is enough to indi
cate any pressing importance.
Seriosity is already looking to the
future of virtual applications for the
workplace. Reeves noted that in the
modern business world, and even in
modern society, collaboration can
be difficult or even boring. By using
virtual methods of communication,
society can adapt and benefit from
collaboration.
"Our goal is to change the nature
of work, to make work more fun,
more productive," Reeves said. "But
you can only change things one ap
plication at a time."
