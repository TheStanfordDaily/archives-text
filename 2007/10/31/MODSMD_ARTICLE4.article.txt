## Duo explores lives of homeless 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
San Francisco Chronicle reporter Kevin
Fagan and photographer Brant Ward spoke to
Stanford students last night about chronic
homelessness. giving their opinions on effec
tive responses to the issue.The pair shared per
sonal stories and images with an audience in
cluding members of Stanford Project on
Hunger (SPOON). Stanford in Government
(SIG) and Night Outreach, among others.
Fagan and Ward's five-part homelessness
series "Shame of the City" ran in the San Fran
cisco ( hronicle from 2003 to2oo6,when Fagan
took a year off from the Chronicle to be a
Knight Fellow at Stanford. When the project
started, there had not been regular coverage of
the homeless population anywhere in the
country for more than 20 years.
"Our bosses at the Chronicle said take as
long as you need on this issue," Fagan said." We
did not anticipate the [beat] lasting three
years."
Ihe duo documented the lives of homeless
people in the Tenderloin district and other
parts of San Francisco, including families living
in vans, crack addicts who went in and out of
rehab, prostitutes and mentally disabled peo

pie. Through their work they formed close at
tachments with their subjects.
"To get pictures of people shooting heroin
into their necks â€” it takes weeks to develop
these kinds of friendships," Ward said. "When
you go.to that effort to get to know someone,
you get to care about them."
"Its OK to be a human while you're report
ing." Fagan added.
About one third of their closest interview
subjects, Fagan and Ward learned, died after
they were interviewed.
l"hrough their personal encounters,the pair
quickly came to see that homelessness was not
an issue that could be solved overnight.
"It became clear to us that homelessness is
not just a problem because you don't have a
place to live," Fagan said. "It happens because
you don't have a way to deal with your ail
ment. be it alcoholism, addiction, mental ill
ness, so you don't have a way to stay in the
place you're living."
The way to fix the vicious cycle. Fagan and
Ward said, is through supportive housing,
which would involve placing people with ad
dictions inside shelters and bringing counsel
ing services on site to deal with ailments the
homeless suffer from. My maintaining regular
daily care of people suffering from ailments

that lead to homelessness, they argued, social
workers have a much better chance of making
a lasting impact than police or rehab centers.
Fagan described San Francisco Mayor
Gavin Newsom's new program called "Care
Not Cash." which aims to implement support
ive housing policies in San Francisco, a city no
torious for its large and visible homeless popu
lation. Other cities, including London, New
York, Philadelphia and Denver, are exploring
similar methods of supportive housing to ad
dress the needs of their homeless populations.
In the last three years, there has been a 40
percent drop in homelessness nationwide,
Fagan said. The publicity associated with the
"Shame of the City" series brought much
needed attention to the issue.
"The stories that we did provided people
with statistics and examples that helped point
people towards solutions." he said. "It had an
impact from the highest to lowest levels of gov
ernment and continues to have an effect."
At the conclusion of the slideshow and talk,
students showed interest in discussing the
issue further. Several returned back to dorms
for discussions led by their Service Outreach
Coordinators. Event coordinator Tommy


Kevin Fagan and Brant Ward of the SF Chronicle addressed the issue of homelessness last night before an audience of Stanford community
service groups. The pair shared insights gained from close interaction with the homeless and suggestions for mitigating the problem in the future.
