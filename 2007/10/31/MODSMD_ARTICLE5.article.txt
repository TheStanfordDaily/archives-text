## Performing arts center to be built Center, nearby theater will constitute "arts district" 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As part of the University's plans to estab
lish an "arts district" in the vicinity of the
Cantor Arts Center, a New York design firm
has been selected to develop plans for a new
( )00-seat performing arts center between
Campus Drive and Lasuen Street.
Scheduled to open by 2012. the perform
ing arts center will eventually be joined by an
adjacent 500-seat theater,an outdoor theater
garden and a cafe with informal perform
ance spaces available. The University envi
sions that these buildings will make this area
the center of lively arts on campus. Polshek
Partnership Architects of New York was se
lected to design the performing arts center
following a five-month review process.
"Construction of the [performing arts
center] should begin in about two years and
will last for about two years." Assistant Vice
President for Arts Karen Nagy wrote in an
email to The Daily. "The time between now
and then will be spent designing the facility
and getting the construction documents
completed and approved."
Once completed, the performing arts cen
ter is expected to provide a venue for a vari
ety of theater, dance, vocal, concert and other
artistic performances from Stanford Lively
Arts and the Department of Music,as well as
for any number of student groups and visit
ing outside performers. Nagy claimed that
the development of the performing arts cen
ter is just one part of the Stanford Arts Initia
tive, which "seeks to strengthen arts pro
grams across the campus, both within the ex
isting arts departments and through the stu
dent residences."
Polshek Design partner Richard Olcott
said that his design team is about to begin the
designing phase of the project. While actual
blueprints for the project are still a ways off,
Olcott said that, after discussing the project
with members of Lively Arts, his team does
have an idea of what it is looking to accom
plish.
"I think one thing that is very important
to everyone there is the preservation
of the natural landscape," Olcott
said, referring to the wooded areas
surrounding the planned site. "An
other thing that has been clear in our
talks with Lively Arts is accessibility."
Because of the proximity of the
proposed center to Campus Drive
and one of the main entrances to
campus, Olcott said his team was
looking to make the structure appear
as welcoming as possible. Further
more. he claimed they will try to form
the aesthetics of the center with the
theme of Stanford in mind.

"We're going to try to do both," he
said. "I think it will be a frankly mod
ern building, but we'll also try to
make it fit in with the historic design
of the campus."
Stanford currently has several
venues available for live perform
ance, including Memorial Auditori
um. Pigott Theater. Roble Gym and
several others. With the construction
of the performing arts center and its
adjacent structures, the artistic hub of
campus may shift largely to the area
surrounding Cantor, but Nagy does
not expect the shift in focus to hasten
the abandonment of the older struc
tures.
"line demand for performance
spaces on campus is great," she said.
"At this point we assume that most of
the current performance venues will

continue to be used for that purpose,
with facilities upgrades as needed
and possible."
William Von Hoene '08 agreed.
"This initiative is an important
one, given that there always seems to
be a crunch for student performance
spaces," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "More space is more freedom,
more freedom is more fun, more fun
is more creativity, more creativity is
more love."
Polshek Design will collaborate
with Nagata Acoustics and Fisher
Dachs Associates on the performing
arts center project. The project has
been financed through a $50 million
gift from Helen and Peter Bine'ss.
