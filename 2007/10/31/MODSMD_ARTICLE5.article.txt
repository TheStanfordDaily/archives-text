### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As part of the University's plans to estab
lish an "arts district" in the vicinity of the
Cantor Arts Center, a New York design firm
has been selected to develop plans for a new
( )00-seat performing arts center between
Campus Drive and Lasuen Street.
Scheduled to open by 2012. the perform
ing arts center will eventually be joined by an
adjacent 500-seat theater,an outdoor theater
garden and a cafe with informal perform
ance spaces available. The University envi
sions that these buildings will make this area
the center of lively arts on campus. Polshek
Partnership Architects of New York was se
lected to design the performing arts center
following a five-month review process.
"Construction of the [performing arts
center] should begin in about two years and
will last for about two years." Assistant Vice
President for Arts Karen Nagy wrote in an
email to The Daily. "The time between now
and then will be spent designing the facility
and getting the construction documents
completed and approved."
Once completed, the performing arts cen
ter is expected to provide a venue for a vari
ety of theater, dance, vocal, concert and other
artistic performances from Stanford Lively
Arts and the Department of Music,as well as
for any number of student groups and visit
ing outside performers. Nagy claimed that
the development of the performing arts cen
ter is just one part of the Stanford Arts Initia
tive, which "seeks to strengthen arts pro
grams across the campus, both within the ex
isting arts departments and through the stu
dent residences."
Polshek Design partner Richard Olcott
said that his design team is about to begin the
designing phase of the project. While actual
blueprints for the project are still a ways off,
Olcott said that, after discussing the project
with members of Lively Arts, his team does
have an idea of what it is looking to accom
