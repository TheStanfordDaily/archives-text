## Dazed and confused 
### 
This weekend. I
found myself
at the GSB
Halloween party. It
was — as hard as this
is for me to say —
not bad; in fact, 1
might even uo so far

as to say it was good. People were having fun. There was a
male-female ratio considerably better than that found in
your typical graduate student affair (i.e., a lot to not very
many). And somehow, I didn't find myself standing in a
corner, counting down the minutes until the experience
was over.
It's hard not to be in awe of the business school, its par
ties and its denizens. Not because they're smart. Or be
cause they're successful. Or even because they're wealthy.
No, the thing that's most impressive is just how good-look
ing they are.
They are especially striking when compared to the rest
of Stanford's graduate population, who are distinctly aver
age (except, of course, for my fellow physicists, all of whom
glow with. ah. inner beauty). Faced with such a contrast, we
must ask ourselves two questions:"Why?" and "How can 1
get some?"
The first question is very difficult and. of course, worthy
of a serious and lengthy contemplation... But. it's really not
that interesting. The second question on the other hand,
well, that's also a hard ond, but in the process of studying it
we can learn a lot about our friends at the GSB.
1 have spent many years trying to get an insider's view
of the b-school and finally (after several large bribes and a
blackmail incident involving a dog, a tube of toothpaste,
some steel wool and a handful of incriminating photo
graphs) 1 have an old college buddy as a newly-minted
'Year One' — and my ticket in to watch the big boys play.
Even once you get past the toned bodies and polished
smiles, it is clear that MBAs are just not like the rest of us.
To begin with, they appear worryingly happy. As we've es
tablished previously, happiness is a very dangerous beast.
It must be carefully controlled or it will contaminate the
population at large, with horrific consequences.
It's not just the happiness either. The majority of us at
grad school have come to acquire knowledge. We may not
use that knowledge for anything particularly useful, but it's
still the reason we're here. On the other hand. I have yet to
witness a single person at the business school perform the
wide-eyed graduate student act of waxing lyrical about a
subject that only four people in the world care about.
Now. it's not that they don't work a lot — they do.
There's a lot of homework, and class attendance is manda
tory (which is particularly amusing,considering how much
they pay to be here); it's just that knowledge is not the rai
son d'etre of the b-school.
So what is?
Well, as far as 1 can tell, it's socializing. 1 may be wrong,
but it appears that a single night does not go by without
some kind of organized social activity. It's a bit like summer
camp, except with more alcohol and kissing behind the
boat sheds.
Actually, summer camp is not quite the perfect analogy.
No, given the relative weight of social status and intellectu
al endeavor, along with the extraordinary intensity of gos
sip. I think we can safely consider the GSB as a re-imagin
ing of high school.
Still, while teenagers scurrying around the halls might
not live up to my definition of a grad student (a lazy unem
ployed pseudo-intellectual with pretensions of grandeur),
I must concede that all the socializing is good practice — as
ably demonstrated by their Halloween bash, these folks re
ally do know how to throw a good party.
The real impressive thing here, though, is the remark
able contrast with your typical event organized by the GSC
almost all of which are terrible. Now. this is not the
GSC's fault, it's the fault of the graduate student popula
tion at large — we're not very good at playing with others
and when approached, we retreat to the safety of our sub
jects.
Maybe this is the heart of the difference between us and
them. Most of us really aren't that well-adjusted. We're ob
sessed with work and departmentally insular to a degree
seen only in leper colonies.
The b-school bunch, however, seem fairly normal.They
do normal things and say normal stuff. In fact now that I
think about, it's not so much that they're remarkably dif
ferent. It's just that we're remarkably odd.

sleep with and. with that in mind, let me just say that anyone at
