# Reduce, reuse, resell
## GSB grad helps students recycle online 
### MIKE DING 
Oladayo Olagunju has gone
green, and he's taking Stanford
— and its piles of waste — with
him.
Amidst efforts on campus to imple
ment a zero waste policy, Olagunju has
established a high tech startup with the
same goal. His company,Techtain, allows
students to dispose of unwanted items in
a more environmentally friendly way —
by giving them to other students.
"Seeing the amount of waste that
turns out from colleges is just incredi
ble," said Olagunju. "Almost all of this
waste goes to landfills, which are harmful
to the environment. After I found that
colleges in the U.S. account for 40% of all
landfill waste. 1 thought.'we have to do
something about this.'"
Olagunju, a recent business school
graduate, began developing the compa
ny when inspiration struck in his first
year here.
"Why is Joe in a dormitory trashing
an item that can be reused by someone
two doors away from him?" he said. "Joe
does not necessarily think he's being en
vironmentally unfriendly. He just does
n't know who else could use that item."
Olagunju imagined a service that
would inform individuals of both what
those around them were searching for. as
well as what they were getting ready to
throw away.
"Tech Tain automatically gives infor
mation to you as long as you tell it what
you're looking for." he said. "For exam
ple, suppose I'm looking for a DVD play
er; then you'll get a notification about me
because you'd told us a few days ago that
you're trying to get rid of a DVD player."
When it started two years ago, Tech

tain was a local company, but it has now

expanded to other campuses.
"When you think about
the market, all you have to
ask is; how many people
on this earth have

haves, and how many
have wants?" he said.
"Well, all people
have haves and
wants. The question

is, how many people
are willing to part
with their stuff, and
how do you get them
in touch with the
people who want that
stuff?"

While Olagunju
admitted that eßay
and Craigslist offered
similar services, he
pointed out a funda
mental difference be
tween Techtain and

other reallocation services:
Techtain was built on a green

premise, designed to solve environ
mental problems using an economic
strategy.
"We realized that on eßay, people
wanted something for money," he said.
"On Techtain, people actually have an
emotional connection with their things,
and often they give people stuff for free.
We have a system in place which gives
people points based on how many things
they've given for free in the past two or
three weeks. These points can then be
used to get discounts on public business
es."
As for the future, Olagunju ultimate

ly wants to expand the service beyond
schools.
"If you think about it, mathematical
ly. the statistical probability of finding
two people with matches of wants and
haves becomes greater if you don't local
ize the location," he said.
But Olagunju said that they would
keep the general public market separate
from the college market.

"We don't
want to mix
student circles
with non-stu
dents," he said.
"The value of

'only students'
is that vou know

your friend Billy is just
two blocks away, so that's
what makes it different
from Craigslist."
Because of the prem-

ise on which it was founded — as well as
its emphasis on smaller communities —
Olagunju believes it may be the only
company in this field.
"This might just be the first time that
someone has tried to tackle the issue of
sustainability with reallocation," he
said.
