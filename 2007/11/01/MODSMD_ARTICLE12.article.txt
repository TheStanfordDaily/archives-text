## Editorial Board Longing for IHUM 
### 
There's an old adage,"longer is better,"
that is often misapplied or incorrect.
When it comes to the length of Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) sections,
however, longer truly is better.
Last year's IHUM self-study evaluated stu
dent input from five informal focus groups,
1.283 online survey respondents and a number
of IHUM professors and Teaching Fellows.
Ihe study noted many students' grievances
with the 90-minute sections and recommend
ed that the IHUM Governance Board "delete
the stipulation of 90-minute discussion
groups." Following this recommendation, this
year's IHUM courses were trimmed from five
to four units and now have two 50-minute dis
cussion sections per week. 'ITiis reduction,
however, is detrimental to students and to the
program's stated goal of the "development of
diverse analytical and critical skills for inter
pretation of primary texts."
The most obvious reason why shortening
discussion sections negatively impacts the
IHUM experience is a matter of "too much
material, not enough time." The readings re
main as long as ever, and when a student
knows that most of what he read outside of
class will not be covered in section, he experi
ences little incentive to complete the reading.
If a student is expected to read a 60-page
Supreme Court case or an entire treatise on
political philosophy, he should have more than
50 minutes to discuss the myriad issues that a
close reading of the text inevitably produces.
Often, sections become animated as a stu
dent seizes upon a particular issue and pursues
it. This is precisely the point of such discussion
groups, and to restrict discussion to a strict
agenda is harmful. It is unfortunate that the
new time limitations prohibit both this free
ranging discussion and the ability to bring up
more lhan a few points in pages and pages oi
reading material.
Already, many students, believing it unnec
essary to work as hard in a "fuzzy" class as in a
"techie" course, skim or ignore the reading.
Limiting time to discuss the reading appears to
further devalue the importance of the close
textual analysis II lUM hopes to teach.
There are, of course, objections to longer
section periods, and the opposition was strong
enough to lead to this year's restructuring.
Iliese objections fall into two categories: logis
tical and personal.

Logistically,the 90-minute IHUM sections
do present scheduling problems, as many
other classes have 50-minute periods and thus
conflict with IHUM. However, the sheer
quantity of classes at Stanford enables stu
dents to construct a schedule with longer sec
tions. Alternatively, introducing three 50-
minute sections would not cause such sched
ule conflicts. Others complain about the in
flexibility imposed on a freshman's schedule
by the mandatory IHUM and Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) classes and (he
expansion of chemistry and economics core
classes to two quarters. I lowever, the vast ma
jor i ty of time in college is not spent in class, an d
a mere additional hour per week would not
significantly decrease flexibility; 111UM cours
es have been scheduled in an attempt to avoid
conflict with large lectures such as introducto
ry chemistry and economics.The concern that
IHUM takes up too large a portion of an in
coming freshman's schedule, especially those
in majors requiring many prerequisites, is, per
haps, addressed by downscaling the course to
four units, but that need not bear on a single
hour of section per week.
Ihe more personal reasons for shortening
IIIUM sections — that the discussions be
came boring and unproductive — are the un
fortunate byproducts of IHUM's mandatory
status and the course's stigma as unnecessary
and difficult for those who aren't already tal
ented writers. Allowing more class time would
encourage students to prepare for class and do
the reading, leading to more stimulating dis
cussions and decreasing boredom.
lIIUM, as last year's self-study revealed, is
generally achieving its educational goals of
sharpening critical thinking and aiding fresh
man in transitioning to a college level. It has its
supporters and detractors in both humanities
and more technically oriented students. The
decision to shorten section times does little to
change scheduling flexibility issues and dis
courages students from engaging completely
with the texts in and out of class. For this rea
son. IHUM sections should once again be 90
minutes (or possibly expanded to include
three 50-minute sections). Turns out that old
adage is right after all.
