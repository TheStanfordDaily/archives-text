# Short and sweet: IHUMs that work
## 
### 
There is another adage that reads,"lt's
not how long it is, it's what you do with
it." which, unlike the "longer is bet
ter" philosophy that my colleagues adhere
to. actually truly does apply to Introduction
to Humanities (IIIUM) sections.
IHUM is notoriously boring, a reputa
tion it has earned over many years of stu
dent complaints. So why make a bad thing
worse by unnecessarily extending the length
of its sections?
Champions of the old 90-minute setup
argue that the extended length was vital for
in-depth discussion. In reality, shorter dis
cussions lead to spontaneous, out-of-class
student study groups, which involve more
engaging analysis that is unpolluted by time
pressures or self-consciously muted by the
perceived judgment of the Teaching Fellow.
Independent analysis in small student
formed discussion groups allows for the can
did articulation of more independent and
thoroughly expounded ideas.
There are also those who believe that
longer discussions encourage more consis
tent and close reading of course material,
but wouldn't these longer sections give stu
dents the impression that all necessary ma
terial for the exam will be covered in section
(and thereby discourage close reading)?
Furthermore, shorter sections necessitate
conciseness and the ability to weed out ex

traneous information — two crucial analyt
ical traits. Rather than spend an hour and a
half talking about irrelevant detains, shorter
50-niinute sections allow for more directed
reading.
It is true that big introductory classes in
subjects like economics and chemistry do
not conflict with lllUM.and the Registrar
would likely continue to schedule I HUM
sections around these classes even if they
were expanded. Instead, the longer co
mmute blocks would conflict with an in
creased number of seminars and colloquia
the kinds of small, intimate classes which
freshmen should be encouraged to take and
which instill the intellectual skills that
I HUM attempts to teach.
Last year's IHUM self-study concluded
that "lIII'M provides a common experi
ence — though not a core list of mandated
readings — for all Stanford freshmen." The
phrase "common experience" is used re
peatedly in the survey, but uniting freshmen
by presenting them with a common enemy
should not be one of IHUM's goals. Rather,
lIIIJM sections should remain short so as to
let freshmen make "what they do with it" as
fulfilling as possible.
