## The
						Barack Obama pre-post-modern 
### 
Hillary Clinton is not the inevitable, un
stoppable candidate some make her
out to be. She is pulling away from the
others in polls and her fundraising numbers
are better than ever, but two months is an
eternity in politics and Barack Obama still
has a colossal amount of money. Anyone who
thinks 60 days of news coverage and $30 mil
lion can't produce a 10-point swing in the
polls at this stage has simply not paid atten
tion to a presidential race before. Bill Clinton,
perhaps, put it best in 1992: "Though 1 was
running dead last in the [New Hampshire]
polls in mid-November, I liked my chances."
Obama still has a decent shot, but the cam
paign has work to do and they know it. Look
ing at the polling data — and blogger and po
litical analyst Chris Bowers just published a
great article on this — the demographic that
hasn't yet committed to Hillary Clinton is the
Democratic "creative class:" urban, liberal,
well-educated, middle or upper-middle class
professionals and knowledge workers. In
other words, people like me. It's true: I
haven't decided who 1 am going to vote for
when I go to the polls in three months.
One thing that won't win my vote is the
strategy the Obama campaign just an

nounced — sharpening the differences they
see between them and Hillary Clinton, which
is politics-speak for attacking her positions
and record. I have seen 15 years of cash regis
ter magazine covers about Hillary Clinton
giving birth to two-headed bats, murdering
her staffers and having lesbian affairs with
other celebrities. More money has been spent
demonizing her than any other living person.
In spite of all the mudslinging, I still have
enormous respect for her, and nothing
Barack Obama or anyone else says will
change my mind. That new tactic won't work
— I've already heard it all. So how can Team
Obama win my vote?

What I'm looking for is leadership. I want
a candidate whose ideas excite me, who I be
lieve can have a transformational impact. I
want someone who talks about the environ

ment like A 1 Gore, about poverty like John
Edwards, about eivil liberties like Chris
Dodd, about healthcare, frankly, like Michael
Moore or Dennis Kucinich. And so do the
supporters of John Edwards, A 1 Gore, Chris
Dodd, Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich —
these are real voters lip for grabs. If Obama
got the John Edwards people and the A 1
Gore holdouts he would be neck-and-neck
with Clinton.
And why not get them? Barack Obama is
the best talker out there. If anyone can per
suade Americans not to listen to the naysay
ers on universal health care, progressive job
creation policies and aggressive environmen
tal efforts, it's Barack Obama. Americans
broadly support these goals, but every time a
specific proposal comes up their worries are
stoked by oil companies, automakers, health
insurance companies and so on. Barack
Obama could soothe these worries and bring
people together in a way Miliary Clinton
might not be able to.
As it is, the Obama campaign has been
about him as a person — he is the feel-good
