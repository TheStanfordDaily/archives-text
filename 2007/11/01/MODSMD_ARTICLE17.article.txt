## Dirrrty, scandalous bathrooms

Editor's note: This column was mostly in
spired by Ziv's time sport at UC-Berkeley.
While acknowledging that the bathrooms at
Stanford are generally a considerable im
provement, he warns that the conditions de
scribed could be present in any public rest
room.
As I lay my hare ass across cold porce
lain every night, a lot of questions
run through my mind. Do bath
rooms necessarily have to he dirty, ugly
places? Why do some public restrooms turn
into low-grade hiohazards hy the end of the
day? We spend a lot of time in bathrooms,
so I want to devote some love to the room
that takes such good care of us.
Since I'm a guy. I can only adequately ad
dress male restrooms. In terms of dirtiness. I
understand the technical issues of aiming
and the occasional loss of control that leaves
the floor draining more fluid than the toilet,
but does that excuse the poo th;it altogether
missed the toilet? Or the misspelled racist
comments fighting for space with the penis
drawings and the impromptu hlowjob clas
sifieds on the stall walls?

I've developed a theory called the "Acci
dental Territorial Trigger Hypothesis."
Dirty male bathrooms are a combination of
callousness, instinct and the inherent error
involved in transporting urine from the
male toolkit to the inside of a toilet from a
standing position. Situations typically
evolve like this:
ITie bathrooms start clean, then one guy.
either from disrespect to society or a simple
miscalculation of distance, ends up spilling a
bit of urine on the toilet seat. Male urine
contains compounds called hydroxyl-man
funk-amines, and every male has a unique
set of them, like fingerprints. When a male
smells another male's hydroxyl-man-funk
amines. it sets off territorial instinct path
ways. ITiese pathways aggravate the male

and inspire him to cover up the opposing
male's scent.Thus,he urinates over the pre
vious man's urine,and pretty soon you have
a vicious cycle as new males come in to use
the toilet. A giant pool of piss covering the
bathroom floor results that not only hyper
aggravates males and leaves them inca
pable of aiming but also makes it that much
harder to reach the toilet because you have
to step back, like, three feet to avoid soak
ing your shoes in urine. Female
pheromones sequester hydroxyl-man
funk-amines, and that's why co-ed rest
rooms are typically cleaner than all-male
ones.
Aside from differences in cleanliness, 1
can say one thing about the bathrooms of
both sexes: ITiey are inherently ugly and
solely utilitarian facilities. These are places
where we bare and clean the stuff that
makes us human beings at least twicc a day
— rather important rituals. If bathrooms
see just as much flesh as bedrooms, why do
bedrooms receive all of the decorating at
tention? The Sydney Opera House recog
nizes this inequity: their bathrooms have
soft, seductive-like lighting with little

speakers playing Beethoven at every toilet
and a sink that looks more like an art piece
than a basin where water drains.That's what
I'm talking about — if I had limited funds
to build my dream house, I'd focus it all on
the bathroom. Marble floors, mood lighting
and an in-house jazz, band for my nightly
shower.
So you might be wondering why I put
more R's than typically dictated for the
word "dirty" in the title of this column.
That's because a lot of scandalous stuff goes
down in bathrooms. Those blowjob offers
actually do exist. People have sex in bath
rooms all the time, and not just in clean,
fancy ones. I suppose that's a true measure
of passion, when the scent of desire can
overcome the smell of feces. I even heard a
story of some poor chap in Arizona con
tracting gonorrhea in his eye after using a
sink that had seen some action.
What I'm trying to say is that everyone
should give more respect to our plastic- and
porcelain-attired friends, and we can start
