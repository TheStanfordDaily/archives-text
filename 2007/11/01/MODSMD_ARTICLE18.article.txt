Let's get focused: Stick it to Col
To the Editor:
Who among us does not realize that the young
woman we intended to use for our Big Game t-shirt
was troubled, and may he troubled still.The phrase
" 100 SOON" would have been appropriate long
before this latest attempt to make use of this
woman's plight as fodder for our starved need for
entertainment (as referenced in the Oct. 30 Daily
article,"Big game shirt redrawn").
Synonyms for fun in an online thesaurus includ
ed merrymaking, mirth, nonsense, pastime, play,
pleasure, recreation, rejoicing, relaxation, sport,
treat and whoopee. The antonym listed was simplv
"misery. Let s not base the fun we crave on this in
dividual's adversity.
l"here is quite enough available in the long and
storied history of rivalry between our two distin
guished institutions to satisfy our need for poking
fun. We don't have to cite the plight of an unautho
rized individual to get our campus's fun quotient
met.
Whether on the lields of play or in our class
rooms, labs and activities, I feel assured that we,
Stanford all, are creative and balanced enough to
stick it to Cal without getting stuck in this place.
Go Stanford!!! Have Fun!!!
