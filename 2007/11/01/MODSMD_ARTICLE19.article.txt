a loss this week. After being upset by No. 6 USC on the
road last weekend, the Cardinal will be looking for a
pair of wins against No. 19 Oregon and Oregon State at
home.
Stanford's four-game loss to the Trojans dropped
the team two spots in the national polls, though it is still
above USC.The Cardinal currently sits in second place
in the Pac-10 standings, one game behind No. 4 Wash-

ington.
Despite the
loss, Stanford's
senior setter Bryn
Kehoe took over
the top spot in the
national assists
rankings, with an
average of 14.31.

7:00 p.m.
CAME NOTES: The Cardinal lost only its
second match of the season in Los An
geles last weekend and dropped to the
fifth spot in the national polls. Oregon
and Oregon State visit Stanford this
week after both were swept by Stanford
in Oregon earlier this year. Neither
team has a winning record in confer
ence, but both have played well against
the Pac-10's best, and Oregon is in po
sition to qualify for the NCAA Tourna
ment in December.

the match, the Ducks pushed the Huskies to five games
earlier this season — Stanford and Cal have been the
only other teams to force Washington into a fifth in
2007.
Last week, Oregon was upset by Arizona State in
four games and fell three spots in the national polls.
When Stanford was in Eugene last month, the
Ducks stayed close with the Cardinal, but lost in three
games. The first two game scores were 30-27 and 32-
30. with a more lopsided third game score of 30-20.
Freshman outside hitter Alix Klineman and junior
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza put up nearly identical
stats on offense for Stanford — each hit over .400 with
18 kills — and junior middle blocker Foluke Akin
radewo added 10 kills. The Ducks' Gorana Maricic
also swatted 18. hut was the only Oregon player in
double digits. Maricic, a junior transfer, has nearly
400 kills on the season, averaging 5.3 per game in her
first season with the Ducks. She currently leads the
conference and is seventh in the NCAA in kills per
game. Oregon libero Katie Swoboda's 5.21 digs per
game average is the third best in the Pac-10. Heather
Meyers is the conference's top server with 0.43 aces

per game.
In program history. Stanford has lost only twice to
Oregon, on the road in 1986 and at home in 1989.
The OSU Beavers (10-13,3-8) have had even less
luck against the Cardinal, losing every one of their 45
meetings. TT»e Cardinal has not lost a game against
Oregon State since 2004.
The Beavers are in the bottom half of the confer
ence, but pulled off arguably the Pac-10's biggest upset
of the season when they beat UCLA in Los Angeles in
five games. OSU was swept twice since then before
beating Arizona in five games last week.
When the Cardinal visited Corvallis, it was an easy
Stanford sweep, 30-21, 30-20. 30-25. Barboza had a
team-high 17 kills and Akinradewo chipped in 15, in

eluding the 1 (KK)th of her career. The Beavers' Rachel
Rourke tallied 20 kills, the match high.
Rourke is the top hitter on the roster, having post
ed 25 kills in the upset ol the Bruins. She h;is 394 kills
in 2007 and is the team's top server with 31 aces.
The Cardinal will host Oregon tonight and Oregon
State tomorrow. Both games are at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
Following this homestand. the Cardinal will hit the
road for the last time in the regular season, visiting
Washington and Washington State. Stanford will finish
the Pac-10 season against Arizona, Arizona State and
Cal.
