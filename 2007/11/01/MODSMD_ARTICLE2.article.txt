## Changes for IHUM proposed Director aims for more variation in courses 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Introduction to Humanities
(IHUM) Director Russell Bernian is
determined to change the decidedly
negative perception among freshmen
that IHUM is a boring class.
Bernian recently submitted a pro
posal to the Committee on University
Standards and Policies (CUSP) that
includes several changes to the range
of topics offered in the humanities
program required for all freshmen.
"The core humanities material will
remain part of IHUM," Berman said,
"but I would like to give students a
wider range of choice."
Berman said the proposal is "a re
quest for authorization to experi
ment" with course topics dealing with
medicine, law and performing arts.
"We have so many students here
who have strong musical talent who
aren't going to be music majors,"
Berman said. "I would like them to be
able to engage that expressivity in an
IHUM class."
Many IHUM faculty members
shared Berman's desire to expand the
program.
"I think it would be very desirable
if we had more options for students
under the umbrella of IHUM," said
Professor Eamonn Callan, who lec
tures in this quarter's Freedom,
Equality and Difference IHUM
course. "I can't imagine any objection
to an IHUM course that had a large
academic element for medicine or for
different legal focuses."
IHUM Program Officer Phaedra
Bell said a wider range of courses
could also embrace the University's
emphasis on research.
"The beauty of an undergraduate
education at Stanford is its involve
ment in the cutting-edge research of
various fields," Bell said. '"We would
like there to he courses that are in
volved more in research."
IHUM sections are 50 minutes
this year, down from 90 in previous
years, and Berman said he would now
like to experiment with the physical
size of the classes. Smaller courses,
Berman hopes, will add to the aca
demic benefits of the program.
"Can we imagine a smaller IHUM
lecture with 50 students?" Berman
asked. "The lecture would almost be
more like a larger discussion section
and would foster a different relation
ship between faculty and students."
Altering topic range and class size
is not Berman's only goal.
"1 would also like to be able to ex
periment with the format of the
three-quarter requirement," he said.
Currently, students must fulfill the
freshman humanities requirement by
enrolling in the three-quarter Struc
tured Liberal Education program or
by taking a "I+2" IHUM sequence
with one course in the fall and a sec
ond two-quarter, winter-spring se
quence.
The CUSP will hear Berman's

proposal next week.
"1 will review the proposal next
week, and then it will go before the
entire Faculty Senate sometime in
winter quarter," said Aman Kumar
'09. a student representative on the
CUSP. "If we can get things done
quickly enough, we can start making
staffing choices for the revised pro
gram by February."
But even if the proposal passes
through CUSP and the Faculty Sen
ate, it must, along with the entire
IHUM program,undergo a larger re
view in the spring of 2009, Kumar
said.
"Personally, 1 believe the changes
are wonderful." Kumar said. "We are
one of the most creative, liberal and
flexible universities in the world, and
there's no reason why we shouldn't
be willing to experiment with such an
important program."
Although he only recently submit
ted his proposal, Berman is opti
mistic.
"I see this as really exciting and
very consistent with the goals of
IHUM," he said. "In the end, 1 think
it's a very strong program, and my
goal is to offer a range of courses so
that students choose to come to Stan
ford because of IHUM."
