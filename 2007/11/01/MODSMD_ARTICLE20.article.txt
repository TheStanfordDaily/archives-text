### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving team is gearing
up for the first conference meet of the season this Saturday. Nov.
3, at the Avery Aquatic Center against the University of Washing
ton. The competition will he the first dual meet between the Car
dinal and Huskies in over a decade.
Although still early in the season, the Stanford women (1-0)
have been hard at work in the pool, morning and night. Accord
ing to junior Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy, the team seems to be
making progress in its training despite the heavy workload.
"Our team has a lot of focused energy in our training right
now," she said. "We are really executing practices better than we
ever have during my time here. [Head coach] Lea [MaurerJ has
been pushing us in the pool, and it has been complemented real
ly nicely by our new land work this year."
O'Donnell-McCarthy also thinks the meet will serve as a great
opportunity for the Card to practice racing when tired.
"We are going to have a hard week of training, but we have a
chance this weekend to make the changes we have been working
on in practice and to execute and develop our race plans." she
said. "Learning to swim tired now is going to make us that much
better at the end of the year.The key for us, though, is going to be
racing tough through pain and finishing our races with the men
tal attitude that we want to have at the end of the season."
Defeating Washington will be no walk in the park for the Car
dinal.The Huskies are led by freshman Ariana Kukors. who is cur
rently ranked third and fourth in the world in the 200- and -WW
meter individual medleys, respectively. Although only a fresh
man. she has already broken school records only one meet into
her collegiate career.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal swimmers are more than ready to
take on Kukors and the Huskies this weekend, with Stanford's
own freshman class ready to make a big splash. O'Donnell-Mc-
Carthy emphasized how much the four freshmen swimmers are
already adding to the team.
"Our freshmen are really integrating nicely into the team," she
said. "They have a lot to contribute and can push the older girls. I
told [freshman] Kerry Kraemer the other day that 1 love watch
ing her train because she literally gets better and better every day.
Liz Smith brings a lot of training intensity to the table, and it has
really elevated the performance of the people around her. Julie
Smith has a great attitude and is really looking to step up in the
sprint group this year. Kate Dwelley is a great trainer and com
petitor and adds a lot of personality to the team."
