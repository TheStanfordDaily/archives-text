## Real sorrow? Cubs 
### 
1 really didn't want to write this article, I swear.The last thing
I wanted to do was to turn this column into a forum for vent
ing my deep despair. But last week. I was pushed over the
edge.
Many of you probably read the two baseball columns writ
ten last week. One. by Wyndam Makowsky, detailed the pain
felt by Yankees fans after the departure of one of the most
revered Yankees ever, manager Joe Torre. The other, by Denis
Griffin, was about the sad fact that, now that the Red Sox have
won another World Series (this was before they actually won
earlier this week), they might be nothing more than the Yan
kees-Lite.
Now I have no wish to challenge either of these articles. In
fact. 1 liked them both a lot, and both are, indeed, a bit sadden
ing. But after reading both of these articles, there was no way
that I could pass up writing about the truest form of sadness for
baseball fans: 1 am speaking, of course, of the immeasurable
sadness of the Chicago Cubs fan.
It is easy just to start off with the bare facts — the Cubs
haven't won the World Series since 1908. I'm no techie, but I'm
pretty sure my subtraction is correct
in labeling that as 99 years ago. Both
of my grandfathers have lived in
Chicago their entire lives but have
seen more World Wars than Cubs
World Series victories. In fact, one of
my great-grandfathers was just seven
years old in 1908. He must have
thought he had a whole lifetime of
championships to look forward to.
The baseball gods had other ideas.
The sheer improbability of this fu
tility is tough to comprehend. With 30
teams now in the league, basic proba
bility states that the Cubs should win
the World Series once in every 30
years. But then you also have to add
the fact the MLB has been constant
ly expanding — for example, in 1909
the league included only 16 teams.
Throw in the fact that the Cubs have
generally had a good-sized payroll
(i.e., been able to afford top players)
and the chance of having won zero
championships in 99 years is some
thing so low that it definitely does re
quire a techie to calculate.
1 should also mention that the
Cubs haven't even been to the World
Series since 1945.
Actually, the likelihood of that
might even be less than not winning a
World Series since 1908, if that's even
possible.
On top of that, the Cubs' history is
littered with epic collapses that make
the 99 title-less years even harder to
bear. The most famous, at least to
most of you reading this, was the 2(X)3
National League Championship col
lapse. which can be summarized with
one word: Bartman.
The Cubs led the series three
games to one over the Florida Mar
lins, with games six and seven taking
place in Chicago. And they managed
to lose three in a row.
Of course, the indelible moment
of the series was the Bartman inci
dent in game six, an event that reaf
firmed the ever-growing belief that
the Cubs are, indeed, just plain old
"cursed."
I won't further describe the Bart
man incident or the 2003 series itself
— I'm not sure that 1 could if I want
ed to. Sure, 1 can joke about it, but I
still don't want to relive it. I've only
watched the highlights (lowlights?)
of that series once, about two years
after the fact, and it almost brought
tears to my eyes. I'm not even
ashamed to admit that in writing —
that's how painful it was.
As if that collapse weren't bad
enough, just take a look at the teams
who have won the Championship
since then.

In 2003. after crushing Cubbie
hearts, the Florida Marlins went on to
win their second World Series in only
TEN YEARS OF EXISTENCE. If
that's not "rubbing it in." 1 don't
know what else is. In 2004, the Red
Sox won their first title since 1918,
leaving the Cubs in sole possession of
the "most cursed franchise" tag. In
2005, the Chicago White Sox won
their first championship since 1917,
which was then the second-longest
streak of futility in Major League
Baseball. In 2006, the Cubs' most
hated rivals won the championship,
namely the St. Louis Cardinals.
Finally, this past Sunday, the Red
Sox were crowned champions again.
And I'll admit, 1 was a bit sad that

there was nowhere near the atmos
phere as when they made their first
run in 2(X)4. But come on. there is no
sane member of the Red Sox Nation
who would change places with a Cubs
fan just for that momentary' excite
ment of "This could be the year!" and
the almost inevitable despair that fol
lows.
Cubs fans will still cling to their op
timism. though, and as we approach
100 years of championship-deprived
baseball, we will shrug it all oft' with
our wonderful catchphrase of "Hey.
any team can have a bad century."
