# Four Stanford men advance to ITA Indoor Championships in Ohio
## 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
Nearly a month ago. there were no Stanford men set to
compete at the ITA National Indoor Championships. But
after four weeks of solid play, four C Cardinal tennis players
have qualified for the tournament and will be opening play
today in Columbus, Ohio.
The Indoor Championships is, perhaps, the toughest
tournament in the country after the NCAA Champi
onships. A 32-player singles bracket and lb-team doubles
bracket filled with the top players in the nation should
make for an exciting weekend of tennis. On top of that,
two of the four Cardinal players are freshmen and will be
making their first appearances in high-level collegiate
competition.

"This is a great tournament and a great field," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "Everyone in the tournament
has qualified to be there. Every match will be a tough one."
Sophomore Richard Wire and freshman Alex Clayton
will he in singles action for the Cardinal, while junior Blake
Muller and freshman Ted Kelly will play in the doubles
bracket. Wire and Muller/Kelly qualified by winning their
respective brackets at the Regional Championships last
weekend in Seattle, while Clayton qualified three weeks
ago at the I TA Ail-American Championships by reaching
the quarterfinals.
Muller and Kelly draw Ross Cunningham and Andy
Connelly of the University of Tulsa in the first round. A win
there would set up a potential matchup with the top-seed
ed duo in the country, Somdev Dewarman and Treat Huey
of Virginia.
"I'm looking forward to getting back on the court and
seeing if [Ted and 1J can continue playing like we did in
Seattle," said Muller. "All the best teams will be here, so
now we can really judge where we stand and where we
need to go."
Contrasting playing styles helped Muller and Kelly
win their bracket two weeks ago, and that is what they
hope will carry them far this week. On one side of the
court there's Muller. who is used to championship-caliber
tournaments after being on the team for three years and
having much past success in doubles with fellow junior
Matt Bruch. His partner, Kelly, is a freshman who will be
experiencing the big-tournament atmosphere for the first
time.
"Ted has a big serve, and our games complement each
other really well," Muller said. "He may not have a ton of
experience at the college level, but he certainly has played
plenty of big matches [at the junior level] and knows how
to play under pressure.
"He has the ability and we as a team have the ability to
do well here. It's just making sure that we play within our
selves," added Muller.
Clayton plays Dominic Inglot of Virginia in the first
round, while Wire draws Jack Baker of South Alabama.
Clayton and Wire are in tough positions â€” if they win
their opening round matches, each player will face one of
the higher seeded players in the tournament.

Sophomore Richard Wire and freshman teammate Alex
Clayton will play in the singles draw of this weekend's ITA
Indoor Championships in Columbus, Ohio. The team of
Blake Muller and Fed Kelly will take on the doubles field.
"If I play well, I feel I can win a few
rounds." said Wire. "Indoors suits my
game, and I have been playing well re
cently.so I 'm looking forward to mak
ing progress in the tournament.
"It's also exciting because Stan
ford has four guys going, so we hope
for a good team showing."

Whitlinger would not put it past
his players to make n run at the title,
hut what matters first is improve
ment and consistency.
"All the guys are playing well
right now, but so are a lot of people,"
he said. "I'm looking to see if the
guys can build off their play and
keep winning, also how they do play
ing ;it the national level, how they
stand up to the national competi
tion."
Despite the looming challenge,
the players are excited and ready

for the big weekend ahead of
them. Whitlinger pointed out that
the four will have a lot of fun play
ing, even if the results are not what
they set out for.

Club of Columbus at 11 a.m. with
the first-round doubles matches, fol
lowed by first-round singles. The
