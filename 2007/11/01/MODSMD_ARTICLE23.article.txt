# Regional champ Jessica Nguyen goes it alone at women's Indoors
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
For years, the Stanford women have been a fixture at the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) National Indoor
Championships, which start today at Ohio State University
in Columbus. Ohio.
Junior Jessica Nguyen will be the Cardinal's lone repre
sentative at one of the toughest tournaments of the season.
A week ago, Nguyen earned a bid at the Indoors by captur
ing the team's first singles title of the season at the ITA
Northwest Regional Championships.
Nguyen will face a challenging draw consisting of the
top 32 players in the nation, most of them qualifying
through their respective Regional Championships or the
Ail-American Championships a few weeks before.
"Every match is a big match," Nguyen said. "You never
have a warm-up match because there's no such thing.
Everyone is very solid and ready to play."
Last year, the Card sent three players to the Indoors —
Nguyen, senior Celia Durkin and Theresa Logar '07.
Nguyen was invited to the Indoors after reaching the finals
in both the singles and doubles of last year's Regional, while
Durkin and Logar received at-large bids.
Of the three. Nguyen advanced the furthest main draw,
making it to the second round.
Durkin. who won last year's consolation bracket, was
not selected in this year's event due to a less impressive fall
season.
"It's definitely weird being the only person playing,"
Nguyen said. "I don't think that's happened in the last 10
years, but I'm just excited to be able to represent Stanford.
1 couldn't imagine what the Indoors would be like without
a Stanford player in it — it just wouldn't be the same."
In addition to the pressure of being the only Cardinal
woman, Nguyen must adjust to playing indoors.
"Indtxirs is a huge difference," Nguyen said. "We rarely
practice indoors, and all the girls in the East Coast and Mid
west are constantly playing ind<x>rs now.The air is dead, so

the hall is going to he really fast."
Fortunately, Nguyen is ready to take on the challenge al
most single-handedly.
'I'm an aggressive player,and it's important to he quick
indoors," Nguyen said. "I think that really plays into my
game well ... ill he ready for game-time on Thursday."
In the first round, Nguyen will face Johanna Dahlback
of Armstrong Pacific. Dahlback. who is the ITA Small Col
lege Champion, is unranked in the preseason polls.
I lowever, if Nguyen advances, she will potentially face
the second-seeded player, Susie Babos of California. Babos
was the ITA Women's All-American Champion and is a
former NCAA singles champion, having won the title in
2006.
Nonetheless, Nguyen is ready for any challenges that
come her way.
As the Northwest Regional champ, Nguyen played 10
matches in four days without feeling any pain in her previ
ously bothersome left f<x)t.
"The way it Ux>ks now. it looks great health-wise,"
Nguyen said. "I 'll just keep taking good care of it."

Junior Jessica Nguyen will be the only Stanford woman at
this weekend's ITA National Indoor Championships. She
qualified by winning last week's Northwest Regional.
No matter how the weekend turns
out. Nguyen understands that this is
but a small part of the grand scheme
of Stanford's season and the team's
quest to win its fourth national title in
five years.
"I'm just looking forward to being
able to play more matches," Nguyen
said. "That's the only way we really
improve, playing in tournaments and
playing good people. And hopefully

it'll be good preparation for when the
season comes."
While Nguyen participates in the
Indoors, the Cardinal will send senior
Whitney Deason and freshman Jen
nifer Yen to the Arizona State Invita
tional inTempe. Ariz.
The two tournaments mark the
final tune-up of the fall season. Stan
ford will be off for two months before
returning to action in January at the
Freeman Invitational, where the team
hopes to finally shrug off its early sea
son rust.
