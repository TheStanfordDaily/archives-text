## 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim and dive
team begins its season this Saturday
with a Pac-10 match against Washing
ton. The Cardinal is currently ranked
No. 3 in the preseason College Swim
ming Coaches Association (CSCAA)
rankings, behind perennial power
house, No. 1 Texas, and last year's
NCAA champion. No. 2 Auburn.
Stanford has won an amazing 25
Pac-10 titles in a row. Ihe team will
look to extend that winning streak by
focusing on creating a strong sense of
team community.
Head swimming coach Skip Ken
ney, who has been at the helm of Stan
ford for 25 consecutive years, is known
for developing strong team chemistry,
despite the fact that swimming is large
ly an individual sport. Certainly, team
spirit will be crucial if the men are to
extend their Pac-10 streak while con
tending for the national title.
"Inspiring breakout swims, suc
cessful battles in a close race and team
unity are the largest factors when it
gets down to performance time." said

senior breaststroke specialist Egan
Gans.
Gans, a US Senior Nationals quali
fier. is among the many experienced
seniors that will have to step up big to
fill the void left behind by last year's
senior standouts. This year, seniors
Daniel Beal, Noa Sakamoto and
Phillip Morrison in the freestyle and
butterfly, in addition to diver Nathan
Kim and breaststrokers Karl
Boehringer and Gans. will be called
upon to provide the leadership for
their team.
Sakamoto, who is also an open
water specialist, recently earned a spot
on the US Open Water national team
after finishing fifth at World Champi
onship Trials in October.
Aside from the seniors, a large part
of the team's success this year will de
pend on the freshman class, touted as
the best in the nation. Butterfly and
freestyler Austin Staab, who was the
National I ligh School Swimmer of the
Year, tied the 100-fly high school
record with a 47.10 effort and posted
the fastest 100-free time in the nation
as a senior. I le already swam on the
Stanford "A" Relay team against LSU
in a preseason friendly and will cer
tainly contend for points in the NCAA
Championships season.

John Criste enters as the fastest 200
Individual Medley swimmer in the na
tion. posting an incredible 2:14.44
long-course meters time at the Japan
International Swim Meet over the
summer.
Staab and Criste will be joined on
the starting blocks by fellow freshmen
Josh Charnin-Aker. Scotty Korotkin.
David Mosko. Jake Allen and diver
Brent Eichenseer, all of whom boast
Olympic Trial qualifying times.
"We have a great group this year,
and success will be when we capitalize
on our talent," Gans said.
Auburn has won the last five
NCAA titles, due mainly to its sprint
ing talent in the 50 and 100 events and
its strong relay teams. Stanford, how
ever, has some strong competition to
offer, as the team's camaraderie
should help produce good relay times.
"We have the talent to win NCAAs
every year," Gans said. "What deter
mines whether or not that actually
happens is how we perform at the big
show."
Stanford starts its season this Satur
day against Washington at 9 a.m. at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
