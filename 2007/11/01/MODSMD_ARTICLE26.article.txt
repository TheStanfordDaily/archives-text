## GSC worried for future of GO Pass Grads may lose 2008 subsidized train passes 
### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) expressed con
corn about the future of the GO Pass
program for off-campus graduate
students in the last minutes of last
night's meeting.
The GO Pass program subsidizes
train passes for graduate students
who live off campus, providing un
limited use of Caltrain. In 2007, gra
duate students had to pay $99.50 for
the pass, and approximately 3,500
students were eligible for the pro
gram.
Hie Office of the Provost agreed
to fund the GO Pass for the 2007 cal
endar year, but according to Kristina
Keating, a doctoral student in the
School of Earth Sciences and co

chair of the GSC,no funding has been
approved by the Provost's Office for
2(X)Band beyond.The subsidized GO
Pass will only be available until the
end of this year.
The Provost's Office agreed to
fund the GO Pass for the 2(X)7 calen
dar year provided that the Graduate
Student Transportation Board pro
pose a special fees measure for last
spring's ballot. The initiative did not
pass in April's elections.
"We are currently looking for fi
nancially sustainable solutions to
make the GO Pass available for stu
dents in 2008 and beyond," Keating
said. "Costs of housing are increasing,
so programs like this one are impor
tant to assist graduate students finan
cially."
Adam Sciambi, a graduate stu
dent who lives in San Francisco, ex
pressed his concern about the costs
he would incur next year if the GO
Pass program were to end.
"1 would be paying $150 dollars a
month per pass," he said, "which

means my transportation costs would
mount to $1,800 dollars a year."
In 2005, when the GO Pass was
first made available to graduate stu
dents. the program was entirely fund
ed by the Provost's Office, which con
tinued to provide the majority of the
funding in 2006. when the per-student
cost was $60.
The GSC contributed $35,000 to
the program in 2007. and the deans'
offices from each academic school to
gether contributed a total of $30,000.
And while the total cost of the GO
Pass program is about $350,000. this
total is likely to increase by six to 10
percent in 2008, according to the Oc
tober report of the Graduate Student
Transportation Board.
Keating said a committee com
posed of graduate students will be
meeting next week with campus ad
ministrators to talk about the future
of the GO Pass program.
