In yesterday's article "Duo explores
lives of homeless,"The Daily inaccu
rately reported that there has been a
40 percent drop in homelessness na
tionwide over the past three years.
In reality, homelessness has only
dropped by up to 20 percent. The
Daily also wrote that supportive
housing, which would place people
with addictions inside shelters,
would help fix the vicious homeless
cycle. Supportive housing would ac
tually place people with addictions
inside housing, not shelters.
