## Heart test required for athletes Students screened for genetic disorder this year 
### SHELBY MARTIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Mar. 4. 1990, Loyola Mary
mount basketball player Hank
Gathers scored an alley-oop dunk in
the West Coast Conference tourna
ment semifinal game against the
University of Portland. He then col
lapsed on the court. Gathers was
rushed to a nearby hospital, where
he was pronounced dead. An autop
sy found Gathers' death was caused
by a serious heart abnormality.
Researchers at the School of
Medicine want to make sure a death
like Gathers" never happens at Stan
ford. This year, for the first time, vol
unteers conducted electrocardio
grams (ECGs) to test the hearts of
all 800 Stanford athletes.
An ECG records the electrical
activity of the heart through wires
connected to a dozen sticky pads on
a patient's chest.The test itself takes
about five minutes, and the technol
ogy is fairly basic.
"It's one step above the stetho
scope," said Euan Ashley, assistant
professor of cardiology and director
of the Stanford Hypertrophic Car
diomyopathy Center.
Plough simple, ECGs have the
potential to save lives. An ECG can
detect conditions like the most com
mon cause of sudden death in ath
letes. hypertophic cardiomyopathy
(I K M). Hie genetic disorder causes
an abnormal thickening of the heart
muscle that can lead to dangerous
heart rhythms. HCM affects 1 in 500
people nationwide.
Screening for HCM has been a
"longtime ambition" of doctors at
the School of Medicine, Ashley said.
Hie idea of routine testing of ath
letes gained momentum after data
from Italy drove home its effective
ness. For more than 20 years. ECGs
have been mandatory in Italy for
anyone involved in competitive
sports, and the country has seen a
nearly 90 percent reduction in sud
den death in athletes.
Last year, guidelines from the

European Society of Cardiology
and the International Olympic
Committee recommended ECG
testing for athletes. Still, the Ameri
can Heart Association has declined
to make ECG screening an official
recommendation, since widespread
screening is thought to he too costly
to be practical.
Ashley says that Stanford is a
special exception to the hii>h cost of
ECGs.
"The nice thing here is that we
can use volunteers and the technol
ogy we already have in place to
screen the athletes for no real addi
tional cost,"he said.
An army of volunteers, including
cardiology fellows, exercise physiol
ogists and medical students, made it
possible to screen six or seven ath
letes at a time during this fall's
round of testing.
So far, researchers haven't found
anyone with HCM, but that could
change if athletes are screened again
next year.
"Statistically, we probably will
find someone," Ashley said.
lie recommended that athletes
found to have HCM quit any strenu
ous physical activity
Laura Wadden '09 received an
ECG along with the other members
of the Stanford women's swim team.
She said she didn't know the results
of the test had the potential to bench
her.

"I had no idea," she said, adding
that it would have been devastating
to find out she couldn't swim any
more. "My sport's a really big part of
my life."
Ashley agreed.
"It would be a tragic event if we
found someone who did have the
disease," he said.
Still, he added, keeping affected
athletes from their sport would pro
tect them from the possibility of sud
den death.
"In the end." he said, "we're in
the business of saving people's
lives."
