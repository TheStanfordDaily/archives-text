# Campus gears up for "big one"
## Procedures reviewed after earthquake 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford escaped Tuesday night's 5.6
magnitude earthquake with virtually no
damage to any of its buildings and no se
rious disruption of its services. But the
possibility of major disruptions following
"the Big One" necessitates that the
school's Environment I lealth and Safety
Department (EHSD) have procedures
in place for the worst-case scenario.
According to Keith Perry, training
and communications director of EI LSD's
Emergency Management division, emer
gency earthquake procedures went into
action immediately following Tuesday's
tremor in order to assess its effect on the
campus.
"In responding to the event ( Tuesday.]
night, our procedures worked quite
well," Perry said. "The response team re

acted literally within minutes."
Though the initial earthquake â€”
whose epicenter was located in the
foothills nine miles northeast of San Jose
caused no major damage to the cam
pus. Perry said that Emergency Manage
ment will be on heightened watch
throughout the next week out of concern
that additional seismic activity could
occur. The aftershocks that might follow
an earthquake such as this one, he said,
could be even more severe than the orig
inal 5.6 magnitude quake.
"The | U.S. Geological Survey] issues
estimates of potential aftershocks," Perry
said. "We certainly are on alert status be
cause there certainly is a possibility of af
tershocks."
As of press time, there were 41 after
shocks with an epicenter in Alum Rock,

to record Tuesday's earthquake because the instrument was adjusted to block out construction vibrations.
