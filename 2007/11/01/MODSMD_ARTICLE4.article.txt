# Campus gears up for "big one"
## Procedures reviewed after earthquake 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford escaped Tuesday night's 5.6
magnitude earthquake with virtually no
damage to any of its buildings and no se
rious disruption of its services. But the
possibility of major disruptions following
"the Big One" necessitates that the
school's Environment I lealth and Safety
Department (EHSD) have procedures
in place for the worst-case scenario.
According to Keith Perry, training
and communications director of EI LSD's
Emergency Management division, emer
gency earthquake procedures went into
action immediately following Tuesday's
tremor in order to assess its effect on the
campus.
"In responding to the event ( Tuesday.]
night, our procedures worked quite
well," Perry said. "The response team re

acted literally within minutes."
Though the initial earthquake â€”
whose epicenter was located in the
foothills nine miles northeast of San Jose
caused no major damage to the cam
pus. Perry said that Emergency Manage
ment will be on heightened watch
throughout the next week out of concern
that additional seismic activity could
occur. The aftershocks that might follow
an earthquake such as this one, he said,
could be even more severe than the orig
inal 5.6 magnitude quake.
"The | U.S. Geological Survey] issues
estimates of potential aftershocks," Perry
said. "We certainly are on alert status be
cause there certainly is a possibility of af
tershocks."
As of press time, there were 41 after
shocks with an epicenter in Alum Rock,

CA, according to the U.S. Geological
Survey. The highest recorded after
shock had a magnitude of 3.7
The 7.8 magnitude San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 destroyed many
parts of the campus, including parts
of the original facade of the Quad,
and was the single most devastating
earthquake in University history. If
a similar quake were to happen
today, there would likely be an en
tirely different set of complications
altogether.
In such a case, communications
would probably be disrupted
throughout most of the Bay Area.
"In the large earthquake, we
would expect reduced service for
both landline and cellular phones,"
said Perry, who also recommended
that students with family in the Bay
Area try to establish an emergency
contact elsewhere, as contacting

someone in an area not affected by
the earthquake would probably be
much easier.
The Emergency Management
team has also developed an emer
gency exercise scenario to establish a
guideline for handling whatever
needs could possibly arise following
a disaster. Perry said that, following a
major earthquake, the emergency
team would establish a central emer
gency response center with satellites
spread throughout the campus to
deal with problems as they arose.
He added that Emergency Man
agement is in the process of evaluat
ing how their response teams reacted
to Tuesday's moderate quake so as to
reevaluate procedures for more
damaging earthquakes.
"We are collecting info from
everyone who participated in the
event."he said, "to assess if any
changes need to be made."
Students expressed varied de
grees of awareness regarding proper
earthquake protocol following Tues
day's earthquake.
"I'm on staff and I'm a Bay-Area

resident, so 1 knew about duck and
cover and the assembly point,"Grace
Hsu'oB said. "I think that some of the
out-of-state residents were a little
freaked out."
Perry recommends that all stu
dents try to formulate a personal re
sponse plan for what to do in the
event of a major earthquake. He
claimed that "small ones like this are
a very good wakeup call to people"
and suggested students think about
hew they will contact their families
following a major earthquake,as well
as about having emergency supplies
on hand and securing their living
areas to prevent damage and injury.
"I guess upon reflection 1 realize
that using my cell phone would be a
bad idea because all the lines will be
tied up," Evan Miyazono 10 said. "1
figure that as long as the earthquake
is here, my first priority should be
my safety and that my family will
probably get in contact with me
eventually."
