### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Though Dance Marathon, the 24-hour an
nual dance party that raises money and aware
ness to fight HIV/AIDS, was originated four
years ago, the event's biggest success came last
vear following Partners in Health co-founder

Paul Farmer's talk on campus in November.
Ibis year. Dance Marathon hopes to again
gear up that momentum when Farmer returns
to campus on Nov. 10.
Farmer will deliver the Keynote speech for
the FA( 'I* AIDS National (Conference.FACE
AIDS is working in conjunction with Dance
Marathon to raise funds for the world health
care organization Partners in Health.
"Part of our objective is to recapture the
energy of last year," said Michael Chaitkin '09,
one of this year's Dance Marathon directors.
"With last year's freshmen now sophomores

and Farmer's return, we have a lot in our
favor."
Last year's Dance Marathon, held in Feb
ruary, was an unprecedented success. The
event attracted over 900 participants and
raised more than $150,000 in funds for Part
ners in I lealth.
"From 2006 to 2007 the financial success of
Dance Marathon expanded by 300 percent,"
said Serena Connor '09, another Dance
Marathon director this year.
Many incoming members of the Class of
2010 read Tracy Kidder's "Mountains Beyond

Mountains" over the summer before arriving
on the Farm, which, complemented by
Farmer's visit, contributed It) Partners in
Health's publicity on campus and to Dance
Marathon's success.
Ashley Pete '09, who has participated in the
last two Dance Marathons, noted the differ
ences in the size and scope of the event be
tween 2006 and 2007.
"I went as a freshman to Dance Marathon
and really had no idea what was going on." she
said. "But it was fun anyway, so I did
it again my sophomore year,The sec
ond year I was just blown away by
how many more people there were."
Dance Marathon organizers have
placed their faith in this year's event
by setting a higher fundraising goal.
"We're shooting to raise $160,000
this year," Chaitkin said.
"We wouldn't have set such a
high goal if we didn't think it was
reachable." Connor added.
Ibough the financial target for
2008 is higher than the 2007 target,
the number of dancers that Dance
Marathon staff is hoping to recruit

has decreased.
"We're capping the number of
dancers at 600 this year." Chaitkin
said. "We're aiming for quality over
quantity and a more tight-knit group
of dancers. There will be events just
for dancers periodically throughout
the year to help dancers socialize be
fore the marathon."
Each dancer is required to raise
$192 by mid-February, an amount
that has deterred some students
from immediately signing up.
"I want to participate," Adam
Creasman '11 said. But I did a lot of
charity fundraising in high school,
and it's hard to keep asking people
for money."
To address such concerns. Dance
Marathon staff will hold a series of
fundraising campaigns.
"We have three fundraising exec

utives on the staff this year," Connor
said. "We will hold various fundrais
ing events on campus that dancers
can sign up for. For example, we have
a car wash fundraiser planned for
Nov. 11."
Ultimately, the financial success
of the Dance Marathon event is only
one aspect of the dance event.
"To us, success also isn't just
about the amount of money raised,"
Chaitkin said. "It's also about com
munity outreach, raising awareness
and letting our dancers have a great
time."
Connor offered a potential motto
for the event: "Friends don't let
friends miss out on Dance
Marathon."
