### ERIC MESSINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITic Stanfords must have been rolling
over in their graves last night during the
annual Mausoleum Party, which was back
this year for the second straight Hal
loween after a four-year absence from
2002 to 2005. ITiis year's installment
earned generally positive reviews from
party goers.

Students dressed as members of the
rap group N.W.A., Sesame Street resi
dents and characters from the movies
"300" and"The Fifth Element" were
among the attendees. They were joined by
a giant Wheatie s Box. a Rubik's Cube
and at least two students mimicking the
"Dick in a Box" sketch from Saturday
Night l ive. Osama Bin Laden. Optimus
Prime and a security aiding Batman and
Superman also made an appearance at the

Halloween celebration.
While at least five Waldos were report
ed, there were no positive indications of
his whereabouts.
Partiers gathered in a well-lit clearing
in front of the Stanford Mausoleum near
Palm Drive, and music blared as students
danced, compared costumes and picked
up energy drinks from sponsor Rockstar.

Two students pose for the camerq, at lost night's
Mausoleum party. Student Affairs officer Nanci Howe said the
event proceeded largely without security problems or arrests.
With attendees still pouring in at
11:15 p.m., organizers were confi
dent the party had avoided the
dreaded sophomore slump.
I think the party is going great,"
s.nd Nanci Howe, student affairs of
ficer m the Office of Student Activi
ties. " We've had very few problems
with security, and people are enjoy
ing themselves."
ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08 said this year's organizers
learned from the setbacks of last
year's event.
"We've definitely made sure to
have enough power generators,"
Avula said, referencing the sound
system failure at last year's party.
"We've also set up barriers around
the DJ. since people were tripping
over wires and speakers were almost
falling on students [last year).
"We've made sure to have
enough lights around the edges," he
added. "Last year, people were com
plaining about how dark it was in the
woods and the front entrances."
Without last year's wristband sys
tem. estimates on the number of at
tendees varied. Most agreed, howev
er. that this year's total was lower
than last year's celebration, but
there were still enough students to
fill the main circle.
While some students lamented
the decrease in attendence, others
were happy with the smaller

turnout.
"Last year it was very over
crowded" said Daniel Zavala '08,
ASSU Executive Council member.
"It was overflowing, and we had
more people than we wanted. This

year it's a lot more manageable. It's
just right."
For the most part, freshmen said
their first Halloween spent at the
Mausoleum lived up to expecta
tions.

"It's not a 'wow,' but coming was
worth it," said Maria Lemus '11, who
made up half of a pair of larger-than
life Hershey's Kisses. "We were
mostly excited about our costumes."
"It's a good time so far", added

Graham Brockington '11, who was
dressed as Jackass' Party Boy. "It's
actually better than I was expect
ing."
For many students, however, it
was just another party.

"It's about the same" said a stu
dent dressed as Optimus Prime.
"Nothing much has changed."
