over in their graves last night during the
annual Mausoleum Party, which was back
this year for the second straight Hal

2002 to 2005. ITiis year's installment
earned generally positive reviews from
party goers.

Students dressed as members of the
rap group N.W.A., Sesame Street resi
dents and characters from the movies
"300" and"The Fifth Element" were
among the attendees. They were joined by
a giant Wheatie s Box. a Rubik's Cube
and at least two students mimicking the
"Dick in a Box" sketch from Saturday
Night l ive. Osama Bin Laden. Optimus
Prime and a security aiding Batman and
Superman also made an appearance at the

Halloween celebration.
While at least five Waldos were report
ed, there were no positive indications of
his whereabouts.
Partiers gathered in a well-lit clearing
in front of the Stanford Mausoleum near
Palm Drive, and music blared as students
danced, compared costumes and picked
up energy drinks from sponsor Rockstar.
