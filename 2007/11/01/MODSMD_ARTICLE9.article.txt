# All the world's a stage
## Students travel to Oregon for annual Shakespeare Festival 
### TRI HUNG NGUYEN 
Zubair Ahmed' 11 was more than
happy to spend his last weekend
away from the Internet and
Facebook — all for the love of
theater.
This past weekend, Ahmed and
about 30 of his fellow Stanford students
from Freshman-Sophomore College
(FroSoCo) traveled to Ashland, Ore., to
take part in the annual Oregon Shake
speare Festival. In the span of two days,
they had a chance to watch three plays
of their choice and go on a backstage
tour to learn about the process of trans
forming a play from the page to the
stage.
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is
an annual season of theatrical perform
ances held in Ashland. ITte festival runs
from mid-March to the beginning of No
vember every year, hosting 11 plays. Al
though the festival is named after the
great English playwright, only a couple
of its plays — "As You Like It"and
"Romeo and Juliet" this year — are
based on Shakespeare's work. The re
maining nine plays are by contemporary
writers.
At the backstage tour, which was the
last of this year's season, the group also
learned about the close link between the
festival and Stanford. For example,
Richard I lay '52 is behind the designs of
all the theaters used for the festival.
"[ 1 lay] is the one responsible for em

ploying the latest and most innovative
technology in the designing of the
stage," said Jason Esquerra, one of the
backstage tour guides. "He implement
ed a hydraulic system under the stage so
that we can build up the settings quickly
for every play."
Additionally, with the New Theater,
Hay pioneered the idea of a 360 degree
stage in which the audience sits on all
four sides of the stage, revolutionizing
the way actors have approached their
performances.
Esquerra added that in previous
years, some of the plays every year were
produced by college students, including
some by Stanford students.The students
would rehearse their plays during the
spring of each year and dedicate the en
tire summer to performing at the festi
val. Since 1970, however, the festival has
required a stronger commitment from
the cast and crews. The entire acting
company and their supports, hence, have
turned professional.
The center of all the activities last
weekend, however, was the plays. On
the first night, the group was treated to
an adaptation of Shakespeare's classic,
"As You Like It."The subsequent after
noon and evening, they could choose to
watch two of the four more contempo
rary plays,which brought fresh elements
to the festival.
"I am too familiar with Shakespeare,
having read most of his plays and stud
ied about his life," Ahmed said."Howev

er, I was most impressed with "Distract
ed.' They were able to make use of the
sets in a very innovative manner. There
was even the use of the television
screens, which was really impressive."
Susie Brubaker-Cole. Associate Vice
Provost and Director of Undergraduate
Advising and Research as well as one of
the College Directors of FroSoCo.came
up with the idea of the dorm trip to the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
"This year was the first time FroSo-
Co organized this trip for its residents"
Brubaker-Cole said. "1 grew up in Ash
land and have lived with the festival
since a very young age." She continued.
"Another reason for it is that Donner
has done it for quite some time, and we
think that it is a great idea."
The $35 each student paid for the trip
covered less than half of its entire ex

pense; additional funds came from the
Resident Fellow Funds and the Stan
ford Institute for Creativity and the
Arts, according to Brubaker-Cole.
For College Assistant Diana Jaffe '09,
it was love for the plays, and not her staff
duty, that brought her to the festival.
"1 signed up for the event on my own
account and really enjoyed it," she said.
"Besides, this is college, and we were in
the trip as friends and not chaperones."
Aside from the plays, the students
could keep something special about the
trip for themselves.
"For me, interaction with freshmen
and sophomores was another highlight
of the trip," Jaffe said. "It was great to get
to know more about everyone."
