# Composting program turns old food into campus landscaping
## 
### KT MERTES 
The program to reduce Stanford's waste starts with com
mon practices, such as recycling printer paper or turning
off the water when you brush your teeth.
But recycling the food you were too full to eat? Stanford
does that too.
At all campus dining halls, "scraps off of student plates as
well as kitchen preparation food waste, produce, meat, soiled
paper and napkins can be composted," says Erin Gaines, Sus
tainable Foods Coordinator for Stanford Dining.
Newby Island in Milpitas. in addition to being Stanford's
landfill, does double duty as a destination for compostables.
Peninsula Sanitary Service, Inc. (PSSI) trucks organic waste
from campus compost bins to the landfill's composting center,
where large mounds of yesterday's lunches and

dinners slowly decompose.
After some lucky employee decides that
sufficient rotting has taken place, PSSI trucks
make another trip to Newby Island, returning
with a rich soil amendment used in campus land
w scaping.
Stanford's composting program started at Wilbur in
2003 and expanded to all dining halls the following

r ■ P *'•*' IVIIVTTIIIf,
I year. Several other locations now practice behind-the
f counter composting, including the Business School cafe,
the golf course restaurant and the faculty dining club.
Row houses also compost their organic waste, though it's
kept in hrcked bins to avoid contamination from well
meaning (but inexpert) passers-by.
While on-campus composting is largely a behind-
the-scenes activity, those involved say
it has great potential. But the road has
not been completely smooth.
"Stanford Dining tried to roll out
biocompostables in all the cafes [last
year],"said Dawn Kwan'o9.co-leader
of Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford's Zero Waste Committee. "We
had volunteers in bright green T-shirts
standing in Tresidder for a whole
week, directing people."
But when she returned to campus
this fall, "we realized that everything
had returned to Styrofoam," she said.
" ITiey took away the compost bins
and the signages and that just con
fused people."
Kwan is working with Gaines and
PSSI waste manager Julie Muir to try
again, making helpful signs and gather
ing volunteers to inform cafe patrons.
"We're pushing out biocomposta

bles in Olive's and in Alumni [Cafe]"
Kwan says. She hopes to complete the
project within the quarter.
Currently, 39 percent of Stanford's
waste is landfilled at Ncwby Island.
Muir'sgoal is to reduce that to 24 per
cent through more recycling and to 14
percent by expanding composting ef
forts.
"You get [that] by educating peo
ple," Muir says. "What's left in the
garbage? What are students buying
that we can't recycle?"
Iliat's a key question, considering
the scope of Stanford's waste man
agement. It's also a question perfectly
suited to that eco-conscience deep in
side us all: what did you throw in the
trash today?
