# PS3's give protein project world record
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford has set a new world
record for video game console use —
but not in the way you'd expect.
Thanks to Sony's Playstation 3
(PS3). the University's Folding@
I lome project has officially garnered
the world's most powerful distrib
uted computing system, according to
Guinness.
Folding@Home works to eluci
date the molecular mechanisms of
protein folding using the rapid pro
cessing power of the PS3, along with
personal computers. According to
the project's head. Structural Biolo
gy and Chemistry Prof. Vijay Pande,
the PS3 in particular has made calcu
lations 20 times faster than previous
methods.
With registration open since 2006.
more than 600,000 PS3's worldwide
have joined in the pursuit of science,
amassing more than a petraflop
over 1,000 trillion floating point op
erations per second — just last
month.
Hie previous computing champi
on. Berkeley's SETl@Honie project
(Searching for Extraterrestrial Intel
ligence). topped out at 265 teraflops
or 265 trillion floating point oper
ations per second.
Leave it to Stanford-affiliated
gamers to beat Cal and produce
valuable research at the same time.
