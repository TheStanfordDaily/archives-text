## Conference celebrates CCSRE anniversary 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While hosting a conference may not seem like
the typical celebration for an anniversary, today's
festivities at Annenberg Auditorium aren't typical
for an anniversary either: To celebrate its first 10
years, the Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity (CCSRE) invited educators from
across the country to examine how today's un
precedented diversity is shaping American lives.
Running through 5:30 p.m. this evening, "Em
bracing Diversity: Making and Unmaking Race,
Ethnicity and Difference in the 21st Century" is
both a celebration of CCSRE's 10th anniversary
and a discussion of its core interests. With speakers
on the topics of education, immigration, religion
and cultural discourse, the conference addresses
an interdisciplinary audience of scholars from a
number of universities.
Hie discussion is meant to confront the chal
lenges in becoming a diverse — and just — socie
ty. Free and open to the public, the panels feature
topics such as "Muslims in America and Religious
Tolerance, Immigration Policies, Education and
Equity in the Post-Brown Era" and "Producing
and Diversity in the Public Sphere: Reproducing
Power and Performance in Dominant Culture."
In yesterday's opening remarks, CCSRE pro
fessors spoke briefly about their work with the
Center.
Founding director of the Hiphop Archive Mar
cyliena Morgan, a professor in the department of
communication, addressed the movement of
hiphop into the academic sphere.
"Students began to offer classes and conduct
research projects. They wanted input from their
professors," Morgan said. "They kept going'till we
as faculty realized we needed to step up, and they
insisted we bring [the intellectual arguments] to
archive. So many students have an intellectual pas
sion to learn more about race, gender and class."
The path echoes that of CCSRE itself, which
was established in November 19% in the wake of
protests and student demands for expanded ethnic
studies. Several professors workedtogether to cre
ate a center that would be capable of leading the

development of fields in African and African-
American, Asian-American. Chicano, Jewish and
Native American studies into the next century.
Now serving as an umbrella organization for
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Educa
tion Institute, Research Institute of CSRE,
Hiphop Archive, African and African-American
Studies program and Taube Center for Jewish
Studies, CCSRE features more than 100 faculty
from 15 departments and five schools across cam
pus.
The subsidiary CSRE program offers an under
graduate minor and major, which in 2007 had eight

graduates — a number which has been growing
since the program's inception.
"1 think the importance of studies in race and
ethnicity will only continue to increase." said Olga
Medina 'OS. a double major in CSRE and Political
Science. "There is no doubt in my mind that the
CSRE department and the talented scholars it
produces will play an influential role in spearhead
ing and continuing the academic work on these
topics while informing the public discourse on
them."
In the past few years in particular, the program
has worked to establish an open community
forum. Also in yesterday's remarks. Sociology
Prof. Lawrence Hobo — who, along with Morgan,
his wife, is leaving Stanford for I iarvard in January
addressed the need to discuss urgent subjects as
the department did two years ago with its "Con
fronting Katrina: Race, Class and Disaster in
American Society."
"We live in a protective cocoon of the Bay
Area," Bobo said, going on to summarize a recent
article in the San Francisco Chronicle describing
Morgan Stanley's recent $16 million settlement in
a race bias suit filed by Black and Latino brokers.
"II that's happening here, imagine what's hap
pening in areas where we think they are not pro
gressive," Bobo added.
The sentiment was contrasted by keynote
speaker Gloria Ladson-Billings.a professor of cur
riculum educational policy studies from the Uni
versity of Wisconsin-Madison. Focusing on educa
tion in a Post-Brown Era, her talk, entitled "When
the Court is No Longer a Friend," addressed re
verse discrimination.
"Even though African Americans have relied
on the court to obtain their civil rights, the court is
no longer a friend to minority communities," she
said, arguing that the progress made in the civil
rights movement has regressed in recent legal de
cisions, where race is being turned on itself.
Similar discussions will continue today, with
events being held at Annenberg Auditorium from
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
