Everyone wants to live in a good neigh
borhood — that goes without saying.
The Stanford Taskforce Evaluating
Education in the Residences (STEER) was
organized in the fall of 2(X)6 under the joint
leadership of several top undergraduate ad
ministrative offices to evaluate "the rela
tionship between undergraduate education
and Residential Education (ResEd)."The
nine-month study included significant input
from faculty, staff and students and recom
mended a "focus on developing residential
neighborhoods to better leverage re
sources." The tentative setup that the study
currently envisions, with neighborhoods
with only a single faculty member presiding
over a cluster of dorms, would inadequately
replace the vibrant intellectual atmosphere
that students currently enjoy by living in
close proximity to faculty and staff Resident
Fellows (RFs) in each dorm.
The proposed neighborhoods would
consist of an administrative staff collaborat
ing with a Faculty Fellow (FF) to oversee
residential life. FFs would be tenured facul
ty living in each neighborhood and "respon
sible for academic programming and intel
lectual life within the cluster of residences."
The importance of RFs in every dorm,
however, must not be overlooked. Quite
simply, they are the lifeblood of Res Ed.
They are the ones who make freshmen
feel comfortable the first week, the kindly
and mischievous father figure who loudly
intones Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass"
during dorm skits the first week and the
mother who sits nearby in the dining hall,
letting her chocolate-milk-besmirched child
roam around just like that little sister or
niece would back home.
Res Ed's Web site states that, "living and
learning should be integrated and that for
mal teaching, informal learning and person
al support in residences is [an important
component of) a Stanford education."

ResEd is also an invaluable part of the
Stanford experience because it infuses
everyday life with intellectual engagement.
Students have the opportunity to engage
full faculty in the dorms in a much more nat
ural setting than Faculty Lunches or office
hours. RFs are a major part of the bridge be
tween the classroom and the dining hall that
contribute to the intellectually vibrant Stan
ford that we treasure. Distancing the faculty
from the dorms would remove the sense of
family and intellectual vitality.
But there are elements of the current RF
system that could be tweaked. One RF men
tioned capping the time one could be a fellow,
citing the burnout that typically sets in after
roughly five years. Additionally, there must
be ways to ameliorate the busiest time of the
year for an RF — the time-intensive process
of selecting dorm staff in the spring. ITiis
might be accomplished, perhaps, by stream
lining the application process or giving the
new neighborhood administrators some re
sponsibility for selecting dorm staff as well.
The STEER taskforce correctly recog
nizes that the RF's"importance to Residen
tial Education cannot be underestimated as
they will promote the intellectual tone of
the residences by sharing their teaching and
research interests, involving their faculty
colleagues in residence programs.encourag
ing discussion of important issues and serv
ing as mentors to students." Indeed, this is
precisely why having faculty in every dorm,
not merely in a neighborhood, is important.
The administration deserves commen
dation for its thoughtful evaluation of res
idential life. The idea of residential
neighborhoods is generally good, but no
matter the ResEd system ultimately im
plemented. faculty members should re
main in every dorm.
Good neighborhoods are desirable, but
intellectually engaged families are even
better.
