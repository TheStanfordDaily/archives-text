# Burning Down the House
## Keep it weird, Stanford 
### 
Though I'm all for state-subsidized
abortion for married lesbian illegal
immigrant couples, when it comes to
campus culture, I'm downright curmud
geonly. My philosophy for Stanford politics
amounts to this: things used to be good and
they've gotten worse.
it's worth taking seriously those small
things that amount to our inheritance.Take,
for example, dorm themes. In an odd way,
themes really matter.The dorm theme is one
of the few surviving running jokes at Stan
ford. It's part of our folk culture, and like
dying languages or the music of Appalachia,
it requires action by those concerned to be
preserved in good health.
So I'm going to lay down some rules in
the hopes of keeping this piece of Stanford
weirdness alive and thriving.
The first requirement of a good theme is
an actual working pun. This seems obvious,
yet is ignored too frequently. Two years ago.
the now-graduated staff of Toyon themed
the dorm "Wilbur." Neither funny nor
punny. And its cleverness was nowhere near
the prior theme of'Tnigo Montoyon." If you
give a damn about maintaining any level of
Stanford's traditional funkiness, you should
demand some reason why the joke you're
making has something to do with the name
of your dorm. litis rule can be bent to great
success but never broken outright â€” see
Mars' "Venus Fnvy."
ITiough using only part of the dorm
name is standard practice, the best puns use
the whole thing and do so creatively. The
winner in this category was floated by my
freshman RA in Otero but shot down by au
thority figures who didn't get that any joke
that's too soon is just on time:"Bioteroism."
litis brings us to the next sin of theming:
not understanding the difference between
topical edginess (see above, as well as 2(X)5-
200(iVKarl Grove") and banal pop-culture
references. This is what separates, say, jokes
in "Dr. Strangelove" about nuclear apoca
lypse from jokes in "Shrek 2" about how
there are a lot of Starbucks coffee shops
these days. An example of the latter?
"Xanadukes of Hazzard." Exemptions to
this rule only apply when the pop-culture
reference is something surprisingly charm
ing like "National J-Rographic"or funny on
its own. e.g. "Snakes on a Twain" (though
better, but admittedly impossible, would
have been "I've Had It with These Mother
fucking Snakes on This Motherfucking
I\vain").
Fxtra points for nerdy, weird, and ob
scure references. A friend of mine proposed
"Dante's Infernotero." Floor 1: Infernotero.
Floor 2: Purgatoriotero. Floor 3: Paradi
siotero. It's creepy and weird; it's nerdy and
literary. It's spectacular. I heard that "Jerry

niandering" was under consideration for
Jerry this year. Imagine all the uncomfort
able jokes you could make about how draw
groups in row houses don't intermingle. An
other great one in this vein: "Kairony is
Dead." So PoMo meta-ironic and obscure
that it's its own punch-line. An abortive ef
fort in this direction was "The Xanadude
Abides." Not quite obscure enough, but an
example of a brave tendency in dorm them
ing. and my next point.
Although the theme is often identical to
the pun (e.g. the legendary "Lani Mars
den"), it does not need to be. Rather, in
some of the best themes, the pun merely
serves as a hint for the broader idea of the
theme. I lence. for "The Xanadude Abides,"
the theme is not the abiding Dude himself,
but "The Big Lebowski." Likewise, "Hi-Phi
iive Sig" refers not to high fives but to
"Borat." And this leads us to the best theme
I've seen actually implemented in my time
at Stanford, from dark horse Arroyo: "Ar
royale with Cheese."
Let me start with an explanation because
it's understandable not to get this one im
mediately. In the opening minutes of "Pulp
Fiction," two of the main characters, gang
sters played by Samuel L. Jackson and John
Travolta, are on their way to collect on a
debt to their boss. It ends up being pretty
bloody. They chat on the way about the fact
that in French, a quarter-pounder with
cheese is called a "royale with cheese." It's
an uncomfortably funny scene (and I don't
even really like the movie) because of your
awareness of the coming bloodbath and
their complete nonchalance.
I dwell excessively on themes, but there's
a point here. Stanford is best at its quirkiest,
its most interesting, its most offbeat. The
fundamental point of this place, as I under
stand it, is that it does its own thing (in con
trast to the Oxford-aping Ivies). It's an intel
lectual tradition as well as a cultural and aes
thetic style, and it's at the very core of who
we are as a university.
Every time the university mulls a policy
change of some kind, it should ask the ques
tion,"Will this aid or harm the Stanford tra
dition of unconventionally?" It's not the
only question that matters, but it is a big one.
