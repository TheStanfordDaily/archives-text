# Oddities and Katie-o-Syncrasies
## We all might be kinda, sorta passive-aggressive 
### 
When Stanford students get into
groups, all we do is say the oppo
site of what we think.
When we are planning a group project,
"that could work" means "that will never
work." "Yeah, that could be interesting,"
means "that's not interesting at all."
There is the tentative "yeeeaahhhh." al
most always accompanied by a "no" face.
There is the positive introduction followed
by a complete negation of the positive in
troduction. "Yeah, 1 think that brings up a
good point, but wouldn't it just be easier if
we..." And "maybe," as the wise singer
songwriter Jack Johnson tells us, pretty
much always means "no."
What the eff is wrong with all of us? We

try to take away all the bite from our nega
tive comments. "There might be some po
tential problems with that," means "that's
the worst idea I've ever heard." Then we
sulk when our idea isn't accepted, and we
are brutally forced into consensus. "Yeah,
no. That's fine. No. yeah, that works too."
1 guess we're all petrified of hurting each

other's feelings. Or maybe we're just pro
jecting our own fear of getting turned down
and so preface all of our own ideas with dis
claimers and all of our negative judgments
with encouraging compliments. After all,
nothing is more enraging when Bad Idea
Kid condescendingly rejects your sugges
tion. Who is he to tell you no, anyway?
We are, after all, students of equal intel
ligence until proven otherwise. So, as ideas
flow, we silently decide which ones we like
(more often than not. our own) and which
ones we would rather not have our names
printed underneath. In a balancing act of
putting forth our judgments while

preserving the fragile idea of per
formance parity, we stammer out
pacifying clauses to ease the rejec
tion of the bad (a.k.a. everyone
else's) ideas and ostensibly mini
mize our continual support of the
good (a.k.a. our own) ideas. It also
gives the bad-idea-generators the
benefit of the doubt — who knows
if he's a math mastermind? Or the
greatest flutist the world has ever
known? We cover our polite bases
by using I'm-sure-you're-smart-in
other-fields comedowns like "if we
had more time," "if the scope was
larger," or "similarly but slightly
differently..."
Passive-aggressive behavior is
all about the battle. In fact, the term
passive-aggressive was actually
coined by the U.S. War Department
in 1945 to describe soldiers in
World War 11 who never openly dis
obeyed orders but procrastinated

and were purposefully incompe
tent. We too fight, in an understated
war of words, against the authority
we resent. Bad Idea Kid. You could
never tell by the even tones and the
"no, that's a good idea" statements
that everyone is secretly fighting it
out till the bitter end.
Verbal passive-aggressive be
havior extends far beyond group
projects, too. Just think about all
the double-talk in relationships.
"You've been so busy lately,"
means. "I feel like I'm neglected
and I'm a second priority. I'm upset
that you don't carve out more time
to spend with me." "I'm busy," on
the other hand, means "I'm really
not that into you." Think about all
the passive-aggro moments be
tween roommates. Or married peo
ple. Or co-workers. It seems like
the more time you spend with
someone, the more round-about
conversations and illicit meanings
you'll have.
1 suppose, if you think about it,
everything we say is a little passive
aggressive. "Could you please pass
the salt?" is really just a nice way of

saying "Salt! Now!" Of course, a liv
ing, breathing human is capable of
passing a two ounce object. It's not
about the capability of passing the
salt or the question of if they will —
you're letting them know that your
soup is bland either way. But the
first way is also, albeit in a small
way. letting them know you respect
them and aren't bossing them
around. It's about your relationship
with your mom as much as it's
about her cooking.
Words, as any linguistic professor
is quick to point out, are more than
just symbolic representations of our
world. They help us define who we
are, how we express ourselves and
how we relate to one another.
After all, monkeys can tell each
other there is a lion on the prowl.
But it takes a human to tell you
that, like, I don't know, maybe if we
could just tweak your idea a little
bit, and modify it, it might be easier
to do.

Yeah, no, you can email her at kttay

you wanted to.
