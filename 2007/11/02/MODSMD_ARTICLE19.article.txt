## The 						language skit and me 
### 
£ £ on. I can't handle this anymore.
Your mother and I are getting a di
vorce. Where's my booze?"
Thus ends a lighthearted skit I witnessed
this morning in my Chinese conversation
class. ITie father, an alcoholic, had been at
tempting to explain to his son why getting an
arranged marriage was the best course of ac
tion for his future. In the process, however,
the father had let slip his personal deep-seat
ed hatred for the boy's mother. As the moth
er started to cry. the father raged off back
stage in an alcohol-induced fury. And when it
was all over, the room was filled with laugh
ter... Really.it was.
There is a weird dynamic about skits in
language classes. No matter the language, no
matter the level and no matter the group dy
namics characteristic pattern emerges every
time.
It has been demonstrated through empir
ical analysis that the probability that a male
will cross-dress in this setting increases ten
fold over the norm. Along with this rise, there
is a requisite corresponding increase in the

use of high falsetto voices. Although such
voices often get in the way of correct lan
guage pronunciation, their use is strikingly
prevalent in the average language skit.
What's worse, the stark reality remains
that you run a much higher chance of acci
dentally offending your teacher and his/her
culture. In the rush to create a language skit,
German classes get Nazis. Chinese classes
get abandoned female children, and Arabic
classes get terrorists. This cultural insensitiv
ity is further exemplified by the audience it
self, which adds what seems like an out-of
sync laugh track to the whole event.
Along the same vein, it also becomes in
creasingly likely that your skit will involve

overly-lighthearted treatment of a serious
issue. Diseases, eating disorders, dysfunction
al families and unfortunate historical events
ended up liberally sprinkled in this five
minute presentation.
And it's not just the skit. Maybe it's using
a foreign language at all. 1 find that my per
sonal views on everything suddenly become
10 times more extreme when I try to con-
Verse in a foreign language."Do you like Chi
nese food better or American food?" A
friend asks. "C hinese food is the best food in
the world! I loudly yell back, a googly-eycd,
smiling expression on my face. "What do you
think about thievery?" "Thieves should be
punished by having their hands cut off!" I
snap back, punching a fist into an open palm.
And when asked "what do you think about
China's economy?" I reply: "The Chinese
( ommunist party will accomplish an eco
nomic turnaround the likes of which the
world has never seen!"
Instead of taking the time to form a

nuanced opinion, I utter the first
thought that pops into my head,
often out of fear of an awkward for
eign language pause. Writing a skit is
really the same as having a conversa
tion with your language teacher and
maybe we're afraid of this same
pause when we're delivering the skit.
Something about using another
language to express reality brings

out the insensitive, racist and sexist
bigot in all of us. And for some rea
son, this becomes funny. I'm not writ
ing to pass judgment on this phe
nomenon — after all. in my personal
group this morning. I was a drunk,
cross-dressing frat girl who hap
pened to be ruining an arranged
marriage.
But 1 wonder how all of this hap
pens. Language classes do. in a sense,
put us in the position of children,
learning a language for the first time.
Is this bigotry similar to the kind that
little kids show on the playground?
In the end, are we just parroting

daddy's dislike of foreigners? Or is it
all indicative of the opinions we think
foreigners themselves should have?
Either way, the alcoholic,
arranged marriage victims and cry
ing mothers must, in the end. be dis
missed as simply a short and mean
ingless skit. When the curtain falls
and the child realizes that he's
doomed to a life of forced marriage,
we can't help but laugh. After all. the
presentation was in Chinese.
