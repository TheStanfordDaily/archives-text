## Card faces must-win against UW 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It is a mark of just how far Stanford
Football has come in 2007 that tomor
row's home contest against Washington
could be termed a 'must-win game.' But
with four games remaining and three vic
tories needed for the Cardinal to reach
bowl-eligibility, that's exactly what the
matchup against the Huskies is.
Making the game all the more com
pelling is the match-up's recent history.
Stanford (3-5, 2-4 Pac-10) earned its one
and only win of the 2006 season against
Washington (2-6,0-5), a lone bright spot in
a season otherwise marred by record lev
els of futility. The team's 20-3 win in that
Nov. 11 contest knocked the Huskies out
of contention for a bowl-berth, as UW
would go on to finish 5-7.
Asked if the thought that memory
would give Washington any added moti
vation in Saturday's contest, sophomore
free safety Bo McNally admitted that it
would certainly be a topic of conversation
in the Stanford locker room where the
squads' roles have been reversed.
"I'm not in their shoes but that's how I
would feel if 1 were them." McNally said.
"They're probably going to come out with
a lot of fire in them, playing in our house.
So we've definitely got to play with a lot of
enthusiasm this week."

As it stands, the game in which McNal
ly burst onto the scene with two intercep
tions — he returned one for a 49-yard
touchdown — will always be remem
bered by the Cardinal as an immense re
lief as the prospect of a winless year van
ished in the season's eleventh-hour.
"It was great to get that weight lifted
off our shoulders because that whole year
we were struggling just to compete," Mc-
Nally said. "We just felt that was our one
bright spot last year."
Despite the Huskies bringing a six
game losing streak into Saturday's com
petition, the Cardinal will face plenty of
hurdles of its own. An injury-depleted
backfield will see no improvement this
week as both junior Anthony Kimble and
sophomore Toby Gerhart will not return
to action from their respective injuries.
That means that true-freshman Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt freshman Tyrone
McGraw will once again have to carry the
load for the Cardinal in what head coach
Jim Harbaugh deemed a "defining game"
of the 2007 season. The freshman tandem
produced little in the way of results last
week against Oregon State, however —
Stanford finished the game with -8 yards
on 25 rushing attempts.
"We just didn't get it done in terms of
blocking people, getting our face on peo-

NOTES: The Cardinal faces a must-win game
against the Huskies on Saturday if they hope
to keep any realistic hopes of bowl eligibility
alive. Stanford could be hampered by a thin
backfield that will still be missing junior run
ning back Anthony Kimble and sophomore
running back Toby Gerhart, who could miss
the rest of the season with his knee injury
sustained against San Jose State Sept. 15.
The Cardinal defense, meanwhile, will have
its hands full trying to contain Washington's
sensational sophomore quarterback, Jake
Locker, who leads the Huskies through the
air and on the ground.
