## Card faces must-win against UW 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It is a mark of just how far Stanford
Football has come in 2007 that tomor
row's home contest against Washington
could be termed a 'must-win game.' But
with four games remaining and three vic
tories needed for the Cardinal to reach
bowl-eligibility, that's exactly what the
matchup against the Huskies is.
Making the game all the more com
pelling is the match-up's recent history.
Stanford (3-5, 2-4 Pac-10) earned its one
and only win of the 2006 season against
Washington (2-6,0-5), a lone bright spot in
a season otherwise marred by record lev
els of futility. The team's 20-3 win in that
Nov. 11 contest knocked the Huskies out
of contention for a bowl-berth, as UW
would go on to finish 5-7.
Asked if the thought that memory
would give Washington any added moti
vation in Saturday's contest, sophomore
free safety Bo McNally admitted that it
would certainly be a topic of conversation
in the Stanford locker room where the
squads' roles have been reversed.
"I'm not in their shoes but that's how I
would feel if 1 were them." McNally said.
"They're probably going to come out with
a lot of fire in them, playing in our house.
So we've definitely got to play with a lot of
enthusiasm this week."

As it stands, the game in which McNal
ly burst onto the scene with two intercep
tions — he returned one for a 49-yard
touchdown — will always be remem
bered by the Cardinal as an immense re
lief as the prospect of a winless year van
ished in the season's eleventh-hour.
"It was great to get that weight lifted
off our shoulders because that whole year
we were struggling just to compete," Mc-
Nally said. "We just felt that was our one
bright spot last year."
Despite the Huskies bringing a six
game losing streak into Saturday's com
petition, the Cardinal will face plenty of
hurdles of its own. An injury-depleted
backfield will see no improvement this
week as both junior Anthony Kimble and
sophomore Toby Gerhart will not return
to action from their respective injuries.
That means that true-freshman Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt freshman Tyrone
McGraw will once again have to carry the
load for the Cardinal in what head coach
Jim Harbaugh deemed a "defining game"
of the 2007 season. The freshman tandem
produced little in the way of results last
week against Oregon State, however —
Stanford finished the game with -8 yards
on 25 rushing attempts.

NOTES: The Cardinal faces a must-win game
against the Huskies on Saturday if they hope
to keep any realistic hopes of bowl eligibility
alive. Stanford could be hampered by a thin
backfield that will still be missing junior run
ning back Anthony Kimble and sophomore
running back Toby Gerhart, who could miss
the rest of the season with his knee injury
sustained against San Jose State Sept. 15.
The Cardinal defense, meanwhile, will have
its hands full trying to contain Washington's
sensational sophomore quarterback, Jake
Locker, who leads the Huskies through the
air and on the ground.

True-freshman running back Jeremy Stewart will have to \
carry the load for the Cardinal again this week, after the
Cardinal lost eight yards rushing last Saturday at OSU.

pie and sustaining blocks," Har
baugh said. "It was a collective ef
fort by our offense, not only in the
running game but just to move the
ball, get first downs and gain and
sustain field position."
In order to make up for the de
pleted rushing attack, Stanford of
fensive players across the board will
have to step up their game against
the Huskies. For the first time in his
career as a starter, sophomore quar
terback Tavita Pritchard failed to
throw a touchdown pass against
OSIJ, going 16-32 with a pair of in
terceptions. That statistical line, as
well as the play of Pritchard's sup
porting cast, will need to improve
for the Cardinal to make a state
ment tomorrow.
"The situation at running back,
we know what that is," Harbaugh

"But like a horse at
the Kentucky Derby,
we are coming down
that last third of the
track, putting the
blinders on, chomping
at the bit and going
for that finish line."
— JIM HARBAUGH

said. "And therefore everyone else
along the offensive front, our quar
terbacks, our receivers have to step
up and play better than they think
they can play."
The Stanford defense will face
the task of containing Washington's
dynamic sophomore quarterback,
Jake Locker. In attempting all but
10 of the Huskies' passes this sea
son. Locker has thrown for 1,529
yards and 13 touchdowns. The sec
ond-year sensation also leads UW's
ground attack, with 694 rushing
yards and eight touchdowns.
"[l'm] very impressed with
[Locker]," Harbaugh said. "He un
derstands what they're trying to do
offensively. He can make the
throws, he reads coverage — I think
he'll improve in that regard as he
gets more playing time, but he's al
ready playing at a very high level.
"He's a dual threat type guy, def
initely one of the most explosive
guys in the Pac-10," Harbaugh
added. "I'm very impressed by the

poise he plays with and the way he
leads his team."
Still, perhaps the Cardinal's
biggest challenge tomorrow will be

avoiding the trap of looking back —
to last week's offensive debacle
against the Beavers or ahead to the
bowl game that is still, remarkably, a

possibility for the 2007 Stanford
Football campaign. It's a task that
Harbaugh is all too well aware of.
"Right now we've got our blind
ers on." he said. "We're not looking
back, we're not looking to get dis
tracted. But like a horse at the Ken
tucky Derby, we are coming down
that last third of the track, putting
the blinders on. chomping at the bit
and going for that finish line."
NOTES
Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. tomor
row at Stanford Stadium. The game
will be broadcast live, locally, by
FSN Bay Area and can be heard on
KNBR. 1050 AM or KZSU, 90.1
FM.

The Cardinal is scheduled to
honor its eight member 2007-induc
tion class to the Stanford Athletics
Hall of Fame during the game.
Stanford is gunning for its third
consecutive win over Washington, a
feat the squad has been unable to ac
complish since it won 10 straight
games over the Huskies from 1%7-
1976.
Victories have been hard to
come by in the Cardinal's first two
seasons at home in the new Stan
ford Stadium. The Card has just one
home win to its credit over that span
to bo with nine losses.

It is a mark of just how far Stanford
Football has come in 2007 that tomor
row's home contest against Washington
could be termed a 'must-win game.' But
with four games remaining and three vic
tories needed for the Cardinal to reach
bowl-eligibility, that's exactly what the
matchup against the Huskies is.
Making the game all the more com
pelling is the match-up's recent history.
Stanford (3-5, 2-4 Pac-10) earned its one
and only win of the 2006 season against
Washington (2-6,0-5), a lone bright spot in
a season otherwise marred by record lev
els of futility. The team's 20-3 win in that
Nov. 11 contest knocked the Huskies out
of contention for a bowl-berth, as UW
would go on to finish 5-7.
Asked if the thought that memory
would give Washington any added moti
vation in Saturday's contest, sophomore
free safety Bo McNally admitted that it
would certainly be a topic of conversation
in the Stanford locker room where the
squads' roles have been reversed.
"I'm not in their shoes but that's how I
would feel if 1 were them." McNally said.
"They're probably going to come out with
a lot of fire in them, playing in our house.
So we've definitely got to play with a lot of
enthusiasm this week."

As it stands, the game in which McNal
ly burst onto the scene with two intercep
tions — he returned one for a 49-yard
touchdown — will always be remem
bered by the Cardinal as an immense re
lief as the prospect of a winless year van
ished in the season's eleventh-hour.
"It was great to get that weight lifted
off our shoulders because that whole year
we were struggling just to compete," Mc-
Nally said. "We just felt that was our one
bright spot last year."
Despite the Huskies bringing a six
game losing streak into Saturday's com
petition, the Cardinal will face plenty of
hurdles of its own. An injury-depleted
backfield will see no improvement this
week as both junior Anthony Kimble and
sophomore Toby Gerhart will not return
to action from their respective injuries.
That means that true-freshman Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt freshman Tyrone
McGraw will once again have to carry the
load for the Cardinal in what head coach
Jim Harbaugh deemed a "defining game"
of the 2007 season. The freshman tandem
produced little in the way of results last
week against Oregon State, however —
Stanford finished the game with -8 yards
on 25 rushing attempts.
"We just didn't get it done in terms of
blocking people, getting our face on peo-

2/16 Pullman, Wash. jSSk
NOTES: The Cardinal faces a must-win game
against the Huskies on Saturday if they hope
to keep any realistic hopes of bowl eligibility
alive. Stanford could be hampered by a thin
backfield that will still be missing junior run
ning back Anthony Kimble and sophomore
running back Toby Gerhart, who could miss
the rest of the season with his knee injury
sustained against San Jose State Sept. 15.
The Cardinal defense, meanwhile, will have
its hands full trying to contain Washington's
sensational sophomore quarterback, Jake
Locker, who leads the Huskies through the
air and on the ground.


GUS JEWELL/The Stanford Daily \.
True-freshman running back Jeremy Stewart will have to \
carry the load for the Cardinal again this week, after the
Cardinal lost eight yards rushing last Saturday at OSU.

pie and sustaining blocks," Har
baugh said. "It was a collective ef
fort by our offense, not only in the
running game but just to move the
ball, get first downs and gain and
sustain field position."
In order to make up for the de
pleted rushing attack, Stanford of
fensive players across the board will
have to step up their game against
the Huskies. For the first time in his
career as a starter, sophomore quar
terback Tavita Pritchard failed to
throw a touchdown pass against
OSIJ, going 16-32 with a pair of in
terceptions. That statistical line, as
well as the play of Pritchard's sup
porting cast, will need to improve
for the Cardinal to make a state
ment tomorrow.
"The situation at running back,
we know what that is," Harbaugh

"But like a horse at
the Kentucky Derby,
we are coming down
that last third of the
track, putting the
blinders on, chomping
at the bit and going
for that finish line."
— JIM HARBAUGH

said. "And therefore everyone else
along the offensive front, our quar
terbacks, our receivers have to step
up and play better than they think
they can play."
The Stanford defense will face
the task of containing Washington's
dynamic sophomore quarterback,
Jake Locker. In attempting all but
10 of the Huskies' passes this sea
son. Locker has thrown for 1,529
yards and 13 touchdowns. The sec
ond-year sensation also leads UW's
ground attack, with 694 rushing
yards and eight touchdowns.
"[l'm] very impressed with
[Locker]," Harbaugh said. "He un
derstands what they're trying to do
offensively. He can make the
throws, he reads coverage — I think
he'll improve in that regard as he
gets more playing time, but he's al
ready playing at a very high level.
"He's a dual threat type guy, def
initely one of the most explosive
guys in the Pac-10," Harbaugh
added. "I'm very impressed by the

poise he plays with and the way he
leads his team."
Still, perhaps the Cardinal's
biggest challenge tomorrow will be

avoiding the trap of looking back —
to last week's offensive debacle
against the Beavers or ahead to the
bowl game that is still, remarkably, a

possibility for the 2007 Stanford
Football campaign. It's a task that
Harbaugh is all too well aware of.
"Right now we've got our blind
ers on." he said. "We're not looking
back, we're not looking to get dis
tracted. But like a horse at the Ken
tucky Derby, we are coming down
that last third of the track, putting
the blinders on. chomping at the bit

with four games remaining and three vic
tories needed for the Cardinal to reach
bowl-eligibility, that's exactly what the
matchup against the Huskies is.
Making the game all the more com
pelling is the match-up's recent history.
Stanford (3-5, 2-4 Pac-10) earned its one
and only win of the 2006 season against
Washington (2-6,0-5), a lone bright spot in
a season otherwise marred by record lev
els of futility. The team's 20-3 win in that
Nov. 11 contest knocked the Huskies out
of contention for a bowl-berth, as UW
would go on to finish 5-7.
Asked if the thought that memory
would give Washington any added moti
vation in Saturday's contest, sophomore
free safety Bo McNally admitted that it
would certainly be a topic of conversation
in the Stanford locker room where the
squads' roles have been reversed.
"I'm not in their shoes but that's how I
would feel if 1 were them." McNally said.
"They're probably going to come out with
a lot of fire in them, playing in our house.
So we've definitely got to play with a lot of
enthusiasm this week."

As it stands, the game in which McNal
ly burst onto the scene with two intercep
tions — he returned one for a 49-yard
touchdown — will always be remem
bered by the Cardinal as an immense re
lief as the prospect of a winless year van
ished in the season's eleventh-hour.
"It was great to get that weight lifted
off our shoulders because that whole year
we were struggling just to compete," Mc-
Nally said. "We just felt that was our one
bright spot last year."
Despite the Huskies bringing a six
game losing streak into Saturday's com
petition, the Cardinal will face plenty of
hurdles of its own. An injury-depleted
backfield will see no improvement this
week as both junior Anthony Kimble and
sophomore Toby Gerhart will not return
to action from their respective injuries.
That means that true-freshman Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt freshman Tyrone
McGraw will once again have to carry the
load for the Cardinal in what head coach
Jim Harbaugh deemed a "defining game"
of the 2007 season. The freshman tandem
produced little in the way of results last
week against Oregon State, however —
Stanford finished the game with -8 yards
on 25 rushing attempts.
"We just didn't get it done in terms of
blocking people, getting our face on peo-

NOTES: The Cardinal faces a must-win game
against the Huskies on Saturday if they hope
to keep any realistic hopes of bowl eligibility
alive. Stanford could be hampered by a thin
backfield that will still be missing junior run
ning back Anthony Kimble and sophomore
running back Toby Gerhart, who could miss
the rest of the season with his knee injury
sustained against San Jose State Sept. 15.
The Cardinal defense, meanwhile, will have
its hands full trying to contain Washington's
sensational sophomore quarterback, Jake
Locker, who leads the Huskies through the
air and on the ground.

True-freshman running back Jeremy Stewart will have to \
carry the load for the Cardinal again this week, after the
Cardinal lost eight yards rushing last Saturday at OSU.

pie and sustaining blocks," Har
baugh said. "It was a collective ef
fort by our offense, not only in the
running game but just to move the
ball, get first downs and gain and
sustain field position."
In order to make up for the de
pleted rushing attack, Stanford of
fensive players across the board will
have to step up their game against
the Huskies. For the first time in his
career as a starter, sophomore quar
terback Tavita Pritchard failed to
throw a touchdown pass against
OSIJ, going 16-32 with a pair of in
terceptions. That statistical line, as
well as the play of Pritchard's sup
porting cast, will need to improve
for the Cardinal to make a state
ment tomorrow.
"The situation at running back,
we know what that is," Harbaugh

"But like a horse at
the Kentucky Derby,
we are coming down
that last third of the
track, putting the
blinders on, chomping
at the bit and going
for that finish line."
— JIM HARBAUGH

said. "And therefore everyone else
along the offensive front, our quar
terbacks, our receivers have to step
up and play better than they think
they can play."
The Stanford defense will face
the task of containing Washington's
dynamic sophomore quarterback,
Jake Locker. In attempting all but
10 of the Huskies' passes this sea
son. Locker has thrown for 1,529
yards and 13 touchdowns. The sec
ond-year sensation also leads UW's
ground attack, with 694 rushing
yards and eight touchdowns.
"[l'm] very impressed with
[Locker]," Harbaugh said. "He un
derstands what they're trying to do
offensively. He can make the
throws, he reads coverage — I think
he'll improve in that regard as he
gets more playing time, but he's al
ready playing at a very high level.
"He's a dual threat type guy, def
initely one of the most explosive
guys in the Pac-10," Harbaugh
added. "I'm very impressed by the

poise he plays with and the way he
leads his team."
Still, perhaps the Cardinal's
biggest challenge tomorrow will be

avoiding the trap of looking back —
to last week's offensive debacle
against the Beavers or ahead to the
bowl game that is still, remarkably, a

possibility for the 2007 Stanford
Football campaign. It's a task that
Harbaugh is all too well aware of.
"Right now we've got our blind
ers on." he said. "We're not looking
back, we're not looking to get dis
tracted. But like a horse at the Ken
tucky Derby, we are coming down
that last third of the track, putting
the blinders on. chomping at the bit
and going for that finish line."
NOTES
Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. tomor
row at Stanford Stadium. The game
will be broadcast live, locally, by
FSN Bay Area and can be heard on
KNBR. 1050 AM or KZSU, 90.1
FM.

The Cardinal is scheduled to
honor its eight member 2007-induc
tion class to the Stanford Athletics
Hall of Fame during the game.
Stanford is gunning for its third
consecutive win over Washington, a
feat the squad has been unable to ac
complish since it won 10 straight
games over the Huskies from 1%7-
1976.
Victories have been hard to
come by in the Cardinal's first two
seasons at home in the new Stan
ford Stadium. The Card has just one
home win to its credit over that span
to bo with nine losses.
