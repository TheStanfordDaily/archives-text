Give 'em the Axe
Students, revive Stanford by reclaiming the spirit of 1899
This story shall the good man teach his son
And live the voice of Stanford's hidden twenty-one
From this day until the ending of the world
Cal shall remember our Lumberjack girls
And, we few, we happy few, band of brothers
Today shed blood as one Brutus Branner
Who shall have thy sister, be she ne'er so vile,
To disgrace the name, Larkin's Angels
This day shall gentle Cat's condition,
A prayer from Papal men of Flo Mo mission,
And Gentlemen on The Row now a-bed
Slam the axe to that dirty bear's head
For we shall think ourselves accursed were we not here
To rally a new era for the alma mater
From the foothills to the planes it shall ring
And afore the contest, win or lose, we shall sing
And hold our manhood high whiles any speaks
That fought with us Big Game week
Stanford men and women gather your friends
Dress them in costumes that demand attention
Together we can establish such traditions.
That the immortal twenty-one are no longer hidden.
In 1899, Stanford baseball was highly rated. 1 lowever,
other Stanford sports were slumping. Stanford track had

lost twice in a row to Cal, freshmen football lost to Cal,
and the 'dirty' Golden Bears defeated Stanford in varsity
football by a score of 22-0 (Touchdowns were worth 5
points at the time).
Because of the popularity of the Axe Yell, the Stanford
Yell Leaders decided an Axe would be the perfect instru
ment to help rally the students. The Axe was a standard
lumberman's axe weighing 10 pounds with a 15-inch blade.
When it arrived, the Axe's handle was painted red.
In April IS 1 ) 1 ), a best of three game baseball series was
scheduled between Cal and Stanford. Cal upset Stanford
4-1 in the first game of the series. ()n Apr. 13,1899, a rally
was held on the Stanford campus for the second game, to
be played two days later. The Axe was displayed to the
Stanford student body for the first time at this rally, and it
was used to decapitate a straw man dressed up in blue and
gold.
As a Yell Leader. I know that we cannot reinvent the
Axe. 1 lowever, we can help lead the way to an exciting
new era at Stanford. Let's make Saturday's game more
than just a game. Don't wait until Big Game on Dec. 1.
Iliis Saturday. Stanford I'ootball ravages the Washington
Huskies. I'he Stanford student body must also bring "en
thusiasm unknown to mankind!"
