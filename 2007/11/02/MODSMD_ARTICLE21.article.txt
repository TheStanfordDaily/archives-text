ITie No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team will
say farewell to Maloney Field for the rest of the
regular season this weekend as the Cardinal plays
its final Pac-10 home games against Washington on
Friday and Washington State Sunday afternoon.
Stanford and its weekend opposition are right on
top of each other in the middle of the Pac-lOstand
ings. Despite its lofty national ranking, Stanford (11-2-3,2-1-2
2-3,2-1-2 Pac-10) sits between its two opponents at
fifth place. Washington (5-9-1.2-2-1 Pac-10) is right
behind the Cardinal in sixth, but unheralded Wash
ington State (10-2-3.3-1-1 Pac-10) is flying the high
est of the trio right now. Ihe Cougars are currently
tied for second in the conference with No. 11 USC.
Washington State was boosted last weekend
by senior forward Brooke Bemis. who scored
two of the Cougars' three goals against Oregon
and Oregon State to earn Pac-10 Player of the
Week. Bemis, with her eight goals, is tied for the
WSU team lead with her fellow forward, sopho-
more Kiersten Dallstream. Only
three other players have found the
back of the net for the Cougars this
season — freshman midfielder
Mallory Fox and senior defender
Allison Scurich have four goals
apiece, while sophomore midfielder
( arlv Dobratz has seen her shots hit

the back of the net twice.
Washington has more goal-scorers
hut fewer goals; the I luskies. the Pac
10's lowest-scoring team, have only 17
goals in 15 games this year. Senior for
ward Shuree I lyatt leads the way with
six goals and two assists, hut it has not
always been enough to make up for
Washington's defense, which is also
the worst in the Pac-1(). Goalkeeper
Taylor Carr and the I luskies back line
are giving up an average of 1.58 goals
per game.
Stanford enters these match ups

in enigmatic form. Every time the
Cardinal takes the field it looks as
though the team is playing well
enough to score five goals, but Stan
ford has not been finishing well of
late. It took several strokes of good
fortune to find the net against Ari
zona last weekend — sophomore for
ward Kelley O'l lara delivered a free
kick that just barely crossed the line
and then capitalized on a turnover by
Arizona's goalie — and break up a
barren run by the offense, though no
goals were to be found against Ari

zona State in the scoreless draw two
days later. Stanford only has one goal
in its other three games over the past
two weeks.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
defense continues to be a strong
point.The back four of juniors Allison
Falk and Marisa Abegg and seniors
Rachel Buehler and April Wall has
stood strong after some midseason
difficulties. Last weekend, senior
goalkeeper Erica Holland, who
sports a 0.73 goals-against average, re
turned to the fold after more than a

month on the sidelines, replacing
freshman Kira Maker.
Sunday afternoon is Senior Day
for six players on the Stanford roster.
Holland. Buehler. Wall, midfielders
Shari Summers and Mimi Yuhas, and
forward Lizzy George will all be play
ing in their final regular season game
on the Farm. The group has compiled
a heady 49-21-11 record over their
four years at Stanford.
