## Premier Pac-10 foes visit Farm Cardinal to battle UCLA, San Diego State after two week layoff 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer meets the Pac-10's top
two teams in home matches this weekend. The
Cardinal (4-4-5,1-2-2 Pac-10) takes on UCLA (8-
6-2.4-2-1 Pac-10) at 7:30 p.m. on Friday and then
awaits the arrival of San Diego State University
(8-4-2.4-2-0 Pac-10) at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday. Luck
ily, a bye week has given the team 13 days to train,
recover and plan for the contests.
"The two weeks off helped us regroup," coach
Bret Simon said. "We had a lot of short-term in
juries and played three games in a row on the road,
[so] we've been able to refocus and get healthier."
Senior forward Dan Shapiro agreed that the
break helped to reestablish team fundamentals.
"Training has been solid the last two weeks,"
Shapiro said, "Fveryone has been focused on the
task at hand, and the extra time has
allowed us to make some improve
ments in our organization."
Organization will first become im
portant against the Bruins, with
whom Stanford has tied its last three
games. In the Oct. 12th encounter,
the teams went to double overtime,
with the final score remaining at 0-0.
The UCLA offense, though, will
surely come back with a vengeance.
Led by junior Griffin Maxwell, who
alone has netted 7 goals, the Bruins
are tied with Washington atop the
Pac-10 scoring count with 21 goals.

Maxwell finds support in senior Mike
Zaher, who has contributed 3 goals of
his own, and sophomore Kyle
Nakazawa. with a conference-lead
ing 6 assists.
UCLA's strengths do not end with
its offense. Sophomore goalie Brian
Perk has notched 67 saves this year,
claiming 5 shutouts in the process.
While Stanford's senior keeper, An
drew Kartunen. will be out again this
weekend due to an injury, Simon reit
erated the faith he has in the Card's
goalkeeping depth.
"We are fortunate to have a very
strong and talented group of goal
keepers." Simon said. "John Moore
will start this weekend. [Me] has
many games under his belt, is one of
the conferences top goalkeepers
and should be one of the strengths of

our team this weekend."
Hie Aztecs arrive at the Farm
with two keeper possibilities of their
own. Freshman Brad Byrnes has five
shutouts in only nine appearances,
and junior Jorge Rosales has accu
mulated two.
SDSU will attack with senior
Kraig Chiles and freshman Khadim
Diouf, who have scored 7 and 5
goals, respectively, and find support
from sophomore Evan Toft (5 as
sists).
The question that remains is
whether Stanford's offense will be
able to get out to a quick start, as it
has struggled to do all season, and
beat the opposition to the first goal
scoring punch. Coach Simon is opti
mistic that the time away from com
petition will bring the extra spark to
the front line.
"Offense comes and goes,"
Simon said. "We've spent a lot of
time throughout the season on im
proving our attacking. We've looked
very sharp in training and 1 expect
we will create opportunities and
take them well."
However, he recognizes that
mere opportunities against these
teams won't be enough. The Cardi
nal must stay motivated and hungry
to find success.
"UCLA and San Diego State are
both difficult teams to play," Simon
said. "Each has [its] own style and in
dividual players who can cause you
problems. So we'll make a few adjust
ments. But, most importantly, we'll
need to bring great energy to the
games, the kind of energy that is as
sisted by being at home and mentally
focused."
With the Pac-10 season hitting the
home stretch, Shapiro believes that
the weight of the games will make the
team eager to win.
"We all realize that even though
our last few games have been disap
pointing, the Pac-10 is still up in the
air," he said."So this weekend should
be fun. [Fanscan] expect ISO minutes
of intensity on our part — we know
how important these games are."
