### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Set to play three games in lour (Jays, the No. 4 Stanford
men's water polo team got its weekend off to the right start
yesterday after dominating UC-Santa Cruz, 22-5. TTie busy,
four-day slate ol competition will end at Stockton against
University of the Pacific on Sunday.
I"he Cardinal won yesterday's match going away, finish
ing on a 17-2 run. The team was highlighted by the efforts of
junior utility Will Hindle-Katel.who netted four goals:fresh
man driver Cody Wiesen and sophomore utility Janson Wigo
each had hat tricks of their own to add to the cause.
The Cardinal fell two spots in the national rankings last
week after its poor performance against UCSB. Stanford
currently sits behind fellow MPSF squads No.l USC. N0.2
Cal and N0.3 UCLA as the NCAA championships loom in
less than a month. The team now stands with an overall
record of 11 -6.
"Basically the difference is that all the games we play
count towards (the overall] ranking." senior two-meter de

nament."
"Our overall record in the
MPSF isn't that great," Finlayson
continued."But it's not bad enough
to get us automatically disqualified,
so we can't afford any more slip
ups."
Stanford's 11-7 win over N0.5
Pepperdine last Sunday stopped a
three-game slide in MPSF games.
"After the last two losses, coach
Vargas has changed up the rotation
quite a bit," Finlayson said. "Ryan
McCarthy has been playing a lot
and very well. He's a two meter, so
that's great. We're just trying to ro
tate in more people to keep every
body fresh."
The team has received significant
contributions from young players
this season. Freshman goalkeeper
Brian Pingree has aided senior
Sandy Hohener with solid goal
tending, while freshman driver
Alex Pulido and freshman utility
Jeffrey Schwimmer have seen solid
play. Pulido has managed to score
crucial last minute deciding goals
for the Card, including an equalizer
against Cal.
Sophomores Ryan McCarthy,
Drac Wigo. Janson Wigo, and Sage
Wright have all been a huge part of
the Cardinal rotation. McCarthy
has seen increased playing time and
has stepped up very well in the past
few games. Both Wigo brothers are
mainstays of the team due to their
versatility, and Wright was named
MPSF player of the week in the
first week of October for his efforts.
"We have [had] a lot of talent
and even more depth in the past,
but we have a lot of freshmen, soph
omores and we're really young this
year," Finlayson said. "We don't
have a senior core that's playing the
bulk of the minutes like last year so
that's a different challenge. ITiis
team is one of the most talented
I've been on,but I believe [it] could
be better with experience."
Fresh off its easy win over the
Banana Slugs of UC-Santa Cruz,
Stanford will play No. 8 UC-Davis
Aggies tomorrow. 1 p.m. at Avery
Stadium.
