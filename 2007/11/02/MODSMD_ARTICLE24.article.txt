# No. 19 Ducks demolished
## No. 5 Cardinal rallies after second game loss to vanquish Oregon, 3-1 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the No. 5 Stanford
women's volleyball team got tired of
losing the second games of their
matches and they took out their frus
tration on No. 19 Oregon. After two
close games, the Cardinal blew the
Ducks away, allowing them only 19
and 17 points in the third and fourth
games.
The Cardinal (20-2.10-2) lost the
second game of both of its matches in
Los Angeles last weekend, beating
No. 9 UCLA in four games and los
ing to No. 6 USC also in four. Last
night. Stanford continued that
streak, winning the first and losing
the second against the Ducks (16-8,
5-7).
But Stanford looked like a differ
ent team out of the halftime break,
blocking Oregon on three of the first
four points of the third game and
never looking back.
Oregon's Gorana Maricic had a
match-high 19 kills but it was not
enough to overcome a balanced
Stanford attack that featured all five
hitters notching at least nine kills.
Freshman outside hitter Alix Kline
man led the Cardinal with 16.
Oregon scored the first four
points of the match, mostly on Stan
ford hitting errors, before Stanford
finally got on the board. The Cardi
nal fought back to tie at seven and
took the lead for good with a five
point run from there. The Ducks
fought back within two, but Stanford
closed out the game, 30-24, on a kill
by junior middle blocker Foluke Ak
inradewo.
The second game was hard
fought from start to finish, with nei
ther team leading by more than two
until the final point. With the game
tied at 24-24. Oregon put together a
6-4 run and won the game 30-27 with
a kill by 1 leather Mvers.

Akinradewo scored a kill on the
first point of the third game and then
tallied three consecutive blocks, one
with senior setter Bryn Kehoe and a
pair with junior right side Erin
Waller. Waller came to the service
line with Stanford up 17-14 and
served eight straight points, includ
ing two aces, to put the game out of
reach. A missed Oregon serve ended
the game at 30-19.
Stanford carried that momentum
into the final frame, pulling away
from a tie at seven to win the game
30-17. Twice in the game, junior out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza served
back-to-back aces during runs of five
and six points. Kehoe was at the serv
ice line for seven points and served
an ace as well against the suddenly
hapless Ducks. Stanford won the
match on a Klineman kill.
Along with Klineman's team high
16 kills, Akinradewo had 13 — hit
ting at a .667 clip — Barboza
chipped in 12, Waller notched 10 and
senior middle blocker Franci Girard
finished with nine.
Akinradewo was the top blocker
for the Cardinal, with assists on eight
of the Cardinal's 15 blocks. Waller
had four total, three of them solo
stuffs.
Barboza led the team with four
service aces and 13 digs. Waller
served two aces and Kehoe one, and
Kehoe and freshman libero Gabi
Ailes had dug 11 balls each.
Oregon libero Katie Swoboda
had a match-high 20 digs.
The Cardinal will be back on the
court tomorrow, hosting Oregon
State. The Beavers were swept last
night by No. 8 California in Berkeley.
Next week. Stanford will be on
the road once again, visiting No. 4
Washington, one of two teams to
beat the Cardinal so far in 2007.
