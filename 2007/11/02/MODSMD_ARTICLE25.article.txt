## Weekend warriors 
### 
Tennis legend and Stanford alum John
McEnroe once said,"l'll let the rack
et do the talking." In today's world,
athletics are publicized anywhere and
everywhere, and people are hired to make
predictions about what they think will hap
pen in sporting events.
The truth is. the players are the ones that

decide the outcomes. An announcer or an
expert can sit there all day and talk about
what he or she thinks will happen, but the
player on the field in the thick of the action
is the one calling the shots. No matter what
people say, the game is won or lost on the
field. People sometimes seem shocked by
big upsets, but often the athletes on the
winning side just wanted to win a bit more
than those that lost.
With that said, here are the winners and
losers of this weekend in college sports.
Winner: Stanford Field Hockey
After a 6-0 start to the season and a nation
al ranking, the last few weeks have been
rough on Stanford. 1 lowever, the team still
sits at 10-7 and is the No. 2 seed for this

weekend's NorPac Tournament.
Hie tournament will be played at home,
where Stanford is most comfortable play
ing and has had much success this season.
They have already won their opening
round game and are in the semi finals
today. A potential finals match-up against
top-seeded California looms for Stanford,
but the ladies should be able to take the
Bears on their third try. The Cardinal has
lost two close matches to the Bears this
year but three could be the magic number.
Stanford should be motivated enough to
pull out the victory and walk away as Nor-
Pac tournament champions for the third
time in school history.
Loser: Connecticut

It is amazing to think that we are talking
about Connecticut in a sport other than
basketball. If you haven't noticed, Con
necticut football is 7-1. first place in the Big
East, and ranked No. 13 in the country.
Their biggest wins have included a one
point road victory at Virginia and a home
victory over then-No. 10 South Florida last
weekend.
Connecticut gets Rutgers on Saturday
after the Scarlet Knights got handled last
week by West Virginia. Rutgers still can
play ball, and Connecticut seems in a little
over its head right now. The Big East just
lacks a clear frontrunner right now â€” Rut-
