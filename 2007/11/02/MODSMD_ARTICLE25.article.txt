## Weekend warriors 
### 
Tennis legend and Stanford alum John
McEnroe once said,"l'll let the rack
et do the talking." In today's world,
athletics are publicized anywhere and
everywhere, and people are hired to make
predictions about what they think will hap
pen in sporting events.
The truth is. the players are the ones that

decide the outcomes. An announcer or an
expert can sit there all day and talk about
what he or she thinks will happen, but the
player on the field in the thick of the action
is the one calling the shots. No matter what
people say, the game is won or lost on the
field. People sometimes seem shocked by
big upsets, but often the athletes on the
winning side just wanted to win a bit more
than those that lost.
With that said, here are the winners and
losers of this weekend in college sports.
Winner: Stanford Field Hockey
After a 6-0 start to the season and a nation
al ranking, the last few weeks have been
rough on Stanford. 1 lowever, the team still
sits at 10-7 and is the No. 2 seed for this

weekend's NorPac Tournament.
Hie tournament will be played at home,
where Stanford is most comfortable play
ing and has had much success this season.
They have already won their opening
round game and are in the semi finals
today. A potential finals match-up against
top-seeded California looms for Stanford,
but the ladies should be able to take the
Bears on their third try. The Cardinal has
lost two close matches to the Bears this
year but three could be the magic number.
Stanford should be motivated enough to
pull out the victory and walk away as Nor-
Pac tournament champions for the third
time in school history.
Loser: Connecticut

It is amazing to think that we are talking
about Connecticut in a sport other than
basketball. If you haven't noticed, Con
necticut football is 7-1. first place in the Big
East, and ranked No. 13 in the country.
Their biggest wins have included a one
point road victory at Virginia and a home
victory over then-No. 10 South Florida last
weekend.
Connecticut gets Rutgers on Saturday
after the Scarlet Knights got handled last
week by West Virginia. Rutgers still can
play ball, and Connecticut seems in a little
over its head right now. The Big East just
lacks a clear frontrunner right now â€” Rut-
gers desperately needs a win to stay
in the race. They will go into Con
necticut and win a tough game.
Winner: Mens Water Polo
Stanford has a pair of match-ups
against California schools to high
light a busy weekend.The No. 4 Car
dinal plays No. 8 UC-Davis and No.
13 Pacific in two important confer
ence games. The team should win
both games as they have had a rough
schedule up to this point. Cardinal
water polo has played the top teams
in the nation multiple times lately as
a result of its tournament-heavy
schedule. The team is coming off a
big win last Sunday over No. 5 Pep
perdine and looks to keep rolling.
Sophomores Drac and Janson Wigo
and Sage Wright will lead the scor
ing attack in a winning weekend for
the team.
Loser: Arizona State
Undefeated No. 6 Arizona State
goes on the road against red-hot No.
4 Oregon in a game with huge Pac
-10 and BCS championship implica
tions. The Sun Devils are ranked
seventh nationally in scoring de
fense while the Ducks are fifth in
total offense. This game will come
down to mistakes and control of the
ball, and Oregon (at home again)
will limit their mistakes in taking
control of the game.
Arizona State quarterback Rudy
Carpenter was unable to throw on
Tuesday after spraining his thumb in
last week's win over Cal, but he
threw well yesterday in practice and
says that he will be healthy for the
game. If Carpenter is hindered at all
during this game, it could spell trou
ble for the Sun Devils. Expect Ore
gon's BCS chances and control of
the Pac-10 to be further established
when all is said and done.
Winner: Stanford Football
0.K., I know 1 said they would win
last week against Oregon State
when they were perhaps over
matched, but I'm going with them
again and here's why: Washington
has given up exactly 147 points in
their last three games (an average of
49 per game) and Stanford is at
home, having just played against the
toughest defense in the conference.
Washington has been struggling
lately and is still winless in the Pac
-10. Stanford, on the other hand, still
has a legitimate shot at winning six
games and qualifying for its first
bowl since 2002. The Cardinal ab
solutely needs this victory if it wants
to achieve six wins, and the players
will surely be motivated enough.
Cardinal football will win and beat
former head coach Tyrone Willing
ham for the second straight year.
