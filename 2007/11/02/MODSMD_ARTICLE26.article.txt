### DANNY BELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a day filled with closer-than-expected matches and
a few big upsets, two Stanford players are still standing,
moving on to the second round of the ITA National In
door Championships in Columbus. Ohio.
Sophomore Richard Wire and freshman Alex Clayton
won their opening round singles matches in straight sets
yesterday, while teammates junior Blake Muller and
freshman Ted Kelly suffered an opening round defeat in
doubles play.
Wire won 6-3.6-3 over Jack Baker of South Alabama
and today plays Adam I lolmstrom of Denver, who upset
second-seeded Travis Helgeson from Georgia in straight
sets.
Clayton breezed through the first set against Dominic
Ingot of Virginia but faced a much closer battle in the sec
ond set. He ultimately prevailed with the win.6-1,7-6 (7-
5). He moves on to play Bassam Bei
das from Pepperdine, another sur
prising victor over the sixth-seeded
Erling Tveit from the Unversity of
Mississippi. Beidas won in three sets,
winning the last two 7-6,7-6.
Stanford's doubles team of Muller
and Kelly lost their first round match
to Andy Connelly and Ross Cunning
ham from the University ofTUlsa,9-7.
The indoor courts are fast and
after yesterday it seems that no play
er is going to be heavily favored in
any match. Play continues tomorrow
with Clayton and Wire looking for
spots in the quarterfinals.
