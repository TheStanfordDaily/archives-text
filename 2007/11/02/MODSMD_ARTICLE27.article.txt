### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One down, four to go.
Junior Jessica Nguyen of the
Stanford women's tennis team sur
vived the first round of play at the
2007 Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion (ITA) National Indoor Cham
pionships at Columbus, Ohio de
spite a last-minute change of oppo
nent.
Her 6-3,6-3 victory over Katari
na Zoricic of William & Mary ad
vanced the junior one step closer to
the finals of the Indoors, perhaps
one of the toughest tournaments of
the season. The draw features the
top 32 players in the nation by invi
tation only.
Moreover. Nguyen faces the re
sponsibility of being the lone Cardi
nal woman at the event.
"It's pretty intense," Nguyen
said. "Everyone is here to get wins
and improve their rankings this sea
son. It's probably more intense for
me because I'm the only person
here from Stanford on the women's
side."
Earlier, Nguyen was slated to
face Armstrong Pacific's Johanna
Dahlback in her first match. 1 lowev
er, Zoricic was a late replacement
for Dahlback, who is the I TA Small
College Champion.
"I just found out that I would
play against her last night." Nguyen
said. "I've seen her play a little be

fore in the juniors. Katarina was
ranked No. 1 in Canada for a while."
Both players struggled to adjust
to the faster indoor courts, but it was
Nguyen who came out on top.
"Towards the end. I got my tim
ing down better and I started to pull
away, which got her frustrated."
Nguyen said. "Fortunately. I came
away with the win."
Today. Nguyen will face the sec
ond seeded Susie Babos of Califor
nia. The 2006 NCAA singles cham
pion won her first round match 6-2,
4-6.6-4 against Elena Gantcheva of
I \l\
Though Nguyen was eliminated
in the second round at last year's In
doors, she hopes to have better suc
cess this time around.
"I've never played her before but
I've known her for quite a while,"
Nguyen said. "I've seen teammates
play her and she's a pretty erratic
player mentally. I just have to stay
focused during tight points and get
her frustrated, and hopefully that
will be enough to get me into the
quarterfinals."
Despite the uncertainty ahead.
Nguyen is content with her play so
fai
"It's always exciting to come
here and to come out of the first day
with a win. especially representing
Stanford."
