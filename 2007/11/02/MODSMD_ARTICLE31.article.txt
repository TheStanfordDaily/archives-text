# Editors' Note
## 
### 
It's been a momentously grumpy week here at Intermis
sion: two of the editors (Nat and Nut) waved their creak
ing, arthritic hands goodbye to sweet fleeting youth when
they turned 21. What's the point of being legal when the
only controlled beverage you're chugging is Metamucil?!
As though our impending mortalities weren't depressing
enough. Week Six drudgery thrusts us all facedown in a
roiling hotbed of papers, p-sets and Plath-magnitude
psychiatric meltdowns. But when the going gets tough,
the tough ... get grumpy.
This week we have been individually or collectively
grouched up by cataclysmic events such as head-on bike
crashes on our own birthdays — flipping upside-down in
the Escondido turn-around. A 12-hour marathon dorm
chat flame war about insipid Azia Kim shirts that nobody
planned on wearing in the first place. That one friend
who loudly and continuously screams that the world is

coming to an end because she has to write a few papers
— just like every other damn student on this campus. As
yet-unjaded freshmen having wholesome youthful frolics
at Mausoleum Party, Frosh Formal and Moonsplash
while we clutch at our furrowed old-man brows with
liver-spotted fingers.Oh, an apparently there was also
some sort of an earthquake.
As we buckle down for the marrow-chilling terror of that
last trudging week before Thanksgiving (and before all
you frosh give your significant others back home your
FMOTQ mono then break up with them), let's take a
moment to enjoy these tender days in the bloom of our
youths in the best way possible: by bitching about any
thing and everything until midterms go away.
Grimaces,
Kat, Natalie and Nutallee
