## "Miracle in Rwanda" engages audience 
### KARMIA CAO INTERMISSION AESTHETIC ACTIVIST 
We wear bold t-shirts and neon bracelets, join Face
book groups that begin with "Save" and, at most, attend
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur (STAND) meetings
and public rallies. Sometimes it feels as if this is all our gen
eration can manage. This, and waiting for more numbing
statistics, more "coverage" in the form of nondescript, rac
ing lines at the bottom of our television screens and, of
course, being told to wait some more. Arc we sedated or
are we realistic? What more can we do? Or, more impor
tantly, how much do we really care? Perhaps this is why I
found it difficult to maintain eye contact with the creator
and solo actor of "Miracle in Rwanda" when she said con
fidently, "College students still believe the world can be
changed; this is why change is still possible."
This is a true story. Leslie Lewis Sword is Immacul6e
llibagiz, a college student returning home to be with her
parents and two older brothers for Easter in April 1994.
After the radio announced the assassination of the presi
dent. Immaculee's father rushed her to their local pastor's
home for hiding as Hutu rebels began the Tutsi extermina
tion. For 91 days, lmmaculee crouched in a secret three by
four foot bathroom with seven other Tutsi women as near
ly a million were slaughtered outside and gangs constant
ly ransacked the pastor's home in search of Tutsi "cock
roaches." "Miracle in Rwanda" follows Immaculee's spir
itual journey through these three months of unimaginable
torture and the impossible forgiveness that freed her to
begin her life as a survivor.
Sword's heart-rending portrayal of lm
maculee, who is becoming known as the
"Anne Frank our age," is only topped

by her mastery of slipping in and out otother characters
throughout the show's 70 minutes. Because of these seam
less transitions, it was as if the stage were teeming with
people. This novel format makes the play an artistic
achievement, not just a political piece urging activism. In
fact. Sword says, "I'm an actor, not a politician. But I do
believe that changing how we feel about the past is a sure
fire way to changing the future."
And the world's views about the past are changing,
whether we like it or not. The real life Immaculee Ilibagiz,
who is now a public speaker and renowned author, recent
ly commented on the revisionist take on the Rwandan
massacre during a PBS "60 Minutes " interview, saying.
"How can they claim there was no genocide? I challenge
them to find a single child, woman or man from my former
village. They can't. Everyone died."
"Miracle in Rwanda" is a part of the effort to prevent
amnesia while encouraging dialogue. As the pilot of a new
Stanford initiative headed by Professor Rush Rehm called
"Stages of Reconciliation," the play "[takes] the immedi
acy of theater beyond the realm of entertainment and aes
thetics. focusing on issues of moral judgment, ethical
choice and historical memory." Discussions led by
notable guests and Stanford faculty follow each
showing and is a vital forum to achieving the
goal of moving people from the stage in
Pigott Theatre to the world stage.
Stanford is the first of manv

stops for "Miraclc in Rwanda" as it embarks on its world
tour. "You just outta see it," Rehm said, "that's all I have
to say." Beyond the colossal burdens of history and cur
rent atrocities, is there also a personal application? "Yes,"
Sword asserts, "the play is personal as well; forgiveness is
the miraclc cure. If Immaculee could do it, all of us can."
A box is drawn with tape on the stage, one with the
exact measurements of the bathroom that held the eight
women who survived. To watch this play is to be a witness
for the past, the present and the future. The exit of the the
atre is the entrance to a stage where, every day, we testify
to something: apathy or activism, disbelief or relentless
compassion, dichotomies like these or the true freedom
that comes from being on one boat with our world, ac
knowledging it and paddling too.
"Miracle in Rwanda" will be shown Friday through
Sunday at 7 p.ni at Pigott Theater (behind Memorial Au
ditorium). Tickets arc $5 and can be bought at the door or
online at drama.stanford.edu. For more information
