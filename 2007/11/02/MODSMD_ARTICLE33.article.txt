## Oh God: "God is not Great" is not great 
### PAUL GOWDER INTERMISSION ACID-TAB ATHEIST 
I was on page four of Christopher
Hitchens's latest ("God is Not Great")
when the Fear hit for the first time. I heard
a voice screaming, "Who says that? That's
the nadir of declasse tastelessness! It's not
even funny! Who? Who?" over and over.
My tax advisor whipped the butt of his pis
tol back and forth across my temples until
the noise stopped. Now wordless and
bleeding. I passed the book over. He began
to sob as the full impact of Hitchens's wit
less offensiveness hit him right in the pitu
itary. The man whose book jacket blurbs
declare him "an intellectual willing to show
his teeth in the cause of righteousness" had
summarized the whole priest sex abuse
scandal, traumatized children, internation
al cover-ups and all, as follows: "No child's
behind left."
"Shit," my tax advisor muttered. "I
don't know if we have enough drugs for
this trip. As your tax advisor. I advise you
to run out for a couple blotters of acid and
some high-grade heroin."
OK. enough of that. The gonzo book re
view thing is so pre-vernal-equinox-2006.
But if ever a book made me want to dive
into the Great Red Shark and the Nevada
desert and the bad craziness and the up
pers and the downers and the peppers and
the poppers and the screamers and the
laughers and the dancers and the hoppers,
it's this 300-page compendium of weak at-

tempts at wit and
eternal monu
ment to pseudo
intellectual tri
umphalism.
I mean. damn,
dude. Mad Pun
dit! Mad Pundit!
Someone get on

some big mofos.

Rummy would
have provided it

thought it would
help him get in on
the Hoover's

sinccure for disgraced Republicans (like
he needed the help). Send the football
players in and let 'em go USC game on his
ass. Tranq 'im up. truss 'ini down, pump "im

full of thorzie and gently set him back
down behind his desk at Vanity Fair with
instructions to see the Nice Doctor at least
three times a week until the voices stop or
dering him to write the really ridiculous
things. c
The book is self-critiquing. Just look.
Hitchens on his fellow atheists: "Our belief
is not a belief." (Is there an epistemological
surgeon in the house? We need a doxas
tiectomy, stat!) Hitchens on Augustine:
"laughably ignorant of the germ theory of
disease." (Haha! That blithering oaf had
never heard of wave-particle duality ei
ther!) Hitchens on end-of-the-world
myths: "One's own death is canceled — or
perhaps repaid or compensated — by the
obliteration of all others." And as if below
the-belt amateur psychoanalysis weren't
enough, we have outright paranoid con
niption: "As 1 write these words, and as you
read them, people of faith are in their dif
ferent ways planning your and my destruc
tion. and the destruction of all the hard
won human attainments that 1 have
touched upon."
A little of this is semi-tolerable to the
extent there is an argument, or at least a
point, to the damn book. And there is. It's
in chapters six through nine. Those chap
ters are actually pretty good —he at
tempts to systematically shoot down the
claims of the religious about things like the
veracity of their holy books, the superior
morality of believers, etc. The problem
comes with the other chapters, which are

basically a litany (hch heh heh, I said
"litanv") of sins (hch...) by the religious,
combined with bitchy snark designed to
show how smart he is and make fellow

atheists feel good about themselves.
Unfortunately, he's not that smart, and
the book mostly makes this atheist feel bad
about himself for sharing a demographic
political class with the vile boor.
And nothing in this book is going to de-

convert a be

doubt, had
they been
written by an
able advo
cate. But the
rest is noth
ing more
than a cher
ry-picked
catalog of

the enormities perpetrated in the course of
faith. Hitchens, of course, ignores the enor
mities perpetrated in the course of every
other major human motivation (greed,
lust, fear, ideqlogy, jealousy, honor, social
ization. race, class, gender, adventure,
boredom, competitiveness, shame, etc.).
The way this species rolls, one day exercise
nuts gonna pop a genocide. (Perhaps a
demagogue will inflame them by laying
their rising health insurance costs at the
beslippered'feet of the sedentary.) After
which 1 hope to see Hitchens write a book
entitled. "Stair Is Not My Master." Then
ril write a nasty review of that. too. And
the cycle of birth, death and rebirth contin
ues.
So put yourself in the place of a believ
er reading the book. If you are, like
Hitchens's foils, a killing, repressing, mo
lesting. pig-hating, etc. maniac, you'll see
nothing wrong with the nasty activity. (Or,
at most, feel guilty and attribute that guilt
to your religion and your behavior to your
ungodly desires.) If not, you'll think that
the beliefs you hold lead you away from,
not toward, killing, repressing, etc. Either
way. you'll realize the book is an ugly hissy
fit. written in a totally irrational frame of
mind. And as if to ensure that he won't per
suade anyone at all. Hitchens is careful to
plop down the most offensive, malicious,
and vitriolic bits right at the beginning.
And his stylistic choices make me think
he consciously models himself on Stewie

from Family Guy. Observe the following
piece of snide fastidiousness: "The most
educated person in the world has to admit
— I shall not say confess — that he or she
knows less and less..." Does he really think
that uttering the word "confess" will, infect

him with the God-cootics?
Beetlejuice, Beetle
juice, Beetlejuice! And the
middlebrow arrogance!
"But the literal mind does
not understand the ironic
mind, and sees it always as a
source of danger." (Or
maybe he meant that sen
tence ironically. Woah.
Deep.) Maybe a better com
parison would be to the
comic book store guy on The
Simpsons.
OK. look. I shouldn't
have to write this review. I
agree that religion has most
ly been a pernicious influ
ence in our politics, our his
tory. our education, our
class system, our public
health, fo' sho' pretty much

everything, hear? I'm the man who once
proposed that we atheists get a "There is
no God Day" in late December to compete
with Christmas, Chanukah, Yule, etc. But
the attack on everything even tangentially
associated with religion is such over
wrought, overasserted, overwritten,
overblown rubbish! Hitchens seems to
think that everything that has ever had the
taint of religion is irredeemably corrupted.
What could have been a compelling book
length argument against faith is instead a
half-microwaved argumentative potato
packaged in a melting shrinkwrap of plas
tic pseudowit and paranoid fanaticism.
Obviously, the audience for the book is
composed of not-very-intelligcnt atheists
who need a mediocre writer to give them
an excuse to feel smug. If you're in that cat
egory, you'll probably get a few jollies out
of the book. Though even you would do
better reading Dennett or Dawkins or
someone else intelligent and civilized. A
philosopher and a scientist (respectively),
they each had someone to teach them how
to construct an argument. That's a contin
gency that Hitchens evidently never en
countered.
Incidentally, I wonder what Hitchens
has to say to the monks in Burma, who are
finally earning their moral authority even
as they use it to resist an atavistic, ravening
despotism? But please, nobody tell me. I
can't bear to see any more of his hysterical
nonsense.

fit. written in a totally irrational frame of
mind. And as if to ensure that he won't per
suade anyone at all. Hitchens is careful to
plop down the most offensive, malicious,
and vitriolic bits right at the beginning.
And his stylistic choices make me think
he consciously models himself on Stewie

from Family Guy. Observe the following
piece of snide fastidiousness: "The most
educated person in the world has to admit
— I shall not say confess — that he or she
knows less and less..." Does he really think
that uttering the word "confess" will, infect

him with the God-cootics?
Beetlejuice, Beetle
juice, Beetlejuice! And the
middlebrow arrogance!
"But the literal mind does
not understand the ironic
mind, and sees it always as a
source of danger." (Or
maybe he meant that sen
tence ironically. Woah.
Deep.) Maybe a better com
parison would be to the
comic book store guy on The
Simpsons.
OK. look. I shouldn't
have to write this review. I
agree that religion has most
ly been a pernicious influ
ence in our politics, our his
tory. our education, our
class system, our public
health, fo' sho' pretty much

everything, hear? I'm the man who once
proposed that we atheists get a "There is
no God Day" in late December to compete
with Christmas, Chanukah, Yule, etc. But
the attack on everything even tangentially
associated with religion is such over
wrought, overasserted, overwritten,
overblown rubbish! Hitchens seems to
think that everything that has ever had the
taint of religion is irredeemably corrupted.
What could have been a compelling book
length argument against faith is instead a
half-microwaved argumentative potato
packaged in a melting shrinkwrap of plas
tic pseudowit and paranoid fanaticism.
Obviously, the audience for the book is
composed of not-very-intelligcnt atheists
who need a mediocre writer to give them
an excuse to feel smug. If you're in that cat
egory, you'll probably get a few jollies out
of the book. Though even you would do
better reading Dennett or Dawkins or
someone else intelligent and civilized. A
philosopher and a scientist (respectively),
they each had someone to teach them how
to construct an argument. That's a contin
gency that Hitchens evidently never en
countered.
Incidentally, I wonder what Hitchens
has to say to the monks in Burma, who are
finally earning their moral authority even
as they use it to resist an atavistic, ravening
despotism? But please, nobody tell me. I
can't bear to see any more of his hysterical
nonsense.


I was on page four of Christopher
Hitchens's latest ("God is Not Great")
when the Fear hit for the first time. I heard
a voice screaming, "Who says that? That's
the nadir of declasse tastelessness! It's not
even funny! Who? Who?" over and over.
My tax advisor whipped the butt of his pis
tol back and forth across my temples until
the noise stopped. Now wordless and
bleeding. I passed the book over. He began
to sob as the full impact of Hitchens's wit
less offensiveness hit him right in the pitu
itary. The man whose book jacket blurbs
declare him "an intellectual willing to show
his teeth in the cause of righteousness" had
summarized the whole priest sex abuse
scandal, traumatized children, internation
al cover-ups and all, as follows: "No child's
behind left."
"Shit," my tax advisor muttered. "I
don't know if we have enough drugs for
this trip. As your tax advisor. I advise you
to run out for a couple blotters of acid and
some high-grade heroin."
OK. enough of that. The gonzo book re
view thing is so pre-vernal-equinox-2006.
But if ever a book made me want to dive
into the Great Red Shark and the Nevada
desert and the bad craziness and the up
pers and the downers and the peppers and
the poppers and the screamers and the
laughers and the dancers and the hoppers,
it's this 300-page compendium of weak at-

tempts at wit and
eternal monu
ment to pseudo
intellectual tri
umphalism.

dude. Mad Pun
dit! Mad Pundit!

full of thorzie and gently set him back
down behind his desk at Vanity Fair with
instructions to see the Nice Doctor at least
three times a week until the voices stop or
dering him to write the really ridiculous
things. c
The book is self-critiquing. Just look.
Hitchens on his fellow atheists: "Our belief
is not a belief." (Is there an epistemological
surgeon in the house? We need a doxas
tiectomy, stat!) Hitchens on Augustine:
"laughably ignorant of the germ theory of
disease." (Haha! That blithering oaf had
never heard of wave-particle duality ei
ther!) Hitchens on end-of-the-world
myths: "One's own death is canceled — or
perhaps repaid or compensated — by the
obliteration of all others." And as if below
the-belt amateur psychoanalysis weren't
enough, we have outright paranoid con
niption: "As 1 write these words, and as you
read them, people of faith are in their dif
ferent ways planning your and my destruc
tion. and the destruction of all the hard
won human attainments that 1 have
touched upon."
A little of this is semi-tolerable to the
extent there is an argument, or at least a
point, to the damn book. And there is. It's
in chapters six through nine. Those chap
ters are actually pretty good —he at
tempts to systematically shoot down the
claims of the religious about things like the
veracity of their holy books, the superior
morality of believers, etc. The problem
comes with the other chapters, which are

basically a litany (hch heh heh, I said
"litanv") of sins (hch...) by the religious,
combined with bitchy snark designed to
show how smart he is and make fellow

atheists feel good about themselves.
Unfortunately, he's not that smart, and
the book mostly makes this atheist feel bad
about himself for sharing a demographic
political class with the vile boor.
And nothing in this book is going to de-

convert a be

rest is noth

than a cher

mities perpetrated in the course of every

lust, fear, ideqlogy, jealousy, honor, social
ization. race, class, gender, adventure,
boredom, competitiveness, shame, etc.).

demagogue will inflame them by laying
their rising health insurance costs at the

entitled. "Stair Is Not My Master." Then
ril write a nasty review of that. too. And
the cycle of birth, death and rebirth contin
ues.
So put yourself in the place of a believ
er reading the book. If you are, like
Hitchens's foils, a killing, repressing, mo
lesting. pig-hating, etc. maniac, you'll see
nothing wrong with the nasty activity. (Or,
at most, feel guilty and attribute that guilt
to your religion and your behavior to your
ungodly desires.) If not, you'll think that
the beliefs you hold lead you away from,
not toward, killing, repressing, etc. Either
way. you'll realize the book is an ugly hissy
fit. written in a totally irrational frame of
mind. And as if to ensure that he won't per
suade anyone at all. Hitchens is careful to
plop down the most offensive, malicious,
and vitriolic bits right at the beginning.
And his stylistic choices make me think
he consciously models himself on Stewie

from Family Guy. Observe the following
piece of snide fastidiousness: "The most
educated person in the world has to admit

that uttering the word "confess" will, infect
