## The 						Old Men and the Cream(ery) 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION GERIATRIC GOURMANDS 
A recent weekday lunch at the downtown Palo Alto Cream
ery featured:
1) Two or three 30-something dot-com homeboys catching up
over lunch;
2) A mommy engaged in lollipop diplomacy with her disgrun
tled toddler;
3) A middle-aged couple in argyle sweaters and fancy slacks
reading The New York Times instead of talking to each other;
and
4) A whole bunch of old people.

We have nothing against old people. We even find them kind
of wonderful, especially when they knock hack entire glasses of
strawberry milkshake in one dramatic inhalation — we swear

we saw at least four granddads attempting
this feat. So for our own juvenile kicks, we
tried to emulate the style and suavity of
the elderly lunch crowd clientele, which
started off with a skeptical and loud ap
praisal of the menu. The subject of our most

vigorous critique was the salad selection. 'ITie
Creamery features seven salad items — all of
which are damned overpriced, as t hey sit in the
$6-$ 12 range — but even if they taste as great
as the rest of the menu, nobody should go to a
diner that specializes in "Fountain and Grill" to
get a plate of leaves. Dismissed instantly.

But the rest of the Creamery's menu proved
harder to criticize. It's a difficult place to be
grumpy: the restaurant, formerly known as the
Peninsula Fountain and Grill, has been around
since 1923 (when we were born!) and is authenti
cally cheery, with polished red scats at the
counter and leatherette booths galore. Besides,
the place knows what a diner should be. For one, il

should feature an array of delicious breakfast foods all day. Al
though they insist on calling it "Breakfust" (when we were
young, you judged a man by his spelling and his bowtie). the
Creamery has a fine spread of heavily buttered classic breakfast
items — pancakes, waffles, toast, omelets, etc. — which are
served up in portions for real men. not that hanky-panky crap
that some local establishments serve. All egg dishes are served
with toast and some variety of potato ("home fries" or hash
browns), a nice foil to the draconian one-starch policy that those
new-age hippies brought about.
A diner should also have coffee, This one did. And in small
cups, we might add. 'Die waiters did refill our cups, but they
weren't fast enough. And they wouldn't stop to look at pictures
of our grandchildren. They did have milkshakes, which was
good, but who pays $5.50 for a milkshake? Iliat could have
bought you 22 copies of The New York Times, back when The
1 imes cost a quarter. Willikers. (We ordered one anyway.)

As for real food, Janet ordered a
burger, because what's so terrible about
burgers? The Creamery offers fancy
things like bacon burgers and turkey
burgers and burgers with avocado and
burgers with champagne, hut Janet has no
need for extravagance, just enough meat to
keep her blood red and American. Ruth or
dered an egg and bacon sandwich, on toast-

Ed rye. with the eggs over easy. She repealed
"over easy" three times and demonstrated
with her hands what a runny yolk looks like.
That hooligan of a waiter brought a sandwich

with eggs that weren't over easy. Iliey were
over quite firm. Firm as thai upstart female
running for the presidency. Ruth would have
sent the sandwich back, but she was distracted
by Janet's stories about WW 11.
To break persona for a paragraph or three,
let us admit that the Creamery serves deli
cious food. The standard burger features a ten-

der, flavorful patty on a soft sesame bun substantial enough to
absorb the juices from the beef without overwhelming the
whole sandwich. The egg and bacon sandwich — despite the ab
sence of the runny, rich yolk we had hoped would mollify the
stillness of the bacon and bread — also demonstrated ad
mirable construction. The bacon had been fried into the egg,
and this quasi-omelette, in turn, fit neatly between the slices of
buttered rye toast. Sandwiches are served with a choice of sides,
among which the thick, uneven fries with crisp outsides and
mealy insides reign supreme. Nearly as good was the potato
salad, though the modest heap of five or six potato hunks was
nothing compared to the small mountain of fries that came with
the burger. Our two cents: skip the coleslaw, which we saw limp
and drowning in its mayo dressing — and if you must have veg
etables, try the greens, which an earlier visit (out of old-man per
sona) demonstrated to be unremarkable but fresh.
Ice cream, as you may have guessed from the Creamery's
name, is something the restaurant handles with panache. A sin
gle scoop of ice cream is delightfully large and is served in a glass
cup that recalls the ice cream parlors of yore (a.k.a. our 20s) —
we recommend the Pralines n'Cream, and the Mocha Almond
Fudge. The Oreo mint milkshake we ordered was large enough
for two; what didn't fit in the classic sundae glass was served in
the large tin cup the shake had been mixed in. and we admit to
being charmed by this typical retro diner move.
All you young people who think we just sit here because we
don t have adventurous tastes — you don't know what you're
talking about. We use our hard-earned money on a restaurant
that's a little expensive, but unapologetic about its specialty
(greasy diner food and ice cream) and accomplishes it with scale
and flavor that is unrivaled by the weak, punk chain diners on
and around I Jniversity Avenue. You call tiny pieces of raw fish
a meal? You call cheesecake dinner? Well, we don't. (Jolly gee
gosh, no. But this diner isn't any of that crap; it's true blue.

A diner should also have coffee, This one did. And in small
cups, we might add. 'Die waiters did refill our cups, but they
weren't fast enough. And they wouldn't stop to look at pictures
of our grandchildren. They did have milkshakes, which was
good, but who pays $5.50 for a milkshake? Iliat could have
bought you 22 copies of The New York Times, back when The
1 imes cost a quarter. Willikers. (We ordered one anyway.)

As for real food, Janet ordered a
burger, because what's so terrible about
burgers? The Creamery offers fancy
things like bacon burgers and turkey
burgers and burgers with avocado and
burgers with champagne, hut Janet has no
need for extravagance, just enough meat to
keep her blood red and American. Ruth or
dered an egg and bacon sandwich, on toast-

Ed rye. with the eggs over easy. She repealed
"over easy" three times and demonstrated
with her hands what a runny yolk looks like.
That hooligan of a waiter brought a sandwich

with eggs that weren't over easy. Iliey were
over quite firm. Firm as thai upstart female
running for the presidency. Ruth would have
sent the sandwich back, but she was distracted
by Janet's stories about WW 11.
To break persona for a paragraph or three,
let us admit that the Creamery serves deli
cious food. The standard burger features a ten-

der, flavorful patty on a soft sesame bun substantial enough to
absorb the juices from the beef without overwhelming the
whole sandwich. The egg and bacon sandwich — despite the ab
sence of the runny, rich yolk we had hoped would mollify the
stillness of the bacon and bread — also demonstrated ad
mirable construction. The bacon had been fried into the egg,
and this quasi-omelette, in turn, fit neatly between the slices of
buttered rye toast. Sandwiches are served with a choice of sides,
among which the thick, uneven fries with crisp outsides and
mealy insides reign supreme. Nearly as good was the potato
salad, though the modest heap of five or six potato hunks was
nothing compared to the small mountain of fries that came with
the burger. Our two cents: skip the coleslaw, which we saw limp
and drowning in its mayo dressing — and if you must have veg
etables, try the greens, which an earlier visit (out of old-man per
sona) demonstrated to be unremarkable but fresh.
Ice cream, as you may have guessed from the Creamery's
name, is something the restaurant handles with panache. A sin
gle scoop of ice cream is delightfully large and is served in a glass
cup that recalls the ice cream parlors of yore (a.k.a. our 20s) —
we recommend the Pralines n'Cream, and the Mocha Almond
Fudge. The Oreo mint milkshake we ordered was large enough
for two; what didn't fit in the classic sundae glass was served in
the large tin cup the shake had been mixed in. and we admit to
being charmed by this typical retro diner move.
All you young people who think we just sit here because we
don t have adventurous tastes — you don't know what you're
talking about. We use our hard-earned money on a restaurant
that's a little expensive, but unapologetic about its specialty
(greasy diner food and ice cream) and accomplishes it with scale
and flavor that is unrivaled by the weak, punk chain diners on
and around I Jniversity Avenue. You call tiny pieces of raw fish
a meal? You call cheesecake dinner? Well, we don't. (Jolly gee
gosh, no. But this diner isn't any of that crap; it's true blue.
