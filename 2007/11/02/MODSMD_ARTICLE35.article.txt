## Radiohead slightly static 
### PAUL CRAFT KZSU RAINBOW CONNECTOR 
In one sense, an old dog did learn a new
trick. When Radiohead released their new
album, "In Rainbows," on October 10th, their
business plan got more buzz than their actual
music. This fact was more or less justified —
Radiohead's strategy of digitally releasing the
album, and then letting fans determine their
own prices, was an experiment bound to have
lasting repercussions. In comparison, the actu
al music of "In Rainbows" comes off as less of
a revelation. But don't let this fact fool you: "In
Rainbows" is one of Radiohead's best offer
ings in years.
"In Rainbows" is the most consistently lis

tenable and coherent album since Kid A. It is
Radiohead's complete return to traditional in
struments — guitar, bass and drums — but not
the band's return to traditional song structures.
The album comes off, then, as the instrumental
interpretation of the band's famously experi
mental streak; there is scant a chorus, boring
refrain or commonplace melody to be found.
"In Rainbows" chugs along with the crisp
thwack of drums, swoons and sways with
strings, and soars with harmonies. This consis
tency of delivery — all the songs using essen
tially the same musical ingredients — makes

the album a more tightly focused, fully re

alized accomplishment than "Hail to
the Thief' or "Amnesiac." "Hail to

the Thief' (2003) was a particularly
un -

focused smattering of genres and approaches
that had too many peaks and valleys.
"In Rainbows," on the other hand, is emi
nently listenable. Radiohead starts off with the
stuttered tick-rhythm of "15 Steps," suggesting
the possibility of more Kid A-style moments.
Then, after about 45 seconds of this mindset, a
guitar —as if descending from the clouds
above — announces the arrival of the real
album. From there, Johnny Greenwood and
company create a breezily confident shuffle
punctuated by a chorus of kids yelling.

" Yeah!" This small addition is partic-

ularly jarring; in the set
ting -

of Radiohead's insolated universe of loathing
and minor chords, the voice of children, how
ever brief, is an exhilarating addition.
"Bodysnatchers" then contrasts this first
stretch of pop clarity with a sludgy rumble of
distorted guitar and Thorn Yorke taking the
perspective of a soul trapped in the body of a
zombie. Only Radiohead would, first, write
about this and, second, make it such an enjoy
able listen. The highlights of the album from
there include, among many, the fragile insis
tence of "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi." the joyous
melody of "Reckoner" and the intensity of
"Jigsaw Falling into Place."

In 20 years, fans might not look back on
"In Rainbows" as a particularly earth-shat
tering musical moment for Radiohead. But
don't overlook the quality of Radiohead's
latest. It might not take the band to lofty
new musical terrain, but it will keep them
i comfortably atop the indie music totem
\ pole. As the band ages, some change is
good, but, sometimes, a return to basics
s also helps.
