# Old Time Rock 'n' Roll
## 
### PAUL CRAFT KZSU AGING ROCKER 
I often sit up at night and wonder what kind
of music our generation will be listening to
when we're old. I mean, will "Hot in Ilere" be
played at nursing home birthday parties? Will
the refrain "Its getting hot in here/ So take off
all your clothes" still resonate deep within our |
aged hearts? Will droning noise rock rever
berate through the halls of the local Elk's
Lodge? Will the local country buffet softly pipe

a Dashboard Confessional Icar-jcrkcr? Perhaps, by then, our favorite
songs will be quaint and retro — musty old tunes from the turn of the
century. (That's what this era will be called in about 20 years.) Maybe
they'll even have the novelty value that many old songs have nowadays.
I wonder this because, well, it may not turn out that way. Perhaps our
music is so steeped in the concerns and themes of youth that it will not
connect with us when we're collecting our imaginary Social Security
checks.
Since the mainstream advent of rock 'n' roll in the mid-19505, popu
lar music has been self-consciously youthful. From the start, rock ex
plicitly appealed to and channeled the feelings of adolescence and often
intentionally cultivated this image. Whether it be Eilvis (who was about
21 at the beginning of his fame) or Buddy Holly (also about 20 when his
career took off), it was an art form that was made by and unquestion
ably lor our nation's youth. Rock was about energy, dancing, sexuality,
angst, rebellion — basically all the feelings that come with a middle
school dance. (Though, for me, I 'd add to that list massive awkwardness
and leather pants. 1 was weird back then.) Rock and roll, in many re
spects, is a genre deliberately opposed to the established, the polite and
the, well, old.
1 low can we. then, reconcile our love for current pop. rap, elcctron
ica. rock and Baltimore electroclash with the inevitability of getting
old? It is a difficult task, as our parents prove on a daily basis. The Baby
Boomers put so much faith in their collective youth that many of them
haven't really moved past it. 1 mean, think of all the things they did with
out any consideration for the future: serious psychedelic drugs, draft
dodging, wearing bell bottoms, listening to the Eagles. We all see that
one guy with a graying ponytail who has been having the same debates
about Led Zeppelin and Nixon since 1973.1 low can we avoid being like
him?
The answer is that, in a very broad sense, we can't. In the future, we
will love our current musical tastes thanks to pure nostalgia. "Beautiful
Girls" won't just be a silly song with the lines "It was back in '99/ Watch
ing movies all the time/ When I did my first crime." No. when we're 64,
Sean Kingston's song will be about the feeling of this period in our lives.
It will be associated with the gauzy golden sheen of Stanford life, the
sunny days of summer 2007. Maybe it will even evoke one particular
party, one particular conversation, one particular person. Point is, it
won't matter that the song will gradually lose some immediate meaning
because the meaning it once had will remain valuable.
On the other hand, let the past be the past. Don't try to live like it's
2007 until it's 2020. Life moves upward and onward. But at least you'll
always have "Hot in 1 lere" to look back on.
