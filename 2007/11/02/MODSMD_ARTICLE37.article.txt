## "Dan" needs life support 
### ERIC MESSINGER INTERMISSION FAMILY THERAPIST 
When watching "Dan in Real Life," it becomes clear where
a lot of grumpy old men come from: family problems.
Steve Carrell plays Dan Burns, a middle-aged widower who
writes a popular advice column about relationships. Raising
his three daughters in the four years since his wife's death has
produced its fair share of domestic tension, as he errs on the
side of over-protectiveness.
All three want to be treated their age. but Dan refuses. Jane
(Alison Pill), 17, wants her father's trust to drive, 17-year-old
Cara (Brittany Robertson) wants approval for her first love,
Marty (Felipe Dieppa), and the youngest, nine-year-old Lily
(Marlene Lawston), wants respect. Dan. for his part, still isn't
ready to move on to the idea of including another woman in his
life.
Despite the strains, Dan insists on making the trip to the
coast of Rhode Island for the annual Burns family get-togeth
er, where his parents, siblings and their families bunk up to
gether in a cabin. From the start, the family presses Dan to
start dating. When sent into town by his mother (Dianne
Wiest), he meets the beautiful Marie (Juliette Binoche.) After
bonding for the day. Dan heads back to the cabin, only to dis
cover, to his horror, that the girl he's just fallen for is the cur-

rent girlfriend of his brother Mitch (Dane Cook) and that
she's staying in the cabin. Cue the impossible dilem-

ma.
"Dan in Real Life" works wilh a fa-
miliar set-up: confine a family or
force them to spend an undue

amount of time to
tie the.and

then strain everyone's relationships as much as possible on the
way toward eventually reaffirming family togetherness.
"Meet the Parents" and "Little Miss Sunshine" both worked
this formula to its full effectiveness, and even "Wedding i
Crashers" briefly exploited the inherent opportunities for 1
mischief. /

At times, the film seems uncertain
about its relationship with these rela
tives. It wants to make fun of sentimen
tality in the mock-tragic early parting
between Cara and Marty — complete
with mournful hand on the glass as the
car drives off — but it earnestly uses
analogous stock devices later on. The
film obligingly traps Dan in a shower
and tosses him off the roof, and the
family makes a stab at togetherness
through crossword puzzles, talent

shows and football games. The film knows and provides the
expected essentials, but half-heartedly, somewhat sheepish at
being part of a near-played-out tradition.
In that sense, the film is much like its lead performance. I'd
find it hard to believe that the part
. . wasn't written for or at least

tailored to Carrell,
as the film draws

on prior traits
of and

passive gesture, hard-earned piece of wisdom and awk
ward comment, and he knows it. This might be the birth of the
meta- c ' ve Carrell movie.
W, ,e he awkwardly ado, .s their tics and quirks, Carrell
also brings from his prior characters, more than anything, an
overpowering loneliness. It permeates everything he does in
the movie. He makes Dan scared, hesitant and longing all at
once. The way this comes across is what is great about his per
formance. The subtle clarity of this portrayal, though, makes
for a very reserved character, and sometimes the film limps
along lifelessly with its lead.
The best moments come when Dan and the film let go of
their self-consciousness and go for broke. The first time the
film makes you care is in the out-of-nowhere flourish of Dan's
first meeting with Marie. The bulk of the scene plays out in one
long, playful take: Dan flirting with Marie, pulling random
books off the shelf as she tries to describe what she's looking
for. He comes alive, smiling and laughing as he enthusiastical
ly hops around his amused companion. The camera refuses to
cut, as anxious about the success of Dan's attempts as he is. It's
a wonderful, charming scene, and there are just enough of
them throughout to make the whole project worthwhile.
Later, the film improbably pulls one off through Pete Town
shend's "Let My Love Open the Door." I can speculate
dreamily as to what the movie would have been like if it had
stuck to these moments of gleeful abandon throughout, but
with its stock construction, these scenes stick out like gems and
keep you interested until it all wraps up.
The final scenes give us a Carrell I've never quite seen before
and an ending in which Dan cheerfully turns down the normal
tidy moral in favor of more unexpected wisdom. By the end,
thankfully, "Dan in Real Life," its hero and the lead perfor
mance break free of the pressures of their relatives, without
disowning them. While they take too long to struggle loose,
they all try their best, finally win out and provide a lot of de
light along the way. It could be just the thing for the grumpy
old man in your life.
