# "Bee Movie" is a B-

### ADAM HAHN INTERMISSION BUZZKILLER 
Jerry Seinfeld, the creator of the greatest sitcom in television history,
has decided to make a movie for kids? Did I hear that right? Is the man
who made "soup Nazi" and "master of your domain" household terms
losing his edge?
Like most people, I was pretty skeptical when 1 heard Seinfeld want
ed to make an animated film with bees as main characters. But I was not
let down when 1 saw what he has been brewing for the last four years.
"Bee Movie," while lacking Jerry's caustic sarcasm, stays funny, fresh and
appeals to both adults and children.
Jerry's slightly thinning hair has been supplemented with two anten
nae as he voices the title role of Barry B. Benson, a recent college gradu
ate. Barry doesn't know what to do with the rest of his life and isn't quite
sure if Honex (the place to work in New Hive City) is the right fit for him.
He ventures out of the hive one day and breaks the cardinal rule of being
a bee: Don't talk to humans. As it turns out, bees speak English. They can
also put the moves on women.
Barry meets florist Vanessa (voiced by Rene6 Zellweger) during his
excursion from the hive and is appalled when he discovers that humans
can simply buy honey off the shelves of any market. It is then that he de
cides to correct this injustice and sue the human race.
Jerry's comedy style actually translates well to a kids' big-screen com
edy. He has always been clean in the sense that his stand-up material
doesn't revolve around drinking or sex. This doesn't mean the movie is
boring for the adults, though. It includes plenty of references that will fly
straight over an eight-year-old's head: Barry's parents only want for him
to meet a nice "Bee-ish" girl, Judge Oprah presides over the court and a
mosquito (voiced by Chris Rock) laments that all mosquito girls are al
ways trying to "trade up."
The visuals didn't make me say "wow," but they were comparable to
those of any other contemporary animation film. Also, before you ask,
no, the characters don't look ugly like the ants from "Antz" — think "A
Bug's Life," but more...yellow and black.
When asked what the biggest difference between shooting a TV
show and a movie was, Jerry compared writing a sitcom to going to a
petting zoo blindfolded: "You feel around and you feel some fur there
and there's a tail, but by season four, you know exactly when it likes to
be taken outside and what its favorite foods are. With a movie, you've
got one shot." That didn't stop him from applying his meticulous sense
of comedy, though. Seinfeld says that writing "Bee Movie" let him test
different lines with different crowds, something he couldn't do while
recording a sitcom in front of a live studio audience. Jerry believes
comedy truly is a science and will tweak a joke until it is perfect (best
evidenced in the documentary "Comedian").
My only fear is that parents won't take their

kids to see the film because they can't imagine Jerry
writing for their children. How many times did a child
appear on "Seinfeld"? When they did, how nice were

Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer to them? Jerry
has a bit of a hole to dig himself out of, but if the
public excuses these episodes (in the name of
comedy), I think they'll be pleasantly surprised.

As I was sitting in the press waiting room
of the hotel, 1 was forced to watch the trail
er for the movie on repeat in the DVD play
er. After about the 15th iteration, I real-

ized that the graphic designers used a
font very similar to the "Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids" title lettering. My

guess is they're trying to tap into some
strange "Honey'Vbee/typography sublimi
nal synapses to get people into the theater. I
admit, I wouldn't watch this movie unless I
had to take kids somewhere, but as far as
palatable cinema for the entire family, "Bee
Movie" is a winner.
