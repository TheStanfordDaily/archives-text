## Hump that grump 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SAGE SEDUCTRESS 
Intermission's theme for this week,
Grumpy Old Men, really brings back
the bedtime memories for Roxy. I've
dated four PhD students, three visiting
scholars, two TAs, two post-docs and
one (very poorly chosen) professor.
What has Roxy learned from her older
partner escapades? Forget all the
mumbo-jumbo about emotional
growth; my big take-away has been the
following: Older men are better at get
ting it on.
Fortunately, whippersnappers don't
have to suck in the sack. Roxy's gift this
week is passing on what has made her
not-so-grumpy old men so good.
Talk to me: For the love of God, talk to
your bed buddy! The more experience
you get. the more you'll realize that
your mate isn't a mind reader. And I
don't mean simply screaming, "Harder!
Faster!" I'm advocating for "An inch to
the right." "Make little figure-eights,"
"I like it when you alternate between
going deep and teasing me."
You don't have to give a going
down dissertation in the middle of

the act, but talking about exactly what
turns you on means that your partner
will probably do it far better than if they
had to deduce your cues from moaning
and body language.
If you're a little shy, talking after the act
is a good way to go: "I really liked it
when you did that thing with your
tongue on the back of my neck. You
know where else that would feel really
g00d...?" This type of conversation also
makes long car trips go by much quick
er. Or slower. But in a good way.
It's about the journey, not the destina
tion: There is usually a lot of pressure to
climax with younger partners. Or, at
least, to fake an orgasm. (And, yes, you
have probably been with someone who
has faked it. Even one of my guy friends
told me that he has faked it. So don't
think that this doesn't apply to you.)
But older mates tend to realize that an
O-face isn't always in the cards. Having
sex should feel pretty good, anyway. An
orgasm is just icing on the cake.

While on the subject, let's put
the stupid mutual-orgasm

myth to rest: climaxing together is an in
credibly rare event that requires mas
sive amounts of orchestration and work.
You see sex scenes in movies where the
couple smooches for a few seconds and
then, bam! â€” instant mutual orgasm.
Lies. Focus on having a feel-good time,
and the rest will follow in due course.
Wooing ways: A metaphor: Let's say
that you want some cake, and you want
that cake to taste really good. You don't
eat all day, thinking about that slice of
cake. Then, you go to Cafe Borrone,
and you spend 20 minutes imaging what
the different types of cakes might taste
like. You buy your slice, take it home,
put it on a plate and stare at it, imagining
how you'll eat the icing end first, save
the cake for last, etc. I guarantee that
when you eat that first bite of cake, it's
going to taste pretty fucking awesome.
Now imagine grabbing cake in the din
ing hall, and wolfing it down as you
watch Heros. This is how Stanford stu
dents treat sex and dating. I want you to
treat sex like that slice of cake from

Cafe Borrone. There should be
long dinners, naughty repartee
and lingering backrubs.
Older partners have taught

me that anticipation is half of the fun.
Stop cheating yourself out of gourmet
sex!
It's natural: Maybe it's that older people
have seen more naked people. Maybe
it's that they are more aware of their in
evitable descent into geriatric
ness.Whatever the reason, my older
mates usually aren't bashful about their
bodies or about mine.
People have bad breath in the morning.
They get stubble. They have little
bumps and lumps here and there. So
what? The quicker you get over yourself
and stop wondering if you look ugly
naked, the quicker you can begin to
focus on having a rocking good time be
tween the sheets. Remember: If you're
hooking up with someone, they proba
bly find you attractive. Otherwise, why
would they hook up with you?
As a side/end note, I've noticed that stu
dents at Stanford let the smallest things
become turn-offs. He has hair on his
back, she has gross feet. People, perfec
tion only exists between magazine cov
ers and in your mind. If the worst thing
about your mate is his crooked tooth,
marry him immediately.
