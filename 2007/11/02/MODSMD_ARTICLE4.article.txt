# Evan Moore – Football
## Moore witness to Stanford rebirth 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
Evan Moore has seen it all when it comes
to Stanford Football. From Buddy
Teevensto Walt Harris to Jim Harbaugh
calling his number and from Trent Ed
wards to T.C. Ostrander to Tavita
Pritchard slinging him the football, the 6-foot-7
wideout from Brea, Calif, has experienced more
major team transitions than some programs face
in a decade. But. as he sees it. his role has re
mained constant through all of those changes.
"It's been a myriad of coaches and a myriad of
quarterbacks and a myriad of offenses, really,"
the fifth-year senior said. "You know, it's still
football when it comes down to it."
Following the disastrous 1-11 season last year,
there was some question whether Moore would
return for a fifth season with the Cardinal after
having missed nearly the entire 2005 season with
a hip injury: as a result, he was granted an extra
vear of eligibility. Moore's decision to return was

sealed once he got to know newly-appointed
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh.
"I wasn't looking to be sold on coming back or
re-recruited, per se," Moore said. "But it was
more just kind of getting to know him and getting
that comfortable feeling back — that we were
going in the right direction. And 1 got that feeling
from him immediately. Coach Harbaugh is — in
the very purest form of the word — a winner."
As Moore explained, after witnessing plenty
of Cardinal losses during his first four years on
the Farm (over which Stanford accumulated a 14-
31 record), it was the opportunity to learn from a
new coaching staff that convinced him to come
back.
"As much as I love to consider myself a win
ner. I have four losing years of college football."
he said. "So I could honestly look at myself in the
mirror and say.'Maybe I don't know what it takes
to win in college football, and maybe coach Har-
baugh can come in here and tell us
how to do it.'"
It's a decision that has worked
out very well for Moore, who is en
joying his role on a rejuvenated
Cardinal squad that, with four
games left, is still playing for this
season. If Stanford wins three of its
final four games, Moore could find
himself playing in his first bowl
game.
Still, the senior wideout is not
content with his production. With
337 receiving yards and just one
touchdown thus far, the fifth-year
senior still envisions himself play
ing a big role in the Cardinal's of
fense down the stretch and. given
his height and basketball back
ground, nowhere is that role
greater than in the red zone.
'i feel like I do have a signifi
cant role on this team. It's just been
the way the ball has bounced this
year," Moore explained. "It's kind
of been an interesting year as far as
our offense has gone, kind of up
and-down. But my role is still ex
actly what I want it to be, and any
game could be real big, I know
that."
Regardless of his personal sta
tistics, however. Moore will always
have the memories of helping to re
build the Cardinal program, in
cluding this year's monumental 24-
23 upset win over USC at the L.A.
Coliseum — a game he called a
"huge stepping-stone for the pro
gram." More than anything.
Moore's decision to return for the
2007 season has meant an opportu
nity to witness the beginning of a
new mentality for Stanford.
"I'm just happy because I see

this program going in the right di
rection right now," he said. "And
sometimes 1 think about how excit
ed I am and how happy 1 am to say
that I'm a part of the very begin
ning of that. I'm glad that my fifth
year is coach Harbaugh's first year
because I can say that Hey, 1 was a
big part of bringing that program
back to where it was supposed to
be.'"
As far as his plans for after Stan
ford, Moore is serious about mak
ing the leap to the NFL, no matter
what the doubters may say. And no
matter what the future holds,
Moore's football experience has al
ready carried him a long way.
"As far as playing this game at
the next level, I don't care if there
are any doubts out there that 1 can
do that — there's nothing that's
going to stop me from making the
next level," he said. "I know it's
going to happen. It's just a matter
of where 1 fall. And nothing's going
to get in my way of doing that. And
there might be doubters, but it's
going to happen.
"1 knew [football] could take
me somewhere, and it obviously
has because I'm sitting here al
ready graduated from Stanford
and almost done so it's obviously
taken me somewhere. And just the
ideaiof competition every Saturday
— it doesn't really get any better
than what football has to offer, es
pecially in college and in the Pac
-10. And just the feeling of being on
the field on Saturday is something
I'll never forget."

that I'm a part of the very begin
ning of that. I'm glad that my fifth
year is coach Harbaugh's first year
because I can say that Hey, 1 was a
big part of bringing that program
back to where it was supposed to
be.'"
As far as his plans for after Stan
ford, Moore is serious about mak
ing the leap to the NFL, no matter
what the doubters may say. And no
matter what the future holds,
Moore's football experience has al
ready carried him a long way.
"As far as playing this game at
the next level, I don't care if there
are any doubts out there that 1 can
do that — there's nothing that's
going to stop me from making the
next level," he said. "I know it's
going to happen. It's just a matter
of where 1 fall. And nothing's going
to get in my way of doing that. And
there might be doubters, but it's
going to happen.
"1 knew [football] could take
me somewhere, and it obviously
has because I'm sitting here al
ready graduated from Stanford
and almost done so it's obviously
taken me somewhere. And just the
ideaiof competition every Saturday
— it doesn't really get any better
than what football has to offer, es
pecially in college and in the Pac
-10. And just the feeling of being on
the field on Saturday is something
I'll never forget."

Senior wide receiver Evan Moore could see his role in the offense expand with injuries to tight end Jim Dray and fellow re
ceiver Mark Bradford. Moore's height and basketball background could make him a key red zone target down the stretch.
