## Panelists remember Nanking Talk comes nearly 70 years after Japanese massacre of Chinese 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
From December 1937 to February 1938, approximate
ly 300,000 Chinese people were killed by the Japanese in
a massacre remembered as the "Rape of Nanking."
'In addition.3oo,ooo some young girls from countries
all over Asia were forced into sexual slavery." said Rape
of Nanking Redress Coalition Chairperson Pete Stanek.
Addressing the subject last night as part of the Special
Panel in Commemoration of the Nanking Massacre,
Stanek challenged members of the Stanford community
to better understand the 70-year old events by research
ing the war crimes of the Japanese military.
Panelist Elena Danielson, former associate director
and archivist emerita for the Hoover Institution, drew
parallels between the Japanese invasions of Nanking to
the Nazi assault of Guernica in the same years.Together,
the two incidents were the first examples in history of aer
ial bomb strikes on civilian populations.
The panel itself, hosted by the Stanford East Asia So
ciety, provided attendees with the perspective and insight
of those close to the subject.

East Asia Society Co-President Hao Yan '09 said the
program came in response to recent events related to
Nanking, including a screening of "Nanking Massacre"
six months ago and the dedication of a memorial to Iris
Chang earlier this year. The author of" Rape of Nanking,"
a novel exploring the tragic memory of the massacre,
Chang was commemorated with a bronze statue at the
1 loover Institution in February.
Ihe screening and dedication moved Yan to consult
with faculty from various University departments and ex
plore the extent to which modern East Asia's complex
history has been shaped by memory and identity.
"1 wanted to approach truth in history as close[ly] as
possible, raising important questions about remem
brance of war atrocities, pursuit of peace and justice," Yan
said. "[I also wanted] to hold interactive, individual dis
cussions on international conflict, arriving at definitions
of the past that are mutually reconcilable."
As part of the presentation, Danielson read excerpts
from letters written by Robert Wilson, one of the 27 for
eigners who remained in Nanking during the invasion.

Wilson donated his detailed, scientific and objective jour
nal to the Hoover Institute as early as June 6,1938.
"The scientific, dispassionate doctor tried to remain
objective in his reports," Danielson said. "But you can tell
that he was struggling to keep his emotions under control.
In one entry he describes a 19-year-old girl,six-and-a-half
months pregnant, who was trying to resist rape. Dr. Wil
son writes that she received 18 cuts about the face, sever
al to the legs and a deep gash to the abdomen. A few days
later, he wrote: 'She died last night."'
Violet Fang, one of the co-producers of the "Nanking
Massacre" documentary, gave examples of individuals
who she interviewed while making the film.
"One lady we spoke to was only seven during the mas
sacre," Fang said. "She woke up after fainting, seeing her
mother and sisters naked and dead on the table after
being raped. A Westerner took a picture of her at the
house with all those bodies, so because she had evidence,
she felt strong enough to sue the Japanese. When she sued

the Japanese for what they did. they
sued her back, saying that she was a
total liar."
Iris Chang's parents, Shau-Jin
Chang and Ying-Ying ( hang, were at
last night's panel and recounted the
trials that their daughter faced, as well
as the diligence by which she worked
to uncover more documents.
Iris' extensive research led her to
uncover the diaries of John Rabe, a
German Nazi businessman who
lived in Nanking during the massacre
and tried to save the lives of Chinese
civilians who were being murdered.
But the Changs attributed much of
the success of their daughter's book
to her ability to publicize to the main
stream.
"If there's one lesson to learn from
all of this, it's that if we really want to
get a message out, we have to ap
proach major mainstream public
media," said Ying-Ying Chang.
Daro Inouye, a Japanese-Ameri
can panelist, spoke about the impact
of China and Japan's past history on

relations between Chinese- and
Japanese-American communities.
A public defender in San Francis
co, I nouye challenged members of the
audience not to overlook the current
failures of nation-states when consid
ering the atrocities of the Japanese
army in World War 11.
"It's true that there were horren
dous atrocities committed by the
Japanese government in Nanking "he
said."But look at all the other nations
in Asia who witnessed the atrocities in
the papers and simply let it go on.
"Have we really moved very far
since then?" Inouye added. "We still
read about the atrocities committed
in Africa by t>ne tribe or another, and
we think that since we're not affiliated
with them, we have no responsibility
to do anything."
Inouye's father was an American
soldier in World War 11.
"Hie reason he joined the war was
because he sincerely believed it would
be the last war." he said. "He was
wrong. Ignorance is a disease.and war
is inhumane. War makes us inhumane,
regardless of race, ethnicity or reli
gion."

Iris Chang's parents, Shau-Jin
Chang and Ying-Ying ( hang, were at
last night's panel and recounted the
trials that their daughter faced, as well
as the diligence by which she worked
to uncover more documents.
Iris' extensive research led her to
uncover the diaries of John Rabe, a
German Nazi businessman who
lived in Nanking during the massacre
and tried to save the lives of Chinese
civilians who were being murdered.
But the Changs attributed much of
the success of their daughter's book
to her ability to publicize to the main
stream.
"If there's one lesson to learn from
all of this, it's that if we really want to
get a message out, we have to ap
proach major mainstream public
media," said Ying-Ying Chang.
Daro Inouye, a Japanese-Ameri
can panelist, spoke about the impact
of China and Japan's past history on

relations between Chinese- and
Japanese-American communities.
A public defender in San Francis
co, I nouye challenged members of the
audience not to overlook the current
failures of nation-states when consid
ering the atrocities of the Japanese
army in World War 11.
"It's true that there were horren
dous atrocities committed by the
Japanese government in Nanking "he
said."But look at all the other nations
in Asia who witnessed the atrocities in
the papers and simply let it go on.
"Have we really moved very far
since then?" Inouye added. "We still
read about the atrocities committed
in Africa by t>ne tribe or another, and
we think that since we're not affiliated
with them, we have no responsibility
to do anything."
Inouye's father was an American
soldier in World War 11.
"Hie reason he joined the war was
because he sincerely believed it would
be the last war." he said. "He was
wrong. Ignorance is a disease.and war
is inhumane. War makes us inhumane,
regardless of race, ethnicity or reli
gion."
