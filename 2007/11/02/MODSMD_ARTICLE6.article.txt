## Library garners famous Egyptologist's collection 
### ERIC MESSINGER MAN WRITER 
Students interested in ancient Egypt
ian artifacts and temples now have a
treasure trove of material to explore at
Green 1 library.
Stanford recently acquired the private
library of renowned Egyptologist Wolja
Erichsen (1890-1966). TTie diverse collec
tion of materials covers 1,5(X) years of his
tory. dating back to approximately 650
B.C
Before negotiations were completed,
the collection resided in Copenhagen.
Denmark. The University recently
earned sole possession of the rare docu
ments. which will be stored in Green Li
brary.
"It's really important to have this old
material," said Classics Prof Joe Man
ning. "Obtaining the library is going to re
energize teachers, re-energize students
and even attract more students.These are
hands-on materials. It's exciting for un
dergraduates to work with them, and they
help so much in understanding our rela
tion to the past."
Aditi Iyer, a graduate student in clas
sics, agreed that the materials present an
exciting opportunity.
"I think primary sources like those we
acquired with the Erichsen library are the

best way to study a civilization," she said.
"'Uteres so much room for original inter
pretations when you get to look at the ma
terial firsthand."
ITie collection is particularly valuable
because of the out-of-date publishing
techniques used in some of the pieces.The
bwks feature larger-than-usual photo
graphs of artifacts, which are favorable
compared to digitized, shrunken versions.
" ITiese are very big books," Manning
said. "They're reproducing large texts
and scrolls, even inscriptions on the sides
of temples. You can't reduce those

without losing details. It's not
something you can really get
from an eight by 11." i

ITie Erichsen collection pro
vides a valuable resource for a
field that lost much of its mate-

rial to World War 11 and the
modernization of Egypt. *

"Some of [Erich
sen's] notes are on ma
terials that may no

longer exist," Manning
said.
And while the Stan-

ford classics depart
ment focuses less on
Egyptology than *

Greek and
Roman studies.

Manning is confident that this collection
will help emphasize the importance of the
ancient kingdom as an intersection of cul
tures and traditions.
"This is a country that matters quite a
lot," he said. "It's a part of classical history
and a part of biblical history, and all the
while Egypt was also interacting with
other major African civilizations. It will be
easier to teach this stuff now."
Manning noted that the materials are
valuable teaching tools for everything from
freshman seminars to graduate programs.
"I'm teaching a course in sum-

nier school on Papyrology, which fo
cuses on training graduate students
and junior professors in the techni
cal processes of studying materials
L from this culture." he said, "and
| we're much better off having

hese materials at our
fingertips."

The mate
rials will at
tract not just

students, but
also researchers.
According to

Iyer, the Erichsen
collection could re
veal much more

about the transition
period of Egyptian

history it covers, as well as early Christianity.
"The Erichsen library is one of the
greatest/most significant privately-owned
Egyptology libraries in the world, and
having it open for academic work is fabu
lous," Iyer said. "We already have several
amazing Egyptologists in our classics de
partment at Stanford â€” the availability
of the Erichsen library will undoubtedly
lead to some fascinating projects."
For modern scholars, Erichsen's li
brary in particular provides a unique
glimpse of the past: Erichsen's own.
"We have a perspective different from
someone in 19th century Germany,"
Manning said. "It's important to recog
nize those differences as we embark on
our scholarship in the present day."
The rare collection is already highly
sought after. Scholars across the world are
interested in the texts for the content, the
historical scholarship and what they show
about the man who held them. Erichsen's
library is also fostering connections with
schools in Copenhagen, where his papers
and notes are still kept.
"With some of the texts, you can smell
his pipe when you're reading," Manning
said. "This was a real man. and he's still
present in these books."
