## New Hospital CFO talks expansion 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Daniel Morissette. the newly appointed chief financial of
ficer (CFO) of Stanford Hospital & Clinics, ascended to his
post just in time to oversee the Hospital's $ 1 billion renovation
and expansion project.
The former top finance officer of the University of Toledo
and its medical center, Morissette replaced Ray Santorella,
who left Stanford in mid-2006 to become president and chief
operating officer at a San Francisco security company.
"We're delighted to have Dan join us, especially as we em
bark on the opportunity to build an entirely new hospital,"
said Martha Marsh, president and CEO of Stanford Hospital
& Clinics, in an Oct. 17 press release.
The expansion project Marsh describes comes on the heels
of updates to seismic safety standard laws in California. Facil
ities must comply with the regulations by 2015. Construction
for the Hospital is expected to begin by 2012, with hopes of
opening the entire Stanford Hospital & Clinics facility by the
2015 deadline.
"The urgency for the Hospital expansion is partially led by
the fact that we do need to construct or expensively retrofit
our hospital anyway," Morissette said. "Having said that, we
also did an intensive study with faculty physicians in the
School of Medicine on the size of a hospital needed to main
tain the clinical care and clinical research components we pro
vide."
In conjunction with counterparts at the University and Lu
cille Packard Children's Hospital, Morissette will oversee
much of the project's expenditures.
"It is my responsibility to make sure that we have the inter
nal financing in place to complete this project and communi
cate what we are doing to the community and the outside fi
nancial agencies involved," Morissette said.
Although the project is still in its early stages, Morissette
said it is going well.
"We have a long way to go," he said." We are going through
the permit process in conjunction with the University right
now, but we are confident that it is going to work out. It seems
like every thing is on track."
While Morissette said it was too early to speculate on spe
cific challenges the Hospital may encounter, he said the pres
ent focus is on acquiring the necessary permits.
There have already been concerns, however, from some
community members who view the expansion project as a
burden to the City of Palo Alto, citing increased traffic and
greater congestion as potential problems.
"Concerns like these still exist," Morissette said. "But we
are doing everything we can to alleviate them."
He emphasized that it was important to remain in constant
communication with the greater Palo Alto community, espe
cially those who have already voiced concern.
"We are very closely aligned with the University and we
are working together to find a solution that works for every
one," he said. "In that regard, I think the process is going well
since the Hospital leadership and the University leadership
understand our role in the community. We are taking into ac
count the concerns now so that we are better able to handle
them in the future."
Despite the fact that the Hospital is affiliated with the Uni
versity, the construction funding will come from the Hospital's
own resources.
"It is going to be a challenge for us to make sure that we
maintain our fiscal solvency and deliver the type of facility we
want," Morissette said, "but, like the rest of Stanford, we are
very aware of our desire and need to be the place of choice."
While he and others working on the project remain enthu
siastic about its outcome and impact on Stanford, Morissette
recognized that there is still a long way to go.
"This is a very large and elaborate project, [one] which re
quires a lot of planning," he said. "There is a lot of money that
needs to be expended before the shovels ever go in the
ground."
