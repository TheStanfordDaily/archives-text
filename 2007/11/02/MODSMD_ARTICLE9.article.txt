# Not in my landfill
## On-campus recycling center helps Stanford comply with CA law 
### KT MERTES 
If each of Stanford's nearly 33,000 students, faculty, and
support staff produced as much trash as the average
American, almost 75 tons of trash would he hauled off
campus every day.
That's 100 compact cars worth of ugly, smelly, generally
icky garbage.
But thanks to Stanford's waste management system, over
three-fifths of our waste begins a new life in Coke bottles
and spiral notebooks instead of languishing in the stinky
depths of landfills.
We're not just doing that because we're green: California
state law mandates that half of all waste must find a home
other than landfills. Because of the law, thinking about ba
nana peels is someone's job.

At Stanford, that's Julie Muir, Community Rela
tions Manager for Peninsula Sanitary Service Inc

(PSSI). Her job is to divert as much waste as
possible from 342-acre Newby Island

Landfill in Milpitas. Every day, garbage a
trucks collect waste from on-campus I
trash bins and make several trips to
transport it to the landfill. In hairy South
Bay traffic, the drive can take more than
an hour.
Landfilling is the simplest part of Stan
ford's waste management program, with
three easy steps: Collect garbage, com
press it.and bury it.
What, no sorting?
