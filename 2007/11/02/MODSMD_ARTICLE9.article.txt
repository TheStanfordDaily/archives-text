# Not in my landfill
## On-campus recycling center helps Stanford comply with CA law 
### KT MERTES 
If each of Stanford's nearly 33,000 students, faculty, and
support staff produced as much trash as the average
American, almost 75 tons of trash would he hauled off
campus every day.
That's 100 compact cars worth of ugly, smelly, generally
icky garbage.
But thanks to Stanford's waste management system, over
three-fifths of our waste begins a new life in Coke bottles
and spiral notebooks instead of languishing in the stinky
depths of landfills.
We're not just doing that because we're green: California
state law mandates that half of all waste must find a home
other than landfills. Because of the law, thinking about ba
nana peels is someone's job.

At Stanford, that's Julie Muir, Community Rela
tions Manager for Peninsula Sanitary Service Inc

(PSSI). Her job is to divert as much waste as
possible from 342-acre Newby Island

Landfill in Milpitas. Every day, garbage a
trucks collect waste from on-campus I
trash bins and make several trips to
transport it to the landfill. In hairy South
Bay traffic, the drive can take more than
an hour.
Landfilling is the simplest part of Stan
ford's waste management program, with
three easy steps: Collect garbage, com
press it.and bury it.
What, no sorting?

" This is really important for stu
dents to know," Muir said. When you
dump a coffee cup or plastic bottle
into a trash bin. no one picks it out
later. Though "dirty material recov
ery" facilities exist, Newby Island
isn't one of them.
It is, however, one of the few land
fills in the country that captures the
methane emitted by decomposing
trash — helping to keep a powerful
greenhouse gas out of the atmos
phere while generating energy.
Garbage-stuffed landfills are
tightly sealed to prevent leakage. In
side. solid waste slowly decomposes
and emits methane gas. If wells are
drilled into the landfill, this gas can
be extracted and used like other hy
drocarbon fuels. For example, some
of the methane captured by Newby
Island Landfill powers a scrubbing
system at the Santa Clara Water Pol
lution Control plant.
But Muir isn't sure how efficient
such systems are.
"I've heard very different num
bers — from 20 to 00 percent — on
the amount of methane actually cap
tured." Muir says. "A landfill is an
open system, and it can leak in a
bazillion million places, so it's hard
to capture it all."
Reducing the amount of trash that

goes to landfills in the first place is
simply a much better option. While
many members of the Stanford com
munity are conscientious recyclers,
Muir says there is plenty of room for
improvement.
"1 peek in dumpsters on a regular
basis and find cardboard, bottles,
cans and paper," Muir says.
If the entire Stanford community
made a larger effort to properly re
cycle, Stanford could whittle down
the amount of garbage it landfills
from 39 to around 24 percent.
Materials placed in campus recy
cling bins have a notably shorter ini
tial journey: PSSI's recycling facility
is located right on campus, south of
Stanford Stadium. I lere.the recycla
ble materials are sorted. Plastic,
metal, glass and paper are carefully
separated based on chemical com
position. Larger recycling centers
may have spiffy fiber optic or wind
based sorting equipment, but at
PSSI all sorting is done by hand.
Consider plastic containers. Why
do we need to know precisely what a
Coke bottle is made of? The first
step in recycling plastic is to melt
everything down, and all the"25,"
"7s" and "3s" must be heated at
slightly different temperatures. One
had bottle could ruin the whole

batch.
(An extra bonus of the melting
treatment? Any attached paper la
bels or food residue gets burned off,
making recycling plastics a simple
"toss 'n' go" effort for consumers.)
After processing, these recy
clables can replace some of the raw
materials obtained through environ
mentally harmful processes and re
duce the energy used to make new
products.
A classic example is the alu
minum can. To make aluminum,
overseas strip-mining operations ex
tract bauxite ore, usually negatively
effecting the environment through
erosion and habitat destruction. At a
refining plant, chemical treatment
and a high-voltage electric current
process every 100 pounds of ore into
about 25 pounds of pure aluminum.
In contrast, the recycling process
uses 95 percent less energy to pro
duce the same amount of pure prod
uct. A recycled aluminum can may
be reprocessed almost indefinitely
and will find its way back to store
shelves within three months.

PSSI sells its recycled material di
rectly to commercial vendors. Metal
merchants buy scrap for their own
stock; businesses like Hayward's
Strategic Materials will buy recycled
glass for use in fiberglass products.
According to Muir. right now the
market in recycled paper is especial
ly hot. with paper mills snapping up
reprocessed midterms and old
copies of The Daily.
"Paper mills make recipes de
pending 011 the product they're mak
ing." Muir explained. "They mix
white paper with magazines or
newsprint in a machine like a butter
ch urner."
Because paper recycling is a
water-based process, any greasy
food residue contaminates the ef
fort. So while they can recycle the
beer cans from Saturday's frat party,
they can't add the pizza box from
your 2am study break.
As of now. this injustice remains
un addressed.
