## Taylor sees Econ's role in fight against terror 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
Economist John Taylor has negoti
ated with Afghan warlords, followed
the trail of terrorist financing and
worked with Iraqis to create a post-
Saddam federal reserve system, hut
the Stanford economics professor is
best known to students as the author of
their introductory economics text
hook.
The former under secretary of the
treasury for international affairs called
for increased attention to economic is
sues in foreign policy in his keynote ad
dress to a Stanford Institute for Eco
nomic Policy Research (SIEPR)
forum on "The Economics of War,
Peace and Security" last Friday after
noon.
"We need to think more about the
financial economic issues in our for
eign policy," Taylor told about 70 stu

dents. faculty and community mem
bers at the Bechtel Conference Center
event. "Not a lot of people know about
it, so I'm glad you're here."
He highlighted the importance of
economics in international issues
ranging from reconstructing Iraq and
Afghanistan to defeating terrorism
and preventing North Korea and Iran
from realizing their nuclear ambi
tions,subjects which he also discussed
in his recent book, "Global Financial
Warriors:The Untold Story of Inter
national Finance in the Post 9/11
World."
"Economics is a lot quicker than
politics." he said.
In Iraq. Taylor acknowledged the
importance of ensuring that money
was not misspent by corrupt officials,
but he insisted that fears of corruption
had to be subordinated to spending
policies that encouraged economic
growth.

" Ihere's this tension between get
ting the money dispersed quickly and
worrying about the corruption which is
very real." he said. "I 'd say spend some
money, try to create some jobs and
worry about the details later."
Taylor reiterated the idea that lack
of economic opportunity breeds re
sentment and terrorism, and he said
that the export of an open economic
system should take its place alongside
the longstanding American doctrine of
encouraging democracy.
"1 think of this as complementing
or augmenting the strategy of spread
ing democracy," he said. "We need to
stress that we're not just spreading po
litical freedom, but economic freedom
as well."
In addition to the role of economics
in rebuilding countries,Taylor stressed
the importance of international finan
cial cooperation in tracking and de
feating terror networks.

Immediately after 9/11, "the White
1 louse instructed the Treasury to put
together a coalition to freeze the assets
of Al Qaeda financiers around the
world," he said. "Of course this re
quires a lot of cooperation because the
United States can't do it alone. You
can't freeze the assets if they can just
migrate to another country."
Because Al Qaeda assets were
frozen on Sept. 21.2(X)1, before troops
were sent into Afghanistan, Taylor
called the international action "the
first shot in the War on Terror."
Financial monitoring continues to
play a role in combating terrorism,
Taylor said, because U.S. and other se
curity agencies use protocols of the So
ciety for Worldwide Interbank Finan
cial Telecommunication (SWIFT) to
track funds transfers to terrorist
groups.
Convincing banks worldwide to
participate was an international effort.
Taylor said, and he emphasized the
care taken to avoid abuse of the infor
mation gathered.
"Any information had to be sub
poenaed and the subpoena had to be
audited," he said. " ITie idea was to
have this very formal protocol."
Taylor expressed disappointment
at The New York Times for outing the
program last summer.
"Unfortunately, last summer it got
leaked." he said,"so it's no longer as ef
fective as it was."
Taylor's talk capped a day of discus
sions on a broad range of topics in in
ternational political economy, includ
ing talks with foreign policy heavy hit
ters like international relations Prof.
Stephen Krasner. former director of
policy planning at the State Depart
ment and Stuart Levey, under secre
tary of the treasury for terrorism and
financial intelligence.
At the reception following the day
long conference.Taylor signed the fifth
and most recent edition of his text
book, "Economics."
" Hie Economics of War, Peace and
Security" was the fourth biannual
SIEPR conference.
