## Prof, explores legal role of neuroscience 
### NIKHIL JOSHI 
Defendants may soon have to face
a witness that they never imagined
would testify against them — their
own brain.
Law School Prof. 1 lank Greely '74
is part of a nationwide group of re
searchers centered at UC-Santa Bar
bara that recently received a $10 mil
lion grant from the Mac Arthur Foun
dation to study the ways in which neu
roscience can be applied to the justice
system.
Greely's research could alter the
way we think about criminal and civil
justice.
"Advances in neuroscience and
our understanding of how the brain
functions have both immediate and
long term implications for the legal
system." Law School Dean Larry
Kramer told The Daily in an email.
"As advances in neuroscience teach
us to understand this better, we can
not help but change the way law deals
with a wide variety of problems."
Neuroscience has a number of ap
plications to the law. mainly involving
lie detection and personal responsi
bility for criminal behavior, which
could raise serious ethical questions
forjudges and juries in the future.
San Diego-based startup No Lie
MRI has developed a lie detector that
employs MRI technology to detect
lies with 90 percent accuracy.The pos
sibility of foolproof lie detection
could have far-reaching effects on the
justice system, but experts are careful
not to get carried away before the
new technology has established itself
as legitimate.
"The more excited we get about
what happens if it works," Greely
warned, "the more we must remem
ber that we don't know if it does
work."
If the new technology does prove
to be reliable — and Greely puts the
odds of this happening at below 50
percent — it will raise a number of
constitutional issues, as defendants
and witnesses may be obligated to
take lie detector tests.
"A judge could conceivably issue a
warrant on someone's mind." Greely
said.
Current constitutional protections
were not written in anticipation of ad
vances in neuroscience and would not
offer much defense against the ag
gressive use of neuroscience in trials.
Greely argued that the First Amend
ment does not currently guarantee
freedom of thought, and that the Fifth
Amendment protection against self
incrimination only applies to testimo
ny. MRI tests may be put under the

same non-testimonial category as
breathalyser tests, he said.
If neurological advances occur in
the near future, Greely warned that
the Bill of Rights may not be expand
ed to address neuroscience.
"Our current Supreme Court is
not highly likely to extend rights" he
said.
The way in which courts hold peo
ple liable for their actions may change
as a result of advances in neuro
science.
"Neuroscientists believe that be
haviors are a function of brain func
tion." Greely said.
Even today, judges and juries take
neuroscience into account when pun
ishing criminals. In the 2005 case
Roper v. Simmons. the Supreme
Court ruled that the death penalty
could not he applied to minors, in part
because neurological analysis showed
that minors do not have the same ca
pacity for judgment that adults do.
If neuroscience continues to
progress, it is conceivable that neuro
scientists may one day argue that all
criminal behavior is a result of biolog
ical defects. Greely argued that even if
this day comes, we are so deeply wed
ded to the concept of free will that
such findings will not dramatically
alter the current criminal justice sys
tem.
"We will continue to believe we
have free will no matter what neuro
scientists say," Greely said. "Criminal
responsibility is not going to dry up
and blow away.
According to Greely, the concept
of preventative justice is one of the
most exciting — and frightening —
applications of neuroscience. Greely
said it is possible that in the foresee
able future we will be able to identify
patterns in MRIs that indicate psy
chopathy in children.
"Would we put these people in jail
and throw away the key because of a
scan? I don't think so," Greely said.
"But other countries might"
Today, some forms of preventive
justice are common. College-age
males are forced to pay higher car in
surance premiums than middle-aged
mothers. Repeat offenders are rou
tinely given longer prison sentences
than first-time offenders. It is not hard
to imagine a time when law enforce
ment officials could closely monitor
potential criminals based on brain
scans.
"Preventive measures," Greely
postulated."may not be as far away as
you would think."
