# Op-Ed
## Israeli occupation: Injustice in our name 
### 
I am Jewish. I state that at the beginning of
this op-ed so that when you read it,you will
not immediately discount me as anti-Se
mitic. For those of you unfamiliar with the
rhetoric of Middle Eastern affairs, this fright
ening and overtly racist phenomenon occurs
whenever human rights activists like myself
hold Israel t< > the same international standards
as we hold all other nations; non-Jews aredele
gitimized as having an innate prejudice against
Jewish people. But you don't have to worry
about that, because, as I previously stated, I am
Jewish.
In fact, I write this op-ed on behalf of the
Jewish Committee on Human Rights (J
-('()MR). formerly Jews for Justice in Palestine.
We are socially conscious Jews who have
joined Students Confronting Apartheid by Is
rael (SCAI) to create a united front of stu
dents. alumni, staff, faculty and community
members to persuade Stanford's Board of
Trustees to divest from corporations violating
international law and supporting human rights
abuses in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian
Territories.
Some of you may wonder. "Why do you
focus on Israel? Aren't there lots of human
rights abuses that deserve our attention?" It's
true, there are many human rights abuses oc
curring across the world, including violations
in our own country. All of these injustices
merit recognition, and Israel is no exception.
We single out Israel for the same reason that
others single out Darfur or Burma: because
there are atrocious human rights abuses oc
curring in a specific socio-political context.
But more importantly, we focus on Israel be
cause it is the number one recipient of US for
eign aid. most of which is in the form of mili
tary grants. As American citizens and taxpay
ers, a better question might be: "Why not
focus on Israel?"
Americans have a unique culpability for
Israeli injustices, as the U.S. supports Israel's
occupation of Palestine with more than $7
million in foreign aid per day, totaling $108
billion over the last 50 years (Source:"Wash
ington Report on Middle East Affairs,"
2(K)6). While Israel comprises one tenth of
one percent of the world's population, the
U.S. gives Israel approximately one-third of

our foreign uid budget, totaling more aid for
Israel than Africa, Latin America and the
Caribbean combined if aid to Egypt and
Colombia is extracted from the total
(Source: "Washington Report on Middle
East Affairs," 2(X)2).
Given this tremendous sum of U.S. aid
coupled with its appalling human rights
record. Israel deserves our criticism and con
sideration just as much as other nations; sub
jugation in other countries does not negate
that which occurs in Israel. As Desmond Tutu
has said, "Divestment from apartheid South
Africa was certainly no less justified because
there was repression elsewhere on the
African continent."
But what is Israel doing that is so wrong?"
you may wonder. According to B'Tselem, an
Israeli human rights organization, since Sep
tember 2000 the Israeli military has killed
4,267 Palestinians (861 of whom were chil
dren) and demolished 4.170 Palestinian
homes.The Israeli military subjects Palestini
ans to hundreds of military checkpoints with
in the Palestinian territories, effectively ob
structing their ability to access employment,
education and medical care. Israel has de
tained more than 15 percent of the total
Palestinian population in the territories since
1%7 (Source: Palestine Monitor). Israel con
fiscates Palestinian land to build Jewish-only
settlements which strategically annex agricul
tural and water resources from Palestinian
civilians.
As Shulamit Aloni.the former Israeli Min
ister of Education, stated, "...through its army,
the government of Israel practices a brutal
form of apartheid in the territory it occupies.
Its army has turned every Palestinian village
and town into a fenced-in, or blocked-in. de
tention camp."
There are people on this campus who want
you to believe that this criticism of Israel is
anti-Semitic.There are people on this campus
who want to shut down debate on these issues
by claiming that it is offensive to the Jewish
community. As rational individuals, we must
reject and surpass this empty rhetoric, de
manding serious examination of Israel's
human rights abuses and our own cul
pability in sustaining them.
Our group, J-COHR, emerges
from a rich history of solidarity in so
cial justice movements: men who

stood by women in their demand for
reproductive freedom; white people
who fought with African-Americans
against segregation; straight people
helping the queer community oppose
institutional heterosexism. We are
Jews standing with Palestinians in
their demand for education, health
care, economic opportunity and basic
human rights.

tion of Palestine, hear lianan Ashwari
speak tonight at 6:30 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium. To take action against
