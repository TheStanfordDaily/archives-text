## Finding the value in finance 
### 
Fred has two goals in life: 1. Have a fam
ily. 2. Give back. So, why did he just
sign his offer to enter that most notori
ously soulless industry — finance?
As many members of the senior class are
contemplating their future careers and role
in society. I hear a lot of debate over which
of two opposite directions to go in. Give
back or make money? Teach for America or
Goldman Sachs?
I perceive an added element of morality
in the battle. The path of poverty, selfless
ness and non-profit work is synonymous
with goodness and virtue. On the other
hand, investment banking and consulting
are often compared with Satan worship
with the hackneyed phrase "selling your
soul."
However, last time I checked, I didn't
make friends with the minions of Hell. In
fact, Fred is one of the best people I know.
He's always looking for thoughtful ways to
help me get through my arduous problem
sets with offers of food.caffeine and platon
ic massages. His religious beliefs and up
bringing instilled a deeply rooted value of
giving back. Where's the disconnect be
tween Fred's charity and his prescribed role
as a pawn of "The Man"?

The misconception that finance equates
to selling one's soul is one that 1 subscribed
to until I asked Fred to explain why he
signed his life away — I mean his offer.
I originally thought that the finance in
dustry just helped the rich get richer (and
conversely, the poor get poorer). Not exact
ly the noblest of goals. Fred reasoned with
me and explained that, yes, finance did in
crease the buying power of businesses and
helps businesses make more money. How
ever, zooming the camera out, finance can
achieve the same goals as sexier non-profit
organizations like Habitat for Humanity. Fi
nance is vital to the success of the compa
nies that improve our lives, in ways that we
perhaps take for granted. For instance, help
ing a steel company avoid bankruptcy in
creases competition, which leads to lower

steel prices. This helps keep down the con
struction costs of businesses, transportation
and homes — helping impoverished fami
lies in a slow, trickle-down way. While this
avenue of aid may not be as direct as build
ing a home for a needy family, it still helps.
Fred also chose finance because he
knows that this vocation is where he's the
most valuable. He recognizes, as I do, that he
can't be that person at the soup kitchen or
building a house. Actually, the thought of
Fred's un-calloused hands clutching a ham
mer is quite comical. But he does know that
he thrives in an environment where work
ing eighteen-hour days to crunch numbers
constitutes the norm. And when he donates
a portion of his income at the end of the
year, he is still equally giving back. Feeding
hundreds of people in Africa requires both
the people who actually cook and the peo
ple who pay for the food.
While there still might be those invest
ment bankers who live solely for their next
paycheck, every industry has employees
with less-than-laudable motives. So, as any
student about to enter any vocation, it's im
portant to consider where your motivations

and your value truly lie. Converse
ly. when hearing of others' paths,
ask them these questions before
generalizing their careers under Sa
tanic banners.
Even as Fred slaves away at the
office for hours on end for a im
pressive salary, he will still be work
ing towards his life goals. The real
tragedy is not that Fred sold his
soul; it is that he feels the need to
justify his career choice to those
who prematurely question the
moral basis of his aspirations.
