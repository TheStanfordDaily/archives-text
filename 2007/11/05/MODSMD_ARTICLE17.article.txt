# Little Ms. Modern
## Evangelizing modernism to the masses 
### 
Evcn as an unpaid grad student writing for
a school paper, I feel a sense of accounta
bility toward whatever modest reader
ship I might manage to amass. And it seems that
some were displeased with what I had to say last
week regarding computing! If you missed my
point entirely, 1 can't help you. but for the rest.
I'd like to begin a complementary discussion
about modernity and modernism in general.
I didn't take on Apple computers because of
some personal vendetta — part of my point was
to poke fun at our zealotry in computing poli
tics, especially when there are many more press
ing issues to be passionate about. Instead, my
main purpose was to encourage a more critical
outlook in considering what constitutes good
modern design. And in case you missed it. my
take is that it entails more than sleek, seductive
aesthetics. But if that's what modernism is not,
then what is modernism, exactly?
I'm glad you asked! First, let me make ex
plicit a distinction that I've been assuming all
along - that between modernization.modernity,
and modernism. Modernization began about
two hundred years ago with the Industrial Rev
olution, and has been chugging along ever since.
Modernity refers to our experience of living in
this newly industrialized, urbanized, globalized,
democratized world. Try as we might, we really
can't escape either of these realities: for better
or worse (and really, it's both), our world has
been modernized, and our lives occur in the

context of the modern condition.
Modernism, then,is how we respond to all of
this. Given new Ux)ls and freed from the old
constraints of tradition, modernists set out to
culturally and artistically express the ups and
downs of modern life. Yes, I lean more towards
the ups than the downs, hut modernists come in
many flavors, and some see the world as very
bleak indeed. Even among the most optimistic
of us, an incompatible bundle of values are pro
moted as the so-called modern ideals: individu
ality. freedom, equality, transparency, progress,
productiveness, efficiency, functionality, and so
on.
If you're like me. you think these all sound
great. But alas, we can't have them all. Hie most
efficient and functional society is not the most
free and equal. Transparency infringes on the
privacy and autonomy suggested by individual
ity. And some of these seemingly desirable
ideals entail undesirable results even on their
own: progress can lead to a sense of alienation,
for example. A key task of modernism is to ex

plore these inconsistencies and ambiguities, he
cause they are precisely what make our modern
experiences modern.
Some view these contradictions as insur
mountable. and express their despair through
pessimism, while others (myself included) opti
mistically consider them worthy challenges. But
despite our differences, the unifying point of all
brands of modernism is an insistence on con
fronting the here and now. unpleasant as it may
be.To reject modernism altogether is to silence
all expression relevant to how we live today.
Not everyone rejects modernism: I would be
remiss not to note that there are indeed hoards
of expert scholars who devote their lives to this
topic.They can be found in a generous variety of
academic departments around the globe, and I
won't feign to participate in their level of dis
course. But I ve read a tew of their books and
taken a few of their classes, and what strikes me
most is the need to deliver the message of mod
ernism to the masses.
As with all academia, it seems hopelessly
silly for brilliant intellectuals to sit around de
bating the appropriate response to the modern
condition without presenting their findings to
the public in an accessible way. I low many non
architects are really going to read "Learning
from Las Vegas' ? (Non-architects: Written by
Venturi and Brown, this fun little btx>k was

Mueller
highly influential in architectural cir
cles in the '70s and '80s. Google "deco
rated shed" for more info.)
Probably just about zero — aca
demic modernism has virtually no
presence beyond the ivory towers. But
non-architects (and apparently some
architects, as well) will slurp up the
Steve Jobs version of modernism by
the bowlful, and why wouldn't they?
There are no obvious alternatives
available in the pop culture realm. I'm
no Venturian. but I think everyone
would benefit from some decorated
shed-style counterarguments injected
into public discourse (hence my de
fense of my ugly and ordinary
Think Pad). There is a vast and complex
wealth of insight relevant to this de

bate that deserves to be extracted from
theoretical texts and applied to our
everyday experiences.
You might say that good modern
design is simplicity and minimalism,
and I might say (a la Venturi) that less
is a bore. Either way. it's important that
we have this discussion at all, and that
we acknowledge the complexities in
herent to these issues. I low does mini
malism affect freedom? I low can the
decorated shed be functional? To com
pletely ignore these questions outside
of the classroom undermines mod
ernism's main purpose: to he relevant
to our modern lives. We are missing out
on much richness if we don't practice
what we preach. And above all, mod
ernism preaches the gospel of critical
debate.

Caitliti would love to hear about how
you 've learned from Las Vegas, archi
tecturally or otherwise. Send your craz\
Vegas stories to niltiac(s\sti in ford. edu.
