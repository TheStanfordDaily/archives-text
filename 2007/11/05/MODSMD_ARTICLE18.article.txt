Although numerous letters to the edi
tor appear on the pages of The Stan
ford Daily, readers also submit com
ments through its Weh site, www.stan
forddaily.com. The following is a
sampling of reader responses to the
Oct. 30 editorial, "Email: The enemy
of action?"
"Skeptical" on Oct. 30, at 3 p.m.:
Expressing one's views loudly in a
public forum in solidarity with a crowd
of the like-minded does not increase
their truth of these views over those
expressed quietly in emails. Despite
the assertions of some, it is an incon
venient truth that group consensus
does not prove truth — ask Galileo,
who was condemned for his views by
the consensus of the Inquisition!
Not everyone wants to man the
barricades, take to the streets or
shout down dissenters for something
that happened half way across the
country to someone else. It may just
not be important enough to make it a
personal crusade or to spend an
evening venting about it. Moreover,
only a masochist wants to stand up to
a mob and express unpopular views,
particularly since the demonstrated
tendency of mobs is not to listen to

reason.
llius, free speech in the form of
emails should he welcomed! After
all. resort to the power and persua
siveness of the written word in the
face of hostility, unreason and even
physical danger has a distinguished
record in the history of civilization. It
should he celebrated, not criticized,
in a - self-proclaimed liberal (in the
classical sense) institution of higher
learning. At the least, any self-re
specting op-ed writer should value
putting opinions in writing!
"Meltdown at the Stun ford Daily?"
on Oct. 30, at 11 p.m.
The editorial team seems to be sell
destructing before us.
Today's offering is certainly one
of the more stupid and dishonest ed
itorials from Daily staff in recent
memory. Who or what is this article
arguing against?
This part is particularly bad:
"From a moral standpoint, criticisms
launched against a panel for dis
cussing Jena-6 stand out amongst the
crowds of unconstructive critical
emails as particularly odious."
The use of this straw man argu
ment is especially disappointing and

shows a clear lack of ability or will
ingness on the part of The Daily edi
tors to provide honest analysis. I
haven't heard anyone criticize the
mere act of wanting to discuss Jena 6.
Instead, it seems that critics took
issue with the implied purpose of the
event, which was titled "Modern-Day
Lynching: A Look into the Horror."
There is no question mark after the
word "lynching ". It is clear that the
event's organizers intended the pur
pose of the event (just look at the
title!) to be to reinforce the (mistak
en) notion that the Jena 6 events
should be seen as a call to arms
against supposedly rampant "institu
tional racism".
Ofcourse.it would have been per
fectly acceptable for Ilie Daily to
have attempted to make the case that
what happened in Jena was. in fact, a
modern day lynching. The Daily
would have been wrong in arguing
this, but at least they would have
been offering a legitimate argument
without mischaracterizing critics and
without lazily and dishonestly attack
ing nonexistent straw man positions.
Shame on the editorial board!
You guys no doubt know better and
can do better.
