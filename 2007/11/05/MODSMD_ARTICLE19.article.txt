## TIP-OFF TIME Men set to face Concordia tonight 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's time for Stanford basketball.
After a long offseason, Stanford
men's basketball unofficially kicks
off the 2007-2008 season tonight
with a 7 p.m. exhibition scrimmage
against Concordia University.
The Cardinal enters the year with
high expectations — ranked 21st in
the nation and picked to finish fifth
in the ikiunting Pacific 10's presea
son media poll.
ITiat's hardly unexpected praise
for a team that returns all five
starters from 2006's NCAA tourna
ment team.The frontcourt of sopho
more centers Robin and Brook
Lopez and junior forward Lawrence
Hill might be the Pac-10's best, and
junior shooting guards Kenny
Brown and Anthony Goods give the
Cardinal threats from behind the
arc.
'"We are clearly a much better
basketball team than we were last
year," said coach Trent Johnson at
the Pac-10 Media Day, "We should
be a very good defensive team and a
very good rebounding team. Consis
tency will be a huge key for us in this
league and we need to play extreme
ly well in the non-conference."
In 2006. Stanford finished 18-13
overall and 10-8 in the Pac-10, the
nation's toughest conference, which
only got stronger over the offseason.
A team with four underclassman
starters strung together remarkable
performances: a 75-68 upset of then-
No. 3 UCLA and thrilling last-sec
ond wins over Virginia, Washington
State and Washington.
But a 1-6 finish down the stretch,
capped by an embarrassing 78-58
blowout loss to Louisville in the
NCAA Tournament's first round
left the team with more questions
than answers heading into the off
season.
The time off has generated some
intriguing questions: Who's the point
guard? The Cardinal suffered from
poor ballhandling. passing and. most
of all,shooting,at the position all last
season, especially against Louisville.
The other pieces are there — Stan
ford's likely a top-10 team if junior
Mitch Johnson, last year's starter, or
junior Drew Schiller, a University of
San Francisco transfer, can raise
their level of play to that of the other

starters. While
both players
had good sum
mers, neither
dominated, so
Goods, Brown
and slashing
senior forward
Fred Washing
ton may factor
into the rota
tion.
The other
main concern
centers around
Brook Lopez's
tumultuous off
season. The pro
jected NBA lot
tery pick is the
most promising
talent on the
team, but was
suspended from
the squad for
fall quarter for
academic ineli
gibility (a 1.8
GPA and 36
completed units
are required).
Just weeks
later, the situa
tion heightened
as coach Trent
Johnson sus
pended Brook

indefinitely and placed Robin Lopez
on probation. Brook's absence
shouldn't hurt too much during the
weak out-of-conference schedule —
the team's first nine games — but
will he be eligible and ready to dom
inate come mid-December? Fur
ther. will his teammates welcome
him back into the locker room?
Those questions might not be an
swered tonight against Concordia.To
the Eagles' credit, they are No. 2 na
tionally due to the strong play of sen
ior guard Rafael Da Silva — but
that's in the NAIA, not the NCAA.
Still. Stanford has a history' of slow
starts, losing early to UC-Davis, UC-
Irvine and Montana over the last two
years. A strong performance against
the Irvine. Calif, school tonight would
set the right tone heading into Friday
night's season-opener against I har
vard.
