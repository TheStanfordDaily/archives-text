### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Called one of the "20 greatest live acts in the world" by
Rolling Stone magazine, Grammy Award-winning hip-hop
band'lTie Roots will take over Memorial Auditorium on Sat
urday. Dec. 1 as the main attraction of the annual Big Game
Concert.
The Roots are a Philadelphia-based group famous for
their heavy jazz sound and live instrumentation. The band
has gained critical acclaim since its inception in 1987. and
their live sets are frequently called the best in the hip-hop
genre.
"They're known for putting on a great live show," said
Stanford Concert Network (SCN) Director Chris Chen '08.
"They've got this nice jazzy sound, and they play their own
instruments. It's a nice mix of hip hop, rap and jazz."
"They're definitely danceable," added Roxie Dickinson
' 10, assistant director of SCN.
The band has toured extensively over the past decade,
and recently backed rapper Jay-Z for a third time.The group
has also recently performed in New York's Radio City Music
Hall with Common, Nas,Talib Kweli and Big Daddy Kane.
"The Roots are definitely a quality act." Chen said.
"They've worked with a lot of high-quality artists, and
they're very well-respected in the hip-hop community."
The band won its first Grammy Award in 1999 for Best

Performance by a Duo or Group and has been nominated
three times since.
The Big Game Concert, which is traditionally held the
weekend of Big Game, has historically featured such high
profile performers as Jason Mraz.Talib Kweli, Nappy Roots
and Vertical 1 lorizon.
Chen and Dickinson are confident that next month'scon
cert will not disappoint.
"In the past the turnout has been pretty good, but it de
pends on what act we can bring," Chen said. "I think we have
a good enough act this year that a lot more students will
come out."
"I definitely think this will be one of the better shows
we've had in my time here," Dickinson added.
ITiis year's concert, whose motto is, "Respect Your
Roots," will also feature two student hip-hop groups. Von
and Jidenna the Chief, as openers.
"Basically the entire show is going to be hip-hop," Chen
said.
The concert is slated for 9 p.m., which will allow students
to go to both Big Game and the show in MemAud.

"We want students to go to the football game," Chen said,
"but we're trying to put a little gap in between so they can get
dinner, shower and do whatever they need before coming
out to the show.
"Big Game is another amazing Stanford tradition that
students shouldn't miss," Dickinson said. "Regardless of
how we do at the game, the Big Game Concert will be a great
pick-me-up."
Tickets for the concert will be available both through
dorm pre-salesand at an SCN table in White Plaza this week.
The cost of attending the concert for students is $20. down
from last year's cost of $23. Ihe concert is open to outsiders,
who will have to pay $35 per ticket.
"We want to sell tickets primarily to students," Dickinson
said,"but we're selling them off-campus as well."
"Our goal is to get as many students as we can because we
want to keep it a Stanford event." Chen added.
The concert will begin at 9 p.m. on Dec. I;doors will open
at 8:15 p.m.
