# Card crushes Chico State in exhibition
## Women's basketball cruises, 95-44 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
made easy work of Chico State on Saturday in an
exhibition game to open the 2(X)7-08 season.
Stanford routed the Division II Wildcats, 95-44,
behind double-digit scoring from five players
and a pair of double-doubles.
Junior forward Jillian Harmon led the way for
Stanford, scoring 18 points and snagging 11 re
bounds, nine of which came on the offensive
glass. Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen, start
ing in her first appearance for the Cardinal and
playing center in place of injured sophomore
Jayne Appel. added 13 points and 10 rebounds.
Junior off-guard Cissy Pierce scored 12, and
redshirt sophomore point guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude scored 11 points in her first game back
from the ACL tear that kept her out last season.
Freshman guard Jeanette Pohlen chipped in with
16 points off the bench and nabbed four steals.
The result was never really in question, as
Pedersen found Harmon for a lay-up just three
seconds after the opening tip-off and the Cardi
nal raced to a 10-0 lead before Chico State's
Amanda Monteith drained a three-pointer 6
minutes,33 seconds in. Over the remainder of the
half, Stanford continued to clamp down on de
fense. holding Chico State to five field goals on 27
shots. The Cardinal went into the locker room
ahead 48-15.
Stanford followed up its 48 first-half points
with 47 in the second, while continuing to hold
the Wildcats down. Chico State finished the
game on 29.1 percent shooting.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins scored four
points in 12 minutes of play.
It is difficult to draw any conclusions about
the highly touted Stanford squad — picked to
win the Pacific 10 conference — after such an
easy win. although the three-point and foul
shooting were both troubling. Gold-Onwude hit
one triple in each half, but the rest of the Cardi
nal were a combined 0-9 from long range. Stan
ford also managed to sink only 11 of its 19 free
throws, a 57.9 percent rate.
The Cardinal will play its first official game of
the season on Friday at Yale before traveling to
New Jersey to take on No. 3 Rutgers in the Scar
let Knights' season opener.
