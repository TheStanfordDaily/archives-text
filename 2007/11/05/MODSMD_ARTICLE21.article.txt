Ihe No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team closed out its home
regular season schedule with a pair of wins this weekend, crush
ing Washington 4-0 on Friday before coming from behind to
beat Washington State 2-1 in overtime yesterday afternoon.
Sophomore forward KelleyOTlara scored a pair of goals, in
cluding the game-winner, against the Huskies (5-11-1.2-4-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference), while redshirt senior midfielder Shari
Summers celebrated her Senior Day with the overtime winner
against Washington State (10-4-3. 3-3-1 Pac-10), pushing the
Cardinal (13-2-3,4-1-2 Pac-10) up to second place in the confer
ence, behind only No. 1 UCLA.
Stanford started the weekend in top gear, needing only 25
minutes to run out to a four-goal lead over Washington. O'Hara
led the charge with her two early efforts.
First,she volleyed home a loose ball from the side of the box
after a Stanford corner kick just over four minutes into the
game.
Just two-and-a-half minutes later. O'Hara chased the ball
down the left wing and scored the goal of the season. After
pulling up about five yards out from the end-line at the side of
the IS-yard box. O'Hara bent a gorgeous, curling shot over
Washington goalkeeper Taylor Carr in off the back post to dou
ble the Stanford lead.
Sophomore midfielder Kristin Stannard and junior defend
er Allison Falk finished off the attack on Washington's goal.
Stannard strode through midlield unharried about 14 minutes
in and rifled a 20-yard shot into the top left-hand corner to make
it a 3-0 game. Falk followed up with a powerful header off a cor
ner kick with 20 minutes remaining in the first half.
'Ihe Sunday game against Washington State proved to be a
much closer affair. Stanford had a lot of trouble finding any con
tinuity at the start of the match, constantly giving up the ball in
the midfield and rarely stringing even three passes together.
After 15 minutes of play, the sloppiness was reflected on the
scoreboard too, as Stanford went behind at home for only the
second time all year.
Cougar sophomore forward Kiersten Dallstream ran
through the heart of the Stanford defense, latched onto a
through ball, and lifted a shot over Cardinal senior goalkeeper
Erica I lolland. who had charged out of her goal to cut down the
angle.
Stanford still took a few minutes to get going after falling be
hind. but ten minutes before halftime freshman forward Chris
ten Press leveled the score with a strike that just barely crossed
the line.
Press intercepted a pass along the
WSU back line and ran the ball to the
top of the Cougars' box. After briefly
losing possession, she recovered the
ball, spun past the two defenders mark
ing her. and ripped a dipping shot off
the underside of the crossbar. The ball
just crossed the line before backspin
took it back onto the field of play, and
the referee had to defer to his linesman
to make the goal call.
It was the second time in two weeks
that Stanford was the beneficiary of a
close call on the goal line. At Arizona
last week.OHara took a free kick that
was judged by the referee's assistant to
have just barely crossed the line.
The Cardinal played much better in

the second half, generating a few quali
ty scoring opportunities — sophomore
Ali Riley hit O'l laraon two deep cross
es from the right side, but O'l lara sent
both headers wide — and holding
Washington State to just two shots. Still,
the game went to overtime after a
scoreless half.
Six minutes into the first extra peri
od, the two longest-tenured members
of the Cardinal stepped up to win the
game. Redshirt senior defender Rachel
Buehler crashed a header against the
right post from a Press corner kick, and
Summers was there to turn the ball in
the net for Stanford's third overtime
victory of the year.
The Cardinal has two more games
of Pac-10 play, at Oregon and Oregon
State this weekend, before the NCAA
playoffs start in the middle of the
month.
