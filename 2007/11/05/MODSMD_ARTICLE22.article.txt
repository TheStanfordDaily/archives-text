## Marquee matchup with No. 4 Washington set for this Thursday 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team fi
nally broke its streak of second-game breakdowns
on Friday night, overpowering Oregon State from
start to finish to earn the sweep. The Cardinal held
the Beavers to 20 points or less in each of the three
games in the team's last action before next week's
battle with No. 4 Washington.
Stanford (22-2, 11-2) had lost the second game
in each of its three previous matches, two wins and
a loss, but did not lose any momentum on Friday.
After beating the Beavers (10-15,3-10) 30-18 in the
first, the Cardinal rolled to victory with a 30-1 ( ) win
in the second and a 30-20 tally in the final frame.
"I thought there was a point in the middle of the
Oregon match on Thursday when we weren't play
ing very well." coach John Dunning said."But then
we raised our level of play, and I thought in the last
two games of that match we played very well, and
also against Oregon State. We had a very good span
of five games, which I think is a good sign for us."
The entire Stanford offense ran smoothly
against the Beavers and senior setter Bryn Kehoe
dished out 30 assists as her team hit nearly .500 in
the match. Six hitters hit at a .400 clip or better, and
four made no hitting errors. Freshman outside hit
ter Alix Klineman led the way with 15 kills, hitting

.458, and senior middle blocker Franci Girard had
11 at a .526 clip.
After junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo got a kill to start the match for the Cardinal,
Klineman scored the next three points in a row, reg
istering a pair of kills and a solo block. She also
notched an ace as the Cardinal jumped ahead 8-2.
Stanford led by double digits for the first time at 23-
13 after a Klineman kill, and the Beavers would
come no closer. An Oregon State error ended the
game at 30-18.
The Beavers came out stronger in the next
frame, staying with the Cardinal until 10-10. but
Stanford left its second-game woes behind and
quickly built a lead. After a tie at 20-16, the Cardi
nal finished the game on a 10-3 run — featuring
three aces in five points by freshman defensive spe
cialist Cassidy Lichtman — to win 30-19.
"What we had been doing recently is starting
very quickly against everybody we have played,"
Dunning said of the second-game losing streak.
"We get out in front and win and then, maybe with
out realizing it. we ease up. We just needed to de
cide not to do that. Going into this week [at Wash
ington] and this time of year, we need to compete
the whole time and I thought we did that this week
end."
Out of the halftime break. Oregon State again
kept pace with Stanford, but began to fall back at
the midway point, as Stanford led 15-11 .The Cardi
nal again closed the match with a long run, this time
outscoring the Beavers 10-4 down the stretch, seal-
