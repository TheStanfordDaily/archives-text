# Cardinal dominates Beavers, 3-0
## Marquee matchup with No. 4 Washington set for this Thursday 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team fi
nally broke its streak of second-game breakdowns
on Friday night, overpowering Oregon State from
start to finish to earn the sweep. The Cardinal held
the Beavers to 20 points or less in each of the three
games in the team's last action before next week's
battle with No. 4 Washington.
Stanford (22-2, 11-2) had lost the second game
in each of its three previous matches, two wins and
a loss, but did not lose any momentum on Friday.
After beating the Beavers (10-15,3-10) 30-18 in the
first, the Cardinal rolled to victory with a 30-1 ( ) win
in the second and a 30-20 tally in the final frame.
"I thought there was a point in the middle of the
Oregon match on Thursday when we weren't play
ing very well." coach John Dunning said."But then
we raised our level of play, and I thought in the last
two games of that match we played very well, and
also against Oregon State. We had a very good span
of five games, which I think is a good sign for us."
The entire Stanford offense ran smoothly
against the Beavers and senior setter Bryn Kehoe
dished out 30 assists as her team hit nearly .500 in
the match. Six hitters hit at a .400 clip or better, and
four made no hitting errors. Freshman outside hit
ter Alix Klineman led the way with 15 kills, hitting

.458, and senior middle blocker Franci Girard had
11 at a .526 clip.
After junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo got a kill to start the match for the Cardinal,
Klineman scored the next three points in a row, reg
istering a pair of kills and a solo block. She also
notched an ace as the Cardinal jumped ahead 8-2.
Stanford led by double digits for the first time at 23-
13 after a Klineman kill, and the Beavers would
come no closer. An Oregon State error ended the
game at 30-18.
The Beavers came out stronger in the next
frame, staying with the Cardinal until 10-10. but
Stanford left its second-game woes behind and
quickly built a lead. After a tie at 20-16, the Cardi
nal finished the game on a 10-3 run — featuring
three aces in five points by freshman defensive spe
cialist Cassidy Lichtman — to win 30-19.
"What we had been doing recently is starting
very quickly against everybody we have played,"
Dunning said of the second-game losing streak.
"We get out in front and win and then, maybe with
out realizing it. we ease up. We just needed to de
cide not to do that. Going into this week [at Wash
ington] and this time of year, we need to compete
the whole time and I thought we did that this week
end."
Out of the halftime break. Oregon State again
kept pace with Stanford, but began to fall back at
the midway point, as Stanford led 15-11 .The Cardi
nal again closed the match with a long run, this time
outscoring the Beavers 10-4 down the stretch, seal-

ing the win with a solo block by jun
ior outside hitter Cynthia Barboza.
Behind Klineman and Girard's
double-digit kill totals, Barboza had
eight, and sophomore middle block
er Janet Okogbaa swatted six, com
mitting no errors on the night. Every
active player on the roster saw court
time, and four more attackers
notched at least two kills, including
redshirt sophomore Alex Fisher who
had missed nearly a month of play
after injuring her wrist earlier this
season.
Klineman led the team on defense
as well as offense, with 10 digs and
three blocks. Freshman defensive
specialist Cassidy Lichtman served a
career-high three aces to pace the

team from the service line.
Stanford is currently one game be
hind Washington in the conference
standings, having lost to the 1 luskies
at home earlier this year and then to
No. 6 USC on the road last week.
Washington has lost only to No. 8 Cal
and next week's match will likely de
termine the Pac-10 champion.
"1 really liked the effort that we
had this last week and the focus,
working on basic skills — blocking
and defense and covering our hitters
— and also working on different sit
uations," Dunning said. "We have
done good work on details and 1
think that has helped us. 1 believe we
are going upward now. For a while we
were flat, not playing poorly, but not
getting better. For the last week and a
half, I think we have been moving
forward "
