### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
After a streak of three double-over
time ties with SoCal competitor UCLA.
Stanford men's soccer finally ended its
stagnation with a 2-1 win over the Bruins
00 Friday.Hie ( animal (6-5-5,3-2-2 Pacif
ic- 10) also went on to upset San Diego
State University in a 3-0 decision on Sun
day. In doing so. Stanford extended both
teams' losing streaks to two games.
Coach Bret Simon said that the home
field advantage played a huge part in the
success.
"We were playing on a great field that
allows us to really play the game: pass,
dribble and really create attacks out of

that," Simon said. "Of course, the fans and
everything else about being at home is also
helpful. The league is so competitive that
the little things really make [a] difference,
and being at home is really helpful.
The Cardinal offense jump-started the
meeting with the Bruins (8-8-2,4-4-1 Pac
-10), registering three shots (two on goal) in
the opening nine minutes. Early attempts
by redshirt senior Kyle Hency and sopho
more Thiago Sa Freire were stopped by
sophomore UCLA goalie Brian Perk.
Sophomore Stanford keeper John Mcx>re
returned the favor during the 23rd minute,
notching his first of two saves on a break
away shot by sophomore Bruin David
Estrada.
Freshman Bobbv Warshaw scored for

the Cardinal on his third shot of the match
at 42 minutes, 44 seconds. Warshaw. who
has scored five times this season,controlled
a deflection in the Bruins' box and success
fully placed it in the left side of the goal.
At the break, Stanford maintained a 1-
0 lead, dominating offensive play with six
shots to UCLA's two.
The momentum stayed with the Cardi
nal early in the second period. Just after Sa
Freire missed his second shot wide at
47:32, he popped a pass to Hency, who
lobbed it over Perk to score. Stanford en
joyed a 2-0 advantage until junior Bruin
forward Maxwell Griffin halved the Car
dinal's lead with his eighth goal of the sea
son. Griffin stole a pass from Stanford de
fenders before launching it to the far post

to get by Moore.
Simon was concerned that the loose de
fense might lead to other mistakes.
"I thought we started off quickly
against UCLA and created some good
chances," Simon said. "What I was a little
fearful of was that we began to play very
open, in particular when we were ahead by
a couple of goals. We still kept attacking [to
the point that] we left ourselves vulnerable
sometimes and ended up letting up some
good opportunities.
However, none of UCLA's four re
maining shots were successful, and the
contest ended with the Cardinal outshoot
ingthe Bruins 13-7.
