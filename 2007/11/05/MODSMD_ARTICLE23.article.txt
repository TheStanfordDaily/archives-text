## 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
After a streak of three double-over
time ties with SoCal competitor UCLA.
Stanford men's soccer finally ended its
stagnation with a 2-1 win over the Bruins
00 Friday.Hie ( animal (6-5-5,3-2-2 Pacif
ic- 10) also went on to upset San Diego
State University in a 3-0 decision on Sun
day. In doing so. Stanford extended both
teams' losing streaks to two games.
Coach Bret Simon said that the home
field advantage played a huge part in the
success.
"We were playing on a great field that
allows us to really play the game: pass,
dribble and really create attacks out of

that," Simon said. "Of course, the fans and
everything else about being at home is also
helpful. The league is so competitive that
the little things really make [a] difference,
and being at home is really helpful.
The Cardinal offense jump-started the
meeting with the Bruins (8-8-2,4-4-1 Pac
-10), registering three shots (two on goal) in
the opening nine minutes. Early attempts
by redshirt senior Kyle Hency and sopho
more Thiago Sa Freire were stopped by
sophomore UCLA goalie Brian Perk.
Sophomore Stanford keeper John Mcx>re
returned the favor during the 23rd minute,
notching his first of two saves on a break
away shot by sophomore Bruin David
Estrada.
Freshman Bobbv Warshaw scored for

the Cardinal on his third shot of the match
at 42 minutes, 44 seconds. Warshaw. who
has scored five times this season,controlled
a deflection in the Bruins' box and success
fully placed it in the left side of the goal.
At the break, Stanford maintained a 1-
0 lead, dominating offensive play with six
shots to UCLA's two.
The momentum stayed with the Cardi
nal early in the second period. Just after Sa
Freire missed his second shot wide at
47:32, he popped a pass to Hency, who
lobbed it over Perk to score. Stanford en
joyed a 2-0 advantage until junior Bruin
forward Maxwell Griffin halved the Car
dinal's lead with his eighth goal of the sea
son. Griffin stole a pass from Stanford de
fenders before launching it to the far post

to get by Moore.
Simon was concerned that the loose de
fense might lead to other mistakes.
"I thought we started off quickly
against UCLA and created some good
chances," Simon said. "What I was a little
fearful of was that we began to play very
open, in particular when we were ahead by
a couple of goals. We still kept attacking [to
the point that] we left ourselves vulnerable
sometimes and ended up letting up some
good opportunities.
However, none of UCLA's four re
maining shots were successful, and the
contest ended with the Cardinal outshoot
ingthe Bruins 13-7.
On Sunday, Stanford kept rolling
with 14 shots (nine on goal) against
the Aztecs (8-6-2,4-4-0 Pac-10). War
shaw alone had two shots on goal in
the first ten minutes, hut both were
saved by junior SDSU keeper Jorge
Rosales.
The early offensive edge proved
important, though, when senior Scott
Bolkan's header was struck by Hency
into the far right corner of the net in

the 13th minute. Less than ten min
utes later, sophomore Michael Strick
land added to the lead when a shot oft
a deflection resulted in his first goal of
the season.
More importantly, Stanford's com
fortable 2-0 lead didn't slip after the
half.
'i thought (against SDSU| we did
a much better job of sealing off the
game," Simon said, complimenting
the team effort.
Senior Dan Shapiro. Warshaw and
Hency each fired shots within a
minute and a half before Hency
scored again at 59:54. Junior Michael
Alexander got the assist, flicking a

pass to I lency over Rosales' head.
Simon was especially complimen
tary of Hency's back-to-back scores.
"Hency obviously had a great
weekend, [and he'll] likely be the con
ference player of the week, so he was
tremendous," Simon said. "A lot of
people don't know that he's been in
jured for [almost] his entire career, so
the past three weeks have maybe been
the first consecutive weeks that he's
been healthy and able to practice with
us. so to have him fully healthy and
playing well was great. I think the
group as a whole really played well,
but I think he as a fifth-year senior has
really stepped up and really been key."
After Hency's showcase, the Card
and SDSU each attempted three
more shots before the close of the half,
but as none were successful. Stanford
claimed its second consecutive win.
Now. the team is focused on the last
games of the season.
"1 think we've known for the last
five or six games that we have to have
a strong conference season to be able
to get into the NCAA tournament,"
Simon commented. "This has been a
great couple of games, but we have
three games left, and likely we have to
win [at least] two of the three to put
ourselves into the tournament. We've
put ourselves in a good position, but
still we have a lot of work to do."
The Cardinal's next match will be
on the road against Oregon State, Fri
day at 7:30 p.m.
