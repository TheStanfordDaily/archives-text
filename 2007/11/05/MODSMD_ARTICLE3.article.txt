## From IHUM to "I do" 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While some of her classmates were at
tending the summer weddings of older
friends and relatives, Chris Cordova '09
was picking out a wedding dress for her
own walk down the aisle.
Cordova, who married Ilder Andres Betancourt
'06 in Los Angeles in August, said she never envi
sioned getting married in college.
"We were actually talking recently about how
about a year ago we'd never thought we'd be getting
married." she said. "We weren't together a year ago,
either."
Many Stanford students complain that there isn't
any dating at Stanford or they are too busy to date;
for them, marriage isn't even in the picture yet.
"Committing myself to marriage this early on
would limit the experiences I could potentially have
in college," said Garrett Dobbs "11.
For a handful of undergraduates, though, married
life has become a reality.
"We met almost exactly a year ago through a mu
tual friend at the Law School," said John Woolley
08, who is married to Ashley Isaacson Woolley J.D.
'09. "We were actually on a double date — who says
there's no dating at Stanford?"
Some had been dating since before their arrival
at Farm. Katrina Benjamin '09 married her high
school sweetheart. Mike Benjamin, this past sum
mer. Before she arrived at Stanford, Benjamin had
already talked with Mike about the possibility of
getting married.
"We had talked about the idea before freshman
year and decided that we wanted to get married. It
was more of a question of when we should get mar
ried." she said. "There were a lot of arguments put
forward for getting married after [college) gradua
tion. Yet for us, those arguments were irrelevant —
we felt that it was more important for us to be to
gether instead of waiting."
Woolley agreed that for him, it didn't make sense
to hold off.
"I think the thought of being here together,
but living apart, didn't seem appealing to us," he
said. "We knew we wanted to be married so we
figured, why wait?"
Most married nndergraduates found that
their friends were supportive of their decision.
In fact, according to Cordova and Benjamin,
their friends were actually expecting the news.
Dean of Religious l ife Scotty Mcl.ellan said
that while not many undergraduates come to
talk to him about marriage, lie tries to help those
who do with their problems when they do come.

"It's often a contemplation of mar
riage if that's somewhere in the pic
ture. but actual marriage is fairly
rare." he said.
According to Mary Gallagher,
the Memorial Church wedding co
ordinator. undergraduate marriages
comprise less than 10 percent of wed
dings at Memorial ( hurch.
Mcl.ellan pointed out that before
committing, undergraduates should ask
themselves whether they are actually in
love and want to spend the rest of their
lives with their partner.

llicy re going to he thinking about
the similarities between them," he said. "Are
their differences complementary differences?
Do they have a real friendship? Is this just a ro
mantic relationship or is this something that can
grow for a life time with one's best friend?
llicre are realistic issues about families and so
on. but you just start with the deep committed,
'I want to spend the rest of my life [with this per
son].'"
Students commented on how marriage af
fected their lives in important ways, particularly
by living in I scondido Village (I V). HV pro
vides housing for couples, as long as one person
is a registered Stanford student.
"Since I am living in I iscondido Village with

my husband, the biggest difference that I find is
not living in a dorm community. But apart from
that, the classes,et cetera,are still the same."said
Benjamin. "There are a good amount of events
in our building, so there are over 64 couples we
get to meet. However, the undergraduate com
munity for couples living in Hscondido Village is
not very present. I feel like I'm some kind of hy
brid between an undergrad and a grad student,
since I'm invited to most events."
Woolley agreed that the biggest difference
was livine in EV.

"It's fun though, because it feels more like a
home than a room in a dorm or a house," he said.
McLellan added that getting married might
affect some undergraduates' social lives.
"Undergraduates [who are married] are
looked at as sort of strange," he said "Within
their cohort of friends, they're out of sync with
what people are generally doing. On the other
hand, people can adjust to that fairly quickly."
Woolley admitted that his social group shift
ed slightly after getting married.
"1 still hangout with my same friends, but not
as much as I used to," he said. "A lot of times I
would rather just spend time with my wife at
home."

"I am less likely to party now than I was be
fore I was married." Benjamin added, "even
though I didn't really party that much before
anyway"
Students did not seem to have a problem with
administration, though Benjamin said the
thorniest administrative issues she has faced
were with the financial aid department.
"When you are married, the government usu
ally offers support for married couples," she
said. "However, at Stanford, the school assumes
that parents are going to pay. When that is not

the case, it can be difficult."
Despite these issues, married students ap
peared happy with their decisions and did not
feci limited by their spouses.
"Life feels much more stable now," Woolley
said. "It's good to have someone as a teammate
who can help me out, and whom I can help out in
whatever way we need."
"I'm just not going to have to worry about a
roommate anymore," Cordova said. "I'll live
with my husband, who I really want to live with
anyway."

Dean of Religious l ife Scotty Mcl.ellan said
that while not many undergraduates come to
talk to him about marriage, lie tries to help those
who do with their problems when they do come.

"It's often a contemplation of mar
riage if that's somewhere in the pic
ture. but actual marriage is fairly
rare." he said.
According to Mary Gallagher,
the Memorial Church wedding co
ordinator. undergraduate marriages
comprise less than 10 percent of wed
dings at Memorial ( hurch.
Mcl.ellan pointed out that before
committing, undergraduates should ask
themselves whether they are actually in
love and want to spend the rest of their
lives with their partner.

llicy re going to he thinking about
the similarities between them," he said. "Are
their differences complementary differences?
Do they have a real friendship? Is this just a ro
mantic relationship or is this something that can
grow for a life time with one's best friend?
llicre are realistic issues about families and so
on. but you just start with the deep committed,
'I want to spend the rest of my life [with this per
son].'"
Students commented on how marriage af
fected their lives in important ways, particularly
by living in I scondido Village (I V). HV pro
vides housing for couples, as long as one person
is a registered Stanford student.
"Since I am living in I iscondido Village with

my husband, the biggest difference that I find is
not living in a dorm community. But apart from
that, the classes,et cetera,are still the same."said
Benjamin. "There are a good amount of events
in our building, so there are over 64 couples we
get to meet. However, the undergraduate com
munity for couples living in Hscondido Village is
not very present. I feel like I'm some kind of hy
brid between an undergrad and a grad student,
since I'm invited to most events."
Woolley agreed that the biggest difference
was livine in EV.

"It's fun though, because it feels more like a
home than a room in a dorm or a house," he said.
McLellan added that getting married might
affect some undergraduates' social lives.
"Undergraduates [who are married] are
looked at as sort of strange," he said "Within
their cohort of friends, they're out of sync with
what people are generally doing. On the other
hand, people can adjust to that fairly quickly."
Woolley admitted that his social group shift
ed slightly after getting married.
"1 still hangout with my same friends, but not
as much as I used to," he said. "A lot of times I
would rather just spend time with my wife at
home."

"I am less likely to party now than I was be
fore I was married." Benjamin added, "even
though I didn't really party that much before
anyway"
Students did not seem to have a problem with
administration, though Benjamin said the
thorniest administrative issues she has faced
were with the financial aid department.
"When you are married, the government usu
ally offers support for married couples," she
said. "However, at Stanford, the school assumes
that parents are going to pay. When that is not

the case, it can be difficult."
Despite these issues, married students ap
peared happy with their decisions and did not
feci limited by their spouses.
"Life feels much more stable now," Woolley
said. "It's good to have someone as a teammate
who can help me out, and whom I can help out in
whatever way we need."
"I'm just not going to have to worry about a
roommate anymore," Cordova said. "I'll live
with my husband, who I really want to live with
anyway."
