## From IHUM to "I do" 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While some of her classmates were at
tending the summer weddings of older
friends and relatives, Chris Cordova '09
was picking out a wedding dress for her
own walk down the aisle.
Cordova, who married Ilder Andres Betancourt
'06 in Los Angeles in August, said she never envi
sioned getting married in college.
"We were actually talking recently about how
about a year ago we'd never thought we'd be getting
married." she said. "We weren't together a year ago,
either."
Many Stanford students complain that there isn't
any dating at Stanford or they are too busy to date;
for them, marriage isn't even in the picture yet.
"Committing myself to marriage this early on
would limit the experiences I could potentially have
in college," said Garrett Dobbs "11.
For a handful of undergraduates, though, married
life has become a reality.
"We met almost exactly a year ago through a mu
tual friend at the Law School," said John Woolley
08, who is married to Ashley Isaacson Woolley J.D.
'09. "We were actually on a double date — who says
there's no dating at Stanford?"
Some had been dating since before their arrival
at Farm. Katrina Benjamin '09 married her high
school sweetheart. Mike Benjamin, this past sum
mer. Before she arrived at Stanford, Benjamin had
already talked with Mike about the possibility of
getting married.
"We had talked about the idea before freshman
year and decided that we wanted to get married. It
was more of a question of when we should get mar
ried." she said. "There were a lot of arguments put
forward for getting married after [college) gradua
tion. Yet for us, those arguments were irrelevant —
we felt that it was more important for us to be to
gether instead of waiting."
Woolley agreed that for him, it didn't make sense
to hold off.
