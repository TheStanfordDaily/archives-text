# STUDENT GROUPS
## Education fundraiser reaches out 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hundreds of people crowded into
Tresidder's Oak Room on Saturday for
a benefit concert hosted by Asha Stan
ford, a student group dedicated to im
proving education in India. The con
cert, which consisted of rock, classical
Indian and fusion music by Indian
groups from around the area, marked
Asha's attempt to branch out into un
dergraduate life after years as a group
mostly populated by international
graduate students.
I"he concert featured performances
from Stanford's Raagapella, a South

Asian a capella group, as well as dance
and musical performances by neigh
boring troupes.
"We feel that by donating our per
formance to this fundraiser we're sup
porting a good cause," said Raagapella
member Hirav Gandhi'lo.
Koussalya Balasubramian, a second
year master's student in electrical engi
neering and Asha Stanford's calendar
officer, was excited by the turnout.
"It's just great," Balasubramian
said. "We have been putting a lot of ef
fort into this on very short notice. But
people are cheering and they're having
a great time."
The event also included many par

ticipants from outside the student com
munity, including Aniol Phadke, 30,
who came because he had heard of the
cause.
"They do really good work," he said.
"And 1 really liked it.the bands were
great."
Asha Stanford, which is part of Asha
for Education, a broader organization
including more than 66 chapters in the
United States, Europe, India, Singa
pore and Australia, will invest the pro
ceeds from this concert into Indian
non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) that seek to improve literacy
in India.
Until this event. Asha Stanford's
primary fundraising tool was a
spring gathering to celebrate Holi,
the Indian "Festival of Colors," that
is traditionally celebrated by throw
ing colored water and paint on other
participants. Asha's Holi event usu
ally draws 2.0(H) to 3,000 people from
around the Peninsula and East Bay
and its entrance fees account for
most of the $30.(XM) that the group
donates each year.
Rowza Tur Rumma '10, Asha
Stanford's publicity coordinator, ex
plained that this year, however, the
group decided to hold a fall concert
in order to reach out to undergradu
ate community members.
"The basic problem we have is
that so far Asha has been mostly
grad-run. I'm in fact the onlv under

graduate member," she said. "And
we haven't had much ability to con
nect with campus. We're looking to
broaden the scope of participation
and reach out to both Indians and
non-Indians."
Asha for Education was founded
in 1991 by two UC-Berkeley gradu
ate students, and the Asha Stanford
chapter was started the following
year. I"he group mostly focuses on
literacy programs among the under
privileged within India, especially
women and tribal peoples.
Rumma explained why the mem
bers of her group were so dedicated
to this cause.
"We are all at Stanford," she said.
"All of us have worked hard all our
lives because we know the impor
tance of education. We believe that
literacy can create socioeconomic
change. It can be one of the strongest
tools in progressing a developing na
tion."
