# UW RUNS PAST CARD
## Stanford stifled in 27-9 loss to Huskies 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a game Stanford Football had to
win to keep alive any realistic hopes of
howl eligibility, the Cardinal was run
over by Washington on Saturday, ill
lowing the Huskies a season-high 388
yards on the ground in a 27- 1 ) rout. II W
snapped a six-game losing streak with
the victory, improving to 3-6 on the sea
son and 1-5 in the Pac-10.
It was a signature day for senior
Huskies running back Louis Rankin,
who finished with 255 yards and a
touchdown on 36 carries as one half of
the two-headed backfield monster
that dominated the Cardinal (3-6,2-5).
Washington's other star behind
center — redshirt freshman quarter
back Jake Locker — terrorized the
Cardinal all afternoon with play-ac
tion fakes and quarterback keepers,
rushing for l ) 7 yards and two touch
downs on 16 carries. He also com
pleted 50 percent of his passes for

151 yards.
The Husky attack slowly ground
down the Cardinal defense, dominat
ing the time of possession. Washington
held the ball for 38 minutes,3oseconds,
compared to Stanford's mark of 21:30.
Making matters worse for Stanford
was a shoulder injury sustained by
starting sophomore quarterback Tavi
ta Pritchard toward the end of the first
quarter, pressing senior T.C. Ostrander
into action for the remainder of the
game.
Coach Jim I larbaugh, who termed
the injury a "mild AC sprain," ex
plained that — although halftime X
rayscame back negative — he was not
comfortable enough with Pritchard's
warm-up throws on the sidelines to in
sert him back into the game.
"We chose to stay with T.C." I lar
baugh said."l could've putTavita back
in. it just felt like, watching him throw
on the sideline, he didn't have it. [He]
didn't have the same pop on his ball."
The switch seemed to adversely af
fect the Cardinal's protection scheme,
as Ostrander was sacked six times in
three quarters of play.
While the passing game struggled,
the Cardinal rushing attack was fairly
productive, despite a severely injury
depleted backfield.

In a game Stanford Football had to
win to keep alive any realistic hopes of
howl eligibility, the Cardinal was run
over by Washington on Saturday, ill
lowing the Huskies a season-high 388
yards on the ground in a 27- 1 ) rout. II W
snapped a six-game losing streak with
the victory, improving to 3-6 on the sea
son and 1-5 in the Pac-10.
It was a signature day for senior
Huskies running back Louis Rankin,
who finished with 255 yards and a
touchdown on 36 carries as one half of
the two-headed backfield monster
that dominated the Cardinal (3-6,2-5).
Washington's other star behind
center — redshirt freshman quarter
back Jake Locker — terrorized the
Cardinal all afternoon with play-ac
tion fakes and quarterback keepers,
rushing for l ) 7 yards and two touch
downs on 16 carries. He also com
pleted 50 percent of his passes for

151 yards.
The Husky attack slowly ground
down the Cardinal defense, dominat
ing the time of possession. Washington
held the ball for 38 minutes,3oseconds,
compared to Stanford's mark of 21:30.
Making matters worse for Stanford
was a shoulder injury sustained by
starting sophomore quarterback Tavi
ta Pritchard toward the end of the first
quarter, pressing senior T.C. Ostrander
into action for the remainder of the
game.
Coach Jim I larbaugh, who termed
the injury a "mild AC sprain," ex
plained that — although halftime X
rayscame back negative — he was not
comfortable enough with Pritchard's
warm-up throws on the sidelines to in
sert him back into the game.
"We chose to stay with T.C." I lar
baugh said."l could've putTavita back
in. it just felt like, watching him throw
on the sideline, he didn't have it. [He]
didn't have the same pop on his ball."
The switch seemed to adversely af
fect the Cardinal's protection scheme,
as Ostrander was sacked six times in
three quarters of play.
While the passing game struggled,
the Cardinal rushing attack was fairly
productive, despite a severely injury
depleted backfield.
