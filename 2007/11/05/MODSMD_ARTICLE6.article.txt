## Plan of action ready if fires strike Farm Officials outline flexible system for dealing with emergencies 
### KAMIL DADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bay Area is no stranger to wildfires like
those that devastated Southern California last
month. Fires in the hills near UC-Berkeley in 1991
destroyed approximately 3,500 structures, killed 25
people and caused an estimated $1.5 billion in dam
age. This summer, blazes near the Dish demonstrat
ed that Stanford, too, could be affected by fire. And
while the University did not experience any serious
damage, the summer's fires, in conjunction with
those that burned recently in Southern California,
have caused some to question the I 'diversity's plans
in case of a campus-wide emergency.
According to campus biologist Alan Launder,
Stanford narrowly escaped damage during the sum
mer's blazes.
"1 lad the winds been blowing in a different direc
tion during late June's fire," Launder said, "there
was real potential for some structures being de
stroyed."
Launder added that faculty houses at the fringes
of campus are most at risk from wildfires because
they are adjacent to the foothills where fires start.
"If a fire got going in the faculty houses, and if
conditions were right: hot, dry, lots of wind," he said,
"then it could spread further into campus."
Ihe University has a detailed emergency re
sponse system in place to deal with fires and other
natural disasters. Stanford's response model is based
on the Incident Command System (ICS),a proce
dure used by the U.S. government to respond to
major emergencies.
Top Stanford emergency management officials
including Director of the Department of Public
Safety (DPS) Laura Wilson, Associate Vice Provost
for Environmental Health and Safety (EM&S)
Larry Gibbs. Emergency Management Program
Manager Keith Perry and Associate Vice Provost
for Facilities Operations C 'hris Christofferson all re
sponded to The Daily in a joint email when asked
about the University's emergency response system.
"The University has a robust emergency man
agement plan that is managed by EH&S and sup
ported by numerous departments within the Uni
versity. including Public Safety," they said.
Stanford's response plan is based on what the of
ficials called "an all-hazards response," meaning that
a single plan exists to handle many different poten
tial emergencies.
"I am sure what most people want to hear is that
we have a specific plan for fires and a specific plan
for a chemical spill and a specific plan for a flood."
the officials said. "The problem is that there are infi-
nite [varieties] of any situation, so you
really cannot plan out exactly what will
be done, which is why you need a gen
eral way in which calls are handled and
managed."
The University's first response to
emergencies involves the activation of
the Situation Triage and Assessment
Team (STAT), which includes staff
from the DPS. EH&S, Facilities and
other operational departments. Ihe
STAT team was recently activated last

Tuesday when a 5.6 magnitude earth
quake rattled campus. Tine group
meets immediately either over the
phone or in person to share status up
dates and decide what action needs to
be taken.
If an incident has broader implica
tions for the operation of the Universi
ty. the officials said, the Emergency'
Operations Center (EOC) is activat
ed. The President, Provost and other
senior administrators are then called
in to assist in the management of the
incident.
While the summer's fires did result
in STAT meetings, they did not require
the activation of the EOC. the emer
gencv management officials wrote.

"Had the fires reached the magni
tude of what has happened in South
ern California, the EOC would have
been activated," they said.
TTie summer fires did encourage
further initiatives to improve preven
tative measures against wildfires on
campus.
Wilson, Gibbs, Perry and Christof
ferson explained that as a result of the
fires. Buildings and Grounds Mainte
nance enhanced firebreaks in the
foothills and trimmed brush and trees
near residential neighborhoods. Addi
tionally. the Department of Sustain
ability and Energy Management in
stalled new fire hydrants to supple
ment existing ones.

The foothill fires also encouraged
efforts to develop a system for notify
ing students, faculty and staff of emer
gencies.
"We had been exploring tools for
mass notification prior to the fire,"
they said, "but the fire served as good
example of the need for enhancing our
existing systems."
Should fires similar to those that
occurred in the foothills last summer
happen during the schtx)! year or in the
middle of campus, emergency man
agement officials said they would not
need to make adjustments to existing
plans.
They added that in addition to the
actions taken by STAT and the EOC,

the chance of fires spreading through
buildings on campus is limited by fire
suppression systems.
"All undergraduate residences are
outfitted with fire sprinklers as are
many of the major buildings on the
campus," the officials said.
In the event that fires did get out of
control and there was a credible safety
threat, Wilson, Gibbs, Perry anil
Christofferson wrote that an evacua
tion could be ordered.
"If the fire were as extensive as in
Southern California, the President
might decide to close campus for a pe
riod of time," they explained. "We
would then come up with a plan for
helping students disperse from the

campus to their homes or perhaps be
housed with local families."
This evacuation procedure would
be coordinated through the EOC,
which would ensure that a variety of
Stanford services were mobilized to
assist the move.
"Parking and Transportation Ser
vices might be tasked with using their
bus fleet to drive students to another
location. Vaden staff might be tasked
with treating] the injured." the offi
cials said. "Residential and Dining En
terprises might be tasked with setting
up tents and cots and feeding people."

from the DPS. EH&S, Facilities and
other operational departments. Ihe
STAT team was recently activated last

Tuesday when a 5.6 magnitude earth
quake rattled campus. Tine group
meets immediately either over the
phone or in person to share status up
dates and decide what action needs to
be taken.
If an incident has broader implica
tions for the operation of the Universi
ty. the officials said, the Emergency'
Operations Center (EOC) is activat
ed. The President, Provost and other
senior administrators are then called
in to assist in the management of the
incident.
While the summer's fires did result
in STAT meetings, they did not require
the activation of the EOC. the emer
gencv management officials wrote.

"Had the fires reached the magni
tude of what has happened in South
ern California, the EOC would have
been activated," they said.
TTie summer fires did encourage
further initiatives to improve preven
tative measures against wildfires on
campus.
Wilson, Gibbs, Perry and Christof
ferson explained that as a result of the
fires. Buildings and Grounds Mainte
nance enhanced firebreaks in the
foothills and trimmed brush and trees
near residential neighborhoods. Addi
tionally. the Department of Sustain
ability and Energy Management in
stalled new fire hydrants to supple
ment existing ones.

The foothill fires also encouraged
efforts to develop a system for notify
ing students, faculty and staff of emer
gencies.
"We had been exploring tools for
mass notification prior to the fire,"
they said, "but the fire served as good
example of the need for enhancing our
existing systems."
Should fires similar to those that
occurred in the foothills last summer
happen during the schtx)! year or in the
middle of campus, emergency man
agement officials said they would not
need to make adjustments to existing
plans.
They added that in addition to the
actions taken by STAT and the EOC,

the chance of fires spreading through
buildings on campus is limited by fire
suppression systems.
"All undergraduate residences are
outfitted with fire sprinklers as are
many of the major buildings on the
campus," the officials said.
In the event that fires did get out of
control and there was a credible safety
threat, Wilson, Gibbs, Perry anil
Christofferson wrote that an evacua
tion could be ordered.
"If the fire were as extensive as in
Southern California, the President
might decide to close campus for a pe
riod of time," they explained. "We
would then come up with a plan for
helping students disperse from the

campus to their homes or perhaps be
housed with local families."
This evacuation procedure would
be coordinated through the EOC,
which would ensure that a variety of
Stanford services were mobilized to
assist the move.
"Parking and Transportation Ser
vices might be tasked with using their
bus fleet to drive students to another
location. Vaden staff might be tasked
with treating] the injured." the offi
cials said. "Residential and Dining En
terprises might be tasked with setting
up tents and cots and feeding people."
