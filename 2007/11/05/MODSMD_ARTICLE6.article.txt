The Bay Area is no stranger to wildfires like
those that devastated Southern California last
month. Fires in the hills near UC-Berkeley in 1991
destroyed approximately 3,500 structures, killed 25
people and caused an estimated $1.5 billion in dam
age. This summer, blazes near the Dish demonstrat
ed that Stanford, too, could be affected by fire. And
while the University did not experience any serious
damage, the summer's fires, in conjunction with
those that burned recently in Southern California,
have caused some to question the I 'diversity's plans
in case of a campus-wide emergency.
According to campus biologist Alan Launder,
Stanford narrowly escaped damage during the sum
mer's blazes.
"1 lad the winds been blowing in a different direc
tion during late June's fire," Launder said, "there
was real potential for some structures being de
stroyed."
Launder added that faculty houses at the fringes
of campus are most at risk from wildfires because
they are adjacent to the foothills where fires start.
"If a fire got going in the faculty houses, and if
conditions were right: hot, dry, lots of wind," he said,
"then it could spread further into campus."
Ihe University has a detailed emergency re
sponse system in place to deal with fires and other
natural disasters. Stanford's response model is based
on the Incident Command System (ICS),a proce
dure used by the U.S. government to respond to
major emergencies.

Safety (DPS) Laura Wilson, Associate Vice Provost

about the University's emergency response system.
"The University has a robust emergency man
agement plan that is managed by EH&S and sup
ported by numerous departments within the Uni
versity. including Public Safety," they said.
Stanford's response plan is based on what the of
ficials called "an all-hazards response," meaning that
a single plan exists to handle many different poten
tial emergencies.
"I am sure what most people want to hear is that
we have a specific plan for fires and a specific plan
for a chemical spill and a specific plan for a flood."
the officials said. "The problem is that there are infi-
