November 5,1985:
Kaplan Report
criticizes police

A University investigation
of alleged police brutality at
an Oct. 11 sit-in found police
actions "wrong and unjustifi
able** but called for no specif
ic disciplinary action against
Stanford officers.
Nine students were arrest
ed in the Old Union sit-in.
which was staged to protest
University investments in
companies doing business in
South Africa. Ihe University
investigation, commissioned
by University President Don
ald Kennedy and conducted
by Law Prof. John Kaplan,
centered on possible brutality
during the removal of four of
the arrestees.
In the report. Kaplan calls
the events that took place at
North County Jail in Palo
Alto, where some of the stu
dents were taken after their
arrest, "far murkier" than the
events at Old I Jnion. Stanford
senior Robby Perkins said he
was beaten at the jail during a
strip search.
The report states that
Perkins "emerged with a con
siderable number of such
(bruises)... certainly consis
tent with his having received
an unlawful beating."
