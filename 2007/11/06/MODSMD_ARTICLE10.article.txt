# Children, grandparents tap feet to Vivaldi

### MAX MCCLURE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vivaldi has been out of vogue among the
elite concert-going public for a while now. I le is
maligned as being overly repetitive, superficial
and — though this is never said, but rather im
plied— populist. National Public Radio com
mentator Rob Kapilow. host of the "What
Makes It Great?" series, uses the term "get
table.' Vivaldi, he opines, is far from simplistic,
but nevertheless "gettable by everyone — even
those with no musical background." This combi
nation of accessibility and brilliance applies just
as well to Kapilow s combination lecture and
concert of the composer's "Spring" and "Sum
mer" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last Friday.
The basic impulse behind the "What Makes
It Great?" series is to provide audiences with a
concert but first, to identify those elements of
the masterpiece in question that contribute to its
greatness and present them in a clear manner to
an audience that may or may not have any mu
sical experience. It is a complex idea, and one
very much dependent on the personality of the
commentator. In the wrong hands, this sort of
analysis could be tedious and pedantic. Kapilow,
however, makes the experience an irresistibly
entertaining one. Me is an immensely likable
and enthusiastic tummler. bespectacled and
eternally smiling. I lis enthusiasm for the subject
is unmistakable, and his floppily energetic ami
cability is infectious.

quick-talking hut clear figure such as Kapilow.
I le peppered his initial discussion of the concer
ti with musical examples so seamlessly integrat
ed into his speech that Vivaldi seemed almost an
extension of his patter, or vice versa.The beauty
of this format is that each of Kapilows system
atic breakdowns of the score finds immediate
musical expression. When he unpeels each layer
of instrumentation, revealing the simple ele
ments that underlie Vivaldi's complex pastoral
scenes, or when he strips away the ornamenta
tion to reveal the importance of the piece's "su
perficial details," the passage the ensemble plays
next sounds incomparably richer. Kapilow
makes concrete the inherent drama of the
pieces.
Still, the secret to the night's success lies as
much in the skill of Kapilow and the Stanford
Chamber Strings as performers as in the incisive

analysis. Kapilow has a flair for audience con
nection, and he would often include the primari
ly blue-haired crowd through inventive interac
tive portions — one of which involved attempt
ing to teach us to play the fiery violin solo in the
third movement of "Summer." In turn, the Stan
ford Chamber Strings, though they have been
relegated so far to the background of this re
view. provided a viscerally exciting interpreta
tion of these two oft-performed pieces. Precise
and expressive, the musicians were even visual
ly entertaining, vigorously pulsing with Vivaldi's
motoric rhythms and emphasizing each of Kapi
low's talking points with kinesthetic clues. The
ensemble did occasionally err on the side of the
unsubtle thrill in their dramatic dynamics, but
served overall as an excellent complement to
the commentary.
Any program of classical music that get chil
dren and grandparents tapping their feet to its
rhythms and punctuating the beginning of each
newly identifiable phrase with the attentiveness
of the truly interested is worth seeing. Unfortu
nately. the Vivaldi program ran one night only.
Nevertheless, the "What Makes It Great?" se
ries will continue in the spring on April 2, 2(X)8
with an examination of how Schubert. Wolf and
Schumann have interpreted the works of
Goethe — a performance that comes highly
recommended. Recordings of other Kapilow
lecture/concert combinations are also widely
available in stores.
