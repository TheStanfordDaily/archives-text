Bush urges Musharraf to
restore Pakistani democracy

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Bush urged Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf on Monday to "restore
democracy as quickly as possible,"
choosing mild disappointment over
punishment or more pointed rhetoric to
react to the declaration of emergency
rule in anti-terror ally Pakistan.
Bush did not speak directly to
Musharraf, a leader who took power in a
1999 coup but whom he has previously
hailed as a friend he trusts and as a
strong defender of freedom. Instead, the
president handed that task to Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice, who spoke
with the Pakistani leader on the devel
oping crisis for about 20 minutes from
her plane en route home from the Mid
dle East.
Bush said he directed Rice to deliver
this message: "We expect there to be
elections as soon as possible and that the
president should remove his military
uniform."
They were the president's first public
comments on the situation since
Musharraf imposed a state of emer
gency. suspended his country's constitu
tion. ousted the country's top judge, sti

tied independent media and deployed
troops to crush dissent. He called it nec
essary to prevent a takeover by Islamic
extremists.
Bush mixed concern for Musharraf's
actions with praise for Pakistan's coop
eration in combatting al-Qaida terror
ists believed to be rebuilding strong
holds on the largely lawless border with
Afghanistan.
"President Musharraf has been a
strong fighter against extremists and
radicals," Bush said at the end of an Oval
Office meeting with TUrkish Prime Min
ister RecepTayyip Erdogan.
Even a senior administration official,
at a White 1 louse briefing, merely called
Musharraf "a friend who we think has
done something ill-advised."The official
spoke on condition of anonymity so he
could talk more freely about the behind
the-scenes thoughts of the White House.
Despite billions in U.S. aid to Pak
istan since Musharraf declared himself a
war-on-terror partner after the 2(K)1 at
tacks. Bush appeared resigned that the
United States has little leverage to influ
ence Musharraf's behavior.
"Our hope now is that he hurry back to
elections." Bush said. "All we can do is
continue to work with the president as
well as others in the Pak government to
make it abundantly clear the position of
the United States."
