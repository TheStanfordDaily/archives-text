## Author questions CIA intelligence Reporter skeptical of Iraq war information 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
"The CIA never thought all their
intelligence was right." said L.A.
Fimes reporter Bob Drogin in Mc-
Clatchy Hall last night. "They just
never considered that it was all
wrong."
In "Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the
Con Man Who Caused a War." Dro
gin's new hook on the rationale for
the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the re
porter claims that the CIA was. in
fact, dead wrong when it came to
America's intelligence of the situa
tion in Iraq.
"I became more and more deter
mined to get to the bottom of that."
he said to last night s audience.
According to Drogin. the govern
ment relied heavily on the hearsay of
Rafid Ahmed Alwan — a manic de
pressive chemical engineer also
known as Curveball. his CIA pseudo
nym — about biological weapons in
Iraq. Alwan, who fled Iraq in 1999 and
sought asylum in Germany, embel
lished his story about Iraq's biological
weapons program in order to speed
his admittance into the country.
"The Germans were convinced
there was a secret program, and sud
denly this guy walks through the

door." Drogin said. "His information
was treated like gold."
Still, Drogin acknowledged that
many people raised doubts about the
information since it relied on a single
source. But after the Sept. 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, those caveats were
forgotten, and Alwan's information,
translated from Arabic to German to
English, became the main justifica
tion for declaring war on Iraq.
"So, we go to war," Drogin said.
As it was later discovered.
Alwan's claims were exaggerated at
best, and fabricated at worst, which
the CIA officially admitted in 2(X)4.
"The CIA conned itself here,"
Drogin said. "They saw what they
wanted to see. they heard what they
wanted to hear, and they told the
White House what they wanted to
know."
According to Drogin, the CIA
had never met Alwan and didn't
even know his real name.
"I think it's instructive of how
things go bad," he said. "It's frighten
ing to me how often they're wrong."
Alwan has never recanted his
claims, and Germany has never offi
cially labeled him a fabricator.To the
best of Drogin's knowledge, Alwan
still lives in southern Germany and
goes by a different name, under a
German program similar to witness
protection in the U.S.
Because of these protections,
Drogin was unable to speak with
Alwan.

"It's like, where's Osama?" Dro
gin said. "If 1 knew, I would find him."
Drogin, a former Knight Fellow at
Stanford and Media Fellow for the
Hoover Institution,broke the Curve
ball story for the L.A.Times in 2(K)4.
His book came out earlier this year
and will soon be made into a movie.
Last night's speech was followed
by an opportunity for the audience,
which mostly consisted of older men.
to ask questions.
"I am so angry at this goddamn
administration," one audience mem
ber burst out. "1 wish you could do
something to stop this." referring to
the possibility that the U.S. might
soon declare war on Iran, which Dro
gin said he personally opposes.
"But bad information takes on a
life of its own," Drogin said in reply.
"I look at it like medieval clerics
searching for witchcraft."
Toyon Resident Fellow Amy
Friedman, Drogin's cousin, came to
the speech with other family mem
bers, including her two children.
"He told us about the book while
he was still writing it." she said."lt's a
really interesting angle on the whole
run-up to the war. and how. if you
want to believe something, it's easy
to find evidence to corroborate it."
And as for the rest of the story.
"I'm not going to tell you," Drogin
said."lt's in the book."
