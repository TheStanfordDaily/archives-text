## Group hopes for arts co-op house 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Seven students gathered in the
Arroyo lounge Sunday evening to
discuss plans for a new community
arts-based co-operative house on
campus. With hopes of opening the
co-op next fall, the students envision
a house that will act as a home for arts
events and as the mouthpiece for the
arts community.
Shelly Ronen '09. student organiz
er for the initiative, estimated that
about 40 people have emailed her re
garding the creation of the new co
op, and the Facebook group she cre
ated has 43 members.
Interest for a community arts
themed house has been steadily in
creasing in recent years. The emer
gence of student organizations such
as Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts (SOCA) in 1999 and
Stanford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts (SICA) in 2005 are testa
ments to the rise in arts interest on
campus. SICA won the Dean of Stu
dents Outstanding Achievement
Award in 2007.
Ilie arts co-operative would allow
student artists to come together and
organize in a space run by their peers.
Interested students could use the
space both for the creation of proj
ects and as a home for discussion,crit
icism and mobilization of new ideas
and cooperative projects.
"There is a tension on campus that
is unspoken that Stanford is lacking
in the arts," said Klara Klein '09.
" Ibere are just not many spaces

available for theatre and music, for
example. Coming home to something
creative like the community arts co
op would provide an outlet to express
oneself in a communal space."
The project is pitched as an aca
demic-themed house, but the com
munal living aspect is key for the
community-arts house. While they
are receptive to the idea of running
the community-arts based co-op in a
dormitory, the students emphasized
that such a living space would not be
ideal, as it would not have a kitchen
and would promote a divisive and in
dividualistic living environment.
The community aspect would ex
tend beyond creating a home for
artists.
"By building community, we
would also be encouraging the devel
opment of relationships and connec
tions between sub-communities
within Stanford," Ronen said. "Com
munity connections are strongest
when a house cooks, cleans and
works together."
She also stressed that the co-op
will not be limited to arts majors or
those taking arts classes.
"This community arts co-op is a
home for anyone interested in the
arts," she added. "We welcome any
one who is passionate about their cre
ative ideas and looking for extracur
ricular stimulation and stress relief
through group arts."
Students in attendance expressed
excitement for the project as they
doodled on a white sheet with col
ored markers, naming project ideas
that would work well in a co-opera

tive arts house: photography lessons,
pottery and ceramics nights, critique
nights with both personal and guest
art and cooking lessons.
Despite the students' enthusiasm,
Nathaniel Boswell, associate director
of Residential Education (ResEd),
said that, because the project is still in
its infancy, he could not predict its fu
ture.
"Residential Education did have
occasion to meet with student Shelly
Ronen who was looking for informa
tion and advice about how to move
forward with a proposal for an Arts
Co-operative on campus," Boswell
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Res
idential Education encourages cre
ative thinking and suggestions for
supplementing the programs in our
campus residences, but at this point
we have only been involved in one
preliminary conversation with a sin
gle student," he added. "There has
been no commitment for next or any
subsequent year. We are interested in
hearing more about the project and
taking a look at a concrete proposal
in the coming months."
Ronen. however, hopes that the
house will be approved and in opera
tion next year, for her final year at
Stanford.
"We're very confident this co-op
will be up and running next year," she
said. "We will submit our proposal
this December according to the
ResEd application deadline in the
hopes that we can achieve our aim."
