## Editorial Board Starving artists of department honors 
### 
As a university, Stanford generally
does an effective job of connecting
academia to the real world. Stanford
has a beneficial relationship with Silicon
Valley industry, the CDC compiles potential
jobs to help students transition into the
working world and. no matter how much
students complain. PWR 2 ensures that
everyone knows how to use PowerPoint be
fore he or she graduates. Despite Stanford's
good overall track record, however, when it
comes to departmental honors programs,
too much of the University remains secure
ly locked in the ivory tower.
Stanford awards various kinds of honors
to its students. Students with CPAs in the
top 15 percent of a class graduate with
"Distinction," a replacement for the Greek
honors that other universities award. In ad
dition. students may graduate "with Hon
ors" based on individual departmental
policies. This intra-departmental system
appropriately recognizes the problems of
comparing grades and accomplishments
across departments. The problem with the
current system, however, lies within the de
partments that teach creative subjects but
refuse to grant honors for creative accom
plishments.
The English Department is a notably dis
appointing example of (his disconnect. Al
though students can focus on creative writ
ing in either fiction or poetry as an emphasis
within the major, they cannot earn depart
mental honors by writing a creative thesis
— currently, only a work of literary criticism
satisfies the requirement. Students who
choose such a focus are interested in writing
creatively,so.given that they meet the other
criteria for honors (such as the minimum
GPA of 3.5,c0mm0n to many departments),
they should be allowed to receive honors for
a novel or poetic anthology.
Hie department already recognizes the
value of non-academic writers; the Stegner
Fellows receive grants both to teach under

graduate writing seminars and to write. Why
marginalize the value of a creative contribu
tion for students who excel in their chosen
field?
The problem is not restricted to the Eng
lish Department. Film and Media Studies
grants honors to students who write an aca
demic thesis only — no option for budding
filmmakers. Studio Art has no honors pro
gram, so majors must pursue honors
through the Humanities Honors or another
program. The Drama Department requires
a creative senior project for all of its stu
dents but grants honors only to those who
also write a related research paper. The
theme clearly indicates a priority on classi
cally academic work that could lead toward
a doctorate degree. While this is a worthy
goal to prepare students who are interested
in working toward further degrees, the sta
tus of "Honors" should not be reserved only
for those who wish to remain in academia.
A few departments do allow for creative
theses. For example, the Feminist Studies
Program allows students (even from other
majors) to earn Honors with a creative the
sis, though the program also requires an ac
companying academic work on the creative
work. The Music Department awards hon
ors based on the discretion of the faculty to
students who produce an exceptional inde
pendent project. However, it is not enough
that a few departments recognize the value
in creative works.
Granting honors status in the depart
ments that do not already do so would ap
propriately legitimize these creative en
deavors. Writing a book should not be seen
as less praiseworthy than writing about a
book; a department should recognize stu
dents aspiring to become professors but also
students aspiring to become poets. Creative
departments should end the absurd discon
nect between what they teach and what they
honor and allow students to write creative
honors theses.
