## I heart firearms 
### 
When I tell people I'm from Manhat
tan. they usually say they can't
imagine raising kids who have to
grow up without a backyard. What they ac
tually mean to say is they can't imagine rais
ing kids whose closest experience to shoot
ing game is looking at glassed-in taxidermy
displays at the Natural History Museum.
Say what you will about Bush lovin',
Kmart shoppin", gun-totin' rednecks. I was
convinced that a good ol' fashioned. 12-
gauge Remington 1100 can pull on the
heartstrings of even the bloodiest of bleed
ing liberals. For that matter, so can a shoot
ing range that offers a chili bean, tri-tip. Pol
ish dog 11 a.m. weekend brunch.
Rallying the two most ammo- and BBO
hungry friends I could find, I headed out last
Sunday to fulfill dashed childhood dreams
at the Coyote Valley Sporting Clay, 40 miles
from Stanford in Morgan Hill.
Admittedly. 1 was a bit disappointed to
be fulfilling said dashed childhood dreams
in the form of a game known as "sporting
clays." or shooting at airborne clay targets.
Hopes further plummeted when I saw that
these targets were orange biodegradable
disks that resembled neither alive — nor
even clay — "pigeons."
That said, even I can recognize that
sporting clays, nicknamed "Golf with a
Shotgun," is probably the closest to hunting
I'm ever going to get. I tried to remain opti
mistic as we headed into the Coyote Valley
hunting lodge.
Various middle-aged white male patrons
wandered around, checking out the lodge's
assorted ammunition supplies and hunting
apparel. On the counter sat brochures for
the California Hunter Education Program,
which pictured camo-adorned eight-year
olds and their dads proudly showing off var
ious wildlife conquests.
I tried to imagine my own Park Avenue
mother and me, smiling broadly in front of a
bloody deer carcass twice our collective size.
I couldn't.
Simultaneously, the guy behind the
counter was trying to imagine three college
kids going out to the fields to shoot without
any previous training or experience. In real
ity. I didn't want to try to imagine this cither
and was just hoping he'd produce an avail
able. pro-bono instructor without charging
us each the $54 Beginner's Experience fee.
Surprisingly, he did convince a sporting
clay member named Matt to postpone his
brunch and take us out — in exchange, of
course, for 100 free "birds' (a generous

bribe apparently, based on the resulting
twinkle in Matt's eyes).
The four of us then geared up with all the
appropriate eye and ear protection and
headed out to the clay range. My friend Sean
was up first, followed by my roommate
Ruth. and. while neither managed to hit the
whizzing (OK. gently sailing) target, they
fared much better than I was about to.
While I didn't actually see where my shot
landed. I could tell how bad a shot it was
from Sean and Ruth's ensuing mockery and
laughter. And from Matt saying that if this
were a game of human survival. I would go
hungry.
He went back to the golf cart and re
turned with a BB gun. which looked identi
cal to the one nine-year-old Ralphie wanted
in "A Christmas Story.'' Matt actually got his
from his wife on his 50th birthday, but his af
fection for it was no less tender.
Working with the BB gun. my old friend,
"spatial awareness impairment," struck
ngain. as for some reason it proved impossi
ble for me to visually line up the three mark
ers Matt said I needed to sec at once in order
to aim correctly.
"Some people just can't line up the three
objects," Matt said in an apparent attempt to
console me, but immediately added, "It's
just that usually those people tend to be old
men."
Or people who try to shoot BB guns with
both eyes open instead of one. After closing
my left eye and taking a few practice shots, I
finally hit the still target and was ready to
move back up to the shotgun.
()n my first shot, 1 jumped the gun,shoot
ing too early at the flying disk. On my sec
ond try, however, the God-fearing Republi
can gods smiled down on me, and my target
miraculously exploded into a shower of or
ange biodegradable confetti.
Matt offered to let me try it again, but I
figured I 'd better not exhaust my beginner's
luck. Ruth and Sean succeeded in their next
rounds as well, with neither Ruth's flip-flops
nor pearls deterring her from becoming the


Courtney
Weaver
best shot of us all.
Though the three of us left feel
ing pretty accomplished, Ruth aptly
pointed out on the way back to the
car that there was something some
what unfulfilling about destroying
things with just a pull of a trigger. We
contemplated beating the shit out of
each other in the parking lot for a
bit. but decided in the end just to re
turn home.
That was that, and on the way
back I realized the anti-climax of
Coyote Valley had stripped any re
maining luster from my childhood
gun-toting fantasies. At least I finally
shot — a souvenir orange
biodegradable mosaic and a stash of
stolen bullets may not be quite as im
pressive as moose antlers or a dead
deer carcass, but they look pretty
damn good on my wall, regardless.

Matt offered to let me try it again, but I
figured I 'd better not exhaust my beginner's
luck. Ruth and Sean succeeded in their next
rounds as well, with neither Ruth's flip-flops
nor pearls deterring her from becoming the

best shot of us all.
Though the three of us left feel
ing pretty accomplished, Ruth aptly
pointed out on the way back to the
car that there was something some
what unfulfilling about destroying
things with just a pull of a trigger. We
contemplated beating the shit out of
each other in the parking lot for a
bit. but decided in the end just to re
turn home.
That was that, and on the way
back I realized the anti-climax of
Coyote Valley had stripped any re
maining luster from my childhood
gun-toting fantasies. At least I finally
shot — a souvenir orange
biodegradable mosaic and a stash of
stolen bullets may not be quite as im
pressive as moose antlers or a dead
deer carcass, but they look pretty
damn good on my wall, regardless.
