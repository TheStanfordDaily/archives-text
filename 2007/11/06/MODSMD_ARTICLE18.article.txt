# Pleading Inanity
## Existential kimchi 
### 
I flew to South Korea last week for a
friend's wedding (and boy were my arms
tired!).
In all seriousness, folks, as with most
things 1 do. my visit to South Korea was beset
with existential conflicts about the scope of
humanity, the nature of suffering and the
proper limits of soju drinking when your Ko
rean host has a superhuman tolerance for his
country's native spirit.
On the morning of his wedding. I found
myself meditating, looking over variegated
foliage and rolling hills, thinking to myself,
"Life is good." I had difficulty swallowing the
sentiment though, because, as a socially con
scious global citizen and amateur Buddhist, I
was aware that people all over the world en
dure brutal treatment, face extreme poverty
and have nothing even approximating the
amenities that I take for granted on a daily
basis.
With its mix of privilege and privation,
Korea is no exception. Although living stan

dards and civil freedoms in South Korea are
rapidly approaching those of the West, con
cerns remain over the government's enforce
ment of its draconian National Security Law,
which often suppresses peaceful anti-gov
ernment protests. Most pressingly, many
South Koreans' brethren, trapped in the
north under the dictatorship of Kim Jong 11,
have neither political liberty nor material
sustenance. As a result, the Korean Peninsu
la is a microcosm of the rest of the world, in
that the lucky live rather fulfilling lives while
the unlucky are marginalized and deprived.
As the day continued. I moved from quiet

meditation to a luscious facial massage (I had
a lot of tension in my brow). As pungent lo
tions were coaxed into the yawning pores of
my friend and me. 1 thought to myself, he is
safely in the "lucky" category. Currently a
doctoral candidate at Yonsei I 'niversity.he is
on his way to establishing a family whose
happiness and prosperity would be a para
digm of what it means to "live well" by any
body's standards.
The question 1 just couldn't shake was
this: How could those who are personally
well off deal with the pervasive suffering of
others?
I received some guidance at his wedding
ceremony.
To be fair, due to my poor Korean skills, I
didn't understand a thing that was said for
the entire wedding. At the end. however, my
friend pulled off a touching surprise inspired
by a scene from his favorite Hollywood ro-


Vishnu
Sridharan
mantic comedy, "Love Actually."
As the ceremony drew to a close,
the new couple began its procession
out of the church. Then, all of a sud
den, curtains opened to reveal a 10-
member choir in the rafters. In har
monious unison, they started chanti
ng, "Love, Love, Love." Trumpets
joined in as an electric guitar provid
ed back-up. The crowd rose and
began to clap as the words rained

down: "There's nothing you can do,
that can't be done/ Nothing you can
sing that can't be sung/ It's easy/ All
you need is love."
The room broke into song. The
new bride wept tears of joy as she
embraced her lover. And I, never the
one for stoicism, cried more than
when Mark first confessed his love
to Juliet via placards on Christmas
Eve.There was nothing I could say.
All you need is love. Might it ac
tually be that easy?

All Vishnu needs is love. If you've got
any to spare, email hint at
