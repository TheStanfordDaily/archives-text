# Op-Ed
## A
						broader perspective 
### 
While yesterday's op-ed, "Israeli oc
cupation: Injustice in our name." ef
fectively attended to many Israeli
"injustices," it did not once address the rea
sons why Israel has a strong military pres
ence.
We agree that creating a lasting peace be
tween Israelis and Palestinians is an impor
tant issue that needs to be addressed. We also
believe that through hard work and conces
sions from both sides, it can be achieved.
Only looking at one side of the issue, howev
er. will effectively prevent any viable solu
tions from being discussed.
In the aforementioned op-ed, body
counts of dead Palestinians were cited from
an Israeli human rights group, BTselem.
However, this same source that reported
4,345 Palestinians killed by Israelis since
September 2(XK) also reports 1,027 Israelis
killed by Palestinians. Statistics can be mis
leading; Since the populations of both groups
are in such close contact, the majority of the
people on both sides have been affected by

the conflict. Mow is it at all constructive to
claim that Palestinian blood is being shed
and not mention the fact that Israeli blood is
also spilled? This cycle of violence inherent
ly requires two participants; placing all the
blame on Israel is both misleading and
counter-productive.
By only looking at one side, it is possible
to reach erroneous conclusions such as the
stated comparison between the conflict in Is
rael and those in Darfur and Burma. Darfur
and Burma are situations that entail mass
killings of a group because of their ethnicity.
In Israel, the violence comes from both sides;
portraying Palestinians as innocent victims is
false.
Isolating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
from internal Palestinian violence is mislead
ing. BTselem states that since 2000,556 Pales
tinians have been killed by Palestinians, and
120 of these were killed due to their suspected
collaboration with Israel. Not only is there sig
nificant internal violence, it is often directed at
those who arc working toward peace.

It is also misleading to isolate Israel from
the events and attitudes in the rest of the
Middle East. Before criticizing the amount
of aid that Israel receives from the U.S.. one
must understand why Israel receives this mil
itary support. Most of the surrounding na
tions are currently calling, or have called in
the past, for the destruction of Israel. When
Pakistan continues to deny Israel recogni
tion and the leader of Iran continues his
rants, Israel must maintain its ability to pro
tect its citizens. Look at a map â€” it is clear
why Israel needs a strong military.
We hope that after reading this op-ed, and
gaining a broader perspective on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, the Stanford community
can start working on a constructive dialogue
and support solutions that will lead to a fair
and lasting peace.
