## Ricker reopens for business Dining hall features many renovations but complaints of construction persist 
### YII WEN CHUAH 
Soft armchairs, LCD televisions, skylights letting in
the sunshine and the aroma of pizza sizzling in the oven
— after months of renovations, the new Ricker Dining
opened its doors to Sterling Quad residents on Sunday,
garnering both praise for the upgraded facility and com
plaints about the inconvenience caused by the 15-week
construction project.
"Since we needed to renovate, it was a chance for us
to do something different," said Executive Director of
Stanford Dining Rafi Taherian. "Dining halls are typi
cally used only three times a day — why not extend its
usage? We want students to use this space for meeting
up with friends, doing work and hanging out."
Ricker underwent renovation starting in June.
ITiough the dining hall did remain open throughout the
remodeling process, the bulk of its food was prepared in
Wilbur Dining Hall and transported across campus.
Grilled entrees were cooked on an outdoor grill in the
field next to Ricker.
While the newly renovated dining facility opened to

way I would have drawn into Robinson had I known."
Lauren Catherine Norwood '10 was so inconve

"They do their heavy work in the morning and not in
the afternoon because it's more convenient for them that
way," she said."We're trying to start a petition to obtain a
