Use call sign W6YX to
communicate during crises
To the editor:
Given last week's earthquake
that was felt throughout the Bay
Area, we are writing to raise aware
ness of the service that FCC-licensed
amateur radio operators provide to
the Stanford campus during crises
that can saturate or destroy commu
nication infrastructure. Although we
have no solid data regarding com
munication outrages following the
earthquake, the Oct. 30 article,
"Earthquake rocks Stanford," high
lighted brief interruptions to cellular
service as demand peaked within the
system. As one might reasonably as
sume, a more damaging quake would
cause more severe interruptions,
possibly leading to failure of the cel
lular, landline and Internet services
we nowadays take for granted. In

such a scenario, amateur radio oper
ators provide a vital role by relaying
information concerning individuals'
health and welfare to concerned par
ties all over the globe.
At Stanford, a student-led group
of radio amateurs exists to serve the
campus in such an event. We are li
censed by the FCC under the call
sign W6YX, and our station is in
plain sight from the Dish in the
Foothills. This station supports wire
less communication over a large
swath of the electromagnetic spec
trum and enables global transmis
sion of information using digital,
satellite, AM. FM and single-side
band voice modes. We want to make
clear to readers that we consider it
our primary responsibility to serve
the Stanford community in any
emergency, major earthquake or
otherwise.
Beyond this vital role, we encour

age all Stanford students, faculty, and
staff to participate in our organiza
tion. We also mentor individuals in
the process toward obtaining an
FCC license, provide a forum for un
derstanding the science of wireless
technology and enable you to com
municate with every corner of the
earth. Our amateur radio operators
are actually far from being amateur
â€” in any other realm, they would be
considered highly trained communi
cation professionals. With our organ
ization dating from the early 19205,
we have a decades-old record of
pushing the envelope into new radio
frontiers.
If you think your iPhone is cool,
wait until you see what we can do!
