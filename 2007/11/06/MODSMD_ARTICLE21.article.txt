## Medical quacks: To them, Halloween is all year long 
### 
Cold season is quickly ap
proaching. and it's about time
to get that flu shot. Those of
you who choose to receive this vac
cination will probably make your
way over to Vaden in the next few
weeks or pay your primary care
physician a visit over Thanksgiving
break. But my guess is that all of you
flu-vaccine-seekers would think
twice about getting the shot from a
self-proclaimed "nurse" or "doctor"
operating out of the backseat of a
car.
Sadly, medical fraud is a beast
that is not extinct,but alive and well.
What's more, the circumstances
under which these quacks practice
their "medicine" are often far more
sophisticated than using a car as an
impromptu office. Faced with these
less obvious scams, most patients
are easily deceived.
On Feb. 17,2006, CBS 5 reported
that Stephen Turner was charged
with giving fake vaccinations and
medical exams to recent immi
grants applying for citizenship. Pos
ing as a physician, Turner provided
medical services at two clinics in
San Francisco's Mission District,
among other California locales.
One of the clinics was integrated
into a larger office that assisted im
migrants with acquiring citizenship.
Turner duped an estimated 1,400
immigrants by administering fake
medical tests and fake vaccinations.
According to the San Francisco
DA, he drew blood and injected pa
tients with saline solution.
It is not only those new to the
U.S. who fall victim to such medical
fraud. On Oct. 6, John Ellis reported
that Mario Perez was arrested in
Fresno for posing as a physician and
performing collagen lip injections
out of a beauty salon. He charged
$100 for these "collagen" injections,
a price five to 25 times cheaper than

the real procedure. As it turned out,
the bargain had its share of hidden
costs: The women Perez treated de
veloped painful, solid lumps on
their lips from the substance that
was decidedly not collagen.
How can we solve this problem?
How can we regulate the unli
censed, the untraceable? Ultimate
ly, we can't. Prevention of medical
fraud, like any other form of fraud,
can only be achieved through wide
spread dissemination of informa
tion.
First and foremost, the public
must be made aware of medical
fraud. Just as TV networks con
stantly run commercials about re
porting domestic violence and news
segments warning against the latest
Internet identity theft scams, there
must be similar media coverage and
public service announcements
about the seriousness of medical
fraud. Furthermore, patient advoca
cy groups should be involved;
booths should be set up at health
fairs. Just as emissaries from
Planned Parenthood and D.A.R.E.
visit schools and provide education
al presentations, representatives
from state Medical Boards or even
from local hospitals should provide
analogous sessions.
Children are often very effective
communication lines to parents.
Additionally, such outreach pro
grams would ensure that younger
generations would already be well
informed about the dangers of med
ical fraud.
Intuitively, the next step after
publicizing a problem is to propose
solutions, and a good starting point
would be identifying possible warn
ing signs of medical fraud. Prices
that seem too good to be true, ques
tionable office locations, unprofes
sional office procedures and an ap
parent lack of medical knowledge

or credibility should be ingrained
into the public's psyche as red flags
for medical fraud. Once the suspi
cion is there, verifying the legitima
cy of a "doctor" is incredibly simple.
Each state has a Medical Board
Web site that can easily be located
by an Internet search. Iliese Web
sites provide a searchable index of
licensed physicians of the state;
some Web sites even have a data
base of licensed osteopaths, podia
trists and acupuncturists.
Some may argue that patients
most often fall victim to fraudulent
doctors because they are seduced
by the very competitive prices of the
medical procedures offered. Educa
tion could also curb this problem.
Emphasis must be put on the fact
that treating the cost of one's
healthcare with such frugality will
not save money, but rather will like
ly jeopardize one's health and, in
the long run. be more expensive.
The public should be made to un
derstand that, while one might save
money on the original procedure,
the patient will inevitably incur
more out-of-pocket cost to repair
the damage or disfiguration caused
by an unskilled "physician." And
there is always a higher, looming
price: death. What seems like "the
best deal" at the time is often the
most unsafe and ultimately expen
sive decision to make.
Thus, the dissemination of infor
mation regarding both the preva
lence of medical fraud and the
means of identifying phony doctors
are the only practices that will con
vert prospective victims of medical
fraud into informed healthcare con
sumers.
