## CARD NETS WIN Stanford beats Concordia 82-70 in exhibition 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anthony Goods scored 22 points, Landry
Fields added 17 and. in a gritty 82-70 win over
Concordia University, No. 21 Stanford men's
basketball gave its fans several reasons for
optimism with the season opener against
Harvard just three days away.
"Concordia played hard-nosed, competi
tive basketball," head coach Trent Johnson
said. "It was good for us. There were some
good things, but there were some early jitters
which were to be expected."
The junior Goods' two-handed dunk put
Stanford ahead 13-2 four minutes into the
game. When diminutive guard Terrence Wor
thy (11 points) hit two straight threes to pull
the Eagles within 76-70 with two minutes left,
it was Goods with a layup and. two posses
sions later, two free throws to ice the victory.
In between, the Cardinal led most of the way
by a comfortable 8-12 point margin on the
strength of 51 percent shooting (26-of-51)
and 30 more free throw attempts (25-of-32,78
percent) than the visitors from Irvine,Calif.
Still. Goods was a harsh judge of his team's
performance — though Johnson sitting three
feet away might have had something to do
with that.
"I'd go with a C," he said. "Average. We
looked terrible at times, we looked decent at
times. We didn't handle the pressure that
well."
Goods was Stanford's second-leading
scorer with 13 points per game last year,so the
night's biggest surprise was the play of sopho
more wingman Landry Fields, who fans hope
is on the verge of a breakout sophomore year.
After shooting 5-of-7 from the field, going a
perfect 6-of-6 from the line and hustling for
several loose balls in just 17 minutes of play.
Fields earned hearty applause from both the
one-third-full arena and the Sixth Man sec
tion.
"At the offensive end. Landry shoots the
ball, and he's going to play well. He played
very well in the summer [in Italy], and he's
going to be a vital part of this team," said
Johnson, though both Johnson and Fields
himself emphasized a need to cut down on de
fensive lapses.
Former Stanford player Ken Ammann's
Concordia squad won the NAIA national
championship in 2(X)3 and is ranked No. 2 in
the division this year. And though they played
scared in the first half — rushing shots and
missing too many open looks — the under
sized Eagles settled down in the second and
legitimately pushed the Cardinal with solid,
fundamental basketball.
"That was a good basketball team," Goods
said. "It's not like we were playing Nowhere
State or something."
So while the casual fan may be upset Stan
ford didn't turn the exhibition into a laugher,
the Cardinal locker room concerned itself
with two bigger worries.
Concordia harassed Stanford into 18
turnovers with the same kind of full-court
pressure that Louisville used to devastating
effect in last year's NCAA Tournament
slaughter. Sophomore University of San
Francisco transfer Drew Shiller.junior Mitch
Johnson's backup at point guard, looked par
ticularly fazed in his first minutes in a Stan
ford uniform, though coach Johnson chalked
his performance up to nerves.

The defense-first unit's scoring struggles

pecially in the frontcourt, where seniors Peter
Prowitt and Taj Finger combined for just five
shots and 10 points in 32 total minutes despite
a significant size advantage.
But Finger brings mobility on defense that
the Lopez twins lack, and the other upper
classmen quietly showcased their strengths

hoop, and Hill added seven, despite an off

scorer.

Anthony Goods scored 22 points, Landry
Fields added 17 and. in a gritty 82-70 win over
Concordia University, No. 21 Stanford men's
basketball gave its fans several reasons for
optimism with the season opener against
Harvard just three days away.
"Concordia played hard-nosed, competi
tive basketball," head coach Trent Johnson
said. "It was good for us. There were some
good things, but there were some early jitters
which were to be expected."
The junior Goods' two-handed dunk put
Stanford ahead 13-2 four minutes into the
game. When diminutive guard Terrence Wor
thy (11 points) hit two straight threes to pull
the Eagles within 76-70 with two minutes left,
it was Goods with a layup and. two posses
sions later, two free throws to ice the victory.
In between, the Cardinal led most of the way
by a comfortable 8-12 point margin on the
strength of 51 percent shooting (26-of-51)
and 30 more free throw attempts (25-of-32,78
percent) than the visitors from Irvine,Calif.
Still. Goods was a harsh judge of his team's
performance — though Johnson sitting three
feet away might have had something to do
with that.
"I'd go with a C," he said. "Average. We
looked terrible at times, we looked decent at
times. We didn't handle the pressure that
well."
Goods was Stanford's second-leading
scorer with 13 points per game last year,so the
night's biggest surprise was the play of sopho
more wingman Landry Fields, who fans hope
is on the verge of a breakout sophomore year.
After shooting 5-of-7 from the field, going a
perfect 6-of-6 from the line and hustling for
several loose balls in just 17 minutes of play.
Fields earned hearty applause from both the
one-third-full arena and the Sixth Man sec
tion.
"At the offensive end. Landry shoots the
ball, and he's going to play well. He played
very well in the summer [in Italy], and he's
going to be a vital part of this team," said
Johnson, though both Johnson and Fields
himself emphasized a need to cut down on de
fensive lapses.
Former Stanford player Ken Ammann's
Concordia squad won the NAIA national
championship in 2(X)3 and is ranked No. 2 in
the division this year. And though they played
scared in the first half — rushing shots and
missing too many open looks — the under
sized Eagles settled down in the second and
legitimately pushed the Cardinal with solid,
fundamental basketball.
"That was a good basketball team," Goods
said. "It's not like we were playing Nowhere
State or something."
So while the casual fan may be upset Stan
ford didn't turn the exhibition into a laugher,
the Cardinal locker room concerned itself
with two bigger worries.
Concordia harassed Stanford into 18
turnovers with the same kind of full-court
pressure that Louisville used to devastating
effect in last year's NCAA Tournament
slaughter. Sophomore University of San
Francisco transfer Drew Shiller.junior Mitch
Johnson's backup at point guard, looked par
ticularly fazed in his first minutes in a Stan
ford uniform, though coach Johnson chalked
his performance up to nerves.
Even if Johnson is correct, he faces anoth
er problem that won't fade as quickly.The sec

starters with a 13-3 lead five minutes in. man
aged just six points in their five-minute shift.
The defense-first unit's scoring struggles
to score were hardly a surprise. It is unlikely
that all five of them will ever be on the floor at
once, but offensive depth has to be a worry, es
pecially in the frontcourt, where seniors Peter
Prowitt and Taj Finger combined for just five
shots and 10 points in 32 total minutes despite
a significant size advantage.
But Finger brings mobility on defense that
the Lopez twins lack, and the other upper
classmen quietly showcased their strengths
too. Slashing senior forward Fred Washington
scored 10 points on decisive drives to the
hoop, and Hill added seven, despite an off
night (2-of-9) for the team's most consistent
scorer.
All told, last night did nothing but rein
force the general feeling heading into the sea
