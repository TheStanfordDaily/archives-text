### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
The wins just keep on coming for Alex
Clayton. The standout freshman on the Stan
ford men's tennis team made it to the semifi
nals of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association
(ITA) National Indoor Championships last
weekend before losing to the top-ranked
player in the country, Virginia's Somdev Dev
varman.
Clayton opened the tournament with three
straight wins to reach the semis. He knocked
off Dominic Inglot of Virginia. Bassam Beidas
of Pepperdine and fourth-seeded Cireg Ouel
lette from the University of Florida. All the
victories were in straight sets.
On Saturday morning, Clayton faced
Somdev Dcwarman. tabbed No. 1 according
to the ITA rankings. It was a hard-fought
match, but Clayton ultimately fell short and
lost 6-4. fi-4. It was only the second loss of the
year for the freshman, making his season

record 9-2 — and eight of those wins have
come against nationally ranked opponents.
" ITiis was the first tournament I have
played indoors, and I thought I did well." Clay
ton said. "I was able to serve extremely well
this week, and I liked playing indoors a lot.

Freshman Alex Clayton was the Cardinal's top
performer at this weekend's National Indoor
Championships, losing to the top seed in the
semifinals. In his first season, he has amassed
a 9-2 record against some top competitors.
"My match against Somdev was
very close. We both played well, and
it came down to a few points. He's a
very good player."
Devvarman went on to win the
singles tournament, as well as the
doubles bracket in which he was the
top seed with teammate Treat Huey,
so there is little shame in losing such
a tough match.
Head coach John Whitlinger
mentioned before the weekend that
this tournament was about improve
ment, among other things. Clayton
agrees and feels that he has im
proved since his last competition.
"1 was playing great tennis [this
weekend]." Clayton said. "I got a lot
of confidence from this event and
will take that into the season. 1 am
pleased because I have improved
since the All-Americans [a month
ago]."
Sophomore Richard Wire won
his first round match Thursday to
reach the second round but lost to
Adam Holmstrom of Denver, 6-1,7-
6 (7-1). Holmstrom played well the
whole weekend and reached the
semifinals after knocking off the
tournament's second seed. Travis
Helgeson from Georgia.
"[Adam] played really great,"
Wire said. "He was lights-out."
The tournament was a good chal
lenge for the players — playing
against the nation's best competi
tion should pay dividends when the
season begins.
Next up for the team will be the first
dual match of the season. Stanford
will take on the University of
Hawaii in Maui on Nov. 20.
