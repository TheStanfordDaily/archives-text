## Cardinal evens conference record by beating Pacific 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team picked up right where it left
off after beating UC-Santa Cruz last
Thursday, winning consecutive games
against No. 8 UC-Davis on Saturday
and No. 13 Pacific on Sunday.
The victories bring the Cardinal's
record to 3-3 in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play (MPSF) and
13-6 overall.
"I was really satisfied with the way
we played." sophomore utility Drac
Wigo said of the weekend matches.
"Everyone played really well, and I
feel like we executed the team strate
gy and we played really well on de
fense. As for myself, I still need to
work on attackihg the goal for a bet
ter shot. We're going to do a lot of
drills so I can have better experience
when the situations arise."
The players' recent emphasis on
defense finally paid off on Saturday
as the Cardinal roughed out a 6-4
win by limiting the Davis offense.
The defense allowed a season low in
goals, and senior goalkeeper Sandy
Hohener's seven saves on Saturday
took pressure off of the team's of
fense. Junior driver Andrew Drake,

who has been playing well in the last
few weeks,continued his efforts with
two crucial goals in the second peri
od, giving Stanford a comfortable
lead 4-2 at halftime.
Drac Wigo and Sage Wright both
scored to build a 6-2 gap as the de
fense held the Aggies scoreless in
the third quarter. Stanford conceded
only two goals late in the fourth
quarter in bringing home the victory.
"[Senior] Ryan Fortune, he's a re
ally good defender." Drac Wigo said.
"And 1 think he doesn't get enough

credit because he always does the
dirty work and he's really good at it."
"We've been swimming and
scrimmaging a lot, so that's the over
all picture and it really helps our
team play, but we've also been focus
ing on defense a lot," sophomore
driver Sage Wright said. "When it
comes down to winning games, the
biggest factor is probably discipline
and also our confidence. |Head|
coach [John] Vargas gets us going at
practice and gets us to practice as
hard as we can so when you come to

the game, you're ready for any
thing."
Following the Davis win. Sun
day's game against at Pacific was the
rematch of an early season victory
for the Cardinal; Stanford won the
previous encounter, 20-11. in late
September.
Highlights this time around in
cluded freshman driver Alex Pulido
continuing his excellent rookie cam
paign with a hat trick. Stanford
showed substantial firepower as sen
ior two-meter attacker Michael

Bury also scored three goals. Drac
Wigo and junior utility Will Hindle-
Katel added to the cause, both scor
ing a pair.
"I feel that Alex Pulido deserves
a lot [of credit]." Drac Wigo said of
his teammate. "He's a freshman, and
he starts, and he's playing really well.
He doesn't make lots of mistakes,
and he scores when we need the
goals.
Stanford leapt out of the gates,
with the score at 5-2 after the first
period, and then capitalized on Pa
cific's defensive breakdown in the
second quarter to extend the lead to
9-2 at halftime. Again, the Cardinal
defense stood its ground and
stopped any chance of Pacific from
rallying as Stanford finished com
fortably ahead. 14-7.
Next on the Cardinal's schedule
are matches against UC-lrvine and
Santa Clara. Stanford will match up
against Irvine in a match played on
the road this Saturday.
