## Oh-leven gridiron glory 
### 
I am an optimist. Instead of looking for the
had in tough situations. I search for the
good. Although the Stanford football
team is on the verge of being eliminated from
bowl contention after losing to Washington
— their second bad loss in as many weeks —
there is reason for hope.
The cause? The Cardinal freshmen.
Last week. I wrote about the heralded
2(X)8 recruiting class. Ranked highly, they will
come to the Farm with great hype and expec
tations. Their predecessors faced the oppo
site: no fan expected much production from
the freshmen — or, for that matter, the entire
team — this year. And they have exceeded
expectations, some as starters, many as key
backups. They are part of a core group of
players that is ushering in a new age of Stan
ford football.
Eighteen freshmen joined the Cardinal
this year. Many are redshirting, but six are
making their presence felt. Let's start with
one whose recent impact is perhaps most sur
prising: cornerback-turned-running back
Corey Gatewood.
Gatewood came to Stanford as both a
wide receiver and a defensive back but was
made exclusively into a corner. He played
sparingly in the team's first eight games, reg
istering only two total tackles. But when in
juries began to deplete the running back
corps, coach Jim Harbaugh called on Gate
wood to become an emergency substitute.
The result? He rushed for 63 yards on five
carries against Washington on Saturday, in
cluding a beautiful 43-yard rush down the left
sideline.
Gatewood's success, though, was coupled
with disappointment: he fumbled on Wash
ington's 1-yard line, ending Stanford's best
scoring opportunity of the afternoon. And,

once junior and starter Anthony Kimble re
turns to the lineup. Gatewood might once
again find himself on the defensive side ot the
ball. But in a dire situation. Gatewood
stepped up and. in the process, personified
the Harbaugh ideal of striving to win by all
means necessary, no matter the circum
stances.
Perhaps the most impressive freshman is
Chike Amojoyi, who was profiled briefly last
week for also switching positions, from run
ning back to linebacker. An occasional
starter on the weak side, Amajoyi is coming
off two impressive games, in which he
amassed 15 total tackles, two sacks, three
tackles for a loss and an interception. He
seems destined to be a defensive fixture for
the Cardinal: his blitzing ability is already
outstanding, and he has the speed to roam
across the entire field in coverage.
Safety Taylor Skaufel has also seen his fair
share of action. He is the primary backup be
hind starting sophomores Bo McNally and
Austin Yancy at both free and strong safety.
He began his Cardinal career with four tack
les against UCLA, and against Oregon, the
best opponent Stanford has faced to date
(sorry, USC), Skaufel had 10 tackles, includ
ing five solo stops.
Owen Marecic has started all nine games
at fullback. Used'primarily for his blocking
(he only has five rushes and two receptions
on the year), he has paved the way for a num
ber of runners, including Jeremy Stewart.
Stewart began the year buried on the run
ning back depth chart, but after injuries to
Kimble, sophomore Toby Gerhart and senior
Jason Evans, Stewart was thrust into a more
prominent role. On the year, he has rushed
for 151 yards, including one score.
He led the team in rushing against
Oregon State — albeit, for a total of
16 yards — and as a kick returner,
he has averaged a solid 20 yards per
return.
Another key member of the re
turn team has been wideout Doug
Baldwin. Used primarily as a fourth
receiver. Baldwin has excelled as a
kick returner, averaging close to 24
yards a return.
Most stunning about the fresh
men's success is that the top recruits
coming in — kicker David Green,
tight end Kellen Kiilsgaard and de
fensive lineman Matt Masifilo —
are redshirting this year and have
yet to see the field. Stewart, Skaufel,
Gatewood and Marecic weren't
even ranked in the top 100 at their
positions by the recruiting service
Scout.com.
The young Cardinal athletes are
both the last remnants of Walt Har
ris's tenure and Harbaugh's first
building blocks for a new era of
Stanford football. They have al
ready beaten the learning curve —
the team has accomplished more in
nine games than many thought it
would all season.
Many surprising players — the
prime example being sophomore
quarterback Tavita Pritchard —
have helped them reach this
plateau. But no performance has
been more unexpected than that of
the freshmen, the unheralded re
cruiting class of 2007.
