Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actual
strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they could
beat the team below them.
Rank Last Week Comment
1. Ohio State 1 Allowed first home rushing touchdown vs. Wisconsin —
in the 1 Oth game of the season.
2. Oregon 3 Actually outgained by ASU, but 200 ground yards and
Dixon's four TDs made the difference.
3. LSU 2 Miles, Tigers can win the close ones. But if LSU is so good,
why are they all so close?
4. Oklahoma 4 Jumped ahead 35-0 on a darn good Texas A&M team.
Bradford: '08 Heisman favorite?
5. West Virginia 5 UConn visits in three weeks for Big East title. "D" has held
foes under 20 six straight games.
6. Kansas 16 Yeah, Nebraska's in free-fall, but 76 is quite a score! And
I suspend all disbelief. "D" is solid too.
7. Missouri 11 Pantsed a solid Colorado team. Three of top seven from Big
12. League suddenly looks legit.
8. Virginia Tech 12 Snuffed out any semblance of a Georgia Tech attack. ACC
favorites in my eyes.
9. USC 7 With the Dodgers hiring Torre and L.A. fans being notori
ously fickle, is USC now passe?
10. Michigan 6 Down 10 with seven minutes to go? No sweat for Hart,
Henne. OSU now for Rose Bowl.
11. Florida 9 The good: Tebow— 22-of-27. The bad: "D" has now
given up 20-plus eight straight weeks.
12. Boston College 8 Raise your hand if you saw this coming. After all the crazi
ness, familiar teams at the top.
13. Arizona State 10 Raise your hand if you saw this coming. LA schools are the
real tests left: win out and go Fiesta?
14. Georgia 14 Outgained and allowed 34 points in 0 "W" vs Troy. How
about those SEC defenses?
15. Alabama 13 No shame, no shame. Three losses by a combined 17
points. But there goes the SEC West.
16. Auburn 17 Quietly sporting the SEC's best defense. Florida win less
impressive by the week, though.
17. Texas 15 Top 5 nationally in talent, bottom sin motivation. VY's
title aside, Brown can't coach.
18. Tennessee 18 55-3 win vs. UL-Lafayette. Only 20 more points now until
Fulmer reaches monthly quota.
19. Wisconsin 21 Dominated statistically, but hung with Buckeyes for three
quarters. Next up, Michigan.
20. California 20 Longshore: 39 attempts and just 216 yards vs. Washing
ton State? That "0" has problems.
21. Connecticut 24 Ironically, it's a dismantling of Rutgers that shows the
world this year's Cinderellas for real.
22. Clemson 25 Scored 147 over last three, but BC, Wake Forest and South
Carolina to close season.
23. Hawaii 23 Want to guess the over-under when Washington visits on
December 2? 105?
24. Cincinnati NR Just two (close) losses, and two quality wins in Oregon
State and now South Florida.
25. Penn State NR Win ugly, but that first word is key. Also considered: Vir
ginia, Boise State, Kentucky.
