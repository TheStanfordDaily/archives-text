# Women's tennis gains valuable experience at ITA Indoors and ASU Invite
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team ended
its fall tournament season this past weekend
without a title but with something much more
valuable â€” match play.
At the 2007 Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion (ITA) National Indoor Championships in
Columbus, Ohio, junior Jessica Nguyen fell by
a score of 7-6(4), 5-7,6-1 to Cal's Susie Babos in
the second round.
The quarterfinal loss ended her run in per
haps one of the toughest tournaments of the
season, which featured the top 32 players in the
nation.
Despite her loss, Nguyen showed that she

can compete against the best.
"She had a pretty good performance be
cause she beat the top player from William and
Mary," head coach Lele Forood said. "She had
her chances against Babos with a triple set
point in the first set and lost in three. Babos just
won the [ITA] All-American [Championships]
a few weeks ago, so it was hardly a bad loss."
Indeed. Nguyen battled No. 2 Babos until
the bitter end. Nearly winning the first set,
Nguyen had a chance to steal the match from
the Babos, the 2006 NCAA singles champion.
Moreover, Nguyen was the only Cardinal
woman at the Indoors, a rare occurrence.
"It's unusual for us because we usually qual
ify more people," Forood said.
With her second appearance at the Indoors

in as many years, Nguyen figures to play a
prominent role in the Cardinal lineup this year.
Earlier this season, she won the singles title of
the ITA Northwest Regional Championships,
qualifying her for the national event.
"It's nice to see her hit the ball well there
and win at Regionals," Forood said. "Clearly,
she's coming back as one of the higher-ranked
players."
Across the country from Nguyen, senior
Whitney Deason and freshman Jennifer Yen
competed at the Arizona State University
(ASU)Thunderbird Invitational.
Deason, the third seed, won three of her
four singles matches over the weekend.
"Obviously Whitney's a senior, so she's ex
perienced," Forood said. "We just needed her

to get hack up to speed after not playing much
this summer, so we're getting her as many
matches as possible."
Yen advanced further than Deason in the
main draw, falling in the quarterfinals and
eventually winning two of her four singles
matches.
"Jennifer is in a different boat," Forood said.
"She's a freshman coming in. and we're trying
to get the freshmen as acclimated to college
matches as possible."
In doubles, Deason and Yen salvaged their
final match of the invite on Sunday with a 9-
8(2) win over Laila Abdala and Micaela Hein
