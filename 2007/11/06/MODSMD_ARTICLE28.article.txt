# First NCAA berth since 200 one win away
## Field hockey hosts Lock Haven in play-in game 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Solidifying its best season in years, Stanford field hockey
won the NorPac Tournament Championship this past Satur
day with a 3-1 win over archrival Cal.a team which had not lost
to Stanford since 2001. The Cardinal won its first conference
title in seven years and will now compete in the NCAA Tour
nament for time in as many years.
The win the team for a play-in game against North
east champion Lock Haven; the match will he
played 1 a.m. on Stanford's home field and will deter
mine which school goes on to the 16-team NCAA Tournament.
With Saturday's win over Cal, the Cardinal improved its
record to 12-7 overall.
After dropping behind 1-0 in the 16th minute. Stanford an
swered with a goal in the next two minutes and never looked
back, scoring in the 22nd minute on a goal by freshman Xan
the Travlos and securing the game with a score by senior Jess
Zutz in the 66th. For her efforts over the course of the tourna
ment, junior Bailey Richardson was named the competition's
Most Valuable Player.
"I'm just so proud of our team," head coach Lesley Irvine
told GoStanford.com. "Throughout the year, we felt we had
the ability to knock off great teams like California. Today
everything just came together. All 11 players were firing on all
cylinders, and that was great to see in a pressure situation."
"We played with so much passion and heart today. There
was no way we were going to lose," Travlos said to GoStan
ford.com.
With a conference championship now under their belts, the
Stanford players face an even bigger task as they take the field
today — making a run in the NCAA Tournament. However,
Stanford will not make it to the round of 16 without a win
against Lock Haven today.
Lock Haven comes into this afternoon's must-win game
with a lofty record of 17-5 overall and 7-0 in conference. They
have won thettj.ist nine games on the year and were champi
ons of the Nffffljleast Conference.
That saidslKlay's outcome will do little to change the re
markable season that the Cardinal has had under fifth-year
coach Lesley Irvine. Irvine was named the Coach of the Year in
the NorPac, and it seems as if the program — which had not
had a winning season in six years — has finally righted the ship.
As TYavlos said to GoStanford.com. "This is the start of
something new and very big."
