# Gas rises to $3 a gallon nationally
## 
### 
NEW YORK - Gasoline prices jumped
back above $3 a gallon at the pump Monday
even as concerns about the economy and in
creases in crude supplies sent oil prices
lower.
Retail gas prices have been slow to catch
up with soaring crude prices, which have
gained nearly 39 percent since late August
to a trading high of $%.24 on Thursday. Gas
prices only started rising steadily in mid-Oc
tober.
The national average price of a gallon of
gas rose 1.5 cents overnight to $3,004, and
has jumped almost 25 cents in three weeks,
according to AAA and the Oil Price Infor
mation Service.
The sharp jump in gas prices could con
tinue if oil keeps surging to new heights.
"The consumer has been relatively iso
lated from these prices," said Amanda
Kurzendoerfer, commodities analyst at
Summit Energy Services Inc. in Louisville,
Ky
But. she said, if oil prices don't retreat,

gas prices could reach $3.50 or $4 a gallon by
next summer.
