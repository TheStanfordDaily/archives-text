"We are extremely grateful
to Lee Annenberg for her gift,
and we are proud that such a
distinguished alumna has cho
sen to support these critical
areas of academic inquiry at
the Hoover Institution," Hen
nessy said. "I look forward to
monitoring the creative work
in the area of public policy that
I'm sure will develop over the
next few years as a result of
Lee Annenberg's generosity."
