# Google expands into mobile market with upcoming cell phone software
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO - Google Inc. wants
to become as influential in the mobile market
as it is on the Internet - and the online search
leader thinks it can do that without sticking
its prized brand on a cell phone.
The Mountain View-based company pro
vided the first glimpse at its mobile ambitions
Monday with the announcement of a free
software package scheduled to hit the market
during the second half of next year.
Ihe system, which will control an untold
number of cell phones, is designed to unify
the developers of mobile applications
around a common platform that makes it eas
ier and more enticing to surf the Weh on cell
phones.The new package is called "Android"
in tribute to a Silicon Valley startup that
Google acquired two years ago to steer its se
cretive project.
Google is hoping Android opens another

lucrative channel for peddling ads and servic
es to people when they're away from their
personal computers, supplementing the rev
enue already pouring into the company from
Internet advertising.
Contrary to reports that surfaced during
months of breathless speculation, Google
isn't making cell phones, nor does it plan to
put its name on the devices equipped with its
software. Instead.it will work with four man
ufacturers and 29 other companies that have
formed the Open Handset Alliance to help
launch Google's mobile software.
But Google Chief Executive Eric
Schmidt hinted the company might eventu
ally make its own phone powered by the
new software.
"We don't want to foreclose any options
in the future," Schmidt told reporters during
a Monday conference call.
