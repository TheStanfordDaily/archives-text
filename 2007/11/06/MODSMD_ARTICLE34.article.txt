# Research sheds light on diabetes

### VICTOR CRUZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine have discovered a protein
in the pancreas that may explain the
mechanisms of gestational diabetes,
a condition that affects four percent
of all pregnancies.
Gestational diabetes occurs in
women whose bodies cannot pro
duce enough insulin to keep up with
the body's increased need for the
hormone, according to Emeritus
Professor of Cardiovascular Medi
cine Gerald M. Reaven. Although
gestational diabetes is sometimes re
ferred to as a temporary case of dia
betes— sugar levels return to nor
mal after the baby is delivered — the
condition has lifelong implications
for both the mother and child.
"This study marks the first genet
ic model of gestational diabetes,"
said Developmental Biology post
doctoral researcher Satyajit Karnik.

the first author on the study. "Previ
ously. people hud to inject mice or
manipulate them another way."
The team discovered that ex
pressing the protein menin prevent
ed mice from producing enough in
sulin, a hormone the body uses to
break down sugar. This decrease in
insulin causes hyperglycemia — the
build-up of sugar in the blood — a
defining characteristic of gestational
diabetes.
Researchers used a number of
tools that allowed them to use mice
to explore the complex relationships
of the pregnancy hormones. The
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medi
cine was awarded this year to the cre
ators of one tool that the team used
— gene targeting.
"Because they become more in
sulin resistant during pregnancy,"
Reaven said, "[mothers] who devel
op gestational diabetes are more at
risk for developing diabetes later on
in life.Treating these conditions sub

stantially increases the chances of
having a good, healthy pregnancy."
Karnik envisioned future uses of
the research, such as developing ge
netic screening for gestational dia
betes and menin-based strategies to
treat diet or obesity induced forms of
diabetes.
He cautioned, however, that the
genetic model is from mice.
"It is not a definitive connection
between gestational diabetes in hu
mans." Karnik said. "But it gives us a
good idea of where to look."

volved in the study include postdoc
toral scholars Hainan Chen and
