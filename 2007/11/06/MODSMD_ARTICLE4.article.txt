"Peace in Palestine is an impera
tive," Hanan Ashwari told a packed
Kresge Auditorium last night in a
speech entitled "Palestine: Is Peace
Possible?"
"The essential first step toward a
resolution in Palestine is the libera
tion of Palestine from the shackles
of occupation," said Ashwari, a
Palestinian Christian activist.
"There is a real need for Israel to
stop being an occupier. Once Pales
tine is freed, then peace talks will be
viable."
Ashwari has won a number of
peace prizes, including the 2003
Sydney Peace Prize, and she was
nominated for the 2005 Nobel
Peace Prize. She also serves on mul
tiple international advisory boards,
including the World Bank Middle
Hast. Ashwari's visit was co-spon
sored by a number of Stanford or
ganizations, including Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI).
"A few weeks ago, another
speaker came to Stanford and pro
posed the one-state solution to the
Palestinian conflict," said Nabill
Idrisi '09, co-president of SCAI. "It
was definitely very interesting to
hear Ashwari defend her argument
for the two-state solution."
In her speech, Ashwari ex
pressed confidence that peace in
Palestine would be possible with di
rect political action and genuine
commitment from all international
and Palestinian parties.
However, Ashwari also outlined
certain obstacles that would have to
be overcome before peace talks
could occur, the first of which was
the Israeli occupation in Palestine.
She criticized the transformation
of Palestine into a "charity case
rather than a case of self-determina
tion and freedom." She affirmed
that the majority of Palestinians
"have been protective of their fun
damental rights and want to build a
state based on democracy and
