# Speaker talks peace in Palestine
## Students participate in "die-in," Peace Prize nominee speaks to capacity crowd MEDICAL SCHOOL 
### JOANNA XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Peace in Palestine is an impera
tive," Hanan Ashwari told a packed
Kresge Auditorium last night in a
speech entitled "Palestine: Is Peace
Possible?"
"The essential first step toward a
resolution in Palestine is the libera
tion of Palestine from the shackles
of occupation," said Ashwari, a
Palestinian Christian activist.
"There is a real need for Israel to
stop being an occupier. Once Pales
tine is freed, then peace talks will be
viable."
Ashwari has won a number of
peace prizes, including the 2003
Sydney Peace Prize, and she was
nominated for the 2005 Nobel
Peace Prize. She also serves on mul
tiple international advisory boards,
including the World Bank Middle
Hast. Ashwari's visit was co-spon
sored by a number of Stanford or
ganizations, including Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI).
"A few weeks ago, another
speaker came to Stanford and pro
posed the one-state solution to the
Palestinian conflict," said Nabill
Idrisi '09, co-president of SCAI. "It
was definitely very interesting to
hear Ashwari defend her argument
for the two-state solution."
In her speech, Ashwari ex
pressed confidence that peace in
Palestine would be possible with di
rect political action and genuine
commitment from all international
and Palestinian parties.
However, Ashwari also outlined
certain obstacles that would have to
be overcome before peace talks
could occur, the first of which was
the Israeli occupation in Palestine.
She criticized the transformation
of Palestine into a "charity case
rather than a case of self-determina
tion and freedom." She affirmed
that the majority of Palestinians
"have been protective of their fun
damental rights and want to build a
state based on democracy and

In addition, Ashwari referred to
the concrete structure being built in
Jerusalem as a "horrific wall that is
stealing our horizon and our land."
She also stressed the concept of
sharing Jerusalem among both
Palestinians and Israelis.
"All Palestinians should be able
to move through Jerusalem freely,"
she said. "Many different views of
Jerusalem exist, but we must keep
Jerusalem whole as one city for two
states."
A large portion of the audience
consisted of Bay Area Palestinian-
Americans and Arab-Americans
who were not affiliated with the
University.
"She's an articulate speaker and
i representative of the Palestinian
people." said Vivian Zelaya, a Pales
tinian-American from San Francis
co.
Certain students, however, ex
pressed a degree of doubt regarding
Ashwari's arguments.
"Overall, her speech was pretty
well-rounded, and 1 think she sug
gested a viable solution," said Fadl

I feel about the idea of Jerusalem
being the capital of two states."

wished Ashwari had been more spe
cific in her speech.
"If she stands by what she said
tonight, then she's a moderate who
will be key in bringing about a two
state solution," Gettinger said. "I
agree with 90 percent of what she
said, but she was also vague. She in
