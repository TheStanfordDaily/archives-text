## Ancient beast cloning near, scholar says Professor says extinct animal cloning is only 20-30 years away 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR WRITER 
Reproducing a baby wooly mammoth may be
possible in the years to come, said one of the world's
leading researchers of ancient DNA at a presenta
tion yesterday in the I listory Department. In a one
hour presentation before a small audience of faculty
and students, 1 lendrik Poinar of Canada's McMaster
University acknowledged that what was once seen as
nothing more than a pseudo-scientific pipedream re
served for science fiction could one day become re
ality.
Poinar claimed that new breakthroughs in the sci
ence of paleogenomics — the study of ancient DNA
extracted from preserved or fossilized specimens —
has unlocked a doorway to understanding and isolat
ing the DNA of ancient extinct species, to the extent
that clones of long-ago species such as wooly mam
moths and saber tooth tigers may one day be pro
duced.
"The reality is it will happen," Poinar said con
cerning the cloning of extinct species. "Twenty to 30
years is the span people are talking about."
Poinar's research over the last several years has
yielded unprecedented isolation and sequencing of
the genomes of extinct species, particularly in an
cient human ancestors and the mammoth. For the
latter species, Poinar. along with his research teams,
has collected thousands of samples of preserved
mammoth DNA taken from specimens frozen in the
permafrost of Siberia, the Yukon and elsewhere. He
claimed that, in general, colder climates offer re
searchers a better chance of finding preserved DNA
among fossil specimens.
"If you want to get nuclear DNA," he said, "you
have to go north."
Poinar focused the majority of his presentation
on addressing his work in locating and isolating
mammoth DNA. In one research expedition to
Siberia, he and his team analyzed the DNA of nu
merous mammoth specimens taken from a shelf of
permafrost that had been preserved by Siberian re
searchers in an "ice cave" formerly used to store So
viet nuclear weapons.
"Here you have the blood of a 60.000-vear-old
mammoth squirting out," Poinar said.
"It's really quite amazing."
He then went on to explain that
the specimens collected from the
Siberian site yielded approximately
14 million base-pairs of mammoth
DNA in the course of about five
hours.
Poinar's method of isolating and,
in some cases, reconstructing ancient
DNA utilizes a method of sequencing
in which all of the DNA samples pres
ent in a specific specimen, from ani
mal to fungal and bacterial, are sepa
rated out and analyzed by a comput
erized system. With this type of se
quencing available, he claimed, real
paleogenomic breakthroughs should
be right around the corner.
With regards to the cloning issue,
Poinar referred back to one of his
most widely known media experi
ences, in which Katie Couric inter
viewed him alongside Steven Spiel

herg for "TheToday Show" to address
the question of whether the genomic
methods used to produce clones of di
nosaurs in the sci-fi blockbuster
"Jurassic Park" could ever be used to
reproduce extinct animals in real life.
As more time passes, advances in pa
leogenomic research are bringing sci
ence fiction closer to reality.
Even so. Poinar was hesitant to
praise the potential benefits of scien
tists taking such steps to reproduce
extinct species.
"There's a huge moral issue of
whether you should do it,"he said,
and he added that the last thing scien
tists want is to let the reproduction of
extinct species become "a scapegoat
for the current lack of biodiversity" in
the earth's ecosystems, of which hu
mans are largely to blame.
"I think theoretically it can hap
pen. but will it happen is really the
question," he said.
Poinar also added that completely
reconstructing the genomes of ex
tinct species requires that those
species have a close living example
available for borrowing and compar
ison. In that sense, mammoths, ex

tinct cats and human ancestors would
be the easiest genomes to recreate
given the availability of living de
scendants.
Actual efforts to reproduce ex
tinct living organisms from their
DNA are currently being pursued by
other researchers. Many Japanese
scientists have also been scouring the
permafrost of North America, but in
search of preserved mammoth sperm
for the purpose of producing an off
spring with a female Asian elephant
through in vitro fertilization.
Aside from that, one previously
extinct organism — the WIS influen
za virus which killed approximately
40 million people worldwide — has
successfully been reproduced
through its genome.
Of this experiment, Poinar said he
was "flabbergasted" that so little out
cry was made against reproducing a
pandemic virus compared to the out
rage generated by his research, which
could do no more than reproduce a
babv wooly mammoth.
