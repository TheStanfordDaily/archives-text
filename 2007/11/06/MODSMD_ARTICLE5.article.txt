## Ancient beast cloning near, scholar says Professor says extinct animal cloning is only 20-30 years away 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR WRITER 
Reproducing a baby wooly mammoth may be
possible in the years to come, said one of the world's
leading researchers of ancient DNA at a presenta
tion yesterday in the I listory Department. In a one
hour presentation before a small audience of faculty
and students, 1 lendrik Poinar of Canada's McMaster
University acknowledged that what was once seen as
nothing more than a pseudo-scientific pipedream re
served for science fiction could one day become re
ality.
Poinar claimed that new breakthroughs in the sci
ence of paleogenomics — the study of ancient DNA
extracted from preserved or fossilized specimens —
has unlocked a doorway to understanding and isolat
ing the DNA of ancient extinct species, to the extent
that clones of long-ago species such as wooly mam
moths and saber tooth tigers may one day be pro
duced.
"The reality is it will happen," Poinar said con
cerning the cloning of extinct species. "Twenty to 30
years is the span people are talking about."
Poinar's research over the last several years has
yielded unprecedented isolation and sequencing of
the genomes of extinct species, particularly in an
cient human ancestors and the mammoth. For the
latter species, Poinar. along with his research teams,
has collected thousands of samples of preserved
mammoth DNA taken from specimens frozen in the
permafrost of Siberia, the Yukon and elsewhere. He
claimed that, in general, colder climates offer re
searchers a better chance of finding preserved DNA
among fossil specimens.
"If you want to get nuclear DNA," he said, "you
have to go north."
Poinar focused the majority of his presentation
on addressing his work in locating and isolating
mammoth DNA. In one research expedition to
Siberia, he and his team analyzed the DNA of nu
merous mammoth specimens taken from a shelf of
permafrost that had been preserved by Siberian re
searchers in an "ice cave" formerly used to store So
viet nuclear weapons.
