gon to Band: stay away
after spotted owl show
The University of Oregon has
asked the Stanford Department of
Athletics to leave the Stanford Band
at home next year when the Cardinal
meets the Oregon Ducks in Autzen
Stadium.
Oregon Athletic Director Bill
Byrne made the request in a Nov. 2
letter to Acting Athletics Director
Alan Cummings. Cummings had sus
pended the Band October 29 for one
game in response to a controversial
half-time show in Eugene parodying
Oregon's spotted owl debate. In his
letter. Byrne described the perform
ance as "insensitive" and lacking
"understanding of the social and eco
nomic climate in Oregon."
"Apparently the young people in
the Band do not understand that los
ing anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000
jobs in the western part of Oregon is
extremely traumatic for the people
here." Byrne wrote. The spotted owl
is an endangered species, and efforts
to maintain its habitat may lead to
widespread layoffs in Oregon's tim
ber industry.
Cummings was noncommittal
yesterday about how he would re
spond to the request.
But complying with the request
may not be difficult. Band member
Jess Dorogusker, a sophomore, said
that the Band does not usually travel
to Oregon for football games. Be
fore last year, the last time the Band
played at Oregon was 1973, he said.
Byrne opened his letter to Cum
mings with a report on damages to
Autzen Stadium that Oregon offi
cials blame on the Band. The dam
ages. costing $113. include two four
foot black paint rings and a 12-inch
pool of spilled enamel paint on the
field's artificial turf. Byrne also wrote
that the Band placed tape on three
large Pac-10 Conference school
signs.
Band Public Relations director
Ben Myers, a junior, said last night
that the Band admits responsibility
for some stadium damages and is
willing to pay Oregon for them.
"It's the proper thing to do." he
said, adding that the responsible
members had been rebuked.
