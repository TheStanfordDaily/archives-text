## Sociology prof. details gender 'orgasm gap'

e've all heard that women in the workforce make
only 75 cents for every dollar earned by men. 'ITiis
factoid, long a rallying cry for women's rights ac-
Itivists. may be trumped by a statistic uncovered by new re
search out of Stanford's sociology department: in the college
hookup scene, men are having orgasms at two and
a half times the rate of their female partners. .
"The orgasm gap is worse than the sex gap in
pay." says Sociology Prof. Paula England. /

I \ j \ England conducted an ex- \
\ ) tensive online sex survey of V,
over 4000 undergraduates at
Stanford, the University of Ari
zona, Indiana University, UC-Santa Barbara and
SUN Y-Stony Brook. When male and female college students
hook up, she found. 44 percent of men orgasm — compared
to only 19 percent of their female partners.
What's behind the orgasm gap?
In the survey, students reported on their
/ last hookup — anything from kissing to
/ \ oral and manual sex to intercourse.
/ \ The three kinds of activities were
j \ ) about equally likely. But when it
V J came to purely oral sex — A
about 16 percent of the time— &
women were much more likely to
©dish it out than receive it.
In England's survey, if a heterosexual
hookup included oral sex. but not intercourse,
the oral sex was reciprocal less than 40 percent of
the time. In 45 percent of the cases, men were the
only ones on the receiving end. and women were the sole re
cipients just 16 percent of the time.
Are men who don't reciprocate callous boors ,
who don't care about their partner's pleasure? Sf.
Probably not, England found. Women reported /
being more reluctant to receive oral sex or per- 1 ' O
forming oral sex without payback because they \
thought it was expected.
In addition, men often didn't know if their female
partner had had an orgasm. England compared men
and women's reports of the woman's orgasm in heterosex
ual hookups. The women themselves reported an orgasm 25
percent of the time, while the men thought their partners or
gasmed 60 percent of the time.

Are women wantonly faking their
orgasms? Or are men just inept?
If it's male ineptitude driving the
orgasm gap. women having sex
with women should be immune to
the problem. Consequently, the
rates of orgasm in lesbian hookups
should be much higher than in

straight hookups. This idea is born out to some degree.
Tiie women in England's survey who reported on a
same-sex hookup that included oral sex had an or
gasm 62 percent of the time, while women reporting
\ on an opposite sex hookup of the same variety had
an orgasm just 39 percent of the time.
112 Short of becoming lesbians, women can increase
J their odds of having orgasms by having sex in the
context of a relationship. According to the England
survey, if a woman has intercourse in a first-time hookup,
her chances of having an orgasm are less than 30 percent, but
if she has intercourse in the context of a relationship, her odds
of reaching orgasm shoot to over 60 percent.

But even within rela
tionship sex,
women's orgasms are
trailing men's. When
couples in a hetero
sexual relationship
have intercourse but
not oral sex, the
man's odds of reach-

ing orgasm are 89 percent compared to the
woman's 60 percent.
Could it he that female orgasms are just physi- / "X
ologically harder to produce? Although Eng- 1 C> \
land's data can't rule this out, she doesn't think V, S
it's the main reason for the orgasm gap.
Cultural attitudes toward male and female sexuality seem to
be a better explanation. Of England's subjects, 97 percent of
men have masturbated to orgasm, but only 60 percent of
women have done the same. Men are no strangers to their
own orgasms, but women may not even know how their bod
ies work.
To close the gap, societal attitudes need to shift toward valu
ing female pleasure in hookups and enabling women to un
derstand their own sexual response.
In addition to "Take Back the Night"
marches, maybe college campuses /
should host " lake Back the Or- ( 0 /
