## Making the grade Student Web site ranks law firms according to diversity 
### MIKE DING 
Ast week, Stanford students turned the tables on the
nation's law firms. As part of a larger effort to in
crease diversity, students are assigning grades to
their prospective employers — and in their eyes, it's
only GPA that matters.

Law students Andrew Canter '08 and Craig Segall "09 are the
founders of Building a "Better Legal Profession (BBLP), a group that
works to grade individual law firms based on ethnic diversity, gender bal
ance. LGBT representation, as well as the number of billable hours they re
quire.

"In late 2006. Craig saw that the billable hour in large law firms was be
coming a big problem,"said Canter/'Law firms were expecting attorneys to work
more and more billable hours, which made it harder for people to have time for
themselves — to start families. It also made it harder for attorneys to fit in pro bono
work."

Canter said that law firms had become too focused on the bottom line, foregoing
their responsibilities to the community in favor of greater profits.
"As students at a prestigious law school, we have a choice of where we work." he
said. "We can vote with our feet by going to organizations that do better on these issues, to
organizations that are pushing back and letting us do fewer billable hours and focus on the

community."
In the summer of 2007. the group realized that it could apply Stanford Law School's mar
ket power to more than just the issue of billable hours.
"There was a lot of data out there on diversity." he said. "The general idea is that we have
market power and can exercise it for the benefit of our professions."
BBLP receives its data from the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), which
serves to promote an exchange of information between law schools and firms.
Ilieir website, which debuted only a week ago, received over 73.000 hits on its first
day.

"Since day one, we've gotten all sorts of responses from all over the country and
the world — from New Zealand to Germany to the United Kingdom," he said.
As for feedback from firms, Canter said that reactions have been mostly positive.
"A lot of attorneys are happy to see what we're doing because the firms at the top
can use our rankings as a sign of accomplishment,"he said. "A couple of firms re
quested to reprint it to send to incoming interns and attorneys, or to put it on
their website."

I lowever, some firms emphasized that it was important to understand
the challenges that firms face when hiring.
"A common argument I hear back is that there aren't enough minorities
in the law school pipeline that want to go to the large law firms," he said.

They say.'Well, we're trying very hard, but we haven't been success
ful yet.'"
Still other firms are critical of the fact that BBLPonly has data
for one year.

"This is a direction we want to expand in," Canter
said. "Many firms would like to sec multiple year data he
cause that's important. Right now. we have an accurate
snapshot, but it's not a complete picture.The advantage to
having numbers over multiple years is that we can see

which firms are successful in meeting certain ideals."
In addition to including data from earlier years. Can
ter said that their rankings would try to incorporate
"more interesting metrics," such as hourly wages
and turnover rate.

ne also nopes to see increased cooperation
from universities.
"Stanford hires lots of big law firms to do a
lot of its legal work "he said. "It would be good
and consistent with Stanford's mission if it took
into account our criteria when consulting law
firms. Universities are natural allies in this ef
fort because they already share similar ideals:
diversity, community involvement, and reason
able work hours."
