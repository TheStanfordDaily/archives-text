Pakistani judge urges revolt
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan — Pakistan's
deposed chief justice called on lawyers
TUesday to revolt against President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf's imposition of emer
gency rule and a crackdown on the oppo
sition that has left thousands under arrest.
Ilie government considered a delay in
parliamentary elections despite Western
demands they be held on schedule in Jan
uary to bring democracy to a nuclear
armed country dogged by political uncer
tainty and rising Islamic militancv.

Fragile security in the northwest
cited by officials as a reason for the sus
pension of the constitution — deteriorat
ed further as pro-Taliban militants seized
a town from outnumbered security forces.
While Musharraf says emergency pow
ers are needed so the government can bet
ter fight Islamic extremists, his crackdown
has been aimed at lawyers and liberal po
litical activists opposing his rule. The
Supreme Court, in particular, had chipped
away at his powers this year.
Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed
Chaudhry. a figurehead for the resistance,
has been under house arrest since Satur

day night. But he managed to address
hundreds of lawyers using a cell phone
from his Islamabad residence, which he
said was surrounded by security forces.
"Go to every corner of Pakistan and
give the message that this is the time to
sacrifice." (Tiaudhry said over loudspeak
ers."Don't be afraid. God will help us and
the day will come when you'll see the con
stitution supreme and no dictatorship for
a long time."
Attorneys gathered at the Islamabad Bar
Association cheered.
"Chaudhry! Chaudhry!" they chanted.
"Musharraf is a criminal! We will not ac

cept uniforms or bullets!"
Moments later, mobile phone service cut
off in Islamabad, but Chaudhry's message
had already been recorded as an MP3 file.
It spread swiftly, and local TV stations
aired it via satellite.
Mukasey nomination sent to Senate
WASHINGTON — Michael Mukasey's
nomination as the nation's next attorney
general was sent to the full Senate on
Tuesday as a vehicle for debate over
the legality of the Bush administra
tion's interrogation techniques for
terrorism suspects.
The retired federal judge was ex
pected to win confirmation easily by
the end of next week, but not with
out significant floor discussion in
spired by his refusal to say that wa
terboarding amounts to illegal tor
ture.
"If he can't say no to torture, we
say no to Mukasey," read a letter
sent out by Friends for Marry Reid,
the Senate majority leader.
Mukasey's comments on torture
rankled senators of both parties, but
the nominee averted a rebellion by
promising to enforce any law Con
gress passes outlawing the practice
— or quit the post if President Bush
ignores his legal advice.
That was good enough for all nine
Republicans and two Democrats on
the !9-member Senate Judiciary

Committee who voted to send the
nomination to the full Senate for
confirmation.
Officials in both parties predicted
Tuesday that Mukasey would win
more than the 60 votes required to
head off a filibuster. But before any
more votes are cast on the matter, a
full-blown floor debate was expect
ed about waterboarding, a brutal in
terrogation method that creates the
sensation of drowning and which is
banned by domestic law and interna
tional treaties.
Feinstein. D-Calif., said her vote
for Mukasey's confirmation came
down in part to practicality. If
Mukasey's nomination were killed,
she said, hush would install an act
ing attorney general not subject to
Senate confirmation and make re
cess appointments to fill nearly a
dozen other empty jobs at the top of
Justice.
"I don't believe a leaderless de
partment is in the best interests of
the American people or of the de
partment itself." Feinstein said.
Mush, she added, "appointed this
man because he believes he is main
stream."
