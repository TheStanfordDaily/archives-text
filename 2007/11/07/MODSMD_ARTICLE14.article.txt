## Editorial Board Poor reception for Stanford's field hockey champions 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, just a few
blocks away from the football stadi
um, a more triumphant Cardinal ath
letic spectacle was unfolding. After a strong
season, the women's varsity field hockey
team scored a 3-1 upset victory over Cal in
the NorPac conference championship game,
avenging last year's 3-1 defeat at the hands
of the same Cal squad. The game featured
an enthusiastic Cal crowd nearly as big as
the home team's and a thrilling comeback
for the Card. What was conspicuously lack
ing was more significant: any sort of institu
tional support from other Stanford organi
zations that could give the team the recogni
tion it deserves.
A small and vibrant Stanford crowd did
turn out for the game, including a few under
grads wearing their trademark Red Zone
and Cal Sucks shirts â€” some were undoubt
edly on their way to the football game, which
started around halftime of the field hockey
championship. Others were there to support
their friends and roommates on the team.
Most of the crowd, however, consisted of
families of the players and local residents,
including one decked out in a homemade
tree mascot costume. She said she had tried
contacting the "real" Stanford Tree to get
him to appear at the game, but he never re
sponded.
Absent from the festivities were the
Band or Dollies, busy with preparations for
the bigger game at Stanford Stadium an
hour later.The Band (or even a small contin

gent) could have played at the field hockey
game and then rushed over to the stadium
for the second quarter of the football game.
They didn't show, so each of Stanford's goals
in the hockey match was greeted not by a
rousing chorus of "All Right Now" that
would have shamed the Cal crowd into si
lence. but by self-coordinated cheers by the
few fans in the stands willing to make some
noise. To the Band's credit, it has rallied at
other field hockey games this season, as well
as rugby,sailing,and ice hockey events in the
last few years. Yet for this critical champi
onship match, the regular season football
game next door took precedence.
This newspaper must also bear blame for
the utter lack of coverage of the game in
Monday's issue. The sports section covered
the women's basketball exhibition game
over the weekend and previewed the men's
exhibition game, but failed to cover the field
hockey championship match. Particularly
for a smaller ticket sport with less of a fan
following, coverage in The Daily is essential
to publicize important wins and drum up
support for upcoming games. An article did
appear yesterday, but a write-up three days
after the fact was little solace to the under
appreciated field hockey team. Yesterdays
play-in victory against Lock Haven assured
the team a spot in the NCAA Tournament
and points in the Director's Cup standings,
but drew a much smaller crowd than Satur-
