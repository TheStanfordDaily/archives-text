## Obama's last chance Baimel 
### 
Inside the bubble of college campuses.
Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has
enormous, almost messianic support.
Outside of these institutions, Democratic
primary voters are far more skeptical. De
spite adulatory, positive media coverage,
the real world has not bought the Obama
rhetoric in the way that college students
have. Obama trails Senator Hillary Clinton
(D-NY), a far more conventional candi
date. by 20 points or more in all the early
primary states besides lowa.
Back in January of this year. Obama got
the jump on Clinton and announced his
candidacy before she did.This put the Clin
ton campaign off-balance, and Hillary hur
riedly announced that she was running for
president a few days later, during a low
point in the media cycle. That was probably
the last time Obama was in control of the
tone and direction of the race to the Demo
cratic nomination. It has been all Clinton
ever since.
What is remarkable about this Democ
ratic presidential race is how stable it has
been. For all of the talk of "electability" and
"high negatives," Hillary Clinton has been
in control of the race since March. In Feb
ruary. her national poll ratings reached 40
percent, and most surveys now show her in
the high-40s range. Obama sits around 25
percent by most reliable indicators and has
not significantly budged in months. Former
Senator John Edwards (D-NC) can't break
15 percent. Edwards' failure to move up is
certainly understandable — he is highly
belligerent, panders to the left and doesn't
come across as a credible Commander-in-
Chief. Obama's inability to improve his poll
numbers, however, is far more interesting.
The problem might lie with his message.
His talk of the "politics of hope" and being
a "post-political president" has earned him
a messianic following among college stu
dents but has inspired few other demo
graphics. His ideas are compelling, but
would be far more convincing if he were
running as an independent; his talk ot
bringing people together rings hollow as
long as he's running as a Democrat and ad
vocating policies that Republicans are un
likely to support. He has kept pace with
Clinton in terms of fund-raising and draws
huge crowds wherever he goes, but he has
n't been able to turn all that money and at
tention into political support. Even as his
name recognition increases, his poll num
bers haven't moved.
Despite months of saturation coverage,
if Obama's candidacy and message have
not caught fire by now. there is little chance
for a surge of support before the start of the
lowa caucuses. Despite an initial boost in
the polls, his campaign has been stagnant

for months. Most forays into Clinton terri
tory, such as announcing that he would uni
laterally bomb Pakistan if he saw the need,
were ridiculed by both the Clinton camp
and most media commentators. Clearly,
certain things in Obama's campaign need
to change if he's going to make up a 20-
point gap in the polls. Obama for President,
as it is now. will not win lowa-New Hamp
shire-South Carolina, and the charismatic
Senator will be left to reject a VP invitation
from Clinton (which he will).
Obama's positions are quite different
from Edwards' and Clinton's, and they
can't be changed now. Radically altering
course would be tantamount to admitting
that his message has failed to sway voters.
Simply attacking Clinton, which Edwards
scorns to think is his ticket to winning lowa,
will not work.The Clinton campaign has al
ready proved successful at asking, "What
happened to the politics of hope?"
Obama needs to tweak his message. He
needs to run as a conventional Democrat,
interested in advancing Democratic ideas
and values once in the White House. The
talk of the "politics of hope" means much
less to the working class than it does to ide
alistic college students. Obama needs to put
being a Democrat above being non-parti
san; otherwise, how can Democrats trust
him not to pander to the right in the inter
est of building consensus?
Obama also needs to present himself as
a credible Commander-in-Chief. Even John
F. Kennedy — who had more Senatorial
experience when he ran than Obama has
now — out-hawked Nixon on the Soviet
"missile gap" issue. While most Americans
oppose the Iraq War. Obama has to be as
sertive on other issues such as Iran. Pak
istan and Venezuela. Agreeing to meet with
the leaders of hostile nations without pre
conditions. like he has promised, certainly
wouldn't go over well in the general elec
tion. If someone like Senator John McCain
(R-Ariz.). with his Vietnam service and
decades of experience, wins the Republican
nomination, he could easily draw a contrast
between himself and Obama on national
security issues. This is the same problem
Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) faced in
2004. Even Democrats care about national
