# The
						Lowly Interns
## All the news that's fit to print entertain 
### 
I'm very surprised by how frequently "the
news" is circulated as a conversation
topic in Washington.
I don't mean the content of the news. I
mean the news outlets themselves — every
thing from the various TV news anchors, the
political infighting between reporters, the
bias that a given paper seems to be showing,
the disposition of a particular editor, the
drama between the Post and the Times and
so on.
ITie news agencies are big players in
Washington. DC. The editor-in-chief of The
New York Times, for example, has more in
fluence and sway than most cabinet officials
and almost certainly more than any one
member of Congress. I work at a bipartisan
national security and defense think tank, the
Center for a New American Security
(CNAS), and organizations like mine live
and breathe the news. The more news men
tions you get. the more influential people
take you to be.
I was surprised to learn that our manage
ment allows staff members to use a signifi
cant portion of their time to do whatever
they want, and that many of them use that
time to write op-eds that they then send out
to dozens of publications, hoping to get print

ed (with a pretty high success rate).
Most people have a love-hate relation
ship with the news outlets. As much as we de
pend on them for news, we also scorn them
for the tabloidization of the media, especial
ly the TV media. It's sad to imagine that most
Americans get news from TV programs,
which with few exceptions suffer from the
"corporate problem."
Because of the massive profits available
in TV programs. TV news outlets have be
come less journalistic and more business-ori
ented. In the business-oriented model, it's all
about getting more viewers.This is why CNN.
MSNBC and FOX spend so much time cov
ering Michael Jackson. Anna Nicole Smith
and O.J. Simpson.
This summer I spent one day watching the
various news anchors that MSNBC" had in a
given weekday. I noticed that other than

their big afternoon stars, every single anchor
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. was a dazzingly gor
geous superniodel-esque woman. Not an ex
aggeration. Every single one.
So what do we do. then? Do we just resign
ourselves to the fact that a tabloid media is
here to stay, and the average American will
have to continue watching mug shots of
Lindsay Lohan forever?
Let me pose a wild idea: maybe we don't
want to stop the media's tabloidization.
I think there's a very big possibility that
this process isn't a universal tabloidization as
much as it is a specialization. I think that
news outlets — be they print, radio, televi
sion. or internet — are becoming more spe
cific and tuned to a certain topic and
audience.
In a specialized news world,existing trends
would further individualize. Right now, big
city papers like The New York Times or Tlie
Los Angeles l imes are national papers with
nationwide circulation,carrying issues related
to the federal government and foreign affairs.
Morning talk radio shows are for the people
who want a casual mix of news and commen
tary (however biased) for the dav. Hie info-
