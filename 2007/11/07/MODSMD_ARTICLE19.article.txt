## Remember, remember this fifth of November

The Oxford evening shone brightly with
the glare of bonfires and the explo

a personal campaign stop to a corporate
connected and well-off portion of the can
didate's constituency. That $4.2 million

came from 37.000 different individuals. It
said loudly and clearly, without hesitation
or misgivings, that we. the American peo

a Congress in which the only difference be
