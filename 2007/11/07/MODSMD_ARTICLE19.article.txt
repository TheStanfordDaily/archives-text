## Remember, remember this fifth of November 
### 
The Oxford evening shone brightly with
the glare of bonfires and the explo
sions of fireworks being set off by exu
berant Brits to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day,
but my attention was riveted back across the
pond to the birth of America's very own fifth
of November.
During the 24 hours comprising Nov. 5.
2007, a grassroots fundraising campaign
started by a single 37-year-old music pro
moter from Miami managed to raise $4.2
million dollars for the Presidential cam
paign of Representative Ron Paul (R-
Texas).

$4.2 million. That amount bypasses all
other single day fundraising records for
anyone in the Republican Party. That
amount demolishes the single day online
donation record held previously (a paltry
$1 million). But, most importantly, that
amount sent a message — a whole new
kind of message.
That $4.2 million didn't come from a
$l,5()0-a-plate private dinner with the can
didate. Nor did that $4.2 million come from
a personal campaign stop to a corporate
connected and well-off portion of the can
didate's constituency. That $4.2 million

came from 37.000 different individuals. It
said loudly and clearly, without hesitation
or misgivings, that we. the American peo
ple. have had enough and that we will he
heard.

America, as a nation, is sick and tired of
an executive that extends its hand well be
yond its Constitutional limit into the homes
and lives of the citi/cns it has sworn to de
fend from such action. It is sick and tired of
a Congress in which the only difference be
tween the two parties sitting on either side of
the aisle is which interest group is
signing their campaign checks. It is
sick and tired of a government that
has become so gargantuan and
slovenly that it has lost sight of the
ideals which founded this country
and made it great, choosing instead
to focus on re-election funds and the
growth of personal power-bases.
Whose fault is this? Who let this
country fall into this dishonorable
shell of what it once stood for?
Sure, it is easy to blame the govern
ment. In fact, that's probably most
accurate. But if we are looking for
the true root cause of this disease,
we must turn the mirror on our
selves.
Apathy is a poison. It begins in
nocently enough, with the enjoy
ment of luxury and the implicit as
sumption that if everything is going
well now. why on earth wouldn't it
continue doing so in the vears to

come? But from there it spreads. Be
fore you know it. we are where we
are. And worst of all? Nobody seems
to care.
The capacity to snap out of this
political coma was given new life
two days ago by the explosion of
the Ron Paul money bomb. This
modern "gunpowder treason' has
served to shake the foundations not
of Parliament but of the political
fortress the American government
has built to protect itself from the
people. It is now up to the rest of
America to join the fight and exer
cise their Constitutionally protect
ed influence.
I'm not here to plug Ron Paul.
I'm not here to tell you to vote for a
war or against national healthcare,
to promote Christian values or em
brace amnesty for illegals. Those de
cisions are your own to make. What
1 am here to call your attention to is
the fact that change is possible and
that we not only can. but that we
must work for it before it is too late.
So. America, remember, remem
ber this fifth of November, this Ron
Paul fundraising plot. These 37.000

donors have reminded America of
that which seems long forgotten —
that this government is one that
must be of the people, by the people
and for the people.
President John Quincy Adams
once said that one should "always
vote for principle, though you may
vote alone, and you may cherish
the sweetest reflection that your
vote is never lost." Never forget
that you, as an American, hold the
highest power over your govern
ment. You alone can enact change
and you alone can make a differ
ence in the way the government of
this country acts. May this fifth of
November serve as proof for that
assertion and may Americans pick
up the banner of freedom hoisted
by the Ron Paul camp and press
forward — the time is long over
due to remind this government
whom they answer to.
