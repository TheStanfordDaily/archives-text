As their friends and relatives back home
endured the fourth day of emergency rule,
Pakistani students at Stanford took to White
Plaza yesterday to protest Gen. Pervez
Musharraf's self-coup,condemning the Pak
istani president's declaration of emergency
rule as unlawful and illegitimate.
"It is an illegal and unconstitutional deci
sion and an attempt by a military dictator to
continue his illegal and unconstitutional
rule," read fliers the protesters handed out to
passers-by. "This declaration of a state of
emergency must be universally condemned
and the generals in Pakistan must end their
stranglehold on the country."
Ilie state of emergency began on Satur
day, after the president suspended the Con
stitution. dissolved the Supreme Court and
silenced privately owned media outlets. Sub

sequent protests have led to the arrest and
detainment of thousands of lawyers, activists
and opposition politicians, while much of the
county remains in the dark because of the
press crackdown.
"People there can't speak out or do any
thing," said Aamir Farooq, a fourth-year
Ph.D student in mechanical engineering.
Standing in the middle of White Plaza hold
ing a fluorescent sign denouncing Mushar
raf, Farooq said it was up to those who had
the freedom to speak out to do so.
"Nobody can organize, there are bans on
rallies," he said. "It's just a mess right now."
Farooq and his fellow Pakistanis at Stan
ford said their demands were simple: end the
state of emergency and give back basic
rights. They have called on Musharraf to re
store the 1973 Constitution, reinstate Chief
Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and the Supreme
