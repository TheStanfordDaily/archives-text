# Pakistani students protest martial law
## Day Five of Musharraf's emergency rule 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As their friends and relatives back home
endured the fourth day of emergency rule,
Pakistani students at Stanford took to White
Plaza yesterday to protest Gen. Pervez
Musharraf's self-coup,condemning the Pak
istani president's declaration of emergency
rule as unlawful and illegitimate.
"It is an illegal and unconstitutional deci
sion and an attempt by a military dictator to
continue his illegal and unconstitutional
rule," read fliers the protesters handed out to
passers-by. "This declaration of a state of
emergency must be universally condemned
and the generals in Pakistan must end their
stranglehold on the country."
Ilie state of emergency began on Satur
day, after the president suspended the Con
stitution. dissolved the Supreme Court and
silenced privately owned media outlets. Sub

sequent protests have led to the arrest and
detainment of thousands of lawyers, activists
and opposition politicians, while much of the
county remains in the dark because of the
press crackdown.
"People there can't speak out or do any
thing," said Aamir Farooq, a fourth-year
Ph.D student in mechanical engineering.
Standing in the middle of White Plaza hold
ing a fluorescent sign denouncing Mushar
raf, Farooq said it was up to those who had
the freedom to speak out to do so.
"Nobody can organize, there are bans on
rallies," he said. "It's just a mess right now."
Farooq and his fellow Pakistanis at Stan
ford said their demands were simple: end the
state of emergency and give back basic
rights. They have called on Musharraf to re
store the 1973 Constitution, reinstate Chief
Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and the Supreme

As part of an ongoing campus protest of Gen. Pervez Musharraf's "illegal and unconstitutional" declaration of martial law in Pakistan, students
participants demonstrated with posters and handed out fliers in White Plaza on Monday.
Court, revoke restrictions on press
freedoms and release political pris
oners.
Chaudhrv, under house arrest
after being fired on Saturday, called
on lawyers in the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad yesterday to "rise up and
restore the Constitution," according
to reports. The chief justice, a cham
pion of the opposition against
Musharraf, had been reinstated this
summer following a previous ousting
by Musharraf in the spring.
There are roughly 50 Pakistani
students at Stanford, Farooq said,
adding that those opposed to
Musharraf's seizure of emergency
power planned to protest through
out the week. The official student

group. Pakistanis At Stanford, has
yet to offer a position on the situa
tion, but a candlelight vigil is planned
for Thursday night in Old Union. A
larger rally, involving Pakistanis
from throughout the region, is set for
San Francisco this weekend.
Pakistan's information minister
said yesterday that the emergency
rule would only last for a short time,
while government officials offered
conflicting views on whether elec
tions planned for January would con
tinue as scheduled.
"It seems like the elections can be
postponed forever," said Farooq,
adding that he hoped the U.S. gov
ernment would pressure Musharraf
to end emergency rule.
President George W. Bush urged
Musharraf to do just that on Mon
day, while Condoleezza Rice hinted
that American aid. which has totaled
over $10 billion since 2001. could be
cut. But the long-term political solu

tion needs to come from within Pak
istan itself, said Ali Liaqat "08.
" Iliere's a lot of apathy hack
home," Liaqat said. "People need to
educate themselves and do some
thing about it. If we just get rid of him
[Musharraf], somebody else will
come in and do the same if we don't
have a civil society that's involved."
Musharraf is seen by the U.S. and
within Pakistan as a crucial cog in the
fight against Islamist extremists, de
spite his dictatorial habits. Appear
ing on state-run television last week
end. the general said he declared the
state of emergency to limit terrorist
attacks and "preserve the democrat
ic transition" that he began in his first
coup eight years ago.
While many have voiced a yearn
ing for democracy, the opposition of
fered little in the way of an alterna
tive to Musharraf's rule, leading
some to consider the general to be
their only defense against extrem

ism. Opposition leader Benazir
Bhutto only recently returned to
Pakistan after eight years of self-im
posed exile to lead her party in elec
tions and negotiate a power-sharing
agreement with Musharraf.
"The vast majority is against the
emergency measures," Liaqat said.
"But what's the other option? Some
people don't see the light at the end
of the tunnel."
Musharraf reportedly had backed
down from declaring emergency rule
in August in the face of political and
diplomatic pressure. For some Pak
istanis, last weekend's move did not
come as a surprise, a sad reflection of
Pakistan's political reality.
"It was both expected and unex
pected." Farooq said. "He's a dicta
tor. and you don't expect a lot of ra
tionality from them."
