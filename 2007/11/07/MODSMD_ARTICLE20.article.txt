"Apartheid" assessment
incorrect for Israel
In her Nov. 5 op-ed, "Israeli oc
cupation: Injustice in our name,"
Amanda Gelender is correct that it
is not anti-Semitic to criticize Is
rael or its government. In fact,
there are a multitude of moderate
Jewish groups and individuals who
do so constantly. But to call the sit
uation in Israel "apartheid," and to
demand divestment, is unfair and
dangerously wrong.
The American Heritage Dictio
nary defines apartheid as "an offi
cial policy of racial segregation for
merly practiced in the Republic of
South Africa, involving political,
legal, and economic discrimination
against nonwhites." In South
Africa, black citizens of the coun
try were oppressed simply because
of their skin color.
The Israeli occupation of the
West Bank, and until recently
Gaza, is markedly different. This is
a military occupation of land cap
tured in the 1%7 war, a conflict ini
tiated by Israel's hostile Arab
neighbors. The population of the
West Bank and Gaza is not com
posed of Israeli citizens; it is a for
eign and hostile population whose
leadership has repeatedly commit
ted itself to the destruction of Is
rael.
The continuing occupation is

the result of an intractable political
problem, due in some part to the
desire of right-wing Israelis to hold
on to the land, but due mostly to Is
rael's inability to trade the land for
any kind of viable peace.The Pales
tinians. who are indeed suffering,
are thus the victims more of their
own leadership and of the leader
ship of the Arab countries who
have refused, for 40 years, to ab
sorb them, or make genuine peace
with Israel, thus allowing a real
two-state solution.
Which brings us to the most per
nicious aspect of the "apartheid"
charge. While some who wield it
may genuinely hope for a peaceful
two state-solution, many use it as a
wedge to bring about the so-called
one state solution. This would en
tail instituting a right of return for
some or all Palestinians worldwide,
thus destroying Israel as a Jewish
state. It is an attempt to accomplish
through politics and demographics
what cannot be accomplished mili
tarily.
I wish Ms. Gelender would lend
her energies to groups like Ameri
cans for Peace Now. a liberal or
ganization working for a peaceful
two-state solution, rather than bla
tantly anti-Israeli groups like
SCAI.
