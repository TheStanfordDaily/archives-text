Stanford is the defending champi

Grube and Zack Miller '07 tied for
the individual crown last year.
Going into today's final round,
Stanford looks to defend last year's
title in what figures to be a fight to
the finish.
"The guys are fairly frustrated
with the way that the tournament is
going," Ray said. "The guys have
played on this golf course quite a
lot. It almost feels like a home tour

morrow's final round because the
guys know that they can go low if
they want to on many of the holes.
I'm hoping that we can put all of
our frustration aside so that tomor
