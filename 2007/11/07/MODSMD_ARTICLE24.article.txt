# In NFL, dynasties reign
## 
### 
It may be difficult to believe, but
there was once a time when "pari
ty" was synonymous with the NI L.
And in some circles it still is. You still
can't help but read the occasional col
umn or listen to the talking-heads on a
certain all-sports television network
and not hear some random throw-in
about the apparent widespread parity
of the league since 1999.
But as of 2(X)7. there should no
longer be any doubt in any circles of the
football-loving world: parity, as we
knew it. is dead.
Welcome to the new age of the dy
nasty. As it was in the 7()'s, KO's, and
early-mid 90s, a handful of teams now
sit atop the NFL's food-chain, and
that's not about to change any time
soon.
The privileged few,once again,have
a stranglehold on the race for the Lom
bardi trophy — take the Indianapolis
Colts. New England Patriots, Pitts
burgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys
out of the equation and maybe you can
say the league is wide-open.
Dispelling notions of parity isn't an
easy thing because it's been the
biggest buzz-word of the league's ob
servers for much of this past decade.
There was. and still is. the notion that
from one year to the next, any team
can make the leap back to relevancy,
and that's not entirely untrue. Teams
like Detroit, Tampa Bay, and Green
Bay are all having much better sea
sons than anyone predicted, while last
year's NFC Champion (Tiicago Bears
are stuck at 3-5.
But realistically, there's no reason to
believe that this year's Super Bowl will
be won by anyone other than the Colts
or Patriots. If you're a hit of a gambler,
maybe you can go with a trendy, slight
underdog in Dallas or Pittsburgh. But
that's it. Four teams are on top now.and
look to be in position to stay on top for
years to come.
We probably shouldn't be surprised
that parity went the way of Ricky Mar
tin. Parity was a consequence of the ad
vent of the salary cap and the free
agent frenzy that went along with it.
Quite simply, it took franchises a few
years to adjust to the league's new eco
nomic model. But there's too much
money and too many smart front-office
executives involved in the league for
that to have remained a mystery forev
er. And the teams that first figured out
this new way of doing business are the
ones who now sit atop the heap.
And they're each poised to be win
ners for years to come.
All four of the modern mega-fran
chises are led by quarterbacks either in
their primes (Peyton Manning and
Tom Brady) or approaching them
(Ben Roethlisberger and Tony
Romo). All have managed to build
their teams largely from within, relying
on the draft to acquire the foundations
of their teams. Bill Belichick and Tony
Dungy are two of the best in the game,
while Mike Tomlin and Dallas offen
sive coordinator Jason Garrett have
both clearly seen their stars rising this
year.
In fact, don't be surprised if these
four teams win three-quarters of the
annual championship hardware over
the next decade or so. There certainly
doesn't appear to be anyone who can
catch them. Consider that the Pats and
Colts both entered their Week Nine
showdown undefeated, in the latest
such matchup the Ni l. has ever seen.
Consider that there doesn't look to be
a single team in the NFC that can han
dle the Cowboys' powerful offense, or
any team in the AFC North that can
even give the Steelers a game.
Inevitably, we will all eventually
come to the conclusion that parity is.in
deed, dead. And just as inevitably.there
will be waves of negative opinions
pouring in from around the country to
mourn this ultimately short-lived chap
ter of the league's history.
But really, maybe we should all be
happy. Because no matter what team
you call your own on Sundays, the jack
pot has just gone up Whereas before
you could hope for a single year of glo
riously unforeseen championship fun
(e.g. the 1999 St. Louis Rams), now
every team can hope that some day.it
too can rise into the ranks of the NFL
elite.
And once again, they may even get
the chance to stay there awhile.
