Silicon Valley startup Loopt.
the brainchild of Stanford stu
dent Sam Altman. enables users
to know the location, activities
and availability of their friends at
all times without using phone
calls or email. Using location
based technologies, the program
facilitates real-world interaction
between friends via a social map
ping service available on mobile
hand-sets.
Altman. who is currently on
leave from Stanford where he is
an undergraduate in computer
science, conceived the idea for
mapping one's friends' locations
during the spring of his sopho
more year in 2005. That summer,
along with co-founders and fel
low students Nick Sivo '08 and
Alok Deshpande '07, Altman
began to work on the Loopt pro
totype.
"I've always been interested
in GPS [Global Positioning Sys
tem | and realized there was a
huge opportunity with GPS and
cell phones," Altman wrote in an
email to The Daily." Hie differen
tiating feature of mobility (as op
posed to, say. desktop computing)
is that location changes, and you
can use this information to build
incredibly relevant and powerful
applications."
According to the company's
Web site, the service "turns your
cell phone into a friend finder

with detailed maps that show you
who is where."
ITie team, joined by brothers
Rick and Tom Pernikoff, success
fully launched its first version of
Loopt with Boost Mobile in Sep
tember 2006 after receiving fund
ing from Sequoia Capital. At
present. Loopt is available on
Boost Mobile and Sprint Nextel.
but the developers are looking to
expand to numerous other carri
ers in the near future.
According to Deshpande,
once Loopt becomes more popu
lar it will "change the way people
use phones to connect with many
people at once."
Both Altman and Deshpande
agree that digital privacy is a
complex and important issue that
Loopt takes very seriously.
"I probably wouldn't have
wanted my mom to see where 1
was at all times in high school,"
Altman said, "so we ensured that
Loopt is a closed network service
with advanced privacy features to
screen who knows your where
abouts at any given time."
Deshpande emphasized the
individualized aspect of the pro
gram.
"Loopt is designed to reach
individual levels of comfort," he
said, "to a large degree enabling
the user to choose to disclose se
lect information according to
personal choice at all times."
