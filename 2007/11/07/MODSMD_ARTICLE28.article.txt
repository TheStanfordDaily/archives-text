# CAMPUS LIFE
## Happiness discussion hosted by Buddhists 
### MINH PHAN 
"The most important belief in
BuddhiMii is the existence of poten
tial in our life,"said Ph.D. candidate
Jason Lo, a member of Stanford's
World Peace Buddhists (WPB), at
yesterday's workshop entitled
"Happiness: What is it and how do
we hang onto it?"
Through community activities
such as last night's happiness dis
cussion. WPB, a student club based
on Nichiren Buddhism, strives to
put forth positive change and aims
to contribute to the happiness and
welfare of others.
The roundtable discussion,
which was held at the new multi
faith CIRCLE in Old Union, fo
cused on how Buddhist teachings
can be used to maintain a perma
nent level of happiness throughout
life.
"It's an important question be
cause happiness is something that
everybody searches out," said edu
cation graduate student Morghan
Velez-Young."From young to old. it
is universal."
WPB members proposed start
ing by simply chanting the phrase
"Nam-myoho-renge-kyo," meaning
"devotion to the mystic law of cause
and effect." Buddhists believe that
chanting can elevate the life condi
tion.
Buddhism teaches that there are
10 basic worlds that humans experi
ence. ranging from the most de
crepit, "hell," to enlightenment or
"Buddha-hood." Chanting is
thought to help people move to

higher worlds and thus bring forth
better qualities within themselves.
Vorrapan Chandee Ph.D. 10.an
other member of WPB. testified to
the effect of these teachings by
telling a story about how practicing
Buddhism helped her improve her
relationship with her roommate.
"I was having a difficult time in
teracting with my roommate,"
Chandee said. "I used to blame all
my unhappiness on her until my
mom suggested that I should chant
for her happiness. At first I was
skeptical, but as I became more sin
cere towards this feeling. 1 realized
that 1 was happier as well."
The discussion ended with a
quote from the current president of
Sokka Gakkai International (S(il),
a Buddhist network affiliated with
WPB.
" True happiness is not the ab
sence of suffering. You cannot have
day after day of clear skies." recited
a WPB member, speaking for SGI
president Daisaku Ikeda. "True
happiness lies in building a self that
stands dignified and indomitable
like a great palace â€” on all days,
even when it is raining, snowing or
stormy."
The discussion gave some partic
ipants a new way to think about
happiness.
"It gave a different perspective
on how people work towards happi
ness." said Dominique Youkhehpaz
'1 l,"and it was interesting to view a
different side of campus culture."
