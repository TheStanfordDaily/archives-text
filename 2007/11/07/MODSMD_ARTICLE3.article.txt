## Stanford Store selling Rainbows 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The shelves at the Stanford Student Store are a
little more colorful this year, now that the student
owned and operated retail outlet is selling Rainbow
sandals, the popular brand of flip Hops seen on the
feet of students all across campus.
"Our decision to sell Rainbow Sandals was made

as one of our attempts to win over the student mar
ket." Bennett Mauser '10, general manager of the
Stanford Student Store told The Daily. "So far, both
Rainbow sandals and the Cal Sucks [t-shirt] pro
gram have led this initiative to serve the students."
I le acknowledged that the Stanford Store faces
competition from the centrally located and well
known Stanford Bookstore, and as a result, student
executives at the store are planning to draw back

some of their business. Â«
Through a series of focus
groups, the Stanford Store ex
ecutives learned that students
wanted them to sell products that
were not offered by the Book
store.
