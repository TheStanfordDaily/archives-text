## Stanford Store selling Rainbows 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The shelves at the Stanford Student Store are a
little more colorful this year, now that the student
owned and operated retail outlet is selling Rainbow
sandals, the popular brand of flip Hops seen on the
feet of students all across campus.
"Our decision to sell Rainbow Sandals was made

as one of our attempts to win over the student mar
ket." Bennett Mauser '10, general manager of the
Stanford Student Store told The Daily. "So far, both
Rainbow sandals and the Cal Sucks [t-shirt] pro
gram have led this initiative to serve the students."
I le acknowledged that the Stanford Store faces
competition from the centrally located and well
known Stanford Bookstore, and as a result, student
executives at the store are planning to draw back

some of their business. «
Through a series of focus
groups, the Stanford Store ex
ecutives learned that students
wanted them to sell products that
were not offered by the Book
store.

"When I saw that the Bookstore
started carrying Stanford Crocs,"
Hauser said. "I decided that our
store needed to have a comparable
product that students actually would
wear."
Rainbows were a natural choice.
Hauser, himself a convert to Rain
bows from the popular sandal brand
Reef, said that once stocked, the flip
flops were an immediate best-seller.
About 100 pairs have been sold since
they arrived at the store in mid-Sep
tember.
"People like Rainbow sandals be
cause they are incredibly comfort
able and long-lasting." he explained.
"The company is relatively small and
has gone into competition against
the big time flip-flop companies, re

fusing to be bought out."
The company that sells Rainbows
is also enthusiastic about the retail
arrangement. Pat Huber, a market
ing spokesman for Rainbow, told
The Daily in an email that selling
Rainbows in student stores nation
wide is an ideal situation for the com
pany, but it often fails to be realized
because of the large contracts Rain
bow has with larger corporate retail
entities — often bookstores — on
various campuses.
Huber was unsure of the number
of student stores currently carrying
the sandals, but named UCLA and
USC as other schools where the
shoes are available. Roughly 0.25
percent of Rainbow's total revenue
comes from these student store ac
counts, he said, while an estimated 20
percent of the company's business
comes from college students. Re
sponding to claims that the shoes are
"trendy," Huber agreed, but clarified
the trend's impetus.

"They're trendy because once
you buy and wear a pair, you'll never
switch to anything else," he said.
Last August, Afeef Ahmed i(),
merchandising manager for the
Stanford Store, placed an order for
Rainbow sandals as part of a larger
plan to create repeat customers for
the business. The store now carries
both models of the signature leather
sandal as well as a hemp sandal in a
variety of sizes. In addition, students
can browse the entire Rainbow cata
logue on the Stanford Store's Web
site and order flip-flops for pick-up
on campus.
According to Ahmed, the Stan
ford Store is the only Rainbow ven
dor who is approved to sell below the
company's minimum resale value.
By showing their ID. students re
ceive 10 percent off that minimum
price, making the store the cheapest
outlet around. This brings the classic
men's model of Rainbow sandals
down to just under $40.

"We're the cheapest place you
can get Rainbow sandals," he said.
"Cheaper than [Rainbow's] Web
site."
'ITie store has sold roughly 10-15
pairs of Rainbows each week, neces
sitating reorders almost every week,
Ahmed added.
"We're the Stanford store and we
obviously want to carry things with
the Stanford name on it."he said.
"But we also want things that people
are going to need during the school
year and Rainbow sandals are one
example of that."
TTie store is doing much better
than last year. Ahmed said, and the
increased sales may be partly attrib
uted to Rainbow sandals.
"As long as they keep selling
well," he said, "I think they're going
to be something that we'll offer for a
while."
