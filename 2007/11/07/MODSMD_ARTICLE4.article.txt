# Sports: Q&A with Bob Bowlsby
## Sports, the Stanford way Bowlsby's top athletics program runs with top-notch academics 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
In just his second full year as Stanford's Ath
letic Director, Boh Bowlsby has already made
waves. After last year's horrendous 1-11 football
campaign, he pulled the plug on second-year
coach Walt Harris and hired upstart Jim Har
baugh. a move which already appears to have
paid dividends. Bowslby. 55, seems to have a
knack for big-time football hires: while at lowa,
he was responsible for hiring Kirk Ferentz.
Bowlsby sat down recently with The Daily
for a question-and-answer session, discussing
various topics ranging from life on ITie Farm to
Mike Montgomery to Jim Harbaugh.
Stanford Daily: Try to describe the pressures of
working as the Athletic Director at the big-time.
Division I level.
Bob Bowlsby: I don't know. I've been managing
a Division I-A athletics program for most of the
last 20 years. The things that go with it are the
things that go with it. It has its pressures like any
other thing on campus, or any other job. I don't
spend much (time] thinking about it to tell you
the truth.
