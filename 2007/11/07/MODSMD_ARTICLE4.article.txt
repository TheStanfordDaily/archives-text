# Sports: Q&A with Bob Bowlsby
## Sports, the Stanford way Bowlsby's top athletics program runs with top-notch academics 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
In just his second full year as Stanford's Ath
letic Director, Boh Bowlsby has already made
waves. After last year's horrendous 1-11 football
campaign, he pulled the plug on second-year
coach Walt Harris and hired upstart Jim Har
baugh. a move which already appears to have
paid dividends. Bowslby. 55, seems to have a
knack for big-time football hires: while at lowa,
he was responsible for hiring Kirk Ferentz.
Bowlsby sat down recently with The Daily
for a question-and-answer session, discussing
various topics ranging from life on ITie Farm to
Mike Montgomery to Jim Harbaugh.
Stanford Daily: Try to describe the pressures of
working as the Athletic Director at the big-time.
Division I level.
Bob Bowlsby: I don't know. I've been managing
a Division I-A athletics program for most of the
last 20 years. The things that go with it are the
things that go with it. It has its pressures like any
other thing on campus, or any other job. I don't
spend much (time] thinking about it to tell you
the truth.
SI): What was the change like com
ing from lowa to here? What moti
vated you to come out West?
BBTh ere's some things that are a lit
tle different about living in Califor
nia. We live on campus — we really
enjoy being close to campus and
close to the activities.
More than anything else, what at
tracted me to Stanford was the merg
er of world-class academics and
world-class athletics. Our programs
are comprised of outstanding stu
dents and it's a new set of challenges.
Some of the things that were easy at
lowa are difficult here and some of
the things that were difficult at lowa
are relatively easy here.
SI): What major changes, if any, have
you enacted since taking over for Ted
Leland in April 2006? What is the
biggest difference about Stanford
now that you're around?
BB: I wouldn't say it's radically dif
ferent. What I found here was a cul
ture of high achievement, a cult ure of
doing things the right way.Those are
both difficult to create if they're not
already there. That's a great founda
tion for a program, and it probably
existed before Ted got here, but he
certainly enhanced it and nurtured it.
We've made some changes to
fundraising and the business aspects
of the program, but fundamentally,
there haven't been radical changes
required.
SI): What changes would you still
like to see made?
ItII: There are lots of things we're
working on. I don't believe we're as
good technologically as we need to
be. I don't think our Web sites are as
good as they need to be. I think how
we interface with various publics
needs to be improved. I think some
of the services we provide to our var
ious publics could be more efficient.
It doesn't matter how good the or
ganization is: there are always ways it
can be made better...Even as suc
cessful as we've been, there are ways
we can get better.
SI): Talk about Jim Harbaugh. What
was it about him that made him the
right guy for the job?
BB: lie made the considered deci
sion to move from professional foot
ball to learning how the college game
worked with his move from the
Raiders to the University of San
Diego.
What 1 heard repeatedly about
Jim was that he was a person who
made everyone around him better. I
think that's about as good a trait one
could ask for in a coach. I liked his
energy and the success he had. More
than anything else. I kept hearing he
was a guy that made everyone
around him better, and 1 think we
found that to be true.
SI): Where were you during the USC
victory? What was your initial reac
tion and how do you view the win
now?
BB: I was at the game. Part of the
time I was in the press box. the sec
ond half 1 was [watching] from the
sideline. 1 was about 30 feet from
Bradford's catch in the end zone. It
was a huge win. Some have called it
the biggest upset in the history of col

lege football, so it's significant from
that standpoint. It was fun to he a
part of that— I think it gives us hope
for the future with what Stanford
football can be. but it still leaves us
with a lot of work to be done.
I was happy for our players, par
ticularly. and obviously for our
coaches. The players have been
through a lot the last two to three
years, and some of them longer than
that. It was nice for them to have a
chance to get some positive feed
back.
SI): Comment on former Stanford
basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery's role in the Athletic Depart
ment.
BB: Mike's a big part of Stanford ath
letics history. We're very glad to have
him back and he'll be working with
our staff on fundraising activities and
working on a public relations stand
point. I expect he'll be serving on
some NCAA committees and pro
viding them with the benefit of his
years of experience — his years of
experience will serve well as a re
source to draw upon.

SI): Hie recent Brook Lopez suspen
sion raised the ever-present issue of
college athletes and their place as
students. At a school like Stanford,
how do you balance between pro
moting big-time athletics while keep
ing intact the fundamental motives
of the University?
Bit: 1 think that's what makes Stanford
special: we don't compromise in any
area. We demand that every one of our
student athletes is competitive in the
classroom. It's one of the things that
appeals to me about Stanford, [and] it
appeals to our coaches and our student
athletes. I think our standard doesn't
change much from sport to sport or
season to season or person to person.
We expect high achievement in both
areas; when that doesn't happen we
have to take the necessary steps.
SI): Is your position at Stanford the
pinnacle for you in terms of your ca
reer? Do you have loftier career as
pirations?
Bit: I certainly don't expect to be
going any place. I'm 55 and I don't

know how much longer I II work, but
I expect that it'll be at Stanford. 1
hope that it will.
SI) Comment on your thoughts
about life at Stanford as a whole.
Itlt: This university is an extraordi
nary place. 1 think that anybody who
comes here — whether you're the
AD or a faculty member or a stu
dent or somebody affiliated in some
other way — it's important that you
embrace what Stanford is.
You can't come in and resist what
Stanford is. you have to embrace it.
It's an extraordinary place populat
ed with amazing people doing some
remarkable things. From the athlet
ics perspective, it's very unique in
the way we go about what we do.
Our student athletes graduate at the
same rate as the rest of the student
population, our student athletes
take on lots of extra time in the pur
suit of excellence of their sport but
they are expected to do the same
thine in their classes.
