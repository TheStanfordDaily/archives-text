Volunteers from the University's
Shorenstein Asia Pacific Research Center
(APARC) and Hands-on Bay Area came
together last night for "Bring Me A Book"
Volunteer Night.The event took place at the
Bring Me A Book headquarters in nearby
Mountain View, where the volunteers had
dinner and learned about the organization.
Denise Masumoto. A PARC's manager
of corporate relations, headed the 20 volun
teers from A PARC, who are visiting fellows
doing research at Stanford for a year and
represent countries including China, India,

Japan and the Philippines.
Masumoto said APARC became affili
ated with the Bring Me A Book Program
when she found the program online and
thought it represented an integral part of
American lifestyle and culture. She also
hoped that it could "encourage the visiting
fellows to volunteer in other ways in their
own countries."
"It is an honor to host the students of
Stanford's Asia Pacific Research Center,"
said Bring Me A Book volunteer coordina
tor and community outreach manager
Monte/ Davis. "Since many of these volun
teers have families, this is the perfect way

for them to experience first hand the differ
ence you can make in the future success of
a child all through volunteer work."
Bring Me A Book began with Judy
Koch's mission to provide easy access to the
best children's books and to inspire reading
aloud with children.The foundation aims to
provide brand-new books of the best quali
ty to children who do not have the means to
obtain them otherwise.
"We believe that every child deserves
books of the same quality," said Bring Me A
Book office manager Inn Smith.
Bring Me A Book is affiliated with
volunteer corporations such as
CISCO, Google and Starbucks, as
well as other non-profit organiza
tions. Hands-on Bay Area is a non
profit organization that aims to make
volunteer work easy and accessible,
organizers said.
Davis hosted the event along with
Donovan Cook '66, director of devel
opment for Bring Me A Book. The
pair began by giving the volunteers a
brief tour around the headquarters
and updating the volunteers on their
latest plans.
The organizers mentioned proj
ects including the recent distribution
of Karen Ehrhardt's "This Jazz Man"
to Oakland Public Schools like the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary
School and the recent openings of
Bring Me A Book in places such as
Hong Kong, Malawi. Mexico and the
Philippines.
