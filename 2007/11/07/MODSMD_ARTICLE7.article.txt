### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
ASSLJ senators once again postponed a
vote on former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld's appointment as a I loover Institu
tion Distinguished Fellow at their meeting
last night, citing a need to ensure that the bill
is properly written.This is the second week in
a row that the bill has been postponed.
Senator Stuart Baimel '09. the bill's au
thor. advocated tabling the bill at yester
day's meeting. He emphasized that before
the bill comes to a vote, he would like to re
ceive feedback from individual senators as
well as other students interested in the issues
surrounding Rumsfeld's appointment.
"I made the bill by myself basically, and 1
submitted it for consideration by myself."
Baimel said."l was hoping to get input as the
process went on before the vote. But there
hasn't been enough time for that to happen."
The majority of the Senate supported the
motion to postpone the vote in order to en
sure that the voice of the student body is ac
curately represented.
"I am actually glad that it has been tabled
because as of now. the bill was not satisfacto
ry to anyone, and it was not even satisfacto
ry to the author," said I Undergraduate Sen
ate Chair Priyanka Sharma W." This is the
opinion that the Senate is expressing, so it
might as well be a powerful one."
A few senators, however, expressed
reservations about postponing the vote, cit
ing fears that the decision will incur further
delays.
"i am just worried that [the vote] will just
keep getting delayed more and more." said
Senator Tomas Vacek '10. "I definitely sup
port voting on the bill next week at the lat
est."
Over the course of the week. Baimel
hopes to meet with senators and students to
discuss the bill's wording and structure in
order to make changes that accurately re
flect the majority's take on the issues pre
sented.
"There is a question of tone and what sort
of tack you take." Baimel said. "I take the
tack that irrespective of whether
Rumsfeld is a good or a bad person,
the cost of bringing him here to the
University is higher than the bene
fits."
Baimel said that he is willing to
consider other ways to phrase the
issue at hand.
"Some people want to insert lan
guage about war crimes and ethics,"
he continued. "I. personally, do not
support that, but I am willing to meet
with people and see if some sort of
compromise can be reached."
The Senate's primary focus while
voting on the bill is still to represent
the opinions of the majority of the
student population on campus.
"I really am a proponent of voting
on this resolution and also simulta
neously for senators to make in
formed votes on the resolution
which are representative of the un
dergraduate student body," said Sen
ator Patrick Cordova '09. "I want to
balance those."

Cordova reiterated other sena
tors' concerns about deferring the
vote.
"If the author of this resolution
has questions about how this bill is to
be structured. I am certainly behind
him in that, but also, I strongly en
courage there to be a timeline set
with this issue." he said. "Let's put a
date on it. let's vote on it. let's get

feedback on it and let's pass this bill."
Although the voting on the
Rumsfeld resolution has been
pushed back, the Senate did pass a
bill to financially endorse the ASSU
Airport Shuttle at last night's meet
ing. along with a bill to renew the
ASSU Art Grants Program. The
Senate is also prepared for this
week's Hike Light Extravaganza.

Starting today and for the remain
der of the week between noon and 1
p.m. in White Plaza, senators will be
giving out free bike lights that would
typically cost $25 to $30. They will
also be handing out free Jamba Juice
with the lights.
