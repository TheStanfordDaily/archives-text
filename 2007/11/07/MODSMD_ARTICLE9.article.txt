## GRADUATE LIFE Google is an evil cult 
### 
0 • • staffed hy crazy people. Well, maybe not
evil. And now that 1 think about it.the people aren't
really crazy. But it is a cult, and it may well be bent on

world domination.
When you're
at Stanford, it's
hard to escape
the overbearing
presence of
Google in the
Bay Area. We

may he insular
here, but for
most grad students, Google still seems to fall within
the bubble.
Right now I'm living with a self-styled "Googler"
(just saying that word left a bitter taste in my mouth),
so I've gotten to experience the G-uggernaut first
hand. In terms of life penetration, it's pretty damn im
pressive.
My roommate eats almost all her meals at I IQ.and
her social life involves mostly people from the office
(and often takes place at the office); she talks the talk
and walks the walk — she even wears the G-clothing.
Yes. if you thought Stanford students were bad
when it comes to relentless branding, Google is some
thing else.
Now. wearing a Stanford-stamped hoodie around
campus when you're eighteen is forgivable (you're
young, lazy and devoid of anything approaching
style). Traipsing around San Francisco, broadcasting
your corporate servitude, is not. After all. people with
real jobs can afford to buy real clothes.
But it's my roommate's self-G-dentification that
disturbs me the most. It's one thing to be a member of
a cult; it's quite another to walk around in your robes,
cyanide-laced Kool-Aid in hand, head held high.
Some people think that only as a student do you get
a restricted view of the world, trapped in the tiny bub
ble of your campus. The thing is. though, just because
you leave doesn't mean you've broken free. You can
carry that bubble with you; it just G-shrinks until you
suffocate and die.
Usually, said suffocation process takes a while, but
Google has it down to a tee. They run your life. ITiey
provide you with everything you need: food, shelter,
music, beer (but only on Fridays), games, a social life
— even romance. Whatever you want, there's no need
to leave work.
(To be fair, while they may have drunk the Kool-
Aid. devotees of the high church of Google still have
a little of that post-millennium faux-irony thing going
on—you know, where every observation is tinted
with a hint of self-depreciation, as in: "Yeah. I know
my life is run by a corporate machine, but can't talk
now, got to go and have G-fun.")
There was a brief moment when working for the G-
Man was cool, when the free food and toys seemed
like the ultimate perks for a job that just involved not
"doing evil." But now 1 see the evil masterminds at the
Googledome for who they really are: drug pushers.

trapping their employees in an un
ending cycle of addiction and high
earnings. As opposed to. say, a cycle
of tedious research and poverty.
Actually, with its free food, its

highly insular social life and the
cultish obsession of its worker bees,
the thing Google most reminds me
of is grad school. Which, on reflec
tion, probably explains why I hate it
so much.
