## New philanthropy center opens at Haas 
### CATHERINE LE 
Students interested in philanthropy have a home
at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil
Society (PACS).
"The primary goal of the Center is to nurture
and support some very basic research on civil soci
ety and the role of civil society in addressing press
ing social problems," said PACS Faculty co-Direc
tor Debra Meyerson. an associate professor at the
School of Education." Within that, we are looking at
the role of philanthropy as an important civil socie
ty institution."
PACS. which opened in September 2006, is a pro
gram of the Institute for Research in the Social Sci
ences (IRiSS). Since its inception, the Center has
been located in the Haas Center for Public Service.
Unlike other centers. PACS is not located in a spe
cific school because its research covers a broad
spectrum of disciplines.
Discussions over the Center's establishment
started about two and a half years ago.
"Because of the recent rise in interest in philan
thropy around the country and around the world
there was talk about developing more research on

it," said PACS Managing Director Malka Kopell.
"There have been other research centers in other
academic institutions, but none at Stanford."
To fulfill its goal of examining civil society insti
tutions' roles, PACS offers fellowships, seminars,
courses and workshops to further research and help
train future scholars interested in the field.
"We have workshops where they can share their
work and work through their ideas," Meyerson said.
"Students from across campus can come together
as a community."
Workshops and seminars such as these have
helped Hilary Schaffer, a PACS fellow and Ph.D.
candidate in the School of Earth Sciences, develop
her project.
"Because 1 spend a lot of time in the field and a
lot of time interviewing people in the trenches,"
Schaffer said,"it helps to come back to this commu
nity of scholars and connect those ideas with aca
demic and theoretical literatures so that they can be
applied to a broader field."
Schaffer's project examines the effects of com
munity support or opposition on proposals for
liquified natural gas terminals, which prepare gases
for use with home appliances.Threatened by pollu

tion problems and unwanted changes, communities
may rally together to deny a company's construc
tion proposal.
"There have been nine proposals in California,"
Schaffer said."l 'm comparing three and seeing how
the community responded to it in opposition or sup
port. In many ways the companies that are propos
ing are competing to get through regulations be
cause the market only supports one or two termi
nals."
After growing up near a national laboratory in a
town with a legacy of waste management problems.
Schaffer found this topic to be a natural choice.
Yet, graduate students such as Schaffer are not
the only ones welcome at PACS. Faculty and under
graduate students may take advantage of the cen
ter's many resources, as well. 1 iowever, according to
Kopell. undergraduates have not yet utilized the
Center as much as graduate students.
"We are interested in hearing from undergradu
ates as to how we can better support their interest in
philanthropy and civil society and their works in
those areas," Kopell said.
