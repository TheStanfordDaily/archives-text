## Dog genes reveal coding for specific fur color 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
When Cruella de Vil tried kid
napping those 101 dalmatians for a
fur coat, she also could have studied
their genes to find out why they have
such fashionable black spots.
Scientists at the School of Medi

cine, who pursued this research
question themselves, found that the
gene encoding black fur in dogs is
part of a larger family of genes
known for fighting infections. The
discovery may eventually play a role
in understanding human weight
management and stress regulation.
The University research team,

led by Genetics Prof. Greg Barsh,
published its findings online with
Sciencexpress on Oct. 18. The full
paper detailing the discoveries will
be printed in an upcoming issue of
the journal Science.
Sophie Candille, Ph.D. '07, the
study's co-first author, explained that
the group chose to research dog fur

color because "pigmentation is an
easy point into learning more about
important biological pathways." In
particular, coat color in mammals is
controlled by a cellular circuit called
the melanocortin pathway.
"Molecules in the pathway work
together to decide which pigments
to make," Candille said.
Similar melanocortin signaling is
also involved in human skin color,
weight regulation and adrenal gland
function. One of the first clues to
this versatility of the pathway came
from research in rodents.
"In mice, if you over-express the
protein that makes them yellow,
they're also obese," Candille said,
adding that the mice got fat because
the pigmentation molecule that was
expressed — callcd agouti — also
interfered with the brain's
melanocortin pathway, where it in
duced weight disregulation.
According to Candille, coat color
became a logical thing to study as it
is a visual marker of an important
biological pathway.
"Many different coat color muta
tions have been selected for in labo
ratory mice and domestic animals,"
Candille explained, giving re
searchers a full library of animal pig
mentation for study.
Dogs in particular presented a
unique opportunity. Scientists have
known since the 1950s that coat
color in dogs was determined differ
ently from other mammals whose
genetics were already understood.
"We didn't know why dogs were
different," Candille said, "but we
thought it'd be a good opportunity
to learn more about the
melanocortin pathway."
Candille went to Bay Area dog
shows to perform mouth swabs on
hundreds of dogs of different

breeds. She used a Q-tip-like instru
ment on each canine cheek to obtain
the dog's DNA.
The show dogs were used to
being prodded and examined, "so
they didn't mind," she said.
Candille also collected DNA
through the mail from dog owners,
and collaborated with breeders of
Large Munsterlanders and boxers
for their DNA.
Genetic analysis found the dogs'
fur was darkened by a gene called
CBDIO3. Co-first author Chris
Kaelin. Ph.D. '06, confirmed the dis
covery when he inserted the gene
into transgenic mice. The CBDIO3-
infused rodents sprouted black fur.
CBDIO3 turned out to be one of
a class of genes called beta-de
fensins. Named for their role in the
immune system, defensins are found
in white blood cells and have the
ability to kill harmful microbes.
Finding a gene for dog coat color
in the defensin family surprised re
searchers.
"Beta defensins had never been
implicated in pigmentation," Can
dille said.
The research shows that beta-de
fensins may play a general role in
melanocortin signaling.
Humans vary in their number
and type of beta-defensins, but sci
entists don't yet know what this
means for individuals. The Stanford
group's research suggests a good
place to look would be
melanocortin-regulated processes
such as pigmentation, weight regu
lation and stress response.
As for that elusive fur coat, the
Stanford researchers have no rec
ommendations for Cruella de Vil.
