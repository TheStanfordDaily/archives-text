## Dog genes reveal coding for specific fur color 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
When Cruella de Vil tried kid
napping those 101 dalmatians for a
fur coat, she also could have studied
their genes to find out why they have
such fashionable black spots.
Scientists at the School of Medi

cine, who pursued this research
question themselves, found that the
gene encoding black fur in dogs is
part of a larger family of genes
known for fighting infections. The
discovery may eventually play a role
in understanding human weight
management and stress regulation.
The University research team,

led by Genetics Prof. Greg Barsh,
published its findings online with
Sciencexpress on Oct. 18. The full
paper detailing the discoveries will
be printed in an upcoming issue of
the journal Science.
Sophie Candille, Ph.D. '07, the
study's co-first author, explained that
the group chose to research dog fur

color because "pigmentation is an
easy point into learning more about
important biological pathways." In
particular, coat color in mammals is
controlled by a cellular circuit called
the melanocortin pathway.
