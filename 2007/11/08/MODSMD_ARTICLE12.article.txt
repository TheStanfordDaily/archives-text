### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
In just her first year at the Univer
sity. Political Science Lecturer Tammy
Frisby was named executive director
of the Bill Lane Center for the Study
of the North American West in Sep
tember.
The Center, which concentrates its
work on North American land west of
the 100-degree meridian, focuses on
both present and historical analysis of
the American West.
In 2(X)5, the Center received a $5
million donation from Bill Lane '42
that was matched by a $4 million do
nation from the William and Flora
I iewlett Foundation and subsequent
ly began a national search for an exec
utive director last spring.
After receiving dozens of applica
tions from both local and national ap
plicants. Bill Lane Center co-directors
and 1 listory Profs. Richard White and
David Kennedy '63 chose newcomer
Frisby for the newly created position.
"Dr. Frisby brings many things to
the table," Kennedy said. "She has a
Ph.D. from Harvard. She's originally
from the West, she grew up in Mon
tana. she's energetic and disciplined,
and in her one year here she's already
internalized the organization and

structure of the Center."
Frisby wants to expand the nation
al influence of the Center during her
tenure as executive director.
"My primary role at the center is
strategy and financial development,"
she said. "Our biggest priority in the
next few years is to make Stanford's
voice heard to policymakers at all lev
els."
Frisby also described many of the
programs the Center hopes to imple
ment in coming years. Among the pri
orities are launching research initia
tives to study water; the pressing prob
lems of rural and urban areas; and im
migration. particularly from Mexico.
'I lie Center will also continue many of
its internship opportunities — includ
ing summer internships in such places
as Yosemite and Yellowstone Nation
al Parks — and events, such as "Walk
ing the Farm," which debuted last
spring.
"in the U.S., the West has the high
est rate of immigration and the highest
GDP," Kennedy said. "Clearly the
West will be important in future na
tional development, and we want to
make Stanford the premier location
for the study of this area."
Frisby said she is approaching the
goals and challenges of the Center
with enthusiasm.
"It's an exciting time to be here,"
she said. "The Bill Lane Center is in a
strong position to move forward."
