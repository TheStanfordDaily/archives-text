## Editorial Board Senior Night takes to the lanes for a worthwhile change of pace 
### 
It is praiseworthy enough that this year s
Senior Nights have faced few of the
problems that publicly plagued the pro
gram last year. However, tonight's sched
uled '80s-themed bowling event shows that
the planners are now growing from being
simply successful executors to becoming in
novators in keeping things interesting.
The change from the usual format
(Class of'oB stampedes into a nearby bar or
two) makes sense in the seventh week of the
quarter. After the novelty of senior year has
begun to wane, a slightly different activity is
a welcome change for those who might be
growing tired of the local bar scene.
In addition, the change gives recogni
tion to the members of the senior class who
don't drink. One of the stated goals of call
ing the weekly event "Senior Night" instead
of "Pub Night" was to make non-drinkers
feel more welcome, as well as to assuage the
fears of nervous parents and administrators.
Alcohol is, and will remain, an integral part
of Senior Night; after three years of being
able to vote but not to buy a drink, it is nat
ural that the seniors toast their new ability to
imbibe legally. Those who choose not to ex
ercise their right, however, will probably ap
preciate the occasional Thursday spent in a
venue that features more activities for
themselves than watching their friends hic
cup over $10 drinks.
Having something to do other than just
drinking will also facilitate socializing for all
Senior Night attendees. Even liquid courage
isn't enough to get some students to break
out of their shells or out of their cliques, but
a designated activity — particularly a com
petitive activity, as we are all Stanford stu

dents— can unite strangers in a mutual
quest for glory that will last until next Thurs
day. Whether students are rejoicing over
strikes or commiserating over a deplorable
series of gutter balls, they have a built-in
topic of conversation beyond the standard
verbal fare of "where-ya-livin " and "how'd
midterms-go?".
Further, bowling itself is a brilliantly
cheesy activity, perfectly paired with the
night's theme and suggested costumes.
Nola's and the Old Pro, for example, are
classic Senior Night destinations but are less
than conducive to inducing students to dress
silly in the spirit of class unity. Any Palo Alto
bar is usually full of yuppie I-banking 20-
somethings — in other words, the seniors in
two years. Even the fun gets a little busi
nesslike.
In contrast,college provides unique op
portunities for absurd costumes and goofy
behavior, opportunities that must be ex
ploited while they exist. There is no doubt
that some seniors inwardly mourn the job
hunting, thesis-writing, grad-school-apply
ing seriousness that already occupies their
lives. A Iliursday night of big hair and pastel
sport coats is the kind of ridiculous down
time that any upperclassman. harried by the
specter of the imminent Real World, needs
after midterms to take him or her back to
the dreamlike days of freshman year, when
dorm hallway parties would colorfully erupt
out of carefree spontaneity.
And for those who love the bars, hate
bowling, despise costumes, resent being
born too late for the '70s, and can't stand the
mere thought of rented shoes — well, it's
only one night.
