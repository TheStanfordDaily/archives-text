## Pearl Milk Ziv: Boba done right 
### 
Boba, pearl milk tea, bubble tea... what
ever you might call it, this dreamy mix
ture of tea, milk, sugar, and tapioca
balls has sustained many a youth in areas
with dense Asian populations for centuries
(20th and 21st). Yet, unless one travels to the
beverage's birthplace of Taiwan, it's damn
near impossible to find a consistently pleas
ant pearl milk tea experience in this world.
Yes, there is Verde in Mountain View with its
strong Stanford following, but even this es
tablishment has its faults.
You can never seem to get boba just right,
no matter where you go. Sometimes the bub
ble tea won't have much flavor, leaving you
more with boba-flavored water than any
thing else. Occasionally the ingredients that
comprise the boba are horrible to begin with,
and don't taste any better when mixed to
gether. Other times, the pearls will be too
hard, or again, not very flavorful.
But this drink isn't even difficult to make:
it involves the simple mixing of standardized
quantities of powder and water, or tea, milk
and flavoring. So how is it screwed up, time
and time again? Why can't people just import
some key ingredients from Taiwan and mix
them properly? I've grown so frustrated over
this that I've decided to personally shake up
the bubble tea scene. As a boba connoisseur,
I will share with you my vision of pearl milk
tea, and set the standard for the industry.
When I make my first million, in whatev
er currency it may be, I'm going to open up
my own chain of boba stores. Pearl Milk Ziv.
However, before this happens, I will go out
and get my boba credentials, the Ph D of
Pearl Milkology. I will travel to Taiwan to
seek out the wisest pearl milk tea master, the
boba equivalent of Pai Mei, that old Chinese
guy in Kill Bill 2 with an elaborate mous
tache and legendary Kung Fu skills. As I train
night and day to perfect my boba skills, I will
also find and befriend the best suppliers of
boba powders, teas, and other crucial ingre
dients. Thereafter, I will triumphantly return
to the United States with a steady supply of
top-quality boba ingredients and a mastery
of their use.
From there, I will make the most delicious
and consistent boba in the world to sell in
stores with unforgettable ambiances. Ma
chines will dispense the necessary ingredi
ents in precise amounts so employees can't
screw it up. I will never put ice in your drink
after it has been created, so the flavor re
mains undiluted. However, I will strive to de
liver a properly chilled drink, either by pre

cooling the ingredients or subjecting the
drink to only fleeting contact with ice.
Traditional boba, however, is not the only
thing Pearl Milk Ziv will deliver. I'll make
boba sweetened with Splenda, for those try
ing to watch their calories. Five percent alco
hol boba for the in-crowd. Carbonated boba.
You know the plastic-sealed top on some
boba drinks that you poke a hole through
with your straw? It will feature people's
faces, from celebrities to your friends, so you
can poke a hole through them as well.
I mentioned spectacular surroundings for
your boba experience. Each store will be
heavily themed, like a Rain Forest Cafe on
crack. Bulls-eye targets will be featured in
the store, allowing you to perfect your
straw/blowdart pearl launching skills. Some
times your pearl milk tea will be created with
Vegas bartender-style flourish — extrava
gant throws, catches, spins, and bursts of
flame will all be part of the repertoire.
Yes, I realize I'm a white man talking
about an Asian drink, but aside from the fact
that discrimination is wrong, my ethnicity is
a non-issue for several reasons. First, I grew
up in Cupertino, where my high school was
70 percent Asian, so culturally I'm as Asian
as the next guy. Second, I'm Israeli,and since
Israel is geographically located in the conti
nent of Asia (the Middle East is not consid
ered a continent), that also makes me Asian.
Third. I will put up the picture of my Tai
wanese boba master in every store, so as to
create the illusion that this elderly Chinese
man is behind your boba. Lastly, pearl milk
tea encompasses all colors of the world, from
taro purple to almond white. If the drink
doesn't hate, then neither should you.
So embrace my pale skin and drink my
concoction. I promise you won't be let down.
I don't want to turn a profit from these
stores. The only thing I want to see is people
of all races, sitting down together time and
time again, enjoying a cup of that apparently
simple but elusive elixir of deliciousness.

Is great pearl milk lea the answer to the world's
problems? F.mail zivs<&stanford edu with
