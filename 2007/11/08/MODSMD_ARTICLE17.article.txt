## Pakistan: The case for radical foreign policy 
### 
One might identify four schools of
thought within the American foreign
policy Establishment. Hie Classical
Statecraft school,perhaps best identified with
Brent Scowcroft. Zbigniew Brzezinski,
Henry Kissinger, Condoleezza Rice, and the
first President Bush, emphasizes careful
diplomacy and limited military action in
order to strengthen allies, undermine and iso
late enemies, and shift the balance of power
against competitors.
One might distinguish three competitors
to the Classical school. Institutionalism, iden
tified with many European countries' foreign
policies, emphasizes the importance of multi
lateralism and international institutions,
thereby suggesting that international law and
cooperative norms are the best way to meet
common challenges such as nuclear prolifer
ation and climate change. Ibis school is not a
particularly strong political force in the US.
Radicalism, perhaps best exemplified by
Paul Wolfowitz's views, establishes liberal in
stitutionalist goals such as the rule of interna
tional law, human rights, and nonprolifera
tion, but does not shy away from military
force as a means to secure those ends.The So
viet Union should not be balanced, but de
feated; Saddam Hussein should not be con
tained, but toppled. For a while, the second
President Bush adopted a radical foreign pol
icy along the lines of this school, and spoke of

spreading democracy in order to revolution
ize the Middle East.
A third competitor to the Classicalists,
which might be called gradualism, notes the
failure of Bush's democracy-promotion ef
forts in the Middle Hast — Iraq's schlerotic
and genocidal democracy and Hamas' elec
tion victory in Gaza — and suggests that rad
icals have overemphasized elections at the
cost of overlooking the other elements of lib
eral democracy, such as the rule of law, a sta
ble middle class, high standards of education,
and a vibrant and free press. Rather than
overthrow dictators, the gradualists want to
slowly prepare democratic publics, or in
Barack Obama's words: "We have to be fo
cused on what are the aspirations of the peo
ple in those countries. Once those aspirations
are met, it opens up space for the kind of dem
ocratic regimes that we want."
With the Iraq war as itsposterchild.it is no
surprise that radical foreign policy is falling
out of favor. Almost everyone running for

president has basically adopted a classical ap
proach— careful diplomacy, wide alliances,
and few wars — with elements of gradual
democracy-promotion and public diplomacy
thrown in. (The possible exception is Rudy
Giuliani, whose foreign policy might be de
scribed as, "I'm the toughest cowboy on this
stage and I don't mind killing to prove it")
But no one has emphasized establishing for
mal democracy — regular contested elec
tions— as the centerpiece of their strategy
for confronting radical Islam.
This is a problem, because regular contest
ed elections just might work, and we certain
ly have yet to find any better solutions.
America has supported undemocratic
regimes in countries such as Pakistan. Saudi
Arabia and Egypt because if elections were
held tomorrow, in each country, radical Is
lamists hostile to the United States would
win. As a result, the Islamists in these coun
tries, denied of political access, have gotten
both more radical and more powerful. The
trend is toward less democratic expression
and more control over opposition, political
speech, protest, the judiciary, and political
parties.
Our gradualist policy is making us more
dependent on weaker, corrupt regimes with
stronger oppositions who hate us more. Fifty
