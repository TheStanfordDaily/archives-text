## In defense of policy 
### 
Iknow Barack Obama. Not personally, of
course, hut I can briskly recount the high
lights of his troubled childhood. Together,
the drugs, Indonesian madrasa and quest for a
racial identity make a damn g<x)d story.
But how will President Obama end the Iraq
War? Or improve our healthcare system? Or
deal with the problem of illegal immigration?
Such campaign narratives tempt us to ig
nore these questions. With this in mind, we
young people (some of us, anyway) typically
provide a policy-driven counterweight to the
empty pre-presidential biography. When a fu
ture leader finishes recounting his younger
years in New York, we politely remind him

that small groups of radical Muslims still pose
a threat to our national security. As another
candidate harps on his accomplishments as a
former prosecutor, we repeat to him that a dis
tressingly large chunk of the American popu
lation still lacks health insurance.
And it's almost 2008. Thus far. how well
have we done our job?
lake this example. In Andrew Sullivan's
article in the December 2007 issue of Atlantic
Monthly, entitled "Goodbye to All That," he
vigorously supports Obama's bid for presi
dent, which the article depicts as the inevitable
next step in a sensational American political
epic that has unfolded over the past four

decades. Describing why Obama is such an ap
pealing and potentially ideal candidate, Sulli
van writes that "it isn't about his policies as
such; it is about his person." Hnvisioning how
Obama might address the problem of radical
Islam and terrorism. Sullivan then offers an
absurd hypothetical.
"A young Pakistani Muslim is watching tel
evision and sees that this man — Barack Hus
sein Obama — is the new face of America. In
one simple image. America's soft power has
been ratcheted up not a notch, but a logarithm
(...] If you wanted the crudest but most effec-
tive weapon against the demoniza
tion of America that fuels Islamist
ideology, Obama's face gets close. It
proves them wrong about what
America is in ways no words can."
This extraordinarily condescend
ing hypothesis contains an alarmingly
significant omission. After the young
Pakistani sees Obama, he'll change
the channel to al-Jazeera. Al-
Jazeera's newscaster will remind him
that American troops continue to oc
cupy land he considers holy, that
American lawmakers continue to
support a nation he considers crimi
nal and that the young American
politician with the cheery smile and
soothing voice may invade his coun
try if he becomes president.
As the young Pakistani, I'd proba
bly still be pissed off at America. Even
if I'm not an extremist.would 1 simply
forget about concrete, omnipresent

attacks on my lifestyle, my country
and my religion solely because of
President Obama's world-famous
reconciliatory persona? Probably not.
On the other hand, will my hatred
for America subside if 1 see its next
president begin to withdraw troops
from Islamic holy lands or take con
crete steps to curb violence in the
Middle East? Maybe. Osama bin
Laden justified his 1996 "Declaration
of Jihad" on America's presence in
the "Land of the I\vo Holy Places"
and (in his view) its abysmal human
rights record abroad. "People," he
ranted, "are fully concerned about
their every day living."
Would these initiatives necessarily
benefit America? Maybe, or maybe
not. Such enormously complicated
questions hinge on a variety of com
plex policy issues, none of which will
miraculously disappear if the young
Pakistani someday watches a smiling
President Obama delivering his inau
gural address. An alarming number of
Obama's disciples, Sullivan included,
ignore these policy-related questions
entirely.

Put more simply, we need to think
harder. We need to better counter
balance our surplus of pre-presiden
tial biography with concrete discus
sions on candidates' policies. lire
some though it may be, such political
consciousness matters because radi
cal Muslims despise America as a re
sult of its foreign policy; because dis
proportionate numbers of Ameri
cans in minority communities live in
poverty as a result of concrete deci
sions in domestic policy; because
Americans of all political stripes
have become furious over the issue
of illegal immigration as a result of
various policy initiatives that have
broken down. Especially as a college
student, it's just not good enough to
declare your support for a candidate,
particularly based on a vague notion
of "who he is" or "what he repre
sents," without first considering what
he plans on doing if and when he as
sumes office.
