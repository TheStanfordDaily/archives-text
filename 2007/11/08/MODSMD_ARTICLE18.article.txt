## In defense of policy 
### 
Iknow Barack Obama. Not personally, of
course, hut I can briskly recount the high
lights of his troubled childhood. Together,
the drugs, Indonesian madrasa and quest for a
racial identity make a damn g<x)d story.
But how will President Obama end the Iraq

Obama might address the problem of radical
Islam and terrorism. Sullivan then offers an
absurd hypothetical.

one simple image. America's soft power has
