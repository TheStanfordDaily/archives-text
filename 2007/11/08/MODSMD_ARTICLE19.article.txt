Logistic constraints, not
apathy, prevents Band
presence at all games
To the editor:
Before beginning this letter, the
Stanford Band would like to say that
it hopes the Cardinal field hockey
team will have a great game 011 Sat
urday against the University of
North Carolina. We wish we could be
there.
The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band is disappoint
ed that yesterday's editorial ("Poor
reception for Stanford's field hockey
champions"] accused the Band of
poor support of Cardinal field hock
ey, based on speculation and a lack of
facts. We know that it would have
been ideal to play at the NorPac
Field Hockey Championship game,
and we would have liked to do it.The
absolute fact of the situation is that
every fall, the Band has a standing
commitment with the Athletic De
partment to play at all home football
games. Home game Saturdays are
busy for us, especially around the
time when the field hockey game
took place.
In a serious lapse of responsible
journalism, you claim that "The
Band (or even a small contingent)

could have played at the field hockey
game and then rushed over to the
stadium for the second quarter of the
football game." lliis statement is
pure speculation. No portion of the
Band could have done this. Who
would have directed that portion?
Our drum major was occupied with
the full hand, and our managers were
busy with keeping us organized and
on time, and facilitating our entry
into the stadium. Additionally, if the
Band were to send the minimum
number of musicians necessary for
playing our songs, we would be short
on numbers for playing the national
anthem and performing our pre
game field show.
These tasks may not seem like top
priorities to fans of other sports, but
they are what we do on Saturdays,
and we plan for and rehearse them
far in advance. It is unfortunate that
the field hockey championship took
place on a football day. Were it on
any other day, we could and would
have attended and played loud
enough to deafen the Cal fans.
Another disappointing example
of the poor foundation of your edito
rial was the mention of the fan who
did not get a reply from the Tree to a
request to appear at the field hockey
game. This unfairly portrays the Tree

as someone who ignores fans. You do
not mention which channels this fan
went through to contact the Tree.
Most true Stanford fans know that
the Tree is the Band's mascot, and
does not attend events without the
Band. Ihus, all requests for the Tree
are requests for the Band,and should
be made as any other request for a
Band appearance: through our man
agers. via phone or email. We were
not contacted in this way regarding
the field hockey game.
As a final statement of how much
we would have liked to play for Car
dinal field hockey, we offer the fol
lowing anecdote: Part way through
the football game, several of us
checked the field hockey score with
an i Phone. When we found out that
Stanford had pulled off the win. we
called starting goalie Madi Bell '08 to
offer our congratulations. We had to
shout over the noise of the football
game, and so that she could hear us
over her teammates' continuing cel
ebrations. The Stanford Band is
made up of Cardinal sports fans who
are often close friends of the athletes
we support. As much as we would
like to, we can't be in two places at
once.
