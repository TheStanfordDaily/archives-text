## Tuition rises over inflation College Board report finds unbalanced trend 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A recent report from the College
Board revealed that tuition rates at
both public and private universities
nationwide are rising much faster than
the national inflation rate. Stanford is
no exception, with total tuition costs
for the 2007-2008 academic year esti
mated at $34,800. up almost 5.5 per
cent from last year. The year before,
tuition rates rose approximately 5.4
percent, from $31,200 to $32,994. In
flation for consumer prices rose only
three percent nationwide during that
time.
According to Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper, the University's
policy of meeting 100 percent of a stu
dent's financial need requires that the
Financial Aid Office award more fi
nancial aid as tuition rates increase.
For this reason, the total institutional
scholarship funds available have risen
$10 million from last year to $76 mil
lion.
"In theory, for families who are re
ceiving need-based financial aid. if
their financial situation hasn't
changed, then an increase in tuition
will be met with an increased scholar
ship," Cooper said.
Having a need-blind admissions
process requires the Financial Aid Of
fice to annually re-examine the
amount of funds needed to cover the
remaining financial need of all stu
dents who qualify.
"If, all of a sudden. 100 percent of
the freshman class were on financial
aid," Cooper said, "we would have to
[cover that]."
However, as is the case with many
students who require financial aid, a
combination of changing factors —
including shifts in both tuition and the
salaries of parents — generally results
in students and parents paying a high
er portion of their tuition costs from
one year to the next.
"Typically, the expected parent

contribution goes up slightly from
year to year," Cooper said, "but the
parent contribution increases are usu
ally less than the tuition increases."
Each February, the University's
Board of Trustees coordinates with
the Office of the Provost and the Bud
get Department to set the price of tu
ition.
ITie College Board's findings have
shown that rising tuition costs at pub
lic universities are directly linked to
decreases in the amount of state and

local support they receive. For a pri
vate university like Stanford, the
amount of financial aid available to
students is generally tied to the en
dowment of the university and the
amount of gift funds the school re
ceives from donors. According to
Cooper, the biggest costs for most uni
versities lie in faculty salaries and fa
cilities maintenance.
While the Financial Aid Office
pledges to meet the needs of students
regardless of rising tuition rates, some

in the student body question whether
raising costs of attendance at a faster
rate than inflation is really just.
"I don't think there should be a
cap. but I think the interesting thing to
me is that, historically, tuition for
[Stanford] students has always been
like two steps ahead of inflation,"
Collin Duke '09 said. "1 just wish it
would track inflation."
