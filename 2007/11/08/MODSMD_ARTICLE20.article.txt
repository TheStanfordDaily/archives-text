## Speaking out against martial law in Pakistan 
### 
Like caged birds. Pakistanis today can only hum des
olate songs of hope and freedom. Their oppression
stems from the martial law imposed on the country
on Nov. 3. which marked the second 'coup' in eight years
organized and executed by the same military ruler. Presi
dent Pervez Musharraf. In October, Pakistan's Supreme
Court prepared to declare the president's recent re-elec
tion unlawful, and a scared Musharraf hastily declared
emergency rule, suspended the constitution and disband
ed the judiciary. In a particularly desperate move,
Musharraf silenced the independent media, suspended
basic civil rights and has taken steps to destroy democra
cy in the South Asian country.
Martial law has meant one dictatorial blow after an
other for the oppressed nation. In the hours since the
emergency was declared, the government has cracked
down on hundreds of activists, judges and lawyers. While
officials claim to have taken the measure in order to pro
tect the country from extremist militants, their actual ac
tions included arresting all progressive members of civil
society. In addition, the police have been indiscriminate in
their use of tear gas and batons in raiding homes and of
fices and against women, men and children.
In the United States, I am able to reflect as a lrce indi
vidual. 1 think back to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s words.
"Justice denied anywhere diminishes justice every
where," and my heart bleeds for a people who have been
robbed of their freedom. Under martial law. all human
rights that free people take for granted exist only in
dreams. Ihe freedoms of speech, movement, assembly
and belief—as well as the right to be innocent until
proven guilty — have all been ripped up with the consti

tution and cast into the fire of a power-hungry coup. As
painful pictures of peaceful protestors being brutally
beaten and locked away by the police are quietly circulat
ed across the Internet, 1 begin to realize that the law no
longer holds reprieve for the innocent.
Today, the silenced cries of despondent Pakistanis ring
in my ears and 1 stand in solidarity with them every day in
White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m. I stand to demand that
democracy be restored, that the people be allowed to exist
as the U.N. convention on human l ights states: "free and
equal in dignity." 1 stand to demand that the West take a
strong stance on the situation. I stand to mourn an op
pressed people by enjoying my right to freedom of expres
sion, something that no longer exists in the country 1 left
only a few months ago. While the oppressed voices are
drowned out by the din of an unreasonable dictatorship. 1
promise to make mine louder.
Through this piece, 1 appeal to all of you to support
this stand in solidarity with the victims of martial law; 1
ask you to write to your government representatives de
manding a strong stance on the issue. Although Mushar
raf derives much of his power through U.S. support and
aid, the American government must crack down hard on
his dictatorial regime. Finally, 1 appeal that we all be
aware of the plight of the Pakistani people, and as we
enjoy our rights as free citizens,carry with us the burden
of their oppression, until the caged birds are free to fly
again.
Join us for a candlelight vigil for the oppressed Pakista
nis tonight at 7 p.m. in the QUI Union courtyard.
