# WELCOME BACK TO THE PEDESTRIAN ZONE!
## 
### Bill Larson, Pedestrian Zone Supervisor 
I am happy to report that you have returned to an even safer Pedestri
an Zone with the addition of the two traffic circles and sidewalks on La
suen Mall and White Plaza. We ask that bicycles, vehicles, and carts
follow the correct route around these circles, and pedestrians use the
sidewalks, to avoid accidents and ensure the safety of all who share
this pedestrian mall.
We would also like to remind bicyclists to NOT ride or park their bicy
cles in the arcades such as those located at the Main Quad, Old Union,
and Green Library. The Department of Public Safety may soon begin
impounding or locking bicycles in place that are in violation of this re
striction. When this phase of enforcement begins, the bicycle owner

Have a GREAT and SAFE gear!

will be required to pay a fee to recover a bicycle that has been impound
ed or locked by the Department of Public Safety. In addition to the fee,
the bicycle will need to be licensed before it can be released in accor
dance with Santa Clara County Ordinance Section 85-19.
In closing, the Department of Public Safety, Parking & Transportation
Services, and the University Administration THANK YOU for your
continued cooperation and contribution to the success of the Pedestri
an Zone policy now in its second year.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the policy, please
feel free to email Bill Larson at: william.larson@stanford.edu
