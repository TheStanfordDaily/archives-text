## SHERMAN SIDELINED Standout receiver suspended indefinitely by Harbaugh 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Head coach Jim I larbaugh has suspended soph
omore wide receiver Richard Sherman indefinitely
for unsportsmanlike behavior during the C 'ardinal's
loss to Washington last Saturday.
Sherman was visibly irritated throughout the
second half of this weekend's game, routinely
throwing his hands over his head in a public display
of disgust. His anger manifested itself in the fourth
quarter, when he was flagged for a 15-yard person
al foul. After the penalty,Sherman was seen scream
ing at teammates and coaches on the sideline. It is
unclear what was said, and coaches eventually inter
vened before the altercation progressed any tin
ther.
"[lt] was a decision we made as a coaching stall
after this ballgame," I iarbaugh told the San I rancis
co Chronicle. I larbaugh did not elaborate much fui
ther. but did say that Sherman will not be able to
practice or participate in any other activities with
the team during his suspension.
While the length of his suspension is unknown.
Sherman will, in all likelihood, miss this Saturday's
game against Washington State.
His absence is one the Cardinal might not be
able to afford. With Sherman out and the status of
senior Mark Bradford — who has been battling
knee problems — still up in the air. the C 'ardinal re
ceiving corps will be shorthanded come Saturday.
Freshman Doug Baldwin may be forced to start his
first game at wide receiver for the Cardinal.
Additionally, Sherman is Stanford's most pro
ductive receiver. On the season, he has caught 38
passes for 646 yards and four touchdowns.
"It's a decision that all of us obviously respect,
but it's very unfortunate, because this is a big game
for us and we need Richard on the field." senior re
ceiver Evan Moore told the Chronicle.
But Moore said that in the end. the incident
would be a good educational experience for Sher
man.
"He'll learn from it." Moore told the San Jose
Mercury News. "He brings a lot of emotion to the
game. But sometimes he lets it get the best of him."
