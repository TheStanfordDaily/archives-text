# Women's Swimming
## Diving into the season Stanford handles Washington and Cal; Georgia up next 
### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's swim
ming and diving squad (2-0.1-0 Pac-10)
has been busy, coming face-to-face with
two Pac-10 rivals in the past week. Last
Saturday, the swimmers took on the
Washington Huskies (1-2,0-2 Pac-10) at
the Avery Aquatic Center in their first
official conference meet of the season.
Yesterday, the divers bounced into ac
tion against their Bay Area rivals, the
No. 3 California Golden Bears, in the
diving-only, non-conference event.
The Cardinal responded well to its
first competitions against Pacific-10
Conference foes, with the Stanford
swimmers outscoring the Huskies 116
89. Although the diving event was not
team-scored, the divers displayed some
promising performances that should
give them confidence for later in the sea
son.
The win over the I luskies was no easy
