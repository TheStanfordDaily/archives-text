# Women's Swimming
## Diving into the season Stanford handles Washington and Cal; Georgia up next 
### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's swim
ming and diving squad (2-0.1-0 Pac-10)
has been busy, coming face-to-face with
two Pac-10 rivals in the past week. Last
Saturday, the swimmers took on the
Washington Huskies (1-2,0-2 Pac-10) at
the Avery Aquatic Center in their first
official conference meet of the season.
Yesterday, the divers bounced into ac
tion against their Bay Area rivals, the
No. 3 California Golden Bears, in the
diving-only, non-conference event.
The Cardinal responded well to its
first competitions against Pacific-10
Conference foes, with the Stanford
swimmers outscoring the Huskies 116
89. Although the diving event was not
team-scored, the divers displayed some
promising performances that should
give them confidence for later in the sea
son.
The win over the I luskies was no easy

and 1 -0 in conference. Georgia comes into Fri

tween the two squads since 2001.
feat for the Cardinal swimmers, who
only maintained a 6-point lead after
6of 11 events. However,the Card ral
lied towards the end. going on to de
feat the Huskies by 27 points. Stan
ford head coach Lea Maurer was sat
isfied with the meet,despite the team
being tired from tough practices.
"We swam a different lineup and
relied on more people, and we got
better as the meet went on," said
Maurer. "We're obviously tired
[from hard workouts],but we're find
ing a way to get the win box checked,
and 1 feel that's a good place to be
right now."
Stanford managed to snag wins in
seven of the 11 events. A new pool
record was set by Stanford's 800-
yard freestyle relay team. Hie relay
squad of Julia Smit, Brooke Bishop,
Whitney Spence and Kate Dwelley
swam to a time of 7:17.08, a full three
and-a-half seconds ahead of the pre
vious record set bv Auburn Universi
ty in 2002.
"The record was good," said Mau
rer. "It's always good to put Stanford
on as the team for your own pool
records. We feel like the 800 free
relay is going to be something that
we're a more formidable opponent
in this year. It's nice to have our
swimmers look at an event and say
'O.K.,wecanget this [record],"lliat's
what champions do. They walk in a
pool, look at the board and say what
can we erase.'"
Sophomore Julia Smit took Mau
rer's champion philosophy to heart
when she won the 400-yard individ
ual medley. Even though her time of
4:09.97 was slightly short of Stanford
great Summer Sanders' pool record
of 4:08.52 set in 1992,Smit still man
aged to defeat Washington freshman
Ariana Kukors. who is currently
ranked fourth in the world in the 400-
meter individual medley. Though
early in the season. Smit's time would
have placed her sixth at last year's
NCAA Championships, as well as

second place at last years Pac-10
Championships, slightly behind her
own mark.
"It was exciting, because 1 went
faster than 1 did in any dual meet last
year," said Smit about the swim. "It
was a good point to start. I was also
pretty happy that I beat Ariana
[Kukors]. She's a really tough com
petitor, and I'm going to be racing
her at the end so I need to practice
racing her now."
Other Stanford event winners in
cluded freshman Kate Dwelley in the
KM) freestyle, junior Andrea Axtell in
the 200 backstroke, seniors Brooke
Bishop in the 50 freestyle and Caro
line Bruce in the 2(H) breaststroke,
and the 400 medley relay squad of
Bishop, Bruce, Elaine Breeden, and
Madeline Rovira. Washington swept
the three longer freestyle races —
the 200. 500, and 1000 —as well as
the 2(H) butterfly.
Meanwhile, the divers, led by
head coach Rick Schavone, were
showing their stuff against California
yesterday in the one-meter and
three-meter dives, the two events of
the day. Unlike in traditional meets,
each diver was paired with a team
mate, and their combined score was
tallied. Hie Stanford freshman duo
of Meg Hostage and Hallie lvester
joined forces to post the highest com
bined score in the 3-meter diving,
while Cal's Samantha Young and
Laura Sanford combined for the win
in the 1-meter. In the individual point
tallies, Stanford appeared dominant,
although the events were not team
scored. I lostage recorded the highest
score of the day in both the 1-meter
and 3-meter diving, and the Card oc
cupied five of the top six spots in the
3-meter event.
Both the swimmers and divers
will reconvene across the nation in
Athens. Ga., this Friday for a dual
meet against the No. 5 Georgia Bull
dogs, lhis will be the first dual meet
between the Cardinal and the
Dawgs since 2001. The meet will
take place at the Gabrielson Natato
rium in Athens at 11 a.m. PST.
