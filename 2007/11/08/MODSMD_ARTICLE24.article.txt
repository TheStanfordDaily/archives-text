tournament win of his collegiate career yester

round of the tournament, tying for the individ

ual championship with UCLA's James Lee and
Augusta State's Henrik Norlander.
"Yesterday was a good way to finish up the
fall season." Ray said. "We would have liked to
defend our CordeValle crown, but for us to
have such a solid final round was great."
Stanford concluded the tournament with a
one-under three round total of 1079 and was
the only other team besides No. 5 UCLA to
post an under-par team score. Host UCLA re
claimed the top spot in the tournament this year
by an 11-stroke margin, posting a 12-under
1068. Rounding out the top five were N0.7
Southern California in third with a seven-over
1087. No. 19 Lamar in fourth with a nine-over
1089 and unranked Augusta State in fifth with a

ten-over 1090.
"To be one of two teams to finish under par
is a great accomplishment." Ray said. "I lats off
to UCLA for beginning with a good lead and
staying tough to the end; they deserved to win.
The tournament went well for our guys and it
really gave us some momentum going into the
spring season."
Kim commenced his collegiate career on the
l ight foot as the only member of the Cardinal
golf team to notch a tournament victory this
season. I lis title was not won without hai d work
though,seeing as he started the tournament in a
tie for 34th place with a two-over first round

score of 74. Following a rough first
round, he posted a four-under 68 in
the second round and sunk a 30-foot
putt on the last hole of the final round
to give him in claiming a share of the
tournament crown.
"As a reward for winning, we let
him have two servings at lunch." Ray
joked."We are all excited for him. He

has been a great team player who
works really hard. Everyone around
him sees that it is just a matter of time
before he reaps the benefits of his tal
ent in his collegiate golf career."
Kim was not the only Cardinal
golfer to post personal bests as soph
omore Jordan Cox was one stroke
behind Kim, earning his first top five
individual finish. Cox stayed consis
tent throughout the first two rounds,
notching even par scores of 72. He
stepped up his game in the final
round when he managed to shoot
four birdies and an eagle for a career

low round of 68. Cox finished in a tie
for fourth with a four-under three
round total of 212.
"The way Jordan has played this
fall has been fantastic." Ray said.
"Jordan was the top prospect in his
class coming out of high school and
he had a tough freshman year, lie
had tremendous talent and every
round plays.he gets better and better,
lie has realized his playing ability
and his finish yesterday shows that ail
of his hard work has come to
fruition."
Sophomore Joseph Bramlett and

senior Rob Grube played a major
role in securing the Cardinal's second
place finish for the tournament. Moth
golfers finish in a tie for 20th with a
two-over score of 218. Rounding out
the Cardinal's final fall season tour
nament score was junior Dodge
Kemmer who finished in a tie for
38th with a seven-over 223.
According to Ray. the Stanford
golt team has had a solid start to its
fall season and looks to defend its
title against the top teams in the na
tion.
"If we put all the pieces together

with the group we have, we can be
strong contenders on the national
level." Ray said. " Hie road to the
NCAAs is going to be different this
year because we are a younger
team. Every time we go out there we
get more experience. Right now. we
are going to focus on our weakness
es during the off season so that we
will be ready and fired up come Feb
ruary for our first tournament of the
year."
