## The 						seven deadly fans 
### 
Upon lirst glance, it would
seem like being a sports fan
is quite easy. It's basically
just sit, watch, and cheer.
Unfortunately, there are many
people who manage to screw it up.
For example, I'm sure many of you
have been lambasted by righteous
Stanford football fans in the Red
Zone for not standing at some point
during the game. 1 would completely
understand this if the situation oc
curred while we were on defense,
and we needed to try and use our
collective force to rattle the oppos
ing team's offense.
1 lowever, people are being yelled
at for sitting down while Stanford is
on offense, or even worse, after a
timeout.
The people doing the yelling
think of themselves as the "Alpha
fans," the ones who know what is
best for all the rest of the supporters.
But these people often have no idea
what they are doing themselves.
Why should we stand up and cheer
when our team is on offense?
It makes far more sense to be
quiet st) that the players can listen
for the playcall and any possible au
dibles. And maybe it's just me. but I
don't see what standing during a
timeout accomplishes, besides mak
ing it harder for the players to con
centrate on the instructions they're
receiving.
So. in remembrance of a Hill Sim
mons column I once read entitled
"The 20 most annoying baseball
fans." 1 decided to list out the sports
fans 1 generally find most annoying.
Some of my choices are inspiicd by
Simmons' column, but I have en
countered all of these fans, and they
arc all truly annoying. So in no par
ticular order, seven other fans who
rank alongside the "Alpha fan" in
their annoyingness:
The l.oud Drunk At one
game or another, we've all probably
s;it near someone (or multiple peo
ple) who has had way too much to
drink. Not onl\ does this guy ramble
on and on about things completely
unrelated to the game at hand.but it
sounds like he's trying to communi
cate with people ten sections over.
On the bright side, one of these fel
lows once of fered to buy me a beer.
Unfortunately. I was lOyearsold.
St anding-up-and-wa ving
while-on cell phone guy — There
are two variations of this fellow.
Hie fiist is the one who is trying
to help someone else in the stadium
find him. A noble objective, but
sadly, this person seems to forget
something: crazy as it may seem, sta
diums are generally organized into
sections, rows, seats, etc. Unless the
person on the other end of the
phone has not passed first-grade
math, they should be able to find
you quite easily just given your seat
information there's no need to
stand up. wave,and block the view of
everyone sitting behind you! The
other variation of this guy is the one
who is talking to someone watching
the came on TV. and is trying to

wave at the camera. I think no fur
ther explanation is necessary.
()bnoxious opposing fan I
have nothing against supporting yout
team away from home, but you have
to recognize that you are at someone
else's home. There's no reason to
jump around and scream after every
time your team does something good
(anyone at the basketball exhibition
game against Concordia on Monda\
can tell you how annoy ing this is.) ()n
another note, how awesome would it
be to kill two biids with one stone b\
getting the Loud Drunk into a fight
with this guy, and having both ot
them thrown out of the stadium? I in
definitely going to have to try that
one day.
Mr. Way-too into timeout
shows- You know when during
timeouts, some teams have cheer
leaders throw T-shirts and such into
the crowd? 1 was in one of these mo
ments one time when I was eight
years old. I stood in excitement as
what was going to be my lii st caught
T-shirt sailed right towards me. As it
was a foot away from my hands
though, I was bowled over by an
elbow Hying from above my head. I
looked up to see a guy in his 2()s
high-living his friends with the I
shirt in his hand. I think you can
guess why I hate this fan.
The moron Irvine to sound

knowledgeable — There is almost
nothing worse than someone sitting
behind you and constantly spouting
nonsense while thinking that he is
being extremely insightful. 1 remem
ber attending one basketball game
where the guy behind me waxed po
etically for ten straight minutes
about some player's "speed-to-fi
nesse" ratio. Obviously he was not
aware of his speech's immense "stu
pidity-to-insight" ratio.
The guy who is in love with
the wave' If you try to start 'the
wave' twice and it doesn't work.just
give up. In fact, the more you plead
with us to do it with you, the less
likely we are to oblige, no matter
how cool you say it will be.
'I lie bandwagoner — lliis fan
is a bit different from the previous
ones, but is probably my least fa
vorite of them all. i'wo months ago.
they couldn't name a single player on
their supposed favorite team. Now,
all of a sudden (and magically coin
ciding with the team's playoff run),
they proclaim to be their team's
biggest fan. lor some reason, these
fans always seem to be sitting in great
seats too, which puts their annoying
quotient almost through the roof.
