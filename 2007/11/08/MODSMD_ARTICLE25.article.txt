## The
						seven deadly fans 
### 
Upon lirst glance, it would
seem like being a sports fan
is quite easy. It's basically
just sit, watch, and cheer.
Unfortunately, there are many
people who manage to screw it up.
For example, I'm sure many of you
have been lambasted by righteous
Stanford football fans in the Red
Zone for not standing at some point
during the game. 1 would completely
understand this if the situation oc
curred while we were on defense,
and we needed to try and use our
collective force to rattle the oppos
ing team's offense.
1 lowever, people are being yelled
at for sitting down while Stanford is
on offense, or even worse, after a
timeout.
The people doing the yelling
think of themselves as the "Alpha
fans," the ones who know what is
best for all the rest of the supporters.
But these people often have no idea
what they are doing themselves.
Why should we stand up and cheer
when our team is on offense?
It makes far more sense to be
quiet st) that the players can listen
for the playcall and any possible au
dibles. And maybe it's just me. but I
don't see what standing during a
timeout accomplishes, besides mak
ing it harder for the players to con
centrate on the instructions they're
receiving.
So. in remembrance of a Hill Sim
mons column I once read entitled
"The 20 most annoying baseball
fans." 1 decided to list out the sports
fans 1 generally find most annoying.
Some of my choices are inspiicd by
Simmons' column, but I have en
countered all of these fans, and they
arc all truly annoying. So in no par
ticular order, seven other fans who
rank alongside the "Alpha fan" in
their annoyingness:
