# Pac-10 title on the line
## Card faces pivotal test vs. top-ranked Huskies 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Last November, the Stanford
women's volle\ball team clinelied
its first conference title in five
years with a win over Washington
in the last week of Pac-10 play.
Even though the No. 5 Caidinal
will play four more matches after
this weekend's visit to the No. t
Huskies, this match will be just as
important in determining the Pa
cific-10 Conference winuei as it
was in 2006.
The C aidinal head north this
weekend with a chance at revenge
for a five-game loss at home earli
er this season and can make up the
one-game gap in conference
standings.
Stanford (22-2.11 -2 Pac 10) has
two losses so far this season, to
Washington and to No. (> Southern
California. 'Hie Huskies (21 I.I!
I) have lost just once, to No. «S ( al
ifornia. If Stanfoid can pull oil the
win on Washington's home court
tonight — no easy feat — and
each team wins the icst of its
matches, the conference title
would come down to a tiebreaker.
With Washington's win coming in
five games. Stanford could put it
self in a position to claim a repeat
title with a win in three or four
games.
"If we win then the two of us
are tied and they have the tougher
schedule the icst of the way." head
coach John Dunning said. "But if
they win. then they have one loss
and everyone else in the Pac-10
has at least three. (Winning the
Pac-10] could still happen, but it
would be out of our control unless
we can win."
Though both teams are a lock
for NCAA bids and high seeds,
more than bragging lights are at
stake this weekend. With a win,
the Cardinal would re enter the
top four in the national rankings.

It that were to happen, the Cardi
nal would likely be the top team in
the Stanford Regional in Decem
ber and would not need to face the
other top NCAA teams until the
I itial I our.
Winning tonight would also
break several long streaks
Stanford has not won in Seattle
since 2002 and Washington has
not lost at home in 38 matches.
The I luskies have swept every op
ponent since playing five games
against Stanford a month ago and
have not lost a single game at
home this year.
"We have struggled there the
last couple years, but we are very
ready to play this match," Dun
ning said. "We have gotten pretty
good at controlling the ball and
minimizing errors, which was not
the case last time we played them.
We made too many errors then,
but we have gotten better about
that. What we want to do is put oui
best effoi t out on the floor and if it
is good enough to beat them, then
that's gieat a good sign foi us."
I.ast week, Washington swept
Arizona and Arizona State on the
road; freshman setter Jenna llag
glund was named Pac-10 Player of
the Week, the third conference
honor in four weeks for a I lusky.
Hagglund has stepped right
into the sizeable shoes of Court
ney Thompson, who graduated
last year after leading her team to
three straight Final Fours and the
piograin's lirst national champi
onship. Hagglund averages 13.69
assists pei game, second only to
Stanford's senior setter Bryn
Kehoe in the conference.
On the other end of llagglu
nd's sets, three returning All-
Americans are leading a Washing
ton offense that has steamrolled
most of its competition. Outside
hitter Christal Morrison and mid
dle blockers Alesha Deesing and
Jessica Swarbrick lead the way,
though Stevie Mussie has certain
ly made an impression on Wash
ington's opponents, the Cardinal
in particular.
When the Huskies visited
Maples on October 12. the Cardi

nal was undefeated and Washing
ton had just lost for the first time,
in live games to California the
night before. Washington won the
lust game of the match, but Stan
foid took the next two in a row to
pull ahead. Hie Huskies evened
the match by winning the fourth
game and took that momentum
into a 15 10 fifth-game victory.
Mussie led Washington with 20
kills, most of them in the final two
frames, while Stanford's junior
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza
had 20 as well. Ilie match was
about as even as it could have
been, with the teams registering
the same number of kills, while the
Caidinal had two more blocks and
the Huskies four more digs. Ilie
biggest difference was in the serv
ing, where Hagglund recorded
five aces.
Washington's libero lamari
Miyashito dug 37 balls, while the
Cardinal's freshman libero Gabi
Ailes had a then-career-high 24.
On the season, Morrison leads
the Huskies with 2 l )0 kills while
Mussie has 253. Miyashiro has 417
digs at a pace of 5.4 per game, the
second best in the Pac-10.
lor the Cardinal, Barboza and
freshman outside hitter Alix
Klineman lead the attack with 327
and 320 kills, respectively. Junior
middle blocker I oluke Akinrade
wo is light behind them with 298
at an NCAA best .483 clip.
Kehoe's 14.10 assists per game is
also among the best averages in
the nation.
Ailes currently lias 361 digs
and needs 23 to break into the top
ten single-season digging per
formances in Stanfoid history.She
recently broke the single-match
record with 31 in a four game loss
to USC.
After tonight's battle with the
Huskies, the Cardinal will fly
across the state Friday morning to
take on Washington State (9-17,0-
12). Ilie Cougars won their first
six games of the season, hut a con
ference win has eluded them in
the perennially powerful Pac-10.
