## ASSU bike light giveaway draws more than expected 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Students lined up in White Plaza yesterday
to pick up a free bike light and Jamba Juice at
the ASSU Bike Light Extravaganza. In the
first day of the three-day extravaganza, the
Undergraduate Senate distributed over 200
free lights and smoothies to all students who
attended the event between noon and 1 p.m.

Last year's Undergraduate Senate focused
on bike safety discussing ways to promote safe
biking on campus.
"We thought it would be a great idea to do
the [Bike Light Extravaganza]," said ASSU
President Hershey Avula '08. "We had talked
about how students were lacking bike lights,

from last year's Senate for this year's Senate,"
Avula said. "We thought the most opportune
time to pass out hike lights would be at the be
ginning of the year, especially with new fresh
men on campus."
Some students attended the Extravaganza
with the goal of avoiding bike tickets, which

headlight at night.
"I don't want to get stopped by the police,
but I also don't want to pay for [a light]," said
Christopher Williams '10. "So, this solves all
my problems."
Safety concerns also inspired students to
stop by the tables in White Plaza yesterday.
"Even though the line is long, it is worth it

for safety, because I bike at night to review ses
sions and office hours," Quynh-Anh Nguyen

TUrnout for the event was higher than
ASSU senators expected.
