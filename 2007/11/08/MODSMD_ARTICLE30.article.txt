## Activist urges HBV vaccination So stresses danger, prevalence of Hepatitis B among Chinese 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
Despite outspoken public concern about a wide
spread avian flu outbreak in China, a much quieter,
more sinister killer has been at work in the East
Asian country. At last night's lecture about preven
tive healthcare in China. Samuel So. founder of the
Asian Liver Center (ALC), said that 10 percent of
the Chinese population — 130 million people —
has been infected by the I lepatitis B virus (HBV).
Of those infected by the virus, So said to an audi
ence of around 3o people, about 30 to 40 million will
die from acute liver failure, liver damage or liver
cancer.
According to So. HBV is "one of the most neg
lected major health threats in the world."
"Between 350 to 400 million people across the
world have been chronically infected by HBV.com
pared to 40 million people living with HIV." he said.
"Avian flu has killed only 16 people in China since
2003 and the government has been vaccinating
every duck and chicken."
Speaking at last night's event hosted by the
Forum for American/Chinese Exchange at Stanford
(FACES), So added that the negligence of HBV
eradication efforts across the world serves as a per
fect example of how "healthcare is sometimes
placed on where the hype is and not where the needs
are."
After former U.S. president Bill Clinton visited
China on a mission to educate the population about
AIDS in 2005, posters about 111 VIA IDS prevention
started popping up everywhere as the government
launched a full-fledged effort to combat the mount
ing epidemic.
"The problem with HBV is that we have no sexy,
attractive person — no celebrity to champion our
cause," So said.
HBV is an extremely potent virus, about 100
times more infectious than HIV, and it is able to sur
vive in external environments for around a week.
Unlike HI V, the vaccine for HBV has existed for

over two decades. But in countries such as China,
areas of Latin America and almost the entire
African continent, there has been little implementa
tion of the inoculation.
"Can you imagine if we had an HIV vaccine, but
we weren't giving it to the people of sub-Saharan
Africa," said Julie Len '07, who worked with ALC in
China. "That's horrible, right?"
According to So, the rise of the epidemic in China
could be attributed to the fact that the government
never really had a comprehensive strategy for pre
ventive healthcare. Also, unsafe medical practices
— such as the reuse of dirty syringes — and trans
mission from mother to child, exasperated the prob
lem.

Due to lack of education about the virus, many
Chinese hold stigmatized views of the disease and
those who carry it. People often mistakenly believe
that HBV can be transmitted through handshaking
or sharing of food, and individuals affected by the
disease are often discriminated against in the work
place.
"HBV cannot be transmitted by food unless
you're bleeding in your food " So said. "And.it can't
be transmitted through kissing unless you draw
blood every time you kiss."
Through his work with ALC, So has helped to
vaccinate 56,000 grade-school children in the rural
Qinghai province, where access to healthcare and
medical equipment is limited.
After the Chinese government recognized the
success of So s pilot project in Qinghai, it offered to
provide $2 million in funding so that he could ex
pand his project to vaccinate and educate over
500,000 children in that province.
So said that he hopes the government will realize
how cheap and easy it is to vaccinate children using
the ALC model and ultimately implement the plan
throughout the rest of the country. He also urged the
audience to raise awareness about the disease so
that extensive vaccination efforts and education
would one day eradicate the virus.
