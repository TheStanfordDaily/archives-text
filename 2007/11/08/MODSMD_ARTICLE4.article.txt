## GSC approves ASSU airport shuttle funds ASSU plans for service to be self-sustainable 
### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) approved $2,706 last night
to co-sponsor the ASSU Airport
Shuttle service for graduate and
undergraduate students who plan
to leave campus for Thanksgiving
break, which begins next Friday.
The money will come from the
Graduate Student General Fee Re
serve.
Shuttles will be traveling to both
San Jose and San Francisco Inter
national Airports on Friday . Nov.
16 and Saturday. Nov. 17. The serv
ice will run from 5 a.m. until 6 p.m.,
according to ASSU President Her
shey Avula '08. The cost of each
ticket is $10.
Starting today, shuttle tickets
are available to all students on the
Stanford Student Enterprises
eGroups Web site (http://egroups.
stanford.edu), which also provides
details including exact shuttle de

parture times. The ASSU Web site
also provides a map with the shuttle
routes and pick-up stops across
campus, Avula said.
"We encourage students to
book their shuttle tickets at least
three hours in advance of their
flight departure time," he added.
According to Avula, the archi
tects of the ASSU Airport Shuttle
service concept have agreed that in
the future this student service
should become self-sustainable,
rather than relying on continual
sourcing from the GSC Fee Re
serve.
The reserve account is rarely
used, and it reflects unused funds
that have been rolled over from the
end of each fiscal year.
However, the money requested
this year to the council was lower
than in the past,said Kristina Keat
ing. a doctoral student in the
School of Earth Sciences and co
chair of the GSC. In addition, the
ASSU is using part of the money
garnered from spring shuttle rev
enues to help subsidize the service.
Avula said.
"And all the money that we get
from students who buy these [shut
tle] tickets is going to come back to
fund the program in the future," he
said.
Whatever disbursed funds remain
after the end of the pilot effort will be

rolled back into the Graduate Student
and Undergraduate General Fee Re
serve Account, according to the bill
approved last night by the GSC.
Avula said that the total cost of the
ASSU Airport Shuttle service pilot is
approximately $7,2(X) and the service
capacity should be about I.(KX) stu
dents.
