## 
### JULIE KLEIN MANAGING EDITOR 
This week, the entire Stanford
community gets the chance to
Beat Cal and upset Southern
California through the Pac-10 Fit
ness Challenge. Based on online logs of daily
exercise, Stanford was in first place as of 11:30
p.m. last night, just ahead of Washington
State; the other eight conference schools
lagged far behind.
In its first year, the Challenge tracks
• ~i . l 1-. j 4.

physical activity levels among students,
faculty, staff and alumni on a WSU-host
ed Weh site.Through Friday, participants
can lo" on to the site and record up to

two hours of activity each day in an ef
fort to declare their school the most
( active Pacific-10 Conference uni
versity.

"Let's log what we're doing
because we're such an active stu
dent body." said Senior Associate
Athletic Director Eric Stein, encour
aging all community members to
participate in the weeklong chal
lenge.

The initiative follows a June
conference in Los Angeles, during which
athletic coordinators from the Pac-10 schools
discussed their goals for promoting healthy

lifestyles.
"All the schools are working on developing or
implementing university-wide wellness pro
grams, like BeWell@Stanford." said Jennifer
Sexton, coordinator of fitness and wellness pro
grams.
"We wanted to do an event around wellness,"
she added,"something fun that students and fac
ulty can buy into."
The Challenge limits participants to two
hours per day. as it is meant to track regular ac
tivity levels on campus. These logged hours are
then converted to weighted miles to account for
population differences among the schools.
"We are not trying to encourage over-exercis
ing," Stein said. "We don't want it to go too far."
Steven DiPaolo. coordinator of marketing
and assistant coordinator of facilities in the de
partment of physical education and recreation,
emphasized that the program is not catered to a
specific segment of the community.
"The challenge is not limited to anyone." he
said. "It encompasses all of campus."
Winning the competition will (inly bring brag
ging rights within the Pac-lO.but Stanford partic
ipants also have the chance of winning an iPod
nano at the end of the week, as all registered con
tributors will be placed in a random drawing.
