November 8, 1982: Exotic stolen goods
located
Police made the largest recovery of stolen goods in Stan
ford history last Thursday, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Stolen property estimated at $750,000 was recovered
from the home of a La Honda couple, Robert and Maureen
O'Connor, who may have been involved in more than 130
Midpeninsula burglaries, including those of at least 30 Stan
ford residences.The losses from the burglaries during the last
two years amount to more than $2.5 million.
An area-wide all points bulletin has been issued for O'-
Connor, who successfully fled on foot from his home when
officers arrived to question his wife Thursday, said Stanford
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. who has directed the investigation.
Maureen O'Connor was arrested at the scene.
Robert O'Connor is still at large. Police should have a
warrant for his arrest today.
Niemeyer, Stanford Sgt. Nick Bruno, FBI agent Mike
Keeley and Detective Elizabeth Martin of the Palo Alto Po
lice Department went to the La Honda residence. "When we
knocked on the front door, we saw the man believed to be
O'Connor move to the rear, then bolt out of the house like a
hornet."
After observing suitcases with owner's names, art objects,
expensive photographic equipment, firearms, valuable rugs,
furs and jewelry, they obtained a search warrant, returned to
the house with a U-Haul truck and spent 12 hours filling it
with the stolen property.
"He was a professional in it for the money," Niemeyer
said. "He knew this area was affluent. People travel around
the world collecting, and he'd collect from them."
The burglar, who cases houses by innocuously jogging
around the area at night, is described as an athletic, white
male, five-feet, 11 inches tall, 39 years old, 150 pounds, with
curly brown hair, a mustache and beard, and a large space be
tween his front teeth.
