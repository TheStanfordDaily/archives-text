## 'The Bacchae' BACKSTAGE Residency brings celebrated director Akalaitis to campus 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
For two weeks this fall, a
taste of big city theater will
be brought to the Farm. As
part t>l the New York Pub
lic Theater residency, highly ac
claimed director and five-time
Obie Award winner JoAnne
Akalaitis will workshop her new
production of " I"he Bacchae," a
Euripidean tragedy,between Oct.
29 and Nov. 11.
The residency, in its third year,
aims to create new networks, sup
port emerging and established
artists, cultivate new audiences
and foster innovation, according
to Jonathan Berger, associate
professor of music and co-direc
tor of the Stanford Institute for
Creativity in the Arts.
"It defines the spirit of the
Arts Initiative [of the Stanford
Challenge]," he said.
For Akalaitis. coming to Stan
ford was a return of sorts, as she
was a doctoral student in philoso
phy here. After one year in the
Ph.D. program, she left to pursue
a career in theater.
"I had always felt drawn to the
theater, but I didn't really make a
commitment," she said. "When I
was at Stanford 1 decided I had to
really make a commitment and
do what I really wanted to do,
which was theater."
Since making that commit
ment. Akalaitis has served as
artistic director of the New York
Shakespeare Festival, artist in
residence at the Court Theater
and co-founder of avant-garde
theater company Mabou Mines,
in addition to staging works
across the country.
"It's my life," she said of the
theater."l'm very, very lucky and
1 just have a wonderful time doing
it. It's very stimulating intellectu
ally and emotionally."
Akalaitis is no newcomer to
workshopping plays, calling the
experience "really valuable."
"You get to really work on the
script without the pressure of
public performance," she said. "A
paying audience with critics is not
coming to see a finished perform
ance; they're coming to see an
open rehearsal. I think it's a won
derful concept and that it really
works."

Akalaitis said that the work
shop experience was similar to pri
vate rehearsals, except with the

added benefit of working away from home

"You don't have the business of your daily life;
you're staying at a hotel where someone makes your
bed " she said. "Tliat can be liberating because all we
have to do is think about the play."
Actor Rocco Sisto agreed that the lack of distrac
tions was both luxurious and rare.

"This is a great opportunity to concentrate in a very
specific way, without the other hindrances of living in
New York City or wherever you live and trying to keep
the business aspect of your existence going," Sisto said.
"It's good to separate all that and just concentrate on
the text."
"The Bacchae" workshop productions also include
two students — Alex Mallorv 'OS as second assistant di-

rector and Amin HI Gamal '08 as a
member of the cast. With the excep
tion of Mallory, El Gamal and the
theater staff, the production is entire
ly composed of professional stage
managers and actors, including artis
tic director Oskar Eustis, dramaturg
Jim Leverett, translator Nicholas
Rudall. choreographer David Neu
mann and lighting designer Jennifer
Tipton.
"It's really exciting to even be in
the same room for that period of time
with people who do this professional
ly," said El Gamal. "I was afraid the
first rehearsal because the system of
academic theater is very different
from professional theater — 1 was re
ally eager to see what it was like."
Working with Akalaitis in re
hearsals, El Gamal said, has been an
incredible learning experience for
him.
"She's very harsh in her notes
and very direct, but it's all in the con
text of improving the work," he said.
"She's very measured and extremely
intelligent.
"There's just an incredible
amount of focus that goes on in these
rehearsals," he continued."Getting to
work on that level is really invigorat
ing, and it's fascinating to watch these
people work."
"The Bacchae," one of 17
tragedies by Euripides to have sur
vived intact, recounts the Greek god
Dionysus taking revenge on Thebes,
the city where his mortal mother
Semele endured a cruel death. While
the text may be almost 3,000 years
old. Sisto asserted its themes will still
resonate with a modern audience.
"It deals with basic questions of
existence," he said."What are the ram
ifications of divinity? 1 low does socie
ty see itself in relation to God? It goes
into questions that are basic to us."
Mallory. in a blog post connected
to the residency, agreed that audience
members would enjoy the produc
tion.
"I think the audience will feel
comfortable with the language and
will relax into being told a story." she
said.
The residency, sponsored by
Stanford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts. Stanford Lively Arts, Insti
tute for Diversity in the Arts and the
Department of Drama, features
events including panels, classes and
dorm salons. Open rehearsals of the
work in process will be held today,
and Saturday, with a sympo
sium Saturday to accompany the
workshop production. (More event

"Ilie campus community gets to interact at all levels
— in the theater, in the classroom and in the residences
— with these superb artists," Berger said. "Judging by
the successes of the past residencies, this is an opportu
nity to witness history in the arts."
