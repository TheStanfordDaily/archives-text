'Pomp and Circumsiance: Cities in a Maya l andscape '
In tins lecture K Anne l>yburn will consider commercialism as
a stimulus to the development of ancient Maya cities She si lifts focus
from production and prestige economy, which have been the sub
ject of much archaeological reasearch and tneori/;ng, to consump
tion by ordinary households, which is less often discussed Professor
Pyburn does not propose consumerism as a pr ime mover for the rise
of cities, nor does she visualize ancient Maya traders as canoe - born
capitalists She proposes that consumer culture is not exclusively a
product of modern capitalism (contra Campbell 1987, Met racken
1988 and others), and that certain archaeological patterns suggest
rhata healthy trade in commodities contributed to Maya urbanism
