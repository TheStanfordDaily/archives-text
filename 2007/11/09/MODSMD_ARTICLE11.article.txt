# What's on your iPod?

Everything from Hindi music to
Norah Jones to Queen to Kanye
West, and even some good 'ol Ken
ney Chesney.

If you see me around campus
early on in the day or at the gym I am
usuall/ listening to my "Work It Out"
playlist, which usually consists of
high energy hip-hop dance music
and a whole lot of Chris Brown.
If you see me looking a bit tense
walking to my office or into a meet
ing with my headphones on I am
usually listening to my "Mellow"
playlist, largely John Mayer, Norah
Jones and Switchfoot — three
amazing artists that help me relax
and go to sleep.
If you see me just quietly smiling
on a sunny day as I am walking
around campus listening to my
iPod, I'm probably listening to
music that's uplifting or that re
minds me of home, such as Hindi
film songs and country/bluegrass.
In general, because I love to
dance and sing while listening to my
iPod, a lot of the music I have is
conducive to either dancing or
singing. I also use my iPod to watch
some of my favorite T.V shows like
"Scrubs," "Lost," "Heroes" and
"The Office."

I'm mostly listening to jazz these
days: Kenny Barron, Charlie
Haden, Regina Carter, Bill Charlop,
Tord Gustaffson and a lot of the
classics — Coltrane, Lester Young,
Miles, Johnny Hartman.
Among many others, I find my
self returning to Leonard Cohen,
Bruce Springsteen, Dylan and my
most recent passion, Jolie Holland.
