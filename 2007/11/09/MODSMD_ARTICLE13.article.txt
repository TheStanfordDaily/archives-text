## Sweat-Free Campaign gets a revival 
### KAMIL DADA ANA DIAZHERNANDEZ 
The Sweat-Free Stanford Cam
paign revamped its movement yester
day at noon with a protest in White
Plaza. The demonstration, which was
organized by the Stanford Asian
American Activism Committee
(SAAAC),coincided with the Nation
al Sweat-Free Day of Action.
Twenty-eight colleges and 15 high
schools rallied to show solidarity for
the issue, according to event organizer
Nicole Pepperl '09.
"We are calling on Stanford to be
socially responsible," she said at the
rally. "Our campus should reflect our
morals as a higher institution. As stu
dents, we have the power to lead the
University in a morally responsible di
rection."
The Sweat-Free Stanford Cam
paign aims to encourage Stanford to
permanently join the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC) and Designated
Suppliers Program (DSP). Through
independent monitoring and a factory
certification process, the WRC and
DSP ensure that factory conditions do
not violate human rights.
Pepperl told The Daily that 175
American universities have joined the
WRC and 36 have joined the DSP. She
said that Stanford is currently affiliat
ed with the WRC monitoring organi
zation.
"We see our campaign's mission as
half-completed." Pepperl said. "Stan
ford has joined the WRC, at least tem
porarily. With monitoring, we will
know where the problems are and
have a better sense of what we can do
to fix them."
Stanford, however, has only joined
the WRC for one year and will decide
to renew its membership on an annual
basis.
"One of our biggest concerns with
Stanford joining on a yearly basis is
that one year will not be enough time
for monitoring of the factories to
occur," Pepperl said."The campaign is
staying active to ensure that Stanford
does not leave the WRC after one
year."
"The administration has showed
interest in collaborating," said Pahua

Cha, '10, a member of SAAAC. "I
think it's important that students don't
seem to understand that we still need
a lot of help in continuing and actually
implementing the new policies."
Members from other student or
ganizations also protested at the rally.
"Apathy is not a substitute for in
formed disagreement," said Bernard
Fraga '08, co-chair of Movimiento Es
tudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA). "This is one of the biggest
issues our campus faces."
"1 personally think it's embarrass
ing that students haven't [been] in
formed." he added. "It's a real shame
that most students prefer to be apa
thetic rather than learn more about
the issue."
"Stanford makes a huge profit off

apparel and there is no reason for
them not to pay their workers reason
able wages," added Daniel Weissman,
a third-year physics graduate student
and member of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC).
Though only a few dozen students
attended the rally, Zev Kvitky, 1 lead
of the United Stanford Workers, said
he had confidence in the movement.
"It is important that students are
trying to be the conscience at Stan
ford," he said. "If Stanford is going to
be a source of good for the world then
social conscience should start on cam
pus."
Last night, in conjunction with the
rally, SAAAC screened the documen
tary "Made in L.A." and held a
discussion with Economics Profs.

Arindrajit Dube and Ethan Kaplan
from UC-Berkeley. focusing on the
economics of sweatshops.
Ihe group also discussed how an
international coalition could ensure a
unified wage.
"There are strong hesitations
about international labor standards
from economists," Dube said."The co
ordination of international labor
unions is just as problematic as coun
trywide labor union coalitions.
"It is very difficult to achieve and
one needs to think about which mem
bers of a country would take the steps
needed," he added. "For instance,
NGOs could be one of the driving
forces."

Protesters from the Sweat-Free Stanford Campaign rallied in White Plaza at noon yesterday for the National Sweat-Free
Day of Action. The event was accompanied by the screening of a documentary film advocating labor rights last night.
"The focus of our campaign is to
give people a voice," added SAAAC
member Theresa Zhen *09, who mod
erated the discussion. "Especially in
third world countries, where our
clothing is being made, workers may
not have the opportunity or ability to
raise their own voices. There is no ap
paratus in place to protect workers'
rights."
