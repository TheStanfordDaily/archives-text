## Bar Assoc. leader critiques legal profession 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
American Bar Association pres
ident Bill Neukom J.D. '67 de
scribed challenges facing the legal
profession last night, urging mem
bers of the Stanford community to
tackle these issues through interdis
ciplinary efforts.
In a lecture hosted by the Stan
ford Center for Ethics, the former
executive vice president and gener
al counsel for Microsoft raised con
cerns about the role of ethics in the
contemporary legal profession.
"Are we still a profession that
puts service to clients first?" he
asked. "Do we place our duty to
clients over discretionary time to do

other things, over monetary com
pensation? Do we still always say to
ourselves:'l'm in this profession to
serve clients.'"
Neukom challenged members of
the audience to ask themselves how
lawyers were doing as "stewards of
justice," stating that 80 percent of
people who fit into poverty guide
lines have no access to civil justice.
"These people are just simply
locked out," he said. "This means
that the government is less likely to
be provoked or motivated to find
the root of poverty and do some
thing about it."
Neukom's criticism of corrup
tion in the legal system didn't stop
there. He partially blamed lawyers
for corporate scandals involving

Enron and other large companies.
"Part of the fault lies with the
fact that those companies didn't
have real consigliere. lawyers that
would stand up to a scheme that
would make a Chief Executive Of
ficer disproportionally rich," he
said.
Neukorn also expressed concern
over the lack of diversity among
lawyers. He said that the legal pro
fession lacks representation in
terms of racial and ethnic minori
ties, women, the mentally and phys
ically handicapped and LGBT com
munities.
Neukom said that African-
American. Asian-American and
Latino-American lawyers com
bined only account for 10 percent of

the legal profession.
" ITie statistics are discouraging,"
he said. "Compared to other profes
sions, legal is lagging seriously. In
accounting and auditing it's 21 per
cent [African-American, Asian-
American and Latino-American].
In medicine it's 24 percent and in
the professorial ranks it's 18 per
cent. Those arc better numbers than
ours and we need to do something
about that â€” the sooner the bet
ter."
The speaker also urged legal
professionals to be wise in the ways
they use technology for their pro
fession.
