Why do many Europeans have the
convenience of traveling by train
from city to city as they please
while we do not? As rail travel is less stress
ful and expensive than flying and less time
consuming than driving, it appears that
Americans are shortchanged when it comes
to enjoying efficient, flexible and environ
mentally-friendly public transportation al
ternatives. There are examples of praise
worthy subway systems in cities such as
New York, and railways effectively connect
Eastern Seaboard cities such as Washington
and Boston, but the vast majority of Amer
icans simply cannot consider rail travel a vi
able option. While it is true that America's
geography is wholly unlike that of rail
laden Europe or Japan, there is evidence
that disappointing consumer preferences
have left an underrated U.S. rail system cold
and dead.
As America restructured its transporta
tion networks in previous decades, major
cities replaced public transit systems with
road networks, confident that the car would
emerge as the ultimate form of future trans
portation.The rapidly increasing population
of drivers has since contributed to urban
congestion and pollution.but a recent resur
gence of investment in public transit can't
seem to reverse the American love for driv
ing and the open road. A general apathy to
wards rail transportation has apparently
been fused into our genes.
Even in what would appear to be one of
the most green-friendly areas in the country,
the San Francisco Bay Area, the public rail
network is much less popular than expected.
Two rather loosely integrated systems, Cal
train and BART, largely leave Peninsula and
East Bay residents on their respective sides

of the waterfront. A handful of bridges serve
as clogged pulmonary vessels that barely
allow the two lungs of the Bay to breath
through the smog of commuter traffic.
There was hope that the BARF system
could extend its network around the south
bay to complete a full circuit, but the dearth
of passengers has left such ambitions finan
cially unsound. Caltrain perennially faces
revenue deficits and has continuously hiked
ticket prices. The result is fewer passengers,
higher prices and a very unpleasant cycle.
A centralized network connecting our
massive country may be simply unfeasible,
but even in many regions outside the Bay
Area, the construction of rail transportation
should prove highly economical. Consider
the possibilities of light rail running down
the eastern coast of Florida or between all
the major Midwestern cities around the
Great Lakes.The most relevant example for
Stanford students and local residents would
be a high-speed rail link between San Fran
cisco and l.os Angeles.This link would elim
inate the dilemma between exhausting 6-
hour drives or inconvenient, hour-long
flights that never quite feel worth the trou
ble.
Although short-term prospects do not
seem hopeful, a San Franscisco-Los Angeles
high-speed rail route is indeed being dis
cussed by transportation authorities. If the
project can raise enough money â€” a con
cern given the state's recent financial woes
then California residents can expect to
enjoy the comfort and safety of rail travel
within the next decade or so. Until then, let
us students do what we can. take advantage
of the rail options we have and use Caltrain
to get to San Francisco or the BART to get
to the East Bay.
