# Burning Down the House
## Remember, remember every other day of the year 
### 
Put down "Atlas Shrugged." 1 have
something I need to tell you. Ron
Paul's presidential campaign is a flash
in the pan. Yes, the $4.2 million raised in a
day is undeniably impressive, but he'll be
lucky to come in above 3rd place in a single
primary. It's possible for a candidate to be si
multaneously deeply appealing to a small
number of people (like, say. the 37,000 who
gave him money on Nov 5) and completely
out of sync with everyone else. Not only are
those 37,000 donors not a random sample,
they're the precise opposite.
Paul is.more or less,a libertarian.Though
he has some distinctly un-libertarian posi
tions like being anti-immigration,anti-abor
tion and anti-free trade, the basic deal is that
he's not fond of the federal government.
Obviously, there's something to be said
for people getting involved at the grassroots
level and supporting the candidate they be
lieve in with what they have. It's how cam
paigns should be. But when Ron Paul loses,
it won't be because the system was rigged.
It'll be because most regular people would
actually be harmed by a Paul presidency.
ITiere's a phenomenon observed in so
cial psychology called "the false consensus
effect." The gist of it is that everyone thinks
that everyone else pretty much agrees with
them. Libertarianism is too solipsistic to rec
ognize that it is legitimately unappealing,
and the Paul campaign is a vehicle for its
supporters' self-indulgence. Caught up in
the fun of a political insurgency, the Paul
people are mistaking their own excitement
for the substance of a real, broad-based po
litical movement.This, 1 suspect, is why Paul
supporters are so notoriously eager to write
defensive comments to anyone who bashes
their guy: deep down, they must know that
his message is not a universal one.
Ayn Rand said."To be able to say 'I love
you,' one must first be able to say the'l.'" In
deed. Equally true, however, is that in order
to say, "I detest libertarianism as shallow
self-indulgence." one must also first be able
to say the "1."
The self-absorbed nature of both the
campaign and the libertarian philosophy it
self are inseparable. Libertarianism flatters
its adherents; it panders to their worst ten
dencies. Just recall the premise of Rand's
Atlas Shrugged. For those who have lacked
the temerity to wade through it. it's that all
the "individuals of the mind" go on strike,
tired of being exploited by those who, you
know, work and stuff.
I'm writing this at 8.45 p.m. in room 303
of Sweet Hall. Just outside the door is a
woman whose job it is to clean this place at
night while I sit here doing what Rand might
call "work of the mind." I don't know the

cleaner's name, but 1 see her here every
week, doing her job quietly and methodical
ly. Ask yourself: who's got it easier? If some
one's getting exploited here, can you say
with a straight face that it's me? Would you
trade lives and careers with this woman if
you could, and isn't that a pretty good meas
ure of where the power lies? There's dignity
in her work, but at its core, libertarianism
mocks her. It says that what she gets is what
she deserves, and for her fellow citizens to
intervene on her behalf through state power
is actually oppressive.
In Wednesday's Daily, Mark Kogan
wrote a piece called "Remember, remember
this fifth of November," describing the Paul
campaign's fundraiser: "It said loudly and
clearly, without hesitation or misgivings, that
we. the American people, have had enough
and that we will be heard." I've had enough
of a lot of things too, but Paul doesn't speak
for me, and I 'm going to go out on a limb and
guess that he doesn't speak for the woman
cleaning Sweet Hall either.
There's something too perfect about the
choice of Guy Fawkes Day (Nov. 5) for the
Ron Paul fundraiser. Guy Fawkes, remem
ber, (remember), tried to blow up Parlia
ment. the seat of nascent democracy. The
holiday celebrates his failure, yet he's a hero
for the Paulistas. 1 suspect that they're mix
ing up the real Guy Fawkes — a Catholic ji
hadist against British democracy — with V.
from"V for Vendetta." But this doesn't
work either: in its original comic form, the
story used fawkes ironically for a thinly
veiled attack on Margaret Thatcher, she of
libertarian economics. Oops!
Exactly what.then,are we supposed to re
member, remember about the Fifth of No
vember? Because if I had to guess. I'd say that
Paul supporters truly intend to identify not
with Guy Fawkes, or even V from the comic,
but V from the movie "V for Vendetta." And
what they like about him is that he takes it on
himself to liberate the masses who are too
stultified to do it for themselves. I .ibertarian
ism ends up sounding an awful lot. oddly, like
Leninism: Its adherents must act on behalf of
everyone else, because, fools that we are. we
don't know our own best interest.
