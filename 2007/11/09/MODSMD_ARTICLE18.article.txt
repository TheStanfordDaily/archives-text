The entire world is getting indexed,

the Human Genome Project â€” a
worthy cause. They soon moved on to a
mouse, a dog, a cat, a chicken, a chimp and
a wallaby. They have sequenced the poplar
tree, the potato, the tomato, the purple
spined sea urchin and red bread mold.The
International Grape Genome Project is
processing grape genomes to better under
stand the genetics behind grape biology.
Google is in the throes of its monumen
tal Hook Project. So far. over a million
books have been scanned and digitized
though legal battles over copyright in
fringement are brewing in Michael Vick
dogfight proportions). The Open Content
Alliance is undertaking a non-profit paral
lel project to Google's.
Pandora's Music Genome Project uses

musical experts to assign hundreds of char
acteristics, or "genes" to each song, such as
major key tonality, acoustic rhythm guitars
or folk influence.These genes then make up
the song's vector which, using a distance
formula, creates an algorithm that gener
ates a list of similar-sounding songs.
And that'sjust the beginning. With auto
matic number plate recognition (so-called
AN PR), cameras can scan for license
plates. Some law enforcement agencies al

ready have the technology and are auto
matically alerted when their cameras find
stolen car plates. Electronic toll collectors
use the technology to read and record who,
or rather, who didn't, pay. In Stockholm,
they use AN PR to enforce a congestion tax
on certain high-traffic roadways; London
has a similar charge zone policy. U.S. city of
ficials are working toward using the tech
nology to track cars at certain points on
major freeways. This allows authorities to
calculate real-time travel time averages, de
rive information on traffic and even catch
speeders.
Google is photographing the world with
its 360 Streetside Views. Amazon tracks
and records all of the things you buy and
then e-mails you similar products' an-
