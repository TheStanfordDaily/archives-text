## Index the index

The entire world is getting indexed,
archived, digitized, 112 irst there was
the Human Genome Project — a
worthy cause. They soon moved on to a
mouse, a dog, a cat, a chicken, a chimp and
a wallaby. They have sequenced the poplar
tree, the potato, the tomato, the purple
spined sea urchin and red bread mold.The
International Grape Genome Project is
processing grape genomes to better under
stand the genetics behind grape biology.
Google is in the throes of its monumen
tal Hook Project. So far. over a million
books have been scanned and digitized
though legal battles over copyright in
fringement are brewing in Michael Vick
dogfight proportions). The Open Content
Alliance is undertaking a non-profit paral
lel project to Google's.
Pandora's Music Genome Project uses

musical experts to assign hundreds of char
acteristics, or "genes" to each song, such as
major key tonality, acoustic rhythm guitars
or folk influence.These genes then make up
the song's vector which, using a distance
formula, creates an algorithm that gener
ates a list of similar-sounding songs.
And that'sjust the beginning. With auto
matic number plate recognition (so-called
AN PR), cameras can scan for license
plates. Some law enforcement agencies al

ready have the technology and are auto
matically alerted when their cameras find
stolen car plates. Electronic toll collectors
use the technology to read and record who,
or rather, who didn't, pay. In Stockholm,
they use AN PR to enforce a congestion tax
on certain high-traffic roadways; London
has a similar charge zone policy. U.S. city of
ficials are working toward using the tech
nology to track cars at certain points on
major freeways. This allows authorities to
calculate real-time travel time averages, de
rive information on traffic and even catch
speeders.
Google is photographing the world with
its 360 Streetside Views. Amazon tracks
and records all of the things you buy and
then e-mails you similar products' an-

nouncements. Many ski resorts scan
tickets and know how often and
how fast you ski which lifts. Face
book uses smart technology to
compile data on who you've been
stalking to create a newsfeed with
tidbits on people you are more like
ly to be more interested in and keep
stalking.
Stanford is on the indexing
wagon train database parade, too.
Not only does Stanford tape many
of its largest lectures, but it also is
now recording and presenting talks,
presentations and speeches by (rel
atively) famous people.
What are we doing with all the
databases? How long do roadside
cameras store the exact time 1
crossed the Dumbarton? Do we

continue mapping genomes until
every plant and animal in the world
is broken down into A's,G's,T's and
C's? Until each person's genome is
mapped?
Suddenly 1 feel trapped in one of
Borges' hexagonal rooms, trying to
read and make sense of the endless
volumes stacked on its four tower
ing bookshelves, lliere are endless
pages of 000 sand Ills recording
every person's movements each
day — where they went, what they
listened to, what blue square run
they took too long to tumble down.
Clearly, a lot of this data-mining
is very useful. 1 am utterly captivat
ed by Pandora and turn it on at any
free moment, scribbling down
names of bands and song titles that
catch my ear. It lets me not only
hear lesser-known songs of well
known bands, sans commercials,
but it also plays new bands of a sim
ilar sound 1 haven't yet heard.
(Jesus, you would think this is an ad

for them. Well, just F.Y.I. Pandora,
I'm graduating soon, am a double
major in English and art. am pas
sionate about music...)
1 derive creepy, oh-so-voyeuris
tic joy from checking out Google's
Stanford street views. ( 1 once, al
most-too-strangely, saw someone 1
knew in one of the Stanford shots.)
I research almost entirely using
Socrates' on-line journals. And. if 1
commuted to and from San Fran, I
would use Fast Track and would
want those cheating, non-paying
mofos to get their plates scanned
and bumper-butts fined.
How democratizing is the whole
idea, anyway! The books of the
world are at our fingertips, for re
search. for keyword searching, for
anyone to read and enjoy. Livery
one can listen to music, see art and
learn from world-class professors
and speakers.
Besides, I would like to know
how long it took me to get down

Christmas Tree Gully — I swear I
was flying. This is what civilizations
do. We learn from the past, carve it
into wood, scrawl it on cave walls
and then start remembering stuff
that happened before old Gran
daddy One-eye died.
1 wonder, though, when we'll
need to start indexing our indexes
that will in fact actually be indexing
the actual data? When will the map
of the world become larger than the
world?
By then, the iPod will have be
come as large as a pinhole, the
moon will have 360 views of its
craters and we will have discovered
a whole other planet, both to map
and to hold the maps we've already
made.

Katie is trying to index who reads her
column, and when. She would appre
ciate if you e-mailed her your name,
time and location at kttaylor@stan
ford.edu.
