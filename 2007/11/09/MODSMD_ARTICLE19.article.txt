## Stanford Blood Center: Please stop hiring vampire callers 
### 
My phone rang hist Wednesday during
Hunißio lecture. Smack-dab in the
middle — we're talking 9:34 a.m. I
let it go to voicemail and dealt with it after
class.
It was an unknown 650 number. I thought
to myself that there are cxactly three groups
of people who would be making a phone call
at such an hour: controlling parents, drug
dealers and over-possessive girlfriends. This
call was from none of the above.
Message: "Hello, Mr. Hillard. This is the
Stanford Blood Center. We haven't chatted
in some time."
My brain: Odd. I don't remember ever
"chatting" with the Stanford Blood Center.
And wow. this guy sounds somewhat like a
reanimated corpsc.
Message: "We've noticed that as of today,
you're eligible to give blood again. And we
would be delighted if you were to give blood
again"

My brain: These people pay such close at
tention! I"he very day that 1 am eligible to
give again, they give me a call. And how ex
cited they are about the whole thing! It al
most borders on an obsession ... as if their
lives depended on my blood.
Message: "We particularly like your kind
of blood around here, and there is a great
need for it."
My brain: Cool! But who's the "we"
again?
Message: "I am calling to inform you of a
new technique we're trying out where we

draw nearly twice as much blood as we have
before. I can assure you. the pain you feel will
be quite minimal. Some even quite enjoyed
the experience."
My brain: If I do say so myself, Stanford
Blood Center, it almost seems as if you want
rivers to run freely with the sweet nectar of
my blood, perhaps even to shower upon you,
nondescript and somewhat lifeless call-rep
resentative.
Message: "We can only hope that you will
join us at our upcoming donations, happen
ing at various locations around campus. It re
ally is quite easy to give blood, and we would
hope to see you there."
At this point. I was thoroughly convinced
that something was awry here. This man was
devoid of normal human emotion. Excite
ment, pain, anguish — he could feel nothing.
I happily carried on with my day, but at
