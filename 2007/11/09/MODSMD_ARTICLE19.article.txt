## Stanford Blood Center: Please stop hiring vampire callers 
### 
My phone rang hist Wednesday during
Hunißio lecture. Smack-dab in the
middle — we're talking 9:34 a.m. I
let it go to voicemail and dealt with it after
class.
It was an unknown 650 number. I thought
to myself that there are cxactly three groups
of people who would be making a phone call
at such an hour: controlling parents, drug
dealers and over-possessive girlfriends. This
call was from none of the above.
Message: "Hello, Mr. Hillard. This is the
Stanford Blood Center. We haven't chatted
in some time."
My brain: Odd. I don't remember ever
"chatting" with the Stanford Blood Center.
And wow. this guy sounds somewhat like a
reanimated corpsc.
Message: "We've noticed that as of today,
you're eligible to give blood again. And we
would be delighted if you were to give blood
again"

My brain: These people pay such close at
tention! I"he very day that 1 am eligible to
give again, they give me a call. And how ex
cited they are about the whole thing! It al
most borders on an obsession ... as if their
lives depended on my blood.
Message: "We particularly like your kind
of blood around here, and there is a great
need for it."
My brain: Cool! But who's the "we"
again?
Message: "I am calling to inform you of a
new technique we're trying out where we

draw nearly twice as much blood as we have
before. I can assure you. the pain you feel will
be quite minimal. Some even quite enjoyed
the experience."
My brain: If I do say so myself, Stanford
Blood Center, it almost seems as if you want
rivers to run freely with the sweet nectar of
my blood, perhaps even to shower upon you,
nondescript and somewhat lifeless call-rep
resentative.
Message: "We can only hope that you will
join us at our upcoming donations, happen
ing at various locations around campus. It re
ally is quite easy to give blood, and we would
hope to see you there."
At this point. I was thoroughly convinced
that something was awry here. This man was
devoid of normal human emotion. Excite
ment, pain, anguish — he could feel nothing.
I happily carried on with my day, but at

12:34 p.m. — exactly three hours
later — my phone rang again. It was
now a woman on the other end, one
who shared her predecessor's per
sistent, dry, soulless lilt.
For most of the four-minute mes
sage, she desperately listed screening

locations that I already knew about
("Branner Hall, White Plaza, Lagu
nita Hall, Stern Dining Hall, Wilbur
Dining Hall, etc.) She too empha
sized— several times — that my
blood was in great demand and that
it was quite easy to give blood. She
ended with the same reminder: "We
hope to see you there." No exclama
tion mark, only a period.
Late that night, it finally dawned
on me. 1 ran out of the bathroom and
down to the kitchen to get all the gar
lic in the house and then formed a
barrier around my bed. I gathered all
the wooden crosses I could find in
this heathen secular university and
sat in a well sunlit area. It all made so
much sense: their lifeless droning,
the calls at odd hours (no doubt de
livered from a cave), the persistence
... even the slight Transyivanian ac
cent. I should have known earlier:
The Stanford Blood Center had
taken to hiring vampires.
Anyone who knows anything
about vampires knows that they
have to be invited into your house in
order to enter, and to guard against
this possibility, I have yet to call back
either representative. I have taken to
carrying a miniature mirror with me
so as to know the Stanford Blood
Center's minions when I see them
(or don't!). And I can't remember if
this applies to werewolves or vam
pires, but I acquired (at great ex

pense) a set of silver bullets that I
keep in my back pocket as the final
straw.
My paranoid delusions have so
far paid off.To the best of my knowl
edge, 1 have not joined the great un
dead army and my craving for blood
is not much higher than it is on a
usual day. My body, however ill
smelling it may be as a result of the
garlic, is free of puncture wounds.
Still, 1 can't help but recall read
ing Bram Stoker's Dracula in high
school. The sexual suggestiveness of
the vampire's bite was the most im
portant element. Come to think of it.
the female caller (let's call her"Vam
pirella") did have an oddly sensuous
voice.
Stanford Blood Center, 1 am for
now protected against your vam
pires, and 1 will proudly defend my
status amongst the living, at least for
the time being. If Dracula is right,
however, it will only be a matter of
time before attractive female vam
pires of the Stanford Blood Center
grow desperate for sustenance. And
when buxom vampires do come after
me, well, what's the point of resist
ing?
