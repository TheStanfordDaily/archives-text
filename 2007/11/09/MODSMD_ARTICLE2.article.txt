### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Harvard, Northwestern State and UC-Santa
Barbara. Not exactly a murderers row. but after
months of buildup leading to tonight's opener, the
Cardinal are happy to open up against anyone.
Stanford will face the Crimson tonight at 7 p.m..
the Demons on Saturday at 7 p.m. and the Gauehos
Sunday at 3 p.m. in the Basketball Travelers Classic
— all of the games will take place at Maples Pavil
ion.
Tommy Amaker. the former Duke star and
Michigan coach (fired after last season for not
reaching the NCAA Tournament in six years in
Ann Arbor), now heads Harvard.Though Amaker
is not the best of coaches, I iarvard almost has to be
better under his tutelage than they were last year
when they backslid their way to a 12-16 overall
record (5-9 in the Ivy League)

Sophomore guard Jeremy Lin, a
former Gunn High School star, figures
to generate some cheers, hut if anyone
from this team seriously pushes Stan
ford, it won't be a good sign for the
Cardinal.
Northwestern State made waves in
2CKK-) with a shocking 64-63 upset of
three-seed lowa as a 14-seed in the
NCAA Tournament's first round. Un
fortunately. that was the high-water
mark for the Louisiana school. Bad
analogy perhaps, but however you
want to phrase it.the Demons have
fallen off since. They went just 17-15
last season, despite competing in the
weak Southland Conference. Still,
with 11 of their 16 players from their
talent-rich home state, they're a better
test than Harvard.
Meanwhile, UCSB outshot Cal
State Dominguez Hills by 18 and
forced 28 turnovers, but won only 61-
57 in their exhibition game last Thurs
day. The reason? Eighteen percent (5
of 28) shooting in the second half, in
cluding five missed layups.
That being said, the Gauchos are
easily the toughest opponent of the
weekend. It would be foolish to expect
them to shoot that badly Sunday —
they won't rotate through their entire

roster, and guard Alex Harris is a pre
season mid-major All-American.
But UCSB should make Stanford's
life interesting with their fullcourt,
trapping defense. Five of the Gauchos'
top six scorers from last year's 18-11
team return, including quick, aggres
sive guards Harris, Justin Joyner and
James Powell. Those three — and
their pressure defense — are a major
reason the Gauchos are preseason fa
vorites in the Big West, and. in case you
hadn't noticed. Stanford has struggled
handling the ball so far.
"We faced some pressure." coach
Trent Johnson said after Monday's ex
hibition win against Concordia Uni
versity. "At times we were good, at
times we weren't. We're going to be
fine on the halfcourt.Teams want to sit
back in a halfcourt and play man-to
man or play a zone. We're going to
have a level of success, but for us, we
know what our Achilles heel is."
Stanford is much the same team as
last year, just one year older and
stronger. Reserve guard Carlton
Weatherby is the only departed schol
arship player, so take an NCAA team
that finished 18-13 and 10-8 in the Pac
-10. return every major piece and.the
thinking goes. Sweet 16 here we come.
"We're a much better team than
last year." Johnson said."We're bigger.
We're stronger."
