GAME NOTES: Stanford kicks off its season
today against the Bulldogs before its mar
quee matchup against No. 3 Rutgers.
The Cardinal will face the three top
ranked teams according to the preseason
polls, this year: No. 1 Tennessee, No. 2
Connecticut and No. 3 Rutgers. 2007
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, Jayne
Appel, is likely to start after missing last
Saturday's exhibition game against
Chico State.

of the Bulldogs' guards stands as
tall as 5- l >. the height of Stanford's
shortest player.
ITie Cardinal has a 21-11 all
time record in season openers and
has won its first game six years in a
row. Stanford also sports a 4-1 all
time record against the Ivy
League, including one win against
Yale in the teams' only meeting to
date, a 75-61 Cardinal win in the
1978-7 1 ) season.
Hie Bulldogs were one of the
NCAA's most-improved teams
last year, hut only one of the
team's top three scorers returns to

a young squad with only two sen
iors. Sophomore guard/forward
Melissa Colborne will be asked to
take her game to another level this
year after averaging 11.0 points
per game (but only on 36.4 per
cent shooting) in her rookie sea
son. Senior point guard Stephanie
Marciano led Yale with 4.1 assists
per game last year and will also
play a more central role to replace
the offense the Bulldogs have lost.
Rutgers is undoubtedly the
greater threat to the Cardinal.The
Scarlet Knights went 27-9 last
year, including an eight-game tear
in March that lilted the team to
the Big East title over power
house Connecticut and then car
ried them all the way to the
NCAA final, where they lost to
No. 1 Tennessee.
Rutgers achieved its success
with four players scoring just over
12 points per game. Only two re
turn — senior center Kia Vaugh
an (12.8 points per game) and
sophomore guard Epiphanny
Prince (12.2 points per game) —
but every returning player except
for one on the Scarlet Knights ros
ter saw time in more than 30
games last season. That experi
ence and depth should allow the
team to make a smooth transition
into the new season.
Sunday's game against Rutgers
will be televised live on ESPN on
at 5 p.m PST.
