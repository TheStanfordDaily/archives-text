# Men's soccer in search of playoff berth
## 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
This is a make-or-break. weekend for Stan
ford men's soccer. 'ITie team travels to the
Northwest in its final regular season road trip to
compete against Oregon State and Washington
to compete in games that will decide its postsea
son fate.
Sophomore midfielder Michael Strickland is
looking forward to the challenges of playing in
an unfamiliar setting.
"The team is excited to play on the road one
last time in the regular season, [though] we hope
there are many more road games to come."

Strickland said. "It's always exciting to travel
and play in a hostile atmosphere with every
thing to play for."
I ; .\terVthirig, in this case, is a "nod from the
NCAA ToutnnVrient committee. Coach Bret
Simon noted the tremendous effort that will be
required from every player this weekend.
"Our team is starting to gather momentum
after a very focused weekend," he said."The re
sults were great, but the team put forth a great
effort to achieve them. [We'll] have to match
that on the road this weekend.litis also gives us
a chance to prove to the NCAA committee that
we can be just as tough on the road as we are at
home."

The Cardinal (6-4-5,3-2-2 Pacific-10) plays
the Beavers (7-10-0, 2-5-0 Pac-10) on Friday,
and is looking for a repeat of the teams' previ
ous meeting this season — Stanford downed
OSU 4-0 on Oct. 5. With the Beavers coming off
back-to-back wins against Loyola Marymount
and Cal State Bakersfield. though. Oregon
State has plenty of momentum heading into the
contest.
The Beaver offense is led by senior Nick
Webb with five goals. I le is well supported by
five teammates who have two or more goals
each this season, threatening Stanford's defense
with numerous weapons.
"Like any team we play, limiting chances is

always a priority and the game plan will be the
same against OSU," Strickland said.
Stanford will look to this same strategy on
Sunday against the Huskies (7-6-2, 2-3-1 Pac
-10). whom the Card tied 0-0 on Oct. 7th. Wash
ington's scoring potential has recently been
concentrated in senior Ely Allen, who slid into
position as the team's leading attacker after sen
ior Kevin Forrest was sidelined with a foot in
jury. Five of Allen's eight season goals have
come in the Huskies' last four games.
"Ely Allen is a great player, with pace, skill.
and leadership," Strickland said. "He
is their main threat, and we will have
to be at our best to neutralize his abil
ity. Of course [Washington] will miss
Kevin Forrest and his ability, but they
have more than enough players to
give us trouble."
The well-rounded Husky attack
has scored 21 times this season, rank
ing second best in the Pac-10. In the
back, Washington's goalkeepers have
registered seven shutouts to limit op
ponents: five of these came with red
shirt freshman Stephen Fung be
tween the posts.
In the Huskies' last time out. they
notched a win against UCLA. They
come into the weekend's game off of
a bye week. Strickland acknowledged

the significance of the time off for a
team's mental and physical states.
"Any team coming off a bye week
will have fresh legs, but will also con
tain a very sound game plan." Strick
land said.'T assume Washington will
have prepared well for our game and
will have made the necessary adjust
ments in an attempt to give us prob
lems."
Simon, though, believes that Stan
ford has "found a good balance" in its
•offensive and defensive execution
and doesn't take for granted any per
ceived edge held by the Cardinal in its
battle for a postseason berth.
"Each game will present an oppo
nent who is motivated and playing
well, and we'll play them on their
home field." Simon said."[For us.] this
weekend is quite a challenge and
quite an opportunity."
