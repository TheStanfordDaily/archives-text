It's a truly amazing time of the year
in the sports world. The NFL sea
son is halfway through, basketball
is just getting started and fall college
sports are winding down to their cham
pionship seasons.
This is the time of the year where
the clocks go back,it's darker and cool
er and we get to curl up in the warmth
of our rooms and watch sports all day
and all night. From now until April,
every weekend will be filled with
sporting events from bowl games to
national championships to March
Madness. So sit back and enjoy the
ride.
Now onto my winners and losers
for this weekend in college sports.
Winner: Men's Basketball
Is it that time of the year already?
The No. 21 Stanford men's basketball
team makes its regular season debut
tonight in Maples Pavilion against
Harvard, continues on Saturday
against Northwestern State and caps
the weekend off on Sunday with UC-
Santa Barbara. Stanford looked good
on Monday in an exhibition tune-up
and tonight starts its quest to return to
the NCAA tournament. All the non
conference games are critical for the
team as an extremely tough Pac-10
schedule awaits them in January. Ex
pect Stanford to roll to three victories
this weekend.
Loser: California
At the beginning of October, this
game seemed like it was going to be the
game of the year in college football.
Now. unranked California welcomes
USC to town in a game with major
Pac-10 implications. Cal had lost three
in a row until beating Washington
State last weekend, and USC looked
sharp in beating down Oregon State.
John David Booty is back for the
Trojans and made his presence felt last
weekend. Four years ago. Cal pulled
off a huge 34-31 upset in triple over
time over then-No. 3 USC in a game
that put coach Jeff Tedford on the map.
Cal won't be as lucky this time as USC
is trying to keep their BCS bowl hopes
alive and is beginning to look like the
Southern Cal of old. Cal loses, which, if
you want to really stretch, makes this
year's Big Game all the more exciting
to look forward to.
