It's a truly amazing time of the year
in the sports world. The NFL sea
son is halfway through, basketball
is just getting started and fall college
sports are winding down to their cham
pionship seasons.
This is the time of the year where
the clocks go back,it's darker and cool
er and we get to curl up in the warmth
of our rooms and watch sports all day
and all night. From now until April,
every weekend will be filled with
sporting events from bowl games to
national championships to March
Madness. So sit back and enjoy the
ride.
Now onto my winners and losers
for this weekend in college sports.
Winner: Men's Basketball
Is it that time of the year already?
The No. 21 Stanford men's basketball
team makes its regular season debut
tonight in Maples Pavilion against
Harvard, continues on Saturday
against Northwestern State and caps
the weekend off on Sunday with UC-
Santa Barbara. Stanford looked good
on Monday in an exhibition tune-up
and tonight starts its quest to return to
the NCAA tournament. All the non
conference games are critical for the
team as an extremely tough Pac-10
schedule awaits them in January. Ex
pect Stanford to roll to three victories
this weekend.
Loser: California
At the beginning of October, this
game seemed like it was going to be the
game of the year in college football.
Now. unranked California welcomes
USC to town in a game with major
Pac-10 implications. Cal had lost three
in a row until beating Washington
State last weekend, and USC looked
sharp in beating down Oregon State.
John David Booty is back for the
Trojans and made his presence felt last
weekend. Four years ago. Cal pulled
off a huge 34-31 upset in triple over
time over then-No. 3 USC in a game
that put coach Jeff Tedford on the map.
Cal won't be as lucky this time as USC
is trying to keep their BCS bowl hopes
alive and is beginning to look like the
Southern Cal of old. Cal loses, which, if
you want to really stretch, makes this
year's Big Game all the more exciting
to look forward to.
Winner: Women's Basketball
The No. 7 Women's basketball
team is on the East coast this weekend
for a pair of non-conference games,
highlighted by Sunday's clash with last
year's NCAA finalist. Rutgers. Stan
ford will sorely miss Brooke Smith
down low. but sophomore Jayne
Appel and senior Candice Wiggins are
back for a team that was upset last year
in the second round of the NCAA
tournament.
The team should have no trouble
with Yale on Friday and will beat Rut
gers on Sunday. Though Rutgers is a
great team and has a great coach in C.
Vivian Stringer. Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer knows how to prepare
her squad for tough non-conference
games. Expect the women's team to
also go through the weekend unde
feated as they make a national state

ment early in the season.
Loser: Texas
This is the upset special of the
weekend. Texas Tech heads into
Austin to take on the Texas Longhorns
in a crucial Big 12 battle.
Texas has been slowly climbing the
rankings in the past few weeks, but
none of the lx)nghorns' wins seem too
impressive. Meanwhile. Texas Tech's
passing attack is one of the most
feared in the nation. Graham Harrell
h(K)king up with Michael Crabtree is
the Tom Brady-Randy Moss combina
tion of college football. Harrell has
tossed 38 touchdowns this year and
Crabtree has hauled in 18 of those.
Texas hasn't looked too sharp in the
last few weeks and Texas Tech is a
good 7-3 squad with all of their losses
coming in Big 12 conference play.
Even though Texas is playing at home,
look for Texas Tech to be the spoilers
on Saturday.
