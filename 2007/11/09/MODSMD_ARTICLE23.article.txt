# Card looks to finish regular season strong
## No. 5 Stanford faces Oregon and Oregon State this weekend 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Ihe No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team wraps up its
regular season and Pacific-10 Conference schedule with
one last road trip this weekend, traveling north to take on
Oregon this evening and Oregon State on Sunday.
The Cardinal (13-2-3,4-1-2 Pac-10) jumped up to third
in the conference last weekend after a pair of victories: a
4-0 romp over Washington and a 2-1 overtime win against
Washington State. Hie Ducks (8-7-3,1-3-3 Pac-10) and
the Beavers (7-8-3,0-5-2), by contrast, dwell at the bot
tom of .the Pac-10 standings, sitting at eighth and tenth
place, respectively.
Stanford's offense experienced a rebirth last week
end, pouring in six goals after struggling in front of the net
for several weekends. Sophomore forward Kelley
O'Hara led the charge with a pair of early goals that ef
fectively ended the Washington game just after it kicked
off. but the four other strikes came from four different
Cardinal playersâ€”junior defender Allison Falk, mid
fielders sophomore Kristin Stannard and redshirt senior
Shari Summers, and freshman forward Christen Press
all from different positions, a testament to the formidable
depth that has driven the Stanford offense this year.
The Cardinal defense also played like the solid unit
that looked so dominant at the beginning of the year. Se
nior goalkeeper Erica Holland returned for her first full
weekend in the net after recovering from injury, but she
was barely called upon to make a save as the back line
cleaned up virtually everything that came into the Stan
ford half.
Oregon's main problem this season has been keeping
opponents off the scoreboard.The Ducks have only three
shutouts in 18 games played, last in the Pac-10. Junior
goalkeeper Jessie Chatfield allows an average of 1.41
goals per game and has a meager .70K save percentage.
The team's strength is undoubtedly its well-rounded
offense. Oregon has 11 goal scorers on its roster and four
players in double-digits in points. A pair of midfielders,
sophomore Teresa Howns (five goals, six assists) and jun
ior Allison Newton (five goals, three assists) lead the way.
Oregon State has virtually the same offensive and de

fensive statistics as the Ducks but has had trouble turning
those numbers into wins. The Beavers are the only team
in the Pac-10 with an overall record under .500.The team
has not won since a 2-1, double overtime victory against
Idaho on Sept. 30.
The team's tort lines turned sharply at the beginning of
the conference schedule when sophomore goalie Ashley
Wood was injured. Her replacement. Caitlin Seeley, has
allowed 1.69 goals on average per game, over a half goal
more than Wood's average, and she has not recorded a
single shutout.
TTie start of the Pac-10 season was also when leading
scorer Jodie Taylor started getting shut down. The
Beavers have scored 30 goals in 18 games, but 13 of those

momentum going on the road to Oregon this weekend.
goals come from Taylor, who has
scored just once in the last seven
games. With the senior forward
marked out of danger, the Oregon
State attack has been weakened.
Stanford may be ending its regu
lar season this weekend, but it is as
sured of a slot in the NCAA tourna
ment and will likely play at least
some of the opening rounds at home
in the coming weeks. The Cardinal
advanced to the NCAA Round of
16 last year before falling to Clem
son at home in a penalty shootout.
