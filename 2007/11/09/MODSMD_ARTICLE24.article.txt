# Cardinal battles Tar Heels
## Field hockey faces No. 1 North Carolina in round one of NCAA Tournament 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Freshman Xanthe Travlos
summed up the mindset of the
Stanford field hockey team going
into tomorrow's NCAA Tourna
ment against undefeated No. 1
North Carolina: "We have ab
solutely nothing to lose."
The Cardinal — in the midst of
its best season in years — faces tall
odds when it takes the field against
the 20-oTar Heels in a game played
halfway across the country in
Chapel Mill, N.C. However, after
qualifying for its first NCAA Tour
nament in seven years when it de
feated Lock Haven 1-0 on Tuesday,
the team will be playing without
the slightest hint of pressure.
"Obviously it is a bit daunting
playing against the No. I seed in
the tournament and a team that's
undefeated on the year," senior
forward Jess Zutz said. "We're
looking to go into the game and put
our best effort forth. We're all real
ly excited for this game. We're not
necessarily going into this game
with any doubts, and it's tourna
ment time, so anything can hap
pen."
"It's not an easy challenge by
any means." Travlos added. "We're
on their home turf, (and] they're
the No. 1 ranked team in the coun
try. It's pretty intimidating, but on
the other hand, we're the under
dogs. Iliere's no pressure on us and
in some ways that makes it easier."
The winner of Saturday's 8 a.m.
match will go on to face the winner
of the matchup between Duke and
James Madison in the Quarterfi
nals.
Win or lose, the Cardinal is al
ready thrilled with its season. The

team captured a share of the regu
lar season title in the NorPac Con
ference before taking home the
NorPac Tournament crown this
past weekend. The team had its
first winning season under fifth
year head coach Lesley Irvine, and
it seems as if the tide may be turn
ing for a program that has strug
gled in recent years.
"Regardless of what happens
on Saturday. 1 couldn't have ever
imagined a better way for my ca
reer to end," Zutz, a four-year
starter, said. "It's amazing to be
here and I still think I'm in shock

about the whole thing.
"It hasn't really set in that we're
at the NCAAs and that we're one
of 16 teams left in the entire nation
that is still playing. Coming into my
freshman year, I never expected it
to happen. Now that it's here, its
just amazing — it's a lot fun."
The team's future is even
brighter, as it loses only two seniors
while bringing back 16 underclass
men. As Zutz explained, the team
will have a lot more to look for
ward to coming off of its best sea-
