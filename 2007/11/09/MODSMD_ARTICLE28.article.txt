## Fire dept. quenches Terra kitchen fire Co-op blaze ignites safety concerns 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
It all started with a pan of
falafel.
Katy Meadows '09 was cook
ing dinner for the residents of
Terra house last Friday — just
hours before the co-op's quarter
ly party — when a fire broke out
in its kitchen.
"1 looked over and the entire
back wall of the stove was on
fire," Meadows said.
"The room was filling with
smoke," said Resident Assistant
Benjie Nelson '07, who first tied
to put out the blaze with baking
soda.
The flames were four feet tall
by the time Luukas lives'o9 made
it onto the scene.
"I was a boy scout, but I'd
never dealt with a kitchen fire,"
lives said.
He grabbed the kitchen fire
extinguisher and hosed down the
flames. But the fire kept coming
back.
The flames were burning be
tween the grill top and the oven,
explained Judith Pond '08.
"We could only get around to
the edges," she said.
Pond pushed a button on the
wall to activate the fire suppres
sion system, and baking soda
based powder poured out of the
fume hood above the oven.
"It looked like someone took a
flour sifter to the whole kitchen,"
Nelson said.
But the fire was still blazing.
Pulling the fire suppression
system launched the fire alarm,
and the house was evacuated.
"We went around the house
telling people, 'This actually is a

fire. You really need to get out,'"
Meadows said.
Within minutes, firefighters ar
rived and extinguished the blaze.
University Fire Marshal
Joseph Leung explained why the
fire suppression powder failed to
control the flames.
"The main bulk of the fire was
under the grill where the chemi
cals were not able to reach." he
said.
Leung said the firefighters
cooled the grill area with water
and put out the flames with a fire
extinguisher.
Imogen Hinds, Associate Di
rector of Student I lousing, said
that co-op fires were an infre
quent occurrence.
"Throughout the past several
years there have been very few
fires in our Row kitchens," she
said.
Still. I leap stressed the impor
tance of fire safety.
"Safe cooking practices should
always be a focus," she said.
As fire trucks pulled away
from Terra, lives and 25 other res
idents worked to mop up the mess
in their kitchen. The job was fin
ished ten minutes before the
house's 9:00 progressive, and the
party went on as scheduled.
ITie falafel didn't fare as well.
"The falafel and the burnt oil
and all the blue dust became this
charred goopy blue mess," Mead
ows said.
"The pan looked like a lunar
landscape," added 11 ugh Gorman
'09.
lives saw the aftermath of the
Terra fire as a testament to the na
ture of the co-op.
"That's the Terra spirit for
you." he said, "kitchen fire, mas
sive cleanup, progressive and
party, all in a good night's work."
