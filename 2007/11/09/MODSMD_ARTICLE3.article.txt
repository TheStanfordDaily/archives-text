## Volleyball gets the job done Card beats No. 4 Huskies in crucial Pac-10 match; now tied for first 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
To beat No. 4 Washington in Seattle, the No. 5
Stanford women's volleyball team needed to give
everything it had and then some. But after two
and a half hours of play, that's just what happened.
The Cardinal won in five games to hand the
Huskies their second loss of the year, snapping
Washington's 38-match home winning streak in
the process.
"It was really neat to see how excited the play
ers were for the match and how focused they
were," head coach John Dunning said. "Washing
ton hadn't lost there in three years and [seniors)
Bryn Kehoe and Franci Girard had never won
there. This was definitely a breakthrough match
— there were some long rallies during the match
that we won, the kind of rallies that can be a turn
ing point in your season."
Stanford (23-2. 12-2) had dropped a five
gamer to the Huskies (22-2, 11-2) at home a
month ago — the Cardinal's first loss
of the season — but got its revenge
last night.The teams are now tied for
the lead in the Pac-10 with two losses
each. No. 6 Southern California and
No. 7 Cal are two games behind, with
four conference losses each. The
Golden Bears beat Washington State
last night while the Trojans lost on the
road at No. 20 Oregon.
Behind 21 kills from freshman out
side hitter Alix Klineman and a ca
reer-high-tying 70 assists for senior
setter Bryn Kehoe, the Cardinal won
last night bv the scores of 30-23,24-30.
30-25,21-30 and 15-10.
The Cardinal jumped out to a lead
to start the match and did not relin
quish it in the first game. The last tie
was at four-all and Stanford led by
double digits at 27-17. The Cardinal
eventually got the points it needed,
winning the game 30-23 on a kill by
junior outside hitter Cynthia Bar
boza.
"One thing Washington does is
serve really tough and put pressure on
your passers," Dunning said. "We
passed great in the first game and
that's why it went the way it did, and
when we struggled a bit. we had a
harder time."
Stanford again started strong in
the second, but Washington fought
back to win the game and tie the
match. Stanford led at 14-13 after
Kehoe won a joust at the net, but
Washington regained the lead and
used a five-point run. including back
to-back blocks of Klineman, to put
the game away. A Washington ace
ended it 30-24.
In the third game it was Washing
ton leaving Stanford behind, leading
5-1 early on. The Cardinal battled for
a six-six tie, but Washington again
pulled away. Stanford caught up at l l >-
all and pulled ahead when Washing
ton hitters committed three errors in
four points. The game ended 30-25 in
Stanford's favor on two more Husky

errors.
After a close beginning to the
fourth game, Washington gradually
built a lead, up 15-12 at the official
timeout. Stanford tied at 18, but
Washington reeled off eight of the
next nine points to put the game out
of reach. A Stanford service error fol
lowed by a hitting error gave the

1 luskies the 30-21 win.
Ihe last time these teams played
— at Maples in October — the final
score was 15-10 in the fifth game. It
was the same score last night, but it
was the Cardinal gutting out the victo
ry this time. Stanford went ahead 4-3
and would not trail again, finishing off
the match on a kill by junior right side

hitter Erin Waller.
klineman led the Cardinal with 21
kills and Akinradewo added 17. Bar
boza and Waller chipped in 14 each
and Girard tallied seven. Jessica
Swarbrick led the 1 luskies with 14.
Freshman libera Gabi Ailes dug 29
balls while her Washington counter
part Tamari Miayshiro had a match
high 30.
Both teams got the majority of
their blocks early in the match, and
Stanford 112 inished with six to Washing
ton's nine. Akinradewo had three
total, two solo, to lead the Cardinal,
while Swarbrick notched eight, in
cluding three solos.
The one area where the Huskies
dramatically outperformed the Car
dinal was from the service line —
Washington had eight aces and
missed only 10 serves, while the Car
dinal managed only two aces and
missed 20.
"What happened with us was that
we were trying to serve more aggres
sive than we did last time we played
them," Dunning said. "So we made a
lot of service errors, but that was be
cause we're not backing off and tak
ing risks."
Stanford will be back in action to
morrow in Pullman, Wash., visiting
Washington State, a team still winless
in the Pac-10 after being swept by No.
7 Cal last night.
"The players are all really tired."
Dunning said. "We use the road to
catch up on sleep because everyone is
so busy during the week. We have a lot
of families up here who knew it would
be a great match. But we are just
going to sleep, because we need to get
on the bus at seven in the morning to
go to Spokane and then to Pullman."
Because of a conflict with basket
ball, the match will start late, at 8:30
p.m.

setter Bryn Kehoe, the Cardinal won
last night bv the scores of 30-23,24-30.
30-25,21-30 and 15-10.
The Cardinal jumped out to a lead
to start the match and did not relin
quish it in the first game. The last tie
was at four-all and Stanford led by
double digits at 27-17. The Cardinal
eventually got the points it needed,
winning the game 30-23 on a kill by
junior outside hitter Cynthia Bar
boza.
"One thing Washington does is
serve really tough and put pressure on
your passers," Dunning said. "We
passed great in the first game and
that's why it went the way it did, and
when we struggled a bit. we had a
harder time."
Stanford again started strong in
the second, but Washington fought
back to win the game and tie the
match. Stanford led at 14-13 after
Kehoe won a joust at the net, but
Washington regained the lead and
used a five-point run. including back
to-back blocks of Klineman, to put
the game away. A Washington ace
ended it 30-24.
In the third game it was Washing
ton leaving Stanford behind, leading
5-1 early on. The Cardinal battled for
a six-six tie, but Washington again
pulled away. Stanford caught up at l l >-
all and pulled ahead when Washing
ton hitters committed three errors in
four points. The game ended 30-25 in
Stanford's favor on two more Husky

errors.
After a close beginning to the
fourth game, Washington gradually
built a lead, up 15-12 at the official
timeout. Stanford tied at 18, but
Washington reeled off eight of the
next nine points to put the game out
of reach. A Stanford service error fol
lowed by a hitting error gave the

1 luskies the 30-21 win.
Ihe last time these teams played
— at Maples in October — the final
score was 15-10 in the fifth game. It
was the same score last night, but it
was the Cardinal gutting out the victo
ry this time. Stanford went ahead 4-3
and would not trail again, finishing off
the match on a kill by junior right side

hitter Erin Waller.
klineman led the Cardinal with 21
kills and Akinradewo added 17. Bar
boza and Waller chipped in 14 each
and Girard tallied seven. Jessica
Swarbrick led the 1 luskies with 14.
Freshman libera Gabi Ailes dug 29
balls while her Washington counter
part Tamari Miayshiro had a match
high 30.
Both teams got the majority of
their blocks early in the match, and
Stanford 112 inished with six to Washing
ton's nine. Akinradewo had three
total, two solo, to lead the Cardinal,
while Swarbrick notched eight, in
cluding three solos.
The one area where the Huskies
dramatically outperformed the Car
dinal was from the service line —
Washington had eight aces and
missed only 10 serves, while the Car
dinal managed only two aces and
missed 20.
"What happened with us was that
we were trying to serve more aggres
sive than we did last time we played
them," Dunning said. "So we made a
lot of service errors, but that was be
cause we're not backing off and tak
ing risks."
Stanford will be back in action to
morrow in Pullman, Wash., visiting
Washington State, a team still winless
in the Pac-10 after being swept by No.
7 Cal last night.
"The players are all really tired."
Dunning said. "We use the road to
catch up on sleep because everyone is
so busy during the week. We have a lot
of families up here who knew it would
be a great match. But we are just
going to sleep, because we need to get
on the bus at seven in the morning to
go to Spokane and then to Pullman."
Because of a conflict with basket
ball, the match will start late, at 8:30
p.m.
