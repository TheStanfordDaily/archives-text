About Me:

The creation of one's profile is an art (or maybe a science), and one has to be
careful what one puts on there, as one may be judged. Many students put hours
into the creation of their profile. Some don't. And some students need some
assistance with their profile, so everyone else takes them seriously. I think
we're only a few years away from the rise of"Facebook consultants" (a nice al
ternative to McKinsey) who will "assist Facebook users on profile solutions."
When I am Facebook-stalking someone, 1 want the experience to be enjoy
able. Some students, though, put things in their profile that ruin the experience
for me and hundreds of other Facebook stalkers. As a public service, I offer up
these tips and tricks (but mostly, just I-am-judging-you remarks) for the
greater good.
The first place I look is books. I'm not an English major, but 1 think books
tell the most about a person, whether they know it or not. It's also a place of
grievous sins. Stanford's aggregate top 10 is populated by books everyone read
in sophomore-year high-school English, suggesting that no one has read any
thing after that. "Crime and Punishment," "1984" and "To Kill A Mocking
bird" are examples of this. Over 500 students list "Catcher in the Rye," but I'm
not really sure why. The rest of the top 10 is a bizarre assortment: "Ender's
Game," "Lord of the Rings," " The Fountainhead." The dorkiness is not so
bad, but really people? Ayn Rand?
"Pride and Prejudice" also features heavily among the female population.
Mr. Darcy is not real, ladies, and you won't find him any more easily by putting
the book in your profile. I'm also not sure why techies find it funny to list their
electrical engineering textbook of choice, but it's not. It also suggests that you
haven't read a novel in years, which is not something to be proud of.
Favorite Movies is also a location of great potential sin. Testosterone dom
inates here. "Fight Club," "Pulp Fiction," "The Departed" and "Gladiator"
are all in the top five. Are females also listing these movies? Males emphasiz
ing their masculinity seem to have taken the unfortunate tack of also including
Samuel L. Jackson aphorisms in their quotes section. No need, gentlemen. Ad
ditionally, I'm not sure why some people list movies either a) ironically or b) a
movie from their childhood they have not seen in a decade. Examples of this
are "Godzilla" and"The Little Mermaid." You don't actually like Godzilla.
You just want to think that you're snarky and witty enough to "like" Godzilla.
But you aren't.
Then there are the people who feel the compulsive need to show how intel
lectual and high-minded they are by remarking "I don't watch TV." If you
don't watch TV, just don't list anything under "Favorite TV shows." The list
ing of guilty pleasures, within reason, is highly encouraged: "Gilmore Girls"
yes, "Fear Factor" no.
Lastly, there's music. Some people list 40 bands, in alphabetical order,
straight from iTunes. Not necessary. The best, though, is when people list "any
thing" or even better, "anything but county." What, High School Musical is
okay and "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk" is not? Seriously? Also, the indie
trendstcrs who only list bands that no one else has heard of — ridiculous.
The worst Facebook habit ever is in the "Activities" section. Due to its na
ture, there's a potential for extreme abuse. Some people list every single activ
ity they are involved with or ever have been. This is a no-go. I don't think any
one cares if you were Assistant Editor at SURJ your freshman year. And you
shouldn't either. "Homework" is not an activity, unless you enjoy doing home
work even when it's not for class. Listing lots of activities doesn't make you
look busy or accomplished. Instead, you look like a tool.
I can't say that even I follow all these commandments. It takes strength to
admit grievous error and move to correct it. Maybe one day I'll even be stalk
ing you.
