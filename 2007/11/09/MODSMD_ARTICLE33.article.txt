# Stop poking me

### SINI MATIKAINEN INTERMISSION POKING POLICE 
Miss Manners is not on Faccbook. Which is probably good, because
if she were, she would tell you to clean up your language and wear some
thing besides caution tape to parties. But she would probably also have
some useful things to say about the etiquette of a new realm of social in
teraction — some suggestions to make everyone's life just a little bit
smoother. In lieu of her wisdom, consider the following guidelines.
1. Poking: No.
2. Poking a stranger: NO.
3. Handle wall-posting with care. You never know who will be lurking
— TA's. old hookups — and you aren't being as ambiguous as you think.
4. Keep your personal information to the point. A good rule of thumb
is that you should be able to view the entire profile, from "Gender" to
"About Me," in one screen. If you have 30 novels listed, no one cares. If
you quote 20 invokes, your friends already know them, and they'll be in
comprehensible to everyone else.
5. Don't quote yourself under "Favorite Quotes." After thousands of
years of recorded human history, no one has said anything you like bet
ter than what comes out of your own mouth?
6. Do your stalkers a favor by accurately listing your relationship status.
You don't have to be all "I AM SINGLE AND DESPERATE" if you
are. and anything ambiguous enough to be called "Irs Complicated" is
probably a little too, well, complicated for Facebook. But if you've been
dating someone for a year, save the lovelorn boy in your bio class a little
bit of trouble and put "In a Relationship" jon your profile. As to hetero
sexual people in relationships with their saine-sex heterosexual friends: I
don't know what effect you're going for (no matter what passes between
us, you will never be as important to me as my best friend? I might not be
in a relationship but don't think I'm lonely?), but it's just confusing.
7. On the other hand, there is no need to list what you are looking for.
This is not OK Cupid, and as far as I know, listing "Whatever I Can Get"
has never gotten anyone a Faccbook message offering a rendezvous in
Green's West Wing. "Friendship" kind of goes without saying, unless
you're a hermit, and you wouldn't have a Facebook account if you were.
8. Don't put your privacy settings so that no one else can see your pic
tures. or you risk throwing us back to the dark ages in the beginning of
Facebook when we only had one picture to judge someone's attractive
ness. If you don't want potential employers to see your boozy pictures,
de-tag them or adjust your privacy settings so that only your friends can
see pictures.
9. Don't put up albums composed exclusively of your glamour shots.
Everyone has dark periods — sometimes known as junior year of high
school, or last Wednesday afternoon when you were bored — when you
pout, tilt your head just so, peer out from under your lashes and take a
picture with your digital camera at arm's length. But don't bring the emo
vanity shot to Faccbook. Keep it on MySpace, where it belongs.
10. Don't invite everyone you know to add your applications. Not every
one is interested in joining the pirate vs. ninja battle, and the kid from
your 10th grade history class is not going to write in your Honesty Box.
11. And finally, the cardinal rule: Never, ever acknowledge to a stranger,
in the real world, that you've already seen his or her Facebook profile. If
you friended someone the summer before freshman year and drunkenly
mention at a party that you "think we're friends on Facebook," that's
maybe acceptable. Maybe. But you don't want to come acrt&s as "I know
1 don't know you, but I've already memorized your list of favorite books
and have decided that our children would be beautiful" — even if, after
careful consideration, you know that they would. The fundamental idea
is to use Facebook to foster social interaction, not inhibit it. And anyway,
it's more productive to casually slip his favorite books into the conversa
tion like the sly weasel you are.
