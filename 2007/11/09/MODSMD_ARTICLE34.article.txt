## Arrrrr you ready for Pirates of Penzance? 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION BROADWAY BUCCANEER 
For those of you whose only source of
musical theater is "Flight of the Con
chords" on You Tube, "Pirates of Pen
zance" might Be just what you need to re
mind yourself how fantastic the live ver
sion of the genre can be.
That said. "Pirates" is not your ordi
nary musical theater. Written by Gilbert
and Sullivan, the "comic opera" first pre
miered in New York in 1879. Of course
there's singing and dancing and orchestral
accompaniment (all at the same time!),
but in some ways, it's more of a meta-mu
sical: highly self-aware. And that's where
its best humor comes from.
For one. a screen to the left of the stage
displays supertitles throughout the show,
both to clarify the singer's lyrics and to
provide an omniscient running commen
tary. As the overture plays, it points out
the best aspect of live theater: no five-sec
ond delay leaves the door open for
"wardrobe malfunctions" (a la Superbowl
2004). At the beginning of Act 11, the su
pertitles greet us as Captain Obvious, say
ing, "Oh no! The Major-Gcneral is crying
in the middle of the elaborate and time

consuming set! Let's find out why." And as
the cast sings the praises of poetry, it scrolls
through images of Shakespeare. W.E.
Gilbert. Dr. Seuss, and Mos Def.
But 1 get ahead of myself—what is

"Pirates of Penzance" even about?

Part cheesy love story, part
witty comedy. "Pirates" re-

volves around Frederic, a
noble and strongly moral

young man who has fi
nally worked off his

apprenticeship to a
pirate king. Despite
having worked for
the Pirates of Pen- '

zance his entire life,
he is resolved to re
deem his soul from a
life of sin by "exter
minating" the men
with whom he once

allied himself.
The pirates,
however, seem
to be rather
incompetent
for their line
of work. They

will never fight anyone who is not as strong
as they are, nor will they do any harm to or
phans — a weakness that ship after ship
has noticed. The Pirate King drops Freder
ic off on a secluded part of the English
coast with his nursemaid, who has a

strong affection for him but
more than doubles his age.

On the coast, he meets the
Love Interest. Mabel,

and her family. But of

course, the pirates re
* turn, the nursemaid
' tries to enact a jeal-

ous revenge, and
nothing is quite as

easy as it should be.

1 was very im
pressed with the

Stanford Savo
yards' produc
tion of "Pi
rates" — they
truly made the

musical ac
cessible
for every-

** one, drama
geeks and not-so-

IHUM kids alike. They also managed to
take the comedy to an even higher level by
adding refreshing hints of modernity (my
favorite being a Pirate vs. Maiden dance
off invoking "Thriller").
And in case you needed a reminder,
Stanford students arc talented. The vocal
ists recruited by the Savoyards are first
rate, and all of the lead actors were spot on.
1 particularly loved Mabel's (played by
Kimberly Johnson *09) deadpan irony, as
she held a straight face even when she hit
those shockingly high notes to sing inspir
ing words like. "Go ye heroes, go and die!"
The accompanying orchestra was also a
highlight of the show, acting as just as
much of a character as the rest of the ac
tors.
Of course, "Pirates of Penzance" is still
a musical, and 1 would totally understand
if you'd rather sit at home and blog about
how you're "not in the mood" for some
thing so cheerful. But if you do decide to
take leave from your fortress of solitude.
"Pirates of Penzance" is playing Novem
ber 9, 10. and 11 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Tickets arc only $8 for stu
dents and are available online, in White
Plaza or at the door.
