Google and Apple, two of Silicon Valley's biggest tech compa
nies, are increasingly becoming part of everyday life, ever since
revolutionizing the search algorithm and the operating system,
respectively. They've saturated our desktops, pockets, cameras
and phones with applications, toolbars and widgets. But for
every excited investor gushing about their every move, there's
a wary outspoken blogger predicting the fall of humanity at the
hands of these companies. What could these companies do with
this power, and whom are we supposed to believe? Here's a
side-by-side analysis of Google and Apple and their plans for
the world:
So why are they such a big deal again?
Google: You never really know that you're available until
you've checked your Google Calendar, and you never really
know where you're going unless Google Maps is involved. And
besides, admit it, you've Googled yourself. Everyone Googles
themselves. Your friends, your advisors and your future em
ployers will all Google you at some point.
Apple: The next time you're in a particularly dull lecture, look
around: over half of the notebooks on people's laps will be
Macßooks. Or go to Arrillaga gym and count the iPods. Apple

products are appealing for their simple and pretty interfaces,
though their übiquity has gotten absurd.
Exactly how much do they know about us?
Google: Few other companies have your credit card informa
tion, contact information, personal documents and search his
tory all under one roof. If you've ever uploaded anything to
You Tube. they know what you look like and what crazy stunts
you do in your free time, as well.
Apple: Apple integrates more and more products onto its operating
system every day. Your Macßook and iPhone know who your con
tacts are. what music you like, and what events you have on your soft
ware calendar. While this data isn't on a centralized server like
Google, it still seems pretty creepy when every new program you in
stall automatically knows everything from your pets' names to the
date of your next doctor's appointment.
What's so scary about them getting bigger and more powerful?
Google: Google Street View's camera-mounted vehicles snapped a
picture of sunbathers in front on Escondido Road this past spring,
which is now publicly accessible on Google Maps. If you think that's
going too far, Google's probably mapping out a worldwide road trip
for those vehicles. In a few years, no indigenous village or coral reef
will be safe from their cameras.
Apple: Apple's had no problem dominating the personal com
puter and music player markets. Soon, its iProducts will mo
nopolize every consumer market: socks, candy, light bulbs,
dentures — they'll make it all. Our children will grow up think
ing Iraq and Iran are yet another of Apple's creations.
What arc they planning right now to take over the world?
Google: Google will continue collecting data on people across the
globe and will measure mountains down to the inch for Google

Earth.
