# Point and click tricks

### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION FACEBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER 
Digital camcras revolutionized the way that we photograph the
world. Where once we might have asked a stranger to take a photo of
us, we now extend our arms and direct the lens at our lace before
opening the shutter. Once we hear the synthetic "click" of a closed
shutter, we flip the camera around to view the photograph on the
LCD screen to decide if another take is necessary. It's the digital self
portrait, and it is unavoidable on Faccbook. It has become such a sym
bol for the way we share ourselves with the virtual world that it has
been absorbed by marketers as a means of conveying modernity (for
proof of this, look no further than the poster for "Marie Antoinette").
Though the digital self-portrait has been widely accepted as an ac
ceptable source for a Facebook photo, that doesn't mean you should
use one as your portrait online. Taken at parties, these photos often
demand the use of flash. Not only docs this close-range flash flatten
out facial contours and conjure up sickly flesh tones where normal col
ors actually appear, they expose our deepest darkest secrets: the size
of our pores. If you have big pores, blackheads or unresolved issues
stemming from acne — lord knows I do — flash will do you no favors.
lTie flash exposes every crevice on the face, casting shadows and high
lighting facial discoloration. Mainly though, flash makes us look harsh.
Instead of flash, we should embrace the world of yellow provided by
most electric lights.
Taking a digital self-portrait without flash takes skill or tech
nology. A stable hand will allow you to hold a camera steady
during the longer exposure necessitated by the choice to forego
flash, and a tripod or other flat, stable surface will keep the cam
era steady for you (this should be used in conjunction with a self
timer). Though this process takes longer than the automatic

point-and-shoot narcissism previously discussed, you will look
better. Protected by the warm haze of electric lights, your skin
will appear to glow even if it rarely seems to behave.
The next step in Facebook [x wtraiture requires giving up control:
ask someone else to take a picture of you, or simply note who has a
camera and make sure to get pictures later. Distancing the photogra
pher from the photographed allows the photographer to capture mo
ments that a self-portraitist might miss or simply not think interesting.
When was the last time you caught yourself by surprise while taking a
self-portrait'.' Looking like a deer-in-headlights may not seem to be
the most flattering thing at the moment, but it may show a refreshing
amount of personality and vulnerability not often seen in Facebook
pictures.
Dear Reader, do not confuse "vulnerability" with an endorsement

o No kissing significant others in your photo: no one enjt»ys your PDA
o A picture that you asked someone to take of you and your five
friends at a party looks staged and staid. Use a photo that someone
took spontaneously instead.
o Avoid using flash when possible. The flash on most point-and
shoot cameras will wash out the photo and flatten the visual space,
o Nude modeling is not for Facebook.
o Don't give a thumbs up to the camera. It's trademarked by Roger
Ebert, anyway.
o Don't hold a handle of vodka. I understand that you're in college
and get crunk. Let's move on.
o Recreating your favorite American Apparel ad is just not an op
tion.
o Don't take Polaroid photos and then scan them in. You're hip
ster. that's cool. Be lazier and use a digital camera.

of emo portraiture. I do not want photos of mascara tinged rivers run
ning down checks or faces covered in shadow by a graphic-print luxxl
ie. Your facebook photo is no place to convey mood — it's a place to
convey personality. Hopefully, you're not so completely emo that you
actually enjoy spending every waking moment trying to hide from the
light because you're too vulnerable to process sunlight. Most of us are
generally friendly, with other traits interspersed. Embrace it, and
share it with the world! Remember, the Facebook photo is a means of
communicating with others who may not know you well enough to
know that your emo photo is an awful phase or some kind if ironic in
jokc.
Keeping in mind that — barring some obnoxious change to a com
pletely closed profile — your photo Gin be seen by anyone, it's impor
tant to make the Facelxx>k photo as inclusive as possible. Inside jokes
are not that funny even to people who arc not "in" on them, and the
vast majority of your Facelxxik friends will likely be "out." Inside
jokes are not too far removed from the phenomenon of the Facebook
photo as advertisement. A recent example of this marketing device is
the Cheshire cat which replaced the image of a real person on the
Facebook profile of Sigma Nu members. Promoting Moon Splash is
important (?). but try to keep your cultish tendencies to yourself and
embrace your own personal identity. I do not want to get to know
Cheshire, but I might like to get to know a human being. Just a
thought.
Speaking of parties, alcohol in Facebook photos is a no-no. I do not
want to see you with a handle of Stoli because I do not care. It does not
make you kx>k cool. In fact, it makes you look silly. No one should lx
so obsessed with alcohol that it deserves a prominent place in his main
visual communication device on the Internet.
Following these guidelines will liberate you from Facebook
photo faux pas-dom and allow you to sleep a little easier.
