## Roxy gets down digitally 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION DIRTY DOUBLE-CLICKER 
Digital digital get down just you and me
(You may be) Twenty thousand miles away
but / can see ya
And baby baby you can see me
Digital digital get down just what we need
We can get together naturally
(We can) We can get together on the digital
screen
Oh, 'N Sync. Your lyrics take me back to
when the fast kids were furtively holding
hands in the back of the bus. Me-oh-my, how
the world of online sex has changed since
Roxy's salad days! (Roxy is targeting Eng
lish majors this week, and a little Shake
spearean allusion tends to draw you writers
out of the woodwork!)
It's no secret that whatever your sexual
desire, you can quench it online. But how do
you skip the sketchy while fishing in the vast
abyss that is the Internet? Clearly, with Roxy
as your guide. Below are Roxy's favorite re
sources for getting some cyber satisfaction.
Boysfood.com: Free porn. Lots of free porn.
And not just 30-second teaser clips. Sure,
there's a lot of amateur crap, but once you've
found an uploader that you like, you're set
for months. And, unlike sites like Porn King
or Free Sex, Boys Food is actually free. No e
mail address needed, no subsequent irritat
ing spam. You can just type in the address
and start searching. Roxy loves the videos
that pop up as search results for keywords
"outside" and "Euro," as well as anything
else by TheKaze.
Good Vibes.com: The hands-down best Bay
Area-based site for sex-related needs. The
site has its online catalog, hot erotica and a
slew of how-tos that will leave you reconsid
ering whether bondage really isn't for you. A
great portal to fun sex events in the area, too!
Second Life: Sure, you can buy real estate
and watch U2 in concert in Second Life. But
let's be honest â€” why would you bother

to make your avatar so hot if you
hoping for some VR sex? Admittedly, Sec-,
ond Life isn't the best for avatar-on-avatar
action, but it's incredibly
and it's an efficient gateway to other sites.
t
Craigslist: And you thought CL was only
good for cheap furniture! Try looking in the|
Casual Encounters subheading in the Per
sonals section. The listings alone are
to get your hand roving, and although the.
Sass has not met up with anyone from this"
section, one of her closeted friends uses it asj
a way to meet gay men outside of the Stan
ford bubble. J
Lingerie Avenue.com: Go here now
steeply discounted private-time costumes.
Largely catering to women, this is the placed
to go to surprise that lucky someone with a
slutty nurse/slutty school girl/slutty bumble-"
bee outfit. Also a stellar resource if you wanL
to plan ahead for Exotic Erotic. And don't
forget to check out the corsets! j
Nifty.org: The largest repository of gay
ica, though 1 have to say that I find a fair
amount of it pretty hot, and my (straight) c\-(
boyfriend did, too. We're talking about
thousands of stories. Everything that you'
can imagine is on this site. Native
oriented erotica, stories about animals and
an all-out repository of lesbian
Plus, it looks like boring academic writing in
the browser, so no casual observer will
why you really had to excuse yourself so sud
denly from the Bender room. i
AIM, iChat, GoogleChat, etc.: Yeah, yeah
yeah. Everyone knows that drunkenly on-,
line chatting late at night usually leads to
overt convos that you would like to
back 011 the morrow. And sometimes, as in
the case of one of Roxy's friends, such
lead to 4 a.m. orgies that no one wants to re
member the next day. Roxy's advice: If it'< 4
after 11:30 p.m. and you are under any kind
of influence, make sure that your
steers you safely away from the computer..
Go watch some porn instead. You'll regret it"
less in the morning. d
