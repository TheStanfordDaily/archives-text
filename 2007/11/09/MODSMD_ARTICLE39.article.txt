# FEEL THE BURM (ESE) CUISINE
## 
### TIM GARIBALDI INTERMISSION ETHNIC EPICURE 
Last week, my MySpace Interests were
just like any other college student's: Popular
Overrated Sexual Comedy, Hot Gurlz. Chill
in' wit Friends. Random Inside Joke, etc.
However, this week there has been a new ad
dition to my list: Burmese food.
Burmese food? What the hell is Burmese
food? 1 didn't believe it either, but apparent
ly not only does Burma (Myanmar, for the
pretentious among us) have an illegal mili
tary junta that violently suppresses its citi
zens. they also eat! (Too soon?) And how did
I come to discover this little known factoid,
you might ask? Well, it just so happens that
we, in the heart of our dear city of Palo Alto,
have our very own Burmese restaurant!
Located about half way down Bryant St.,
right off University Ave, Rangoon Restau
rant's comfy dining room, decorated with
artistic designs of golden pagodas and
Burmese country scenes, has been serving af
fordable, family-style food to its loyal fan
base for years and continues educating new
comers in the delights of Burmese food.
So then what is Burmese food? Well, if
Rangoon Restaurant is any indication, it's ap
parently mostly Chinese food. Though pro
claiming to be a Burmese restaurant, the
menu of Rangoon Restaurant is about 75 per
cent classic Chinese dishes, including every
thing from beef and broccoli to sesame chick
en. However, the obviously Burmese dishes
they do offer, usually denoted by names such
as "Spicy Burmese Curry Chicken" and
"Burmese Tea Leaf Salad" were quite differ
ent from their Chinese counterparts. Burmese
cuisine, much like Thai food, seems to focus
mostly on coconut milk-based curries and
complex sweet and spicy dishes, and is also
quite good. To begin the meal, we ordered an
assortment of appetizers, both Burmese and
Chinese (1 mean, there must be some reason
they feature so much Chinese food on the
menu, right?).
We started with some egg rolls. Burmese
samosas and Burmese tea leaf salad. The

egg rolls were pretty standard: not bad.

but nothing to write home about.

However, the samosas — spiced
potatoes in a fried wonton skin

— were excellent. The

Burmese tea leaf salad
was fresh with lots of
crunchv nuts and

sesame seeds,
though apparent
ly is an acquired

taste since half
our party (myself in-

eluded) loved it. while the other
half absolutely did not.

For the main course, again, we ordered a
mix of Chinese and Burmese food. The or
ange peel chicken and scallop stir fry were
both good, well prepared and flavorful

enough to be satisfying, but again nothing in
credible. The "Spicy Burmese Chicken
Curry." while not spicy in the least, was very
tender and flavorful with well-cooked pota
toes and chunks of chicken. And with the ad
dition of homemade hot sauce, the lack of
spice was not a problem. Also, the sauces
with the dishes were quite good, especially
poured over rice. Which brings me to one of
the highlights of this restaurant. The coconut
rice that was served with our meal was excel
lent, just like sticky rice in appearance, but
with a sweet coconut milk taste that got rave
reviews from everyone at the table. It was a
perfect companion to the meal and gave that
unique flavor that we were hoping for from a
Burmese restaurant.
Though the food was, for the most part,
good, the service was not quite up to par. We
were seated right away and got water and tea
without asking, but this high level of atten
tiveness did not last. The food came out
speedily enough, and the servers were very
generous and helpful when called, but after
our food was served, the waiters left us pret
ty much alone for the rest of the night. Our
waters were never refilled, and once finished
with the meal, we sat for about 10 minutes be
fore we had to ask for the check. Once we got
the check, nobody came by until we flagged
them down again. Though this was not a huge
problem, since it gave us a nice chance to
relax after the good-sized meal, everyone at

the table noticed it. Once flagged
down, the waiters were very nice,

but their inatten
tiveness was
somewhat disap
pointing after the
tasty meal, though
by no means did

it ruin the ex
perience.

A 1 -

though the
service can be

somewhat lack
ing at times, the

exotic tastes of
Burma and the af-

fordable prices at Ran-

goon Restaurant make it

a great place for a nice meal

on the weekends when
kitchens are closed. While of-

fering decent Chinese food, the
Burmese food was clearly the star.

and a great treat for anyone looking
to try something new. With familiar

dishes to keep picky eaters happy and
more exotic fare for adventurous palates,
Rangoon Restaurant offers a variety of
choices for any party. Although the service
can pull the experience down a bit, the
cheap prices and variety of good dishes are
more than enough to leave a good taste in
anyone's mouth.
