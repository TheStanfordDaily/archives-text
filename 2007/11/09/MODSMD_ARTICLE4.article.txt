# COUGAR HUNTING
## Stanford travels to Wazzu with dwindling bowl hopes at stake 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
From this point on, every game is an elimi
nation game for Stanford.
The Cardinal (3-6,2-5 Pac-10)can still qual
ify for a postseason bowl berth, but they will
have to win their final three games, beginning
with tomorrow's 3:30 p.m. road matchup with
Washington State.
Despite a two-game Stanford win streak in
Pullman, the Cougars (3-6,1-5 Pac-10) may be
a tough nut to crack; they protected their home
turf two weeks ago in a punishing 27-7 win over
UCLA, running an astounding 98 plays.
Weather could also play a role, with forecasts
calling for sub-50 degree temperatures in a
game that will end in darkness.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Tavita
Pritchard, who left last week's 27-9 loss to
Washington with a shoulder injury, will start
under center for the Cardinal. Pritchard played
only two series against the I luskies last Satur
day before injuring his shoulder and being re
placed by senior T.C. Ostrander.
Still licking its wounds from a dominating
Husky performance, the Cardinal will go to
Pullman without its top playmaker. Head
coach Jim Harbaugh announced TUesday that
sophomore wide receiver Richard Sherman
would be suspended indefinitely for unsports
manlike behavior. Visibly upset for much of
last Saturday's game, Sherman drew a person
al foul late in the Cardinal's loss to Washington
after shewing a I lusky player. He was benched
and. amid a bombastic sideline-spat, received a
lecture from senior receiver Eivan Moore.
Sherman's 38 catches for 646 yards and four
touchdowns will be missed against the
Cougars, only compounding the hits Stanford
has taken on the offensive side of the ball. Se
nior receiver Mark Bradford has been nursing
a knee injury that has limited his effectiveness,
and of the five running backs on the preseason
depth chart, only redshirt freshman Tyrone
McCiraw has not sustained an injury.
Last weekend, converted freshman corner
back Corey Gatewood stepped in at running
back and rushed five times for 63 yards, com

billing with McGraw (11 carries for 89 yards
and a touchdown) for a 152-yard performance.
As for the Cougars, they are almost a mirror
image of Stanford — Washington State has
limped through its Pac-10 schedule rocked by
depth issues and attrition. The Cougs differ
from the Card in two key respects: They have
an established, record-setting quarterback,
and their fifth-year coach is likely fighting for
his job.
Injuries may define the game, as Stanford's
depleted offense will counter a Cougar attack
missing its leading rusher, Dwight lardy, who
tore his ACL against UCLA. For the Cardinal,
senior cornerback Nick Sanchez's status is cur
rently unknown.
The Cougars feature the most experienced
quarterback in the conference, Alex Brink.The
fifth-year senior from Eugene, Ore. has started
37 straight games,moving into the starting line
up as a freshman when Josh Swogger's 2(X)4
season was cut short by injuries sustained
against Stanford. Brink already heads the
WSU record books when it comes to passing

— he's first in attempts,completions,yards and
touchdowns and second in completion per
centage. For his career. Brink is 768 for 1319 for
9,751 yards.
WSU head coach Bill Doha, in his fifth year
as head coach and 19th overall with the pro
gram, has been under fire the past two seasons.
Doha (28-28) was promoted from the de
fensive coordinator position after Mike Price
left for Alabama and followed up a 10-3 cam
paign with records of 5-6. 4-7 and 6-6. Under
Price, he was known for some risk-taking but
dominant defensive units, including the
"Palouse Posse" that led the Cougars to a No. 7
finish in 1994, but has struggled as a head coach
with consistency and decision-making.
A loss to a lackluster Stanford team might
raise the heat.
Cougar receiver Michael Bumpus is also
looking to keep up the record-breaking trend
for the Cougars. He is tied with Hugh Camp
bell for 176 receptions and will almost surely

— Stanford has won the last two
games played at Martin Stadium, fol

24-21 victory in 2005. Washington
State won 36-10 last year at Stanford
Stadium, scoring nine points on de
fense in a blowout contest that saw
the first appearance of the oft-ma
ligned "quick-kick." The third-down
punt was first employed on a third
and-long from the Stanford one-yard
line; quarterback Trent Edwards
pinned WSU in its own territory on
the surprise play.
— The first of many great passing
quarterbacks for Washington State
was Jack Thompson (Class of 1978),
whose nephew is Stanford starter
Tavita Pritchard. Pritchard's father
also played for the Cougars.
Pritchard has alluded to his uncle's
influence, saying Thompson has em
phasized staying calm in pressure sit
uations. Doha said last week he
wished WSU had recruited
Pritchard; the Cougars instead
signed a Fresno quarterback who has
since dropped out of school.

al foul late in the Cardinal's loss to Washington
after shewing a I lusky player. He was benched
and. amid a bombastic sideline-spat, received a
lecture from senior receiver Eivan Moore.
Sherman's 38 catches for 646 yards and four
touchdowns will be missed against the
Cougars, only compounding the hits Stanford
has taken on the offensive side of the ball. Se
nior receiver Mark Bradford has been nursing
a knee injury that has limited his effectiveness,
and of the five running backs on the preseason
depth chart, only redshirt freshman Tyrone
McCiraw has not sustained an injury.
Last weekend, converted freshman corner
back Corey Gatewood stepped in at running
back and rushed five times for 63 yards, com

billing with McGraw (11 carries for 89 yards
and a touchdown) for a 152-yard performance.
As for the Cougars, they are almost a mirror
image of Stanford — Washington State has
limped through its Pac-10 schedule rocked by
depth issues and attrition. The Cougs differ
from the Card in two key respects: They have
an established, record-setting quarterback,
and their fifth-year coach is likely fighting for
his job.
Injuries may define the game, as Stanford's
depleted offense will counter a Cougar attack
missing its leading rusher, Dwight lardy, who
tore his ACL against UCLA. For the Cardinal,
senior cornerback Nick Sanchez's status is cur
rently unknown.
The Cougars feature the most experienced
quarterback in the conference, Alex Brink.The
fifth-year senior from Eugene, Ore. has started
37 straight games,moving into the starting line
up as a freshman when Josh Swogger's 2(X)4
season was cut short by injuries sustained
against Stanford. Brink already heads the
WSU record books when it comes to passing

— he's first in attempts,completions,yards and
touchdowns and second in completion per
centage. For his career. Brink is 768 for 1319 for
9,751 yards.
WSU head coach Bill Doha, in his fifth year
as head coach and 19th overall with the pro
gram, has been under fire the past two seasons.
Doha (28-28) was promoted from the de
fensive coordinator position after Mike Price
left for Alabama and followed up a 10-3 cam
paign with records of 5-6. 4-7 and 6-6. Under
Price, he was known for some risk-taking but
dominant defensive units, including the
"Palouse Posse" that led the Cougars to a No. 7
finish in 1994, but has struggled as a head coach
with consistency and decision-making.
A loss to a lackluster Stanford team might
raise the heat.
Cougar receiver Michael Bumpus is also
looking to keep up the record-breaking trend
for the Cougars. He is tied with Hugh Camp
bell for 176 receptions and will almost surely

NOTES
— Stanford has won the last two
games played at Martin Stadium, fol
lowing up a 23-17 win in 2004 with a
24-21 victory in 2005. Washington
State won 36-10 last year at Stanford
Stadium, scoring nine points on de
fense in a blowout contest that saw
the first appearance of the oft-ma
ligned "quick-kick." The third-down
punt was first employed on a third
and-long from the Stanford one-yard
line; quarterback Trent Edwards
pinned WSU in its own territory on
the surprise play.
— The first of many great passing
quarterbacks for Washington State
was Jack Thompson (Class of 1978),
whose nephew is Stanford starter
Tavita Pritchard. Pritchard's father
also played for the Cougars.
Pritchard has alluded to his uncle's
influence, saying Thompson has em
phasized staying calm in pressure sit
uations. Doha said last week he
wished WSU had recruited
Pritchard; the Cougars instead
signed a Fresno quarterback who has
since dropped out of school.
