## UnsiLenced 'Lambs' 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION SHEPHERD 
"Lions for Lambs," the
newest project of movie star
turned-director-turned-movie
star and director Robert Red
ford, is an evocative and
thought-provoking film that
deals with war, politics and
engagement in America's
youth. But then about 600 of
you out there in Stanfordland
already know that, as you
packed Cubberley Auditori
um to the gills to watch a spe
cial early screening by the
Stanford Film Society on Oc
tober 30. Since you are pre
sumably not interested in
reading about things you al
ready know, I invite those se
lect few to skip ahead to the
interview with Robert Red
ford. The rest of you. sit back
and listen to what 1 have to
say, damnit.
I tend not to like movies.
When I watch movies, my default
setting is one I would describe as

"spiteful disdain": I paid $10 to see
you, so you'd better give me my
money's worth, you bastard. Few
movies are able to lift my darkened
brow and turn my frown upside
down. "Lions for Lambs" was one
of those few.
The film deals with three in
terconnecting stories: in one. Sena
tor Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise)
tells reporter Janine Roth (Meryl
Streep) about a new plan for the
destruction of the Taliban and
the completion of the war in
Afghanistan. In another, best
friends Ernest (Michael Pena)
and Arian (Derek Luke) lead a
troop of Marines into battle to ex
ecute Irving's plan. In the third,
Ernest and Arian's former politi
cal science professor, Stephen
Malley (Robert Redford), tells
bright but cynical Todd Hayes
(newcomer Andrew Garfield) the
story of his former students.
Ernest and Arian, more than
any other characters in "Lions for
Lambs," drive the plot forward
and keep the film from stagnating.
Their storyline has by far the most

action, starting when
their mission is botched
and the two of them are
stranded on an Afghani
mountaintop teeming
with Taliban guerrillas.

In addition, their lives are central
to the other two stories, both as in
dividuals (in the story of Professor
Malley and Todd Hayes) and as

representatives of the U.S. military
(in the interview between Senator
Irving and Janine Roth).
As the two best friends try to survive
against progressively worsening odds, we
loan through Pnfcssor Malleus story and
flashbacks how they got to in
the first place. Their tale is one of engage

involved in their ootrtiy and its govern
mental process, even if that meant going to
war.

Engagement, ultimately, is
what "Lions for Lambs" is
about and is the reason that
Redford and the film's pro
ducers have pushed so hard
to get it screened on college
campuses. The movie is
meant to prompt open dia
logue about the state of
American* politics and the
war on terror, and as an ex
hortation to America's

youth to educate itself and take
part in our government. In this ca
pacity, 1 believe, it succeeds.
The film treats the war issue
fairly: it does not flinch from indict
ing the government for its failures
in Afghanistan and Iraq, nor does
it take the Michael Moore,

George-Bush-is-responsible-for-1
all-the-evil-in-the-world stance. In |
an effort to present all sides, the ■
film probably does not go in-depth |
enough on any one issue, but it _
does accomplish its goal of pre-1
senting the audience with informa
tion and letting them decide.
As a method of inciting ■
youthful involvement in politics, I
it remains to be seen how "Lions I
for Lambs" will function. I don't ■
have high hopes of great success; |
I certainly don't see this film be- .
coming the movie that revolu- I
tionized the way America's youth
thinks about politics and sparked I
a wave of young adult enthusi- ■
asm, but I think it's a useful movie I
for the teenage apathetic to see, I
merely as a reminder that Ameri- ■
ca is his country too and that it de-1
serves his respect and his effort, j
