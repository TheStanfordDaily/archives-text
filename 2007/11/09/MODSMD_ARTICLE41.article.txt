# Roundtable with Redford
## 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION LION-TAMER 
The following questions are from a round-table interview,
with representatives from several Bay Area colleges and a
high schoo.l interviewing Robert Redford simultaneously.
QUESTION 1: How did you get involved in "Lions for
Lambs"? Were you involved with the film from the begin
ning, or did you come on in the later stages?
ROBERT REDFORD: The project had been around for a
while, but people had been afraid to make it — not only be
cause it deals with difficult issues, but because it's hard to
make a bunch of talking heads in a room [which is what much
of the film consists of) dramatic. I came on the project in Sep
tember of '06; Meryl Streep was already attached, then [Tom]
Cruise came to me later on. It was a very tight filming sched
ule; we started shooting in January and had it done within a
couple of months.
QUESTION 2: You created the Sundance Film Festival in the
early '80s. How involved are you in the festival nowadays?
RR: 1 spent a lot of time in [the festival) the first few years.
There were only three festivals at the time. and...none existed

[exclusively for independent films]. So it was a tough go; the
first year I was there we only had one theater.... So I'd be
standing out in the street, and some guy would walk by and I'd
go. "Hey, come on in!" and he'd say, "Hey, what are you doing
here?" Now, though, 60,000 people come to the festival, so as
that's developed, I've moved back further.
INTERMISSION: About "Lions for Lambs," it was interest
ing to see how you represented all the different viewpoints. I
thought that was fascinating.
RR: It would be very easy to make this a piece oL.propagan
da. But that's not fair. 1 mean, the military's doing the best
they can...that's the problemo. So the film's trying to say...that
the guys who a»e making the decisions are the guys who were
never were in the military. And that's a direct issue that I think
we have to face —the incompetence of the people who arc
designing these wars, who are not equipped.

SD: I thought it
was very bold that
you literally have
a senator admit
ting to the fact
that the govern
ment made mis- j

takes in the war in Iraq. Have you gotten any response from
the government vis-a-vis that indictment?
RR: That's why I was excited about this film; it's so complex.
We present people with a duel [between Cruise's senator and
Streep's reporter] and let them decide. There's very, very sub-

tie stuff going on. [Cruise] says,
"Yeah, mistakes were madc...but >•

who could have known?" So
she [Streep] never really

gets him to own up to the
government's mistakes.

It's just meant to make 1
you think that something's

' — c i
gotta change, and it should
change quickly, and the peo-

ple who are gonna change

it are you guys.
