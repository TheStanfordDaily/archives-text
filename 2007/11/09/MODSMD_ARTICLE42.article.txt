SD: Whai audience are you trying to at
tract with this film? Is it aimed specifically .
at college students? j

RR: Yeah, it is. I'm hoping not to indict all

young people as being like [Andrew
Garfield's] student...where he's not
getting involved in the things that are
gonna affect his life. So, yeah, I would
hope that young people would look at

that and say, "'This is the time when
we should get involved." And I j

would hope that older people
would look at it and say, '"How

can you let people like these —
like the ones in our administra
tion—ever get there? How |
can you ever let that happen?" |
