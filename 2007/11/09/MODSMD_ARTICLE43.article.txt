## Not quite an American classic 
### ALEX COLEY INTERMISSION WISEGUY 
Morality is a funny thing. Most of us
probably think we do a line job separating Good
from Evil. Murder is bad. helping the poor is good
— intuitions like these form the backbone of our
moral lives. One beautiful thing about gangster
films, when done right, is their uncanny knack for
cornering our commonsense morality into a grimy
back alleyway way Uptown, dousing it in a gallon of
lighter fluid, setting it ablaze and unloading a clip of
bullets into its emaciated corpse. And as viewers,
like doped-up addicts,.we don't notice a thing.
Now. replace commonsense morality with a help
less human victim, and; put the gun in the hand of an
Academy Award-winning actor. This is our intro
duction to Frank Lucas {Denzel Washington), leg
endary black gangster from New York's bad old
days of the 'tiUs and '70s. tor whom murder is as sim
ple as profit maximization and pulling a trigger.
Ridley Scott's epic. "American Gangster." tries
hard to sweep our commonsense morality off its feet
to smuggle us into a moral Hell disguised as Heaven
(not without the help of DenzeVs infectious screen
presence). But this time, something just doesn't sit
right.
In I ike most mob movies. ""American Gangster"
gnes us the story from both sides of the law. Step
ping into the role of Essex County. N.J.. police offi
cer Richie Roberts is Russell Crowe, the film's other
Hollywood giant. Crowe is wonderful as the arche
typal honest cop, an outcast among peers in an era of
rampant police corruption (whose main representa
tive.is a vile Josh Brolin).
But in "American Gangster." everything good
comes twinned with the bad: though Roberts puts
life and fob on the line for the sake of justice, his do
mestic situation is a disaster. He can't even find the
time to raise his kid and prevent his wife (Carla Gug
ino) from shipping off to Vegas, with custody. No.
he's too busy playing ball with the 'guys and (shud
der) romancing his divorce attorney for that.
Standing in stark contrast, of course, is
I ucas. whose filial piety and impecca

ble home furnishing skills
make this street-tough gangster
look saintly.
Murderou> mama's bov. meet the right- V
ecus womanizer. A clash of two personal
ities as different as the two banks ol the H
Hudson from which each hails.
On this premise, the plot falls in place
simply enough: Lucas rides his way to fame
and'glory on the trusty economic workhorse I
of Supply and Demand. He sells a premium S
product — pure, unmixed heroin branded
"Blue Magic" — for half the price of the wa
tered-down dope. effectiveK monopolizing fl
the market, which had been humming along ■
under the supervision of the Italians. Econ I ■
also tells us that there ain't no such thing as a
free lunch, and Lucas ends up paying the price:
he becomes Public Enemy Number One lot
venerable Detective Roberts.
As you can imagine, the twisting paths of
Roberts,and Lucas ultimately converge, leading
to a provocative finish (based on truth stranger
than fiction). All the while Scott fills the screen
with stirring images of New York at its bleakest,
the American Dream at its most elusive. Unfortu
nately . "American Gangster" just isn't as complex
as you want it to be. For every shot of Frank Lucas
taking his mother to church, the film has one of a
baby Cry ing over a dead mother rotting away in the
projects, another life surrendered to "Blue Magic."
This blatant counterpoint doesn't create shades of
moral gray, doesn't blur lines of Good and Evil — ii
frustrates the viewer and makes Lucas all the more
accountable.
" American Gangster" is a thrill to watch simply
because Washington and Crowe are a thrill to watch.
With Scott at the helm, bad old Harlem comes alive,
and it drips with sweat, funk, blood, decay. The film
has all the makings of a gangster classic but lacks the
most important ingredient: a true
moral gray area.
