## Great Expectations Cardinal looking to excel in tough Pac-10, validate preseason No. 21 ranking 
### BEN SPIELBERG 
The Report

In Trent Johnson's fourth season as
head coach. Stanford Basketball is
on the verge of a breakout cam
paign. The Cardinal returns all of
last year's key players from a squad
that finished 18-15 and earned an
NCAA postseason berth.
"We have a level of comfort." said ju
nior Anthony Goods after the team's 82-70
exhibition victory over Concordia Univer
sity. "We're older, more mature, bigger,
stronger."
Despite an earlv exit in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament after being em
barrassed by Louisville, the Cardinal
turned a number of heads last year after
key victories over ranked opponents. Stan
ford beat both Oregon (who made the
Elite Eight) and L'CLA (who advanced to
the Final Four) at home and was the only
basketball team to win at Virginia's home
court last season. However, after losing
five of its final six games, the Cardinal wall
be searching for consistency in 200"
Scoring should not be an issue for this
team. Goods and junior All Pac-10 selec
tion Lawrence Hill combined for 28.5 ppg
last season. After averaging 13.7 ppg in
Stanford's seven game swing through Italy
this summer, sophomore Landry Fields
looks poised to emerge as another signifi
cant scoring threat in his second season.
Getting the ball into these player's
hands may be a different story, though.
The Cardinal struggled against defensive
pressure List season, and problems han
dling the ball were evident in the team's 78-
58 loss to Louisville in the first round of last
year's Tournament.
"Those are the things we're going to
have to do against high-caliber teams."
Johnson said "We're going to he tine on
the halfcourt. If teams w ant to sit back in a
half court and play man-to-man or play a
zone, we're going to have a level of success,
but for us. we know w hat our Achilles heel
is."
Many players will have the opportunity
to emerge as the solution at the point guard
position. Junior Mitch Johnson, one of the
team's best on-ball defenders, will be look
ing to improve on a sophomore campaign
in which he finished sixth in the Pac-10 in
assist-tumover ratio. Drew Shiller. who
transferred from the L'niversity of San
Francisco and sat out last season due to
NCAA rules, will get the opportunity to

earn minutes at point guard. Goods and
fifth-year senior Fred Washington will
handle the ball often, and junior Kenny
Brown may contribute off the bench.
Critics also point to sophomore Brook
Lopez's current academic ineligibility as a
reason the team may struggle. Lopez made
the Pac-10's All-Freshman team last year
behind 12.6 points and 6.0 rebounds per
game but will miss this season's first nine
contests. His absence contributed to Stan
ford's fall from 13th to 23rd in ESPN's pre
season rankings.
The team, however, has a brighter oct
look.
"The Brook situation is ÜBfortraate,
but as a team. »e are family." Goods
stressed. "And as soon as that came down,
we handled that and we moved on."
Lopez had a back injury and missed the
team's first six games last season, but Stan
ford still managed a 5-1 record without the
star big man. Lopez is practicing with the
team now. and he should be back in action
before conference play begins
Even without Brook Lopez, the Cardi
nal's frontcourt is formidable. Robin
Lopez. Brook's twin brother, finished sec
ond on Stanford's all-ume single season
blocks list last year as a freshman. Aside
from his defensive presence. Robin's size
and athleticism create mismatches down
low Senior Taj Finger, whose playing time
will increase with Brook out. is one of the
Pac-10's top defenders, while Hill led the
team in rebounds and scoring.
Peter Prowitt. freshman Josh Owens,
one of the team's rm*st athlenc big men and
red-shirts Will Paul and Da'veed Dildy
round out the roster.
Barring injury , the Cardinal should be
one of the Pac-10's top teams. Even with
Lopez's ineligibility and some ball-han
dling issues, the combination of experi
ence. talent and depth on the team this
year should bring Trent Johnson his first
20-win season 3S Stanford head coach.
"I think we're worthy of where we're
picked in our conference." Johnson said.
"But we need to prove it."
Starting with today's opener against
Harvard, the Cardinal will have the chance
to do just that.
