# THE 						LOOKOUT
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON 
# UCLA — Ben Howland Has proven himself to be one of the nation's
best college coaches after leading two good (but not great) teams to
the Final Four. This year — even with Arron Afflalo gone in the first
round of the NBA Draft — Howland's team is stacked. The only question is:
Who's going to be the go-to scorer? Point guard Darren Collison is a strong
shooter (and maybe the best player in the league) but hasn't been the go-to to
date. Fellow junior guard Josh Shipp may also step up. 6-foot-10 freshman
center Kevin Love could also live up to the hype as one of the best big men in
the country. Pick your poison. The Bruins will be lethal.
i% WASHINGTON STATE — The Cougars are often said to will their
way to victory with their methodical cutting and blocking offense, but
don't bet on their talent. Senior guards Derrick Low and Kyle Weaver
are NBA-ready and two of the most underrated players in the league. Their
biggest concerns are post-play (after losing the versatile Ivory Clark) and the
fact that the rest of the conference isn't going to be sleeping on them anymore
after they went 13-5 in the Pac-10 in coach Tony Bennett's first season.
o STANFORD — The frontcourt of the Lopez twins and Lawrence Hill is
the best in the league — all three are potential First-Team All-Pac-10
players. There are also a couple major points that the Card will need to
be on top of. Junior point guard Mitch Johnson doesn't need to match Collison's
output, but he does need to knock down the open shot and handle the ball
well. Sophomore guard Landry Fields and freshman forward Josh Owens don't
need to be world-beaters, but they do need to play well enough that Trent
Johnson can play Fields for 20 and Owens for 10 minutes per game. Otherwise
the starters are simply going to wear down by March.
OREGON — Point guard Aaron Brooks was one of the nation's best
last year, and his departure will hurt a team that made last year's Elite
Eight. The Ducks are still in good shape, though, as they bring back the
dynamo offensive trio of Tajuan Porter, Bryce Taylor and Malik Hairston.
if- WASHINGTON — Spencer Hawes is a big loss, as much for his
physical presence and rebounding on this defensively-challenged team
as for his scoring. With guards Justin Dentmon, Ryan Appleby and
Stanford transfer Tim Morris and forwards Quincy Pondexter and Jon Brock
man, the Huskies have a proven core that can compete with anyone in the

get his team to fight hard on defense? Give Howland or Bennett these players
and that team might just win the Pac-10.
use — O.J. Mayo, O.J. Mayo. We get it — the freshman guard is
going to be good, the best in years if the hype is to be believed. Two
words, though: Nick Young. And two more: Gabe Pruitt. I don't care
how good Mayo is — he's not an upgrade over the two guards currently in the
NBA.
m ARIZONA — Not as sexy a preseason team as USC, they could still
W definitely make noise, with their only big loss being forward Marcus
Williams. Forward Chase Budinger is a legit beast, but none of their
other players really stand out. Honestly, UCLA and Washington State are clearly
1 -2 and the bottom three teams are pretty obvious, but 3-7 is a big jumble.
Theoretically, all five of these teams could sneak into the NCAAs, but I'd expect
Washington, USC and the Wildcats to be battling for the final two spots.
£ ARIZONA STATE — Jeff Pendergraph is a legitimate All-Confer
ence player, and the incoming recruits will make an immediate differ
ence. The depth still isn't there to push the top half of the league, but
no team outside of Pullman fights harder than these guys. The Sun Devils
should spring some big upsets, have a chance in every game they play, and
with just one senior, set the table for a big push in 2008.
A CAL — Sorry, but I'm just not buying it. Aside from forward Ryan An
derson, the posts are undersized and slow compared to the top
teams in the league — that's a bad combination. Theo Robertson is a
good second or third option at guard, but with Ayinde Übaka's graduation, he's
suddenly the go-to guy in the backcourt? Uh oh. The Bears finished under .500
overall and 6-12 in the league last year. This year, they should be about as
strong, but their record might not reflect it as the rest of the league is signifi
cantly better.
rf| OREGON STATE — How long until baseball season again? For
ward Marcel Jones is the conference's most underrated player, but
one player does not make a team. The Beavers won just three con
ference games last year and might not win a single one in this year's loaded
Pac-10.
