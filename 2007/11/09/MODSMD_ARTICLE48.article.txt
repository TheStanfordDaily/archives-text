# DEALING WITH LOSS
## NO LOPEZ, NO PROBLEM 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
The fans may express concern, but the men's
basketball team doesn't like to dwell on the ab
sence of sophomore forward Brook Lopez.
Talk to the players and they would much rather
chat about the coming breakout year for
sophomore guard Landry Fields or the fact
that they will return the entire starting lineup from a team that
finished 18-13 and made the NCAA Tournament.
But it's hard to ignore the fact that the seven-foot Lopez
will once again start the season in street clothes, ruled acade
mically ineligible for fall quarter. His academic issues, on top
of missed practices, led head coach Trent Johnson to take fur
ther action, temporarily suspending the sophomore from all
team activities last month.
He was reinstated after a week and so impressed his coach
after returning to practice that Johnson joked that he should
make the suspensions a weekly tradition.
But the team is determined not to let the saga with Lopez
become a distraction on the court, where expectations are
running high — to the tune of top-25 preseason rankings from
the AP and ESPN/USA Today polls.
"The Brook situation is unfortunate, but as a team, we are
family," junior guard Anthony Goods said following Sun
day's 82-70 exhibition win over Concordia. "And as soon as
that came down, we handled that. We moved on. It's all in the
past, [and] Brook's on the team, practicing. Everything's good
and we're taking it one day at a time."
"We're not really even thinking about it," senior forward
Fred Washington said. "I don't know ... you just have to deal
with it."
It could be worse, after all. Lopez flirted with going pro last
spring, opting to return to Stanford despite scouts' projections
that he would be a potential top-10 Lottery pick in the NBA
draft. The Cardinal opened 4-1 last season while Lopez re
covered from back surgery and will have him healthy and
game-ready once he regains eligibility mid-December.
Until then, the players insist, they'll be fine.
"1 don't think we've ever considered ourselves a one-man
team," Washington said. "We played without Brook before,
last season. It's something we're used to doing."
Stanford will rely on Brook's twin, Robin, to anchor the
paint while his brother is out, a familiar role for the center
whose 73 blocks last season ranked second in Stanford histo
ry. With sophomore big man Will Paul redshirting for the sea
son, senior center Peter Prowitt will have the opportunity to
make an impact inside as well.
"Peter Prowitt is going to play solidly," said team co-cap
tain Taj Finger, singing the praises of his fellow senior and
one-time duct partner at the Stanford Sixth Man kickoff
event. "He's going to be able to do a lot of good stuff to help
the team. We're going to need Pete, definitely, to back up
Robin and Brook. With their situations, no one knows what's
going to happen, so Pete's going to have a lot of opportuni
ties."
Junior forward Lawrence Hill, last season's leading scorer
(15.7 points per game), and Goods, who led the team with 22
points against Concordia, will continue to carry the scoring

load. Finger and Washington will again add versatility and en
ergy to the rotation, while junior Mitch Johnson will return to
the starting lineup at the point.
Trent Johnson said his squad was "clearly a much better
team" than last year; his optimism is tempered, though, hv the
reality of a tough Pac-10 conference. When asked if he agreed
with Stanford's projected fifth-place finish in conference
standings, Johnson said he did.
"But we need to prove it,"he quickly added. "We need to
prove it."
The players, for their part, said continuity and consistency
would be key to building on last season's successes and for
getting the disappointing finish — as well as October's bad

"It's a new team in the sense that we're older, more mature, bigger, stronger."

news about Brook.
"I think [returning our starters] makes things easier be
cause we have a level of comfort," Goods said. "We've been
together since the spring and we've been able to grow togeth
er with workouts, but everything that happened last year, we
have to get that behind us. It's a new team in the sense that
we're older, more mature, bigger, stronger. So we've just got
to come out, we've got to focus and we've got to work hard."
For the next month and a half, at least, as their star waits
anxiously from the bench, the Cardinal will have to work all
the harder.
