# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Dec. 3 vs. Texas Tech
The Cardinal beat the Red Raiders 70-59 last year in San Jose in one of
Stanford's biggest non-conference wins of the year. This season's matchup
with legendary coach Bobby Knight's squad is arguably the Cardinal's
toughest non-Pac-10 test. The game will be nationally televised on ESPN2
and will be a good early barometer of the team's abilities. If everything goes
according to plan in the early season, Stanford should be 10-0 entering the
contest.
Jan. 3/5 vs. ucla/usc
Stanford begins its Pac-10 season with the L.A. schools —no easy task
considering No. 2 UCLA and No. 18 USC are two of the nation's pre
mier teams. The Bruins have reached the Final Four each of the last two
seasons — despite dropping a game to the Cardinal las* year — and the
Trojans will likely be looking to avenge last season's 65-50 blowout loss
to Stanford. Both schools are loaded with talent: the Bruins boast presea
son Ail-American guard Darren Collison and one of the country's most
outstanding freshman, big man Kevin Love. The Trojans have an explo
sive freshman of their own, guard O.J. Mayo, who many considered the
nation's top recruit last year.
Jan. 1 3 @ Oregon
In its second week of conference play, the Cardinal will travel to the Ore
gon schools. Stanford will not receive a warm welcome at the No. 12
Ducks' home court; nicknamed "The Pit," McArthur Court is one of the
country's toughest arenas for opposing teams to play in. Oregon ad
vanced to last year's Elite Eight — farther than any other Pac-10 team save
UCLA — and will be looking to validate its high preseason ranking.
Feb. 16 @ Arizona
The No. 17 Wildcats have more question marks than any other preseason
top-25 team. Sophomore forward Chase Budinger is one of the country's
best players, but the talent surrounding him has been inconsistent at best.
Arizona has made 23 straight NCAA Tournament appearances — more
than any other program — but that streak could be in jeopardy this year.
This game could be the kind of gutty road win that could vault Stanford into
the national focus.
Mar. 1 vs. Washington State
The No. 10 Cougars were one of the country's biggest surprises last year,
coming out of nowhere to finish second in the vaunted Pac-10. Second
year coach Tony Bennett won last year's national Coach of the Year award
after leading his team to a 13-5 Pac-10 record despite being picked to fin
ish last in the Pac-10 preseason media poll. In the Cardinal's penultimate
weekend of conference play, a win over the Cougars could provide some
momentum heading into the Pac-10 tournament.
