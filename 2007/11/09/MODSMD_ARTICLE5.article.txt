# Pat Maynor
## Football LINEBACKER CONTINUES FAMILY TRADITION 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
For a lot of Cardinal football play
ers, the game is in their blood.The
roster is ch<Kk-full of players like
sophomore quarterback Tavita
Pritchard. whose uncle set
NCAA passing records, or sophomore
right tackle Chris Marinelli. whose father,
uncle and cousin have all played in the
trenches of NCAA football.

Junior linebacker Pat Maynor is no dif
ferent, although his journey to the Farm
has perhaps been stranger than most.
"Growing up. I was a Florida Gators
fan," Maynor said. "My dad | Mark] played
there, and I'd been to countless games in
Gainesville. Actually, I was never a Stan
ford fan. I knew Stanford had a basketball
team and I knew it was a good school, but
the thought of going there never even
crossed my mind, even as a freshman in
high school."

But after a coincidental meeting late in
his high school career, all that changed.
"Stanford was recruiting a quarter
hack at my high school, and my head
coach at the time had gotten me out of
class to meet IV Willingham, who had
come to my school," he explained."And so
from there on,even though Ty Willingham
had left and Buddy Teevens was the new
Stanford coach, we still kept the same con
nections [with the school)."
Those connections would serve the
gritty linebacker well, as Maynor
would go on to make steady improve
ment as a reliable run-stuffer after
redshirting his freshman year. This
season, the Jupiter. Fla. native ranks
third on the squad with 70 tackles,
trailing only sophomores Bo McNal
ly and Clinton Snyder. His transfor
mation from last year — when he
recorded 44 tackles in nine starts —

has been nothing short of remark
able.
"I'd say,compared to last year, just
going into the games I feel a lot more
prepared on my assignments and
what I'm supposed to do," Maynor
said. "And the way they teach this de
fense, it's about gap assignments.
Everyone has a gap to protect. 1 think
last year 1 would try to do too much.

[but) this year I'm not doing that — 1
get it done and I trust my teammates
that they're going to get it done."
Tackles, of course, can be a some
what misleading statistic. So much
depends on where and how an offen
sive player is brought down that try
ing to judge a player based on the
sheer number of his takedowns can
be an exercise in futility.

But Maynor leads Stanford in the
critical tackles-for-loss statistic, hav
ing brought down 10 ball carriers be
hind the line of scrimmage this year,
good for second in the Pac-ll). ITic
junior has even developed a streak of
versatility, excelling in the pass-rush
this year with five sacks, the second
highest total on the team.
As Maynor explains, succeeding
in the Pac-10 requires a relentless
drive, game-in and game-out.
"You've got to know you're going
to face a lot of great offenses, a lot of
great running backs," he said.
"You're never going to have an off
week in the backfield. It doesn't
matter who you play — they're all
good. You've got to bring it every
Saturday if you even want to have a
chance."
But of course, Stanford's defense
didn't live up to that credo last week
end. Hie Cardinal was gashed on the
ground by Washington for 388 yards
rushing as Huskies running back
Louis Rankin and quarterback Jake
Locker demolished the Cardinal de
fense.
"We prepared all week for it."
Maynor said. "They didn't come out
and put us in any situations that we
hadn't seen in practice. It really was
n't magic what they did.
"We knew the quarterback was
going to keep it. we knew we had to
stop both of them and we were put in
situations [where] we knew what
they were going to run."he went on
to say. "And we just couldn't get off
blocks. We were in one-on-one situa
tions and we couldn't make the play
[because| we couldn't get off
blocks."
Despite his team's poor perform
ance on the whole, Maynor's person
al stat-line was nevertheless impres

sive once again, as he notched 13
tackles — two for a loss — and one
sack against the Huskies. And even
with the crushing outing against
UW. the Cardinal's enthusiasm at
Wednesday's practice was never in
doubt — a change in team de
meanor the new coaching staff has
brought with it.
"Last year I just saw kids who
weren't having fun playing," Maynor
said. "It wasn't really football for us;
it was like a job. We weren't having
fun; we weren't confident in our
selves. ITiis year we're having fun,
and 1 think we're getting so prepared
for these games and we have confi
dence in our technique."
And as for this week, Maynor
knows that the Cougars will pose a
big challenge for Stanford in Full
man. Wash.
"We know we're going in there
and it's going to be wet. it's going to
be cold, it's going to be a hostile en
vironment." he said of the road envi
ronment in eastern Washington.
"And they're a good team. They just
played Cal last week, and they
played them real close. Being in the
Pac-10 you can't look ahead to any
games because you'll come out and
get whooped."
That focus is the present overrid
ing theme of Maynor's outlook. It
seems that if there's one thing Stan
ford's most veteran linebacker has
learned in his time on the Farm, it's
that it will never do good to look too
far ahead.
Unless, of course, he's knifing into
the backfield to stop yet another play
before it has the chance to get started.

blocks. We were in one-on-one situa
tions and we couldn't make the play
[because| we couldn't get off
blocks."
Despite his team's poor perform
ance on the whole, Maynor's person
al stat-line was nevertheless impres

sive once again, as he notched 13
tackles — two for a loss — and one
sack against the Huskies. And even
with the crushing outing against
UW. the Cardinal's enthusiasm at
Wednesday's practice was never in
doubt — a change in team de
meanor the new coaching staff has
brought with it.
"Last year I just saw kids who
weren't having fun playing," Maynor
said. "It wasn't really football for us;
it was like a job. We weren't having
fun; we weren't confident in our
selves. ITiis year we're having fun,
and 1 think we're getting so prepared
for these games and we have confi
dence in our technique."
And as for this week, Maynor
knows that the Cougars will pose a
big challenge for Stanford in Full
man. Wash.
"We know we're going in there
and it's going to be wet. it's going to
be cold, it's going to be a hostile en
vironment." he said of the road envi
ronment in eastern Washington.
"And they're a good team. They just
played Cal last week, and they
played them real close. Being in the
Pac-10 you can't look ahead to any
games because you'll come out and
get whooped."
That focus is the present overrid
ing theme of Maynor's outlook. It
seems that if there's one thing Stan
ford's most veteran linebacker has
learned in his time on the Farm, it's
that it will never do good to look too
far ahead.
Unless, of course, he's knifing into
the backfield to stop yet another play
before it has the chance to get started.

The Associated Press
Stanford linebacker Pat Maynor (right) helps bring down explosive Oregon running back Jonathan Stewart. Maynor
had one of his best statistical games of the season against the Ducks, racking up 13 total tackles and a sack.
For a lot of Cardinal football play
ers, the game is in their blood.The
roster is ch<Kk-full of players like
sophomore quarterback Tavita
Pritchard. whose uncle set
NCAA passing records, or sophomore
right tackle Chris Marinelli. whose father,
uncle and cousin have all played in the
trenches of NCAA football.

Junior linebacker Pat Maynor is no dif
ferent, although his journey to the Farm
has perhaps been stranger than most.
"Growing up. I was a Florida Gators
fan," Maynor said. "My dad | Mark] played
there, and I'd been to countless games in
Gainesville. Actually, I was never a Stan
ford fan. I knew Stanford had a basketball
team and I knew it was a good school, but
the thought of going there never even
crossed my mind, even as a freshman in
high school."

But after a coincidental meeting late in
his high school career, all that changed.
"Stanford was recruiting a quarter
hack at my high school, and my head
coach at the time had gotten me out of
class to meet IV Willingham, who had
come to my school," he explained."And so
from there on,even though Ty Willingham
had left and Buddy Teevens was the new
Stanford coach, we still kept the same con
nections [with the school)."
Those connections would serve the
gritty linebacker well, as Maynor
would go on to make steady improve
ment as a reliable run-stuffer after
redshirting his freshman year. This
season, the Jupiter. Fla. native ranks
third on the squad with 70 tackles,
trailing only sophomores Bo McNal
ly and Clinton Snyder. His transfor
mation from last year — when he
recorded 44 tackles in nine starts —

has been nothing short of remark
able.
"I'd say,compared to last year, just
going into the games I feel a lot more
prepared on my assignments and
what I'm supposed to do," Maynor
said. "And the way they teach this de
fense, it's about gap assignments.
Everyone has a gap to protect. 1 think
last year 1 would try to do too much.

[but) this year I'm not doing that — 1
get it done and I trust my teammates
that they're going to get it done."
Tackles, of course, can be a some
what misleading statistic. So much
depends on where and how an offen
sive player is brought down that try
ing to judge a player based on the
sheer number of his takedowns can
be an exercise in futility.

But Maynor leads Stanford in the
critical tackles-for-loss statistic, hav
ing brought down 10 ball carriers be
hind the line of scrimmage this year,
good for second in the Pac-ll). ITic
junior has even developed a streak of
versatility, excelling in the pass-rush
this year with five sacks, the second
highest total on the team.
As Maynor explains, succeeding
in the Pac-10 requires a relentless
drive, game-in and game-out.
"You've got to know you're going
to face a lot of great offenses, a lot of
great running backs," he said.
"You're never going to have an off
week in the backfield. It doesn't
matter who you play — they're all
good. You've got to bring it every
Saturday if you even want to have a
chance."
But of course, Stanford's defense
didn't live up to that credo last week
end. Hie Cardinal was gashed on the
ground by Washington for 388 yards
rushing as Huskies running back
Louis Rankin and quarterback Jake
Locker demolished the Cardinal de
fense.
"We prepared all week for it."
Maynor said. "They didn't come out
and put us in any situations that we
hadn't seen in practice. It really was
n't magic what they did.
"We knew the quarterback was
going to keep it. we knew we had to
stop both of them and we were put in
situations [where] we knew what
they were going to run."he went on
to say. "And we just couldn't get off
blocks. We were in one-on-one situa
tions and we couldn't make the play
[because| we couldn't get off
blocks."
Despite his team's poor perform
ance on the whole, Maynor's person
