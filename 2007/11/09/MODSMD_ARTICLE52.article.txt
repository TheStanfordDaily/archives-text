## Payback time Card hopes to rebound from disappointing end to last season 
### HALEY MURPHY 
The Report

Tast season didn't end the way it was supposed to
for Stanford women's basketball. The Cardinal's
Pac-10 title was eclipsed by a second-round exit
from the NCAA Tournament, and what was
j supposed to be the Candice Wiggins-Brooke
-JtLmmmrnm Smith noon-day sun of Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's program slipped below the horizon.
"We just really want to have a good season, take it game by
game," VanDerveer said at the Pac-10's media day. "We want
everyone to be healthy, and our team has learned from some of
the successes and shortcomings from last year."
Wiggins told ESPN.com that last season's disappointments,
most notably the second-round loss to Florida State, will serve as
motivation to keep the team sharp.
"I think it's going to be very important for us to keep (defeats)
in the back of our minds as we head into the season," she said.
"You ain't forget those losses, because those losses are what
make you a stronger team mentally. And 1 think that loss kind of
exposed our biggest weakness last year, which was our mental
toughness."
With the new season breaking, though. No. 7 Stanford looks to
the fresh opportunities that come with a young team. The four
('ardinal upperclassmen — senior guards Wiggins and Cissy
fierce and junior forwards Morgan Clybum and Jillian Harmon
— will be responsible for helping their nine less-experienced
teammates in adjusting to a highly competitive winter schedule.
VanDerveer professes her full confidence in their collective
ability to do so. and especially noted the strength of Wiggins and
Harmon.
"I'm really excited about the leadership of Candice [Wiggins]
and Jill [Harmon] and the things that they do for our team," she
commented. "They really set a great example in terms of their
toughness and their work ethic, and the experiences that both
C andice and Jill have had will be very helpful for us."
The biggest question remains how quickly their high level of
play will spread to the rest of the team. While the Pac-10 will cer
tainly not present an easy conference schedule, Stanford's great
est challenges begin early, well before Pac-10 play begins on I )ee.
28th. The Card take on four preseason top-15 teams in the open
ing month and a half, including the country's top three ranked
teams.
After today's game against Yale, Stanford will continue
against No. 3 Rutgers this Sunday. Matchups are also scheduled
with No. 2 Connecticut on Nov. 22, No. 15 Baylor on Dec. Ift and
defending national champion No. 1 Tennessee on Dec. 22.
Stanford then jumps into its conference schedule, where it will
face No. 12 Arizona State and No. 13 Cal in home-and-home
