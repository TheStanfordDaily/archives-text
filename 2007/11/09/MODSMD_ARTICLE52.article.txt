## Payback time Card hopes to rebound from disappointing end to last season 
### HALEY MURPHY 
The Report

Tast season didn't end the way it was supposed to
for Stanford women's basketball. The Cardinal's
Pac-10 title was eclipsed by a second-round exit
from the NCAA Tournament, and what was
j supposed to be the Candice Wiggins-Brooke
-JtLmmmrnm Smith noon-day sun of Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's program slipped below the horizon.
"We just really want to have a good season, take it game by
game," VanDerveer said at the Pac-10's media day. "We want
everyone to be healthy, and our team has learned from some of
the successes and shortcomings from last year."
Wiggins told ESPN.com that last season's disappointments,
most notably the second-round loss to Florida State, will serve as
motivation to keep the team sharp.
"I think it's going to be very important for us to keep (defeats)
in the back of our minds as we head into the season," she said.
"You ain't forget those losses, because those losses are what
make you a stronger team mentally. And 1 think that loss kind of
exposed our biggest weakness last year, which was our mental
toughness."
With the new season breaking, though. No. 7 Stanford looks to
the fresh opportunities that come with a young team. The four
('ardinal upperclassmen — senior guards Wiggins and Cissy
fierce and junior forwards Morgan Clybum and Jillian Harmon
— will be responsible for helping their nine less-experienced
teammates in adjusting to a highly competitive winter schedule.
VanDerveer professes her full confidence in their collective
ability to do so. and especially noted the strength of Wiggins and
Harmon.
"I'm really excited about the leadership of Candice [Wiggins]
and Jill [Harmon] and the things that they do for our team," she
commented. "They really set a great example in terms of their
toughness and their work ethic, and the experiences that both
C andice and Jill have had will be very helpful for us."
The biggest question remains how quickly their high level of
play will spread to the rest of the team. While the Pac-10 will cer
tainly not present an easy conference schedule, Stanford's great
est challenges begin early, well before Pac-10 play begins on I )ee.
28th. The Card take on four preseason top-15 teams in the open
ing month and a half, including the country's top three ranked
teams.
After today's game against Yale, Stanford will continue
against No. 3 Rutgers this Sunday. Matchups are also scheduled
with No. 2 Connecticut on Nov. 22, No. 15 Baylor on Dec. Ift and
defending national champion No. 1 Tennessee on Dec. 22.
Stanford then jumps into its conference schedule, where it will
face No. 12 Arizona State and No. 13 Cal in home-and-home

competitions.
Beyond its strength of schedule, the Cardinal
hopes to avoid the injuries that plagued the team
last year, when starting point guard Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude was sidelined with a knee injury
before the first game and then-freshman J.J.
Hones' (4.8 points per game, 90 assists) season
was also ended early, forcing Wiggins to play the
point. Stanford's backcourt has used the offseason
to recuperate and get stronger, which will allow
Wiggins to go back to the shooting guard spot.
"It frees me up to do what 1 like to do most,
which is score," Wiggins said to ESPN. "So it helps
me a lot at the two; it just gives us a different look.
I can always play point if need be, but I think this

year, we'll be pretty good with that position."
With freshman guards Hannah Donaghe and
McDonald's Ail-American Jeanette Pohlen
added to the roster of Gold-Onwude, Hones and
sophomore Melanie Murphy, Wiggins' guidance
will be of utmost importance as she heads the deep
backcourt. Wiggins' knowledge is bolstered by
statistics: she averaged a team-best 16.9 ppg and
had 96 assists in 2006-07. VanDerveer would pre
fer no one else in her place.
"I think she is the best in the country," Van-
Derveer said of Wiggins. "I think she is someone
that you want on your team because of how com
petitive she is... My definition of a great player is
someone that makes others around them better...
C'andice doesn't try to do everything on her own.
She understands that it's a team game of passing,
screening and doing the little things."
VanDerveer will similarly expect Harmon,
who averaged 4.9 rebounds per game and 7.7 ppg
last year, to share her experience and work ethic

with the post players.
"Jillian [does] all the little things; she's a hustle
player," said VanDerveer. "She rebounds, she de
fends, she passes well. She's scrappy, [and] she
gets in there and battles with people. She is my
kind of player. I really enjoy coaching Jillian, and
I really expect her to have a great year."
But Harmon's role at forward should be great
ly enhanced by sophomore Jayne Appel at center.
Appel, named the Pac-1() Freshman of the Year,
averaged 13.2 ppg, 7.5 rpg, and 1.8 blocks while av
eraging only about 19.3 minutes. The key for
Appel will be limiting her fouls to extend her play
ing time.
Wiggins had nothing but praise for the other
half of the spotlighted inside-outside tandem.
"Jayne is amazing," Wiggins said. "I think
(she's) almost unstoppable under the basket be
cause of her build. She has a very unique build:
She has long arms, she's big and she uses her size
extremely well. On top of that, she's so compcti

tive."
Appel and Harmon are joined by freshman
McDonald's All-Aniericans Kayla Pedersen and
Ashley Cimino as well as sophomore Michelle
Harrison, all of whom will likely make substantial
contributions in the post.
This depth and size pushed Stanford to the
front of the pack when coaches predicted the
Card the Pac-10 champion. It also makes the
Card a formidable contender for the national
championship, a goal that Appel told ESPN.com
is made all the more important by Wiggins' final
season.
"I think Candice worked extremely hard all
three years," she said. "Being a part of the team
and seeing it even more has helped me want to get
it for her. So it will definitely be a fight this year to
get [a national championship] for her."

fends, she passes well. She's scrappy, [and] she
gets in there and battles with people. She is my
kind of player. I really enjoy coaching Jillian, and
I really expect her to have a great year."
But Harmon's role at forward should be great
ly enhanced by sophomore Jayne Appel at center.
Appel, named the Pac-1() Freshman of the Year,

ing time.
Wiggins had nothing but praise for the other

"Jayne is amazing," Wiggins said. "I think

Appel and Harmon are joined by freshman

is made all the more important by Wiggins' final
season.
"I think Candice worked extremely hard all

The Report

Tast season didn't end the way it was supposed to
for Stanford women's basketball. The Cardinal's
Pac-10 title was eclipsed by a second-round exit
from the NCAA Tournament, and what was
j supposed to be the Candice Wiggins-Brooke
-JtLmmmrnm Smith noon-day sun of Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's program slipped below the horizon.
"We just really want to have a good season, take it game by
game," VanDerveer said at the Pac-10's media day. "We want
everyone to be healthy, and our team has learned from some of
the successes and shortcomings from last year."
Wiggins told ESPN.com that last season's disappointments,
most notably the second-round loss to Florida State, will serve as
motivation to keep the team sharp.
"I think it's going to be very important for us to keep (defeats)
in the back of our minds as we head into the season," she said.
"You ain't forget those losses, because those losses are what
make you a stronger team mentally. And 1 think that loss kind of
exposed our biggest weakness last year, which was our mental
toughness."
With the new season breaking, though. No. 7 Stanford looks to
the fresh opportunities that come with a young team. The four
('ardinal upperclassmen — senior guards Wiggins and Cissy
fierce and junior forwards Morgan Clybum and Jillian Harmon
— will be responsible for helping their nine less-experienced
teammates in adjusting to a highly competitive winter schedule.
VanDerveer professes her full confidence in their collective
ability to do so. and especially noted the strength of Wiggins and
Harmon.
"I'm really excited about the leadership of Candice [Wiggins]
and Jill [Harmon] and the things that they do for our team," she
commented. "They really set a great example in terms of their
toughness and their work ethic, and the experiences that both
C andice and Jill have had will be very helpful for us."
The biggest question remains how quickly their high level of
play will spread to the rest of the team. While the Pac-10 will cer
tainly not present an easy conference schedule, Stanford's great
est challenges begin early, well before Pac-10 play begins on I )ee.
28th. The Card take on four preseason top-15 teams in the open
ing month and a half, including the country's top three ranked
teams.
After today's game against Yale, Stanford will continue
against No. 3 Rutgers this Sunday. Matchups are also scheduled
with No. 2 Connecticut on Nov. 22, No. 15 Baylor on Dec. Ift and
defending national champion No. 1 Tennessee on Dec. 22.
Stanford then jumps into its conference schedule, where it will
face No. 12 Arizona State and No. 13 Cal in home-and-home

Coach: Tara VanDerveer (28th year)

competitions.
Beyond its strength of schedule, the Cardinal
hopes to avoid the injuries that plagued the team
last year, when starting point guard Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude was sidelined with a knee injury
before the first game and then-freshman J.J.
Hones' (4.8 points per game, 90 assists) season
was also ended early, forcing Wiggins to play the
point. Stanford's backcourt has used the offseason
to recuperate and get stronger, which will allow
Wiggins to go back to the shooting guard spot.
"It frees me up to do what 1 like to do most,
which is score," Wiggins said to ESPN. "So it helps
me a lot at the two; it just gives us a different look.
I can always play point if need be, but I think this

year, we'll be pretty good with that position."
With freshman guards Hannah Donaghe and
McDonald's Ail-American Jeanette Pohlen
added to the roster of Gold-Onwude, Hones and
sophomore Melanie Murphy, Wiggins' guidance
will be of utmost importance as she heads the deep
backcourt. Wiggins' knowledge is bolstered by
statistics: she averaged a team-best 16.9 ppg and
had 96 assists in 2006-07. VanDerveer would pre
fer no one else in her place.
"I think she is the best in the country," Van-
Derveer said of Wiggins. "I think she is someone
that you want on your team because of how com
petitive she is... My definition of a great player is
someone that makes others around them better...
C'andice doesn't try to do everything on her own.
She understands that it's a team game of passing,
screening and doing the little things."
VanDerveer will similarly expect Harmon,
who averaged 4.9 rebounds per game and 7.7 ppg
last year, to share her experience and work ethic

with the post players.
"Jillian [does] all the little things; she's a hustle
player," said VanDerveer. "She rebounds, she de
fends, she passes well. She's scrappy, [and] she
gets in there and battles with people. She is my
kind of player. I really enjoy coaching Jillian, and
I really expect her to have a great year."
But Harmon's role at forward should be great
ly enhanced by sophomore Jayne Appel at center.
