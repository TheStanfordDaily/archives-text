# THE 						LOOKOUT

ft STANFORD — Once again, the No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
— team is favored by both the coaches and the media to take home the Pac
-10 Conference title. Although they are the clear pick at No. 1, the team will
face strong competition in the race for its eighth straight conference crown.
a ARIZONA STATE — The No. 12 Sun Devils had the best season in
_ ASU history last year, winning 31 games and advancing to the Elite Eight
of the NCAA Tournament. Still, they could not solve the conference hex
that Stanford has over them. Leading scorer Emily Westerberg is gone,
but high-octane guard Briann January returns and ASU's depth should be as
threatening as ever.
m CAL — No. 13 Cal has a formidable post duo in reigning Pac-10 Player
ujjp-— of the Year Devanei Hampton and Ashley Walker and returns pretty much
the rest of its squad, too. But the Bears are still not particularly deep, es
pecially at point guard, and they are accordingly too erratic to be considered in the
same class as Arizona State. Cal's season may depend on how well sophomore
point guard Alexis Gray-Lawson recovers from the ACL tear that knocked her out
at the beginning of last season.
JFn use — The Trojans showed flashes of their ability last year, almost
knocking Stanford off at home near the end of the regular season, but in
juries have robbed USC of the chance to take the next step. Livewire
guard Jackie Gemelos will have to wait another year to make her debut after an
other knee injury, and fellow guard Stephanie Gilbreath will also need a redshirt
year. USC is also missing last year's top two scorers. It might take them a while to
get going, but they have certainly done well facing adversity before.
UCLA — An overtime defeat of Cal last year showed the Bruins' poten
— tial, but other than that UCLA did not beat anyone unexpected last year.
Senior forward Lindsey Pluimer broke out with 15.5 points per game last
season and she will anchor the frontcourt. UCLA's big questions are at guard after
Noelle Quinn's departure. Regardless, having the No. 3-rated freshman class in
the nation should help, and the Bruins should climb into the top half of the confer
ence.

i WASHINGTON — The Huskies will drop after losing both their
coach and leading scorer. Forward Andrea Plouffe will take over as the
centerpiece of the offense but she might struggle with the extra atten
tion now that Cameo Hicks is gone. Washington does not get enough production
from its guards, who hurt the team doubly last year with turnovers.
r OREGON —As hard as the offseason was on USC and Washing
ton, the Ducks were hit the hardest and it will show. Only five players
are returning from last season's roster. Junior Tamika Nurse is a good
player but not the type who can carry a team on her back. This season is going to
be all about breaking in the freshmen and getting them ready for the coming
years.
ft ARIZONA — The Wildcats improved towards the end of last season
yQ — and four starters are back from that team. Senior guard Ashley Whiso
nant will run the offense and do some scoring of her own, but the real
question for Arizona is on the other end of the court. They were third-worst in the
Pac-10 in points allowed (67.6 per game) and defensive field goal percentage
(.438) last year. Any improvement in Arizona's record will come from an improve
ment in guarding its own basket.
OREGON STATE — Despite an unflattering record, Oregon State
— was always a tough test last winter. The Beavers are less threatening
this year after losing the top Pac-10 scorer, Casey Nash, and Judie
Lomax. Assist leader Cedes Fox-Griffin returns, but who will she pass to? This
team will not be able to stay close like they could last year.
rh WASHINGTON STATE — The Cougars defined futility last year
T-il and things are not going to improve for them quickly, having lost both the
top scorer and the top rebounder from last year's squad. New coach
June Daugherty took rival Washington to the top of the Pac-10 a few years back, but
it is unclear how much she can do with the personnel she's been handed.
