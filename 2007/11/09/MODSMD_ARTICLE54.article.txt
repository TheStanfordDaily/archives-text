# FRESH FACES
## YOUTH IS SERVED 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
The 2(X)6 women's basketball recruiting class
was among one of the Cardinal's best ever.
Nearly all its members were heavily recruited
coming out of high sch<x)l, and their short time
on the Farm has already paid dividends for the
Cardinal: Jayne Appcl was the third highest
scorer on the team last year, JJ Hones was a starter until she tore
her ACL and Michelle Harrison and Melanie Murphy con
tributed as reserves. Appel, along with senior Candace Wiggins,
was named a preseason finalist for the John R. Wooden Award,
given to the best women's basketball player in the NCAA.
And now, a new freshmen class that may be equally power
ful in its own right joins these current sophomores. The four new
additions to the team were all among the top-25 high schtxil se
niors at their respective positions last year, according to the re
cruiting service Scout.com.
Kavla Pedersen is perhaps the most promising of the group.
She was arguably this year's top power forward recruit and is ex
pected to help fill the void left by forward/center Brooke Smith
'07, the Cardinal's second leading scorer and rebounder last
year.
Pedersen was named a McDonald's, Parade, EA Sports,
USA Today and WBCA All-American last year, and was a
Gatorade Player of the Year for the past two seasons. Addi
tionally, she played on the USA Basketball U-19 squad that
won the gold medal at this year's World Championships.
Ihe 6 foot 4 inch Pedersen chose Stanford over Tennessee,
USC and Duke, among others. While she is at her best in the
post, she is versatile enough to play every position but point
guard. She has a great shot from mid-range and in and is an ex
cellent free throw shooter. She runs well and is a deft passer and
ball handler. Her rebounding skills are unquestionable and,
while it is not her strongest suit, her defense is up to par. In Sat
urday's exhibition against Chico State, Pedersen started and
recorded a double-double, going 5-9 from the field and 3-4 from
the foul line to finish with 13 points and 10 rebounds.
Jeanette Pohlen, a six-foot guard from Brea, Calif, was also
productive in the Chico State game, scoring 16 points off the
bench. She received offers from Arizona State and USC, and
she earned many of the same All-American accolades that Ped
ersen did last year. She was also a C iatorade Player of the Year,
and was named Ms. California Basketball — an award given to
the top female basketball player in the state — in her senior
year.
Known for her durability and floor leadership, Pohlen is a
complete player who scores, passes, rebounds, defends and han
dles the ball very well. She can play the point, as well as the off
guard and small forward.
Joining her in the backcourt is Hannah Donaghe, an athletic
guard from Atascadero, ('alif. She was the least recruited mem
ber of the freshman class, and was the last player to sign with
Stanford. I )onaghe garnered all-state recognition in three of her
years in high school.
She excels both behind the three-point arc and in the key —
her shooting is gtxnJ. and she attacks the basket well. She has all
the tools to develop into a valued contributor to the Cardinal —
she has as much upside as any other recruit. But before that can

happen, she needs to improve her strength and become a better
defender. Donaghe will be able to learn from the best: she and
Pohlen will develop this season behind all-world guard Candice
Wiggins.
Rounding out the freshman class is 6 foot 3 inch forward
Ashley Cimino. A McDonald's and Parade All-American and
(iatorade Player of the Year who was named Ms. Basketball in
Maine last year, Cimino was recruited by programs such as
Maryland and Boston College.
('imino is at her best behind the three-point line, and she's a
great ball handler. She is not strong enough yet to be a success
ful power forward, however, and would fit best as a small for-

ward, but she needs to improve her speed in order to thrive. Un
fortunately, she has missed a significant number of practices this
fall with a persistent back injury that will surely limit her game
time early this season.
After the team's season opener tonight against Yale, Stan
ford will face No. 3 Rutgers and No. 2 Connecticut, throwing the
young squad into the ring at the very beginning of its career. This
year's freshmen may be as talented as their sophomore prede
cessors, and they will have a number of early-season chances to
show whether they can be as successful.
