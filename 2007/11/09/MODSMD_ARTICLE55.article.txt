# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Nov. 1 1 @ Rutgers
The Cardinal travels east this week, facing off against Yale tonight
before heading to New Jersey to take on the No. 3 Scarlet Knights,
last year's national runner-ups who lost to tournament champion
Tennessee in the 2007 title game. Rutgers coach C. Vivian
Stringer made headlines last year for criticizing radio host Don
Imus for his offensive on-air comments about her team, but her
highly-touted team is what should be making waves. This would
be a huge early season win for the Cardinal.
Nov. 22 vs. Connecticut
Less than two weeks after their match-up with Rutgers, the Cardi
nal will play No. 2 Connecticut in the Paradise Jam tournament in
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two top-three teams in two weeks is a tall
order, but if Stanford can come out of these two early season
games unscathed, it will be in prime position for a top seed in this
year's NCAA Tournament. Even a split would be forward progress
for the No. 7 Cardinal.
Dec. 22 vs. Tennessee
As if playing the second- and third-ranked teams weren't enough,
Stanford will host consensus No. 1 and last year's national cham
pions, Tennessee, just before Christmas. Junior forward Candace
Parker leads the Lady Vols into the 2007-2008 season after guid
ing them to last year's national title. A win over Tennessee would
be a nice holiday present for the Cardinal, which lost to the Lady
Vols 77-60 last year.
Jan. 20 @ Arizona State
The No. 12 Sun Devils advanced to last season's Elite Eight, far
ther than any other Pac-10 team, and will be hungry to avenge last
season's heartbreaking 73-65 overtime loss to the Cardinal on
their home court. Knocking on the door of the Final Four won't be
enough for this year's Arizona State squad, which will look to im
prove on its best finish in school history.
Jan. 26 vs. California
The No. 13 Golden Bears were the only conference foe to defeat
the Cardinal in Pac-10 play last year, toppling Stanford 72-57 on
its home court. With Arizona State and rival Cal nipping at its heels
in-conference, the Cardinal must earn wins over these teams to re
assert itself as the preeminent program in the West.
