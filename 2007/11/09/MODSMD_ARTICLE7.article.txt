### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students, faculty and community members rallied
in White Plaza yesterday afternoon to protest the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institu
tion as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow, marking the
one-year anniversary of his resignation as secretary of
defense.
Over two months have passed since Hoover Direc
tor John Raisian announced Rumsfelds one-year ap
pointment. and the controversy surrounding the fel
lowship has not abated. Raisian appeared before the
Faculty Senate yesterday to address concerns over the
appointment [see "Faculty Senate debates Rums
feld"]. The Undergraduate Senate is also expected to
weigh in on the debate in the coming weeks â€” sena
tors tabled a resolution on Tuesday for further revision
to a bill addressing the issue.
Dozens turned out to protest Rumsfeld's appoint
ment yesterday, criticizing his record as a principal ar
chitect of the Iraq war and challenging his credentials
for a Distinguished Visiting Fellowship. Some branded
the former defense secretary a war criminal, while oth
ers said he simply lacked the intellectual background
required for the appointment.
"The goal here today is to make it quite clear that
Rumsfeld doesn't belong at Stanford." said Gail
Sredanovic. M. A. '65, one of seven "Raging Grannies"
who sang a l()-minute set of anti-war songs. "It's fine to
allow him to come and speak here, but to appoint him a
'Distinguished Visiting Fellow' is an insult to all of us."

Students and faculty members gave speeches dur
ing the hour-long rally with performances by the
seven-piece Raging Grannies and the Stanford The
atre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP) inter
spersed throughout. Several of the speakers stressed
their support for free speech and academic freedom
and said their opposition to the appointment was more
than political.
"No one is opposed to having him speak." said Todd
Davis, associate director and lecturer in the symbolic
systems program. "We want him to be accountable for
his term as secretary of defense."
"it's not his politics," added Hilton Obenzinger. as
sociate director for honors writing,"but his practice of
undermining everything a university should be about."

ITie debate over Rumsfeld's appointment has
called into question the relationship between the con
servative-leaning I loover Institution and the Universi
ty at large. Such disputes roiled Stanford during the
mid-1980s when a student and faculty revolt effective
ly derailed plans to place the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial library on campus.
Rumsfeld, who may never set foot on the Farm, was
appointed to serve on a task force pertaining to nation
al security, ideology and terrorism in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11. 2001 terrorist attacks. He is a long-time
supporter of the 1 loover Institution, having served as a
