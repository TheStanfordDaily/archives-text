### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students, faculty and community members rallied
in White Plaza yesterday afternoon to protest the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institu
tion as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow, marking the
one-year anniversary of his resignation as secretary of
defense.
Over two months have passed since Hoover Direc
tor John Raisian announced Rumsfelds one-year ap
pointment. and the controversy surrounding the fel
lowship has not abated. Raisian appeared before the
Faculty Senate yesterday to address concerns over the
appointment [see "Faculty Senate debates Rums
feld"]. The Undergraduate Senate is also expected to
weigh in on the debate in the coming weeks â€” sena
tors tabled a resolution on Tuesday for further revision
to a bill addressing the issue.
Dozens turned out to protest Rumsfeld's appoint
ment yesterday, criticizing his record as a principal ar
chitect of the Iraq war and challenging his credentials
for a Distinguished Visiting Fellowship. Some branded
the former defense secretary a war criminal, while oth
ers said he simply lacked the intellectual background
required for the appointment.
"The goal here today is to make it quite clear that
Rumsfeld doesn't belong at Stanford." said Gail
Sredanovic. M. A. '65, one of seven "Raging Grannies"
who sang a l()-minute set of anti-war songs. "It's fine to
allow him to come and speak here, but to appoint him a
'Distinguished Visiting Fellow' is an insult to all of us."

Students and faculty members gave speeches dur
ing the hour-long rally with performances by the
seven-piece Raging Grannies and the Stanford The
atre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP) inter
spersed throughout. Several of the speakers stressed
their support for free speech and academic freedom
and said their opposition to the appointment was more
than political.
"No one is opposed to having him speak." said Todd
Davis, associate director and lecturer in the symbolic
systems program. "We want him to be accountable for
his term as secretary of defense."
"it's not his politics," added Hilton Obenzinger. as
sociate director for honors writing,"but his practice of
undermining everything a university should be about."

ITie debate over Rumsfeld's appointment has
called into question the relationship between the con
servative-leaning I loover Institution and the Universi
ty at large. Such disputes roiled Stanford during the
mid-1980s when a student and faculty revolt effective
ly derailed plans to place the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial library on campus.
Rumsfeld, who may never set foot on the Farm, was
appointed to serve on a task force pertaining to nation
al security, ideology and terrorism in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11. 2001 terrorist attacks. He is a long-time
supporter of the 1 loover Institution, having served as a

member of the Hoover Board of
Overseers and as a member of the
executive committee of the hoard.
Many other prominent conserva
tives, including former Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich and Gen
eral John Abizaid have held fellow
ships at the Institution, which, like
all academic departments, can make
temporary visiting appointments
without University oversight.
Many who have spoken out
against Rumsfeld have also called
for the Institution to be further inte
grated with the University. Some
signaled out Hoover because they
said its role on campus was uniquely
political.
"We need to challenge the as
sumption that Hoover can make
these appointments in our name

without recognizing that these ap
pointments are political," said Com
puter Science Prof. Eric Roberts.
A self-proclaimed "product of
the 19605," Roberts extolled the stu
dents in the crowd to get involved
and make their voices heard.
"You have that power," he said.
Nearly 4,000 students, faculty
and alumni have signed an online
petition against the appointment,
and the anti-Rumsfeld movement
has become a growing source of stu
dent activism this year.
"One of my greatest fears is get
ting and becoming apathetic," said
undergraduate Ahlia Kattan. "Let's
try our best not to forget."
But not everyone found the rally
to be the best forum to weigh in on
the Rumsfeld debate.
"1 think there are serious ques
tions to be asked about his perform
ance," said Tristan Abbey '08, "but
that's for more serious discussion."
