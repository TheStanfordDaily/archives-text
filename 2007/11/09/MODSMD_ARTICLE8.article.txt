## Faculty Senate debates Rumsfeld 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian adamantly de
fended the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a Distin
guished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting. Raisian directly addressed the
concerns of a number of faculty regarding Rumsfeld's new
position.
Raisian nonetheless admitted that he "blew it" when he
first announced Rumsfeld's appointment in August of this
year without running the decision by President John Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.'B2 before he an
nounced it.
"This experience was unanticipated, as naive as that
sounds," Raisian said, referring to the widespread opposition
to Rumsfeld on campus. "The takeaway here is not to blind
side my bosses."
Some members of Faculty Senate challenged Raisian re
garding the former Secretary of Defense's title as a Distin
guished Visiting Fellow. History Prof. Albert Camarillo em
phasized that Rumsfeld's presence at Stanford and appoint
ment to the Hoover Institution's new task force on ideology
and terrorism was not the focal point of concern.
"I don't think any of us would have an objection to Rums
feld serving on the task force," Camarillo said."lt's that label
'distinguished' which implies academic achievement."
Raisian spoke directly to this issue, enumerating Rums
feld's experience from service in the Navy to his position as
Secretary of Defense for President Gerald Ford to his time as
Chairman of G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company.
"Like it or not, he has had a distinguished career." Raisian
said.
Raisian said that Hoover seeks to appoint Distinguished
Visiting Fellows who are "distinct, discerning... perhaps even
honorable." Raisian admitted, however, that "that is through
the eyes of the beholder."
The Hoover director went on to enumerate several other
positions at Stanford with the word "distinguished" in the
title, in fields ranging from law to education.
"I'm led to believe that no crite
ria was used in these titles other than
those of that department," Raisian
said.
After the meeting, however,
Raisian called the appointment a
"matter of course."
"It's natural if we invite you to a
Hoover/Stanford activity, to give you
a title," he added.
The relationship between the
Hoover Institution and Stanford has

come into question since the an
nouncement about Rumsfeld was
made more than two months ago.
Though the Hoover Institution is a
think tank that acts autonomously
from the University, it is not com
pletely independent of Stanford.
Raisian himself reports directly to
the president and provost, and sever
al faculty receive joint appointments
in Hoover and academic depart
ments.
Philosophy Prof. Debra Satz
stressed that the perception of
Hoover as a separate entity that sim
ply "rents space" from the Universi
ty is widespread.
"I think there could be far more

integration," Satz said." I d like to see
all the institutions on the same page.
We've had an explosion of institu
tions at Stanford."
After the meeting, both Satz and
Raisian indicated that implementing
a broad policy on appointments in all
Stanford departments was a logical
next step following the current con
troversy.
"They've got to explore changes
of these procedures across the
board, not just for Hoover," Raisian
said.
Satz felt that last night's forum
provided an opportunity for discus
sion, if nothing more.
"I thought it was a good discus

sion. 1 thought he was open," she
added. "He didn't get support, but
the faculty got to air their (sic) con
cerns.
The Senate also passed two
amendments to the Student Judicial
Charter at last night's meeting.These
amendments broadly apply the Stan
ford judicial policy to some incidents
that occur off-campus and also ex
tend the statute of limitations for
sexual assault from six months to
two years. The amendments have al
ready been passed bv the GSC and
the ASSU.
