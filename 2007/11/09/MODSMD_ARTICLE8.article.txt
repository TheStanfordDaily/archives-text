## Faculty Senate debates Rumsfeld 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian adamantly de
fended the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a Distin
guished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting. Raisian directly addressed the
concerns of a number of faculty regarding Rumsfeld's new
position.
Raisian nonetheless admitted that he "blew it" when he
first announced Rumsfeld's appointment in August of this
year without running the decision by President John Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.'B2 before he an
nounced it.
"This experience was unanticipated, as naive as that
sounds," Raisian said, referring to the widespread opposition
to Rumsfeld on campus. "The takeaway here is not to blind
side my bosses."
Some members of Faculty Senate challenged Raisian re
garding the former Secretary of Defense's title as a Distin
guished Visiting Fellow. History Prof. Albert Camarillo em
phasized that Rumsfeld's presence at Stanford and appoint
ment to the Hoover Institution's new task force on ideology
and terrorism was not the focal point of concern.
"I don't think any of us would have an objection to Rums
feld serving on the task force," Camarillo said."lt's that label
'distinguished' which implies academic achievement."
Raisian spoke directly to this issue, enumerating Rums
feld's experience from service in the Navy to his position as
Secretary of Defense for President Gerald Ford to his time as
Chairman of G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company.
"Like it or not, he has had a distinguished career." Raisian
said.
Raisian said that Hoover seeks to appoint Distinguished
Visiting Fellows who are "distinct, discerning... perhaps even
honorable." Raisian admitted, however, that "that is through
the eyes of the beholder."
The Hoover director went on to enumerate several other
positions at Stanford with the word "distinguished" in the
title, in fields ranging from law to education.
