## Dorms battle in capture the flag match 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Over 1(H) freshmen wearing white and red
athletic gear descended on Stanford Stadium
last night for an enormous game of capture
the flag. In the end, it was a close finish be
tween East Campus — sporting red — and
West Campus — sporting white. After build
ing a 4-o lead. West Campus held off a surge
from the East to capture an 8-7 victory.
Instead of the usual flags, kickballs of vary
ing point values were placed all around the
stadium, with West Campus guarding five
balls in the north/west part of the stadium,
and East Campus protecting another set of
five in the south/east part. "Jail zones" were
located under the scoreboards at each end of
the stadium, with the goal being to get the
other team's ball back across the 50-yard line

and score.
"This was truly the brainchild of [Roble
Resident Assistant] Daniel Novinson," said
Roble Resident Fellow Kate Chesley."All the
credit should go to him.
"Roble always has a capture the flag game
every year, usually against Brannershe
added."but we decided that it should be an all
freshmen event this year and it turns out all
the dorms wanted to get involved."
All dorms with freshmen were invited to
participate, so resident upperclassmen joined
the Class of 2011 in the split between East
Campus (Roble, FroSoCo, Loro, West Lag,
Naranja.Gavilan and Mirlo) and West (Tran
cos, Otero, Burbank. Larkin, Serra, Okada,
Soto and Cedro).
The game began with both teams yelling
chants at each other from across the stadium.
Sporting their team colors, many also used

face paint to write dorm names on their faces.
Rules were announced over the loudspeakers
just before the game started at about 8:30 last
night, but even then some freshmen seemed
confused.
Many Resident Assistants (RAs) were on
hand to explain rules and ensure safety.
Dressed in black, individual staff members
covered various stations, including the flag lo
cations and jails.
"There were about 30 RAs that were ac
tively involved in helping organize the fresh
men come-together," said Serra RA Kevin
Montag '08. "The turnout is a little bit lower
than we expected, but I think they are filling
up the stadium well enough."
"I'm just trying to make sure people don't

run on the grass," Montag added, "be
cause the athletics people were wor
ried about the grass being ready for
the upcoming game."
While most of Stanford Stadium
was fair game, players were not al
lowed on the field or the surrounding
grassy areas and hills. With that, fresh
men and their upperclass dormmates
were forced to run around the con
courses and tunnels as well as through
— and on top of — the many bleach
ers.
Most freshmen had a difficult time
scoring points, as both West and East
Campus had formidable defense
teams.Tape outlined the safe zone sur
rounding each kickball, but the areas
were heavily fortified with members
of the respective team.
"I had to be secretive," said Roble
resident Max Sosna-Spear '11, as he
stood in the safe zone holding the
other team's ball for about 25 minutes.
"I was actually in the bathroom and I
slipped out. Someone followed me up
to the door of the bathroom, but they
didn't follow me inside. So five min
utes later I slipped out and ran into the
safe zone, and no one could catch me."
Immediately after getting to the
safe zone, Sosna-Spear called his
teammates on his cell phone to let
them know he needed help getting the
ball to the other side. They were
tagged one by one as they tried to get
to him.
Because of the many students who
were caught — East Campus went the
first 40 minutes without a single jail

break from its team — officials
changed the rules mid-game, requiring
a two-hand touch to get teammates
out.
Toward the end of the night, jails
were eliminated; after players were
tagged, they simply had to return to
their side rather than sit out for a few
minutes. And to make things more in
teresting in the final minutes, all point
values were doubled.
With three returns by the East,
West Campus' three-point lead was
diminished to just one in the last five
minutes.
"1 was able to score because my
friend and I ran with the ball, passing it
to each other," said Roble resident
Khai Tram '11. who managed to score
three points.
Administrators were pleased by the
contest's outcome.
"I think it would be great if this
were to become an annual tradition in
the stadium," said Koren Bakkegard,
director of new student programs.
"This tradition could not have started
with a nicer class; the Class of' 11 is a
great one to kick this off."
After putting a large effort into the
high-stakes game, coordinator Daniel
Novinson was satisfied with the night
— and the fact that Roble contributed
to the West Campus win.
"This is awesome, and this event
could not have gone any better," he
said. "I am just incredibly happy that
we were able to do this event tonight.
In the future, I would love [it] if the
freshman class leaders could contin
ue this tradition. I would especially
like to see a senior versus freshmen
game."

resident Max Sosna-Spear '11, as he
stood in the safe zone holding the
other team's ball for about 25 minutes.
"I was actually in the bathroom and I
slipped out. Someone followed me up
to the door of the bathroom, but they
didn't follow me inside. So five min
utes later I slipped out and ran into the
safe zone, and no one could catch me."
Immediately after getting to the
safe zone, Sosna-Spear called his
teammates on his cell phone to let
them know he needed help getting the
ball to the other side. They were
tagged one by one as they tried to get
to him.
Because of the many students who
were caught — East Campus went the
first 40 minutes without a single jail

break from its team — officials
changed the rules mid-game, requiring
a two-hand touch to get teammates
out.
Toward the end of the night, jails
were eliminated; after players were
tagged, they simply had to return to
their side rather than sit out for a few
minutes. And to make things more in
teresting in the final minutes, all point
values were doubled.
With three returns by the East,
West Campus' three-point lead was
diminished to just one in the last five
minutes.
"1 was able to score because my
friend and I ran with the ball, passing it
to each other," said Roble resident
Khai Tram '11. who managed to score
three points.
Administrators were pleased by the
contest's outcome.
"I think it would be great if this
were to become an annual tradition in
the stadium," said Koren Bakkegard,
director of new student programs.
"This tradition could not have started
with a nicer class; the Class of' 11 is a
great one to kick this off."
After putting a large effort into the
high-stakes game, coordinator Daniel
Novinson was satisfied with the night
— and the fact that Roble contributed
to the West Campus win.
"This is awesome, and this event
could not have gone any better," he
said. "I am just incredibly happy that
we were able to do this event tonight.
In the future, I would love [it] if the
freshman class leaders could contin
ue this tradition. I would especially
like to see a senior versus freshmen
game."
