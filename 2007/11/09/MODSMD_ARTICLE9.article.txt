## Dorms battle in capture the flag match 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Over 1(H) freshmen wearing white and red
athletic gear descended on Stanford Stadium
last night for an enormous game of capture
the flag. In the end, it was a close finish be
tween East Campus — sporting red — and
West Campus — sporting white. After build
ing a 4-o lead. West Campus held off a surge
from the East to capture an 8-7 victory.
Instead of the usual flags, kickballs of vary
ing point values were placed all around the
stadium, with West Campus guarding five
balls in the north/west part of the stadium,
and East Campus protecting another set of
five in the south/east part. "Jail zones" were
located under the scoreboards at each end of
the stadium, with the goal being to get the
other team's ball back across the 50-yard line

and score.
"This was truly the brainchild of [Roble
Resident Assistant] Daniel Novinson," said
Roble Resident Fellow Kate Chesley."All the
credit should go to him.
"Roble always has a capture the flag game
every year, usually against Brannershe

freshmen event this year and it turns out all
the dorms wanted to get involved."
All dorms with freshmen were invited to
participate, so resident upperclassmen joined

Campus (Roble, FroSoCo, Loro, West Lag,
Naranja.Gavilan and Mirlo) and West (Tran
cos, Otero, Burbank. Larkin, Serra, Okada,
Soto and Cedro).
The game began with both teams yelling
chants at each other from across the stadium.
Sporting their team colors, many also used

face paint to write dorm names on their faces.
Rules were announced over the loudspeakers
just before the game started at about 8:30 last
night, but even then some freshmen seemed
confused.
Many Resident Assistants (RAs) were on
hand to explain rules and ensure safety.
Dressed in black, individual staff members
covered various stations, including the flag lo
cations and jails.
"There were about 30 RAs that were ac
tively involved in helping organize the fresh
men come-together," said Serra RA Kevin
Montag '08. "The turnout is a little bit lower
than we expected, but I think they are filling
up the stadium well enough."
"I'm just trying to make sure people don't
