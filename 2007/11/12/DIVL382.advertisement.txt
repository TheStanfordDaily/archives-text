WELCOME BACK TO THE PEDESTRIAN ZONE!
Bg Bill Larson, Pedestrian Zone Supervisor
I am happy to report that you have returned to an even safer Pedestrian Zone with the addition of the two traffic cir
cles and sidewalks on Lasuen Mall and White Plaza. We ask that bicycles, vehicles, and carts follow the correct
route around these circles, and pedestrians use the sidewalks, to avoid accidents and ensure the safety of all who
share this pedestrian mall.
We would also like to remind bicyclists to NOT ride or park their bicycles in the arcades such as those located at
the Main Quad, Old Union, and Green Library. The Department of Public Safety may soon begin impounding or
locking in place bicycles that are parked in violation of this restriction. When this phase of enforcement begins, the
bicycle owner will be required to pay a fee to recover a bicycle that has been impounded or locked by the Depart
ment of Public Safety. In addition to the fee, the bicycle will need to be licensed before it can be released in accor
dance with Santa Clara County Ordinance Section 85-19. Also, the operation of a skateboard, in-line skate, roller
skate, or similar device in an arcade is prohibited under Santa Clara County Ordinance, Sections 85-30 and 85-33.
In closing, the Department of Public Safety, Parking & Transportation Services, and the University Administration
THANK YOU for your continued cooperation and contribution to the success of the Pedestrian Zone policy now
in its second year.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the policy, please feel free to email Bill Larson at: william.lar

Have a GREAT and SAFE gear!
