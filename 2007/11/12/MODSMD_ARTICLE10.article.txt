# Brief from beyond The Bubble
## Oil spill investigation, cleanup continue

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Criticism
mounted Friday of the U.S. Coast Guard's
response after a container ship struck the
Bay Bridge, leaking 58,000 gallons of oil
into San Francisco Bay and fouling miles of
California coastline.
The attorney for the pilot who was guid
ing the ship away from the Port of Oakland
when it hit the bridge said the pilot notified
authorities immediately, and soon after
alerted them that there was a sheen of oil on
the water.
According to the statement from Capt.
John Cota's lawyer, it took cleanup crews at
least 90 minutes to respond. Coast Guard
logs of the day's events shows a response
team on the scene in about a half hour, but
also show it took much longer for oil-skim
ming vessels to arrive.
