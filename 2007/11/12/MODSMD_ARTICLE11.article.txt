### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Six Stanford stu
dents joined over 5,000 other college environmen
tal activists in Washington. D.C. last week, calling
on federal lawmakers to combat climate change
through a series of clean energy initiatives.
Members of Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford participated in the Energy Action Coalition's
Power Shift Conference, which provided seminars
in leadership training and idea-sharing among
campus organizers, culminating in a 1.000-person
rally on Capitol Hill attended by House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Carolyn Mansfield '08, a member of Students
for Sustainable Stanford and the national Sierra
Student Coalition, said students were eager to
show legislators and the 2008 presidential candi
dates how important environmental issues are to
the youth voting demographic.
"We wanted to send the message that we're
paying attention and we want to see change hap
pen." Mansfield said.
Students met face-to-face with members of
Congress to lobby for the " 1 Sky" campaign, which
calls for a 30 percent reduction in U.S. carbon
emissions by 2020 and a moratorium on new coal
plants. The participants also pushed for the cre
ation of five million new "green jobs" to replace
workers in industries that are less environmental
ly friendly.

Two Stanford participants addressed the eon
ferenee abou'. the importance of representing Na
tive American rights on environmental issues.
"What set us apart was people were organized
and really well-informed on the issues." Mansfield
said. "It brought [the conference] above the level
ot just presence to show we're here and know what
we want."
One of the key components of the conference,
according to Mansfield, was the information-shar
ing taking place about ways to improve environ
mental awareness on different campuses. Mans
field said sustainability initiatives at Stanford and
University of California campuses serve as models
for other schools,especially those in heavily indus
trial regions that are looking to implement similar
programs.
"We're realizing that college campuses are a
great place to start with this movement," Mans
field said.
In recent years, Stanford environmentalists
have worked with administrators to coordinate
competitions encouraging dorms to cut back on
water and energy use and install compost disposal
facilities in residences and eateries to reduce land
fill waste. Stanford's nationally recognized Green
Dorm Project and Lotus Living Laboratory are re
searching energy-efficient building designs and
technology to create the campus' first fully envi
ronmentally-conscious residential complex.
Mansfield said Stanford's environmental initia
tives have been receiving unprecedented levels of
student support. But she also acknowledged that
there is still room for improvement.

dents to eat organic foods and use biodegradable
take-out utensils, Mansfield said many eateries, in-

principles in this new campus hub." Mansfield

host a lecture series as part of a national education
initiative to explore solutions to climate change.
