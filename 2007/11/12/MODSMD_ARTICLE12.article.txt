### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
approved $20,000 in funding last
week for the ASSU Arts Grant Pro
gram. After the program was discon
tinued last year, the Executive Cabi
net and Senate collaborated to fund
its revival.
Through the program, which is an
outlet for students who are interested
in starting their own artistic endeav
ors to receive financial support, stu
dents and student groups can submit
proposals and budget outlines to the
Arts Grant Board, which then re
views the applications and decides
whether to fund the project.
Created several years ago as a co
operative venture between ASSU

Executives and senators to support
the arts community on campus, the
Arts Grant Program previously re
ceived funding from Senate reserves.
I lowever. during the 2006-07 aca
demic year, the program was discon
tinued because that source of funds
dried up.
"From what 1 have been told, the
Executive spent the entire year hist
year supposedly trying to find alter
native sources of funding," said
ASSU Vice President Mondaire
Jones "09, "but what they failed to do
was go to the original source of fund
ing. the Undergraduate Senate."
Jones said that he and ASSU Pres
ident 1 lershey Avula '08 turned to the
Senate in search of funding for the
program's reinstatement, which was
accomplished at last Tuesday's Scn

ate meeting.
"We certainly appreciate the sup
port from the Senate for making this
happen." Jones said.
Currently, Jones is working on cre
ating the Arts Grant Board and revis
ing the program's guidelines from
previous years. I le said the board will
consist of ASSU officials and inter
ested members of the ;>rts communi
ty. After establishing the foundation
for the program, Jones said he in
tends to begin advertising to raise
awareness of the opportunity for arts
funding.
According to Jones, the program
represents n step toward increased
recognition of the arts community on
campus.
"The arts community for several
years has felt that the ASSU has not

been doing enough to support their
interests," Jones said. "This is one of
the many ways we hope to do this."
The ASSU Executive has also al
ready begun to actively plan the
"Stanford Idol" event, to be held dur
ing winter quarter. ITiere will be com
petitions in a number of different
artistic categories beyond vocals.
Both Executives and senators said
they were excited about the future of
the Arts Grant Program.
"I am a strong supporter of the
program " said Senator Sarah Go
labek-Goldman '10."The entire Stan
ford community will benefit because
it will be exposed to inspiring and
thought-provoking works of art."
