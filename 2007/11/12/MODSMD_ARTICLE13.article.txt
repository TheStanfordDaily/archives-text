Over matters big or small, from the ad
ministration of our country down to
the governance of our immediate habi
tats, the archetypal Stanford student is associ
ated with neither the image of agitated con
cern nor the clamor of political activism. While
many of us passionately engage in individual
interests and pursuits, we are better known for
our general apathy of our surrounding condi
tion. especially when compared with our
cross-Bay counterparts.
A self-selected few choose to live in co-ops
and Dead houses in order to participate more
actively in community life, but the vast major
ity of us reside in dorms where community life
is independently structured by a dorm staff.
There are many situations where staff pre
rogative is useful or even necessary — stu
dents are often too busy to worry about every
little detail of their home. As a resident.it is re
assuring to know that the living environment
is safe and that food will be put on the table.
The level to which a staff dictates the de
tails of dorm life can vary remarkably from
residence to residence. Some staffs encourage
residents to actively participate in the commu
nity. Other halls have no such institution, and
rely on crude surveys or hearsay to relay pref
erences and opinions back the leadership.
After all. staff members are busy students
themselves, and it is sometimes more efficient
to make certain decisions on behalf of resi
dents without tortuously achieving consensus.
So when the staff makes decisions, residents
usually accept. Dissatisfaction is borne but dis
pute is averted.
Yet considering that the dorms are the
homes of the residents — not to mention the
expensive rooming bills — residents have
every right to be involved or question some
decisions that are made on their behalf. When
there are qualms about what activities arc
funded or even the house theme,students only
disservice themselves when they stifle their
opinion in favor of the status quo. It is this very
self-censorship, or an otherwise lack of opin

ion. that allows the scope of dorm staff s influ
ence to burgeon.
An excellent example of resident interven
tion was when Kimball's dissatisfied students
attempted to change the theme of the dorm,
something residents generally acknowledge
as either concrete or unimportant. The ensu
ing discussion involved dorm government,
residents-at-large and activists. An online-sur
vey was even initiated to gauge student prefer
ences. Although the ultimate result was to
keep the original theme, the appearance of
passion and deliberation over something
seemingly trivial is commendable.
Increased participation, if not handled
properly, can lead to heightened division. In
the pursuit of better representation, residents
may inadvertently create hostile factions that
would ultimately lead to community break
down. It is important that activism has two
goals: dorm staff taking into account the pref
erences of students and all residents learning
to compromise and empathize. Verbalized dis
sent can be positive and constructive.
As busy as we all may be. college is the last
time many of us will live in such a community
setting again. Learning how to live with a
stranger freshman year is as important as
learning the intricacies of molecular physics or
I lemingway's novels. Likewise, as we change
dorms from year to year it is important that we
learn how to live with each new set of people.
Within each set of people, every individual is
equal and as such, everyone's opinions count.
These opinions, however, may be stomped
out unless each individual cares about being
represented. In the end. it is the responsibility
of each resident to participate and be heard.
Voicing one's dissatisfaction or suggestions
with respect to dorm life may appear irrele
vant to the greater ideals of civic duty, but it is
this active spirit that makes democracy work
at any level. Perhaps this resurgence of com
munity participation is a positive sign that we
Stanford students are ridding ourselves of our
nonchalant image.
