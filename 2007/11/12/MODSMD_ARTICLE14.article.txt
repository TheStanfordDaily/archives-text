## Reject silent rejection 
### 
Orpheus isn't heartbroken. As a recov
ering victim of rejection, Hollywood
might like to romantically portray him
bent over his phone, pining away Kleenex in
hand, unshowered with a crazed look in his
eyes. But let's be real: Orpheus is a real-life,
socially-adjusted Stanford student. So, when
the object of his affection quietly removed
herself from his life, the void was replaced
with swirling questions.
Let's start from the beginning. Our unfor
tunate protagonist's story begins with meet
ing a girl. How is rather unimportant, but our
more visual readers could conjure up cliched
images of the crowd parting at FBI Happy
1 lour and Orpheus seeing the girl through the
hot-boxed haze. Or maybe she'd been coyly
glancing over her shoulder during French
Pornography lectures. Regardless, they met.
exchanged numbers, sent a few flirtatious
Facebook messages (not pokes — remem
ber. Orpheus is socially adept),and even went
on a date or two.They clearly established that
they enjoyed each other's company, but the
nature of the relationship was still in ques
tion.
ITien the tides began to change, but for the
better. Nameless Girl called Orpheus to go on
a date. They went to a party afterwards, got a
little tipsy, and ended up making out on the
dance floor. Orpheus awoke the next day to a
sun shining with expectant opportunity. And
then, the sound of birds chirping was
drowned out by Dies Irae and our newly re
vealed antagonist stops returning Orpheus's
phone calls.
Proper etiquette when ending a relation
ship. be it an almost-budded romance or a
full-fledged breakup, is just as important as
proper etiquette when starting a relationship.
However, this point is often overlooked and
the rules are less defined.
The sample space of breakups is rather
large, so for the sake of depth rather than
breadth. I'd like to address Orpheus's partic
ular predicament: silent rejection. For readers
unfamiliar with the exact definition of silent
rejection: One, I envy you.Two.it occurs when
one member of a (potentially) romantic pair
ing decides to opt out. Yet. instead of directly
telling the person or slowly making their dis
satisfaction known, silent rejection is charac
terized by an abrupt avoidance of all contact.
This tactic seems to reside in many people's
arsenal (as I and many others have been on
the receiving end). but the purpose of this col
umn is to eliminate it.and possibly replace it
with a more effective means of expressing ro
mantic disinterest.
Orpheus initially didn't know what to
make of it. The girl's silence, preceded by a
"too-busy" claim, first left Orpheus wonder

ing if she really was busy. After all, Stanford
can be a hectic environment for any couple.
1 lowever. after a week or so of silence, it be
came vaguely apparent that forward progress
had ended. But Orpheus still clung to his ves
tigial hope for at least a little while longer, be
cause maybe she was just really busy. Through
her silence. The Vanishing Girl's strategy
failed to achieve a clean break.
I ler method also failed on the friendship
front. From our earlier vignette, we know that
Orpheus and his girl enjoyed each other's
company. Why not continue to enjoy each
other's company, even if it doesn't involve
physical intimacy? Avoiding all forms of in
teraction certainly doesn't equate to any type
of friendship. So. while silently fading away
definitely is the easiest out for the exiting
partner, this strategy lacks consideration for
the other person involved.Two people can be
mutually interested in each other,cease to be
mutually interested,and move on to a mature
and platonic relationship.
Just as entering a relationship necessitates
a certain amount of respect, exiting one re
quires it as well. This means putting in the
time to either talk to a person when it seems
as if the end is near, or at least letting them
down less abruptly. I know recommending a
different course of action is easy, but the hard
part isn't so much in making an effort to act
differently.The real difficulty lies in how the
rejecting party overcomes the perceived awk
wardness of the rejection. I'd like to believe
that this girl still wants to be friends with Or
pheus. but because she thinks that he'd be of
fended by the rejection, she'd rather avoid a
potentially awkward situation. Truth is, even
though at one point he wantedmore. he real
ly started getting to know her because he just
wanted to be her friend. Sadly, she'll never
know that because she continues to avoid
him.
Orpheus doesn't really question anymore.
Instead, his only regret isn't that he's missing
out on a girlfriend — it's that he's missing out
on the opportunity to build a friendship sim
ply because he momentarily pursued a girl he
found to be attractive and interesting.
