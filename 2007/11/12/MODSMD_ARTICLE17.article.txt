# Little Ms, Modern
## Shut up and make me a (digital) sandwich! 
### 
If 1 believed in lucky stars. I would thank
mine every single day that 1 was born a
woman in the modern era. No longer re
stricted to meekness and obedience, today's
female can be outspoken, ambitious and self
sufficient. Beyonce and friends illustrate this
point well: thanks to their financial success
and emotional strength, they explain, they
don't depend on men.
TTiis is a nice thought, and 1 can't say that 1
don't feel empowered when 1 throw my
hands up at them. But despite these declara
tions of independence, it would be naive to
suggest that women have completely escaped
society's historical expectations. After all,
how independent can Beyonce really be,
when her lyrics of liberation are accompanied
(and undermined) by a style of dress and
dance undeniably meant to appeal to men?
Plenty of non-pop star women experience
this dilemma as well. I don't have Beyonce's
moves or money, but I too continuously strug
gle to balance my need to be respected and
my desire to express my femininity (in a soci
ety in which femininity does not generally
garner respect). I've yet to find a good solu
tion.
This conflict in modern gender roles is a
salient example of the tensions and contra
dictions that characterize modernity. Tradi
tionally. men and women had well-defined
roles, and there was little misunderstanding
as to how everyone was to behave. But justice
and happiness were also in short supply, so
modern equality movements sought to break
down the existing constructs. Now. society is
undoubtedly more fair, but due to the up
heaval of familiar expectations, it is also more
confusing.
I think much of the confusion is rooted in
our physical existences: ITiere are obvious
anatomical differences between men and
women, and some have a hard time reconcil
ing the consequences of these differences
with equality. In other words, I'm saying that
women tend to have breasts, men tend to like

breasts, and this can get everyone so excited
that we forget about our supposed commit
ment to being an enlightened society.
If true equality is indeed impeded by our
physical differences, however, the emer
gence of the online world, a new public realm
completely divorced from physical reality,
would seem promising. How refreshing! Fi
nally. an open forum in which no one has to
have or look at breasts (although 1 hear a vig
orous search can uncover all sorts of anato
my online). Freed from these distractions,
men and women might finally cast off the re
maining chains of expected gender-related
behavior.
Or that's what Fd always assumed. Hut a
few days ago, I read something startling —
that women and men indeed act in distinct
ways on the internet. In a published debate,
SUNY Buffalo researcher and internet cul
ture expert Trebor Scholz observes that
while young women outnumber young men
online, "in many participatory environments
women prefer to read and participate silent
ly." He didn't cite any data to support this
claim, but after looking at my own, I can't
deny that it seems reasonable.
My numbers come from this column itself,
whose online version occasionally elicits
feedback from (my mostly delightful) read
ers. Five articles have resulted in 43 com
ments on The Daily Web site, five email con
versations, a Facebook message or two, a text
message an IM conversation, and lots of chit
chatting with Mom. Excluding the obligatory
familial relations, let's call this fifty-two ac
tive responses.

Among The Daily commentators who
signed their names, four were female (be
sides me) and 15 were male (J-Dog. I'm as
suming you're a guy). Three of these four
women are my close friends; 1 don't know
most of the men. And all of the non-Daily
Web site responses came from guys, some
known and some not. 1 admit this is a woeful
ly inadequate sample size, but the results are
still striking: four active responses from
women versus 25 from men, and for non-ac
quaintances only, one versus 17.
Yikes! Maybe it's just that a significant
majority of my readers are guys, but that's
hard to believe, considering that Stanford is
about half female and that my column has a
girly-girlish title (Don't you love the irony?).
No, it looks like women really are. in general,
more passive than men online. We are indeed
shutting up and making sandwiches.
Duh, says my sociologist-roommate
Lizzy: "We continue to perform our gender,
even when it's not readily visible." Apparent
ly there is a ton of gender theory explaining
this kind of phenomenon. But while it is in
teresting to think about why this behavior
happens (and I absolutely invite you to do
so). I am even more interested in stopping it!
Our ideas are damn valuable, ladies. By
keeping our insight to ourselves, we are es
sentially cutting the world's intellectual tal
ent pool in halt. While the modern world has
many problems, it has also freed us women to
have a voice in solving them. And it be
hooves us to speak up! So please, if you aren 't
already doing so, start editing Wikipedia arti
cles, writing emails to the editor of The New
York Times, and Hogging your hearts out. Or
prove my faulty research wrong by leaving a
stinging critique below this article. Just stop
making sandwiches, don't shut up.and I'll see
you bitches on the Internet.

Yikes! Maybe it's just that a significant
majority of my readers are guys, but that's
hard to believe, considering that Stanford is
about half female and that my column has a
girly-girlish title (Don't you love the irony?).
No, it looks like women really are. in general,
more passive than men online. We are indeed
shutting up and making sandwiches.
Duh, says my sociologist-roommate
Lizzy: "We continue to perform our gender,
even when it's not readily visible." Apparent
ly there is a ton of gender theory explaining
this kind of phenomenon. But while it is in
teresting to think about why this behavior
happens (and I absolutely invite you to do
so). I am even more interested in stopping it!
Our ideas are damn valuable, ladies. By
keeping our insight to ourselves, we are es
sentially cutting the world's intellectual tal
ent pool in halt. While the modern world has
many problems, it has also freed us women to
have a voice in solving them. And it be
hooves us to speak up! So please, if you aren 't
already doing so, start editing Wikipedia arti
cles, writing emails to the editor of The New
York Times, and Hogging your hearts out. Or
prove my faulty research wrong by leaving a
stinging critique below this article. Just stop
making sandwiches, don't shut up.and I'll see
you bitches on the Internet.
