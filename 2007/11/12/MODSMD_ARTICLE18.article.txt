## Venture capitalist sees profit in water Resource will be scarcer in future, Lagod says 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
If water is a necessity for life and
diamonds are not, then why are dia
monds so much more expensive than
water? Economists explain this para
dox by saying that water is more
available and easier to acquire, but
the availability of water is about to
change. Bay Area venture capitalist
Martin Lagod told about 30 students
at a Friday afternoon lecture.
The talk was the latest in a series
hosted by the environmental engi
neering and science program (EES),
a subprogram of the civil and envi
ronmental engineering (CEE) de
partment.
As water becomes a scarcer re
source. it may command a high price
and become a source of investment,
said Lagod, a managing director at
Firelake Capital Management.
"There is a big market for water,"
he said, "but right now there is still a

scarcity of experienced entrepreneur
teams and big, innovative ideas to tap
into that market."
Lagod emphasized that while the
water market has potential for the
future, this would involve a large
scale infrastructure construction.
"Water is an inherently local re
source," Lagod said. "As of now, ex
isting channels of water transport are
not viable for large-scale entrepre
neurship in the water market."
Lagod also emphasized that this
entrepreneurship must begin in de
veloped countries such as the U.S.
"in many developing countries
the baseline is so low that the econo
my is still focusing on satisfying basic
human needs," he explained. "There,
the only way to initiate infrastructure
would be individual projects, which
would mean very high costs."
Because the seminar approached
civil engineering from an entrepre
neurial perspective, a handful of
Graduate School of Business stu
dents joined CLE students at the
event.
"I'm glad Martin came to speak
about water." said Kelsev Lynn
M.B.A. '08. "It's an overlooked area
of clean-tech."
CEE students who attended the
seminar said they appreciated hear
ing about the real-world applicabili
ty of what they learn in environmen
tal enuineerinu classes.

"It's interesting to listen to a dis
cussion on water from a venture cap
ital standpoint rather than from a
technical standpoint," said CHE
graduate student Holly Johnson. "In
the engineering and science pro
grams the classes are very rigorous
and technical, so it's nice to get some
financial exposure and real-life ap
plication."
