# New home proposed for dirt
## Stanford plans to dump 300,000 cubic yards on former tree farm 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford continues its expansive campus-wide
construction project, the University plans to dig up
enough dirt to bury the Cardinal football field 140 feet
deep.
If the University has its way, the 8 million cubic feet
of excavated dirt is destined for a former Christmas tree
farm off Sand Hill Road.

The dumping site was previously leased from Stan
ford for growing Christmas trees, but the operation
closed several years ago and the former farm is now
pocked with tree stumps and furrows. After depositing
the construction dirt, Stanford would smooth out the
area and replant it. said Special Projects Program Man
ager Mark Bonino.
Bonino explained that Stanford is becoming "more
dense," with more basements and subsurface construc
tion, and the University needs a new site to dump the
excess excavated dirt.
Soil from ongoing campus construction, such as the
Munger housing complex, is typically handled in a spot
market where dirt from one construction project goes
to another project that needs fill soil, Bonino said.
When buyers cannot be found, the dirt may end up in

landfills.
Bonino explained that dumping the dirt on the for
mer tree farm is a much more viable option.
"The spot market can be expensive and volatile, and
we would prefer to keep Stanford soil within Stanford
for sustainability reasons." he said.
Camille Leung, project planner for San Mateo
County, said the county must review the proposed pro
ject's environmental impact before Stanford gets the
go-ahead. Initially, the county decided a full environ
mental impact report was not needed and drafted a doc
ument called a "negative declaration." detailing 29 ways
Stanford could ease the environmental impact of the
project. The draft negative declaration spent 30 days

Construction of a new parking garage is just one part of a plan to make the campus "more dense," according to Special Projects Program Manager Mark Bonino. If Stanford's
permit request is approved, displaced dirt from subsurface construction will find a new home at a former Christmas tree farm on Sand Hill Road.
