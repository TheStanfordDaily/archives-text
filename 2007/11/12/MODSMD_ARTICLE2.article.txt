# New home proposed for dirt
## Stanford plans to dump 300,000 cubic yards on former tree farm 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford continues its expansive campus-wide
construction project, the University plans to dig up
enough dirt to bury the Cardinal football field 140 feet
deep.
If the University has its way, the 8 million cubic feet
of excavated dirt is destined for a former Christmas tree
farm off Sand Hill Road.

The dumping site was previously leased from Stan
ford for growing Christmas trees, but the operation
closed several years ago and the former farm is now
pocked with tree stumps and furrows. After depositing
the construction dirt, Stanford would smooth out the
area and replant it. said Special Projects Program Man
ager Mark Bonino.
Bonino explained that Stanford is becoming "more
dense," with more basements and subsurface construc
tion, and the University needs a new site to dump the
excess excavated dirt.
Soil from ongoing campus construction, such as the
Munger housing complex, is typically handled in a spot
market where dirt from one construction project goes
to another project that needs fill soil, Bonino said.
When buyers cannot be found, the dirt may end up in

landfills.
Bonino explained that dumping the dirt on the for
mer tree farm is a much more viable option.
"The spot market can be expensive and volatile, and
we would prefer to keep Stanford soil within Stanford
for sustainability reasons." he said.
Camille Leung, project planner for San Mateo
County, said the county must review the proposed pro
ject's environmental impact before Stanford gets the
go-ahead. Initially, the county decided a full environ
mental impact report was not needed and drafted a doc
ument called a "negative declaration." detailing 29 ways
Stanford could ease the environmental impact of the
project. The draft negative declaration spent 30 days

Construction of a new parking garage is just one part of a plan to make the campus "more dense," according to Special Projects Program Manager Mark Bonino. If Stanford's
permit request is approved, displaced dirt from subsurface construction will find a new home at a former Christmas tree farm on Sand Hill Road.
under public review, a period during
which community members had the
opportunity to express concerns re
garding the project.
"The comments indicated that ad
ditional analysis is necessary," Leung
said, explaining that the next step is
either a revised negative declaration
or a full environmental impact re
port. The final step in the process is a
permit hearing, which will occur
sometime after the end of this year.
Not all of Stanford's neighbors
are happy about the proposed soil
dump. Portola Valley town planner
George Mader detailed his con
cerns in a letter to the San Mateo
County planning commission. Mov
ing 300,000 cubic yards of dirt will
take 15,000 to 30,000 round trips by
large trucks or trailers. Mader

wrote, and the increased traffic
could endanger cyclists on Sand
I (ill Road's popular hiking loop.
Philippe Cohen, administrative
director of Stanford's Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, also expressed
his ecological concerns about the
project. Cohen said the proposed
dirt dump could create an opportu
nity for non-native species to enter
the preserve, which is just downhill
of the dump site.
Cohen said his concerns were
taken into consideration in the for
mer tree farm's re-vegetation pro
posal, dialled by Campus Biologist
Alan I.aimer.Since the dirt dumped
on the former farm should be "bio
logically clean." it could be re-seed
ed with native plants. Cohen ex
plained.
"If it's done right." he said,"they
might end up with better native
habitat than thev started with."
