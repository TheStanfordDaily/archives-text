GAME NOTES: Stanford got off to the right
start last weekend, winning its three games
by an average of 37.5 points. The Cardinal
offense, despite missing sophomore Brook
Lopez, put up an impressive 111 vs. Harvard
and 97 against Northwestern State. Stanford
will play at Siena on Saturday.

points in a row and the No. 23 Cardinal (3-0) took the lead for
good.
"Back to normal," said Goods, who had battled an upset
stomach earlier in the weekend.
Once again, Stanford exploited its size and strength advan
tages inside, dominating the Gauchos 45-28 on the boards.
Sophomore center Robin Lopez scored 12 points on 4-of-4
shooting from the field, also adding three rebounds, two blocks
and two steals.
Alex Harris finished with IS points to lead UCSB (2-I),but
was limited to six points on 3-of-10 shooting from the field in
the second half as the Cardinal cranked up the defensive inten
sity.
"When we get into it, we're a pretty good defensive team,"
said senior Fred Washington, who matched up against Harris
most of the game. "And we don't even have Brook |Lopez, ac
ademically ineligible for fall quarter] back yet."

The Gauchos hung tough with Stanford in the first half,
trailing by 11 at intermission and starting the second stanza
with a 6-0 spurt to close the gap to 35-30. But junior guard
Mitch Johnson (seven points, six rebounds, five assists) hit a
three-pointer and passed to a soaring Robin Lopez for a one
handed alley-oop on the next possession.The Cardinal went on
an 11-0 run, opened a 16-point lead and never looked back.
Free throws were the only Achilles heel for Stanford, which
made 24 of 39 attempts.
"1 don't know what to say," said Washington,who shot 5-for

8 from (he stripe."! knock them down in practice. I'm just suck
ing in games."
Asked to elaborate,coach Johnson agreed: "It just sucks."
Overall, however. Johnson said he was happy with the way
the team played over the weekend, showing a killer instinct
against feisty yet ultimately overmatched opposition, and
avoiding the embarrassing early-season losses that befell na
tional powers Kentucky and Southern California.

Stanford 111,Harvard56
When the Stanford coaching staff
saw T-shirts hailing "The Jeremy I.in
show" — in honor of the current
I larvard guard and former Palo Alto
High School star — among the
Maples Pavilion crowd, they offered
a new instruction for the team: don't

let the guy score.
The Cardinal did that, and a lot
more, Friday night, routing Harvard
11 l-s(i in its first of three contests in
this weekend's Travelers Basketball
Classic. Stanford's point total was its
highest since 1990. and the 55-point
margin of victory was the third-high
est in school history.

making his regular season debut for
Stanford, bounced back from a
shaky outing in Monday's exhibition
against Concordia and led the Cardi
nal with 18 points, including 13 in the
first half. Stanford opened the game
with strong defensive pressure and
took a commanding 63-28 lead at the
intermission — the most points the
team had scored in a half since 1999.
"The defensive intensity was real
ly good at the beginning." said senior
forward Taj Finger, who added \5
points and seven rebounds along
with his trademark defense and ener
gy off the bench. "The first five min
utes are the most important against a
team who you should beat and every
one thinks you're going to beat. You
don't want to give them any hope."
Hope was fleeting for Harvard,
which shot 36 percent from the field

and 48 percent from the free-throw
stripe. Evan Harris led the Crimson
with 14 points.

number of fans in attendance bear

struggled on both ends with Stanford
looking to make a statement to start
its season.
Junior guard Anthony Goods, de
spite having to leave the game to
vomit throughout both halves,
torched Lin and the Crimson on the
offensive end. scoring 17 points and
making five out of six three point at
tempts. After the game. Goods
blamed "some spicy Cajun chicken"
from the pre-game meal for his
stomach woes.
"He was still hitting fadeaways,
though." Finger said.
Ibc Cardinal exploited its physi
cal advantages inside, outrebound
ing Harvard 50-19 and shooting 60
percent from the field.
"Obviously we are a lot bigger
and stronger than Harvard is at this
time." Stanford's coach Johnson
said. "But thev got some good shots

and kept competing."
Stanford 97, Northwestern State 58
Stanford kept the momentum
firmly in its corner Saturday night
against Northwestern State, running
away in a 97-58 blowout in a game
that was a virtual mirror image of the
Cardinal's opening night rout of
Harvard. Junior forward Lawrence
11 ill (7-of-l 1) and Shiller (4-of-6, 3-
of-4 from long range) led all scorers
with 15 apiece, Washington (5-of-7)
and Mitch Johnson (4-of-6) chipped
in 14 each and junior guard Kenny
Brown added 10 as the Cardinal
jumped out to a 33-11 lead eight min
utes in and never looked back.
"These guys are playing to a level
which I think is good for us," coach
Johnson said. "In the past, this has
been a team that has played to the
level of opponents."
The 1.8-to-1.0 assist-to-turnover
ratio would be great news on any
night, but the best news on Saturday
was lights-out shooting from the
starters.The wings exploited their su
perior athleticism to drive into the
paint, draw Northwestern State dou
ble and triple teams and then kick to
wide-open teammates for open
threes and lay-ins. Hie starting five
finished a combined 21-of-34, with
Mitch Johnson's 14 points on six field
goal attempts (and four free throws)
most impressive of all.
"It was just stepping up and hit
ting open shots." he said. "We did a
good job of spreading the floor and
making them help and recover. We
were able to get into the gaps and see
open guys."
Stanford did cool off after its
white-hot start,but finished shooting
54 percent (34-of-63) from the field
and 40 percent (10-of-25) from
three-point land.
On a lighter note. Northwestern
State's C.J. Clark (#11) and Logan
McConathy (#5) both played in in
correct jerseys (#42 and #10. respec
tively), confusing the official scorers
at Maples to no end. It was just that
type of night though for the Demons,
who blew a bevy of open looks to fin
ish with just 38 percent overall accu
racy (23-of-bO) and an abysmal 24
percent (5-of-21) from beyond the
arc. Forward Trey Gilder, one of the
NCAA's most prolific scorers last
season.came on strong in the second
half to lead the Demons with 14
points.
