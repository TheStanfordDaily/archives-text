GAME NOTES: Stanford got off to the right
start last weekend, winning its three games

points in a row and the No. 23 Cardinal (3-0) took the lead for
good.
"Back to normal," said Goods, who had battled an upset
stomach earlier in the weekend.
Once again, Stanford exploited its size and strength advan
tages inside, dominating the Gauchos 45-28 on the boards.
Sophomore center Robin Lopez scored 12 points on 4-of-4
shooting from the field, also adding three rebounds, two blocks
and two steals.
Alex Harris finished with IS points to lead UCSB (2-I),but
was limited to six points on 3-of-10 shooting from the field in
the second half as the Cardinal cranked up the defensive inten
sity.
"When we get into it, we're a pretty good defensive team,"
said senior Fred Washington, who matched up against Harris
most of the game. "And we don't even have Brook |Lopez, ac
ademically ineligible for fall quarter] back yet."

The Gauchos hung tough with Stanford in the first half,
trailing by 11 at intermission and starting the second stanza
with a 6-0 spurt to close the gap to 35-30. But junior guard
Mitch Johnson (seven points, six rebounds, five assists) hit a
three-pointer and passed to a soaring Robin Lopez for a one
handed alley-oop on the next possession.The Cardinal went on
an 11-0 run, opened a 16-point lead and never looked back.
Free throws were the only Achilles heel for Stanford, which
made 24 of 39 attempts.

Asked to elaborate,coach Johnson agreed: "It just sucks."
Overall, however. Johnson said he was happy with the way
the team played over the weekend, showing a killer instinct
against feisty yet ultimately overmatched opposition, and
avoiding the embarrassing early-season losses that befell na
tional powers Kentucky and Southern California.
