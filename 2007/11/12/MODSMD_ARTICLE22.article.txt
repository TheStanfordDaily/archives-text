## A 						Slippery Slope 
### 
On Saturday, 124th-ranked
Alessio Di Mauro of Italy
was suspended from AIT
play for nine months and fined
$60,000 for betting on tennis match
es.
He was found guilty of making a
total of 120 bets on tennis matches
with an online bookmaker between
November 2006 and June 2007.1 le is
the first tennis player to be sanc
tioned under the ATP s new anti-cor
ruption rules.
An investigation into the bets
found that none of the bets placed
were on his own matches, nor did
they influence the results of the
matches.
"This does underline our policy of
players and staff wagering on ten
nis," ATP president Etienne de Vil
liers said to ESPN."If we do not have
a sport with integrity we do not have
a sport. We recognized in 2003 the
threat of online betting. We take this
really seriously."
Di Mauro, however, disagreed.
"The sentence is too harsh," he said
in Sunday editions of La Gazzetta
dello Sport. "I made a silly mistake
and I'm being punished excessively. I
could go down in history as the only
player banned for betting in tennis."
When asked if he was being used

"Match-fixing shows
a lack of respect for
everyone, from the
opponent to the
fans. I'm completely
in good faith."
-Alessio Di Mauro

as a scapegoat, Di Mauro said: "I
think so, because match-fixing is
much more serious than betting.
There's a big difference between
someone who has a vice for betting
on many sports — from soccer to
basketball to volleyball and some
times also on tennis — and someone
who sells matches.
"[Match-fixing shows] a lack of
respect for everyone, from the oppo
nent to the fans. I'm completely in
good faith."
The Italian Tennis Federation also
spoke out in Di Mauro's defense.
"They say he never committed sport
ing fraud, so the only thing he did was
bet. which is prohibited and should
definitely be punished," spokesper
son Giancarlo Baccini said. "But
there have been players banned only
six months for doping, so nine
months for Di Mauro seems dispro
portionate."
ITie argument, it seems, is that be
cause Di Mauro did not intend to in
fluence nor actually influence the
outcomes of any matches — because
Di Mauro did not commit sports
fraud — his punishment is dispro
portionate to those who did do so,
namely those who were caught dop
ing.
This may be true. But it may also
be true that his punishment, as a
whole, is fair.
Di Mauro is not being used as a
scapegoat. He is not being punished
on behalf of other tennis players who
have bet and/or fixed matches and
who the ATP has not yet been able to
identify and sanction. Rather, he is
being used to set a precedent; he is
being punished so severely to deter
other tennis players from following a
similar course of action in the future,
to demonstrate that the ATP will not
tolerate any betting, regardless of the
scale.
Suppose the ATP let Di Mauro
slide on this incident. Suppose that
they found Di Mauro's $I5 $2() bets
on tennis matches so miniscule as to
not merit any sort of punishment.
ITien more tennis players begin to
bet on tennis matches. Bets go up in
crementally — players begin bet
ting $15-$2 O. then up their betting to
$50-$ 100, so on and so forth.
Given this, where do you draw
the line in betting? At what levels
can players start influencing games?
As long as betting by players is con
doned, we can never be sure.
De Villiers drew the line at $0.1 le
recognized that sports betting cre
ates a "slippery slope" into sporting
fraud — and used the example of Di
Mauro to demonstrate that the ATP
would not tolerate such a thine.
