# Field hockey falls in first round
## Stanford's late season run ends versus North Carolina 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford field hockey's inspired
run to the NCAA Tournament
ended after a 4-0 loss to No. 1 North
Carolina on Saturday. The Tar Heels
took a four-goal lead in the first half
and never looked hack against the
Cardinal, ending Stanford best sea
son in years.
The Cardinal advanced to the
NCAA Tournament after winning
both the NorPac Tournament title
(in 3-1 win over archrival California)
and a play-in game against North
east Conference Champion, Lock
Haven (which Stanford pulled out,
1-0). The team had a year to remem
ber under fifth-year head coach Les
ley Irvine, going 13-8 overall and 5-1
in conference. The win total of 13
was the second-most that the pro
gram has won in school history.
Stanford came into the match
against North Carolina with high
hopes,citing a "nothing to lose" atti
tude coupled with the team's hot
play as of late. However, the Tar
Heels crushed the Cardinal's hopes
early and often, outshooting Stan
ford 23-4 and scoring three goals he
fore the game's first 20 minutes.
" 1 was really proud of the way our
team played, particularly in the sec
ond half." Irvine told
GoStanford.com. "1 think we
showed a tremendous amount of
heart and determination. Our team
is very, very young and we are excit
ed for the future of this program.
Qualifying for the NCAA Tourna
ment is a great achievement to build
on."
As the sentiments of coach Irvine
express, the Cardinal, as a whole, was
pleased with its season and look to
build on all the players have gained
this year. The team loses only two
seniors from this year's squad —
forward Jess Zutz and goalkeeper
Madison Bell — and will have a
plethora of experience to move for
ward with.
And. as Zutz explained in an in
terview before Saturday's loss to
North Carolina, "regardless of what
happens on Saturday, 1 couldn't have
ever imagined a better way for my
career to end."
