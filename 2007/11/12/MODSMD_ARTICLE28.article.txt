# STUDENT GROUPS
## Summit offers advice to student groups Workshop explores cooperation with admins 
### SUSANA MONTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Experienced undergraduate
event planners offered advice on
how student groups can work
through funding intricacies and
event planning strategies at the first
annual ASSU Volunteer Student
Organization Collaboration Summit
on Friday afternoon in the Old
Union Nitery.
According to ASSU Vice Presi
dent Mondaire Jones '09, about 100
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents attended the Friday workshops
and Saturday night dinner.
During a panel discussion titled
"Working with the University" four
undergraduate student organizers
shed light on how to work effectively
with campus administrators, funding
organizations and vendors. They also
shared tips on how to enhance event
planning strategies.
Panelists encouraged student
groups to meet regularly with an ad
visor from the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA).
"The relationship you build [with
an OSA advisor] is the best way to
pass the University's red tape." said
Nick Cheng, student development
and leadership assistant at the Haas

Center, adding that the OSA advisors
know the major players that need to
be contacted for a specific event.
According to Candace Jones *08,
co-president of the Black Student
Union, the best way to build a good
relationship with advisors is to be
"persistent but not confrontational."
She called determination a key factor
in event planning.
However, the panelists acknowl
edged that it was better to be patient
in some instances.
"You have to understand that
right now there is only one OSA ad
visor for 2(X) student groups," Cheng
said,"and so it is sometimes more dif
ficult to get advice and support."
In order to dodge possible delays
when planning, student groups were
encouraged to learn the University's
hierarchical structure and to research
how offices are run across campus.
"You need to know who heads
what [office] so you can build rela
tionships as soon as possible," Can
dace Jones said.
Cheng also emphasized that when
planning an event for the first time, it
is better to do so on a smaller scale.
When looking for support from cam
pus administrators, previous events'
successes will be taken into account.
"It's not about starting a new
event but also about how different
and successful your event is from
those organized in previous years,"
he said.
Student organizations should

know that all the events do not run
the same way, said Junior Class co-
President Jessica Lu '09.
Panelists stressed that risk is a
huge factor that should be taken into
account when planning an event. If
an event is considered risky, adminis
trators will want to know every single
detail.
"For Moonsplash we had a 36-foot
tall wooden and plastic tower," said
Weston Mcßride coordinator of
Sigma Nu's Moonsplash party last

year."But they [administrators] were
afraid that it could fall."
Alcohol is another issue that com
plicates event planning. Mcßride said
the University's security policies for
an event depend on the presence of
alcohol, the number of people at
tending and the event location, so
planning in advance is highly recom
mended.
According to the panelists, if the
University determines that an event
needs security, the host group is re

sponsible for hiring personnel.
"Security is very expensive," Lu said.
Panelists also offered advice on
how student groups could secure
funding, encouraging attendees to
check the ASSU Web site to learn
about the Senate Appropriations
Committee, which allocates student
group funds.
While Candace Jones said the Ap
propriations Committee is the pri
mary source of student group fund
ing, she pointed students toward al

ternatives.
"You can also get funding though
the Graduate Student Council or the
University departments," she said,
"and you can also co-sponsor with
other volunteer student organiza
tions, collaborate with the Speakers
Bureau if you are bringing outside
speakers or even request funding
from the Freshman Dean's Office."
