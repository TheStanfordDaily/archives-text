### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Doctor and medical anthropologist Paul Farmer,
co-founder of the healthcare organization Partners
In Health (PIII). returned to campus Saturday night
to give the keynote address for the FACE AIDS Na
tional Conference.
Speaking to a mostly-full Memorial Auditorium.
Farmer covered PlH's "scale-up" of healthcare serv

to the $150,000 raised for I'll I by Dance Marathon
last February.
Farmer admitted that before the success of last
year's 24-hour dance party, he had been skeptical of
the event's fundraising capabilities.
"Even the night of Dance Marathon I said,' How
are you going to raise $150,000 by dancing?"' Farmer
said. "You're not Jennifer Lopez."

up" or "contiguous spread" of healthcare in Rwanda
according to the I'll I healthcare model.
"We feel that in medicine and public health there
hasn't been a lot of focus on delivery, on implemen
tation." Farmer said.
PlH's dedication to finding a successful model is
changing this lack of focus, he said. The community
based model, which employs local health workers for
in-home consultations, makes comprehensive care
