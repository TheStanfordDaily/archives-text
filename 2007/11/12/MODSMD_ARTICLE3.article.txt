## Farmer lays out Rwanda health plan In second annual visit, doctor calls for "contiguous spread” of care 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Doctor and medical anthropologist Paul Farmer,
co-founder of the healthcare organization Partners
In Health (PIII). returned to campus Saturday night
to give the keynote address for the FACE AIDS Na
tional Conference.
Speaking to a mostly-full Memorial Auditorium.
Farmer covered PlH's "scale-up" of healthcare serv
ices in Rwanda and praised the work of Stanford's
own FACE AIDS and Dance Marathon, whose
fundraising directly contributes to I'll I s clinics.
Sponsored by the ASSU. FACE AIDS. Dance
Marathon and the Graduate School of Businesses
Center for Social Innovation, Farmer's address was
attended by students, professors and community
members alike, though in fewer numbers than last
year's talk.
"Because I was here only 1 l-and-a-half months
ago, I thought I would give an update on what we've
been up to with your money," Farmer said, referring
to the $150,000 raised for I'll I by Dance Marathon
last February.
Farmer admitted that before the success of last
year's 24-hour dance party, he had been skeptical of
the event's fundraising capabilities.
"Even the night of Dance Marathon I said,' How
are you going to raise $150,000 by dancing?"' Farmer
said. "You're not Jennifer Lopez."
Hie funds, he said, have gone towards the "scale
up" or "contiguous spread" of healthcare in Rwanda
according to the I'll I healthcare model.
"We feel that in medicine and public health there
hasn't been a lot of focus on delivery, on implemen
tation." Farmer said.
PlH's dedication to finding a successful model is
changing this lack of focus, he said. The community
based model, which employs local health workers for
in-home consultations, makes comprehensive care
available to all. Ile said the pro
gram also provides holistic care for
entire communities, including food,
education, clean water and income
generating projects.
"We're doing three things at
once," Farmer said of PlH's work,
"taking care of sick people, rebuild
ing infrastructure and training lots
of people."
Farmer — whose work to cure
infectious diseases and bring West
ern standards of healthcare to
poverty-ridden pockets of Haiti
and Peru is chronicled in Tracy Kid
der's book "Mountains Beyond
Mountains" — is renowned for his
commitment to health as a human
right and dedication to providing
the best standards of care to all pa
tients. regardless of cost.
Farmer illustrated PlH's suc
cesses Saturday night with a
slideshow presentation showing be
fore-and-after shots of former pa
tients and the recently renovated
Rwinkwavu clinic.
Flipping to a slide comparing be

fore-and-after photos of the clinic's
pediatrics ward. Farmer elicited
gasps and audible "wows" from the
audience.
"Since we're in Silicon Valley, 1
can say it's not rocket science, it's
not that difficult," Farmer said.
"You lay down the tile, you clean it
up, you paint it up, you put in the
beds. It's not that hard."
With the proper supplies, treat
ing human cases is not impossible
either, he said. He gave the example
of Jennifer, a reportedly orphaned
toddler suffering from AIDS, tuber
culosis and malnutrition, who was
brought in by a community health
worker, treated and then recovered
to a point at which her mother came
to claim her.
"If you can meet children like
[Jennifer] and get them better, get
the mother involved in this work,
inspire the community health work
er to continue work like this, get
people involved in HIV prevention,
that might be called starting some
sort of virtuous social cycle,"

Farmer said.
Supplying food, employment
and education for patients "should
not be something we're embar
rassed about." he added."but some
thing we should try to coordinate in
our ambitious efforts."
But implementing such a model
takes money, which is where
fundraising efforts like FACE AIDS
and Dance Marathon are vital.
While Farmer said the Rwandan
government has set a date for when
investments from its tax base will
take over from foreign investments
in healthcare, it is still long off.
Meanwhile, students involved in
FACE AIDS and Dance Marathon
will continue fundraising, inspired
by the path Farmer has taken.
' FACE AIDS National Events
Director Silvia Loica-Mersa 'OS
cited two reasons for bringing
Farmer to campus for a second year
in a row.
'•'Hie first thing is giving people
who didn't get a chance to see him
at the sold-out event last year a

chance to see him this year," she
said."And now that FACE AIDS is
phasing out its pin making in Zam
bia and moving to Rwanda, we
wanted to show people where their
money is going."
Students in the audience wel
comed the chance to see a popular
role model for a second time.
"He inspired my career path."
said John Thomas '10. who plans to
pursue medicine and focus on inter
national health. Thomas, a member
of FACE AIDS, said he could ap
preciate this year's address even
more than the last after being ex
posed to the group's work.
Farmer, too, welcomed the trip
back to the Farm.
"It's very promising to be able to
come back a year later and say,
'Well, it worked,"' Farmer said of
the Rwandan scale-up. "I look for
ward to coming back in future years
to report more success."
