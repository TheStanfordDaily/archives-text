tablished itself as one of the country's top teams this
weekend, using two Candice Wiggins free throws

after a 100-44 cakewalk to open the season versus
Yale on Friday.
Wiggins, a senior guard, and sophomore center
Jayne Appel scored the last four points of the game
to deliver the Cardinal (2-0) the win over Rutgers (0-
1), the 2007 national runner-up. Wiggins led Stanford
with l l > points, while Appel (18 points. 13 rebounds)
and freshman forward kayla Pedersen (15 points. 16

loss when sophomore guard Melanie Murphy's
three point attempt hit iron. But Pedersen skied for
the rebound, and Appel nailed a jumper seven sec
onds later to tie the game at 58.
