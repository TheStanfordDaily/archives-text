## Stanford beats No. 3 Rutgers Cardinal makes statement in 60- 58 nail-biter over Scarlet Knights 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team es
tablished itself as one of the country's top teams this
weekend, using two Candice Wiggins free throws
with less than a second left to score a tight 60-58 win
over No. 3 Rutgers last night.The win came two days
after a 100-44 cakewalk to open the season versus
Yale on Friday.
Wiggins, a senior guard, and sophomore center
Jayne Appel scored the last four points of the game
to deliver the Cardinal (2-0) the win over Rutgers (0-
1), the 2007 national runner-up. Wiggins led Stanford
with l l > points, while Appel (18 points. 13 rebounds)
and freshman forward kayla Pedersen (15 points. 16
rebounds) each notched double-doubles, playing
nearly the entire game in the post for the Cardinal.
Down 58-56 with less than a minute remaining,
the Cardinal appeared headed for a heartbreaking
loss when sophomore guard Melanie Murphy's
three point attempt hit iron. But Pedersen skied for
the rebound, and Appel nailed a jumper seven sec
onds later to tie the game at 58.
After Rutgers guard
Essence Carson missed a
three-pointer with five
seconds left, Wiggins
scrambled for the rebound
and was fouled by the
Scarlet Knights' lipiphan
ny Prince. Wiggins, a pre
season All-American,
calmly stepped to the line
and sunk both free throws
with one-tenth of a second
remaining to secure the
Cardinal victory.
Despite her late-game
heroics, Wiggins had
somewhat of an off-night
from the field.The 5 foot 9
senior hit only 5-of-12
shots and missed all of her
three-point attempts, hut
converted 9-of-ll from
the charity stripe. A poor
shooting performance
from Wiggins might have
doomed the Cardinal last
year, but this year's squad
has a much deeper arsenal
of shooters. Redshirt
