catches for 141 yards. His efforts weren't enough, however, as Stanford could not
execute when it needed to in Saturday's 33-1 7 loss to the Cougars.
offense exploited scams in Stanford's
zone defense. The secondary, playing
without its m'ost productive corner
hack in Nick Sanchez, was outplayed
by WSU's three-receiver sets. The
Cardinal blitz package was nullified
by throws to tight end Jed Collins be
hind the pressure; Collins caught 10
passes for 123 yards.
Pritchard finished 22 of 40 with
two interceptions. It was a homecom
ing of sorts for the Cardinal quarter
back, whose father played center for
the Cougars in the early 1980s and
whose uncle. Jack Thompson, has his
number 14 retired as the first of many
great WSU quarterbacks.
Pritchard was routinely harassed
(four sacks and a lost fumble) by a fe
rocious Cougar pass rush from both
the defensive line and linebackers,
but made some impressive throws
from the pocket. ITie best was a
pump-fake 23-yard vertical pattern
to Bradford that put the ball at the
WSU six-yard line late in the third
quarter.The bang-bang sideline catch
was reviewed and upheld, and Stew
art scored a touchdown two plays
later to cut the Cougar lead to 20-17.
In contrast to Pritchard's scram
bling heroics in his first start in Octo
ber, in his sixth start the Washington

native was largely stifled when
chased out of the pocket.
Washington State opened up a 13-
0 third-quarter lead, but could have
had more were it not for impressive
stops by the Stanford defense inside
its own 25-yard line. WSU fumbled
the ball away at the Stanford six and
again at the 24, and was stopped on
downs twice in the first half. After
Brink found Ben Woodard all alone
for a 12-yard touchdown, true fresh
man Doug Baldwin took the ensuing
kickoff to the WSU 41. Pritchard con
verted two fourth downs on the 11-
play drive, setting up Tyrone Mc-
Graw's 4-yard touchdown run.
However. Stanford couldn't take
the lead on a gift-wrapped turnover,
as WSU fumbled the ensuing kickoff
and the Cardinal's Nate Wilcox-
Fogel recovered at the WSU five
yard line. After two would-be inter
ceptions were dropped by Cougar
defensive backs, Derek Belch kicked
a 24-yard field goal, his first make
after two first-half kicks went wide
right.
Washington State got its bearings
after that, scoring on a 12-yard touch
down run by Kevin McCall on the
next drive, and stayed in control the
rest of the game. The Cougars never

trailed in the contest.
The Cardinal's focus appeared to
dissolve in a critical fourth-quarter
drive that started at the Stanford 45.
Trailing by six, the table appeared to
be set for another Pritchard special
— a one-point nail-biting comeback
win on the road — but the opportuni
ty was undone by mental mistakes.
Stanford used two timeouts on the
drive to avoid illegal substitution and
delay of game penalties. After a third
and-2 run gained only one yard. Stan
ford took a delay of game penalty
while lining up for a 52-yard field goal.
Harbaugh said of the penalty:"For
some reason the offensive line ran off
the field. I don't know why they ran
off the field as the field goal unit was
coming on. Then we had to get them
back out there and 1 thought we were
going to get it off but it didn't get
snapped in time."
Now faced with fourth-and-6 from
the Cougar 40. the Cardinal elected
to punt. A Stanford player was called
for fair-catch interference, placing
the ball at the WSU 31. The Cougars
then.ended a four-minute drive with a
32-yard field goal that all but put the
game away at 26-17. Husain Abdul
lah intercepted Pritchard on the next
play.going 55 yards for the final score.

NOTES
• Brink and WSU receiver Michael
Bumpus both broke school records in
the game. Brink's touchdown pass to
Ben Woodard broke Jason Gesser's
career touchdown pass record of 70,
and Bumpus' first catch broke Hugh
Campbell's school record of 176 ca
reer receptions.
• Alex Brink extended his school
record career passing yardage to
10,200. He is the eighth Pac-10 quar
terback to cross the 10.000-yard

after Stanford knocked Cougar quar
terback Josh Swogger out for the sea
son in 2(X)4.
• Tavita Pritchard's father and uncle

relatives, part of a large network that
owes itself to Pritchard's grandfather,
a patriarch of Samoan immigration

State.
• Mark Bradford's career totals stand
at 157 catches for 2,236 yards. He is
now in the top 10 in Stanford history
in both categories.

catches for 141 yards. His efforts weren't enough, however, as Stanford could not
execute when it needed to in Saturday's 33-1 7 loss to the Cougars.
offense exploited scams in Stanford's
zone defense. The secondary, playing
without its m'ost productive corner
hack in Nick Sanchez, was outplayed
by WSU's three-receiver sets. The
Cardinal blitz package was nullified
by throws to tight end Jed Collins be
hind the pressure; Collins caught 10
passes for 123 yards.
Pritchard finished 22 of 40 with
two interceptions. It was a homecom
ing of sorts for the Cardinal quarter
back, whose father played center for
the Cougars in the early 1980s and
whose uncle. Jack Thompson, has his
number 14 retired as the first of many
great WSU quarterbacks.
Pritchard was routinely harassed
(four sacks and a lost fumble) by a fe
rocious Cougar pass rush from both
the defensive line and linebackers,
but made some impressive throws
from the pocket. ITie best was a
pump-fake 23-yard vertical pattern
to Bradford that put the ball at the
WSU six-yard line late in the third
quarter.The bang-bang sideline catch
was reviewed and upheld, and Stew
art scored a touchdown two plays
later to cut the Cougar lead to 20-17.
In contrast to Pritchard's scram
bling heroics in his first start in Octo
ber, in his sixth start the Washington

native was largely stifled when
chased out of the pocket.
Washington State opened up a 13-
0 third-quarter lead, but could have
had more were it not for impressive
stops by the Stanford defense inside
its own 25-yard line. WSU fumbled
the ball away at the Stanford six and
again at the 24, and was stopped on
downs twice in the first half. After
Brink found Ben Woodard all alone
for a 12-yard touchdown, true fresh
man Doug Baldwin took the ensuing
kickoff to the WSU 41. Pritchard con
verted two fourth downs on the 11-
play drive, setting up Tyrone Mc-
Graw's 4-yard touchdown run.
However. Stanford couldn't take
the lead on a gift-wrapped turnover,
as WSU fumbled the ensuing kickoff
and the Cardinal's Nate Wilcox-
Fogel recovered at the WSU five
yard line. After two would-be inter
ceptions were dropped by Cougar
defensive backs, Derek Belch kicked
a 24-yard field goal, his first make
after two first-half kicks went wide
right.
Washington State got its bearings
after that, scoring on a 12-yard touch
down run by Kevin McCall on the
next drive, and stayed in control the
rest of the game. The Cougars never

trailed in the contest.
The Cardinal's focus appeared to
dissolve in a critical fourth-quarter
drive that started at the Stanford 45.
Trailing by six, the table appeared to
be set for another Pritchard special
— a one-point nail-biting comeback
win on the road — but the opportuni
ty was undone by mental mistakes.
Stanford used two timeouts on the
drive to avoid illegal substitution and
delay of game penalties. After a third
and-2 run gained only one yard. Stan
ford took a delay of game penalty
while lining up for a 52-yard field goal.
Harbaugh said of the penalty:"For
some reason the offensive line ran off
the field. I don't know why they ran
off the field as the field goal unit was
coming on. Then we had to get them
back out there and 1 thought we were
going to get it off but it didn't get
snapped in time."
Now faced with fourth-and-6 from
the Cougar 40. the Cardinal elected
to punt. A Stanford player was called
for fair-catch interference, placing
the ball at the WSU 31. The Cougars
then.ended a four-minute drive with a
32-yard field goal that all but put the
game away at 26-17. Husain Abdul
lah intercepted Pritchard on the next
play.going 55 yards for the final score.

NOTES
• Brink and WSU receiver Michael
Bumpus both broke school records in
the game. Brink's touchdown pass to
Ben Woodard broke Jason Gesser's
career touchdown pass record of 70,
and Bumpus' first catch broke Hugh
Campbell's school record of 176 ca
reer receptions.
• Alex Brink extended his school
record career passing yardage to
10,200. He is the eighth Pac-10 quar
terback to cross the 10.000-yard
mark. Brink's first start came about
after Stanford knocked Cougar quar
terback Josh Swogger out for the sea
son in 2(X)4.
• Tavita Pritchard's father and uncle
attended the game along with over 20
relatives, part of a large network that
owes itself to Pritchard's grandfather,
a patriarch of Samoan immigration
and integration in the Seattle area.
Pritchard's cousin. Tony Thompson,
is a long snapper for Washington
State.
• Mark Bradford's career totals stand
at 157 catches for 2,236 yards. He is
now in the top 10 in Stanford history
in both categories.
