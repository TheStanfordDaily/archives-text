## Parking lot Paradise? Is 21,000 parking spaces sufficient for campus traffic? 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
E, ver feel like finding u parking space on campus is in
creasingly difficult? You're not alone.The Daily decid
ed to find some answers to the source of frustration for
.. many students.
"We have approximately 21.(XX) parking spaces," said
Brodie I lamilton. director of Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (P&TS). "Out of those 21 ,(XX) parking spaces, we are at
approximately 80 percent utilization rate, so we never max
out."
Hamilton's comments prompted further questions: Just
how many cars does this campus deal with on a daily basis?
Are those parking spaces really sufficient? Detailed statistics
on the number of cars on campus were not readily available
from P&TS, soThe Daily used the latest Stanford University
Traffic Monitoring Report, from November 2006, to calculate
the figures.
The report gave data from a cordon count that tallied the
number of vehicles entering and exiting the campus. Counts
were set up at 16 entry and exit points, forming a cordon
around the campus.
The calculations yielded some interesting results. On a ran
domly chosen day (Monday, Apr. 17,2(X)6) the total number of
cars entering campus was an astounding 36,575 and the total
number leaving was 36.224 over the course of 24 hours.
In lii>ht of these statistics, one must wonder whether the

21.(XX) parking spaces on campus is adequate. If all 36.(XX)
were to be on campus at the same time, approximately 15.(XX)
cars would be without a parking space.
Interestingly, the 36,(XX) figure also excludes what is re
ferred to as "cut-through" traffic.
According to the report, "License plate numbers are
recorded for each entering and exiting vehicle to determine
the amount of non-campus traffic."
Ilius, it can be assumed that all the traffic statistics record-

ed in the report are directly involved with campus. For the
spring counts, the average a.m. and p.m. cut through rates were
13.94 percent and 15.72 percent, respectively. If we were to in
clude these figures, the amount of traffic on campus would be
even higher.
However, Hamilton said that the number of parking spaces
available is sufficient to deal with the demand.
"If we say there are approximately 21,000 spaces at 80 per
cent capacity, then roughly at any particular time, assuming

that there are no major events going on,
there will be about I.(KK) free parking
spaces available," he explained.
The report also revealed that on average
for 2006, during the a.m. peak hour. 3,048
cars entered campus, and during the p.m.
peak hour, 3,427 cars exited the campus.
Peak hours varied depending on the road in
question, but were generally between 7:45
and 8:45 a.m. and 4:45 and 5:45 p.m.
Palm Drive alone had 5.476 cars enter
ing campus on Apr. 17.2006. Of these, 527
were during the morning rush hour.
Hamilton also provided statistics de
tailing changes in the number of parking
spaces over the last 10 years. Hie data
shows that despite a slight decrease in the
last few years, the number of parking
spaces has slowly increased over the past
decade.
In 1997, there were 18,310 parking
spaces; in 2002 there were 20.107;and as of
Nov. 7, there were 21,378 parking spaces on
campus.
However, Hamilton acknowledged
that the number of parking spaces varies
regularly for a variety of different reasons.
"The University is in a constant state of
flux, especially with all the construction
going on," he said. "This really affects the
number of parking spaces we have."
I"here appears to be a slight trend over
the last 10 years to increase the number of
parking spaces on campus, and with the
four-level Wilbur Field underground park
ing structure expected to be completed
later this academic year, another 1.187
parking stalls will become available.
One can only wonder what this means
for the future. Some days it feels as though
there are almost too many bikes and cars
on campus â€” if there were more parking
spaces made available, might that encour
age more students to have cars, thus exac
erbating the situation? More vehicular
traffic would likely lead to more biking ac
cidents. a phenomenon that has almost be
come a rite of passage for freshmen new to
the Farm.
