November 12,1975: The Drink
ing Issue — Frai tasters puzzle
over beer
One can indeed tell European beer from
the lower priced domestic brew, a panel of
Stanford experts has determined.
Converging on the Daily office for a sci
entific sampling of campus tastes, represen
tatives of nine fraternities proved that im
ported Heineken was discernible to the dis
cerning drinker.
Asked to sort out six brands from un
marked cups, the frat rats generally fared
poorly, but five were able to spot the
Heineken.
"Bring in a case of that number five,"
Delta Upsilon's Mike Mcßride said, refer
ring to the coded Heineken. "That was
great."
"No way, 'cause that stuff's horrible,"
replied Kappa Alpha's Tim Conway, embar
rassing the proud connoisseurs of his lake
side house.
Mcßride wrote on his scoresheet beside
number five, "There's only one Heineken."
John Percival of Delta Kappa Epsilon also
noted the difference. "Much more body,
taste than other beers. By far better than
[the] other, American beers." he wrote of
Heineken.
