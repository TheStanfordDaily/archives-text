### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Veteran Iraq correspondent Anthony Shadid
and Los Angeles Times foreign editor Marjorie
Miller came to Kresge Auditorium last night to
offer their views on the war in Iraq from the point
of view of the journalists on the ground.
The presentation was the first part of the Stan
ford Aurora Forum's "Iraq: Refranie" series. Sha

riences in Iraq from the initial build-up of the war
to the beginning of the insurgency. Miller moder
ated and offered her perspective as an editor.
According to both journalists, neither they nor
any of the reporters they encountered in the days
leading up to the 2003 start of the war envisioned
a long and protracted conflict in Iraq. Shadid
claimed that at the onset of the invasion, he
thought he would be transferred out of Baghdad
within a few weeks as fighting subsided.
However, following the capture of Baghdad
and the collapse of the Hussein regime, as much

Shadid said his vision of what he and his col

"You got the sense, then, that maybe there isn't
a plan and maybe they don't know what they're
doing," he said.
Shadid, an Arab-American of Lebanese de
scent, covered Baghdad prior to the invasion and
personally interviewed average Iraqi citizens. He
said that fear and confusion marked the atmos-

phere on the streets leading up to the war.
Journalists like Shadid were unsure of
which sources accurately portrayed the
feelings of the average Iraqi and which
were intended to mislead. As a result, he
said, much of the true pre-war climate was
lost to journalists.
"You wondered what to listen to, what to
hear," Shadid said. "Often what you hear is
exactly what you should write. People were
trying to reach out to me, and 1 don't think 1
listened to them as much as 1 should have."
"There was definitely a lot of fear that I
was getting (from the Iraqis] both on the
ground and in the stories 1 was getting
back," Miller added. "I think most of them
were afraid of the unknown."
Of all of the events surrounding the early
weeks of the war. Shadid said that Apr. 9,
2003 — the day that American troops and
tanks entered Baghdad — is still his most

distinct memory of the war. As a person of
Arab descent, Shadid claimed he felt a sense
of sadness that Baghdad, one of the most his
toric and important cities in the Arab world,
had been conquered, and that as an Ameri
can he felt a sense of worry of how America
would be able to handle inheriting a city that
had been intensely damaged by years of war,
sanctions and dictatorship.
"1 think most American [reporters]
thought, on that day, that it wasn't going to
be an occupation," he said.
Shadid and Miller expressed similar sen
timents regarding the state of correspon
dent reporting at this stage in the war: that
the confusion the journalists were feeling as
a result of the lack of credible information
made most of them afraid to go against the
"safe" story the American government was
reporting about the war.
"I think we feared how long and bloody

it could be," Miller said. "No one wanted to
let that genie out of the bottle."
Regarding the current state of reporting
on the Iraq War from the field, Shadid and
Miller cited a number of factors as con
tributing to the difficulty in getting the true
story across. Miller said that covering
events in Iraq is significantly more difficult
than it was for her to cover Latin America
in the 1980s, citing factionalism as the key
distinguishing aspect.
"Not only do you have the job of under
standing whether what the government is
saying is true or not, but we have to try to un
derstand all these different factions," she
said, adding that journalists are the worst
people to try to cover tribal cultures because
they live in an "empty space" devoid of reli
gion, tradition and family that is inhabited
only by expatriates and other journalists.
Shadid claimed that the most significant

reporting he was able to accomplish in
volved following subjects and events over
the course of time, a luxury rarely available
in Iraq. He said he was lucky, however,
being able to speak Arabic, as it added an
extra layer of "texture" to his stories that
could have been lost in translation. Miller
also touched upon the reporters' reliance
on translators and noted that, out of the ap
proximately 160 journalists and media
members who have been killed in Iraq, the
majority were Iraqi citizens.
"There's a degree to which we've outsourced
reporting that I don't think we're honest about,"
Miller said. "In some neighborhoods, it is margin
ally safer for them to go."
"The idea of a journalist being a non
combatant isn't the case anymore," Shadid
said. "It looks pretty grim."
The issue of withdrawal of U.S. forces
from Iraq did not come up in the presenta

tion until the question-and-answer session,
and neither Shadid nor Miller had much op
timism or any solutions to the problem. Sha
did stated that violence would get worse if
U.S. forces withdrew but that reconciliation
is not possible with a U.S. presence still in
the country. As to the situation for corre
spondents and media officials trying to
make sense of current American foreign
policy in the region. Miller stated that a
great deal of confusion and uncertainty still
looms throughout and that access is limited.
"The military is saying that explosives
are coming in from Iran," Miller said. "How
do we prove it? We think it's true, but we
also thought it was true about weapons of
mass destruction, and we didn't do too well
on that one."
