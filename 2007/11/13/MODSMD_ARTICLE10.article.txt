### 
In the Times of London's Higher
Education Supplement last week,
Stanford fell to 19th place - from
sixth place last year â€” in the
paper's ranking of the top world uni
versities. Harvard was ranked num
ber one, while Britain's Oxford and
Cambridge Universities fell into a
three-way tie with Yale for second
place.
The rankings are based on a sur
vey of 5,101 academics worldwide,
spanning a variety of disciplines.
Their opinions are combined with a
survey of 1,482 international gradu
ate employers. MIT, fourth on last
year's list, also fell this year to 10th
place. Other top-10 schools included
Imperial College London. Princeton,
CalTech, University College London
and the University of Chicago.
