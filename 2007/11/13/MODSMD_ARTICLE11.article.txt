### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman and sophomore Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) students held a videocon
ference yesterday morning with
students at Sweden's Orebro Uni
versity and Uppsala University.
Students in Alyssa O'Brien's
"Cross Cultural Rhetoric" and
Christine Alfano's "Cultural Inter
faces" spoke with the Swedish stu
dents as part of the Cross-Cultural
Rhetoric Project, which was piloted
last year.
In yesterday's videoeonference,
groups of three Stanford students
communicated in intimate groups
with three Swedish students, aided
by an interactive whiteboard and an
instant message chat.
In addition to fostering cultural
understanding and learning, the
project carried significance in the
reaim of international relations.
"1 think as we move conceptual
ly toward becoming an effective,
peaceful global community," Al
fano said, "it's really important to
understand how we can use tech
nology to overcome differences and
to facilitate productive exchanges."
Devoted to developing intercul
tural competencies through collab
oration and the effective use of
technology, the Cross-Cultural

Rhetoric Project — which secured
funding again for the 2007-08 aca
demic year through the Wallenberg
Global Learning Network — seeks
to investigate the critical role that
intercultural competence can play
in global communication and inter
national relations.
"In a time of instant global com
munication, we believe it is impor
tant for students to ... learn to view
issues and problems from varying
cultural and linguistic perspec
tives," said PWR Director and Eng
lish Prof. Andrea L.unsford, who is
the principle investigator for the
project.
"Working with students in Swe
den is one way to broaden our abil
ity to communicate clearly and sen
sitively across these divides," she
added. "Stanford students who
have participated in the project re
port that their awareness of cultur
al differences has grown exponen
tially and that they feel much better
able to communicate with people
from other cultural groups."
The project began with the goal
of giving PWR 2 students real, live
audiences for their research presen
tations.
"We thought that we would con
nect them through cutting-edge
technology to present ideas and re
search to other students from across
the globe," O'Brien said. "But in the
process, we learned that we had em
barked on something more signifi
cant — an opportunity for students
