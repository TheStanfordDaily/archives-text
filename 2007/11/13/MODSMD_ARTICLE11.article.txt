## PWR students take work internationally Classes videoconference with Europe, Asia 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman and sophomore Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) students held a videocon
ference yesterday morning with
students at Sweden's Orebro Uni
versity and Uppsala University.
Students in Alyssa O'Brien's
"Cross Cultural Rhetoric" and
Christine Alfano's "Cultural Inter
faces" spoke with the Swedish stu
dents as part of the Cross-Cultural
Rhetoric Project, which was piloted
last year.
In yesterday's videoeonference,
groups of three Stanford students
communicated in intimate groups
with three Swedish students, aided
by an interactive whiteboard and an
instant message chat.
In addition to fostering cultural
understanding and learning, the
project carried significance in the
reaim of international relations.
"1 think as we move conceptual
ly toward becoming an effective,
peaceful global community," Al
fano said, "it's really important to
understand how we can use tech
nology to overcome differences and
to facilitate productive exchanges."
Devoted to developing intercul
tural competencies through collab
oration and the effective use of
technology, the Cross-Cultural

Rhetoric Project — which secured
funding again for the 2007-08 aca
demic year through the Wallenberg
Global Learning Network — seeks
to investigate the critical role that
intercultural competence can play
in global communication and inter
national relations.
"In a time of instant global com
munication, we believe it is impor
tant for students to ... learn to view
issues and problems from varying
cultural and linguistic perspec
tives," said PWR Director and Eng
lish Prof. Andrea L.unsford, who is
the principle investigator for the
project.
"Working with students in Swe
den is one way to broaden our abil
ity to communicate clearly and sen
sitively across these divides," she
added. "Stanford students who
have participated in the project re
port that their awareness of cultur
al differences has grown exponen
tially and that they feel much better
able to communicate with people
from other cultural groups."
The project began with the goal
of giving PWR 2 students real, live
audiences for their research presen
tations.
"We thought that we would con
nect them through cutting-edge
technology to present ideas and re
search to other students from across
the globe," O'Brien said. "But in the
process, we learned that we had em
barked on something more signifi
cant — an opportunity for students
to understand, through hands-on ac
tive learning, more about the world
and different cultural values, per
spectives and beliefs."
Though yesterday's videocon
ference was successful, technologi
cal and linguistic issues made com
munication difficult for some of the
groups.
"Technology was already a prob
lem." said Lleyana Jack '10. "But it
was a lot smoother for us than for the
Swedish students since we had al
ready run through it. Language was
also slightly a barrier since the stu
dents are not entirely fluent in Eng

lish."
Evan Romero 10 found the ex
perience to be academically benefi
cial.
"It was a cool experience," he
said. "It was a nice opportunity to
appreciate the diversity that they
had — in their group, there were
students from Japan, France and
Sweden."
The connections made in the
classroom have led to further com
munication between the students.
"One of my students, Stephanie
Parker ['11 ], just visited my office,"
O'Brien said. "She said that her
group has been writing on each
other's Facebook walls all after
noon — now that's a sign of suc
cessful cross-cultural communica
tion."
The project has expanded its use

of asynchronous media — such as
wikis and blogs — to facilitate
deeper connections between stu
dents outside of the videoconfer
encing opportunities that they have
in class.
The project launched asynchro
nous collaboration with the Nation
al University of Singapore, and
Stanford students have been blog
ging with students in Singapore.
Soon, students in Sweden will join
the collaborative blog.
Organizers of the project hope
to develop a Center for Cross-Cul
tural Rhetoric at Stanford that
would be available to students in
Canada. Australia, South Africa.
Britain, Singapore, India and Den
mark. in addition to Sweden and
the U.S. In such a center, students
could meet in real-time or asvn

chronously to work together on is
sues related to inter- and cross-cul
tural understanding. As technolo
gies and the Internet continue to
change and evolve, the future of
this project is bright, according to
administrators.
in the future, we're exploring
ways to fold in technologies like
You Tube and virtual worlds into
our Cross-Cultural curriculum."
Alfano said. "We have even begun
talking about ways in which to hold
an international class meeting in
[the online virtual world] Second
Life in the spring, as a way of bring
ing all the students together in the
same space at the same time, even if
that space is a virtual one."
