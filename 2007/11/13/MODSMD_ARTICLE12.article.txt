## Editorial Board Disillusioned by brilliance 
### 
Co-founder and CEO of Yahoo! Jerry
Yang '90 had perhaps never in his
adult life received a verbal beat-down
as harsh as the one U.S. Congressmen so
zealously dispensed last week. The noted
Stanford alumnus and University Board of
Trustees member was summoned before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee to an
swer for a 2004 incident in which Chinese of
ficials identified and ultimately imprisoned
Chinese journalist Shi Tao after obtaining
his email records from Yahoo! From his
Yahoo! account. Shi had "divulged state se
crets abroad" by forwarding a government
communique warning journalists not cover
the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre to several foreign publica
tions. The 39-year-old Shi, first deprived of
his right to inform — and now of his basic
freedoms — is currently serving the second
year of his 10-year prison sentence.
In 2004, Yahoo! General Counsel
Michael Callahan told Congress that
Yahoo! employees at the time did not know
that a political dissident was sought when
the Chinese authorities requested informa
tion; Yang added that "if they give us the
proper documentation in a court order, we
give them things that satisfy local laws."
However, it was revealed last week that
Yahoo! personnel in I long Kong apparently
understood the nature of the allegations
against Shi when they handed over his per
sonal information. This, combined with
Yang's indifferent attitude and defense, has
resulted in repeated attacks by critics who
point out that YahooTs Hong Kong-based
holding company was not governed under
mainland Chinese law.
Yang, who finally apologized to Shi's
mother in court last lliursday after months
of apparent reluctance, has also refused the
demands of some U.S. Congressmen to offer
the Shi family financial aid. Callahan of

fered the feeble explanation that Chinese
officials might retaliate against the Shi fam
ily
Yet official intervention in Yahoo!'s busi
ness interests in China is a scenario that is
equally likely. Yahoo!'s presence in China
provides greater public access to informa
tion. and there may be necessary conces
sions made for the greater good. However,
handing over the private information of a
client with the knowledge of the repercus
sions is indefensible. We are certainly not
the first, nor will we be the last, to suspect
that Yahoo!'s betrayal of its own client ap
pears to be an attempt to ingratiate the gov
ernment of a country that holds enormous
profit potential.
Yang tried to appease his listeners by say
ing that he was hard at work with lawmakers
to establish legal guidelines for these fuzzy
intersections of international law and cor
porate ethics. However, his actions and
words thus far express indifference at best.
In one particularly ironic comment in his
testimony, he said, "I believed (at an early
age], as I believe now, that [the United
States] is a beacon of freedom to the rest of
the world." Moreover, those affiliated with
this University have every reason to cringe
as disgrace by association arrived in the next
sentence, as Yang spoke of his Stanford edu
cation.
At his brightest moments, Yang repre
sented one of our best, a true Stanford son
who became a patriarch of the Silicon Val
ley. Subsequent classes of Stanford students
embraced the role model of the man who
changed the world and simultaneously
made a vast fortune through his brilliance
and entrepreneurial spirit. But at this mo
ment, we at Stanford, like the many Chinese
who admire Yang's success after emigrating
to America at age 10. can only turn our
heads away in disillusioned shame.
