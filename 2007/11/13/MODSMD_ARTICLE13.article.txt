## Time for Congress to clear the smoke 
### 
Amid a campus climate that works
tirelessly to banish epidemic dis
eases like AIDS both at home and
abroad, it's easy to lose perspective on
health problems considered less preventa
ble, such as cancer. Hut since November is
National Lung Cancer Awareness Month,
it's worthwhile to think about a product
that's estimated to cause not only 30 percent
of total cancers in the United States, but also
heart disease, emphysema and other atten
dant respiratory ailments: tobacco.
From tobacco cultivators at Jamestown,
to the iconic Marlboro Man. to 2006's
tongue -in-cheek 112 ilm " Thank You for Smok
ing." tobacco has always played a part in
American history and mythology For some
time, tobacco use was viewed as evidence of
adulthood. Smoking, in addition to being a
pleasurable pastime, was sometimes even
medicinal: Camel ads from the 1940s and
'50s assured readers that more doctors
smoked Camels than any other brand for
their taste and throat-soothing properties.
By the time research began to tie smoking to
lung cancer and other systemic ailments, to
bacco already had a chokehold on Ameri
can society. Although the general public be
lieves that smoking in America has de
creased since its heyday of the 1940s and
19505, this view is largely mistaken.
While tobacco education and awareness
has c< ime a long way — today, most drug ed
ucation in schools includes information on
tobacco and its effects — statistics released
by the American Cancer Society show that
even though smoking has decreased since
1950, one in five Americans still smokes on
a regular basis today. And while much of to
bacco education aims to prevent youth from
picking up the habit, youth-centric statistics
are even more shocking.The CDC estimates
approximately 23 percent of current high
school students in the United States are reg
ular tobacco users; furthermore, approxi
mately 4.000 others between the ages of 12
and 17 begin smoking every day.
Therefore, while education and public
health initiatives have aided in curbing the
negative effects of tobacco, there is more to
be done. Decisive policy is needed to bridge
the personal and the political in the battle
against Big Tobacco.
Currently, the Food and Drug Adminis
tration has very little power to regulate the

tobacco industry in either production or
marketing, resulting in reduced consumer
protection, particularly when it comes to
targeting children and youth. Congressional
representatives from both parties have
agreed on the need for policy enabling the
FDA to monitor the tobacco industry more
closely. Exactly such a bill, the Family Smok
ing Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.
was introduced in 2(XX) and has been revived
at each Congressional session since then.
Attempts to enact the bill have narrowly
failed on several occasions, mostly languish
ing in committee without coming to the
floor.
If enacted, the act would allow the FDA
to place more stringent regulations and
checks on the tobacco industry. The act
would curtail adulteration of tobacco during
production, as well as provide for the estab
lishment of a base quality standard similar
to the standards applied to food production
or the drug industry. Additionally, the bill
would limit where and how tobacco prod
ucts could be advertised and allow for the
creation of a Tobacco Products Scientific
Advisory Committee.
However, supporters of free choice can
rest easy.The bill would not ban tobacco.nor
would it raise the legal age to purchase to
bacco products. Rather, the bill approaches
the issue of tobacco from a harm reduction
standpoint, trying to protect the interests of
those who choose to smoke while also look
ing out for the health of America's youth.
Reintroduced to the current Congressional
session in both chambers, the bill was cur
rently in committee as of late October and
will likely not emerge during this session.
Discussion of the act, then, takes on a more
symbolic than functionary role.The bill's ex
istence and persistence demonstrates the
timeliness of the issue; without regulation,
the impact of tobacco on American public
health will only be seen more strongly as
time goes on. Whether it be via the persist
ent Tobacco Control Act or some as-yet-un
written legislation. Congress needs to en
able the FDA to regulate, restrict and rein in
the tobacco industry — if only so we can all
breathe a little easier.
