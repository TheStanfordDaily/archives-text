# Pleading Inanity
## Moral Baggins 
### 
In Plato's "Republic," Book 2, Glaucon
tells the tale of Gyges' magic ring, a "pre
cious" ring, if you will, that renders its
bearer invisible. As Glaucon tells it, the
"lord" of this ring, once immune from the so
cietal repercussions of his misdeeds, would
not remain a moral "tower." Thus, Glaucon
concludes, morality is something we follow
only because we fear the reprisal of the "fel
lowships" to which we belong, and we will be
unjust whenever we are out of their sight.
A couple of weeks ago, 1 found myself
wearing Gyges" Ring (which, contrary to
popular belief, is not available through
Plato's memorabilia Web site). Through pure
happenstance, 1 was granted access to a
friend's Stanford email account — a friend
in whom I had more than a passing interest.
(Note to all you Webmail users: remember to

delete your single sign-on cookie before let
ting someone else use your computer!) After
scanning the email subjects and senders, I
quickly realized that I had to make an imme
diate decision: Do I read the emails or not?
One side of me pointed out that I hadn't
hacked into her account; it was basically pre
sented to me. When this sort of enticing and
highly relevant information was thrust in my
face, how could 1 not look? (That was the

lawyer speaking.) The other side of me, al
though speaking from my heart, didn't have
much of an argument. It just said, "This is
wrong. This isn't respecting her the way she
ought to be respected."
Well, for better or for worse, I didn't read
the emails. What surprised me afterward was
that, although I felt like I made the "right"
decision, I also felt like kind of an idiot. If I
had read her emails, the potential benefits
were innumerable: I could find out if she was
seeing other people, I could get a better idea
of how she felt about me, and I could even get
to know her tastes so that I could buy her
things that would "happen" to be her favorite
flower/food/author. In essence, I could have



Vishnu
Sridharan
made more informed decisions that
could have resulted in more net hap
piness for both of us. 1 low could that
have been the wrong choice?
And what did I get for respecting
her "privacy," a right so vital to
Americans, according to the
Supreme Court, that we enshrined it
in the penumbra of the Constitution
if you look at it through a kaleido
scope? Did she feel a boost in
morale the second I closed her
inbox? Did the God that 1 probably
don't believe in take note of my
righteous action, to be weighed
against my loads of impiety when the
day of reckoning arrives?
1 doubt it. The most immediate
result of my foolhardy foray into
ethics was clumsier attempts at ro
mance and less effective stabs at
charm.
Granted, there might have been
some negative repercussions to
scouring her inbox. 1 might have

been caught, or more likely, I might
have misinterpreted some of her
emails. The email, for instance, refer
ring to "the great sex we had last
night." from that guy — 1 always see
them spending time together, but
she insists they're "just friends" —
might actually be referring to
"primping our bangs." What's more,
maybe I'd get so interested in a cer
tain email thread (such as Re: Last
Night's Date:Strengths,Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats) that I'd
just have to hack into her account
again to see how it played out.
If I could get my hands on that
One Ring again, I'm not really sure
what I would do. For what it's worth,
though, I still feel good about what 1
did, and things haven't fallen apart
with that woman Maybe this sug
gests that, at the end of the day,
Socrates was onto something when
he said that justice belongs among
the highest class of desirable values
those desired both for their es
sential worth and their practical con
sequences.
