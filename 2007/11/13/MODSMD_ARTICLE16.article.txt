## Tech, cars and 'us': How I survived my first Crazy Blind Date 
### 
According to UrbiinDictionary.com,
the meaning of the word "desperate"
lies somewhere between having to
pee so badly you're about to wet your pants
and blue-balling to the point that you'll sleep
with anything with two legs.
In my case, "desperate" refers to signing
up last week for a site called Crazy√ülind-
Date.com, since, let's face it.the only thing
more desperate than letting the Internet set
you up on a blind date is writing a column so
that you have an excuse to let the Internet set
you upon a blind date.
Just launched Nov. 7 by the organization
behind the dating site OkC'upid!, Crazy
Blind Date sets up local area users with their
choice of either single or double dates.
Daters pick which times they are available,
and then can put down general requirements
for potential partners, such as being taller
than four feet or younger than 70.
Working with a 4 p.m. Monday deadline. I
had no choice but to be similarly liberal with
my own restrictions. Drawing the line at the
five-foot mark and at age 45,1 gave insipidly

amiable answers to questions regarding my
interests and expectations for the date and
submitted my profile. Within 24 hours, I had
a response.
Mike, praise the lord, was a puerile 22. He
also claimed to be tallish, average, blessed
with lots of dark hair and also really hot (ob
viously).
From the Crazy Blind Date-blurred pic
ture accompanying his profile, I had exactly
0 percent visual confirmation of any of this.
His profile stated, however, that he was good
at talking about five things: "Tech, cars, you,
me, us."
Yikes. The Web site reviewer Clipmarks.
com got it right when they characterized

Crazy Blind Date as for the "Fearless-But-
REALLY-Lonely ONLY." I figured there
was a pretty decent chance that anyone going
on this site probably had some sort of huge
social handicap. Like being a serial killer, or
not potty-trained.
There was also the equally likely chance
that they were even more desperate than I
was. The kind of people who, as a commenter
on the blog Tech Crunch puts it, try Crazy
Blind Date once: "Just after ballroom danc
ing classes, and before the suicide bomb."
Finding Mike at a Los Altos coffee shop
this Sunday, I was shocked when he actually
didn't seem to fit my abysmal expectations.
Certainly no Quasimodo, Mike even ap
peared exceedingly normal, and. for the first
four minutes, everything seemed to be
going fine. Then we ran out of things to talk
about.
I said I'm a Stanford student and never
mentioned this column. He said he works for
a software company in San Jose, and he and
