## Tech, cars and 'us': How I survived my first Crazy Blind Date 
### 
According to UrbiinDictionary.com,
the meaning of the word "desperate"
lies somewhere between having to
pee so badly you're about to wet your pants
and blue-balling to the point that you'll sleep
with anything with two legs.
In my case, "desperate" refers to signing
up last week for a site called Crazyßlind-
Date.com, since, let's face it.the only thing
more desperate than letting the Internet set
you up on a blind date is writing a column so
that you have an excuse to let the Internet set
you upon a blind date.
Just launched Nov. 7 by the organization
behind the dating site OkC'upid!, Crazy
Blind Date sets up local area users with their
choice of either single or double dates.
Daters pick which times they are available,
and then can put down general requirements
for potential partners, such as being taller
than four feet or younger than 70.
Working with a 4 p.m. Monday deadline. I
had no choice but to be similarly liberal with
my own restrictions. Drawing the line at the
five-foot mark and at age 45,1 gave insipidly

amiable answers to questions regarding my
interests and expectations for the date and
submitted my profile. Within 24 hours, I had
a response.
Mike, praise the lord, was a puerile 22. He
also claimed to be tallish, average, blessed
with lots of dark hair and also really hot (ob
viously).
From the Crazy Blind Date-blurred pic
ture accompanying his profile, I had exactly
0 percent visual confirmation of any of this.
His profile stated, however, that he was good
at talking about five things: "Tech, cars, you,
me, us."
Yikes. The Web site reviewer Clipmarks.
com got it right when they characterized

Crazy Blind Date as for the "Fearless-But-
REALLY-Lonely ONLY." I figured there
was a pretty decent chance that anyone going
on this site probably had some sort of huge
social handicap. Like being a serial killer, or
not potty-trained.
There was also the equally likely chance
that they were even more desperate than I
was. The kind of people who, as a commenter
on the blog Tech Crunch puts it, try Crazy
Blind Date once: "Just after ballroom danc
ing classes, and before the suicide bomb."
Finding Mike at a Los Altos coffee shop
this Sunday, I was shocked when he actually
didn't seem to fit my abysmal expectations.
Certainly no Quasimodo, Mike even ap
peared exceedingly normal, and. for the first
four minutes, everything seemed to be
going fine. Then we ran out of things to talk
about.
I said I'm a Stanford student and never
mentioned this column. He said he works for
a software company in San Jose, and he and


Courtney
Weaver
his co-workers like trying out differ
ent Silicon Valley cafeterias for
lunch. Had he ever been to the
Google cafeteria in Mountain View?
No. Had I? No.
Silence.
A few minutes later.it looked like
we had struck gold when he men
tioned he liked going to the shooting
range — something I had just done
for last week's column. Unfortunate
ly, it turns out that being able to write
8(X) words on a subject actually only
translates into being able to hold a
60-second conversation about it. We
floundered.
When some time later Mike sug
gested that it might be fun for us to

go to San Francisco together some
time, 1 knew that this little ol' crazy
blind date had run its course.
Meeting someone you don't
know for coffee is one thing. But
spending a whole day in the city talk
ing about tech and cars? Now that's
crazy
As 1 gave Mike a line that may or
may not have included the phrase
"It's not you, it's me," 1 told him that
1 wasn't really looking to date any
one right now. 1 excused myself, but
as 1 hid in the back of the coffee shop
waiting for him to leave, 1 couldn't
help but feel a bit guilty about the
whole thing.
On the scale between ballroom
dancing lessons and the suicide
bomb. I'm not sure whether the non
psychopathic and (presumably)
potty-trained Mike represents ulti
mate desperation or just bright-eyed
optimism.

Using Crazy Blind Date because
you feel like you can only get a date
using a blurred photograph and a
profile full of pick-up lines is one
thing. Using it because you're open
ininded to absolutely anyone being
the love of your life is another. What
if Mike was the latter?
Fortunately or unfortunately, 1
think I'm at least a fair ways away
from both states right now. But come
my 22nd birthday in seven months, 1
might just feel differently. And when
my undercover-college-reporter
blind date silently makes a mockery
of me from across the table, well,
maybe I'll regret not taking up
Mike's offer for a San Francisco
bound. tech and cars second date
after all.
