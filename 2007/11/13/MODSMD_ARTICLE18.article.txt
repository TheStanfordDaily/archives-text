Stanford, winning the individual title with a

"Our team came in with an awesome
ability to focus on what we needed to do to
get to nationals, and not be distracted."

McWalters told GovStanford.com. "The
crowds at Oregon are always so great and
supportive — we just wished they were
cheering for us, so we kind of pretend they
are. The whole team ran well and did their
best for their teammates. We have an amaz
ing group of women on this team who are so
supportive of each other."
Freshman Alexandra Gits and seniors
Arianna Lambie and Lauren Centrowitz
were also top-10 finishers for the tourna
ment. In third place. Gits clocked in with a
time of 20:23.40. last year's champion Lam
bie finished fifth in 20:31.25. and Centrowitz

Stanford combined for 100
points, led by senior Neftalem Araia
(30:08.35) and junior Hari Mix
(30:20.60). who had top-ten finishes
with times of 30:08.35 and 30:20.60,

redshirt senior

Both the men and women will
now travel to Indiana for next
week's NCAA Championships. The
women are looking to win their
third national straight title while the
men hope to improve on their
fourth-place finish from last year.
A third national title for the
women would solidify their place in
Stanford history, and the team has
high hopes going into next Mon
day's meet.
"Our class came in together, and
even as freshmen we were pretty
mature for our ages," McWalters
said. "We were also lucky to have
several upperclassmen here then
that helped us to deal with the tran
sition to college quickly. They had
been close to winning [nationals] a
couple years, and they taught us
things that we've been able to bene
fit from right away."
