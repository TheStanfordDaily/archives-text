Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they could beat the team below them.
Rank Last Week Comment
1. Oregon 2 Quality wins: Arizona State, USC, at Michigan. Loss: At Cat
literally by one inch.
2. 3 Quality wins: Virginia Tech, Florida, South Carolina,
Auburn, Alabama. Loss: at Kentucky, three OTs.
3. Ohio State 1 Quality wins: Wisconsin, Penn State, Purdue, Wisconsin,
all big. Loss: by seven vs. Illinois.
4. Oklahoma 4 Quality wins: Texas, Missouri, Texas A&M, Miami. Loss: by
3 at Colorado.
5. Missouri 7 Quality wins: At Illinois, Texas Tech, Nebraska, Texas A&M.
Loss: at Oklahoma, by seven.
6. Kansas 6 Quality wins: at Texas A&M, Nebraska, at Oklahoma State,
at Kansas State.
7. Virginia Tech 8 15-year losing streak to Florida State now broken. Huge
monkey off the Hokies' backs.
8. USC 9 Back to form of old, or is Cal just a weak duckling? We'll
find out come bowl (Rose?) time.
9. Florida 11 No defense to speak of, but Meyer does a better job com
pensating for that than anyone else.
10. Georgia 14 Dropped 45 points on an Auburn "D" that had allowed just
a single score in four of its last five games.
11. Arizona State 13 Nance, Herring combined for 170 behind the Pac-10's best
offensive line in win over UCLA.
12. West Virginia 5 Not sold on a team that consistently struggles on "D" and
allowed 31 to Louisville. Tough finish left.
13. Wisconsin 19 QB Donovan's not super-accurate, but mobile and clutch.
232 rush yards against Michigan.
14. Michigan 10 Saving Henne and Hart for Ohio State? OK. Saving the rush
defense and the team's heart? Not so much.
15. Texas 17 One pretty win doesn't make up for the eight ugly ones
right before.
16. Boston College 12 Once the bubble bursts for Cinderellas, things tend to get
ugly quick. (Exhibit A: Cal.)
17. Tennessee 18 55-3 win vs. UL-Lafayette. Only 20 more points now until
Fulmer reaches monthly quota.
18. Illinois NR Biggest surprise: Juice Williams, career 50 percent passer,
12-of-22, four TDs and nolNTs.
J9. Clemson 22 BC contest this week for ACC divisional crown — right to
face Virginia/Virginia Tech for title.
20. Cincinnati 24 Think they showed Connecticut, nation, who the key play
er was in the Big East. BCS for Bearcats?
21. Virginia NR 48-0 over Miami. Think revenge wasn't a factor after re
cent Miami dominance in the new ACC?
22. Penn State 25 Wisconsin, Illinois' wins raise profile of the league. A solid
team that wins the games it should.
23. Hawaii 23 That Fresno State win would have been more impressive
two seasons ago, but still 9-0.
24. California 20 Best four-loss team in the nation. Faint praise, perhaps,
but close losses to four solid teams.
25. Boise State NR Nov. 23 visit to Hawaii simply huge. Win out and senti
mental BCS bid a real possibility.
