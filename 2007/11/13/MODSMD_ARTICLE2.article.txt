## A 						Long Journey From apartheid to America, woman finds home on Farm 
### LUKE HENESY 
- hen Mhali Mphande '09 arrived in
A J the United States from the former
% /% j black apartheid township of Sowe
» / m / to< Africa,two years ago, she
had never even heard of Stanford.
The youngest of six children. Mphande lived "a com
pletely different lifestyle" under the oppressive rule of
the Afrikaans government. An elder brother was shot to
death in an anti-government protest, and an older sister
died of complications from ulcers — the over-the
counter antacids that could have cured her were un
available.
In high school, Mphande's battleground was not
emotional or social but physical, with students fighting
for life every day. She is reticent in speaking about her
early life, putting much of our conversation off the
record and declining to give her age.
Upon graduating high school in 20()3, Mphande
spent the next two years working and doing community
service in Soweto. When not selling home-brewed bev
erages on the street, she volunteered as a translator and
at orphanages. Although apartheid officially ended a decade
earlier. Mphande saw de facto segregation persisting, with
limited contact between blacks and whites. Still, she is up
beat.
"I see a big change happening," Mphande said, "It isn't as
segregated as it used to be."
In 2005, Mphande's eldest sister, Mulenga Mubiana, a pe
diatrician, advised her to continue her education in the Unit
ed States. Though she was a good student and felt a hunger
for continuing school. Mphande knew that leaving South
Africa would be neither easy nor cheap.
"It's a big mountain." she said of the visa process. "You go
through so much screening."
Though she had impressive grades, with her sister scrap
ing up the money to sponsor her. Mphande could only afford
community colleges. Las Positas College in Livermore.Calif,
responded fastest to her inquiries and fit her requirements
quite nicely: warm, inexpensive and helpful in getting a visa.
Things seemed to be falling into place for Mphande. She
arrived in Livermore in August 2005. living with another Las
Positas student in a shared apartment. Excelling in school,
she volunteered much of her time at elementary schools in
the area teaching African dance and tutoring kids.
But in May 2006, Mphande heard some troubling news.
I ler sister had contracted meningitis from her patients and
died suddenly.
"I thought that was the end of me," Mphande said. "She
was my source of income; there was no other way for me to
live in this country if it weren't for her."
To make things worse, Mphande was in the middle of
exams and didn't have the money to get a ticket home.
Growing up under apartheid, Mphande was surrounded
by people inhibiting her from advancing in life, so it wasn't
logical to hope for those around her to go out of their way to
help her now. But they did.
The children, parents and teachers of the elementary
school in Livermore collected money for Mphande to get a
flight back and go to her sister's funeral. The end result was
far above her hopes: Mphande could buy a round-trip ticket
and pay for the next two semesters at Las Positas.
"The same race that I grew up hating so much was gener
ously reaching out to me," she said. "It changed my life."
She came back from the funeral and encountered more
financial obstacles. She could no longer afford her rent but
was able to move in as a caretaker for Jim Heiner.a Las Posi
tas music professor with muscular dystrophy.
Feeling limited by her educational opportunities,
Mphande looked into transferring to a four-year college.
Berkeley was her first choice. She was initially intimidated
by the price tag of private schools, but. because of scholar
ship opportunities, she reconsidered.
"I looked at Santa Clara. Mills College, St. Mary's and
Stanford," she said. She knew of them only because they
were in the Bay Area.
Unfortunately, she only had enough money to apply to
one. For "no particular reason." she put all her eggs in one
basket: Stanford.
Mphande had $73. Stanford's application fee is $75. Hein
er lent her the other two.
"When I applied, I was telling everybody that it was a
matter of trial and error," she said. "If all went well, I told
them. I would scream at the top of my lungs."
When 3 p.m. came on May 15, 2007, Mphande was so
nervous that her entire body was shaking. After a delay in
the results, she finally saw the word "Congratulations." but
was in disbelief. After fellow students verified that she had
indeed been accepted, mayhem ensued.

'When they read it, the whole community
college was going crazy on my behalf," she said.
"I felt so deep and emotional that I wept in
stead. All along 1 was ignorant and didn't know
this place existed."

Not only had Mphande been accepted, she re
ceived a full scholarship. When she called home to
inform her family of the good news, her father react
ed in celebration by beating traditional drums "until

he got blisters on his hands."
After a summer of babysitting and volunteer
ing, Mphande finally moved into Kimball for
New Student Orientation.

"Even before 1 moved in, [transfer co
ordinator Sally Mentzer) made the
transition very smooth," Mphande

said. "She has really impacted my life
with everything she has done."

Although at one point in her
childhood Mphande vowed to
never make contact with a

white person in her whole life,
she has experienced an in
tense turnaround over the
years.

1 n the fall. South Africa
was facing the United
Kingdom in the rugby

World Cup in the fi
nals, and the Bechtel
International Cen-

ter held a viewing
event. Mphande
arrived and en
countered a few
white South
African gradu
ate students.

Fifteen years
ago, if she had met them

on the streets of South
Africa, any friendly interac
tion would have been unthink
able. At Stanford,she felt more
than comfortable greeting
them with a warm embrace.

"It was a turning point for
me," she said.

Now majoring in internation
al relations and psychology,
Mphande is busy but enjoying life

on the Farm. She is involved with Stan
ford STAND (Students Taking Action
Now: Darfur) and undergraduate re
search in psychology. When Mphande
gets homesick, she takes pleasure in
beating traditional drums and playing
familiar music.
"1 like to make a difference and to
reach out to any human being, be
cause I'm where I am today because
someone reached out to me." she said.
"I believe that Stanford will equip me
with skills and knowledge [to] help nie
reach out to other people on a broad
er platform."
