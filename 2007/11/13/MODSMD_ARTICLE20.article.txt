## QBs lead Heisman hunt again 
### 
This was supposed to be the "Year
of the Running Back" in college
football.
Arkansas' Darren McFadden was to
lead a highly contested race for the Heis
man, with West Virginia's Steve Slaton,
Rutgers' Ray Rice and Michigan's Mike
Hart in hot pursuit. Boise State's lan
Johnson was the dark horse candidate,
and everything was all but set: for only
the second time in the last eight years, a
running back would win college foot
ball's highest honor.
But almost overnight, quarterbacks
started overshadowing their backfield
counterparts. Hawaii's Colt Brennan —
one of the only quarterbacks given a
shot to win the Heisman at the beginning
of the year — along with Boston Col
lege's Matt Ryan, West Virginia's Pat
White, Florida's Tim Tebow and Ken
tucky's Andre Woodson, began to re
ceive more recognition than McFadden
& Co.
The reasons are fairly obvious: BC,
Kentucky and Hawaii stayed undefeat
ed while the running backs' schools all
lost early in the season. In six of the past
seven years, the Heisman has gone to a
player on a BCS Championship Game
bound team. Additionally, Johnson'sand
Hart's candidacies have been hurt by
their respective injuries, Slaton has re
gressed statistically, and Rice and Mc-
Fadden, despite having impressive rush
ing totals, play on mediocre teams.
The "Year of the Running Back" has
become just another "Year of the Quar
terback." But unlike many previous sea
sons, the contest is far from over. And
while little separates these specialists
from one another. Dennis Dixon, Ore
gon's senior quarterback, has emerged
from the pack to become the frontrun
ner in the race, a position he probably
won't relinquish.
Dixon, a former baseball player in the
Atlanta Braves farm system, is in his sec
ond year as the Ducks' full-time starter.
He's smart (Pac-10 All-Academic sec
ond-team) and well-built (6-foot-4. 205
pounds). He has a remarkably strong
arm and is very fast (4.5 seconds in the
40-yard dash) for an athlete his size.
Considered a bit immature earlier in his
collegiate career, his leadership skills are
now a strong suit.
But Dixon, much like his team, was an
afterthought until his performance
against Michigan in Week 2. Oregon re
ceived few preseason accolades and was
picked to finish in the middle of the Pac
-10. But. at the Big House against a fa
vored Michigan team. Dixon threw for
