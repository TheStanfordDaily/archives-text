# Polo wins a pair as end nears
## 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team picked up two crucial wins
over the weekend, beating No. 5 UC
lrvine on the road Saturday 8-6 and
then cruising past No. 15 Santa Clara
13-6 at Avery Aquatic Center on
Sunday.
The Cardinal's overall record im
proves to 15-6, and the squad is now
4-3 in Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) play. Stanford has
struggled to finally break the .500
mark in the MPSF, a crucial factor in
its quest for one of the four spots in
the NCAA Championships and a

shot at the national title.
"MPSF games are so important
because it's league play, which gives
us a much better opportunity to do
well in the MPSF tournament," soph
omore driver Sage Wright said. "And
that is our way to the NCAA Tourna
ment."
Stanford started off the weekend
with sophomore utility Janson
Wigo's four goals to spearhead the
attack against Irvine. Senior goal
keeper Sandy Hohener then held off
a second-half Anteater rally with 16
saves.
The Cardinal went up 4-1 before
halftime and kept the offensive pres
sure going into the second half.

Wright's goal with 5:55 left in the
game gave the Cardinal an 8-4 lead.
However, Irvine's Cole Bitter and
Colin Mello each delivered a goal in
the waning minutes to cut the lead
down to two goals. Stanford's sea
son-long emphasis on defense and
teamwork paid dividends, as the
Anteaters were stifled in the last
three minutes of the game, securing a
Cardinal victory.
"I think a big part of our game is
to press on defense," Janson Wigo
said. "We're known for our defense,
and we emphasize that a lot during
practice. Both teams have pretty
good shooters, so to win you need to
work on the counter attacks, the

small fundamental stuff, and play
solid defense."
Stanford also got goals from jun
ior utility Will Hindle-Katel, sopho
more two-meter attacker Ryan Mc-
Carthy and sophomore utility Drac
Wigo in the victory.
ITie Cardinal returned home on
Sunday to face Santa Clara and came
out on top with a 13-6 win. extending
its season-best winning streak to six
games. Hindle-Katel and Wright
came up huge offensively for the sec
ond straight day. both scoring three
goals. Senior two-meter attacker
Michael Bury and senior two-meter
defender Ryan Fortune contributed
two goals each to the effort.

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men won a pair
of matches this weekend, including an im
portant MPSF battle with UC-lrvine. The
Cardinal now has a 4-3 record in confer
ence play with one more match before the
MPSF Tournament next week. There, the
Cardinal will compete for a spot in the four
team NCAA Championships in December.

ITie game started with both teams
clamping down on defense. The first
quarter saw only one goal for Stan
ford while Santa Clara was held
scoreless. The second quarter fea
tured much more offensive output as
the Cardinal surged ahead with five
goals to Santa Clara's two to go into
halftime up 6-2.
Stanford built on its lead immedi
ately in the second half with five
goals in the third period. With the
score 11-5 going into the fourth quar
ter, Stanford never looked back,
scoring twice more to seal the win
with the defensive help of I lohener.
Fortune and senior two-meter de
fender Peter Finlayson. Finlayson
and junior driver Chris Jacobsen also
contributed goals on Sunday.
"We really focused more on the
tactical stuff." Wright said. "We real
ly didn't get to play like that last
weekend, so we need to play tactical
ly in order to win. The two-meter de
fenders did a great job, because they
do all the dirty work and mostly they
don't get a lot of credit. But overall,
we have to play each game and give it
100 percent effort and just focus on
team play."
Stanford will face off against No. 1
Cal next in what may be the team's
biggest game of the year. The Cardi
nal's regular season finale against the
Bears is scheduled for 7 p.m.. Friday
at Avery Aquatic Center.
