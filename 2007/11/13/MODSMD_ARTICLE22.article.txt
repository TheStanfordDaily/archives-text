# Two losses and no postseason for men's soccer
## Card loses to OSU, UW on the road 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
In its last regular season road trip
of the year, Stanford men's soccer
suffered back-to-back disappoint
ments in the Northwest, falling to
Oregon State and Washington this
weekend. On Friday, the Cardinal (6-
6-5, 3-4-2 Pacific-10) lost to the
Beavers (8-10-1,3-5-1) in a 1-0 deci
sion. Stanford couldn't rally against
Washington (8-7-2,3-4-1) either, los
ing 4-2.
The opening 45 minutes on Friday
saw only six total shots posted by the
teams, with the majority coming
from Oregon State — the Beavers
forced Stanford sophomore goal
keeper John Moore to save four at
tempts with four shots compared to
the Cardinal's two.
However, in the second period,
the Beavers finally struck, landing
the game's first goal. Freshman Mor
gan Zeeno received a pass from jun
ior Robby Christner in the 53rd
minute, which he netted from 17
yards out for his first career goal.
Stanford notched eight second-half
shots, but Beaver goalie Packy
Deenihan came up with three saves,
and OSU did not relinquish its lead.
Head coach Bret Simon credited
OSU's relentless defense for its abil
ity to frustrate Stanford throughout
the match.
"OSU decided to pressure us all
over the field, dumping balls in be
hind our defense and competing for
everything," Simon said. "That pres
sure took us out of any offensive
rhythm. We did have a couple of
clear chances in the first half, but
weren't able to convert.
"In the second half, we had three
one-on-ones with the OSU goal
keeper and couldn't score. We were
able to develop better opportunities
in the second half, but to no avail."
The match against Washington
was marked by a quicker offensive
pace. The Huskies got out to an early
lead, with freshman Ellis McLough
lin scoring in the 17th minute off a
pass from senior Ely Allen. Allen
found the net himself five minutes
later on a penalty kick as Washington
took a 2-0 advantage.
Stanford sophomore midfielder
Michael Strickland noted the diffi
culty in playing from behind early in
the game.
"[The Huskies'] goals put us back
on our heels when wc felt we had mo
mentum," Strickland said."lt was de
moralizing to be asserting [our

selves] as a team and then to give up
a goal."
Finally, in the 33rd minute, the
Cardinal put itself on the board when
freshman defender Shaun Culver
scored on an assist from classmate
Daniel Leon, a forward. Washington
still held a 2-1 lead at the break, even
though Stanford outshot the Huskies
8-4 in the first period.
The second half of play was much
the same — Allen scored again four
minutes after play's restart, and an
assist from Washington redshirt sen
ior Derek Crismier found freshman
Matt Van Houten only six minutes
later.
"We allowed ourselves to be vul
nerable to Washington's counter-at
tacking, and they really took advan
tage," Simon said. "Ely Allen played
a great game and is Washington's cat
alyst. We simply couldn't contain him
on the day."
Suddenly down 4-1, Stanford con
tinued its offensive effort, attempt
ing five shots in the second half, with
little luck.
"In the Washington game we at
tacked quite well," he said. "We had
lots of chances to score, hitting the
post early, missing a couple of great
opportunities and having a goal
called back in the second half."
Finally, redshirt sophomore mid
fielder Alex Kozachenko pulled
Stanford within two with a short
range shot at 79:26. Despite the
weekend's finish,and its implications
for another postseason-less year,
Strickland applauded his team
mates' offensive production.
"Sean and Alex scored two great
goals," he said. "Our offense is fairly
well-rounded, and goals are likely to
come from anywhere. In the Wash
ington game, Alex and Shaun put
away their chances very well when
we needed it.... Although the results
weren't so great, 1 felt our [whole]
team played well in spurts. Sadly, the
game is a constant endeavor."
Simon agreed that the matches
were defined by streaks.
"We had an interesting week
end," he observed. "We played quite
well at times, but our opponents
seemed to take advantage of every
miscue."
Stanford's season finale will come
at home against Cal at 7 p.m. on Sat
urday. After this past weekend's ac
tion, a Cardinal victory now carries
the weight of a winning season.

Junior midfielder and forward Tom Montgomery and the Stanford men could not find the net after falling behind this
past weekend. Oregon State shut the Cardinal out, 1 -0, and then Stanford scored twice but gave up four goals to the
University of Washington. The Cardinal will host California this weekend in the last game of the Pac-10 season.
