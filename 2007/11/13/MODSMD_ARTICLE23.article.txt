### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Donna Cronister. administrative
services manager for the Radiologi
cal Sciences Laboratory (RSL), was
honored at a reception last night as
this year's recipient of the Marsh
O'Neill Award. Associate Dean of
Research and Emeritus Chemistry
Prof. John Brauman presented the
award on behalf of Vice Provost and
Dean of Research Ann Arvin.
Since 1 WO. the Dean of Research
Office has given the Marsh O'Neill
Award annually to a staff member
who has provided exceptional sup
port for research at the University,
explained Ann George, assistant
dean of research and graduate policy.
A $3,000 prize accompanies the
award.
According to George, faculty
members submit nominations for the
award, and this year, Cronister re
ceived nominations from eight dif
ferent faculty members.
"From reading her nominations,"
George said, "it seems clear that
Donna has done an extraordinary
job managing a large research cen
ter."
This year's selection committee
included professors from the depart
ments of engineering, medicine and
humanities and sciences, as well as
former laboratory director Marsh
O'Neill, after whom the award is
named. O'Neill has served on the
committee every year since the
award's inception.
Cronister was surprised to find
that she was the winner of this year's
award.
"I work with so many great people
throughout the University, all of
whom are talented, dedicated and

hard working." she said. "It seems
that everybody at Stanford works at
such a frenetic pace to get things
done. 1 feel so honored that eight fac
ulty members took the time in their
busy schedules to write letters of sup
port."
Cronister, who has worked in the
RSL since the lab opened in 1990,
manages the administrative side of
the laboratory. She is also the admin
istrative manager for the magnetic
resonance imaging service center
housed in the Richard M. Lucas Cen
ter for Imaging.
According to many of Cronister's
colleagues, however, her official title
does not adequately represent her
role at the University.
"Donna's commitment to the De
partment of Radiology, to Stanford
and to all researchers from tenured
professor to graduate student makes
her a role model for all of us," said
Anne Marie Sawyer, manager of the
MR Whole Body Research Systems
at RSL.'The knowledge and wisdom
that she possesses due to her diligent
undertaking makes her a most valu
able resource for our department."
"We would be in big jeopardy
without her." added Roland Bam
mer, assistant professor of research
at RSL. "1 hope she will never retire
or otherwise we'll be in big limbo.
She is basically the glue of the lab
and takes care of so many things we
become only aware of if she is on va
cation or out sick and realize how
many balls she has to juggle to make
the lab run so smoothly."
Luckily for Bammer, Cronister
sounds as though she has no plans of
leaving any time soon.
"Being recognized and appreciat
ed for the work one does is truly a
warm feeling," she said, "and just
makes you want to knuckle down
and do more."
