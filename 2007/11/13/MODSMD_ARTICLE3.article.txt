# Two alums pitch CoHo replacement
## New "MoJo" would replicate atmosphere, style of departed coffee house 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
A proposal to fill the now
empty CoHo space in Tres
sider Union could provide
solace for students dissat
isfied with the coffee
shop's absence.

Former classmates
Jesse Sandoval B.A. '03.
M.A. '04 and Anthony
Gupta '04 are presenting
University administra
tors with plans for 4
"MoJo." an updated I
version of the former \
CoHo.

Stanford shut down
the CoHo at the end of
the summer in order to
"make space" for the
newly opened Axe & Palm
at Old Union, according to
Associate Vice Provost
Shirley Everett. The deci
sion came on the recom
mendation of outside con-

sultants Envision Strategies,
who called Tresidder and Old
Union a "heavily saturated" area
for eateries and cafes.
In a statement, Everett said that she
was "not aware of any concrete plans
for the space previously occupied by the

CoHo." hut that she "wholeheartedly recommends that it revert to
flexible space for student programs."
Sandoval and Gupta hope to revive that space in the spirit of the
CoHo.
"A place like the CoHo is a part of the college experience." San
doval said. "It's something you'll remember. Ourselves, we have im
portant links to the CoHo. We think it's something central for the un
dergraduates."
"Stanford is a 20.000-person city," Gupta added."And in a city.you
need to have options."
In a prospectus of their plan, Sandoval and Gupta proposed a
menu to include "raspberry kiss" mocha drinks, "javalicious" milk
shakes and an assortment of paninis. Crepes, the CoHo favorite con
spicuously missing from the Axe & Palm, are not on their proposed

menu.
"We want to provide a place
with great food, a place to study, go
on a date, have drinks, perform —
and be up until 3 a.m.," Sandoval
said. "And no one can replicate that
kind of atmosphere unless they
care."
Gupta agreed that the pair's goal
is to retain the CoHo's unique at
mosphere.
"We want to preserve the CoHo
and add energy," he said. "So we're
going to call it the MoJo."
The duo hopes to utilize past ex
periences in the restaurant business
to accomplish this goal.
"Since graduating. I've worked
in food and beverage for the past
three years," said Sandoval, who
has worked as a consultant for Fiji

Water in Los Angeles.
Gupta — who took a leave of
absence from Stanford to work and
will graduate this academic year
has run a modest California pizza
chain, "with 15 locations every
where from Los Santos to Oakland
to San Francisco," he said.
The two believe that what sets
them and their proposal apart is
their dedication to the project.
"There's a difference between
an establishment coming from the
University and something done pri
vately," Gupta said. "It's not about
money. You need special atten
tion."
"The MoJo is well positioned to
be an integral part of the student's
university life," Sandoval and
Gupta wrote in their prospectus.
"We aspire to build a community
within the Stanford campus
through quality food, home-grown
entertainment and a uniquely Stan
ford experience. As young alumni,
the management team is uniquely

positioned to assess and address the
evolving needs of the student
body."
At the prospect of Sandoval and
Gupta's plan, former Collo lovers
were enthusiastic.
"I think their proposal is great."
said Philip Arredondo "10. who
founded the Facebook group
"Bring Back the Collo." which had
605 members as of press time. "It's
approaching what the CoHo was
and what it stood for."
"While the Axe & Palm is a good
space, it lacks the more grungy,
semi-urban character that the
CoHo had," said History Prof.
Philippe Buc."The CoHo felt like a
real cafe. While comfortable. Axe &
Palm is sanitized."
Mostly, students want the new
establishment to resemble the
CoHo as closely as possible.
"1 would honestly like to see the
same exact CoHo put back where
it was." said Adam Hudson '10.
"Seeing that this may be unlikelv. 1

would like to see something simi
lar to the CoHo put there. Some
thing with a relaxed, coffee-drink
ing environment to chill.study and
hang out with your friends. Any
thing that can replace the feeling
of the CoHo would be fine with
me."
"I don't know anyone who
wanted the CoHo gone," said Katie
Hansen '07. "Mostly, 1 just miss it."
Students voiced their agree
ment with Sandoval and Gupta's
goal of bringing the Stanford com
munity into the decision-making
process.
" The specifics of [any new es
tablishment] should be the domain
the people who are going to use the
space," said Alex Loewi '09.
"We just want the students to
have a say," Gupta said. "Whatev
er it takes, let's bring the CoHo
back."
