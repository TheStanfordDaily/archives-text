### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
A proposal to fill the now
empty CoHo space in Tres
sider Union could provide
solace for students dissat
isfied with the coffee
shop's absence.

Former classmates
Jesse Sandoval B.A. '03.
M.A. '04 and Anthony
Gupta '04 are presenting
University administra
tors with plans for 4
"MoJo." an updated I
version of the former \
CoHo.

Stanford shut down
the CoHo at the end of
the summer in order to
"make space" for the
newly opened Axe & Palm
at Old Union, according to
Associate Vice Provost
Shirley Everett. The deci
sion came on the recom
mendation of outside con-

sultants Envision Strategies,
who called Tresidder and Old
Union a "heavily saturated" area
for eateries and cafes.
In a statement, Everett said that she
was "not aware of any concrete plans
for the space previously occupied by the

CoHo." hut that she "wholeheartedly recommends that it revert to
flexible space for student programs."
Sandoval and Gupta hope to revive that space in the spirit of the
CoHo.
"A place like the CoHo is a part of the college experience." San
doval said. "It's something you'll remember. Ourselves, we have im
portant links to the CoHo. We think it's something central for the un
dergraduates."
"Stanford is a 20.000-person city," Gupta added."And in a city.you
need to have options."
In a prospectus of their plan, Sandoval and Gupta proposed a
menu to include "raspberry kiss" mocha drinks, "javalicious" milk
shakes and an assortment of paninis. Crepes, the CoHo favorite con
spicuously missing from the Axe & Palm, are not on their proposed
