### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen and
his wife Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, a Gradu
ate School of Business professor, pledged $27.5
million to Stanford Hospital last Friday to
build a brand new emergency room (ER).
With the donation, Stanford Hospital will
be able to double the size of its current ER and
install state of the art technology, including car
diac monitors and advanced ultrasound equip
ment in the facility, according to a statement

released by the hospital.
The couple's gift will also fund the purchase of
communication systems to allow doctors to
track patients as they move through the emer
gency department, according to the San Jose
Mercury News, in addition to creating new
staffing programs to improve customer service
and allowing nurses to follow up with dis
charged patients, among other features.
In a press interview on Friday, Arrillaga-An
dreessen ' l ) 2. M.B.A. >l ) 7, MA. '98, M.A. l > l >.
daughter of real estate developer and Stanford
benefactor John Arrillaga '60, revealed the
couple's motives for choosing to concentrate
their money in F.R construction.
"We wanted to do something that would
have a profound impact on as many
people as possible who are a part of
this community or traveling
through," she said. "Emergency

services are traditionally one of the
most under-funded divisions of the
hospital, but provide life-saving op
portunities.
"The current emergency room
was built in l l )74." she added. "It
was designed to handle less than
half of the volume of patients it re
ceives now."
Paul Auerbach. director of spe

cial projects for ER medicine, con
firmed the need to re-vamp the cur
rent status of the Stanford ER.
"The gift will enable the emer
gency room to handle many more
patients," he said on Friday. "The
emergency room now gets so full it
has to refuse ambulances and all
visitors except trauma patients for
an hour or more."

Construction on the new ER is
scheduled to begin in 2010.
This is the first philanthropic en
deavor that Marc Andreessen and
Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen have
undertaken together since the cou
ple married in 2006.
