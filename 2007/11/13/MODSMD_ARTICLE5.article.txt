### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
With its fast-paced growth. China is the talk of the
town in the economic sector, and central to China's devel
opment is Hong Kong, a city considered to be a liaison of
sorts between China and the Western world.
Capitalizing on Hong Kong's importance, the Center
for East Asian Studies (CEAS) and Hong Kong Student
Association (HKSA) hosted a symposium yesterday en
titled "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR)'s First Decade: Retrospect and Prospects."
The symposium honored the 10-year anniversary of the

transfer of sovereignty of Hong
Kong from Great Britain to the Peo
ple's Republic of China.
Among the panelists were many
influential figures in Hong Kong.
"We invited a very full and di
verse panel of speakers," said HKSA
president Jeff Sze '08, a statistics
coterminal student who organized
the panel along with Hoover Re
search Fellow Ming Chan. "We had
representatives from the business
sector with Mr. Ronnie Chan and
Edward Chen, the U.S. Consul Gen
eral and Ambassador James Cun
ningham, HKSAR legislator Mar
garet Ng, media professor Tuen-Yu
Lau, law professor Wang Zhenmin
and policy expert Shiu Sin-por."
About 50 professors and students
attended the day-long event.
"I came because 1 have relations
to Hong Kong and I think it is an im
portant city," said Patrick Lui.a staff

member at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
"I think this was an interesting op
portunity to hear other panelists'
viewpoints," Cunningham said. "This
is the first time that I was invited by
a university and not an association or
chamber of commerce to speak
about Hong Kong."
Topics covered at the symposium
delved into many areas of current af
fairs in the city, including the prolif
eration of business-driven sensation
al journalism, political reform and
economic development.
Throughout the seven-hour sym
posium, a fundamental disagree
ment among the panelists surfaced
over the current and future viability
of the "one country, two systems"
policy in Hong Kong. The policy is in
place to ensure Hong Kong's politi
cal autonomy even as it remains a
part of China.
"There are basically two oppos
ing perspectives on Hong Kong's
current state,"said Larry Diamond,a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. "First, that Hong Kong is well
managed but must progress towards

democracy and universal suffrage.
Second, the Beijing opinion that
I long Kong is not ready for universal
suffrage or a political move towards
democracy."
While panelists each brought
their own opinions to the table. Cun
ningham articulated the American
policy toward Hong Kong.
"You can't have stability and
growth over time without strong and
legitimate governance," he said. "A
move towards political reform and
universal suffrage is necessary for
Hong Kong. We hope China can un
derstand."
When asked about the relation
ship between the U.S.. Hong Kong
and Chinese governments, Cunning
ham emphasized America's separate
relationships with Hong Kong and
the People's Republic of China.
"1 report to Washington, not to
Beijing," he said. "As a country, the
U.S. treats Hong Kong as a distinct
entity"
