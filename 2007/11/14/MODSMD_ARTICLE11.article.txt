## November 14,1978: Sen. Biden urges Stanford to march against apartheid 
### 
White South Africans are held in
power by a "(Jeep-seated belief that
the United States would save them
if things started to fall apart" Sen.
Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said in a
speech before 75 people in Kresge
Auditorium last night.
The United States must demon
strate that it is "not willing to be the
accomplice of the white minority in
South Africa," Biden said.
Otherwise, the member of the
Foreign Relations Committee pre
dicted. a major upheaval would
occur in the area in the next five
years.
Although American policy to
wards South Africa is no longer the
"benign neglect," of the Nixon ad
ministration, there is a lot more the

United States can do. he said.
"The view that South Africa is
immovable has not been borne out
by evidence," Biden said, citing
cases in which the country was
forced to adapt to survive. South
Africa agreed to withdraw from
Namibia following external pres
sue.
International sanctions would
undoubtedly hurt the South
African government, he said, al
though he does not favor such sanc
tions at this time.
Instead, Biden suggested the
U.S. government adopt a policy of
"active discouragement," endorsing
fair labor codes and tightening the
flow of capital from this country to
South Africa.
Biden urged students to "lobby
and to write and to march" to
counter advertising by the South
African government, which he said
presents only the best side of South
Africa to the American public.
