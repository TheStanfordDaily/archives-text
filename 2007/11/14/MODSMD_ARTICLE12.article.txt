## New name in social networking 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Two months ago, a new contender
entered the social networking ring
currently dominated by Web giants
Facebook and Myspace.
College.com. "the social and aca
demic networking site for college
students only." launched nationally
on Sept. 25 and has gained substan
tial popularity in its first two months.
"We have only been running shy
of a few months, but we already have
15,000 users," said Whittney Laws,
public relations manager for the new
site. "We usually have 300 to 400 new
users per day, and we get a lot of
viewer traffic as well."
According to the site's founder
and president Jon Davidman. Col
lege.com is entirely different from
other popular social networking
sites.
"When Facebook alienated their
core user, the college student, and
opened up their network, we saw this
as a huge opportunity to provide a
secure online social environment for
college students," Davidman wrote
in an email to The Daily. "The advan
tage of College.com over other on
line communities is our focus. We are
1 (K) percent focused on college stu
dents. College.com is a one-stop shop
for information and communication
between students."
In order to login to the site, a
member must provide a valid email
address ending in ".edu."
College.com then verifies the ad
dress and domain name before the
member can log in.
The privacy provided by limiting
membership to college students and
professors is touted as the site's pri
mary advantage over other social
networking platforms.
"Facebook and Myspace want to
be everything to everybody," David
man wrote. "We want to be every
thing to the college student. We want
students to register and immediately
feel in the loop of life at their school
and not worry about employers and
parents invading their privacy."
Although both students and pro
fessors can use the site, the two
groups are separated by different

networks.
"When professors login they see a
completely different screen," Laws
said. "They are on a separate net
work and cannot view anything on
your page."
Features of College.com include
academic elements, which, according
to Davidman. "will enhance mem
bers' overall college experience by

simplifying their lives and connect
ing them to their campus."
"Our academic section is com
prised of a classroom portal that al
lows students to join their 'virtual'
class," Davidman said. "It lists their
professors and also provides profes
sor ratings and reviews. Our applica
tion allows students to create notes
and flash cards to share with others
in their class."
The site also incorporates strin
gent privacy settings to preserve its
image as an intimate social network.
"As opposed to the set-up on
Facebook, where you have to set
your profile to private, you are auto
matically set to private [on
College.com]," Laws said. "No one
can see or view any of your pictures
or blogs unless they are a friend of
yours."

"Users love the photo section."
Davidman added. "We built a fea
ture that easily allows users to import
their Facebook photos over to our
site, or use our easy photo up-loader
to add hundreds of photos at a time.
A lot of students have been import
ing their photo albums because they
know they are secure on our site,
where they don't have to worry
about employers looking at them."
According to Laws, College.com
is not meant to be a replacement for
social networking sites currently in
use.
"I'm sure people will still use their
other networks, just like some use
both Facebook and Myspace," he
said. "[College.com] is just more in
tricate for college academics, and we
want to be another place where stu
dents need and want to go to net
work with their friends and groups."
I"he site, which recently opened to
Stanford email addresses, faces
mixed opinions from students.
"It's going to be like what Google
Video was to You l Ã¼be," said Barry
Burns '09. "[College.com] is a new
community trying to compete with
an already outstanding social com
munity, and even though it might
have better features, the first com
munity is simply set in us."
Anna Schapiro'o9 agreed that the
new site is up against some stiff com
petition.
"The problem with social net
working sites is that they need a lot of
people in order to make it work," she
said. "People are already on Face
book, and that's working fine. 1 don't
think enough people will switch to
make it work."
"1 don't think I'll start using it. at
least not now," added Tina Cardaci
'09.
Vasant Ramachandran '11 was
open-minded.
"1 would probably consider using
both." he said. "[College.com] looks
pretty cool, especially when choosing
classes and professors as an upper
classman becomes more important.
It could help you to become more
aware of what's going on."
