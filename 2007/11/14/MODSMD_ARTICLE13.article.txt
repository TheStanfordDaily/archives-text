## Editorial Board Green is the new black 
### 
Last Thursday night. David Schwimmer
and Al Gore made guest appearances
on NBC's new and acclaimed comedy
"30 Rock" in an episode about environmen
talism. In an arresting moment of small
screen juxtaposition, a recent Nobel Prize
winning politician appeared opposite a star
from "Friends," the comedy show that once
dominated primetime. Environmental is
sues are evidently exempt from the rule of
jest dictating that no problem is funny until
it has been resolved and long moot (e.g. the
War of 1812 can be funny; the War on Terror
cannot). Although global climate change
and the associated concerns are more wor
rying than ever, pop culture is ready to
laugh. This levity, however, is no cause for
concern. It is evidence that a new phenome
non is slowly seducing our society: America
is listening eagerly to the siren song of the
environment.
An issue with a sense of humor is rare,
but the green movement's newfound groove
could ultimately prove to be pivotal. Tesla
Motors provides a stellar example of how
going green doesn't mean going slow; the
company's entirely electric sports car has a
body that a supermodel would envy while
accelerating from 0 to bO in four seconds.
ITie roadster, still in the early stages of pro
duction, has been pre-ordered by a number
of celebrities, including George C'looney
and Michael 'Flea' Balzary of the Red Hot
Chili Peppers. Even beyond Silicon Valley,
green is still the new black; the September
issue of Vogue showed models posing in the
latest runway fashion with windmills, solar
panels, and the most of-the-moment hand
bag: the recyclable grocery tote.
At Stanford, our green track record isn't
perfect.The biodegradable disposable uten
sils that Tresidder Union advertised enthusi
astically at the beginning of the year were
nowhere to be found just recently as plastic

utensils took their place. The chipper,
bright-blue recycling bins in every dorm
room become overflow trash cans. Profes
sors sometimes provide single-sided hand
outs, perhaps because many of the older
campus copiers, such as the ones in Green
Library, make double-sided copying diffi
cult or impossible. Even those who drive a
Prius or at least a small sedan may forget
that driving frequently in a fuel-efficient car
is no better than driving rarely in a gas-guz
zlingSUV.
But environmentalist! in 2007 is hotter
than the Sahara will be in A.D. 2057, and in
many ways, Stanford is indeed leading the
charge. Our dorms have green councils of
fering to swap old light bulbs for compact
fluorescent lamps. While the blue recycling
bins may be occasionally abused, nearly
every room has them. The new Environ
ment and Energy Building, currently under
construction, will be eco-friendly.and anen
vironment-themed dorm is planned for the
future. Even Tresidder Union has caught up
with the composting trend that is now com
mon in many non-University-run campus
kitchens.
Perhaps both on and off campus, previ
ously uninterested people will notice envi
ronmentalism's new image as something
funny, attractive, and worth inviting to the
next cocktail party. While slapping some sex
appeal on a concept is an old marketing
strategy, even the staunchest opponents of
such shallow tactics can be consoled by the
impact this will have on converting apathet
ic individuals to caring about the environ
ment. The issue has already become part of
the cultural lexicon for some, and this influ
ence will, one hopes, continue to spread.
Stanford students and faculty are highly-ed
ucated individuals in an ecologically-con-

scious area of the country — if our
selective subset still have yet to take
the sustainability issue to heart, it
suggests that the awareness is worse
in less wealthy and educated parts of
the country. If a new image for envi
ronmentalism makes the issues
more accessible and more appeal
ing, even old-school environmental
ists must accept its positive effect on
awareness.
Like the female protagonist in a
makeover movie, the environmen
tal movement has transformed it
self before our eyes from gawky and
sidelined to sleek and chic with all
the right moves. Because climate
change, pollution, species extinc
tion and the other malaises of the
current world are serious issues, en

vironmentalism cannot always be
sexy. There is nothing glamorous
about last Wednesday's oil spill in
the San Francisco Bay. It will not be
pretty for anyone who sees the po
litical wrangling that will have to go
on before Congress can seriously
consider something like raising the
gas tax. Even small individual ef
forts at helping might not feel so hot
when biking instead of driving on a
cold night leaves your nose cold and
blue.
We're past the days of consider
ing environmentalism an exclusive
issue of granola-crunchers from the
Pacific Northwest. The planet's
problems affect everyone; so much
the better if the concerns begin to
appeal to everyone. So wave at
Schwarzenegger as he drives by in
his Tesla on his way to lobby the
EPA to enforce the Clean Air Act.
Know that you look just as good in
green as anyone — try some on for
yourself.
