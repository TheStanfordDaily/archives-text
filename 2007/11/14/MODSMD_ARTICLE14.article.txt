## Ron Paul is insane 
### 
Flyers for the Republican presidential
candidate from Texas, Ron Paul, peri
odically cover campus, asking us "Who
is Ron Paul?" and making it seem like the ar
dent pro-life anti-immigrationist is the sec
ond coming of the I%o's. After reading
about Ron Paul's record-breaking fundrais
ing day a couple of weeks ago, then seeing it
touted in a recent Daily op-ed. I was con
cerned. Paul and his views lie on the fringe;
it's never a good sign for social stability when
fringe candidates get so much support.
Then, after thinking about how Mike
Gravel, D-Alaska, was actually at some of
the early Democratic debates, and how Den
nis "1 want to try to impeach Cheney and
make the Democrats lose in 2008" Kucinich,
D-Ohio, is running yet again, I was less wor
ried. The Democrats have their share of
loonies as well. 'ITie Republicans, for their
part, have a long tradition of quixotic cam
paigns from fundamentalist types. Isolation
ist xenophobe Pat Buchanan made a serious
grab for the Republican nomination in 1996.
Best of all, Pat "God speaks through me"
Robertson, R-Va., captured 9 percent of the
vote at the 1992 lowa caucuses.
We think of the nominating processes as
well-funded Senators and governors pander
ing to farmers and local legislators drunk
with power for their endorsement. But there
has always been room for fringe candidates.
Ron Paul is no different, but he has one
advantage that he's leveraged extensively:
the Internet. His videos, with 5.9 million
views, are tops among Republicans. Romney,
R-Mass.,is second with just 2.58 million. Paul
has about 82.000 MySpace friends.compared
to just 38.(XX) for John McCain. R-Ariz... who
is second. Ibis is for a man who is polling just
2.7 percent in recent aggregate polling, ac
cording to Pollster.com. His supporters (as
Wonkette calls them, "Paultards") swarm
any blog posting or news article about him
and dominate the comments. My article last
week about Barack Obama. D-111., which did
not mention Paul at all. still had several com
ments supporting Paul.They will likely com
ment excessively on this piece as well.
The Internet allows him to have a much
more active campaign than he would've had
otherwise. He would best be advised to re
member the 2004 candidacy of Howard
Dean, D-Vt.. which also broke fundraising
records before spectacularly imploding in
lowa. Until Paul can get significant support
on the ground and a real organization, all
that Internet money will translate into noth
ing.
Ron Paul's views are a contradictory
hodgepodge of conservative and libertarian
positions. He opposed the Iraq War but sup
ported Afghanistan. He's strongly pro-life
but vaguely pro-gay-marriage. It seems that
he wants to withdraw from most internation

al organizations, including the WTO and the
U.N. Despite being "free trade," he opposes
NAFTA, CAFTA and every other free trade
agreement the U.S. has signed. He is anti-tax,
anti-government spending and wishes to re
turn to the gold standard. Paul distrusts the
Federal Reserve, blaming it for causing infla
tion. His view of the separation church and
state is worrisome, arguing that a "rigid sepa
ration...has no basis." What is most concern
ing is that he's content to let genocide, wars
of aggression, and human rights violations
occur abroad with nothing more than a
"moral statement" from the U.S.
Paul seems to have struck a nerve
amongst a certain voting bloc: disaffected
young white males wanting to stick it to the
Man, even at Stanford.This generation's bur
geoning, so-called "libertarianism" seems to
have found an outlet in Paul's candidacy. But
what, really, are these men (and women) re
volting against? His massive fundraiser was
styled as a modern-day equivalent to Guy
Fawkes, the legendary would-be suicide
bomber of British Parliament who was over
shadowed by Natalie Portman in "V for
Vendetta." It's clear that Paul would take
away many of the institutions and values that
have brought the United States to where it is
today, and it's unclear whether his own sup
porters really want to see a Ron Paullian
dystopia.
It seems that his views share a similar
thread with the other fringe candidates from
recent presidential elections: they reject,
largely, what America is today. Kucinich
wants to abdicate American leadership in the
world, which may at times require the use of
military force. Buchanan wants to seal the
U.S. off from any external influence. Robert
son wants to regress on two centuries of sec
ularism and make the U.S. a Christian ver
sion of Iran. Paul is in some way all of these
things, and in doing so, wants to go back to an
earlier idea of the U.S. that never really exist
ed. For two centuries, the United States has
prospered by being a secular, welcoming, in
ternationally engaged country, supportive of
allies abroad like Japan and Britain. What
our allies fear even more than American uni
lateral aggression (which Paul detests) is
America turning inward. And our economic
prosperity is dependent on free markets and
modern central bank policy.The mainstream

candidates, on the other hand, seem
to think we're generally on the right
course, with some modifications.
Postwar America has worked pretty
well so far, and Paul hasn't given us a
clear reason to change.

Stuart is grunting Yulia Tymoshenkoa
break this week from byline refer
ences. Maybe Natalie Portnum should
run for President. That would be
something. Send him your best Natal
