# The 						Lowly Interns
## The 						ultimate bribe 
### 
Pretend, for a moment, that you are one
of today's African dictators. Life is
good. After more than a decade in
power,you've secreted away enough govern
ment money to buy several houses on the
French Riviera, two flats in London, and one
luxury condo in Boston. Boston is nice.
Your family drives around in cars that
cost more to fuel per liter of gas than what
most of your countrymen earn in a week.
Thanks to some supplementary "gifts from
friends," these vehicles, usually monstrous
SUVs, have all the necessary features: plush
leather, subwoofers, and those cool video
screens with touch sensitivity. Yes, African
satellite cable does play Pimp My Ride. More
importantly, everything is bulletproof, to
guard against that constant but strangely
mysterious security threat. Of course, securi
ty also necessitates buying three more identi
cal vehicles for your bodyguards. This really
is a vital security measure so would-be assas
sins can't tell where the President is riding.
Besides, bodyguarding is boring. They need
the video screens too.
The national treasury is your plaything.
Your personal residence has a higher annual
budget than many ministries. After all, why
would the Department of Agriculture need

computers? Or electricity? It's far more im
portant to keep up appearances at home.
Wouldn't want that uppity guy in the next
country over thinking you're uncultured
when he visits the presidential mansion.
You can appoint all of your friends to
snazzy government positions replete with of
ficial cars and Western salaries. In Uganda for
instance, there are 114 "presidential advisers,"
and this does not count actual cabinet minis
ters or administrative staff. Western develop
ment agencies talk tough about corruption
and patronage, but they still provide most of
the funding that lets you run wild. Elections
may or may not be held, but they're mostly a
formality. With everything going for you, why
would leaving office ever be desirable?
Enter Mohamed "Mo" Ibrahim. Ibrahim
was born in Sudan, educated in Egypt, and
made millions working in the telecommuni

cations industry in the U.K. After essentially
retiring, he decided to help start a cell phone
company in Africa, a dicey prospect most big
companies were avoiding. He could afford
the risk, and saw mobile phones as a way to
encourage development. His company, Cel
tel, now has 20 million subscribers in over 15
countries, and was recently sold to a Kuwaiti
company for $3.4 billion. Still interested in
finding a way to help, Ibrahim started a foun
dation, funded solely from his own pocket,
with the goal of encouraging better leader
ship and development in Africa.
On October 22, the first Mo Ibrahim Prize
for African Leadership was awarded to for
mer president of Mozambique, Joaquim
Chissano, who deftly helped his country
emerge from civil war. Who cares, you ask,
aren't there tons of random awards all over
the place? Not like this one. The Ibrahim
award consists of a $5 million payment over
ten years, with an additional $200,000 per
year for the rest of your life. ITiis may not
sound like much in the land of Silicon Valley
startups and hedge fund exorbitance, but to
put it in perspective, the touted Nobel Prize
comes with an award of $1.3 million, period.

The catch is that only former
heads of state from Sub-Saharan
Africa are eligible. And they're only
eligible once they retire. The not-so
subtle hint is that in a region where
leaders tend to hang on at all costs,
those who govern well and step
down could receive a hefty reward.
Winners are picked from a group of
eligible ex-leaders based on the
quality of their leadership and con
tribution to their countries. Without
a doubt, the admirable ideal of the
Ibrahim prize promotes good, re
sponsible governance.
But it also faces some tough
challenges in actually affecting the
quality of rule. There are ten
African leaders who have been in
power for more than 20 years, and
most have awful human rights

records. They're all locks for not
winning the Ibrahim prize, so the
award represents very little incen
tive for improved governance and is
unlikely to dislodge anyone in
today's dictator club.
Another question is: Will it be
enough? Sadly, $5 million is a pit
tance compared to what some lead
ers have stolen in the past. Congo's
Mobutu Sese Seko, for example, has
stolen $35 billion. 1 asked my friend
Andrew Mwenda, a Ugandan jour
nalist and a crusader against corrup
tion, what he thought about
Ibrahim's idea.
"It cannot stop a demented dicta
tor from continuing to pillage his
country," he said. "Five million is too
small. However,as a reward for good
behavior, it is a good gesture."
I hope it works.
