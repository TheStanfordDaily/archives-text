## What does 'no war in Iran' mean? 
### 
The latest obsession of protesters at
Stanford — or whatever we're sup
posed to call the student group that
roams around campus from demonstration to
demonstration — is stopping the impending
"war in Iran." For them it's a win-win sce
nario: If there's no war, they get credit for
stopping it; if there is a war, they warned us
and we should listen to them next time. But
there's one question they can't answer with
any degree of precision: What's a war?
For one thing, we don't need to worry
about a full-scale invasion. We can't even sus
tain the "surge" of additional troops in Iraq

beyond the summer of 2008. much less invade
Iran — a country almost four times as large
that boasts a population double that of Iraq,
to say nothing of its more guerrilla-friendly
mountainous terrain. Opposing an assault of
this magnitude makes perfect sense; after all.
it would be impossible.
Opposing airstrikes is as reasonable as op
posing a ground invasion. There could be a
massive bombing campaign on par with the
"shock and awe"spectacle that opened up the
2003 war in Iraq. However, Hoover Fellow
Kori Schake wrote in Policy Review earlier
this year that this campaign would "likely be

of extended duration, requiring politically
costly support from regional allies and incur
ring substantial civilian casualties."
Or a "war" could be of a more surgical na
ture, targeting critical facilities with the goal
of delaying Tehran's acquisition of nuclear
weapons. This latter approach would be rem
iniscent of Israel's assault on Saddam Hus
sein's nuclear reactor, Osirak, in 1981. But
Stanford Prof. Abbas Milani wrote in the San
Francisco Chronicle last year that an attack
would "strengthen the radical elements with-
in the regime" and "eradicate" the
democracy movement in the country.
Covert operations would likely have
similar consequences because they
would not be likely to remain covert
for long.
Which of these options do the
protesters oppose — the unfeasible
invasion, the impractical air cam
paign or the sexy (but probably
counterproductive) special opera
tions? Which of these would consti
tute a "war" — any or all of them?
Details such as these may bore
them, but it is the details that matter.
If they paid attention to details, for
example, student protesters would

know that Iran has fomented vio
lence in Iraq since 2(X)3. providing
funding, training and weapons to in
surgents and militias.
Iranian-assisted "special groups"
have been responsible for kidnapping
and assassinating Iraqi officials who
are struggling to bring stability Many
Iranian agents have been captured in
Iraq and Iranian-produced explosives
reportedly have killed nearly 2(X)
Coalition troops.
No war in Iran. Fair enough. How
about Iran's war against us in Iraq?
