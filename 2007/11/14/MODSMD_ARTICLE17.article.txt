## What does 'no war in Iran' mean? 
### 
The latest obsession of protesters at
Stanford — or whatever we're sup
posed to call the student group that
roams around campus from demonstration to
demonstration — is stopping the impending
"war in Iran." For them it's a win-win sce
nario: If there's no war, they get credit for
stopping it; if there is a war, they warned us
and we should listen to them next time. But

Iran — a country almost four times as large
that boasts a population double that of Iraq,

it would be impossible.
Opposing airstrikes is as reasonable as op
posing a ground invasion. There could be a
massive bombing campaign on par with the
"shock and awe"spectacle that opened up the
2003 war in Iraq. However, Hoover Fellow
Kori Schake wrote in Policy Review earlier
this year that this campaign would "likely be

of extended duration, requiring politically
costly support from regional allies and incur

Or a "war" could be of a more surgical na
ture, targeting critical facilities with the goal
of delaying Tehran's acquisition of nuclear
weapons. This latter approach would be rem
iniscent of Israel's assault on Saddam Hus
sein's nuclear reactor, Osirak, in 1981. But
Stanford Prof. Abbas Milani wrote in the San
Francisco Chronicle last year that an attack
