## Teresa McWalters Cross Country A 						perfect finish 
### BY JACK SALISBURY 
tanford's No. 1 women's cross coun

national title in less than a week

ana for the NCAA Championships.
Like most championship-caliber teams, the
Cardinal couldn't have made it this far with
out the leadership of its experienced team
members.
The importance of the team's seniors was
more than apparent at last weekend's
NCAA West Regionals when Teresa McWal
ters. Arianna Lambie and team captain Lau
ren Centrowitz finished first, second and
fourth respectively for the dominant
women's squad. More than any of the other
seniors' performances, however, McWalters
showing last Saturday set her apart.
McWalters clocked in with the only sub
-20 minute time of the race, capturing the in
dividual crown with her mark of l l ):57.3().
"It felt pretty nice." McWalters said. "The
whole race was challenging. I was pressing
the whole way. It dawned on me when 1 came
up to the finish and there was no one in front
of me." I was like, OK, there it is."'
The San Francisco native was an integral

member of Stanford's last two national
championship teams, running in the team's
top five during both national title campaigns.
With this year's championship just five days
away, the senior is confident that the Cardi
nal will be able to make program history in
taking home its third title.
"We have a very seasoned team," she said.
"We've defended our title twice and that is a
huge hurdle to overcome. It's always a chal
lenge coming in with a target on your back."
Ultimately, however, whether or not Stan
ford brings home a third straight champi
onship is of little importance to McWalters.
"Coming back this year, and seeing the
evolution of this team as it's been the last
four years has given me the most pleasure —
more, I think, than winning the title," McWal
ters explained. "This experience has been so
amazing — just laughing, joking and smiling
with my teammates and enjoying every step
of the way and taking nothing for granted.
Winning the championship is a proof of what
a wonderful experience we've had. If it's
meant to be, it'll happen. But it's just icing on
the cake, you know."
Ihings are going just as well off the track
for the fifth-year senior who graduated with
a degree in Art 1 listory and a minor in Archi
tectural Design. McWalters decided to come

back for a fifth year in order to dedicate
herself to running, and she doesn't regret
the decision at all.
"I'm excited to devote this whole year
to running. I'm taking a few classes and j
applying to grad school." A

with the company of four
teammates and her

dog from home. She's
been able to explore
other interests, enjoy
more free time, and
most importantly, fully
dedicate herself to run

rung.
"Although I've given so much to running.
I've never given as much as 1 could while also
enjoying everything that Stanford has to
offer." she said.
After her time at Stanford, McWalters
plans to get a graduate degree in Architectur
al Design. She is considering pursuing a pro
fessional running career, but working in ar
chitecture may ultimately be her calling.
"I'm on this quest to absorb everything
around me," she explained. "That kind of in
dependent thinking has driven my career
path and my desire to build and create
things."
McWalters and her fellow teammates will
compete in the biggest race of their careers
next Monday, trying to cement their team's
place in both Stanford and NCAA history.
Win or lose, though, the senior couldn't be
happier with her career as a member of the
Cardinal cross country team.
"This is an incredibly wonderful group of
people." McWalters said. "The character of
these girls and this team are what make it a
championship team. I can speak for every
one of them. That's the kind of competition
and inspiration you need when you're toeing
the line against the best teams in the nation.
We've developed a very tight bond — we're
best friends and we've shared a lot of success
es and failures.
"No matter what happens on Nov. 19, we
are definitely a team of champions."
