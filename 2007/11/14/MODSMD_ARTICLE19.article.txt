# A 						bright future for football
## 
### 
In the interest of full disclosure, I'd
like to start by saying that 1
thought I'd be writing this col
umn, more or less, a little over a
month ago. 1 was fully prepared for
the seemingly inevitable Stanford
football loss on the road against USC.
But of course, as you've heard
from dozens and hundreds and thou
sands of folks by now. that game did
n't exactly go as we expected, and
plans had to be changed. For the first
time in years, Stanford looked to
have a realistic chance at a bowl
game, with over half the season left to
play and a win over one of the top
teams in the nation under its belt.
Now, though, that goal is finally
out of the picture. Saturday's loss in
Pullman, Wash, to the Cougars put
the ceiling for wins this season at five,
one shy of the necessary six wins to be
bowl eligible. And that's assuming, of
course, that the Cardinal would be
able to finish off its season with wins
over suddenly lowly Notre Dame and
struggling Cal.
It's reasonable, then, that there is
some disappointment about how the
season has wound up for the Cardi
nal. Ask any coach or player and he'll
undoubtedly tell you that the squad
expects more from itself than its cur
rent 3-7 record. And of course, when
a team's fifth year seniors have never
had a winning season, it's a sign that a
school should be desperate for a turn
around.
But that said, while 1 understand if
neither Stanford coach Jim Har
baugh nor any of his players can be
lieve in moral victories, I can.
Cardinal staff and players should
be upset that they haven't had much
success since their win at the Colise
um.They've played what should have
winnable games against TCU, Ore
gon State, Washington and Washing
ton State and lost them all — but the
program that was reborn on the sixth
of October against the Trojans can't
be killed by four mediocre efforts.
So it's okay, my fellow Stan
fordites,if you're still a little bit giddy
at the prospect of watching this team
grow over the next few years under
Jim Harbaugh. Especially consider
ing that the rest of the Bay Area
sports world is looking pretty grim
right now.
The Giants? Rebuilding without
their lone superstar of the past half
decade. Hie 49ers?The franchise that
seemed to be on the way back two
short months ago is on the ropes yet
again and is playing like perhaps the
worst team in the NFL. The As? No
playoffs last year and no major
prospects on the way to make you


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
think this year will be better.
The list goes on and on. The
Raiders are on their third coach in
the last three years. The Warriors are
off to an 0-5 start.The Sharks have hit
the same playoff wall time and time
again. Even hated Cal has collapsed
on the gridiron this season.
To put it short: as bad as things
might seem here, they aren't much
better around the rest of the Bay
Area.
The loss of veteran receivers
Evan Moore and Mark Bradford,
center Tim Mattran and cornerback
Nick Sanchez will all undoubtedly
hurt. But there is an even greater
host of young, impact players return

ing. And it should be fun to see the
kind of freshmen class Harbaugh can
reel in with a full year of recruiting
and a nationally significant win
against USC under his belt.
So, yeah. I think "moral victory " is
the right term for the 2(X)7 Stanford
football season. And with two more
games against high-profile yet strug
gling teams, it has the potential to get
even better.
If the Cardinal can finish at 5-7. it
might be the loudest losing record in
sports history. If they follow it up
with a winning season next year, let
the sensation begin, because Stan
ford football could be the only show
in town. Or at least the only show
worth watching.
