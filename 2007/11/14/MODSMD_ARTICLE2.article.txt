# Trio talks Pakistani politics
## Profs. urge awareness of history and culture 
### MOHAMMAD ALI 
In a panel discussion last night in Cubberley
Auditorium, three Stanford professors provided
valuable commentary on the current political sit
uation in Pakistan, repeatedly emphasizing the
need for the American people, especially top
policymakers, to become more familiar with the
nation's past.
With democratization quickly becoming the
international norm, the panelists' views offered
insight into the legitimacy and sustainability of
Gen. Pervez Musharraf's authoritarian crack
down.
"It is vital to understand the history," said Se
nior Hoover Fellow Larry Diamond. "Pakistan
has such a troubled but interesting history of
democracy."
"The Evolution and Implications of an Emer
gency State," an event co-sponsored by the Mus
lim Students Awareness Network (MSAN), fo
cused on the repercussions of last week's imposi
tion of martial law in Pakistan.
Pakistan caught the world's attention be
cause of Musharraf's declaration of emergency
rule, which has effectively undermined the dem
ocratic nature of the state.
Last March. Musharraf incensed the nation's
lawyers by dismissing the chief justice. Over the
past few months, the political situation has got
ten progressively worse. Currently, the country's
independent media stations have been closed,
the constitution has been suspended, the
Supreme Court has been dismissed and many
political and human rights activists have been
detained.
Given the nature of Pakistan's vital role in
contemporary international politics, the speak
ers stressed the importance of being more edu
cated about Pakistan, agreeing that not enough
people know about the country's political histo
ry. institutions or economy.
