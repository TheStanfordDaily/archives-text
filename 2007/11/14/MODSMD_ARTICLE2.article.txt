# Trio talks Pakistani politics
## Profs. urge awareness of history and culture 
### MOHAMMAD ALI 
In a panel discussion last night in Cubberley
Auditorium, three Stanford professors provided
valuable commentary on the current political sit
uation in Pakistan, repeatedly emphasizing the
need for the American people, especially top
policymakers, to become more familiar with the
nation's past.
With democratization quickly becoming the
international norm, the panelists' views offered
insight into the legitimacy and sustainability of
Gen. Pervez Musharraf's authoritarian crack
down.
"It is vital to understand the history," said Se
nior Hoover Fellow Larry Diamond. "Pakistan
has such a troubled but interesting history of
democracy."
"The Evolution and Implications of an Emer
gency State," an event co-sponsored by the Mus
lim Students Awareness Network (MSAN), fo
cused on the repercussions of last week's imposi
tion of martial law in Pakistan.
Pakistan caught the world's attention be
cause of Musharraf's declaration of emergency
rule, which has effectively undermined the dem
ocratic nature of the state.
Last March. Musharraf incensed the nation's
lawyers by dismissing the chief justice. Over the
past few months, the political situation has got
ten progressively worse. Currently, the country's
independent media stations have been closed,
the constitution has been suspended, the
Supreme Court has been dismissed and many
political and human rights activists have been
detained.
Given the nature of Pakistan's vital role in
contemporary international politics, the speak
ers stressed the importance of being more edu
cated about Pakistan, agreeing that not enough
people know about the country's political histo
ry. institutions or economy.
Panelist Erik Jensen, a lecturer at Stanford
"I think we will see
[Musharraf's] very
quiet exit."

- ERIC JENSEN, Law School lecturei

Law School and co-director of the law school's
Rule of Law Program, expressed his dismay at
media analysts' lack of knowledge about the cur
rent situation in Pakistan.
"Sunday talk shows are absolutely careless,"
he said.
The speakers also addressed the fear of a nu
clear-armed nation in a state of political chaos.
Paul Kapur, a visiting professor at the Center for
International Security and Cooperation, in
formed the crowd about the physical separation
between the nuclear warheads and the actual fis
sile core, which make the theft of nuclear

weapons very difficult.
"Sometimes in the press you get a sense that
the weapons are sitting in a tent waiting for
someone to steal them," he said, drawing laugh
ter from the crowd.
Audience members were impressed by the
quality of the discussion.
"It was a very enlightening event," said Shiza
Shahid '11, a student from Islamabad, Pakistan.
"I was scared the event was going to be less intel
lectual and more political. But they did a good
job — they stressed that to fix the country, you
need to start a dialogue toward democracy."
"I think we will see a very quiet exit of Gener
al Musharraf over the next ten days," Jensen said.
"What we are seeing in Pakistan is something we
have never seen — the judiciary standing up and
saying no to a military dictator."
When asked what steps the United States can
take to mollify the political situation in Pakistan,
Jensen issued a warning to the audience.
"Whatever we do," he said, "it shouldn't be
what we did in the past."
