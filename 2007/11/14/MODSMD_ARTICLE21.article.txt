GAME NOTES: The loss to N0.5 Georgia
snapped N0.2 Stanford's streak of 12
straight dual meet victories. The Bulldogs did
not secure the win until the final event of the
meet, when their 400 yard freestyle relay
team out-touched the Cardinal by a quarter
of a second. Although Stanford lost, Cardi
nal swimmers took first in nine of the meet's
sixteen events. Julia Smit, Elaine Breeden
and Brooke Bishop led the team with two in
dividual victories each.

said senior captain Brooke Bishop.
"It's probably the most exciting dual
meet I've been to. Everybody was
jumping up and down and cheering."
Until last Friday, Stanford had
won every dual meet, home or away,
since the 2005-2006 season. Mean
while. the UGA swimming and div
ing team had not lost a home dual
meet since the 1995-% season. The
Lady Bulldogs win over the Card
marked their 60th straight home
dual meet win. According to junior
sprinter Madeline Rovira, the meet
was especially thrilling since both
teams had a winning streak on the
line.
"The atmosphere of the meet was

really exciting," said Rovira. "1 think
we were all positive and upbeat, and
ready to see if we could beat them
despite their long home winning
streak."
ITie two teams were remarkably
well-matched, with nearly all races
coming down to the wire. The Stan
ford women were able to edge the
'Dogs in 9 of 16 events. Bishop and
sophomores Julia Smit and Elaine
Breeden were the big winners of the
day, each capturing two individual
events apiece. Bishop sprinted her
way to victory in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyles, while Smit claimed the 200
freestyle and 200 individual medley.

Breeden. 2007 NCAA champion in
the 200 butterfly, successfully battled
Georgia's Mary Elizabeth Hill, also a
former national champion in the 200
fly, to win the 100 and 200 butterfly
events.
Ilie meet wasn't all about the vet
erans, however. Liz Smith and Meg
Hostage, both freshmen, showed
they could compete by winning the
200 breaststroke and 3-meter diving,
respectively.
"Our freshmen are adding so
much to the team." said Bishop.
"They're always so upbeat and ener
getic, and I think they don't realize
how much they help the rest of us."

According to Bishop, the Bull

by consistently out-touching their
opponents by mere tenths of a sec
ond. Georgia's Alex Putra edged
Smit by just .15 seconds in the 200
back and Bishop by only .32 seconds

Junior Caroline Bruce, the 2005

"It was kind of a bummer we did
n't win. especially since we were
touched out by a tenth of a second in
about six or seven races."said Bishop.
"It seemed like everywhere we could
have been touched out we were. But I
think now we all have a better idea of
what we need to work on, and one of
those things is fighting for the win in
the last parts of the race."

straight dual meet victories. The Bulldogs did
not secure the win until the final event of the
meet, when their 400 yard freestyle relay
team out-touched the Cardinal by a quarter
of a second. Although Stanford lost, Cardi
nal swimmers took first in nine of the meet's
sixteen events. Julia Smit, Elaine Breeden
and Brooke Bishop led the team with two in
dividual victories each.

said senior captain Brooke Bishop.
"It's probably the most exciting dual
meet I've been to. Everybody was
jumping up and down and cheering."
Until last Friday, Stanford had
won every dual meet, home or away,
since the 2005-2006 season. Mean
while. the UGA swimming and div
ing team had not lost a home dual
meet since the 1995-% season. The
Lady Bulldogs win over the Card
marked their 60th straight home
dual meet win. According to junior
sprinter Madeline Rovira, the meet
was especially thrilling since both
teams had a winning streak on the
line.
"The atmosphere of the meet was

really exciting," said Rovira. "1 think
we were all positive and upbeat, and
ready to see if we could beat them
despite their long home winning
streak."
ITie two teams were remarkably
well-matched, with nearly all races
coming down to the wire. The Stan
ford women were able to edge the
'Dogs in 9 of 16 events. Bishop and
sophomores Julia Smit and Elaine
Breeden were the big winners of the
day, each capturing two individual
events apiece. Bishop sprinted her
way to victory in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyles, while Smit claimed the 200
freestyle and 200 individual medley.

Breeden. 2007 NCAA champion in
the 200 butterfly, successfully battled
Georgia's Mary Elizabeth Hill, also a
former national champion in the 200
fly, to win the 100 and 200 butterfly
events.
Ilie meet wasn't all about the vet
erans, however. Liz Smith and Meg
Hostage, both freshmen, showed
they could compete by winning the
200 breaststroke and 3-meter diving,
respectively.
"Our freshmen are adding so
much to the team." said Bishop.
"They're always so upbeat and ener
getic, and I think they don't realize
how much they help the rest of us."

also finished first.
According to Bishop, the Bull
dogs were able to defeat the Cardinal
by consistently out-touching their
opponents by mere tenths of a sec
ond. Georgia's Alex Putra edged
Smit by just .15 seconds in the 200
back and Bishop by only .32 seconds
in the 100 back.
Junior Caroline Bruce, the 2005
NCAA champion in the 100 breast
stroke, was upset by a couple tenths
of a second in that event by Georgia
junior Mhyria Miller. Ilie Bulldogs

were also narrowly defeated the
Stanford squad of Breeden, sopho
more Nilasha Ghosh, O'Donnell-

the decisive 400 freestyle relay.
"It was kind of a bummer we did
n't win. especially since we were
touched out by a tenth of a second in
about six or seven races."said Bishop.
"It seemed like everywhere we could
have been touched out we were. But I
think now we all have a better idea of
what we need to work on, and one of
those things is fighting for the win in
the last parts of the race."

Despite conning in first in 9of 1 6 events in its dual meet against N0.5 Georgia, the Stanford women's swimming and diving team was unable to
defeat the Bulldogs. The Cardinal's second-place finish in the meet's final event led to the end of a I 2-meet winning streak for the Cardinal.
Although the win would have
been nice, both Rovira and Bishop
remained optimistic about the
team's performance.
"I think we did well."said Rovira.
"We were able to keep our energy
going and build momentum as we
went. Georgia's best races were at
the beginning, but our strongest
events came later, so we were really
able to build momentum throughout
the meet."
Bishop agreed the team's per
formance was inspiring despite the

results.
"We went into the meet having
just done a lot of traveling — a five
hour flight and then two hours on
the road — so we didn't exactly have
ideal conditions." Bishop said.
"1 lowever. combined with the travel
and really hard training lately, I
think everyone did a good job step
ping up and performing well."
ITie Cardinal divers will resume
competition this weekend, Nov. 16-
18 at the Purdue Invitational in West
Lafayette, Indiana. The swimmers
will be back in action at the Texas In
vitational N0v.29-Dec.l in Austin.
