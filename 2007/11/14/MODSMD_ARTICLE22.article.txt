# At times, OK to bend rules

Football is, as they say, a game of
inches. When you stop to think
about it.it almost seems unfair
that months of effort hang in the bal
ance of such slim margins - a missed
kick, a bad bounce or the fickleness of
a pollster's vote.
Few teams, though, can compare
their story to the raw deal a Seattle
area school got last week. Archbish
op Thomas Murphy High School - an
extant school renamed for the charis
matic. good-natured clergyman who
ran the Seattle Archdiocese until his
death in lIW7l I W7 - was ordered to forfeit
eight victories of its 10-0 season and
bow out of the state playoffs.
The Cascade Conference ruled
that an ineligible player tainted the
contests.
The source of the infraction? The
player's on-file physical expired the
week the coach died.
All athletes in Washington state
are required to have a valid medical
exam deeming them lit to play. Last
week athletic administrators prepar
ing for basketball season noticed the
playpr in question had been partici
pating with an expired physical. The
school immediately self-reported the
situation to its conference, who or
dered the school to forfeit. Four lay
ers of appeals and a court challenge
were denied Friday, and AT Ms sea
son was done.
Terry Ennis, the second-win
ningest coach in Washington football
history (287). was lured out of retire
ment in 2000 and built the school's
football program from scratch.
He made the program a feared

force in small-school competition
and added two more state titles to his
resume in 2002 and 2003.
With his health failing in a battle
with prostate cancer. Ennis contin
ued to coach this fall, winning the first
two games of this season. Then he
was hospitalized, and died Septem
ber 12. His memorial was attended by
thousands.
It appears Ennis himself handled
his players' eligibility. It is known that
he became aware in the summer that
the player's physical was due to ex
pire, and in the drama of Ennis' death
the issue got lost in the wash.
"In any other normal year, this
certainly wouldn't have happened."
said interim coach Rick Stubrud.
Ennis' brother-in-law. "I'd call it just
a very honest mistake. ITiis was not
knowingly a violation of anything.
There was no intent to violate a rule."
Stubrud had won eight straight
games in Ennis' absence.
A plea for mercy wasn't good
enough for the Washington Inter
scholastic Activities Association,
whose executive committee upheld
previous rulings.
Neither Ennis nor ATM. a small
school that most likely doesn't have a
lot of administrative muscle hanging
around to help clean up this kind of

tragedy, had a history of impropriety,
improper recruiting, or character is
sues.
This is nothing like the case of a
Stockton, Calif, high school that
knowingly and flagrantly played kids
who had been ruled ineligible by its
league.
I played sports in high school in
Seattle (also at a Catholic school, for
what it's worth). We were hounded
relentlessly about getting our paper
work in before we were allowed to
practice. In a normal situation,
there's no excuse to not get it squared
away.
But this was not a normal situa
tion. This was a revered man working
at his calling until he was literally at
death's door, serving as a father fig
ure to an innocent (and parentless)
teenager who can barely be expected
to prioritize a trip to the doctor when
a role model has retired to the side
line in the sky.
High school teams that skirt rules
to gain an unfair advantage - recruit
ing. phony academics, forged tran
scripts - should be punished, as every
team is entitled to a level playing
field. The rules about physicals are
not about competitive advantage:
they're a wise and painless form of li
ability protection.
Rules are rules - especially those
there for good reason - and must be
followed, but that doesn't mean a vi
olation should get a team the death
penalty.
Was an alternate punishment pos-

sible? Absolutely. Anyone with an
imagination could come up with a
fair sanction without shutting down
the season. ATM could have been
placed on probation. The player
could have been ordered to not par
ticipate the rest of the season. Or the
violation could have been censured
and the case dismissed with the
league's condolences for a difficult
season.
In this age of zero-tolerance
school policy, discretion is a radical
act. But instead of courage, bureau
cratic recalcitrance reigned. There is
no credible slippery-slope argument -
the school admitted the error with
profuse apology, and it's clear this
case did not result from malice or a
systemic lack of institutional control.
Given ATM's incredible success,
it's difficult to dismiss simple jealousy
as a possible factor in the league shut
ting down its flagship program's sea
son.
It's a strange turn of events, as
lately the WIAA and its subordinate
organizations haven't seemed that
interested in policing actual cheating
in high school sports.
Perennial allegations of improper
recruiting of student-athletes in sev
eral sports at a private King County
high school went unheeded for years.
Another high-profile case of a
transfer between public schools was
botched â€” at one point, the best that
could be done was to hire a PI to stalk
the player whose residency was in
question.

The most flagrant of systematic vi
olators went unpunished two years
ago. when a Seattle l imes investiga
tion showed Chief Sealth high school
to he illegally recruiting girls for its
basketball program - going so far as
to fabricate rental records to show
bogus residency and promising play
ing time and college scholarships.*
Even with hard evidence and a
ond straight state title season in'
progress, nothing was done and the;
team was allowed to play.
After several levels of Keystone
Cops authorities passed the buck,
claiming they did not have the au
thority to overturn game results, the
WIAA finally vacated the titles in
2007.
Not that the players care - they're
the ones who got their pictures taken
with the trophies.
And the Cascade Conference is
busting a team's chops because of an
expired physical?
Archbishop Murphy got hosed.,'
For this kid's case to slip through the
cracks isn't cheating. For them to
have their season thrown out is a
crime. If there was ever a situation
that asked for compassion, discre-,
tion, or some common sense, this was
it.
Three stages of supposedly level-;
headed adults had their chance to do*
right.
Thev failed.
