## Stanford alumnus takes risky spacewalk 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Situated at the end of a long ro
botic arm in outer space, Scott
Parazynski '83, M.D. '89 completed
an abnormally risky spacewalk ear
lier this month to repair a damaged
solar panel on the International
Space Station.
During the mission, Parazynski
unfolded a damaged solar panel and
repaired a wiring system. He also
improved structural support on the
giant damaged solar array.
The danger of the spacewalk
was increased by the fact that
Parazynski was completing his mis
sion perilously close to a powergrid
carrying more than 100 volts of
electricity.
The damaged solar wing, al
though not totally crippling to the
space station, would have delayed
any further expansion had it not
been repaired.
Usually, repairs are fully assessed
and planned for ahead of time by
NASA, but this particular fix-up
was completed on the fly because
astronauts could not get enough in
formation about the damage to
form a complete plan.
Parazynski underwent weeks of
practice in an attempt to get the
panel back to a fully operational
status.
After attending high school in
Iran. Parazynski came to Stanford in
1983 to pursue a degree in biological
sciences, followed by a medical de
gree in 1989.
He has flown into space on four
separate occasions previous to this
one, logging more than six weeks
and 17 million miles in space.
Parazynski returned to Earth
earlier this month on the space shut
tle Discovery.
