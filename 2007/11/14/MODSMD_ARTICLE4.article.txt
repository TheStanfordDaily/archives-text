## Rise in reported rapes due to new resources 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
Disturbing trends in violent crime are
often hidden from the public eye until
long after the fact â€” and long after any
one can be blamed for them. So why did
the Stanford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) so openly release

statistics that the number of reported
rapes on campus rose from zero in 2005 to
nine in 2006?
As it turns out, the University is actual
ly proud of this increase, in the belief that
it points to increased availability of re
sources and awareness on campus. Mem
bers of the multi-faceted support system
for sexual violence victims within the Uni

versity all agree that the increase in re
ported rapes represents an increase in
willingness to report rape, not an increase
in actual crimes.
This trend runs counter to national
data.The Rape Abuse and Incest Nation
al Network (RAINN) Web site reports
that rape is "still not being reported" on a
national level.

"The National Crime Victimization
Survey includes statistics on reported and
unreported crimes in America,"the site
reads. "Sexual assault is one of the most
underreported crimes, with more than half
still being left unreported."
Even relatively conservative estimates
from RAINN say that one in six
women will be raped or sexually as
saulted in her lifetime, and other
surveys put the number as high as
one in three.
With knowledge of national rape
statistics, the University has sus
tained effort over the past few years
to make victims feel comfortable in
reporting sexual crimes.
Last April, the Sexual Violence
Advisory Board and Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
unveiled a new Web site to central
ize information about resources
available for sexual violence victims
on campus.
The site, entitled "Sexual Assault
& Relationship Abuse Prevention
& Support at Stanford," provides a
hotline number for Stanford's Sexu
al Assault Center as well as sugges
tions of various ways that students
can report sexual crimes. The site
also lists information about which
reporting options are anonymous
and which require a legal investiga
tion or medical exam.
"Our campus wants and de
serves comprehensive information
about sexual violence and relation
ship abuse," said Sexual Violence
Advisory Board co-chair Carole
Pertofsky, who directs the Health
Promotions Services at Vaden. "For
that reason, we developed this Web
site, which is a work in progress."
Students can access the new site
by typing "rape," "relation
shipabuse," "sexualassault" or "do
mesticviolence" into the address
bar of any computer connected to
the Stanford network.
The Web site and other similar
efforts by the University have been
made possible by a two-year,
$200,000 grant received in late 2006
from the U.S. Department of Jus
tice's Violence Against Women of
fice. According to Pertofsky, the
grant is intended to support efforts
to end violence against women on
campus.
Aside from these official Univer
sity actions, campus groups have
taken steps to take the stigma out of
reporting sexual violence, con
tributing to the increase in the 2006
figures.
"It's not likely that sexual assault

itself is increasing on campus, but
that understanding and awareness
are becoming more accurate." said
Jesse Wallin '08, president of Men
Against Violence (MAV). "That
higher number is because more out
reach groups like MAV are starting
to get out there so survivors know
where they can go."
Campus programs include a
workshop on domestic violence re
sources that was held on Oct. 30 in
Palo Alto and last spring's "Take
Back the Night" vigil in White
Plaza. MAV will also be holding a
white ribbon campaign in late No
vember.
Campus Peer Health Educators
(PHEs) further spread awareness
about resources for victims of sexu
al violence.
"In my PHE-to-be class, we did a
focus group, a flier campaign and
then a skit to show nuances in rela
tionship abuse that could lead to
sexual assault," said Susi Smith '08,
a PHE in Toyon Hall. "That was to
heighten campus awareness in gen
eral."
Smith commented that, as a
freshman, she would not have
known where to go to report sexual
assault.
"1 probably would have gone to
my RA [Resident Assistant] or
someone else close to me," she said.
"Now, I'd go directly to the Y WCA."
Recent well-publicized incidents
on campus have contributed to
awareness of sexual violence on
campus, including an assault that
occurred outside Kimball Hall in
early October and the abduction of
a teenage girl on Halloween.
The SUDPS report only comes
out once a year, so detailed 2007 sta
tistics on rape and other sexual vio
lence on campus will not be avail
able for almost another year. How
ever, the Office of Judicial Affairs
reported seven cases of sexual as
sault-related violations of the Fun
damental Standard during the 2006-
2007 school year. During the previ
ous four years, there were only two
such offenses.
Despite the increase in reported
crimes, there are still many reasons
why women choose not to report
rape.
"The victim often blames herself
with a litany of '1 shouldn't haves,'
such as 1 shouldn't have gone to the
party, gone to his room [or] drank so
much." Pertofsky said, also citing
cultural victim-blaming. "But re

gardless of what the victim did or
did not do. the abuser chose to vio
late the victim."
Pertofsky added that the deci
sion to go forward and report a rape
can he "daunting." Eileen Sisk 08,
who works at the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center, agreed.
"From hearing the Stanford Po
lice speak on the protocol for sexu
al harassment and rape reporting, it
is not an easy process to report," she
said, citing the role of alcohol and
long legal battles. "The fact that
rape is a 'big deal" to report is exac
erbated in situations where the per
petrator and the survivor are ac
quaintances or friends."
Seven of the nine rapes reported
by the SUDPS took place in dorm
residences, making it likely that
many victims knew their rapists
prior to the crimes. Sisk emphasized
the public consequences that re
porting a rape can have for women.
"Making a claim that someone in
your social circle raped you could
have serious social consequences,"
she said. "A result of the stigma
against women is that it's much eas
ier to think that a girl is exaggerat
ing, rather than your guy friend is a
rapist."
According to Sisk, the Bridge
tries to counteract these pressures
by offering women the freedom to
speak in a non-judgmental environ
ment.
"1 believe the role of peer coun
selors is to provide a safe space
where the survivor could decide
whether reporting is a process that
she would like to go through and
refer survivors to other resources,"
she said.
Only time will tell whether the
nine reported rapes last year were
an exception to the rule, or the start
of a new trend of openly reporting
campus rape. But Sociology Prof.
Paula England, who recently con
ducted a survey on the sexual be
haviors of college students, reiterat
ed just how difficult reporting rape
can be.
"Because of the double standard
by which women are judged more
harshly than men if they are seen as
'too sexual,' women fear that they
will be judged for [actions such as]
going to his room," she said. "And
indeed when women are raped, they
often are judged."
