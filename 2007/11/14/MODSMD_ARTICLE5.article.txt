# Operation separates twins
## Girls condition stable but critical 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
When Fiorella Rocha-Arias next opens
her eyes, the first thing she sees won't be her
sister Yurelia. For the first time since they
were born, the conjoined twins are sleeping
in separate beds.
The two-year-old girls were successfully
separated on Monday at Lucille Packard
Children's Hospital.
Yurelia and Fiorella were thoraco-om
phalopagus twins, joined at the chest and
abdomen.The girls' livers were fused into a
single organ and their hearts were attached
at the right atria. Doctors had estimated the
chances of both twins surviving their sepa
ration surgery at 50 percent, but the girls
beat the odds.
"The surgery went exactly as we
planned." said Gary Hartman. a clinical
professor in pediatric surgery, addressing a
crowd of reporters in front of the hospital.
Both girls remain heavily sedated, in stable
but critical condition.

The procedure to separate the twins
took nine hours. The girls were in the oper
ating room at 6:25 a.m. on Monday, and
their surgeons made the first cut at 8:30. By
10:30 a.m.. the separation of their livers was
complete, and their hearts were separated
an hour later.
The critical moment in the surgery came
when surgeons first clamped off the con
nection between the twins' hearts. As the
surgeons cut the link between the two girls'
blood supplies,"we knew they could deteri
orate," Hartman said. But both twins actu
ally improved.
"1 knew at that point the separation
would go ahead," Hartman said.
Fiorella, the larger twin, was wheeled to
another room for repair of a heart defect
and reconstructive surgery on her chest and
abdomen.
Yurelia must go back to the operating
room for open-heart surgery later this

For now. both girls are recuperat
ing in a shared hospital room. Hart
man has separated five pairs of con
joined twins in his career as a surgeon,
and he said that when the children he
has separated wake up alone for the
first time,"they reach for their twin."
The hospital's psychiatry department
worked with Yurelia and Fiorella and
their family pre-operatively to mini
mize the psychological trauma of the
separation.
The girls were born in San Jose.
Costa Rica and are the youngest of
eleven children.
Carlos Esquivel, the surgeon who
worked to separate the girls' livers,
said Yurelia and Fiorella's parents
were ecstatic when they learned their
daughters had made it through sur
gery.
"They were relieved, happy, full ot
emotions," said Esquivel, who is also
from Costa Rica.
Should they continue to do well,
Yurelia and Fiorella will spend three
to four weeks in the hospital. Part of
their recovery process will include
learning to walk as individuals. The
girls had learned to coordinate their

four legs and walk together just a few
weeks before their surgery.
Yurelia and Fiorella flew to the
United States with their mother in
July. In August, they had tissue ex
panders implanted in their shared ab
domen and chest.The balloon-like ex
panders were gradually filled with
saline to allow for the growth of new
skin to cover the twins' wounds after
their separation.
