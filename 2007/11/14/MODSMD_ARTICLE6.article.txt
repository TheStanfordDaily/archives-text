## Rumsfeld bill barely fails to pass in ASSU Senators stress other issues more tangible for undergrads 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
After weeks of delay, the "Resolution to Express
Opposition to the Appointment of Donald Rums
feld as a Hoover Distinguished Fellow" did not pass
at last night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing. The vote — 8-5-2. with the hulk of senators in
support of the bill — lacked the two-thirds majority
needed to officially pass the resolution. Ultimately,
the vote came down to an issue of whether or not the
Senate was the proper forum to discuss such issues,
rather than a question of support for the appoint
ment itself.
Several students attended the meeting and
voiced their personal opinions on Rumsfeld's pres-
ence on campus, urging the Senate to
seriously consider their appeals.
"In my opinion. [Rumsfeld's appoint
ment] violates our mission and pretty
much the moral conscience of the
University," said Adam Hudson '10.
"If you vote 'yes,' I think it will send a
message to the entire world that Stan
ford stands for something greater.The
Senate is the perfect channel [to do
so]."
However, while voting, several
senators expressed concern regarding
the appropriateness of voting on the
Rumsfeld issue on behalf of the entire
undergraduate population. Although
many senators are in opposition to
Rumsfeld's appointment, they argued
that passing a resolution concerning
this matter is beyond the scope of the
Senate, which they believe should
focus on undergraduate life.
"The Senate is not the right forum

to give a general senate-wide bill on
this type of issue," said Senator
Jonathan Kass *10, who voted against
the hill despite his opposition to
Rumsfeld's appointment. "I think
condemning one person has its issues,
especially when we have nothing to do
with his appointment. 1 don't think
that his decision to stay at Stanford
has anything to do with us. and 1 don't
think that [the bill] will have any ef
fect."
Senators that questioned whether
the Senate has the authority to pass
such bills said they should focus their
attention on tangible initiatives —
like the Bike Light Extravaganza and
Shuttle Service — that can have a di
rect impact on the student population.
"This is a good thing for us," said
Senator Luukas lives '09. "It really
gives us the opportunity to put this be
hind us and start working on things
that affect students in their day-to-day
lives and have a positive effect on the
life on this campus."
"I think that a petition with 4,000
signatures speaks for itself," Kass
added. "Ultimately, I want the student

body to know that the debate was not
about whether or not we liked Rums
feld. Voting'no' sends a powerful mes
sage as far as what types of issues we
feel we can have an impact on and
what types of issues are better left to
other forums."
Kass urged senators in opposition
to Rumsfeld's appointment to use
their position to speak with President
John Hennessy and officials at the
Hoover Institution in order to take a
stance and make a change.
Those that voted 'no' on the bill
truly felt that the Senate was in no po
sition to pass judgments on Rums
feld's character.
"Unfortunately, it is not up to us to
judge [this issue]," said Senator Jose
Benchimol '08. "I am for people
protesting and expressing their views,
and Stanford will suffer from his ap
pointment, but it is not up to us."
"I am personally very opposed to
Donald Rumsfeld being here, but I
also received a lot of emails and Face
book messages telling me that this is
not something that the Undergradu
ate Senate should deal with," said Un

dergraduate Senate Chair Priyanka
Sharma '09. "This bill is not just about
expressing dissatisfaction about
Rumsfeld's appointment, but it is also
about what we as Senators represent."
Despite the ultimate decision not
to pass the resolution, a number of
Senators agreed that the Senate was a
fitting forum to pass resolutions re
garding Rumsfeld's appointment and
voted in support of the bill.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 em
phasized the importance not to ab
stain from the vote since it is such a
hotbutton issue among the under
graduates.
"Some senators have suggested
that the appointment of Donald
Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institute is
far beyond the scope of the under
graduates," Cordova said. "I counter
that Stanford students are stakehold
ers in the Stanford community. As
such, every other individual who
claims affiliation with Stanford Uni
versity represents them."
Senator Re Phillips '10 reminded
senators of the ability they have as
elected officials to help make a change

on campus.
"I just want to encourage the sena
tors not to underestimate our voice as
the Senate," Phillips said. "It is a voice
that represents 6,500 undergraduates
that are on this campus. We can fight
this from a Senate office. It is worth a
try, and let's not give up before we
have spoken."
After the vote was cast, senators in
support of the bill were disappointed
with the results.
"While senators can vote 'no' for
whatever reason they choose, saying
this is not the appropriate forum
strikes me as a bit ludicrous," said Sen
ator Stuart Baimel '09. the author of
the bill. "What other forum is there to
discuss issues of this magnitude?"
Ultimately, the vote boiled down to
the decision that the Senate was not a
forum for handling such issues but
rather to hold events that positively
and directly affect students.
"Trust that a lot of thought went
into this decision," Kass said.
