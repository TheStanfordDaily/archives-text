## Graduate Life Only for the "Nerdcore" Grad student raps to his own beat 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Calling all geeks: ever thought you could bust a
rhyme like MC Hammer, if oniy you had some
thing to rap about? With a new music movement
called "nerdcore,' you can finally put down that Rubik's
Cube and start spittin' game like Ice Cube.
In fact, Dan Maynes-Aminzade, a fifth year Ph.D. can
didate in Computer Science, is doing just that.
"There's a long history of rap music dealing with
nerdy topics," said Maynes-Aminzade. "It just hasn't
been considered a musical genre until recently. Look
back to songs by Weird A 1 Yankovic, like it's All About
the Pentiums.' Even the Beastie Boys are a little bit nerdy
sometimes."
Maynes-Aminzade has been committed to making his
own rap music for several years now.
"I've always enjoyed rap and hip-hop," he said. "In
high school, I wished I could be as cool as these rappers I
saw on TV. My friends and I used to get together and
make rap songs about nerdy topics, like how good our
math team was. Then we all went off to college and real
ized how horrible our songs were."
But two years ago. when Maynes-Aminzade heard fel
low nerdcore rapper "MC Plus+," he decided to produce
his own work under the alias of "Monzy."

Last year, one of his songs was
filmed for the documentary "Nerd-

core for Life." Now posted on
Youtube, the video — in which t
he performs outside the Gates I
Computer Science building —

has received over 200.CXX) hits.
"Since I started doing nerd
core again, the genre has real- /
ly blossomed." he said. /
"There's lots more atten- /

tion on it.Two documen
taries about the

genre are cur
rently being
made."
Though the
popularity of his
music continues
to grow,
Maynes-Am
inzade main-

tains that the music he writes is
purely for himself and a small
group of friends — rather than
for a profit.
"As for the commercial via
bility of nerdcore in general, it's
unlikely for real nerdcore to

have mainstream commer
cial success," he said. "Weird
A 1 has very accessible nerd-

core because most people under
stand it. But many people in nerd
core make a lot of inside jokes that
aren't really accessible to the gener
al public. I throw out some refer
ences in my songs that are so obscure
you'd need at least a B.S. in Comput
er Science to understand them."
Critics have pointed out that
nerdcore relies too heavily on paro
dy to be taken seriously as a musical
genre: some have even gone as far as
to call it racist in its spoofing of
African-American hip hop artists by
white, suburban teenagers.
"I personally view nerdcore more
as an homage than a parody," said
Maynes-Aminzade."! really like rap

music, and I wish I were that cool, so
I'll try to do it myself. But because
standard and traditional themes of
the genre don't resonate with my
life, I'll spin it into something that
makes sense to me."
However, he agrees with critics
that nerdcore will probably never
enter mainstream culture.
"1 would almost define 'nerds' as,
people who have interests outside
the mainstream," he said. "Nerdcore
is a way to show how proud you are
to care about the things nobody else
does. When something like that be
comes mainstream, then it's not real
ly nerd culture anymore."
